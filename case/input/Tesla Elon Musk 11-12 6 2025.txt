10:14:11  [X] - @elonmusk: Worth it https://t.co/fQk2ULx7jh | @JDVanceNewsX Elon Musk lost 25% of his fortune, approximately $113 billion, while leading efforts to streamline the U.S. government. 

Are you willing to give Elon Musk a heartfelt “thank you”?

A. H*** yes
B. No https://t.co/i2H7YakRqC -
10:13:08  [X] (TSLA.O) - @elonmusk: Replying to @OwenSparks_: Tentatively, June 22.

SpaceX doesn't need the additional capital and they seem to be able to meet liquidity needs of the employee base via periodic tenders.
