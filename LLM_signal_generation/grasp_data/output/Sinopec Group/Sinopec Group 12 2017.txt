Sinopec Group,2017-12,"CHONGQING, China/SINGAPORE, Dec 29 (Reuters) - China plans to launch a natural gas exchange in Chongqing in early 2018, aiming to create an Asian price benchmark as the nation's use of the fuel surges amid its shift away from coal."
Sinopec Group,2017-12,China is the world's third-biggest consumer of natural gas behind the United States and Russia. An exchange in its fast-growing market would be a strong contender for an Asian gas marker off which other supplies in the region could be priced.
Sinopec Group,2017-12,"The Chongqing Oil and Gas Exchange - supported by state energy majors, and private and local government-backed gas distributors - would provide a trading platform for domestic output, pipeline imports from Central Asia and Myanmar, and imports of liquefied natural gas (LNG)."
Sinopec Group,2017-12,"Chongqing is China's second attempt to develop a traded gas market, having set up a similar exchange in 2015 in Shanghai."
Sinopec Group,2017-12,An Asian gas price benchmark to stand next to those of the United States and Europe is seen as a key missing piece in establishing a truly global market for natural gas.
Sinopec Group,2017-12,"""The exchange is a product of the government's reform push - to hand the pricing power to the market,"" Exchange Chairman Zhang Bowen told Reuters."
Sinopec Group,2017-12,"""The long-term goal is to build the exchange into a benchmark for Asia and to win China its deserved pricing power,"" said Zhang, who was previously president of PetroChina Kunlun Energy."
Sinopec Group,2017-12,"The exchange, led by a board of nine directors including a former PetroChina <601857.SS> executive and an ex-senior state planning official, expects to launch electronically-based spot trading of pipeline gas and LNG imports in the first half of next year. [L4N1OL276]"
Sinopec Group,2017-12,"Registered in Chongqing municipality in July with 1 billion yuan ($150 million) in capital, the exchange has a team of 30, including former market developers at state-owned energy giants CNOOC and Sinopec <600028.SS>."
Sinopec Group,2017-12,"""A China gas hub certainly looks attractive from a supply/demand and infrastructure perspective,"" said Jeff Brown, president of consultancy Facts Global Energy (FGE)."
Sinopec Group,2017-12,"Chongqing exchange is appraising around 200 potential members, mostly from the consuming hub of eastern China, and will be open to foreign participation in the longer run, said exchange executives."
Sinopec Group,2017-12,"Still, there are several challenges to overcome, for Chongqing or any other exchanges hoping to establish an active gas trading platform. [nL8N1OM0IM]"
Sinopec Group,2017-12,"""The biggest would be that the government is still heavily involved in 'guiding' prices. Access to pipelines and import terminals can also be difficult,"" said Brown."
Sinopec Group,2017-12,China's National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) currently sets wholesale or city-gate gas prices by linking them to alternative fuels such as liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and fuel oil.
Sinopec Group,2017-12,"Investors fear China could be as heavy-handed with gas as it has been with coal. Authorities have repeatedly intervened whenever coal prices have risen sharply, contributing to the virtual death of coal futures in Asia. [nL3N1HK3UG] [nL8N1LA1FG]"
Sinopec Group,2017-12,China is also struggling to build the infrastructure needed to freely distribute gas supplies. An inadequate pipeline grid and insufficient storage helped to trigger a supply crunch this winter after millions of households were switched from using coal to gas for heating. [nL4N1OK3PB]
Sinopec Group,2017-12,"""Pipelines need to be more connected and greater access allowed for third parties to the grid and terminals. More investments are needed to boost gas storage,"" Song Dacai, chairman of the Chongqing exchange's supervision committee and formerly a pricing official with the NDRC."
Sinopec Group,2017-12,"The exchange, though, is confident rising demand and slowly expanding gas infrastructure will help it succeed. [nL4N1DG1QU]"
Sinopec Group,2017-12,"Chongqing, with its population of more than 30 million and proximity to Sichuan province's large gas basin, already has a relatively well-developed gas grid, and distributors there are keen to participate on the exchange."
Sinopec Group,2017-12,"""As an investor, we are keen to become a market maker, provided that suppliers are ready to post meaningful volumes for us to trade,"" said Luo Jing, deputy head of gas development at China Gas Holdings <0883.HK>, a piped gas distributor."
Sinopec Group,2017-12,"State majors are expected to nominate available volumes on the exchange annually or bi-annually, said Zhang, the exchange chairman."
Sinopec Group,2017-12,Others that are trying to develop regional gas exchanges as the basis for an Asian benchmark include Shanghai Petroleum and Gas Exchange and the Japan Korea Marker (JKM) by S&P Global Platts .
Sinopec Group,2017-12,"The Shanghai exchange, launched in 2015, has so far failed to attract much trading interest. China's financial hub, though, is seen as a potential oil and gas trading centre and likely home of China's long delayed crude oil derivatives contract. [nL3N1O54BY]"
Sinopec Group,2017-12,"In many way, the JKM, an LNG price assessment, is seen as the strongest contender to become a regional gas benchmark."
Sinopec Group,2017-12,"""JKM seems to be gaining steam as an Asian gas price ... Since LNG is the most commoditised gas in Asia, it seems best placed to emerge as the Asia price marker,"" FGE's Brown said."

Sinopec Group,2017-12,"Registered in July with one billion yuan in capital, the exchange gathers 13 investors, with Chongqing Energy Investment Group [CHGQGC.UL] and state majors CNPC and Sinopec making up the core group, each holding a 13 percent stake."

Sinopec Group,2017-12,"BEIJING, Dec 22 (Reuters) - China's major oil and gas operator Sinopec stepped up efforts to increase domestic gas supplies as widespread shortages hit more cities this week."
Sinopec Group,2017-12,Sinopec said it will increase upstream production by 1.1 million cubic metres per day and has hired 40 trucks to deliver LNG from its Beihai LNG terminal in south Guangxi province to northern China regions.

Sinopec Group,2017-12,* That has left many freezing at the start of winter
Sinopec Group,2017-12,"BEIJING, Dec 22 (Reuters) - When an inspector from a local environmental protection bureau visited a small village in China's Shandong province in October to check on a gasification project, she said village officials became tearful in lamenting how far behind schedule they were."
Sinopec Group,2017-12,"For years, the village has been haunted by pollution from nearby coal mines and chemical plants. The village had been rushing to finish installing new gas boilers for residents as they ditched their old coal stoves, the inspector told Reuters."
Sinopec Group,2017-12,"The boilers are part of an ambitious gasification programme under which millions of households, and some industrial users, are switching from coal to natural gas for heating, as Beijing tries to clean the tainted air in northern China after decades of galloping growth."
Sinopec Group,2017-12,"The effect of the dramatic switch has been felt globally, with internationally shipped gas prices almost doubling this year to more than $10 per million British thermal units, the highest since the end of 2014."
Sinopec Group,2017-12,"It has also been felt locally due to poor coordination among government bodies and gas producers, and miscalculations in demand, which have sent gas prices soaring, left many residents freezing in their homes, and shuttered factories."
Sinopec Group,2017-12,"Where there is gas supply, it cannot reach homes in some cases as the replacement gas infrastructure has not been installed."
Sinopec Group,2017-12,"""Everyone's job is linked to whether we can meet the target,"" the environmental protection inspector said, declining to be named and refusing to identify the village due to sensitivity of the matter."

Sinopec Group,2017-12,"""If we did not meet the target, we will get bad performance reviews and we will start worrying about our careers,"" the inspector said. She declined to specify the targets."
Sinopec Group,2017-12,"As the crisis escalates with China entering the coldest weeks of the year, local officials and fuel suppliers have started to point fingers, according to officials with whom Reuters spoke."

Sinopec Group,2017-12,Executives from major gas suppliers Sinopec and PetroChina told Reuters inadequate communication between government officials and producers over the number and type of projects has caused them to underestimate the pace of the gas expansion programme this year.
Sinopec Group,2017-12,"""The number of gas projects were first reported to the county, then to the city, then the province and other central departments,"" said a Sinopec official, declining to be named."
Sinopec Group,2017-12,"""When it gets to us, it is almost too late to adjust our plans accordingly,"" he said."
Sinopec Group,2017-12,"In early spring, the Sinopec official estimated that nationwide gas demand could rise as much as 30 billion cubic metres (bcm) this year versus a consensus estimate of less than 15 bcm."
Sinopec Group,2017-12,"The official said colleagues had initially dismissed his forecast, after three years of lacklustre sales and a warm spring had dampened gas consumption. But it turned out to be true. Gas consumption grew 18 percent in January-September, far outpacing the year-earlier rate."

Sinopec Group,2017-12,(The authors are Reuters Breakingviews columnists. The opinions expressed are their own.)
Sinopec Group,2017-12,"NEW YORK/HONG KONG, Dec 19 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Saudi Arabia's Mohammed bin Salman is a crown prince in a hurry. Besides detaining members of his family in a corruption sweep and painting a high-tech vision of the kingdom's future, the young ruler-in-waiting is also planning to sell a chunk of the national oil company, Saudi Aramco, to international investors. For that to proceed in 2018, he'll need to choose a venue besides Riyadh for the listing early in the year. China looks like the best option."
Sinopec Group,2017-12,"Setting aside questions about Aramco's value, which the crown prince himself has pegged at an ambitious $2 trillion, there are hurdles to bringing what's likely to be the world's largest corporation to more traditional marketplaces."
Sinopec Group,2017-12,"Start with London. Britain is bending over backwards to bring Aramco to the London Stock Exchange . Prime Minister Theresa May and then-LSE chief Xavier Rolet traveled to Riyadh and lobbied Aramco's chairman for the business in April. Over the summer, the Financial Conduct Authority proposed to twist its rules to create a new listing category for companies controlled by sovereign states. Amid some resistance, the rules have yet to be finalized."
Sinopec Group,2017-12,"There's also an additional wrinkle. The LSE's biggest shareholder is the Qatar Investment Authority, the sovereign wealth fund of that country's al-Thani monarchy. Yet Saudi Arabia launched a trade and economic boycott of Qatar in early 2017, alongside other Gulf nations. The crown prince, in an interview with Reuters Breakingviews in October, called Qatar's investment a ""very, very, very small issue."" But that still signals it's an issue."
Sinopec Group,2017-12,All of which raises the possibility of Hong Kong's role in Aramco's future. The Chinese city is morphing from a mere back-up plan to a potential front-runner among the deal's backers.
Sinopec Group,2017-12,"One reason is flexibility. Though the Hong Kong exchange would need to bend some rules to allow Aramco to list, Chief Executive Charles Li is loudly signaling his eagerness. He's pushing a new program called ""Primary Connect,"" which would allow mainland Chinese investors to buy into initial public offerings in the special administrative region's exchange. Li says that's ""key"" to closing the Saudi float."
Sinopec Group,2017-12,"A 5 percent free float would be easier to swallow. At $100 billion, it would leave the company adjacent to insurer AIA <1299.HK>, politely leaving mainland tech champion Tencent <0700.HK> in first place. Exchange executives would have to deem the Tadawul exchange in Riyadh to offer standards of shareholder protection ""equivalent to those provided in Hong Kong,"" but that is unlikely to take long."

Sinopec Group,2017-12,"""The effect (of the output cuts) we have found neutral as the reduction in Middle East export volumes was replaced by increased volumes from Atlantic Basin,"" said Robert Hvide Macleod, chief executive of leading tanker owner Frontline Management."
Sinopec Group,2017-12,"Macleod told Reuters that as a result of the continued cap ""we believe the 'new trades' will develop further - long-term positive for shipping""."
Sinopec Group,2017-12,"Unipec, the trading arm of Asia's largest oil refiner Sinopec <600028.SS>, signalled last week its intention to double the volume of U.S. oil it will import next year from 6 million tonnes this year. [nL3N1NU1SB]"
Sinopec Group,2017-12,"There are around 24-30 VLCC cargoes a month from the U.S.-Caribbean region, brokers said."
Sinopec Group,2017-12,"""With crude from the Caribbean-U.S. Gulf area being heavy sour crude it will only find a home - China and India - which have the refineries that can process them,"" said Ashok Sharma, managing director of Singapore shipbroker BRS Baxi Far East."
Sinopec Group,2017-12,"""There is not going to be an instant reflex in the tanker markets to the oil producers' decision on Thursday. But shale oil producers will increase production,"" Sharma said."
Sinopec Group,2017-12,Brokers estimated there were an average of around 15 fewer VLCC cargoes per month from the Middle East since the cuts were implemented in January.
Sinopec Group,2017-12,"That, together with the delivery of around 52 new VLCCs this year, has increased the number of ships available for charter, putting pressure on freight rates."
Sinopec Group,2017-12,"Supertanker earnings for a voyage from the Middle East to Japan dropped to around $18,200 per day on Thursday, compared with $32,600 per day at the fourth quarter peak on Oct. 17, data on the Reuters Eikon terminal showed."
