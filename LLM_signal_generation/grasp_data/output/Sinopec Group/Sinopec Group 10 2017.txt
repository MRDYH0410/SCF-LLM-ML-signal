Sinopec Group,2017-10,"Alaska Gasline Development Corp (AGDC), the State of Alaska, Sinopec <601988.SS>, China Investment Corp [CIC.UL] and the Bank of China <601988.SS> have signed an agreement to advance (LNG) in Alaska, the U.S. government said in an email."
Sinopec Group,2017-10,"The agreement will involve investment of up to $43 billion, create up to 12,000 U.S. jobs during construction, reduce the trade deficit between the United States and Asia by $10 billion a year, and give China clean energy, it said."
Sinopec Group,2017-10,"AGDC is building a gas treatment plant, an 800-mile (1,287 km) pipeline to south central Alaska for in-state use, and a liquefaction plant in Nikiski to produce up to 20 million tons of LNG per year for export. [nL2N1N10A5]"
Sinopec Group,2017-10,"China, the world's third-largest gas buyer, is importing more LNG as the government tries to wean the country off dirty coal as part of its push to clear the skies, while the United States wants to sell more of its excess gas abroad."

Sinopec Group,2017-10,"A similar short-term supply crunch late last year boosted spot Asian LNG prices by more than 80 in the last four months of the year, and pushed China's December 2016 imports to a record 3.7 million tonnes, nearly double the 2016 average of just 2 million tonnes a month."

Sinopec Group,2017-10,"LONDON, Nov 2 (Reuters) - A quarter of the world's oil refineries risk closure by 2035 if governments meet targets to limit fossil fuel burning in the fight against global warming, a report released on Thursday said."
Sinopec Group,2017-10,"A surge in electric vehicle sales and higher efficiency in internal combustion and jet engines are expected to slow demand growth for fuels such as gasoline, diesel and aviation fuel in the coming decades, potentially putting pressure on refining profits."
Sinopec Group,2017-10,"At the same time, governments around the world are set to introduce legislation in the coming years to limit emissions of heat-capturing carbon dioxide into the atmosphere in order to meet targets set at a U.N-backed Paris conference in 2015."
Sinopec Group,2017-10,"As a result, companies such as Chevron , Royal Dutch Shell , France' Total and China's largest refiner Sinopec could see profits from refining drop by 70 percent or more over the period, according to the report co-authored by environment thinktank Carbon Tracker, Swedish investment fund AP7 and Danish pension fund PKA."
Sinopec Group,2017-10,The study is based on the International Energy Agency's 450 Scenario to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius under which oil demand declines by 23 percent between 2020 and 2035.
Sinopec Group,2017-10,"Under this scenario, despite new refinery additions in Asia and the Middle East, only 62 percent of global capacity will be required to meet demand compared with around 80 percent today. Profits from converting crude oil into refined products will also shrink."
Sinopec Group,2017-10,"That in turn means that approximately one quarter of the 2016 refining capacity, the equivalent of some 24.7 million barrels per day of oil demand, will need to be closed, the report said."
Sinopec Group,2017-10,"The closures would likely be more pronounced in developed economies where oil demand is expected to peak earlier than in developing economies. Also, modern, complex refineries that can produce more high quality and cleaner fuels are likely to fare better than older plants."
Sinopec Group,2017-10,"""The consequences of achieving a 2 degree Celsius world are far more detrimental to the refining sector than the upstream sector, as it results in structural over-capacity and associated poor refining margin environment, which can only be addressed by sustained capacity rationalisation,"" said Alan Gelder, vice president for research at Edinburgh-based consultancy Wood Mackenzie which took part in the report."
Sinopec Group,2017-10,Meeting the emission reduction targets however seems distant today. A report published on Tuesday said global emissions are set to be 30 percent higher than the target needed by 2030.[nL8N1N640X]
Sinopec Group,2017-10,"While oil companies including Shell have acknowledged that demand for some fuels such as gasoline could peak by the end of the 2020s, they expect demand for oil to remain strong for decades from heavy transport, aviation and chemical production."
Sinopec Group,2017-10,"The authors of the report estimate that overall earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) for refiners could fall by over 50 percent by 2035 from around $147 billion in 2015."
Sinopec Group,2017-10,"""We consider that prospective investors should be wary of all new refinery investments,"" the report said."
Sinopec Group,2017-10,"""When demand growth stalls and turns negative, new investments will carry the risk of failing to earn an adequate return."""
Sinopec Group,2017-10,Carbon Tracker and a group of investors warned in a report earlier this year that oil giants risk spending trillions by 2025 on oil and gas projects that won't be feasible under the international climate targets. [nL8N1JI1P9]

Energy and industrial companies like General Electric will have a chance to cozy up to Beijing's new leadership during U.S. President Donald Trump's upcoming Asia trip, but Wall Street isn't coming along. The U.S. business delegation's composition reflects Trump's desires to find low-hanging fruit deals to tout domestically, but low expectations for deeper concessions."

Sinopec Group,2017-10,{{20171019T082741.579+0000}}UPDATE 2-China's bold gas plan may threaten winter power supplies * Underlines growing concerns about pipeline capacity
Sinopec Group,2017-10,* Millions of homes to be heated by gas for first time
Sinopec Group,2017-10,"BEIJING, Oct 19 (Reuters) - China has ordered state oil companies to speed up the construction of pipelines to move natural gas to homes and factories, underscoring worries that the country's insufficient infrastructure could cause power outages during the peak winter demand period."
Sinopec Group,2017-10,"This winter, millions of homes across the colder northern regions of the world's second-largest economy will be heated for the first time by gas rather than coal, as part of Beijing's effort to boost clean fuel use."
Sinopec Group,2017-10,"But with just a month before newly installed radiators get switched on, the National Development & Reform Commission (NDRC) warned on Thursday that supply and demand conditions could be ""serious"" this winter."
Sinopec Group,2017-10,"The alert shows Beijing is trying to head off supply disruptions during the peak demand period from November until March. Residential users with their radiators will have supply priority over industrial users, increasing the possibility of power losses during gas shortages."
Sinopec Group,2017-10,"""We are all quite concerned with supply shortages this winter ... as we may not have the infrastructure capacity to catch up with the demand growth,"" said Li Wei, a vice president of Kunlun Energy <0135.HK>, which operates liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals and gas production plants."
Sinopec Group,2017-10,"Wood Mackenzie estimates the heating needs alone will add 10 billion cubic metres (bcm) to China's gas demand, the equivalent of Vietnam's annual consumption. The country is expected to use about 230 bcm this year. [nL4N1L505H]"
Sinopec Group,2017-10,Small industrial users like hospitals have also had to switch to gas this winter.
Sinopec Group,2017-10,"China will either need to ramp up imports, offering a boon for major exporters like Russia, or big industrial consumers may get interrupted, warned Kerry Anne Shanks, head of Asia gas and LNG research at consultants Wood Mackenzie.[nL4N1MO1MM] [nL2N1MN0A5]"
Sinopec Group,2017-10,"""This depends on weather. (But) we worry that China doesn't have enough storage,"" she said."
Sinopec Group,2017-10,"China has only 8 bcm of gas storage capacity, or about 4 percent of its demand. That is much lower than other gas-using regions like the United States and Europe, which typically store about 15 percent to 25 percent of their annual needs, she said."
Sinopec Group,2017-10,Winter weather will be the main factor for demand and forecast models are not yet clear.
Sinopec Group,2017-10,"While long-range forecasts point to a slightly warmer-than-average winter in the major cities of Beijing and Shanghai, the forecasts show that conditions until December are likely to be unusually cold."
Sinopec Group,2017-10,"Colder weather later in the season would be more challenging because it is harder to pull gas from storage when the tanks are emptier, Shanks said."

Sinopec Group,2017-10,"DUBAI/LONDON, Oct 16 (Reuters) - China is offering to buy up to 5 percent of Saudi Aramco directly, sources said, a move that could give Saudi Arabia the flexibility to consider various options for its plan to float the world's biggest oil producer on the stock market."
Sinopec Group,2017-10,"Chinese state-owned oil companies PetroChina <0857.HK> and Sinopec <0386.HK> have written to Saudi Aramco in recent weeks to express an interest in a direct deal, industry sources told Reuters. The companies are part of a state-run consortium including China's sovereign wealth fund, the sources say."
Sinopec Group,2017-10,"Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said last year the kingdom was considering listing about 5 percent of Aramco in 2018 in a deal that could raise $100 billion, if the company is valued at about $2 trillion as hoped."
Sinopec Group,2017-10,"""The Chinese want to secure oil supplies,"" one of the industry sources said. ""They are willing to take the whole 5 percent, or even more, alone."""
Sinopec Group,2017-10,The initial public offering (IPO) of Saudi Aramco is the centrepiece of an economic reform plan to diversify the Saudi economy beyond oil and it would also provide a welcome boost to the kingdom's budget which has been hit by low oil prices.

Sinopec Group,2017-10,"The sources also point to disagreements between senior government officials, with some pushing only to list Aramco locally or to delay the IPO beyond 2018 when they hope oil prices will have stabilised at $55 to $60 a barrel."
Sinopec Group,2017-10,"""A range of options, for the public listing of Saudi Aramco, continue to be held under active review. No decision has been made and the IPO process remains on track,"" said a Saudi Aramco spokesman."
Sinopec Group,2017-10,Industry sources said the sale of a significant stake to Chinese firms was one of several options being considered by the kingdom as it weighs the benefits of a public listing.
Sinopec Group,2017-10,"One option includes selling some stock immediately to so-called cornerstone investors, such as China, and then selling shares on the local bourse as well as an international stock exchange, with New York, London and Hong Kong in the running."
Sinopec Group,2017-10,"Two senior industry sources said Riyadh was keen on China, its biggest buyer of oil, becoming a cornerstone investor in Aramco. But no decision has yet been taken on whether to accept China's offer, or how much stock could be offered to cornerstone investors, the sources said."
Sinopec Group,2017-10,"China is creating a consortium made up of state-owned oil firms, banks and its sovereign wealth fund to act as a cornerstone investor in the IPO, people with knowledge of the discussions told Reuters in April. [nL3N1HR49S]"
Sinopec Group,2017-10,"Sources told Reuters on Friday that Saudi Aramco was now evaluating a private placement of shares to a Chinese investor as a precursor to an international IPO, which could be delayed beyond 2018. [nL4N1MO563]"
Sinopec Group,2017-10,"But allowing China to buy 5 percent would effectively mean cancelling the IPO altogether, which is an unlikely outcome, one of the sources said."
Sinopec Group,2017-10,"Sources said postponing the listing would be the least preferred option, given the preparations that have been already done and the determination of Prince Mohammed, who is expected to be the next king, to proceed with the listing."
Sinopec Group,2017-10,"Two sources told Reuters that sovereign wealth funds from South Korea and Japan, which are also major buyers of Saudi oil, were also interested in acquiring a stake in Aramco."
Sinopec Group,2017-10,One of the sources said Russia's sovereign wealth fund RDIF was keen to invest in the Aramco IPO too.
Sinopec Group,2017-10,"Any alliance between Saudi Arabia and China could go beyond the purchase of a stake in Aramco and also include a reciprocal move by the Saudi company to invest in the Chinese refining industry, according to industry sources."
Sinopec Group,2017-10,"That would fit in with a push by the world's top oil exporter to regain its dominance in supplying China, the world's second largest oil consumer after the United States, having lost the upper hand to Russia this year. [nL4N1M227M]"
Sinopec Group,2017-10,Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said in August that he expected to finalise a deal with PetroChina early next year to invest in the Yunnan oil refinery in China's southwest that started operations in July. [nL8N1L94F3]

The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.)
Sinopec Group,2017-10,"LONDON, Oct 16 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Saudi Aramco's initial public offering is a nice-to-have, easily mistaken for a must-have. A consortium of Chinese companies including oil producers PetroChina <601857.SS> and Sinopec <600028.SS> has offered to buy 5 percent of the company directly, sources told Reuters, as its international listing hangs in the balance. The benefits for Saudi Arabia of an Aramco IPO, though, are not to be found in Beijing."
Sinopec Group,2017-10,"As for influence, China offers some. But it will want something in return, like help getting more oil priced in its own currency, the yuan. A global stock offering would do more to open up financial channels that Crown Prince Mohammed bin-Salman can tap to finance his grand diversification of Saudi's economy away from the black stuff. At $100 billion, it would also divert liquidity from regional rivals like Iran that also hope to attract global capital."
Sinopec Group,2017-10,"Perhaps the best case for listing Aramco internationally is to improve discipline at the company itself. China shows that can work. The country's state-owned enterprises, including both the oil companies now offering to buy Aramco equity, put their affairs in better order than they would otherwise have been to court global capitalists. But a Chinese investor is unlikely to demand as much transparency as a global pension fund or a Western private equity investor."
Sinopec Group,2017-10,"- China has offered to buy 5 percent of Saudi Aramco directly, as plans for an international listing are pushed back from an original 2018 target, sources told Reuters."
Sinopec Group,2017-10,"- Aramco, the state oil producer of Saudi Arabia, is considering a dual listing on its home market and another, as yet undecided exchange, with New York, London and Asian markets competing for the offering."
Sinopec Group,2017-10,"- The would-be buyers of the stake include Chinese oil producers PetroChina and Sinopec, as well as China's sovereign wealth fund, Reuters reported."
Sinopec Group,2017-10,"- Crown Prince Mohammed bin-Salman has given Aramco a putative valuation of $2 trillion, suggesting a listing of a 5 percent stake would raise $100 billion."
Sinopec Group,2017-10,"- The Crown Prince is behind a plan called ""Vision 2030"" that seeks to transform Saudi's economy through support for small businesses, privatisation, the creation of a huge sovereign wealth fund and diversification away from oil revenue dependence."

Sinopec Group,2017-10,* Millions of homes to be heated by gas for first time
Sinopec Group,2017-10,"BEIJING, Oct 19 (Reuters) - China has ordered state oil companies to speed up the construction of pipelines to move natural gas to homes and factories, underscoring worries that the country's insufficient infrastructure could cause power outages during the peak winter demand period."
Sinopec Group,2017-10,"This winter, millions of homes across the colder northern regions of the world's second-largest economy will be heated for the first time by gas rather than coal, as part of Beijing's effort to boost clean fuel use."
Sinopec Group,2017-10,"But with just a month before newly installed radiators get switched on, the National Development & Reform Commission (NDRC) warned on Thursday that supply and demand conditions could be ""serious"" this winter."
Sinopec Group,2017-10,"The alert shows Beijing is trying to head off supply disruptions during the peak demand period from November until March. Residential users with their radiators will have supply priority over industrial users, increasing the possibility of power losses during gas shortages."
Sinopec Group,2017-10,"""We are all quite concerned with supply shortages this winter ... as we may not have the infrastructure capacity to catch up with the demand growth,"" said Li Wei, a vice president of Kunlun Energy <0135.HK>, which operates liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals and gas production plants."
Sinopec Group,2017-10,"Wood Mackenzie estimates the heating needs alone will add 10 billion cubic metres (bcm) to China's gas demand, the equivalent of Vietnam's annual consumption. The country is expected to use about 230 bcm this year. [nL4N1L505H]"
Sinopec Group,2017-10,Small industrial users like hospitals have also had to switch to gas this winter.
Sinopec Group,2017-10,"China will either need to ramp up imports, offering a boon for major exporters like Russia, or big industrial consumers may get interrupted, warned Kerry Anne Shanks, head of Asia gas and LNG research at consultants Wood Mackenzie.[nL4N1MO1MM] [nL2N1MN0A5]"
Sinopec Group,2017-10,"""This depends on weather. (But) we worry that China doesn't have enough storage,"" she said."
Sinopec Group,2017-10,"China has only 8 bcm of gas storage capacity, or about 4 percent of its demand. That is much lower than other gas-using regions like the United States and Europe, which typically store about 15 percent to 25 percent of their annual needs, she said."
Sinopec Group,2017-10,Winter weather will be the main factor for demand and forecast models are not yet clear.
Sinopec Group,2017-10,"While long-range forecasts point to a slightly warmer-than-average winter in the major cities of Beijing and Shanghai, the forecasts show that conditions until December are likely to be unusually cold."
Sinopec Group,2017-10,"Colder weather later in the season would be more challenging because it is harder to pull gas from storage when the tanks are emptier, Shanks said."
Sinopec Group,2017-10,"Specifically, the NDRC said on Thursday that Sinopec and PetroChina <601857.SS> should be injecting gas into their storage facilities ahead of the peak demand season. Their facilities should be running at full capacity."
Sinopec Group,2017-10,The government also called on Sinopec to speed up the construction of four pipeline projects: a Tianjin to Beijing pipeline; a Qingdao to Nanjing project; an Inner Mongolia to Hebei development and one from Xinjiang to other regions.
Sinopec Group,2017-10,It has also urged top pipeline operator China National Petroleum Corp [CNPET.UL] <601857.SS> to complete the fourth leg of its Shaanxi to Beijing line by the end of October. [nL3N1H03UP]
Sinopec Group,2017-10,"China expects that gas demand will rise to between 320 and 360 bcm per year by 2020, meaning more long-term infrastructure investment is needed."
Sinopec Group,2017-10,"The increase is the equivalent of the annual consumption of Japan, Asia's second-largest gas consumer after China."

Sinopec Group,2017-10,"To handle the new oil business, Shanghai-based CEFC, established just 15 years ago, is expanding its trading team, including in Singapore, Asia's oil trading hub."

Sinopec Group,2017-10,"DUBAI/LONDON, Oct 16 (Reuters) - China is offering to buy up to 5 percent of Saudi Aramco directly, sources said, a move that could give Saudi Arabia the flexibility to consider various options for its plan to float the world's biggest oil producer on the stock market."
Sinopec Group,2017-10,"Chinese state-owned oil companies PetroChina <0857.HK> and Sinopec <0386.HK> have written to Saudi Aramco in recent weeks to express an interest in a direct deal, industry sources told Reuters. The companies are part of a state-run consortium including China's sovereign wealth fund, the sources say."
Sinopec Group,2017-10,"Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said last year the kingdom was considering listing about 5 percent of Aramco in 2018 in a deal that could raise $100 billion, if the company is valued at about $2 trillion as hoped."

Sinopec Group,2017-10,The initial public offering (IPO) of Saudi Aramco is the centrepiece of an economic reform plan to diversify the Saudi economy beyond oil and it would also provide a welcome boost to the kingdom's budget which has been hit by low oil prices.

Sinopec Group,2017-10,"""A range of options, for the public listing of Saudi Aramco, continue to be held under active review. No decision has been made and the IPO process remains on track,"" said a Saudi Aramco spokesman."
Sinopec Group,2017-10,Industry sources said the sale of a significant stake to Chinese firms was one of several options being considered by the kingdom as it weighs the benefits of a public listing.
Sinopec Group,2017-10,"One option includes selling some stock immediately to so-called cornerstone investors, such as China, and then selling shares on the local bourse as well as an international stock exchange, with New York, London and Hong Kong in the running."

The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.)
Sinopec Group,2017-10,"LONDON, Oct 16 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Saudi Aramco's initial public offering is a nice-to-have, easily mistaken for a must-have. A consortium of Chinese companies including oil producers PetroChina <601857.SS> and Sinopec <600028.SS> has offered to buy 5 percent of the company directly, sources told Reuters, as its international listing hangs in the balance. The benefits for Saudi Arabia of an Aramco IPO, though, are not to be found in Beijing."
Sinopec Group,2017-10,"As for influence, China offers some. But it will want something in return, like help getting more oil priced in its own currency, the yuan. A global stock offering would do more to open up financial channels that Crown Prince Mohammed bin-Salman can tap to finance his grand diversification of Saudi's economy away from the black stuff. At $100 billion, it would also divert liquidity from regional rivals like Iran that also hope to attract global capital."
Sinopec Group,2017-10,"Perhaps the best case for listing Aramco internationally is to improve discipline at the company itself. China shows that can work. The country's state-owned enterprises, including both the oil companies now offering to buy Aramco equity, put their affairs in better order than they would otherwise have been to court global capitalists. But a Chinese investor is unlikely to demand as much transparency as a global pension fund or a Western private equity investor."
Sinopec Group,2017-10,"- China has offered to buy 5 percent of Saudi Aramco directly, as plans for an international listing are pushed back from an original 2018 target, sources told Reuters."
Sinopec Group,2017-10,"- Aramco, the state oil producer of Saudi Arabia, is considering a dual listing on its home market and another, as yet undecided exchange, with New York, London and Asian markets competing for the offering."
Sinopec Group,2017-10,"- The would-be buyers of the stake include Chinese oil producers PetroChina and Sinopec, as well as China's sovereign wealth fund, Reuters reported."
Sinopec Group,2017-10,"- Crown Prince Mohammed bin-Salman has given Aramco a putative valuation of $2 trillion, suggesting a listing of a 5 percent stake would raise $100 billion."
Sinopec Group,2017-10,"- The Crown Prince is behind a plan called ""Vision 2030"" that seeks to transform Saudi's economy through support for small businesses, privatisation, the creation of a huge sovereign wealth fund and diversification away from oil revenue dependence."

Sinopec Group,2017-10,"LONDON, Oct 6 (Reuters) - Commodities trader and miner Glencore has swooped in to replace China's Sinopec as the buyer of Chevron's South African and Botswana assets after reaching a deal with local investors."
Sinopec Group,2017-10,"The assets include a 100,000 barrel-per-day oil refinery in Cape Town, a lubricants plant in Durban as well as 820 petrol stations and other oil storage facilities. It also includes 220 convenience stores across South Africa and Botswana."
Sinopec Group,2017-10,"In its statement on Friday, Glencore said it had agreed to buy Chevron's 75 percent stake in its South African subsidiary and its Botswana interests for a combined $973 million. The remaining 25 percent stake will stay with a consortium of Black Economic Empowerment shareholders and an employee trust."
Sinopec Group,2017-10,An industry source familiar with Glencore's mergers and acquisitions activities said the company was looking to bring in a partner.
Sinopec Group,2017-10,A spokesman for Chevron said the company does not comment on commercial matters. Sinopec did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Sinopec Group,2017-10,Glencore stepped in after local shareholders exercised pre-emption rights following delays to the Sinopec deal.
Sinopec Group,2017-10,"In March, Chevron announced that it had agreed the sale of its assets to China's largest refiner Sinopec <600028.SS>, <0386.HK> for nearly $1 billion. As of May, the deal had been under review by South Africa's Economic Development ministry. [nL3N1GZ3PH][nL8N1IR3QG]"
Sinopec Group,2017-10,Glencore was among the bidders for the stake last year along with oil major Total and rival trading house Gunvor. [nL8N1CU16Z]
Sinopec Group,2017-10,The stake was of keen interest to many oil traders as the retail network is one of the biggest in South Africa and it provides access to strategic storage in Saldanha Bay on the southwestern coast.
Sinopec Group,2017-10,Chevron along with other oil majors have announced a flurry of downstream sales in the last few years to trim costs after global oil prices slumped in 2014.

Sinopec Group,2017-10,Glencore has shifted in the last year from shedding interests during the 2015-2016 commodities downturn to asset-buying since the rebound in prices. [nL5N1KM2XJ]
Sinopec Group,2017-10,"The deal, which will include Glencore retaining Chevron's local management team and workforce, will be funded using existing cash resources and is expected to close in mid-2018."

Sinopec Group,2017-10,"If the deal closes, this would be Glencore's first refining asset. It began expanding into downstream oil in May after setting up a retail franchise in Mexico. [nL8N1IK1R8]"
