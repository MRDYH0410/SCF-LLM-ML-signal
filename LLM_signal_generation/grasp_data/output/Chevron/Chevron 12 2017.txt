Chevron,2017-12,"NEW YORK, Dec 22 (Reuters) - Colonial Pipeline Co, the largest U.S. fuel network, defended the fees it charges to ship gasoline, diesel and jet fuel, saying on Friday a formal complaint by some of its biggest customers was based on ""purposefully manipulated"" financial data."
Chevron,2017-12,"In a November complaint filed with the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), affiliates of Chevron, Valero and Delta Air Lines said Colonial's rates were excessive and unreasonable, and accused it of effectively monopolizing the New York market.[nL1N1O81I4]"
Chevron,2017-12,"The complaint alleged that Colonial's opaque fee structure pushed its 2016 interstate revenue to exceed its costs by $339.3 million, earning it about a 29 percent realized return on equity, an increase of about 44 percent from 1991."
Chevron,2017-12,"In a filing to FERC, Colonial said that figure is inaccurate, and there is only a difference of 2.5 percent between Colonial's costs and revenues, a figure well below the level U.S. regulators have found to warrant further investigation."
Chevron,2017-12,"It said contrary to FERC regulations, Chevron, Valero and Delta's trading arms excluded non-recurring costs in their calculations, such as those incurred after outages due to a leak and an explosion in 2016."
Chevron,2017-12,"Without such adjustments, the rate of return on equity fell by 18 percent, Colonial said, rather than rising 44 percent."
Chevron,2017-12,"In their complaint, the three companies argue that Colonial overcharged them by more than $60 million combined and is potentially monopolizing fuel delivery into the New York region, the largest demand hub in the United States."
Chevron,2017-12,"If FERC holds a hearing and rates are ultimately lowered, it could be the most significant change to Colonial's rate structure in nearly 20 years."
Chevron,2017-12,"The pipeline hauls more than 3 million barrels of gasoline, diesel and jet fuel from the refinery hub in the Gulf Coast to centers in the northeast every day. Even with the current fees, it remains the cheapest and most efficient way to haul fuel across the country to those markets."
Chevron,2017-12,"Colonial was allowed to charge market-based rates in 2001 to deliver fuel into the New York area, on the understanding that it did not posses monopoly power over those markets."
Chevron,2017-12,The complaint alleges Colonial's rates have not been reviewed in recent years and warrant investigation in part due to the changes in market conditions.
Chevron,2017-12,"Colonial said on Friday that a 2015 FERC audit, which covered a period from 2011 to 2014, showed no findings related to its grandfathered rates, indexed rates or market-based rates."
Chevron,2017-12,"Colonial currently charges about $2.20 a barrel to ship fuel from Houston, Texas to the New York area."
Chevron,2017-12,"""The complainants knowingly and purposefully manipulated and cherry-picked data from various different public filings over a course of several years to mix and match numbers to make their case,"" Colonial said in a statement. ""That's not how this process works."""
Chevron,2017-12,"U.S. refiner Phillips 66 , another shipper on Colonial Pipeline, filed a request to intervene in the proceeding last week. Others including Flint Hills Resources LP, Castleton Commodities, TransMontaigne Partners LP, Marathon Petroleum and World Fuel Services filed motions to intervene this week."
Chevron,2017-12,"""At this time, we are not taking a position and we do not plan on submitting comments unless specific questions arise concerning our interests that warrant a response,"" Flint Hills spokesman Jake Reint said in an emailed statement."
Chevron,2017-12,It was not immediately clear whether the other companies would be for or against Colonial Pipeline.

Chevron,2017-12,"RIO DE JANEIRO, Dec 14 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp has reached preliminary agreement with oil services firm Schlumberger NV to drill six wells in a Brazilian offshore field, two sources said this week, in a bid to lift its output in the South American country after a 2011 oil spill there cut production."
Chevron,2017-12,"Six wells would be drilled in the Frade field in Brazil's offshore Campos basin, and work should begin in early 2019, the sources said. Drilling for the contract, worth about $20 million would be spread over 18 to 24 months, one of the people familiar with the matter said."
Chevron,2017-12,One of the sources spoke on Thursday and the other on Wednesday. Both declined to be named since the agreement was not public or final.
Chevron,2017-12,"The proposed price tag does not include well completion or drilling fluids needed for the project, the sources said. The agreement, which awaits approval by Chevron's board, covers drilling, drill bits, cementing and well data collection, they said."
Chevron,2017-12,Chevron spokeswoman Isabel Ordonez declined to comment. Schlumberger spokesman Joao Felix also declined to comment.
Chevron,2017-12,"If approved, the project would mark a much-anticipated expansion of exploration for Chevron in Latin America's top oil producing nation, where its output has slumped to 12,500 barrels per day (bpd) from 36,400 bpd before the 2011 accident."
Chevron,2017-12,"The spill, which released 2,400 barrels into the ocean some 107 kilometers (73 miles) off the coast of Rio de Janeiro state, did not reach the shore and was smaller than several previous spills in Brazil by state-controlled oil firm Petroleo Brasileiro SA ."
Chevron,2017-12,"But coming on the heels of BP Plc's 4.9 million-barrel U.S. Gulf of Mexico spill, the accident drew widespread attention and led prosecutors to bring criminal charges against the company and 11 employees, as well as to seek $10.7 billion in damages through a civil lawsuit."
Chevron,2017-12,"According to a 2013 filing, Chevron settled the civil charges by promising to spend $43 million on social and environmental programs. The criminal charges were dismissed in 2015, but prosecutors have sought to reinstate the case by appealing the decision, Chevron has said."

Chevron,2017-12,(Updates with INEOS saying outage could last up to 4 weeks)
Chevron,2017-12,"LONDON, Dec 12 (Reuters) - Britain's biggest pipeline from its North Sea oil and gas fields is likely to be shut for several weeks for repairs, its operator said on Tuesday, disrupting gas flows and sending international crude prices to their highest since mid-2015."
Chevron,2017-12,"The closure has struck during a winter freeze in Britain, where snow and ice have driven up demand for heating fuel just as gas flows through the network, which carries a third of Britain's gas produced offshore, were disrupted."
Chevron,2017-12,"""We are working to get the pipeline restored to full operation as quickly as we can safely do so... We have previously indicated a time frame of three to four weeks and we believe it is no less than two,"" operator INEOS said in a email to customers seen by Reuters."
Chevron,2017-12,"The pipeline, which carries about 450,000 barrels per day (bpd) of Forties crude, was shut after cracks were found."
Chevron,2017-12,"It has particular significance to global markets because Forties is the largest out of the five crude oil streams that underpin the dated Brent benchmark, against which other crude prices are broadly based. Benchmark Brent crude prices rose above $65 per barrel for the first time since the middle of 2015 following the closure on Monday. [O/R]"
Chevron,2017-12,INEOS only completed the purchase of the Forties pipeline system from oil major BP in October. A minor leak had caused a partial shutdown on Dec. 7 and a full shutdown on Monday. INEOS said the small crack has not increased over the past 24 hours.
Chevron,2017-12,"Paul Wheelhouse, the Scottish energy minister, said there were no plans to shut the 200,000 bpd Grangemouth refinery, which uses Forties crude. [nL9N1NR00L]"
Chevron,2017-12,"""If it's a lengthy outage, then a recovery period for the fields will be long as well,"" the trading source said."
Chevron,2017-12,"A number of producers including BP , Shell and Chrysaor, said they had closed down oil fields in response."
Chevron,2017-12,"The largest contributor to the Forties stream, the 180,000-bpd Buzzard oil field run by Nexen Petroleum UK Ltd, a subsidiary of China's CNOOC <0883.HK>, had also closed, two trading sources said. [CRU/OUT]"
Chevron,2017-12,"Monthly loading programmes show the supply of Forties is expected to reach 21 cargoes of 600,000 barrels each this month, equal to a daily supply rate of 406,000 bpd. [nL9N1AF03S]"
Chevron,2017-12,"The closure has created havoc with loading schedules in the North Sea, with one trading source saying cargo owners had been offered options to drop cargoes from the loading programme."
Chevron,2017-12,"""At this point we would expect a large deferral list for the Forties loading programme to spill over into January,"" analysts from JBC Energy said in a note."
Chevron,2017-12,"""The timing of the outage could not be much worse as winter weather is just materialising,"" Jefferies bank analysts wrote."
Chevron,2017-12,"Jefferies estimated the closure resulted in production loss for BP of 105,000 bpd, for Total of 55,000 bpd, for Chevron of 45,000 bpd, for Exxon Mobil of 40,000, for Eni of 25,000 bpd, for Shell of 25,000 bpd, for ConocoPhillips of 15,000 bpd."

Chevron,2017-12,(Updates with INEOS saying outage could last up to 4 weeks)
Chevron,2017-12,"LONDON, Dec 12 (Reuters) - Britain's biggest pipeline from its North Sea oil and gas fields is likely to be shut for several weeks for repairs, its operator said on Tuesday, disrupting gas flows and sending international crude prices to their highest since mid-2015."
Chevron,2017-12,"The closure has struck during a winter freeze in Britain, where snow and ice have driven up demand for heating fuel just as gas flows through the network, which carries a third of Britain's gas produced offshore, were disrupted."
Chevron,2017-12,"""We are working to get the pipeline restored to full operation as quickly as we can safely do so... We have previously indicated a time frame of three to four weeks and we believe it is no less than two,"" operator INEOS said in a email to customers seen by Reuters."
Chevron,2017-12,"The pipeline, which carries about 450,000 barrels per day (bpd) of Forties crude, was shut after cracks were found."
Chevron,2017-12,"It has particular significance to global markets because Forties is the largest out of the five crude oil streams that underpin the dated Brent benchmark, against which other crude prices are broadly based. Benchmark Brent crude prices rose above $65 per barrel for the first time since the middle of 2015 following the closure on Monday. [O/R]"
Chevron,2017-12,INEOS only completed the purchase of the Forties pipeline system from oil major BP in October. A minor leak had caused a partial shutdown on Dec. 7 and a full shutdown on Monday. INEOS said the small crack has not increased over the past 24 hours.

Chevron,2017-12,"The largest contributor to the Forties stream, the 180,000-bpd Buzzard oil field run by Nexen Petroleum UK Ltd, a subsidiary of China's CNOOC <0883.HK>, had also closed, two trading sources said. [CRU/OUT]"

Chevron,2017-12,"NEW YORK, Dec 8 (Reuters) - Oil major Chevron, leading refiner Valero and Delta Air Lines have complained to the U.S. energy watchdog about fees Colonial Pipeline charges to ship gasoline, diesel and jet fuel over its fuel network, the country's largest."
Chevron,2017-12,"The 917-page complaint, filed last month with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), says Colonial's fees ""greatly exceed just and reasonable levels"". It alleges Colonial overcharged the companies by more than $60 million combined, and is potentially monopolizing fuel delivery into the New York region."
Chevron,2017-12,"The complaint could lead to the first regulatory reexamination of Colonial Pipeline's rates in nearly 20 years, at a time when the line's importance for delivering refined products to the Northeast and Southeast United States has come into sharp focus. Colonial says the complaint has no merit, and a legal expert said it may be hard for the shippers to prove their case."
Chevron,2017-12,"Even with the current fees, the 3 million-barrel-per-day Colonial system is the cheapest and most efficient way to move barrels from the Gulf Coast to the East Coast. Over the past two years, a series of outages, including shutdown of parts of the line in wake of Hurricane Harvey, drove up pump prices and created fears of gasoline shortages across numerous states."
Chevron,2017-12,"Spokeswoman Malesia Dunn said Colonial Pipeline believes the shippers manipulated data ""and made improper and highly unrealistic assumptions in an effort to strengthen their arguments."""
Chevron,2017-12,"The complaint was filed on Nov. 22 by Chevron Products Co, Valero Marketing & Supply Co and Epsilon Trading LLC, the trading arm of Delta. The companies did not elaborate on the dispute to Reuters."
Chevron,2017-12,"Colonial shippers have often complained that the company has tried to squeeze access and limit competition for space on its congested line. One shipper sued Colonial this year in federal court in New Jersey, alleging it is blending gasoline from its customers without authorization, and profiting from that. The company has answered the complaint, denying the charges."
Chevron,2017-12,"""We have a diverse shipper base, with nearly 300 shippers,"" said Dunn. ""We aim to provide value and the best offerings for a majority of shippers. We can't customize for every shipper."""
Chevron,2017-12,"Other companies, such as Murphy Oil, Vitol and Flint Resources LP have lodged complaints with FERC against Colonial in the past two years, but the latest action represents the largest threat to the operator's current rate structure."
Chevron,2017-12,"""I expect given the importance of the line, the resources of the parties bringing the complaint and the number of shippers that use the line, this case will be heavily litigated and is very serious,"" said Tony Clark, a senior advisor at Wilkinson, Barker Knauer LLP and a FERC Commissioner from 2012 until 2016."
Chevron,2017-12,"The companies say in the complaint that they were collectively overcharged by about $64.1 million between Oct. 1, 2015 and Sept. 30, 2017. They say Colonial's exorbitant and opaque fee structure pushed its 2016 interstate revenue to exceed its costs by $339.3 million, earning it about a 29 percent realized return on equity."
Chevron,2017-12,"The companies said they used adjustments that accounted for, among other things, the cost of two pipeline outages in 2016 to arrive at that figure."
Chevron,2017-12,"""The Commission has previously held that an apparent over-recovery of this magnitude...is more than sufficient to warrant setting for hearing a complaint against the pipeline rates,"" the complaint says."
Chevron,2017-12,"Interstate pipelines are allowed to recover operating costs by charging shippers to use the line, but are prohibited from ""over-recovery."""
Chevron,2017-12,"The U.S. Congress set Colonial's rates in 1990s-era legislation. In 2001, FERC allowed Colonial to charge market-based rates from the Gulf Coast to the Philadelphia and New York areas, on the understanding that Colonial lacked monopoly power over those markets. For other delivery points, such as Alabama and Georgia, Colonial rates are not market-based."
Chevron,2017-12,"Colonial's market power raises serious concerns over whether its rates remain ""just and reasonable,"" the complaint says. It says the market-based rate structure has not undergone scrutiny for years, while economic conditions have changed enough to warrant a review."
Chevron,2017-12,"It may be hard for shippers to convince FERC that market-based rates are excessive, said FERC litigation partner Joseph Fagan, at Day Pitney LLP."
Chevron,2017-12,"""Simply saying that they are charging rates that are very high and therefore they must have market power, that doesn't get you there ... Frustration does not a valid complaint make,"" he said."

Chevron,2017-12,"NEW YORK, Dec 8 (Reuters) - Oil major Chevron, leading refiner Valero and Delta Air Lines have complained to the U.S. energy watchdog about fees Colonial Pipeline charges to ship gasoline, diesel and jet fuel over its fuel network, the country's largest."
Chevron,2017-12,"The 917-page complaint, filed last month with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), says Colonial's fees ""greatly exceed just and reasonable levels"". It alleges Colonial overcharged the companies by more than $60 million combined, and is potentially monopolizing fuel delivery into the New York region."
Chevron,2017-12,"The complaint could lead to the first regulatory reexamination of Colonial Pipeline's rates in nearly 20 years, at a time when the line's importance for delivering refined products to the Northeast and Southeast United States has come into sharp focus. Colonial says the complaint has no merit, and a legal expert said it may be hard for the shippers to prove their case."
Chevron,2017-12,"Even with the current fees, the 3 million-barrel-per-day Colonial system is the cheapest and most efficient way to move barrels from the Gulf Coast to the East Coast. Over the past two years, a series of outages, including shutdown of parts of the line in wake of Hurricane Harvey, drove up pump prices and created fears of gasoline shortages across numerous states."
Chevron,2017-12,"Spokeswoman Malesia Dunn said Colonial Pipeline believes the shippers manipulated data ""and made improper and highly unrealistic assumptions in an effort to strengthen their arguments."""
Chevron,2017-12,"The complaint was filed on Nov. 22 by Chevron Products Co, Valero Marketing & Supply Co and Epsilon Trading LLC, the trading arm of Delta. The companies did not elaborate on the dispute to Reuters."
Chevron,2017-12,"Colonial shippers have often complained that the company has tried to squeeze access and limit competition for space on its congested line. One shipper sued Colonial this year in federal court in New Jersey, alleging it is blending gasoline from its customers without authorization, and profiting from that. The company has answered the complaint, denying the charges."
Chevron,2017-12,"""We have a diverse shipper base, with nearly 300 shippers,"" said Dunn. ""We aim to provide value and the best offerings for a majority of shippers. We can't customize for every shipper."""
Chevron,2017-12,"Other companies, such as Murphy Oil, Vitol and Flint Resources LP have lodged complaints with FERC against Colonial in the past two years, but the latest action represents the largest threat to the operator's current rate structure."
Chevron,2017-12,"""I expect given the importance of the line, the resources of the parties bringing the complaint and the number of shippers that use the line, this case will be heavily litigated and is very serious,"" said Tony Clark, a senior advisor at Wilkinson, Barker Knauer LLP and a FERC Commissioner from 2012 until 2016."
Chevron,2017-12,"The companies say in the complaint that they were collectively overcharged by about $64.1 million between Oct. 1, 2015 and Sept. 30, 2017. They say Colonial's exorbitant and opaque fee structure pushed its 2016 interstate revenue to exceed its costs by $339.3 million, earning it about a 29 percent realized return on equity."
Chevron,2017-12,"The companies said they used adjustments that accounted for, among other things, the cost of two pipeline outages in 2016 to arrive at that figure."
Chevron,2017-12,"""The Commission has previously held that an apparent over-recovery of this magnitude...is more than sufficient to warrant setting for hearing a complaint against the pipeline rates,"" the complaint says."
Chevron,2017-12,"Interstate pipelines are allowed to recover operating costs by charging shippers to use the line, but are prohibited from ""over-recovery."""
Chevron,2017-12,"The U.S. Congress set Colonial's rates in 1990s-era legislation. In 2001, FERC allowed Colonial to charge market-based rates from the Gulf Coast to the Philadelphia and New York areas, on the understanding that Colonial lacked monopoly power over those markets. For other delivery points, such as Alabama and Georgia, Colonial rates are not market-based."
Chevron,2017-12,"Colonial's market power raises serious concerns over whether its rates remain ""just and reasonable,"" the complaint says. It says the market-based rate structure has not undergone scrutiny for years, while economic conditions have changed enough to warrant a review."
Chevron,2017-12,"It may be hard for shippers to convince FERC that market-based rates are excessive, said FERC litigation partner Joseph Fagan, at Day Pitney LLP."

Chevron,2017-12,"State-run oil company PDVSA [PDVSA.UL] and its joint ventures sent 475,165 barrels per day to its customers in the United States last month, down 36 percent from a year earlier and 12 percent from October."
