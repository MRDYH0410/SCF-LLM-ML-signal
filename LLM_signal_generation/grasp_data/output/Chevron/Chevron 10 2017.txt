Chevron,2017-10,"HOUSTON, Oct 27 (Reuters) - Rising oil and natural gas prices boosted third-quarter profits at Exxon Mobil Corp and Chevron Corp by about 50 percent, underscoring how reliant they remain on commodity markets for their financial futures than better technology or cost cuts."
Chevron,2017-10,"Despite deep capital spending cuts and a refocusing on projects that can generate faster paybacks in recent years, the results on Friday showed the pair, neither of whom hedge oil output, are still at the mercy of price gyrations."
Chevron,2017-10,"Exxon and Chevron have pointed to aggressive plans for boosting low-cost U.S. shale production. But in recent quarters total output at both has atrophied and shale is unlikely to deliver a marked lift until the next decade, based on corporate projections."
Chevron,2017-10,"""Both are trying to be disciplined and show growth,"" said Brian Youngberg, an oil industry analyst with Edward Jones. ""But it's a little bit of a transition, especially as they're trying to increase shale (output)."""
Chevron,2017-10,The pair reported the same day as French rival Total SA posted a 29 percent jump in its third-quarter net profit as project ramp-ups and new investments lifted production. [nL8N1N21J2]
Chevron,2017-10,"Exxon, which reported a better-than-expected quarterly, said its Permian oil production will grow 45 percent each year through 2020, to more than 400,000 barrels per day. The company also has a large shale position in North Dakota's Bakken shale formation. [nL2N1N20K7]"
Chevron,2017-10,"Still, Exxon said higher prices contributed $860 million to its earnings while volume increases added only $20 million to the latest quarter's exploration profit. Exxon's total output in the quarter was the lowest this year."
Chevron,2017-10,"Also on Friday Exxon, part of a consortium with Norway's Statoil and Portugal's Petrogal, a unit of Galp Energia , won one of four blocks in Brazil's coveted pre-salt oil region in an auction. [nL2N1N20CJ]"
Chevron,2017-10,"At Chevron, a writedown of its Bangladesh operations and a drop in U.S. production weighed on results, which missed Wall Street estimates by a wide margin. [nL2N1N20NT]"
Chevron,2017-10,"Chevron's stock slid 4.5 percent to $113.15, a drop that surprised Chief Executive Officer John Watson, he said during an investors conference call."
Chevron,2017-10,"The San Ramon, California, company, which has been one of the Permian's largest acreage holders since the 1930s, has only recently begun to aggressively develop its oil reserves there. Watson told Reuters earlier this year the Permian is ""very important"" in the company's portfolio. [nL2N1HC1IA]"
Chevron,2017-10,"While the company has yet to forecast 2018 production goals for the Permian, Watson said on Friday that Chevron will grow aggressively in the region."
Chevron,2017-10,"Chevron's overall average daily output was up 8 percent over a year ago, but that was largely due to the start of giant natural-gas projects. U.S. oil production at Chevron fell overall, as aging field output offset a jump in Permian production."
Chevron,2017-10,The loss in U.S. oil production narrowed sharply as the price received for its crude rose 13.5 percent over a year earlier.

Chevron,2017-10,"Rising prices helped: Exxon sold oil at roughly $6.50 a barrel more than the same quarter last year. But it is also expanding in the profitable West Texas Permian basin, in part through acquisitions. It now has 20 rigs in the region and plans to add another 10 in the next year. And it purchased deep-water assets in Brazil on Friday, adding to some it bought last month."
Chevron,2017-10,"Chevron keeps flexing its muscles in Texas, which helped contribute to a big boost to profit over the past nine months. Outgoing Chief Executive John Watson expects production to rise as much as 8 percent worldwide, excluding asset sales. Two flagship liquefied natural gas projects in Australia are finally online after years of development, too."
Chevron,2017-10,"Companies are cautious about the future, however. Exxon seems wary about doing a big deal in Texas unless the company can find enough synergies to justify the price. ConocoPhillips, which reported earnings on Thursday, is cutting spending by a tenth. Chevron's Watson reckons costs next year should stay under control as investments in short-cycle shale projects are already well funded. He appears to be more focused on cash flow than big growth plans."
Chevron,2017-10,"Longer term, though, oil companies face a dilemma between increasing drilling and making money. Exxon illustrates this well. The company is planning a near-fourfold increase in U.S. production by 2025. Some of that may come from acquiring drillers that already produce oil. But Exxon also has plenty of untapped land to develop, which will add more oil to the market."
Chevron,2017-10,"- Exxon Mobil on Oct. 27 reported third-quarter net income of $3.97 billion, compared with $2.7 billion in the same period last year. At 93 cents a share, earnings beat the consensus estimate of sell-side analysts of 86 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The impact of Hurricane Harvey reduced earnings by 4 cents a share."
Chevron,2017-10,- Exxon's production rose 2 percent to 3.9 million barrels of oil equivalent a day.
Chevron,2017-10,"- On the same day, Chevron reported third-quarter net income of $1.95 billion, or $1.03 per share, compared with $1.28 billion in the three months to the end of September last year. Earnings were $1.03 a share, but fell to 85 cents a share after excluding one-off items. The consensus estimate of sell-side analysts was for 98 cents a share."
Chevron,2017-10,- Production rose 8 percent to 2.7 million barrels of oil equivalent per day.
Chevron,2017-10,"- ConocoPhillips said on Oct. 26 that it planned to exceed its original oil-production estimate despite cutting its capital budget by 10 percent. The largest independent oil producer reported better-than-expected profit of 34 cents a share compared to a loss of 84 cents a share a year ago. Excluding one-time items, Conoco earned 16 cents a share. By that measure, analysts expected earnings of 8 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S."

Chevron,2017-10,"LONDON, Oct 27 (Reuters) - A $1 billion fund created by top energy companies to curb climate change announced its first three investments on Friday and said two new members could be poised join the scheme."
Chevron,2017-10,The Oil and Gas Climate Initiative (OGCI) was set up last year and includes Saudi Aramco and Royal Dutch Shell .
Chevron,2017-10,"Pratima Rangarajan, OGCI chief executive, said she expected more companies to join and that Brazil's Petrobras and Abu Dhabi National Oil Co (ADNOC) were among those interested."
Chevron,2017-10,"""They are potentially joining and were observing today,"" she said in an interview with Reuters."
Chevron,2017-10,"Other participants include BP , Total , Eni , Repsol , Statoil , CNPC, Pemex [PEMX.UL] and Reliance Industries ."
Chevron,2017-10,"Together, the 10 firms produce around 20 percent of the world's oil and gas and last year pledged to invest $1 billion over 10 years on technologies to curb climate change.[nL8N1D52Q7]"
Chevron,2017-10,Rangarajan said new members would be expected to pledge a further $100 million each.
Chevron,2017-10,"In the first investments, U.S. firm Solidia Technologies will receive funding for making cement with carbon dioxide instead of water, potentially lowering emissions by 70 percent and water use by 80 percent, the OGCI said."
Chevron,2017-10,"It will also help U.S.-based Achates Power, which develops vehicle engines that produce fewer greenhouse gas emissions, to roll out its technology worldwide."
Chevron,2017-10,"Neither of the U.S. oil majors, Exxon or Chevron , are a part of the initiative. Rangarajan said the location of its members was not a factor in deciding where investments would be made."
Chevron,2017-10,"""We have to be open to looking anywhere in the world for the best ideas,"" she said."
Chevron,2017-10,"The OGCI also plans to help design a full-scale gas power plant with carbon capture and storage technology (CCS), although it did not specify where the project would be built, or how much funding would be allocated."
Chevron,2017-10,"The International Energy Association (IEA) said CCS technology is vital if the target to limit a global rise in temperatures to 2 degrees Celsius, as set out in the Paris climate agreement, is to be met."

Chevron,2017-10,"CARACAS, Oct 26 (Reuters) - A top executive at Venezuela's PDVSA [PDVSA.UL] and 10 other oil executives were arrested as part of growing graft investigations that are ridding the state energy company of much of its top brass, the OPEC member's state prosecutor said on Thursday."
Chevron,2017-10,"Orlando Chacin, who led the subsidiary for joint ventures with foreign partners, was arrested at PDVSA's Caracas headquarters on Tuesday, sources told Reuters on Thursday. He was the right-hand man of the company's former president, Eulogio Del Pino, who is now the nation's oil minister. [nL2N1N116U]"
Chevron,2017-10,"Ten other executives were arrested, including at the Petropiar and Petrozamora joint ventures with U.S. major Chevron Corp and Russia's Gazprombank, respectively, for alleged wrongdoing including overpricing and non-execution of planned projects, prosecutor Tarek Saab said in a press conference."
Chevron,2017-10,"President Nicolas Maduro's socialist government and PDVSA, which is formally known as Petroleos de Venezuela SA, have repeatedly vowed to take steps to combat corruption, which has affected the nation and its oil industry for decades. [nL2N1H61B7]"
Chevron,2017-10,Opposition leaders say PDVSA has been crippled by malfeasance under 18 years of socialist rule. They say sporadic arrests are the result of infighting among rival government factions.
Chevron,2017-10,"Sources close to PDVSA say the arrests owe more to turf wars for control of the company, which is the financial motor of Venezuela's ailing economy, than a wholesale effort to clean up graft. [nL1N1KT1ER]"
Chevron,2017-10,"The cash-strapped company, whose oil production has tumbled close to three-decade lows, has recently undergone a leadership change, with veteran oil executive Nelson Martinez replacing Del Pino in August."
Chevron,2017-10,"Other once-prominent PDVSA executives under Del Pino have since been detained, including Pedro Leon, a powerful executive who led the company's Orinoco Belt development, and Gustavo Malave, the company's boss for the western region."
Chevron,2017-10,"Saab, who in August replaced a dissident prosecutor who had split with Maduro, told Reuters last month he expected further arrests in widening oil-sector bribery scandals. The opposition dismisses Saab as a stooge, alleging he illegally replaced former prosecutor Luisa Ortega, who was removed after she broke with Maduro over human rights and has since fled the country."
Chevron,2017-10,"A former Socialist Party governor in oil-rich Anzoategui, Saab says he has done more in a few months than Ortega did in years and has vowed not to back down."

Chevron,2017-10,Brazil vs Mexico: Latin America's fight for Big Oil's money - Reuters News
Chevron,2017-10,{{20171026T142924.689+0000}}Brazil vs Mexico: Latin America's fight for Big Oil's money* Latin American reforms luring oil firms to bid on blocks
Chevron,2017-10,"HOUSTON/RIO DE JANEIRO, Oct 26 (Reuters) - Brazil and Mexico are competing for a diminishing resource: the investment dollars of oil majors beating a retreat from the big-ticket offshore projects they once coveted."
Chevron,2017-10,"After two waves of resource nationalism that left few openings in Latin America for energy giants such as Exxon Mobil Corp , Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Total , the tables are turning."
Chevron,2017-10,Governments throughout the continent are enacting reforms and changing contract terms to lure oil firms that have slashed spending as they adapt to lower crude prices. Global policy changes to address climate change have given an added sense of urgency to governments in the region and worldwide that are sitting on oil and gas reserves. They want to pump it before it becomes less valuable.
Chevron,2017-10,"""Both are attractive. Both have real potential,"" said Wael Sawan, Shell's executive vice president for deepwater. ""We have as a company, I think as an industry, scarce capital resources to be able to make the investments that the particular projects in deep water require."""
Chevron,2017-10,"Sawan is among the executives from the world's top energy firms who have jetted into Rio de Janeiro this week, hoping to win fields in Brazil's latest auction."
Chevron,2017-10,"Brazil has created a more conducive environment for investment than in the past, and venturing into Mexico looks exciting despite concerns over political risk and lack of infrastructure, he said."
Chevron,2017-10,"Low crude prices have made oil firms choose carefully where they invest, but they need the substantial reserves Brazil and Mexico are offering. The rate that energy companies replace the barrels they produce is a key metric for shareholders, and offshore blocks such as those in Mexico and Brazil come with billions of barrels in available reserves."
Chevron,2017-10,Latin America governments have relaxed deal terms and set accelerated auction schedules to lure investment to everything from ultra-deep water to mature fields that need specialist technology to squeeze more oil and gas from wells.
Chevron,2017-10,"To boost its chances, Brazil has ended its requirement for state-controlled Petrobras to be the operator of deep-sea projects in the country's pre-salt province, which contains large volumes of high-value light oil. That gives majors more freedom to manage exploration and output."
Chevron,2017-10,"Brazil has loosened local content requirements on equipment and supplies, which had previously slowed development, and set out a three-year calendar of oilfield auctions to facilitate planning for foreign firms."
Chevron,2017-10,"Mexico has countered with an easier qualification process to bid in auctions and is selling geological data on oilfields for majors and service firms to reprocess, while offering flexible local content requirements according to field type."
Chevron,2017-10,"For many oil majors, the Mexican side of the Gulf offers a familiar geology: the formations below the seabed are similar to those they have drilled for decades in the nearby U.S. waters. But unlike Brazil, there has been no deepwater development in Mexico, so more infrastructure needs to be built."
Chevron,2017-10,"Beyond the potential of the oilfields, the two countries offer different political challenges."
Chevron,2017-10,"Mexico's relatively recent reforms and a presidential election in 2018 imply a high political risk for majors, many of which were squeezed out of their Venezuela holdings by the country's socialist governments in the last decade."
Chevron,2017-10,Foreign firms are beginning to operate in Mexico just as the country's relationship with the United States worsens as U.S. President Donald Trump seeks trade concessions from Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto.
Chevron,2017-10,"Trump's public statements on Mexico have riled many Mexicans, giving the leftist opposition firebrand Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who is openly critical of Trump, a lift in the opinion polls. Lopez Obrador has said he could hold a referendum on the energy reform if he became president. [nL4N1FV4PI]"
Chevron,2017-10,"""I have no doubts that Mexico could be more attractive than Brazil,"" said Francisco Monaldi, a fellow in Latin American Energy Policy at Rice University's Baker Institute."
Chevron,2017-10,"""But the possible combination of Trump and Lopez Obrador is scary for investors,"" Monaldi said."
Chevron,2017-10,"Mexico's next bidding round should be concluded in January and includes 29 blocks that hold an estimated 4.2 billion barrels of prospective reserves. Another 35 blocks in shallow water areas with potentially 2 billion barrels will follow, with results expected to be announced in March. [nL2N1MU1PT]"
Chevron,2017-10,"Brazilian authorities have billed the round to be held on Friday its most competitive yet. Some 16 firms qualified to bid for blocks in the country's pre-salt reservoirs, where oil and gas are trapped under layers of salt beneath the ocean floor."
Chevron,2017-10,"""In the last year we have made extraordinary advances in the regulatory framework,"" said Joao Carlos de Luca, an adviser to the Brazilian Petroleum, Gas and Biofuels Institute that represents oil companies working in the country. ""That has put Brazil back on the map."""
Chevron,2017-10,"The previous auction, for 287 blocks in September, received $1.2 billion in offers, far more than expected. That was largely down to Exxon, which stole the show with aggressive bids. Until that round, Exxon was one of the few big oil firms absent from Brazil's offshore areas."
Chevron,2017-10,"Exxon has spent heavily this year on projects to replenish diminishing reserves, including in the U.S. Permian Basin shale play."
Chevron,2017-10,"In South America, Exxon has also invested in Argentina's Vaca Muerta shale areas while venturing into offshore Guyana along with Hess Corp in a $4.4 billion offshore project. [nL2N1M929Q] [nL3N1JD3UC] [nL2N1LI1RA]"
Chevron,2017-10,"In Ecuador, where every administration in recent decades has changed the country's oil contracts, President Lenin Moreno has called two new bidding rounds in 2018 for up to 24 blocks under more attractive terms. [nL2N1MH14S]"
Chevron,2017-10,Argentina also plans to announce next year a bidding round for oil and gas exploration blocks off its Atlantic coast after a 15-year hiatus on offshore auctions.
Chevron,2017-10,"""Current conditions are exactly opposed to those for nationalism. Everybody is now offering fields, but the spots available in the majors' portfolios under $50-60 per barrel of crude are just a few,"" Monaldi said."
Chevron,2017-10,"Other oil majors including BP Plc and Chevron Corp also are exploring investment opportunities in the region, from the Gulf of Mexico to Argentina."
Chevron,2017-10,"But making the case within oil majors for offshore capital-intensive projects is a challenge, said Javier La Rosa, president of Chevron's Brazil unit, at an industry conference in Rio on Wednesday."
Chevron,2017-10,"""I face this battle each year when our corporate business plan is put out,"" he said. ""It is not easy to convince shareholders to spend more money on deepwater fields when there are other lower cost options still available."""

Chevron,2017-10,"DALLAS, Oct 25 (Reuters Breakingviews) - It's a dilemma worthy of the OPEC cartel. U.S.-focused oil producers may be targeting higher returns rather than pumping more crude. Majors like Exxon Mobil and Chevron , reporting third-quarter earnings on Friday, know the trade-off, too. Selling less oil at a higher price is appealing if everyone joins in. But a history of internal tensions at the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries shows how easily self-interest prevails."
Chevron,2017-10,"Oil companies are better off than 20 months ago when the West Texas Intermediate price hovered around $30 a barrel: it is now above $50. Still, crude is plentiful and Anadarko Petroleum , Hess and ConocoPhillips , three large U.S. producers, cut capital-spending estimates last quarter. The U.S. rig count is falling, and earlier this week Halliburton Chief Executive Jeffrey Miller said his clients were focusing on ""cost-effective"" production."
Chevron,2017-10,"Some are shifting compensation plans for top executives to include more profit-related metrics like return on capital. Chevron restructured its pay in the spring, Evercore ISI notes, urging others to follow. In theory, if companies avoid drilling in expensive places they'll improve margins, and the reduced supply should in turn push up prices."
Chevron,2017-10,- ConocoPhillips is set to report third-quarter earnings on Oct. 26. Exxon Mobil and Chevron follow on Oct. 27.
Chevron,2017-10,"- Anadarko Petroleum and ConocoPhillips cut their capital-spending estimates last quarter, and U.S. rig counts have fallen in 10 of the past 13 weeks, according to Baker Hughes, though the count is still 64 percent higher than its level at the same time last year."
Chevron,2017-10,"- Halliburton Chief Executive Jeffrey Miller said on Oct. 23 in its third-quarter earnings call with analysts that the company's customers, which include oil producers in the U.S. Permian and Bakken basins, were focused on ""cost-effective"" production. He also said that in North America, a $50 per barrel oil price ""drives significant activity."""
Chevron,2017-10,"- On Oct. 11, the Energy Information Administration projected U.S. crude production would average 9.2 million barrels per day in 2017 and 9.9 million bpd in 2018, surpassing the previous record of 9.6 million bpd in 1970. The 2017 estimates fell slightly from the previous month, but the forecast for 2018 was slightly higher. Continental Resources Chief Executive Harold Hamm said on Sept. 21 that the EIA's predictions for U.S. oil production were ""flat wrong."""

Chevron,2017-10,"CAPE TOWN, Oct 24 (Reuters) - A refinery with capacity to process 650,000 barrels per day (bpd) of oil being built in Nigeria is due to come onstream by the end of 2019, the oil minister said on Tuesday."
Chevron,2017-10,"""That should be enough to meet local needs,"" Minister of State for Petroleum Resources Emmanuel Ibe Kachikwu told an oil and conference in Cape Town, referring to the Dangote refinery."
Chevron,2017-10,"State oil firm NNPC last year launched bidding to find partners to overhaul its ailing refineries, which hardly produce any petrol due to decades of mismanagement and widespread graft, leaving OPEC member Nigeria reliant on imported oil products."
Chevron,2017-10,"Kachikwu said Nigeria was close to finalising the process for private partners to revamp three existing refineries, adding a total of 450,000 bpd, part of the effort by Africa's biggest economy to reduce its reliance on imports."
Chevron,2017-10,Kachikwu said 26 firms had indicated their interest in the revamp projects that will require investment of $2 billion.
Chevron,2017-10,"""We are almost at a threshold of finalising the process of selection,"" he said, adding that it could announce its selection by January or February."
Chevron,2017-10,"The government has previously said it was in talks with Chevron , Total and ENI ."
Chevron,2017-10,"Kachikwu told reporters that Nigeria aimed to lift oil output in January to 1.8 million bpd from about 1.6 million to 1.7 million bpd now, but would not breach a ceiling agreed with the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. ""If we get to 1.8 (million), then we need to say 'hey, close off the taps, because we need to comply,"" he said."
Chevron,2017-10,He also said oil prices were now encouraging but OPEC had not ruled out further cuts to shore up the market.
Chevron,2017-10,"""The market is balancing fast .... But do we need to see more cuts? We'll see,"" he said."
Chevron,2017-10,"OPEC, Russia and other producers cut oil output by about 1.8 million bpd since January. The pact runs to March 2018, but they are considering extending it."

Chevron,2017-10,"Boston-based custody bank State Street Corp is expected to report a rise in net interest income for the third quarter, aided by higher interest rates and modest loan growth. Results will also be driven by higher market levels, despite seasonally slower foreign exchange and securities lending revenues."
Chevron,2017-10,"Toymaker Hasbro Inc, which reports third-quarter results, said in July that second-half revenue will be skewed more towards fourth quarter due to the release timing of movie franchises such as Star Wars and customers shifting to sourcing inventory just-in-time for the holidays.

Chevron,2017-10,"{{20171020T103541.602+0000}}Chevron approves new tech investment to raise output at North Sea fieldOct 20 (Reuters) - U.S. oil major Chevron has approved an investment to increase output from its Captain oilfield by using a new water-injection technology for the first time in the North Sea, the company said on Friday."
Chevron,2017-10,"Six long-reach horizontal wells will be drilled in the 20-year-old field, around 90 miles northeast of Aberdeen. They are expected to raise the recovery rate 5 to 7 percent."
Chevron,2017-10,"Polymerised water will be injected into the field's oil reservoir, a new technique to tap oil reserves that are hard to reach with conventional drilling methods. It will be the first time the technology has been applied on this scale in the North Sea."
Chevron,2017-10,"The polymer injection wells will come on stream from 2018 to 2021, a spokeswoman said. She declined to disclose how much they would cost."
Chevron,2017-10,"Approving the investment for the first phase of project ""is an important milestone in the development of the technology, which we believe will improve the recovery rate from older fields and help extend the life of assets,"" said Greta Lydecker, managing director of Chevron's European upstream division."
Chevron,2017-10,Chevron is the operator of the field and owns 85 percent of it. Dana Petroleum [KOILCD.UL] holds a 15 percent stake.

Chevron,2017-10,"Oct 19 (Reuters) - Woodside Petroleum , Australia's largest independent oil and gas producer, reported a 7 percent dip in third-quarter revenue as output from the North West Shelf in Western Australia declined, and slashed its full-year output guidance range."
Chevron,2017-10,"Revenue in the quarter slipped to $914 million from $988 million in the year-ago period, short of UBS's forecast of $992 million, while output fell to 20.3 mmboe from 25.2 mmboe last year, compared with UBS's forecast of 21.9 mmboe."
Chevron,2017-10,"Woodside also said it had appointed Sherry Duhe as its chief financial officer, effective Dec. 1."
Chevron,2017-10,"The company narrowed its forecast for full-year production to 84 million to 86 million barrels of oil equivalent (mmboe), from 84 mmboe to 90 mmboe, citing the timing of the first train of its Wheatstone project."

Chevron,2017-10,* Cuts top end of full-year output forecast to 90 mln boe
Chevron,2017-10,"Oct 19 (Reuters) - Woodside Petroleum played down disappointing results from its exploration wells in Myanmar on Thursday, with Chief Executive Peter Coleman saying the company is still on track to decide on development plans there by the end of 2018."
Chevron,2017-10,"Australia's top independent oil and gas producer cancelled plans for a seismic survey in Myanmar after drilling five wells scheduled for 2017, Coleman said in an interview, confirming a Reuters report this week. [nL4N1MR2TI]"
Chevron,2017-10,"Coleman was speaking after Woodside cut its full-year output forecast, reporting third-quarter revenue fell 7.5 percent from a year earlier to $914 million, missing some analysts' forecasts. Shares slipped as much as 2 percent."
Chevron,2017-10,"A well on the A6 block off the southwest coast of Myanmar found only residual gas which was ""unlikely to be commercially recoverable"", Woodside said, while a well in Block AD7 off the northwest coast hit ""water-wet sands"", following three finds earlier."
Chevron,2017-10,Coleman said the company had decided not to go ahead with extra seismic work as it already had enough information to digest ahead of drilling in 2018.
Chevron,2017-10,"""In the end we decided we were already pretty much stretched on where we were and it was prudent for us to stop,"" he told Reuters."
Chevron,2017-10,"Woodside is among the biggest holders of petroleum acreage offshore Myanmar, where its partners include majors Royal Dutch Shell and France's Total SA , and has targeted the country as a key source of growth after 2021."
Chevron,2017-10,"""We've really said by the end of 2018 we will know what the development looks like in Myanmar,"" Coleman said. ""We're still on schedule for that."""
Chevron,2017-10,"Coleman said the Rohingya refugee crisis in Myanmar had not affected offshore operations at all, but the company did have to cancel talks with some fishing communities in troubled areas."
Chevron,2017-10,"""It's something we're obviously concerned about, we're watching closely,"" he said."
Chevron,2017-10,Analysts said the latest drilling results were not a big setback for its aspirations in Myanmar.

Chevron,2017-10,"For the full year, Woodside narrowed its guidance range to 84 million to 86 million barrels of oil equivalent (mmboe), lowering the top end from 90 mmboe due to the slightly delayed start-up of the Wheatstone liquefied natural gas project, run by Chevron Corp ."

Chevron,2017-10,"Australia's top oil and gas industry group said Chevron's decision reflected the tough conditions in the oil market which has led oil companies to slash spending. Exploration in the country, both onshore and offshore, has dropped to 30-year lows."

Chevron,2017-10,"SINGAPORE, Oct 12 (Reuters) - The appeal of Indonesia's oil and gas sector is improving for some independent producers as the resource-rich nation scrambles to reduce its dependence on imports and fill a gap left by the exit of some producers, the head of GSS Energy told Reuters."
Chevron,2017-10,"""There could be some assets that will be available that three or five years ago would have been very difficult to gain access to for a relatively small and new player like us,"" said Sydney Yeung, group chief executive at Singapore-listed GSS Energy at the Reuters Global Commodity Summit."
Chevron,2017-10,"Amid depressed oil prices, international oil companies such as ConocoPhillips and Chevron have reduced their holdings in Indonesia, a former member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.

Chevron,2017-10,"The risks that energy investors face in Indonesia are highlighted by recent change to the development plans of the Masela gas field developed by Japan's Inpex <1605.T>.

Chevron,2017-10,"The recent departure of the producers, as well as its drive to reduce its dependence on imports, ""can only force the government to move faster"" in implementing more favourable policies and incentives for operators, said Yeung at the Summit held at the Reuters office in Singapore."
Chevron,2017-10,"Indonesia's crude oil output peaked at around 1.7 million barrels per day (bpd) in the mid-1990s. But with few significant oil discoveries in the past 10 years, production has fallen to roughly half that as old fields have matured and died."
Chevron,2017-10,"""Indonesia is a net importer of oil not because there's a lack of resources,"" said Yeung, but because ""previous policies that did not encourage or anticipate the demand they needed and did not push as aggressively as they should have."""
Chevron,2017-10,"With oil demand at about 1.2 million bpd and production at about 800,000 bpd, investors in Indonesia's oil and gas sector will have a big supply gap to fill, said Yeung."

Chevron,2017-10,"On the sidelines of the FT Africa Summit in London, dos Santos said changes to the Sonangol board announced last week would help the company revamp new exploration and production agreements and significantly cut costs."
Chevron,2017-10,"""We are rethinking all our strategy, with a view of being able to produce barrels within $40-$50 per barrel,"" said dos Santos, the billionaire daughter of Angola's President Jose Eduardo dos Santos."
Chevron,2017-10,"She said some projects were targeting a breakeven as low as $20-$30 per barrel, adding the changes were essential so new concession agreements could begin ""delivering dollars per barrel, rather than just cost."""

Chevron,2017-10,"In a statement on Friday, Sonangol said it had saved $1.7 billion thanks to spending cuts since 2014. But it also said it had replaced the chairman of its executive committee, Paulino Jeronimo, who had managed new concessions and relationships with operators. [nL8N1MH4Y0]"

Chevron,2017-10,"""The first cargo is on track to be shipped in the coming weeks,"" Chevron Corp said in a statement. It had originally hoped to start exporting from Wheatstone in the middle of 2017."
Chevron,2017-10,"Wheatstone is the sixth out of eight projects in a $200 billion Australian LNG construction boom that is now in its final stretch. The two remaining ones are Royal Dutch Shell's Prelude floating LNG project and Ichthys, led by Japan's Inpex <1605.T>. [nL4N1LO1H5]"
Chevron,2017-10,"This massive expansion, which has suffered numerous delays, has propelled Australia past Malaysia to become the world's second-biggest LNG exporter. Once all the mega-projects are completed, Australia will challenge Qatar for the top spot. [nL4N1MG0X9]"
Chevron,2017-10,"Wheatstone, co-owned by Australia's Woodside Petroleum , Kuwait Foreign Exploration Co and Japan's Kyushu Electric Power Co <9508.T>, has two gas liquefaction units, which at full capacity will supply 8.9 million metric tonnes of LNG a year to customers in Asia."
Chevron,2017-10,The company expects the second unit to start producing six to eight months after the first.
Chevron,2017-10,"Woodside has been closely involved in Wheatstone, looking to ensure smooth development, as the company expects the project to be the largest contributor to its planned 15 percent production growth over the next three years."
Chevron,2017-10,"""Wheatstone is a world-class asset and the safe start-up of the facility was one of our priorities for 2017, supporting our near-term growth strategy,"" Woodside Chief Executive Peter Coleman said."
Chevron,2017-10,"Wheatstone exports could stall rising spot LNG prices , which have surged 55 percent since March to $8.50 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) on strong demand and the delayed ramp-up of many of the Australian LNG export facilities. [nL4N1MH0LA]"
Chevron,2017-10,"""It (Wheatstone) comes at just the right time ahead of winter...Together with Wheatstone, several new LNG trains such as Yamal LNG, Cove Point and Train 4 from Sabine Pass will ramp up or start up production by year-end,"" said Nicholas Browne, head of Asia gas and power research at Wood Mackenzie in Singapore."
Chevron,2017-10,"""This will sow the seeds for strong production through winter 2017-18, pushing the market into increasing over-capacity as we move into the summer of 2018. We therefore expect to see prices dip below $6/mmbtu once this winter is over,"" said Browne."

Chevron,2017-10,"SYDNEY, Oct 6 (Reuters) - Australia expects to increase exports of liquefied natural gas (LNG) by 16 percent from mid-2018 as $180 billion in new projects hit their stride, nearly catching up with Qatar, the world's top supplier."
Chevron,2017-10,"Rising LNG exports coupled with higher prices for steel-making commodities and thermal coal should see Australia's overall resource and energy export earnings increase 2 percent in the year to end-June 2018, to a record A$211 billion ($165 billion), the Department of Industry, Innovation and Science said on Friday."
Chevron,2017-10,"Australia's LNG exports are forecast to climb to 74 million tonnes in the year to end-June 2019, from 63.8 million tonnes forecast for this year and 52 million tonnes last year."
Chevron,2017-10,"The rise in Australian exports will be underpinned by higher output at the Gorgon project, run by Chevron Corp , as well as the completion of three remaining LNG projects: Chevron's Wheatstone, Inpex Corp's <1605.T> Ichthys, and Royal Dutch Shell's Prelude."
Chevron,2017-10,"Those three projects will add around 21 million tonnes to Australia's LNG export capacity, taking total capacity to around 88 million tonnes."

Chevron,2017-10,"""While prospects for growth in the imports of Japan and South Korea are limited, Australian producers are expected to capture an increasing share of both country's imports,"" the department said."
Chevron,2017-10,"The department raised its iron ore price forecast for 2017 about 3 percent to an average $64 a tonne, and increased its coking coal price forecast by 6 percent to $203.30 a tonne from its June outlook."
Chevron,2017-10,"Coking coal contract prices for the third and fourth quarters are forecast to be much lower than the first half, it said, driven by higher production in China and a return to normal in Australia after a cyclone cut output earlier this year."
Chevron,2017-10,"Iron ore, Australia's top export earner and dominated by miners Rio Tinto and BHP , has rebounded from a low of $47 a tonne in mid-June, to average $65 a tonne in the September quarter."
Chevron,2017-10,"""The iron ore price has been boosted by strong steel margins in China, which has resulted in increased steel production and mill restocking of inputs,"" the department said."
