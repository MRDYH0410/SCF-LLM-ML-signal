Chevron,2017-6,"{{20170629T120002.613+0000}}RPT-COLUMN-Europe set to be natural gas kingmaker as LNG booms: Russell(Repeats item issued earlier. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.)"
Chevron,2017-6,"LAUNCESTON, Australia, June 29 (Reuters) - It's probably not quite here yet, but the trend is unmistakeable; the world is moving to a globally-linked natural gas market and the rise of liquefied natural gas (LNG) is the key driver."
Chevron,2017-6,"Much of the increase in LNG capacity is because of the rapid boost to plants in Australia and the United States, as both countries take advantage of abundant local reserves of natural gas to muscle in on a market that until recently had been dominated by a few established producers and buyers."
Chevron,2017-6,"But it is perhaps ironic that while the action on the capacity side of LNG is an Australian and American story, the ultimate controlling player of the emerging global natural gas market is likely to be Europe."
Chevron,2017-6,"This is because Europe is likely to act as a ""clearing house"" for surplus LNG cargoes, given it has excess re-gasification capacity and the ability to use the fuel for a variety of purposes, from power generation to manufacturing to household heating."
Chevron,2017-6,"Europe is also the only region that can effectively arbitrage between LNG and pipeline prices, given its connection to Russian and other Eastern natural gas via pipelines."
Chevron,2017-6,"The continent is also best-placed to use market forces to find a price level for natural gas versus its competitors, given it still has substantial coal-fired power in some countries as well as being a leader in renewables such as wind and solar."
Chevron,2017-6,"To understand Europe's role in the LNG market, it's worth examining how the dynamics of trade in the super-chilled fuel are changing with the rise of Australia and the United States."
Chevron,2017-6,"LNG has traditionally been an opaque and tightly-controlled market, where a small number of exporters signed long-term, oil-linked contracts with an equally small number of buyers, who were more concerned about energy security than price."
Chevron,2017-6,"The major producers included Qatar, Indonesia and Malaysia, while the top buyers were concentrated in North Asia, namely Japan and South Korea, and also in Europe."
Chevron,2017-6,"It was inevitable that this situation would be disrupted once global energy giants such as Chevron , Royal Dutch Shell , ConocoPhillips and Exxon Mobil decided to pour some $200 billion into developing eight new LNG projects in Australia."
Chevron,2017-6,"Three of these are ground-breaking ventures based on using coal-seam gas as feedstock, one is the biggest floating LNG project and the rest are conventional offshore gas to onshore liquefaction plants."
Chevron,2017-6,"When the last of these new plants is operating, most likely by 2018, Australia will have around 80 million tonnes of annual LNG capacity, overtaking Qatar as the top exporter of the fuel."
Chevron,2017-6,"Not far behind Australia on the development scale is the United States, with 16 million tonnes of LNG capacity already operating at the Sabine Pass facility in the Gulf of Mexico."
Chevron,2017-6,"A further 60.5 million tonnes of annual capacity is under construction, and will arrive from late in 2017 to the end of 2019, with the bulk scheduled to be commissioned in 2018."
Chevron,2017-6,"The International Gas Union (IGU), the industry's lobby group, said in its annual review in April that there was 340 million tonnes of LNG capacity as at the end of 2016, and a further 114 million tonnes under construction as of the start of this year."
Chevron,2017-6,"In some ways, LNG is the last cab off the rank in the commodity boom that saw massive capacity expansions in iron ore, coal and crude oil as part of the recovery from the 2008 global recession."
Chevron,2017-6,"Much of the investment in commodity projects was driven by the belief that China, the world's top commodity consumer and importer, would continue to soak up everything the world could throw at it."
Chevron,2017-6,"As can be seen from the five years of price declines for coal and iron ore from 2011 to 2015, this was a forlorn hope, even though China has continued to increase its imports of natural resources."
Chevron,2017-6,"LNG is equally likely to move into an oversupply situation by 2020, notwithstanding increased imports by China and the emergence of new buyers in Asia, such as Pakistan and Singapore."
Chevron,2017-6,"It's this oversupply dynamic that is changing the way LNG is traded, with buyers no longer willing to lock into long-term contracts linked to the price of crude oil."
Chevron,2017-6,"While it will take several years for these contracts to disappear entirely, buyers are having success in negotiating shorter-term deals, or even taking more spot cargoes."
Chevron,2017-6,"As a consequence, the spot price of LNG in Asia has plummeted in recent years. From a record $20.50 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) in February 2014, LNG was last at $5.40 in the week to June 23, down nearly 75 percent."
Chevron,2017-6,"The drop in Asian spot LNG prices has led them to converge with prices in Europe, with the British National Balancing Point (NBP) price actually exceeding the Asian spot price in May and June last year, according to the IGU."
Chevron,2017-6,"The difference between the two benchmarks averaged just 91 cents per mmBtu in 2016, the IGU said, showing how dramatically the Asian premium has narrowed in recent years, having been as high as $6 per mmBtu at the end of 2013."
Chevron,2017-6,"Front-month NBP futures ended at the equivalent of $4.88 per mmBtu on June 28, meaning spot the Asian LNG price commanded a premium of just 52 U.S. cents."
Chevron,2017-6,"Benchmark U.S. Henry Hub natural gas futures were at $3.067 per mmBtu on June 28, showing that the three main regional benchmarks are fairly close to each other."
Chevron,2017-6,"This becomes even more the case when the approximately $1.50 per mmBtu cost of liquefaction, already included in the spot Asian price, is added to the NBP and Henry Hub prices."
Chevron,2017-6,"The economics of the LNG market then come down to shipping costs across various routes, and it's here that Europe comes into its own."
Chevron,2017-6,"It's highly unlikely that Australian LNG will flow to the Atlantic Basin, given the long sea voyage, which adds to the cost but also increases the loss from boil-off of the LNG being shipped."
Chevron,2017-6,"This means Australian LNG will have to find a home in Asia, either among traditional buyers or emerging markets in Southeast Asia, where its geographic position gives it an advantage over Qatar and producers in Africa or the United States."
Chevron,2017-6,"The swing supplier will likely be the United States, which can ship to both Europe and Asia, as well as Latin America."
Chevron,2017-6,"It's also likely that Qatar may feel increasing pressure in Asia as it has to compete with new Australian supplies, meaning it either has to find new buyers in East Asia or push more cargoes westward to Europe."
Chevron,2017-6,The new dynamics of LNG trade can already be seen in flows around the world.
Chevron,2017-6,"In 2016, 278.9 million tonnes of LNG moved by ship globally, according to vessel-tracking and port data compiled by Thomson Reuters, a 7.6 percent hike from the 259.2 million shipped the prior year."
Chevron,2017-6,"Of that total, 41.7 million tonnes went to Europe, while 156.5 million went to North Asia, which includes Japan, South Korea and China, and 33.2 million was shipped to the rest of Asia."
Chevron,2017-6,"Back in 2013 total LNG trade stood at 243.9 million tonnes, with 38.5 million going to Europe, 151.5 million to North Asia and 17.7 million to the rest of Asia."
Chevron,2017-6,"What this shows is that Europe and North Asia grew slowly in the past four years, while emerging Asia surged on the back of rising imports by India and newer buyers such as Singapore and Pakistan, and even by traditional exporters like Malaysia."
Chevron,2017-6,Looking at the breakdown by exporting country shows that Australia has gone from shipping 23.7 million tonnes in 2013 to 46.1 million in 2016.
Chevron,2017-6,"Of Australian shipments in 2016, 39.6 million tonnes went to North Asia, up from 21.4 million in 2013."
Chevron,2017-6,"Qatar shipped 34.7 million tonnes to North Asia in 2016, down from 40.5 million in 2013."
Chevron,2017-6,"It seems clear that Australia is supplanting Qatar as the main supplier to North Asian markets, a trend that's likely to continue as the Pacific nation brings another 40 million tonnes of LNG capacity on line by 2018."
Chevron,2017-6,"Qatar has had success in boosting its shipments to the rest of Asia and to Europe, but it will also face pressure in those markets."
Chevron,2017-6,"Australia has gone from shipping 65,900 tonnes, or just one cargo, to the rest of Asia in 2013 to supplying 3.1 million tonnes in 2016, and it's likely that its producers, especially those on the northwest coast, will be trying to gain a bigger foothold in markets like India and Sri Lanka."
Chevron,2017-6,"Overall, the global LNG market is becoming more competitive, driven by increased supply and buyer demands for more flexibility."
Chevron,2017-6,"These trends are set to continue in the coming years, creating a far larger spot market and likely seeing the demise of restrictive destination clauses and oil-linked pricing."
Chevron,2017-6,"It's also the case that much of the demand growth for LNG will be concentrated in Asia, but that doesn't necessarily mean the region will become the hub for LNG."
Chevron,2017-6,The main problem in establishing an LNG trading hub is that the fuel isn't just simply a natural gas version of crude oil.
Chevron,2017-6,Long-term storage is problematic given the boil-off that occurs when LNG is placed in land-based tanks or on ships.
Chevron,2017-6,"While newer LNG vessels can use boil-off as fuel for the engines, it's unlikely that LNG can be stored and traded multiple times, as is currently common in crude oil."
Chevron,2017-6,"Singapore would like to become Asia's LNG hub, but this would require massive infrastructure investment and the development of a regional pipeline system that would allow LNG to be re-gasified and then transported and stored."
Chevron,2017-6,"While this may happen over time, the absence of storage and interconnecting pipelines across Asia limits the continent's chances of being the centre of the LNG universe."
Chevron,2017-6,"Rather, it's Europe with its plentiful re-gasification capacity and pipeline and storage infrastructure that can play that role."
Chevron,2017-6,"Among European countries, Spain has the best potential as an LNG hub, given its proximity to Qatar (through the Suez canal), West and North African producers and the United States."
Chevron,2017-6,"Spain has 49 million tonnes per annum in re-gasification capacity, but only 21 percent of this was being utilised in January this year, according to the IGU."
Chevron,2017-6,"Elsewhere in Europe, Britain has 35 million tonnes of re-gasification but, like Spain, only 21 percent was in use in January."
Chevron,2017-6,"In contrast Japan's 197 million tonnes of capacity had a utilisation rate of 43 percent, South Korea's 101 million tonnes was used at 35 percent and China's 49 million tonnes at 56 percent."
Chevron,2017-6,"While it's clear that the big buyers in North Asia can take more LNG, it's also obvious that Spain and Britain can take substantially more LNG."
Chevron,2017-6,"They also have the means to use the natural gas, while demand in both Japan and South Korea has been largely steady in recent years, although China is witnessing strong growth."
Chevron,2017-6,"Overall, when the rest of Australia's LNG hits the market, it will likely push more Qatari cargoes to Europe."
Chevron,2017-6,"As the U.S. LNG comes on stream, it can choose whether to got to Europe or Asia depending on the price."
Chevron,2017-6,"Europe will become the destination of last resort for an increasing number of spot LNG cargoes, meaning it gets to set the price that determines where the fuel goes."
Chevron,2017-6,"Despite being a substantially smaller market than Asia, Europe will become the kingmaker in LNG."

Chevron,2017-6,"Park Young-hoon, a refinery analyst at Hanwha Investment & Securities in South Korea said Asian ""refiners have no options to respond"" to the might of Europe and the United States."
Chevron,2017-6,It is not just a question of which region dominates. Much of the shift is the result of behavioural changes in the markets.
Chevron,2017-6,"Canadian investment bank RBC Capital said this week that ""tourist traders"" were increasingly dominating oil markets rather than real oil market conditions."
Chevron,2017-6,"""Oil market intelligence has been diluted over recent years given the rise of algorithmically charged participants, from what historically was a physically driven market,"" RBC said."
Chevron,2017-6,Due to technology and big data this change is seen as unavoidable.
Chevron,2017-6,"""The whims of financial traders halfway across the globe make it hard for us to plan hedging strategies that are in tune with our refinery output,"" said a trader with a large Asian refiner, speaking on the condition of anonymity as he was not allowed to disclose financial information."
Chevron,2017-6,"Though it's true that U.S. and European refiners and producers can also be impacted by speculators, many western oil majors such as Royal Dutch Shell , Chevron and BP are known to have large financial trading desks that help them to counter and make money from big market moves."
Chevron,2017-6,"Overall trading in Brent futures has soared, from under 1 million lots typically exchanged per month before 2005 to a record 7.3 million exchanged in May."
Chevron,2017-6,"Asia has so far played only a marginal role in the rise in crude futures trading. That may eventually change, though, as China steps up efforts this year to launch its much-awaited Shanghai crude futures contract. [nL4N1IE3AJ]"
Chevron,2017-6,"""China wants a seat at the global energy futures table, and is actively encouraging commodity trading and investment,"" said John Driscoll, director of JTD Energy Services in Singapore."
Chevron,2017-6,The project's details have been criticised - including for its denomination in yuan and the expected dominance of Chinese companies - yet few doubt that China's size and its culture of widespread retail trading mean a high-volume Chinese oil futures benchmark will eventually emerge.
Chevron,2017-6,"Shanghai's crude futures, currently planned for launch later this year, will likely see China's state-owned energy companies like Sinopec and PetroChina <601857.SS> acting as market makers, giving them strength in financial trading similar to what they have long held in physical markets. [nL4N1IE3AJ]"
Chevron,2017-6,"It has already happened in commodities such as iron ore, coal and steel, where Chinese futures contracts have become global benchmarks after being widely dismissed by U.S. and European traders initially. [nL5N17V043]"

Chevron,2017-6,"LONDON/SINGAPORE, June 28 (Reuters) - Work to restart production at Australia's Woodside-operated Karratha Gas Plant, which hosts the North West Shelf liquefied natural gas (LNG) export project, is underway following a partial outage on June 24, a spokeswoman said."
Chevron,2017-6,"The spokeswoman declined to say whether there had been an impact on LNG exports. Industry sources said the outage had affected LNG exports and this was supporting spot LNG prices in Asia , which have been on a downward trend for months."
Chevron,2017-6,"The project spokeswoman said Karratha Gas Plant had experienced ""a partial production outage"" on Saturday afternoon."
Chevron,2017-6,"""The site was mustered in accordance with our standard procedures and all personnel have returned to work as normal,"" she added."
Chevron,2017-6,"North West Shelf supplies Asian markets with around 16.3 million tonnes of LNG each year from five processing plants, known as trains. The outage affected exports from trains 2, 3 and 5, two trading sources said."
Chevron,2017-6,"Train 5 had resumed output already while trains 2 and 3 are in the process of being restarted, they said."
Chevron,2017-6,The last time exports ground to a halt was in mid-April following another unplanned outage. [nL8N1HT2Z5]

Chevron,2017-6,"TCO previously only sent LPG in transit through Ukraine to the Black Sea port of Odessa and via land border crossings to Poland and other eastern European countries, the sources said. Talks on LPG supplies to Ukraine, which became a more high-reward market in 2016 compared to traditional routes, have been held for around a year."
Chevron,2017-6,"""(They) signed a spot contract, more likely, for a month. Talks are being held about a term (long-term) contract,"" a source familiar with the negotiations told Reuters."
Chevron,2017-6,"He also said that LPG will be delivered to SOCAR Ukraine, a Ukrainian subsidiary of Azerbaijan's state oil company SOCAR."
Chevron,2017-6,"An export-parity price for LPG supplies from Russia to Ukraine was on average $105-$115 per tonne higher than to Poland in 2016 and $70-80 per tonne higher than via Black Sea ports, Reuters calculations showed."
Chevron,2017-6,"TCO's test 300-400 tonne spot railway cargo for SOCAR Ukraine will be loaded in July via the Solovey-Topoli border crossing with a premium on technical propane butane mixture on DAP Ukraine basis (Russian-Ukrainian border), traders said."
Chevron,2017-6,"The size of the premium hasn't been disclosed, but Reuters monitoring showed that the difference between average spot prices of technical propane butane mixture at the Russia-Ukraine border and those on DAP Brest basis was $8 per tonne in favour of the Ukrainian market in the first half of the year."
Chevron,2017-6,"Another confirmation that TCO will start LPG supplies to Ukraine are shippers' monthly nominations, which Thomson Reuters Eikon publishes weekly. A total of 410 tonnes of liquefied gas, including 180 tonnes of butane and 230 tonnes of propane, will be shipped from the Kulsary station in Kazakhstan to the Ukrainian station of Spartak in the first ten days of July, according to the nominations."
Chevron,2017-6,"Market participants said SOCAR Ukraine has an agreement to store liquefied gas at the Makarovskaya LPG dispensing station (Spartak station), which is managed by UPK Group, a big player on the Ukrainian wholesale and retail LPG market."
Chevron,2017-6,"TCO's LPG production rose to 595,237 tonnes in January-May this year, up 6.7 percent from a year earlier."
Chevron,2017-6,"The company also ramped up LPG exports by nine percent to 549,177 tonnes in the first five months of the year compared to the same period last year."
Chevron,2017-6,"The main export routes for TCO's LPG in the western direction in January-May 2017 are to the port of Odessa (169,079 tonnes), Poland (128,410 tonnes), the Russian port of Taman (101,940 tonnes) and Hungary (59,986)."
Chevron,2017-6,"TCO also supplies liquefied gas to China with exports reaching 44,272 tonnes in the first five months of the year."
Chevron,2017-6,"Last October the world's largest independent oil trader Vitol started exports of TCO's LPG, which it received under an advance contract with one of the company's shareholders, Kazakhstan's state oil and gas company KazMunaiGas, which is looking for new profitable export routes because of the economic downturn."
Chevron,2017-6,"Shareholders in Tengizchevroil are U.S. Chevron (50 percent) and ExxonMobil (25 percent), KazMunaiGas (20 percent) and Lukarco, a subsidiary of Russia's Lukoil , (5 percent)."

Chevron,2017-6,"LAUNCESTON, Australia, June 29 (Reuters) - It's probably not quite here yet, but the trend is unmistakeable; the world is moving to a globally-linked natural gas market and the rise of liquefied natural gas (LNG) is the key driver."
Chevron,2017-6,"Much of the increase in LNG capacity is because of the rapid boost to plants in Australia and the United States, as both countries take advantage of abundant local reserves of natural gas to muscle in on a market that until recently had been dominated by a few established producers and buyers."
Chevron,2017-6,"But it is perhaps ironic that while the action on the capacity side of LNG is an Australian and American story, the ultimate controlling player of the emerging global natural gas market is likely to be Europe."
Chevron,2017-6,"This is because Europe is likely to act as a ""clearing house"" for surplus LNG cargoes, given it has excess re-gasification capacity and the ability to use the fuel for a variety of purposes, from power generation to manufacturing to household heating."
Chevron,2017-6,"Europe is also the only region that can effectively arbitrage between LNG and pipeline prices, given its connection to Russian and other Eastern natural gas via pipelines."
Chevron,2017-6,"The continent is also best-placed to use market forces to find a price level for natural gas versus its competitors, given it still has substantial coal-fired power in some countries as well as being a leader in renewables such as wind and solar."
Chevron,2017-6,"To understand Europe's role in the LNG market, it's worth examining how the dynamics of trade in the super-chilled fuel are changing with the rise of Australia and the United States."
Chevron,2017-6,"LNG has traditionally been an opaque and tightly-controlled market, where a small number of exporters signed long-term, oil-linked contracts with an equally small number of buyers, who were more concerned about energy security than price."
Chevron,2017-6,"The major producers included Qatar, Indonesia and Malaysia, while the top buyers were concentrated in North Asia, namely Japan and South Korea, and also in Europe."
Chevron,2017-6,"It was inevitable that this situation would be disrupted once global energy giants such as Chevron , Royal Dutch Shell , ConocoPhillips and Exxon Mobil decided to pour some $200 billion into developing eight new LNG projects in Australia."
Chevron,2017-6,"Three of these are ground-breaking ventures based on using coal-seam gas as feedstock, one is the biggest floating LNG project and the rest are conventional offshore gas to onshore liquefaction plants."
Chevron,2017-6,"When the last of these new plants is operating, most likely by 2018, Australia will have around 80 million tonnes of annual LNG capacity, overtaking Qatar as the top exporter of the fuel."
Chevron,2017-6,"Not far behind Australia on the development scale is the United States, with 16 million tonnes of LNG capacity already operating at the Sabine Pass facility in the Gulf of Mexico."
Chevron,2017-6,"A further 60.5 million tonnes of annual capacity is under construction, and will arrive from late in 2017 to the end of 2019, with the bulk scheduled to be commissioned in 2018."
Chevron,2017-6,"The International Gas Union (IGU), the industry's lobby group, said in its annual review in April that there was 340 million tonnes of LNG capacity as at the end of 2016, and a further 114 million tonnes under construction as of the start of this year."
Chevron,2017-6,"In some ways, LNG is the last cab off the rank in the commodity boom that saw massive capacity expansions in iron ore, coal and crude oil as part of the recovery from the 2008 global recession."
Chevron,2017-6,"Much of the investment in commodity projects was driven by the belief that China, the world's top commodity consumer and importer, would continue to soak up everything the world could throw at it."
Chevron,2017-6,"As can be seen from the five years of price declines for coal and iron ore from 2011 to 2015, this was a forlorn hope, even though China has continued to increase its imports of natural resources."
Chevron,2017-6,"LNG is equally likely to move into an oversupply situation by 2020, notwithstanding increased imports by China and the emergence of new buyers in Asia, such as Pakistan and Singapore."
Chevron,2017-6,"It's this oversupply dynamic that is changing the way LNG is traded, with buyers no longer willing to lock into long-term contracts linked to the price of crude oil."
Chevron,2017-6,"While it will take several years for these contracts to disappear entirely, buyers are having success in negotiating shorter-term deals, or even taking more spot cargoes."
Chevron,2017-6,"As a consequence, the spot price of LNG in Asia has plummeted in recent years. From a record $20.50 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) in February 2014, LNG was last at $5.40 in the week to June 23, down nearly 75 percent."
Chevron,2017-6,"The drop in Asian spot LNG prices has led them to converge with prices in Europe, with the British National Balancing Point (NBP) price actually exceeding the Asian spot price in May and June last year, according to the IGU."
Chevron,2017-6,"The difference between the two benchmarks averaged just 91 cents per mmBtu in 2016, the IGU said, showing how dramatically the Asian premium has narrowed in recent years, having been as high as $6 per mmBtu at the end of 2013."
Chevron,2017-6,"Front-month NBP futures ended at the equivalent of $4.88 per mmBtu on June 28, meaning spot the Asian LNG price commanded a premium of just 52 U.S. cents."
Chevron,2017-6,"Benchmark U.S. Henry Hub natural gas futures were at $3.067 per mmBtu on June 28, showing that the three main regional benchmarks are fairly close to each other."
Chevron,2017-6,"This becomes even more the case when the approximately $1.50 per mmBtu cost of liquefaction, already included in the spot Asian price, is added to the NBP and Henry Hub prices."
Chevron,2017-6,"The economics of the LNG market then come down to shipping costs across various routes, and it's here that Europe comes into its own."
Chevron,2017-6,"It's highly unlikely that Australian LNG will flow to the Atlantic Basin, given the long sea voyage, which adds to the cost but also increases the loss from boil-off of the LNG being shipped."
Chevron,2017-6,"This means Australian LNG will have to find a home in Asia, either among traditional buyers or emerging markets in Southeast Asia, where its geographic position gives it an advantage over Qatar and producers in Africa or the United States."
Chevron,2017-6,"The swing supplier will likely be the United States, which can ship to both Europe and Asia, as well as Latin America."
Chevron,2017-6,"It's also likely that Qatar may feel increasing pressure in Asia as it has to compete with new Australian supplies, meaning it either has to find new buyers in East Asia or push more cargoes westward to Europe."
Chevron,2017-6,The new dynamics of LNG trade can already be seen in flows around the world.
Chevron,2017-6,"In 2016, 278.9 million tonnes of LNG moved by ship globally, according to vessel-tracking and port data compiled by Thomson Reuters, a 7.6 percent hike from the 259.2 million shipped the prior year."
Chevron,2017-6,"Of that total, 41.7 million tonnes went to Europe, while 156.5 million went to North Asia, which includes Japan, South Korea and China, and 33.2 million was shipped to the rest of Asia."
Chevron,2017-6,"Back in 2013 total LNG trade stood at 243.9 million tonnes, with 38.5 million going to Europe, 151.5 million to North Asia and 17.7 million to the rest of Asia."
Chevron,2017-6,"What this shows is that Europe and North Asia grew slowly in the past four years, while emerging Asia surged on the back of rising imports by India and newer buyers such as Singapore and Pakistan, and even by traditional exporters like Malaysia."
Chevron,2017-6,Looking at the breakdown by exporting country shows that Australia has gone from shipping 23.7 million tonnes in 2013 to 46.1 million in 2016.
Chevron,2017-6,"Of Australian shipments in 2016, 39.6 million tonnes went to North Asia, up from 21.4 million in 2013."
Chevron,2017-6,"Qatar shipped 34.7 million tonnes to North Asia in 2016, down from 40.5 million in 2013."
Chevron,2017-6,"It seems clear that Australia is supplanting Qatar as the main supplier to North Asian markets, a trend that's likely to continue as the Pacific nation brings another 40 million tonnes of LNG capacity on line by 2018."
Chevron,2017-6,"Qatar has had success in boosting its shipments to the rest of Asia and to Europe, but it will also face pressure in those markets."
Chevron,2017-6,"Australia has gone from shipping 65,900 tonnes, or just one cargo, to the rest of Asia in 2013 to supplying 3.1 million tonnes in 2016, and it's likely that its producers, especially those on the northwest coast, will be trying to gain a bigger foothold in markets like India and Sri Lanka."
Chevron,2017-6,"Overall, the global LNG market is becoming more competitive, driven by increased supply and buyer demands for more flexibility."
Chevron,2017-6,"These trends are set to continue in the coming years, creating a far larger spot market and likely seeing the demise of restrictive destination clauses and oil-linked pricing."
Chevron,2017-6,"It's also the case that much of the demand growth for LNG will be concentrated in Asia, but that doesn't necessarily mean the region will become the hub for LNG."
Chevron,2017-6,The main problem in establishing an LNG trading hub is that the fuel isn't just simply a natural gas version of crude oil.
Chevron,2017-6,Long-term storage is problematic given the boil-off that occurs when LNG is placed in land-based tanks or on ships.
Chevron,2017-6,"While newer LNG vessels can use boil-off as fuel for the engines, it's unlikely that LNG can be stored and traded multiple times, as is currently common in crude oil."
Chevron,2017-6,"Singapore would like to become Asia's LNG hub, but this would require massive infrastructure investment and the development of a regional pipeline system that would allow LNG to be re-gasified and then transported and stored."
Chevron,2017-6,"While this may happen over time, the absence of storage and interconnecting pipelines across Asia limits the continent's chances of being the centre of the LNG universe."
Chevron,2017-6,"Rather, it's Europe with its plentiful re-gasification capacity and pipeline and storage infrastructure that can play that role."
Chevron,2017-6,"Among European countries, Spain has the best potential as an LNG hub, given its proximity to Qatar (through the Suez canal), West and North African producers and the United States."
Chevron,2017-6,"Spain has 49 million tonnes per annum in re-gasification capacity, but only 21 percent of this was being utilised in January this year, according to the IGU."
Chevron,2017-6,"Elsewhere in Europe, Britain has 35 million tonnes of re-gasification but, like Spain, only 21 percent was in use in January."
Chevron,2017-6,"In contrast Japan's 197 million tonnes of capacity had a utilisation rate of 43 percent, South Korea's 101 million tonnes was used at 35 percent and China's 49 million tonnes at 56 percent."
Chevron,2017-6,"While it's clear that the big buyers in North Asia can take more LNG, it's also obvious that Spain and Britain can take substantially more LNG."
Chevron,2017-6,"They also have the means to use the natural gas, while demand in both Japan and South Korea has been largely steady in recent years, although China is witnessing strong growth."
Chevron,2017-6,"Overall, when the rest of Australia's LNG hits the market, it will likely push more Qatari cargoes to Europe."
Chevron,2017-6,"As the U.S. LNG comes on stream, it can choose whether to got to Europe or Asia depending on the price."
Chevron,2017-6,"Europe will become the destination of last resort for an increasing number of spot LNG cargoes, meaning it gets to set the price that determines where the fuel goes."
Chevron,2017-6,"Despite being a substantially smaller market than Asia, Europe will become the kingmaker in LNG."

Chevron,2017-6,"The continent is also best-placed to use market forces to find a price level for natural gas versus its competitors, given it still has substantial coal-fired power in some countries as well as being a leader in renewables such as wind and solar."
Chevron,2017-6,"To understand Europe's role in the LNG market, it's worth examining how the dynamics of trade in the super-chilled fuel are changing with the rise of Australia and the United States."
Chevron,2017-6,"LNG has traditionally been an opaque and tightly-controlled market, where a small number of exporters signed long-term, oil-linked contracts with an equally small number of buyers, who were more concerned about energy security than price."
Chevron,2017-6,"The major producers included Qatar, Indonesia and Malaysia, while the top buyers were concentrated in North Asia, namely Japan and South Korea, and also in Europe."
Chevron,2017-6,"It was inevitable that this situation would be disrupted once global energy giants such as Chevron , Royal Dutch Shell , ConocoPhillips and Exxon Mobil decided to pour some $200 billion into developing eight new LNG projects in Australia."
Chevron,2017-6,"Three of these are ground-breaking ventures based on using coal-seam gas as feedstock, one is the biggest floating LNG project and the rest are conventional offshore gas to onshore liquefaction plants."
Chevron,2017-6,"When the last of these new plants is operating, most likely by 2018, Australia will have around 80 million tonnes of annual LNG capacity, overtaking Qatar as the top exporter of the fuel."
Chevron,2017-6,"Not far behind Australia on the development scale is the United States, with 16 million tonnes of LNG capacity already operating at the Sabine Pass facility in the Gulf of Mexico."
Chevron,2017-6,"A further 60.5 million tonnes of annual capacity is under construction, and will arrive from late in 2017 to the end of 2019, with the bulk scheduled to be commissioned in 2018."
Chevron,2017-6,"The International Gas Union (IGU), the industry's lobby group, said in its annual review in April that there was 340 million tonnes of LNG capacity as at the end of 2016, and a further 114 million tonnes under construction as of the start of this year."
Chevron,2017-6,"In some ways, LNG is the last cab off the rank in the commodity boom that saw massive capacity expansions in iron ore, coal and crude oil as part of the recovery from the 2008 global recession."
Chevron,2017-6,"Much of the investment in commodity projects was driven by the belief that China, the world's top commodity consumer and importer, would continue to soak up everything the world could throw at it."
Chevron,2017-6,"As can be seen from the five years of price declines for coal and iron ore from 2011 to 2015, this was a forlorn hope, even though China has continued to increase its imports of natural resources."
Chevron,2017-6,"LNG is equally likely to move into an oversupply situation by 2020, notwithstanding increased imports by China and the emergence of new buyers in Asia, such as Pakistan and Singapore."
Chevron,2017-6,"It's this oversupply dynamic that is changing the way LNG is traded, with buyers no longer willing to lock into long-term contracts linked to the price of crude oil."
Chevron,2017-6,"While it will take several years for these contracts to disappear entirely, buyers are having success in negotiating shorter-term deals, or even taking more spot cargoes."
Chevron,2017-6,"As a consequence, the spot price of LNG in Asia has plummeted in recent years. From a record $20.50 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) in February 2014, LNG was last at $5.40 in the week to June 23, down nearly 75 percent."
Chevron,2017-6,"The drop in Asian spot LNG prices has led them to converge with prices in Europe, with the British National Balancing Point (NBP) price actually exceeding the Asian spot price in May and June last year, according to the IGU."
Chevron,2017-6,"The difference between the two benchmarks averaged just 91 cents per mmBtu in 2016, the IGU said, showing how dramatically the Asian premium has narrowed in recent years, having been as high as $6 per mmBtu at the end of 2013."
Chevron,2017-6,"Front-month NBP futures ended at the equivalent of $4.88 per mmBtu on June 28, meaning spot the Asian LNG price commanded a premium of just 52 U.S. cents."
Chevron,2017-6,"Benchmark U.S. Henry Hub natural gas futures were at $3.067 per mmBtu on June 28, showing that the three main regional benchmarks are fairly close to each other."
Chevron,2017-6,"This becomes even more the case when the approximately $1.50 per mmBtu cost of liquefaction, already included in the spot Asian price, is added to the NBP and Henry Hub prices."
Chevron,2017-6,"The economics of the LNG market then come down to shipping costs across various routes, and it's here that Europe comes into its own."
Chevron,2017-6,"It's highly unlikely that Australian LNG will flow to the Atlantic Basin, given the long sea voyage, which adds to the cost but also increases the loss from boil-off of the LNG being shipped."
Chevron,2017-6,"This means Australian LNG will have to find a home in Asia, either among traditional buyers or emerging markets in Southeast Asia, where its geographic position gives it an advantage over Qatar and producers in Africa or the United States."
Chevron,2017-6,"The swing supplier will likely be the United States, which can ship to both Europe and Asia, as well as Latin America."
Chevron,2017-6,"It's also likely that Qatar may feel increasing pressure in Asia as it has to compete with new Australian supplies, meaning it either has to find new buyers in East Asia or push more cargoes westward to Europe."
Chevron,2017-6,The new dynamics of LNG trade can already be seen in flows around the world.
Chevron,2017-6,"In 2016, 278.9 million tonnes of LNG moved by ship globally, according to vessel-tracking and port data compiled by Thomson Reuters, a 7.6 percent hike from the 259.2 million shipped the prior year."
Chevron,2017-6,"Of that total, 41.7 million tonnes went to Europe, while 156.5 million went to North Asia, which includes Japan, South Korea and China, and 33.2 million was shipped to the rest of Asia."
Chevron,2017-6,"Back in 2013 total LNG trade stood at 243.9 million tonnes, with 38.5 million going to Europe, 151.5 million to North Asia and 17.7 million to the rest of Asia."
Chevron,2017-6,"What this shows is that Europe and North Asia grew slowly in the past four years, while emerging Asia surged on the back of rising imports by India and newer buyers such as Singapore and Pakistan, and even by traditional exporters like Malaysia."
Chevron,2017-6,Looking at the breakdown by exporting country shows that Australia has gone from shipping 23.7 million tonnes in 2013 to 46.1 million in 2016.
Chevron,2017-6,"Of Australian shipments in 2016, 39.6 million tonnes went to North Asia, up from 21.4 million in 2013."
Chevron,2017-6,"Qatar shipped 34.7 million tonnes to North Asia in 2016, down from 40.5 million in 2013."
Chevron,2017-6,"It seems clear that Australia is supplanting Qatar as the main supplier to North Asian markets, a trend that's likely to continue as the Pacific nation brings another 40 million tonnes of LNG capacity on line by 2018."
Chevron,2017-6,"Qatar has had success in boosting its shipments to the rest of Asia and to Europe, but it will also face pressure in those markets."
Chevron,2017-6,"Australia has gone from shipping 65,900 tonnes, or just one cargo, to the rest of Asia in 2013 to supplying 3.1 million tonnes in 2016, and it's likely that its producers, especially those on the northwest coast, will be trying to gain a bigger foothold in markets like India and Sri Lanka."
Chevron,2017-6,"Overall, the global LNG market is becoming more competitive, driven by increased supply and buyer demands for more flexibility."
Chevron,2017-6,"These trends are set to continue in the coming years, creating a far larger spot market and likely seeing the demise of restrictive destination clauses and oil-linked pricing."
Chevron,2017-6,"It's also the case that much of the demand growth for LNG will be concentrated in Asia, but that doesn't necessarily mean the region will become the hub for LNG."
Chevron,2017-6,The main problem in establishing an LNG trading hub is that the fuel isn't just simply a natural gas version of crude oil.
Chevron,2017-6,Long-term storage is problematic given the boil-off that occurs when LNG is placed in land-based tanks or on ships.
Chevron,2017-6,"While newer LNG vessels can use boil-off as fuel for the engines, it's unlikely that LNG can be stored and traded multiple times, as is currently common in crude oil."
Chevron,2017-6,"Singapore would like to become Asia's LNG hub, but this would require massive infrastructure investment and the development of a regional pipeline system that would allow LNG to be re-gasified and then transported and stored."
Chevron,2017-6,"While this may happen over time, the absence of storage and interconnecting pipelines across Asia limits the continent's chances of being the centre of the LNG universe."
Chevron,2017-6,"Rather, it's Europe with its plentiful re-gasification capacity and pipeline and storage infrastructure that can play that role."
Chevron,2017-6,"Among European countries, Spain has the best potential as an LNG hub, given its proximity to Qatar (through the Suez canal), West and North African producers and the United States."
Chevron,2017-6,"Spain has 49 million tonnes per annum in re-gasification capacity, but only 21 percent of this was being utilised in January this year, according to the IGU."
Chevron,2017-6,"Elsewhere in Europe, Britain has 35 million tonnes of re-gasification but, like Spain, only 21 percent was in use in January."
Chevron,2017-6,"In contrast Japan's 197 million tonnes of capacity had a utilisation rate of 43 percent, South Korea's 101 million tonnes was used at 35 percent and China's 49 million tonnes at 56 percent."
Chevron,2017-6,"While it's clear that the big buyers in North Asia can take more LNG, it's also obvious that Spain and Britain can take substantially more LNG."
Chevron,2017-6,"They also have the means to use the natural gas, while demand in both Japan and South Korea has been largely steady in recent years, although China is witnessing strong growth."
Chevron,2017-6,"Overall, when the rest of Australia's LNG hits the market, it will likely push more Qatari cargoes to Europe."
Chevron,2017-6,"As the U.S. LNG comes on stream, it can choose whether to got to Europe or Asia depending on the price."
Chevron,2017-6,"Europe will become the destination of last resort for an increasing number of spot LNG cargoes, meaning it gets to set the price that determines where the fuel goes."
Chevron,2017-6,"Despite being a substantially smaller market than Asia, Europe will become the kingmaker in LNG."

Chevron,2017-6,"LONDON/SINGAPORE, June 28 (Reuters) - Work to restart production at Australia's Woodside-operated Karratha Gas Plant, which hosts the North West Shelf liquefied natural gas (LNG) export project, is underway following a partial outage on June 24, a spokeswoman said."
Chevron,2017-6,"The spokeswoman declined to say whether there had been an impact on LNG exports. Industry sources said the outage had affected LNG exports and this was supporting spot LNG prices in Asia , which have been on a downward trend for months."

Chevron,2017-6,"TCO previously only sent LPG in transit through Ukraine to the Black Sea port of Odessa and via land border crossings to Poland and other eastern European countries, the sources said. Talks on LPG supplies to Ukraine, which became a more high-reward market in 2016 compared to traditional routes, have been held for around a year."
Chevron,2017-6,"""(They) signed a spot contract, more likely, for a month. Talks are being held about a term (long-term) contract,"" a source familiar with the negotiations told Reuters."
Chevron,2017-6,"He also said that LPG will be delivered to SOCAR Ukraine, a Ukrainian subsidiary of Azerbaijan's state oil company SOCAR."
Chevron,2017-6,"An export-parity price for LPG supplies from Russia to Ukraine was on average $105-$115 per tonne higher than to Poland in 2016 and $70-80 per tonne higher than via Black Sea ports, Reuters calculations showed."
Chevron,2017-6,"TCO's test 300-400 tonne spot railway cargo for SOCAR Ukraine will be loaded in July via the Solovey-Topoli border crossing with a premium on technical propane butane mixture on DAP Ukraine basis (Russian-Ukrainian border), traders said."
Chevron,2017-6,"The size of the premium hasn't been disclosed, but Reuters monitoring showed that the difference between average spot prices of technical propane butane mixture at the Russia-Ukraine border and those on DAP Brest basis was $8 per tonne in favour of the Ukrainian market in the first half of the year."
Chevron,2017-6,"Another confirmation that TCO will start LPG supplies to Ukraine are shippers' monthly nominations, which Thomson Reuters Eikon publishes weekly. A total of 410 tonnes of liquefied gas, including 180 tonnes of butane and 230 tonnes of propane, will be shipped from the Kulsary station in Kazakhstan to the Ukrainian station of Spartak in the first ten days of July, according to the nominations."
Chevron,2017-6,"Market participants said SOCAR Ukraine has an agreement to store liquefied gas at the Makarovskaya LPG dispensing station (Spartak station), which is managed by UPK Group, a big player on the Ukrainian wholesale and retail LPG market."
Chevron,2017-6,"TCO's LPG production rose to 595,237 tonnes in January-May this year, up 6.7 percent from a year earlier."
Chevron,2017-6,"The company also ramped up LPG exports by nine percent to 549,177 tonnes in the first five months of the year compared to the same period last year."
Chevron,2017-6,"The main export routes for TCO's LPG in the western direction in January-May 2017 are to the port of Odessa (169,079 tonnes), Poland (128,410 tonnes), the Russian port of Taman (101,940 tonnes) and Hungary (59,986)."
Chevron,2017-6,"TCO also supplies liquefied gas to China with exports reaching 44,272 tonnes in the first five months of the year."

Chevron,2017-6,"WASHINGTON, June 19 (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday handed a victory to Chevron Corp by preventing Ecuadorean villagers and their American lawyer from trying to collect on an $8.65 billion pollution judgment issued against the oil company by a court in Ecuador."
Chevron,2017-6,"The justices turned away an appeal by New York-based lawyer Steven Donziger, who has spent more than two decades trying to hold Chevron responsible for pollution in the Ecuadorean rain forest, of lower court rulings blocking enforcement in the United States of the 2011 judgment."
Chevron,2017-6,"While not disputing that pollution occurred, San Ramon, California-based Chevron has said it is not liable and that Donziger and his associates orchestrated the writing of a key environmental report and bribed the presiding judge in Ecuador."
Chevron,2017-6,"""Today's decision is an important step toward bringing this illegal scheme to a final conclusion,"" said R. Hewitt Pate, Chevron's vice president and general counsel."
Chevron,2017-6,"U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan in Manhattan barred enforcement of the judgment in 2014, citing the corruption used to obtain it. The New York-based 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last year upheld Kaplan's decision, citing ""a parade of corrupt actions"" by Donziger and his associates, including coercion and fraud, culminating in the bribe offer."
Chevron,2017-6,"The 2nd Circuit found that Chevron's $8.646 billion judgment debt was ""clearly traceable"" to corrupt conduct by the legal team representing villagers from the area affected by the pollution."
Chevron,2017-6,"The lengthy legal battle with Chevron has been waged in several countries and was documented in ""Crude,"" a 2009 documentary film. The plaintiffs have said they plan to continue efforts to enforce the judgment in other countries, including Canada, regardless of the outcome in the United States."
Chevron,2017-6,"""The Supreme Court's decision closes a chapter and will allow the global public to properly focus on the true substance of the case, which is an international judgment enforcement process - in which U.S. courts have no role - and the devastating environmental and human tragedy that both Chevron and the global community need to address,"" Donziger said in a statement."
Chevron,2017-6,"The saga has drawn extensive media attention over the years, with a succession of reporters given tours by both sides of the affected sites on the edge of the Amazonian jungle near the town of Lago Agrio. The plaintiffs also touted the backing of several celebrities including actors Mia Farrow and Danny Glover."
Chevron,2017-6,"Donziger and representatives of residents of the Lago Agrio region have sought to force Chevron to pay for water and soil contamination caused from 1964 to 1992 by Texaco, which Chevron acquired in 2001. Chevron has said a 1998 agreement between Texaco and Ecuador absolved it of further liability."
Chevron,2017-6,"Donziger's crusade began to unravel when Chevron noticed a scene in the ""Crude"" documentary, released in 2009, showing Donziger working with supposedly neutral experts in preparing a report for the Ecuadorean court."
Chevron,2017-6,"Chevron was then able to get access to out-takes and other material related to the documentary via court order. Chevron cited this evidence when it filed its lawsuit in 2011 seeking to block enforcement of the judgment, saying Donziger's actions violated U.S. anti-racketeering law."

Chevron,2017-6,{{20170619T100102.567+0000}}RPT-Mexico awaits next oil round with cautious optimism(Repeats June 16 story for wider distribution.)
Chevron,2017-6,"MEXICO CITY, June 16 (Reuters) - Mexico is looking forward to its next round of offshore oil auctions on Monday with guarded optimism thanks to robust interest from oil majors for the shallow-water tenders."
Chevron,2017-6,"On Monday, Mexico auctions 15 oil and gas blocks along the southern coastal waters of the Gulf of Mexico in the next stage of the country's historic opening of the industry following a 2013-14 energy reform."
Chevron,2017-6,In December 2013 Congress changed the constitution to end a 75-year production and exploration monopoly enjoyed by state oil company Pemex in a bid to reverse years of declining output.
Chevron,2017-6,"Among the companies that prequalified to compete are Chevron Corp , ConocoPhillips , Eni SpA , Repsol SA , Royal Dutch Shell Plc , Total SA and China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC Ltd) <0883.HK>."
Chevron,2017-6,"All told, 20 companies signed up to take part on an individual basis, with 16 consortia also on the list."
Chevron,2017-6,Energy Minister Pedro Joaquin Coldwell said he was hopeful that at least 35 to 40 percent of the blocks would be won.
Chevron,2017-6,"""The pleasing thing about this auction is the high number of consortia taking part, which is a sign there will be plenty of bids,"" he told Reuters on Friday. ""There wouldn't be much point in forming a consortium and then not making an offer."""
Chevron,2017-6,"How many blocks were snapped up would depend on whether bidding focused on just a few areas, or many, he added."
Chevron,2017-6,"The auction is the fifth since the energy reform, including one deep-water and two previous shallow-water tenders, yielding 39 contracts signed with forecast investment over the life of the contracts at $48.8 billion, according to energy ministry data."
Chevron,2017-6,"Juan Carlos Zepeda, head of the oil regulator known as CNH which oversees the auction, also saw the number of equity tie-ups among oil companies as a positive sign, expressing optimism that ""a bit more than the international benchmark of 30 percent"" could be assigned."
Chevron,2017-6,"The blocks up for auction are spread between the coastal waters of the Gulf states of Veracruz, Tabasco and Campeche, with an average size of 594 square kilometers."

Chevron,2017-6,"On Monday, Mexico auctions 15 oil and gas blocks along the southern coastal waters of the Gulf of Mexico in the next stage of the country's historic opening of the industry following a 2013-14 energy reform."
Chevron,2017-6,In December 2013 Congress changed the constitution to end a 75-year production and exploration monopoly enjoyed by state oil company Pemex in a bid to reverse years of declining output.
Chevron,2017-6,"Among the companies that prequalified to compete are Chevron Corp , ConocoPhillips , Eni SpA , Repsol SA , Royal Dutch Shell Plc , Total SA and China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC Ltd) <0883.HK>."
Chevron,2017-6,"All told, 20 companies signed up to take part on an individual basis, with 16 consortia also on the list."
Chevron,2017-6,Energy Minister Pedro Joaquin Coldwell said he was hopeful that at least 35 to 40 percent of the blocks would be won.
Chevron,2017-6,"""The pleasing thing about this auction is the high number of consortia taking part, which is a sign there will be plenty of bids,"" he told Reuters on Friday. ""There wouldn't be much point in forming a consortium and then not making an offer."""
Chevron,2017-6,"How many blocks were snapped up would depend on whether bidding focused on just a few areas, or many, he added."
Chevron,2017-6,"The auction is the fifth since the energy reform, including one deep-water and two previous shallow-water tenders, yielding 39 contracts signed with forecast investment over the life of the contracts at $48.8 billion, according to energy ministry data."
Chevron,2017-6,"Juan Carlos Zepeda, head of the oil regulator known as CNH which oversees the auction, also saw the number of equity tie-ups among oil companies as a positive sign, expressing optimism that ""a bit more than the international benchmark of 30 percent"" could be assigned."
Chevron,2017-6,"The blocks up for auction are spread between the coastal waters of the Gulf states of Veracruz, Tabasco and Campeche, with an average size of 594 square kilometers."

Chevron,2017-6,* Carbon credit hike could insulate more U.S. oil from future busts
Chevron,2017-6,"HOBBS, New Mexico, June 5 (Reuters) - Amid the frenetic activity of American shale oilfields recovering from a two-year recession sit a handful of oil towns that seemed impervious as many producers went into bankruptcy and the economy around them sank."
Chevron,2017-6,"Occidental Petroleum Corp and a few other oil producers with wells near this town on New Mexico's border with Texas steadily pumped low-cost oil through the downturn, using a technique that has been heralded worldwide as a way to reduce carbon emissions and boost oil output."
Chevron,2017-6,"""When everyone else in the oil industry was going down, Oxy kept working,"" said Joshua Grassham, vice president of Lea County State Bank and a Hobbs Chamber of Commerce board member. The city of 35,000 rests on the Permian oilfield, the largest oilfield in the United States."
Chevron,2017-6,"This way of drilling brings with it a sweetener for the oil industry to keep crude flowing: a tax credit that helps insulate these wells in a downturn, and could triple in size if Congress approves a new measure this summer."
Chevron,2017-6,"Such a move could extend by decades the producing life of hundreds more wells, increasing oil supply which would be a drag on prices. To date, the technique has been employed only at conventional oilfields, rather than on shale deposits. Some firms are studying how to put the technique to work in shale drilling, too."
Chevron,2017-6,"The drilling method harnesses the carbon dioxide produced during the extraction of oil or from power plants, and forces it back into the fields. That boosts the pressure underground and drives more oil to the surface."
Chevron,2017-6,"Their success could be replicated in oilfields across the United States if Congress approves the measure, which already enjoys broad bipartisan support. While the Trump administration has yet to say whether it supports the tax credit increase, the measure could also be a boon to the coal industry, which Trump wants to revitalize."
Chevron,2017-6,"The technique, one of several so-called enhanced oil recovery (EOR) strategies used to prolong the productive lifespan of oilfields and increase output, underpins around five percent of U.S. oil output, or about 450,000 barrels per day, according to energy consultancy Advanced Resources International."
Chevron,2017-6,"EOR can help firms to produce between 30 percent and 60 percent of all the oil held in a reservoir. That's far more than the 10 percent usually recovered from initial traditional drilling, according to the Department of Energy."
Chevron,2017-6,"The existing credit has provided a financial lift for Occidental, Denbury Resources Inc and oil producers with ready access to the gas. Exxon Mobil Corp and Chevron Corp also use the technique on some of their oil fields. None detail their tax savings from the credit, but since the it was first offered in 2008, companies have collected at least $350 million in the credits, according to Internal Revenue Service figures."
Chevron,2017-6,"In Hobbs, Occidental not only kept a 200-person workforce intact during the oil-price downturn - when tens of thousands of workers were laid off in the shale patch - it also invested $250 million to expand operations during that period, according to its public filings."
Chevron,2017-6,"That meant Hobbs and nearby Seminole, Texas, where Hess Corp has its own carbon dioxide injection facility, didn't suffer the extreme financial pain felt by shale towns, such as Williston, North Dakota, and other shale producing communities in 2015 and 2016.[nL2N17Z0ZS]"
Chevron,2017-6,"""Oxy's investment in the carbon project was a huge economic boost to our area,"" Grassham said."
Chevron,2017-6,"Some of the carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, comes from naturally occurring reservoirs that are a low-cost source for Occidental. Others get the gas piped from power plants that burn coal. Power companies hope the technique can help them avoid higher carbon emissions."
Chevron,2017-6,"The company spends about $18 to $25 per barrel to collect oil from its enhanced oil recovery operations. In contrast, its shale-focused well costs are lower - $16 to $19 per barrel. But because EOR wells pump consistently for decades, their value to the company over time exceeds shale wells, whose production quickly tapers off."
Chevron,2017-6,"Across Texas and New Mexico, Occidental runs one of the world's largest fleet of enhanced oil recovery projects, injecting 2 billion cubic feet of carbon dioxide each day into wells that first produced oil nearly a century ago."
Chevron,2017-6,"""We had a very large, stable carbon dioxide EOR business in our portfolio during the downturn,"" said Jody Elliott, president of Occidental's American operations. ""That helped."""
Chevron,2017-6,"Partly because of its carbon facilities, Occidental was able to raise its dividend during the downturn. Today, executives are using the profits from the carbon business to grow its shale business across the Permian, the largest acreage holding in the region."
Chevron,2017-6,"""These two businesses play very well off of each other,"" Elliott said."
Chevron,2017-6,"Congress is expected this summer to debate extending an existing tax credit that could pave way for wider use. The proposed Carbon Capture Utilization and Storage Act would boost the credit to $35 per metric ton of carbon dioxide, up from $10 per ton today."
Chevron,2017-6,"The legislation failed to move forward during last year's heated presidential campaign, but supporters say it will be reintroduced soon. ""We want to make sure that we show a strong commitment so we continue to develop these technologies,"" said North Dakota Senator Heidi Heitkamp, a Democrat and the bill's lead sponsor."
Chevron,2017-6,"Electricity generator NRG Energy Inc earlier this year opened a $1.04 billion carbon capture facility at a Texas coal-fired power plant, using its carbon dioxide emissions to extract crude from a 1930s-era oilfield.[nL1N1EZ1Q4]"
Chevron,2017-6,"Expanding the credit could, supporters hope, encourage more coal-fired power plants to follow NRG's lead by capturing and selling carbon to oil producers. Most oilfields are not located near carbon dioxide supplies, so the tax credit also could spur the build-out of carbon pipelines."
Chevron,2017-6,"Environmentalists, including the Sierra Club, like the process because it traps carbon underground, preventing it from contributing to greenhouse gas emissions."
Chevron,2017-6,"""You'll put more carbon in the ground than oil that is produced,"" said Vello Kuuskraa, president of consultancy Advanced Resources International, which studies enhanced oil recovery and carbon storage."

Chevron,2017-6,"Congress is expected this summer to debate extending an existing tax credit that could pave way for wider use. The proposed Carbon Capture Utilization and Storage Act would boost the credit to $35 per metric ton of carbon dioxide, up from $10 per ton today."
Chevron,2017-6,"The legislation failed to move forward during last year's heated presidential campaign, but supporters say it will be reintroduced soon. ""We want to make sure that we show a strong commitment so we continue to develop these technologies,"" said North Dakota Senator Heidi Heitkamp, a Democrat and the bill's lead sponsor."
Chevron,2017-6,"Electricity generator NRG Energy Inc earlier this year opened a $1.04 billion carbon capture facility at a Texas coal-fired power plant, using its carbon dioxide emissions to extract crude from a 1930s-era oilfield.[nL1N1EZ1Q4]"
Chevron,2017-6,"Expanding the credit could, supporters hope, encourage more coal-fired power plants to follow NRG's lead by capturing and selling carbon to oil producers. Most oilfields are not located near carbon dioxide supplies, so the tax credit also could spur the build-out of carbon pipelines."
Chevron,2017-6,"Environmentalists, including the Sierra Club, like the process because it traps carbon underground, preventing it from contributing to greenhouse gas emissions."
Chevron,2017-6,"""You'll put more carbon in the ground than oil that is produced,"" said Vello Kuuskraa, president of consultancy Advanced Resources International, which studies enhanced oil recovery and carbon storage."
Chevron,2017-6,Oxy is considering investing another $550 million in its Hobbs operation in the next several years to further expand its carbon facilities.
Chevron,2017-6,"""During all these oil industry downturns, those carbon wells keep people working,"" said Grassham."

Chevron,2017-6,"ST PETERSBURG, Russia/WASHINGTON, June 2 (Reuters) - For three years after Russia annexed Crimea, Washington officials quietly cautioned major U.S. firms about attending the annual St Petersburg forum, where investors mingle with President Vladimir Putin and his lieutenants."
Chevron,2017-6,"This year, the first forum since Donald Trump became U.S. president, such cautions were not issued, according to four people familiar with preparations for U.S. companies to attend."
Chevron,2017-6,"Washington's policy toward Russia is essentially unchanged under Trump, with the United States committed to maintaining sanctions on Moscow unless it complies with international demands about Ukraine."
Chevron,2017-6,"But its approach this year to the St Petersburg event - often described as Russia's version of the Davos forum in Switzerland - reveals a change in tone, according to some people who follow U.S.-Russia trade relations."
Chevron,2017-6,"Daniel Russell, the head of the U.S.-Russia business council, when asked if U.S. companies were feeling less pressure from the administration to stay away, said: ""I think that's right."
Chevron,2017-6,"""Some of the companies, particularly in 2015, received calls from the U.S. government not to attend and I think that attitude has certainly changed."""
Chevron,2017-6,The change in tone fits with promises Trump made during his election campaign to pursue friendlier ties with Russia.
Chevron,2017-6,"Any sign of warming toward the Kremlin is highly sensitive for the White House, since Congress and the FBI are conducting inquiries into whether members of the Trump team had improper contacts with Russian officials before Trump's inauguration. Trump has denied doing anything wrong."
Chevron,2017-6,"Asked about contacts with companies planning to attend the forum, a State Department spokesperson said: ""We have an open dialogue with the business community, and ultimately companies are free to make their own decisions, in line with applicable laws and regulations."""
Chevron,2017-6,The forum in St Petersburg was in its second day on Friday and there were signs of a more substantial U.S. presence than in previous years since the March 2014 annexation of Crimea.
Chevron,2017-6,"U.S. ambassador to Russia John Tefft was at the forum, though he did not have a speaking slot. No U.S. ambassador attended in 2014, 2015 or 2016."
Chevron,2017-6,A spokeswoman for the U.S. embassy in Moscow said his attendance was a routine part of his ambassadorial duties.
Chevron,2017-6,"Major U.S. companies who sent senior executives - including oil major Exxon, Boeing, Chevron and JPMorgan - were represented at a similar level to last year, but several delegates at the forum said they estimated the U.S. presence to be numerically bigger than in previous years."
Chevron,2017-6,"""We see a much larger number of people from the U.S., Canada,"" said Kirill Dmitriev, chief executive of the Russian Direct Investment Fund, a state body that works with foreign investors."
Chevron,2017-6,"""There is a better understanding (among foreign investors) that sanctions really did not work, the Russian economy continues to grow, Russia represents an attractive market and people should work with Russia,"" he told Reuters."
Chevron,2017-6,"Several U.S. delegates said that, politics aside, they were drawn to the forum by the fact the Russian economy had returned to growth after a slowdown."
Chevron,2017-6,"The forum is a prestige project for Putin, a native of St Petersburg. Foreign executives typically use their presence to signal to the Kremlin their enthusiasm for investing in Russia."
Chevron,2017-6,"In 2014, when the Ukraine crisis first started, U.S. cabinet officials including Secretary of State John Kerry made personal calls to chief executives of U.S. firms asking them not to attend, said a former U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity."
Chevron,2017-6,"The next year, senior U.S. officials below cabinet level were charged with persuading American executives not to attend, and in 2016, U.S. officials brought up the issue in a low-level manner, the former official said."
Chevron,2017-6,The account of those conversations was confirmed by a second former official who served in the administration of former U.S. President Barack Obama.
Chevron,2017-6,"The guidance in later years was not necessarily to stay away, but that executives who did attend should keep their presence low-key, said several other people familiar with the discussions."
Chevron,2017-6,"Ian Colebourne, who is CEO for Deloitte in the Commonwealth of Independent States and sits on the U.S.-Russia business council, said he was aware of officials giving guidance to executives in previous years, but added: ""I haven't heard anything this year."""
Chevron,2017-6,"Two other sources familiar with the preparations for U.S. companies to attend also said there had been no guidance before this year's forum, in contrast to previous years."
Chevron,2017-6,"The lack of contact from the U.S. government this year is being interpreted among business executives as meaning: ""You can go,"" said one of the two sources."
Chevron,2017-6,"The U.S. Chamber of Commerce did not receive any guidance from the administration about whether or not to participate in the event, a source with the Chamber said."
Chevron,2017-6,"Still, some companies that did attend exercised caution, keeping a low profile."
Chevron,2017-6,"The head of U.S. oil giant Exxon Mobil, Darren Woods, did not join the table of panelists at the main oil session of the forum. It was chaired by the head of Kremlin oil major Rosneft, Igor Sechin, who is on the U.S. sanctions list."
Chevron,2017-6,"Like his predecessor as Exxon CEO Rex Tillerson, now Trump's Secretary of State, Woods made only brief remarks from the floor in a discussion about the energy industry."
Chevron,2017-6,Woods declined to answer questions from Reuters. An Exxon representative said company policy was not to comment on the travel arrangements of its executives.
Chevron,2017-6,"Among other U.S. companies at the forum, JPMorgan Chase & Co., sent Daniel Pinto, Chief Executive Officer of its corporate and investment business, while Boeing sent Bertrand-Marc Allen, president of its international arm."
Chevron,2017-6,"U.S. oil major Chevron sent its vice president for business development, Jay Pryor. He was also at the forum last year. A company representative did not reply to questions about any guidance from the administration."
Chevron,2017-6,"""Let's say the seniority of some of the teams is more senior this year, certainly compared to some prior years and that's a positive sign,"" Deloitte's Colebourne said of the U.S corporate presence."
Chevron,2017-6,"Robert Dudley, chief executive of BP, a British company with substantial business in the United States, said his impression was that this year there were more representatives of U.S. companies at the forum than previously."
Chevron,2017-6,"""That would suggest they are not feeling that kind of pressure,"" to curb their presence, he said."

Chevron,2017-6,"ST PETERSBURG, Russia, June 2 (Reuters) - Russian oil major Rosneft agreed on Friday to explore and develop five fields in Iraq's Kurdistan as the company seeks to become a key player in one of the world's newest and fastest-growing oil provinces."
Chevron,2017-6,"Kremlin-controlled Rosneft this year became the first oil major to pre-finance Kurdish crude exports, an activity long dominated by trading houses, which had bankrolled the semi-autonomous region amid its fight against Islamic State and a budget crisis caused by low oil prices."
Chevron,2017-6,"On Friday, Rosneft and the government of Kurdistan signed production-sharing deals for five oil blocks, with Rosneft saying it would also aim to explore for gas in the future."
Chevron,2017-6,"Igor Sechin, Rosneft chief executive and a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, said the company was widening cooperation with Kurdistan following the first direct purchases of Kurdish oil for Rosneft's German refineries earlier this year."
Chevron,2017-6,"""The agreements ... set an example of well-weighed investments in one of the key Middle East regions, which will make it possible for the company to expand its exploration and production geography, provide feedstock for Rosneft's growing refining network and to raise profitability of our international assets,"" Sechin said in a statement."
Chevron,2017-6,"The documents were signed by Sechin and Kurdish natural resources minister Ashti Hawrami on the sidelines of Russia's main investment show, the St Petersburg International Economic Forum, where Putin was due to meet Kurdish premier Nechirvan Barzani."
Chevron,2017-6,Iraq had long opposed Kurdish independent oil sales but has lately eased its stance amid joint efforts by the regional government and Baghdad to defeat Islamic State.
Chevron,2017-6,"Rosneft and Kurdistan also said they had agreed on ""monetization of the export oil pipeline in Kurdistan"" with Rosneft getting access to the regional transportation system, which has throughput capacity of 700,000 barrels per day (bpd)."
Chevron,2017-6,"By the end of 2017, Kurdistan plans to expand the pipeline to 1 million bpd, or 1 percent of global output, betting on the arrival of new volumes from fresh developments."
Chevron,2017-6,Kurdish oil production has been mainly led in recent years by mid-sized firms including Genel. Larger companies such as Exxon Mobil and Chevron are still at the exploratory stage and have recently returned some blocks to Kurdistan after disappointing searches.
Chevron,2017-6,"Rosneft said the deals signed on Friday would allow it to talk about ""full entry in one of the most promising regions of the developing global energy market""."
Chevron,2017-6,Kurdistan estimates its recoverable reserves at 45 billion barrels of oil and 5.66 trillion cubic metres of gas.
