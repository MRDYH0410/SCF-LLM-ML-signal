Chevron,2017-9,{{20170929T200250.702+0000}}REFILE-ANALYSIS-Energy industry says 'no thanks' to Trump offer of marine sanctuaries(Corrects penultimate paragraph spelling to Michael instead of Michel)
Chevron,2017-9,"WASHINGTON/LOS ANGELES, Sept 28 (Reuters) - In a bid to boost energy development, U.S. President Donald Trump's administration is considering shrinking or eliminating 11 marine sanctuaries designed to protect 425 million acres of coral reefs, marine mammal habitats and pristine beaches."
Chevron,2017-9,"The review is part of a broader strategy to open new areas to oil and gas drilling and ""put the energy needs of American families and businesses first,"" according to the order Trump signed in April that triggered it."
Chevron,2017-9,"But interviews with energy industry representatives signal the effort will likely miss its target. Opening up these areas would likely help wind power companies - which Trump has lambasted - more than oil producers, they say. And neither industry is interested because of the high costs of offshore development, comparatively rich opportunities on land and the public relations headaches of developing protected oceanscapes."
Chevron,2017-9,The White House did not respond to a request for comment.
Chevron,2017-9,"The U.S. Commerce Department is scheduled to issue its recommendations on the sanctuaries, located in the Pacific, the Great Lakes, and the Atlantic, next month. Most public comments submitted to Commerce favored preserving existing sanctuaries."
Chevron,2017-9,"""Our members are not currently pursuing this opportunity,"" said Catherine Reheis-Boyd, the president of the Western States Petroleum Association, referring to four marine sanctuaries off California's coast that are under review."
Chevron,2017-9,"The WSPA represents major integrated companies including Exxon Mobil , BP , Chevron , and ConocoPhillips , and is focused on the region that would be most affected by the review."
Chevron,2017-9,Officials for those companies did not respond to requests for comment.
Chevron,2017-9,"Other sanctuaries under review include the Thunder Bay Sanctuary in the Great Lakes, the Northeast Canyons and Seamounts in the Atlantic, and sites off Hawaii, American Samoa, and the Northern Mariana Islands."
Chevron,2017-9,"Government offshore drilling lease data reviewed by Reuters shows the oil industry is bidding on less offshore acreage with less money than it has in years, in part because onshore reserves have become easier to tap with new drilling technology."
Chevron,2017-9,"The average price drillers have bid for available offshore drilling leases in the Central Gulf of Mexico, for example, declined to about $300 per acre this year, from more than $700 per acre in 2013."
Chevron,2017-9,"Even so, U.S. oil and gas production has surged because of the onshore boom: Production hit 8.85 million barrels per day in 2016, from 5.09 million a decade earlier, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration."
Chevron,2017-9,"""It is clear we don't need to take from every portion of our oceans and coasts to maintain a healthy energy economy,"" Democratic lawmakers on the House Natural Resources Committee wrote in July in a letter opposing the sanctuary review."
Chevron,2017-9,"Drillers' groups such as the American Petroleum Institute and the National Ocean Industries Association have expressed support for the review, mainly on the grounds that it sends a strong signal of federal support for the oil industry."
Chevron,2017-9,"Neal Kirby, a spokesman for the Independent Petroleum Producers of America, said that ""it's possible to find the appropriate balance between safety, protecting the environment, and making sure we can move forward with responsible offshore energy development."""
Chevron,2017-9,"Trump had campaigned on a promise to bolster U.S. fossil fuels production by repealing environmental rules he says unnecessarily hinder drilling and mining. So far he has moved to roll back carbon emissions limits, lift curbs on federal energy leasing, and ease permitting requirements."
Chevron,2017-9,"The Department of the Interior completed a separate but similar review in August of some 27 national monuments across the country, which include vast areas of protected land."
Chevron,2017-9,"The recommendations from that review have not been announced, but a leaked version obtained by the Washington Post showed Interior will recommend shrinking some of the monuments where energy resources are available or industries like commercial fishing and timber want more access. [nL2N1LZ0JQ]"
Chevron,2017-9,Wind industry representatives say that firms could power more than 16 million homes by erecting wind turbines on California's marine sanctuaries - but they would rather look for growth in places where such development is cheaper and less controversial.
Chevron,2017-9,"California's waters are deep, requiring costly and unproven floating wind turbine technology. Development there would likely also face onerous state regulatory hurdles and potential public opposition."
Chevron,2017-9,"""The American Wind Energy Association is not advocating for re-visiting any (marine sanctuary) designations,"" said Evan Vaughan, spokesman for AWEA. ""In general, the designations have not been a barrier to offshore wind development."""
Chevron,2017-9,"Michael Conathan, oceans policy director at the Center for American Progress, a progressive policy advocacy group, said the sanctuary review appeared to hold mostly symbolic value given the lack of oil and wind industry demand."
Chevron,2017-9,"""The reality is it is not going to happen unless something drastic happens with the economics,"" he said."

Chevron,2017-9,{{20170929T152514.918+0000}}Robust Chinese demand ensures Asian LNG rally has legs* China could overtake S.Korea as No. 2 LNG importer
Chevron,2017-9,"LONDON/SINGAPORE, Sept 29 (Reuters) - Unexpectedly strong demand from China, along with rising oil and coal prices, should keep Asian liquefied natural gas (LNG) spot levels buoyant this winter."
Chevron,2017-9,"Despite rising supplies from new plants, spot prices have risen by 55 percent from their 2017 lows to $8.40 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) as Asian buyers also refilled summer stocks."
Chevron,2017-9,"With the peak demand October-March winter gas season almost underway, further price gains are expected."
Chevron,2017-9,"Nuclear outages in Taiwan and rising demand from Thailand, as well as new buyers like Pakistan, are absorbing oversupply of LNG faster than expected, traders and analysts said."
Chevron,2017-9,"Andrew Walker, vice president of strategy at U.S. LNG exporter Cheniere, said there was ""very strong growth in China this year,"" adding that demand from Japan and South Korea was also robust."
Chevron,2017-9,"Still, while Asian LNG prices are likely to keep rising, the pace could moderate as traders say healthy stock levels and more nuclear, coal and renewable generation in top buyers Japan and South Korea could cap their winter demand."
Chevron,2017-9,"""A lot of factors are coming together, which means the market has stayed more balanced than people expected,"" Walker told Reuters during an industry event in South Korea."
Chevron,2017-9,"Higher coal prices have contributed to low power station stocks across India and China, prolonging LNG demand in countries typically unwilling to pay much above $7 per mmBtu, according to one analyst."
Chevron,2017-9,"Gail India , Gujarat State Petroleum Corporation and Reliance Industries are all seeking winter supply. [nL8N1MA2A8]"
Chevron,2017-9,"Oil prices near two-year highs are also helping lift spot LNG demand as buyers choose between 20-year, oil-indexed LNG supply or spot cargoes, whichever is cheaper."
Chevron,2017-9,"As in previous winters, Chinese imports - up 44 percent over the January-August period from a year earlier - are dictating Asian price trends. [nL3N1GG398]"
Chevron,2017-9,"Under a drive to improve air quality by switching away from coal, China could overtake South Korea as the world's second-biggest LNG importer this year if current trends continue, import data shows. [nL8N1M73KI]"
Chevron,2017-9,"Strong growth in Chinese LNG demand could be partly offset, though, by greater availability of piped gas supply from Central Asia this winter, potentially limiting price spikes on international gas markets."
Chevron,2017-9,"While spot LNG prices for November are trading higher at $8.40 per mmBtu, they are still far short of the $20 per mmBtu mark reached in February 2014 when supply was tight."
Chevron,2017-9,"Since then, 74 million tonnes per year of new production has poured out of plants in Australia and the United States, pushing down prices and bridging gaps in supply between regions, with another 89 million tonnes due by 2020."
Chevron,2017-9,"Reuters trade data shows that there is increasing spare capacity in LNG markets, meaning that the general outlook for the market remains one of oversupply and relatively low prices."
Chevron,2017-9,"""A lot of LNG is coming ... There's no doubt that will create market softening over the next two years,"" Walker said."
Chevron,2017-9,"The first exports from Australia's Wheatstone, Cove Point in the United States and Russia's Yamal facility in the Arctic are expected in the fourth quarter of 2017."
Chevron,2017-9,"However, Chevron's Wheatstone project, which had been due to start producing LNG this month, is running behind schedule, a bullish factor for prices."
Chevron,2017-9,"That, coupled with higher output from existing plants, will add 8.7 million tonnes more LNG supply this winter compared with a year ago, Anne-Kat Brevik, head LNG analyst at Thomson Reuters said."
Chevron,2017-9,"Forecasters expect winter temperatures for northeast Asia, including Japan and South Korea, to be milder than average, reducing the likelihood of a surge in winter demand from those buyers."
Chevron,2017-9,"However, outside Asia low hydro levels across Spain, Italy, Portugal and Brazil should keep Mediterranean and Atlantic demand for LNG firm during winter."
Chevron,2017-9,"European LNG supply holders are also holding onto production amid concerns about potential nuclear outages in France, low European storage inventories and curbs on Dutch output causing gas shortages."
Chevron,2017-9,"""They are worried about getting caught short if there's a repeat of last winter's nuclear power supply crisis in France,"" a trader said."

Chevron,2017-9,"HOUSTON, Sept 28 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp Vice Chairman Mike Wirth will become chief executive next February, replacing the retiring John Watson, the oil and natural gas producer said on Thursday."
Chevron,2017-9,The transition brings an executive with experience in the cost-cutting world of refining to Chevron's corner office as the industry emerges from a two-and-a-half year rout in crude prices that has squeezed revenue.[nL2N1L816B]
Chevron,2017-9,"Reuters reported the change of leadership last month, citing a source close to the matter. [nL2N1L816B]"
Chevron,2017-9,"Wirth, an engineer by training, has worked at Chevron since 1982 and previously ran the company's pipeline and chemicals and refining businesses."

Chevron,2017-9,The CEOs of rivals Total and Royal Dutch Shell also have experience in refining.
Chevron,2017-9,Chevron's board officially voted on Wednesday to give Wirth the CEO post in addition to the role of chairman.
Chevron,2017-9,Watson said he told the company's board late in 2016 he was thinking of retiring as large expansion projects near completion in Australia and Kazakhstan and the company taps more of its low-cost shale acreage in the Permian Basin.
Chevron,2017-9,"""$50 oil is not easy. But we're as well positioned as anyone else,"" Watson said."
Chevron,2017-9,"Watson, who will not hit the company's mandatory retirement age of 65 for another four years, became CEO in 2010."
Chevron,2017-9,The company's growth under him has not been painless. Chevron has struggled with cost overruns at two Australian liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects.
Chevron,2017-9,"""It's fair to say we've done some things well and there's areas we can improve,"" he said. ""But we've dramatically outperformed our peers."""
Chevron,2017-9,"He pointed out that Gorgon, one of the LNG projects, was already profitable and the other should be as it comes online later this year."
Chevron,2017-9,"Wirth will also have to contend with growing uncertainty about Chevron's operations in strife-torn Venezuela, where it is the only remaining major U.S. oil producer."
Chevron,2017-9,"""We have every intention of staying there,"" Watson said. ""Venezuela is among the leaders in (oil) reserves worldwide."""
Chevron,2017-9,"Watson said he had no plans to work for the U.S. government or elsewhere in the oil industry after retirement. He declined to say what he would do next, though said he was considering options."
Chevron,2017-9,"Last year, Watson earned $24.6 million in pay, share options and bonuses, up from $22 million in 2015. Wirth was paid $9.1 million last year, up from $8.1 million in 2015."

Chevron,2017-9,ANALYSIS-Energy industry says 'no thanks' to Trump offer of marine sanctuaries - Reuters News
Chevron,2017-9,{{20170928T145208.869+0000}}ANALYSIS-Energy industry says 'no thanks' to Trump offer of marine sanctuariesBy Valerie Volcovici and Nichola Groom
Chevron,2017-9,"WASHINGTON/LOS ANGELES, Sept 28 (Reuters) - In a bid to boost energy development, U.S. President Donald Trump's administration is considering shrinking or eliminating 11 marine sanctuaries designed to protect 425 million acres of coral reefs, marine mammal habitats and pristine beaches."
Chevron,2017-9,"The review is part of a broader strategy to open new areas to oil and gas drilling and ""put the energy needs of American families and businesses first,"" according to the order Trump signed in April that triggered it."
Chevron,2017-9,"But interviews with energy industry representatives signal the effort will likely miss its target. Opening up these areas would likely help wind power companies - which Trump has lambasted - more than oil producers, they say. And neither industry is interested because of the high costs of offshore development, comparatively rich opportunities on land and the public relations headaches of developing protected oceanscapes."
Chevron,2017-9,The White House did not respond to a request for comment.
Chevron,2017-9,"The U.S. Commerce Department is scheduled to issue its recommendations on the sanctuaries, located in the Pacific, the Great Lakes, and the Atlantic, next month. Most public comments submitted to Commerce favored preserving existing sanctuaries."
Chevron,2017-9,"""Our members are not currently pursuing this opportunity,"" said Catherine Reheis-Boyd, the president of the Western States Petroleum Association, referring to four marine sanctuaries off California's coast that are under review."
Chevron,2017-9,"The WSPA represents major integrated companies including Exxon Mobil , BP , Chevron , and ConocoPhillips , and is focused on the region that would be most affected by the review."
Chevron,2017-9,Officials for those companies did not respond to requests for comment.
Chevron,2017-9,"Other sanctuaries under review include the Thunder Bay Sanctuary in the Great Lakes, the Northeast Canyons and Seamounts in the Atlantic, and sites off Hawaii, American Samoa, and the Northern Mariana Islands."
Chevron,2017-9,"Government offshore drilling lease data reviewed by Reuters shows the oil industry is bidding on less offshore acreage with less money than it has in years, in part because onshore reserves have become easier to tap with new drilling technology."
Chevron,2017-9,"The average price drillers have bid for available offshore drilling leases in the Central Gulf of Mexico, for example, declined to about $300 per acre this year, from more than $700 per acre in 2013."
Chevron,2017-9,"Even so, U.S. oil and gas production has surged because of the onshore boom: Production hit 8.85 million barrels per day in 2016, from 5.09 million a decade earlier, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration."
Chevron,2017-9,"""It is clear we don't need to take from every portion of our oceans and coasts to maintain a healthy energy economy,"" Democratic lawmakers on the House Natural Resources Committee wrote in July in a letter opposing the sanctuary review."
Chevron,2017-9,"Drillers' groups such as the American Petroleum Institute and the National Ocean Industries Association have expressed support for the review, mainly on the grounds that it sends a strong signal of federal support for the oil industry."
Chevron,2017-9,"Neal Kirby, a spokesman for the Independent Petroleum Producers of America, said that ""it's possible to find the appropriate balance between safety, protecting the environment, and making sure we can move forward with responsible offshore energy development."""
Chevron,2017-9,"Trump had campaigned on a promise to bolster U.S. fossil fuels production by repealing environmental rules he says unnecessarily hinder drilling and mining. So far he has moved to roll back carbon emissions limits, lift curbs on federal energy leasing, and ease permitting requirements."
Chevron,2017-9,"The Department of the Interior completed a separate but similar review in August of some 27 national monuments across the country, which include vast areas of protected land."
Chevron,2017-9,"The recommendations from that review have not been announced, but a leaked version obtained by the Washington Post showed Interior will recommend shrinking some of the monuments where energy resources are available or industries like commercial fishing and timber want more access. [nL2N1LZ0JQ]"
Chevron,2017-9,Wind industry representatives say that firms could power more than 16 million homes by erecting wind turbines on California's marine sanctuaries - but they would rather look for growth in places where such development is cheaper and less controversial.
Chevron,2017-9,"California's waters are deep, requiring costly and unproven floating wind turbine technology. Development there would likely also face onerous state regulatory hurdles and potential public opposition."
Chevron,2017-9,"""The American Wind Energy Association is not advocating for re-visiting any (marine sanctuary) designations,"" said Evan Vaughn, spokesman for AWEA. ""In general, the designations have not been a barrier to offshore wind development."""
Chevron,2017-9,"Michel Conathan, oceans policy director at the Center for American Progress, a progressive policy advocacy group, said the sanctuary review appeared to hold mostly symbolic value given the lack of oil and wind industry demand."
Chevron,2017-9,"""The reality is it is not going to happen unless something drastic happens with the economics,"" he said."

Chevron,2017-9,"The U.S. oil major agreed in April to sell its three Bangladesh gas fields to Himalaya Energy, comprising state-run Chinese oil trader Zhenhua Oil and a government investment platform, CNIC Corp.

Chevron,2017-9,"BUENOS AIRES, Sept 21 (Reuters) - Argentina is behind on at least $700 million in promised subsidy payments to natural gas producers, hurting oil companies at a time when the government is trying to woo more investment in the nation's energy sector."
Chevron,2017-9,"The incentives have cost cash-strapped Argentina more than $7 billion since they were implemented in 2013 by former leftist President Cristina Fernandez. The program, unique in Latin America, is aimed at attracting investment to help boost the country's declining output and reduce its reliance on imported liquefied natural gas."
Chevron,2017-9,"Payment delays have plagued the program from its inception, but they have lengthened under President Mauricio Macri, Fernandez's business-friendly successor. He took office in December 2015 vowing to jumpstart Argentina's struggling economy and cut a primary fiscal deficit equivalent to more than 5 percent of gross domestic product."
Chevron,2017-9,"""The state does not have the money,"" said Daniel Gerold of G&G Energy Consultants in Buenos Aires. ""The companies are being patient, but they are clearly concerned because they know perfectly well that there is a significant fiscal problem."""
Chevron,2017-9,"Hardest hit is state-owned YPF SA , which produces a third of Argentina's natural gas. It was owed $551 million in unpaid subsidies at the end of the second quarter."
Chevron,2017-9,"The government is supposed to pay the gas subsidies quarterly. But payments to YPF are now 10 months in arrears, YPF Chief Financial Officer Daniel Gonzalez said in an earnings call last month. That is up from a delay of four to five months that Gonzalez reported to investors in August 2015."
Chevron,2017-9,"The lag forced YPF to raise debt in July, Gonzalez said. And it could upend the goal of the heavily-indebted company to become cash-flow neutral this year, according to an analyst covering the company."
Chevron,2017-9,"Argentina's Pampa Energia is feeling the squeeze as well. In the second quarter of 2017, the firm recorded 2.4 billion pesos, or $140 million, in uncollected payments, financial statements show. That is up from 1.6 billion pesos ($100 million) at the end of last year. Pampa did not respond to a request for comment."
Chevron,2017-9,"Two multinational oil majors are also experiencing delays of between four and eight months in receiving their subsidies, two industry sources told Reuters on the condition that the companies not be named."
Chevron,2017-9,"The tardy payments underscore the difficult balancing act Macri faces as he tries to shore up Argentina's shaky finances and polish the nation's image after a decade of populist, interventionist rule that spooked foreign investors."
Chevron,2017-9,"While he has cut back energy subsidies to families, he has retained the so-called Plan Gas incentive program for producers. Macri's administration views the payouts as crucial to attracting oil majors to Argentina, whose high labor costs and difficult logistics are a tough sell in an era of low energy prices."
Chevron,2017-9,Natural gas producers would be hard-pressed to find a better deal in terms of price. Argentina's guaranteed floor of $7.50 per million British thermal units (mBtu) for new production above a set base level is more than double the current price of $3.13 per mBtu for October natural gas futures.
Chevron,2017-9,"But the late payments are causing unease among producers already wary of political uncertainty. In a recent letter to Argentina's Energy Ministry, the Hydrocarbon Exploration and Production Chamber, an industry trade group whose members include Chevron Corp and BP Plc's Pan American Energy, said the delays ""cause great harm"" to members and are putting exploration and production activity ""at risk"", according to a copy of the document viewed by Reuters."
Chevron,2017-9,Argentina's Energy Ministry declined to comment about the letter or the subsidy delays. A spokesman for Macri's office did not respond to a request for comment.
Chevron,2017-9,"The subsidies were set to expire at the end of 2017. But Macri in January extended them, with some changes, through 2021. The government called the payments ""indispensable"" to attracting investment in Vaca Muerta, a Belgium-sized shale formation that is critical to Argentina's aim of closing its energy deficit and becoming a net oil and gas exporter. [nL1N1F00W0]"
Chevron,2017-9,"Gustavo Garcia, an economist who has published a paper on the fiscal impact of the program, said the late payments complicate the government's goal to boost production."
Chevron,2017-9,"""This program was created so that companies would invest, to give them liquidity,"" Garcia said. ""Obviously if it is delayed, it is not meeting that objective."""
Chevron,2017-9,"The lengthening delays come as the government seeks to cut spending and lower Argentina's fiscal deficit to 3.2 percent of gross domestic product in 2018, down from an expected 4 percent this year and 4.6 percent last year."
Chevron,2017-9,"Next year, companies will continue to receive a minimum price of $7.50 per mBtu for increased unconventional production in the western Patagonian province of Neuquen, where Vaca Muerta is located. That price will gradually fall to $6 per mBtu by 2021."
Chevron,2017-9,The subsidies have led to a modest increase in gas production. The country's total output rose gradually from as little as 112 billion cubic meters per day in 2014 to 122 billion this year.
Chevron,2017-9,"But it has come at a steep price for taxpayers. The government's 2016 budget initially included 11.5 billion pesos for the program ($891 million at the December 2015 exchange rate), but it ended up paying out 43 billion pesos ($2.8 billion). Macri's government says it inherited 16 billion pesos in unpaid subsidies from the Fernandez administration. Rather than paying those debts in cash, last year it gave oil companies $1.1 billion in bonds at 8 percent annual interest."
Chevron,2017-9,Economist Garcia said the 2016 subsidy bill was more than the government spent on a popular cash transfer program for children.

Chevron,2017-9,{{20170920T222052.131+0000}}UPDATE 2-California cities sue big oil firms over climate change(Adds company and Union of Concerned Scientists comments beginning in paragraph five)
Chevron,2017-9,"Sept 20 (Reuters) - California cities San Francisco and Oakland filed separate lawsuits against five oil companies on Wednesday seeking billions of dollars to protect against rising sea levels they blamed on climate change, according to public documents."
Chevron,2017-9,"The lawsuits, filed in state courts in San Francisco and Alameda Counties, alleged Chevron Corp , ConocoPhillips , Exxon Mobil Corp , BP Plc , and Royal Dutch Shell Plc , created a public nuisance and asked for funds to finance infrastructure to deal with rising sea levels."
Chevron,2017-9,"According to a news release from San Francisco city officials, the lawsuits mirror 1980s-era lawsuits against tobacco companies. They allege the oil giants ""knowingly and recklessly created an ongoing public nuisance that is causing harm now and in the future risks catastrophic harm to human life and property."""
Chevron,2017-9,"""Should this litigation proceed, it will only serve special interests at the expense of broader policy, regulatory, and economic priorities,"" said Chevron spokeswoman Melissa Ritchie."
Chevron,2017-9,"Shell said in statement the issue should be addressed by government policy and cultural change, not by courts."
Chevron,2017-9,"Exxon called the lawsuits' claims without merit, and said it would defend itself. ConocoPhillips declined to comment. BP did not respond to a request for comment."
Chevron,2017-9,"""Congress and the Trump administration are AWOL on climate change,"" said Ken Kimmell, president of the Union of Concerned Scientists, saying the courts were the appropriate venue to address rising sea levels and other climate impacts."
Chevron,2017-9,"The lawsuits are the latest in a growing body of legal action against oil companies over climate change. Prosecutors for New York and Massachusetts are investigating Exxon, for example, over the possibility it misled investors in public statements on the risks of climate change. [nL1N1J61IZ]"
Chevron,2017-9,"Marin and San Mateo counties and Imperial Beach, California, in July brought similar public nuisance and failure to warn lawsuits alleging climate change impacts. Those three lawsuits sued the same five plus other oil companies and coal producers."
Chevron,2017-9,"The cases are People of the State of California V. BP et al., San Francisco Superior Court Case No. CGC 17-561370, and People of the State of California V. BP et al., Alameda County Superior Court Case No. RG17875889."

Chevron,2017-9,"""This program was created so that companies would invest, to give them liquidity,"" Garcia said. ""Obviously if it is delayed, it is not meeting that objective."""
Chevron,2017-9,"The lengthening delays come as the government seeks to cut spending and lower Argentina's fiscal deficit to 3.2 percent of gross domestic product in 2018, down from an expected 4 percent this year and 4.6 percent last year."
Chevron,2017-9,"Next year, companies will continue to receive a minimum price of $7.50 per mBtu for increased unconventional production in the western Patagonian province of Neuquen, where Vaca Muerta is located. That price will gradually fall to $6 per mBtu by 2021."
Chevron,2017-9,The subsidies have led to a modest increase in gas production. The country's total output rose gradually from as little as 112 billion cubic meters per day in 2014 to 122 billion this year.
Chevron,2017-9,"But it has come at a steep price for taxpayers. The government's 2016 budget initially included 11.5 billion pesos for the program ($891 million at the December 2015 exchange rate), but it ended up paying out 43 billion pesos ($2.8 billion). Macri's government says it inherited 16 billion pesos in unpaid subsidies from the Fernandez administration. Rather than paying those debts in cash, last year it gave oil companies $1.1 billion in bonds at 8 percent annual interest."
Chevron,2017-9,Economist Garcia said the 2016 subsidy bill was more than the government spent on a popular cash transfer program for children.
Chevron,2017-9,"""For Argentina, it is a lot,"" he said. ""They are paying more to oil companies than to the most humble families."""

Chevron,2017-9,"Sept 20 (Reuters) - California cities San Francisco and Oakland filed separate lawsuits against five oil companies on Wednesday seeking billions of dollars to protect against rising sea levels they blamed on climate change, according to public documents."
Chevron,2017-9,"The lawsuits, filed in state courts in San Francisco and Alameda Counties, alleged Chevron Corp , ConocoPhillips , Exxon Mobil Corp , BP Plc , and Royal Dutch Shell Plc , created a public nuisance and asked for funds to finance infrastructure to deal with rising sea levels."
Chevron,2017-9,"According to a news release from San Francisco city officials, the lawsuits mirror 1980s-era lawsuits against tobacco companies. They allege the oil giants ""knowingly and recklessly created an ongoing public nuisance that is causing harm now and in the future risks catastrophic harm to human life and property."""
Chevron,2017-9,"""Should this litigation proceed, it will only serve special interests at the expense of broader policy, regulatory, and economic priorities,"" said Chevron spokeswoman Melissa Ritchie."
Chevron,2017-9,"Shell said in statement the issue should be addressed by government policy and cultural change, not by courts."
Chevron,2017-9,"Exxon called the lawsuits' claims without merit, and said it would defend itself. ConocoPhillips declined to comment. BP did not respond to a request for comment."
Chevron,2017-9,"""Congress and the Trump administration are AWOL on climate change,"" said Ken Kimmell, president of the Union of Concerned Scientists, saying the courts were the appropriate venue to address rising sea levels and other climate impacts."
Chevron,2017-9,"The lawsuits are the latest in a growing body of legal action against oil companies over climate change. Prosecutors for New York and Massachusetts are investigating Exxon, for example, over the possibility it misled investors in public statements on the risks of climate change. [nL1N1J61IZ]"
Chevron,2017-9,"Marin and San Mateo counties and Imperial Beach, California, in July brought similar public nuisance and failure to warn lawsuits alleging climate change impacts. Those three lawsuits sued the same five plus other oil companies and coal producers."

Chevron,2017-9,"BAKU/LONDON, Sept 14 (Reuters) - BP and Azerbaijan agreed on Thursday to extend into 2050 a contract to develop the ex-Soviet state's biggest oilfield cluster, a deal dubbed ""the contract of the century"" when first signed in 1994."
Chevron,2017-9,"Under the new production sharing agreement, the Azeri state energy company SOCAR will increase its share to 25 percent from 11.65 percent, while BP's stake declines to 30.37 percent from 35.8 percent. BP will remain the operator."
Chevron,2017-9,"The new contract secures large investment in Azerbaijan's oil sector for decades and a one-off bonus of $3.6 billion for the government, a welcome boost to a nation that has struggled with a sharp drop in oil prices in the past three years."
Chevron,2017-9,"""This bonus will be paid to Azerbaijan in eight tranches in the next eight years after an agreement is ratified by Azerbaijan's parliament,"" a source at SOCAR told Reuters."
Chevron,2017-9,The 1994 agreement to develop the giant Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli (ACG) fields in the Caspian Sea was transformative for Baku's political and economic development after the collapse of the Soviet Union.
Chevron,2017-9,"The new deal, whose exact terms were not disclosed, remains profitable for its partners at current oil prices of $55 a barrel, BP Chief Executive Officer Bob Dudley said in an interview. [nL5N1LV41H]"
Chevron,2017-9,"The fields produce 585,000 barrels per day, accounting for three quarters of the Azerbaijan's oil output, but production is expected to rise as the partners could invest up to $40 billion in the next 32 years, according to a statement."
Chevron,2017-9,"""There are still billions of barrels to recover and billions of dollars to invest"" in the project, said Wood Mackenzie analyst Laura Bennie."
Chevron,2017-9,"""Attention will now turn to a brand-new production platform (Azeri Central East), which will be commissioned in the 2020s,"" she said."
Chevron,2017-9,Azeri President Ilham Aliyev said the remaining oil reserves of the ACG oilfields stood at 500 million tonnes.
Chevron,2017-9,"Stakes of other firms in the consortium have also been reduced. Chevron now has 9.57 percent, Inpex <1605.T> 9.31 percent, Statoil 7.27 percent, ExxonMobil 6.79 percent, TPAO 5.73 percent, Itochu <8001.T> 3.65 percent and ONGC Videsh 2.31 percent."

Chevron,2017-9,"State-run oil company PDVSA has sought to increase exports of diluted crude oil (DCO), a blend of imported naphtha and extra heavy oil from the Orinoco Belt, Venezuela's largest producing region."
Chevron,2017-9,But declining output of other grades and problems obtaining short-term financing due to a growing risk of default and sanctions imposed by the United States have affected PDVSA's shipments to the United States in recent months. [nL2N1L31EK]
Chevron,2017-9,The closure of several Texas oil ports and refineries at the end of August ahead of Hurricane Harvey also affected the imported volumes.
Chevron,2017-9,"PDVSA and its joint ventures sent a total of 38 crude cargoes to the United States in August versus 36 in July. The August volume was 0.1 percent higher than the previous month, but 10 percent lower than in the same month of 2016."
Chevron,2017-9,"Refining firm Valero Energy was the largest receiver of Venezuelan crude in the United States last month, followed by PDVSA's U.S. unit Citgo Petroleum."
Chevron,2017-9,"U.S. refiner Phillips 66 , which in July did not receive supplies of Venezuelan oil, in August imported 121,000 bpd of Merey heavy crude, according to the data. Chevron Corp bought 103,000 bpd for its Pascagoula refinery in Mississippi."
Chevron,2017-9,"President Donald Trump's administration in August imposed sanctions intended to disrupt PDVSA and the Venezuelan government's ability to raise new debt, and banned Citgo from transferring dividends or other profits to its parent company."

Chevron,2017-9,"LONDON, Sept 12 (Reuters) - Swiss trading houses are muscling in on the global market for liquefied natural gas, until now the preserve of energy giants, and expect to grab a $10 billion share of the rapidly growing business this year."
Chevron,2017-9,"Trafigura [TRAFG.UL], Gunvor [GGL.UL], Vitol [VITOLV.UL] and Glencore are all shaking up a decades-old system dominated by Western oil majors and state energy producers which sell LNG directly to large consumers on long-term contracts."
Chevron,2017-9,"They plan 2017 shipments that will be more than triple the 2015 level, according to Reuters calculations based on figures for the four traders provided by trade sources."
Chevron,2017-9,"""The trade houses ... are not fringe players any more,"" said Trafigura's head of LNG Hadi Hallouche. ""In the next four or five years there will be a significant amount of supply contracts expiring and that will open up the market."""
Chevron,2017-9,"In the short term, the Swiss traders may prove useful to producers such as Royal Dutch Shell and state-owned Qatargas by finding new buyers in emerging markets, easing a glut that the dominant suppliers helped to create."
Chevron,2017-9,"But they are determined to challenge the LNG establishment, and have set their sights on supplying not only the fastest-growing consumers like China, India and Pakistan but also the largest, such as power utilities in Japan and South Korea."
Chevron,2017-9,"The big buyers remain largely locked into long-term deals designed to ensure the producers get a return on their multi-billion dollar LNG investments, but that won't last for ever."
Chevron,2017-9,"Traders believe they can bring greater liquidity, flexibility and efficiency to the market. ""It will be in the interest of sellers and end users to allow trading companies to compete for access to production,"" Hallouche said."
Chevron,2017-9,"Overall, the four Swiss traders expect to deliver over 25 million tonnes of LNG this year, up from seven million two years ago. Smaller rivals such as Hong Kong-based Noble Group and Dubai-based B.B. Energy should push the total above 30 million tonnes per annum (mtpa)."
Chevron,2017-9,"Many countries are hungry for gas as a lower carbon, less polluting alternative to oil and coal for generating power. With pipeline supplies either limited by capacity or impractical, LNG - where gas is cooled to a liquid for delivery by sea - has become the fastest growing traded commodity."
Chevron,2017-9,"Numerous LNG projects, conceived before the 2008 financial crisis slowed world economic growth, are starting production. Between 2015 and 2020, global supply will grow by 135 mtpa or nearly 50 percent, Bank of America Merrill Lynch forecasts, largely from plants in Australia and the United States."
Chevron,2017-9,"However, an expected leap in U.S. import demand has failed to materialise as buyers opt for gas from domestic shale deposits. The resulting glut has pushed spot prices down by 70 percent from a peak in early 2014 , giving the traders their chance to gain a foothold."
Chevron,2017-9,"""The days of producers having nice cozy 25-year supply deals with buyers won't disappear altogether,"" David Fyfe, Gunvor Group's chief economist, told Reuters. ""But what traders bring is a mechanism to absorb oversupply and find markets that traditional producers might not have considered."""
Chevron,2017-9,"LNG production is set to hit 293 million tonnes this year, according to independent LNG consultant Andy Flower. That means the traders will deliver 8.5 percent of global supply."
Chevron,2017-9,"They won't be content with this. ""I would be surprised if Swiss trade houses' share of delivered LNG didn't double in the next three years,"" said Otto Waterlander, senior oil and gas partner at McKinsey & Co. On top of supplying 50 mtpa, he forecast they may buy and sell almost double that among themselves, boosting market liquidity."
Chevron,2017-9,Over-investment in new production has undercut the producers' dominance and traders are mopping up the surplus at prices often below the cost of production.
Chevron,2017-9,"Trafigura leads by volume, expecting to deliver around 7.5 million tonnes this year, a trading source told Reuters."
Chevron,2017-9,"Gunvor will raise its LNG shipments this year substantially from the nearly four million tonnes it delivered in 2016, another source said, putting it not far behind Trafigura."
Chevron,2017-9,"Vitol plans to raise 2017 volumes to at least seven million tonnes, according to a presentation to customers earlier this year, from less than three million in 2016. Glencore's new team is to rack up around 3.5 mtpa."
Chevron,2017-9,"All four are used to working in politically complex markets involving high credit risks. So far they have concentrated on customers such as Egypt and Pakistan, countries with rapidly rising energy needs due to high population growth."
Chevron,2017-9,"Some are moving beyond trading, seeking stakes in LNG production and leasing capacity in facilities such as floating import terminals, which are far cheaper than those on dry land."
Chevron,2017-9,"""Floating terminals are nimbler, can be moved around and give buyers prompt access to LNG for however long they wish,"" said Fyfe. ""Emerging markets that may have shied away from the massive investment required for importing LNG before can now tap supplies ... for five to 10 years, encouraging more buyers to enter the market."""
Chevron,2017-9,"Trafigura and Gunvor are involved in floating terminals in Pakistan, and Gunvor struck a deal in January to supply the country for five years. [nL5N1F95J2]"
Chevron,2017-9,"Traders are also targeting more established markets. While major Chinese importers mainly have long-term contracts, a number of new players in the country such as ENN and Guanghui Energy Co Ltd are increasingly in the market for LNG."
Chevron,2017-9,"Developed economies also offer opportunities, including Britain which relies heavily on Norway for gas and Qatar for LNG. Trafigura hopes to reopen a defunct LNG import terminal in northeast England, which could also supply the continent by pipeline."
Chevron,2017-9,"Competition is stiff in securing supplies, including using the relatively untested technology of floating production platforms. [nL8N1JG58X] Last month, Gunvor beat Vitol to take output from Africa's first deepwater floating LNG project in Equatorial Guinea for 10 years."
Chevron,2017-9,"It offered to help finance state-run Sonagas's 30 percent stake in the $2 billion scheme, marking the first time a trade house has helped bankroll an LNG project. [nL5N1KQ1JE]"
Chevron,2017-9,"Gunvor is also the first trading house with access to long-term LNG supply, obtained from Russia's Yamal project, industry sources said. This will start exports later this year."
Chevron,2017-9,"Vitol has secured a multi-year supply deal with Angola's sole LNG export project, which is led by Chevron . [nL8N1LL1IQ] Originally the plant was supposed to supply the United States under long-term deals but these never materialised due to the shale gas boom and technical problems."
Chevron,2017-9,"While emerging markets offer rapid growth, Egypt, for instance, piled up payment arrears of half a billion dollars last year. Some industry figures believe similar problems will crop up among the new batch of LNG importers."
Chevron,2017-9,"Pakistan's sovereign credit rating, for instance, is deep in junk territory. By contrast Japan's JERA, a tie-up of Tokyo Electric Power Co and Chubu Electric which is the world's biggest LNG buyer, has a high investment grade rating, as does the global number two, Korea Gas Corp."
Chevron,2017-9,"""There is more credit risk but the key is to be stringent in the due diligence process when examining opportunities,"" said Fyfe."
Chevron,2017-9,"Competition is also shrinking trading margins. As recently as 2013, traders could pocket millions of dollars on a single trade but that has shrunk to about $750,000."
Chevron,2017-9,"To compensate traders are taking bigger positions in the market. Wrong-way bets, however, can mean heavy losses and unlike in oil, traders can't anchor laden tankers at sea in the hope that prices pick up because LNG slowly evaporates."
Chevron,2017-9,The Swiss also no longer have the field to themselves as national energy companies and power utilities such as Germany's RWE are expanding their own trading divisions.
Chevron,2017-9,"For example, Socar Trading, an offshoot of Azerbaijan's state oil company, is working to turn some African countries into LNG importers and has already done so with Malta."

Chevron,2017-9,"LONDON, Sept 12 (Reuters) - Swiss trading houses are muscling in on the global market for liquefied natural gas, until now the preserve of energy giants, and expect to grab a $10 billion share of the rapidly growing business this year."
Chevron,2017-9,"Trafigura [TRAFG.UL], Gunvor [GGL.UL], Vitol [VITOLV.UL] and Glencore are all shaking up a decades-old system dominated by Western oil majors and state energy producers which sell LNG directly to large consumers on long-term contracts."
Chevron,2017-9,"They plan 2017 shipments that will be more than triple the 2015 level, according to Reuters calculations based on figures for the four traders provided by trade sources."
Chevron,2017-9,"""The trade houses ... are not fringe players any more,"" said Trafigura's head of LNG Hadi Hallouche. ""In the next four or five years there will be a significant amount of supply contracts expiring and that will open up the market."""
Chevron,2017-9,"In the short term, the Swiss traders may prove useful to producers such as Royal Dutch Shell and state-owned Qatargas by finding new buyers in emerging markets, easing a glut that the dominant suppliers helped to create."
Chevron,2017-9,"But they are determined to challenge the LNG establishment, and have set their sights on supplying not only the fastest-growing consumers like China, India and Pakistan but also the largest, such as power utilities in Japan and South Korea."
Chevron,2017-9,"The big buyers remain largely locked into long-term deals designed to ensure the producers get a return on their multi-billion dollar LNG investments, but that won't last for ever."
Chevron,2017-9,"Traders believe they can bring greater liquidity, flexibility and efficiency to the market. ""It will be in the interest of sellers and end users to allow trading companies to compete for access to production,"" Hallouche said."
Chevron,2017-9,"Overall, the four Swiss traders expect to deliver over 25 million tonnes of LNG this year, up from seven million two years ago. Smaller rivals such as Hong Kong-based Noble Group and Dubai-based B.B. Energy should push the total above 30 million tonnes per annum (mtpa)."
Chevron,2017-9,"Many countries are hungry for gas as a lower carbon, less polluting alternative to oil and coal for generating power. With pipeline supplies either limited by capacity or impractical, LNG - where gas is cooled to a liquid for delivery by sea - has become the fastest growing traded commodity."
Chevron,2017-9,"Numerous LNG projects, conceived before the 2008 financial crisis slowed world economic growth, are starting production. Between 2015 and 2020, global supply will grow by 135 mtpa or nearly 50 percent, Bank of America Merrill Lynch forecasts, largely from plants in Australia and the United States."
Chevron,2017-9,"However, an expected leap in U.S. import demand has failed to materialise as buyers opt for gas from domestic shale deposits. The resulting glut has pushed spot prices down by 70 percent from a peak in early 2014 , giving the traders their chance to gain a foothold."
Chevron,2017-9,"""The days of producers having nice cozy 25-year supply deals with buyers won't disappear altogether,"" David Fyfe, Gunvor Group's chief economist, told Reuters. ""But what traders bring is a mechanism to absorb oversupply and find markets that traditional producers might not have considered."""
Chevron,2017-9,"LNG production is set to hit 293 million tonnes this year, according to independent LNG consultant Andy Flower. That means the traders will deliver 8.5 percent of global supply."
Chevron,2017-9,"They won't be content with this. ""I would be surprised if Swiss trade houses' share of delivered LNG didn't double in the next three years,"" said Otto Waterlander, senior oil and gas partner at McKinsey & Co. On top of supplying 50 mtpa, he forecast they may buy and sell almost double that among themselves, boosting market liquidity."
Chevron,2017-9,Over-investment in new production has undercut the producers' dominance and traders are mopping up the surplus at prices often below the cost of production.
Chevron,2017-9,"Trafigura leads by volume, expecting to deliver around 7.5 million tonnes this year, a trading source told Reuters."
Chevron,2017-9,"Gunvor will raise its LNG shipments this year substantially from the nearly four million tonnes it delivered in 2016, another source said, putting it not far behind Trafigura."
Chevron,2017-9,"Vitol plans to raise 2017 volumes to at least seven million tonnes, according to a presentation to customers earlier this year, from less than three million in 2016. Glencore's new team is to rack up around 3.5 mtpa."
Chevron,2017-9,"All four are used to working in politically complex markets involving high credit risks. So far they have concentrated on customers such as Egypt and Pakistan, countries with rapidly rising energy needs due to high population growth."
Chevron,2017-9,"Some are moving beyond trading, seeking stakes in LNG production and leasing capacity in facilities such as floating import terminals, which are far cheaper than those on dry land."
Chevron,2017-9,"""Floating terminals are nimbler, can be moved around and give buyers prompt access to LNG for however long they wish,"" said Fyfe. ""Emerging markets that may have shied away from the massive investment required for importing LNG before can now tap supplies ... for five to 10 years, encouraging more buyers to enter the market."""
Chevron,2017-9,"Trafigura and Gunvor are involved in floating terminals in Pakistan, and Gunvor struck a deal in January to supply the country for five years. [nL5N1F95J2]"
Chevron,2017-9,"Traders are also targeting more established markets. While major Chinese importers mainly have long-term contracts, a number of new players in the country such as ENN and Guanghui Energy Co Ltd are increasingly in the market for LNG."
Chevron,2017-9,"Developed economies also offer opportunities, including Britain which relies heavily on Norway for gas and Qatar for LNG. Trafigura hopes to reopen a defunct LNG import terminal in northeast England, which could also supply the continent by pipeline."
Chevron,2017-9,"Competition is stiff in securing supplies, including using the relatively untested technology of floating production platforms. [nL8N1JG58X] Last month, Gunvor beat Vitol to take output from Africa's first deepwater floating LNG project in Equatorial Guinea for 10 years."
Chevron,2017-9,"It offered to help finance state-run Sonagas's 30 percent stake in the $2 billion scheme, marking the first time a trade house has helped bankroll an LNG project. [nL5N1KQ1JE]"
Chevron,2017-9,"Gunvor is also the first trading house with access to long-term LNG supply, obtained from Russia's Yamal project, industry sources said. This will start exports later this year."
Chevron,2017-9,"Vitol has secured a multi-year supply deal with Angola's sole LNG export project, which is led by Chevron .

Chevron,2017-9,"ASTANA, Sept 8 (Reuters) - Kazakhstan wants oil majors led by Shell and ENI to improve their offer for ending a dispute over profit sharing in the Karachaganak gas project, Kazakh Energy Minister Kanat Bozumbayev said on Friday."
Chevron,2017-9,"Bozumbayev also told Reuters output at the giant Kashagan oil field could reach 450,000 barrels per day (bpd) from 200,000 bpd in two years under an expansion project worth $2.0 billion, which is less than half its original cost estimate."
Chevron,2017-9,"Kazakhstan filed a $1.6 billion claim against foreign firms developing the Karachaganak gas condensate field, one of the companies has said. The Energy Ministry has said the row was over calculations over each parties' share in the field output."
Chevron,2017-9,A senior state oil firm executive told Reuters this week the group of foreign firms had offered to build a gas processing plant in Kazakhstan in exchange for settling the row. [nL8N1LO4U0]
Chevron,2017-9,"Bozumbayev refused to disclose details of the consortium's offer, but said Kazakhstan considered it insufficient."
Chevron,2017-9,"""We have calculated the value of the offer to Kazakhstan and it does not meet our demands and we have already told that to consortium members,"" he said in an interview."
Chevron,2017-9,"""We have asked the consortium to offer something in addition,"" Bozumbayev said, adding that moving ahead with a new gas processing plant required talks with Russia, which now processes some Kazakh gas."
Chevron,2017-9,"He said Kazakhstan would stick to its commitments to supply natural gas to a plant in the Orenburg, Russia and which is operated by Gazprom , Russia's biggest gas producer."
Chevron,2017-9,"Eni and Shell each own 29.25 percent of the Karachaganak project in northwest Kazakhstan, which they jointly operate. Kazakhstan's KazMunayGaz owns 10 percent, Chevron Corp has 18 percent and Lukoil owns 13.5 percent."
Chevron,2017-9,"Regarding Kashagan, the minister said gas reinjection facilities were being tested to help lift output from the field, after its launch last year more than a decade late."
Chevron,2017-9,"He said output would rise to 300,000-370,000 barrels per day (bpd) by the end of this year, and could climb to 450,000 bpd if plans for an expansion project proceeded."
Chevron,2017-9,"The development consortium which includes Eni , Total , Shell and ExxonMobil is working on expansion plans to be presented next year. China's CNPC and Japan's Inpex <1605.T> are also shareholders."
Chevron,2017-9,"Bozumbayev said the initial $4.7 billion cost of the expansion had been cut to $2.0 billion. ""If Kazakhstan approves it, the project can be implemented very quickly,"" he said."
Chevron,2017-9,"With more output, Kashagan might need more shipping routes in addition to the CPC and Transneft pipelines that run through Russia."
Chevron,2017-9,"Another possible route for oil from Kashagan would be the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) pipeline, which runs from Azerbaijan to Turkey via Georgia. Kashagan oil could be fed into BTC after being shipped across the Caspian Sea by tankers."
Chevron,2017-9,"The minister said shipments to China were not yet possible, although he said that could change in future."

Chevron,2017-9,"NEW YORK, Sept 7 (Reuters) - Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi said on Thursday her office had received 45 complaints of inflated prices at Chevron Corp branded gasoline stations in the southern part of the state, as shortages worsened ahead of Hurricane Irma's expected U.S. landfall this weekend."
Chevron,2017-9,"More than 1,800 gas stations - more than a quarter of the state's total - were without fuel late Thursday, up from 1,200 Wednesday, ahead of Irma, which is battering the Caribbean with winds at speeds of around 185 miles per hour (300 km per hour). The storm is expected to hit Florida on Sunday. [nL2N1LO0AA]"
Chevron,2017-9,"Gasoline prices in Florida have risen sharply in the last week, with the average cost of a regular gallon of gas hitting $2.725 on Thursday, according to motorists advocacy group AAA. Suppliers and terminal operators said demand has soared as motorists in coastal areas flee."
Chevron,2017-9,"Shortages were more acute in southern Florida, according to Gasbuddy.com. More than 40 percent of stations in the Miami-Fort Lauderdale area were without fuel and around 30 percent were empty in the West Palm Beach-Fort Pierce areas, said Patrick DeHaan of Gasbuddy.com."

Chevron,2017-9,"HOUSTON, Sept 7 (Reuters) - Monster Hurricane Irma has shut down oil terminals across the northern Caribbean, worsening a fuel supply crunch in Latin America which is struggling to meet demand since Hurricane Harvey disrupted shipments from the U.S. Gulf Coast last month."
Chevron,2017-9,"Latin America had been scrambling for almost two weeks to find oil cargoes because of Harvey, which caused massive flooding in Texas and Louisiana, shutting down ports, refineries and production platforms."
Chevron,2017-9,"Irma, which is being followed by two hurricanes in the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico, was affecting Caribbean refineries, terminals and storage facilities."
Chevron,2017-9,The U.S. National Hurricane Center said Irma is the strongest hurricane ever recorded in the Atlantic Ocean and one of the five most forceful storms to hit the Atlantic basin in 82 years.
Chevron,2017-9,"The Caribbean has the capacity to store more than 100 million barrels, which is crucial for those nations because of limited ability to refine crude, and also as supply for South American nations including Brazil, Venezuela and Colombia."
Chevron,2017-9,"Several oil trading firms had moved a portion of their U.S. fuel inventories to the Caribbean ahead of Harvey so they could keep selling cargoes to Latin America, traders from two companies told Reuters."
Chevron,2017-9,"Those barrels are now locked in terminals in St. Eustatius, Puerto Rico, the Bahamas and the U.S. Virgin Islands, as Irma, a Category 5 storm with winds of 185 mph (295 kph), was expected to hammer the region for several more days as it moves west-northwest."
Chevron,2017-9,"""Irma is arriving at a bad moment. Not all oil storage facilities in the Caribbean have closed, but vessel traffic is difficult in the middle of the storm. It will get worse before getting any better,"" said a trader from an oil firm that rents tanks in St. Croix."
Chevron,2017-9,"Buckeye Partners LP , the largest owner of oil storage facilities in the Caribbean with 41.1 million barrels of capacity, shut its Puerto Rico terminal on Wednesday. It also plans to close BORCO, its largest terminal in the Bahamas that can store up to 26.2 million barrels, by the end of the day on Thursday, a source familiar with terminal operations said."
Chevron,2017-9,"Also in the Bahamas, Statoil's South Riding Point terminal was open on Thursday, the company said. But traders added that plans to halt marine operations would likely start later on Thursday."
Chevron,2017-9,"NuStar Energy LP , which on Tuesday closed its 13-million-barrel Statia terminal on the small island of St. Eustatius, said several tanks and other equipment were damaged in the hurricane, so no restart date has been set.[nL2N1LO154]"
Chevron,2017-9,"Firms using tanks in closed terminals in St. Eustatius, St. Croix, Bahamas and Puerto Rico include traders Vitol, Glencore , Novum Energy and Freepoint Commodities, and oil firms PDVSA from Venezuela, China's Sinopec <600028.SS>, Russia's Rosneft and Lukoil , U.S. Chevron Corp and Royal Dutch Shell Plc , according to the sources and Reuters vessel data."
Chevron,2017-9,"As traders worry about Irma's impact on inventories, others see longer-term potential consequences from this or other storms, as both Jose, now in the Atlantic Ocean, and Katia, off Mexico's coast, continued moving on Thursday after strengthening to hurricanes."
Chevron,2017-9,"""If a hurricane with Irma's intensity strikes a terminal tank farm, the force of the storm at the eye wall will have destructive impact on the storage tanks, which are typically not designed to withstand those forces,"" said Ernie Barsamian, chief executive officer of the Tank Tiger, a terminal storage clearinghouse."
Chevron,2017-9,"Mexican state-run oil company Pemex said on Thursday that its facilities have not been hit so far, but it keeps monitoring Katia's path to decide if further action was needed."
Chevron,2017-9,"Fuel importers such as Mexico and Brazil have secured supplies in recent days from the U.S. East Coast, Europe and the Caribbean, according to traders, regulators and oil firms. [nE1N11Z02G]"
Chevron,2017-9,But those options are running short amid growing regional demand and limited offers from Texas refiners as ports have been slow to reopen for large vessels. [nL2N1LN1YL]
Chevron,2017-9,"The only option that traders see for desperate buyers in the coming days is to divert fuel cargoes from countries such as Brazil, which bought diesel in excess, or Venezuela, which cannot pay for all the fuel floating near its ports because of the country's fiscal problems."

Chevron,2017-9,"HOUSTON, Sept 5 (Reuters) - Texas takes another step toward recovery from Hurricane Harvey on Tuesday when many residents return to work for the first time since the storm devastated the Houston area, killing around 60 people and putting tens of thousands into emergency shelters."
Chevron,2017-9,"Many large Texas employers, universities and transit services are reopening or beginning full service on Tuesday after Labor Day, some for the first time since Harvey struck the state on Aug. 25."
Chevron,2017-9,"Oil refineries, pipelines and shipping channels in the nation's energy center have begun a gradual return of operations."
Chevron,2017-9,"Exxon Mobil , Halliburton and Chevron are among the scores of Houston businesses reopening their doors to office workers. Texas A&M University in Corpus Christi and the University of Houston also are resuming classes Tuesday."

Chevron,2017-9,"Texas residents who fled to Austin, San Antonio and Dallas ahead of the storm returned to check on their homes as flooded streets drained."
Chevron,2017-9,"In Houston, travel north and east of the city eased over the weekend and highways filled as more gasoline stations opened and supplies, while tight, proved adequate."
Chevron,2017-9,"Exxon said its Spring, Texas, campus was unaffected by the heavy rains. But employees who need to work remotely are encouraged to do so, spokeswoman Suann Guthrie said."

Chevron,2017-9,"LONDON, Sept 4 (Reuters) - Angola's sole liquefied natural gas (LNG) export facility will begin delivering shipments to commodity trader Vitol [VITOLV.UL] later this year under a deal announced on Monday, a project spokeswoman said."
Chevron,2017-9,"Angola LNG, which has steadied output following lengthy outages in recent years, has guaranteed Vitol access to supply for the first time, part of a wider shift in which trading companies are taking a greater share of the LNG market."
Chevron,2017-9,"""Deliveries will start later this year, but the terms of this agreement are commercially confidential,"" an Angola LNG spokeswoman said."
Chevron,2017-9,"In a global first, LNG from Angola has been entirely sold via competitive tenders into the spot market, partly because the plant's original plan of shipping LNG to the United States fell through following that country's shale gas boom."
Chevron,2017-9,Concerns over the plant's reliability as well as limitations on feed gas supplies from offshore fields also prevented the Chevron-led project from locking-in a mid-term LNG sales deal immediately.
Chevron,2017-9,Output from Angola LNG stabilised this year with production on track to hit up to 3.5 million tonnes in 2017 compared with 0.77 million tonnes in 2016.
Chevron,2017-9,"Though improved, it will still fall short of the plant's 5-million-tonnes/year design capacity."
Chevron,2017-9,"Vitol, alongside trading rival Trafigura [TRAFG.UL], was already the biggest buyer of Angolan cargoes on the spot market, trade and industry sources said."
Chevron,2017-9,"Vitol could use its new-found Angolan volumes to help cover a 10-year obligation to supply South Korea's Korea Midland Power Co. [KEPCOM.UL] with 400,000 tonnes of LNG annually, or to grow its share of the spot market."
Chevron,2017-9,A 70-percent drop in spot LNG prices since April 2017 and a growing supply overhang has given trading houses room to manoeuvre as established players from producers to oil majors turned to traders as a flexible source of demand.
Chevron,2017-9,"In August, Gunvor [GGL.UL] beat Vitol to bag a 10-year deal giving it up to 2.2 million tonnes of LNG annually from Africa's first deepwater floating LNG export project in Equatorial Guinea."
Chevron,2017-9,"""Coupled with Gunvor's entry into Equatorial Guinea's LNG project, we're now seeing the traders committing to multi-year deals with producers for the first time,"" independent LNG consultant Andy Flower said."
Chevron,2017-9,"""This brings a new class of medium and long-term buyers into the market at a time when more traditional buyers are reluctant to enter into new term contracts because of their commitments to increasing supply from projects in Australia and the United States,"" Flower added."
Chevron,2017-9,"Claudio Steuer, director of energy consultancy SyEnergy, said Vitol's entry into Angola LNG - backed by some of the world's biggest oil companies - reflects tough operating conditions for Big Oil, facing a glut of new LNG supply competing for finite demand."
Chevron,2017-9,"Chevron has a 36.4 percent share in Angola LNG, while Angolan state oil firm Sonangol has 22.8 percent. Other stakeholders include Total , BP and ENI ."

Chevron,2017-9,"HOUSTON, Sept 1 (Reuters) - Damage and delays from Tropical Storm Harvey will hold the U.S. oil industry back from achieving a targeted 10 million barrels per day of production anytime soon, according to analysts, a setback in America's fight for global market share with OPEC."
Chevron,2017-9,"The storm, which flooded refineries, wells and pipelines across Texas, added to a string of problems oil companies already faced, like low crude prices and expensive engineering challenges at new shale wells. [nL2N1LG1DG]"
Chevron,2017-9,"Earlier this year, oil analysts and some company executives had anticipated that the United States could top the 10 million bpd mark by year-end. That would have been a 14 percent increase, taking U.S. output to a level not seen since the 1970s."
Chevron,2017-9,"But then Harvey knocked out about a quarter of U.S. refining capacity and shuttered transport routes for crude, gasoline, diesel and other products. The storm's impacts sent gasoline prices soaring but also crimped demand for crude. [nL2N1LI0GW][nL2N1LH0T8]"
Chevron,2017-9,Bringing all that infrastructure back to normal operations could take weeks or months.

Chevron,2017-9,{{20170831T110001.566+0000}}NAFTA nations plan talks progress under barrage of Trump threatsBy Dave Graham
Chevron,2017-9,"MEXICO CITY, Aug 31 (Reuters) - Trade negotiators plan to take small steps forward in a second round of talks to rework the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) this weekend, trying to ignore daily threats from U.S. President Donald Trump to tear it up if he does not get his way."
Chevron,2017-9,"Trump has used Twitter, press conferences and speeches to attack NAFTA in recent days, a ploy Mexican and Canadian officials regard as a negotiating strategy to wring concessions, but which has heightened uncertainty over the accord."
Chevron,2017-9,"""Hopefully we can renegotiate it, but if we can't, we'll terminate it and we'll start all over again with a real deal,"" Trump told cheering workers at a factory in Missouri on Wednesday, as Mexico's foreign and trade ministers met their U.S. counterparts in Washington to keep relations on track."
Chevron,2017-9,"Away from the diplomatic noise, trade experts from the three NAFTA nations hope to advance the revamp during the five days of talks in Mexico that start on Friday by working through areas of greater consensus before turning to trickier issues."
Chevron,2017-9,"""We want to see positive signs of progress at the negotiating tables,"" said Moises Kalach, head of the international negotiating arm of Mexico's CCE business lobby, which is leading the private sector in the talks. ""Hopefully we'll get it, even if it doesn't have to be stated publicly. Hopefully we'll start getting closure on some issues."""
Chevron,2017-9,"Overall, the Mexican round, which follows talks two weeks ago in Washington, is expected to define more clearly the priorities of each nation rather than yield major breakthroughs."
Chevron,2017-9,"The emergence of detailed positions on the tougher points looks less likely in this round, officials said."
Chevron,2017-9,"Kalach and one Mexican negotiator, who spoke on condition of anonymity, saw broad agreement between the NAFTA members on how to improve conditions for small businesses, as well as in salvaging elements of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade accord that Trump ditched after taking office."
Chevron,2017-9,"Some consensus was forged between the three countries when the TPP was finalized in 2015 on issues including the environment, anti-corruption, labor rules and digital trade."
Chevron,2017-9,"More divisive issues that could enter the talks range from exploring the scope to raise NAFTA content requirements for autos to the contested U.S. demand to scrap the so-called Chapter 19 dispute settlement mechanism for resolving complaints about illegal subsidies and dumping, officials say."
Chevron,2017-9,"A key plank of the U.S. strategy is how to reduce its trade deficit with Mexico, which has sent negotiators scrambling for creative ways to rebalance trade, Kalach said."
Chevron,2017-9,"One hope is that Mexico's incipient oil and gas sector opening will result in more imports and infrastructure investment from U.S. companies, some of which have already entered the market, such as Exxon Mobil Corp and Chevron Corp."
Chevron,2017-9,"Folding that reform into NAFTA in a way that would make any attempt to unwind it politically costly for a future Mexican government would give U.S. and Canadian investors more security, Kalach and the Mexican negotiator said."
Chevron,2017-9,"The risk the reform will stall has preoccupied officials in the region because the current front-runner for Mexico's July 2018 presidential election, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, opposed the opening of the energy industry."
Chevron,2017-9,"""The best thing (the United States and Canada) can do is protect NAFTA because this essentially protects their investments,"" said Kalach."
Chevron,2017-9,"Trump has accused Mexico and Canada of being ""very difficult"", and officials from both countries say his words come as little surprise given his confrontational negotiating style."
Chevron,2017-9,"Still, Mexico's government has touted a back-up plan, seeing a ""high risk"" that NAFTA could unravel.[nL2N1LF14H]"
Chevron,2017-9,Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Tuesday shrugged off the threats and Canadian officials close to the process said they remained fully focused on the talks.
Chevron,2017-9,"""There are always going to be words thrown about here and there but ... we will continue to work seriously and respectfully to improve NAFTA to benefit not just Canadians but our American and Mexican friends as well,"" Trudeau said."
Chevron,2017-9,"A spokeswoman for U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) Robert Lighthizer declined to comment directly on how Trump's comments would affect the talks. However, trade experts say they are unlikely to foster a spirit of cooperation."
Chevron,2017-9,"""I think his tweets and statements are just complicating what's already a difficult negotiation,"" said Wendy Cutler, a former deputy USTR and lead U.S. negotiator for the TPP."
Chevron,2017-9,"""I think it will embolden the naysayers in Canada and Mexico who don't want to move in certain areas by telling the negotiators, 'don't move on these issues because the president has already said he probably won't sign off on this deal'""."
