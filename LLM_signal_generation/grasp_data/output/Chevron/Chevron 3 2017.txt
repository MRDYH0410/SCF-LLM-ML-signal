Chevron,2017-3,"{{20170331T173319.303+0000}}UPDATE 1-Venezuela court move may facilitate Russian investment, spook other oil majors(Recasts headline, adds context, link)"
Chevron,2017-3,March 31 (Reuters) - The sight of Venezuela's National Assembly president tearing up a Supreme Court ruling and warning foreign firms against making deals with the leftist government will no doubt resonate in international boardrooms.
Chevron,2017-3,"The ruling ripped up by Congress head Julio Borges on Thursday was designed to allow President Nicolas Maduro to create oil ventures without congressional approval, easing investment in the cash-strapped country's floundering oil industry."
Chevron,2017-3,"And it may well facilitate deals with companies including Russia oil major Rosneft , which Reuters reported earlier this month had been offered a stake in an oil joint venture with Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA [PDVSA.UL] as part of a broader deal with Caracas' key ally. [nL2N1GT1M4]"
Chevron,2017-3,"But the ensuing muddy legal framework and international outcry is likely to further raise anxiety levels at foreign oil companies already nervous about buying oil field stakes in Venezuela because of the country's shaky finances, as well as stricter regulatory scrutiny at home, according to oil executives, lawyers, and other industry sources."
Chevron,2017-3,"Under the Venezuelan constitution, Congress must approve contracts of ""national public interest"" with foreign companies. But the Supreme Court just ruled Congress does not have a say over joint ventures anymore, while lawmakers retort the top court is illegitimate, creating a legal maze."
Chevron,2017-3,"That bodes poorly for Venezuela's ravaged economy, which depends on oil shipments for over 90 percent of its export revenue as millions skip meals due to food shortages and roaring inflation. [nL2N1GR0O1] [nL2N1GZ2BS]"
Chevron,2017-3,"""This complicates any investment decision,"" said a Caracas-based source at a foreign oil company that partners with PDVSA, asking to remain anonymous because the person was not allowed to speak to media."
Chevron,2017-3,"Still, Russia is becoming an increasingly crucial financier for isolated Maduro at a time when many other foreign companies were already reluctant to pour money into Venezuela given the poor business climate and debts."
Chevron,2017-3,"And should Venezuela manage to pull off further sales or loans with Rosneft, that could help Venezuela make some $2.5 billion in bond payments due in April and shoulder other operational costs."
Chevron,2017-3,"But while Venezuela may receive a short term boost from the decision, in the long-term foreign oil companies will likely be stymied from potential further investments in the country with the world's biggest crude reserves."
Chevron,2017-3,"PDVSA and the oil ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Rosneft declined to comment, as did U.S. major Chevron Corp , which has four joint venture operations with PDVSA."
Chevron,2017-3,"Spain's Repsol, which last year extended a $1.2 billion credit line to bolster a joint venture it has with PDVSA, also declined to comment. [nL2N1CD1CC]"
Chevron,2017-3,"Other foreign oil companies operating in Venezuela, including state-run China National Petroleum Corp <601857.SS>, did not immediately respond to a request for comment."
Chevron,2017-3,"But for the low-profile foreign oil companies which remain in Venezuela despite a wave of nationalizations and company exits, the Supreme Court ruling is another worry amid complex currency controls, a brain drain, and out-of-control crime."
Chevron,2017-3,Many companies were already concerned about Venezuela's legal framework after the opposition took control of the National Assembly in January 2016 and warned oil majors that investment deals affecting national interest required their approval.
Chevron,2017-3,"When Rosneft bought a stake in the Petromonagas joint venture early last year, the National Assembly slammed the purchase as ""illegal"" because it bypassed the legislature. Rosneft responded that the deal was legal."

Chevron,2017-3,"""External forces should not add fuel to the fire to the conflict inside Venezuela,"" the Russian government said."
Chevron,2017-3,"Some companies may also be betting that they would have enough muscle to negotiate with a hypothetical opposition-led government in the future to ""legalize"" any purchases made without the congressional green light, sources say."
Chevron,2017-3,"But the recent Supreme Court move is unlikely to assuage the fears of foreign partners who have strict internal compliance and legal guidelines, especially as protests and international condemnation grow. [nL2N1H80DA]"

Chevron,2017-3,* Top LNG buyers to work together to get flexible LNG contracts
Chevron,2017-3,"(Recasts, adds background on buyers' clubs, producer comments, Qatar official, detail on WTO and market impact)"
Chevron,2017-3,"SEOUL/TOKYO/MILAN, March 23 (Reuters) - The world's biggest liquefied natural gas (LNG) buyers, all in Asia, are clubbing together to secure more flexible supply contracts in a move which shifts power to importers from producers as oversupply grows."
Chevron,2017-3,"Korea Gas Corp (KOGAS) said on Thursday it had signed a memorandum of understanding in mid-March with Japan's JERA and China National Offshore Oil Corp (CNOOC) to exchange information and ""cooperate in the joint procurement of LNG."""
Chevron,2017-3,"Together, the three companies purchase a third of global LNG production, giving them a strong hand to challenge restrictive contract terms that have squeezed buyers' finances."
Chevron,2017-3,"Influential buyers' clubs are largely unheard of in commodity markets where it is the producers, such as the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), who wield power, enforcing production quotas to manage prices."
Chevron,2017-3,"A painful period of high LNG prices before 2014 left Asian importers scrambling to contain losses and led to the first talks between India, Japan, South Korea, China and Taiwan about joint purchases."
Chevron,2017-3,"Several joint LNG-buying deals have been set up since then but none approach the scale of the latest agreement, which is the first involving the game's biggest players."
Chevron,2017-3,"Under Thursday's agreement, the buyers aim to extract concessions from producers that would give them supply flexibility, such as having the right to re-sell imports to third parties, something they are not allowed to do currently under so-called destination restrictions."
Chevron,2017-3,"""We have created a platform to share, discuss and solve our common issues such as traditional LNG business practices, including destination restrictions,"" said JERA spokesman Atsuo Sawaki."
Chevron,2017-3,"The alliance of three big buyers across three countries will put pressure on exporters such as Qatar, Australia and Malaysia. They prefer to have clients locked into fixed supply contracts which run for decades and make buyers take fixed amounts of monthly volumes irrespective of demand, with no right to re-sell surplus supplies to other end-users."
Chevron,2017-3,"The agreement has been helped by the fact the power wielded by OPEC is unparalleled in the commodities world. Attempts to create an OPEC-style body through the Gas Exporting Countries Forum has failed to gain traction because gas and LNG markets are more fragmented than oil, while similar moves in coffee, railroads, rubber and tin have all collapsed over the decades."
Chevron,2017-3,"The LNG market is undergoing huge changes as the biggest ever flood of new supply is hitting the market, with volumes coming mainly from Australia and the United States."
Chevron,2017-3,"JERA, KOGAS and CNOOC will all struggle with having excess supplies in the next few years, sources at three major LNG producers told Reuters, curbing the consortium's ability to strike any new deals this decade."
Chevron,2017-3,"Reworking existing deals, however, is feasible and may hit the world's biggest producer Qatar the hardest as many of its mid-term supply deals with Japan start to expire from around 2023, industry sources said."
Chevron,2017-3,A senior Qatar Petroleum official hinted that buyers - emboldened by temporarily oversupplied markets to demand better terms - may come to regret their actions when the cycle turns.
Chevron,2017-3,"""Right now the market is over-supplied but if we went into a period of a tighter market, how would these buyers organisations hold up? That is an important question,"" the official said."
Chevron,2017-3,"""If there is a market crunch and gas tightens it could recreate incentives for buyers to lock in long-term contracts."""
Chevron,2017-3,"More practically, the deal complements the buying habits of each company - KOGAS largely buys for winter, CNOOC for summer and JERA across both seasons - offering opportunities for swapping cargoes, industry sources said."
Chevron,2017-3,"""Flexibility is becoming critical for LNG buyers ... as the rise of solar capacity is going to make consumption of LNG more seasonal,"" said Kerry Anne Shanks, head of LNG research for Asia/Pacific at Wood Mackenzie."
Chevron,2017-3,"New production has resulted in global installed LNG capacity of over 300 million tonnes a year, while only around 268 million tonnes of LNG were traded in 2016, according to Thomson Reuters data."
Chevron,2017-3,That has helped pull down Asian spot LNG prices by more than 70 percent from their 2014 peaks to $5.65 per million British thermal units (mmBtu).
Chevron,2017-3,"It has also given importers more suppliers to choose from, putting pressure on major producers like Royal Dutch Shell , Chevron , ExxonMobil and Woodside Petroleum to grant more flexible contract terms."
Chevron,2017-3,"Companies forming cartels are difficult to challenge at the World Trade Organization, which does not have rules about anti-competitive behaviour and only governs trade relations between member countries. But WTO rules do oblige state-run firms to trade on commercial and non-discriminatory terms."
Chevron,2017-3,"Thomas Cottier, a law professor and senior research fellow at the World Trade Institute at the University of Bern, said the LNG alliance may or may not comply with the WTO rules."
Chevron,2017-3,"""To the extent that governments are directly or indirectly involved, it may violate rules on state trading or the prohibition to encourage voluntary export restraints. However, conduct of private companies is subject to domestic anti-trust law and is not part of WTO law,"" he told Reuters by email."
Chevron,2017-3,"Even if an LNG supplier such as Qatar, Russia or Australia launched a dispute at the WTO, several other major gas producers such as Iran and Turkmenistan are not members of the WTO and therefore have no right to have their complaints heard there."

Chevron,2017-3,"BOSTON, March 23 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump's White House has said his plans to slash environmental regulations will trigger a new energy boom and help the United States drill its way to independence from foreign oil."
Chevron,2017-3,"But the top U.S. oil and gas companies have been telling their shareholders that regulations have little impact on their business, according to a Reuters review of U.S. securities filings from the top producers."
Chevron,2017-3,"In annual reports to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, 13 of the 15 biggest U.S. oil and gas producers said that compliance with current regulations is not impacting their operations or their financial condition."
Chevron,2017-3,"The other two made no comment about whether their businesses were materially affected by regulation, but reported spending on compliance with environmental regulations at less than 3 percent of revenue."
Chevron,2017-3,"The dissonance raises questions about whether Trump's war on regulation can increase domestic oil and gas output, as he has promised, or boost profits and share prices of oil and gas companies, as some investors have hoped."
Chevron,2017-3,"According to the SEC, a publicly traded company must deem a matter ""material"" and report it to the agency if there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable investor would consider it important."
Chevron,2017-3,"""Materiality is a fairly low bar,"" said Cary Coglianese, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania who runs the university's research program on regulation. ""Despite exaggerated claims, regulatory costs are usually a very small portion of many companies' cost of doing business."""
Chevron,2017-3,"The oil majors' annual filings come after the industry and its political allies have spent years criticizing the Obama administration for policies aimed at reducing fossil-fuel consumption, curtailing drilling on federal lands and subsidizing renewable energy."
Chevron,2017-3,Trump promised during the campaign that a rollback of the Democratic administration's policies would help free the nation from reliance on imported oil.
Chevron,2017-3,"""Under my presidency, we will accomplish complete American energy independence,"" said Trump, describing regulation as a ""self-inflicted wound."""
Chevron,2017-3,"The Trump administration is now preparing an executive order - dubbed the ""Energy Independence"" executive order - to roll back Obama-era regulations, which could be signed as early as this month, according to administration officials."
Chevron,2017-3,"U.S. presidents have aimed to reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil since the Arab oil embargo of the 1970s, which triggered soaring prices. But the United States still imports about 7.9 million barrels of crude oil a day - almost enough meet total oil demand in Japan and India combined."
Chevron,2017-3,The Trump administration's attacks on regulation have been applauded by the oil industry.
Chevron,2017-3,"""We haven't seen 3 percent growth in the economy for eight years, and I think part of the reason is that we've had a heavy dose of regulation,"" Chevron Corp. CEO John Watson said at CERAWeek, a global energy conference in Houston this month."
Chevron,2017-3,"Continental Resources CEO, Harold Hamm, who advised Trump on energy issues during his campaign for the White House, told the Republican National Convention in Cleveland in July that stripping regulation could allow the country to double its production of oil and gas, triggering a new ""American energy renaissance."""
Chevron,2017-3,"Yet Continental's annual report, filed last month with the SEC, says environmental regulation - after eight years under the Obama administration - does not have a ""material adverse effect on our operations to any greater degree than other similarly situated competitors."""
Chevron,2017-3,Continental's competitors who reported actual spending on environmental compliance told investors that such expenses amount to a small percentage of operating revenues.
Chevron,2017-3,Fourteen of the 15 companies whose filings were reviewed by Reuters declined to comment on their statements to investors or the impact of regulation on their profits.
Chevron,2017-3,A spokesman for ConocoPhillips acknowledged that regulatory compliance has not had a material adverse impact on the company's liquidity or financial position. But red tape can be an unwelcome burden nonetheless.
Chevron,2017-3,"""Changing, excessive, overlapping, duplicative and potentially conflicting regulations increase costs, cause potential delays and negatively impact investment decisions, with great cost to consumers of energy,"" the spokesman, Daren Beaudo, said in a written statement."
Chevron,2017-3,The American Petroleum Institute - which represents the U.S. oil and gas industry - also declined to comment.
Chevron,2017-3,"Last month, before the U.S. Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, API President Jack Gerard said that the oil and gas industry has surged forward despite onerous regulations under the Obama administration."
Chevron,2017-3,"""Technological innovations and industry leadership have propelled the oil and gas industry forward despite the unprecedented onslaught of 145 new and pending federal regulatory actions targeting our industry."""
Chevron,2017-3,"Though the industry saw a staunch opponent in Obama, oil and gas production soared more than 50 percent during his presidency. That was mainly because of high oil prices and improved hydraulic fracturing, a drilling technology that has allowed producers to access new reserves in previously tough-to -reach shale formations."
Chevron,2017-3,The rush of production ultimately contributed to a global glut that dropped crude oil prices from a high of over $100 a barrel in early 2014 to a low of nearly $25 by 2016. Current prices hover near $50 a barrel.
Chevron,2017-3,"Four of the 15 companies reviewed by Reuters reported that spending on environmental matters - including new equipment or facilities, as well as fines and compliance staffing - amounted to a small fraction of revenues."
Chevron,2017-3,"Exxon Mobil reported spending $4.9 billion worldwide in 2016, or about 2.24 percent of gross revenue. Occidental Petroleum , a much smaller company, reported spending $285 million, or about 2.82 percent of revenue. Neither addressed whether the spending was ""material"" in their filings."
Chevron,2017-3,"Two other companies, ConocoPhillips and Chevron, also broke out their environmental spending while reporting that regulation had no material impact on their business. Conoco spent $627 million in 2016, or about 2.57 percent of gross revenue, while Chevron spent $2.1 billion, or 1.91 percent of gross revenue."
Chevron,2017-3,"The other 11 companies did not break out spending, but all of them told the SEC that environmental regulation did not have a material impact on their business."
Chevron,2017-3,"In one typical statement, EOG Resources , one of the biggest U.S. producers, told investors in a report filed last month: ""Compliance with environmental laws and regulations increases EOG's overall cost of business, but has not had, to date, a material adverse effect on EOG's operations, financial condition or results of operations."""
Chevron,2017-3,"Devon Energy Corp , Anadarko Petroleum Corp , Pioneer Natural Resources Co , Apache Corp , and other large U.S.-focused oil and gas drillers used similar wording."
Chevron,2017-3,"Still, Obama's exit - and Trump's win over Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in November - has been enough to brighten the outlook of some big investors."
Chevron,2017-3,"""I believe the absence of a negative is a positive,"" John Dowd, who manages several energy funds at Fidelity Investments, wrote in his 2017 energy outlook. ""The market has been concerned with the sustainability of fracking, and particularly to what extent it might have been regulated into obscurity by a different election outcome."""
Chevron,2017-3,Clinton had said during her campaign that she planned to increase regulation on fracking.
Chevron,2017-3,"Other segments of the energy industry, such as coal mining and oil refining, were harder hit by environmental protection measures during Obama's presidency. Several coal companies went bankrupt in recent years and blamed Obama's climate change initiatives for raising costs and hurting demand."
Chevron,2017-3,Refiners have also long complained that environmental regulations have stymied attempts to build new refineries and that they have borne the brunt of costly rules requiring them to blend biofuels into their gasoline.
Chevron,2017-3,"The abundance of cheap natural gas is seen as the biggest obstacle to reviving coal country, since both fuels compete for space in the furnaces of U.S. power plants. For refiners, the key driver for profitability is the differential between the price of their raw material, crude oil, and the fuels they make with it."
Chevron,2017-3,"""Supply and demand are the fundamental forces driving markets,"" said Coglianese, the University of Pennsylvania law professor. ""Regulation is relatively trivial."""

Chevron,2017-3,"HOUSTON, March 22 (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell plc, Chevron Corp and Exxon Mobil Corp signaled the oil industry's return to the Gulf of Mexico's deep waters with high bids in a government auction up 76 percent over a year ago."
Chevron,2017-3,"The auction of offshore oil and gas parcels received nearly $275 million in high bids, compared with $156.4 million a year ago. The year-ago auction drew the fourth lowest total bids for leases in the central Gulf."
Chevron,2017-3,"The oil industry had moved away from deep water projects as oil prices fell and regulatory scrutiny increased following the Deepwater Horizon disaster in April 2010, the largest accidental marine oil spill. The five-month-long spill, which spewed some 210 million U.S. gallons (780,000 m3) into the Gulf, caused extensive damage to marine and wildlife habitats, as well as to the area's fishing and tourism industries, forcing BP to sell assets worth of billions of dollars."
Chevron,2017-3,"Wednesday's auction was the first under President Donald Trump, who has promised to cut permitting and regulatory hurdles in support of energy exploration."
Chevron,2017-3,"Shell and Chevron each had 20 high bids, and Shell's $55.8 million total was the largest among the 26 companies submitting offers. Norway's Statoil ASA was the second-largest total bidder with $44.5 million, followed by Hess Corp , Chevron and Exxon."
Chevron,2017-3,"""Today's strong sale reflects continued industry optimism and interest in the Gulf's Outer Continental Shelf, Department of Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said in a statement."
Chevron,2017-3,"The highest bid on a single block this year, from Shell, was for $24 million, almost twice last year's $13.6 million top offer. Among other top bidders, Exxon submitted 19 high bids totaling nearly $22 million, and Anadarko Petroleum had 16 high bids totaling nearly $19 million."
Chevron,2017-3,The bids will be evaluated for the next 90 days by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management and winners disclosed following the review.
Chevron,2017-3,"Interest in new deep-water projects is heating up with more favorable costs for drilling rigs, services and production equipment. Shell has cut its well costs by at least 50 percent and reduced logistics costs by three quarters, helping make deep-water projects affordable at crude prices under $50 a barrel."

Chevron,2017-3,"CARACAS/HOUSTON, March 16 (Reuters) - Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA has offered Russian counterpart Rosneft a stake in a joint venture in the country's Orinoco Belt extra-heavy crude area, five industry sources said, in a sign of the Latin American nation's dire economic situation and Moscow's growing muscle there."
Chevron,2017-3,"Rosneft , Russia's top oil producer, has been offered a 10 percent stake in the Petropiar joint venture."
Chevron,2017-3,Two sources said the offer was part of a larger package offered to Rosneft as PDVSA seeks to raise money to pay suppliers and bond holders.
Chevron,2017-3,It is unclear if Rosneft will accept the offer. Financial details of the potential transaction were not immediately available.
Chevron,2017-3,PDVSA and Venezuela's Oil Ministry did not respond to requests for comments. Chevron and Rosneft declined to comment.
Chevron,2017-3,"A deal would see California-based Chevron working alongside state-owned Rosneft, which has been affected by U.S. sanctions against Russia."
Chevron,2017-3,"But Chevron's main concern is that accounting and transparency laws are less strict in Russia than in the United States, a source close to the matter said."
Chevron,2017-3,"The proposal highlights Venezuela's need for cash after the nation's oil output fell about 10 percent last year, according to the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. This has worsened a recession that has millions of Venezuelans skipping meals amid food shortages and spiraling inflation."
Chevron,2017-3,The opposition-controlled National Assembly says President Nicolas Maduro's unpopular government is resorting to surreptitiously selling strategic assets to weather the unprecedented crisis.
Chevron,2017-3,"""Any deal of national interest must be approved by the National Assembly,"" tweeted lawmaker Jose Guerra, head of congress' finance commission, in reaction to Reuters' article. ""If PDVSA sells 10 (percent) of Petropiar to Rosneft, that sale is null and void."""

Chevron,2017-3,"Last year, the company paid $500 million to increase its stake in the Petromonagas joint venture from 16.7 percent to 40 percent, the maximum foreign partners are allowed to have under oil sector regulations created under late leader Hugo Chavez."

Chevron,2017-3,"The Petromonagas sale also raised the ire of the National Assembly, which said the purchase was illegal because Congress did not approve it. Critics have also said the stake was sold too cheaply."
Chevron,2017-3,"In another controversial move, PDVSA last year used 49.9 percent of its shares in coveted U.S. subsidiary Citgo as collateral for loan financing from Rosneft."
Chevron,2017-3,"PDVSA said this month it had received $1.985 billion from an unnamed client in return for future oil shipments, with Citgo shares used as a guarantee."

Chevron,2017-3,"PORT HARCOURT, Nigeria/LONDON, March 16 (Reuters) - The moment a group of Nigerian contractors met executives from Italian oil major Eni to discuss unpaid wages they started shouting, calling them fraudsters and liars until a police commander restored calm."
Chevron,2017-3,"Wenenda Mpi, local manager of Eni unit Agip, blamed the payment delays on debts owed by the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), a view shared by an Eni spokesman in Rome, and said the government had promised to sort the problem out."
Chevron,2017-3,"The heated meeting, called after hundreds of Eni contractors threatened a protest that police feared could turn violent, highlights the challenge of stabilising the Niger Delta oil region, even though attacks on oil facilities have halted."
Chevron,2017-3,"Militants were persuaded to stop the attacks by promises of more investment and jobs from visiting officials including Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, a technocrat who stood in for President Muhammadu Buhari this year while he had seven weeks of medical treatment in London."
Chevron,2017-3,That has helped restore output to close to its former level 2.2 million barrels a day (bpd) from the 1.15 million bpd it hit last year. But it is unclear how long the calm will last.
Chevron,2017-3,"Protests like that against Eni in the region's biggest city Port Harcourt are common, partly because low global oil prices mean oil firms are firing hundreds of workers and cutting back on contractors such as welders, security guards and cooks."
Chevron,2017-3,"The Eni contractors showed up on time at the city's police headquarters for the meeting brokered by a local police commander, and tempers were high by the time three Agip managers and the police boss arrived more than an hour later."
Chevron,2017-3,"""We are giving Agip a two week ultimatum to pay all outstanding debt,"" said Clement Adaminegbe, head of contractors at Agip, threatening unspecified further action. ""In case of failure we will take a clear stand."""

Chevron,2017-3,"Osinbajo has proposed legalising illegal oil refineries to ensure employment for angry youths who often join militants, although a military campaign to hunt them down has continued."
Chevron,2017-3,The future of the fragile peace will depend on whether the government follows up on such proposals at a time when Africa's biggest economy is hit by its first recession in 25 years.
Chevron,2017-3,"State oil firm NNPC has been planning for two years to pay back funds owed to oil majors for joint oil operations. The government said in December a remaining $5.1 billion would be paid back in five years, a time scale which means tensions over payments on the ground will likely continue."
Chevron,2017-3,"An Eni spokesman said payment delays from NNPC had been accumulating for 15 years, but they expected repayments to resume this year."
Chevron,2017-3,"A spokesman for Eni said 90 percent of its Nigerian subsidiary's workforce were already based in the Delta. A spokesperson for Shell's Nigeria unit said they had no such plans, Chevron and Exxon declined to comment on any relocation."
Chevron,2017-3,"The oil swamps are home to 40 ethnic groups competing for a share of oil money, a major obstacle to reaching an agreement that would put a permanent end to attacks on oil facilities."
Chevron,2017-3,"Villages fight for contracts, forcing oil firms to recruit only their youth as guards or risk pipelines being blown up by rejected hires. Or they demand firms to buy food or cement from them and block passage of vehicles if they bring in supplies from other villages, oil workers say."
Chevron,2017-3,"""The issue of surveillance contracts is not working well, we will revisit it,"" the Agip manager said at the meeting, referring to security contracts with host communities."
Chevron,2017-3,"The protesters handed the Agip delegation a list of 16 demands including a cash payment of 10 million naira ($32,000) to ""demobilise"" the planned protest. They also want to get 60 percent of future work tendered by Agip. Eni said its contracts were awarded on a competitive basis."

Chevron,2017-3,"The sources, who asked not to be named because they are not authorized to speak publicly on the subject, said many of the companies reached by the administration had said they would prefer the United States remain in the pact, but would also support reducing U.S. commitments in the deal."
Chevron,2017-3,"The accord, agreed by nearly 200 countries in Paris in 2015, would limit planetary warming in part by slashing carbon dioxide and other emissions from the burning of fossil fuels.

Chevron,2017-3,"Conoco CEO Ryan Lance similarly said he favored the U.S. remaining in the Paris agreement, during CERAWeek comments last week, in part because it could create opportunities for its natural gas operations and its investments in carbon-capture and storage."

Chevron,2017-3,"Exxon Mobil Chief Executive Darren Woods recently called the pledges that came out of the Paris agreement an ""effective framework"" for dealing with emissions, and pointed to Exxon's own work to cut its carbon emissions."
Chevron,2017-3,"Rex Tillerson, Exxon's former CEO and now U.S. Secretary of State, also supported remaining a part of the climate change discussion during his confirmation hearing.

Chevron,2017-3,"Conoco CEO Ryan Lance similarly said he favored the U.S. remaining in the Paris agreement during CERAWeek comments last week.

Chevron,2017-3,"SYDNEY/TOKYO, March 15 (Reuters) - Inpex's $37 billion Ichthys Australian liquefied natural gas project was hit by another subcontractor dispute, involving the termination of more than 600 workers, but the Japanese company said it was still on schedule for a July-September start."
Chevron,2017-3,"Members of a consortium building LNG storage tanks at the onshore site of Ichthys near Darwin are in dispute with each other and have stopped work, with one of them abruptly letting go 640 workers, said JKC Australia LNG, which is handling overall construction of the project, on Wednesday."

Chevron,2017-3,"Five of the largest publicly traded oil companies - BP , Chevron , Exxon Mobil , Royal Dutch Shell , and Total - are trying to work down debts that totaled $297 billion at the end of December. That nearly doubled the companies' 2012 debt levels."
Chevron,2017-3,"But even with oil prices about 70 percent higher than a year ago, most companies have yet to reach the point where their cash flow covers annual shareholder payouts and expansion projects vital to the industry's long-term survival."

Chevron,2017-3,"For now, U.S. producers are taking advantage of the price increase spurred by OPEC's production cuts to boost their output. Some of the oil they are pumping would not have been profitable at $40 a barrel, but is with prices holding steady above $50."
Chevron,2017-3,"The industry is betting that prices will maintain a delicate balance - high enough to repair balance sheets and finance new projects, but not so high that it creates a new glut."
Chevron,2017-3,"If crude maintains a price in the mid-$50s per barrel, the biggest oil producers could see their cash flows increase by 71 percent on average over 2016, according to Citigroup."
Chevron,2017-3,"The danger is that too many wells could come back online too soon, undercutting OPEC's effort to reduce global inventories. That could send prices back to the 12-year lows of early 2016."

Chevron,2017-3,"The gains are driven largely by the OPEC output cut in November - the first in eight years. The agreement to reduce supply by about 1.8 million barrels a day runs through June, and OPEC and Russia are expected to review the cut in May."
Chevron,2017-3,"Some analysts expect the agreement to be extended, but the cartel could just as easily resume higher production, squelching the industry's nascent financial recovery.[nL8N1G737L]"

Chevron,2017-3,"Unlike the major producers, U.S. shale companies are better equipped to live with volatility. When prices rise, they ramp up drilling and lock in returns with price hedges, which Chevron, Exxon and other large producers typically don't do."
Chevron,2017-3,"When prices fall, shale producers can more easily cut spending than the majors because of their small size."
Chevron,2017-3,Shale producers' ability to pour more of their new cash into production is feeding technology developments that allow them to squeeze more oil out of existing wells and at a faster pace than a few years ago.[nL1N1DU2DQ]

Chevron,2017-3,"It was a tough task, with analysts critical of the company's ability to sustain growth. Of 25 Wall Street analysts tracking Exxon, only five recommend buying its shares, less than a third of the 17 who advise buying Chevron's shares, according to Thomson Reuters data."
Chevron,2017-3,"""Darren Woods did an effective job in laying out the story, but he was hamstrung by his predecessor's mistakes and the market's increasingly skeptical sentiment on the stock,"" Raymond James analyst Pavel Molchanov said."

Chevron,2017-3,"Exxon touted short-term projects in North Dakota and Texas, while pointing to larger endeavors in Russia, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Angola and Canada slated to come online later this year."

Chevron,2017-3,"Woods, who previously ran Exxon's refining unit, defended the company's integrated business model, which twins oil exploration and production with refining. Refining profits typically rise when oil prices fall, which has helped lift Exxon's results in the past year."
