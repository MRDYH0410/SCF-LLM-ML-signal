Chevron,2017-2,"LUANDA, Feb 22 (Reuters) - U.S. energy company Chevron is in talks with the Angolan government and state oil firm Sonangol to revise tax terms and any future investment will hinge on those talks, a senior company official was quoted as saying on Wednesday."

Chevron,2017-2,{{20170221T174930.580+0000}}Wall Street challenges U.S. regulator over proposed commodities ruleBy Olivia Oran
Chevron,2017-2,"Feb 21 (Reuters) - Wall Street is pushing back against a proposed rule to force U.S. banks like Goldman Sachs Group Inc to hold more capital against investments in commodities, placing what some see as an overly restrictive limit on banks' ties to the sector."
Chevron,2017-2,"In a comment letter filed late on Friday and not yet made public, the industry argues the proposed rule would hurt the economy, and that fears about environmental risks from physical commodities activities are overblown."
Chevron,2017-2,"The U.S. Federal Reserve handed down the proposal in September, after a public backlash stemming from the belief that big banks' involvement in commodities markets hurt consumers by driving up prices."
Chevron,2017-2,"The comment letter, filed by the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association and the Institution of International Bankers and seen by Reuters, comes as big banks face an uncertain future in Washington. Even though President Donald Trump has said he favors deregulation and has hired several Wall Street executives as advisers, it is unclear how he or the new Congress will approach various rules."
Chevron,2017-2,"Apart from Goldman Sachs, few banks have large exposure to physical commodities any longer. At one time, it was a big and lucrative business for both Goldman and Morgan Stanley , due to a quirk in their regulatory structure. Other banks, including JPMorgan Chase & Co , eventually plunged into the business as well, but exited as global capital requirements got more onerous, making such investments too costly to maintain."
Chevron,2017-2,"The Fed's proposed rule would formalize and increase those standards, imposing what it has called a 1,250 percent risk weighting on banks that own, trade and move physical commodities. Among other measures, $1 in capital would need to be held for every $1 investment, the regulator's highest charge for the riskiest investments."
Chevron,2017-2,"The rule could potentially force banks to withdraw from the commodities business altogether, because such capital charges would severely depress returns."
Chevron,2017-2,"In its proposal, the Fed said new measures would shield banks and the broader financial system from a costly mishap like the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. Advocates say the rule is also needed to help mitigate commodity price fluctuations and social conflicts that arise from commodity-related activities."
Chevron,2017-2,"In the letter filed on Friday, the bank-affiliated groups said the rule would hurt ""competition, end users, the liquidity of commodities markets ... and thus the real economy."" A number of utility and power companies, including Calpine Corp , have also cited liquidity and price concerns."
Chevron,2017-2,"Big banks have been using similar arguments in lobbying to roll back existing rules, including the Volcker rule limiting risky, speculative trading and the Durbin rule, which caps the fees they can charge retailers for processing debit card transactions. [nIFR8tqrNf] [nL1N1FT1R2]"
Chevron,2017-2,Industry sources say the fight against the Fed's proposal is more about regaining a competitive edge than protecting an existing source of revenue.
Chevron,2017-2,"Between 2007 and 2009, commodities trading accounted for as much as one-fifth of revenue for Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs."
Chevron,2017-2,"But over the past five years, Morgan Stanley has decreased its physical commodity assets to $179 million from $9.7 billion. Goldman Sachs has shed much of its energy infrastructure as well, though it is still a major trader of fossil fuels, trading more natural gas than both Chevron Corp and ExxonMobil Corp in certain quarters, according to Natural Gas Intelligence."
Chevron,2017-2,"As regulated banks have scaled back, specialists like Glencore Plc , Vitol Group and Mercuria Energy Group have gained ground."

Chevron,2017-2,Feb 17 (Reuters) - U.S. shale producers are facing their first production cost increase in five years in 2017 as industry activity picks up and energy service providers hike fees to take a bigger share of the profits generated by higher oil prices.
Chevron,2017-2,Drilling innovations over the past decade have generated a dizzying reduction in the cost of pumping oil from shale formations across the United States - the world's largest energy consumer - triggering an energy revolution and a production boom.
Chevron,2017-2,"When that boom ended with the onset of a two-year global price war in 2014, shale producers responded with even deeper cost cuts. Technological breakthroughs allowed producers to wring more oil from the rock and halved the per-barrel price needed to turn a profit."
Chevron,2017-2,"But for the first time since 2012, shale producers will see a rise in break-even production costs this year, according to data from Rystad Energy, which surveys producers. The per-barrel costs will rise an average of $1.60 across the shale patch to $36.50."
Chevron,2017-2,"The drive to lower costs has run its course for now, and service firms are leveraging power in the more crowded oilfields, such as the Permian basin in West Texas, to eke out higher payments from producers."
Chevron,2017-2,"Firms that supply rigs, crews, technological expertise are clamoring to take back discounts they extended during the slump, in some cases asking for between 10 percent and 15 percent more as the number of rigs and crews deployed in the fields rises."
Chevron,2017-2,"""In the Permian, activity has picked up, and going forward we would expect to see some pressure,"" Chevron Corp's Chief Executive John Watson said on an earnings call last month."
Chevron,2017-2,"Oil service providers acknowledge, however, that their price hikes may not stick until drillers generate enough demand to burn through the remaining spare capacity in the oil service sector."
Chevron,2017-2,"In a securities filing on Feb. 8, service provider Baker Hughes Inc cautioned that drilling ""activity needs to increase meaningfully before excess service capacity can be substantially absorbed and meaningful pricing recovery takes place."""
Chevron,2017-2,"Service inflation represents only a fraction of the expected rise in international crude prices this year. A Reuters poll of 31 analysts and economists forecast benchmark U.S. oil prices will average $56.08 per barrel in 2017, up from $43.47 last year."
Chevron,2017-2,"Between half and two-thirds of the cost savings achieved during the oil price slump are likely to become permanent even if oil prices tick higher, according to industry experts and company estimates."
Chevron,2017-2,"Shale companies deployed more rigs than they have done in sixteen months last week [nL1N1FT11T], and have steadily increased the number in the field to take advantage of crude prices that have mostly held at more than $50 per barrel since the world's top oil exporters, both OPEC and non-OPEC, agreed to cut supplies in late November."
Chevron,2017-2,"A further rise in the oil price could quickly stir drilling activity across the United States, which would in turn accelerate service fee and labor cost inflation. That is a worrying development for an industry that has lately gotten used to costs heading only down."
Chevron,2017-2,"There were 207 hydraulic fracturing fleets at work in January across the U.S., up 20 percent from last June, according to data from Houston-based Primary Vision, which tracks oilfield service equipment usage."
Chevron,2017-2,"Pioneer Natural Resources Co has its own fracturing crews, which it hopes will help offset rising service costs elsewhere."
Chevron,2017-2,"""I believe we will be able to keep our inflation numbers down to more like approximately 5 percent, but the internal plan is to make sure that cost inflation is offset by our efficiency gains,"" Pioneer Natural Chief Executive Tim Dove said on a post-earnings call earlier this month."
Chevron,2017-2,"Other companies have locked in contracts to insulate themselves from the rise in service and labor costs. WPX Energy, a leading shale oil producer in North Dakota and Texas, has sought to protect against price inflation through contracts for sand, stimulant, equipment and services, said CEO Rick Muncrief in an interview."
Chevron,2017-2,Other companies including Hess Corp hope to beat the inflation forecasts with yet more efficiency gains.
Chevron,2017-2,"Hess hopes to wring more barrels out of each well with new techniques that allow it to conduct hydraulic fracturing at 60 spots along a well, up from the usual 50, president Greg Hill said on a conference call last month."
Chevron,2017-2,"In addition, using more sand and other proppants - used to keep fissures in shale rock open - in the wells should help boost production, Hill said."
Chevron,2017-2,"But the possibility of more deep cost reductions are, for the most part, gone."
Chevron,2017-2,"A number of companies saw break-even costs at the wellhead - the price required to profit from oil at a new well - stagnate between the third and fourth quarters, data from Rystad Energy showed."
Chevron,2017-2,"""To certain producers, there's a little bit of opportunity to lower costs more,"" said Bill Costello, a portfolio manager at Westwood Holdings Group. ""But those are few and far between."""

Chevron,2017-2,Feb 17 (Reuters) - U.S. shale producers are facing their first production cost increase in five years in 2017 as industry activity picks up and energy service providers hike fees to take a bigger share of the profits generated by higher oil prices.
Chevron,2017-2,Drilling innovations over the past decade have generated a dizzying reduction in the cost of pumping oil from shale formations across the United States - the world's largest energy consumer - triggering an energy revolution and a production boom.
Chevron,2017-2,"When that boom ended with the onset of a two-year global price war in 2014, shale producers responded with even deeper cost cuts. Technological breakthroughs allowed producers to wring more oil from the rock and halved the per-barrel price needed to turn a profit."
Chevron,2017-2,"But for the first time since 2012, shale producers will see a rise in break-even production costs this year, according to data from Rystad Energy, which surveys producers. The per-barrel costs will rise an average of $1.60 across the shale patch to $36.50."
Chevron,2017-2,"The drive to lower costs has run its course for now, and service firms are leveraging power in the more crowded oilfields, such as the Permian basin in West Texas, to eke out higher payments from producers."
Chevron,2017-2,"Firms that supply rigs, crews, technological expertise are clamoring to take back discounts they extended during the slump, in some cases asking for between 10 percent and 15 percent more as the number of rigs and crews deployed in the fields rises."
Chevron,2017-2,"""In the Permian, activity has picked up, and going forward we would expect to see some pressure,"" Chevron Corp's Chief Executive John Watson said on an earnings call last month."
Chevron,2017-2,"Oil service providers acknowledge, however, that their price hikes may not stick until drillers generate enough demand to burn through the remaining spare capacity in the oil service sector."
Chevron,2017-2,"In a securities filing on Feb. 8, service provider Baker Hughes Inc cautioned that drilling ""activity needs to increase meaningfully before excess service capacity can be substantially absorbed and meaningful pricing recovery takes place."""
Chevron,2017-2,"Service inflation represents only a fraction of the expected rise in international crude prices this year. A Reuters poll of 31 analysts and economists forecast benchmark U.S. oil prices will average $56.08 per barrel in 2017, up from $43.47 last year."
Chevron,2017-2,"Between half and two-thirds of the cost savings achieved during the oil price slump are likely to become permanent even if oil prices tick higher, according to industry experts and company estimates."
Chevron,2017-2,"Shale companies deployed more rigs than they have done in sixteen months last week [nL1N1FT11T], and have steadily increased the number in the field to take advantage of crude prices that have mostly held at more than $50 per barrel since the world's top oil exporters, both OPEC and non-OPEC, agreed to cut supplies in late November."
Chevron,2017-2,"A further rise in the oil price could quickly stir drilling activity across the United States, which would in turn accelerate service fee and labor cost inflation. That is a worrying development for an industry that has lately gotten used to costs heading only down."
Chevron,2017-2,"There were 207 hydraulic fracturing fleets at work in January across the U.S., up 20 percent from last June, according to data from Houston-based Primary Vision, which tracks oilfield service equipment usage."
Chevron,2017-2,"Pioneer Natural Resources Co has its own fracturing crews, which it hopes will help offset rising service costs elsewhere."
Chevron,2017-2,"""I believe we will be able to keep our inflation numbers down to more like approximately 5 percent, but the internal plan is to make sure that cost inflation is offset by our efficiency gains,"" Pioneer Natural Chief Executive Tim Dove said on a post-earnings call earlier this month."
Chevron,2017-2,"Other companies have locked in contracts to insulate themselves from the rise in service and labor costs. WPX Energy, a leading shale oil producer in North Dakota and Texas, has sought to protect against price inflation through contracts for sand, stimulant, equipment and services, said CEO Rick Muncrief in an interview."
Chevron,2017-2,Other companies including Hess Corp hope to beat the inflation forecasts with yet more efficiency gains.
Chevron,2017-2,"Hess hopes to wring more barrels out of each well with new techniques that allow it to conduct hydraulic fracturing at 60 spots along a well, up from the usual 50, president Greg Hill said on a conference call last month."
Chevron,2017-2,"In addition, using more sand and other proppants - used to keep fissures in shale rock open - in the wells should help boost production, Hill said."
Chevron,2017-2,"But the possibility of more deep cost reductions are, for the most part, gone."
Chevron,2017-2,"A number of companies saw break-even costs at the wellhead - the price required to profit from oil at a new well - stagnate between the third and fourth quarters, data from Rystad Energy showed."
Chevron,2017-2,"""To certain producers, there's a little bit of opportunity to lower costs more,"" said Bill Costello, a portfolio manager at Westwood Holdings Group. ""But those are few and far between."""

Chevron,2017-2,"TOKYO, Feb 17 (Reuters) - Japan's liquefied natural gas (LNG) buyers are upending the traditional practices of the market, using their leverage as the world's biggest buyers of the fuel to wrestle concessions for more flexible terms."
Chevron,2017-2,"Japan's electric utilities have won provisions that will allow them to divert contracted LNG cargoes if they restart their nuclear reactors, most of which have been shut since the 2011 Fukushima disaster, three sources have told Reuters. This could set a precedent as more contracts start coming up for renewal."
Chevron,2017-2,"A shrinking population and greater use of alternative fuels has lowered Japan's LNG demand. Because of that, utilities have pushed to gain allowances to resell imported cargoes and reduce their dependence on long-term contracts. [nL3N1C236A] [nL3N1AR1E2]"
Chevron,2017-2,"A persistent supply glut and low spot prices have given Japan's utilities the upper hand in their negotiations with sellers. About 32 million metric tonnes of annual LNG capacity will come online in 2017, according to a forecast from Reuters Supply Chain and Commodities Research, equal to about 12 percent of 2016's global imports."
Chevron,2017-2,"""With competition to place LNG heating up, price is not the only (contract) term under pressure. LNG suppliers will offer more innovative deals to secure sales,"" said Kerry Anne Shanks, head of LNG research for Asia at Wood Mackenzie. ""Japan's power utilities are highly prized as customers."""
Chevron,2017-2,"Japan has traditionally used so-called take-or-pay contracts for LNG purchases that oblige them to pay for a fixed volume of imports, and they are restricted from reselling cargoes if demand drops."
Chevron,2017-2,"Now, LNG buyers are being offered the restart provisions to entice them to sign up for new contracts, said an executive at one of Japan's gas importers. ""This option was offered to us in a recent sales pitch."""
Chevron,2017-2,"These offers come as data from the International Group of Liquefied Natural Gas Importers (GIIGNL) shows that several long-term contracts between Japanese utilities, including Chubu Electric <9502.T>, Tohoku Electric <9506.T>, Shizuoka Gas <9543.T>, and producers including Malaysia's Petronas and Australia's Woodside Petroleum started to expire last year and more will expire in 2017 and 2018."
Chevron,2017-2,"Many more of the contracts will be coming up for renewal in the coming five years, the GIIGNL data shows."
Chevron,2017-2,"Neither, the Japanese utilities nor Petronas were available for comment on the ongoing contractual negotiations. Woodside did not comment on the talks."
Chevron,2017-2,"Even as Asian spot LNG prices have dropped 65 percent from their 2014 peak, Japan's electric utilities still want to restart their nuclear reactors since they are a lower-cost power generation source."
Chevron,2017-2,"All but two of Japan's reactors remain shut since the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster, and many are going through a relicensing process that is taking longer than expected. [nL4N1EA1EQ]"
Chevron,2017-2,"At most, six reactors could restart this year, said Takeo Kikkawa, professor at the Tokyo University of Science, who advised the government on its most recent energy policy, adding the outlook was cloudy for further restarts past that."
Chevron,2017-2,"The utilities are likely taking advantage of downward quantity tolerances (DQT), standard provisions in gas contracts that stipulate the minimum amount of gas that must be paid for whether the buyer needs it or not, said a Japanese energy executive with more than 20 years of working in the gas business."
Chevron,2017-2,"Typically, DQTs are set at around 10 percent, meaning if a buyer signs up for 1 million tonnes of gas, it must take at least 90 percent of that on a guaranteed payment basis."
Chevron,2017-2,"""They are pushing for much greater DQTs,"" the executive said, adding that owners of older projects would likely offer these options."
Chevron,2017-2,"""The older projects are fully depreciated. They have been going for many years and they recovered all their costs so their costs basis is low,"" he said."
Chevron,2017-2,"In order to maintain market share in an oversupplied market, LNG sellers have become willing to tweak more flexible terms."
Chevron,2017-2,"""Our production costs a lot of money to develop, and what a buyer calls flexibility, we know as uncertainty,"" said a commercial manager at a major LNG supplier. ""There's already more LNG in the market than is needed, and more is coming, so as a producer we'll have to become that much more flexible in order to remain competitive."""

Chevron,2017-2,"PORT HARCOURT, Nigeria, Feb 14 (Reuters) - Nigeria needs to offer work to people who make a living from illegally refining oil in the Niger Delta to achieve peace there, Vice President Yemi Osinbajo said on Tuesday."
Chevron,2017-2,"The government has been holding talks with militants to end attacks on oil pipelines which cost the country up to $100 billion in lost oil revenues in 2016, Oil Minister Emmanuel Ibe Kachikwu said in a video on his Facebook page."
Chevron,2017-2,"But a military crackdown on thousands of illegal refineries in the southern swamps, which process crude oil stolen from oil majors and state oil firm NNPC, has raised tensions again."
Chevron,2017-2,"Illicit refineries process stolen crude in makeshift, blackened structures of pipes and metal tanks hidden in oil-soaked clearings deep in the Niger Delta's thick bush land."
Chevron,2017-2,"""Our approach to that is that we must engage them (illegal refiners) by establishing modular refineries so that they can participate in legal refineries,"" Osinbajo said during a visit to Rivers state, part of the Delta region."
Chevron,2017-2,"""We have recognised that young men must be properly engaged,"" he said, without giving details."
Chevron,2017-2,He also said the government would make more provisions for an amnesty scheme for former militants who laid down arms in 2009 in exchange for cash stipends and job training.
Chevron,2017-2,"Illegal refining is one of the few businesses flourishing in an otherwise desolate region, as petrol is scarce in Nigeria due to the country's derelict state refineries."
Chevron,2017-2,"Authorities had originally cut the budget for cash payments to militants to end corruption but later resumed payments to stop surging pipeline attacks which cut output by 700,000 barrels a day for several months last year."
Chevron,2017-2,"""We have to make more provisions for amnesty and provisions for social intervention,"" Osinbajo told residents of Port Harcourt, the region's major city. He has been visiting the Niger Delta since last month to calm tensions."
Chevron,2017-2,The militants and residents who sympathise with them say they want a greater share of Nigeria's oil wealth to go to the impoverished region.
Chevron,2017-2,Crude sales make up about 70 percent of government revenue and the attacks have deepened an economic crisis brought about by low global oil prices.
Chevron,2017-2,"Nigeria's oil production climbed to 1.576 million bpd in January, roughly 102,000 bpd higher than December, according to secondary sources in a monthly OPEC report released on Monday"
Chevron,2017-2,Osinbajo put total oil output last month at between 1.7 million bpd and 1.8 million bpd down from the 2.2 million bpd at the start of 2016.

Chevron,2017-2,"SINGAPORE, Feb 8 (Reuters) - Loading of cargoes from Australia's North West Shelf (NWS) liquefied natural gas (LNG) and condensate project has been halted due to adverse weather, traders with direct knowledge of the matter said on Wednesday."
Chevron,2017-2,"It remains unclear when cargo loadings at the port of Dampier will resume, said one person familiar with the matter who is facing loading delays for a cargo of NWS condensate."
Chevron,2017-2,"In an emailed statement, Pilbara Ports Authority - which manages ports in the area - said LNG cargo loadings are likely to have stopped ""as at the ports of Ashburton and Dampier, the ports and anchorages continue to remain clear of vessels""."
Chevron,2017-2,The NWS project is operated by Australian firm Woodside Petroleum .
Chevron,2017-2,"Woodside declined to comment on its loading operations, but said the company ""is taking the necessary precautions to safeguard our people and assets""."
Chevron,2017-2,"The loading delays are unlikely to have an immediate impact in LNG or condensate prices as adverse weather along the Australian coast is common in January and February, traders said."
Chevron,2017-2,"The impact of such loading delays are minimal as producers can claim force majeure, a Singapore-based LNG trader said. ""Also, demand is now quite weak,"" the trader said."

Chevron,2017-2,"ODESSA, Texas, Feb 1 (Reuters) - In most U.S. shale oil regions, energy firms are making strategic but cautious bets as the price of oil holds above $50 a barrel."
Chevron,2017-2,"Here in the Permian Basin of West Texas, the largest U.S. oil patch, the industry poured more than $28 billion into land acquisitions last year - more than triple what they spent in 2015."
Chevron,2017-2,Those deals set the stage for much larger investments needed to extract the oil from the ground - and they illustrate how the Permian Basin has become the epicenter for the U.S. shale resurgence after a historic oil price crash.
Chevron,2017-2,"""We could easily see an extra 100 rigs out here in the Permian by June,"" said Josh Clawson of Gesco, a Midland, Texas, electrical contractor for oil drilling rigs."
Chevron,2017-2,That doesn't necessarily mean the investment blitz will extend to other U.S. oil regions. The industry's focus on the Permian reflects the simple math of profitability and a complex set of geographic advantages and technological advances that make it cheaper to drill here than in other major U.S. oil regions.
Chevron,2017-2,"Permian Basin producers make money at the current crude price of about $53 per barrel because of the region's sprawling pipeline network, abundant labor and supplies, and warm winters that allow year-round work."
Chevron,2017-2,Most of America's shale industry needs prices above $60 a barrel to justify new projects and expansion. Oil has not hit that price since June 2015.
Chevron,2017-2,"So at least for now, the Permian accounts for a disproportionate share of the industry's recovery. The amount spent on Permian land purchases and leases last year represented 39 percent of all deals nationally and tripled the activity seen in any other major U.S. oil region."
Chevron,2017-2,"Acquisitions in North Dakota's Bakken shale fields, by comparison, accounted for 3 percent of all deals."
Chevron,2017-2,Judging by the confident flow of capital into West Texas - a swagger bred in part by aggressive cost-cutting and innovation through the downturn - U.S. oil companies have retained their appetite for risk.
Chevron,2017-2,"What remains to be seen, should per-barrel prices rise further, is whether companies continue to expand operations in the Permian as projects start to make more economic sense in other oil states including North Dakota, Colorado and Wyoming."
Chevron,2017-2,"Oil companies started the new year with announcements of about $9 billion more in Permian land deals, including a $6.6 billion Exxon Mobil Corp buy that doubled its acreage in the basin.[nL4N1F74E1]"
Chevron,2017-2,"Occidental Petroleum Corp , WPX Energy , Noble Energy Inc and RSP Permian Inc have also made major commitments to the region."
Chevron,2017-2,"The companies that have sold or leased their holdings have typically been smaller, privately-held firms aiming to take advantage of the high land prices rather than invest the millions of dollars needed to pump the oil."
Chevron,2017-2,"The demand for West Texas acreage has sent land prices soaring in the last two years. One deal in December 2016 priced out at more than $63,000 an acre, double the price paid in similar deal earlier that year."
Chevron,2017-2,Double Eagle Energy Permian LLC and its predecessor companies have made a fortune buying and selling Permian acreage starting in 2009.
Chevron,2017-2,"But Double Eagle's founders, who have snapped up 65,000 acres in the past two years, now plan to start drilling their holdings in addition to speculating on land values. The firm is preparing for an initial public offering with an expected valuation of $3 billion, according to a half dozen bankers who have examined its value.[nL1N1CI1LI]"
