Chevron,2017-8,UPDATE 2-Norway's Arctic oil ambitions suffer setback as most promising well yields none - Reuters News
Chevron,2017-8,{{20170829T103015.439+0000}}UPDATE 2-Norway's Arctic oil ambitions suffer setback as most promising well yields none* Korpfjell well yields non-commercial amounts of gas
Chevron,2017-8,"OSLO, Aug 29 (Reuters) - Norway's hope of discovering a large oilfield in the Barents Sea has suffered a major setback after the far north Arctic's most promising reservoir turned out to contain only small amounts of natural gas."
Chevron,2017-8,"Statoil , the country's top oil and gas producer, has stepped up drilling in the Barents Sea this year as the government seeks to attract more explorers to its Arctic waters to make up for declining North Sea output."
Chevron,2017-8,But Statoil said on Tuesday that after drilling the northernmost exploration well in the highly anticipated Korpfjell prospect it had found only non-commercial quantities of gas and no oil.
Chevron,2017-8,"Korpfjell was the first exploration well drilled in the Norwegian section of a formerly disputed area between Norway and Russia, where Statoil and its partners had hoped to make a major discovery. [nL5N1KT1AC]"
Chevron,2017-8,"""The results are of course disappointing, but it is too early to draw any conclusions on how this will impact the Barents Sea southeast area,"" Jez Averty, Statoil's head of exploration in Norway and UK, said."
Chevron,2017-8,"Statoil, which is majority government-owned, had ranked the Korpfjell well as ""high-impact"", meaning that it could contain upwards of 250 million barrels of oil equivalents (boe) gross or 100 million boe for Statoil alone, while its partner Lundin Petroleum had said it could hold more than a billion barrels."
Chevron,2017-8,"Statoil, however, said that the discovery made at Korfpjell is estimated to contain just 40-75 million boe or 6-12 billion standard cubic metres of gas, not large enough for commercial development."
Chevron,2017-8,"Averty said Statoil needed to explore the area more, and planned a second Korpfjell well in 2018. Lundin also said it would continue to explore in the area."
Chevron,2017-8,"The failure to make significant discoveries is also disappointing for Norway's right-wing government, which has sought to expand the petroleum industry in the Arctic region as production from the North Sea's mature areas is set to decline from the mid-2020s."
Chevron,2017-8,"In April, Norway's oil industry regulator doubled its forecast for potential Barents Sea discoveries."
Chevron,2017-8,"That alarmed green groups, which oppose Arctic drilling, and Greenpeace activists tried to stop drilling of the Korpfjell well earlier this month.[nL8N1L35W0] [nL8N1HX1QR]"
Chevron,2017-8,"Korpfjell was the fourth of Statoil's five planned exploration wells in the Barents Sea this summer, and the third that failed to prove commercial volumes."
Chevron,2017-8,"Statoil's fourth exploration well drilled this year, known as Kayak, made a small oil discovery, which could be potentially tied in to the larger Johan Castberg field development."
Chevron,2017-8,"News of the disappointing drilling results from Korpfjell sent Statoil shares down 1.9 percent by 0849 GMT, while shares of Lundin Petroleum tumbled 7 percent. Other partners in the Korpfjell license are Chevron , ConocoPhillips and state-owned Petoro."
Chevron,2017-8,"""Gas is almost impossible to commercialize in these remote areas, and if the eastern Barents Sea is gas prone, it will have limited value potential,"" analysts at brokers DNB said in note. They cut their target for Lundin's share price by 4 crowns to 196 Swedish crowns ($24.76) on Tuesday."
Chevron,2017-8,"Teodor Sveen-Nilsen, an analyst at Sparebank 1 Markets, said the results so far were slightly disappointing, but not disastrous."
Chevron,2017-8,"""If more wells to be drilled in 2018 turn to be dry, then it would be really bad,"" he added."

Chevron,2017-8,"Rosneft, which is taking a growing volume of Venezuelan crude and products while extending credits to President Nicolas Maduro's government, previously had resold the barrels in the United States and Asia through trading firms, according to PDVSA's [PDVSA.UL] internal documents. [nL1N1KW27W]"
Chevron,2017-8,"The new sales mechanism is similar to the one used by Andes Petroleum, a China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) and Sinopec joint venture, to sell its quota of Ecuadorian crude by awarding the barrels through annual or biannual tenders, one of the traders said. [nL1N1CY1QS]"
Chevron,2017-8,"It was not immediately clear which refiners agreed to buy the oil or the volume of the tender, but traders said the buyers included U.S. firms. Among the largest buyers of Venezuelan heavy crude in North America are Valero Energy Corp , Citgo Petroleum [PDVSAC.UL], Phillips 66 , Chevron Corp and PBF Energy Inc , according to Thomson Reuters data."
Chevron,2017-8,"Rosneft, Chevron and Valero did not immediately respond to requests for comment. U.S. refiners Phillips 66 and PBF Energy declined to comment on commercial arrangements."
Chevron,2017-8,Some of these refiners recently have struggled to purchase Venezuelan oil directly from PDVSA as banks based in the United States have refused to extend the letters of credit the buyers need to complete imports from Venezuela. [nL2N1L31EK]
Chevron,2017-8,"Rosneft's deliveries of Venezuelan oil will occur during September through December. The crude grades offered include diluted crude oil (DCO), a blend of extra heavy oil and heavy naphtha, according to the sources."
Chevron,2017-8,"Russian oil firms Rosneft and Lukoil since May have received some 250,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude and refined products from Venezuela, according to the PDVSA's internal documents."
Chevron,2017-8,"Venezuela's oil deliveries to the United States have declined in recent years amid falling production, commercial issues, and sanctions on Venezuelan officials. It has relied on deliveries to Russian oil firms to repay loans and swaps."

Chevron,2017-8,"{{20170822T223435.364+0000}}UPDATE 3-Chevron CEO Watson to step down, Wirth likely successor -source(Adds analyst comment and details on refining business)"
Chevron,2017-8,"HOUSTON, Aug 22 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp Chief Executive John Watson will step down by the end of next month and likely be replaced by Vice Chairman Mike Wirth, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters on Tuesday."
Chevron,2017-8,The unexpected shake-up at one of the world's largest oil and natural gas producers comes as pressure grows on the industry to further cut costs and control spending.
Chevron,2017-8,"In Wirth, Chevron would pivot to a leader with experience in refining, where costs are regularly scrutinized down to the fraction of a penny."
Chevron,2017-8,"The move would copy rival Exxon Mobil Corp , which earlier this year named refining expert Darren Woods as its own CEO, a step widely seen as prioritizing cash generation to protect payouts to shareholders above pricy exploration projects. [nL1N1E714O]"
Chevron,2017-8,The CEOs of rivals Total and Royal Dutch Shell also have experience in refining.
Chevron,2017-8,"Chevron's shares are up about 35 percent since Watson took over as CEO in January 2010, but the Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> has more than doubled in that time. The company's shares are trading at the same level they were in early 2011."
Chevron,2017-8,Chevron spokesman Kent Robertson declined to comment. Neither Watson nor Wirth responded to requests for comment.
Chevron,2017-8,The California-based company is emerging from a global commodity price slump and is beginning to reap the fruits of a multibillion-dollar expansion spree.
Chevron,2017-8,"The exit is not acrimonious and Watson sees it as an opportunity to hand over the reins of a growing enterprise to Wirth, according to the source."
Chevron,2017-8,"""He may see it as a good time to step down and allow fresh management to take Chevron further,"" said Brendan Warn, an equity analyst with BMO Capital Markets, which advises clients to buy Chevron's stock."
Chevron,2017-8,"The company's growth under Watson has not been painless. Chevron has struggled with cost overruns at two Australian liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects, faced major engineering challenges at its U.S. Gulf of Mexico expansions, and is now contending with growing uncertainty about its operations in strife-torn Venezuela, where it is the only remaining major U.S. oil producer. [nL8N1IH3JO][nL2N1L31EK]"
Chevron,2017-8,"One of the Australian LNG projects has now come online, and the other is expected to by next month. Combined, the two are expected to fund half the company's dividend by 2019."
Chevron,2017-8,"Watson made no major acquisitions during his leadership, ceding growth opportunities to rivals. Former Exxon CEO Rex Tillerson, for example, bought natural gas producer XTO Energy during his tenure and rapidly expanded into Qatar's LNG sector."
Chevron,2017-8,"Watson, who has five years remaining before he hits Chevron's mandatory retirement age of 65, stuck to projects already in the planning stages when he became CEO in January 2010, rather than coming up with new deal or expansion ideas. Watson's predecessor, David O'Reilly, retired at 62."
Chevron,2017-8,"The change at the top of the company, first reported by the Wall Street Journal on Tuesday, did not shake markets. Shares of Chevron rose less than 1 percent to close at $106.36."
Chevron,2017-8,"Watson is expected to stay on the company's board of directors for a period of time as Wirth grows into the CEO role, according to the source."
Chevron,2017-8,"Like many of the company's executives, Watson has worked at Chevron his entire career and is the product of an internal talent development program."
Chevron,2017-8,"""It would be hard to sit there and say that John Watson did a bad job as CEO,"" said Oliver Pursche of wealth manager Bruderman Brothers LLC, which holds shares in the company. ""When we think about how Chevron has run its different business lines during the oil price slump, they've managed very well."""
Chevron,2017-8,"Wirth, 56, has been vice chairman since February and runs the company's pipeline division. He previously ran Chevron's refining unit, which has grown rapidly in recent years, with the company investing heavily in expansion and renovations. [nL2N1C91Z5]"
Chevron,2017-8,Chevron last month posted higher-than-expected second-quarter profits on higher production and oil prices and lower spending on large projects.
Chevron,2017-8,"Under Watson the company has been shifting additional resources to shale oil projects that promise quicker returns, but nearly all of that shale acreage has been in the company's portfolio since the 1930s. [nL1N1KJ0JB] [nL2N1HD00L]"
Chevron,2017-8,"Watson, an economist by training, rose through the company's ranks, served as its chief financial officer, and earlier oversaw the integration of Texaco operations following the 2000 acquisition."

Chevron,2017-8,{{20170822T203303.625+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-Energy landscape is a battle for next Chevron CEO(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are her own.)
Chevron,2017-8,"DALLAS, Aug 22 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Chevron is in the midst of changes. Chief Executive John Watson is planning to step down next month, according to Reuters, and he may be replaced by refining expert Michael Wirth. A new perspective may be warranted. Yet Chevron has weathered recent challenges decently. Any new boss, especially if home grown, will struggle with long-term industry headwinds."
Chevron,2017-8,"Chevron has felt the pain too. Revenue last year was only half of 2013's figure, and the company posted an annual loss. It has fared better than others, though, over both the long and short term. The company's stock price has increased roughly five percent over the last 10 years while competitors' shares have remained flat or fallen. Last quarter, Chevron's head start investing in the Permian shale in the United States started to pay off as it swung to profit and increased production."
Chevron,2017-8,"Even so, earnings from downstream business were 40 percent bigger than those from upstream units last quarter. That poses longer term, structural problems. More than 80 percent of Chevron's assets are in upstream areas. The midstream business also depends on pulling hydrocarbons out of the ground. Whatever the focus on refining and the like, these other businesses still loom large."
Chevron,2017-8,"The larger task for Chevron and rival oil majors is to rethink what being an energy company means. In one example, last week asset-management behemoth Vanguard, in a call with Reuters, said it would join other asset managers in asking companies to disclose more about the risks climate change poses, citing economics rather than ideology. It might take more than a different kind of oil-industry expertise to meet that kind of challenge."
Chevron,2017-8,"- Chevron Chief Executive John Watson is planning to step down from his role next month, according to Reuters, and will probably be replaced by Michael Wirth, the report said. The news was first reported by the Wall Street Journal, which added that the successor to Watson has not been finalized by the board and could change. Wirth is a refining specialist who was promoted to vice chairman at the beginning of the year."

Chevron,2017-8,* North Sea still generates good price due low political risks
Chevron,2017-8,"LONDON, Aug 22 (Reuters) - French oil major Total has overtaken rival Royal Dutch Shell to become the second-largest producer in the North Sea with its acquisition of Maersk's Norwegian and UK producing assets."
Chevron,2017-8,"The $7.45 billion deal by Total was welcomed by the market, with analysts saying it helped the French company rebalance its portfolio by adding assets in developed countries after going for projects in riskier places such as Iran and Russia. [nL8N1L70XF]"
Chevron,2017-8,"The deal boosts the share of eight global oil majors in the North Sea - Statoil, Total, Shell, Exxon Mobil , Conoco , ENI and Chevron - to back above three quarters of total output."
Chevron,2017-8,Several oil majors have been actively looking to divest fields in the North Sea - one of the most mature global oil provinces where future developments will be complicated by high decommissioning costs of old infrastructure.
Chevron,2017-8,"Some assets have been bought by private equity firms which have expanded significantly in the region, with companies such as Chrysaor and Siccar acquiring fields from Shell, Austria's OMV and France's Engie. [nL8N1ID244] [nL5N1FL1B4] [nL8N1D976X]"
Chevron,2017-8,"But despite around $10 billion worth of deals in the North Sea over the past two years, private equity firms remain fairly small players with their total share still below 10 percent."
Chevron,2017-8,"On Tuesday, UBS analysts upgraded Total to ""Buy"" from ""Neutral"" after the Maersk deal, saying Total bought the assets at an average price of $7.3 per barrel of oil resources, implying a long-term Brent price of $62 per barrel."
Chevron,2017-8,"""In the context of a global asset market dominated by U.S. unconventional and Canadian oil sands transactions this year, a conventional offshore deal stands out as an anomaly,"" UBS said."
Chevron,2017-8,It said that opportunities for inorganic growth in the North Sea were beginning to diminish because EU utilities have fully divested of the upstream sector while oil majors have also largely sold out their non-core portfolios.
Chevron,2017-8,"""The sale of another North Sea focused portfolio that was on the market, combined with Total's clear commitment to the basin, emphasises that competition for assets could remain high in spite of depressed oil prices,"" UBS said."

Chevron,2017-8,"MELBOURNE, Aug 18 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp has withdrawn an appeal to Australia's High Court over a disputed A$340 million ($268 million) tax bill, leaving in place a landmark court ruling on related-party loans that could affect other multinational companies."
Chevron,2017-8,"""Chevron Australia has reached agreement with the Australian Taxation Office on the loan transfer pricing dispute and have withdrawn our appeal to the High Court,"" the company said in an emailed statement."

Chevron,2017-8,"HOUSTON, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Major oil producers pushed up high bids at a Gulf of Mexico offshore auction to $121 million on Wednesday, a nearly seven-fold increase from a year ago, as their return to deep water exploration gained momentum."
Chevron,2017-8,This compared with $18 million in high bids at the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management's (BOEM) Outer Continental Shelf auction last summer.
Chevron,2017-8,Some producers have signaled that they expect Gulf of Mexico projects to become more profitable now that they have trimmed operations to adapt to low oil prices. Offshore drilling typically requires higher prices for producers to break even.
Chevron,2017-8,"Royal Dutch Shell claimed the largest number of blocks, with 19 high bids valued at a combined $25.1 million. Chevron Corp followed with 15 high bids totaling $27.9 million. Anadarko Petroleum Corp won 10 blocks for $10.6 million. Exxon Mobil Corp took seven blocks of land for $20.4 million."
Chevron,2017-8,"Most of the bids were for deep water blocks, at depths of more than 1,600 meters. The auction drew interest from 27 oil companies, with 99 bids on 90 blocks in the Gulf of Mexico, according to the BOEM."
Chevron,2017-8,"""The deepwater industry is emphasizing short-cycle, low-risk prospects above high-impact, wildcat drilling,"" said William Turner, a senior analyst at consultancy Wood Mackenzie."
Chevron,2017-8,"Some bids by Chevron, Shell and Total were ""a vote of confidence in higher-risk, standalone, developments with potential for higher rewards,"" he added."
Chevron,2017-8,"The auction offered 14,177 blocks totaling 75.9 million acres, but only 508,000 received bids, according to the BOEM. This year's auction covered Western, Central and Eastern areas of the gulf. The year-earlier auction was only for the Western region."
Chevron,2017-8,"The sale offered nearly 76 million acres of land off the shores of Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida."
Chevron,2017-8,"A sale of offshore blocks in March attracted $275 million in winning bids, a similar surge from a year ago."

Chevron,2017-8,"{{20170814T204550.677+0000}}Venezuela ships more oil to U.S. in July vs June, but less than yr agoBy Marianna Parraga"
Chevron,2017-8,"Aug 14 (Reuters) - Venezuela's PDVSA and its joint ventures last month shipped 638,325 barrels per day (bpd) of crude to the United States, a 30 percent increase over June due to larger sales of upgraded oil, according to Thomson Reuters trade flows data."
Chevron,2017-8,"Venezuelan crude output has declined this year to its lowest point in 27 years due to a lack of investment and payment delays to oil service firms, affecting exports to customers in key markets including the United States."
Chevron,2017-8,"Even though the volume of crude sent to the United States in July was larger than the previous month, it was 22 percent below the same month in 2016."
Chevron,2017-8,"The main U.S. receiver of Venezuelan crude last month was refiner Valero Energy , followed by PDVSA's refining unit in the United States, Citgo Petroleum [PDVSAC.UL]."
Chevron,2017-8,"PDVSA earlier this year signed a refinancing agreement with Russian energy giant Rosneft that has diverted more oil to that firm, and fewer volumes to Citgo. [nL1N1KM1Z8]"
Chevron,2017-8,"But Citgo has requested more upgraded crude from joint ventures between PDVSA and its foreign partners in the Orinoco Belt, which has partially compensated for lower supplies from its parent company. Upgraded oils are those that have been treated at special facilities built to process extra heavy crude from Venzeuela's largest oil-producing region."
Chevron,2017-8,"Another prominent buyer of Venezuelan crude in the United States, refining firm Phillips 66 , did not receive crude supplies from PDVSA last month, according to the data."
Chevron,2017-8,"U.S.-based PBF Energy , Marathon Petroleum , Valero and Phillips 66 have reduced their purchases of heavy oil in recent weeks due to less barrels available from Venezuela and other OPEC producers, which is narrowing spreads between heavy Latin American crudes and lighter grades.

Chevron,2017-8,"LONDON/SINGAPORE, Aug 11 (Reuters) - Asian spot LNG prices gained ground this week with traders and portfolio players engaged in short-covering as sputtering output and stockpiling ahead of winter added to bullish sentiment."
Chevron,2017-8,"Spot prices for September delivery rose to $6.20 per million British thermal units (mmBtu), 30 cents above last week. LNG for October traded at a five cent premium."
Chevron,2017-8,"The week's big tender award came from Russia's Sakhalin II plant, providing a shipment to Shell, Gazprom and Mitsui at some $6.30 per million British thermal units (mmBtu). [nL5N1KX4C3]"
Chevron,2017-8,"Relatively high bid levels for the Sakhalin II cargoes - all loading in October - reflect efforts by suppliers to cover short positions, some traders said."
Chevron,2017-8,"Shell in particular has been stung by export disruptions from Peru and an unplanned outage hitting its Queensland Curtis plant in Australia, which now appears to be back in operation. The resulting supply shortfall forced it into spot markets."
Chevron,2017-8,"An unexpected pick-up in autumn demand across Asia, fuelled by hot weather and stockpiling ahead of the winter by some buyers, also helped to lift spot prices."
Chevron,2017-8,"Two more upcoming maintenance outages at Australian projects - Chevron's Gorgon and Woodside Petroleum's North West Shelf (NWS) - where Shell is an off-taker of LNG, might extend its reliance on spot markets, some traders said."
Chevron,2017-8,"The NWS outage in September could not be confirmed, however."

Chevron,2017-8,"As Caracas struggles to contain an economic meltdown and violent street protests, Moscow is using its position as Venezuela's lender of last resort to gain more control over the OPEC nation's crude reserves, the largest in the world."
Chevron,2017-8,"Venezuela's state-owned oil firm, Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA), has been secretly negotiating since at least early this year with Russia's biggest state-owned oil company, Rosneft - offering ownership interests in up to nine of Venezuela's most productive petroleum projects, according to a top Venezuelan government official and two industry sources familiar with the talks. [nL2N1GT1M4]"
Chevron,2017-8,Moscow has substantial leverage in the negotiations: Cash from Russia and Rosneft has been crucial in helping the financially strapped government of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro avoid a sovereign debt default or a political coup.
Chevron,2017-8,"Rosneft delivered Venezuela's state-owned firm more than $1 billion in April alone in exchange for a promise of oil shipments later. On at least two occasions, the Venezuelan government has used Russian cash to avoid imminent defaults on payments to bondholders, a high-level PDVSA official told Reuters."
Chevron,2017-8,PDVSA and the government of Venezuela did not respond to requests for comment.
Chevron,2017-8,"The Russian government declined to comment and referred questions to the foreign ministry and the ministries of finance and defense, which did not respond to questions from Reuters. Rosneft declined to comment."
Chevron,2017-8,"Russia's growing control over Venezuelan crude gives it a stronger foothold in energy markets across the Americas. Rosneft now resells about 225,000 barrels per day (bpd) of Venezuelan oil - about 13 percent of the nation's total exports, according to the PDVSA trade reports. That's about enough to satisfy the daily demand of a country the size of Peru."
Chevron,2017-8,Venezuela gives Rosneft most of that oil as payment for billions of dollars in cash loans that Maduro's government has already spent. His administration needs Russia's money to finance everything from bond payments to imports of food and medicine amid severe national shortages.
Chevron,2017-8,Venezuela's opposition lawmakers say Russia is behaving more like a predator than an ally.
Chevron,2017-8,"""Rosneft is definitely taking advantage of the situation,"" said Elias Matta, vice president of the energy commission at Venezuela's elected National Assembly. ""They know this is a weak government; that it's desperate for cash - and they're sharks."""
Chevron,2017-8,Matta echoed many others in the opposition-majority congress who have blasted corporate deals they say are underpinning Maduro's efforts to establish a dictatorship.
Chevron,2017-8,The Venezuelan government has said previously that Russia's investment in its oil industry shows confidence in PDVSA's financial stability and the nation's business opportunities.
Chevron,2017-8,"Maduro's administration has grown increasingly dependent on Moscow in the past two years as China has curtailed credit to Venezuela because of payment delays and the corruption and crime faced by Chinese firms operating there, according to Venezuelan debt analysts and two oil industry sources."
Chevron,2017-8,"Many multinational firms worldwide, meanwhile, have all but written off their Venezuelan operations amid the nation's tanking economy and chronic shortages of raw materials."
Chevron,2017-8,Rosneft is making the opposite play - using Venezuela's hard times as a buying opportunity for oil assets with potentially high long-term value.
Chevron,2017-8,"""The Russians are catching Venezuela at rock bottom,"" said one Western diplomat who has worked on issues involving Venezuela's oil industry in recent years."
Chevron,2017-8,"As other companies shutter operations here, Rosneft has expanded to an additional floor of its office tower and added staff. The Russian firm has poached PDVSA professionals and brought in more Russian executives, two sources close to Rosneft told Reuters."
Chevron,2017-8,"The corporate expansion provides a striking contrast to the scene on the streets below these days, in the once-thriving business district of Caracas."
Chevron,2017-8,As Rosneft staffers work in swanky offices alongside posters of Russian President Vladimir Putin and a bust of Hugo Chavez - the late Venezuelan leader and socialist icon - crowds of young men outside often throw rocks and Molotov cocktails in escalating protests of Chavez' successor.
Chevron,2017-8,"Under the proposal, Rosneft would also take increased management control over all the joint oil projects between the two firms. [nL1N1KB28X]"
Chevron,2017-8,Rosneft secured the collateral late last year on a loan of $1.5 billion to PDVSA.
Chevron,2017-8,The negotiations over a collateral swap are driven in part by a recent threat from U.S. President Donald Trump to sanction Venezuela's oil sector as punishment for Maduro's efforts to undermine the nation's elected congress.
Chevron,2017-8,Rosneft has already been sanctioned by the United States over Russia's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. Such actions require U.S. firms to end business relations with sanctioned entities.
Chevron,2017-8,"Maduro's need for Russian cash played a key role in a move by his political allies earlier this year that destabilized Venezuela's already teetering democracy, the top Venezuelan government official told Reuters."
Chevron,2017-8,"In March, the nation's Supreme Court - whose members are loyal to Maduro - took over the powers of the opposition-controlled National Assembly. A majority of elected Assembly members opposed any new oil deals with Russia and insisted on retaining power to veto them."
Chevron,2017-8,Days later - after fierce national protests against the action - the court returned most powers to the national legislature at Maduro's public urging. But the court allowed the president to keep the legal authority to cut fresh oil deals with Russia without legislative approval. [nL2N1HA018]
Chevron,2017-8,The episode was pivotal in escalating daily street protests and clashes with authorities that have since caused more than 120 deaths.
Chevron,2017-8,"Maduro needed sole authority to cut new oil deals to clear the way for Rosneft's expansion, the top Venezuelan government official told Reuters."
Chevron,2017-8,"""Pressure from Russia has played an important role in Nicolas Maduro's decisions,"" the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to make public comments."
Chevron,2017-8,"Rosneft said this month that it has lent a total of $6 billion to PDVSA. In total, Russia and Rosneft have delivered Venezuela at least $17 billion in loans and credit lines since 2006, according to Reuters calculations based on loans and credit lines announced by the government."
Chevron,2017-8,Venezuela does not publish the full details of the debts it owes Russia.
Chevron,2017-8,Maduro has sought to limit the power of congress since the opposition won a majority in 2015.
Chevron,2017-8,"In late July, he created a legislative superbody called the Constituent Assembly in an election that was widely criticized as a sham. Allies of the Socialist Party won all 545 seats in the new assembly, which has the power to rewrite the nation's constitution, dissolve state institutions - such as the opposition-run Congress - and fire dissident state officials."
Chevron,2017-8,"Venezuela's oil-based economy has collapsed since international prices crashed to a low of $24 per barrel in early 2016 from more than $100 in 2014. Prices now hover at about $50, which hasn't proven high enough to pull Venezuela out of its tailspin."
Chevron,2017-8,"Nearly all of the nation's export revenue comes from oil, so income has fallen sharply and a shortage of petrodollars has left Maduro's government unable to finance the generous subsidies of food, medicines, fuels, power and other public services instituted by his predecessor, Chavez."
Chevron,2017-8,"The erosion of subsidies has contributed to rapid inflation, which is forecasted to top 700 percent this year by the International Monetary Fund. Venezuela's currency, the bolivar, has become nearly worthless."
Chevron,2017-8,"Government spending cuts have also slashed budgets for maintaining the nation's oilfields, refineries, ports and tankers, causing Venezuela's oil output in the first half of 2017 to fall to nearly its lowest level in 27 years."
Chevron,2017-8,"PDVSA is repaying a growing portion of its mounting debts to Russia with oil, according to internal PDVSA trade data reviewed by Reuters. The oil payments are choking off the cash flow from its petroleum business - thereby creating the need for more loans."
Chevron,2017-8,The nation's downward spiral has put Rosneft in a position to acquire Venezuelan oil assets on the cheap.
Chevron,2017-8,"Of the package of stakes PDVSA has offered to Rosneft, the most valuable is a 10 percent stake in Petropiar, a multi-billion dollar project to produce and upgrade extra heavy crude in the Orinoco Belt."
Chevron,2017-8,"The value of the stake is likely between $600 million and $800 million, based on the valuations of similar deals."
Chevron,2017-8,The rising volumes of Venezuelan crude that Rosneft receives have made the Russian firm a middleman in sales to refiners that once bought directly from PDVSA. The oil payments have also helped Rosneft grow a major oil trading business to complement its massive production apparatus.
Chevron,2017-8,"In the process, the Russian firm has appropriated some of PDVSA's hard-won international supply deals and valuable trading relationships with refiners as far afield as China, the PDVSA documents show."
Chevron,2017-8,"At today's prices, the Venezuelan oil exports that flow to Rosneft would be worth about $3.6 billion annually. And the flow of PDVSA crude to Rosneft is expected to keep increasing, according to the internal PDVSA documents."
Chevron,2017-8,"Most of it is sold into the United States, according to the documents."
Chevron,2017-8,"Rosneft also will soon start selling Venezuelan crude to India's refiner Essar, taking PDVSA's second largest customer in the Asian country. [nL2N1GL06O]"
Chevron,2017-8,"""Russia is taking everything they have,"" said an oil trader who regularly deals with PDVSA."
Chevron,2017-8,"The Russian strategy has its risks. Many of the world's top energy firms took a hit when Chavez nationalized their assets, and an opposition-led government could later reverse or revise any deals Maduro cuts without their blessing."
Chevron,2017-8,Venezuela's bond yields are among the highest in the world because of the nation's high default risk. The bonds pay nearly 30 percentage points more than benchmark U.S. treasuries.
Chevron,2017-8,PDVSA's many connections to the United States oil industry also raise the specter that the deals now under negotiation could run afoul of U.S. economic sanctions already in place against Russia and threatened against Venezuela.
Chevron,2017-8,"The Petropiar project, for instance, is 30 percent owned by U.S. oil major Chevron Corp ."
Chevron,2017-8,"Should Rosneft take a stake in the project, it could be complicated for Chevron to ensure it is not violating U.S. sanctions. In the meantime, Chevron has sent guidelines to executives to ensure they comply with sanctions, an employee at Chevron told Reuters."
Chevron,2017-8,"The guidelines advise staff, for instance, to avoid one-on-one meetings with sanctioned entities or officials, the employee said. In a statement, Chevron said it abides by ""a stringent code of business ethics"" and complies with applicable laws."
Chevron,2017-8,"For now, Russia's status as chief lender to PDVSA has put Rosneft in a position to supercharge its holdings and profits in the region."
Chevron,2017-8,"If Venezuela's government defaults on its debt payments - an increasingly likely scenario - Rosneft likely will be one of the entities at the front of the queue as a creditor because of its large collateral stake in U.S.-based Citgo, according to a confidential independent analysis of its debt commissioned by an investment fund and seen by Reuters."
Chevron,2017-8,"Representatives of Citgo, PDVSA'S largest foreign asset, did not respond to requests for comment."
Chevron,2017-8,"Rosneft's involvement in Venezuela can be traced back to a $4 billion arms-for-oil deal in 2006 that cemented the bond between the governments of Chavez and Putin. Chavez, a former military officer, signed the deal himself in Moscow."
Chevron,2017-8,"Shunned by the United States - which since 2006 has refused to supply spare parts for Venezuela's fleet of U.S.-built F-16 fighter jets - Chavez bought Russian Sukhoi fighter jets, helicopters, tanks and guns from Putin."

Chevron,2017-8,"{{20170811T113734.000+0000}}SPECIAL REPORT-Vladimir's Venezuela: Leveraging loans to Caracas, Moscow snaps up oil assetsCaracas/Houston, Aug 11 (Reuters)"
Chevron,2017-8,"As Caracas struggles to contain an economic meltdown and violent street protests, Moscow is using its position as Venezuela's lender of last resort to gain more control over the OPEC nation's crude reserves, the largest in the world."
Chevron,2017-8,"Venezuela's state-owned oil firm, Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA), has been secretly negotiating since at least early this year with Russia's biggest state-owned oil company, Rosneft - offering ownership interests in up to nine of Venezuela's most productive petroleum projects, according to a top Venezuelan government official and two industry sources familiar with the talks. [nL2N1GT1M4]"
Chevron,2017-8,Moscow has substantial leverage in the negotiations: Cash from Russia and Rosneft has been crucial in helping the financially strapped government of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro avoid a sovereign debt default or a political coup.
Chevron,2017-8,"Rosneft delivered Venezuela's state-owned firm more than $1 billion in April alone in exchange for a promise of oil shipments later. On at least two occasions, the Venezuelan government has used Russian cash to avoid imminent defaults on payments to bondholders, a high-level PDVSA official told Reuters."
Chevron,2017-8,PDVSA and the government of Venezuela did not respond to requests for comment.
Chevron,2017-8,"The Russian government declined to comment and referred questions to the foreign ministry and the ministries of finance and defense, which did not respond to questions from Reuters. Rosneft declined to comment."
Chevron,2017-8,"Russia's growing control over Venezuelan crude gives it a stronger foothold in energy markets across the Americas. Rosneft now resells about 225,000 barrels per day (bpd) of Venezuelan oil - about 13 percent of the nation's total exports, according to the PDVSA trade reports. That's about enough to satisfy the daily demand of a country the size of Peru."
Chevron,2017-8,Venezuela gives Rosneft most of that oil as payment for billions of dollars in cash loans that Maduro's government has already spent. His administration needs Russia's money to finance everything from bond payments to imports of food and medicine amid severe national shortages.
Chevron,2017-8,Venezuela's opposition lawmakers say Russia is behaving more like a predator than an ally.
Chevron,2017-8,"""Rosneft is definitely taking advantage of the situation,"" said Elias Matta, vice president of the energy commission at Venezuela's elected National Assembly. ""They know this is a weak government; that it's desperate for cash - and they're sharks."""
Chevron,2017-8,Matta echoed many others in the opposition-majority congress who have blasted corporate deals they say are underpinning Maduro's efforts to establish a dictatorship.
Chevron,2017-8,The Venezuelan government has said previously that Russia's investment in its oil industry shows confidence in PDVSA's financial stability and the nation's business opportunities.
Chevron,2017-8,"Maduro's administration has grown increasingly dependent on Moscow in the past two years as China has curtailed credit to Venezuela because of payment delays and the corruption and crime faced by Chinese firms operating there, according to Venezuelan debt analysts and two oil industry sources."
Chevron,2017-8,"Many multinational firms worldwide, meanwhile, have all but written off their Venezuelan operations amid the nation's tanking economy and chronic shortages of raw materials."
Chevron,2017-8,Rosneft is making the opposite play - using Venezuela's hard times as a buying opportunity for oil assets with potentially high long-term value.
Chevron,2017-8,"""The Russians are catching Venezuela at rock bottom,"" said one Western diplomat who has worked on issues involving Venezuela's oil industry in recent years."
Chevron,2017-8,"As other companies shutter operations here, Rosneft has expanded to an additional floor of its office tower and added staff. The Russian firm has poached PDVSA professionals and brought in more Russian executives, two sources close to Rosneft told Reuters."
Chevron,2017-8,"The corporate expansion provides a striking contrast to the scene on the streets below these days, in the once-thriving business district of Caracas."
Chevron,2017-8,As Rosneft staffers work in swanky offices alongside posters of Russian President Vladimir Putin and a bust of Hugo Chavez - the late Venezuelan leader and socialist icon - crowds of young men outside often throw rocks and Molotov cocktails in escalating protests of Chavez' successor.
Chevron,2017-8,"Under the proposal, Rosneft would also take increased management control over all the joint oil projects between the two firms. [nL1N1KB28X]"
Chevron,2017-8,Rosneft secured the collateral late last year on a loan of $1.5 billion to PDVSA.
Chevron,2017-8,The negotiations over a collateral swap are driven in part by a recent threat from U.S. President Donald Trump to sanction Venezuela's oil sector as punishment for Maduro's efforts to undermine the nation's elected congress.
Chevron,2017-8,Rosneft has already been sanctioned by the United States over Russia's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. Such actions require U.S. firms to end business relations with sanctioned entities.
Chevron,2017-8,"Maduro's need for Russian cash played a key role in a move by his political allies earlier this year that destabilized Venezuela's already teetering democracy, the top Venezuelan government official told Reuters."
Chevron,2017-8,"In March, the nation's Supreme Court - whose members are loyal to Maduro - took over the powers of the opposition-controlled National Assembly. A majority of elected Assembly members opposed any new oil deals with Russia and insisted on retaining power to veto them."
Chevron,2017-8,Days later - after fierce national protests against the action - the court returned most powers to the national legislature at Maduro's public urging. But the court allowed the president to keep the legal authority to cut fresh oil deals with Russia without legislative approval. [nL2N1HA018]
Chevron,2017-8,The episode was pivotal in escalating daily street protests and clashes with authorities that have since caused more than 120 deaths.
Chevron,2017-8,"Maduro needed sole authority to cut new oil deals to clear the way for Rosneft's expansion, the top Venezuelan government official told Reuters."
Chevron,2017-8,"""Pressure from Russia has played an important role in Nicolas Maduro's decisions,"" the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to make public comments."
Chevron,2017-8,"Rosneft said this month that it has lent a total of $6 billion to PDVSA. In total, Russia and Rosneft have delivered Venezuela at least $17 billion in loans and credit lines since 2006, according to Reuters calculations based on loans and credit lines announced by the government."
Chevron,2017-8,Venezuela does not publish the full details of the debts it owes Russia.
Chevron,2017-8,Maduro has sought to limit the power of congress since the opposition won a majority in 2015.
Chevron,2017-8,"In late July, he created a legislative superbody called the Constituent Assembly in an election that was widely criticized as a sham. Allies of the Socialist Party won all 545 seats in the new assembly, which has the power to rewrite the nation's constitution, dissolve state institutions - such as the opposition-run Congress - and fire dissident state officials."
Chevron,2017-8,"Venezuela's oil-based economy has collapsed since international prices crashed to a low of $24 per barrel in early 2016 from more than $100 in 2014. Prices now hover at about $50, which hasn't proven high enough to pull Venezuela out of its tailspin."
Chevron,2017-8,"Nearly all of the nation's export revenue comes from oil, so income has fallen sharply and a shortage of petrodollars has left Maduro's government unable to finance the generous subsidies of food, medicines, fuels, power and other public services instituted by his predecessor, Chavez."
Chevron,2017-8,"The erosion of subsidies has contributed to rapid inflation, which is forecasted to top 700 percent this year by the International Monetary Fund. Venezuela's currency, the bolivar, has become nearly worthless."
Chevron,2017-8,"Government spending cuts have also slashed budgets for maintaining the nation's oilfields, refineries, ports and tankers, causing Venezuela's oil output in the first half of 2017 to fall to nearly its lowest level in 27 years."
Chevron,2017-8,"PDVSA is repaying a growing portion of its mounting debts to Russia with oil, according to internal PDVSA trade data reviewed by Reuters. The oil payments are choking off the cash flow from its petroleum business - thereby creating the need for more loans."
Chevron,2017-8,The nation's downward spiral has put Rosneft in a position to acquire Venezuelan oil assets on the cheap.
Chevron,2017-8,"Of the package of stakes PDVSA has offered to Rosneft, the most valuable is a 10 percent stake in Petropiar, a multi-billion dollar project to produce and upgrade extra heavy crude in the Orinoco Belt."
Chevron,2017-8,"The value of the stake is likely between $600 million and $800 million, based on the valuations of similar deals."
Chevron,2017-8,The rising volumes of Venezuelan crude that Rosneft receives have made the Russian firm a middleman in sales to refiners that once bought directly from PDVSA. The oil payments have also helped Rosneft grow a major oil trading business to complement its massive production apparatus.
Chevron,2017-8,"In the process, the Russian firm has appropriated some of PDVSA's hard-won international supply deals and valuable trading relationships with refiners as far afield as China, the PDVSA documents show."
Chevron,2017-8,"At today's prices, the Venezuelan oil exports that flow to Rosneft would be worth about $3.6 billion annually. And the flow of PDVSA crude to Rosneft is expected to keep increasing, according to the internal PDVSA documents."
Chevron,2017-8,"Most of it is sold into the United States, according to the documents."
Chevron,2017-8,"Rosneft also will soon start selling Venezuelan crude to India's refiner Essar, taking PDVSA's second largest customer in the Asian country. [nL2N1GL06O]"
Chevron,2017-8,"""Russia is taking everything they have,"" said an oil trader who regularly deals with PDVSA."
Chevron,2017-8,"The Russian strategy has its risks. Many of the world's top energy firms took a hit when Chavez nationalized their assets, and an opposition-led government could later reverse or revise any deals Maduro cuts without their blessing."
Chevron,2017-8,Venezuela's bond yields are among the highest in the world because of the nation's high default risk. The bonds pay nearly 30 percentage points more than benchmark U.S. treasuries.
Chevron,2017-8,PDVSA's many connections to the United States oil industry also raise the specter that the deals now under negotiation could run afoul of U.S. economic sanctions already in place against Russia and threatened against Venezuela.
Chevron,2017-8,"The Petropiar project, for instance, is 30 percent owned by U.S. oil major Chevron Corp ."
Chevron,2017-8,"Should Rosneft take a stake in the project, it could be complicated for Chevron to ensure it is not violating U.S. sanctions. In the meantime, Chevron has sent guidelines to executives to ensure they comply with sanctions, an employee at Chevron told Reuters."
Chevron,2017-8,"The guidelines advise staff, for instance, to avoid one-on-one meetings with sanctioned entities or officials, the employee said. In a statement, Chevron said it abides by ""a stringent code of business ethics"" and complies with applicable laws."
Chevron,2017-8,"For now, Russia's status as chief lender to PDVSA has put Rosneft in a position to supercharge its holdings and profits in the region."
Chevron,2017-8,"If Venezuela's government defaults on its debt payments - an increasingly likely scenario - Rosneft likely will be one of the entities at the front of the queue as a creditor because of its large collateral stake in U.S.-based Citgo, according to a confidential independent analysis of its debt commissioned by an investment fund and seen by Reuters."
Chevron,2017-8,"Representatives of Citgo, PDVSA'S largest foreign asset, did not respond to requests for comment."
Chevron,2017-8,"Rosneft's involvement in Venezuela can be traced back to a $4 billion arms-for-oil deal in 2006 that cemented the bond between the governments of Chavez and Putin. Chavez, a former military officer, signed the deal himself in Moscow."

Chevron,2017-8,"* Oil firms bring big budgets, offshore tech and risk experience"
Chevron,2017-8,"LONDON, Aug 1 (Reuters) - Some European oil majors have made inroads into the emerging U.S. offshore wind energy market, aiming to leverage their experience of deepwater development and the crowded offshore wind arena at home."
Chevron,2017-8,"Late entrants to the offshore wind game in Europe, which began with a project off Denmark 25 years ago and is now approaching maturity, they are looking across the Atlantic at what they view as a huge and potentially lucrative new market."
Chevron,2017-8,"Norway's Statoil has won a licence to develop a wind farm of the New York coast, is marketing its new floating turbine to California and Hawaii and is retraining some oil and gas staff to work in its wind division."
Chevron,2017-8,"Royal Dutch Shell bid for a lease offshore North Carolina earlier this year while Denmark's DONG Energy, a wind energy pioneer which agreed to sell its oil and gas business in May, is in a Massachusetts-based offshore wind consortium, holds a lease off the New Jersey coast and has opened an office in Boston."
Chevron,2017-8,"Offshore wind generation began in the United States late last year, ironically after the election of President Donald Trump. He is sceptical about climate change, complains about subsidies for renewable energy and battled against an offshore wind farm near his Scottish golf resort."
Chevron,2017-8,"However, a string of federal seabed leases were awarded before Trump took office and more are planned. [L5N1KM40R] The investment needed to get projects going is one of the biggest obstacles."
Chevron,2017-8,"""Undeniably, offshore wind is a big boys' game because it requires large amounts of capital because scale is such an important cost driver,"" said Samuel Leupold chief executive of DONG Energy's offshore wind business."
Chevron,2017-8,"While DONG has shifted decisively towards renewables, Statoil and Shell are still firmly rooted in fossil fuels and other major European oil companies, in common with their U.S. counterparts, have so far steered clear of U.S. offshore wind."
Chevron,2017-8,"Washington estimates its potential at 2,000 gigawatts (GW), many times anticipated capacity in Europe of 25 GW by 2020, but U.S. federal subsidies expire at the end of 2019 and while they may be renewed by Congress, that is no means certain."

A push into deeper U.S. waters and the bigger turbines needed to compete without subsidies will keep price tags high.[nL8N1JJ2OL]"
Chevron,2017-8,"Trump signed an executive order in March expected to roll back his predecessor Barack Obama's plan requiring states to slash carbon emissions from power plants. There is also no carbon price mechanism across the United States like those in Europe and elsewhere, although there are two regional ones."
Chevron,2017-8,"U.S. oil companies have some investments in solar and onshore wind, but when it comes to offshore wind, many say they are waiting for a time when government support is not needed."
Chevron,2017-8,"""Chevron supports renewables that are scalable and can compete without subsidies,"" said Morgan Krinklaw, a spokesman for Chevron, which owns an onshore wind farm."
Chevron,2017-8,"A report from analysts at Lazard in December pegged the cost of U.S. offshore wind at $118 MWh, around twice as much as onshore wind or combined-cycle gas turbines."
Chevron,2017-8,"Asked to comment on that figure, Statoil, which is building its first floating wind turbine park off the Scottish coast, said costs were coming down and it was working to drive them down further, partly by redeploying existing staff."
Chevron,2017-8,"The company has about 1,000 employees in the U.S. oil industry, said Stephen Bull, senior vice president of the company's wind business. ""There's scope for us to plug into our existing oil and gas supply chain,"" he added, referring to existing contracts with equipment and service suppliers."
Chevron,2017-8,"Statoil spokeswoman Elin Isaksen said she did not expect any of its offshore wind projects in the U.S. to have begun construction by 2019 and that it was too early to quote numbers for the New York project, while acknowledging there was, as yet, no supply chain."
Chevron,2017-8,"In Virginia, where Spanish utility Iberdrola's Avangrid has secured an offshore wind licence, a rich marine engineering heritage is expected to help local companies gain work. Smaller European oil and gas firms are also gaining work."
Chevron,2017-8,"JDR Cable Systems, a British company that has traditionally supplied subsea power lines to oil and gas platforms, earlier this year won a $275 million contract to provide electric cables for the largest U.S. offshore wind farm off the Maryland coast."
Chevron,2017-8,"""We are well placed to develop business in the U.S. because of the existing relationships we have in Europe,"" said John Price, global sales director for renewables at JDR."
Chevron,2017-8,"State level decision-making on electricity procurement, the next stage of getting offshore wind off the ground, is helping."
Chevron,2017-8,"Massachusetts, where DONG has secured a seabed license, last year issued a law requiring its utilities to buy up to 1.6 GW of offshore wind power by June 2027, with a tender to be held later this year."
Chevron,2017-8,"DONG's North America wind power president Thomas Bostrom said it would bid in the Massachusetts power purchase tender in December and would not comment on costs ahead of that. He too, emphasised his company was playing the long game."
Chevron,2017-8,"""As excited as we are for offshore wind in the U.S., we are still in the early days of the industry,"" Bostrom said."
Chevron,2017-8,{{20170731T161855.505+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-U.S. sanctions on Venezuela a double-edged sword (The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are her own.)
Chevron,2017-8,"WASHINGTON, July 31 (Reuters Breakingviews) - President Nicolas Maduro said Sunday's vote for a new Constituent Assembly would bring peace to the country, but the immediate impact is likely to be expanded U.S. sanctions. Fresh trade measures by Washington may embolden opposition to Maduro, including from the military. That offers hope for Venezuelans, but American companies like Phillips 66 and Chevron would share the costs."
Chevron,2017-8,"Members of the new legislative super-body elected on Sunday will have the authority to rewrite the constitution and to override the opposition-controlled National Assembly, strengthening the Socialist president's grip on power. The administration of President Donald Trump, which last week imposed sanctions on 13 of Maduro's closest allies, has threatened to respond by targeting the South American country's oil sector with new restrictions."
Chevron,2017-8,"Venezuela is the third-largest supplier of crude oil to the United States, providing an average of 741,000 barrels a day last year, according to the Energy Information Administration. U.S. companies such as Phillips 66 and Chevron, which respectively took 18.5 percent and 13.1 percent of Venezuelan crude exports in 2016, will feel the impact if Washington interrupts that trade."
Chevron,2017-8,"Even if new sanctions prohibit only exports to Venezuela, U.S. oil companies would have a lot to lose. Venezuela bought 75,000 barrels a day of light crude from the United States in 2016, or nearly 15 percent of American exports. PDVSA mixes that with its heavy crude to make it commercially viable. American refineries that sell to Venezuela would have to find alternative customers."
Chevron,2017-8,"The U.S. oil industry is already facing the costs of government sanctions against Russia and Iran. Economic measures against Venezuela might bring diplomatic success, but it would surely come at an additional price."
Chevron,2017-8,"- Venezuelans on July 30 elected members of a new Constituent Assembly backed by President Nicolas Maduro's ruling Socialist Party that will have authority to rewrite the constitution and override the opposition-led National Assembly. U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley called the vote a ""sham election"" that marked ""another step toward dictatorship."""
Chevron,2017-8,"- President Donald Trump previously threatened ""strong and swift economic actions"" against Maduro if he followed through with the election. His administration has not ruled out any options, including a ban on trade or banking activity between Venezuelan and American companies."
Chevron,2017-8,"- On July 28, the United States imposed sanctions on 13 of Maduro's closest associates, including members of the government, the military and PDVSA, the state oil company. The measure froze the officials' assets in the United States."
Chevron,2017-8,"- The two countries' oil sectors are closely linked. The United States is PDVSA's largest cash-generating export market, and the South American country is the third-largest U.S. crude oil supplier."
