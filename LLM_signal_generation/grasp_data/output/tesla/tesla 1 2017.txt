tesla,2017-1,"{{20170127T175052.715+0000}}UPDATE 1-Tesla explains cancelled order with German supplier SHW(Adds Tesla comment, background on Model 3)"
tesla,2017-1,"BERLIN, Jan 27 (Reuters) - Electric car maker Tesla Motors Inc said it cancelled a large order with Germany's SHW because the supplier failed to meet its contractual obligations and Tesla did not want to put the production of its new Model 3 sedan at risk."
tesla,2017-1,Tesla boss Elon Musk has warned in the past he would fire suppliers and reorganise internal teams who fail to meet target dates for production of the upcoming Model 3.
tesla,2017-1,On Thursday Tesla confirmed it was the customer that cancelled a 100 million euros ($107 million) order with SHW and denied it had anything to do with the new U.S. administration.
tesla,2017-1,"The loss of the order sent shares in SHW, which assembles pumps and engine components as well as brake discs, to a four-month low on Tuesday.[nL5N1FE419]"
tesla,2017-1,"German media reports said the cancellation resulted from political pressure after U.S. President Trump met chief executives, including Tesla boss Elon Musk, on Monday.[nL1N1FD105]"
tesla,2017-1,Tesla said the order was cancelled because the supplier's product did not meet its technical standards.
tesla,2017-1,"""Tesla's policy is to terminate any supplier that is unable to meet their contractual milestones or violates their non-disclosure agreement,"" the carmaker said by email on Friday."
tesla,2017-1,"""We have to be firm in this regard in order to keep the Model 3 program on schedule and prevent plot spoilers,"" Tesla said."
tesla,2017-1,"SHW said on Tuesday its customer was disgruntled over the technical specifications for axle-drive pumps which failed to meet its requirements, but SHW said it did not accept the reason."

tesla,2017-1,"Underlying operating profit fell 6.5 percent to 4.3 billion euros ($4.6 billion) last year, the group said on Friday, pushing the operating margin down to 5.8 from 6.5 percent, sliding further from Bosch's medium-term target for 8 percent."
tesla,2017-1,"Privately owned Bosch has been investing in technologies such as intelligent systems that cut down on how much power electric cars use, while divesting traditional industrial products such as starter motors and generators. [nL8N1CJ34R]"
tesla,2017-1,"It also aims to decide by the end of the year whether to start making its own cells for production of batteries to compete with Asian rivals, Chief Executive Volkmar Denner said."
tesla,2017-1,"He said such a project would cost more than Bosch's move into solar energy, which started with an investment of 1 billion euros and lost 3.7 billion euros by the time it ended in 2013."
tesla,2017-1,"The decision will depend on whether the company can make products that are better and cheaper than those of rivals such as Samsung and Panasonic <6752.T>, which recently started mass production of lithium-ion battery cells at a gigafactory in Nevada along with Tesla , according to Denner."

tesla,2017-1,"SAN FRANCISCO, Jan 26 (Reuters) - Tesla sued the former head of its Autopilot system on Thursday, alleging the executive tried to recruit Tesla engineers for his new venture with the ex-head of Google's self-driving program while still working at the electric car company."
tesla,2017-1,"Tesla Motors Inc claims that Sterling Anderson, who until early January was the non-technical program manager of Tesla's Autopilot semi-autonomous driving system, made employment offers to at least a dozen of his colleagues at Tesla."
tesla,2017-1,"Anderson's recruiting efforts for a new startup with Chris Urmson - who shepherded Alphabet's self-driving project for seven and a half years before leaving in August - occurred despite a non-soliciting agreement in his contract, Tesla said."
tesla,2017-1,"The lawsuit, filed in Superior Court of California for Santa Clara County, underscores the competitive landscape in Silicon Valley's automotive sector, where Tesla, established carmakers and unknown start-ups are all battling to be first to bring self-driving to the masses."
tesla,2017-1,Tesla has been at the vanguard of innovation. Its high-profile Autopilot allows cars to steer and stay in their lanes without hands on the wheel in certain circumstances.
tesla,2017-1,"Telsa, citing what it called a ""get-rich-quick environment"" in the sector, listed in the complaint the recent acquisition by General Motors of Cruise Automation in July for nearly $1 billion, suggesting Anderson and Urmson sought the same goal with their new Silicon Valley company, Aurora Innovation."
tesla,2017-1,"Urmson and Aurora Innovation are also named as co-defendants in the lawsuit, which alleges breach of contract and other civil claims. Tesla is seeking injunctive relief and unspecified damages."
tesla,2017-1,"Aurora said the lawsuit was without merit and ""reveals both a startling paranoia and an unhealthy fear of competition."""
tesla,2017-1,"""This abuse of the legal system is a malicious attempt to stifle a competitor and destroy personal reputations. Aurora looks forward to disproving these false allegations in court and to building a successful self-driving business,"" Aurora said in a statement."
tesla,2017-1,"The lawsuit alleges that Anderson also downloaded ""some of Tesla's most competitively sensitive information"" to his laptop, then erased and doctored files and wiped his iPhone of data ""in an attempt to conceal his misdeeds."""

tesla,2017-1,"SAN FRANCISCO, Jan 28 (Reuters) - The U.S. technology industry, a major employer of foreign workers, hit back on Saturday at President Donald Trump's sudden executive order on immigration, with some leaders calling it immoral and un-American."
tesla,2017-1,"Trump's order temporarily bars citizens of seven majority-Muslim countries from entering the United States even if they hold valid visas or permanent residence permits, a move that caught many companies off-guard. [nL1N1FI0AC]"

tesla,2017-1,"Elon Musk, the South African-born founder of Tesla and SpaceX who met recently with Trump, said on Twitter: ""The blanket entry ban on citizens from certain primarily Muslim countries is not the best way to address the country's challenges."""

tesla,2017-1,Alphabet Inc's Google urgently called back employees from overseas and told ones who might be affected by the ban not to leave the United States.
tesla,2017-1,"CEO Sundar Pichai said in an email to staff that more than 100 Google employees were affected by the order, according to a Google executive."
tesla,2017-1,"One Google employee of Iranian nationality with legal U.S. residency made it back to the United States just hours before the order took effect, the executive said."
tesla,2017-1,"""We're concerned about the impact of this order and any proposals that could impose restrictions on Googlers and their families, or that could create barriers to bringing great talent to the U.S.,"" Google said in a statement."
tesla,2017-1,"Microsoft Corp President and Chief Legal Officer Brad Smith said in a company-wide email posted on LinkedIn that 76 company employees were citizens of the seven countries in question and held U.S. work visas, and thus were directly affected by the order."
tesla,2017-1,"He said the company had not determined how many people with green cards, or permanent residence status, might be affected."
tesla,2017-1,"""As a company, Microsoft believes in a strong and balanced high-skilled immigration system,"" Smith said in the post. ""We believe in the importance of protecting legitimate and law-abiding refugees whose very lives may be at stake in immigration proceedings."""

tesla,2017-1,"BERLIN, Jan 27 (Reuters) - Electric car maker Tesla Motors Inc said it cancelled a large order with Germany's SHW because the supplier failed to meet its contractual obligations and Tesla did not want to put the production of its new Model 3 sedan at risk."
tesla,2017-1,Tesla boss Elon Musk has warned in the past he would fire suppliers and reorganise internal teams who fail to meet target dates for production of the upcoming Model 3.
tesla,2017-1,On Thursday Tesla confirmed it was the customer that cancelled a 100 million euros ($107 million) order with SHW and denied it had anything to do with the new U.S. administration.
tesla,2017-1,"The loss of the order sent shares in SHW, which assembles pumps and engine components as well as brake discs, to a four-month low on Tuesday.[nL5N1FE419]"
tesla,2017-1,"German media reports said the cancellation resulted from political pressure after U.S. President Trump met chief executives, including Tesla boss Elon Musk, on Monday.[nL1N1FD105]"
tesla,2017-1,Tesla said the order was cancelled because the supplier's product did not meet its technical standards.
tesla,2017-1,"""Tesla's policy is to terminate any supplier that is unable to meet their contractual milestones or violates their non-disclosure agreement,"" the carmaker said by email on Friday."
tesla,2017-1,"""We have to be firm in this regard in order to keep the Model 3 program on schedule and prevent plot spoilers,"" Tesla said."
tesla,2017-1,"SHW said on Tuesday its customer was disgruntled over the technical specifications for axle-drive pumps which failed to meet its requirements, but SHW said it did not accept the reason."

tesla,2017-1,"Underlying operating profit fell 6.5 percent to 4.3 billion euros ($4.6 billion) last year, the group said on Friday, pushing the operating margin down to 5.8 from 6.5 percent, sliding further from Bosch's medium-term target for 8 percent."
tesla,2017-1,"Privately owned Bosch has been investing in technologies such as intelligent systems that cut down on how much power electric cars use, while divesting traditional industrial products such as starter motors and generators. [nL8N1CJ34R]"
tesla,2017-1,"It also aims to decide by the end of the year whether to start making its own cells for production of batteries to compete with Asian rivals, Chief Executive Volkmar Denner said."
tesla,2017-1,"He said such a project would cost more than Bosch's move into solar energy, which started with an investment of 1 billion euros and lost 3.7 billion euros by the time it ended in 2013."
tesla,2017-1,"The decision will depend on whether the company can make products that are better and cheaper than those of rivals such as Samsung and Panasonic <6752.T>, which recently started mass production of lithium-ion battery cells at a gigafactory in Nevada along with Tesla , according to Denner."

tesla,2017-1,"SAN FRANCISCO, Jan 26 (Reuters) - Tesla sued the former head of its Autopilot system on Thursday, alleging the executive tried to recruit Tesla engineers for his new venture with the ex-head of Google's self-driving program while still working at the electric car company."
tesla,2017-1,"Tesla Motors Inc claims that Sterling Anderson, who until early January was the non-technical program manager of Tesla's Autopilot semi-autonomous driving system, made employment offers to at least a dozen of his colleagues at Tesla."
tesla,2017-1,"Anderson's recruiting efforts for a new startup with Chris Urmson - who shepherded Alphabet's self-driving project for seven and a half years before leaving in August - occurred despite a non-soliciting agreement in his contract, Tesla said."
tesla,2017-1,"The lawsuit, filed in Superior Court of California for Santa Clara County, underscores the competitive landscape in Silicon Valley's automotive sector, where Tesla, established carmakers and unknown start-ups are all battling to be first to bring self-driving to the masses."
tesla,2017-1,Tesla has been at the vanguard of innovation. Its high-profile Autopilot allows cars to steer and stay in their lanes without hands on the wheel in certain circumstances.
tesla,2017-1,"Telsa, citing what it called a ""get-rich-quick environment"" in the sector, listed in the complaint the recent acquisition by General Motors of Cruise Automation in July for nearly $1 billion, suggesting Anderson and Urmson sought the same goal with their new Silicon Valley company, Aurora Innovation."
tesla,2017-1,"Urmson and Aurora Innovation are also named as co-defendants in the lawsuit, which alleges breach of contract and other civil claims. Tesla is seeking injunctive relief and unspecified damages."
tesla,2017-1,"Aurora said the lawsuit was without merit and ""reveals both a startling paranoia and an unhealthy fear of competition."""
tesla,2017-1,"""This abuse of the legal system is a malicious attempt to stifle a competitor and destroy personal reputations. Aurora looks forward to disproving these false allegations in court and to building a successful self-driving business,"" Aurora said in a statement."
tesla,2017-1,"The lawsuit alleges that Anderson also downloaded ""some of Tesla's most competitively sensitive information"" to his laptop, then erased and doctored files and wiped his iPhone of data ""in an attempt to conceal his misdeeds."""

tesla,2017-1,"The TPP accord, backed heavily by U.S. business, was negotiated by former Democratic President Barack Obama's administration but never approved by Congress."
tesla,2017-1,"Obama had framed TPP, which excluded China, as an effort to write Asia's trade rules before Beijing could, establishing U.S. economic leadership in the region as part of his ""pivot to Asia."""
tesla,2017-1,China has proposed a Free Trade Area of the Asia Pacific and has also championed the Southeast Asian-backed Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership.
tesla,2017-1,Trump has sparked worries in Japan and elsewhere in the Asia-Pacific with his opposition to the TPP and his campaign demands for U.S. allies to pay more for their security.
tesla,2017-1,"His trade stance mirrors a growing feeling among Americans that international trade deals have hurt the U.S. job market. Republicans have long held the view that free trade is a must, but that mood has been changing."
tesla,2017-1,"""It's going to be very difficult to fight that fight,"" said Lanhee Chen, a Hoover Institution fellow who was domestic policy adviser to 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney. ""Trump is reflecting a trend that has been apparent for many years."""

tesla,2017-1,"Chris Lattner, who served at Apple for more than a decade, said in a online message to Apple developers on Tuesday morning that he would ""leave Apple later this month to pursue an opportunity in another space"" without saying which company he planned to join."
tesla,2017-1,"Later in the day, Tesla posted a message on the company's website saying that Lattner had been hired as vice president of Autopilot software but did not say when he would start work there. Tesla declined to comment beyond the announcement. Apple confirmed the departure but would not comment beyond Lattner's posted message."
tesla,2017-1,"The move is a significant win for Tesla, bringing a high-profile figure in the world of software development for a position that previously did not have a full-time leader. Tesla's Autopilot was overseen on an interim basis by the software chief Jinnah Hosein of SpaceX, which is also headed by Tesla Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk."
tesla,2017-1,Autopilot is the hardware and software system on Tesla vehicles that allows self-driving in some situations but still requires drivers to keep their hands on the steering wheel. Federal safety regulators in the United States are examining whether Autopilot played a role in a fatal crash in Florida last year [nL1N19Y0L4].
tesla,2017-1,"Lattner most recently served as a senior director in the developer tools department at Apple and was best known for introducing Swift, a programming language that made it easier for software developers to write apps for iOS, the operating system that powers iPhones and iPads."
tesla,2017-1,"In addition to developing Swift at Apple, Lattner also led a successful push to make the programming language ""open source,"" meaning that developers could incorporate it into their applications without having to pay fees to Apple. The move was a first for Apple, which until then had typically tightly controlled the technology it created. Microsoft Corp and Google parent Alphabet Inc have also either published or contributed to open-source programming languages."

tesla,2017-1,{{20170103T192635.889+0000}}UPDATE 4-Ford scraps plan for $1.6 bln plant in Mexico after Trump criticism(Adds Mark Fields comment saying decision not result of Trump pressure)
tesla,2017-1,"FLAT ROCK, Mich./WASHINGTON, Jan 3 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co said Tuesday it will cancel a planned $1.6 billion factory in Mexico and invest $700 million at a Michigan factory, after President-elect Donald Trump had harshly criticized the Mexico investment plan."
tesla,2017-1,"The second largest U.S. automaker said it would build new electric, hybrid and autonomous vehicles at the Flat Rock, Michigan plant and add 700 jobs."
tesla,2017-1,Ford Chief Executive Mark Fields said the decision to cancel the new Mexico factory was the result of sagging demand for small cars in North America and not because Trump was elected president. He told Fox Business that the automaker would have made the same decision even if Trump had not been elected.
tesla,2017-1,"""There was no quid pro quo because there was no negotiation"" with Trump over the decision to cancel the plant, Fields said."
tesla,2017-1,"Fields told reporters the decision related to the need to ""fully utilize capacity at existing facilities"" amid declining sales of small and medium sized cars such as the Focus and Fusion."
tesla,2017-1,"Fields also endorsed ""pro growth"" tax and regulatory policies advocated by Trump and the Republican-led Congress. ""This is a vote of confidence for President-Elect Trump and some of the policies he may be pursuing,"" Fields said."
tesla,2017-1,"Trump repeatedly said during the election campaign that if elected he would not allow Ford to open the new plant in Mexico, which he called an ""absolute disgrace"" and would slap hefty tariffs taxes on imported Ford vehicles."
tesla,2017-1,Ford executive chairman Bill Ford Jr. told reporters he spoke with Trump to notify him of the decision. The company said the decision was influenced by Trump's policy goals such as lowering taxes and regulations but that there were no negotiations over the decision announced on Tuesday.
tesla,2017-1,"By contrast, Trump's team held talks with United Technologies Corp in November before the company agreed to keep about 800 jobs at its Carrier air conditioning unit in Indiana out of 2,100 set to go to Mexico. Trump has also held high profile meetings with the chief executives of Boeing and Lockheed Martin to talk about the cost of military contracts."
tesla,2017-1,"Also on Tuesday, Trump threatened to impose a ""big border tax"" on General Motors Co for making some of its Chevrolet Cruze cars in Mexico. [nL1N1ET0DB]"
tesla,2017-1,"The New York businessman, who has vowed to bring back American jobs that have been outsourced overseas and be tough on illegal immigration from Mexico, takes office on Jan. 20."
tesla,2017-1,"Fields said Ford will build a battery electric SUV with a 300-mile driving range at the Michigan plant by 2020 -- taking on companies like Tesla Motors Inc , Volkswagen AG and GM -- and will launch production there by 2021 of a fully autonomous vehicle without a steering wheel or a brake pedal for use in ride services fleets."
tesla,2017-1,"Ford also plans new hybrid versions of its F-150 pickup truck, Mustang and police vehicles by 2020 as the auto industry faces rising fuel efficiency mandates."
tesla,2017-1,"Ford will add 700 jobs at the Flat Rock plant, Fields said, to cheers from union workers gathered at the factory for the announcement."
tesla,2017-1,"Ford in April announced it would invest $1.6 billion in the new plant in San Luis Potosi, Mexico to build small cars. The company said it will shift production from Michigan of its Focus to an existing plant in Hermosillo, Mexico."
tesla,2017-1,Trump tweeted a link on Tuesday to a story about the decision.
tesla,2017-1,"Ford shares rose 3.3 percent to $12.54, up $0.41 a share, while the Mexican peso fell on Tuesday to touch its weakest level in seven weeks. [nL1N1ET0QS]"

tesla,2017-1,{{20170103T092124.072+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-Exec pay is crying out for a race to the bottom(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.)
tesla,2017-1,"LONDON, Jan 3 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Romantic novelist Jilly Cooper wrote in 1979 that society divides neatly into two groups: the Guilty and the Cross. She was referring to Britain, but the phenomenon is now global. Corporate bosses with eight-digit pay packages rank among the Guilty. If they want to placate the increasingly empowered Cross, they could tender their services more cheaply - or even free."
tesla,2017-1,"They could do worse than copy an American invention: the $1 CEO. That label described corporate chieftains who took a pittance of a salary during World War Two. Today's company boss could go one better and work just for the love of their job. No pay, no shares, just prestige and the sense of a job well done. Staff and shareholders would be happy, not least because there would be more to go around."
tesla,2017-1,"The ""Free-EO"" should not be confused with those corporate executives, mostly in the tech sector, who already earn $1 or less but take home masses of share options, or own large stakes in their companies. Tesla boss Elon Musk and Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg eschew proper pay not because they consider themselves the Guilty but because they are already rich. Deutsche Bank's ex-boss Anshu Jain advised the company for free after he resigned in 2015, but that was a punishment more than a sacrifice."
tesla,2017-1,"Genuine altruism comes with a catch. A chief executive who works for nothing might have no incentive to do more than a mediocre job. But there's an answer to that too, this time from China. Some Chinese banks in the 19th century used to take executives' family members as human collateral, to be used as indentured servants in the event of misbehaviour. Then again, any modern executive who takes that package probably doesn't need such inducements."
