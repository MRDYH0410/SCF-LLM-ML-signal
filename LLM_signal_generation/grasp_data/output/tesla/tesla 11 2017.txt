tesla,2017-11,"Musk, the chief executive of electric car maker Tesla Inc and rocket company SpaceX, recently started the Boring Company to build transport tunnels for the system, which he says would be far faster than current high-speed trains and use electromagnetic propulsion."
tesla,2017-11,"""Although cost estimates for the project are not yet known, the RFQ (Request for Qualifications) stipulates that the O'Hare Express Service will be funded solely by project-specific revenues (like fares or advertising) and financed entirely by the concessionaire,"" Mayor Emanuel's office said in a statement."
tesla,2017-11,"Musk is seeking to revolutionize transportation by sending passengers and cargo packed into pods through an intercity system of giant vacuum tubes known as the ""hyperloop."""
tesla,2017-11,"When asked on Twitter to elaborate on his ""high-speed loop"" proposal that would link O'Hare Airport to downtown Chicago, Musk tweeted, ""A Loop is like a Hyperloop, but without drawing a vacuum inside the tube."""
tesla,2017-11,"""Don't need to get rid of air friction for short routes,"" Musk added."
tesla,2017-11,"Passengers will travel in ""electric pods for sure. Rails maybe, maybe not,"" Musk said in another reply."

tesla,2017-11,"SAN FRANCISCO, Nov 29 (Reuters) - A self-driving General Motors Co Bolt slowly drove more than two miles through crowded San Francisco streets in its media debut on Tuesday, but double-parked cars and orange traffic cones tripped up the computer driver, and a taco truck stumped the machine."
tesla,2017-11,"GM's self-driving unit, Cruise Automation, gave reporters rides on Tuesday, the first public roadtrips for non-employees in its cars which have been tested in San Francisco, Phoenix and Detroit."
tesla,2017-11,"Major automakers as well as technology leaders like Alphabet Inc and Intel Corp have poured billions into autonomous vehicle research, although fully self-driving cars are a work in progress. Robo-taxi service is seen as the main use for most self-driving vehicles, including the Bolt."
tesla,2017-11,"""Our mission is to bring this technology to commercial deployment at scale, with safety, as soon as we humanly can do that,"" GM President Dan Ammann told reporters. He repeated Chief Executive Mary Barra's promise in October that GM would roll out self-driving cars within ""quarters, not years."""
tesla,2017-11,"During a roughly 15-minute ride in a busy area of San Francisco over a 2.2 mile (3.5km) trip, the Cruise-enhanced electric Bolt carrying a Reuters journalist encountered 117 people, 4 bikes and 129 cars, according to the car's sensors."
tesla,2017-11,"The car, never moving more than 20 miles per hour, navigated urban traffic, a tram line, construction zones, pedestrians crossing streets and many double-parked vehicles. Urban environments are as much as 46 times more complex than suburban areas, Cruise CEO Kyle Vogt said."
tesla,2017-11,"The Bolt reacted more conservatively than a human driver, for example slowing to a near stop after sensing a bike approaching in the opposite lane."
tesla,2017-11,"""Looking for a clear path"" screens facing the driver and passengers read several times during the trip, when the car stopped next to some traffic cones or behind double-parked vehicles. After pauses, it restarted and passed the obstacles by itself."
tesla,2017-11,"A taco truck was too much, though. The Bolt's human backup driver disengaged the system and took the wheel after the car waited for more than a minute behind the truck where construction workers ordered lunch."
tesla,2017-11,"Vogt said those issues would improve over time and that the winner of the self-driving car race would be the one that first launches at ""massive scale"" rather than just being the first to market a model."

tesla,2017-11,"LOS ANGELES, Nov 29 (Reuters) - Germany's BMW AG is talking with other automakers ""around the world"" to try to find partners to lower the cost of electrifying its future Mini small cars, management board member Peter Schwarzenbauer told Reuters."
tesla,2017-11,"""We are talking to many OEMs (manufacturers) around the world, not only in China, (about) how to electrify smaller cars,"" Schwarzenbauer said. ""There's no final conclusion on it."""
tesla,2017-11,Chinese automaker Great Wall Motor Co <601633.SS> said last month it was discussing a possible venture to build Mini vehicles in China. BMW currently does not build Mini vehicles outside Europe. [nL8N1MO2M8]
tesla,2017-11,"Schwarzenbauer declined to discuss the Great Wall situation, saying ""this was speculation."""
tesla,2017-11,"However, he said building smaller electric cars was challenging, not only because of the financial costs, but also the engineering problem of fitting batteries with sufficient range into a smaller vehicle package."
tesla,2017-11,BMW has worked with rivals before to share the costs of clean vehicle technology. The automaker has a partnership with Japan's Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T> to develop fuel cell vehicles.
tesla,2017-11,"BMW has said it plans to launch a new, electric Mini model in 2019. Eventually, Mini could become an entirely electric brand, aimed at urban consumers, Schwarzenbauer said."
tesla,2017-11,"Mini sales in the United States have fallen 10 percent through the first ten months of this year, as demand for many smaller cars has waned in favor of sport-utility vehicles and trucks."
tesla,2017-11,"""It's really only in the U.S. where we are facing this with Mini,"" Schwarzenbauer said."
tesla,2017-11,"BMW will not try to reverse that trend by adding larger SUVs to the Mini lineup, Schwarzenbauer said. Instead, he said, ""the way for Mini in the U.S. is ... building the Mini brand in the direction of the electric urban mobility company."""
tesla,2017-11,"On a separate issue, Schwarzenbauer said BMW intended to offer a self-driving car planned to debut in 2021 at a price that could be below $100,000."
tesla,2017-11,"The iNEXT model, which BMW previewed earlier this year, will be offered to individuals, ride services fleets and put into service in BMW fleets, Schwarzenbauer said."
tesla,2017-11,"""By 2021, you will have a lot of people who want to own this car,"" he said. ""It will be a normal price. We are thinking of scaling this. To bring a $150,000 electric car is nice, but it will not really scale."""
tesla,2017-11,"When it launches, the iNEXT may not be offered with complete, so-called Level 5, autonomy because the regulatory and legal frameworks for such a vehicle likely won't be in place, Schwarzenbauer said."

tesla,2017-11,"The luxury cars regularly require fixes before they can leave the factory, according to the workers. Quality checks have routinely revealed defects in more than 90 percent of Model S and Model X vehicles inspected after assembly, these individuals said, citing figures from Tesla's internal tracking system as recently as October. Some of these people told Reuters of seeing problems as far back as 2012."
tesla,2017-11,"Tesla Inc said its quality control process is unusually rigorous, designed to flag and correct the tiniest imperfections. It declined to provide post-assembly defect rates to Reuters or comment on those cited by employees."
tesla,2017-11,"The world's most efficient automakers, such as Toyota <7203.T>, average post-manufacturing fixes on fewer than 10 percent of their cars, according to industry experts. Getting quality right during initial assembly is crucial, they said, because repairs waste time and money."
tesla,2017-11,"At Tesla ""so much goes into rework after the car is done ... that's where their money is being spent,"" a former Tesla supervisor said."
tesla,2017-11,The Silicon Valley automaker said the majority of its post-assembly defects are minor and resolved in a matter of minutes.
tesla,2017-11,"Tesla has enthralled consumers with sleek designs, clean technology and legendary acceleration on its pricey cars. A Consumer Reports survey found 91 percent of Tesla owners would buy again."
tesla,2017-11,"Still, the magazine and market researcher J.D. Power have dinged the company on quality, citing troubles such as faulty door handles and body panel gaps. Bernstein analyst A.M. (Toni) Sacconaghi, Jr. test-drove one of the company's new Model 3 sedans earlier this month, writing that the fit and finish were ""relatively poor."" Tesla owners have complained on web forums of annoying rattles, buggy software and poor seals that allow rainwater to seep into the interior or trunk."
tesla,2017-11,"Auto industry experts say the company's survival now depends on its ability to crank out high-quality cars in volume as it begins to build its first mass-market car, the Model 3, which starts at $35,000."
tesla,2017-11,Tesla has never turned an annual profit and is burning through $1 billion a quarter. That is unsustainable without fresh cash or a big increase in sales to mainstream customers who may prove less forgiving of potential defects.
tesla,2017-11,"""We've never doubted Tesla's ability to make exciting products with top specifications, but there's a difference between unveiling something and then actually making it perfectly in large volume. Tesla has not perfected the latter yet,"" Morningstar analyst David Whiston wrote earlier this month."
tesla,2017-11,"Musk has vowed Tesla would become ""the best manufacturer on Earth,"" helped by a new, highly automated assembly line and a simpler design for the Model 3. However, production woes have slowed deliveries of the much-anticipated sedan.[nL2N1N72DJ]"
tesla,2017-11,"Snags are normal with any new launch. But chronic defects with Tesla's established Models S and X show a company still struggling to master basic manufacturing, workers said."
tesla,2017-11,"Known as ""kickbacks"" within Tesla, these vehicles have glitches as minor as dents and scratches to more complex troubles such as malfunctioning seats. Easy fixes are made swiftly on the factory floor, workers said."
tesla,2017-11,"Trickier cases head to one of Tesla's outdoor parking lots to await repair. The backlog in one of those two lots, dubbed the ""yard,"" has exceeded 2,000 vehicles at times, workers told Reuters."
tesla,2017-11,People with knowledge of Tesla's internal quality data shared those figures with Reuters. The news agency was unable to confirm the information independently.
tesla,2017-11,"Defects included ""doors not closing, material trim, missing parts, all kinds of stuff. Loose objects, water leaks, you name it,"" another former supervisor said. ""We've been building a Model S since 2012. How do we still have water leaks?"""
tesla,2017-11,"Tesla disputed workers' portrayal of the automaker as struggling to produce defect-free vehicles. A spokesperson described a rigorous process that requires all cars to pass more than 500 inspections and tests. Any reworking of cars after assembly reflects the company's commitment to quality, the spokesperson said."
tesla,2017-11,"""Our goal is to produce perfect cars for every customer,"" Tesla said in a statement. ""Therefore, we review every vehicle for even the smallest refinement. Most customers would never notice the work that is done post production, but we care about even a fraction of a millimeter body gap difference or a slight paint gloss texture. We then feed these improvements back to production in a pursuit of perfection."""
tesla,2017-11,"Employees who worked on Model S and Model X described pressure to keep the assembly line moving, even when problems emerged. Some told of batches of cars being sent through with parts missing - windshields in one case, bumpers in another - because there were none on hand. The understanding, they said, was that these and other flaws would be fixed later."
tesla,2017-11,"Quality inspectors would sometimes find more defects than those reported by workers in the internal tracking system when a car came off the line. ""We'd see two issues, that's pretty good. But then we'd dig in and there would be like 15 or 20,"" one person said."
tesla,2017-11,"One persistently tricky area was alignment, where body parts had to be ""muscled,"" in the words of the senior manager, to a certain degree of flushness. Not every team follows the same rule book, workers said, resulting in gaps of different size."
tesla,2017-11,"Tesla denied that its quality control is inconsistent and said its ""extensive"" process for locating and fixing errors was ""very successful."""
tesla,2017-11,"Some workers traced the challenges to Musk's determination to launch vehicles faster than the industry norm by shortening the design process, skipping some pre-production testing, then making improvements on the fly. [nL1N1HW025] Such improvisation leads to high repair rates, employees said."
tesla,2017-11,"For a March report called ""Beyond the Hype,"" J.D. Power found creaks, scratches and poor door alignment on new Model S and Model X vehicles, issues it blamed on the company's lack of manufacturing experience. The overall quality of Tesla vehicles, it concluded, was ""not competitive"" within the luxury segment, lacking ""precision and attention to detail."""
tesla,2017-11,"Such sloppiness is a rarity in luxury brands such as Mercedes-Benz and BMW , said Kathleen Rizk, director of global automotive consulting at J.D. Power."
tesla,2017-11,"""Those companies have been manufacturing forever,"" she said. ""They have stopgaps."""
tesla,2017-11,"Tesla said its high customer satisfaction proves it is building the ""safest and best-performing cars available today."""

tesla,2017-11,"Quite simply, unless someone works out how to engineer cobalt out of the lithium-ion battery, the world is going to need a lot more cobalt and it's still going to get most of it from the DRC."
tesla,2017-11,"This is a dangerously concentrated dependency, leaving a whole supply chain beholden to the political, legal and ethical uncertainties surrounding the DRC's mining sector."
tesla,2017-11,"The only comparison, S&P Global suggests, is a similar concentration of platinum production in South Africa."
tesla,2017-11,"When that country was roiled by a wave of industrial action in 2014, it translated into a 20 percent dent in global supply that year. At least there were above-ground platinum stocks to fill the supply gap."

tesla,2017-11,"DETROIT, Nov 20 (Reuters) - Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd , one of India's oldest vehicle manufacturers, is testing autonomous tractors, trucks and cars, while moving closer to bringing electric vehicles to the United States, Chairman Anand Mahindra said on Monday."
tesla,2017-11,"The company, which opened a new North American headquarters north of Detroit on Monday, is considering when to begin U.S. sales of the vehicles, Anand Mahindra said in an interview."
tesla,2017-11,"It is also weighing whether the vehicles should carry the Mahindra brand or those of its affiliates Pininfarina, the famed Italian design house; and Ssangyong Motor Co <003620.KS>, a Korean manufacturer of utility and crossover vehicles, he added."
tesla,2017-11,"Mahindra & Mahindra bought Ssangyong in 2011 and Pininfarina in 2015. The Indian parent is collaborating with both companies on the development of electric vehicles, including premium models for Pininfarina that likely would compete with Tesla Inc . Anand Mahindra suggested that Ssangyong and Pininfarina electric vehicles might be sold in both the United States and China."
tesla,2017-11,"Earlier this year, Autocar India reported that Pininfarina was developing a family of electric vehicles for China's Hybrid Kinetic Group, as well as its own electric supercar. The magazine also reported that Ssangyong planned to launch an all-electric crossover vehicle in Korea in 2019."
tesla,2017-11,"In early November, Ssangyong said it had received approval to begin testing of autonomous vehicles in Korea, but did not say when it planned to produce them."
tesla,2017-11,"Anand Mahindra said his company, one of the world's largest tractor manufacturers, had been testing self-driving models since it bought a minority stake in Japan's Mitsubishi Agriculture Machinery in 2015. Mahindra & Mahindra operates several U.S. tractor assembly plants."
tesla,2017-11,"While work on the self-driving vehicles is still in the early stages, Mahindra & Mahindra has been building electric vehicles in India since the mid-1990s, when it developed a small fleet battery-powered, three-wheeled rickshaws for use in Delhi, the chairman said."
tesla,2017-11,"Mahindra & Mahindra bought Reva Electric Car Co, a small Bangalore-based manufacturer, in 2010 and transformed it into Mahindra Electric Mobility Ltd, which designs and builds compact electric vehicles for the Indian market."

tesla,2017-11,"Most of the customers who announced plans to put down $5,000 deposits for the Tesla Semi indicated they wanted to test a few of the vehicles. Wal-Mart said it plans to order a total of 15 Tesla trucks, five for the United States and ten for Canada. The company operates a fleet of about 6,000 trucks in the United States."

tesla,2017-11,"LONDON, Nov 17 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Elon Musk has found a new way to help satisfy Tesla's unquenchable thirst for capital. The money-losing $53 billion electric carmaker unveiled a surprise new Roadster model while showing off a battery-powered truck. The flourish came with a financial twist: pre-orders for the first-edition supercar alone may raise $250 million up front."
tesla,2017-11,"Thursday's event provided some details of Musk's planned entrance into the electric road-haulage market: a truck with a 500-mile range at full load. Already some analysts see the big rig as a distraction from what Musk himself has called the ""manufacturing hell"" of getting production of the company's Model 3 sedan anywhere near the eventually anticipated 500,000-plus a year."
tesla,2017-11,"The Roadster, which Musk said would hit the road in 2020, a year after the truck, only adds to the company's ambitious plans. Moreover, they all cost more money for a carmaker that is already burning through well over $1 billion of cash per quarter."
tesla,2017-11,"Tesla in August sold $1.8 billion of junk bonds at a 5.3 percent coupon, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in an offering boosted from an initially planned $1.5 billion. At an enterprise value well over 100 times analysts' average estimate of 2017 EBITDA, according to Thomson Reuters data, Tesla stock is pricey enough to issue more, too. Despite a recent slide of more than 10 percent it's still up 46 percent this year."
tesla,2017-11,"- Tesla on Nov. 16 unveiled a new Roadster model, upstaging its own debut of an electric heavy-duty truck, the Semi. Chief Executive Elon Musk said the new $200,000 sports car would be the fastest production car ever."
tesla,2017-11,"- Reservations for the new model require a $50,000 payment, according to Tesla's website, but an initial 1,000 ""Founders Series"" cars will cost $250,000, to be paid in full up front."
tesla,2017-11,"- Musk did not give a price for the truck, or say how or where either product would be built, but he said the Semi would begin production in 2019 and that the Roadster would be available a year later."
tesla,2017-11,"- Some analysts fear the truck will be an expensive distraction for Tesla, which is burning cash, has never posted an annual profit, and is in self-described ""manufacturing hell"" starting up production of its $35,000 Model 3 sedan."

tesla,2017-11,"Nov 17 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc on Friday got high-profile orders from Wal-Mart Stores Inc and fleet operator J.B. Hunt for its future electric truck, but would-be customers indicated they are giving the big rig a try, not buying in volume."
tesla,2017-11,"Most of the customers who announced plans to put down $5,000 deposits for the Tesla Semi indicated they wanted to test a few of the vehicles. Wal-Mart said it plans to order a total of 15 Tesla trucks, five for the United States and ten for Canada. The company operates a fleet of about 6,000 trucks in the United States."

tesla,2017-11,Hunt did not say how many of the vehicles it would reserve. Tesla unveiled the Semi on Thursday without specifying prices.[nL1N1NM1N4]
tesla,2017-11,"The early orders reflected the uncertainty about how the market for electric commercial vehicles will develop. About 260,000 Class-8 trucks are produced in North America annually, and that market has a value of about $28.6 billion, said Don Ake, vice president of commercial vehicles at FTR, an industry economics research firm."
tesla,2017-11,"The 500-mile (800 km) range between charges that Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk promised on Thursday for the Tesla Semi is about half the range between fill-ups of a diesel Class 8 truck. Heavy batteries cut payload and add cost, potential deal killers for fleet buyers focused on operating cost per mile. [nL1N1NM1N4]"
tesla,2017-11,"However, Tesla, and incumbent truck makers such as Daimler AG , Navistar International Corp and its partner Volkswagen AG are investing in electric trucks in a bet that the market will shift over the next decade."
tesla,2017-11,"For global truck makers, the biggest market for electric trucks will likely be China, where the government is moving aggressively to convert the transportation system to electrified vehicles."
tesla,2017-11,"Regulators around the world are ratcheting up pressure on the trucking industry to slash emissions of soot and carbon dioxide from diesel trucks. In the United States, the government has estimated that heavy-duty trucks represent 4 percent of vehicles on the road but account for 20 percent of carbon emissions. Under President Barack Obama, the United States required truck makers to boost fuel efficiency through 2027."
tesla,2017-11,"Separately, some cities and ports are discussing banning or heavily taxing diesel vehicles. The Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach in Southern California have a goal of only having zero-emissions trucks by 2035. California is committing $140 million to subsidize low-carbon freight transportation."
tesla,2017-11,"Tesla has been trying to convince the trucking community that it can build an affordable electric big rig with the range and capacity to compete with relatively low-cost, time-tested diesel trucks."
tesla,2017-11,"It was not clear how many orders for Semis Tesla had in hand. Among companies announcing plans to acquire small numbers of Tesla trucks were Michigan retailer Meijer Inc [MEIJR.UL] and Canadian retail chain Loblaw , which has said it wants an entirely electric corporate vehicle fleet by 2030.

tesla,2017-11,"Chief Executive Elon Musk shocked industry-watchers by launching a $200,000 sports car on Thursday, along with two electric trucks, possibly adding more logistical nightmares even as it wrestles with production issues related to its Model 3 sedan."

tesla,2017-11,"Tesla's ambitious plans would need a steady flow of cash, analysts said."
tesla,2017-11,Jefferies analyst Philippe Houchois estimated that Tesla would need to raise $2.5 billion to $3 billion to keep production running smoothly.
tesla,2017-11,"""Longer term, we continue to think the capital intensity of the business model will keep returns below best-in-class auto OEMs,"" Houchois said in a research note."
tesla,2017-11,Tesla spent $1.1 billion on its auto business in the third quarter and expects expenses of $1 billion in the current one.
tesla,2017-11,The company had about $3.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents for the period ended Sept. 30. The company raised $1.8 billion by selling debt in August.
tesla,2017-11,"Although Tesla has made inroads among luxury car buyers with its Model S sedan and Model X SUV, it is the Model 3 on which the company's long-term success rests."
tesla,2017-11,"The Model 3 sedan is expected to go into production in 2018, electric trucks in 2019. Production for the new Roadster sports car, a likely Ferrari rival, will start in 2020."

tesla,2017-11,"Houchois called the plan interesting, noting that it would help Tesla raise $250 million plus the $50,000 deposits on reservations."
tesla,2017-11,But the plan to make the trucks is likely to open up new growth areas for Tesla as the global race heats up to overcome the challenges of substituting batteries for diesel engines.

tesla,2017-11,The showmanship wowed the crowd although some analysts' heads started throbbing at the variety of new projects launched as the company is struggling to produce the more affordable sedan upon which its future depends.
tesla,2017-11,"As the presentation appeared to end, the Tesla Semi opened its trailer, and the Roadster drove out. The sports car with a removable glass roof is an updated version of Tesla's first production vehicle. It can seat four and travel 620 miles (1,000 km) on a single charge, a new record for an electric vehicle, Musk said. It can go from 0 to 60 miles per hour (100 km per hour) in 1.9 seconds with a maximum speed over 250 mph, which would make it the fastest car in general production."
tesla,2017-11,"""You'll be able to travel from LA to San Francisco, and back, at highway speed without recharging. The point of doing this is to just give a hardcore smackdown to gasoline cars. Driving a gasoline sports car is going to feel like a steam engine with a side of quiche,"" Musk boasted."
tesla,2017-11,"The first 1,000 cars will cost $250,000 each, paid in full up front, with later models starting at $200,000."
tesla,2017-11,"Musk did not give a price for the Semi, or say how or where either product would be built, but he said the truck would begin production in 2019 and that the Roadster would be available a year later."
tesla,2017-11,"Musk has described electric trucks as Tesla's next effort to move the economy away from fossil fuels through projects including electric cars, solar roofs and power storage."

tesla,2017-11,"Tesla also has to convince the trucking community that it can build an affordable electric big rig with the range and cargo capacity to compete with relatively low-cost, time-tested diesel trucks. The heavy batteries eat into the weight of cargo an electric truck can haul."
tesla,2017-11,"The truck can go up to 500 miles (800 km) at maximum weight at highway speed, Musk said, without giving the size of the payload. Musk said the Class 8 vehicle, the heaviest weight classification for trucks, in 30 minutes can recharge the battery enough to go 400 miles, and that Tesla would build a global, solar-powered network of ""megachargers."""
tesla,2017-11,"Diesel trucks are capable of traveling up to 1,000 miles (1,600 km) on a single tank of fuel. Musk said diesel trucks were 20 percent more expensive per mile to operate than his electric truck."
tesla,2017-11,"Self-driving technology would allow the trucks to travel in convoys, where only the front truck would need a driver, making trucks cheaper than rail, Musk added."
tesla,2017-11,"That vision, however, faces an uncertain regulatory future, since Congress is considering exempting heavy duty trucks from looser self-driving rules in the works, after truckers lobbied that safety and millions of jobs could be at risk."
tesla,2017-11,"The day cab - which is not a sleeper - has a less prominent nose than on a classic truck, and the battery is built into the chassis. Tesla designed the cab for good visibility, with a center seat flanked by two touch screens."
tesla,2017-11,"Tesla showed off the semi on a webcast which offered reservations for the truck at $5,000 each, but Musk did not discuss reservation volume."
tesla,2017-11,"Old Dominion Freight Line Inc , the fourth-largest U.S. less-than-truckload carrier, which consolidates smaller freight loads onto a single truck, said it was not signing on."
tesla,2017-11,"""We met with Tesla and at this time we do not see a fit with their product and our fleet,"" Dave Bates, senior vice president of operations, said in an email, without elaborating."
tesla,2017-11,Tesla faces a much more crowded field for electric trucks than it did when it introduced its electric cars.
tesla,2017-11,"Manufacturers such as Daimler AG , Navistar International Corp and Volkswagen AG are joining a host of start-ups racing to overcome the challenges of substituting batteries for diesel engines as regulators crack down on carbon dioxide and soot pollution."
tesla,2017-11,"Still, manufacturers are mostly focused on medium-duty trucks, not the heavy big rig market Tesla is after."
tesla,2017-11,"Tesla would need to invest substantially to create a factory for those trucks. The company is currently spending about $1 billion per quarter, largely to set up the Model 3 factory, and is contemplating a factory in China to build cars."

tesla,2017-11,{{20171116T120000.983+0000}}Tesla to unveil electric big-rig truck in midst of Model 3 factory 'hell'By Alexandria Sage
tesla,2017-11,"SAN FRANCISCO, Nov 16 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc on Thursday will unveil a prototype electric big-rig truck, which may be able to drive itself, throwing the company into a new market even as it struggles to roll out an affordable sedan which is central to the company's future."
tesla,2017-11,"Chief Executive Elon Musk has described electric trucks as Tesla's next effort to move the economy away from fossil fuels through projects including electric cars, solar roofs and power storage."
tesla,2017-11,"But some analysts fear the truck, named Tesla Semi, will be an expensive distraction for Tesla, which is burning cash, has never posted an annual profit, and is in self-described ""manufacturing hell"" starting up production of the $35,000 Model 3 sedan. [nL2N1N72DJ]"
tesla,2017-11,"The young market for electric cargo trucks is mostly focused on medium duty, rather than the heavy big rig market Tesla is after. The power capacity, weight and cost of batteries all limit a truck's ability, analysts say."
tesla,2017-11,"Reuters in August reported that Tesla was working on self-driving technology for the truck. Several Silicon Valley companies see long-haul trucking as a prime early market for the self-driving technology, citing the relatively consistent speeds and little cross-traffic trucks face on interstate highways and the benefits of allowing drivers to rest while trucks travel. [nL1N1KV1X5]"
tesla,2017-11,"The truck would have a working range of 200 to 300 miles (320 to 480 km), at the low end of what is considered ""long-haul"" trucking, Reuters reported. [nL2N1LA0XJ] Diesel trucks are capable of traveling up to 1,000 miles (1,600 km) on a single tank of fuel."
tesla,2017-11,"Musk, who has pushed back the debut twice, said this week that the truck would ""blow your mind clear out of your skull"" when it was introduced in a webcast on Thursday at 8 p.m. PST (0400 GMT Friday)."
tesla,2017-11,"""Semi specs are better than anything I've seen reported so far. Semi eng/design team work is aces, but other needs are greater right now,"" Musk tweeted in October, announcing the second delay."
tesla,2017-11,"""It can transform into a robot, fight aliens and make one hell of a latte,"" he added on Wednesday, posting a picture of a backlit, shadowed Semi with trapezoidal blue headlights. He has forecast large-scale production within a couple of years."
tesla,2017-11,"A Tesla truck with a range of 300 to 450 miles would be able to address less than half of the total semi-truck market, estimated Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi in a note on Monday."
tesla,2017-11,"""It is somewhat unclear why the company needs another major initiative ... on its already full plate,"" wrote Sacconaghi."

tesla,2017-11,"Nov 15 (Reuters) - General Motors Co plans to launch a new family of electric vehicles in 2021 that will cost less to build and make a profit for the U.S. No. 1 automaker, Chief Executive Mary Barra told investors on Wednesday."
tesla,2017-11,"Her plans represent a direct challenge to money-losing electric vehicle specialist Tesla Inc , which is struggling to get its more affordable, high-volume Model 3 launched and recently reported its largest-ever quarterly loss. [nL2N1N72DJ]"
tesla,2017-11,"""We are committed to a future electric vehicle portfolio that will be profitable,"" Barra said at the Barclays Global Automotive Conference in New York."
tesla,2017-11,"Electric and autonomous vehicles - known in the industry as EVs and AVs - are widely seen as the keystones of future transport, but Tesla, Ford Motor Co and other manufacturers are still working out how to make money on them."
tesla,2017-11,"GM is looking to break out of that pattern by developing an all-new electric vehicle platform that will accommodate multiple sizes and segments, to be sold by different GM brands in the United States and China, Barra said, adding new details to GM's aggressive electrification strategy."
tesla,2017-11,"In early October, GM said it planned to launch 20 new electric vehicles by 2023, but did not provide specifics. [nL2N1MD1YS]"
tesla,2017-11,"In comparison, rival Ford has said it plans to introduce 13 ""electrified"" vehicles - mostly hybrid gasoline-electric models - by 2022. [nL4N1ME3GX]"
tesla,2017-11,GM's shares were down 0.4 percent at $42.84 in midday trade. Tesla and Ford shares were also down slightly in a broadly lower market.
tesla,2017-11,"Barra said GM aims to be selling 1 million electric vehicles a year by 2026, many of them in China, which has set strict production quotas on such vehicles. On Monday, GM's China chief said the automaker and its joint-venture partners will be able to meet the country's 2019 electric vehicle requirements without purchasing credits from other companies. [nL3N1NJ344]"
tesla,2017-11,GM's cost reduction efforts on electric vehicles center on a new battery system that will be more than 30 percent cheaper than the one that powers the Chevrolet Bolt.
tesla,2017-11,"The company aims to cut the cost of its lithium-ion batteries to less than $100 per kilowatt-hour from $145 per kilowatt-hour by 2021, which would bring the overall cost of electric vehicles much closer to comparable gasoline-engine models."
tesla,2017-11,GM said the new batteries would hold more energy and charge quicker. The company is aiming to boost electric vehicle range to more than 300 miles (483 km) with the new batteries. The current Bolt is rated at 238 miles between charges.
tesla,2017-11,"Barra said GM will have the ability to manufacture high volumes of the new batteries at plants in the United States and China. She said GM projects sales of 1 million electric vehicles a year by 2026. So far, the company has sold about 17,000 Bolts."
tesla,2017-11,"GM's new electric vehicle platform in 2021 will serve as a base for at least nine derivatives, ranging from a compact crossover to a large seven-passenger luxury sports utility vehicle and a large commercial van. It will also provide the underpinning for a shared autonomous vehicle (AV) that GM plans to put into commercial service."
tesla,2017-11,"Before the new platform arrives, GM plans to introduce three new electric vehicles by 2020, including two crossovers, that will share basic components with the Bolt, Barra said. She described GM as ""the only fully integrated developer of AVs with true scale capability."""
tesla,2017-11,"""We are not capital constrained in our EV or AV development,"" she added."
tesla,2017-11,"GM is generating strong profit from selling trucks and sport utility vehicles in the United States, and Barra reaffirmed a promise to investors that GM's core North American vehicle business should achieve 10 percent pre-tax profit margins."

tesla,2017-11,BREAKINGVIEWS-Tencent's overseas strategy is name of the game  - Reuters Breakingviews
tesla,2017-11,{{20171115T115402.566+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-Tencent's overseas strategy is name of the game (The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are her own.)
tesla,2017-11,"HONG KONG, Nov 15 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Tencent <0700.HK> has mastered the skill of entertaining millions of Chinese smartphone-wielding consumers. Now it needs to export that talent beyond its home market. Mobile games helped power quarterly sales to 65.2 billion yuan ($9.8 billion), up 61 percent from a year earlier, but growth in China's gaming sector is likely to slow quickly and Tencent's investments abroad have so far been a mess."
tesla,2017-11,"Pony Ma's firm raked in 26.8 billion yuan in sales from online games in the three months to end-September. ""Honour of Kings"", the fantasy role-playing game which boasts an estimated 80 million daily active users, is so wildly popular one state-backed newspaper has labelled it too addictive."
tesla,2017-11,"Veiled compliments aside, annual sales growth in China's online gaming market is set to slow from 21 percent this year to just 5 percent next year, according to iResearch. And while Tencent is diversifying into things like advertising, payments, and video-streaming, games will still account for almost 40 percent of total revenue in 2018, Morgan Stanley analysts reckon."
tesla,2017-11,"That helps explain the $472 billion behemoth's rush overseas. The Shenzhen-based company last year led a consortium to buy Supercell, the Finnish maker of mobile hit ""Clash of Clans"", for $8.6 billion. Beyond gaming, Tencent has also snapped up minority stakes in U.S. electric car-maker Tesla , New York-listed messaging-app Snap and Indian ride-sharing group Ola."
tesla,2017-11,"Yet these scatter-shot investments are yet to support its core business. Earlier this year, Tencent announced it would release an international version of ""Honour of Kings"", swapping out Chinese characters for more familiar Western ones like the Batman. But the much-anticipated North American launch has been delayed until sometime next year."
tesla,2017-11,It'll take sharper plans to justify trading at 40 times earnings. Shares of Tencent have more than doubled over the past year and trade at over 30 percent above their average two-year forward earnings multiple. Tencent's overseas strategy is the real name of the game.
tesla,2017-11,"- Chinese gaming and social-media company Tencent on Nov. 15 reported revenue of 65.2 billion yuan ($9.8 billion) for the three months to end-September, an increase of 61 percent compared to the same period a year earlier. Earnings rose 69 percent to 18 billion yuan."
tesla,2017-11,"- Revenue from online games topped 26.8 billion yuan, up 48 percent from a year earlier."
tesla,2017-11,"- In the third quarter this year, Tencent's ""Honour of Kings"" was the No.1 mobile game in the world by revenue on Apple's App Store, according to data from SensorTower. The company had planned to release an international version of the game, called ""Arena of Valor"", in the United States and Canada in November, but has delayed the launch to next year."
tesla,2017-11,"- Separately, disappearing-messaging-app company Snap on Nov. 8 disclosed that Tencent and its affiliates had bought a 12 percent stake in the U.S.-based group on the open market through its non-voting class A shares."

tesla,2017-11,"WASHINGTON, Nov 8 (Reuters) - A Democratic U.S. Senator from Michigan on Wednesday urged his fellow lawmakers to retain a $7,500 tax credit for people who buy electronic vehicles instead of eliminating it as Republicans have proposed."
tesla,2017-11,"In a letter seen by Reuters, Senator Gary Peters wrote to Senate leaders that ""a new generation of jobs and families will be supported by electric vehicles. Eliminating important economic incentives for electric vehicles would be a step in the wrong direction."""
tesla,2017-11,"Last week, Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives proposed to eliminate the tax credit, which could hurt automakers such as General Motors Co , Tesla Inc and Nissan Motor Co <7201.T>. [nL2N1N81A8]"

Electric vehicles have expensive batteries that make them pricier than gasoline-powered vehicles. GM and Tesla may hit the limit for vehicles that can get the tax credit by 2019."
tesla,2017-11,"Environmental groups and an auto industry trade group oppose the House proposal, which would kick in at the end of this year.

tesla,2017-11,"Nov 8 (Reuters) - Snap Inc said on Wednesday that Chinese tech and media investment firm Tencent Holdings Ltd <0700.HK> had taken a 12 percent stake in the company, a day after the owner of disappearing-messaging app Snapchat was punished by Wall Street for disappointing quarterly results."
tesla,2017-11,"Snap's shares fell 16 percent to $12.67, well below their $17 initial public offering price in March, as investors fretted about Snap's slowing user growth in the latest quarter and viewed Tencent's move as an investment rather than the precursor to a merger. [nL3N1ND65C]"
tesla,2017-11,"""(Tencent) buys all sorts of minority investments, and I don't think we can extrapolate that this means they intend to take over the company,"" said Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter."

tesla,2017-11,"Tencent president Martin Lau told Snap his firm is ""excited"" to deepen its relationship with the firm, Snap said in a regulatory filing. A Snap spokesman declined to comment further."

tesla,2017-11,"Snap's ownership structure, which reserves 95 percent of voting rights for its co-founders, made it likely Tencent was just accumulating a financial stake, analysts said."
tesla,2017-11,"While the stake could lead to a business partnership with Tencent and help Snap expand its reach into China, Morningstar analyst Ali Mogharabi said Snap's problems remained, chiefly slowing user growth and competition from Facebook Inc's Instagram."
tesla,2017-11,"Snap co-founder and Chief Executive Evan Spiegel, who has in the past referred to Tencent as a role model, said on Tuesday that he was looking to redesign Snapchat to reach a broader audience."

tesla,2017-11,"FRANKFURT, Nov 3 (Reuters) - A group of mainly German carmakers will open ultra-fast electric vehicle charging stations this year and plans a pan-European network of 400 by 2020, hoping to narrow Tesla's lead."
tesla,2017-11,"News about the initiative, first flagged a year ago, had been long anticipated as governments push for improvements in infrastructure that would encourage drivers to switch to electric cars. [nL1N1DU18Q]"
tesla,2017-11,"IONITY, a joint venture of BMW AG , Daimler AG , Ford Motor Co and Volkswagen with its Audi and Porsche brands, plans to open 20 stations to the public this year in Germany, Norway and Austria. They will be 120 km (75 miles) apart and run in partnership with Tank & Rast [LINDOTA.UL], Circle K and OMV ."
tesla,2017-11,"""The first pan-European HPC network plays an essential role in establishing a market for electric vehicles,"" IONITY's CEO Michael Hajesch said on Friday. He added that the fast-charging stations would also offer digital-payment capability."
tesla,2017-11,"IONITY is still in talks with charging station suppliers and a decision is expected soon, a spokeswoman said, declining to say how much the joint venture would invest."
tesla,2017-11,"Installing thousands of High-Power Charging (HPC) stations across the globe will require billions of dollars in investment and offer an opportunity to manufacturers.

tesla,2017-11,"Each charging point will have a capacity of 350 kW, and will use an existing European standard, the Combined Charging System, to reduce charging times compared to existing systems."
tesla,2017-11,A half-hour charge will give a Tesla driver about 270 km in extra driving range - roughly half the time it would take to get a similar boost at a 50 kW charge point that is now the industry standard. ($1 = 0.8587 euros)

tesla,2017-11,"{{20171102T192559.589+0000}}UPDATE 4-U.S. House Republicans propose to scrap $7,500 electric vehicle credit(Adds Nissan reaction)"
tesla,2017-11,"WASHINGTON, Nov 2 (Reuters) - House Republicans are proposing to eliminate the $7,500 tax credit for electric vehicles, which could hurt automakers like General Motors Co , Tesla Inc and Nissan Motor Co <7201.T>, according to the bill made public on Thursday."
tesla,2017-11,"Current law allows automakers to use the credit, which phases out after an automaker hits 200,000 plug-in vehicles sold. Electric vehicles have expensive batteries that make them pricier than gasoline-powered vehicles."
tesla,2017-11,"Environmental groups and an auto industry trade group blasted the proposal, which would kick in at the end of this year. GM vowed to fight, saying the credits are ""an important customer benefit that can help accelerate the acceptance of electric vehicles."" Tesla declined to comment."
tesla,2017-11,"Nissan said it supports continuing the tax credit and noted it has ""made significant investments in the development of market-leading electric vehicles."""
tesla,2017-11,Critics of the credit say electric vehicle buyers tend to be wealthier than average and do not need subsidies.
tesla,2017-11,"Gloria Bergquist, a spokeswoman for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a trade group representing GM, Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T>, Volkswagen AG and others, said the change could hurt electric vehicle sales."
tesla,2017-11,"""The potential elimination of the federal electric vehicle tax credit will impact the choices of prospective buyers and make the electric vehicle mandate in 10 states - about a third of the market - even more difficult to meet,"" Bergquist said."
tesla,2017-11,"""The EV tax credit repeal would cede U.S. leadership in clean vehicles, putting our companies at a competitive disadvantage and threatening jobs while costing drivers more at the pump and increasing pollution,"" said Luke Tonachel, director of the National Resources Defense Council's Clean Vehicles and Fuels Project."
tesla,2017-11,Automakers have invested billions in electric vehicles and announced plans to shift significant production to plug-in models.
tesla,2017-11,"Former President Barack Obama unsuccessfully proposed hiking the tax credit for electric vehicles to $10,000 and converting it to a point-of-sale rebate."
tesla,2017-11,"GM shares fell 1.2 percent in late trading, while Tesla was down 7 percent after reporting earnings."
tesla,2017-11,"The House GOP plan also calls for repealing and phasing out other energy tax credits, including production and investment tax credit for solar, geothermal, fuel cell, wind energy and other clean energy projects."
tesla,2017-11,Automakers face mandates from California and a dozen other states to produce a rising number of zero-emission vehicles and have said the credits are essential to meeting requirements.
tesla,2017-11,"GM's electric Chevrolet Bolt starts around $30,000 including the tax credit but rises to $37,500 without it."

tesla,2017-11,"{{20171102T184035.755+0000}}Study predicts slow, steady rise of electric vehicles to 2030By Paul Lienert"
tesla,2017-11,"DETROIT, Nov 2 (Reuters) - Pure electric vehicles will not begin to gain serious traction in most global markets until after 2025 and will likely account for only 14 percent of total global vehicle production by 2030, according to a study released on Thursday by Boston Consulting Group."
tesla,2017-11,"By then, the study's authors said, improved battery technology, lower costs and government mandates will drive greater consumer demand for EVs, which this year will account for less than 1 percent of the nearly 100 million vehicles sold worldwide and only 6 percent by 2025."
tesla,2017-11,"""Eventually, we'll reach a point where we don't need incentives anymore"" to boost EV sales, said Xavier Mosquet, BCG senior partner and lead author of the study. By 2030, Mosquet said, EV demand will be driven by market forces, not regulation."
tesla,2017-11,"Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives have already proposed eliminating one of the biggest EV incentives, a $7,500 tax credit, which could hurt automakers like General Motors Co , Tesla Inc and Nissan Motor Co <7201.T> that are selling large numbers of those vehicles. [nL2N1N81A8]"
tesla,2017-11,"BCG expects battery costs to fall rapidly after 2020, to as low as $80 per kilowatt-hour by 2025, compared with about $150 today and more than $650 in 2010."
tesla,2017-11,"Total operating costs also will drop, BCG said, until the cost of owning and operating an electric vehicle over 10 years will fall below that of a comparable combustion-engine vehicles by 2021."
tesla,2017-11,"In addition, more stringent environmental targets in many countries will push vehicle manufacturers to add some form of electrification, including hybrid electric-gasoline powertrains, to reduce exhaust emissions after 2020."
tesla,2017-11,"Even as costs drop and more advanced technology is introduced over the next 12 years, BCG said it expects 86 percent of new vehicles to continue using some form of combustion engine by 2030."
tesla,2017-11,"Mosquet said a gradual shift to ride sharing in big cities and larger metropolitan areas, especially in the United States, will drive demand for EVs, in large part because the shared vehicles will accumulate miles more rapidly and thus narrow the gap in operating costs with combustion-engine vehicles."
tesla,2017-11,"Likewise, a shift to self-driving vehicles, particularly in ride-sharing fleets, will boost EV demand after 2025. The cost per mile for a battery-powered self-driving vehicle could drop as low as 74 cents by 2030, making such vehicles less expensive than those with combustion engines, BCG said."

tesla,2017-11,"Nov 2 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc shares fell more than 6 percent on Thursday on concern that the carmaker's performance was consistently falling short of chief executive Elon Musk's promises, while several analysts argued it could need more financing soon."
tesla,2017-11,Four major houses - including Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan - cut their price targets by $5-$10 after the electric carmaker reported its worst ever quarterly loss and pushed back production targets for its Model 3 vehicle by three months.
tesla,2017-11,"While shares in Silicon Valley star Musk's venture were still up 50 percent for the year, reflecting faith in its positioning as a major future manufacturer, the company's share price has now retreated 23 percent since mid-September."

tesla,2017-11,"After a year which has seen shares in Silicon Valley star Elon Musk's venture rise 50 percent on faith in its positioning as a major future carmaker and manufacturer, analysts expressed doubt over Musk's communication with markets and one - Nomura's Romit Shah - said the company could need more financing."

tesla,2017-11,"It now expects to build 5,000 Model 3s per week by the end of the first quarter of 2018 from its original target date of December."

tesla,2017-11,"SAN FRANCISCO, Nov 1 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc on Wednesday pushed back its target for volume production on its new Model 3 sedan by about three months, saying it was difficult to predict how long it would take to fix all production bottlenecks."
tesla,2017-11,"The company also reported its biggest quarterly loss ever, sending shares down nearly 5 percent after hours as the loss was bigger than analysts had expected."
tesla,2017-11,"Tesla, led by Silicon Valley entrepreneur Elon Musk, faces a crucial test in its growth strategy as it ramps up production of the Model 3, its new sedan that starts at $35,000, about half the price of its flagship Model S. [nL3N1KK05W]"
tesla,2017-11,"Although Tesla has made inroads among luxury car buyers with the advanced technology and innovative design in its Model S sedan and Model X SUV, it is the Model 3 on which its long-term viability rests. The company continues to burn through cash, and spent $1.1 billion in capital expenditures in the third quarter."
tesla,2017-11,"The company said it now expects to build 5,000 Model 3s per week by late in the first quarter of 2018 from its original target date of December."
tesla,2017-11,"Tesla said the main constraint was its battery module assembly line at its Nevada Gigafactory, where the company had to redesign part of the production process."
tesla,2017-11,"""I was really depressed about three or four weeks ago,"" Musk said, adding that he is now optimistic because it is clear what needs to be done. ""We are on it, we've got it covered,"" but it will take a few months longer than expected, he said."

tesla,2017-11,"Model 3 production delays mean postponed sales could exacerbate the company's cash burn. The problems could also worry the over 500,000 customers who have put down a refundable deposit on the car."
tesla,2017-11,"Adding to the pressure is the fact that U.S. tax credits for Tesla buyers, intended to help manufacturers ramp up electric vehicles, begin to expire after the company sells its 200,000th vehicle in the United States. The company has not said when that will be, but it has sold 250,000 globally."

tesla,2017-11,"But Musk said he did not expect any significant capital expenditures for China until 2019, adding that he envisions a factory producing at least a couple hundred thousand vehicles per year for the Chinese market."
tesla,2017-11,"Tesla said it was ""well capitalized"" for the delayed Model 3 production schedule and predicted capital expenditures of about $1 billion in the fourth quarter. That, together with spending in the third quarter, matched Tesla's August estimate of $2 billion in capital expenditures for the second half of the year."
tesla,2017-11,"Tesla reported that cash and cash equivalents rose to $3.53 billion on Sept. 30 from $3.04 billion at the end of the second quarter, but Tesla in August raised $1.8 billion by selling debt. It also spent $325 million to repay a credit facility in the quarter. [nL1N1KT12M]"

tesla,2017-11,{{20171101T212619.933+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-Parts makers offer safer Auto 2.0 bets than Tesla(The authors are Reuters Breakingviews columnists. The opinions expressed are their own.)
tesla,2017-11,"NEW YORK/HONG KONG, Nov 1 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Buy the battery, not the car, the market seems to be suggesting. Investors have long regarded Elon Musk's Tesla as the best vehicle for betting on the electric and autonomous car revolution. But that has driven shares to an outlandish valuation even though the firm routinely loses money, misses production targets and faces increased competition. Components makers may pave a less volatile road to Auto 2.0 riches."
tesla,2017-11,"The company's latest quarterly figures, released after markets closed on Wednesday, underscore the gap between its promise and reality. Its third-quarter loss of $619 million was its worst ever. Tesla also pushed back its target date for boosting production of its mass-market Model 3 to 5,000 a week by about three months, to late in the first quarter of 2018."
tesla,2017-11,"Even ahead of that announcement, the trade to other EV plays appeared to be under way. Shares in Panasonic <6752.T>, which teamed up with Tesla to build its battery-producing Gigafactory in Nevada, have surged by almost 73 percent in the past 12 months, according to Thomson Reuters data. Another battery supplier, South Korea's LG Chem <051910.KS>, has risen 69.5 percent. Throwing in dividends adds 3 percentage points to each company's return. Tesla, meanwhile, has risen almost 69 percent."
tesla,2017-11,"Logic suggests that performance gap should widen. Tesla's shares trade at a whopping 56 times estimated 2019 earnings, the first year it is expected to turn a profit. That doesn't just price in Musk's aim of building 500,000 cars a year by the end of 2018, a goal that risks receding. It assumes Tesla keeps growing and cranks out margins common for tech companies but way out of reach for conventional automakers."
tesla,2017-11,"Panasonic and LG Chem, by contrast, trade at a far more reasonable 16 and 14 times estimated earnings for calendar year 2019, respectively. And they have a more diverse revenue stream. Both supply batteries to a number of other carmakers. General Motors' all-electric Bolt, which last month outsold Tesla's S and X for the first time, may be LG Chem's best-known customer. It also sells to Ford and the Renault-Nissan <7201.T> alliance. Both supply cheaper batteries for hybrid gasoline-electric cars, too."
tesla,2017-11,"Neither company is a pure play on the car industry. The sector accounted for just under a fifth of LG's third-quarter revenue and slightly less of Panasonic's top line in its fiscal second quarter. That may add an extra buffer to investors wary of taking too much risk. For the Tesla faithful, though, such logic holds no charge."
tesla,2017-11,"- Tesla reported a third-quarter loss attributable to common shareholders of $619 million, or $3.70 a share, after the stock market closed on Nov. 1. The adjusted loss was $488 million, or $2.92 a share. The consensus estimate of sell-side analysts was for a loss of $2.48 a share. Revenue of $2.99 billion beat the consensus estimate of $2.97 billion."

tesla,2017-11,{{20171101T193642.833+0000}}Luxury auto brands are scrambling to avoid a Blue U.S. ChristmasBy Nick Carey
tesla,2017-11,"DETROIT, Nov 1 (Reuters) - When financial markets surge to new records, sales of luxury cars usually rise, too. Instead, October U.S. auto sales reports on Wednesday showed that a collapse in sales of luxury sedans is accelerating."
tesla,2017-11,"Consumers have gradually shifted over to luxury sport utility vehicles from sedans in the last decade, but the trend - which has occurred in both the non-luxury and luxury segments of the auto market - was particularly pronounced in October."
tesla,2017-11,"Sales of Daimler AG's Mercedes-Benz S-Class, long a global benchmark for large, premium sedans, plunged 49 percent in October, and are down 24.8 percent for the year to date. General Motors Co's Cadillac brand said it sold just 779 of its CTS sedans in October. Demand for that car, designed to compete with German luxury sedans, is down nearly 33 percent for the year."
tesla,2017-11,"Cadillac's best-selling model this year is the XT5 compact SUV, which has more than doubled sales from a year ago."
tesla,2017-11,The shift within the luxury vehicle market away from sedans toward SUVs of all sizes is forcing some of the most prestigious brands to scramble to add SUV models to their lineups or boost SUV production to meet demand.
tesla,2017-11,"""In the short term, there will be pressure to add (consumer) incentives, cut production or both,"" said Cox Automotive analyst Michelle Krebs. ""And we just don't see an end in sight to this trend."""
tesla,2017-11,"According to Kelley Blue Book data, in 2007 luxury sedans made up 7.6 percent of U.S. new vehicle sales, while luxury SUVs made up 4.2 percent. Through September this year, luxury SUVs made up just over 7 percent of the market, compared with 4.9 percent for luxury sedans."
tesla,2017-11,"In the short term, luxury brands could use holiday season sales promotions to clear slow-selling sedans off dealer lots, analysts said. Toyota Motor Corp's <7203.T> Lexus brand said on Wednesday it will launch its ""December to Remember"" year-end sales promotion for the 18th straight year."
tesla,2017-11,"Longer-term, luxury car makers have to restructure their model lineups, which have for decades reflected conventional thinking that the ""flagship"" of a luxury vehicle brand is a big sedan."
tesla,2017-11,Industry executives and analysts said luxury brands will launch more SUVs. BMW AG and Mercedes-Benz are both expanding their U.S. sport utility vehicle plants.
tesla,2017-11,"Some luxury sedans will disappear from lineups, but not all. Lexus, for instance, is launching a redesigned version of its flagship LS sedan in the United States in 2018, starting at around $75,000."
tesla,2017-11,"Established luxury car brands must reckon with the impact of Tesla Inc's electric vehicles, which have redefined the boundaries for advanced technology."
tesla,2017-11,"Offering a little more horsepower is not enough to draw in many customers, said Scott Keogh, head of Audi's U.S. operations. ""There really isn't a new stimulus"" for owners of current models to trade in their vehicles, he said."
tesla,2017-11,"""Audi buyers ... want the latest and greatest,"" he said. That is one reason why the brand, owned by Volkswagen AG , plans to launch an electric sport utility in the United States by 2019."
tesla,2017-11,"Sam Fiorani, vice president of AutoForecast Solutions, said automakers are keen to encourage eager consumers to buy luxury SUVs and crossovers as those models face less stringent fuel regulations and are far more profitable than sedans."
tesla,2017-11,"""There's still a significant portion of the market that wants a car,"" Fiorani said, ""but I'm sure there were people who preferred a horse to a car at one point."""
tesla,2017-11,"Randy Parker, U.S. head of Nissan Motor Co Ltd's <7201.T> luxury Infiniti brand, said much depends on the U.S. economy and gasoline prices, but luxury brands ""with a really robust SUV and crossover portfolio will ... win in the next few years."""

tesla,2017-11,UPDATE 3-U.S. trade panel recommends varying solar panel import restrictions - Reuters News
tesla,2017-11,{{20171031T211808.035+0000}}UPDATE 3-U.S. trade panel recommends varying solar panel import restrictions(Adds analyst comments on market impact)
tesla,2017-11,"WASHINGTON, Oct 31 (Reuters) - Members of the U.S. International Trade Commission on Tuesday made three different recommendations for restricting solar cell and panel imports on Tuesday, giving President Donald Trump a range of choices to address injury to domestic producers."
tesla,2017-11,The recommendations range from an immediate 35 percent tariff on all imported panels to a four-year quota system that allows the import of up to 8.9 gigawatts of solar cells and modules in the first year. The president's ultimate decision could have a major impact on the price of U.S. power generated by the sun.
tesla,2017-11,"Both supporters and critics of import curbs on solar products were disappointed by the proposals, which were unveiled at a public meeting in Washington."
tesla,2017-11,"Trade remedies were requested in a petition earlier this year by two small U.S. manufacturers that said they were unable to compete with cheap panels made overseas, mainly in Asia. The companies, Suniva Inc and the U.S. arm of Germany's SolarWorld AG , said Tuesday's recommendations did not go far enough to protect domestic producers."
tesla,2017-11,"""The ITC's remedy simply will not fix the problem the ITC itself identified,"" Suniva said in a statement. The company, which is majority owned by Hong Kong-based Shunfeng International Clean Energy <1165.HK>, filed the rare Section 201 petition nine days after seeking Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in April. [nL1N1HY24T] It had sought a minimum price on panels of 74 cents a watt, nearly double their current cost."
tesla,2017-11,"One analyst said the stiffest remedy recommended, a 35 percent tariff on solar panels, would add about 10 percent to the cost of a utility-scale project but would have a negligible impact on the price of residential systems because panels themselves make up a small portion of their overall cost."
tesla,2017-11,"""It's not nearly the doomsday impact we were potentially expecting,"" said Camron Barati, a solar analyst with market research firm IHS Markit Technology."
tesla,2017-11,"But the top U.S. solar trade group, the Solar Energy Industries Association, said in a statement on Tuesday that any tariffs would be ""intensely harmful"" to the industry. The group has lobbied heavily against import restrictions on the grounds that they would undermine a 70 percent drop in the cost of solar since 2010 that has made the technology competitive with fossil fuels."
tesla,2017-11,"The ITC will deliver its report to Trump by Nov. 13. He will have broad leeway to come up with his own alternative or do nothing at all. Since only two members agreed on the same restrictions, there was no majority recommendation from the four-member commission."
tesla,2017-11,"""There is still plenty to be worried about,"" said MJ Shiao, who follows the U.S. solar market for GTM Research."
tesla,2017-11,"Trump has vowed to protect U.S. manufacturers from low-priced imports, and U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross has talked about tariff-rate quotas as a flexible way to protect some industries, allowing imports in as needed, but only up to a certain level before high tariffs kick in."
tesla,2017-11,"Commissioners David Johanson and Irving Williamson urged the president to impose an immediate 30 percent tariff on completed solar modules, to be lowered in subsequent years, and a tariff-rate quota on solar cells. Imports of cells in excess of one gigawatt would be subject to a 30 percent tariff that would decline after the first year."
tesla,2017-11,"ITC Chair Rhonda Schmidtlein recommended an immediate 35 percent four-year tariff on imported solar modules, with a four-year tariff rate quota on solar cells. This would impose a 30 percent tariff on imports exceeding 0.5 gigawatts and 10 percent on imports below that level. These tariffs would decline over a four-year period."
tesla,2017-11,"In the most lenient recommendation, Commissioner Meredith Broadbent said the president should impose a four-year quota system that allows for imports of up to 8.9 gigawatts of solar cells and modules in the first year."

tesla,2017-11,Foreign investment in the sector helped propel economic growth in 2017 to its highest level in more than a decade and the government hopes new regulation can draw more companies.
tesla,2017-11,"""We are working a lot on the regulatory and legal aspects because this is really totally fundamental for opportunities in this area,"" Industry Secretary Ana Lehmann told Reuters in an interview."
tesla,2017-11,"""One of the areas we are working on has to do with technological free zones and drones is one of the areas we want to promote...another is autonomous vehicles."""
tesla,2017-11,Many countries are looking at how to allow companies to test new technologies.

tesla,2017-11,Lehmann said the Portuguese government was working carefully on the laws needed for such zones. The country restricted the use of drones this year to raise public security.
tesla,2017-11,"""We are studying some locations and what is needed...within a legal framework that is very careful because these technologies have an impact,"" she said. ""This is a delicate topic and we want to do it properly."""
tesla,2017-11,Portuguese law currently does not allow the testing of self-driving cars on public roads.
tesla,2017-11,"Veniam is one of Portugal's leading technology companies. It has developed wireless networks for public transport and hopes to use that know-how for autonomous vehicles. Veniam first developed its system in the city of Porto, which Lehmann said was a ""very interesting test case""."
tesla,2017-11,"Mercedes-Benz this year opened a digital centre in Lisbon, which includes development of autonomous vehicle technology while Volkswagen has a big assembly plant in Portugal."
tesla,2017-11,Portugal is also angling for a potential European factory under consideration at Tesla Motors. The country has one of Europe's biggest reserves of lithium.
tesla,2017-11,"""Lots of people are fighting, we are fighting (for a Tesla factory),"" Lehmann said when asked about the possibility."
