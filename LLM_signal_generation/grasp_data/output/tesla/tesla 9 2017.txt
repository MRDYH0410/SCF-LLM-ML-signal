tesla,2017-9,"{{20170929T161437.443+0000}}UPDATE 1-Tesla chief Musk's latest idea: Intercity rocket travel* SpaceX shrinks Mars rocket design, to begin construction in 2018"
tesla,2017-9,"ADELAIDE/SYDNEY, Sept 29 (Reuters) - Silicon Valley billionaire Elon Musk on Friday outlined ambitious plans for a manned mission to Mars and a rocket capable of carrying passengers from one continent to another on Earth."
tesla,2017-9,"SpaceX plans its first trip to the red planet in 2022, carrying only cargo, to be followed by a manned mission in 2024, Musk, who runs the company and electric luxury car company Tesla Inc , said at a conference in Adelaide."
tesla,2017-9,NASA's first human mission to Mars is expected about a decade later.
tesla,2017-9,"Musk, the chief executive and lead designer of Space Exploration Technologies, said SpaceX has shrunk the size of the rocket ship it is developing to go to Mars, aiming to start construction on the first spaceship in the first half of next year."
tesla,2017-9,"As for the intercontinental passenger rocket - a concept familiar to science fiction fans - Musk said, ""If you build a ship that's capable of going to Mars, what if you take that same ship and go from one place to another on Earth? We looked at that and the results are quite interesting."""
tesla,2017-9,"He then showed the conference audience a video of images of a rocket taking off in New York City and landing in various places around the world, with words on the screen showing flight times of less than an hour between any two cities on opposite sides of the world. A New York-to-Shanghai trip could be done in 39 minutes, for example."
tesla,2017-9,"Musk had previously planned to use a suite of space vehicles to support the colonization of Mars, beginning with an unmanned capsule called Red Dragon in 2018, but he said SpaceX is now focused on a single, slimmer and shorter rocket instead. [nL2N1C320T]"
tesla,2017-9,"The rocket would be partially reusable and capable of flight directly from Earth to Mars, could still carry 100 passengers, and could also be used for fast transport on Earth, Musk said."
tesla,2017-9,Musk's SpaceX is one of several ventures that have said they want to open up space routes to Mars.
tesla,2017-9,"Lockheed Martin Corp announced separate plans for a manned Mars journey on Friday, unveiling concept drawings of a ""base camp"" space station orbiting Mars and landing craft that would carry four astronauts to the planet's surface."
tesla,2017-9,"""We know its cold, it's pretty inhospitable, so we start with the robots and then we go down with these landers,"" Rob Chambers, Lockheed's director of human space flight strategy, told Australian Broadcasting Corporation in an interview."
tesla,2017-9,"Chambers gave no date, but the planned mission would be a joint expedition with NASA, which aims to reach Mars during the 2030s."
tesla,2017-9,"Mars is typically 140 million miles (225 million km) from Earth, and landing the first humans there, after what traditionally has been seen as a six- to nine-month journey, is an extremely ambitious goal."
tesla,2017-9,"SpaceX, which Musk founded with the aim of colonizing Mars, is one of several private and government-funded ventures vying to put people and cargo on the red planet, and other destinations beyond Earth's orbit."
tesla,2017-9,Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin space venture is also designing a heavy-lift vehicle called New Armstrong that will be capable of Mars transport.
tesla,2017-9,"Russia and China are each preparing for manned missions to the moon, and Russia has agreed to work with NASA planning a ""deep space gateway"" space station in lunar orbit, which would serve as a staging post for future missions."

tesla,2017-9,"Policymakers in key markets like China are pushing a shift to electric cars over the next two to three decades, while relatively new rival Tesla Inc is gaining momentum, pressuring traditional automakers to crank up plans for fully electric vehicles (EVs)."
tesla,2017-9,"At the same time, declining battery costs are enabling more power to be packed into cars, making an electric car future easier to imagine."

tesla,2017-9,"Trouble is, that remains years off. And there are other challenges. Access to some metals is far from secure: around half of the current supply and estimated reserves of cobalt are in the Democratic Republic of Congo, a country plagued by conflict, drought and child labor. That explains why Volkswagen is trying to secure a reliable supply of cobalt for the next 10 years or so, Reuters reported last week."
tesla,2017-9,"Add up the various prognostications and electric-only-powered cars, with most of them driving themselves, will almost certainly become the norm by mid-century. That's still plenty of time for the internal combustion engine to ride off into the sunset."
tesla,2017-9,"- Dyson, the engineering company best known for its vacuum cleaners, is working on launching an electric car by 2020, Reuters reported on Sept. 26."
tesla,2017-9,- Founder James Dyson said he intends to spend 2 billion pounds ($2.7 billion) on solid-state battery technology and vehicle design. Some 400 engineers have already been working on the project for the past two-and-a-half years.
tesla,2017-9,"- Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas wrote in a research note on Sept. 26 that he expects that the number of Teslas on the roads will triple by the end of 2019 from the 300,000 cars he expects to be in circulation by the end of this year."
tesla,2017-9,"- BHP Billiton's Chief Commercial Officer Arnoud Balhuizen on Sept. 26 called 2017 a ""tipping point"" for electric vehicles at a Reuters event in Singapore. BHP reckons the number of electric vehicles on the roads could hit 140 million by 2035. There are currently between 1 million and 2 million in operation out of a total global fleet of 1.1 billion vehicles."
tesla,2017-9,"- On Sept. 22 Reuters exclusively reported that Volkswagen is trying to secure supplies of cobalt for up to 10 years from 2019. Cobalt is a key component of electric batteries, with the Democratic Republic of Congo accounting for more than half of supplies and reserves."

tesla,2017-9,"LONDON, Sept 26 (Reuters) - James Dyson, the billionaire British inventor of the bagless vacuum cleaner, said on Tuesday his company was working on developing an electric car to be launched by 2020."
tesla,2017-9,Dyson said he was spending 2 billion pounds ($2.7 billion) to exploit his namesake company's expertise in solid-state battery technology and electric motors to be found in his innovative vacuum cleaners and other products like bladeless fans and air purifiers.
tesla,2017-9,"""Battery technology is very important to Dyson, electric motors are very important to Dyson, environmental control is very important to us,"" Dyson, aged 71, said at his company's flagship shop on London's Oxford Street."
tesla,2017-9,"""I have been developing these technologies consistently because I could see that one day we could do a car."""
tesla,2017-9,"Dyson said a 400-strong team of engineers had already spent 2-1/2 years working on the hitherto secret car project in Malmesbury, Wiltshire. However, the car itself still has to be designed and the choice of battery to be finalised."
tesla,2017-9,"The company was backing solid-state rather than the lithium ion technology used in existing electric vehicles because it was safer, the batteries would not overheat, were quicker to charge and potentially more powerful, he said."
tesla,2017-9,Dyson said his ambition to go it alone was driven by the car industry's dismissal of an idea he had of applying his cyclonic technology that revolutionised vacuum cleaners to handle diesel emissions in car exhaust systems in the 1990s.
tesla,2017-9,"""We are not a johnny-come-lately onto the scene of electric cars,"" he said. ""It has been my ambition since 1998 when I was rejected by the industry, which has happily gone on making polluting diesel engines, and governments have gone on allowing it."""
tesla,2017-9,There had already been clues that Dyson was working on a car.
tesla,2017-9,"His company has been hiring executives from Aston Martin and last year the government said in a report it was helping to fund development work on an electric vehicle at the firm, although the entry was quickly changed."
tesla,2017-9,"Dyson said he was coming clean now because it was becoming harder to talk to subcontractors, government and potential new employees."
tesla,2017-9,"But the car does not yet have a design nor a chassis, he said, and the company had not yet decided where it will be made, beyond ruling out working with the big car companies."
tesla,2017-9,"""Wherever we make the battery, we'll make the car, that's logical,"" he said. ""So we want to be near our suppliers, we want to be in a place that welcomes us and is friendly to us, and where it is logistically most sensible."
tesla,2017-9,"""And we see a very large market for this car in the Far East."""
tesla,2017-9,"Dyson gave no details of the concept for the vehicle, beyond saying it would not be like anything else already on the market."
tesla,2017-9,"""There's no point in doing one that looks like everyone else's,"" he said, adding that it would not be a sports car and it would not be ""a very cheap"" car."
tesla,2017-9,"Dyson, who was a prominent backer of the campaign for Britain to leave the European Union, has been able to fund the project through the profits of his holding company."
tesla,2017-9,"The Weybourne Group reported a 55 percent rise in pretax profit to 473 million pounds in 2016 on revenue of 2.53 billion pounds, according to accounts filed earlier this month. On Tuesday Dyson told his workforce, which includes more than 1,000 engineers, that the company finally had the opportunity to bring all its technologies together into a single product."
tesla,2017-9,"""Competition for new technology in the automotive industry is fierce and we must do everything we can to keep the specifics of our vehicle confidential,"" he said in an email."

tesla,2017-9,"LONDON, Sept 22 (Reuters) - Germany's Volkswagen is moving to secure long-term supplies of cobalt, a vital component of rechargeable batteries, as the group accelerates its ambitious shift to electric cars."
tesla,2017-9,"Cobalt industry sources told Reuters that VW, the world's largest automaker, has asked producers to submit proposals on supplying the material for up to 10 years from 2019."
tesla,2017-9,"Volkswagen, which decided on the strategic shift to electric vehicles (EVs) after it was engulfed in the ""dieselgate"" scandal, plans to invest more than 20 billion euros ($24 billion) in zero-emission vehicles by 2030 to challenge pioneer Tesla in creating a mass market.

tesla,2017-9,"WASHINGTON, Sept 22 (Reuters) - SolarCity will pay $29.5 million to settle a long-running investigation into allegations it violated federal law by submitting inflated claims to the government through a popular stimulus program set up during the Obama administration, the U.S. Justice Department said Friday."
tesla,2017-9,"The department said there was no determination of liability as part of the settlement with SolarCity, now owned by Tesla Inc , and that the company would also drop related litigation against the government."
tesla,2017-9,The probe centered on whether SolarCity and other companies were making misrepresentations about the fair market value of solar systems that received grants.
tesla,2017-9,"In a statement, the company denied all of the allegations in the civil settlement with the Justice Department."
tesla,2017-9,"""Between 2009 and 2013, SolarCity installed approximately 29,000 solar energy systems that were eligible for cash grants,"" the company said."
tesla,2017-9,"""SolarCity took its responsibilities under the program very seriously, and far from trying to overstate the value of those projects, it went to great lengths to determine accurate values. Independent appraisers, accountants, and investors gave those projects a total value of approximately $1.8 billion."""
tesla,2017-9,"The U.S. Treasury Department's Inspector General has been probing the company since at least 2012 in connection with the stimulus program, which allowed rooftop solar panel projects to turn tax credits into cash grants as a way to help subsidize costs."
tesla,2017-9,The program paid a cash grant that was equal to 30 percent of the eligible cost basis to construct or acquire certain solar energy systems. The program has since expired.
tesla,2017-9,"According to the Justice Department, SolarCity is alleged to have made thousands of claims starting in 2009 that allegedly overstated the costs."
tesla,2017-9,"""The government will still hold accountable those who sought to take improper advantage of government programs at the expense of American taxpayers,"" said Chad Readler, the acting head of the department's civil division."
tesla,2017-9,"Throughout the years-long Treasury investigation into SolarCity, the company in turn counter-sued the government, claiming the government actually owed it money for solar systems it had installed that qualified for grants."
tesla,2017-9,"As part of the settlement, SolarCity has agreed to drop its counterclaims against the U.S. Treasury Department."
tesla,2017-9,"""It is telling that after an exhaustive five-year investigation, the government did not bring any lawsuit accusing SolarCity of any wrongdoing,"" the company said in its statement."

tesla,2017-9,{{20170921T133722.040+0000}}RPT-ANALYSIS-Road to electric car paradise paved with handouts(Repeats to adds 'TV' to slug for media clients)
tesla,2017-9,"JUDABERG, Norway, Sept 21 (Reuters) - The Norwegian island of Finnoey has the highest density of electric cars in the world. The reason? They are exempt from the $6,000-a-year toll charges for the tunnel to the mainland."
tesla,2017-9,"There has been a surge in sales of fully electric cars like Teslas and Nissan <7201.T> Leafs since the tunnel opened in 2009 and they now account for one in five cars on Finnoey, compared with less than 1 in 100 globally."
tesla,2017-9,"Twenty-nine percent of all new car registrations in Norway were fully electric or plug-in hybrids last year, according to the International Energy Agency, far ahead of the Netherlands in second on 6.4 percent and Sweden in third on 3.4. China had almost 1.5 percent and the United States less than one."
tesla,2017-9,"State subsidies support sales of electric cars around the world, and Norway has the most electric cars per capita thanks to the most generous handouts."
tesla,2017-9,"It offers nationwide tax breaks for users of electric cars than can be worth tens of thousands of dollars, plus various local incentives like exemptions from road tolls and parking fees."
tesla,2017-9,"""Economic incentives work, especially if they are very, very, very strong as in Finnoey,"" said former Norwegian central bank governor Svein Gjedrem, who grew up on the western island chain of 3,250 people which is famous for its fish farms and tomatoes."
tesla,2017-9,"A reliance on state handouts complicates efforts in nations like Britain and France to phase out combustion engines in favour of battery-powered vehicles, which are far costlier, have limited ranges and often have long charging times. [nL5N1KH21I]"
tesla,2017-9,It means the technology will have to become significantly cheaper if those governments are to meet pledges to ban sales of petrol and diesel cars from 2040 without having to hand out crippling levels of subsidies to millions of buyers.
tesla,2017-9,A tale of two contrasting Norwegian municipalities - Finnoey and neighbouring Hjelmeland on the mainland - starkly illustrates the power of financial incentives on consumer behaviour.
tesla,2017-9,"A Finnoey resident driving to work in nearby oil hub Stavanger with an electric car can save 40,000-50,000 crowns ($5,500-$6,500) a year in tunnel tolls compared with drivers of fossil-fuelled cars."
tesla,2017-9,"Hjelmeland, by contrast, bucks the Norwegian trend by offering no local perks at all for battery-powered cars."
tesla,2017-9,"Almost one in 10 people on Finnoey have electrics cars, compared with fewer than one in 100 in Hjelmeland, which is much bigger and has a similar population, according to a previously unpublished ranking of all regions from state-run Statistics Norway that was provided to Reuters."
tesla,2017-9,"""It's all about the economics, not about ideology,"" Wictor Juul, head of administration for the Hjelmeland municipality, said of the contrasting ownership rates."
tesla,2017-9,Norway is among the world's richest countries because of its oil and gas exports - yet even there electric car incentives are being curbed because of the strain on public finances and a faster-than-expected adoption of battery-powered cars.
tesla,2017-9,"For example, it has just scrapped nationwide directives that parking, transport by state-owned ferries and road tolls should be free for electric vehicles, instead leaving it to local authorities' discretion. It is also reviewing tax breaks for the most expensive luxury electric cars."
tesla,2017-9,"So far the reversals have had no apparent impact on sales. ""I'm not too worried,"" said Christina Bu, head of the Norwegian Electric Vehicle Association, because other benefits such as an exemption from value-added tax are staying in place."
tesla,2017-9,"There are, however, examples elsewhere in the world of the consequences of withdrawing electric car benefits."
tesla,2017-9,"Sales of Nissan Leafs in the U.S. state of Georgia, for instance, plunged after authorities revoked a $5,000 tax break in 2015."
tesla,2017-9,"Electric car imports to Denmark fell sharply last year, bucking a European trend, after Copenhagen cut subsidies. Sales of Teslas fell to 176 from 2,738 the year before."
tesla,2017-9,"In Norway, a Tesla Model S electric sedan costs 636,000 crowns pre-tax, almost double the 320,000 crowns pre-tax cost of an Audi A7 gasoline car, the Norwegian Electric Vehicle Association says."
tesla,2017-9,"But the Audi ends up costing more when sold - 697,000 crowns - after an array of taxes led by sales tax (140,000 crowns), carbon dioxide tax (125,000 crowns) and a special tax on the weight of the vehicle (110,000 crowns)."
tesla,2017-9,"By contrast, a Tesla buyer is charged only a small fee for end-of-life scrapping and pays 638,000 crowns in total."
tesla,2017-9,"It's little wonder that Tesla CEO Elon Musk tweeted in June: ""I love Norway, which is the world leader in EV (electric vehicle) adoption!"" His company has invested heavily in Norway, for instance with fast charger networks."
tesla,2017-9,"The Norwegian finance ministry says basic tax breaks totalled about a cumulative 12 billion crowns by the end of 2016. There are now about 140,000 fully electric cars on the road."
tesla,2017-9,"Britain and France, the only two countries to announce deadlines for phasing out combustion engines, also offer generous subsidies to electric car buyers."
tesla,2017-9,"Buyers in Britain get a grant of up to 35 percent of the purchase price, while in France someone selling a diesel car and buying electric receives thousands of euros in benefits."
tesla,2017-9,"Norway's Environment Minister Vidar Helgesen, part of a minority right-wing government that won re-election on Sept. 11, acknowledged that the country's subsidies model was expensive."
tesla,2017-9,But he predicted advances in the technology would mean electric cars would be competitive in price with combustion engine cars in the early 2020s.
tesla,2017-9,His sentiments are echoed in Finnoey by Mayor Henrik Halleland who thinks battery-powered car sales could ultimately survive without large financial incentives.
tesla,2017-9,"The island's tunnel toll charges for combustion engines go towards paying the 550 million crown cost of building the tunnel. Once the debt is paid, the tunnel will be free for all."
tesla,2017-9,"""Electric cars are getting so good that people will buy them anyway,"" said Halleland."
tesla,2017-9,"Still, he now wants electric car owners to pay 50 percent of the rate paid by diesel and gasoline cars. And he's not planning to buy electric himself, saying he has to keep his combustion engine Mazda to pay the tolls and do his bit to pay off the tunnel."
tesla,2017-9,"""It's all about political choices,"" said Arne Nordboe, a teacher and part-time stand-up comedian who drives a Nissan Leaf. ""I think it would be reasonable when electric cars get cheaper and cheaper and more useful, then I can pay more."""

tesla,2017-9,ANALYSIS-Road to electric car paradise paved with handouts - Reuters News
tesla,2017-9,"{{20170921T100140.101+0000}}ANALYSIS-Road to electric car paradise paved with handouts* Worldwide, subsidies still drive electric car markets"
tesla,2017-9,"JUDABERG, Norway, Sept 21 (Reuters) - The Norwegian island of Finnoey has the highest density of electric cars in the world. The reason? They are exempt from the $6,000-a-year toll charges for the tunnel to the mainland."
tesla,2017-9,"There has been a surge in sales of fully electric cars like Teslas and Nissan <7201.T> Leafs since the tunnel opened in 2009 and they now account for one in five cars on Finnoey, compared with less than 1 in 100 globally."
tesla,2017-9,"Twenty-nine percent of all new car registrations in Norway were fully electric or plug-in hybrids last year, according to the International Energy Agency, far ahead of the Netherlands in second on 6.4 percent and Sweden in third on 3.4. China had almost 1.5 percent and the United States less than one."
tesla,2017-9,"State subsidies support sales of electric cars around the world, and Norway has the most electric cars per capita thanks to the most generous handouts."
tesla,2017-9,"It offers nationwide tax breaks for users of electric cars than can be worth tens of thousands of dollars, plus various local incentives like exemptions from road tolls and parking fees."
tesla,2017-9,"""Economic incentives work, especially if they are very, very, very strong as in Finnoey,"" said former Norwegian central bank governor Svein Gjedrem, who grew up on the western island chain of 3,250 people which is famous for its fish farms and tomatoes."
tesla,2017-9,"A reliance on state handouts complicates efforts in nations like Britain and France to phase out combustion engines in favour of battery-powered vehicles, which are far costlier, have limited ranges and often have long charging times. [nL5N1KH21I]"
tesla,2017-9,It means the technology will have to become significantly cheaper if those governments are to meet pledges to ban sales of petrol and diesel cars from 2040 without having to hand out crippling levels of subsidies to millions of buyers.
tesla,2017-9,A tale of two contrasting Norwegian municipalities - Finnoey and neighbouring Hjelmeland on the mainland - starkly illustrates the power of financial incentives on consumer behaviour.
tesla,2017-9,"A Finnoey resident driving to work in nearby oil hub Stavanger with an electric car can save 40,000-50,000 crowns ($5,500-$6,500) a year in tunnel tolls compared with drivers of fossil-fuelled cars."
tesla,2017-9,"Hjelmeland, by contrast, bucks the Norwegian trend by offering no local perks at all for battery-powered cars."
tesla,2017-9,"Almost one in 10 people on Finnoey have electrics cars, compared with fewer than one in 100 in Hjelmeland, which is much bigger and has a similar population, according to a previously unpublished ranking of all regions from state-run Statistics Norway that was provided to Reuters."
tesla,2017-9,"""It's all about the economics, not about ideology,"" Wictor Juul, head of administration for the Hjelmeland municipality, said of the contrasting ownership rates."
tesla,2017-9,Norway is among the world's richest countries because of its oil and gas exports - yet even there electric car incentives are being curbed because of the strain on public finances and a faster-than-expected adoption of battery-powered cars.
tesla,2017-9,"For example, it has just scrapped nationwide directives that parking, transport by state-owned ferries and road tolls should be free for electric vehicles, instead leaving it to local authorities' discretion. It is also reviewing tax breaks for the most expensive luxury electric cars."
tesla,2017-9,"So far the reversals have had no apparent impact on sales. ""I'm not too worried,"" said Christina Bu, head of the Norwegian Electric Vehicle Association, because other benefits such as an exemption from value-added tax are staying in place."
tesla,2017-9,"There are, however, examples elsewhere in the world of the consequences of withdrawing electric car benefits."
tesla,2017-9,"Sales of Nissan Leafs in the U.S. state of Georgia, for instance, plunged after authorities revoked a $5,000 tax break in 2015."
tesla,2017-9,"Electric car imports to Denmark fell sharply last year, bucking a European trend, after Copenhagen cut subsidies. Sales of Teslas fell to 176 from 2,738 the year before."
tesla,2017-9,"In Norway, a Tesla Model S electric sedan costs 636,000 crowns pre-tax, almost double the 320,000 crowns pre-tax cost of an Audi A7 gasoline car, the Norwegian Electric Vehicle Association says."
tesla,2017-9,"But the Audi ends up costing more when sold - 697,000 crowns - after an array of taxes led by sales tax (140,000 crowns), carbon dioxide tax (125,000 crowns) and a special tax on the weight of the vehicle (110,000 crowns)."
tesla,2017-9,"By contrast, a Tesla buyer is charged only a small fee for end-of-life scrapping and pays 638,000 crowns in total."
tesla,2017-9,"It's little wonder that Tesla CEO Elon Musk tweeted in June: ""I love Norway, which is the world leader in EV (electric vehicle) adoption!"" His company has invested heavily in Norway, for instance with fast charger networks."
tesla,2017-9,"The Norwegian finance ministry says basic tax breaks totalled about a cumulative 12 billion crowns by the end of 2016. There are now about 140,000 fully electric cars on the road."
tesla,2017-9,"Britain and France, the only two countries to announce deadlines for phasing out combustion engines, also offer generous subsidies to electric car buyers."
tesla,2017-9,"Buyers in Britain get a grant of up to 35 percent of the purchase price, while in France someone selling a diesel car and buying electric receives thousands of euros in benefits."
tesla,2017-9,"Norway's Environment Minister Vidar Helgesen, part of a minority right-wing government that won re-election on Sept. 11, acknowledged that the country's subsidies model was expensive."
tesla,2017-9,But he predicted advances in the technology would mean electric cars would be competitive in price with combustion engine cars in the early 2020s.
tesla,2017-9,His sentiments are echoed in Finnoey by Mayor Henrik Halleland who thinks battery-powered car sales could ultimately survive without large financial incentives.
tesla,2017-9,"The island's tunnel toll charges for combustion engines go towards paying the 550 million crown cost of building the tunnel. Once the debt is paid, the tunnel will be free for all."
tesla,2017-9,"""Electric cars are getting so good that people will buy them anyway,"" said Halleland."
tesla,2017-9,"Still, he now wants electric car owners to pay 50 percent of the rate paid by diesel and gasoline cars. And he's not planning to buy electric himself, saying he has to keep his combustion engine Mazda to pay the tolls and do his bit to pay off the tunnel."
tesla,2017-9,"""It's all about political choices,"" said Arne Nordboe, a teacher and part-time stand-up comedian who drives a Nissan Leaf. ""I think it would be reasonable when electric cars get cheaper and cheaper and more useful, then I can pay more."""

tesla,2017-9,* Corri-Door is big part of French motorway charge network
tesla,2017-9,"PARIS, Sept 19 (Reuters) - French utility EDF is expecting rapid growth in its electric vehicle charging network and aims to increase the number of its docking stations, an EDF executive said."
tesla,2017-9,"EDF's electric mobility business Sodetrel has achieved revenue growth of 50 percent annually in the past three years. It now operates some 4,000 charging points countrywide, mainly in public spaces."
tesla,2017-9,"Sodetrel's new Corri-Door fast-charging network along French highways has also grown rapidly. The number of individual charges tripled to 3,000 in August this year from 1,000 in August 2016, Sodetrel CEO Juliette Antoine-Simon said at an EDF strategy presentation on Tuesday."
tesla,2017-9,"""There are no queues at our charging stations yet, but some of them are highly utilised,"" she told reporters."
tesla,2017-9,Corri-Door's 200 fast-charging 50 kilovolt stations are placed at 80 kilometre (50 miles) intervals in petrol stations along French highways and allow an electric vehicle (EV) to be recharged in 20-30 minutes.
tesla,2017-9,"Antoine-Simon said Corri-Door stations in the Paris area, as well as on major motorways to the south, north and west were used intensively. Sodetrel is looking to increase the number of chargers in busy stations and is considering new locations."
tesla,2017-9,"The Corri-Door network, built at a cost of 10 million euros ($12 million), is operated by Sodetrel in partnership with Renault , Nissan <7201.T>, BMW and Volkswagen and is a key link in Europe's EV charging network."
tesla,2017-9,"All electric car brands, including Tesla , can use Corri-Door and Sodetrel customers also have access to some 50,000 EV charging stations in other European countries."
tesla,2017-9,"Utilities are competing to build the first pan-European EV charging networks as the range of these cars increases. France's Engie has bought Dutch EVBox, while Germany's E.ON partners with Denmark's CLEVER. [nL8N1LF39T]"
tesla,2017-9,"Asked whether EDF is also looking to build an EU-wide network, Antoine-Simon said Sodetrel had strong ambitions but would only invest where it saw demand."
tesla,2017-9,Corri-Door is the biggest player on French highways as other brands only operate a handful of stations.
tesla,2017-9,"In terms of charging stations not on the major highways, Sodetrel has a market share of nearly a third of France's 17,000 public charging stations."
tesla,2017-9,It aims to grow that share as it takes over the running of charging stations from construction companies such as Bouygues which build these facilities as part of construction projects but then leave operation to others.
tesla,2017-9,"Sodetrel operates public charging networks in the cities of Paris, Marseille and Grenoble as well as for regions such as Hauts de France and Seine Maritime."
tesla,2017-9,"It also operates charging stations for parking lot operator Indigo, in parking lots for IKEA, retailer Auchamps and Paris airports ADP among others. ($1 = 0.8356 euros)"

tesla,2017-9,* Audi aims to be first to market with 'level three' car
tesla,2017-9,"FRANKFURT, Sept 18 (Reuters) - German carmaker Audi is taking a lead in bringing more automated driving to roads, but rivals seem in no rush to follow while legal and regulatory uncertainties still cloud the technology."
tesla,2017-9,"At the Frankfurt car show, Audi paraded the A8 which can drive itself under certain conditions, help the driver to change lanes and does not require drivers to monitor the road - though they must be ready to intervene at the sound of an alarm."
tesla,2017-9,"On a scale where zero is a fully manual car and five a fully autonomous one, the A8 is a level three, putting it ahead of level two features offered by Tesla and General Motors (GM)."
tesla,2017-9,"Struggling to emerge from the shadow of parent Volkswagen's diesel emissions scandal, Audi is badly in need of a new prestige model and a marketing coup."
tesla,2017-9,"""It's gratifying that we are able to set a positive sign for real 'Vorsprung durch Technik',"" said research and development chief Peter Mertens, referring to Audi's advertising slogan meaning ""advancement through technology""."
tesla,2017-9,"But with special approval still required almost everywhere to drive such a car, and question marks over how quickly the driver has to take back control - and who is responsible during handover - some rivals are sceptical the market is ready."
tesla,2017-9,"""Who will accept to pay for something that they can use only in extremely limited conditions?"" asked Didier Leroy, European chairman of Japanese carmaker Toyota <7203.T>."
tesla,2017-9,"""The fact that Audi is introducing this one now doesn't mean that we will rush in the coming months to say that we are able to do it too. That is not our logic,"" he told Reuters at the car show."
tesla,2017-9,"Among the A8's new features is the ""traffic jam pilot"", which can completely control driving at up to 60 kilometres (37 miles) per hour on a divided highway."
tesla,2017-9,"The German company expects customers will be able to use all the model's self-driving functions next year or in 2019. It is applying for approval country by country, starting with Germany, a spokesman said during the show."
tesla,2017-9,"Audi thus hopes to leapfrog Tesla , whose Autopilot technology suffered a major blow when a driver using it was killed in a crash, and GM , whose Super Cruise feature to be offered this autumn will allow limited hands-off driving at highway speeds on limited access roads like dual carriageways."
tesla,2017-9,"In the wake of the crash, Tesla said the driver was using Autopilot in conditions for which it was not intended, and U.S. regulators said automakers should take steps to make sure semi-autonomous systems are not misused. [nL2N1LT0T4]"
tesla,2017-9,"Regulatory regimes vary widely across the world and, in the United States, even from state to state, creating a headache for manufacturers. Some authorities would rather they held back."
tesla,2017-9,"""We're very concerned about the idea that drivers will be encouraged to pay even less attention than they already are and that manufacturers are rolling out these systems without existing federal standards,"" Linda Bailey, executive director of the U.S. National Association of City Transportation Officials, told Reuters."
tesla,2017-9,"Florida, seen as the least restrictive state, has essentially legalised all forms of autonomous driving without the need for a permit or insurance requirements. New York, at the other end of the spectrum, has a law that demands drivers always have at least one hand on the wheel."
tesla,2017-9,"Michael Jellen, president of Velodyne, which develops lidar sensing technology that is used in autonomous cars, said the industry still had a long way to go."
tesla,2017-9,"""When they truly launch a hands-free, driver disengagement system, that's when we think (the industry) will have evolved,"" he said in an interview. ""Today, when someone has their hands on the wheel and their foot ready to brake, I call that driving."""
tesla,2017-9,"In Europe, Germany is the pioneer, having passed a law in May that legalises autonomous driving in principle as long as a licensed driver is behind the wheel - although approval still has to be sought for individual models."
tesla,2017-9,German politicians hope to persuade the European Union to adopt common regulations to speed adoption of autonomous driving and prevent self-driving systems from having to switch themselves off or change parameters when they encounter national borders - so-called geofencing.
tesla,2017-9,German Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt hosted ministers from France and Luxembourg at the Frankfurt show on Thursday to establish a cross-border testing ground.
tesla,2017-9,"In an attempt to address one area of uncertainty, Audi says it will assume liability for any accidents that happen when its automated driving technology is in use."
tesla,2017-9,"While Audi has not yet fixed premiums for level three technology, the base price for the A8 without optional extra technology is already 90,600 euros ($108,000)."
tesla,2017-9,"Though level three, unlike level two, means theoretically the driver need no longer monitor the road while the car is in charge, the need to potentially jump in to take control limits the activities the driver can do when not in charge."
tesla,2017-9,"""It sets an expectation to the driver that the computer is in control - that's what level three means. It means I can sit back and read a book,"" said Gartner analyst Mike Ramsey."
tesla,2017-9,"Autopilot features have long been used in aeroplanes, but the situation is very different there, where a pilot typically has plenty of time to react."
tesla,2017-9,"""It's very, very rare to face another plane coming just in front of you and just to react in two seconds to avoid a crash. In the car, it's possible,"" Toyota's Leroy said."
tesla,2017-9,"Even then, the hand-off from computer to pilot can be bungled, resulting in crashes such as an Asiana flight into San Francisco in 2013 that killed three people and injured scores."
tesla,2017-9,Some question the worth of introducing level three at all at this stage.
tesla,2017-9,"German automotive supplier Continental , with 1.2 billion euros in assisted driving component sales last year, said industry experts were questioning whether the grey zone in which neither the driver nor the car was clearly in control could be overcome."
tesla,2017-9,"""There is a discussion going on at the moment as to whether one shouldn't skip level three after implementing level two,"" Chief Executive Elmar Degenhart told Reuters at the show."
tesla,2017-9,"Bosch [ROBG.UL], the world's biggest automotive supplier, said it was seeing great demand for level three technology. [nL5N1LS5NZ]"
tesla,2017-9,"Yet at its presentation at the show, it did not talk about autonomous driving in general, but rather only particular applications to solve particular problems, such as an automated valet parking garage it has built with Mercedes maker Daimler in Stuttgart, which should go into service next year."
tesla,2017-9,"""Everything we do in driver assistance has a mass-market use,"" Bosch mobility chief Rolf Bulander said. ""We're not interested in inventing things that will become reality only in a decade."""
tesla,2017-9,"France's PSA Group , which is developing autonomous driving technology with partners for its future Peugeot, Citroen, Opel and DS vehicles, said there was still value in technology that needed human oversight and regular intervention - with the right framework of rules."
tesla,2017-9,"""It still allows you to send and receive emails or read, even while staying on the alert,"" programmes and strategy chief Patrice Lucas told Reuters. ""The biggest hurdles are regulatory."""

tesla,2017-9,{{20170915T131517.686+0000}}Energy firms battle startups to wire Europe's highways for electric cars* Major European utilities link up with EV charging startups
tesla,2017-9,"PARIS/FRANKFURT, Sept 15 (Reuters) - The battle over how and where Europeans charge their electric cars is expanding from the continent's cities to its motorways."
tesla,2017-9,"Refuelling conventional petrol and diesel cars on motorways has long been the domain of the oil companies, which typically have their own networks of filling stations. Several are now talking about setting up high-power charging networks, creating major competition for limited space at motorway service areas."
tesla,2017-9,"""It is a bit of a landgrab now to win this sector,"" said Tim Payne, chief executive of British charging start-up InstaVolt, which has raised 12 million pounds ($16 million) to install 3,000 charge points across Britain by 2020."
tesla,2017-9,"While the range of electric vehicles (EVs) was less than 100 km (60 miles), Europe's utilities were happy to help cities and companies install slow and inexpensive charging points at homes, offices and shops, often supported by state subsidies."
tesla,2017-9,"But Tesla , Porsche and BMW are now making battery-powered cars with enough range to drive across countries. Daimler and Volkswagen also announced plans on the eve of this week's Frankfurt motor show to accelerate their shift to electric cars."
tesla,2017-9,"Charging infrastructure remains nowhere near it needs to be. ""Where is the network of charging points that will be required? Indeed where is the power and the grid?"" Ralf Speth, boss of Britain's Jaguar Land Rover, asked last week."
tesla,2017-9,"Experts including ChargePoint and Engie are, however, making plans to build pan-European networks of high-voltage fast-charging stations which can refill a battery in less than half an hour instead of overnight."
tesla,2017-9,"In Britain, InstaVolt is renting land from filling station operators, bringing them additional revenue from the lease as well as the increased traffic to their shops at the sites. It earns a margin by selling power through the chargers."
tesla,2017-9,"InstaVolt struck a deal in May with ChargePoint, which itself is on a $125 million expansion spree in Europe, to install about 200 of the U.S. group's ultra-fast chargers close to popular roads across Britain."
tesla,2017-9,"Morgan Stanley estimates that 1-3 million public charging points could be needed in western Europe by 2030, adding that while utilities have natural skills in the new industry, it was too early to determine who will come put on top. ""The winning business model is up for grabs,"" it said."
tesla,2017-9,"Today, there are fewer than 100,000 public charging points available in Europe, with only about six percent of them fast, according to the International Energy Agency."
tesla,2017-9,"Almost none of these is super-fast, a term usually used for charging stations with an output of at least 150 kilowatts. More than three times faster than current-generation chargers, they are now being targeted by those trying to become market leaders."
tesla,2017-9,"Contenders include Dutch EV-Box, one of Europe's biggest makers of charging stations, which was snapped up by French utility Engie in March."
tesla,2017-9,"""We expect hundreds of millions of annual revenue from EV-Box in a few years,"" Thierry Lepercq, head of innovation at Engie, told Reuters. He sees Engie's EV charging revenue growing by a factor of 20 in three to five years. Last year, EV-Box had sales of 16 million euros ($19.1 million)."
tesla,2017-9,"EV-Box Chief Executive Kristof Vereenooghe said that unlike most of its competitors EV-Box has been profitable from the start, a claim that makes it stand out in an industry where gaining scale is considered more important for now."
tesla,2017-9,"That's why German utility E.ON , too, announced a strategic partnership with Danish startup CLEVER and said it had the ambition to roll out several hundred ultra-fast charging stations along European motorways."
tesla,2017-9,"CLEVER, which is owned by a group of Danish utilities and runs charging networks in Denmark, Sweden and Germany, wants to extend its network to France, Britain and Italy with E.ON."
tesla,2017-9,"The firm, which unlike EV-Box and ChargePoint does not make its own hardware, is also still looking for other partners. ""We want to connect cities so that you can easily drive across Europe in an electric vehicle,"" CLEVER Chief Executive Casper Kirketerp-Moeller said."
tesla,2017-9,"Among the oil majors, BP , Shell and have all either announced plans or launched pilot projects for EV charging. Few people, however, expect them to become serious contenders for a business that would effectively curb demand for their chief product: oil."
tesla,2017-9,BP did not respond to repeated requests for comment. A spokeswoman for Shell said it did not make economic sense yet to equip petrol stations fully with EV charging points.
tesla,2017-9,"""People like Shell and Total talk a lot, but nothing happens. We are putting the grid connection in place,"" said Michiel Langezaal, founder and chief executive of Fastned, which has 63 EV charging stations in the Netherlands."
tesla,2017-9,"Leasing plots of land, the group wants to raise 100 million euros over the next two years to branch out into Germany, Belgium, France and Britain. So far it gets the stations from Swiss ABB but is also in talks with ChargePoint."
tesla,2017-9,"Unlike utilities and charging station startups, electric vehicle makers see fast charging networks not as a profit centre, but as a loss-leader needed to persuade customers that electric vehicles can drive across continents."
tesla,2017-9,"Tesla, for example, operates a proprietary charging network throughout Europe, mainly in hotels, but it is stretched thinly - in the Ile de France region around Paris it has just a handful of ""superchargers""."
tesla,2017-9,"This year, the group's market valuation surpassed that of General Motors , making it the biggest U.S. carmaker by that measure."
tesla,2017-9,"""Tesla has never been in the black, but had enormous growth,"" said Elke Temme, who co-heads the e-mobility unit of Germany's Innogy ."

tesla,2017-9,"{{20170915T131516.466+0000}}FACTBOX-From refuelling to recharging: filling up electric vehiclesPARIS/FRANKFURT Sept 15 (Reuters) - The battle over how and where Europeans charge their electric cars is expanding from the continent's cities to its motorways. [nL8N1LF39T] But if electric vehicles (EVs) are ever to overtake petrol and diesel-fuelled vehicles, charging will have to become as simple as filling up. Here are some facts about EVs, charging stations and plugs."
tesla,2017-9,"The International Energy Agency's (IEA) 2017 Global EV Outlook said that new registrations of electric cars hit a record in 2016 at over 750,000 worldwide."
tesla,2017-9,"Norway, where electric cars have a 29 percent market share, is the most advanced market, followed by the Netherlands with 6.4 percent and Sweden with 3.4 percent. China, France and Britain all have EV market shares close to 1.5 percent."
tesla,2017-9,"Despite fast growth, the number of EVs is still small: their global stock doubled to 2 million vehicles in 2016 from 1 million in 2015, but accounted for just 0.2 percent of the total number of passenger light-duty vehicles."
tesla,2017-9,"Based on country targets, car maker announcements and scenarios of EV deployment, the IEA sees a good chance that numbers will range between 9 million and 20 million by 2020, and between 40 million and 70 million by 2025."
tesla,2017-9,"World-wide there were more than 322,000 public charging points available in 2016, IEA data show. Only about 110,000 of them were ""fast"" chargers, of which more than 88,000 were in China. Europe had less than 10,000 fast chargers, with Britain and Germany leading with around 1,500 fast-charging points each."
tesla,2017-9,"Morgan Stanley estimates that 1 to 3 million public charging points could be needed in western Europe by 2030, with up to ten times as many in 2050."
tesla,2017-9,"Fast is a relative notion in the EV charging business. So-called level 1 slow chargers are typically installed in private homes and have power output levels of up to 3.7 kilowatts (kW), using alternating current (AC). At that level, it takes a nearly whole night to recharge an EV fully."
tesla,2017-9,"Level 2 chargers go up to 22 kW and are typically installed in parking lots or shops, and can charge an EV in a few hours."
tesla,2017-9,"Level 3 fast chargers range from 22 to 150 kW and have either triphase AC or direct current (DC). The vast majority of the world's fast chargers are at about 50 kW, which can still take hours to recharge a large luxury vehicle."
tesla,2017-9,"Ultra-fast charging docks with capacities of 150 to 350 kW can cut the charging time to 15 minutes or less. These docks can cost upwards of 200,000 euros ($240,00) and hardly any exist yet, most notably because there are few cars ready to take that kind of power."
tesla,2017-9,"Today there are four standards, with the combined charging system (CCS), used in Europe and the United States, emerging as the winner over Japan's CHAdeMO and Tesla's supercharger, a closed system similar to that of Apple ."
tesla,2017-9,"The European Commission wants more interoperability, so that all makes of cars can charge at all charging stations. More and more companies are also developing electronic charge cards that let customers charge at home, at work or on the road with the same payment system."
tesla,2017-9,"China, the world's largest car market, again uses a wholly different standard. ($1 = 0.8359 euros)"

tesla,2017-9,"WASHINGTON, Sept 11 (Reuters) - The National Transportation Safety Board is expected to find on Tuesday that Tesla Inc's Autopilot system was a contributing factor in a May 2016 Model S crash that killed a man in Florida while using the car's semi-autonomous driving system, two people briefed on the matter said."
tesla,2017-9,The people confirmed that the system is expected be labeled a contributing factor in the crash because it allowed drivers to avoid steering or watching the road for lengthy periods. The persons declined to be identified because the NTSB conclusions have not yet been made public.
tesla,2017-9,Bloomberg News reported some of the expected findings earlier on Monday.
tesla,2017-9,The NTSB is also expected to find that Tesla could have taken additional steps to prevent the system's misuse and fault the driver of the Tesla.
tesla,2017-9,"Tesla said in June 2016 that Autopilot ""is not perfect and still requires the driver to remain alert."""
tesla,2017-9,"Also on Monday, the family of the driver killed in the 2016 incident said the car was not to blame for the crash."
tesla,2017-9,"The statement from the family of Joshua Brown, released by a law firm, comes a day before the NTSB hearing to determine the crash's probable cause."
tesla,2017-9,"""We heard numerous times that the car killed our son. That is simply not the case,"" said the statement from the family, breaking its silence on the crash. ""There was a small window of time when neither Joshua nor the Tesla features noticed the truck making the left-hand turn in front of the car."""
tesla,2017-9,"""People die every day in car accidents,"" the statement said. ""Change always comes with risks, and zero tolerance for deaths would totally stop innovation and improvements."""
tesla,2017-9,"A spokeswoman for Tesla and a lawyer for the family, Jack Landskroner, have declined to say if the automaker has reached a legal settlement with the Brown family."
tesla,2017-9,"""Josh Brown was a friend to Tesla, and as his family articulated so eloquently, a passionate advocate for technology. Our thoughts are with the entire Brown family,"" the company said in a statement Monday."
tesla,2017-9,"The fatal incident raised questions about the safety of systems that can perform driving tasks for long stretches with little or no human intervention, but which cannot completely replace human drivers."
tesla,2017-9,"Brown, a 40-year-old Ohio man, was killed near Williston, Florida, when his Model S collided with a truck while it was engaged in the ""Autopilot"" mode."
tesla,2017-9,"In January, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said it found no evidence of defects in the crash. NHTSA said Brown did not apply the brakes and his last action was to set the cruise control at 74 miles per hour (119 kph), less than two minutes before the crash - above the 65-mph speed limit."
tesla,2017-9,"In June, the NTSB said that during a 37-minute period of his final drive Brown had his hands on the wheel for just 25 seconds."
tesla,2017-9,"Tesla in September 2016 unveiled improvements in Autopilot, putting new limits on hands-off driving and other features that its chief executive officer said likely would have prevented the crash death."
tesla,2017-9,"The family noted Tesla's continued improvements to Autopilot and said it ""takes solace and pride in the fact that our son is making such a positive impact on future highway safety."""

tesla,2017-9,{{20170911T040100.749+0000}}U.S. solar installations rise despite drop in residential marketBy Nichola Groom
tesla,2017-9,"Sept 11 (Reuters) - U.S. solar installations rose 8 percent in the second quarter as robust utility demand offset a sharp pullback in residential rooftop systems, according to an industry report published on Monday."
tesla,2017-9,"The industry installed 2.39 gigawatts of photovoltaic solar, up from 2.2 GW a year ago, the report by GTM Research and the Solar Energy Industries Association said. Utility projects accounted for 58 percent of the total."
tesla,2017-9,"The quarter's growth is expected to be short lived, as the market is forecast to decline 17 percent for the year, reflecting weaker residential demand and lower utility procurement compared with 2016, when a federal tax credit had been slated to expire. Utilities are in the process of rebuilding their pipelines following the extension of that credit, and market growth is expected to resume in 2019."
tesla,2017-9,"Most new projects for utilities were procured voluntarily rather than because of a need to satisfy government mandates, reflecting the low cost of solar. Voluntary procurement is biggest in the Southeast, though solar is growing most rapidly in the Midwest as utilities see it as a complement to wind farms."
tesla,2017-9,"The non-residential market soared 31 percent to 437 megawatts, boosted by development of community solar projects in Minnesota and Massachusetts and corporate and industrial demand in California. Community solar plants provide power to more than one customer but are far smaller than utility-scale plants. In both Massachusetts and California, developers rushed to complete projects under solar incentive programs."

tesla,2017-9,"FRANKFURT/MUNICH, Sept 7 (Reuters) - Germany's BMW is gearing up to mass produce electric cars by 2020 and will to have 12 different models by 2025, it said on Thursday, as traditional manufacturers race to catch up with U.S. electric car pioneer Tesla ."
tesla,2017-9,"Car buyers shunned electric vehicles because of their high cost and limited operating range until Tesla unveiled the Model S in 2012, a car that cracked the 200 mile (322 km) range barrier on a single charge."
tesla,2017-9,"Since then, big advances in battery technology and a global crackdown on pollution in the wake of Volkswagen's diesel scandal have raised pressure on carmakers to speed up development of zero-emission alternatives."
tesla,2017-9,"BMW, which launched the i3 electric car in 2013, said it was now readying its factories to mass produce electric cars by 2020 if demand for battery driven vehicles takes off."
tesla,2017-9,"It marks a significant foray by a major manufacturer into electrification. BMW, which includes the Mini and Rolls-Royce brands and sold 2.34 million cars last year, announced the move on the day smaller rival Jaguar said it would offer electric or hybrid variants of all its models by 2020.

tesla,2017-9,"Traditional carmakers have been slow to embrace the electric vehicle market because it remains unprofitable, largely due to the cost of batteries which make up between 30 percent and 50 percent of the cost of an electric vehicle."
tesla,2017-9,"A battery pack with 60 kWh capacity and 500 km range costs around $14,000 today, compared with a gasoline engine that costs around $5,000. Add to that the $2,000 for the electric motor and the inverter, and the gap is even wider."
tesla,2017-9,"But capacity investments into the battery sector may bring down costs of electric vehicles to a ""tipping point"" when they reach parity with combustion-engined equivalents some time between 2020 and 2030, according to analysts at Barclays."
tesla,2017-9,"With cities threatening to ban combustion-engined vehicles or to tax diesel cars more heavily, the total cost of ownership of electric cars could drop below their combustion-engined equivalents, and Europe could become a 100 percent pure battery electric vehicle market by 2035, according to analysts at ING."

tesla,2017-9,"Besides the glaring absence of Tesla and its electric Model 3, the roster of big names staying away has grown this year to include such venerable brands as Nissan <7201.T>, Peugeot, Fiat , Volvo, Jeep, Mitsubishi and Infiniti."
tesla,2017-9,"The uncertain fortunes of the traditional car show mirror those of an industry in flux, its incumbents threatened by emissions regulation, tech giants and the sharing economy."

tesla,2017-9,"But many of the traditional gatherings have seen visitor numbers fall since the turn of this century, when most new cars were still unveiled under their lights, framed by show girls."
tesla,2017-9,"The decline may be accelerating. Paris attendance was down 14 percent last year - with fear of attacks also weighing on tourism - and January's Detroit show drew 9,000 fewer visitors."

tesla,2017-9,"Although Mercedes will be out in force on Frankfurt's 200,000-square metre show floor, it is ""getting more complex"" to decide how and where to showcase new products, Fetzer said."

tesla,2017-9,"Next week's show will debut a New Mobility World forum with Google and Facebook as partners, while Mercedes hosts a conference under the banner of South by Southwest, the eclectic cultural gathering held in Texas. Rival BMW's programme includes TED Talks-branded presentations."

tesla,2017-9,"""The way people consume products and brands is changing,"" he said. ""The days when it was enough to lure consumers to shows with half-dressed girls on car bonnets are long gone."""
tesla,2017-9,"The modernisation efforts have not prevented Tesla, Nissan or another half-dozen brands from quitting the car-show circuit."
tesla,2017-9,"For several years, Tesla attended the main European shows before opting out of both Geneva and Frankfurt this year - just as the North American launch of its $35,000 Model 3 makes waves."

tesla,2017-9,"Nissan's decision to skip Frankfurt followed a ""full review at global level of our event and show strategy to facilitate maximum brand visibility"", the company said."
tesla,2017-9,"Reports of the car show's inevitable demise have been exaggerated, however."

tesla,2017-9,"Sept 7 (Reuters) - The U.S. energy storage market fell 11 percent in the second quarter as utilities connected fewer large projects to the grid, but batteries deployed in homes and businesses hit a record thanks to state incentives in California and Hawaii and lower prices on the technology."
tesla,2017-9,"Overall, the U.S. deployed 38 megawatts of new energy storage during the period, down from 42.8 MW a year ago, according to a report released on Thursday by GTM Research and the Energy Storage Association. More than 40 percent of that was installed in homes and businesses, up from just 9 percent in the first quarter."
tesla,2017-9,"The market for energy storage is still small, but growing rapidly as the costs of battery systems have fallen 10 to 15 percent over the last year, according to GTM analyst Ravi Manghani. Batteries can help solve the intermittency of solar energy generation, but the costs are still so high they need government support to make financial sense for customers."
tesla,2017-9,"California, for instance, mandated that utilities procure energy storage systems to help ensure reliable electricity supply following a major natural gas leak near Los Angeles. Those systems created a surge in the utility-scale storage market at the end of 2016 and in the first quarter of 2017, so the decline in the second quarter was expected."
tesla,2017-9,"California was the largest market for both residential and commercial installations, with 604 kilowatts and 12,030 kilowatts, respectively, thanks to a state incentive program that can halve the cost of a battery. State regulators doubled funding for the program earlier this year."
tesla,2017-9,"Top battery manufacturers include Tesla Inc , LG Chem Ltd <051910.KS> and Samsung SDI Co Ltd <006400.KS>."
tesla,2017-9,Businesses are increasingly using batteries to lower hefty utility charges that are based on their peak demand.
tesla,2017-9,"Home battery systems allow customers to store solar power generated during the day for use after sunset. But most homeowners who purchase batteries to pair with their solar systems want them primarily for backup power in the event of an outage, Manghani said."

tesla,2017-9,{{20170905T213657.909+0000}}U.S. to unveil revised self-driving car guidelines -sourcesBy David Shepardson
tesla,2017-9,"WASHINGTON, Sept 5 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump's administration is set to unveil revised self-driving vehicle guidelines next week in Michigan, responding to automakers' calls for elimination of legal barriers to putting autonomous vehicles on the road, sources briefed on the matter said on Tuesday."
tesla,2017-9,"U.S. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao was expected to unveil the revised guidelines next Tuesday at a self-driving vehicle testing facility in Ann Arbor, Michigan, four people briefed on the matter said."
tesla,2017-9,"A spokesman for Chao did not immediately comment. The White House Office of Management and Budget approved the undisclosed Transportation Department changes to the guidelines on Aug. 31, according a posting on a government website."
tesla,2017-9,"On Wednesday, the U.S. House of Representatives will vote on a sweeping proposal to speed deployment of self-driving cars without human controls and bar states from blocking autonomous vehicles. The measure could help many automakers and tech companies keep their pledges of getting self-driving cars on the market by 2020 or 2021."
tesla,2017-9,The House will vote on the bill under fast-track rules that allow no amendments. A bipartisan group of U.S. senators working on similar legislation has not introduced a bill.
tesla,2017-9,"The bill, passed unanimously by a House panel in July, would allow automakers to obtain exemptions to deploy up to 25,000 vehicles without meeting existing auto safety standards in the first year. Over three years, the cap would rise to 100,000 vehicles annually."
tesla,2017-9,"The House measure would require automakers to provide regulators with safety assessment reports proposed in the 2016 self-driving guidelines, but would not require pre-market approval of advanced vehicle technologies."
tesla,2017-9,Consumer advocates have called for giving the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration quicker access to crash data and more funding to oversee self-driving cars.
tesla,2017-9,"Automakers and technology companies, including General Motors Co and Alphabet Inc's self-driving unit Waymo, have sought easier federal rules for self-driving technology, while some consumer groups have pushed for more safeguards."
tesla,2017-9,"The Obama administration issued guidelines for self-driving cars in September 2016, calling on automakers to voluntarily submit details of self-driving vehicle systems in a 15-point ""safety assessment"" and urging states to defer to the federal government on most vehicle regulations."
tesla,2017-9,"Automakers raised numerous concerns about the Obama administration guidance, including the suggestion that automakers should submit systems to regulators for review before putting them on the market."
tesla,2017-9,"Companies including Waymo, GM, Ford Motor Co , Uber Technologies Inc , Tesla Inc and others are aggressively pursuing automated vehicle technologies."

tesla,2017-9,"{{20170901T005747.403+0000}}U.S. labor board files complaint against Tesla over worker rightsAug 31 (Reuters) - The U.S. agency in charge of enforcing labor law on Thursday filed a complaint against electric carmaker Tesla Inc , saying it found merit to workers' complaints about unfair labor practices."
tesla,2017-9,"According to the National Labor Relations Board complaint, Tesla violated workers' rights by requiring them to sign a confidentiality agreement that could bar them from talking about their working conditions and safety issues at the company's facility in Fremont, California."
tesla,2017-9,The agency also investigated charges by the workers that Tesla intimidated and harassed them and violated workers' rights under federal labor law.
tesla,2017-9,"The company must respond to the charges by Sept. 14. The NLRB has scheduled a hearing for Nov. 14 before an administrative law judge in Oakland, California."
tesla,2017-9,"""These allegations, which have been filed by the same contingent of union organizers who have been so outspoken with media, are entirely without merit,"" Tesla said in a statement."
tesla,2017-9,"Complaints were filed by three employees and the United Auto Workers union, which has encouraged Tesla employees to unionize. [nL1N1G11GC]"
tesla,2017-9,"The workers said Tesla made them sign a document that they may face termination or criminal prosecution for speaking publicly, or to the media, about anything they observed at work or their working conditions, NLRB said."

tesla,2017-9,"{{20170831T181648.196+0000}}UPDATE 2-U.S. House to vote on self-driving car legislation next week(Adds automaker trade group reaction, congressional statement)"
tesla,2017-9,"Aug 31 (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives will vote Wednesday on a sweeping proposal to speed the deployment of self-driving cars without human controls and bar states from blocking autonomous vehicles, congressional aides said."
tesla,2017-9,"The bill, which was passed unanimously by a House panel in July, would allow automakers to obtain exemptions to deploy up to 25,000 vehicles without meeting existing auto safety standards in the first year, a cap that would rise to 100,000 vehicles annually over three years."
tesla,2017-9,"Automakers and technology companies including General Motors Co and Alphabet Inc's' self-driving unit Waymo have been pushing for new federal rules making it easier to deploy self-driving technology. Meanwhile, some consumer groups have sought additional safeguards."
tesla,2017-9,The bill will be voted under fast-track rules that do not allow for amendments. A bipartisan group of U.S. senators has been working on similar legislation but has not introduced a bill.
tesla,2017-9,"""Self-driving vehicles stand to make our transportation system safer and more efficient. Advancing this technology to road-ready requires government policy that encourages continued testing and development,"" House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, a Republican, said in a statement. ""This formula is the foundation for what makes America the most innovative country in the world."""
tesla,2017-9,"The Alliance of Automobile Manufacters, a trade group, said in a statement that ""Congress can bring a host of benefits to Americans by helping to bring self-driving vehicles to our roads as quickly as possible."""
tesla,2017-9,"Republicans Representatives Greg Walden and Robert Latta said in a joint statement the ""vote will pave the way for the safe testing, development, and deployment of self-driving cars across the U.S."""
tesla,2017-9,"The issue has taken on new urgency since U.S. road deaths rose 7.7 percent in 2015, the highest annual jump since 1966."
tesla,2017-9,Automakers and technology companies believe chances are good that Congress will approve legislation before year end. Current federal rules bar self-driving cars without human controls on U.S. roads and automakers think proposed state rules in California are too restrictive.
tesla,2017-9,"The measure, the first significant federal legislation aimed at speeding self-driving cars to market, would require automakers to submit safety assessment reports to regulators, but would not require pre-market approval of advanced vehicle technologies."
tesla,2017-9,"Initially, authors proposed to allow automakers and others to sell up to 100,000 vehicles immediately. Representative Frank Pallone, a Democrat, said the phase-in period was essential so ""millions of exempted cars will not hit our roads all at once."""
tesla,2017-9,Manufacturers must demonstrate self-driving cars winning exemptions are at least as safe as existing vehicles.
tesla,2017-9,"Under the House proposal, states could still set rules on registration, licensing, liability, insurance and safety inspections, but could not set self-driving car performance standards."
tesla,2017-9,"Consumer advocates have sought more changes, including giving the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration quicker access to crash data and more funding to oversee self-driving cars."
