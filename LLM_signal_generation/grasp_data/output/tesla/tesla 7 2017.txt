tesla,2017-7,"The U.S. House Energy and Committee on Thursday unanimously approved a bill that would hasten the use of self-driving cars without human controls and bar states from blocking autonomous vehicles. The measure only applies to vehicles under 10,000 pounds and not large commercial trucks."

tesla,2017-7,"WASHINGTON, July 27 (Reuters) - An influential U.S. House committee on Thursday approved a revised bipartisan bill on a 54-0 vote that would speed the deployment of self-driving cars without human controls and bar states from blocking autonomous vehicles."
tesla,2017-7,"The bill would allow automakers to obtain exemptions to deploy up to 25,000 vehicles without meeting existing auto safety standards in the first year, a cap that would rise to 100,000 vehicles annually over three years."
tesla,2017-7,"Automakers and technology companies believe chances are good Congress will approve legislation before year end. They have been pushing for regulations making it easier to deploy self-driving technology, while consumer groups have sought more safeguards. Current federal rules bar self-driving cars without human controls on U.S. roads and automakers think proposed state rules in California are too restrictive."
tesla,2017-7,"The measure, the first significant federal legislation aimed at speeding self-driving cars to market, would require automakers to submit safety assessment reports to regulators, but would not require pre-market approval of advanced vehicle technologies."

tesla,2017-7,"* WM Motor says interested, but unlikely to join for now"
tesla,2017-7,"BEIJING, July 27 (Reuters) - A handful of China's many electric vehicle (EV) start-ups are considering setting up an alliance to pool resources, develop joint technology and bring cars more quickly to the world's biggest autos market."
tesla,2017-7,"In a sign that the country's fledgling EV industry is already consolidating as rules get tougher and competition fiercer, Shen Haiyin, co-founder and CEO of Singulato Motors, said his company and four others - CHJ Automotive, Hongxing Automobile Manufacturing Co, AIWAYS and WM Motor - have discussed an alliance for months."
tesla,2017-7,"Keen to push for cleaner energy cars, in part to combat air pollution and a dependence on imported oil, Beijing wants 8 percent of automakers' sales to be so-called new energy vehicles (NEVs) - battery electric or plug-in hybrids - by next year, rising to 12 percent in 2020, according to latest draft proposals released last month."
tesla,2017-7,"Sales of NEVs this year are forecast by the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers at around 700,000, roughly 3 percent of the overall Chinese autos market."
tesla,2017-7,"Shen, known as Tiger Shen, told Reuters the start-ups aim to finalise the move by end-September with the aim to start developing a common EV platform by the end of this year."
tesla,2017-7,"As the industry shifts towards smart, internet-connected, battery cars, with electrified powertrains, it's increasingly hard for automakers to differentiate, he said."
tesla,2017-7,"""Just like smartphones, whose gut is the same Android operating system across many brands, smart EVs should compete more on ownership experience and services,"" Shen told Reuters."
tesla,2017-7,"The move to pool resources and know-how highlights how Chinese start-ups are scrambling to save time and money in developing products as they face increased pressure from established global automakers shifting into a new market, so far led by Tesla Inc ."
tesla,2017-7,"Also, Chinese policymakers have put on hold approving new EV ventures because of concern that some start-ups have cut corners on technology or have set up just to access attractive subsidies. Regulators are reviewing licensing procedures and may bring in tougher technical requirements early next year, three EV start-up founders and executives told Reuters. [nL3N1JC3I7]"
tesla,2017-7,"Freeman Shen, co-founder and CEO of WM Motor, reckons the prospect of tougher new technical requirements is a big factor spurring start-ups to consider an alliance to develop basic vehicle technology."
tesla,2017-7,"""The government worries about some new start-ups, thinking some of them actually don't have the technology and management expertise to be a legitimate player,"" he told Reuters. ""This shows start-ups need to work together to face competition from traditional automakers."""
tesla,2017-7,"David Jin, spokesman for AIWAYS, said the Shanghai-based start-up ""welcomes cooperation within the industry permitted (under) Chinese law and anti-monopoly law and technical exchanges. We need to make a decision after we get further information."" The company's CEO Fu Qiang declined to comment on any alliance talks, referring questions to Jin."
tesla,2017-7,A spokeswoman for CHJ Automotive and an official at Hongxing Automobile declined to comment.
tesla,2017-7,"Despite years of effort to reduce costs for traditional gasoline-fuelled cars through common vehicle platform technologies, these are still often designed separately for different car models."
tesla,2017-7,"""Gasoline car platforms are often over-designed,"" said Singulato's Shen. ""Who needs cars with platforms that allow you to do a high-speed U-turn or slalom? While we want to design an advanced platform for plug-in battery cars, we don't want to make platforms excessively over-spec'd."""
tesla,2017-7,"WM Motor's Shen said he supports the idea of an alliance, but is unlikely to be part of it, for now, as his company's first vehicles are to be based on vehicle architecture it has already developed itself."
tesla,2017-7,"Singulato's Shen said combining resources would allow alliance members to develop a far more advanced vehicle technology, and for less money."
tesla,2017-7,"""Let's say each player planned to spend 200 million yuan ($30 million) to develop a next-generation platform; if four players each threw in 100 million yuan, we'd all save money but end up with a 400 million yuan platform rather than a 200 million yuan platform,"" he said, ""the benefits are clear."""
tesla,2017-7,"He said that if the alliance does take shape, it would set up a separate company to oversee platform development, and ask independent automotive engineering companies around the world to bid for a contract to help in advanced vehicle technologies that could be shared among alliance partners."
tesla,2017-7,"Alliance partners would also share, and possibly jointly procure from outside suppliers, basic car platform parts like axles and suspension."
tesla,2017-7,"""We plan to ask component suppliers to join the joint venture, too,"" Tiger Shen said."

tesla,2017-7,"SAN FRANCISCO, July 25 (Reuters) - Silicon Valley baron Elon Musk insulted rival billionaire Mark Zuckerberg on Tuesday, escalating a tech wizard war of words over whether robots will become smart enough to kill their human creators."
tesla,2017-7,"""His understanding of the subject is limited,"" Musk said in a tweet about the Facebook Inc founder whose algorithms and other technology revolutionized social media and won 2 billion monthly active users."
tesla,2017-7,"Previously, Zuckerberg was asked about Musk's views on the dangers of robots. In his response, Zuckerberg chided ""naysayers"" whose ""doomsday scenarios"" were ""irresponsible."""
tesla,2017-7,"Zuckerberg and Musk, who is chief executive of electric car maker Tesla Inc and rocket company SpaceX, have been waging a debate at a distance over the past few days on the dangers of artificial intelligence."
tesla,2017-7,The two sharply disagree on whether tougher government regulation is needed for the technology.
tesla,2017-7,"The term artificial intelligence, or AI, is used to describe machines with computer code that learns as it goes. The technology is becoming widely used in sectors such as healthcare, entertainment and banking."
tesla,2017-7,Fear that machines could become so intelligent that they might rise up and overthrow humanity is a common theme in science fiction.
tesla,2017-7,"Musk told a gathering of U.S. governors this month that the potential dangers are not so imaginary, and that they should move to regulate AI."
tesla,2017-7,"""I keep sounding the alarm bell, but until people see robots going down the street killing people, they don't know how to react, because it seems so ethereal,"" Musk said, according to a video of the event."
tesla,2017-7,"""AI is a fundamental risk to the existence of human civilization,"" he added."
tesla,2017-7,"On Sunday, Zuckerberg was streaming video live on Facebook while grilling brisket at home and answering viewers' questions when someone asked him to weigh in on Musk's comments."
tesla,2017-7,"""I'm really optimistic,"" Zuckerberg countered, ""and I think that people who are naysayers and try to drum up these doomsday scenarios, I don't understand it."
tesla,2017-7,"""It's really negative, and in some ways I actually think it's pretty irresponsible."""
tesla,2017-7,"Zuckerberg said AI could result in better diagnoses of diseases and the elimination of car wrecks, and he said he did not see how ""in good conscience"" people could want to slow down the development of AI through regulation."

tesla,2017-7,"SAN FRANCISCO/WASHINGTON, July 20 (Reuters) - Tech entrepreneur Elon Musk on Thursday said he had received ""verbal"" approval to start building an ultra-high-speed underground transport system linking New York and Washington that would cut travel time between the cities to about half an hour."
tesla,2017-7,He offered no details on what entity had greenlighted the project that could result in the world's longest tunnel.
tesla,2017-7,"Musk, the chief executive of electric car maker Tesla Inc and rocket company SpaceX, is seeking to revolutionize transportation by sending passengers and cargo packed into pods through an intercity system of giant vacuum tubes known as the ""hyperloop."""
tesla,2017-7,"Officials in Washington and New York said they had not approved any project, and under federal rules Musk would need extensive environmental and building permits to mount such an ambitious project."
tesla,2017-7,"Musk recently started an enterprise called the Boring Company to build transport tunnels for the system, which he says would be far faster than current high-speed trains and use electromagnetic propulsion."
tesla,2017-7,"In tweets on Thursday Musk said he had ""just received verbal government approval for the Boring Company to build an underground NY-Phil-Balt-DC hyperloop. NY-DC in 29 mins."""
tesla,2017-7,"Amtrak's high-speed Acela train currently takes nearly three hours to cover the roughly 220 miles (355 km) between the two cities, assuming no delays."
tesla,2017-7,"Asked for details on who had offered approval, the Boring Company said in a statement it expected ""to secure the formal approvals necessary to break ground later this year."""
tesla,2017-7,"Musk also tweeted that a first set of tunnels would be to ""alleviate greater LA (Los Angeles) urban congestion,"" adding that the company would also ""probably"" do a loop from Los Angeles to San Francisco, and another in Texas."
tesla,2017-7,"""City center to city center in each case, with up to a dozen or more entry/exit elevators in each city,"" he wrote."
tesla,2017-7,"Musk acknowledged there was still a ""lot of work"" to do before formal approval was granted, but said he was optimistic."
tesla,2017-7,"Signaling that Musk's tweets may be premature, the press secretary for New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio tweeted a reply: ""This is news to City Hall."""
tesla,2017-7,"Musk said in a later tweet that supporters should lobby government officials. ""If you want this to happen fast, please let your local & federal elected representatives know. Makes a big difference if they hear from you,"" he wrote."
tesla,2017-7,"Last month, Musk tweeted that he had ""promising conversations"" about a tunnel network with Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti."
tesla,2017-7,"By traveling in vacuum tubes on magnetic cushions, hyperloop trains would avoid being slowed down by air pressure or the friction of wheels on rails, making them faster and cheaper to operate, supporters say. A number of startups have begun to develop the technology, despite concerns about the cost and practicality."
tesla,2017-7,"On its website, the Boring Company says some tunneling projects today cost as much as $1 billion per mile but its goal is to lower costs by a factor of 10 or more."
tesla,2017-7,"In 2013, Musk said a hyperloop covering the roughly 400 miles (640 km) between Los Angeles and San Francisco would cost less than $6 billion and take seven to 10 years to build."
tesla,2017-7,"President Donald Trump in March met with Musk, who raised the Boring Company idea then, White House officials said. Musk also talked about his plans to launch a mission to Mars."
tesla,2017-7,White House National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn in April praised the idea of Musk using tunnels to speed rail transit on the densely populated east coast of the United States and also to cut traffic congestion in Los Angeles.
tesla,2017-7,"In a statement, the White House said it had had ""promising conversations to date"" with Musk and was committed to ""transformative infrastructure projects."""

tesla,2017-7,"Barely a week goes by without a fresh, starting revelation, whether it be Sweden's Volvo promising to phase out traditional internal combustion engines from 2019 [nL8N1JW0JU] or France aiming to end the sale of gasoline and diesel vehicles by 2040. [nL8N1JX2NI]"
tesla,2017-7,"And, of course, leading the electric charge is the poster child of the green technology revolution, Tesla , which is gearing up to roll out its Model 3, the long-awaited break-out from niche to mass market."
tesla,2017-7,"The ambition is to be producing 20,000 per month by the end of the year. Whether reality matches such lofty goals remains to be seen. Tesla delivered around 47,000 vehicles in the first half of the year, at the lower end of its own forecasts, due to a ""severe shortfall"" of battery packs. [nL3N1JU2FN]"
tesla,2017-7,"Tesla shareholders are used to this sort of thing [nL1N1K429D] but the battery pack delays are a reminder that this accelerating technology revolution rests on a long, complex and still-evolving materials supply chain."
tesla,2017-7,"We don't know at which precise point of that chain Tesla's battery bottle-neck appeared, but questions over the reliability of battery materials supply go all the way up the chain to the brine lakes of the Atacama Desert in South America."
tesla,2017-7,"Simply put, will there be enough lithium, and lithium in the right chemical composition, to support exponentially growing demand for batteries?"
tesla,2017-7,"A year or so ago, the answer appeared to be ""no"", which is why lithium prices went ballistic and the rest of the world outside what was then an esoteric, speciality market sat up and paid attention."
tesla,2017-7,"Spot prices have since calmed down, that for lithium carbonate currently trading in a stable $18.00-$21.70 per kg range, compared with over $25 in early 2016, according to the publication ""Industrial Minerals""."
tesla,2017-7,New producers such as Orocobre's Salar de Olaroz brine operations in Argentina and Neometal's Mt Marion hard-rock mine in Australia are ramping up. More will join them over the next 18 months.
tesla,2017-7,"The existing oligopoly, comprising FMC Corp , Albemarle and Chile's SQM , is meanwhile flexing its collective capacity muscles."
tesla,2017-7,"Analysts at ""The Lithium Spot"" expect supply to grow by around 35,000 tonnes in lithium carbonate equivalent (LCE) terms to 235,000 tonnes this year. That, they note, is pretty much in line with the average demand forecast, meaning ""demand is either right in line or could be slightly outpacing supply for 2017."""
tesla,2017-7,"They expect another 60,000 tonnes of additional supply to kick in over the course of 2018."
tesla,2017-7,The assumption is that all the new capacity ramps up smoothly. It's a big assumption.
tesla,2017-7,"As the first-stage supply reaction kicks in, a second one is now starting to take shape."
tesla,2017-7,"The two leaders in this chase for more production are Chile's SQM and China's Jiangxi Ganfeng Lithium <002460.SZ>, which is now big and integrated enough to claim at least honorary place at the lithium top table."
tesla,2017-7,"The two companies have joined forces with junior miner Lithium Americas and Thai energy company Bangchak to develop the Cauchari brine operations in Argentina with first-phase 25,000-tonne per year LCE production pencilled in for 2019."
tesla,2017-7,"Hot on the heels of SQM's foray across the border came a July 11 announcement it will acquire a 50 percent stake in Kidman Resources , which is developing the Mount Holland hard rock project in Western Australia. First production at the 40,000-tonne per year LCE operations is also scheduled for 2019."
tesla,2017-7,"In addition, SQM is expanding its existing Chilean operations as it seeks to ""capture the opportunities that arise in the lithium market"", to quote company Chief Executive Patricio de Solminihac."
tesla,2017-7,"Solminihac said that SQM estimates demand for lithium is currently around 200,000 tonnes LCE but ""growing at rates of nearly 14 percent per year."""
tesla,2017-7,"""We believe it is highly probable that worldwide demand will exceed 500,000 tonnes by 2025."""
tesla,2017-7,All of which may be good news for Tesla and its peers sitting at the other end of the supply chain but it would seem to bode ill for the countless junior miners aiming for a piece of the lithium action.
tesla,2017-7,"The big three, or big four if Ganfeng is included, are understandably keen not to loosen their historic grip on the market even as it enters a period of potentially explosive growth."
tesla,2017-7,"But those hoping to form part of a third, future supply wave shouldn't lose hope."
tesla,2017-7,"Because while supply appears to be firming up, demand remains a fast-moving, elusive part of the price equation."
tesla,2017-7,"As recently as March this year SQM said it believed lithium demand ""could grow over 10 percent per year in the near term"". Fast forward four months and it has lifted that estimate by four percentage points."
tesla,2017-7,"And this, remember, is one of the most knowledgeable players in the lithium space with more than 20 years of operational and marketing experience."
tesla,2017-7,"If it is being wrong-footed by the speed of change in lithium battery usage, it's a fair bet that everyone else is struggling to make sense of such dynamic fundamentals."
tesla,2017-7,The potential for supply-demand gaps to open up over the coming decade is significant.
tesla,2017-7,Even a hardening consensus that there will be enough supply for the next two or so years rests on a series of questionable assumptions about how efficiently new supply can be brought on stream and then integrated into the existing production chain.
tesla,2017-7,"Beyond that short-term timeframe, the uncertainties just grow ever larger."
tesla,2017-7,"Joe Lowry, lithium industry consultant and commentator, takes the view that even with the recent spate of new project announcements, it is quite possible that a ""supply shortage will cause significant issues in the battery supply chain by 2023."" (""Lithium Investment at the Crossroads"", July 17, 2017)."
tesla,2017-7,"Even relatively advanced projects are still struggling for finance despite all the media hype around lithium, according to Lowry, while Tesla's charismatic chief executive Elon Musk ""seems to think that if he builds cars, the lithium will come."""
tesla,2017-7,"Actually, even Mr Musk might be having second thoughts on lithium supply after those ""severe delays"" in getting battery packs in the first half of the year."

tesla,2017-7,"Representative Debbie Dingell, a Democrat from Michigan, said the bill creates a ""strong but flexible regulatory framework"" that seeks to avoid ""a patchwork"" of different state rules."
tesla,2017-7,Auto dealers want the final bill to clarify that the measure would not preempt state dealer franchise laws that generally bar automakers from selling vehicles directly to consumers.
tesla,2017-7,"Democrats praised the bipartisan proposal but said they want more changes before the full committee takes it up, including potentially adding other auto safety measures."

tesla,2017-7,"Keen to combat air pollution, China is planning to set goals for electric and plug-in hybrid cars to make up at least a fifth of Chinese auto sales by 2025, with a staggered system of quotas beginning in 2018. [nL4N1HX1HS]"
tesla,2017-7,Beijing also sees the policy as a means to help the domestic car industry to compete with foreign rivals that have decades more experience in internal combustion engines.
tesla,2017-7,"The strict new rules plus planned harsh penalties for non-compliance, such as the cancellation of licences to sell non- electric cars in China, has the potential to cause much pain for some automakers in the market."
tesla,2017-7,"""This will hit the industry pretty hard, especially well-known companies,"" said Liping Kang, senior manager at the Innovation Center for Energy and Transportation, a Beijing-based think tank."
tesla,2017-7,"Although Chinese Premier Li Keqiang and German Chancellor Angela Merkel agreed last month that concessions would be made, the ministry later released draft regulations upholding the strict sales quotas. [nL3N1JA3H7]"
tesla,2017-7,"""The proposed rules' ambitious enforcement date is not possible to meet,"" the letter from U.S., European, Japanese and Korean auto industry bodies said."
tesla,2017-7,"""At a minimum, the mandate needs to be delayed a year and include additional flexibilities."""
tesla,2017-7,"The targets demand firms sell electric or plug-in hybrid vehicles to generate ""credits"" equivalent to 8 percent of total sales by 2018, 10 percent by 2019 and 12 percent by 2020."
tesla,2017-7,"The auto industry bodies also asked for China to reconsider some of the penalties for not achieving the quotas, such as plans to ban carmakers from importing and producing non-new energy vehicles altogether."
tesla,2017-7,"They also called for equal treatment of Chinese and foreign makers. Currently foreign carmakers are excluded from getting full subsidies for new energy vehicles and batteries, leaving manufacturers such as Tesla at a disadvantage."
tesla,2017-7,"""This preference for domestic automakers over import automakers undermines the environmental goals of the regulation, puts imports at a competitive disadvantage, and risks opening China up to international trade disputes,"" the letter said."
tesla,2017-7,"Chinese manufacturers are the biggest producers of electric vehicles worldwide, making 43 percent of the total last year, according to consultancy McKinsey & Co."
tesla,2017-7,"The letter was signed by the American Automotive Policy Council, the European Automobile Manufacturers Association, the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association and the Korea Automobile Manufacturers Association."

tesla,2017-7,"NEW YORK, July 14 (Reuters) - Growth fund managers who have long held shares in Tesla Inc said they were still confident in the electric car maker even after production problems sent the stock diving more than 15 percent from its all-time high."
tesla,2017-7,"Fund managers from Janus Henderson, Baron, and Tanaka said they still believed in Tesla, whose pricey valuation and 51 percent gain for the year to date have made it a target of noted short-sellers such as Greenlight Capital's David Einhorn and Kynikos Associates' Jim Chanos."
tesla,2017-7,"The stock tumbled from its record high of $386.99 after the company said July 3 that it had experienced production delays and delivered about 47,100 vehicles in the first half of the year, at the low end of its own forecasts. Tesla shares fell to $323.41 on Thursday."
tesla,2017-7,"""This is not the first nor the last quarterly Tesla disappointment or miss,"" said David Chung, a portfolio manager at Denver-based Janus Henderson funds. ""I think longer-term investors like us recognize that we are still early in this sector and this is a truly special company and exceptional CEO."""
tesla,2017-7,"Chung said the stock valuation remained reasonable based on his estimates of the company's 2020 fiscal year, in which its Model 3 sedan, now in production, will be fully ramped up."
tesla,2017-7,"Chung said he expected the company would sometimes miss estimates sometimes, but Musk has earned the benefit of the doubt given the quality of existing models. The company is well on track to have a significant mass market presence within the next three years, Chung added."
tesla,2017-7,"The first Model 3 rolled off Tesla's assembly line a few days ago, though the company has yet to announce when it will begin regular shipments of pre-ordered vehicles."
tesla,2017-7,"Tesla investors have high hopes for the $35,000 sedan, the company's first foray into the mass market and a key indicator of whether its electric vehicles can become popular enough to displace established rivals like General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co ."
tesla,2017-7,The company expects the Model 3 to help it deliver 6 times its annual volume and turn a profit.
tesla,2017-7,"Yet the company has also been plagued by production delays that prompted it to miss previous forecasts, leading some analysts to cut their outlook."
tesla,2017-7,"""We continue to be cautious relative to the potential for a slower than guided start to Model 3 assembly, and newly believe that the potential for Model3 pre-orders cancellations may increasingly become a point of investor concern,"" noted Ryan Brinkman, an analyst at JPMorgan, who has an underweight rating on the company and a $190 price target on its shares."
tesla,2017-7,"Short sellers have targeted Tesla, which analysts expect to turn its first full-year profit in 2019. Approximately 17 percent of its shares are now being shorted, according to Thomson Reuters data, a level that has remained level throughout the year even as short sellers annual losses have topped $3.8 billion [L1N1I4170]."
tesla,2017-7,"""In terms of conviction, they seem to be very strong because they are taking it on the chin and keep on going on,"" said Ihor Dusaniwsky, head of research at S3 Partners, a financial analytics firm in New York."
tesla,2017-7,"Graham Tanaka, portfolio manager of the New York-based Tanaka Growth fund, said Tesla short sellers were not factoring in potential improvements and growth of the battery division. The company began production of Model 3 batteries at its Gigafactory in Nevada in January, which should reduce costs and improve the lifespan of batteries with greater scale of production, Tanaka said."
tesla,2017-7,"""They're going to be making better batteries at a cheaper price than any of the competition,"" he said."

tesla,2017-7,* Musk has promised delivery within 100 days or it will be free
tesla,2017-7,"SYDNEY, July 7 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc has won an Australian contract to install the world's biggest grid-scale battery in what experts say will be a litmus test for the reliability of large-scale renewable energy."
tesla,2017-7,"Tesla CEO Elon Musk, known for his bold approach to cars, clean energy and space exploration, trumped dozens of competing proposals to build the gigantic lithium-ion battery that will serve as emergency back-up power for South Australia - a state racked by outages."
tesla,2017-7,"But under the agreement, Tesla must deliver the 100-MW battery within 100 days of the contract being signed or it will be free - a commitment Musk made in a Tweet in March."
tesla,2017-7,"""There will be a lot of people that will look at this -'Did they get it done within 100 days? Did it work?'"" Musk told reporters in South Australia's capital city of Adelaide."
tesla,2017-7,"The project likely involves linking hundreds of smaller battery modules and is ""very doable,"" although the 100-day deadline might be tight, Sankar Das Gupta, chief executive of Canadian lithium-ion battery supplier Electrovaya, told Reuters."
tesla,2017-7,"The battery, designed to light up 30,000 homes if there is a blackout, will be built on a wind farm operated by France's Neoen, parts of which are still under construction."
tesla,2017-7,"Musk said failing to deliver the project in time would cost his company ""$50 million or more"" without elaborating."
tesla,2017-7,"It will be the largest lithium-ion battery storage project in the world, overtaking an 80 megawatt-hour facility in California that also was built using Tesla batteries."
tesla,2017-7,"Over the past three years, South Australia has decided to shut down its coal-fired power stations and instead rely on wind, solar and gas. It has raced ahead of the rest of the country in turning to wind power, which supplies 40 percent of its energy."
tesla,2017-7,"The move has been applauded by environmentalists but left the state prone to outages as there is no way to store enough energy when the wind does not blow. In September, South Australia's 1.7 million residents were without power, some of them for up to two weeks, when the grid overloaded and collapsed."
tesla,2017-7,The battery is aimed at getting around the problem of inadequate storage.
tesla,2017-7,"""Cost-effective storage of electrical energy is the only problem holding us back from getting all of our power from wind and solar,"" said Ian Lowe a professor of science at Australia's Griffith University."
tesla,2017-7,"""This project is a significant innovation to demonstrate the feasibility of large-scale storage."""
tesla,2017-7,"Dozens of companies from 10 countries, including privately owned Lyon Group, working with U.S. power company AES Corp , expressed interest in the project. [nL4N1I51XB]"
tesla,2017-7,Now the sector is waiting to see if Musk can make good on his promise.
tesla,2017-7,"""It seems that confidence helped Tesla win but typically this kind of project takes six months so we have to wait and see whether or not Tesla can do it,"" said a source at a Korean competitor to Tesla, declining to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter."
tesla,2017-7,"Late last year, Tesla took about three months to provide a 20-megawatt energy storage system to a substation owned by Southern California Edison Co, the California utility said."
tesla,2017-7,"""The Tesla technology is very mature. It's very well understood,"" said Haresh Kamath, a battery researcher at the Electric Power Research Institute in California. ""It's not a moonshot."""
tesla,2017-7,"Lithium-ion batteries have been in widespread use since about 1991, but mostly on a small scale, such as in laptops and cell phones."
tesla,2017-7,"For their proponents who have long been pushing for grander use, the success of Musk' s big South Australian experiment will be key to greater acceptance."
tesla,2017-7,"""For lithium technology to take off on a global scale, they clearly need the storage capacity to make sure renewables can deliver 24 hours a day, seven days a week,"" said Adrian Griffin, a geologist who specialises in lithium extraction."

tesla,2017-7,{{20170706T234728.487+0000}}Tesla April registrations drop in key California marketBy Marc Vartabedian
tesla,2017-7,"SAN FRANCISCO, July 6 (Reuters) - Registrations of Tesla Inc vehicles in California, by far the largest market of the luxury electric car maker, fell 24 percent in April from a year ago, according to data from IHS Markit."
tesla,2017-7,The findings come as investors worry that demand for Tesla's luxury Model S sedan is waning ahead of the mass market Model 3 launch.
tesla,2017-7,"Tesla earlier this week reported first-half global deliveries of its Model S and its Model X SUV at the low end of its own forecast, driving down the stock and raising questions about demand for the older models."
tesla,2017-7,"Tesla's share price more than doubled between early December and late June as investors bet on Chief Executive Elon Musk's strategy to transform the low-volume luxury electric car maker into a diversified producer of mass market vehicles, storage batteries, electric commercial trucks and rooftop solar panels. The company's market value rose past larger rivals General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co ."
tesla,2017-7,"Since June 23, however, Tesla shares have fallen by nearly 20 percent amid concerns that demand for the company's existing models is weakening. [nL4N1JX1DV]"
tesla,2017-7,"Overall sales of electric vehicles in the United States remain stuck at less than 1 percent of total vehicle sales, despite a growing number of models fielded by Tesla and other car makers."
tesla,2017-7,"Tesla declined to comment on California registration figures and noted that second-quarter global deliveries rose 53 percent from a year earlier, to just over 12,000 Model S and just over 10,000 Model X. It said earlier this week that battery pack production problems held back vehicle output in the second quarter until early June."
tesla,2017-7,"California, a haven for environmentalists and techies, is one of the company's leading markets. The company does not break out results by geographic area."
tesla,2017-7,IHS analyst Stephanie Brinley cautioned that a single month of data could not fully explain Tesla demand.
tesla,2017-7,"""If Tesla had an issue with its production for the month, that could explain"" the drop in registrations, she said, noting in particular the problems with battery pack output. Still, she said, Tesla's Model S, launched in 2012, could be in need of a refresh."
tesla,2017-7,"""They haven't changed much on the exterior or much on the package,"" and it is a high-fashion car, she said. ""I can certainly understand where Model S sales may be softening a little bit because it's an older product. That could be contributing to the issue."""
tesla,2017-7,"Industry data reviewed separately by Reuters showed that the Model S registrations in California were uneven over the first four months of 2017, varying by more than 1,000 units month-to-month. In percentage terms Model S growth peaked in February, decelerated in March and turned negative in April in California."
tesla,2017-7,Brinley said it was difficult to assess whether that reflected demand or availability.
tesla,2017-7,"IHS measures vehicle registration, which comes after a sale. Registration in California and overall in the United States rose sharply for the combined first four months of the year, but April showed steep declines. IHS has not released data for May or June."
tesla,2017-7,"Chief Executive Musk in May stoked concerns that the Model 3 would cannibalize demand for the Model S when he told investors that some ""confused"" Tesla buyers regarded the new Model 3 as an upgrade to the Model S, affecting Model S orders. The new car is a $35,000 mass market vehicle, which costs about half the price of the Model S."
tesla,2017-7,"Tesla reported first-half 2017 global deliveries rose to 47,100 in 2017. Tesla had predicted 47,000 to 50,000. Musk in May said there would be demand for 100,000 luxury Teslas."
tesla,2017-7,"IHS reported April Tesla registrations fell to 2,177 from 2,867 in California. Nationally they dropped nearly 10 percent to 3,911 from 4,334. For the first four months, California registrations rose to 6,926 from 5,804 and U.S. registrations rose to 15,288 from 10,937."
tesla,2017-7,"Tesla shares fell 5.6 percent to close at $308.83 on Thursday, although the stock is up about 45 percent for the year to date."

tesla,2017-7,"The industry sells more cars with these engines than pure electric-powered ones. That's especially true in the fast-growing Chinese market, where around half the world's electric and hybrid cars are sold and where Volvo's owner, Geely[GEELY.UL], is based."
tesla,2017-7,"Tesla accounts for just 3 percent of electric vehicle and hybrid sales there, Barclays points out. Local players selling cheaper cars dominate; meanwhile, the likes of Daimler and General Motors are bulking up. That's likely to bring down the cost of batteries even further, robbing Tesla of one of its major advantages."
tesla,2017-7,"It's emblematic of the growing competition Tesla is facing around the world. Virtually all carmakers have electric and hybrid offerings of their own, whether smaller vehicles like the Nissan <7201.T> Leaf or BMW's high-end i3 and i8."
tesla,2017-7,"Moreover, Tesla is still suffering from growing pains. The latest slip-up was a lack of batteries, which kept production 40 percent below demand for much of the second quarter, the company said just before the July 4 holiday."
tesla,2017-7,"That and Volvo's news took more than 7 percent off Tesla's stock on Wednesday. Even so, Musk's carmaker trades at 25 times estimated 2020 earnings, compared with Toyota's multiple of just over 10 times 2017 earnings. More pain lies ahead."
tesla,2017-7,- Volvo Cars said on July 5 that every vehicle it launches from 2019 onward will have an electric engine of some form or other. Some will be wholly electric while others will have hybrid engines. The company already plans to launch five wholly electric cars between 2019 and 2021.
tesla,2017-7,"- ""This announcement marks the end of the solely combustion engine-powered car,"" said Hakan Samuelsson, president and chief executive officer. ""Volvo Cars has stated that it plans to have sold a total of 1 million electrified cars by 2025. When we said it we meant it. This is how we are going to do it."""
tesla,2017-7,"- Tesla on July 3 said it delivered just over 22,000 cars in the second quarter, up 53 percent from the same period last year.

tesla,2017-7,"While electric and hybrid vehicles are still only a small fraction of new cars sales, they are gaining ground at the premium end of the market, where Volvo operates and where Elon Musk's Tesla Motors has been a pure-play battery carmaker from day one. As technology improves and prices fall, many in the industry expect mass-market adoption to follow."
tesla,2017-7,"""This announcement marks the end of the solely combustion engine-powered car,"" Volvo Cars CEO Hakan Samuelsson said."

tesla,2017-7,"""These five cars will be supplemented by a range of petrol and diesel plug in hybrid and mild hybrid 48-volt options on all models,"" Volvo said. ""This means that there will in future be no Volvo cars without an electric motor."""
tesla,2017-7,"The electric models will be produced at Volvo plants world-wide - it has factories in Europe and China and is building one in the United States - while development costs will be met from within its existing budget, Samuelsson told Reuters."
tesla,2017-7,"""This also means we won't be doing other things. We of course will not be developing completely new generations of combustion engines,"" he said about future investment needs."
tesla,2017-7,"Volvo has invested heavily in new models and plants since being bought by Geely from Ford in 2010, establishing a niche in a premium auto market dominated by larger rivals such as Daimler's Mercedes-Benz and BMW ."
tesla,2017-7,"Part of its strategy has also been to embrace emerging technologies that allow higher performance electric vehicles as well as, eventually, self-driving cars."
tesla,2017-7,"Only last month, Volvo said it would reshape its Polestar business into a standalone brand, focused on high-performance electric cars aimed at competing with Tesla and the Mercedes AMG division. [nL8N1JI0NV]"
tesla,2017-7,Volvo has also said it will build its first fully electric car in China based on its architecture for smaller cars which will be available for sale in 2019 and exported globally.
tesla,2017-7,"Among them, BMW plans to introduce an electric version of its popular 3 series in September to meet the challenge from Tesla, Handelsblatt reported last month. [nL8N1JP5HI]"

tesla,2017-7,"FRANKFURT, July 4 (Reuters) - German auto supplier Robert Bosch [ROBG.UL] has seen a surge in demand for radar systems and video sensors as automakers race to add driver assistance features and automated functions to cars."
tesla,2017-7,The company said on Tuesday it expected sales of radar systems to leap by 60 percent and of video sensors by 80 percent this year.
tesla,2017-7,"It forecast sales at its Mobility Solutions division, which makes sophisticated safety systems as well as autonomous car components, would grow around 7 percent this year, benefiting from a broader push to make vehicles more intelligent."
tesla,2017-7,"Last year, Mobility Solutions - which employs 227,000 staff - generated 43.9 billion euros ($49.8 billion) in sales, boosted by deliveries of crash avoidance technologies."
tesla,2017-7,"""We are growing faster than the market,"" management board member Rolf Bulander said."
tesla,2017-7,Bosch delivers advanced safety systems to all of the world's largest automotive companies as well as start-up carmakers. It developed the electric powertrain and steering for Google's prototype autonomous vehicle and is a supplier of driver assistance systems to Tesla .
tesla,2017-7,"Bosch has around 3,000 developers working on highly automated driving systems, a market which is booming as simple anti-collision technologies like automated braking systems evolve into sophisticated crash avoidance programmes using camera and radar to detect obstacles and avoid collisions."
tesla,2017-7,"Last year, sales of driver assistance systems, which include radar and video sensors used for emergency braking and cruise control functions, reached 1 billion euros, with the company receiving orders for a further 3.5 billion worth of assistance systems, Bosch said."
tesla,2017-7,"Beyond this, the company is expanding into areas such as software, services, internet-connected devices and electric cars."
tesla,2017-7,"In doing so, it is moving into new businesses like short-term motorbike rental, giving it direct access to new consumers and also potentially putting it in competition with its traditional clients: car and motorbike manufacturers that have also launched short-term ride hailing and rental services."
tesla,2017-7,"""While there are market segments where we are clearly a supplier, there are markets which are not yet developed where new players are emerging, this includes us,"" Bulander said."
tesla,2017-7,"Bosch declined to detail which emerging mobility markets, like for example ride-hailing, it is targeting next, but said by the end of 2017, its mobility solutions business would have 48,000 research and development staff, increasing its headcount by roughly 4,000."
tesla,2017-7,"Bosch forecast significant growth in the market for electric scooters and microcars, driven mainly be demand from China and countries like Taiwan. Already this market has seen sales rise from 58,000 in 1998, to more than 30 million per year in Asia."
