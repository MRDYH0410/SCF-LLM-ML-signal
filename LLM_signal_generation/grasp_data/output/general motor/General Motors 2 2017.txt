General Motors,2017-2,"{{20170228T104750.429+0000}}UPDATE 3-Takata plea, compensation deal clears path to potential sale* Takata to pay $1 billion settlement as part of guilty plea"
General Motors,2017-2,"(Adds details on Takata sponsor search, comments from analyst, automakers)"
General Motors,2017-2,"DETROIT, Feb 27 (Reuters) - Japan's Takata Corp <7312.T> removed a major obstacle to its potential sale or restructuring, pleading guilty on Monday in a U.S. federal court to a felony charge as part of a $1 billion settlement that included compensation funds for automakers and victims of its faulty airbag inflators."
General Motors,2017-2,"U.S. District Court Judge George Steeh approved the previously agreed settlement, despite objections from lawyers for victims of Takata inflator explosions that the criminal settlement identified automakers as victims of fraudulent activity."
General Motors,2017-2,Steeh said automakers could be victims of Takata's decisions to hide evidence over 15 years that its inflators were defective and still be subject to civil litigation for harm done to individuals.
General Motors,2017-2,"With the criminal settlement and penalties set in the United States, where the majority of air bag-related fatalities and injuries have occurred, Takata is expected to continue its search for a buyer or financial backer, a process which has dragged on for a year."
General Motors,2017-2,"""Achieving a plea bargain in the United States shows some progress, and could help to revive stagnated talks in Japan,"" SBI Securities senior analyst Koji Endo said in Tokyo."
General Motors,2017-2,"Any deal will require agreement with its automaker clients over whether Takata's restructuring should be managed privately, or through the courts, a sensitive issue for the founding Takada family, which holds a majority stake in the company."
General Motors,2017-2,"Steeh said he considered imposing a stiffer sentence, noting federal guidelines allowed for up to $1.5 billion in fines. But the judge said he approved the settlement because Takata could otherwise be pushed into bankruptcy, delaying efforts to replace millions of potentially deadly inflators still on the road."
General Motors,2017-2,"""Destruction of the corporation would probably have been a fair outcome in this case,"" Steeh said, adding he had been involved in a separate case in which Takata had admitted to price fixing."
General Motors,2017-2,"Lawyers for U.S. vehicle owners have sued Honda Motor Co <7267.T>, Nissan Motor Co <7201.T>, BMW AG , Ford Motor Co , Mazda Motor Corp <7261.T>, Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T> and other automakers, alleging they knew about the defective Takata inflators for years but kept using them."
General Motors,2017-2,"Lawyers for vehicle owners said in a court filing on Monday in Florida that automakers acted ""recklessly"" because ""they were focused on the low price of Takata's inflators and concerned that if they stopped using Takata's inflators, they might not have a sufficient supply."""
General Motors,2017-2,"Honda said in a statement the filing was ""misleading"", adding that ""the suggestion that Honda chose to use Takata airbag inflators - despite knowing of the risk of rupture - because they were less expensive than other inflators is categorically false."""
General Motors,2017-2,At least 16 deaths have been linked to exploding Takata inflators. The defects have led 10 automakers to recall more than 31 million cars worldwide since 2008. All but one of the deaths have occurred in Honda vehicles.
General Motors,2017-2,"The automakers could face costs to replace all the defective airbags ""that would be 5, 6 or 9 times the $850 million"" set aside in the fund, Steeh said, indicating the total replacement cost could be more than $7.6 billion. The Takata airbag recall is the largest ever for the auto industry."
General Motors,2017-2,"In January, Takata agreed to establish two independently administered restitution funds: one for $850 million to compensate automakers for recalls, and a $125 million fund for individuals physically injured by Takata's airbags who have not already reached a settlement with the company."
General Motors,2017-2,"U.S. senators called for more compensation for victims and voiced their opposition to automakers receiving any payments, arguing that Monday's filing in Florida raised the possibility of their ""possible complicity in Takata's fraud""."
General Motors,2017-2,"""No automaker should receive a single dollar until we fully understand their involvement in this fraud and how they so massively failed to protect their customers,"" they said in a statement."
General Motors,2017-2,"""While today's guilty plea from Takata is welcome news, this is not nearly the end of this sad saga."" Automakers in the United States are set to continue recalling defective inflators through 2020. U.S. safety regulators have said automakers are responsible for replacing defective airbags no matter what happens to Takata. [nL1N1D312K]"
General Motors,2017-2,Takata is seeking financial backers as it faces potentially billions of dollars in recall-associated costs. It has not identified what company has been selected by a steering committee leading that process.
General Motors,2017-2,"Key Safety Systems (KSS), a Chinese-owned auto supplier, is the leading candidate, people familiar with the process said in early February. A person briefed on the matter told Reuters on Monday a decision may be reached by the end of March. [nL4N1FP02N]"
General Motors,2017-2,"Takata has denied investor speculation that it would have to seek some form of bankruptcy protection in the United States or Japan. However, during the court hearing, Judge Steeh and lawyers for the Justice Department alluded to the potential for Takata to collapse if it could not find a buyer. [nL4N1FG1JD]"
General Motors,2017-2,"As part of the agreement with U.S. authorities, Takata has agreed to pay a $25 million fine and has 30 days to pay the $125 million for victim compensation."
General Motors,2017-2,"Takata has up to a year to deliver the remaining $850 million for automaker compensation. If a financial backer takes control of Takata, however, the money for the automakers must be delivered within five days. Reuters had reported in November that Takata may file for bankruptcy as part of a restructuring. [nL4N1D45WT]"

General Motors,2017-2,"SAN FRANCISCO, Feb 27 (Reuters) - Shares of Tesla dropped on Monday after a downgrade by Goldman Sachs, bringing the electric carmaker's decline to 11 percent since its quarterly report last week stoked worries about how much cash it is using to launch its Model 3 sedan."
General Motors,2017-2,"Concerns that Tesla's Model 3 production this year might be delayed, as well as expectations the company will sell stock to raise $1.7 billion, led Goldman Sachs analyst David Tamberrino to downgrade Tesla to ""sell"" from ""neutral""."
General Motors,2017-2,"That helped push the stock down 4.83 percent to $244.52 in morning trade on Monday. If it closes at that level, it will have been the worst three-day performance for the shares since June last year."
General Motors,2017-2,"Even with the recent drop, Tesla has surged more than 30 percent since early December and is up 14 percent in 2017."
General Motors,2017-2,"Tesla has traded between $180 and $280 in recent years, and after hitting 2015 highs earlier this month, it may be headed toward the bottom of that range, Tamberrino wrote in a note to clients."
General Motors,2017-2,"Tesla investors and short sellers disagree about whether the company will become a carbon-free energy and transportation heavyweight or be overtaken first by older, deep-pocketed manufacturers such as General Motors Co ."
General Motors,2017-2,"Seven analysts recommend selling Tesla's shares, while six recommend buying and seven have neutral ratings. Few stocks on Wall Street attract more ""sell"" than ""buy"" ratings."
General Motors,2017-2,"Last May, Goldman Sachs's previous Tesla analyst, Patrick Archambault, raised his rating on Tesla to ""buy"" from ""neutral"" hours before the bank helped launch a secondary stock offer for the company."
General Motors,2017-2,The timing of the two events attracted attention on Wall Street because banks are required to keep their underwriting activities separate from their broker research.

General Motors,2017-2,"WASHINGTON, Feb 26 (Reuters) - U.S. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao said on Sunday she was reviewing self-driving vehicle guidance issued by the Obama administration and urged companies to explain the benefits of automated vehicles to a skeptical public."
General Motors,2017-2,"The guidelines, which were issued in September, call on automakers to voluntarily submit details of self-driving vehicle systems to regulators in a 15-point ""safety assessment"" and urge states to defer to the federal government on most vehicle regulations."
General Motors,2017-2,"Automakers have raised numerous concerns about the guidance, including that it requires them to turn over significant data, could delay testing by months and lead to states making the voluntary guidelines mandatory."
General Motors,2017-2,"In November, major automakers urged the then-incoming Trump administration to re-evaluate the guidelines and some have called for significant changes. Automakers called on Congress earlier this month to make legislative changes to speed self-driving cars to U.S. roads."
General Motors,2017-2,"Chao, in her first major public remarks since taking office last month, told the National Governors Association: ""This administration is evaluating this guidance and will consult with you and other stakeholders as we update it and amend it, to ensure that it strikes the right balance."""
General Motors,2017-2,"In 2015, 35,092 people died in U.S. traffic crashes, up 7 percent and the highest full-year increase since 1966. In the first nine months of 2016, fatalities were up 8 percent."
General Motors,2017-2,"Chao, noting research that 94 percent of traffic crashes were due to human error, said: ""There's a lot at stake in getting this technology right."""
General Motors,2017-2,"She said the Trump administration wanted to ensure it ""is a catalyst for safe, efficient technologies, not an impediment. In particular, I want to challenge Silicon Valley, Detroit, and all other auto industry hubs to step up and help educate a skeptical public about the benefits of automated technology."""
General Motors,2017-2,"Companies including Alphabet Inc's self-driving car Waymo unit , General Motors Co , Ford Motor Co , Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL], Tesla Inc and other are aggressively pursuing automated vehicle technologies."
General Motors,2017-2,"Chao said she was ""very concerned"" about the potential impact of automated vehicles on employment. There are 3.5 million U.S. truck drivers alone and millions of others employed in driving-related occupations."
General Motors,2017-2,"She also said she would seek input from states as regulators develops rules on drones.

General Motors,2017-2,"LONDON, Feb 24 (Reuters) - The head of French carmaker PSA played down the threat to British factories when he discussed the potential takeover of GM's European operations with union officials and politicians in London on Friday."
General Motors,2017-2,"The British visit was the latest part of a charm offensive by Carlos Tavares, chief executive of Peugeot-maker PSA, after news broke last week that PSA was in talks about a possible purchase of the Opel business."
General Motors,2017-2,"Germany accounts for about half of Opel's 38,000 staff, while 4,500 are in Britain where Opel operates as Vauxhall and there are concerns in both countries about the impact of any deal on jobs."

General Motors,2017-2,"""We discussed how PSA's approach is to increase market share and expand production rather than close plants. I was assured that the commitments to the plants would be honoured,"" Clark said in a statement."
General Motors,2017-2,"""There was also recognition that members of the Vauxhall pension fund will be no worse off."""
General Motors,2017-2,"Tavares said this week that the combined company would aim to sell more than 5 million vehicles annually within ""a few years"". PSA and GM Europe delivered 4.3 million vehicles between them last year. [nL8N1G85US]"
General Motors,2017-2,Tavares also delivered a similar message to the Unite union's General Secretary Len McCluskey on Friday.

General Motors,2017-2,"VILLAVERDE, Spain, Feb 23 (Reuters) - As the only European country where carmaker PSA's production overlaps with that of Opel, Spain could deliver the quick cost savings sought by PSA boss Carlos Tavares to convince investors to back his planned acquisition of the rival brand."
General Motors,2017-2,"Between them, PSA - maker of Peugeots and Citroens - and General Motors' Opel operate three Spanish factories that employ about 13,000 people in total."
General Motors,2017-2,"Production at the smallest, PSA's 1950s-era Villaverde plant in Madrid, is running at well below capacity."
General Motors,2017-2,"Its dependence on only one car model has fuelled fears among workers that its output could be absorbed by the French firm's larger factory in Vigo or Opel's site in Zaragoza under a combined group, union sources told Reuters."
General Motors,2017-2,"""Workers at Villaverde are worried,"" one source said. ""This is a space that is under-utilised."""
General Motors,2017-2,"The union sources cautioned, however, that nothing was clear cut because Villaverde's productivity per worker was high compared with elsewhere in Europe, and labour costs low."
General Motors,2017-2,"When asked whether the plant could be closed after the proposed acquisition of Opel, a source at PSA in Spain said it was too soon to assess the effect of a potential deal."
General Motors,2017-2,The Villaverde factory has narrowly escaped closure in recent years thanks to a contract to exclusively produce the Citroen C4 Cactus. It is due to assemble the C4's next incarnation from the end of this year or early 2018.
General Motors,2017-2,"But with production of the Cactus having fallen in 2016 as demand waned, forcing 1,300 of its around 1,700 staff to take temporary reductions in their hours, Villaverde is operating at around 40 percent of its capacity, analysts estimate."
General Motors,2017-2,"If the PSA-Opel deal goes through, shifting Villaverde's production to Zaragoza or Vigo would raise capacity utilisation at the combined group's factories to 85 percent from around 70 percent now, according to Reuters calculations."
General Motors,2017-2,The calculations were based on the analysts' estimate of Villaverde utilisation and figures from PSA and Opel sources on utilisation at the Zaragoza and Vigo plants.
General Motors,2017-2,PSA and Opel declined to comment on any of the figures.

General Motors,2017-2,* Next Corsa due to be launched in only two years
General Motors,2017-2,"PARIS, Feb 23 (Reuters) - French carmaker PSA Group is planning an engineering blitz to redevelop Opel's core models with its own technology if it succeeds in buying General Motors' European arm, company sources and advisers told Reuters."
General Motors,2017-2,"The Peugeot maker, which is in talks with GM on an Opel deal, wants to build the next Corsa mini on the same architecture as its Peugeot 208 and Citroen C3 models, several sources said."
General Motors,2017-2,"This presents a tough challenge as the new GM model is due for an update in two years, leaving little time for a major reworking of its design. PSA's alternative, however, would be to wait until around 2025 - the end of its next model cycle - to tap cost savings in the best-selling vehicle category."
General Motors,2017-2,"Chief Executive Carlos Tavares outlined the plan at a PSA board meeting on Wednesday, one source said. The aim would be to fuse the small car categories that PSA and GM failed to combine under a looser 2012 alliance that missed key targets."
General Motors,2017-2,"Tavares refused on Thursday to comment on the details of possible PSA-Opel vehicle programmes as he presented record PSA earnings to reporters and analysts, stressing that the acquisition had yet to be agreed with GM. [nL8N1G80PW]"
General Motors,2017-2,"But he said the combined company would aim to sell more than 5 million vehicles annually within ""a few years"", confirming an earlier Reuters report. PSA and GM Europe delivered 4.3 million vehicles between them last year. [nL8N1G76TV]"
General Motors,2017-2,"""When you look at the product plan you see that you can, in a quite speedy way, implement significant synergies,"" Tavares said."
General Motors,2017-2,"The next Corsa and related Mokka X mini-SUV are among a wave of small Opel cars already in development for launch in 2019. The two models represent 40 percent of GM's European sales, according to LMC Automotive data."
General Motors,2017-2,"PSA wants the Opel deal to yield cost synergies of between 1.5 billion and 2 billion euros ($1.6-2.1 billion), sources close to the talks have said."
General Motors,2017-2,"PSA and GM have tried before to combine their small cars - the failed centrepiece of a ""global strategic alliance"" unveiled in 2012 and rapidly scaled back to three shared projects from 40 initially considered."
General Motors,2017-2,"Gilles Le Borgne, the PSA engineering chief, told Reuters the earlier small car plans had foundered because GM chose instead to develop the Corsa on its own architecture, pursuing economies of scale between its Opel and Chevrolet brands."
General Motors,2017-2,"""It's completely different now,"" Le Borgne said on Thursday, adding that engineering teams were ready to move fast. ""It would be stupid to miss another cycle,"" he said, adding that it normally takes more than three years to develop a new model."
General Motors,2017-2,"A swift convergence of small car design and production may deepen concern over possible job losses, especially in Germany - home to about half the 38,000-strong GM Europe workforce."
General Motors,2017-2,"The competing PSA and Opel small car and SUV line-ups are currently spread among no fewer than five European plants: Opel Eisenach, Germany, and Zaragoza, Spain; and PSA Poissy and Mulhouse, France, and Trnava, Slovakia."
General Motors,2017-2,"Tavares has promised to honour existing GM plant and job guarantees, but many of those expire in 2018-2020 - around the time the first jointly-developed products would be arriving."
General Motors,2017-2,"""Given the massive overlap of the two businesses, there should be no illusion as to what will need to happen,"" Evercore ISI analyst Arndt Ellinghorst said in a recent note."
General Motors,2017-2,"""It's about hard restructuring in Germany, the UK and Spain resulting in at least 5,000 manufacturing job cuts,"" he predicted. Evercore expects three plants to close by 2021."
General Motors,2017-2,"While PSA will honour past deals, the company insists no new plant or job commitments are on the table. ""We'd discuss those at a later stage,"" a spokesman said, declining further comment."
General Motors,2017-2,"The proposed deal would create a ""European champion"" and offer lifeline to Opel after 16 consecutive years of losses, CEO Tavares said on Thursday. ""This company needs help."""
General Motors,2017-2,"It would also tap future technologies such as PSA electric and plug-in hybrid transmissions due in two years, he said."
General Motors,2017-2,"Joint engineering teams are already working well on vehicles developed under the 2012 cooperation deal, Tavares added, a point of view shared by one of that agreement's architects."
General Motors,2017-2,"""Opel's been losing money for ever, it's sub-critical mass and there's no interesting technology,"" said the executive, who helped draw up the original alliance plan. ""But on the upside, a lot of the technical work is already done."" ($1 = 0.9475 euros)"

General Motors,2017-2,"LONDON, Feb 23 (Reuters Breakingviews) - PSA Group's cruising speed will be hard to sustain. That's the hidden message Chief Executive Carlos Tavares sent investors in the French carmaker on Feb. 23. It helps to explain why the owner of the Peugeot and Citroen brands is so eager to snap up GM's European operations. Creating Europe's second-largest carmaker is a way to unlock economies of scale that could swiftly push Peugeot's profitability to permanently higher levels."
General Motors,2017-2,"But that performance seems unlikely to last. While Tavares has increased his margin target for 2016 to 2018 by 0.5 percentage points, his new goal of 4.5 percent is still well below what PSA achieved last year. The need to boost research and development spending on self-driving vehicles and electric drive trains is a bigger burden for the relatively small carmaker. Volkswagen , which sells three times as many vehicles per year, can spread these costs over more units."
General Motors,2017-2,- French carmaker PSA Group on Feb. 23 reported an 18 percent increase in 2016 operating profit before one-offs to 3.2 billion euros. The figure was slightly higher than the 3.1 billion euros expected by analysts in an Inquiry Financial poll.

General Motors,2017-2,"MOSCOW, Feb 19 (Reuters) - Ford has become the first major foreign carmaker in Russia to see sales grow after three bad years, potentially vindicating its decision to double down on a notoriously volatile market when rivals decided to cut and run."
General Motors,2017-2,"Sales of cars in Russia have fallen by more than half since a 2012 peak of 2.9 million vehicles, due to an economic crisis brought on by low oil prices and Western sanctions. The market fell by 11 percent last year, and was down a further 5 percent in January from a year earlier."
General Motors,2017-2,"Ford's big U.S. rival General Motors pulled out of Russia two years ago. But Ford chose not only to stay, but to keep investing, launching new models with modifications designed to suit the country's harsh driving conditions."
General Motors,2017-2,"Since 2011, its joint venture with Sollers , a Russian partner, has ploughed $1.5 billion into making cars locally to local specifications."
General Motors,2017-2,"Now Ford's sales have turned a corner and rose 10 percent last year, an achievement the company says is proof its strategy is at last paying off."
General Motors,2017-2,"The 40,000 Fords sold in Russia last year are still barely more than a fifth of the almost 190,000 vehicles the company sold in 2008, before the global financial crisis brought the first of two collapses in the Russian car industry in less than a decade."
General Motors,2017-2,"During the latest crisis, Ford's share of the market for foreign cars fell at the expense of Korean competitors Kia <000270.KS> and Hyundai <005380.KS>, which chose to shore up market share through aggressive pricing. But now their sales are still falling, while Ford's are on the rise."
General Motors,2017-2,"The Russian market is ""starting to turn"", Ford CEO Mark Fields told Reuters last week, promising to stand by the company's investments in Russia. ""Our intent is to build on that."""
General Motors,2017-2,The Association of European Businesses lobby group forecasts the Russian car market to finally stabilise this year and grow by 4 percent. But it will still be years before a full rebound.
General Motors,2017-2,"""Despite the economic turbulence, we didn't cut investments and delivered the initial plan to launch seven new vehicles with a significant level of localisation,"" Mark Ovenden, CEO of the Ford Sollers joint venture, told Reuters."
General Motors,2017-2,"He noted that the company opened a $275 million engine plant in 2015, a year in which Ford's Russia sales nosedived 41 percent. The joint venture now operates four plants in Russia."
General Motors,2017-2,"New models, such as the Fiesta hatchback and EcoSport SUV, have been adapted for Russian conditions of bad roads and extreme cold, with higher ground clearance, anti-corrosion finishes and engines adapted for lower grade fuel, Ovenden said."

General Motors,2017-2,Russia has been one of the great dream markets for carmakers since the automobile was invented.
General Motors,2017-2,"Ford first entered Russia in 1907 under the reign of Tsar Nicholas II, but foreign automakers were shut out during the Soviet era when Moscow built its own industry. Well into the 2000s, the market was still dominated by boxy Ladas built on a design licensed by the Soviets from Fiat in the 1960s, leaving huge pent-up demand for more comfortable and reliable models."
General Motors,2017-2,"A decade after the Soviet Union fell, Ford opened Russia's first foreign car plant in St Petersburg in 2002. By the time of its sales peak in 2008, some Russian automotive experts predicted the Ford Focus could become Russia's new national car."
General Motors,2017-2,"Although that ambition now seems far off, the decision to invest so heavily in building cars locally was one reason Ford decided to stay when GM left, said Bespalov."
General Motors,2017-2,"""Ford passed the point of no return in terms of investment,"" he said. ""Ford and GM were in different situations. For Ford the decision to continue to invest meant fewer losses than a decision to leave. For GM, it was the other way round."""
General Motors,2017-2,"Urquhart noted that GM had also been hurt worse than Ford globally by the 2009 downturn, giving it more reason to be cautious in the years that followed."
General Motors,2017-2,"While Ford saw sales grew last year, other foreign car companies suffered further falls, in line with the wider market."
General Motors,2017-2,"Kia, now Russia's second-biggest seller behind domestic top producer Avtovaz , fell by 9 percent, and third-place Hyundai fell by 10 percent. France's Renault , which sunk $1 billion into an initial 25 percent stake in now struggling Avtovaz in 2008, saw sales slide 3 percent last year. Sales of Volkswagens fell 5 percent."
General Motors,2017-2,"IHS' Urquhart said it was still unclear whether Ford's bet on Russia would pay off in the long term, but its presence in Russia would help cement its position among the world's biggest car producers."

General Motors,2017-2,"TORONTO, Feb 17 (Reuters) - General Motors Co must restore hundreds of jobs being cut at a profitable southern Ontario assembly plant or risk failing to reach a new contract with the factory's workers this fall, the president of Canada's largest auto workers union said on Friday."
General Motors,2017-2,"In an unexpected decision, General Motors is cutting 625 jobs at its CAMI auto assembly plant in Ingersoll, Ontario, by the end of July as it phases out production of two current generation vehicles and moves some work to Mexico. [nL1N1FH13Q]"
General Motors,2017-2,The move to shift some jobs to Mexico comes at a time when U.S. President Donald Trump has urged auto executives to build more American plants and invest less in Mexico.
General Motors,2017-2,"Securing jobs will be key to a collective agreement to replace the one expiring in September between GM and its 2,800 CAMI workers, said Unifor president Jerry Dias by phone."
General Motors,2017-2,"While Dias expects Ingersoll negotiations to begin in late summer, Unifor is already raising pressure on GM to restore the jobs at the plant, which built 310,000 vehicles last year."
General Motors,2017-2,"""We're going to have to find a solution,"" said Dias. ""And we're going to have to find a solution now, as opposed to waiting for September."""
General Motors,2017-2,"Dias has blamed the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and Mexico's lower labor costs for the job losses, which it called unjustified given strong sales of the Chevrolet Equinox crossover and GMC Terrain sport utility vehicle assembled at the plant. The next-generation Equinox will be built at CAMI, while the new Terrain will be manufactured in Mexico."
General Motors,2017-2,"CAMI is the plant which produces the most Equinoxes, GM's top-selling crossover, said Joe McCabe, president of AutoForecast Solutions LLC."
General Motors,2017-2,"""If they strike there and the majority of Equinoxes come out of CAMI, that gives Unifor some power,"" he said."
General Motors,2017-2,"Ingersoll was not part of a four-year labor deal the union negotiated with GM Canada last September, which secured C$554 million ($422.6 million) of investments for other plants."
General Motors,2017-2,"Steve Carlisle, managing director of General Motors of Canada, said Ingersoll jobs would be discussed with Unifor in the runup to bargaining."
General Motors,2017-2,"""Obviously, any time there are job losses, there are concerns about that and how we might offset those,"" he said. ""We expect to have conversations about those things when the time comes."" ($1 = 1.3110 Canadian dollars)"

General Motors,2017-2,* UK minister says PSA plans to build on Vauxhall strengths
General Motors,2017-2,"BERLIN/RUESSELSHEIM, Germany, Feb 17 (Reuters) - Germany will do all it can to secure Opel plants and jobs in the country if Peugeot maker PSA buys the General Motors (GM) business, Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Friday, highlighting the political challenges the carmakers face in sealing a deal."
General Motors,2017-2,"Her comments came as workers' representatives at German-headquartered Opel said they were prepared to hold talks with PSA , as long as commitments to jobs and investments were upheld - some of which extend beyond 2020. [nF9N1D4010]"
General Motors,2017-2,"GM and PSA said this week they were in talks over a potential deal for the French carmaker to buy GM's European arm Opel, sparking concerns in Germany and Britain of job losses. Germany accounts for about half of Opel's 38,000 staff, while 4,500 are in Britain where Opel operates as Vauxhall."
General Motors,2017-2,"Europe's car industry has been dogged for years by overcapacity and analysts think cuts will be needed for a deal to make sense. Two sources close to PSA told Reuters on Thursday that job and plant cuts were part of the tie-up talks, with the two Vauxhall sites in Britain in the front line. [nL8N1G15JH]"
General Motors,2017-2,"However, any job losses would be fraught with difficulties, with elections in both Germany and France this year and Britain anxious to prove its departure from the European Union will not lead foreign investors to pull out."
General Motors,2017-2,"""With Opel, the talks are under way. The government has a coordination process under way,"" Merkel told reporters after meeting Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in Berlin."
General Motors,2017-2,"""We will do everything we can politically to secure jobs and sites in Germany,"" she added. [nB4N1DJ02Q]"
General Motors,2017-2,Merkel helped broker a deal in 2009 for Opel to receive government guarantees if GM sold a stake in the business to Canadian auto parts supplier Magna to avert mass lay-offs among Opel's German workforce.
General Motors,2017-2,"GM ended up pulling the plug on that plan, however, instead restructuring, shutting Opel factories in Belgium and Germany and withdrawing the Saab and Chevrolet brands from sale."
General Motors,2017-2,"Earlier, British business minister Greg Clark said he had been told by PSA executives in a meeting on Thursday evening that the French company planned to build on the success of the Vauxhall business if it succeeded in buying Opel. [nL8N1G218M]"
General Motors,2017-2,French Industry Minister Christophe Sirugue also pledged on Friday to stay in daily contact with the German and British governments on the potential deal. The French government owns a 14 percent stake in PSA. [nL8N1G2271]
General Motors,2017-2,"For PSA, owner of the Peugeot, Citroen and DS brands, buying Opel would give it a 16.3 percent share of Europe's passenger car market, vaulting it into second place in the region, ahead of France's Renault but behind Germany's Volkswagen . [nF9N1FN00Z]"
General Motors,2017-2,"While economies of scale could help PSA reduce Opel's long-running losses, many analysts think it would also need to make cost cuts to make the deal work."
General Motors,2017-2,But Opel's labour leaders are in no mood for compromise.
General Motors,2017-2,"""The fundamental basis for these talks ... must be the unequivocal recognition and implementation of existing agreements for all Opel/Vauxhall sites,"" the German and European works councils and trade union IG Metall said in a statement on Friday."
General Motors,2017-2,"Opel Chief Executive Karl-Thomas Neumann tweeted: ""A combination with PSA makes fundamental sense. I have great understanding for our staff and customers' many questions."""
General Motors,2017-2,"At Opel's headquarters in Ruesselsheim near Frankfurt, where European works council chairman Wolfgang Schaefer-Klug briefed staff for about 45 minutes on Friday, workers took the latest twist in Opel's fate in their stride."

General Motors,2017-2,"LONDON/FRANKFURT, Feb 16 (Reuters) - Germany expects PSA Group's proposed acquisition of General Motors' Opel business to go ahead, a minister said on Thursday, after the U.S. carmaker sought to allay fears of large-scale plant closures."

General Motors,2017-2,"Two sources close to PSA said on Thursday that job and plant cuts were part of the tie-up talks, with the two Vauxhall sites in Britain in the front line."
General Motors,2017-2,However British business minister Greg Clark said he had been told by GM President Dan Ammann that there was no plan to scrap the Vauxhall plants in the UK.
General Motors,2017-2,"""I was reassured by GM's intention, communicated to me, to build on the success of these operations rather than rationalise them,"" Clark said in a statement, vowing to maintain ""close contact"" with both carmakers as talks progress."
General Motors,2017-2,"Little is known about the terms of the proposed PSA-Opel deal, or whether GM would even keep a stake in the combined entity. PSA declined to comment on the talks or the prospect of restructuring."
General Motors,2017-2,"However, Britain's Unite trade union, which met with Ammann and Clark, said it had not received the guarantees it sought."
General Motors,2017-2,"""There's no assurances at the moment,"" Unite leader Len McCluskey told Sky News. ""My immediate priority now is to understand where Peugeot is now in this process."""
General Motors,2017-2,"Unite is seeking urgent discussions with PSA Chief Executive Carlos Tavares, McCluskey said."
General Motors,2017-2,"Both carmakers are privately making the case that Opel would face sharper cutbacks under GM's continued ownership than under PSA's, sources close to the matter have said. GM had pledged ""renewed actions"" to restore its European business to profitability before news of the talks broke."
General Motors,2017-2,"PSA is also pledging to ""maintain Opel as a German company in full compliance with German labour law"", according to a person briefed on its contacts with political and union leaders."
General Motors,2017-2,Another source with knowledge of the PSA-Opel talks said on Thursday that Britain's June referendum vote to leave the European Union was a factor weighing against UK plants.
General Motors,2017-2,"""It's much easier to cut jobs in Britain than Germany,"" the person said. ""Restructuring is very likely to happen at the Vauxhall plants."""
General Motors,2017-2,"The German minister's latest comments contrasted sharply with her initial reaction two days earlier, when she said the companies' failure to involve labour or local government representatives in the deal talks was ""totally unacceptable""."
General Motors,2017-2,"The government of Germany's Rhineland-Palatinate region, home to Opel's Kaiserslautern plant, also welcomed the potential creation of a ""European champion"" on Thursday and indicated it had received assurances from GM."
General Motors,2017-2,"""There are signals that ... no plants in Germany will be closed,"" regional Minister-President Malu Dreyer said in a statement."
General Motors,2017-2,Analysts nonetheless believe the rationale behind a deal lies in its potential cost savings as well as increased scale.
General Motors,2017-2,Ratings agency Moody's said on Thursday acquiring Opel should help PSA's credit rating - if the French carmaker pulls off the kind of turnaround that has eluded GM for years.
General Motors,2017-2,"That would require ""substantial restructuring expenses weighing on future cash flow generation"", analyst Falk Frey said. ""The largest obstacle (to) this transaction is the ability of PSA to achieve a turnaround within a reasonable time frame."""

General Motors,2017-2,"Britain's largely foreign-owned car industry has thrived in recent years, but the vote to leave the European Union has cast doubt on future growth by raising the prospect of tariffs which would make UK plants less competitive."

General Motors,2017-2,Feb 14 (Reuters) - General Motors Co Chief Executive Mary Barra's decision to put the company's European operations on the block marks a turning point for the automaker that once prided itself on being the No. 1 vehicle maker in the world.[nL8N1FZ3AH]
General Motors,2017-2,"Selling Opel will mean GM no longer seeks to be a key player in all the major auto markets, but rather is focusing on cash flow and profitability instead of sales volume."
General Motors,2017-2,"There are risks to abandoning markets, especially one as large as Western Europe. GM faces a continuing fight to stop losing share in its core markets. At the same time, Barra faces pressure to do even more, with GM's share price - even after Tuesday's nearly 5 percent gain - below the $41 level it had just before she took over the company."
General Motors,2017-2,"""We believe (GM) investors are willing to accept more radical measures to optimize capital allocation,"" Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas wrote in a note."
General Motors,2017-2,Shedding GM Europe isn't the technology-driven disruption Barra usually refers to in presentations to investors. But it is a major course change for the company.
General Motors,2017-2,GM executives long argued that owning Germany's Opel provided the company with the engineering know-how to develop small and medium sized cars it needed for U.S. and Asian markets. That's one reason why GM in 2009 pulled the plug on a plan to sell its European business to supplier Magna.
General Motors,2017-2,"But small cars are now losing ground in the United States, China and elsewhere to sport utility vehicles. At the same time, tougher emissions and safety regulations are making European vehicles more expensive, and harder to sell in other markets, analysts said."
General Motors,2017-2,"What's also changed since 2009 is GM's relations with its Chinese partners, which give it an alternative to developing small cars in Europe. GM is engineering a new low-cost vehicle lineup for Asia and Latin America with its Chinese partner Shanghai Automotive Industry Corp, a sign of how far Chinese automakers have progressed."
General Motors,2017-2,"Bob Lutz, former GM Vice Chairman and head of product development, said on Tuesday GM could structure a deal with PSA that would still allow for joint product development, and could leave open the possibility of exporting certain Cadillac or Chevrolet models to Europe."
General Motors,2017-2,"""The proceeds from the sale (which would do wonders for the stock price) would permit acceleration of the business in North America and China; a far better use of resources,"" Lutz emailed, adding he had not been in contact with anyone at GM."
General Motors,2017-2,"Even after its traumatic 2009 bankruptcy, GM fought to remain a significant player in all the major world auto markets, and to be competitive with rivals Toyota Motor Corp and Volkswagen AG for the title of world's largest automaker by vehicle sales."
General Motors,2017-2,"Selling Opel would mean GM is setting aside those traditional measures of success to be a smaller company focused on the United States truck market, China and some - but not all - the large, growth markets in Latin America and Asia. Under Barra's leadership, GM has exited Russia and Indonesia after concluding it couldn't earn acceptable returns on investment."
General Motors,2017-2,"Barra has made return on invested capital, cash flow available for share buybacks and profitability the key measures of GM's success, not sales volume."
General Motors,2017-2,"GM Europe fails those tests, despite more than $1 billion spent on restructuring efforts since 2012."

General Motors,2017-2,"NEW YORK, Feb 14 (Reuters Breakingviews) - General Motors can afford to pay billions of dollars to offload Opel. A sale of its European operations to Peugeot producer PSA might bring in cash or, perhaps, a stake in a larger European carmaker. In return, though, the $56 billion GM may have to cover up to $10 billion of unfunded pension obligations. Even the full amount might just make financial sense."
General Motors,2017-2,"GM Europe, which also includes the UK's Vauxhall marque, has not turned a profit in years and lost almost $300 million in 2016. It sucks up some $1 billion each year in capital expenditure that could be put to better use in, say, autonomous cars. And selling it would free up executives' time at the U.S. head office."
General Motors,2017-2,"With PSA worth about 15 billion euros, on those modest assumptions GM Europe would account for about 15 percent of the combined company's value. GM Chief Executive Mary Barra could take cash, but an equity stake might make more sense."
General Motors,2017-2,"The pension obligations are, however, a thorny matter in general, but most of all in Opel's union-friendly home country, Germany, which is readying for a federal election in September."
General Motors,2017-2,"The market could come to the rescue. Parking Opel and Vauxhall with Peugeot would take the European unit's losses off GM's income statement, turbo-boosting its operating margin by more than 1 percentage point to almost 8.7 percent, based on 2016 results."
General Motors,2017-2,"Revenue would go down. But a step change in the profitability of the business could warrant an investor rethink of GM's lowly multiple of just under six times estimated 2017 earnings. Combine the improved margin with an increase in the multiple to seven times earnings, for example, and the company's market capitalization could surge by some $17 billion. That might be a stretch, but it's an indication of how much GM could gain from losing Opel."
General Motors,2017-2,"- French carmaker PSA Group on Feb. 14 confirmed it is in talks with General Motors about buying the latter's European division, which owns the Opel and Vauxhall brands."
General Motors,2017-2,"- The maker of Peugeot, Citroen and DS cars said in a press release it is ""exploring numerous strategic initiatives aiming at improving its profitability and operational efficiency, including a potential acquisition of Opel/Vauxhall.""

General Motors,2017-2,{{20170214T165606.945+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-Peugeot-Opel merger faces winding road to riches(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.)
General Motors,2017-2,"LONDON, Feb 14 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Carlos Tavares has shown he can quickly turn around troubled European carmakers. Within three years of him taking charge at PSA Group , the French company's profit margin has tripled. Now Tavares may be preparing to take on a new challenge by acquiring General Motors' troubled European unit."
General Motors,2017-2,"Combining Europe's third- and sixth-largest makers of passenger cars would be a big step towards ending the gridlock in the continent's auto industry. Despite years of downsizing and a rebound in demand for new vehicles, the industry suffers from overcapacity. Peugeot plants operate at around 74 percent of their potential, according to Evercore ISI analysts."
General Motors,2017-2,"Uniting the Opel and Vauxhall brands with Peugeot and Citroen would lift PSA's European market share to 16 percent, second only to Volkswagen's 24 percent. Bigger companies have better bargaining power with suppliers and are better able to fund rising research and development costs."
General Motors,2017-2,"Placing a value on GM's European business, which has lost money for more than a decade, is tricky. The U.S. group could inject its business into PSA in return for a shareholding, though it sold its stake in the French group a few years ago. Alternatively, PSA could pay cash. Evercore ISI reckons GM's European pension liabilities are so large that the U.S. group might need to pay PSA to take over the business."
General Motors,2017-2,"Even if Tavares can overcome these obstacles, investors recognise that most auto mergers fail to live up to their promise. The French government, which owns 13.7 percent of PSA, may want to protect employment at home. More than half of GM's European workers are in Germany, where wages are high, unions powerful and layoffs costly. As attractive as it seems on paper, a Peugeot-Opel merger faces a winding road to riches."
General Motors,2017-2,"- French carmaker PSA Group on Feb. 14 confirmed it is in talks with General Motors about buying the latter's European division, which owns the Opel and Vauxhall brands."
General Motors,2017-2,"- The maker of Peugeot, Citroen and DS cars said in a press release it is ""exploring numerous strategic initiatives aiming at improving its profitability and operational efficiency, including a potential acquisition of Opel/Vauxhall"". GM issued a similarly worded statement."
General Motors,2017-2,"- Both companies warned that there could be ""no certainty over the conclusion of an agreement""."
General Motors,2017-2,"- Together, PSA and Opel would command a 16.3 percent share of the European car market compared with Volkswagen's 24.1 percent, based on 2016 data. They would overtake Renault as the closest rival to the German carmaker."
General Motors,2017-2,"- By 1445 GMT, PSA shares were up 3.7 percent at 18.57 euros while GM shares had risen 3.8 percent to $36.88."

General Motors,2017-2,{{20170214T162827.995+0000}}UPDATE 4-GM in talks to sell European auto business to Peugeot* Peugeot owner in talks to acquire GM's European business
General Motors,2017-2,"(Recasts throughout, adding context on GM strategy, comments from French, German governments)"
General Motors,2017-2,"LONDON/FRANKFURT, Feb 14 (Reuters) - In a move that could shake up the global auto industry, General Motors Co and French automaker PSA Group said on Tuesday they are in talks that could result in PSA buying GM's European auto operations."
General Motors,2017-2,"For PSA, owner of the Peugeot, Citroen and DS brands, acquiring GM's Opel and Vauxhall brands would give it a 16.3 percent share of the European passenger car market, vaulting it into second place in the region, ahead of French rival Renault SA and behind Germany's Volkswagen AG ."
General Motors,2017-2,"The French government, which owns 14 percent of PSA, could support a deal that would help PSA reach ""critical mass,"" an economy ministry source told Reuters. The government will ""give special attention to the impact in terms of jobs and the industrial impact of these initiatives,"" the source said. France is in the midst of a heated national election campaign. [nL8N1FZ693]"
General Motors,2017-2,"A spokesman for the Peugeot family, which holds a matching stake in the carmaker, was not immediately available."
General Motors,2017-2,"It was not clear what price GM might want for the loss-making European business, or what structure a deal could take."
General Motors,2017-2,"Both companies cautioned in statements that no deal is certain, but investors cheered the disclosure, sending shares in PSA, owner of the Peugeot and Citroen brands, up 3.7 percent and boosting GM shares by 3.5 percent in early New York trading."
General Motors,2017-2,Shares in Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV rose 3.9 percent as investors speculated that one consolidation play could lead to another. Fiat Chrysler Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne has campaigned for more than a year for GM to combine with his company.
General Motors,2017-2,"For GM, selling Opel would be the most dramatic demonstration yet of Chief Executive Mary Barra's strategy of putting profitability and returns on invested capital ahead of market share."
General Motors,2017-2,"Since taking over as GM's CEO in January 2014, Barra has signed off on decisions to quit markets, including Russia and Indonesia, where GM lost money, pull the Chevrolet brand out of Europe, and slash sales to rental car fleets that long propped up U.S. market share with little or no profit."
General Motors,2017-2,"GM's global market share slipped by 0.3 percentage points last year. Selling Opel and Vauxhall, which added almost 1 million cars to its sales, could mean abandoning the global volume race in which it is currently ranked third behind Volkswagen and Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T>, with just over 10 million vehicles delivered last year."
General Motors,2017-2,"In 2015, Barra and GM's board quelled an attempt by an investor group to install representatives on the automaker's board by agreeing to return more cash to shareholders, and to target 20 percent or better returns on invested capital. GM executives said that measure drives them to put more money into high profit markets, such as trucks and SUVs in the United States, or growth opportunities such as developing autonomous cars for ride services, and less in low-earning businesses."
General Motors,2017-2,"Despite delivering robust profits and promising $9 billion in share buybacks between 2015 and 2017, GM shares are still trading below the $41 a share level they reached in December 2013, just before Barra took over as CEO."
General Motors,2017-2,"GM Europe has been a drag on the automaker's global profitability since 1999, the last year Opel and Vauxhall recorded a net profit.[nL1N1FS0I3] GM restructured its European operations over the past six years, shutting Opel factories in Belgium and Germany and withdrawing the Saab and Chevrolet brands from sale. Still, GM Europe failed to break even in 2016, as Barra had once promised it would, and the company said last week it did not expect profits in the operation until 2018."
General Motors,2017-2,"Going forward, GM faces the prospect of heavy investments to comply with European government and consumer demands for cleaner diesel vehicles, and to catch up with a rapid shift toward sport utility vehicles."
General Motors,2017-2,"GM had previously discussed a sale of its European auto business to Canadian parts maker Magna in the aftermath of the financial crisis, when GM was heading toward a U.S. government-led bankruptcy. But GM pulled the plug on the tentative deal in 2009."
General Motors,2017-2,"GM and PSA have already shared production of commercial vans and developed common vehicle platforms, a relic of their last attempt to forge a broader alliance, which was unwound in 2013 with the sale of the U.S. carmaker's stake in PSA."
General Motors,2017-2,"Selling Opel would free up GM to invest more to develop vehicles for the North American and Chinese markets, where it makes nearly all of its automotive profits, as well as to expand new businesses."
General Motors,2017-2,It remains unclear how PSA would cut costs in a combined group. France's PSA has 10 factories in Europe and General Motors has 11 plants.
General Motors,2017-2,"Under Chief Executive Carlos Tavares, PSA has rebounded from a 2013-14 brush with bankruptcy to reach record levels of earnings, posting a 6.8 percent automotive operating margin in the first half of last year. [nL8N1AD1AY]"

General Motors,2017-2,"TOKYO, Feb 10 (Reuters) - Japanese carmaker shares have underperformed their peers in the United States so far this year as investors fret over U.S. President Donald Trump's protectionist stance, ahead of his meeting with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe later in the day."
General Motors,2017-2,"With Trump branding Japan's auto trade as ""unfair"" and accusing Tokyo of using monetary policy to devalue its currency to boost exports, Japanese car makers are seen as likely to take the brunt of any flare-up in trade friction between the two countries."

General Motors,2017-2,"""It is hard to buy the sector with mid/long-term uncertainties,"" said Ryoma Sugihara, director of equity sales at Societe Generale Securities."
General Motors,2017-2,Japanese automaker shares fared worse than their U.S. competitors even as Trump bashed U.S. car makers for having production operations in Mexico.
General Motors,2017-2,"The hit stems from fear that Trump's ""America First"" policies might put Japanese firms in difficult positions."
General Motors,2017-2,"""There are expectations that U.S. auto shares would perform better than their overseas counterparts, as Trump is putting pressure on Japanese and European automakers,"" an analyst at a Japanese securities firm said."
General Motors,2017-2,"General Motors Co has risen 0.7 percent, while Ford Motor Co has gained 2.1 percent. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV has soared 18.5 percent."
General Motors,2017-2,"Trade experts note, however, that World Trade Organization (WTO) rules should give Japan some protection, unlike in the 1980s when Japan agreed to voluntarily curb car exports to the United States."
General Motors,2017-2,"""Given the rules and procedures by the WTO, it would be difficult to impose measures similar to those taken during the 1980s, as long as the U.S. remains a WTO member,"" said Hiroshi Mukunoki, professor of economics at Gakushuin University in Tokyo."
General Motors,2017-2,"After a trade war in the 1980-90s, Japanese car makers expanded U.S. production and their U.S.-bound exports declined to 1.73 million vehicles in 2016 from 3.13 million in 1985."
General Motors,2017-2,"Still, last year Japan earned $39.3 billion through car exports, which accounts for a large part of its $68.9 billion trade surplus with the United States. In contrast, U.S. car exports to Japan amounted to only $0.5 billion."

General Motors,2017-2,"TOKYO/DETROIT, Feb 9 (Reuters) - When Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe meets on Friday with U.S. President Donald Trump, Japan's bulging automotive trade surplus will be a sore spot, but the path to balancing auto exports and imports will be no easier than it was in the 1980s."
General Motors,2017-2,"Trump may press Abe to do more to level the trade imbalance with Japan during a White House visit or a round of golf, [nL4N1FT2IA] [nL4N1FT2MC]. But the two leaders are unlikely to change the fact that the big cars and trucks that America makes do not sell in Japan."
General Motors,2017-2,"Many Japanese consumers, faced with congested cities, favor tiny domestically-made vehicles, called kei cars, which make up more than a third of the market. Priced from around 1.1 million yen, or about $9,800, these cars have engines most Americans would consider inadequate for a motorcycle."
General Motors,2017-2,Even Japan's Toyota Motor Corp <7201.T> and Honda Motor Co <7267.T> cannot convince Japanese consumers to buy models that are popular in the United States. Small sport utility vehicles such as the Toyota RAV4 and Honda's CR-V are seen by Japanese consumers as too big.
General Motors,2017-2,"Only about 13,000 vehicles from U.S. automakers sold in Japan in both 2016 and 2015, and of that about three-fourths were Jeep SUVs made by Fiat Chrysler Automobiles . Ford Motor Co announced last month that it is pulling out of the Japanese market entirely, after selling just 2,400 vehicles there in 2016. [nL3N15931P]"
General Motors,2017-2,"The Japanese auto market has shrunk not only in terms of vehicle size, but in sales volume. As a result, global automakers, including Japan's, are focused on boosting sales in China, the United States and growing emerging markets."
General Motors,2017-2,"""It would take a painstaking fine-tuning of vehicle specs to suit American cars to those driving and other conditions and develop a strong distribution network to be able to gain traction in Japan. It is nothing short of a 20-year effort,"" said a Toyota executive who spoke on condition he not be named."
General Motors,2017-2,"Jaguar Land Rover Japan Ltd Chief Executive Magnus Hansson said the low sales of U.S. cars in Japan did not mean it was a closed market, but rather reflected ""a total and absolute lack of effort over 50 years"" by Detroit."
General Motors,2017-2,"Still, Japan remains an export hub for the big Japanese automakers. The U.S. Commerce Department this week reported that the U.S. trade deficit with Japan in 2016 was $68.9 billion, and of that total surplus, some $52.6 billion was in vehicles and automotive parts."
General Motors,2017-2,"Japan's automakers have more than 90 percent of the Japanese market. Last year U.S. automakers controlled only 45 percent of their home market, the world's second-biggest after China."
General Motors,2017-2,"A bigger factor than imports in the Detroit automakers' loss of U.S. market share since 1980 is the surge in investment by Japan's automakers in U.S. factories. Last year, 56 percent of the vehicles Toyota sold in the United States were made in America, the company said. Toyota said it employs more than 34,000 in the United States."
General Motors,2017-2,For years the growth of Japanese-owned auto factories in the U.S. heartland has helped cool trade tensions.
General Motors,2017-2,"But Trump, a Republican, has turned up the heat by complaining about the trade surplus and accusing Japan of manipulating the value of the yen to disadvantage American-made goods."

General Motors,2017-2,"PARIS/MILAN, Feb 7 (Reuters) - Fiat Chrysler vehicles were allowed to skip key tests for illegal engine software during Italy's main emissions-cheating investigation in the wake of the Volkswagen scandal, according to the transport ministry's own report."
General Motors,2017-2,"The report, presented to a European parliamentary committee in October but never officially published, will be seized upon by environmental groups pressing MEPs to vote on Thursday for tougher EU oversight of vehicle testing by national authorities."
General Motors,2017-2,"""It's imperative that we break this cosy relationship between national testing authorities and their domestic carmakers,"" said Julia Poliscanova, a vehicle emissions specialist at Brussels-based campaign group Transport & Environment.

General Motors,2017-2,"The Italian report may raise questions for Fiat Chrysler (FCA) as it faces a U.S. criminal investigation for alleged emissions manipulation and German accusations that it, like VW , used ""defeat devices"" to confound nitrogen oxide (NOx) tests."
General Motors,2017-2,"FCA on Monday became the third carmaker after VW and Renault to be referred to French prosecutors over the scandal. The Italian-American company denies breaking any laws, a spokesman reiterated, declining further comment. [nL5N1FR61Q]"
General Motors,2017-2,"The ministry findings, which have been circulated by some Italian opposition politicians and examined by Reuters, include complete sets of data for eight diesel cars made by BMW , Ford , Mercedes , Volkswagen and GM's Opel."

General Motors,2017-2,"All seven FCA models also lack data for an ""Artemis"" test that adjusts the EU lab regime to reflect urban driving styles. The three skipped protocols are typically used to help unmask defeat devices by preventing them from detecting the test."

General Motors,2017-2,The rearview mirror is where shareholders were mostly looking. They erased almost 5 percent from the company's market value on Tuesday morning even though GM's fourth-quarter net income exceeded expectations.
General Motors,2017-2,"Its financial engine sputtered in two spots, though. First, pre-tax earnings were around $150 million lower than anticipated. GM also took a $300 million currency hit after British voters opted out of the European Union last summer."
General Motors,2017-2,"Chief Executive Mary Barra still reckons her $54 billion company will at least match, if not improve upon, its 2016 performance. Considering demand for bigger vehicles, that sounds plausible. They accounted for three-fifths of U.S. sales last year compared with 56 percent in 2015, according to Kelley Blue Book. Honda <7267.T>, Toyota <7203.T> and Nissan <7201.T> each also sold around 50 percent more of their major SUV brands last month than in January 2016."
General Motors,2017-2,"The trend helped push GM's average U.S. transaction price for all vehicles last year to $35,400, or $750 higher than in 2015 and $4,300 better than the industry overall. Ford's average transaction price on its F-150 truck increased $1,300."
General Motors,2017-2,"That should keep the cash flowing in. And the higher prices and margins on such vehicles make it easier for automakers to justify either safeguarding current U.S. jobs or creating new ones. That should appease President Donald Trump, who has made a priority of attacking companies making goods abroad to be sold in America."
General Motors,2017-2,"The flip side is that the more gas-guzzling larger vehicles GM and its rivals sell, the harder it will be for their fleets to meet the 54.5 miles-per-gallon target set by President Barack Obama's administration for 2025."
General Motors,2017-2,To keep the good times rolling at GM beyond this year probably would require the new administration to ease off on those rules. That should hardly be a tough sell to Trump and his coterie of climate-change skeptics.

General Motors,2017-2,"DETROIT, Feb 7 (Reuters) - General Motors Co said on Tuesday that fourth-quarter net income fell partly on the strength of the dollar against the British pound and forecast flat 2017 profit per share, sending shares tumbling nearly 5 percent."
General Motors,2017-2,The drop in the stock also reflected concerns about rising inventories of unsold vehicles in the United States.
General Motors,2017-2,"Despite investments in new technology, such as automated vehicles, and new sport utility vehicles and trucks, analysts said GM is unlikely to deliver significant growth in 2017 after two years of record profits."
General Motors,2017-2,Shares in rival automakers Ford Motor Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV also sank.
General Motors,2017-2,"The latest results from GM, the third-largest global automaker, highlighted the challenges facing auto industry chiefs as an era of open trade and low interest rates that fed growth appeared to be ending."
General Motors,2017-2,"During a conference call, GM Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra and Chief Financial Officer Chuck Stevens were asked if there would be any impact on the company if President Donald Trump succeeds in imposing new taxes on imported goods such as auto parts or vehicles."
General Motors,2017-2,"""I've shared a lot of information about the dynamics in the auto industry,"" Barra said. ""Right now it's a very constructive dialogue. The administration is really listening."""
General Motors,2017-2,Stevens said the value of imported parts in its U.S. vehicles is less than many rivals.
General Motors,2017-2,"""We support tax reform that would make the U.S. manufacturing base stronger. A border tax is one part,"" Stevens said. ""There are a lot of moving pieces."""
General Motors,2017-2,"In North America, where GM earned the bulk of its profits, inventories of unsold vehicles at its U.S. dealers rose by one-third to 845,000 vehicles at the end of 2016. Stevens said the company had built up inventories ahead of product launches, and intends to bring them down through this year."
General Motors,2017-2,"Its North American adjusted profit margins declined to 8.4 percent in the fourth quarter from 10 percent a year earlier. Adjusted North American profit margins for full-year 2016 were 10.1 percent, down from 10.3 percent in 2015."
General Motors,2017-2,"Stevens said the company does not expect to break even in Europe this year, but will push to ""get to that point in 2018."""
General Motors,2017-2,"Stevens suggested more restructuring could be on the way for its European operation. ""We need to take renewed actions to get back on the path to a sustainable business,"" he said. ""And we will."""
General Motors,2017-2,"Of the $500 million foreign currency exchange bite from fourth-quarter net income, about $300 million was from the decline in the value of the British pound after the vote to leave the European Union, GM said."
General Motors,2017-2,"GM's fourth-quarter net income fell to $1.8 billion, or $1.19 per share, from $6.3 billion, or $3.92 a share, a year earlier."
General Motors,2017-2,"Excluding one-time items, GM earned $1.28 a share, in the latest quarter, beating analysts' expectations of $1.17 per share."

General Motors,2017-2,"DETROIT, Feb 7 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co plans to expand its lineup of sport utility and crossover vehicles in the United States to 13 models from seven by 2020, according to company officials and supplier sources, in response to rapid growth in SUV sales."
General Motors,2017-2,"At least three of those future models have been approved for production in the past two years, sources said. Since 2014, the market share of sport utilities has increased from 32.6 percent to nearly 40 percent of total U.S. vehicle sales in 2016."
General Motors,2017-2,"That shift is equivalent to more than 3 vehicle assembly plants worth of production annually, and is driving other automakers, including General Motors Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV , to direct more investment towards SUVs and trucks, industry executives said. [nL1N1F010Q]"
General Motors,2017-2,"""SUVs are the top-selling segment in the U.S.,"" said Mark LaNeve, Ford vice president of U.S. marketing, sales and service in a statement released late Monday. ""That is why we are introducing five new SUVs in the U.S. by 2020,"" for the Ford brand."
General Motors,2017-2,Supplier sources said separately that a sixth new model would carry the Lincoln badge.
General Motors,2017-2,"This fall, Ford will launch a redesigned 2018 version of its large Expedition SUV, which competes with the Chevrolet Tahoe and Suburban in one of the most lucrative market segments in the global auto industry. GM's lineup of large SUVs dominates the segment."
General Motors,2017-2,"Ford Division, which makes the company's Ford-branded cars, said its current four-model SUV lineup, which includes the Escape, the Edge and the Explorer, will be joined over the next three years by the compact EcoSport, which will be imported from India in early 2018; the mid-size Bronco, which goes into production in late 2019 in Wayne, Michigan, and a battery-powered compact crossover with a 300-mile range that begins production in Flat Rock, Michigan, in 2019."
General Motors,2017-2,"Ford Division officials did not disclose details on two other unidentified models. Supplier sources said those vehicles likely are new compact models, where consumer demand is greatest. One is based on the next-generation Focus small car, the sources said, while the other could be based on the next-generation of the subcompact Fiesta."
General Motors,2017-2,"By 2020, Ford Division's SUV lineup will grow to nine entries, while the Lincoln brand will market four SUVs, all of which share underpinnings with companion Ford models, according to the sources."
General Motors,2017-2,"The future Lincolns include redesigned versions of the Navigator, due this fall; the MKC in 2019, and the MKX in 2021, the sources said. A fourth model, an all-new mid-size entry which suppliers refer to alternately as the Aviator or MKD, is expected to share underpinnings in 2019 with the next-generation Explorer."
General Motors,2017-2,"In addition, Ford plans to redesign the Escape in 2018, the Explorer in 2019 and the Edge in 2021, the sources said."

General Motors,2017-2,"PARIS/MILAN, Feb 7 (Reuters) - Fiat Chrysler vehicles were allowed to skip key tests for illegal engine software during Italy's main emissions-cheating investigation in the wake of the Volkswagen scandal, according to the transport ministry's own report."
General Motors,2017-2,"The report, presented to a European parliamentary committee in October but never officially published, will be seized upon by environmental groups pressing MEPs to vote on Thursday for tougher EU oversight of vehicle testing by national authorities."
General Motors,2017-2,"""It's imperative that we break this cosy relationship between national testing authorities and their domestic carmakers,"" said Julia Poliscanova, a vehicle emissions specialist at Brussels-based campaign group Transport & Environment.

General Motors,2017-2,"The ministry findings, which have been circulated by some Italian opposition politicians and examined by Reuters, include complete sets of data for eight diesel cars made by BMW, Ford, Mercedes-Benz, Volkswagen and GM's Opel."
General Motors,2017-2,"But for three of the seven FCA models also investigated - a Jeep Cherokee 2.0, Alfa Romeo Giulietta 1.6 and Lancia Ypsilon 1.3 - results are missing from an on-road measurement phase and a reversed version of the EU's standard ""NEDC"" lab test."
General Motors,2017-2,"All seven FCA models also lack data for an ""Artemis"" test that adjusts the EU lab regime to reflect urban driving styles. The three skipped protocols are typically used to help unmask defeat devices by preventing them from detecting the test."
General Motors,2017-2,"No explanation for the missing FCA results was offered in the document. But transport ministry spokeswoman Luisa Gabbi told Reuters a ""new definitive version"" had been drafted to include more data for FCA models following further tests, and would be published in coming weeks."

General Motors,2017-2,"* Takata at centre of global airbag recall, seeks financial rescue"
General Motors,2017-2,"TOKYO/DETROIT, Feb 4 (Reuters) - Takata Corp <7312.T> has selected Chinese-owned Key Safety Systems (KSS), a U.S.-based auto parts supplier, as the final bidder to extend financial support for the Japanese airbag maker, three sources with knowledge of the process have told Reuters."
General Motors,2017-2,"The steering committee leading the selection process told Takata's automaker clients that it has tapped KSS, owned by China's Ningbo Joyson <600699.SS>, to provide financial support for the company, the sources told Reuters on Saturday. Both Takata and KSS declined to comment."
General Motors,2017-2,Takata has been seeking financial backers through the selection process to help it deal with billions of dollars in costs related to the recall of millions of potentially defective airbag inflators that have been linked to at least 16 deaths globally.
General Motors,2017-2,"Previously, Reuters and other media had reported that autoparts suppliers including Sweden's Autoliv Inc had been in the running to bid for Takata."
General Motors,2017-2,"Takata set up a steering committee last year to lead the process of finding a backer, appointing investment bank Lazard ltd as an advisor on the search."
General Motors,2017-2,"Established in 2004, Ningbo Joyson produces a range of car parts from steering wheels to electronic control units, and counts automakers Volkswagen , Ford Motor Co , and General Motors Co among its customers. It has been expanding its global operations, acquiring German supplier Preh Group in 2011 and KSS last year."
General Motors,2017-2,"A successful bid could see KSS take some form of control over Takata, which continues to struggle with the financial and corporate fallout of the automotive industry's biggest-ever product recall, which began in 2008."
General Motors,2017-2,Reuters had previously reported that KSS was preparing to bid for Takata with private equity firm Bain Capital.[nL4N1F85ZM]
General Motors,2017-2,"With around 100 million of its potentially defective airbag inflators slated for recall, the company has sought help from rivals including Autoliv and Japan's Daicel Corp <4202.T> to supply replacement parts."
General Motors,2017-2,"Last month, the company agreed to plead guilty to criminal wrongdoing in the United States, where the majority of airbag-related deaths have occurred, which resulted in a $1 billion fine. It also faces civil lawsuits. [nL1N1F3140]"
General Motors,2017-2,Other people with knowledge of the restructuring process said no decision has been made on the details of Takata's restructuring.
General Motors,2017-2,"Potential bidders for Takata have favoured a court-led turnaround of its Japanese operations, which would cap their exposure to Takata's existing liabilities, estimated by some analysts to be as high as $10 billion for recall costs alone."
General Motors,2017-2,"Such an option could deal a huge blow to shareholders, including the founding Takada family, a major investor. Last week, the company in a statement said it opposed a court-led restructuring, which it says could disrupt its supply-chain and impact its ability to pay suppliers."

General Motors,2017-2,"While a court-ordered process would ensure transparency in identifying Takata's liabilities and offer automaker clients legal cover when convincing shareholders to approve any deal, sources say carmakers may stand to recoup more recall costs from Takata under a turnaround plan arranged out-of-court."

General Motors,2017-2,"WASHINGTON, Feb 3 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday ordered reviews of major banking rules that were put in place after the 2008 financial crisis, drawing fire from Democrats who said his order lacked substance and squarely aligned him with Wall Street bankers."
General Motors,2017-2,"Though the order was short on specifics, financial markets embraced Trump's signal that looser banking regulation is coming and pushed bank stocks higher. The Dow Jones U.S. Banks stocks index closed up 2.6 percent. <.DJUSBK> [.N][nL4N1FO2XY]"
General Motors,2017-2,"At a White House forum on Friday with U.S. business leaders, including JPMorgan Chase's CEO Jamie Dimon, Trump said his administration expects ""to be cutting a lot out of Dodd-Frank."""
General Motors,2017-2,"That will involve a lot more than issuing an order, said former Democratic congressman Barney Frank, co-author of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law that raised capital requirements for banks, restricted their trading by means of the ""Volcker Rule,"" and created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to guard against predatory lending. [nL1N1FO1GQ]"
General Motors,2017-2,"Trump ""can't make any substantial change in the financial reform bill without Congress,"" Frank told Reuters. ""The language in the order doesn't do anything. It tells the secretary of the Treasury to give them something to read. The tone of it is to weaken the bill."""
General Motors,2017-2,"Trump and other critics of the Dodd-Frank law say its regulations have hindered lending. At the meeting with CEO's on Friday Trump said, ""I have so many people, friends of mine, that have nice businesses that can't borrow money...because the banks just won't let them borrow because of the rules and regulations in Dodd-Frank."""
General Motors,2017-2,"Despite such criticisms, recent data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis showed U.S. commercial-bank lending at a 70-year high, climbing steadily since late-2010."
General Motors,2017-2,Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren who lobbied for the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau accused Trump of forsaking middle and lower-income individuals to help banks.
General Motors,2017-2,"""The Wall Street bankers and lobbyists whose greed and recklessness nearly destroyed this country may be toasting each other with champagne, but the American people have not forgotten the 2008 financial crisis - and they will not forget what happened today,"" she said in a statement."
General Motors,2017-2,"Trump's adviser leading the deregulation effort, National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn, was previously a top official at Goldman Sachs . Billionaire investor Carl Icahn, meanwhile, is counseling Trump on regulation across the government."
General Motors,2017-2,"One order signed by Trump requires the U.S. Treasury Secretary to submit possible regulatory changes and legislation modifying Dodd-Frank in 120 days, according to a White House official."
General Motors,2017-2,"Trump's pick for Treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin, also a former Goldman banker, has yet to be confirmed by the full Senate."
General Motors,2017-2,"Meanwhile, a memo tells the Labor Department to review a ""fiduciary rule"" for brokers offering retirement advice that was finalized in 2016. While early reports said Trump wanted to push off the rule's implementation, originally slated for April, by 180 days, the order did not mention any delay. The Labor Department late on Friday said it was considering legal options for delaying. [nL1N1FO1XU] [nL1N18U0RB]"
General Motors,2017-2,"Bankers, lawyers and lobbyists privately said Trump's order would not do much immediately. Also they said that they would prefer less-extensive modifications to Dodd-Frank after spending billions of dollars complying with the law. [nL1N1DO1DU]"
General Motors,2017-2,"Many want to make it ""a little bit more user-friendly,"" said John Kanas, chairman of BankUnited , a lender with less than $20 billion in assets."
General Motors,2017-2,"House of Representatives Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling, a Republican, told reporters at the White House that Trump's approach reflects legislation he has drafted to review Dodd-Frank. Hensarling is expected to re-introduce his bill allowing banks to choose between complying with Dodd-Frank and holding more capital later this month."

General Motors,2017-2,SAN FRANCISCO/WASHINGTON Feb 2 (Reuters) - Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] Chief Executive Officer Travis Kalanick quit President Donald Trump's business advisory group on Thursday amid mounting pressure from activists and employees who oppose the administration's immigration policies.
General Motors,2017-2,"Critics included Uber drivers, many of whom are immigrants themselves."
General Motors,2017-2,"""Joining the group was not meant to be an endorsement of the president or his agenda but unfortunately it has been misinterpreted to be exactly that,"" Kalanick, who had planned to attend a meeting of the group on Friday, said in an email to staff that was seen by Reuters."

General Motors,2017-2,"Social media campaigns had targeted Uber, urging users to delete accounts and opt for rival Lyft Inc. Uber has been emailing users who deleted their accounts to say it shares their concerns and will compensate drivers affected by the ban."

General Motors,2017-2,"MUMBAI, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Indian carmaker Tata Motors said on Thursday it was set to launch the first car under its new TAMO brand next month, with the brand aimed at testing new technologies and enabling the company to become more responsive to changing market trends."

General Motors,2017-2,"Tata Motors, which owns the British luxury carmaker Jaguar Land Rover, has previously faced criticism for being slow to react to changing trends and has lost market share as a result."

General Motors,2017-2,"Organised like a start-up, TAMO could employ people from outside the industy who will focus on sourcing new technologies and forming partnerships to develop new transport concepts, the company said."
General Motors,2017-2,"Tata Motors, maker of the loss-making Nano small car, also said on Thursday it was restructuring its passenger vehicles business in India, which includes reducing the number of car platforms from six to two to improve production efficiencies."

General Motors,2017-2,"The platforms will enable Tata Motors to widen its product range, taking it into market segments where it has previously not been, the company said, adding that it has seen a shift in demand towards premium hatchbacks and SUVs and away from saloon cars."
General Motors,2017-2,"While some of Tata Motors' existing and recently-launched cars will be built on the new platform, the shift will naturally allow it to phase out older models that it does not see potential for, Butschek said."

General Motors,2017-2,* Says North American sales hit by weakness of some models
General Motors,2017-2,"Feb 2 (Reuters) - Airbag and seatbelt maker Autoliv said 2017 would be a year of heavy investments after it won business from ailing Japanese rival Takata and forecast weaker than expected profitability, sending its shares down more than 7 percent."
General Motors,2017-2,"Stockholm-based Autoliv's sales have grow as carmakers replace millions of Takata <7312.T> airbag inflators, a costly ramp-up that coincides with spending on emerging technologies such as autonomous driving and driver assistance systems."
General Motors,2017-2,"""They delivered an outlook that's weaker than people had expected in terms of organic growth and margin,"" said Handelsbanken Capital Markets analyst Hampus Engellau. ""And that shows that this entire year will be affected by them having to invest heavily in the business."""
General Motors,2017-2,"Autoliv said it expected an adjusted operating margin of around 8.5 percent this year on sales growth of about 4 percent on an organic basis, which strips out the impact of currency swings and acquisitions. A Reuters poll of analysts had forecast organic sales growth of 4.7 percent and a margin of 8.8 percent."
General Motors,2017-2,"While Autoliv had previously flagged the need for investment, it said on Thursday net spending on R&D and engineering was expected to be at the high end of a range of 6.5-7.0 percent of sales, a significant increase over 2016."
General Motors,2017-2,It also saw capital spending at the high end of its forecast range.
General Motors,2017-2,"Stockholm-listed shares in Autoliv fell 7.1 pct by 1319 GMT, sharply underperforming an index of European automotive stocks <.SXAP>."
General Motors,2017-2,"Also weighing on the shares was a smaller than expected 1 percent increase in like-for-like sales in the fourth quarter, well short of the 2.5 percent seen by analysts, held back by a slowdown in North American business."
General Motors,2017-2,"Autoliv said a sales slump in the region was driven by declines for some car models from automakers Ford , FCA and General Motors as well as lower sales of replacement inflators for airbags."
General Motors,2017-2,"The company, which reports in U.S. dollars though it is based in Sweden, said fourth-quarter operating earnings fell to $239 million from $281 million a year ago, in line with the mean forecast of $238 mln in Reuters poll of analysts."

General Motors,2017-2,"FRANKFURT/LONDON, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Germany's auto industry is losing hope that trade tariffs with Britain can be avoided, several executives have told Reuters, despite warnings from British Prime Minister Theresa May that an overly tough stance on post-Brexit commerce would seriously harm the country's EU partners."
General Motors,2017-2,"""Merkel may force us to walk away from UK profits for the sake of preventing further EU fragmentation,"" said a senior executive at a German luxury carmaker."
General Motors,2017-2,"The executive, who asked not to be identified because of the subject's sensitivity, said Brexit looks increasingly likely to be ""a disaster"" for trade and for German manufacturers."
General Motors,2017-2,"BMW , along with the Germany-based European arms of GM and Ford , which all have UK plants, know trade barriers would bring large, currently incalculable costs."
General Motors,2017-2,"Under World Trade Organization (WTO) rules, British exports of complete vehicles could be subject to tariffs of up to 10 percent."
General Motors,2017-2,"Ford, Britain's biggest engine maker, warned of 2.7 percent duties on engines ahead of last June's Brexit referendum."
General Motors,2017-2,"Duties on components such as gear boxes and brakes shipped from Britain would likely vary around the 3.7 percent average currently levied by the EU on similar imports from third countries, according to the WTO, unless a preferential deal is struck."
General Motors,2017-2,May recently vowed to take Britain out of the EU single market that allows tariff-free trade in order to gain more control over immigration.
General Motors,2017-2,"At the same time May argued for the ""greatest possible"" market access. But German Chancellor Angela Merkel responded that London should not get an attractive Brexit deal that might encourage other departures. [nB4N1DJ017]"
General Motors,2017-2,"Much is at stake for carmakers in general, and the Germans in particular. About every other car built in Britain is destined for another EU market. German-owned brands claim more than one-third of UK car sales."
General Motors,2017-2,"Think tank Civitas estimates that if Britain leaves the EU without a trade deal, German automotive exporters would pay 1.8 billion pounds ($2.3 billion) in tariffs, nearly half the total 3.9 billion pounds faced by EU-based firms."
General Motors,2017-2,"UK-built vehicles and parts, on the other hand, would be hit by tariffs of around 1.3 billion pounds, according to the group."
General Motors,2017-2,"But German car bosses are unwilling to undermine Merkel's position. Merkel recently reiterated that EU governments would not negotiate Brexit terms until London had triggered the irreversible ""article 50"" leaving process, before adding pointedly that business leaders should show similar restraint."
General Motors,2017-2,"That sentiment was quickly echoed by Matthias Wissmann, head of Germany's influential auto industry lobby, the VDA."
General Motors,2017-2,"""Everything must be done to allow the unfettered flow of goods and services,"" he told reporters. ""But there is one clear priority: we must stand together among the 27 EU member states."""
General Motors,2017-2,"Wissmann's counterpart at Britain's SMMT car industry group also warned UK lawmakers that BMW, Daimler and VW may not push too hard for free trade."
General Motors,2017-2,"German carmakers see ""Europe as more important than the UK market"", SMMT chief Mike Hawes told a parliamentary committee in January. ""They will align with what is best for Germany."""
General Motors,2017-2,"BMW employs in the region of 8,000 workers in Britain, including at its plants which export roughly 2.4 billion pounds of vehicles and engines, most notably a large majority of the Mini and Rolls-Royce cars assembled there."
General Motors,2017-2,"Ford, which has warned against tariffs, builds engines in Dagenham and Bridgend for vehicles assembled in mainland Europe. GM builds Opel/Vauxhall Astras on Britain's west coast and expects Brexit to have wiped $400 million from 2016 earnings."
General Motors,2017-2,"""We are worried,"" said a director at the German unit of a major global carmaker. ""I don't expect there will be special deals for any industry."""
General Motors,2017-2,"Trade duties on components, which can cross the Channel several times before a vehicle is assembled, would require costly supply-chain upheaval to avoid a compounding of duties."
General Motors,2017-2,Raw castings from mainland Europe are machined into engine blocks at BMW's Hams Hall plant near Birmingham. Many are then shipped to Germany and fitted into cars destined for the UK.
General Motors,2017-2,"In all, UK car plants purchase 59 percent of their components overseas, and two-thirds of those from the EU, the SMMT says. Even where cross-Channel supply chains stayed viable, border formalities would hurt delivery timings, raising warehousing costs and ultimately consumer prices."
General Motors,2017-2,"Locally made components would become more attractive for British-built cars, but the UK assembly plants could find it harder to win new vehicle programmes in the first place."
General Motors,2017-2,"Investing in an assembly line for the British market alone - rather than export - becomes viable only above an annual output of about 150,000 vehicles, industry experts explain."
General Motors,2017-2,"For many models, Exane BNP analyst Dominic O'Brien said, ""the UK market is not necessarily big enough to sustain its own dedicated plant."" Again, consumer choice and prices suffer."
General Motors,2017-2,"Some German carmakers have been more vocal in urging Britain to give ground, stressing attachment to their EU workers' freedom of movement."
General Motors,2017-2,"""Not only free trade but also cross-border employment opportunities ... are of proven benefit to business,"" BMW said."
General Motors,2017-2,"Still, huge unknowns remain, including French and German elections this year that could change the direction of Brexit."
General Motors,2017-2,Already there are some signs of dissent within the governing coalition between Merkel's conservative CDU and its Social Democrat SPD junior partner.
General Motors,2017-2,"Brexit should be used to spur EU reform, not deter would-be leavers, SPD Economy Minister Sigmar Gabriel said last week."
General Motors,2017-2,"""We should not purely focus on Brexit as a threat,"" he said. ""Should we reach a good result in negotiations with the UK, it could serve as an example for a Europe of different speeds."" ($1 = 0.8011 pounds)"
