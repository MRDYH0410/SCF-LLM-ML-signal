General Motors,2017-8,{{20170831T065851.998+0000}}UPDATE 2-Blow to S.Korean carmakers as Kia loses landmark wage dispute* Seoul court awards payout to Kia workers
General Motors,2017-8,* Kia says expects about 1 trln won in payout due to ruling
General Motors,2017-8,"SEOUL, Aug 31 (Reuters) - South Korea's Kia Motors <000270.KS> said it expects to pay about 1 trillion won ($887.11 million) in additional wages and would post a third-quarter operating loss after a court ruled in favour of workers in a landmark labour dispute on Thursday."
General Motors,2017-8,"Seoul Central District Court gave workers a major, if only partial, victory in their closely watched dispute with Kia, ordering the Hyundai Motor <005380.KS> affiliate to pay about 420 billion won in unpaid wages."
General Motors,2017-8,"But Kia said the additional labour costs arising from the ruling would be more than double that amount, once all its workers' wages were adjusted."
General Motors,2017-8,"The payout, though significantly less than the roughly 1 trillion won demanded by workers in the six-year legal battle, is a blow to South Korean automakers just as they are battling a sales slump in China amid regional strategic tensions."
General Motors,2017-8,"""The current operational situation is such that the ruling amount is hard to bear,"" Kia said in a statement, adding it would appeal immediately"
General Motors,2017-8,"Kia Motors shares fell 3.5 percent and Hyundai Motor was 1.8 percent lower after the ruling, while the wider market <.KS11> fell 0.4 percent."
General Motors,2017-8,A labour representative told reporters the court had vindicated workers in the face of Kia's argument that their demands amounted to an attack on Asia's fourth-biggest economy.
General Motors,2017-8,"""The ruling today confirmed that ... the union can aid the company's development,"" he said."
General Motors,2017-8,"The workers in their claim said regular bonuses should be included as part of a base pay used to calculate overtime, compensation for unused annual leave, severance pay and other payments."
General Motors,2017-8,The case goes back to an original claim in 2011 of 659 billion won in unpaid wages. With interest it came to more than 1 trillion won.
General Motors,2017-8,South Korea's car industry association warned the ruling could have far-reaching negative consequences for the sector if it sparked other wage claims.
General Motors,2017-8,"""As a company which outputs more than one-third of local producton, Kia Motors' wage conditions and operational crisis will spread to other automakers and suppliers, adding more pressure to the crisis in South Korea's auto industry,"" it said in a statement."
General Motors,2017-8,"Kia's second-quarter operating profit of 404 billion won was 48 percent down from last year and analysts were expecting the firm to beat that in the third quarter, according to forecasts made before Thursday's court ruling."

General Motors,2017-8,"FRANKFURT, Aug 28 (Reuters) - ChargePoint, operator of one of the world's largest charging station networks for electric cars, targets an initial public offering within the next five years, as it expands further into Europe, its chief executive told Reuters."
General Motors,2017-8,"Demand for electric cars depends on a network of charging points, which utilities, engineering groups, automakers and start-ups are vying to provide and control before the sector takes off."
General Motors,2017-8,"French utility Engie has bought Dutch firm EV-Box, Germany's Innogy is moving into the United States, and ChargePoint, with BMW , Daimler and Siemens among its owners, has entered Europe. [nNDL4CtpKb] [nL8N1JX4B5] [nL8N1IJ5J5]"
General Motors,2017-8,"Founded in 2007, Silicon Valley-based ChargePoint operates about 40,000 charging spots in the United States and Mexico. It sells the stations to service providers and hooks them up to its network that can be accessed via a smartphone app."
General Motors,2017-8,"It has so far raised nearly $300 million in funds, with Daimler and Siemens becoming investors this year. BMW first supplied funds in 2012, according to Crunchbase data."
General Motors,2017-8,"""We will probably look to be public within the next five years,"" Pasquale Romano said in an interview, adding the group was preparing to implement a reporting structure to comply with stock market requirements."
General Motors,2017-8,"""We'll be ready. But the conditions have to be right."""
General Motors,2017-8,"ChargePoint does not disclose its ownership structure, but Romano said that Daimler, BMW and Siemens together hold a significant stake. Its owners also include venture capital firms Linse Capital, Rho Capital Partners and Braemar Energy Ventures."
General Motors,2017-8,"Much of ChargePoint's hopes rest on its expansion in Europe, where the Volkswagen diesel scandal has raised awareness for the need to switch to electric vehicles."
General Motors,2017-8,"""Europe is starting with a stronger political mandate,"" Romano said, adding ChargePoint was hiring ""furiously"" in Germany, France, the Netherlands and Britain, where it struck a deal to sell fast chargers in May, its first in Europe."
General Motors,2017-8,"ChargePoint, whose board of directors include former General Motors Chief Executive Rick Wagoner, is aiming to spend the $125 million it raised in a recent funding round to expand on the continent."
General Motors,2017-8,"Europe, however, is also a highly fragmented market, with differing e-mobility legislation and support schemes across various countries, requiring a specific strategy and business model for almost every market."
General Motors,2017-8,"In addition, ChargePoint will face stiff competition on the continent, most notably from Engie's EV-Box, itself boasting more than 48,000 in installed charging points, as well as RWE's Innogy, with 5,800 charging points."
General Motors,2017-8,"According to its website, Tesla has 6,372 superchargers worldwide, which are slower than ChargePoint's most modern chargers."
General Motors,2017-8,"""The market will consolidate around three to four players and we hope to be one of them. That's how we look at it,"" Romano said, adding it was important to expand aggressively, possibly at the expense of immediate profitability."
General Motors,2017-8,One potential business target could be a car consortium - which includes Daimler and BMW - aiming to install 400 super-fast charging stations across Europe. [nL1N1DU18Q]
General Motors,2017-8,"""Of course, we can help that consortium with our technology,"" Romano said."

General Motors,2017-8,"Aug 27 (Reuters) - Days before Hurricane Harvey barreled into the Texas coast on Friday, home improvement retailers were preparing truckloads of lumber, shingles and other materials that property owners in the storm-raked communities will need to rebuild."
General Motors,2017-8,"The deliveries will have to wait, however, as 56 stores between Home Depot and Lowe's in southeast Texas remained closed as of Sunday amid widespread flooding. Once they reopen, the chains could be among the biggest beneficiaries of the post-storm recovery."
General Motors,2017-8,"Lowe's has sent ""500 truckloads"" of supplies to the storm zone, said spokeswoman Sarah Lively. ""We are reopening those stores as quickly as possible."""
General Motors,2017-8,"For the moment, the biggest storm to hit Texas in 50 years is posing a major disruption to one of the most important economic crossroads in the United States and the heart of its oil industry. Ports, railways and highways are closed or clogged, potentially blocking movement of key parts of the U.S. manufacturing supply chain."
General Motors,2017-8,"Catastrophic flooding triggered by now Tropical Storm Harvey inundated Houston on Sunday, forcing residents of the fourth most populous U.S. city to flee their homes in anticipation of more days of ""unprecedented"" rainfall. [nL2N1LD06K]"
General Motors,2017-8,"The home improvement retailers, well versed in the business of disaster, are likely steps ahead of most companies."
General Motors,2017-8,"At Home Depot, spokesman Matt Harrigan said preparations began ""as soon as the storm was on the radar."""
General Motors,2017-8,"Both Home Depot and Lowe's said they have set up command centers to manage the response. Both companies also said they will freeze prices for lumber, roofing and other rebuilding materials for a time in the affected zone."
General Motors,2017-8,"Other U.S. companies, including automakers, railroads and insurers, will likely be trying to send investors similar reassuring messages as trading starts on Monday."
General Motors,2017-8,"Texas is a significant vehicle market, particularly for highly profitable pickup trucks built by the big three Detroit automakers."
General Motors,2017-8,"In the short term, the storm will hamper operations at dealers and could dampen August sales. But longer term, ""it seems there has been enough flooding to damage thousands of light vehicles that will need replacing,"" said Nick Colas, an independent analyst based in New York City."

General Motors,2017-8,It was not clear on Sunday how the storm would affect supply chains for automakers and other manufacturers that depend on goods flowing to and from northern Mexico.
General Motors,2017-8,"Ford Motor Co , General Motors Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV said on Sunday they had thus far not seen any impact or issues with getting parts across the storm zone but were monitoring the storm closely. The area of Mexico south of the storm zone is a major center for auto parts manufacturing."

General Motors,2017-8,"Aug 27 (Reuters) - Tropical Storm Harvey is challenging a wide range of industries beyond energy, including insurers, home improvement retailers and automakers, but some sectors may benefit."
General Motors,2017-8,"The hurricane could weigh on energy stocks, be mixed for insurers and boost home improvement companies, analysts said on Sunday."
General Motors,2017-8,"Home improvement companies Lowe's and Home Depot have temporarily frozen prices for lumber and roofing materials at stores in the area affected by Tropical Storm Harvey, even as flooding has forced the chains to close dozens of stores, the companies said on Sunday."
General Motors,2017-8,Home Depot has so far announced the closure of 42 stores while Lowe's has closed 14 stores in Houston and the surrounding area.
General Motors,2017-8,"""Right now we have to play it by ear just to see what the conditions are going to be in those areas,"" said Sarah Lively, a spokeswoman for Lowe's. ""We are reopening those stores as quickly as possible."""
General Motors,2017-8,The companies are preparing for strong demand once the storm has passed and property owners can begin repairs. Both companies said building supplies had already been sent to nearby emergency response centers.
General Motors,2017-8,"Lively said Lowe's had already sent ""500 truckloads"" of supplies to the impacted area. At Home Depot, spokesman Matt Harrigan said preparations began ""as soon as the storm was on the radar."""
General Motors,2017-8,"Companies in other sectors are still assessing the impact of the storm, which washed over manufacturing supply lines and transportation routes that run from Mexico through southern Texas."
General Motors,2017-8,"Ford Motor Co , General Motors Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV said on Sunday they had thus far not seen any impact or issues with getting parts across the storm zone but were monitoring the storm closely.

General Motors,2017-8,"Union Pacific Corp , the No. 1 U.S. railroad, said late last week it would move rail cars in yards prone to flooding to high elevations and would curtail trains operating through areas likely to be hit by excessive winds and rain that will impact operations."

General Motors,2017-8,{{20170822T173656.818+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-Jeep sale would leave Marchionne nowhere to hide(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.)
General Motors,2017-8,"NEW YORK, Aug 22 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Selling Jeep would leave Sergio Marchionne nowhere to hide. The Fiat Chrysler Automobiles chief executive advocates using M&A to stop carmakers wasting precious capital. Offloading the company's top brand to China's Great Wall Motor <601633.SS>, whose president has indicated interest, could raise billions. But it would leave an emaciated rump."
General Motors,2017-8,"Great Wall's interest may stall in any event. With a market value of some $15 billion, it may struggle to secure financing or Beijing's approval for a deal larger than itself. Even if it succeeded, the Trump administration and the U.S. Congress are likely to balk at allowing such a large and iconic U.S. brand to end up in Chinese hands."
General Motors,2017-8,"Fiat Chrysler, though, does need to do something. It is already the earnings straggler among the major automakers. Its pre-tax margin last year, at 2.8 percent, was the lowest of the group; Ford Motor and General Motors both cranked out just over 7 percent."
General Motors,2017-8,"Things are improving as Marchionne shrugs off more of the debt that resulted in part from taking over Chrysler after the U.S. government-backed bankruptcy exit in 2009. But Fiat Chrysler is the only one of the top 12 that sell-side analysts reckon will fail to earn more than a 6 percent pre-tax margin in each of the next three years, according to Thomson Reuters data."
General Motors,2017-8,"The $23 billion a Jeep sale might bring, according to Morgan Stanley, could be tempting, whether Great Wall or another carmaker ends up the buyer. It would clean up the balance sheet. Deep-pocketed players like Google , Apple and Intel are new rivals in the race towards autonomous driving. Lacking investment firepower, Marchionne has stayed largely on the technological sidelines, though last week he took his company into the Intel-Mobileye-BMW alliance ."
General Motors,2017-8,"Yet handing the keys to Jeep to a new owner would combust even the modest earnings that are currently anticipated. The brand may account for almost three-quarters of EBITDA next year, reckons Morgan Stanley. Ram trucks, Maserati and three captive parts makers are still profitable, but Alfa Romeo, Dodge and Chrysler are in the red. On top of that, the company still has more than $5 billion of both net debt and unfunded pensions."
General Motors,2017-8,Marchionne is due to step down next year to concentrate on running Ferrari. A radical move like selling Jeep would certainly leave a mark. But it would set up his last lap at what remained of Fiat Chrysler to be a dismal one.
General Motors,2017-8,"- Chinese carmaker Great Wall Motor on Aug. 22 reiterated its potential interest in acquiring part or all of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, Reuters reported, echoing a public statement by Great Wall a day earlier. As yet China's largest maker of sport-utility vehicles has not held talks or signed any deal with executives at the Italian-American maker of Alfa Romeos, Ram trucks and Jeeps, according to the report."
General Motors,2017-8,"- Automotive News had initially reported the news, quoting Great Wall President Wang Fengying as saying she planned to contact FCA to discuss a deal for the Jeep brand."

General Motors,2017-8,"SHANGHAI, Aug 22 (Reuters) - Ford Motor is exploring setting up a joint venture with Chinese firm Anhui Zotye Automobile Co <000980.SZ> to build electric passenger vehicles in China under a new brand, tapping into a boom for such vehicles in the world's top auto market."
General Motors,2017-8,"China, struggling with alarming pollution levels in major cities, is aggressively pushing plug-in vehicles and has poured in tens of billions in investment, research funding and subsidies, drawing many new automakers to launch projects."
General Motors,2017-8,"Tesla , Daimler AG and General Motors are among firms that have already announced plans for making electric vehicles in China, which wants electric and plug-in hybrid cars to make up at least a fifth of the country's auto sales by 2025. [nL4N1HX1HS]"
General Motors,2017-8,"Ford, whose overall China sales are down 7 percent this year, said in a statement on Tuesday that it had signed a memorandum of understanding with Zotye Auto to build a new brand under which the electric vehicles will be sold. Both firms will hold a 50-50 stake in the JV, it said."
General Motors,2017-8,It did not provide details of financial commitments nor say by when it will take a firm decision on the JV.
General Motors,2017-8,"Ford sees China as the fastest growing market in the world for new energy vehicles (NEV) and forecasts that segment to grow to six million vehicles per year by 2025, of which approximately four million would be all-electric."
General Motors,2017-8,"The potential JV with Zotye Auto would represent a deepening of commitment to electric vehicles in China by Ford. In April, it outlined plans to offer by 2025 hybrid or fully electric versions of all models built in China with its domestic joint venture partner, Chongqing Changan Automobile Co Ltd <000625.SZ>. [nL3N1HR1V0]"
General Motors,2017-8,"However, it also said at the time that it would take a cautious approach to the market due to uncertainty about consumer interest and government policy."
General Motors,2017-8,"Zotye, which Ford described as the market leader in China's all-electric small vehicle segment, sold more than 16,000 all-electric vehicles this year through July, representing a year-on-year growth of 56 percent, it said."

General Motors,2017-8,"SHANGHAI/WASHINGTON, Aug 21 (Reuters) - A direct overture by Chinese automaker Great Wall Motor Co Ltd <601633.SS> to Italian-American automaker Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV sent FCA shares up sharply on Monday, as investors cheered the potential sale of the storied Jeep brand."
General Motors,2017-8,It was not immediately clear whether Great Wall Motor wanted all or part of FCA.
General Motors,2017-8,"Automotive News first reported earlier on Monday that Great Wall Motor's President, Wang Fengying, plans to contact FCA to discuss acquiring the Jeep brand."
General Motors,2017-8,"""With respect to this case, we currently have an intention to acquire. We are interested in (FCA),"" an official at Great Wall Motor's press relations department told Reuters. He declined to give his name and gave no further details."
General Motors,2017-8,Two people familiar with the matter said Great Wall Motor had asked for a meeting with FCA to make an offer for all or part of the group.
General Motors,2017-8,"FCA, which is incorporated in the Netherlands and based in London, said in a statement it had not been approached by Great Wall Motor, and was implementing its current business plan. Its main investor, Italy's Agnelli family, declined to comment."
General Motors,2017-8,FCA Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne has said that he wants to find a partner or buyer for the world's seventh-largest automaker as costs rise to comply with emissions regulations and develop technology for electric and self-driving cars.
General Motors,2017-8,"So far, however, Marchionne and company chairman John Elkann have not opened the door to selling Jeep or the profitable Ram truck business in North America as standalone units."
General Motors,2017-8,"If Marchionne is willing to sell Jeep on its own, other automakers like Volkswagen AG , General Motors Co or Ford Motor Co might show interest, analysts said."
General Motors,2017-8,"Jefferies said in a research note last week that a key question of a Chinese acquisition of some or all of Fiat Chrysler is the ""political feasibility of such a transaction given (automaker mergers and acquisition) is often held to a different standard in the current political environment."""
General Motors,2017-8,"But Jefferies noted ""Chrysler's background which has included multiple changes of ownership, including two foreign acquirers"" in two decades."
General Motors,2017-8,"Jeep targets sales of 2 million vehicles in 2018 worldwide, up from 1.4 million in 2016. Marchionne has said deliveries from the SUV brand could eventually rise to as many as 7 million a year."
General Motors,2017-8,"Great Wall Motor, China's largest sport utility vehicle (SUV) and pickup manufacturer, would be making an audacious move in taking on FCA, which has a market value of more $20 billion after a 48 percent runup this year."
General Motors,2017-8,"If Great Wall, with a market value of about $16 billion, bought FCA it would be China's largest overseas automotive industry deal to date - dwarfing Geely's <0175.HK> 2010 billion acquisition of Volvo cars."
General Motors,2017-8,"Fiat Chrysler's shares rose nearly 7 percent to close at $13.44 in New York on Monday, and also rose by the same percentage in Milan, the highest share price for Fiat in 19 years."
General Motors,2017-8,"A formal offer by Great Wall for Jeep would put in play a brand that was once a symbol of U.S. military power, and now epitomizes American myths of freedom and adventure, at a time of heightened trade friction between Washington and Beijing."
General Motors,2017-8,"Jeep became a flashpoint in the 2012 U.S. presidential election when then-Republican candidate Mitt Romney ran advertisements in Ohio claiming that FCA was considering moving production of Jeep models out of the state. Fiat Chrysler said Jeep production would not be moved to China from the United States, although the company did begin building Jeeps in China for the Chinese market."
General Motors,2017-8,"This year, U.S. government officials have intensified scrutiny of Chinese acquisitions of U.S. assets. [nL4N1L23PT]"
General Motors,2017-8,"It is not clear if a Chinese bid for FCA or Jeep would face scrutiny from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which reviews acquisitions by foreign entities for potential national security risks, experts said. Chinese companies have until now acquired a number large U.S. auto suppliers with little push-back."
General Motors,2017-8,"A test of the climate for Chinese auto deals could come with the proposed acquisition of Nissan Motor Co's <7201.T> electric battery business to Chinese investment firm GSR Capital. [nL4N1KV1A1] That deal, which includes a battery plant in Tennessee, will be voluntarily submitted for CFIUS approval, according to a person familiar with the matter."
General Motors,2017-8,"President Donald Trump has sharply criticized Chinese trade practices, but has also welcomed foreign investment. Last month, he hosted Taiwanese electronics manufacturer Foxconn, which announced plans to build a $10 billion plant in Wisconsin. [nL2N1L3137] [nL4N1L723N]"

General Motors,2017-8,"WOLFSBURG, Germany, Aug 21 (Reuters) - Volkswagen is more focused on its multi-billion-euro shift towards electric vehicles and transport services than any potential sale of motorcycle brand Ducati or transmissions maker Renk, its head of strategy told Reuters."
General Motors,2017-8,"Analysts and bankers have been expecting Europe's biggest carmaker to sell assets soon to help meet the cost of its diesel emissions test cheating scandal, which has already reached as much as $25 billion."

General Motors,2017-8,"""So it's perfectly plausible that we consider whether the time may have come to find a more suitable owner for certain business areas,"" said Sedran, a former head of General Motors in Europe who joined Volkswagen two months after the scandal broke."

General Motors,2017-8,"NEW YORK, Aug 17 (Reuters) - Lawyers for car owners suing General Motors Co over faulty ignition switches and other defects on Thursday accused the carmaker of meddling in settlement talks and having issued threats that led to the canceling of an agreement."
General Motors,2017-8,"Under a deal with a trust that holds many GM liabilities from before its 2009 bankruptcy, the automaker would have been forced to pay $1 billion in shares to resolve millions of claims."
General Motors,2017-8,"The claims stem from GM's 2014 recall of 2.6 million vehicles with defective ignition switches, including one linked to 124 deaths. They have since expanded to include millions of financial loss claims and hundreds of personal injury and wrongful death claims."
General Motors,2017-8,"The agreement, first disclosed at a court hearing last week, had been five months in the making and was confirmed, a plaintiff lawyer, Edward Weisfelner, told a New York bankruptcy court on Thursday."
General Motors,2017-8,"Representatives of the trust had not yet signed the deal, but Weisfelner said he still considered the agreement enforceable."
General Motors,2017-8,"But after a meeting with GM on Tuesday, the trust suddenly reversed course and in a court filing on Wednesday said it had accepted GM's offer to help pay for the trust to defend against the car owners' claims in exchange for dropping the agreement."
General Motors,2017-8,"""We uphold, but have no reason to know this for a fact, that the trust's about-face was the subject of...some very direct, very serious threats issued either by GM or GM's professionals,"" Weisfelner said."
General Motors,2017-8,"Lawyers for GM and the trust, who were also present in court, rejected the allegations."
General Motors,2017-8,"""I was at that meeting. The concept that there were any untoward threats or anything illicit...it just did not happen,"" said Keith Martorana, an attorney for the trust."
General Motors,2017-8,"GM's lawyer, Arthur Steinberg, said he did not consider the previous agreement between the trust and the plaintiffs to be binding because it had not been signed."
General Motors,2017-8,Bankruptcy judge Martin Glenn said he had to take allegations over threats seriously and ordered both sides to agree on a discovery process to unearth the details of the discussions that led to the agreements.
General Motors,2017-8,He also said he would not approve any of the settlements before the parties briefed him on how they would go about obtaining evidence.
General Motors,2017-8,"""Anybody who negotiates a settlement with you better be careful as you might pull the rug out from underneath them after months of negotiations,"" the judge told Martorana."
General Motors,2017-8,GM said in a statement that it was optimistic its agreement would gain the upper hand.
General Motors,2017-8,"""The judge has outlined a process to begin to resolve the issues raised. We will follow the process, and we look forward to the eventual approval of our settlement agreement,"" it said."
General Motors,2017-8,The original settlement would have called for the trust to accept $10 billion in claims to resolve about 11.9 million allegations over economic loss and between 400 and 500 personal injury and wrongful death claims.
General Motors,2017-8,"About 2.4 million claims, involving vehicles sold after GM's bankruptcy, would have remained pending in another court."

General Motors,2017-8,"WASHINGTON, Aug 17 (Reuters) - Auto industry groups from Canada, Mexico and the United States are pushing back against the Trump administration's demand for higher U.S. automotive content in a modernized North American Free Trade Agreement."
General Motors,2017-8,"At talks underway this week in Washington, automaker and parts groups from all three countries were urging negotiators against tighter rules of origin, said Eduardo Solis, president of the Mexican Automotive Industry Association."
General Motors,2017-8,But U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer confirmed the industry's fears that the administration of President Donald Trump was seeking major changes to these rules to try to reduce the U.S. trade deficit with Mexico.
General Motors,2017-8,"""Rules of origin, particularly on autos and auto parts, must require higher NAFTA content and substantial U.S. content. Country of origin should be verified, not 'deemed,'"" Lighthizer said on Wednesday in opening remarks."
General Motors,2017-8,Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo and Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland both said they were not in favor of specific national rules of origin within NAFTA - a position that the industry agrees with.
General Motors,2017-8,"""We certainly think a U.S.-specific requirement would greatly complicate the ability of companies, particularly small- and medium-size enterprises, to take advantage of the benefits of NAFTA,"" said Matt Blunt, president of the American Automotive Policy Council. The trade group represents Detroit automakers General Motors Co Ford Motor Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles ."
General Motors,2017-8,"His comments were echoed by Flavio Volpe, president of Canada's Automotive Parts Manufacturers Association."
General Motors,2017-8,"""Anytime you say this list or a part of this list has to come from one specific country you're going to hurt all three countries,"" he said."
General Motors,2017-8,"The United States had an autos and auto parts trade deficits of $74 billion with Mexico and $5.6 billion with Canada, both major components of overall U.S. goods trade deficits with its North American neighbors -- deficits that Lighthizer said could no longer continue."
General Motors,2017-8,"Lighthizer's mention of tightening verification requirements is a reference to expanding the parts tracing list, which is used to determine whether companies meet the 62.5 percent North American content requirement for autos and 60 percent for components."
General Motors,2017-8,"Devised in the early 1990s, the tracing list covers almost none of the sophisticated electronics found in today's cars and trucks, most of which come from Asia. Putting these on the tracing list could force suppliers to source these components from North America or pay tariffs on them. [nL1N1KW22J]"
General Motors,2017-8,Volpe said any changes to this must also capture the North American system design work and software content for these components that is not currently included.
General Motors,2017-8,"""A car today probably has 25 to 30 percent advanced electronics, software content in it. In 1994, it had zero or 1 percent,"" Volpe said. ""Could you address the tracing to help you get to NAFTA compliance level by capturing some of the work that's being done in Silicon Valley or Waterloo, Canada? Yes."""
General Motors,2017-8,"John Bozzella CEO of the Association of Global Automakers, which represents international-brand carmakers, said NAFTA has allowed a major expansion of auto exports, with more than 1 million more vehicles built annually in the United States than in 1993."
General Motors,2017-8,"""Negotiators should be mindful of this success as they work to modernize the agreement,"" Bozzella said, whose organization represents international brand carmakers with U.S. plants, including Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T>, Honda Motor Co Ltd <7267.T> and BMW ."

General Motors,2017-8,"The settlement, first disclosed at a court hearing last week, would have called for the trust to accept $10 billion in claims, triggering a provision in GM's bankruptcy plan that could have forced it to pay $1 billion in stock to the trust to pay off the plaintiffs."
General Motors,2017-8,"Lawyers for the plaintiffs said in a court filing late on Wednesday they had learned of the ""astonishing and improper"" decision to jettison the settlement the day before a scheduled court hearing on the matter."
General Motors,2017-8,"""Game isn't over,"" Steve Berman, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said in an email on Thursday. ""We had a deal, GM has knowingly interfered with our deal and we intend to take action against GM on various fronts."""
General Motors,2017-8,He said the plaintiffs could bring a legal action against GM for interfering with the agreement and seek to seize the trust's assets.
General Motors,2017-8,"According to a letter filed earlier on Wednesday by the trust and GM, the trust decided to drop the settlement after GM agreed to help pay for the trust to defend against the plaintiffs' claims."

General Motors,2017-8,Aug 16 (Reuters) - General Motors Co's Maven car sharing and rental unit is expanding its partnerships in ride and delivery services as parent GM considers whether to enter the on-demand mobility business now dominated by Uber Technologies and Lyft Inc.
General Motors,2017-8,"The trick will be not to alienate the two ride services startups, whose drivers are leasing thousands of GM vehicles."
General Motors,2017-8,"Maven already has begun to pull away from Lyft, in which GM holds a 9 percent stake, with its own Gig leasing business, officials said. Through Gig, Maven can provide GM vehicles directly to ride-sharing drivers who previously leased them through Lyft Express Drive and Uber Vehicle Solutions."

This could enable GM to eventually offer on-demand mobility services, similar to those provided by Uber and Lyft, to a new generation of consumers who buy access to transportation by the hour."
General Motors,2017-8,"Like other automakers keen to address the sharing economy, GM through Maven is testing a variety of on-demand services, from peer-to-peer car sharing to fractional ownership.

General Motors,2017-8,"More than any other industry, autos have been the focus of U.S. President Donald Trump's anger over the North American Free Trade Agreement, which he blames for taking car factories and jobs away from the United States to low-wage Mexico."
General Motors,2017-8,"The U.S. trade deficit with Mexico in autos and auto parts reached $74 billion last year, the dominant component of an overall $64 billion U.S. deficit, according to Census Bureau data."
General Motors,2017-8,"""The Trump administration has framed their NAFTA negotiating objectives around reducing the trade deficit with Mexico,"" said Caroline Freund, a senior trade fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. ""If they don't touch autos, there's no way of getting at what they want."""
General Motors,2017-8,"Among tools that U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer may seek to boost U.S. auto employment is strengthening the rules of origin to shut out more parts from Asia, and possibly an unprecedented U.S.-specific content requirement for Mexican vehicles."
General Motors,2017-8,"Lighthizer's negotiating objectives for NAFTA seek to ""ensure the rules of origin incentivize the sourcing of goods and materials from the United States and North America,"" which has raised concerns among auto industry executives and trade groups that he will seek a deal that guarantees a certain percentage of production for the United States."
General Motors,2017-8,The industry is opposed to such a carve-out or to increasing the percentage of a vehicle's value that must come from the region above the current 62.5 percent - already the highest of any global trade bloc.
General Motors,2017-8,"It says this would raise costs and disrupt a complex supply chain in which parts crisscross NAFTA borders, making North American car production competitive with Asia and Europe."
General Motors,2017-8,"""Our members feel very strongly that rules of origin are not the tools to use to reshore jobs into the U.S.,"" said Ann Wilson, senior vice president of government affairs for the Motor and Equipment Manufacturers Association, a trade group representing auto parts makers."
General Motors,2017-8,Wilson and other industry advocates say a better way to boost U.S. manufacturing jobs is through policies aimed at expanding vehicle exports.
General Motors,2017-8,"The issue is also sensitive in Canada, another major NAFTA auto producing center. Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland on Monday said she was prepared to discuss ""some strengthening of the rules of origin"" but made no commitments."
General Motors,2017-8,"""We are also extremely mindful of the possibility that any changes... could have unintended consequences,"" she told reporters in Ottawa.[nL2N1L000M]"
General Motors,2017-8,"If U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross gets his way, it would be harder to reach the 62.5 percent content threshold because the ""tracing list"" of parts that count toward that goal would be modernized. He argues that current rules are too loose and allow a tariff-free ""back door"" for Chinese auto parts."
General Motors,2017-8,"Parts that did not exist when the 300-plus-page list was devised in the early 1990s - largely electronics sourced from Asia such as console touch screens or hybrid-drive controllers - do not count against reaching the threshold. If they are put on the list, companies would have to source them from North America or pay tariffs."
General Motors,2017-8,"If the content requirements become too onerous, automakers will simply skip compliance ""and they'll just end up paying the duty,"" said Charles Uthus, vice president for international policy at the American Automotive Policy Council, a lobbying group for Ford Motor Co. , General Motors and Fiat Chrysler ."
General Motors,2017-8,"Foregoing all NAFTA tariff-free access benefits - which could happen if Trump is dissatisfied with the negotiations and decides to scrap the trade pact - would raise costs by about $4 billion-$5 billion a year, Ulthus added. Ford plans about $7 billion in total capital spending this year."
General Motors,2017-8,"Among the other contentious NAFTA issues that U.S., Canadian and Mexican negotiators will tackle starting on Wednesday in Washington is the future of a mechanism for resolving trade disputes."
General Motors,2017-8,"The United States wants to eliminate a so-called ""Chapter 19"" provision, arguing that it fails to combat unfair subsidies of some Mexican and Canadian goods. Mexico and Canada have vowed to keep the provision."
General Motors,2017-8,"U.S. negotiators will also seek a provision to deter currency manipulation, aiming to set a precedent for future trade negotiations, such as a revised U.S.-North Korean deal or a bilateral pact with Japan."
General Motors,2017-8,"The negotiations face a tight timeline, with officials saying they want to finish by early next year to avoid ratification difficulties posed by elections in Mexico in July 2018 and in the United States in November 2018."
General Motors,2017-8,"Freund said the negotiators should focus on a few key areas, given that a comprehensive update of NAFTA would take a lot more than six months."
General Motors,2017-8,"""Ultimately I think they're going to get bogged down in all these details and pick two to three things and have a smaller agenda,"" she said."

General Motors,2017-8,"MONTREAL, Aug 11 (Reuters) - Canadians are making smaller payments more frequently on auto term loans as new financing offers lure buyers away from the typical monthly billing cycle, a trend public advocacy groups say could push consumers to purchase more expensive vehicles that they simply cannot afford."
General Motors,2017-8,"""Because long-term car loans tend to involve lower monthly or bi-weekly payments, extended terms can encourage consumers to buy more car than they may be able to afford,"" said Kathryn Dunn, a spokeswoman for the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada"
General Motors,2017-8,"This new financing trend has made it easier for consumers to pile on debt, further extending already over-leveraged households."
General Motors,2017-8,"According to Statistics Canada, households have amassed huge debt, with the ratio of debt to disposable income at a near record of 166.9 percent during the first quarter of 2017."
General Motors,2017-8,"The increase comes at a time when the Bank of Canada is likely to raise interest rates again this year, after the first interest rate hike in seven years in July. [nL1N1K508A]"
General Motors,2017-8,"More than half of Canadians who borrow to buy new vehicles look to make payments every two weeks, with the arrival of their paychecks, said Robert Karwel, a senior manager for J.D. Power in Canada."
General Motors,2017-8,"Some borrowers are opting to pay even more frequently with four percent making payments each week during the first half of 2017, up from 3.4 percent in 2015, the J.D. Power data show. ""These terms don't allow you to pay off the car any faster, so it's questionable why it is being taken-up by customers,"" Karwel said. ""We feel it has to do with the amount of stress the family budget is under."""
General Motors,2017-8,"Still, delinquency rates on Canada's C$120 billion ($94.7 billion) in auto loans remained low at 1.7 percent during the first quarter of 2017, relatively flat from the same period a year ago, according to June data from credit information company TransUnion."

General Motors,2017-8,"SHANGHAI, Aug 14 (Reuters) - Trade tensions between Washington and Beijing may be running high but Corporate America is finding China to be a reliable source of profit growth this year."
General Motors,2017-8,"Whether they sell construction equipment, semiconductors or coffee, many major U.S. companies have reported stronger second-quarter earnings and revenue from their Chinese operations in recent weeks."
General Motors,2017-8,"They are benefiting from a Chinese economy that is growing at almost 7 percent, several times the rate of U.S. expansion, a Chinese housing boom, and a slide in the U.S. dollar, which makes American exports more competitive and increases dollar earnings once they are translated from foreign currencies."
General Motors,2017-8,"Caterpillar Inc , a bellwether for industrial demand in China and beyond, reported its sales in Asia-Pacific rose 25 percent in the second quarter - thanks to China. Shipments of large excavators to Chinese customers more than doubled in the first half of the year."
General Motors,2017-8,"""We now expect demand in China to remain strong through the rest of the year,"" Brad Halverson, Caterpillar's group president and chief financial officer, told investors."
General Motors,2017-8,Caterpillar's Japanese rivals Komatsu <6301.T> and Hitachi Construction Machinery Co <6305.T> reported similar strength in demand for heavy machinery. Komatsu's China sales almost doubled in the firm's April-June quarter. [nL3N1KJ2EP]
General Motors,2017-8,"""China's grown pretty well relative to the U.S. over this period and the currency's relationship has changed in favor of the U.S. companies,"" said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at the Leuthold Group in Minneapolis."
General Motors,2017-8,"Chinese companies are also benefiting from the robust domestic economy. For example, Chinese auto manufacturer Geely Automobile Holdings <0175.HK> announcing last week that its July sales climbed 89 percent from the year-earlier-month. Geely and many other major Chinese companies report their results in the next few weeks."
General Motors,2017-8,American companies in China have been collectively reporting better prospects even as they complain that the Chinese authorities are not allowing them enough access to parts of the Chinese market and discriminating against them as they seek to compete against Chinese rivals.
General Motors,2017-8,U.S. President Donald Trump's administration has been considering punitive tariffs against a range of Chinese goods but it has held off on taking action after Beijing backed tougher United Nations Security Council sanctions against North Korea earlier this month.
General Motors,2017-8,"However, senior U.S. officials said over the weekend that Trump on Monday will order his top trade adviser to determine whether to investigate Chinese trade practices that force U.S. firms operating in China to turn over intellectual property. The move could eventually lead to steep tariffs on Chinese goods."
General Motors,2017-8,"And despite some negatives in the Sino-U.S. relationship, a July report by the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai showed that 82 percent of U.S. companies in China expect revenues to increase this year, up from 76 percent a year ago."
General Motors,2017-8,"""In general China is still a growth market for lots of US goods and services... the Chinese consumer is driving more and more the growth in China itself - that's a very positive shift in compositional growth for a lot of U.S. companies that do provide goods and services for consumers, as opposed to building skyscrapers,"" said Joe Quinlan, head of thematic investing at Bank of America, U.S. Trust."
General Motors,2017-8,"In the chip industry, Skywork Solutions , which gets around two thirds of its revenue from China, said last month that China remained a strong growth story for the company."
General Motors,2017-8,And many other foreign companies are also doing well. The European liquor industry is benefiting from a resurgence in Chinese consumer demand.
General Motors,2017-8,"""We see the fast-growing upper middle class driving strong consumption growth for our upmarket cognac brands,"" the company's Chief Financial Officer Luca Marotta said last month."
General Motors,2017-8,"Closer to home, Kweichow Moutai <600519.SS>, the Chinese maker of the liquor baijiu and the world's largest alcohol firm by value, saw first half profits gain 27.8 percent."
General Motors,2017-8,Chinese stock market gains this year have in turn helped confidence among retail investors.
General Motors,2017-8,"""I feel the wider economy is improving,"" said Ding Mingwei, 26, a manager at an education technology company in Shanghai."
General Motors,2017-8,"Ding, who says his own investments are up this year, now plans to spend more on hotels, dining out and funding hobbies such as playing the guitar."
General Motors,2017-8,"For some companies, China growth helped to offset problems elsewhere. Starbucks U.S. growth cooled in the third quarter but same-store sales for the coffee chain in China surged 7 percent."
General Motors,2017-8,"Among the Japanese companies to benefit, Sony's <6758.T> sales in China were up just under 50 percent in the three months to June, making it the electronic group's fastest-growing geographic segment."
General Motors,2017-8,There are some sectors that are proving a tougher slog for foreign companies.
General Motors,2017-8,"Major international automakers, even those reporting increased revenues, have pointed to squeezed margins in one of the world's most competitive markets. U.S. automaker General Motors , for example, saw a strong April-June quarter, but said it faced ""pricing challenges""."
General Motors,2017-8,And some economists warn that it is unclear how long the Chinese economy and the markets can keep their buzz.
General Motors,2017-8,"""The strong rebound is largely being driven by the property market and export growth, which both seem unsustainable,"" said Nomura Chief China Economist Yang Zhao in Hong Kong. He said he expects China's economic growth to cool by the fourth quarter."

General Motors,2017-8,"HONG KONG, Aug 14 (Reuters Breakingviews) - If Chinese officials are looking for a painless concession to make to an irritated Donald Trump, they might consider their automotive joint venture requirement. The rule forces foreign carmakers to partner with local brands and turn over intellectual property in exchange for market access. The policy, however, has done as much harm as good for local companies. Ditching it might open doors abroad to export the next generation of Chinese designs."
General Motors,2017-8,"Frustrated with China's perceived intransigence on North Korea and economic issues, the U.S. president is planning to initiate an investigation into Beijing's tech transfer policy, a long-standing bother. China's high-speed rail and nuclear power industries are examples of where foreign expertise has been leveraged successfully to develop local champions, which are now competing overseas."
General Motors,2017-8,"At the same time, the domestic partners have failed to make inroads abroad. China still runs a vehicular trade deficit, the auto group's data shows, despite onerous tariffs on imports. Apart from commercial vehicles, Chinese brands are largely unknown overseas."
General Motors,2017-8,"With growth slowing at home, such companies want to expand overseas. The last thing they need is a trade war with the United States or Europe. Of all China's protectionist policies, this would be a relatively easy one to abandon."
General Motors,2017-8,"- President Donald Trump will order his top trade adviser to determine whether to investigate Chinese trade practices that force U.S. firms operating in China to turn over intellectual property, Reuters reported on Aug. 12, citing senior administration officials."
General Motors,2017-8,"- Cumulative domestic sales of Chinese-brand passenger cars reached nearly 5 million units in the first half, comprising 43.9 percent of total sales inside the country, according to data released in July by the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers. The organization predicts overall vehicle sales will rise 5 percent this year, slowing from 13.7 percent in 2016."

General Motors,2017-8,"""I feel the wider economy is improving,"" said Ding Mingwei, 26, a manager at an education technology company in Shanghai."
General Motors,2017-8,"Ding, who says his own investments are up this year, now plans to spend more on hotels, dining out and funding hobbies such as playing the guitar."
General Motors,2017-8,"For some companies, China growth helped to offset problems elsewhere. Starbucks U.S. growth cooled in the third quarter but same-store sales for the coffee chain in China surged 7 percent."

General Motors,2017-8,There are some sectors that are proving a tougher slog for foreign companies.
General Motors,2017-8,"Major international automakers, even those reporting increased revenues, have pointed to squeezed margins in one of the world's most competitive markets. U.S. automaker General Motors , for example, saw a strong April-June quarter, but said it faced ""pricing challenges""."
General Motors,2017-8,And some economists warn that it is unclear how long the Chinese economy and the markets can keep their buzz.

General Motors,2017-8,"{{20170811T232243.775+0000}}Canadians shift to smaller, more frequent, auto loans repayments By Allison Lampert"
General Motors,2017-8,"MONTREAL, Aug 11 (Reuters) - Canadians are making smaller payments more frequently on auto term loans as new financing offers lure buyers away from the typical monthly billing cycle, a trend public advocacy groups say could push consumers to purchase more expensive vehicles that they simply cannot afford."
General Motors,2017-8,"""Because long-term car loans tend to involve lower monthly or bi-weekly payments, extended terms can encourage consumers to buy more car than they may be able to afford,"" said Kathryn Dunn, a spokeswoman for the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada"
General Motors,2017-8,"This new financing trend has made it easier for consumers to pile on debt, further extending already over-leveraged households."
General Motors,2017-8,"According to Statistics Canada, households have amassed huge debt, with the ratio of debt to disposable income at a near record of 166.9 percent during the first quarter of 2017."
General Motors,2017-8,"The increase comes at a time when the Bank of Canada is likely to raise interest rates again this year, after the first interest rate hike in seven years in July. [nL1N1K508A]"
General Motors,2017-8,"More than half of Canadians who borrow to buy new vehicles look to make payments every two weeks, with the arrival of their paychecks, said Robert Karwel, a senior manager for J.D. Power in Canada."
General Motors,2017-8,"Some borrowers are opting to pay even more frequently with four percent making payments each week during the first half of 2017, up from 3.4 percent in 2015, the J.D. Power data show. ""These terms don't allow you to pay off the car any faster, so it's questionable why it is being taken-up by customers,"" Karwel said. ""We feel it has to do with the amount of stress the family budget is under."""
General Motors,2017-8,"Still, delinquency rates on Canada's C$120 billion ($94.7 billion) in auto loans remained low at 1.7 percent during the first quarter of 2017, relatively flat from the same period a year ago, according to June data from credit information company TransUnion."

General Motors,2017-8,"{{20170811T190311.578+0000}}GM blasts $1 bln deal between ignition switch plaintiffs, creditor trustBy Brendan Pierson"
General Motors,2017-8,"Aug 11 (Reuters) - Plaintiffs suing General Motors Co over faulty ignition switches and other alleged vehicle defects have reached a $1 billion settlement requiring the automaker to turn over that amount of stock, a lawyer for the plaintiffs said in a court hearing on Friday."
General Motors,2017-8,"GM lawyer Richard Godfrey strongly criticized the agreement, telling U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman in Manhattan the Detroit-based company was given no say in the deal negotiated between the plaintiffs and a trust set up for creditors of ""old GM,"" which holds many liabilities predating the automaker's 2009 bankruptcy."
General Motors,2017-8,"Godfrey said the settlement was a result of collusion between the plaintiffs and the trust, and ""a complete surrender and sellout using new GM's money."""
General Motors,2017-8,The ignition switch litigation consolidated before Furman stems from GM's 2014 recall of 2.6 million vehicles with defective switches. One type of switch has been linked to nearly 400 injuries and 124 deaths. The claims have expanded to include a variety of alleged defects in millions of cars.
General Motors,2017-8,"GM said in a statement it would fight the settlement in court, calling it a ""contrived scheme"" doomed to fail."
General Motors,2017-8,"According to Steve Berman, the plaintiffs' lawyer, the settlement called for the trust to take on $10 billion of ignition switch claims, which would boost the total claims against the trust to more than $35 billion."
General Motors,2017-8,"He said that would trigger a provision in GM's bankruptcy reorganization plan requiring ""new GM"" to transfer about $1 billion in stock to the trust, which would be used to fund the settlement."
General Motors,2017-8,"In a phone interview after the hearing, Berman said the settlement would resolve about 11.9 million economic loss claims and between 400 and 500 personal injury and wrongful death claims. He added that he expected to ask the federal bankruptcy court in Manhattan by Tuesday to set the deal in motion."
General Motors,2017-8,"About 2.4 million claims, involving vehicles sold after GM's bankruptcy, would remain, Berman said."
General Motors,2017-8,"""The notion from new GM that this is somehow an inappropriate procedure is crazy,"" he said. ""They bargained for this."""
General Motors,2017-8,"Godfrey told the hearing the trust had $400 million in its own assets that could be used to fund a settlement, instead of requiring GM to turn over stock."
General Motors,2017-8,"After the hearing, GM spokesman Patrick Morrissey said the automaker had been told the deal would include a $15 million payment from the trust releasing it from liability, effectively shielding that $400 million. That was not discussed at the hearing, and Berman declined to comment."

General Motors,2017-8,"BERLIN, Aug 10 (Reuters) - Cooperation talks between Germany's Volkswagen Group and India's Tata Motors about joint development of a car for emerging markets have ended amicably, the two companies said on Thursday."
General Motors,2017-8,"The collapse of the talks is a further blow to Volkswagen's (VW) efforts to develop a cheap vehicle platform for Asian markets, after an earlier alliance with Japan's Suzuki Motor Corp <7269.T> also fell apart."
General Motors,2017-8,In March Tata Motors and VW announced a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for a long-term partnership to explore joint development of products for customers in India and other markets.
General Motors,2017-8,"The German group's Czech arm Skoda, commissioned by VW to lead the talks with Tata, was exploring a possible entry-level car platform together with the Indian manufacturer, using Tata's AMP vehicle platform as a basis, a VW group source said."
General Motors,2017-8,"Skoda dropped the idea of developing the AMP platform on fears that it would need significant further investment to meet future crash-test and engine emissions requirements and would instead explore parent VW's MQB platform for possible further savings, said the source, who declined to be named."
General Motors,2017-8,"""The two companies have come to the conclusion that at the present point of time the technical and economic synergies cannot be realized in the desired way,"" Skoda said on Thursday, confirming a Reuters story. [nL5N1KW2UC]"
General Motors,2017-8,"""We have evaluated the technical feasibility and degree of synergies for the envisioned partnership. We have concluded that the strategic benefits for both parties are below the threshold levels,"" said Tata Motors Chief Executive Guenter Butschek, the German automotive and aerospace industry veteran who joined the Indian company last year."
General Motors,2017-8,"But the two automakers, which also studied joint development of components, did not rule out the possibility of collaboration in the future after holding what Skoda called ""constructive talks"" over the past five months."
General Motors,2017-8,"VW shares closed 0.7 percent lower at 127.15 euros. Tata Motors shares plunged 9 percent to 380.20 rupees, after the company reported lower than expected first-quarter results."
General Motors,2017-8,"Foreign carmakers like VW, General Motors and Fiat Chrysler have struggled in India where more nimble rivals such as Maruti Suzuki and Hyundai Motor <005380.KS> have cornered two thirds of the market."
General Motors,2017-8,"Tata, which is also struggling to boost sales, has been trying to turn round its loss-making domestic business by modernising its products, improving efficiency and streamlining its organisation. [nL4N1FN2SJ]"
General Motors,2017-8,"In May, General Motors said it would stop selling cars in India from the end of this year, drawing a line under two decades of battling in one of the world's most competitive markets where small cars make up the bulk of sales. [nL4N1IK1ZS]"
General Motors,2017-8,India is expected to become the world's third-largest car market by 2020 but passenger vehicle sales have slowed in recent months due to policy changes and a new nationwide sales tax.
General Motors,2017-8,In 2009 VW attempted to break into the low-cost car market in India by forging a tie-up with Suzuki Motor Corp but the deal failed due to cultural and business differences and was ended in 2015 following a fierce legal dispute.
General Motors,2017-8,The German group is looking for new overseas markets as it struggles to draw a line under its emissions scandal. In China VW has been working with joint venture partner FAW on an economy car and is planning to build affordable electric vehicles with JAC Motor <600418.SS> from next year.
General Motors,2017-8,"""We haven't been able yet to claim a share of the booming business with cheap small cars and Tata means another setback in that respect,"" a senior VW brand manager told Reuters. ""But VW has changed a lot structurally since the Suzuki debacle, so we'll keep trying."""
General Motors,2017-8,"The breakdown of talks with Tata was mainly for economic reasons rather than differences over control, as the AMP architecture turned out to be too expensive, the VW source said."
General Motors,2017-8,"A push by VW group headquarters to decentralize power after the dieselgate scandal and assign greater responsibilities to the individual brands and business regions for vehicles and technology will help VW find the right partner, the manager said, without being more specific."

General Motors,2017-8,"{{20170810T143448.397+0000}}FACTBOX-Germany, carmakers agree steps to cut diesel pollution(Updates with details on Opel in paragraph 8)"
General Motors,2017-8,"Aug 10 (Reuters) - German ministers, regional politicians and car executives have agreed a package of measures aimed at cutting inner-city air pollution and averting bans on diesel cars. [nL5N1KO14A]"
General Motors,2017-8,Following are some of the key points of the agreement:
General Motors,2017-8,"As a way to take older, polluting cars off the road, carmakers have agreed to offer trade-in deals for older diesel cars if customers then switch to newer, cleaner models."
General Motors,2017-8,"Ford announced it will pay owners of vehicles with Euro-1, Euro-2 or Euro-3 emission-standard engines a bonus of between 2,000 and 8,000 euros ($2,348 to $9,394) if they trade in their old cars by end of 2017."
General Motors,2017-8,"Mercedes-Benz said it would offer customers in Europe up to 2,000 euros for trading in older diesels equipped with engines built to meet the Euro-1 to Euro-4 emissions standards in exchange for a newer Mercedes. A trade-in discount of 1,000 euros will be offered to customers buying an electric Smart car."
General Motors,2017-8,"Volkswagen said it would offer trade-in discounts of between 2,000 and 10,000 euros for its own-brand cars, depending on the vehicle. For older diesel versions of the VW Golf, a 5,000 euro incentive is being offered."
General Motors,2017-8,"VW's premium devision Audi said it would offer between 3,000 and 10,000 euros to trade in cars with Euro-4 engines for newer cars, while sister brand Porsche said it would offer up to 5,000 euros."
General Motors,2017-8,"VW's Seat brand will offer trade-in discounts of between 1,750 euros and 8,000 euros depending on the model."
General Motors,2017-8,"Opel said it would offer customers between 1,750 and 7,000 euros for trade-ins of cars with Euro-1 to Euro-4 engines, for a newer Opel."
General Motors,2017-8,"German carmakers have committed to updating engine management software to make emissions filtering systems operate more effectively. Carmakers had previously made liberal use of a ""thermal window"" loophole which allowed carmakers to throttle back exhaust emissions management systems in cold weather conditions."
General Motors,2017-8,"The move will affect 5.3 million cars at a cost of around 500 million euros, with the measures to be funded solely by industry. That includes 2.5 million VW cars that have already been recalled for software updates. The government said the software changes would cut the nitrogen oxide emissions of the affected cars by 30 percent by the end of 2018."
General Motors,2017-8,"However, environmental group DUH and a Stuttgart regional court have dismissed software updates as being inadequate solutions for tackling pollution. DUH has called the agreement ""a grandiose failure"", and said it would reduce nitrogen oxide missions by only 2 to 3 percent overall, since it affected less than 20 percent of Germany's 15 million diesel cars. The group said it would continue lawsuits in 16 cities."
General Motors,2017-8,"Environment minister Barbara Hendricks, from the centre-left SPD, said voluntary software updates can only be a first step, with a more thorough technical update of cars needed to avoid bans in the longer run. [nL5N1KJ2XB]"
General Motors,2017-8,The government will continue discussions with carmakers on the possible need for more fundamental retrofits - including the addition of extra exhaust-cleaning systems. Such measures are much more expensive than software updates - with the potential costs estimated by analysts as high as 10 billion euros.
General Motors,2017-8,"Germany's KBA vehicle certification authority, which has faced criticism it is not sufficiently independent, will tighten controls of emissions, introducing spot tests of vehicles that have already been approved. The measures were announced when the transport ministry published a report on VW last month."
General Motors,2017-8,"The agreement does not include a proposal to divide control of certification and emissions testing on the streets, which had been sought by the environment minister."
General Motors,2017-8,"The auto sector and the government will each contribute half to a 500 million euro fund aimed at helping local governments reduce pollution, including introducing systems to improve traffic flows and improve public transport. [nFWN1KI106]"
General Motors,2017-8,"Support for electric buses increased to 100 million euros a year, plus extra backing for hybrid and natural gas buses. Financial incentives to help municipalities and taxi operators fund a switch to electric vehicles are being put in place."
General Motors,2017-8,"Goal for next legislative period is to create a nationwide network of 50,000 charging points for electric vehicles as well as changes planned to property law to make it easier to install charging points in private buildings."
General Motors,2017-8,Support will be provided for trains powered by hydrogen and fuel cells as well as more cash for cycle paths. ($1 = 0.8516 euros)

General Motors,2017-8,"WASHINGTON, Aug 8 (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Justice on Tuesday asked a federal judge to dismiss a criminal charge against Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T> after the Japanese automaker completed three years of monitoring as part of a $1.2 billion settlement over claims of sudden unintended acceleration in its vehicles."
General Motors,2017-8,"The request, filed in federal court in Manhattan, should bring to an end Toyota's legal woes stemming from its admission that it misled U.S. consumers by concealing and making deceptive statements about the extent of sudden acceleration problems in 2009 and 2010."
General Motors,2017-8,"In 2014, the world's second-largest automaker paid what was then a record fine for a car company to settle the case and reached a deferred prosecution agreement with the Justice Department. That agreement included three years of oversight by an independent monitor, which ended on Monday."
General Motors,2017-8,"Former U.S. attorney David Kelley, who acted as the monitor, declined to comment, citing confidentiality rules."
General Motors,2017-8,Toyota spokesman Scott Vazin said the automaker was pleased the government confirmed Toyota's compliance with the terms of the deferred prosecution agreement and was moving to dismiss the case.

General Motors,2017-8,"{{20170808T093022.247+0000}}ANALYSIS-Autonomous cars race narrows on doubts about clear path to profit* Carmakers look to spread investment burden, risk"
General Motors,2017-8,"FRANKFURT/DETROIT, Aug 8 (Reuters) - BMW and Daimler , the world's top luxury carmakers, have announced alliances with suppliers, talking up the virtues of having a bigger pool of engineers to develop a self-driving car."
General Motors,2017-8,"But another motive behind these deals, executives and industry experts told Reuters, is a concern that robocars may not live up to the profit expectations that drove an initial investment rush."
General Motors,2017-8,Carmakers are increasingly looking to forego outright ownership of future autonomous driving systems in favour of spreading the investment burden and risk.
General Motors,2017-8,"The trend represents a clear shift in strategy from little more than a year ago when most automakers were pursuing standalone strategies focussed on tackling the engineering challenge of developing a self-driving car, rather than on the business case."
General Motors,2017-8,"""Although it is a substantial market, it may not be worth the scale of investments currently being sunk into it,"" said a board member at one of the German carmakers, who declined to be identified because the matter is confidential."
General Motors,2017-8,"Dozens of companies - including carmakers and tech firms like Google and Uber - are vying for a market which, according to consulting firm Frost & Sullivan, will only make up about 10 to 15 percent of vehicles in Europe by 2030. There are sure to be losers."
General Motors,2017-8,"""It's impossible for me to believe there will be 50 successful autonomous vehicle software producers,"" said John Hoffecker, global vice chairman of Michigan-based consulting firm AlixPartners."
General Motors,2017-8,"In July last year, BMW became the first major carmaker to abandon its solo development of self-driving cars in favour of teaming up with chipmaker Intel and camera and software manufacturer Mobileye to build a platform for autonomous cars technology by 2021."
General Motors,2017-8,The decision followed a trip by senior executives to visit startups and suppliers to gauge BMW's competitive position.
General Motors,2017-8,"""Sitting at other companies, one rattles off the technological challenges and safety aspects, and you come to realise that many of us are swimming in the same sludge,"" Klaus Buettner, BMW's vice president autonomous driving projects, told Reuters."
General Motors,2017-8,"""Everybody is investing billions. Our view was that it makes sense to club together to develop some core systems as a platform."""
General Motors,2017-8,"Daimler's Mercedes-Benz has since combined efforts with supplier Bosch [ROBG.UL], three months ago, while Japanese carmaker Honda <7267.T> has said it is open to alliances in the area of autonomous cars. [nL2N1II0L1][nL5N1HC1RX]"
General Motors,2017-8,Even deep-pocketed tech companies are teaming up. San Francisco-based transport app operator Lyft and Alphabet Inc's self-driving car unit Waymo pooled their resources in May. [nL2N1IH02T]
General Motors,2017-8,"Partial autonomy is already a reality in higher-end cars that keep in lane and adjust their speed in motorway driving. Each of the next stages - ""eyes off"", ""mind off"" and ultimately driverless autonomy - will likely take years to become reality."
General Motors,2017-8,"Klaus Froehlich, BMW's board member responsible for development, said the company was likely to lose money with its first fully autonomous vehicles, just like it did with its first-generation electric cars. But developing the technology remains a necessity in order to stay relevant as a carmaker."
General Motors,2017-8,"""It is an enabling technology, not a business case,"" he said about BMW's decision to develop autonomous vehicles. ""But if the burden can be shared on a platform, I have nothing against that."""
General Motors,2017-8,"One of the most financially promising markets that autonomous technology will open up is driverless on-demand taxis, which may one day come to replace regular cabs and parts of public transport in large cities."
General Motors,2017-8,"""Robotaxis"" are expected to drive the wider market for car sharing and ride-hailing, which was worth $53 billion last year and could be worth $2 trillion by 2030, according to a McKinsey study published earlier this year."
General Motors,2017-8,"Ford and General Motors are investing at least $2 billion each to develop self-driving vehicles for urban ride-sharing fleets beginning in 2021, competing with incumbents and start-ups."
General Motors,2017-8,"The emergence of alliances involving the likes of BMW and Mercedes-Benz comes at a time when regulators are pushing for a creation of standards for the new technology, which has the potential to improve vehicle reflexes and cut accidents by up to 90 percent, according to Boston Consulting Group."
General Motors,2017-8,"Industry experts say such standardisation could make it much harder to develop a product which stands out, calling into question the wisdom of high-stakes, go-it-alone strategies."
General Motors,2017-8,"In September 2016, the U.S. Department of Transport and the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration released guidance for heavily automated vehicles."
General Motors,2017-8,"The regulator urged carmakers to disclose how vehicle reflexes are programmed, particularly when cars are faced with a dilemma, such as choosing between hitting a cyclist or accelerating beyond legal speeds to avoid an accident."
General Motors,2017-8,"""It is important to consider whether highly automated vehicles are required to apply particular decision rules in instances of conflicts between safety, mobility, and legality objectives,"" the guidance said."
General Motors,2017-8,"""Algorithms for resolving these conflict situations should be developed transparently using input from federal and state regulators, drivers and passengers."""
General Motors,2017-8,European regulators too are debating whether to standardise speeds and distances which autonomous cars need to adhere to while weaving in and out of traffic or joining lanes.
General Motors,2017-8,"Pressure not to waste development costs is laying the groundwork for alliances and even mergers between the various companies supplying technology for autonomous cars, including makers of vehicles, software, computer chips, radar, camera and laser sensors and high-definition maps."
General Motors,2017-8,"BMW, Mercedes and Audi put aside their rivalry and teamed up to buy mapping firm HERE, for example, in order to cut their dependence on Google."
General Motors,2017-8,"What starts out as arms-length agreements designed to capture market share, much like code-sharing deals between airlines, may evolve further into takeovers once the next investment round is due, executives and advisers said."
General Motors,2017-8,"""Will we see what is happening in aviation be adopted in automotive - where first we see alliances, collaborations and consortiums, and then we see full out market combinations?"" asked Bill Curtin, head of mergers and acquisitions at global law firm Hogan Lovells."

General Motors,2017-8,"DETROIT, Aug 7 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc said on Monday it would raise about $1.5 billion through its first-ever offering of junk bonds as the U.S. luxury electric car maker seeks fresh sources of cash to ramp up production of its new Model 3 sedan."
General Motors,2017-8,The move to issue junk bonds - lower-quality investments that offer higher yields - represents a bet by Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk that bond investors will be as hungry as stock investors to back the company on expectations that its Model 3 will be a hit.

General Motors,2017-8,"The rating agency said the overall company's ""B2"" rating was supported by the fact that if Tesla ends up in serious financial trouble, its brand name, products and physical assets would be of ""considerable value"" to other automakers."
General Motors,2017-8,The automaker's debt load increased significantly last year when it bought solar panel maker SolarCity.

General Motors,2017-8,"LONDON, Aug 4 (Reuters) - British new car registrations fell for a fourth consecutive month in July, the longest run of declines since 2011, in the latest sign of how uncertainty about Brexit is hitting Britain's economy, a car lobby group said on Friday."
General Motors,2017-8,"Demand fell across business, fleet and private sales with total registrations down by 9.3 percent compared with July last year, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said."
General Motors,2017-8,"In the first seven months of the year as a whole, private sales were down 5 percent, with business registrations down 0.2 percent and fleet sales up slightly at 0.1 percent, leaving total registrations down 2.2 percent."

General Motors,2017-8,"{{20170803T220122.373+0000}}UPDATE 3-Tesla surges as Wall Street bets on Model 3(Adds comments from portfolio managers, analyst )"
General Motors,2017-8,"NEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO, Aug 3 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc jumped over 6 percent on Thursday as its quarterly report fueled bets that its new Model 3 sedan would propel the luxury electric carmaker into the mainstream."
General Motors,2017-8,"Chief Executive Elon Musk is counting on the Model 3, Tesla's least pricey car, to make the company profitable and establish it as the leading electric carmaker ahead of BMW, General Motors and other long-established players."
General Motors,2017-8,"Tesla's stock is up 63 percent in 2017, underscoring Wall Street's confidence in Musk."
General Motors,2017-8,"The Palo Alto, California company late on Wednesday reported quarterly results that beat average analyst estimates, and said it received more than 1,800 reservations per day for the Model 3 since its launch last week. [nL1N1KP01U]"
General Motors,2017-8,"Tesla had $3 billion in cash on hand at the end of the June quarter, reassuring investors who were worried after Musk warned on Friday that the automaker would face six months of ""manufacturing hell"" in ramping up production of the Model 3."
General Motors,2017-8,"Tesla's cash burn, expected to top $2 billion this year, has prompted short-sellers like Greenlight Capital's David Einhorn to bet against the company [L1N1KN1FE], and some analysts expect the carmaker to seek extra funding this year."
General Motors,2017-8,"Musk said investors should have ""zero concern"" Tesla would fail to reach its production target of 10,000 vehicles each week by the end of 2018."
General Motors,2017-8,Skeptics believe Tesla's aggressive production targets are unrealistic and the company's electric cars will be overtaken by larger automakers.
General Motors,2017-8,"Yet at least two brokerages raised their price targets following Tesla's report. RBC Capital Markets upped its target price by $31 to $345, pushing it well ahead of the median target of $322, according to Thomson Reuters data."
General Motors,2017-8,"""While we don't have meaningful reason to doubt that Tesla can eventually achieve its targets, doing so in a timely manner without some growing pains could prove challenging,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst Joseph Spak wrote in a research note."
General Motors,2017-8,"Portfolio managers who hold shares of Tesla say they saw the most recent quarter as further evidence Musk will deliver on his promise of building a product that consumers want, even if he sometimes misses deadlines."
General Motors,2017-8,"""Investors trust Musk because he's made it work. It's not that every one of his predictions have come true on schedule, but they have all come true,"" said Kevin Landis, a portfolio manager at Firsthand Funds who holds shares of the company."
General Motors,2017-8,"The $35,000 base-price Model 3 is Tesla's least expensive car. It is designed and priced to compete with high-volume luxury sedans like the Audi A4, BMW 3-series or Mercedes C-Class. Those typically sell for between $40,000 and $50,000, or about half the price of Tesla's previously launched cars, the Model S or Model X."
General Motors,2017-8,"David Kudla, chief investment strategist at Mainstay Capital Management, who shorted Tesla in the past but does not have a current position on its shares, said he expected Musk to go back to capital markets before year end to raise extra funding."
General Motors,2017-8,"Musk said on an earnings call with analysts Wednesday that while Tesla was not considering an equity raise, ""we are thinking about debt"" issuance."
General Motors,2017-8,"The sooner the company does that, the better shape it will be in, Kudla added, saying he expected more delays and slow-downs as the company ramps up Model 3 output."
General Motors,2017-8,"""There are so many things that can go wrong,"" he added."
General Motors,2017-8,"Yet Scott Goginsky, a portfolio manager at the Biondo Growth fund, said Tesla's rich valuation should allow the company to raise additional capital if necessary without overly-diluting its share price."
General Motors,2017-8,"He said he had been trimming his holding in the company not over concern with its fundamentals, but to prevent it from becoming too large a position in his portfolio."
General Motors,2017-8,"""People want the car. They will definitely sell it. It's just a matter of whether they can make it fast enough,"" he said."

General Motors,2017-8,* Four-week average of claims falls to two-month low
General Motors,2017-8,"WASHINGTON, Aug 3 (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits fell last week, pointing to a tightening labor market that likely keeps the Federal Reserve on course to announce plans next month to start reducing its massive bond portfolio."
General Motors,2017-8,Labor market strength was also underscored by another report on Thursday showing U.S.-based employers last month announced the fewest job cuts in eight months. But a moderation in services sector activity to an 11-month low in July put a wrinkle in the brightening economic outlook.
General Motors,2017-8,"The services sector accounts for more than two-thirds of the U.S. economy and analysts worry that the slowdown, if sustained, could keep inflation tame."
General Motors,2017-8,"""The services economy is cooling, which makes the Fed's goal of 2 percent inflation a little harder to achieve,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""But with the labor market tight, the Fed can continue mopping up the stimulus provided to fight the financial crisis and recession."""
General Motors,2017-8,"Initial claims for state unemployment benefits decreased 5,000 to a seasonally adjusted 240,000 for the week ended July 29, the Labor Department said. Economists had forecast claims falling to 242,000."
General Motors,2017-8,"Claims have now been below 300,000, a threshold associated with a healthy labor market, for 126 straight weeks. That is the longest such stretch since 1970, when the labor market was smaller. The labor market is near full employment, with the jobless rate at 4.4 percent."
General Motors,2017-8,"The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 2,500 to 241,750 last week, the lowest level since May."
General Motors,2017-8,Economists believe that labor market tightness will encourage the Fed to announce a plan to start offloading its $4.2 trillion portfolio of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities in September.
General Motors,2017-8,"The U.S. central bank is, however, expected to delay raising interest rates until December because of low inflation. The Fed has raised rates twice this year."
General Motors,2017-8,"The claims data has no bearing on July's employment report, which is scheduled to be released on Friday, as it falls outside the survey period."
General Motors,2017-8,"According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls probably increased by 183,000 jobs last month after surging by 222,000 in June. The unemployment rate is seen falling one-tenth of a percentage point to 4.3 percent."
General Motors,2017-8,"The U.S. dollar <.DXY> initially firmed against a basket of currencies on the claims data but gave up gains after the services sector survey. Prices for U.S. Treasuries rose, buoyed in part by the Bank of England's decision to keep interest rates at a record low and downgrade its economic and inflation forecasts. [nL1N1KP0UU]"
General Motors,2017-8,"U.S. stocks were mixed, with the S&P 500 <.SPX) and the Nasdaq <.IXIC> falling, but the Dow <.DJI> setting a new record high. [nL4N1KP5IR]"
General Motors,2017-8,"In a separate report on Thursday, global outplacement consultancy Challenger, Gray & Christmas said U.S.-based employers announced 28,307 job cuts last month, down 9 percent from June and the fewest number since November 2016."
General Motors,2017-8,"Retailers planned to cut 3,862 jobs in July. They were closely followed by the healthcare products and services sector where employers planned 3,634 layoffs."
General Motors,2017-8,"""While retailers are cutting the most jobs this year, those companies are also announcing the most hiring,"" said John Challenger, chief executive officer of Challenger, Gray & Christmas. ""New retail jobs could be going to places like fulfillment and distribution centers."""
General Motors,2017-8,"Retailers have accounted for 245,616 of the 556,493 new jobs that have been announced so far this year, according to Challenger tracking. Online retail giant Amazon plans to hire about 50,000 workers this month at its warehouses and sorting centers."
General Motors,2017-8,"A third report from the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) showed its non-manufacturing index fell to a reading of 53.9 last month, the lowest since August 2016, from 57.4 in June. A reading above 50 in the ISM index indicates an expansion in the services sector."
General Motors,2017-8,"""The ISM report is clearly a big disappointment and suggests that the economy may have lost some momentum going into the third quarter,"" said Andrew Hunter, an economist at Capital Economics. ""But it is worth remembering that these monthly surveys have always been volatile."""
General Motors,2017-8,"Last month, a gauge of new orders received by services industries fell to 55.1 from 60.5 in June. A measure of services sector employment dropped 2.2 points to 53.6."
General Motors,2017-8,"Nine industries reported increasing employment and four said they had cut payrolls. Some companies said they ""continued to refine workforce through efficiencies"" and others reported ""filling more open positions."""

General Motors,2017-8,{{20170802T174218.433+0000}}Auto workers' union rolls the dice at Nissan's Mississippi plantBy Nick Carey
General Motors,2017-8,"CANTON, Miss., Aug 2 (Reuters) - For nearly a decade, the United Auto Workers union has tried to organize workers at Nissan Motor Co Ltd's <7201.T> assembly plant here, challenging the company's wages, safety record and commitment to treating African-American workers fairly."
General Motors,2017-8,"Starting Thursday, the roughly 4,000 workers at one of Mississippi's largest industrial employers will cast their votes, affecting not only their own futures but the union's as well."
General Motors,2017-8,"Another failure to organize a southern auto factory would leave the UAW weakened ahead of contract negotiations with the Detroit Three automakers in 2019, when many analysts forecast U.S. auto sales will be in a cyclical slump."
General Motors,2017-8,"The organizing vote, which the UAW called for last month, has divided workers at the Canton plant, which builds Nissan Murano sport utility vehicles, commercial vans and Titan and Frontier pickup trucks."
General Motors,2017-8,Pro-union workers said the plant has a record of poor safety and complain that the company moved to a 401(k) defined contribution plan from a traditional plan.
General Motors,2017-8,"""This is not about wages, I'm concerned about safety issues at the plant and about my pension,"" says Patricia Ruffian, 51. ""They say if we vote for the union we're going to have nothing, we have to start from scratch, and that's not true."""
General Motors,2017-8,"The UAW also claims Nissan has illegally threatened workers that if they vote for the union, the plant will close. Based on those claims, the U.S. National Labor Relations Board has issued a number of complaints that Nissan has made that threat a number of times in recent years. The automaker denies the allegations. The outcome of the election could be contested, leading to a test of how the Trump-era NLRB will handle contentious labor issues."
General Motors,2017-8,"Rodney Francis, director of Human Resources at Nissan's Canton plant, said, ""Labor rights are about the right to organize, or not to organize. All we've been doing is providing employees with the facts so they can make an informed decision and at the end of the day this is about what they choose."""
General Motors,2017-8,"Nissan has strong supporters on the factory floor, who point to the history of problems at Detroit's unionized automakers and reject the UAW's arguments that black workers are not treated fairly."
General Motors,2017-8,"""Black people are doing much better here since Nissan came,"" said Tony Jacobson, 52, who is black. He has worked at the plant since it opened in 2003 and makes $28 per hour - comparable to the top rate for unionized workers at General Motors Co or Ford Motor Co . ""I'm trying to save our livelihoods, I don't want Canton to be like Detroit."""
General Motors,2017-8,"The UAW, like other large industrial unions, has struggled to expand membership as manufacturers have moved jobs overseas or to states like Mississippi that allow workers to shun union membership even in union shops."
General Motors,2017-8,"The union has organized smaller auto suppliers in the U.S. south, but has failed for decades to organize all the workers at a major southern auto-assembly plant. Politicians in the region have used low unionization as a selling point to attract more manufacturing investment."
General Motors,2017-8,"""If the union wins, it will encourage other in the South to unionize,"" Vanderbilt University labor analyst Daniel Cornfield said. ""If the company wins, it will make it more difficult for the UAW to organize elsewhere in the South."""
General Motors,2017-8,"Scott Waller, president of the Mississippi Economic Council (MEC), the state's chamber of commerce, says Nissan has ""changed the landscape"" in Mississippi. Nissan was the first automaker to locate a major assembly plant in the state, but since Mississippi won the contest for the factory in 2000, it has secured significant investments by other automotive giants like Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T> and Continental AG ."
General Motors,2017-8,"The number of auto workers in the state rose to 18,000 in 2016, from 11,000 in 2010. Government statistics show the average Mississippi auto worker earned $50,510 in 2016, 34 percent above the state average."
General Motors,2017-8,"A vote for union representation at Nissan's Canton plant ""could affect that plant's ability to compete and Mississippi's ability to compete in the realm of economic development,"" Waller said."
General Motors,2017-8,The union has connected the pay issue to its argument that Nissan is undermining progress on civil rights.
General Motors,2017-8,"""There's a huge race issue there, there's an issue of civil rights and the history of Mississippi plays into that narrative,"" UAW Secretary-Treasurer Gary Casteel said in an interview."
General Motors,2017-8,"Dolphus Weary, co-chair of community organization Move Mississippi Forward and a long-term black campaigner for racial unity, said he doesn't see it that way. He recounts visiting a manufacturing plant in the 1960s where the only black workers were janitors."
General Motors,2017-8,"When he visited Nissan's Canton plant, Weary says ""my antenna were up looking for the same situation"" but instead he found a plant where 46 percent of the managers were black."
General Motors,2017-8,"""This is the new Mississippi,"" Weary says of the plant. ""I don't think old arguments from 50 years ago will help move us forward."""
General Motors,2017-8,"But Reverend Isiac Jackson, pastor of the Liberty Missionary Baptist Church in Canton, said management at Nissan's plant has worked to prevent employees from voting on union representation, which is reminiscent of the time when Mississippi's leaders tried to prevent black citizens from voting."
General Motors,2017-8,"""Now just let everybody vote,"" he said. ""And if they vote against a union then everybody will go about their business."""

General Motors,2017-8,"{{20170801T205631.642+0000}}Automakers, regulators urge work on U.S. fuel rules reviewBy David Shepardson"
General Motors,2017-8,"TRAVERSE CITY, Mich., Aug 1 (Reuters) - A U.S. Environmental Protection Agency official and major auto industry lobbyists urged the government and automakers on Tuesday to consider innovative ideas to head off conflict over 2025 model-year fuel efficiency standards for U.S. automakers."
General Motors,2017-8,"Christopher Grundler, director of the EPA's Office of Transportation and Air Quality, told an automotive conference that regulators should consider allowing automakers to get regulatory credits for vehicles that can operate in a more fuel-efficient mode or for selling electric vehicles to high-mileage ride-sharing fleets."
General Motors,2017-8,"""Having this conversation about both the nearer term and longer term at the same time makes a lot of business and technical sense,"" Grundler said, adding that knowing where the emissions rules are going through 2030 could provide stability to automakers."
General Motors,2017-8,Grundler had a leading role in crafting the Obama administration rule requiring automakers to roughly double new- vehicle fuel efficiency - and cut greenhouse gas emissions - in stages between 2012 and 2025.
General Motors,2017-8,"In March, President Donald Trump ordered a review of U.S. vehicle fuel-efficiency standards from 2022 to 2025 put in place under former President Barack Obama, saying they were too tough on the auto industry. The review must be finalized by April 2018."
General Motors,2017-8,"In 2011, officials said the rules would save motorists $1.7 trillion in fuel costs over the life of the vehicles but cost the auto industry about $200 billion over 13 years."
General Motors,2017-8,"The U.S. Transportation Department said last week it may revise fuel-efficiency requirements starting with the 2021 model year, a year earlier than previously disclosed, and was studying the impact of freezing standards through 2025. The White House has held meetings with automakers to discuss the 2025 review. [nL1N1KG0JS]"
General Motors,2017-8,"Under current rules, fleetwide average fuel economy is expected to be around 41 miles per gallon in 2021, compared with an average of nearly 50 miles per gallon in 2025."
General Motors,2017-8,California opposes weakening the rules and threatened to pursue tougher standards unilaterally. Other states have also pledged court fights. Automakers want a national standard that will allow them to plan investments in new vehicles and technology.
General Motors,2017-8,"Mitch Bainwol, chief executive of the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a trade group representing General Motors Co , Volkswagen AG and others, said the only issue was how much requirements should rise."
General Motors,2017-8,"""We all want to get to a compromise deal,"" Bainwol said. ""We're not talking about a monumental shift in regulatory policy or outcomes."""
General Motors,2017-8,"Annette Hebert, a senior official with the California Air Resource Board, said her agency did not plan to relax its 2025 standards. California wants to hold talks with automakers on standards that reach beyond 2025."
General Motors,2017-8,"""We need to have a sense of urgency about this,"" said John Bozzella, president of Global Automakers, a trade group representing foreign automakers including Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T> and Hyundai Motor Co <005380.KS> at the forum."

General Motors,2017-8,{{20170801T194511.033+0000}}UPDATE 5-U.S. auto sales fall in July as carmakers slash rental fleet sales(Adds annualized sales pace for July; background on rental car fleet sales)
General Motors,2017-8,"DETROIT, Aug 1 (Reuters) - U.S. carmakers said on Tuesday they continued to slash low-margin sales to daily rental fleets in July as the overall pace of U.S. car and light truck sales fell for the fifth straight month."
General Motors,2017-8,"The annualized pace of U.S. car and light truck sales in July fell to 16.73 million vehicles, down from 17.8 million vehicles a year earlier, according to Autodata Corp, which tracks industry sales."
General Motors,2017-8,Investors sold shares in the Detroit Three automakers on Tuesday. General Motors Co fell about 3.5 percent and Ford Motor Co slid about 2.5 percent.
General Motors,2017-8,"Several major automakers, including GM, Ford, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles , Nissan Motor Co <7201.T> and Hyundai Motor Co<005380.KS> said they sharply reduced rental car sales in July, and they portrayed the decisions as putting profit ahead of sales volume."
General Motors,2017-8,"Automakers have used low-margin sales to rental fleets to avoid factory shutdowns. With more flexible labor agreements, the Detroit automakers have shifted course. They are quicker to idle factories to reduce supply, and they are demanding higher prices, industry officials said. Fiat Chrysler has killed several models it once sold to fleets."
General Motors,2017-8,"Big U.S. rental car companies such as Hertz Global Holdings Inc and Avis Budget Car Rental [CARXXB.UL] at the same time are restructuring their fleets as values decline for rental cars they resell, and as ride services such as Uber Technologies [UBER.UL] bite into their business. [nL1N1JN1E4]"
General Motors,2017-8,"In a more troubling sign for Detroit, combined sales of large pickups fell 4 percent, and sales of large sport utility vehicles declined by 20 percent. Only the Ford F-series, up 6 percent, improved on year-ago results among major truck models."
General Motors,2017-8,"Declining sales could leave the Detroit Three with too many plants in North America, Jeff Schuster, a forecaster with LMC Automotive, said on Tuesday at an industry conference in Traverse City, Mich. The decline in July's annual sales pace from a year ago equates to the output of four assembly plants."
General Motors,2017-8,"GM gained little ground in its effort to reduce inventories of unsold vehicles. The automaker had 104 days of supply at the end of July, down from 105 days at the end of June. GM has promised investors to reduce inventories to 70 days by year-end. [nL1N1KG0CT]"
General Motors,2017-8,"Ford said July sales fell 7.5 percent, but inventory fell to 77 days from 79 the previous month. Fiat Chrysler said sales dropped 10 percent."
General Motors,2017-8,"Among the top Japanese companies, only Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T> reported a year-to-year gain, with sales up 4 percent. Honda Motor Co <7267.T> sales fell 1 percent, and Nissan sales fell 3 percent."
General Motors,2017-8,"GM, Ford and Fiat Chrysler have said second-half financial results likely will be lower than first-half results, in part reflecting production cuts in North America and pricing pressures. [nL1N1KH12N]"
