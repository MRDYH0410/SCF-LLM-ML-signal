General Motors,2017-9,UPDATE 3-China sets 2019 deadline for automakers to meet green-car sales targets - Reuters News
General Motors,2017-9,"{{20170929T015503.023+0000}}UPDATE 3-China sets 2019 deadline for automakers to meet green-car sales targets* NEV quotas set at 10 pct for 2019, 12 pct for 2020"
General Motors,2017-9,"BEIJING/SHANGHAI, Sept 28 (Reuters) - China has set a deadline of 2019 to impose tough new sales targets for electric plug-in and hybrids vehicles, slightly relaxing an earlier plan to launch the rules from next year that had left global automakers worried about being able to comply."
General Motors,2017-9,"Car makers will need to amass credits for so-called new-energy vehicles (NEVs) equivalent to 10 percent of annual sales by 2019, China's industry ministry said in a statement on Thursday. That level would rise to 12 percent for 2020."
General Motors,2017-9,A single vehicle can generate multiple credits meaning the proportion by NEVs by volume would likely be lower.
General Motors,2017-9,"The targets, announced by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT), closely mirror previously announced plans, but remove an explicit 8 percent quota for 2018, in effect giving carmakers an extra year grace period."
General Motors,2017-9,"The quotas are a key part of a drive by China, the world's largest auto market, to develop its own NEV market, with a long-term aim to ban the production and sale of cars that use traditional fuels announced earlier this month. [nL4N1LR023]"
General Motors,2017-9,"Global automotive manufacturers, however, had urged a softening of the proposals for all-electric battery vehicles and electric plug-in hybrids."
General Motors,2017-9,"Under the rules, car makers will receive credits for new-energy vehicles including plug-in hybrids and fully electric cars that can be transferred or traded. Firms with annual sales volumes above 30,000 units will need to comply with the targets."
General Motors,2017-9,"These credits - which will vary depending on the range and performance of the vehicle - will be used to calculate if firms have met their quota, a system which would likely mean the actual proportion NEVs made up of total sales was lower."
General Motors,2017-9,"""The rules could result in the production of more than one million EVs annually in China by 2020, or about 4 percent of sales,"" Simon Mui, a transport and energy exert at the U.S.-based Natural Resources Defense Council wrote in note."
General Motors,2017-9,"""We welcome the Chinese auto industry's shift towards greater adoption of NEVs and will comply with relevant regulations presented by authorities,"" Ford Motor Co said in a statement responding to the announcement."
General Motors,2017-9,"General Motors Co said it would ""strive to comply with the NEV mandatory requirements"", though it added ""continued joint efforts by the government and companies are essential to build broad-based consumer acceptance for NEVs""."
General Motors,2017-9,"""GM has sufficient capacity to manufacture NEVs in China,"" it said in a statement."
General Motors,2017-9,"Japan's Honda Motor Co Ltd <7267.T> said it planned to launch an electric battery car in China next year and would ""try to expand our lineup of new energy vehicles"" to meet the quotas."
General Motors,2017-9,China is keen to combat air pollution and close a competitive gap between its newer domestic automakers and global rivals. It wants to set goals for electric and plug-in hybrid cars to make up at least a fifth of Chinese auto sales by 2025.
General Motors,2017-9,"Reuters reported in August that China would delay the implementation of the NEV quotas until 2019, giving global automakers more time to prepare. [nL8N1LG2SQ]"
General Motors,2017-9,Trucking group disappointed self-driving bill leaves out big vehicles - Reuters News
General Motors,2017-9,"{{20170928T212507.027+0000}}Trucking group disappointed self-driving bill leaves out big vehiclesWASHINGTON, Sept 28 (Reuters) - A U.S. trucking group said Thursday it was disappointed that a compromise bill to advance self-driving cars and eliminate regulatory roadblocks will not include larger vehicles."
General Motors,2017-9,"American Trucking Associations President Chris Spear said in a statement the announcement ""is not the end of the road for this issue. If more automated cars and trucks are to share the roads, they should also share the same framework."""
General Motors,2017-9,"Senator John Thune, a Republican who chairs the Commerce Committee, and Senator Gary Peters, a Michigan Democrat, said they had reached agreement on legislation that would be voted on by the committee on Oct. 4."
General Motors,2017-9,"General Motors Co , Alphabet Inc , Ford Motor Co and others have lobbied for the legislation to speed deployment of self-driving cars by allowing federal regulators to approve their use if they deem them safe. They also want to bar states from blocking autonomous vehicles."
General Motors,2017-9,"Reuters reported late Wednesday that the bill would not include larger commercial trucks after Democrats and some organized labor leaders objected. The senators confirmed Thursday that the bill would not include vehicles larger than 10,000 pounds."
General Motors,2017-9,"A bill that unanimously passed the U.S. House earlier this month also excluded bigger vehicles. Under that proposal, states could still set rules on registration, licensing, liability, insurance and safety inspections, but would be barred from setting self-driving car performance standards."
General Motors,2017-9,"The House measure, the first significant federal legislation aimed at bringing self-driving cars to market, would allow automakers to get approval to sell up to 25,000 vehicles in the first year, rising to 100,000 by year three, as long as they could demonstrate the vehicles are at least as safe as current vehicles with human controls."
General Motors,2017-9,"The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, an automaker trade group, on Thursday praised the bill and said it will ""help advance self-driving technologies and help keep the United States at the forefront of these innovations."""
General Motors,2017-9,"The 1.4-million member International Brotherhood of Teamsters union mounted an aggressive effort to convince Congress not to include self-driving trucks, warning they could lead to the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs and reduce road safety."
General Motors,2017-9,"Auto industry and labor leaders have said 3 million commercial truck jobs could eventually be at risk if self-driving vehicles replaced human drivers, who are already in short supply."
General Motors,2017-9,"Alphabet is working on developing self-driving trucks. Tesla Inc , which is developing self-driving technologies, has said it plans to unveil a commercial truck called the Tesla Semi."
General Motors,2017-9,"Consumers Union, a public advocacy group, said the Senate ""bill falls far short of what consumers need. Instead of making consumer safety the top priority, it removes critical guardrails to create a fast lane for self-driving cars."""
General Motors,2017-9,Storm sales boost gives U.S. carmakers chance to cut oversupply - Reuters News
General Motors,2017-9,{{20170928T185914.180+0000}}Storm sales boost gives U.S. carmakers chance to cut oversupplyBy Nick Carey
General Motors,2017-9,"DETROIT, Sept 28 (Reuters) - The two storms that battered southeast Texas and Florida in the past month have given U.S. automakers a reprieve from two problems that have cast a shadow over the price of their shares all year: bulging new-vehicle inventory and an oversupply of nearly new, off-lease vehicles."
General Motors,2017-9,"Automakers are scheduled to report U.S. sales on Oct. 3, offering the first indications of the boost to demand for vehicles to replace those damaged or destroyed in Houston's record floods and the pummeling much of Florida got from Hurricane Irma. Analysts expect September to show the first monthly increase in vehicle sales this year."
General Motors,2017-9,"According to data compiled for Reuters by car-shopping website CarGurus, during the height of the storm online car searches in Houston were down 25 percent - from an Aug. 4 baseline - but as of Sept. 17 were up 18 percent."
General Motors,2017-9,"""Business has been very brisk at our 26 dealerships (in southeast Texas) this month,"" said Pete DeLongchamps, vice president for manufacturer relations at Group 1 Automotive Inc , the third-largest U.S. auto dealer group. ""That's true for both new and used vehicles."""
General Motors,2017-9,"Cox Automotive chief economist Jonathan Smoke says that the ""immediate replacement demand"" following the storms is around 600,000 including 400,000 in southeast Texas. Around 200,000 of the replacement vehicles will likely be new and the rest used."
General Motors,2017-9,"Most of the cars will be used either because many people lack flood insurance, their insurers only pay them the current replacement value, or they owe more than their vehicle is worth so they will not be able to afford a new car."
General Motors,2017-9,"""This is a great opportunity for the automakers ... as this will lead to a reduction in the excess supply that's been on the market,"" he said."
General Motors,2017-9,"High demand around Houston has already prompted dealers in other states, automakers and their captive finance companies to shift nearly-new vehicles into that market for auction."
General Motors,2017-9,"Forecasts that hundreds of thousands of vehicles would need to be replaced boosted shares of General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co , despite disappointing sales figures for August. GM shares are currently trading at a three-year high. [nL4N1LI43A]"
General Motors,2017-9,"Before the storms hit, U.S. automakers were facing the largest levels of unsold inventory in 13 years, said Joe Langley, a senior analyst at economic forecasting and data company IHS Markit."
General Motors,2017-9,"IHS estimates automakers have 500,000 to 600,000 more vehicles in stock than they need. GM accounted for about half that oversupply, Langley said. GM has cut production and said earlier in September that it is on track to reduce inventories to about 850,000 vehicles at the end of the year from 938,000 as of Aug. 1."
General Motors,2017-9,There are concerns that competition for market share amid declining sales mean automakers will not cut production enough.
General Motors,2017-9,"""Inventory will likely be a lingering problem because everyone wants to fight for share,"" said Jessica Caldwell, executive director of industry analysis for car shopping website Edmunds.com."
General Motors,2017-9,"Within days of the catastrophic flooding Hurricane Harvey brought to the Houston area, an army of tow trucks began descending on the city to haul away damaged vehicles. [nL2N1LN06K]"
General Motors,2017-9,"A spokesman for the non-profit National Insurance Crime Bureau (NICB) said that as of Wednesday around 297,000 auto insurance claims had been filed related to Harvey and 128,000 had been filed because of Irma."
General Motors,2017-9,"Executives at Copart Inc , which dominates the auto salvage auction business alongside KAR Auction Services Inc , said last week during an earnings conference call the company could salvage more than 85,000 vehicles damaged by Harvey. KAR did not provide an estimate, but the website for its unit Insurance Auto Auctions Inc lists around 54,000 flood-damaged vehicles that have been processed so far."
General Motors,2017-9,Recent data points from Houston have been encouraging for auto sales.
General Motors,2017-9,"Used vehicle prices are rising. Geoff Parker, a regional vice president at KAR's ADESA used-car auction unit, whose territory includes Texas, said auction volumes have been up around 10 to 20 percent following Harvey and between 25 percent to 35 percent more dealers have been attending auctions."
General Motors,2017-9,"Parker said auto dealers in Ohio, Georgia and Tennessee have been shipping used cars to Texas for sale and an automaker's captive finance company has just shipped 1,000 off-lease vehicles from Michigan for sale in Texas."
General Motors,2017-9,Post-Irma sales in Florida have been slower to pick up because the storm left many dealers without power for longer.

General Motors,2017-9,"NEW YORK, Sept 28 (Reuters Breakingviews) - An initial public offering for Lyft would amplify Uber's [UBER.UL] troubles. The ride-hailing firm is readying to go public as early as next year, Reuters reports. It would be an opportunistic way for the company, which was valued at $7.5 billion in its last funding round, to capitalize on its larger rival's self-inflicted damage. Fresh capital for the second U.S. player would merely compound the frontrunner's injuries."
General Motors,2017-9,"Lyft is still relatively small. It passed $1 billion in gross bookings in the second quarter, about one-eighth the amount of its big competitor's. It also operates only in America, while Uber has a presence in over 70 countries. Yet Lyft is growing faster, and losing less than $100 million a quarter, according to an investor. By contrast, Uber lost over six times as much in the second quarter."
General Motors,2017-9,"- Lyft is close to hiring an advisor for an initial public offering, Reuters reported, citing sources familiar with the matter. The ride hailing service's float could happen as early as next year. The advisory firm will help Lyft chose underwriters and plan the offering."
General Motors,2017-9,"- Lyft was valued at $7.5 billion at its last funding round in April. It was valued at $5.5 billion in early 2016, when it raised money from General Motors and others."

General Motors,2017-9,"DETROIT, Sept 27 (Reuters) - North American vehicle production by the unionized Detroit Three automakers will fall behind the combined North American output of Tesla Inc and automakers from Europe and Asia for the first time this year, IHS Markit forecast on Wednesday."
General Motors,2017-9,"In 2017, the Detroit Three could build 8.6 million vehicles in North America, while Tesla and foreign automakers build 8.7 million, IHS Markit analyst Joe Langley said on Wednesday."
General Motors,2017-9,"By 2024, the gap will widen, with Asian and European automakers and Tesla combining to build about 9.8 million vehicles in North America. General Motors Co , Ford Motor Co and the North American operations of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV will combine to build 8.1 million vehicles, down 6 percent from this year."
General Motors,2017-9,"Mexico is on track to increase its share of North American vehicle production, Langley said, moving to 4.5 million vehicles a year by 2024 from about 4 million vehicles currently."
General Motors,2017-9,The milestone for the growth of Tesla and foreign automakers in North America comes as the Trump administration is pushing to limit imports of vehicles from Mexico in negotiations to overhaul the North American Free Trade Agreement.
General Motors,2017-9,The declining share of North American vehicle production for the Detroit automakers also challenges U.S. and Canadian unions that represent their workers.
General Motors,2017-9,Canadian workers are on strike at a GM factory in Ontario to protest the automaker's decision to cut jobs and move to Mexico some production of sport utility models built there.
General Motors,2017-9,"Foreign automakers over the past year have announced plans for a wave of new or expanded plants in North America, while Tesla is ramping up to build as many as 500,000 cars a year at its plant in Fremont, Calif. Often referred to as ""transplants,"" the foreign-owned factories are poised to become the mainstream of the North American auto industry. [nL2N1M21EG]"
General Motors,2017-9,"Automakers are increasingly using factories in China or Mexico to build vehicles that used to be assembled solely in the United States, Langley said.

General Motors,2017-9,"SAN FRANCISCO, Sept 26 (Reuters) - Shares of Tesla Inc remained in a correction on Tuesday after a billionaire British inventor announced plans for his own electric vehicles, taking the shine off an analyst prediction that Tesla's cars would be commonplace within two years."
General Motors,2017-9,"Tesla's stock ended 0.07 percent higher, surrendering most of an earlier 1.7 percent gain in a volatile session. After losses in recent days, it remained down 10 percent from a record high on Sept. 18."

General Motors,2017-9,"WILMINGTON, Del, Sept 26 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co scored a partial victory on Tuesday in a long-running dispute over the repayment of a $1.5 billion loan it made to General Motors' bankrupt predecessor, known as 'Old GM'."
General Motors,2017-9,"U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Martin Glenn in Manhattan sided with the bank against Old GM's unsecured creditors, who have been trying to claw back the money, finding that most assets securing the loan, like robots and conveyor belts, were ""fixtures"" covered by a JPMorgan lien."
General Motors,2017-9,"Unsecured creditors had hoped to convince Glenn the assets were not covered by the lien, which would have cleared the way for them to try to recoup money that Old GM repaid to the bank."
General Motors,2017-9,JPMorgan said it was reviewing the ruling. A lawyer for unsecured creditors declined to comment.
General Motors,2017-9,"In addition to determining if the assets were fixtures, Glenn was also asked to determine the value of the equipment. The judge rejected the bank's proposed valuation, although he also rejected the valuation method proposed by unsecured creditors."
General Motors,2017-9,"The legal fight stretches back to 2006, when JPMorgan loaned GM $1.5 billion and received a lien on GM assets."
General Motors,2017-9,"Due to a paperwork error, a lien was invalidated in 2008, but other liens remained on fixtures in a multiple GM locations covering 200,000 pieces of equipment."
General Motors,2017-9,Glenn was only asked to rule on a representative subset of 40 assets that was subject of a two-week trial this year that culminated with Tuesday's ruling.
General Motors,2017-9,The parties will now take Glenn's ruling and begin mediated talks to settle the dispute.
General Motors,2017-9,The judge urged them to settle the matter out of court.
General Motors,2017-9,"""With over 200,000 assets remaining in dispute, in the event the Court is required to make individual determinations on each of these 200,000 assets, cars very well might be flying around Mars by the time the dispute is fully adjudicated,"" he wrote in his 196-page ruling."

General Motors,2017-9,"LONDON, Sept 26 (Reuters) - James Dyson, the billionaire British inventor of the bagless vacuum cleaner, said on Tuesday his company was working on developing an electric car to be launched by 2020."
General Motors,2017-9,Dyson said he was spending 2 billion pounds ($2.7 billion) to exploit his namesake company's expertise in solid-state battery technology and electric motors to be found in his innovative vacuum cleaners and other products like bladeless fans and air purifiers.
General Motors,2017-9,"""Battery technology is very important to Dyson, electric motors are very important to Dyson, environmental control is very important to us,"" Dyson, aged 71, said at his company's flagship shop on London's Oxford Street."
General Motors,2017-9,"""I have been developing these technologies consistently because I could see that one day we could do a car."""
General Motors,2017-9,"Dyson said a 400-strong team of engineers had already spent 2-1/2 years working on the hitherto secret car project in Malmesbury, Wiltshire. However, the car itself still has to be designed and the choice of battery to be finalised."
General Motors,2017-9,"The company was backing solid-state rather than the lithium ion technology used in existing electric vehicles because it was safer, the batteries would not overheat, were quicker to charge and potentially more powerful, he said."
General Motors,2017-9,Dyson said his ambition to go it alone was driven by the car industry's dismissal of an idea he had of applying his cyclonic technology that revolutionised vacuum cleaners to handle diesel emissions in car exhaust systems in the 1990s.
General Motors,2017-9,"""We are not a johnny-come-lately onto the scene of electric cars,"" he said. ""It has been my ambition since 1998 when I was rejected by the industry, which has happily gone on making polluting diesel engines, and governments have gone on allowing it."""
General Motors,2017-9,There had already been clues that Dyson was working on a car.
General Motors,2017-9,"His company has been hiring executives from Aston Martin and last year the government said in a report it was helping to fund development work on an electric vehicle at the firm, although the entry was quickly changed."
General Motors,2017-9,"Dyson said he was coming clean now because it was becoming harder to talk to subcontractors, government and potential new employees."
General Motors,2017-9,"But the car does not yet have a design nor a chassis, he said, and the company had not yet decided where it will be made, beyond ruling out working with the big car companies."
General Motors,2017-9,"""Wherever we make the battery, we'll make the car, that's logical,"" he said. ""So we want to be near our suppliers, we want to be in a place that welcomes us and is friendly to us, and where it is logistically most sensible."
General Motors,2017-9,"""And we see a very large market for this car in the Far East."""
General Motors,2017-9,"Dyson gave no details of the concept for the vehicle, beyond saying it would not be like anything else already on the market."
General Motors,2017-9,"""There's no point in doing one that looks like everyone else's,"" he said, adding that it would not be a sports car and it would not be ""a very cheap"" car."
General Motors,2017-9,"Dyson, who was a prominent backer of the campaign for Britain to leave the European Union, has been able to fund the project through the profits of his holding company."
General Motors,2017-9,"The Weybourne Group reported a 55 percent rise in pretax profit to 473 million pounds in 2016 on revenue of 2.53 billion pounds, according to accounts filed earlier this month. On Tuesday Dyson told his workforce, which includes more than 1,000 engineers, that the company finally had the opportunity to bring all its technologies together into a single product."
General Motors,2017-9,"""Competition for new technology in the automotive industry is fierce and we must do everything we can to keep the specifics of our vehicle confidential,"" he said in an email."

General Motors,2017-9,{{20170919T165707.741+0000}}Tesla shares fall from record high after warning from analystBy Noel Randewich
General Motors,2017-9,"SAN FRANCISCO, Sept 19 (Reuters) - Shares of Tesla fell from record highs on Tuesday after an analyst warned that the electric car maker may take longer than expected to become profitable."
General Motors,2017-9,"Jefferies analyst Philippe Houchois launched coverage of Tesla with an ""underperform"" rating, helping send shares of the company headed by entrepreneur billionaire Elon Musk down 2.17 percent to $376.74 after closing at a record high the day before."
General Motors,2017-9,"""Achievements to-date and vision are impressive, but we don't think Tesla's vertically integrated business model can be scaled up as profitably and quickly as consensus thinks and valuation multiples imply,"" Houchois warned in a research note."
General Motors,2017-9,"Houchois' $280 price target was well below the median analyst price target of $337.50, according to Thomson Reuters data."
General Motors,2017-9,"Musk is counting on the recently launched Model 3, Tesla's least pricey car, to make the Palo Alto, California company profitable and establish it as the leading electric carmaker ahead of BMW , General Motors and other long-established players."
General Motors,2017-9,Wall Street's confidence in Musk has sent Tesla's stock up 83 percent over the past year to record highs.

General Motors,2017-9,* Second time the two automakers are set to work together
General Motors,2017-9,"MUMBAI/DETROIT, Sept 18 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co and Indian vehicle maker Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd said on Monday they will launch a strategic alliance to counter challenges posed by fast-changing technology and global competition."
General Motors,2017-9,"The agreement, which builds on a former alliance that was unwound in 2005, is another sign that Ford's Chief Executive Jim Hackett, who took over in May, has begun to steer the automaker in a different direction."
General Motors,2017-9,Ford and other global automakers are under pressure as policymakers demand they shift their product lines entirely to electric vehicles over the next two to three decades. One potential benefit to Ford of a partnership with Mahindra is access to lower cost electric vehicle designs and local suppliers it needs to compete in markets such as India.
General Motors,2017-9,"Ford has less than a 3 percent market share in India, although its exports from India are expanding rapidly. Near term, Mahindra could help Ford lower its distribution costs or send production work to Ford's Indian plants."
General Motors,2017-9,"At the same time, regional automakers such as Mahindra with ambitions to grow need access to technology, strong brands and global distribution networks that established companies like Ford can offer."
General Motors,2017-9,"Hackett's decision to no longer go it alone in India follows a move to hire an outsider to run Ford's operations in China, and shift production of the Ford Focus for the U.S. market to China, instead of Mexico as previously planned. Hackett has also launched reviews of the company's luxury brand strategy and self-driving car development. [nL1N1KG0XO]"
General Motors,2017-9,Ford and Mahindra said in a joint announcement they would seek ways to collaborate on a wide range of projects for up to three years. Financial terms were not disclosed. Ford shares rose 0.9 percent Monday.
General Motors,2017-9,"Ford president of global markets, Jim Farley, and Ford's head of Asia Pacific operations, Peter Fleet, told Reuters on Monday that teams from the companies will start meeting next week to discuss ways to benefit in the short and medium term."
General Motors,2017-9,"""We are focused on the now and near with this initiative. We want to work on the opportunities that are right in front of us,"" Farley said."
General Motors,2017-9,"In the shorter term, Ford and Mahindra suggested they could benefit from collaborating on distribution of vehicles in India, pooling purchasing and collaborating on forays into ride services."
General Motors,2017-9,Ford and Mahindra had a partnership during the 1990s and early 2000s that involved cross share-holdings.
General Motors,2017-9,"Ford does not break out results from India, but the company reported a pre-tax loss for the second quarter in Asian and Pacific markets outside of China."
General Motors,2017-9,"Longer-term projects could include sharing technology or development efforts for electric vehicles, the companies said. For Ford, the Mahindra deal points to a new strategy for dealing with demands from policymakers in many major markets to phase out petroleum-fueled vehicles in favor of electric cars and trucks."
General Motors,2017-9,"Ford, like global rivals, faces a challenge because electric vehicles engineered for the United States or Europe are too expensive for Indian or Chinese customers. Policymakers in China and India, as well as some European countries, have signaled they want the industry to phase out diesel and gasoline vehicles over the next two to three decades. [nL2N1LT08K]"
General Motors,2017-9,"By allying with Mahindra, Ford can work with the leader in the emerging low-cost electric vehicle market in India. In China, Ford said last month it would pursue a joint venture with Chinese low-cost electric vehicle maker Zotye."
General Motors,2017-9,"""We will certainly be introducing the companies,"" Ford's Fleet said."
General Motors,2017-9,"India is one of the world's fastest-growing car markets. Getting more companies to manufacture in India - both for its own market and for export - is critical for Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government, which needs to create millions of new jobs each year as the workforce expands."
General Motors,2017-9,"However, global car makers like Fiat Chrysler , Volkswagen and General Motors have struggled in India, where nimbler rivals such as Maruti Suzuki and Hyundai Motor <005380.KS> have cornered roughly two-thirds of the market."
General Motors,2017-9,"Turbulence in the Indian economy, and shifts in government policy on vehicle taxes and regulation have further complicated the situation for global automakers. Earlier in September, for example, India's cabinet approved an increase in the maximum levy on luxury cars and sport utility vehicles to as much as 25 percent - less than two months after deciding on a lower rate of 15 percent as part of the new nationwide goods and services tax. [nL4N1LG3HG]"
General Motors,2017-9,"In May, General Motors said it would stop selling cars in India at the end of this year. [nL4N1IK1ZS]"
General Motors,2017-9,Mahindra and Ford said their prospective alliance would give Ford access to Mahindra's distribution network in India while Mahindra would benefit from Ford's market reach in other developing economies.
General Motors,2017-9,"The U.S. company has already invested more than $2 billion in India and plans to spend more to set up a global engineering center in the southern city of Chennai to help adapt products for the local market and changing consumer trends. India has the second-highest number of Ford employees of any country, company officials said. [nL4N1D93H0]"

General Motors,2017-9,* Audi aims to be first to market with 'level three' car
General Motors,2017-9,"FRANKFURT, Sept 18 (Reuters) - German carmaker Audi is taking a lead in bringing more automated driving to roads, but rivals seem in no rush to follow while legal and regulatory uncertainties still cloud the technology."
General Motors,2017-9,"At the Frankfurt car show, Audi paraded the A8 which can drive itself under certain conditions, help the driver to change lanes and does not require drivers to monitor the road - though they must be ready to intervene at the sound of an alarm."
General Motors,2017-9,"On a scale where zero is a fully manual car and five a fully autonomous one, the A8 is a level three, putting it ahead of level two features offered by Tesla and General Motors (GM)."
General Motors,2017-9,"Struggling to emerge from the shadow of parent Volkswagen's diesel emissions scandal, Audi is badly in need of a new prestige model and a marketing coup."
General Motors,2017-9,"""It's gratifying that we are able to set a positive sign for real 'Vorsprung durch Technik',"" said research and development chief Peter Mertens, referring to Audi's advertising slogan meaning ""advancement through technology""."
General Motors,2017-9,"But with special approval still required almost everywhere to drive such a car, and question marks over how quickly the driver has to take back control - and who is responsible during handover - some rivals are sceptical the market is ready."
General Motors,2017-9,"""Who will accept to pay for something that they can use only in extremely limited conditions?"" asked Didier Leroy, European chairman of Japanese carmaker Toyota <7203.T>."
General Motors,2017-9,"""The fact that Audi is introducing this one now doesn't mean that we will rush in the coming months to say that we are able to do it too. That is not our logic,"" he told Reuters at the car show."
General Motors,2017-9,"Among the A8's new features is the ""traffic jam pilot"", which can completely control driving at up to 60 kilometres (37 miles) per hour on a divided highway."
General Motors,2017-9,"The German company expects customers will be able to use all the model's self-driving functions next year or in 2019. It is applying for approval country by country, starting with Germany, a spokesman said during the show."
General Motors,2017-9,"Audi thus hopes to leapfrog Tesla , whose Autopilot technology suffered a major blow when a driver using it was killed in a crash, and GM , whose Super Cruise feature to be offered this autumn will allow limited hands-off driving at highway speeds on limited access roads like dual carriageways."
General Motors,2017-9,"In the wake of the crash, Tesla said the driver was using Autopilot in conditions for which it was not intended, and U.S. regulators said automakers should take steps to make sure semi-autonomous systems are not misused. [nL2N1LT0T4]"
General Motors,2017-9,"Regulatory regimes vary widely across the world and, in the United States, even from state to state, creating a headache for manufacturers. Some authorities would rather they held back."
General Motors,2017-9,"""We're very concerned about the idea that drivers will be encouraged to pay even less attention than they already are and that manufacturers are rolling out these systems without existing federal standards,"" Linda Bailey, executive director of the U.S. National Association of City Transportation Officials, told Reuters."
General Motors,2017-9,"Florida, seen as the least restrictive state, has essentially legalised all forms of autonomous driving without the need for a permit or insurance requirements. New York, at the other end of the spectrum, has a law that demands drivers always have at least one hand on the wheel."
General Motors,2017-9,"Michael Jellen, president of Velodyne, which develops lidar sensing technology that is used in autonomous cars, said the industry still had a long way to go."
General Motors,2017-9,"""When they truly launch a hands-free, driver disengagement system, that's when we think (the industry) will have evolved,"" he said in an interview. ""Today, when someone has their hands on the wheel and their foot ready to brake, I call that driving."""
General Motors,2017-9,"In Europe, Germany is the pioneer, having passed a law in May that legalises autonomous driving in principle as long as a licensed driver is behind the wheel - although approval still has to be sought for individual models."
General Motors,2017-9,German politicians hope to persuade the European Union to adopt common regulations to speed adoption of autonomous driving and prevent self-driving systems from having to switch themselves off or change parameters when they encounter national borders - so-called geofencing.
General Motors,2017-9,German Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt hosted ministers from France and Luxembourg at the Frankfurt show on Thursday to establish a cross-border testing ground.
General Motors,2017-9,"In an attempt to address one area of uncertainty, Audi says it will assume liability for any accidents that happen when its automated driving technology is in use."
General Motors,2017-9,"While Audi has not yet fixed premiums for level three technology, the base price for the A8 without optional extra technology is already 90,600 euros ($108,000)."
General Motors,2017-9,"Though level three, unlike level two, means theoretically the driver need no longer monitor the road while the car is in charge, the need to potentially jump in to take control limits the activities the driver can do when not in charge."
General Motors,2017-9,"""It sets an expectation to the driver that the computer is in control - that's what level three means. It means I can sit back and read a book,"" said Gartner analyst Mike Ramsey."
General Motors,2017-9,"Autopilot features have long been used in aeroplanes, but the situation is very different there, where a pilot typically has plenty of time to react."
General Motors,2017-9,"""It's very, very rare to face another plane coming just in front of you and just to react in two seconds to avoid a crash. In the car, it's possible,"" Toyota's Leroy said."
General Motors,2017-9,"Even then, the hand-off from computer to pilot can be bungled, resulting in crashes such as an Asiana flight into San Francisco in 2013 that killed three people and injured scores."
General Motors,2017-9,Some question the worth of introducing level three at all at this stage.
General Motors,2017-9,"German automotive supplier Continental , with 1.2 billion euros in assisted driving component sales last year, said industry experts were questioning whether the grey zone in which neither the driver nor the car was clearly in control could be overcome."
General Motors,2017-9,"""There is a discussion going on at the moment as to whether one shouldn't skip level three after implementing level two,"" Chief Executive Elmar Degenhart told Reuters at the show."
General Motors,2017-9,"Bosch [ROBG.UL], the world's biggest automotive supplier, said it was seeing great demand for level three technology. [nL5N1LS5NZ]"
General Motors,2017-9,"Yet at its presentation at the show, it did not talk about autonomous driving in general, but rather only particular applications to solve particular problems, such as an automated valet parking garage it has built with Mercedes maker Daimler in Stuttgart, which should go into service next year."
General Motors,2017-9,"""Everything we do in driver assistance has a mass-market use,"" Bosch mobility chief Rolf Bulander said. ""We're not interested in inventing things that will become reality only in a decade."""
General Motors,2017-9,"France's PSA Group , which is developing autonomous driving technology with partners for its future Peugeot, Citroen, Opel and DS vehicles, said there was still value in technology that needed human oversight and regular intervention - with the right framework of rules."
General Motors,2017-9,"""It still allows you to send and receive emails or read, even while staying on the alert,"" programmes and strategy chief Patrice Lucas told Reuters. ""The biggest hurdles are regulatory."""

General Motors,2017-9,"Sept 18 (Reuters) - Canada's Unifor union said its members at General Motors Co's CAMI auto assembly plant in Ingersoll, Ontario, went on strike as of late Sunday evening after talks on a tentative agreement with the automaker failed."
General Motors,2017-9,The union was in talks with GM about the company's decision to cut jobs and shift some production work to Mexico. [nL1N1G128O]
General Motors,2017-9,"In July, GM stopped production of its Terrain sport utility vehicle in Ingersoll, and 100 percent of the volume was moved to Mexico, resulting in 600 layoffs. [nCNWYQYTZa]"
General Motors,2017-9,"A central priority for the union is a commitment from the company to designate the CAMI plant as the lead producer of the Chevrolet Equinox, Unifor said in a statement."
General Motors,2017-9,"The plant now only produces the Equinox, which is also manufactured in Mexico."
General Motors,2017-9,"As of Sept 1, GM only had enough inventory of the Equinox model to last 53 days, a rather tight level of supply for the automaker. But with production of the model in Mexico, GM is better placed to withstand the impact of a strike."
General Motors,2017-9,"The union had blamed the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and Mexico's cheaper labor costs for the job losses, which it called unjustified given strong sales of the Equinox crossover and Terrain assembled at the southern Ontario plant."
General Motors,2017-9,"""Every member understands the importance of reaching a deal that secures production, and what that means to our families and the community,"" said Mike Van Boekel, Local 88 Chair at the CAMI plant."

General Motors,2017-9,{{20170915T131517.686+0000}}Energy firms battle startups to wire Europe's highways for electric cars* Major European utilities link up with EV charging startups
General Motors,2017-9,"PARIS/FRANKFURT, Sept 15 (Reuters) - The battle over how and where Europeans charge their electric cars is expanding from the continent's cities to its motorways."
General Motors,2017-9,"Refuelling conventional petrol and diesel cars on motorways has long been the domain of the oil companies, which typically have their own networks of filling stations. Several are now talking about setting up high-power charging networks, creating major competition for limited space at motorway service areas."
General Motors,2017-9,"""It is a bit of a landgrab now to win this sector,"" said Tim Payne, chief executive of British charging start-up InstaVolt, which has raised 12 million pounds ($16 million) to install 3,000 charge points across Britain by 2020."
General Motors,2017-9,"While the range of electric vehicles (EVs) was less than 100 km (60 miles), Europe's utilities were happy to help cities and companies install slow and inexpensive charging points at homes, offices and shops, often supported by state subsidies."
General Motors,2017-9,"But Tesla , Porsche and BMW are now making battery-powered cars with enough range to drive across countries. Daimler and Volkswagen also announced plans on the eve of this week's Frankfurt motor show to accelerate their shift to electric cars."
General Motors,2017-9,"Charging infrastructure remains nowhere near it needs to be. ""Where is the network of charging points that will be required? Indeed where is the power and the grid?"" Ralf Speth, boss of Britain's Jaguar Land Rover, asked last week."
General Motors,2017-9,"Experts including ChargePoint and Engie are, however, making plans to build pan-European networks of high-voltage fast-charging stations which can refill a battery in less than half an hour instead of overnight."
General Motors,2017-9,"In Britain, InstaVolt is renting land from filling station operators, bringing them additional revenue from the lease as well as the increased traffic to their shops at the sites. It earns a margin by selling power through the chargers."
General Motors,2017-9,"InstaVolt struck a deal in May with ChargePoint, which itself is on a $125 million expansion spree in Europe, to install about 200 of the U.S. group's ultra-fast chargers close to popular roads across Britain."
General Motors,2017-9,"Morgan Stanley estimates that 1-3 million public charging points could be needed in western Europe by 2030, adding that while utilities have natural skills in the new industry, it was too early to determine who will come put on top. ""The winning business model is up for grabs,"" it said."
General Motors,2017-9,"Today, there are fewer than 100,000 public charging points available in Europe, with only about six percent of them fast, according to the International Energy Agency."
General Motors,2017-9,"Almost none of these is super-fast, a term usually used for charging stations with an output of at least 150 kilowatts. More than three times faster than current-generation chargers, they are now being targeted by those trying to become market leaders."
General Motors,2017-9,"Contenders include Dutch EV-Box, one of Europe's biggest makers of charging stations, which was snapped up by French utility Engie in March."
General Motors,2017-9,"""We expect hundreds of millions of annual revenue from EV-Box in a few years,"" Thierry Lepercq, head of innovation at Engie, told Reuters. He sees Engie's EV charging revenue growing by a factor of 20 in three to five years. Last year, EV-Box had sales of 16 million euros ($19.1 million)."
General Motors,2017-9,"EV-Box Chief Executive Kristof Vereenooghe said that unlike most of its competitors EV-Box has been profitable from the start, a claim that makes it stand out in an industry where gaining scale is considered more important for now."
General Motors,2017-9,"That's why German utility E.ON , too, announced a strategic partnership with Danish startup CLEVER and said it had the ambition to roll out several hundred ultra-fast charging stations along European motorways."
General Motors,2017-9,"CLEVER, which is owned by a group of Danish utilities and runs charging networks in Denmark, Sweden and Germany, wants to extend its network to France, Britain and Italy with E.ON."
General Motors,2017-9,"The firm, which unlike EV-Box and ChargePoint does not make its own hardware, is also still looking for other partners. ""We want to connect cities so that you can easily drive across Europe in an electric vehicle,"" CLEVER Chief Executive Casper Kirketerp-Moeller said."
General Motors,2017-9,"Among the oil majors, BP , Shell and have all either announced plans or launched pilot projects for EV charging. Few people, however, expect them to become serious contenders for a business that would effectively curb demand for their chief product: oil."
General Motors,2017-9,BP did not respond to repeated requests for comment. A spokeswoman for Shell said it did not make economic sense yet to equip petrol stations fully with EV charging points.
General Motors,2017-9,"""People like Shell and Total talk a lot, but nothing happens. We are putting the grid connection in place,"" said Michiel Langezaal, founder and chief executive of Fastned, which has 63 EV charging stations in the Netherlands."
General Motors,2017-9,"Leasing plots of land, the group wants to raise 100 million euros over the next two years to branch out into Germany, Belgium, France and Britain. So far it gets the stations from Swiss ABB but is also in talks with ChargePoint."
General Motors,2017-9,"Unlike utilities and charging station startups, electric vehicle makers see fast charging networks not as a profit centre, but as a loss-leader needed to persuade customers that electric vehicles can drive across continents."
General Motors,2017-9,"Tesla, for example, operates a proprietary charging network throughout Europe, mainly in hotels, but it is stretched thinly - in the Ile de France region around Paris it has just a handful of ""superchargers""."
General Motors,2017-9,"This year, the group's market valuation surpassed that of General Motors , making it the biggest U.S. carmaker by that measure."
General Motors,2017-9,"""Tesla has never been in the black, but had enormous growth,"" said Elke Temme, who co-heads the e-mobility unit of Germany's Innogy ."

General Motors,2017-9,"China, the world's largest auto market, is pushing hard to develop its own green car market, with stringent quotas planned for carmakers and a longer-term aim to ban the production and sale of cars that use traditional fuels. [nL4N1LR023]"
General Motors,2017-9,"Carmakers, however, worry that targets for electric and hybrid cars may be tough to meet, especially as the government plans to roll back by 2020 subsidies that have supported the market's rapid growth."
General Motors,2017-9,"""While we are exploring all channels to boost NEV sales, building raw consumer acceptance of NEVs will depend on continued joint effort between the government and automakers,"" Barra said at a company event in Shanghai."
General Motors,2017-9,"She added that China's push did create an opportunity for the U.S. firm, which plans to introduce at least 10 new NEVs for the China market by 2020 and open a battery plant this year with domestic partner SAIC Motor Corp Ltd <600104.SS>."
General Motors,2017-9,"Asked about China's long-term plans to ban traditional gasoline cars - similar to moves in Britain and France - Barra said the shift was pushing GM to invest more in the area: ""That's why we're investing so heavy in electrification."""
General Motors,2017-9,"China has set goals for electric and plug-in hybrid cars to make up at least a fifth of auto sales by 2025, as it combats air pollution and aims to close a competitive gap between newer domestic automakers and global rivals."
General Motors,2017-9,"In July, Reuters reported global makers were urging China to delay and soften planned quotas for NEVs, which they said would be impossible to meet and would hit their business. [nL8N1K44FT]"
General Motors,2017-9,"Barra added the firm would work to ""the timetable of governments"", but consumers also needed to be convinced."

General Motors,2017-9,"WASHINGTON, Sept 12 (Reuters) - The head of the 1.4-million member International Brotherhood of Teamsters union is mounting an aggressive effort to convince Congress to reject new rules to speed the deployment of self-driving trucks, warning they could lead to the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs and reduce road safety."
General Motors,2017-9,"James P. Hoffa, who has headed the union since 1999, said on Tuesday that Congress could help major trucking companies ultimately get rid of drivers by automating vehicles, which would also pose serious risks to American drivers."
General Motors,2017-9,"""I'm concerned about highway safety. I am concerned about jobs,"" Hoffa said in an interview at Teamsters headquarters. ""I am concerned we are moving too fast in a very, very strategic area that we have to make sure we are doing it right because lives are involved."""
General Motors,2017-9,"Hoffa's worries come as technology industry executives and policy makers grapple with the possible impact of artificial intelligence and robotics on jobs and the economy, potentially putting millions of people out of work."
General Motors,2017-9,"Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao has said she is ""very concerned"" about the impact of self-driving cars on U.S. jobs, a central theme of President Donald Trump's campaign message. The Teamsters have many members in key battleground Midwestern states."
General Motors,2017-9,Auto industry leaders have said 3 million commercial truck jobs could eventually be at risk if self-driving vehicles replaced human drivers.
General Motors,2017-9,"The U.S. House last week unanimously approved a bill that would hasten the use of self-driving cars without human controls and bar states from blocking autonomous vehicles. The measure applies only to vehicles under 10,000 pounds (4,536 kg) and not large commercial trucks."
General Motors,2017-9,"The U.S. Senate is considering a similar draft measure that could include commercial trucks. On Wednesday, the Senate Commerce Committee is holding a hearing on the potential of self-driving trucks."
General Motors,2017-9,"Teamsters General Secretary-Treasurer Ken Hall will testify at the hearing, as will Navistar International Corp Chief Executive Troy Clarke and the head of the American Trucking Association."
General Motors,2017-9,"Hall will portray allowing autonomous commercial trucks as ""fundamentally different, and potentially more calamitous than those facing passenger cars."""
General Motors,2017-9,"The Senate must ""help ensure that workers are not left behind in this process,"" according to an advance copy of Hall's testimony. ""It is essential that American workers are not treated as guinea pigs for unproven technologies that could put their lives at risk."""
General Motors,2017-9,"Congress must consider ""the potential impact on the livelihoods and wages of millions of your constituents,"" he added."
General Motors,2017-9,"Self-driving proponents note 94 percent of U.S. car crashes are the result of human error and argue self-driving cars could dramatically cut the 35,000 annual road deaths."
General Motors,2017-9,Autonomous vehicles also have potential to dramatically cut congestion and open transportation options for the disabled and blind. It is unclear if driverless cars would boost car sales or reduce individual car ownership.
General Motors,2017-9,Tech firms and shipping companies are bullish on the prospects for self-driving trucks.
General Motors,2017-9,"Alphabet Inc's self-driving car unit, Waymo, is working on developing self-driving trucks, the company said in June.

General Motors,2017-9,"Tesla Inc , which is developing self-driving technologies, has said it plans to unveil a commercial truck called the Tesla Semi in September."
General Motors,2017-9,"Hoffa said the union was not trying to hold back technological advancements. ""Obviously we can't stop progress,"" he said. ""This is not like a widget - a machine that paints the side of a Buick ... Here is a safety issue. This is not the same as the production line at General Motors ."""
General Motors,2017-9,Hoffa said more government research is needed before self-driving cars should be deployed for use and questioned if the vehicles could be used in inclement weather. He said Congress must address liability issues.
General Motors,2017-9,"""Big business is running this,"" Hoffa said, citing large automakers and shipping firms lobbying on Capitol Hill. The goal of shipping firms he asserted is to ""get drivers out of the seat and make money."""

General Motors,2017-9,"FRANKFURT, Sept 12 (Reuters) - PSA Group's Chief Executive Carlos Tavares said on Tuesday European policymakers were responsible for the fate of 800 jobs at Opel's engine testing facility, given that many are under threat from a regulatory push to promote electric cars."
General Motors,2017-9,"PSA is in the process of integrating Opel, after buying it from General Motors , a task which analysts say will lead to sweeping job cuts since most vehicles will be migrated to platforms engineered by the French carmaker."

General Motors,2017-9,"If European policymakers are advocating a ban on combustion engines then this has consequences also for the auto industry as a whole, Tavares said."
General Motors,2017-9,"""Well this is the decision made by the governments, to forbid the usage of the internal combustion engine, this is not my decision .... If they decide that, my role as the president of the company is to comply."""
General Motors,2017-9,"PSA Group and Opel will have to ""reorganise ourselves in a way which is adapted to the new reality which is that governments want electrification."""
General Motors,2017-9,"Tavares said the transformation will include a need to retrain people to a new era for electric cars. A PSA spokesman later added that each new Opel incorporating PSA technologies model will need to be tested individually, a step which creates work for Opel's engineers."
General Motors,2017-9,"In an earlier discussion with journalists on Tuesday, Tavares had said he would need the engineers in Ruesselsheim ""110 percent."""
General Motors,2017-9,"However, with European politicians pushing electrification, Europe's industry may run the risk of taking a large bet on one particular technology."
General Motors,2017-9,"""The scientific responsibility of selecting one technology and instructing the carmakers to go in this direction, this scientific responsibility is in the hands of the governments,"" Tavares said."

General Motors,2017-9,"Early government assurances that free trade with the European Union would survive Britain's departure have been replaced by talk of transition periods, Toyota Executive Vice President Didier Leroy told Reuters."
General Motors,2017-9,"""A few months ago the UK government was saying, 'We're sure we'll be able to negotiate (a deal) without any trade tax,'"" Leroy said in an interview at the Frankfurt car show. ""They are not saying that any more."""
General Motors,2017-9,"He added: ""It's clear that if we have to wait two to three more years to have a clarity on this topic, we will have a big question-mark about our future investment in the country."""
General Motors,2017-9,"Brexit talks have become bogged down in recent weeks, with the EU's chief negotiator saying not enough progress had been made to begin discussing a free trade deal, amid differences over the size of the ""divorce settlement"" London should pay."
General Motors,2017-9,Britain's car industry is increasingly anxious that its exports could face tariffs and other barriers after 2019.
General Motors,2017-9,"PSA Group boss Carlos Tavares sounded an impatient note on Tuesday, saying Brexit uncertainties were complicating integration with Opel and its British Vauxhall plants, acquired by the Peugeot maker from General Motors ."
General Motors,2017-9,"""Until we have more visibility on the trade dimension it's very hard to define a strategy,"" Tavares said in Frankfurt."
General Motors,2017-9,"Jaguar Land Rover , Britain's biggest automaker, also warned last week that Brexit was already deterring EU workers and suppliers. [nL8N1LO3QJ]"

General Motors,2017-9,"But Leroy, Toyota's top foreign executive, said the company could not wait indefinitely before deciding whether to build a new model at the site after production of the ageing Avensis model ends. Burnaston also builds the smaller Auris."
General Motors,2017-9,"""We cannot take this kind of decision before we have clarity on the future trade relationship,"" said Leroy."
General Motors,2017-9,"""We will not close the plant tomorrow morning, but if in two to three years we have to decide some future investments, of course the key point will be the competitiveness of this plant in future."""
General Motors,2017-9,"Leroy declined to say how much of the upgrade funds had already been spent, stressing that considerably larger sums would be needed to launch production of any new vehicles."
General Motors,2017-9,"Without further investment, Burnaston's output ""will probably start to decline before we will be able to take a decision,"" Leroy said. ""The longer we have to wait, the more potential there is to move to another factory."""
General Motors,2017-9,"He added: ""We will not postpone a new product for three more years just because the negotiation is going to take three more years. So really there's a strong need for us to have clarity as quickly as possible."""

General Motors,2017-9,"PSA is in the process of integrating Opel, after buying it from General Motors , a task which analysts say will lead to sweeping job cuts since most vehicles will be migrated to platforms engineered by the French carmaker."
General Motors,2017-9,"Some 800 of Opel's 7,700 engineers work at its seven-story engine development centre in Ruesselsheim, Germany, where the carmaker has 45 state-of-the-art engine test benches."
General Motors,2017-9,"With several European ministers warning carmakers about potential bans on combustion-engined cars, Tavares said he could not be held responsible for the fate of those jobs."
General Motors,2017-9,"""Well this is the decision made by the governments, to forbid the usage of the internal combustion engine, this is not my decision .... If they decide that, my role as the president of the company is to comply."""
General Motors,2017-9,"PSA Group and Opel will have to ""reorganise ourselves in a way which is adapted to the new reality which is that governments want electrification."""
General Motors,2017-9,"With governments pushing electrification, Europe's industry is taking a significant bet."
General Motors,2017-9,"""The scientific responsibility of selecting one technology and instructing the carmakers to go in this direction, this scientific responsibility is in the hands of the governments,"" Tavares said."
General Motors,2017-9,"""If you ask everybody to make electric vehicles and you cannot subsidise them, then you have to raise prices or you have to smash the margins of the companies, and then you have a problem of the sustainability of the companies,"" he added."

General Motors,2017-9,PSA Chief Executive Carlos Tavares said in May he expects Opel to lose more money in 2017.
General Motors,2017-9,"Opel was lossmaking for the past 16 years in part because the carmaker was forced to spend roughly $1 billion a year on research and development to help keep small and compact vehicles compliant with new European anti-pollution rules, which differ substantially from those in the United States or China."

General Motors,2017-9,"DETROIT, Sept 1 (Reuters) - Shares of the Big Three Detroit automakers rose on Friday despite lackluster August sales, with investors focusing on a likely surge in demand as residents of the U.S. Gulf Coast replace flood-damaged cars and trucks."
General Motors,2017-9,"Overall U.S. car and light truck sales fell in August to a seasonally adjusted annual selling pace of 16.03 million vehicles, according to WardsAuto, down from a 17.13 million vehicle pace a year ago. U.S. auto sales have been slowing for much of the year."
General Motors,2017-9,"Still, analysts focused on the potential for Detroit automakers to cut inventories and stabilize used vehicle prices as Gulf Coast residents must replace tens of thousands of vehicles ruined by flood damage.

General Motors,2017-9,"Ford is the No. 1 automaker in the Houston market with 18 percent share, according to IHS Markit. The company plans to ship used vehicles to Houston dealers, and has ""every indication we would have to add some production"" of new vehicles to meet demand, LaNeve said."
General Motors,2017-9,"Investor concerns about inventories of unsold vehicles and falling used car prices have weighed on Detroit automakers' shares most of this year. Now, automakers can anticipate a jolt of demand from a big market that is a stronghold for Detroit brand trucks and SUVs."
General Motors,2017-9,"""It's got to be a positive for the industry,"" LaNeve said."
General Motors,2017-9,"GM got a lift from robust sales of crossovers across its four brands. The largest U.S. automaker by sales plans to move used vehicles into Houston, and expressed confidence it can reduce inventories to 850,000 or fewer vehicles by year end."

General Motors,2017-9,"Aug 31 (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives will vote Wednesday on a sweeping proposal to speed the deployment of self-driving cars without human controls and bar states from blocking autonomous vehicles, congressional aides said."
General Motors,2017-9,"The bill, which was passed unanimously by a House panel in July, would allow automakers to obtain exemptions to deploy up to 25,000 vehicles without meeting existing auto safety standards in the first year, a cap that would rise to 100,000 vehicles annually over three years."
General Motors,2017-9,"Automakers and technology companies including General Motors Co and Alphabet Inc's' self-driving unit Waymo have been pushing for new federal rules making it easier to deploy self-driving technology. Meanwhile, some consumer groups have sought additional safeguards."
General Motors,2017-9,The bill will be voted under fast-track rules that do not allow for amendments. A bipartisan group of U.S. senators has been working on similar legislation but has not introduced a bill.
General Motors,2017-9,"""Self-driving vehicles stand to make our transportation system safer and more efficient. Advancing this technology to road-ready requires government policy that encourages continued testing and development,"" House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, a Republican, said in a statement. ""This formula is the foundation for what makes America the most innovative country in the world."""
General Motors,2017-9,"The Alliance of Automobile Manufacters, a trade group, said in a statement that ""Congress can bring a host of benefits to Americans by helping to bring self-driving vehicles to our roads as quickly as possible."""

General Motors,2017-9,"The issue has taken on new urgency since U.S. road deaths rose 7.7 percent in 2015, the highest annual jump since 1966."
General Motors,2017-9,Automakers and technology companies believe chances are good that Congress will approve legislation before year end. Current federal rules bar self-driving cars without human controls on U.S. roads and automakers think proposed state rules in California are too restrictive.
General Motors,2017-9,"The measure, the first significant federal legislation aimed at speeding self-driving cars to market, would require automakers to submit safety assessment reports to regulators, but would not require pre-market approval of advanced vehicle technologies."
General Motors,2017-9,"Initially, authors proposed to allow automakers and others to sell up to 100,000 vehicles immediately. Representative Frank Pallone, a Democrat, said the phase-in period was essential so ""millions of exempted cars will not hit our roads all at once."""
General Motors,2017-9,Manufacturers must demonstrate self-driving cars winning exemptions are at least as safe as existing vehicles.
General Motors,2017-9,"Under the House proposal, states could still set rules on registration, licensing, liability, insurance and safety inspections, but could not set self-driving car performance standards."
