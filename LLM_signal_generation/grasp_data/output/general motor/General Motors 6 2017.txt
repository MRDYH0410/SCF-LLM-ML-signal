General Motors,2017-6,"{{20170629T145104.395+0000}}Merkel avoids backing diesel as hits out at emissions cheats BERLIN, June 29 (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel, a fierce defender of the country's powerful auto industry, appeared to accept the days of the combustion engine may be numbered, as she hit out at carmakers accused of cheating diesel emissions tests."
General Motors,2017-6,"In an interview with the Wirtschaftswoche magazine published on Thursday, Merkel did not give a clear commitment to the diesel technology that her government has promoted to help cut carbon dioxide emissions and fight climate change."
General Motors,2017-6,"""What is important is that the newest and best technology is used,"" she was quoted as saying. ""We are in a transformation phase away from the combustion engine."""
General Motors,2017-6,Merkel's comments - almost two years after the Volkswagen emissions scandal broke - come as her government faces growing pressure ahead of national elections on Sept. 24 to reduce diesel pollution or see cities impose driving bans.
General Motors,2017-6,"Sales of diesel cars have been falling since the VW scandal, but have dropped faster since cities, including Stuttgart and Munich, have considered banning some diesel vehicles, blaming emissions for a rise in respiratory disease. [nL8N1JB2J8]"
General Motors,2017-6,"On Tuesday, German ministers announced they would establish a national ""diesel forum"" to find ways to cut pollution and set up a new organisation to test vehicles. [nL8N1JO12V]"
General Motors,2017-6,"On Wednesday, German carmakers BMW , Audi and truck manufacturer MAN agreed with the regional government in Bavaria to cut nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions from diesel engines, a likely precursor to the national plan."
General Motors,2017-6,"Foreign carmakers have not yet committed to cutting emissions but will likely do so by the Aug. 2 meeting of the government's ""diesel forum"" on Aug. 2, the German auto importers' association VDIK said on Thursday."
General Motors,2017-6,"Germany's ADAC car club, Europe's largest and most influential, has warned consumers to push back planned purchases of diesel cars until cleaner Euro-6D technology becomes available in new models this autumn. [nL8N1JP3A7]"
General Motors,2017-6,"Merkel said how fast the shift away from combustion engines took place had to be negotiated, with efficient combustion engines likely to still have a long future, perhaps combined with electric motors in hybrid cars."
General Motors,2017-6,"Last month, she admitted Germany was likely to miss the government's target of bringing 1 million electric cars onto the roads by the end of the decade, but added the breakthrough could come very abruptly, as with the smartphone."
General Motors,2017-6,"Merkel, who has been criticised by environmental and consumer groups for defending the diesel industry since the VW scandal, hit out at manufacturers that cheat emissions tests."
General Motors,2017-6,"""There is nothing that can justify the fraudulent methods used to limit test values in the diesel area of some manufacturers that has damaged the whole diesel business,"" she said."
General Motors,2017-6,"""For many years we have appreciated diesel because it helped save fuel and CO2,"" she said, adding some things had to be re-evaluated."

General Motors,2017-6,"WASHINGTON, June 28 (Reuters) - Auto industry trade groups said on Wednesday that tightening the rules of origin in the North American Free Trade Agreement could be disruptive and hurt the competitiveness of U.S., Mexican and Canadian auto plants."
General Motors,2017-6,"Their testimony at a public hearing ahead of NAFTA renegotiations, expected to start Aug. 17, contrasted sharply with frequent comments from U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross that the trade pact's local content rules are an area that needs strengthening to avoid being used as a ""back door"" for Chinese auto parts."
General Motors,2017-6,"Matt Blunt, president of the American Automotive Policy Council, said the current NAFTA 62.5 percent local content requirement was working just fine and ""strikes the right balance"" for encouraging local manufacturing investment and keeping the industry's costs competitive."
General Motors,2017-6,"Blunt, whose group represents Detroit automakers General Motors, Ford and Fiat Chrysler urged a ""very cautions and careful"" approach for any origin rule changes and discussed the affects of stricter enforcement."
General Motors,2017-6,"""It could make us less competitive as compared to our international peers and affect our ability to export,"" Blunt said."
General Motors,2017-6,"""It could deny us access to supply chains which would drive up costs and could affect sales and ultimately employment within the industry."""
General Motors,2017-6,Ross has said that NAFTA's rules of origin need tightening to avoid producers from outside the region to benefit from tariff-free access to the U.S. market. He also has noted that vehicles now have many new electronic components that were not contemplated when the pact was negotiated in the early 1990s.
General Motors,2017-6,"But Blunt disputed that the origin rules were allowing China to benefit from NAFTA in a major way, arguing that Chinese components make up less than six percent of the value of North American-built vehicles."
General Motors,2017-6,"His comments were seconded by representatives of other groups, including the Motor Equipment Manufacturers Association (MEMA), representing parts makers, the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, which includes Detroit and foreign automakers building vehicles in the United States, and the Association Global Automakers, a group that represents international automakers that sell into the U.S. market."
General Motors,2017-6,"Leigh Merino, senior director of regulatory affairs for MEMA, said auto components and subsystems in particular depend on complex ""ecosystem"" of diverse parts suppliers and small changes to this ""can be extremely disruptive."""
General Motors,2017-6,"Nonetheless, the trade groups said that they were not opposed to examining ways to improve the rules."
General Motors,2017-6,"The NAFTA hearings, which allow industry groups and companies to express views on the U.S. negotiating objectives for the talks are expected to conclude on Thursday."

General Motors,2017-6,"WASHINGTON, June 27 (Reuters) - Republicans and Democrats in Congress sparred on Tuesday over U.S. states setting rules for testing and deployment of self-driving cars and a proposal to allow automakers and technology companies to bypass existing regulations in introducing autonomous cars."
General Motors,2017-6,Democrats on a U.S. House Energy and Commerce subcommittee said that the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) must play a more aggressive role in mandating self-driving car safety.
General Motors,2017-6,"A Republican draft package of 14 bills would allow NHTSA to exempt up to 100,000 vehicles per year from federal motor vehicle safety rules, which currently prevent the sale of self-driving vehicles without human controls. It would also bar states from setting self-driving rules and prevent NHTSA from preapproving self-driving car technologies. [nL1N1JC229]"
General Motors,2017-6,"""We simply cannot have cars that stop at state lines,"" Representative Robert Latta said at a hearing of the subcommittee. ""This isn't the government saying you have to get in a self-driving car. This is government make sure that industry can innovate."""
General Motors,2017-6,Latta said he hoped to win committee approval of a bipartisan legislative package by the end of July.
General Motors,2017-6,"General Motors Co , Alphabet Inc , Tesla Inc and others have been lobbying Congress to pre-empt rules under consideration in California and other states that could limit self-driving vehicle deployment."
General Motors,2017-6,"Representative Frank Pallone, a Democrat, said that under the Republican proposal, states would be barred from regulating self-driving car safety ""without a guarantee that NHTSA will step in"" to set binding rules. ""We need to be sure that we get this right and that safety is the first priority,"" Pallone said."
General Motors,2017-6,"Democrats noted that the administration of President Donald Trump, a Republican, has not nominated a candidate to head NHTSA, which has a number of vacant senior positions. NHTSA did not sent an official to testify."
General Motors,2017-6,"Two automaker trade associations said in testimony it is essential they do not face a ""patchwork"" of self-driving state rules. They said NHTSA will have to approve exemptions."
General Motors,2017-6,"Republicans, citing competition from other countries and the rising number of traffic deaths, say it is urgent Congress approve sweeping legislation to ensure automakers and technology companies test the vehicles inside the United States."
General Motors,2017-6,The administration of former Democratic President Barack Obama last year unveiled voluntary guidelines on self-driving cars. Trump's Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao has vowed to quickly update those. [nL1N1J21LZ]

General Motors,2017-6,* German government under fire for cosy ties to car industry
General Motors,2017-6,"BERLIN, June 27 (Reuters) - Germany will discuss a national plan to cut pollution from diesel engines and set up a new organisation to test vehicles to try to restore consumer confidence after Volkswagen's emissions scandal, ministers said on Tuesday."
General Motors,2017-6,The moves - almost two years after the Volkswagen scandal broke - come as the German government faces growing pressure ahead of national elections on Sept. 24 to reduce emissions or see some cities ban diesel cars themselves.
General Motors,2017-6,"On Monday, Reuters reported the transport ministry was pushing carmakers to update engine management software to cut pollution in up to 12 million diesel vehicles in the country, citing people familiar with the talks. [nL8N1JN2OW]"
General Motors,2017-6,"On Tuesday, the transport ministry and the environment ministry announced the creation of a ""national diesel forum"" to work with the auto industry and regional governments to cut emissions, with the first meeting set for Aug. 2."
General Motors,2017-6,"""We want emissions to fall across Germany,"" Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt said in a statement."
General Motors,2017-6,"Dobrindt, a member of the Bavarian sister party to Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats, has come under fire for being close to the country's powerful car industry and for not doing enough to combat vehicle pollution."
General Motors,2017-6,"Government sources told Reuters on Monday the software update could cost 1.5 billion to 2.5 billion euros ($1.7 billion to $2.8 billion), but HSBC analysts said hardware might be needed that could mean costs of up to 10 billion euros."

General Motors,2017-6,"Environment Minister Barbara Hendricks, a member of the centre-left Social Democrats that are Merkel's junior coalition partners, said the diesel forum was an opportunity for carmakers to win back lost trust and improve air quality."
General Motors,2017-6,"Separately, the transport ministry said it was setting up a new institute to ensure ""more transparency and reliability"" in vehicle tests, involving consumer organisations, local governments and environmental groups, as well as the auto industry and ministries."
General Motors,2017-6,"However, the KBA motor vehicle authority, which reports to the transport ministry and currently oversees vehicle testing, will remain responsible for licensing new models."
General Motors,2017-6,"The ministry said the new institute would test about 70 car models a year using realistic driving scenarios, rather than relying solely on laboratory conditions, and the emissions and fuel consumption results would be made public to allow car buyers to make better comparisons."
General Motors,2017-6,"It noted that current official tests do not take into account factors such as the use of air conditioning and radio, or the weather or style of driving, which all influence fuel consumption."
General Motors,2017-6,Germany's VDA auto industry association said in a statement its members were keen to give customers more information about variance in fuel efficiency and would fully participate in the new institute in the interests of more transparency.
General Motors,2017-6,"However, the environmentalist Greens questioned how independent the new institute would be given the car industry is set to pay its annual budget of 2 million euros."
General Motors,2017-6,"In the aftermath of the Volkswagen scandal, the German transport ministry ordered tests on the carbon dioxide emissions of 29 models. On Tuesday, it said 17 passed the test, while 10 models still needed to be tested in the coming months."
General Motors,2017-6,"However, some versions of an Opel Zafira car and a Smart For Two produced by Daimler emitted more carbon dioxide than they should, although the Smart model still needed to undergo further tests. Both versions of the models in question are now discontinued."
General Motors,2017-6,"Zafira diesels already on the road will have to undergo a software update, the ministry said, although the licences for both vehicles will not be withdrawn."
General Motors,2017-6,"Opel said the Zafira had passed all legal tests, noting fewer than 3,800 of the model in question had been sold in Germany."
General Motors,2017-6,"European governments have promoted diesel cars as part of efforts to fight climate change as they produce less carbon dioxide than petrol cars, although environmental groups have cast doubt over how much less they produce and have focused instead on the levels of toxic nitrogen oxides they emit."

General Motors,2017-6,"WASHINGTON, June 23 (Reuters) - Automakers are using tiny cameras, sensors to track drooping heads, steering wheel monitors and audible alerts to ensure drivers pay attention when using advanced driver assistance systems, like Tesla's Autopilot, that allow drivers to take their hands off the wheel."
General Motors,2017-6,"In a report this week on the May 2016 crash of a Tesla Inc Model S that killed a driver who was using Autopilot, the National Transportation Safety Board demonstrated that users could mostly keep their hands off the wheel for extended periods despite repeated warnings from the vehicle."
General Motors,2017-6,"But the crash underscored a vexing problem for automakers that want to gain an edge by launching technology that completely automates driving tasks. Unless a car is capable of driving itself safely in every situation, drivers will still have to remain alert and ready to take control even if the car is piloting itself."
General Motors,2017-6,"The NTSB, the federal agency charged with investigating significant transportation accidents, said during a 37-minute section of the 41-minute Tesla trip, the driver kept his hands on the wheel for just 25 seconds, putting his hands on the wheel for one- to- three second increments after getting repeated visual and audible warnings."
General Motors,2017-6,General Motors Co delayed introduction of a driver assistance technology called Super Cruise that was initially planned for late last year because it said it was not ready. The technology will go on sale this fall.
General Motors,2017-6,"Barry Walkup, chief engineer of Super Cruise, said the company added ""a driver attention function, to insist on driver supervision."""
General Motors,2017-6,The system uses a small camera that focuses on the driver and works with infrared lights to track head position to determine where the driver is looking.
General Motors,2017-6,"If the system - which uses facial recognition software - detects the driver is not paying attention, it will prompt the driver to return attention to the road. If the driver does not respond, it will escalate alerts, including a steering wheel light bar, visual indicators, tactile alerts in the seat and audible alerts. If the driver does not respond, the vehicle is brought to a controlled stop."
General Motors,2017-6,"Volkswagen AG's luxury Audi unit has a system that handles steering and braking at speeds of up to 40 miles. The system requires the driver to check in with the steering wheel every 15 seconds. Audi said the system will beep alerts at the driver, and if the driver does not respond, it will bring the vehicle to a stop."
General Motors,2017-6,"The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which is the lead agency for regulating self-driving cars, does not test or preapprove driver assistance systems before automakers install them. Instead, the agency responds to complaints or crashes when it investigates whether a potential defect poses an unreasonable risk to driver safety. The May 2016 Tesla accident has raised concerns about the regulation of self-driving cars. [nL4N19N3TN]"
General Motors,2017-6,"The NTSB will issue probable cause findings and may make recommendations to the NHTSA in the Tesla crash but does not plan to hold a public hearing on the incident, spokesman Keith Holloway said."
General Motors,2017-6,"In September 2016, Tesla unveiled new restrictions on Autopilot after widespread concerns the system lulled users into a false sense of security through its ""hands-off"" driving capability."
General Motors,2017-6,The updated system temporarily prevents drivers from using the system if they do not respond to audible warnings to take back control of the car.

General Motors,2017-6,"MEXICO CITY, June 23 (Reuters) - A second U-turn this year by Ford Motor Co in Mexico has raised the specter of Chinese competition for local carmaking, adding to pressure on the industry after repeated threats by U.S. President Donald Trump to saddle it with punitive tariffs."

General Motors,2017-6,"LORDSTOWN, Ohio, June 21 (Reuters) - Wall Street is fretting that the U.S. auto industry is heading for a downturn, but for thousands of workers at General Motors Co factories in the United States, the hard times are already here."
General Motors,2017-6,"Matt Streb, 36, was one of 1,200 workers laid off on Jan. 20 - inauguration day for Republican U.S. President Donald Trump - when GM canceled the third shift at its Lordstown small-car factory here. Sales of the Chevrolet Cruze sedan, the only vehicle the plant makes, have nosedived as U.S. consumers switch to SUVs and pickup trucks."
General Motors,2017-6,"Streb is looking for another job, but employers are wary because they assume he will quit whenever GM calls him back. ""I get it,"" said Streb, who has a degree in communications, ""but it's frustrating."""
General Motors,2017-6,Layoffs at Lordstown and other auto plants point to a broader challenge for the economy in Midwestern manufacturing states and for the Trump administration.
General Motors,2017-6,The U.S. auto industry's boom from 2010 through last year was a major driver for manufacturing job creation. The fading of that boom threatens prospects for U.S. industrial output and job creation that were central to President Trump's victory in Ohio and other manufacturing states.
General Motors,2017-6,"""This is about economics, not what Trump says,"" said Robert Morales, president of United Auto Workers (UAW) union Local 1714, which represents workers at GM's stamping plant at Lordstown. ""Even if Trump went out and bought 10,000 Cruzes a month, he wouldn't get the third shift back here."""
General Motors,2017-6,"Last week the Federal Reserve said U.S. factory output fell 0.4 percent in May, the second decline in three months, due partly to a 2-percent drop in motor vehicles and parts production."
General Motors,2017-6,"Mark Muro, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, has compiled data from government sources that show the auto industry punching higher than its weight in job creation in recent years - accounting for between 60 percent and 80 percent of all U.S. manufacturing jobs added in 2015 and 2016."
General Motors,2017-6,"In the first quarter of this year, the auto industry accounted for less than 2 percent of the 45,000 manufacturing jobs created."
General Motors,2017-6,"""There's no argument with the idea that auto has been pulling the manufacturing sled up the mountain for the last three or four years,"" Muro said. ""If you take auto out, you're left with a very tepid outlook indeed."""
General Motors,2017-6,"Long-term auto layoffs could threaten the economies of communities and states directly affected, although after decades of boom and bust, many communities in the auto manufacturing heartland have diversified."
General Motors,2017-6,"In Ohio's Mahoning Valley, which was battered by the collapse of the once-dominant steel industry, the boom in drilling for shale gas helps offset job cuts at auto plants."
General Motors,2017-6,"Lordstown Mayor Arno Hill says the town salted away money during the boom to pay down its debts and new businesses are coming in, including a $900-million power plant being built in town that will burn cheap natural gas produced in the region."
General Motors,2017-6,"GM makes up 40 percent of tax receipts versus 85 percent in the early 1990s, he said."
General Motors,2017-6,"""GM is still the brightest star in the Mahoning Valley, but luckily we have diversified our economy,"" Hill said. ""There is pain for the laid-off workers, but it won't hurt us as bad it used to."""
General Motors,2017-6,"Lordstown's workers have taken steps to blunt the impact of layoffs, with help from GM."
General Motors,2017-6,"Matt Streb's wife is due to start work soon after getting a degree, while he hopes to return to a former job as a mailman. In the meantime, GM gave advance notice of job cuts so he saved extra money and has drastically cut his spending."
General Motors,2017-6,"""The auto industry is cyclical and has always had its ups and downs,"" Streb said. ""This is just another Lordstown downturn."""
General Motors,2017-6,"The decline in U.S. auto sales is still minor compared to the dramatic collapse during the 2007-2009 financial crisis, when demand for new vehicles plunged to its lowest levels in decades."
General Motors,2017-6,"However, the days when auto assembly and parts plants throughout the Midwest were running flat-out because of high demand for nearly every type of vehicle are over. Recent sales trends show consumers becoming more selective, shunning older models and especially smaller cars."
General Motors,2017-6,"For much of the boom that ran from 2010 through to a record year in 2016 of 17.55 million new vehicles sold, the share of cars has declined versus ""light trucks"" - or pickup trucks, SUVs and crossovers."
General Motors,2017-6,"After peaking at 51.32 percent of all sales in 2012, passenger cars fell to 40.4 percent of sales in 2016. That decline equates to the output of seven or eight vehicle assembly plants."
General Motors,2017-6,"Through the first five months of this year, sedan sales fell 11 percent, even as the light truck category rose 4.7 percent."
General Motors,2017-6,"To avoid profit-sapping discounts, and reverse a decline in prices of used vehicles, automakers are ordering more and deeper production cuts. [nL1N1JH0GP]"
General Motors,2017-6,"GM has laid off more than 5,000 workers so far this year - including 1,000 at its Fairfax plant in Kansas that makes the Chevrolet Malibu midsize sedan. GM has also laid off 1,100 workers at a plant in Lansing because it has ended production of the GMC Acadia SUV there."
General Motors,2017-6,"More GM workers will be hit with temporary layoffs this summer. Lordstown will shut up shop for five weeks this summer, much longer than the usual two-week summer vacation closure."
General Motors,2017-6,"Many laid-off GM workers are finding temporary employment at other facilities or taking permanent transfers to plants like its Arlington, Texas, facility where production of large sport utility vehicles continues unabated. However, those temporary postings require workers to relocate hundreds of miles from home."
General Motors,2017-6,"Randy Freeman, president of UAW Local 652 which represents workers at GM's Grand River plant in Lansing, Michigan, which makes sedans, says he has been pleased by GM's efforts to rehire workers and relations with the automaker ""are on an upward swing."""
General Motors,2017-6,"The threats to U.S. workers building sedans are not likely to ease, barring a spike in the price of gasoline. Ford Motor Co signaled its long-term pessimism about small-car demand in the United States by announcing plans on Tuesday to shift production of its Focus compact car model to China. The Michigan plant that builds the Focus currently is expected to switch to building trucks and SUVs in 2018. [nL1N1JH0GP]"
General Motors,2017-6,"At GM's Lordstown and Lansing Grand River plants, UAW representatives say they are focused on improving quality in the hope that GM will pick their plant when it's time to find a location for producing a new truck or SUV."
General Motors,2017-6,"At Lordstown, for instance, union officials tout the fact the plant has just won a quality award for local innovation on a part that helps the Cruz run better."

General Motors,2017-6,"LOS ANGELES, June 21 (Reuters) - Major U.S. corporations such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc and General Motors Co have become some of America's biggest buyers of renewable energy, driving growth in an industry seen as key to helping the United States cut carbon emissions."
General Motors,2017-6,"Last year nearly 40 percent of U.S. wind contracts were signed by corporate power users, along with university and military customers. That's up from just 5 percent in 2013, according to the American Wind Energy Association trade group."
General Motors,2017-6,"These users also accounted for an unprecedented 10% of the market for large-scale solar projects in 2016, figures from research firm GTM Research show. Just two years earlier there were none."
General Motors,2017-6,"Costs for solar and wind are plunging thanks to technological advances and increased global production of panels and turbines. Coupled with tax breaks and other incentives, big energy users such as GM are finding renewables to be competitive with, and often cheaper than, conventional sources of electricity."
General Motors,2017-6,"The automaker has struck deals with two Texas wind farms that will soon provide enough energy to power over a dozen GM facilities, including the U.S. sport utility vehicle assembly plant in Arlington, Texas that produces the Chevrolet Tahoe, Cadillac Escalade and GMC Yukon."
General Motors,2017-6,"The company is already saving $5 million a year worldwide, according to Rob Threlkeld, GM's global manager of renewable energy, and has committed to obtaining 100% of its power from clean sources by 2050."
General Motors,2017-6,"""It's been primarily all driven off economics,"" Threlkeld said. ""Wind and solar costs are coming down so fast that it made it feasible."""
General Motors,2017-6,"Growing corporate demand for green energy comes as U.S. President Donald Trump is championing fossil fuels and targeting environmental regulations as job killers. This month he announced the United States will withdraw from the landmark Paris Agreement to fight climate change, a move that was condemned by several prominent U.S. executives, including General Electric Co Chief Executive Jeff Immelt."
General Motors,2017-6,"Trump's administration, however, has made no moves to target federal tax incentives for renewable energy projects, thanks mainly to bipartisan support in Congress. Many Republican lawmakers hail from states that are major solar or wind energy producers, among them Texas, Oklahoma and Iowa."
General Motors,2017-6,"This year alone, home improvement retailer Home Depot Inc , wireless provider T-Mobile US Inc , banker Goldman Sachs and food producer General Mills announced major purchases of renewable energy."
General Motors,2017-6,"Such deals can take many forms, but most are so-called power purchase agreements. Known as PPAs, these are roughly 10-to-20-year contracts in which the owner of a large solar or wind project sells electricity to large customers, often at rates lower than those charged by utilities. These agreements allow energy users to buy renewables at attractive prices with no upfront investment."
General Motors,2017-6,These agreements also help companies avoid outages if the sun doesn't shine or the wind doesn't blow. The massive wind farms and solar plants that support these contracts often supply electricity straight to the grid rather than feed it directly to corporate customers' plants and offices. Companies get the benefit of clean energy without cutting themselves off from the security of the grid.
General Motors,2017-6,He said Wal-Mart is seeing roughly single-digit percentage savings with its green-power contracts.
General Motors,2017-6,"Furniture retailer IKEA is a notable exception to the PPA trend, preferring to own the renewable-energy assets that serve its U.S. business, including rooftop solar systems on most of its buildings and two wind farms in Texas and Illinois. The approach is part of the Swedish company's long-term corporate strategy of owning all of its stores, factories and the land on which they're built."
General Motors,2017-6,"Demand from big corporations has benefited a host of wind and solar developers including Pattern Energy , First Solar and NextEra Energy . BNB Renewable Energy Holdings LLC, a privately held New York-based developer, said corporations now make up about half its business."
General Motors,2017-6,"""There is a convergence right now where price is low and their sustainability commitments are high,"" said Jos Nicholas, a managing partner with BNB."
General Motors,2017-6,"The developers or owners of the projects, meanwhile, get the stability of long-term contracts plus those federal tax breaks. The solar credit is worth up to 30 percent of a project's value. For wind, the most popular tax credit is a maximum of 2.4 cents per kilowatt-hour of electricity produced for a decade."
General Motors,2017-6,"Since 2014, nearly 100 large global companies have committed to transitioning to 100% renewables through a partnership with The Climate Group, a nonprofit that's working to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Roughly two corporations a month are joining that effort, according to Amy Davidsen, the organization's executive director for North America."
General Motors,2017-6,"In addition to GM, U.S. companies that have made the commitment include Johnson & Johnson , Procter & Gamble Co and Nike Inc ."
General Motors,2017-6,"Still, many big firms remain on the sidelines because they lack an overall corporate sustainability mandate, view renewables as having unattractive returns or because the contracts are too long, according to a 2016 PricewaterhouseCoopers survey."
General Motors,2017-6,"Many small- and medium-sized businesses have a hard time benefiting too. They don't consume enough energy to negotiate large, lowest-cost PPAs like the big guys. Smaller projects, such as installing rooftop solar panels, tend to depend heavily on state and local incentives that come and go."
General Motors,2017-6,The 2020 expiration of the federal tax incentives is another concern. But industry watchers expect U.S. companies will continue their ambitious public commitments to boost renewable energy use even if those breaks aren't renewed.
General Motors,2017-6,"General Mills, for instance, sees climate change as a major threat to the agricultural supply chain behind products such as Cheerios cereal and Yoplait yogurt. The company has a goal of reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 28 percent by 2025."

General Motors,2017-6,(Adds full name and title of General Mills executive in final paragraph)
General Motors,2017-6,"LOS ANGELES, June 21 (Reuters) - Major U.S. corporations such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc and General Motors Co have become some of America's biggest buyers of renewable energy, driving growth in an industry seen as key to helping the United States cut carbon emissions."
General Motors,2017-6,"Last year nearly 40 percent of U.S. wind contracts were signed by corporate power users, along with university and military customers. That's up from just 5 percent in 2013, according to the American Wind Energy Association trade group."
General Motors,2017-6,"These users also accounted for an unprecedented 10% of the market for large-scale solar projects in 2016, figures from research firm GTM Research show. Just two years earlier there were none."
General Motors,2017-6,"Costs for solar and wind are plunging thanks to technological advances and increased global production of panels and turbines. Coupled with tax breaks and other incentives, big energy users such as GM are finding renewables to be competitive with, and often cheaper than, conventional sources of electricity."
General Motors,2017-6,"The automaker has struck deals with two Texas wind farms that will soon provide enough energy to power over a dozen GM facilities, including the U.S. sport utility vehicle assembly plant in Arlington, Texas that produces the Chevrolet Tahoe, Cadillac Escalade and GMC Yukon."
General Motors,2017-6,"The company is already saving $5 million a year worldwide, according to Rob Threlkeld, GM's global manager of renewable energy, and has committed to obtaining 100% of its power from clean sources by 2050."
General Motors,2017-6,"""It's been primarily all driven off economics,"" Threlkeld said. ""Wind and solar costs are coming down so fast that it made it feasible."""
General Motors,2017-6,"Growing corporate demand for green energy comes as U.S. President Donald Trump is championing fossil fuels and targeting environmental regulations as job killers. This month he announced the United States will withdraw from the landmark Paris Agreement to fight climate change, a move that was condemned by several prominent U.S. executives, including General Electric Co Chief Executive Jeff Immelt."
General Motors,2017-6,"Trump's administration, however, has made no moves to target federal tax incentives for renewable energy projects, thanks mainly to bipartisan support in Congress. Many Republican lawmakers hail from states that are major solar or wind energy producers, among them Texas, Oklahoma and Iowa."
General Motors,2017-6,"This year alone, home improvement retailer Home Depot Inc , wireless provider T-Mobile US Inc , banker Goldman Sachs and food producer General Mills announced major purchases of renewable energy."
General Motors,2017-6,"Such deals can take many forms, but most are so-called power purchase agreements. Known as PPAs, these are roughly 10-to-20-year contracts in which the owner of a large solar or wind project sells electricity to large customers, often at rates lower than those charged by utilities. These agreements allow energy users to buy renewables at attractive prices with no upfront investment."
General Motors,2017-6,These agreements also help companies avoid outages if the sun doesn't shine or the wind doesn't blow. The massive wind farms and solar plants that support these contracts often supply electricity straight to the grid rather than feed it directly to corporate customers' plants and offices. Companies get the benefit of clean energy without cutting themselves off from the security of the grid.
General Motors,2017-6,He said Wal-Mart is seeing roughly single-digit percentage savings with its green-power contracts.
General Motors,2017-6,"Furniture retailer IKEA is a notable exception to the PPA trend, preferring to own the renewable-energy assets that serve its U.S. business, including rooftop solar systems on most of its buildings and two wind farms in Texas and Illinois. The approach is part of the Swedish company's long-term corporate strategy of owning all of its stores, factories and the land on which they're built."

General Motors,2017-6,"DETROIT/WASHINGTON, June 20 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co said on Tuesday it will move some production of its Focus small car to China and import the vehicles to the United States in a long-term bet on low oil prices and stable U.S.-China trade relations despite recent tensions."
General Motors,2017-6,"The move suggests China could play a much larger role in future vehicle production for North America, perhaps eclipsing Mexico as a low-cost manufacturing source."
General Motors,2017-6,"Ford painted the production shift from Mexico to China, slated for mid-2019, as a purely financial move that will save the company $500 million in reduced tooling costs."
General Motors,2017-6,"But Ford also expects to ship about 80,000 vehicles to China this year, including the redesigned Lincoln Navigator luxury sport utility vehicle, which goes into production this fall at Ford's Kentucky truck plant."
General Motors,2017-6,"Ford's decision to import its first vehicles from China to the United States is also the first major manufacturing investment decision made by new Chief Executive Jim Hackett, who succeeded Mark Fields in May. Discussion about the small-car production shift from Mexico to China began ""a couple months ago"" under Fields, said Joe Hinrichs, president of global operations."
General Motors,2017-6,"The decision also signals a shift in strategy at Ford, which is responding to dwindling U.S. consumer demand for small cars in favor of more expensive and more profitable trucks and SUVs. Cars accounted for more than 50 percent of U.S. auto sales as recently as 2012, but have fallen to just 37 percent of sales this year."
General Motors,2017-6,Ford on Tuesday said it would invest $900 million at the Kentucky truck plant to build the redesigned Navigator and Ford Expedition. It has contingency plans to build more of the big SUVs at an Ohio plant if demand grows.
General Motors,2017-6,"In January, after U.S. President Donald Trump repeatedly criticized Ford for shipping small-car manufacturing to Mexico, Ford said it would kill plans to build a $1.8 billion Focus plant in San Luis Potosi and instead produce the new Focus at an existing plant in Hermosillo."
General Motors,2017-6,"""The Ford decision shows how flexible multinational companies are in terms of geography,"" U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in a statement."
General Motors,2017-6,"White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said Trump ""wants to create a tax system (so) that companies want to come back and bring back jobs in manufacturing here in the United States."""
General Motors,2017-6,"Although it is cheaper to build and ship cars to the United States from Mexico than China, ""this was not a variable cost decision,"" Hinrichs said in a briefing on Tuesday. ""It allows us to free up a lot of capital"" because Ford now has to retool only one plant - the existing Focus factory in Chongqing - rather than two to supply North America."
General Motors,2017-6,"The current Focus will be phased out of production in Wayne, Michigan, in mid-2018, according to Hinrichs. The Wayne plant will begin building a new Ranger midsize truck in late 2018 and a Bronco midsize SUV in 2020."
General Motors,2017-6,Ford executives told Trump last year that moving production to Michigan of bigger vehicles that were more profitable would secure the Wayne plant's future - a decision later praised by Trump.
General Motors,2017-6,"No U.S. jobs will be affected by shifting Focus production to China, Ford said, adding that it employs more U.S. hourly workers and builds more vehicles in the United States than any other automaker."
General Motors,2017-6,"Hinrichs said ""the capital saving outweighs the risk"" of having to pay a potential border tax, or import tax, on the Chinese-built Focus."
General Motors,2017-6,"Ford U.S. Focus sales have fallen 22 percent this year, as low gas prices have helped spur more buyers into larger vehicles. Ford's full-size F-series pickup truck remains the best-selling U.S. vehicle by a wide margin."
General Motors,2017-6,"Unlike many consumer products, few Chinese-made vehicles are sold in the United States."
General Motors,2017-6,"General Motors Co has been exporting Buick and Cadillac vehicles from China to the United States since last year, as has Volvo Cars, a unit of Chinese automaker Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd <0175.HK>."

General Motors,2017-6,"The corporate support for the plan, which would impose a $40 tax on each ton of carbon dioxide produced, follows a decision by President Donald Trump to pull the United States out of the Paris Climate Agreement, a global pact that fights climate change by slashing emissions from burning fossil fuels."
General Motors,2017-6,"""This plan would achieve significantly greater emissions reductions than all current and prior climate regulations, while helping America's businesses and workers get ahead,"" according to the advertisement from the Climate Leadership Council."
General Motors,2017-6,"The ad bore the corporate symbols of companies such as Exxon, BP, Shell , Total , GM , Johnson & Johnson , and PepsiCo ."
General Motors,2017-6,"The Climate Leadership Council proposal was co-authored by James Baker, secretary of state during the administration of George H. W. Bush, and George Shultz, secretary of state under Ronald Reagan. The proposed $40 per ton tax on carbon would rise in price over time, and revenues would be paid into the Social Security Administration."
General Motors,2017-6,"While the plan echoes past attempts by parts of the Republican Party to address climate change, it could be a non-starter. Trump has expressed doubt over the existence of climate change and has said efforts to fight it put the United States at a competitive disadvantage."
General Motors,2017-6,A White House official did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The administration has previously said a carbon tax is not under consideration.
General Motors,2017-6,"An overwhelming majority of scientists believe that burning fossil fuels drives global climate change, has raised sea levels and triggered more frequent and powerful storms."
General Motors,2017-6,"Oil giants like Exxon and BP have been criticized for their roles in contributing to climate change through the production and marketing of fossil fuels. Still, in recent years, they have supported government efforts to regulate emissions, including through the Paris climate deal agreed by nearly 200 nations in 2015."
General Motors,2017-6,"Exxon Chief Executive Darren Woods had repeatedly urged Trump to keep the United States in the Paris deal, saying the country's abundant reserves of low-carbon natural gas made it well-placed to perform within the agreement."

General Motors,2017-6,"Daimler said in February that it will invest more than 250 million euros ($279 million) in the factory, contrasting with widespread wariness among international investors after a prolonged downturn brought on by sanctions and a collapse in global oil prices. [nL8N1G65M1]"

General Motors,2017-6,* CEO will not backtrack on decision to step down in 2019
General Motors,2017-6,"VENICE, Italy, June 16 (Reuters) - Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) does not expect its diesel problems in the United States to have an impact on its short-term business targets to 2018, Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne said on Friday."
General Motors,2017-6,"The U.S. Justice Department sued FCA last month, accusing the Italian-American automaker of illegally using software to bypass emission controls in 104,000 diesel vehicles sold since 2014, in a move that could potentially lead to heavy fines. [nL1N1IP14G]"
General Motors,2017-6,"The company has proposed a software update as part of certifying 2017 diesel models to allow them to go on sale and then use that fix to update the 104,000 vehicles on the road."
General Motors,2017-6,"Asked whether it could take months to get U.S. authority approval for the software fix, as suggested by a U.S. Justice Department lawyer this week, Marchionne said ""we are much closer than this"". [nL1N1JB1I5]"
General Motors,2017-6,"""When we made the proposal, we were ready to implement the fix immediately ... now it depends on them,"" Marchionne told journalists on the sidelines of a meeting in Venice of the U.S.-Italy council. ""We are talking to them ... we think we have a viable solution."""
General Motors,2017-6,"He said the company had not made any provisions for any potential fines, adding it was ""impossible to try estimate""."
General Motors,2017-6,"Part of the 2018 business plan, which is centred around the revamp of its Jeep, Maserati and Alfa Romeo brands, is erasing all debt and accumulating at least 4 billion euros ($4.5 billion) of cash by the end of next year."
General Motors,2017-6,"After failing to strike a much sought alliance for FCA, Marchionne has made executing the 2018 plan his core ambition before he steps down at the end of his tenure early in the following year."
General Motors,2017-6,"When asked whether he could rethink his decision to quit in early 2019 given political and market uncertainties surrounding his company, Marchionne, who turns 65 on Saturday, said ""No."""

General Motors,2017-6,"""My job is not easy, it's a bit loaded,"" he said."

General Motors,2017-6,"German-based Opel will be pressed by its new owners PSA to draw up a plan to return to profit once the acquisition, agreed in March valuing the GM division at 2.2 billion euros ($2.46 billion), closes later this year."
General Motors,2017-6,"""Under Neumann's leadership we have made enormous progress in turning around Opel,"" GM President Dan Ammann said. The U.S. parent's European business also includes British brand Vauxhall."
General Motors,2017-6,"VW is looking at rehiring Neumann, possibly to lead its Audi luxury division, where chief executive Rupert Stadler has come under fire for his handling of the emissions scandal, a source told Reuters on Sunday. [nL8N1J80DT]"
General Motors,2017-6,"A growing expansion by VW group into electric cars and digital services as part of a post-dieselgate strategic shift could be another reason to join for Neumann, a trained electronic engineer, analysts said."
General Motors,2017-6,"""The prospects are good that he will move to Volkswagen,"" said Bankhaus Metzler analyst Juergen Pieper. ""He's one of Germany's most distinguished car managers and VW is in great need for excellent people."""
General Motors,2017-6,PSA wants Opel to return to lasting profit no later than by 2020 with operating margin goals of 2 percent that year and even around 6 percent by 2026 - a target never achieved under Neumann whose push for profitability was hampered by a weak Russian market and effects of Britain's Brexit decision.
General Motors,2017-6,"""We will vigorously proceed along the agreed path and gain more clout as part of the PSA group,"" Lohscheller said."
General Motors,2017-6,"Germany's Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung reported on Saturday that while Neumann views the sale to PSA as the right strategic step, he is concerned that the new owner is underestimating the growing importance of electric cars."
General Motors,2017-6,"""These comments are interesting given we have previously noted our concerns around PSA's lack of investment in key future trends,"" said London-based Evercore ISI analyst Arndt Ellinghorst."
General Motors,2017-6,"PSA only came eighth in a top-ten ranking compiled by Evercore of carmakers based on average R&D spending between 2014-2016, lagging rivals such as Ford , Renault and leader Volkswagen where Neumann was formerly in charge of group-wide electronics research."
General Motors,2017-6,Neumann said on Twitter he will stay as member of Opel's management board until the closing of the acquisition by PSA.
General Motors,2017-6,"When he lost his post as head of VW's vast operations in China in 2012, sources at the carmaker said at the time he was too aspiring for the then-CEO Martin Winterkorn."
General Motors,2017-6,"""VW boss (Matthias) Mueller has a more open leadership style that is not authoritarian,"" Pieper said. ""That would facilitate Neumann's return."""

General Motors,2017-6,"A 50-year-old Korean-American, Eum was an assistant chief designer at GM's advanced design studio in southern California from 2000 to 2012 before moving to China as design chief for SAIC-GM-Wuling Auto (SGMW), the GM joint venture with SAIC Motor <600104.SS> in southern China that sells entry-level cars."

General Motors,2017-6,"WASHINGTON, June 9 (Reuters) - New York State's attorney general and 12 other top state law enforcement officials said on Friday they would mount a vigorous court challenge to any effort to roll back vehicle emission rules by the Trump administration."
General Motors,2017-6,"In March, President Donald Trump ordered a review of U.S. vehicle fuel-efficiency standards from 2022-2025 put in place by the Obama administration, saying they were too tough on the auto industry."
General Motors,2017-6,The push to weaken the rules by the Trump administration comes as automakers are worried that consumers shift to larger vehicles and low gas prices will make it expensive or impossible to meet the regulations. They also fear a prolonged fight with states over the rules could make revising their product plans difficult.
General Motors,2017-6,Democratic state officials have been increasingly aggressive in challenging Trump administration regulatory rollback efforts.
General Motors,2017-6,"""In light of the critical public health and environmental benefits the standards will deliver, if EPA acts to weaken or delay the current standards for model years 2022-25, like California, we intend to vigorously pursue appropriate legal remedies to block such action,"" the state attorneys wrote in a letter to the Environmental Protection Agency including Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Iowa, Washington State, Oregon and Rhode Island."
General Motors,2017-6,An EPA spokesman said Friday the agency is reviewing the letter.
General Motors,2017-6,"Automakers including General Motors Co , Ford Motor Co and Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T> say the Obama administration did not conduct a proper review to ensure those rules are feasible."
General Motors,2017-6,Automakers have met with Trump administration officials in recent months and hope to reach a deal with California and other states on vehicle fuel efficiency standards.
General Motors,2017-6,"Gloria Bergquist, a spokeswoman for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a trade group, said automakers ""urge everyone to avoid pre-judging the results"" of the ongoing review. ""A process is now under way again for a thoughtful and coordinated analysis,"""
General Motors,2017-6,"California has opposed weakening the rules, threatened to pursue tougher standards unilaterally and could mount a legal challenge."
General Motors,2017-6,"The White House plans to hold negotiations with car companies, California and potentially other states. A deal would remove uncertainty for automakers, who need years of lead time to engineer future models and want uniform rules across all 50 states."
General Motors,2017-6,"The Obama administration's rules, negotiated with automakers in 2011, were aimed at doubling average fleet-wide fuel efficiency to 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025. Under the 2011 deal, the 2022-2025 model year rules had to be finalized by April 2018. The Obama administration completed a review of the 2022-2025 rules days before leaving office."
General Motors,2017-6,"Without a deal, automakers could be forced to meet one set of standards in California and a dozen states that have adopted its rules and other rules in the rest of the country."

General Motors,2017-6,"GM concluded a first round of talks on Wednesday with its 96 India dealers, who operate 120 dealerships, and the company is confident its settlement terms will be accepted by a large majority, a person at GM India said on condition of anonymity."
General Motors,2017-6,"""We are meeting with dealers individually and working through a plan that addresses their concerns,"" a spokesperson said. ""GM India is working directly with our dealers to transition to authorized service outlets and to recognise some of the investments made in dealerships."""
General Motors,2017-6,"But GM's Dealers Association Board (DAB) comprising 15 high-sales dealers said the compensation on offer was ""negligible and not sufficient"", in a June 6 email to Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra, shown to Reuters by one DAB member."
General Motors,2017-6,Two other DAB members told Reuters that about 50 dealers were dissatisfied with the terms and have contributed to a fund created by DAB for use in the event of any legal action.
General Motors,2017-6,"The president of India's Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations, John K. Paul, said ""several"" dealers were planning legal action in India and exploring the possibility of a class action suit in the United States. He said they aimed to finalise plans this month ahead of a second round of talks."
General Motors,2017-6,"One of the three DAB members said GM offered compensation based on dealers' average monthly sales over the past two years, showroom size and expenses for sundry items such as signage. The member favoured compensation based on a dealer's two best years as the past two years suffered from a scarcity of new models."
General Motors,2017-6,"The three DAB members plus three more dealers told Reuters the offer was too low. One of the DAB members said compensation amounted to about 10 to 12 percent of their original investment, and that it should be ""higher by a few multiples""."
General Motors,2017-6,All six dealers declined to be identified as the matter was confidential.
General Motors,2017-6,Two of the DAB members said they were surprised when GM announced the end of sales on May 18. One showed Reuters a GM email dated April 28 announcing a new hatchback for July.

General Motors,2017-6,"DETROIT, June 8 (Reuters) - Big automakers are rushing to launch self-driving cars as early as 2021, but the industry's major players are moving slowly when it comes to widespread deployment of a less expensive crash prevention technology that regulators say could prevent thousands of deaths and injuries every year."
General Motors,2017-6,"Nissan Motor Co Ltd <7201.T> said on Thursday it would make automatic braking systems standard on an estimated 1 million 2018 model cars and light trucks sold in the United States, including high-volume models such as the Rogue and Rogue Sport compact sport utility vehicles, the Altima sedan, Murano and Pathfinder SUVs, LEAF electric car, Maxima sedan and Sentra small car. [nL3N1J51OO]"
General Motors,2017-6,Nissan sold about 1.6 million vehicles in the United States last year.
General Motors,2017-6,Rival Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T> has said it will make so-called automatic emergency braking standard on nearly all its U.S. models by the end of this year. [nWNAB0AD2N]
General Motors,2017-6,"Overall, however, most automakers are not rushing to make automatic brake systems part of the base cost of mainstream vehicles sold in the competitive U.S. market. The industry has come under pressure from regulators, lawmakers and safety advocates to adopt the technology, which can slow or stop a vehicle even if the driver fails to act."
General Motors,2017-6,"So far, only about 17 percent of models tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety offered standard collision-avoiding braking, according to data supplied by the auto safety research group backed insurance industry. Many of the models with standard collision-avoiding brake systems are luxury vehicles made by European or Japanese manufacturers."
General Motors,2017-6,"The systems require more sensors and software than conventional brakes, and automakers said they need time to engineer the systems into vehicles as part of more comprehensive makeovers."
General Motors,2017-6,"Last year, 20 automakers reached a voluntary agreement with U.S. auto safety regulators to make collision-avoiding braking systems standard equipment by 2022. [nL2N16P1S5]"
General Motors,2017-6,"Safety advocates have petitioned the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to begin a regulatory process to require the technologies, but the agency has said the voluntary agreement will result in faster deployment than a formal rule-making process. NHTSA says the technology could eliminate one-fifth of crashes."
General Motors,2017-6,"""Do the math. That's 5 million crashes every year - 20 percent reduction means 1 million less. Those are big numbers,"" Mark Rosekind, the NHTSA's then-administrator, told Reuters last year."
General Motors,2017-6,"But customers would likely experience the benefits of the technology infrequently. The technology to enable a car to drive itself is far more costly, but industry executives foresee autonomous vehicles driving revenue-generating transportation services that could be attractive to investors."
General Motors,2017-6,General Motors Co offers automatic braking as optional equipment on about two-thirds of its models. The company did not say on Thursday how many vehicles have the technology as standard equipment. GM has not made public its plans to make the technology standard across its lineup.
General Motors,2017-6,"""Any time you have a voluntary agreement you have a spectrum of implementation,"" Jeff Boyer, GM's vice president for safety, told Reuters earlier this week. Asked when GM would roll out standard automatic braking, Boyer said, ""let's just say we honor the voluntary commitment."""
General Motors,2017-6,"Ford Motor Co ""has a plan to standardize over time,"" the company said in a statement on Thursday. Currently, automatic braking systems are optional on several 2017 Ford and Lincoln models, and will be offered on certain 2018 models including the best-selling F-150 pickup truck."
General Motors,2017-6,"Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV offers automatic braking as optional equipment in nine model lines, using cameras and radar to detect hazards ahead. The company has said it will meet the 2022 target for making the systems standard."
General Motors,2017-6,"As 2018 models roll out during the second half of this year, more vehicles will offer automatic braking, said Dean McConnell, an executive with Continental AG 's North American business. Continental's automatic braking technology systems will be on certain Nissan models."
General Motors,2017-6,"""We see it accelerating,"" he said. ""It varies. There are some (automakers) that are being aggressive"" and others that are waiting."
General Motors,2017-6,"Nissan did not disclose how much prices for vehicles would rise to offset the cost of standard automatic emergency braking. The 2018 models will be launched later this year. Currently, Nissan, like most carmakers, offers automatic braking as part of a bundle of optional safety and technology features."
General Motors,2017-6,"A 2017 Nissan Sentra compact sedan has a starting price of $17,875. To buy the car equipped with automatic braking requires spending another $6,820 for a Sentra SR with a premium technology package."

General Motors,2017-6,"NEW YORK, June 8 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Tesla's shareholders have revealed their faith is blind. Even after excluding the 22 percent stake owned by founder and Chief Executive Elon Musk, a proposal forcing all seven board members to stand for election every year was rejected at this week's annual meeting. Authorizing bad corporate governance makes little sense at a company with such a lofty valuation."
General Motors,2017-6,"Tesla's argument for the status quo rings hollow. It reckons directors risk being ""distracted by special interests that seek only short-term returns"" if each were to face re-election annually. But the company is losing money and has no cash to spare. Absent a highly unlikely sale, there's not much that a short-term-biased director could do."
General Motors,2017-6,"Enough investors were nevertheless persuaded. That's surprising, especially considering recent history. Last year, about three-quarters of unaffiliated shareholders supported a proposal to eliminate the limited supermajority voting rules. That fell to 42 percent after factoring in Musk's block."
General Motors,2017-6,"Yet Tesla's board could use a shakeup. Lead director Antonio Gracias, Steve Jurvetson and Musk's brother Kimbal all sit on the board at another Musk company, SpaceX, in which fellow director and venture capitalist Ira Ehrenpreis has invested. Gracias was also a director at SolarCity before Tesla bought it last year and runs a private-equity fund Musk backs, while Brad Buss spent seven years as SolarCity's finance chief."
General Motors,2017-6,"That leaves just one member with no other obvious ties to the boss. Musk did, at least, say at Tuesday's meeting that he hopes to add some independent directors soon. Even so, shareholders are too accepting of Tesla's chummy board."
General Motors,2017-6,"Of course, the company's stock also has surged over 60 percent over the past year. At a market value of $60 billion, it's worth more than both Ford and General Motors . Tesla also now trades at 30 times consensus earnings for 2020, according to Thomson Reuters data, implying astonishing growth in vehicle sales at eye-popping margins of at least 30 percent. The complete confidence of shareholders is as consistent in the market as it is at the ballot."
General Motors,2017-6,"- A majority of Tesla's independent shareholders on June 6 voted against a proposal at the carmaker's annual meeting to force board directors to stand for election each year, the company revealed in a regulatory filing on June 8. Tesla currently allows its seven directors to serve three-year terms."

General Motors,2017-6,"{{20170608T050001.726+0000}}Small is lucrative for Wachtell, corporate America's legal defense forceBy Greg Roumeliotis"
General Motors,2017-6,"NEW YORK, June 8 (Reuters) - Every Tuesday, partners and associates at Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz gather for a communal lunch in the dining room of the law firm's Manhattan offices."
General Motors,2017-6,"Food ordered from top New York restaurants is served, but the real attraction is Martin Lipton, one of the firm's co-founders and corporate America's most famous consigliere."
General Motors,2017-6,"The weekly lunch is just one of the ways the 85-year-old stays in touch with new associates and reinforces the firm's close-knit culture, where young law graduates are often paired with senior partners to work on big deals."
General Motors,2017-6,"The firm's concentrated business model contrasts with the strategy of many law firms to become one-stop shops for deals, from navigating niche regulatory processes to sorting through labyrinthine tax affairs."
General Motors,2017-6,"Lipton is confident that his strategy of concentrating on high-stakes corporate situations will persist, according to interviews with several senior partners at the firm. This is because corporate America continues to turn to Wachtell as its top legal gun for hire."
General Motors,2017-6,"""Wachtell's business model is to be the firm you go to when you are not willing to take any risk at all,"" said Stephen Gillers, a New York University School of Law professor. ""They know that in the big M&A cases, legal fees, no matter how big they are, are insignificant to the value of concluding the deal."""
General Motors,2017-6,"When French drug giant Sanofi SA threatened U.S. cancer drug company Medivation Inc with a $9.3 billion hostile bid last year, for example, Medivation called Wachtell despite having an existing external legal adviser, Cooley."
General Motors,2017-6,Cooley helped Medivation to go public in 2004 and is best known for advising on initial public offerings and defending against patent and class action lawsuits. Cooley and Medivation declined to comment.
General Motors,2017-6,"With some U.S. companies domiciled overseas, Wachtell's partners often have to adapt their techniques to different jurisdictions."
General Motors,2017-6,"Rather than opening offices internationally as some of their rivals have done, Wachtell's lawyers fly out to advise, staying weeks in some cases to see a case through, and turn to other law firms to assist them."
General Motors,2017-6,"Wachtell did consider opening a London office in recent years, but decided against it, partner at the firm said. The feeling among the firm's senior partners was that expansion would dilute its culture, which is based around forming ad hoc teams to deal with situations, all from the one office in Manhattan."
General Motors,2017-6,"Keeping itself small has helped Wachtell become the most lucrative law firm in the world, with the average partner making a profit last year of $5.8 million, according to trade publication American Lawyer. The top 100 law firms averaged profit per partner of $1.66 million."
General Motors,2017-6,Capping the workforce also means that partners do not have an army of associates to foist work onto.
General Motors,2017-6,"""We work harder on average than other places, the work is very partner-heavy. It's the type of work where vast experience is critical,"" said Daniel Neff, co-chairman of Wachtell's executive committee."
General Motors,2017-6,"No one is more experienced than Lipton, referred to as Marty by clients and colleagues. He continues to work on high-profile cases including, most recently, advising General Motors Co's board of directors on its defense against activist hedge fund Greenlight Capital, as well metal parts maker Arconic Inc on its settlement with activist hedge fund Elliott Management Corp."
General Motors,2017-6,"Besides Lipton, two of the other three founding partners, Leonard Rosen and George Katz, have died. However, like Lipton, founding partner Herbert Wachtell remains active at 84 practicing law, focusing on corporate litigation, which is the firm's other major area of strength."
General Motors,2017-6,"Lipton has built a bench of seasoned deal lawyers who now account for the majority of the business that comes through the door. They include Neff and Edward Herlihy, who formally lead the firm as co-managing partners, as well as Andrew Brownstein, David Katz, Steven Rosenblum, Adam Emmerich and Andrew Nussbaum, among others."
General Motors,2017-6,"When Perrigo Co Plc turned to Wachtell in 2015 to defend against a $35 billion offer from Mylan NV , it was a 45-year-old partner, Igor Kirman, that the Irish-domiciled generic drug maker chose to lead its defense in three continents. Perrigo subsequently defeated what was the largest hostile bid ever rejected by a company's shareholders."
General Motors,2017-6,"""It was a given for me that by turning to Wachtell we would get excellent legal advice. But Igor also took very complex issues and simplified them so Perrigo's board could understand,"" said Joseph Papa, Perrigo's former CEO who now leads Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc ."
General Motors,2017-6,"Lipton remains influential, fielding calls and studying cases every day from his 31st-floor office, which is filled with memorabilia from major deals stretching back to the 1970s."
General Motors,2017-6,"""Lipton is royalty in the M&A bar. There is no immediate successor to the status that he has achieved,"" said Gillers. ""The fact that clients still ask for him at the age of 85 shows you that the most important assets of a lawyer are his experience and judgment."""

General Motors,2017-6,"{{20170606T170054.822+0000}}UPDATE 3-GM investors reject Greenlight share plan, board slate(Adds Greenlight response, quote, background)"
General Motors,2017-6,"DETROIT/NEW YORK, June 6 (Reuters) - General Motors Co shareholders on Tuesday overwhelmingly rejected proposals by hedge fund Greenlight Capital to restructure the company's stock and reshape its board, backing Chief Executive Mary Barra's efforts to rev up the company's stalled share price."
General Motors,2017-6,"Fending off the challenge from Greenlight founder David Einhorn does not mean the end of Barra's battles. GM shares traded on Tuesday at $34.25, about 16 percent lower than when Barra became CEO, despite robust profits and a series of moves to sell or shut down money losing operations."
General Motors,2017-6,"The win also does not mean pressure will let up from Greenlight, which is the fifth largest shareholder, and while gracious in defeat, continued to make the case for fresh faces on the board."
General Motors,2017-6,"""We are disappointed that shareholders have elected to maintain the status quo,"" Einhorn said in a statement on Tuesday. ""We congratulate GM's management on their win today."""
General Motors,2017-6,Greenlight's campaign came as U.S. auto industry sales of new vehicles have begun to wane after a boom cycle that has lasted since 2010.
General Motors,2017-6,"Silicon Valley electric vehicle maker Tesla Inc this year surpassed GM's market value, reflecting investor confidence that, despite heavy losses, Tesla has a better strategy as the auto industry shifts to ride services and electric, autonomous vehicles."
General Motors,2017-6,"In comments before Tuesday's shareholder meeting, Barra acknowledged Greenlight's position on its stock price, saying ""we do believe GM stock is undervalued,"" and said the company ""is continually looking at ideas"" to increase investor interest."
General Motors,2017-6,"Preliminary results showed more than 91 percent of shareholders voted against Greenlight's proposal to have GM offer dividend and capital appreciation shares, according to GM officials at the meeting."
General Motors,2017-6,"GM's board nominees were elected with between 84 percent and 99 percent of the vote, the company said. The board will remain the same at 11 members, with Barra as chairman."
General Motors,2017-6,"Einhorn floated the dual-class proposal in March, saying it could boost the automaker's $52-billion market capitalization by as much as $38 billion. [nL3N1H54NI]"
General Motors,2017-6,"Greenlight, which owns a 3.6 percent stake in GM, later nominated three directors for the company's board: Leo Hindery, who served as CEO for five telecommunications and media companies, including AT&T Broadband and Liberty Media; Vinit Sethi, Greenlight's director of research and William Thorndike, founder Housatonic Partners and the chairman of Consol Energy."
General Motors,2017-6,"Greenlight hoped to replace three incumbent directors: Jane Mendillo, Michael Mullen and Carol Stephenson."
General Motors,2017-6,"But Einhorn's pitch flopped with debt rating agencies and proxy advisers and he failed to rally other shareholders to his cause [nL2N1H7143][nL1N1IT0CB]. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc , which holds a 3.3 percent stake in GM, remained silent on the proposal."
General Motors,2017-6,Einhorn added in Tuesday's statement that GM should still consider Hindery and Thorndike for the board.
General Motors,2017-6,"Greenlight is a multi-strategy hedge fund that has taken on other corporate giants such as Apple Inc , but whose last activist proxy contest was more than 10 years ago."
General Motors,2017-6,"Jason Schloetzer, professor at Georgetown's McDonough School of Business, said Greenlight's loss is not a major blow to the roughly $10 billion hedge fund and time will tell if its stake earns the kind of returns Einhorn hopes to reap."
General Motors,2017-6,"""While Greenlight would have liked to have increased their influence over GM's financial management, it's unfair to conclude from today's vote that the fund will not be successful in its investment over the medium term,"" Schloetzer said."

General Motors,2017-6,"NEW YORK, June 6 (Reuters Breakingviews) - David Einhorn's financial-engineering bid has hit a dead end at General Motors . His fund Greenlight Capital's proposal to boost the automaker's value by issuing a new class of dividend shares got a drubbing from investors at Tuesday's annual meeting. Chief Executive Mary Barra can't afford to gloat, though. The company's stock is flatlining and plenty of speedbumps lie ahead."
General Motors,2017-6,Einhorn contended that splitting the stock into one class of shares entitled to the company's dividend in perpetuity and a separate class entitled to any additional profit generated by growth would attract more investors. He also argued it would boost the company's $52 billion market value by as much as $38 billion.
General Motors,2017-6,"The valuation issue that prompted the hedge-fund manager's intervention hasn't gone away, though. GM shares trade at just 5.59 times consensus earnings expectations for 2017, the lowest multiple of any profitable company in the S&P 500 Index. At just over $34 a share, the stock is barely above the price at its initial public offering in November 2010."
General Motors,2017-6,"Barra hasn't been standing still. She is aggressively refreshing GM's vehicle lineup, agreed in February to sell the European business to PSA Group for $2.2 billion and expects to return $7 billion to shareholders this year through buybacks and dividends."
General Motors,2017-6,"The company is heading towards nasty looking traffic, though. U.S. auto sales are softening and discounts are spreading to the sport utility vehicles and light trucks that generate a large chunk of Detroit's profit. Spending heavily to develop electric cars and self-driving technology will make it even harder to maintain current levels of profitability."
General Motors,2017-6,"- General Motors shareholders on June 6 overwhelmingly rejected a proposal by David Einhorn's Greenlight Capital to split the company's stock into a dividend share and a common share. The automaker said more than 91 percent of votes cast were against the proposal, a number that rose to 96 percent if Greenlight's stake was excluded."
General Motors,2017-6,- Greenlight proposed splitting the stock into one class of shares that would be entitled to the company's $1.52 dividend in perpetuity and another class that would be entitled to any profit generated by growth. The hedge-fund firm contended that its plan would add as much as $38 billion to the company's market value.
General Motors,2017-6,"- Shareholders also rejected Einhorn's three board candidates, electing the company's nominees with anywhere from 84 percent to 99 percent of votes cast."
General Motors,2017-6,- GM stock was down a little more than half of a percent at $34.25 after the vote.

General Motors,2017-6,"MONTREAL, June 1 (Reuters) - Canadian auto sales hit a record high in May, with General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co on Thursday reporting double-digit increases, fueled by demand for crossovers and light trucks, according to analysts who compile the monthly data."
General Motors,2017-6,One economist attributed the record May sales to discounting among the large automakers in a fight for market share.
General Motors,2017-6,"Automakers sold 216,861 vehicles in May, a number which ""smashed all previous monthly records,"" and was up 11 percent compared with the same month a year earlier, Canadian auto analyst Dennis DesRosiers wrote in a note."
General Motors,2017-6,"Year-to-date auto sales in Canada reached 835,582 units representing a 4.7 percent increase over the previous year, DesRosiers wrote."
General Motors,2017-6,"Scotiabank senior economist Carlos Gomes attributed the strong May sales figures to discounting. ""I would call it incentive heaven,"" he said by phone from Toronto."
General Motors,2017-6,"Gomes said he now expects another record-breaking year for Canadian auto sales. He plans to revise his April forecast that said Canadian auto sales would decline slightly in 2017 to about 1.94 million vehicles, from a record-breaking 1.97 million units in 2016."
General Motors,2017-6,"By contrast, in the United States, automakers reported sales fell 1 percent from a year ago. This brought the annualized sales pace down to 16.66 million cars and light trucks from 17.17 million vehicles a year ago, according to figures compiled by Motor Intelligence. [nL1N1IY12W]"
General Motors,2017-6,"""We're going to have to increase our Canadian forecast and reduce our U.S. forecast,"" Gomes said."
General Motors,2017-6,"In Canada, Ford reported the sale of 34,486 vehicles, up 17 percent compared with the same month a year earlier and the best sales for a month of May since 1989."
General Motors,2017-6,"General Motors said it sold 31,149 vehicles in Canada last month, a 36 percent rise compared with a year earlier, fueled by demand for crossovers and light trucks."
General Motors,2017-6,The company added that was its best performance for May in eight years. It contrasted with a 16.4 percent drop in sales in May 2016 versus the year-earlier period.
General Motors,2017-6,"Fiat Chrysler said it sold 33,186 vehicles, up 5 percent from May 2016 and the highest monthly Canadian sales in its history."

General Motors,2017-6,"DETROIT, June 1 (Reuters) - The pace of U.S. car and light truck sales slowed in May for the third month in a row despite steep discounts, but investors bid up shares of General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co after executives outlined plans to cut inventories."
General Motors,2017-6,"Automakers reported sales fell 1 percent from a year ago. This brought the annualized sales pace down to 16.66 million cars and light trucks from 17.17 million vehicles a year ago, according to figures compiled by Motor Intelligence. May is the third straight month that the sales pace has declined from a year earlier."
General Motors,2017-6,"GM and Ford executives expressed hope that demand for new cars and trucks will stabilize in the second half of 2017, and said recent high levels of unsold cars will decline. Yet analysts warned that carmakers may have to continue heavy discounts or slash production due to issues ranging from rising interest rates to a glut of used cars."
General Motors,2017-6,"Ford shares closed up 2.6 percent at $11.41. GM shares closed 1.5 percent higher at $34.43. Both stocks remained lower for the year to date. Ford led U.S. sales gains in May. GM, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T> posted modest declines."
General Motors,2017-6,"""Underlying economic conditions are still positive,"" said Ford U.S. sales vice president Mark LaNeve, citing low interest rates and gasoline prices and high consumer confidence."
General Motors,2017-6,"Ford said it has trimmed its inventory of unsold vehicles to 59 days, which the industry considers normal."
General Motors,2017-6,"GM's supply was 101 days, but the automaker said that largely represented pickup trucks built to carry dealers through extended retooling shutdowns later this year ahead of the launch of a new generation of Chevrolet Silverados and GMC Sierra trucks."
General Motors,2017-6,"Total factory downtime related to these model changes would cut 100,000 vehicles from inventory during the second half, GM said in a statement. It also reiterated a promise that by the end of the year, it would return inventories to their levels at the end of 2016."
General Motors,2017-6,"Ford, bolstered by heavy sales to fleet customers, surpassed GM in U.S. sales in May. Ford sales rose 2.2 percent from a year ago to 241,126 units. GM sales dropped 1.3 percent to 237,364."
General Motors,2017-6,GM said it had been trimming sales of heavily discounted vehicles to car rental companies. Such fleet sales made up about 19 percent of its total sales in May.
General Motors,2017-6,"In an interview, GM Chief Economist Mustafa Mohatarem said the sliding value of used cars has discouraged automakers from offering deep discounts on new vehicles to rental car companies. Hertz, Avis and other rental companies either will have to pay higher prices, he said, or automakers will cut production further in hopes of supporting used-car resale values."
General Motors,2017-6,"Ford's fleet sales rose 8.4 percent, representing more than 34 percent of total sales. The industry average is around 20 percent."
General Motors,2017-6,"Fiat Chrysler Automobiles said May sales dipped 0.9 percent to 193,040. Toyota Motor Co's <7203.T> U.S. sales dropped 0.5 percent to 218,248. Honda Motor Co <7267.T> was up 0.9 percent, to 148,414, while Nissan Motor Co <7201.T> rose 3.0 percent, to 137,471."
General Motors,2017-6,"Manufacturers and dealers ""really pushed the deals over the holiday weekend to prop up their May numbers,"" said Jessica Caldwell, executive director of industry analysis at Edmunds, the car shopping website."
General Motors,2017-6,"General Motors dealers were offering discounts of up to $12,000 on the full-size Chevrolet Silverado pickup, while some dealer discounts on Ford Motor Co's F-series pickups were more than $10,000 on 2017 models and more than $14,000 on leftover 2016 models."

General Motors,2017-6,"WASHINGTON, June 1 (Reuters) - More than 65 percent of 46.2 million recalled Takata Corp <7312.T> airbag inflators in the United States have not been repaired, a U.S. senator said on Thursday, urging automakers to speed up the pace of repairs."
General Motors,2017-6,"Senator Bill Nelson of Florida said only 15.8 million inflators out of 46.2 million inflators recalled to date have been repaired through mid-May, though nationwide recalls began in 2015. He was citing answers submitted from a National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) independent monitor."
General Motors,2017-6,"About 8.8 million owners had received recall notices, Nelson said, but they were told no replacement parts were currently available."
General Motors,2017-6,"The affected Takata inflators can explode with excessive force, unleashing metal shrapnel inside cars and trucks. They have been blamed for at least 16 deaths and more than 180 injuries worldwide."
General Motors,2017-6,"Inflator recalls began around 2008 and involve around 100 million inflators around the world used in vehicles made by 19 automakers, including Honda Motor Co <7267.T>, Ford Motor Co , Volkswagen AG and Tesla Inc ."
General Motors,2017-6,"Takata spokesman Jared Levy said the company ""has dramatically increased the production of airbag replacement kits."" Takata has shipped over 26 million replacement kits, two-thirds of which include inflators manufactured by other suppliers, Levy said."
General Motors,2017-6,"Last month, four automakers involved in the recalls agreed to a $553 million settlement covering owners of nearly 16 million vehicles with Takata airbag inflators, and agreed to take new steps to encourage owners to get recall repairs made. [nL2N1IL1O0]"
General Motors,2017-6,"Toyota Motor Corp's <7203.T> share of the settlement costs is $278.5 million, followed by BMW AG at $131 million, Mazda Motor Co <7261.T> at $76 million and Subaru Corp <7270.T> at $68 million."
General Motors,2017-6,"Nelson noted the administration of President Donald Trump still had not nominated a candidate to lead NHTSA. ""We're in desperate need of a leader who will commit to resolving this Takata mess,"" Nelson said in a statement."
General Motors,2017-6,"In February, Takata pleaded guilty to U.S. charges of criminal wrongdoing and to pay $1 billion to resolve a federal investigation into its inflators."
General Motors,2017-6,"The majority of the air bag-related fatalities and injuries have occurred in the United States, and most of them in Honda vehicles."
General Motors,2017-6,"Automakers have recalled 46 million Takata air bag inflators in 29 million U.S. vehicles. By 2019, automakers will recall 64 million to 69 million U.S. inflators in 42 million total vehicles, NHTSA said in December."
General Motors,2017-6,Takata has been searching for more than a year for a financial sponsor to pay the replacement costs for its inflators which are at the center of the auto industry's biggest recall.

General Motors,2017-6,"Ford Motor Co said its U.S. sales inched up 2.2 percent to 241,126. Nissan Motor Co <7201.T> said U.S. sales in May rose 3.0 percent, to 137,471, amid record demand for its trucks, crossovers and SUVs."
General Motors,2017-6,"After demand fell in March and April, analysts estimated May sales at just over 1.5 million. The seasonally adjusted annual rate of sales in May was estimated at 16.8 million to 16.9 million vehicles, about the same as April. A year earlier, sales stood at 17.55 million vehicles."
General Motors,2017-6,Early reports indicate that sales over the three-day Memorial Day weekend were helped by heavy discounts.
General Motors,2017-6,"""While demand for new vehicles is still relatively strong, it's a bit of smoke and mirrors,"" said Jessica Caldwell, executive director of industry analysis at Edmunds, the car shopping website."
General Motors,2017-6,"Manufacturers and dealers ""really pushed the deals over the holiday weekend to prop up their May numbers,"" she said. ""Incentives were up sharply, and it seems automakers are putting more cash on the hood to nudge car shoppers to buy versus lease."""
General Motors,2017-6,"General Motors dealers were offering discounts of up to $12,000 on the full-size Chevrolet Silverado pickup, while some dealer discounts on Ford Motor Co's F-series pickups were more than $10,000 on 2017 models and more than $14,000 on leftover 2016 models. The 2017 model year started eight months ago."
General Motors,2017-6,"Some automakers also continued to cut back on low-margin sales to rental car fleets. GM said its fleet sales in May were about 10 percent of its total sales, compared with an industry average of around 20 percent."

General Motors,2017-6,"WASHINGTON, June 1 (Reuters) - More than 65 percent of 46.2 million recalled Takata Corp <7312.T> airbag inflators in the United States have not been repaired, a U.S. senator said on Thursday, urging automakers to speed up the pace of repairs."
General Motors,2017-6,"Senator Bill Nelson of Florida said only 15.8 million inflators out of 46.2 million inflators recalled to date have been repaired through mid-May, though nationwide recalls began in 2015. He was citing answers submitted from a National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) independent monitor."
General Motors,2017-6,"About 8.8 million owners had received recall notices, Nelson said, but they were told no replacement parts were currently available."
General Motors,2017-6,"The affected Takata inflators can explode with excessive force, unleashing metal shrapnel inside cars and trucks. They have been blamed for at least 16 deaths and more than 180 injuries worldwide."
General Motors,2017-6,"Inflator recalls began around 2008 and involve around 100 million inflators around the world used in vehicles made by 19 automakers, including Honda Motor Co <7267.T>, Ford Motor Co , Volkswagen AG and Tesla Inc ."

General Motors,2017-6,"Nelson noted the administration of President Donald Trump still had not nominated a candidate to lead NHTSA. ""We're in desperate need of a leader who will commit to resolving this Takata mess,"" Nelson said in a statement."
General Motors,2017-6,"In February, Takata pleaded guilty to U.S. charges of criminal wrongdoing and to pay $1 billion to resolve a federal investigation into its inflators."
General Motors,2017-6,"The majority of the air bag-related fatalities and injuries have occurred in the United States, and most of them in Honda vehicles."
General Motors,2017-6,"Automakers have recalled 46 million Takata air bag inflators in 29 million U.S. vehicles. By 2019, automakers will recall 64 million to 69 million U.S. inflators in 42 million total vehicles, NHTSA said in December."

General Motors,2017-6,"The move, ordered by the government, puts an end to a decade-long practice under which locally produced cars were sold for dollars, forcing ordinary Uzbeks to buy foreign currency on the black market."
General Motors,2017-6,The former Soviet republic's sum currency trades for less than half its official value on the informal market due to severe foreign exchange restrictions which businessmen say are the main obstacle to foreign investment.
General Motors,2017-6,"The switch to local currency car sales follows the death of strongman ruler Islam Karimov last year after 27 years in power. His successor, former prime minister Shavkat Mirziyoyev has taken some steps to reform the economy which is largely run along old Soviet lines."
General Motors,2017-6,"GM Uzbekistan, which produces more than 200,000 cars a year, had previously sold only a few select models, mostly the most expensive ones in their lines, for sums."
General Motors,2017-6,"The prices announced on Thursday and published by Uzbek news websites such as Kun.uz imply an exchange rate of about 10,000 sums per dollar against the central bank exchange rate of 3,846."
General Motors,2017-6,"Mirziyoyev has said his government would liberalise the foreign exchange market, but the timeframe and the scale of the planned reform remain unclear."
General Motors,2017-6,"The GM Uzbekistan venture, in which General Motors has a 25 percent stake, is the only carmaker in the nation of 32 million whose market is strongly protected by high import duties. The company imports many of the components for its cars."
