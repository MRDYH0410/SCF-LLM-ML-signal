General Motors,2017-7,"{{20170731T100001.261+0000}}Ford CEO Hackett reviewing future products, plants, countries -sourcesBy Paul Lienert and Joseph White"
General Motors,2017-7,"July 31 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co Chief Executive Jim Hackett is reviewing the automaker's operations in India and other markets, as well as Ford's future product programs including plans to build a self-driving commercial vehicle in 2021, according to company officials and other sources familiar with that review."
General Motors,2017-7,"Hackett, who took over as CEO in May, has told investors he is working on a 100-day review of Ford's operations but has so far provided few details of the process, except to indicate that it is looking at the automakers' luxury vehicle strategy, the future of its small vehicles and investments in emerging markets."
General Motors,2017-7,"Ford Chief Financial Officer Bob Shanks told Reuters in an interview that the review covers a range of issues, including Ford's strategy for India."
General Motors,2017-7,"""We have a lot of work to do (as) we address issues of how to fix India,"" Shanks said. ""Everything is on the table."""
General Motors,2017-7,"General Motors Co in May said it would stop selling cars in India but continue to produce vehicles there for export. [nL4N1IK1ZS] Shanks said no decisions have been made and noted that Ford has a larger business in India than GM did. ""We are very cognizant that will be the third-largest market in the world,"" he said."
General Motors,2017-7,"""Some big decisions will be made,"" Shanks said, but he cautioned Ford may not disclose all those decisions at the end of the 100-day review."
General Motors,2017-7,Hackett is addressing challenges that have contributed to a nearly 8 percent decline in Ford's share price this year.
General Motors,2017-7,"The review of the Lincoln luxury brand includes whether current plans will meet former CEO Mark Fields' ambitious targets for growth and revenue, people familiar with the process said."
General Motors,2017-7,"Ford has set a target of putting a self-driving shuttle into commercial ride-sharing fleets by 2021. Hackett is reviewing the investment and timing for that project, the sources said."
General Motors,2017-7,"Hackett also assessing whether to reduce and consolidate production of models such as the Fiesta subcompact and two midsized sedans that are built in multiple locations around the world, but are experiencing slowing demand."
General Motors,2017-7,"One proposal would shift production of the next-generation Mondeo mid-sized sedan from Europe to Mexico, where it would share an assembly line with its sibling, the Ford Fusion, avoiding the cost of retooling two plants."
General Motors,2017-7,"Shortly after he took charge, Hackett approved a proposal to shift production of the next-generation Focus for North America from Mexico to China, saving the company an estimated $500 million by consolidating two factories into one."
General Motors,2017-7,"Hackett also is said to be questioning a plan to build at least half a dozen future models, including replacements for the Ford Mustang and Explorer and Lincoln Continental, on a new flexible platform that is designed to accommodate both front- and rear-wheel-drive vehicles."

General Motors,2017-7,{{20170728T225749.800+0000}}Union cheers as trucks kept out of U.S. self-driving legislationBy David Shepardson
General Motors,2017-7,"WASHINGTON, July 28 (Reuters) - The Teamsters union on Friday praised House lawmakers for keeping self-driving commercial trucks out of a proposed bill aimed at speeding deployment of the advanced technology for cars."
General Motors,2017-7,"The U.S. House Energy and Committee on Thursday unanimously approved a bill that would hasten the use of self-driving cars without human controls and bar states from blocking autonomous vehicles. The measure only applies to vehicles under 10,000 pounds and not large commercial trucks."
General Motors,2017-7,"The 1.4-million-member union, hoping to protect the jobs of truck drivers, has been lobbying at the federal and state levels to slow legislation to make it easier for companies to roll out self-driving trucks."
General Motors,2017-7,"Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao has said she is ""very concerned"" about the impact of self-driving cars on U.S. jobs, a big part of President Donald Trump's campaign message."
General Motors,2017-7,"""It is vital that Congress ensure that any new technology is used to make transportation safer and more effective, not used to put workers at risk on the job or destroy livelihoods,"" Teamsters President James P. Hoffa said in a statement, adding the union wants more changes in the House measure."
General Motors,2017-7,"Teamsters officials have been involved in talks with Senate aides, seeking to exclude commercial trucks from a similar bill setting federal regulations for autonomous vehicles, lobbyists said. The Senate proposal has not been made public yet."
General Motors,2017-7,"The House bill would allow automakers to obtain exemptions to deploy up to 25,000 vehicles without meeting existing auto safety standards in the first year, a cap that would rise to 100,000 vehicles annually over three years."
General Motors,2017-7,Auto industry leaders have said 3 million commercial truck jobs could eventually be at risk if self-driving vehicles replaced human drivers.
General Motors,2017-7,"Alphabet Inc's self-driving car unit Waymo is working on developing self-driving trucks, the company said last month."
General Motors,2017-7,"Other companies have also been working on self-driving trucks. Ride services company Uber Technologies [UBER.UL] is working on autonomous trucking through its Otto unit, which it acquired last year."
General Motors,2017-7,"Tesla Inc , which is working on self-driving technologies, plans to unveil a commercial truck called the Tesla Semi in September."
General Motors,2017-7,The Teamsters have opposed efforts by states to approve plans by logistics companies to use platooning technology that could reduce driver jobs by allowing a pack of trucks to be digitally connected and driven in formation.
General Motors,2017-7,Missouri Governor Eric Greitens approved a revised platooning measure this year that requires a driver in the cab of each truck. His predecessor Jay Nixon vetoed platoon testing last year.

General Motors,2017-7,"{{20170727T205612.871+0000}}GM Cadillac chief outlines plan for fewer sedans, more electricsBy Joseph White"
General Motors,2017-7,"DETROIT, July 27 (Reuters) - The head of General Motors Co's Cadillac luxury division said on Thursday the brand will shrink its lineup of sedans and expand its offerings of sport utility vehicles and hybrid and electric vehicles in response to market shifts."
General Motors,2017-7,"Expanding Cadillac's global sales is central to GM's overall profit strategy, and Cadillac has reported a 27 percent increase in worldwide sales through the first half of the year."
General Motors,2017-7,"However, in the United States, now the brand's second largest market behind China, Cadillac sales are down 1.6 percent and combined sales of the brand's four sedan models have plummeted 16.3 percent through the first half of the year."
General Motors,2017-7,"That has forced GM to order layoffs at two Michigan factories that build Cadillac cars, and raised questions about the long term future of the plants. [nL1N1KB1WT]"
General Motors,2017-7,"""We have to rebalance our sedan"" portfolio, Johan de Nysschen told Reuters in interview, offering new details about the strategy."
General Motors,2017-7,"Cadillac will not directly replace the current XTS, CTS or ATS sedans when they end their life cycles in 2019, he said. Instead, Cadillac will use a single new car called the CT5 to appeal to consumers shopping for sedans priced between $35,000 and $45,000. New versions of the CT6 sedan will be offered to customers who want a larger car starting at $50,000."
General Motors,2017-7,"The CT5 will be built at a factory near Lansing, Michigan, that currently builds the slow-selling Cadillac ATS and CTS models. A small luxury sedan to compete with the Audi A3 will be built in the same plant, de Nysschen said."
General Motors,2017-7,"Cadillac will offer more SUVs, starting with a compact model called XT4, followed by a larger SUV with three rows of seats due by 2019 to compete with vehicles such as Volvo's current XC90 model."
General Motors,2017-7,"Volvo, owned by China's Zhejiang Geely Holding Group [GEELY.UL], scored a public relations coup by announcing plans earlier this month to power all its vehicles with either hybrid or all-electric technology starting in 2019. The move challenges Tesla Inc , which has eclipsed more established brands with tech savvy luxury buyers. [nL8N1JW0JU]"
General Motors,2017-7,"Cadillac has plans ""not dissimilar to what Volvo has announced,"" with more electrified vehicles launching in the second half of the next decade, de Nysschen said."
General Motors,2017-7,"To stay abreast of Tesla and others in the industry's technology race, Cadillac will launch later this year its Super Cruise system that enables hands-free driving up to 85 miles (137 km) per hour."

General Motors,2017-7,"{{20170727T163012.253+0000}}UPDATE 1-U.S. House panel approves legislation to speed deployment of self-driving cars(Adds details and comments from hearing, paragraphs 4-14)"
General Motors,2017-7,"WASHINGTON, July 27 (Reuters) - An influential U.S. House committee on Thursday approved a revised bipartisan bill on a 54-0 vote that would speed the deployment of self-driving cars without human controls and bar states from blocking autonomous vehicles."
General Motors,2017-7,"The bill would allow automakers to obtain exemptions to deploy up to 25,000 vehicles without meeting existing auto safety standards in the first year, a cap that would rise to 100,000 vehicles annually over three years."
General Motors,2017-7,"Automakers and technology companies believe chances are good Congress will approve legislation before year end. They have been pushing for regulations making it easier to deploy self-driving technology, while consumer groups have sought more safeguards. Current federal rules bar self-driving cars without human controls on U.S. roads and automakers think proposed state rules in California are too restrictive."
General Motors,2017-7,"The measure, the first significant federal legislation aimed at speeding self-driving cars to market, would require automakers to submit safety assessment reports to regulators, but would not require pre-market approval of advanced vehicle technologies."
General Motors,2017-7,"The House of Representatives will take up the bill when it reconvenes in September, while senators plan to introduce a separate similar measure."
General Motors,2017-7,"""Our aim was to develop a regulatory structure that allows for industry to safely innovate with significant government oversight,"" said Representative Greg Walden, who chairs the House Energy and Commerce Committee."
General Motors,2017-7,"Initially, authors proposed to allow automakers and others to sell up to 100,000 vehicles immediately. Representative Frank Pallone said the phase-in period was essential so ""millions of exempted cars will not hit our roads all at once."""
General Motors,2017-7,Manufacturers must demonstrate self-driving cars winning exemptions are at least as safe as existing vehicles.
General Motors,2017-7,"Under the House proposal, states could still set rules on registration, licensing, liability, insurance and safety inspections, but could not set self-driving car performance standards."
General Motors,2017-7,"Automakers praised committee passage, while Consumer Watchdog privacy director John Simpson said preempting state laws ""leaves us at the mercy of manufacturers as they use our public highways as their private laboratories."""
General Motors,2017-7,"General Motors Co , Alphabet Inc , Tesla Inc , Volkswagen AG and others have been lobbying for legislation to speed deployment of self-driving cars. Consumer advocates want more changes, including giving the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration quicker access to crash data and more funding to oversee self-driving cars."
General Motors,2017-7,"The issue has taken on new urgency since U.S. road deaths rose 7.7 percent in 2015, the highest annual jump since 1966."
General Motors,2017-7,"Automakers say that without changes in regulations, U.S. self-driving car testing could move to Europe and elsewhere."

General Motors,2017-7,{{20170727T150254.749+0000}}REFILE-U.S. jobless claims rise from three-month low(Refiles to fix formatting)
General Motors,2017-7,"WASHINGTON, July 27 (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits rebounded from a three-month low last week, but remained below a level consistent with a tightening labor market."
General Motors,2017-7,"Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 10,000 to a seasonally adjusted 244,000 for the week ended July 22, the Labor Department said on Thursday."
General Motors,2017-7,"Data for the prior week was revised to show 1,000 more applications received than previously reported. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims rising to 241,000."
General Motors,2017-7,"It was the 125th straight week that claims remained below 300,000, a threshold associated with a robust labor market. That is the longest such stretch since 1970, when the labor market was smaller. The labor market is near full employment, with the jobless rate at 4.4 percent."
General Motors,2017-7,Claims have been volatile in recent weeks as automakers shut assembly plants for annual retooling. Some manufacturers like General Motors are extending their summer shutdowns to manage excess inventory from declining sales.
General Motors,2017-7,"Economists say this could be throwing off the model used by the government to strip out seasonal fluctuations from the data, causing swings in the weekly numbers."
General Motors,2017-7,A Labor Department official said there were no special factors influencing the claims data and that no states had been estimated.
General Motors,2017-7,"The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, was unchanged at 244,000 last week."
General Motors,2017-7,"Labor market strength likely keeps the Federal Reserve on track to announce a plan to start reducing its $4.2 trillion portfolio of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities in September and raise interest rates in December for a third time this year, despite a recent moderation in inflation pressures."
General Motors,2017-7,"The U.S. central bank left rates unchanged on Wednesday and said it expected to start winding down its portfolio ""relatively soon."""
General Motors,2017-7,"Thursday's claims report also showed the number of people still receiving benefits after an initial week of aid fell 13,000 to 1.96 million in the week ended July 15. The so-called continuing claims have now been below 2 million for 15 straight weeks, pointing to diminishing labor market slack."
General Motors,2017-7,"The four-week moving average of continuing claims rose 4,750 to 1.96 million, remaining below the 2 million mark for 13 consecutive weeks."
General Motors,2017-7,"The continuing claims data covered the survey period for July's unemployment rate. The four-week average of continuing claims increased 25,750 between the June and July survey weeks, suggesting an uptick in the unemployment rate."

General Motors,2017-7,{{20170726T230101.815+0000}}UK car industry says clarity needed now as Brexit weighsBy William Schomberg
General Motors,2017-7,"LONDON, July 27 (Reuters) - Britain's car-makers and traders are starting to feel the strains of Brexit, and output this year is likely fall short of the industry's expectations, the head of the leading UK group in the sector said."
General Motors,2017-7,"Mike Hawes, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, said the government needed to say now what its plans were for the sector when Britain left the European Union in 2019."
General Motors,2017-7,"The number of cars made in Britain in June slumped by almost 14 percent year on year to 136,901, the SMMT said on Thursday."
General Motors,2017-7,"That left first half output in a sector that supports more than 800,000 jobs down nearly 3 percent at 866,656 units."
General Motors,2017-7,"Although that represented the second-highest January-June performance in 12 years and a pick-up was likely later in the year, output in 2017 would probably be closer to 1.8 million units than a previous forecast of 1.9 million, Hawes said."
General Motors,2017-7,Britain's car industry has boomed in recent years with global manufacturers investing heavily in the country as a base for selling to the rest of the EU and beyond. More than half of the cars exported from Britain go to the EU.
General Motors,2017-7,"But last year's decision by voters to leave the bloc has left the industry exposed. The bloc has tariffs of 10 percent on car imports, posing a risk if Britain leaves in under two years' time with no new trade deal in place."
General Motors,2017-7,"The impact of the referendum on the country's consumers is another problem for car-makers. Households have been pinched by a sharp rise in inflation, caused in large part by the fall in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote."
General Motors,2017-7,"Cars made for the domestic market were down nearly 10 percent in the first six months of 2017 while exports - which account for nearly 80 percent of output - were roughly stable, SMMT figures showed."
General Motors,2017-7,"The SMMT's long-held target of increasing production to just under 2 million units in 2020 was also in doubt, with changing assumptions about individual company decisions on their models also a factor."
General Motors,2017-7,"Britain could miss the target by 10 percent if it fails to secure an interim deal with the EU, Hawes said."
General Motors,2017-7,"The SMMT, like other British industry groups, wants the country to stay in the EU's single market and customs union as it transitions to a future trading relationship with the EU, something the government is ruling out."
General Motors,2017-7,"""The government has been in listening mode but now it must put on the table the concrete plans that will assure the future competitiveness of the sector,"" Hawes said."
General Motors,2017-7,"A fall in investment this year was another sign of Brexit concerns, even if some of the drop had been expected after strong levels in recent years, he said."
General Motors,2017-7,"The industry also faces the challenge of shifting away from petrol- and diesel-fuelled cars. On Wednesday, the government said it would ban such vehicles from 2040 to promote electric cars. [nL5N1KH21I]"

General Motors,2017-7,"DETROIT, July 26 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co on Wednesday joined rival General Motors Co in reporting higher-than-expected second-quarter profits, and in the next breath warning of a rougher ride for the rest of the year."
General Motors,2017-7,"Ford said full-year pre-tax profit, automotive operating margins and cash flow would be lower than 2016 results, sending the company's shares down 2.1 percent."
General Motors,2017-7,"Rival GM on Tuesday reported headline profits that beat analysts' estimates, but warned that profits for the second half of the year will likely be lower than the first half, as the company scales back scale back North American production to cut its burgeoning inventories. [nL1N1KG0CT]"
General Motors,2017-7,"Ford and GM's results present a counterpoint to other big U.S. companies reporting strong profits, including heavy equipment maker Caterpillar Inc , aircraft maker Boeing Co and telecommunications power AT&T Inc . [nL3N1KH4VH]"
General Motors,2017-7,"Investors worry that for Detroit's automakers, the second quarter marks a peak and profits are headed downhill. Thousands of workers at GM's U.S. factories are dealing with short- and long-term layoffs as production of slow-selling sedans is throttled back."
General Motors,2017-7,"Ford's new Chief Executive, Jim Hackett, on Wednesday promised investors a rethink of Ford's spending, marketing and investment strategy within his first 100 days, focusing on the company's approach to emerging markets, small cars and its Lincoln luxury brand."
General Motors,2017-7,"In the meantime, Ford is contending with sliding sales and rising costs. Ford's global sales fell by 43,000 vehicles in the quarter, and the company Ford said its full-year margin in North America, its most profitable market, would be lower than in 2016 due to $1.2 billion in additional commodity costs, costlier price cuts and engineering expenses."
General Motors,2017-7,"Ford Chief Financial Officer Bob Shanks told Reuters on Wednesday the company would be concerned if the United States imposed new tariffs on imported steel, as the Trump Administration is considering. ""It would give producers here the opportunity to raise prices,"" he said."
General Motors,2017-7,"Ford reported second-quarter net income of $2.04 billion, or 51 cents per share, up from nearly $2 billion, or 49 cents per share, a year earlier. A big contributor was a lower tax rate of 15 percent, half the level analysts had expected."
General Motors,2017-7,"Excluding one-time items, Ford earned 56 cents a share, and on that basis analysts, on average, looked for 43 cents."
General Motors,2017-7,"It forecast full-year adjusted earnings per share in a range from $1.65 to $1.85, above the $1.51 expected by Wall Street, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. However, the company has already booked 96 cents a share in adjusted profit - more than half its full-year target. GM has also generated more than half its full year target of $6 to $6.50 a share."

General Motors,2017-7,"DETROIT, July 26 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co on Wednesday reported a better-than-expected quarterly net profit due to a lower tax rate and increased U.S. sales of more-profitable pickup trucks, but forecast a slightly lower 2017 pre-tax profit, sending its shares down 2.3 percent."
General Motors,2017-7,"Against a backdrop of declining sales for the U.S. auto industry, Ford leaned heavily on consumer discounts during the quarter and the value of its unsold vehicles rose. Ford warned its full-year automotive operating margin and cash flow would be lower than in 2016."
General Motors,2017-7,"The No. 2 U.S. automaker said, however, a reduced tax rate would boost its full-year net profit. The results are the first for Chief Executive Jim Hackett since Ford ousted his predecessor in late May and elected him to the top spot."
General Motors,2017-7,Hackett has promised a broad-reaching review of Ford's operations within his first 100 days.
General Motors,2017-7,Analysts are concerned about the high discounts that Ford and other automakers are relying on to sell cars and high supplies of unsold vehicles.
General Motors,2017-7,"Ford's global sales were down 43,000 vehicles in the quarter, with 8,000 of that coming in the U.S. market. Ford said its full-year margin in North America would be lower than in 2016 due to rising commodity costs and engineering expenses."
General Motors,2017-7,"Rival General Motors Co on Tuesday reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit, helped by cost-cutting, and promised to scale back production to cut its burgeoning inventories. [nL1N1KG0CT]"
General Motors,2017-7,"Ford said it now expect full-year adjusted earnings per share in a range from $1.65 to $1.85, above the $1.51 expected by Wall Street, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S."
General Motors,2017-7,But Chief Financial Officer Bob Shanks said this would be largely due to a 2017 tax rate of 15 percent as Ford pulls forward deferred tax losses from outside the United States and could be affected by U.S. market conditions. Wall Street had expected an effective tax rate of 30 percent for 2017.
General Motors,2017-7,"Shanks said Ford's pre-tax profit would be slightly lower than the $9 billion Ford has previously forecast, after a record of $10.4 billion in 2016."
General Motors,2017-7,"In a research note for clients, Buckingham Research Group analyst Joseph Amaturo wrote that stripping out the impact of the lower tax rate, the midpoint of Ford's full-year earnings outlook is below analyst expectations."
General Motors,2017-7,"""We recommend investors remain on the sidelines given our concerns for lower U.S. industry volumes... and continued pricing pressure we expect for the back half of the year, which likely puts profitability under pressure,"" he wrote."
General Motors,2017-7,"Ford's CFO said the company has canceled plans to build the next generation of its compact Focus model in South America. For the North American market, Ford announced last month that it would move production of the Focus to China from Mexico."
General Motors,2017-7,"The company reported second-quarter net income of $2.04 billion, or 51 cents per share, up from just under $2 billion, or 49 cents per share, a year earlier.

General Motors,2017-7,"{{20170725T181540.294+0000}}UPDATE 2-U.S. may revise 2021 fuel efficiency standards, freeze targets(Adds comment from environmental group, Trump administration meetings with automakers, more details of review)"
General Motors,2017-7,"WASHINGTON, July 25 (Reuters) - The U.S. Transportation Department said on Tuesday it may revise auto fuel efficiency requirements starting with the 2021 model year, a year earlier than previously disclosed, and could adopt lower standards through 2025."
General Motors,2017-7,"In March, President Donald Trump ordered a review of U.S. vehicle fuel-efficiency standards from model year 2022 through 2025 established under the Obama administration. U.S. regulators said in a notice published Tuesday they are preparing a new environmental impact statement and could decide to freeze 2021 standards through 2025, rather than raising them every year."
General Motors,2017-7,"The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a trade group representing General Motors Co , Volkswagen AG , Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T> and others, said in a statement the environmental review ""must happen regardless of what future standards are."""
General Motors,2017-7,"The group argues ""facts need to drive public policy, including data on consumer sales, gas prices and costs of technology"" in determining the final standards."
General Motors,2017-7,"The Obama administration's rules, negotiated with automakers in 2011, were aimed at doubling average fleet-wide fuel efficiency to about 50 miles per gallon by 2025."
General Motors,2017-7,The Obama administration said the rules would save motorists $1.7 trillion in fuel costs over the life of the vehicles but cost the auto industry about $200 billion over 13 years.
General Motors,2017-7,"Under the 2011 deal, the 2022-2025 model year rules must be finalized by April 2018. Trump reopened a review of those rules after automakers said the Obama administration did not conduct a proper review to ensure the rules are feasible."
General Motors,2017-7,"Under federal law, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration must set ""maximum feasible"" Corporate Average Fuel Economy requirements, while considering ""technological feasibility, economic practicability... and the need of the United States to conserve energy."""
General Motors,2017-7,"The White House recently invited automakers to attend meetings with officials to talk about the review, officials briefed on the matter said."
General Motors,2017-7,"Sierra Club's Andrew Linhardt said freezing the fuel efficiency standards could ""hurt the American people just to pad the pockets of big oil and auto executives."""
General Motors,2017-7,"NHTSA said in its notice Tuesday it will consider a number of options - including continuing the 2021 requirements through 2025, rather than requiring yearly increases."
General Motors,2017-7,"Under current rules, fleetwide average fuel economy is expected to be around 41 miles per gallon in 2021, compared to an average of nearly 50 miles per gallon in 2025."
General Motors,2017-7,The agency also said it is considering giving automakers additional flexibility for prior model years to meet requirements.

General Motors,2017-7,"{{20170725T174641.415+0000}}UPDATE 5-GM promises to cut high inventory as profit beats expectations(Adds Breakingviews link, updates share price)"
General Motors,2017-7,"DETROIT, July 25 (Reuters) - General Motors Co on Tuesday reported a better-than-expected quarterly net profit, helped by cost cuts, and promised to cut production in the second half to curtail its burgeoning U.S. inventory of unsold vehicles."
General Motors,2017-7,The No. 1 U.S. automaker also maintained its earnings outlook for 2017 despite falling revenue. Shares were up 0.7 percent at $36.07 at mid-afternoon.
General Motors,2017-7,GM Chief Financial Officer Chuck Stevens cautioned in a call with analysts that production of its profitable large pickup trucks in North America could fall by 10 percent in 2018 as a new generation of trucks is launched.
General Motors,2017-7,"However, Stevens said GM could maintain 10 percent pre-tax profit margins in North America if overall sales remain close to 17 million vehicles a year."
General Motors,2017-7,"The results excluded nearly $800 million in losses from the company's European operations, which are being sold to France's PSA Group ."
General Motors,2017-7,"GM reported second-quarter net income of $2.4 billion or $1.60 per share, down from $2.8 billion or $1.74 per share a year earlier."
General Motors,2017-7,"Excluding one-time charges, earnings per share of $1.89 beat analyst estimates of $1.69."
General Motors,2017-7,"Revenue for the quarter was $37 billion, down from $37.4 billion a year earlier and below the $40.1 billion expected by analysts."
General Motors,2017-7,Wall Street is concerned the U.S. auto industry is entering a downturn after several years of strong sales. Automakers have reported declining sales for the past four months.
General Motors,2017-7,"GM sold 30,000 fewer cars in the quarter, with much of the decline driven by lower sales to rental car agencies. At the end of June, it had a 105-day supply of cars, above the 90-day supply it told investors to expect back in April. The company said second-quarter U.S. dealer inventories jumped 273,000 versus the same period in 2016."
General Motors,2017-7,"GM plans to cut North American production by 150,000 vehicles in the second half of 2017 from the first, CFO Stevens told reporters."
General Motors,2017-7,"Stevens said GM is on track to hit its North American inventories target to about 70 days' supply, and predicted sales in the second half of the year would rise."
General Motors,2017-7,GM's CFO also said earnings would be lower in the second half but the company said it still expected to earn between $6 and $6.50 per share in 2017.
General Motors,2017-7,"""That guidance could be difficult to achieve,"" Buckingham Research Group analyst Joseph Amaturo wrote in a client note."

General Motors,2017-7,(Adds material from a source close to the U.S. Department of Justice)
General Motors,2017-7,"FRANKFURT/HAMBURG, July 25 (Reuters) - Daimler's supervisory board will meet on Wednesday to discuss allegations that German carmakers were involved in anti-competitive behaviour, sources familiar with the matter said."
General Motors,2017-7,"European Union and German antitrust regulators are investigating whether BMW , VW , Porsche, Audi and Mercedes-Benz owner Daimler held meetings to discuss suppliers, prices and standards to the disadvantage of foreign carmakers. [nL5N1KD0AW]"
General Motors,2017-7,"The U.S. Justice Department's Antitrust Division is aware of the press reports, a source close to the department said."
General Motors,2017-7,"The division, along with antitrust enforcers in other countries, has had a long-running criminal probe into price-fixing in the auto parts industry that has led to dozens of companies paying criminal fines."
General Motors,2017-7,"While carmaker associations commonly discuss how to implement new emissions standards and technologies, the question being probed by regulators is whether talks among the German manufacturers constituted anti-competitive behaviour."
General Motors,2017-7,German magazine Der Spiegel reported on Friday that German carmakers colluded to fix the prices of diesel emissions treatment systems using industry committees. Companies found guilty of breaching EU cartel rules face fines of as much as 10 percent of their global revenue.
General Motors,2017-7,"A person familiar with the matter told Reuters on Tuesday that Daimler first raised the issue of collusion with cartel authorities, a move that could earn it immunity."
General Motors,2017-7,"Under EU rules, a company blowing the whistle on wrongful collusion usually escapes penalties. VW's MAN trucks division was spared any fines last year after disclosing price fixing with Daimler and other truckmakers prior to 2011. [nL8N1A520O]"
General Motors,2017-7,"Should wrongdoing be found, VW could be treated leniently too if, as reported by Der Spiegel, it also provided early evidence to cartel authorities."
General Motors,2017-7,"VW, Europe's largest automaker, will also hold a supervisory board meeting on Wednesday about the alleged collusion. [nL5N1KF1RW]"
General Motors,2017-7,"The auto industry committees allegedly used to fix prices operated outside of the official industry association VDA, which counts foreign suppliers and foreign-owned carmakers like Opel among its members."
General Motors,2017-7,"In a statement, VDA said compliance policies for members preclude anti-competitive behaviour, adding the issues being probed by regulators ""relate to a format which was not part of the VDA and its work""."

General Motors,2017-7,"{{20170725T161956.368+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-Despite help from SUVs, GM still isn't there yet(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.)"
General Motors,2017-7,"NEW YORK, July 25 (Reuters Breakingviews) - General Motors isn't there yet. The $54 billion U.S. automaker made more money than expected in the second quarter thanks to a shift from cars toward trucks and crossovers. Now, though, it's making too many smaller vehicles. After exiting unprofitable overseas markets, Chief Executive Mary Barra has to slim down at home, too."
General Motors,2017-7,Discipline has been Barra's hallmark since becoming the first woman to run a U.S. car company three and a half years ago. An agreement to sell the Opel and Vauxhall business in Europe to France's PSA and a partial exit from the Indian and South African markets have stanched most of GM's international bleeding.
General Motors,2017-7,"Losses and writedowns on those operations totaled more than $1.4 billion in the quarter, but excising them will boost free cash flow by $1 billion this year to an estimated $7 billion. What's left internationally is in stronger shape. GM made some money in China, where sales rose 1.6 percent, and broke even on an EBIT basis in South America on the back of a nearly 18 percent rise in vehicle sales."
General Motors,2017-7,"Chief Financial Officer Chuck Stevens promised to reduce inventories to a more normal 70-day supply from the current 105 days, but with the overall U.S. market softening that's a moving target. The company said it would slash production by 150,000 vehicles in the second half of the year compared with the first half, a 50 percent larger reduction than Stevens announced just last month."
General Motors,2017-7,"Washington provided some good news as the Department of Transportation said it may relax fuel-efficiency standards in 2021, a year earlier than planned. That should ease the risk of penalties for an automaker increasingly reliant on gas guzzlers, but it won't shift GM back into growth mode."
General Motors,2017-7,"- General Motors on July 25 reported net income attributable to shareholders of $1.7 billion, or $1.09 a share, in the three months ended June, down from $2.9 billion, or $1.81 per share, in the same period a year earlier."
General Motors,2017-7,"- Excluding losses and writedowns on international operations the company is selling or closing, GM's adjusted earnings for the quarter amounted to $1.89 a share, compared with analysts' consensus expectation of $1.69."
General Motors,2017-7,"- Revenue was $37 billion in the latest quarter, down 1.1 percent from a year earlier."
General Motors,2017-7,"- U.S. dealer inventories were up 273,000 from the same period a year earlier, to a 105-day supply. The company said it would reduce inventories to approximately 70 days worth of sales by the end of the year."
General Motors,2017-7,- The company reaffirmed guidance for adjusted earnings of $6.00 to $6.50 per share for all of 2017.
General Motors,2017-7,"- Separately, the U.S. Department of Transportation on July 25 said that it may revise federal fuel efficiency rules beginning in 2021, a year earlier than the Trump administration had previously planned."

General Motors,2017-7,"{{20170722T150744.334+0000}}Opel defends inclusion of employee leases in sales dataFRANKFURT, July 22 (Reuters) - German carmaker Opel, which is being bought by French rival PSA Group from General Motors , said on Saturday that its sales figures included cars pre-registered by Opel and leased by company workers and pensioners and their families."
General Motors,2017-7,"Car trade publication Automobilwoche, in an article due to appear in its July 24 edition, said the company only reached a market share of 7.1 percent in a first-half 2017 survey compiled by Automobilwoche because it included pre-registrations and heavy discounts."
General Motors,2017-7,"The trade weekly said if these so-called push-channels were not included, Opel would only have a market share of 4.5 percent and would be overtaken by Skoda, Volkswagen's Czech unit ."
General Motors,2017-7,"An Opel spokesman said there was nothing wrong with the count and because Opel was a German company, the number of such sales was necessarily higher than for importers of foreign cars."
General Motors,2017-7,"""In pre-registrations, Opel includes cars that employees and former employees (a total of 60,000 entitled people) may lease for themselves or their family members,"" he said."
General Motors,2017-7,"""We are glad that our staff stand behind Opel and that the number of our cars used privately by employees and their families is constantly on the increase,"" he added."

General Motors,2017-7,July 20 (Reuters) - The president of the United Auto Workers union said on Thursday the union is talking with General Motors Co about the potential threat to plants and jobs from slumping U.S. car sales.
General Motors,2017-7,"""We are talking to (GM) right now about the products that they currently have"" at underused car plants such as Hamtramck in Michigan and Lordstown in Ohio, and whether they might be replaced with newer, more popular vehicles such as crossovers, Dennis Williams told reporters."
General Motors,2017-7,"""We are tracking it (and) we are addressing it,"" Williams added."
General Motors,2017-7,GM has cut shifts at several U.S. plants this year as inventories of unsold cars have ballooned. Industry analysts said more jobs could be at risk as the automaker wrestles with permanently shrinking production of small and midsized sedans.
General Motors,2017-7,"GM is reviewing whether to cancel at least six passenger cars in the U.S. market after 2020, including the Chevrolet Volt hybrid, which could be replaced in 2022 with a new gasoline-electric crossover model, Reuters has learned from people familiar with the plans [nL1N1K81FQ]."
General Motors,2017-7,"Other GM cars at risk include the Buick LaCrosse, Cadillac CT6, Cadillac XTS, Chevrolet Impala and Chevrolet Sonic, sources said."
General Motors,2017-7,Some analysts have singled out GM's Hamtramck plant in Detroit as one of the most vulnerable because of plummeting car sales.
General Motors,2017-7,"The plant, which opened in 1985, builds four slow-selling models: Buick LaCrosse, Chevrolet Impala, Cadillac CT6 and Chevrolet Volt."
General Motors,2017-7,"In the first half, it built fewer than 35,000 cars, down 32 percent from the same period in 2016, according to suppliers familiar with GM's U.S. production schedule. The typical GM assembly plant builds 200,000-300,000 vehicles a year."
General Motors,2017-7,"GM must ""create some innovative new products"" to replace slow-selling sedans ""or start closing plants,"" said Sam Fiorani, vice president of AutoForecast Solutions."
General Motors,2017-7,"The auto maker already has begun to shift future production plans from cars to trucks, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch auto analyst John Murphy. He estimates that fewer than 10 percent of the new vehicle models that GM will introduce over the next four years will be passenger cars, with the rest divided among trucks, SUVs and crossovers."
General Motors,2017-7,"GM plans to add production of the new Cadillac XT4 crossover next year to its Malibu sedan plant in Fairfax, Kansas."
General Motors,2017-7,"The company is cutting production in the short term rather than dumping cars into rental car fleets at little or no profit, company executives have said."
General Motors,2017-7,"However, the long-term shift in demand toward SUVs calls into question the future of factories GM currently has dedicated to building sedans, analysts said."
General Motors,2017-7,"Alan Batey, president of GM's North American operations, told Reuters in an interview: ""I don't think we have too many"" sedans."""
General Motors,2017-7,"Batey said GM intends to reduce overall inventories to around 75 days by year-end from 105 currently. ""We're in a good place to have a good 2017,"" he said."
General Motors,2017-7,"The shift toward SUVs, fueled by cheap gasoline, is putting pressure on nearly all major automakers in the United States to simultaneously shift short-term production plans and rework long-term product programs that drive capital spending over several years."
General Motors,2017-7,"Sales of GM passenger cars plunged 17 percent in the first half and 36 percent in June, exceeding the industry-wide declines of 12 percent in the first half and 14 percent in June, according to Automotive News."
General Motors,2017-7,GM dealers ended June with as much as six months supply of certain models. Two months is considered normal.
General Motors,2017-7,"""There could be some consolidation"" of passenger car production in fewer U.S. plants, said Jeff Schuster, senior vice president of LMC Automotive. ""GM doesn't need all the sedans it has today."""

General Motors,2017-7,{{20170721T150001.424+0000}}Lyft accelerates efforts to develop self-driving carsBy Heather Somerville
General Motors,2017-7,"SAN FRANCISCO, July 21 (Reuters) - Lyft Inc has formed a self-driving car division, company executives said, a bold investment for the second-largest U.S. ride-services firm as it jockeys for position in the highly competitive autonomous vehicle race."
General Motors,2017-7,"The executives said on Thursday the company would soon open a facility in Palo Alto, California, that would eventually be staffed by ""several hundred"" engineers. Lyft engineers will collaborate there with autonomous vehicle experts from other companies to build self-driving systems."
General Motors,2017-7,"""We are putting down the accelerator significantly on investment on this,"" Raj Kapoor, chief strategy officer for Lyft, told reporters at its San Francisco headquarters."
General Motors,2017-7,"The move marks a striking strategy change for Lyft, which said previously it would leave the building of self-driving systems to others while allowing partners to test their autonomous cars in Lyft's ride-hailing network."
General Motors,2017-7,"Lyft previously announced partnerships with Alphabet's self-driving division, Waymo, technology company Nutonomy, and automakers General Motors Co and Jaguar Land Rover . Lyft's new effort could put it in direct competition with some of those partners."
General Motors,2017-7,"The company, which will not be manufacturing the actual cars, offered no time line for its self-driving ambitions. Executives said Lyft would share data from its self-driving efforts with other companies joining the collaboration."
General Motors,2017-7,"Lyft does not have a permit to test autonomous cars in California, according to the state Department of Motor Vehicles. The company plans to launch a pilot with Nutonomy in Boston by year-end."
General Motors,2017-7,"Building autonomous driving systems is a complicated and expensive endeavor, and brings a new layer of complexity to Lyft. Unlike its far larger rival, Uber Technologies Inc , which has tackled everything from food delivery to flying cars, and expanded overseas, Lyft has operated strictly as a ride service for people in the United States."
General Motors,2017-7,"Lyft's 700,000 drivers complete more than 200 million rides and 1.2 billion miles (1.9 billion km) a year in the 350 cities where it operates, which executives said gave the company detailed knowledge of traffic patterns, bridges, construction and other roadway data critical for building autonomous systems."
General Motors,2017-7,"""The one thing that is very, very key is the scale that we have,"" said Luc Vincent, vice president of engineering."
General Motors,2017-7,"None of those miles have been driven with autonomous technology, experts point out, meaning Lyft will be starting from scratch in a business where Waymo, Tesla and Uber have been operating for years."
General Motors,2017-7,"""It does still take a lot to do this, even if there is lots off-the-shelf technology, to engineer them together and create systems and put them in a vehicle,"" said Jeremy Carlson, an automotive analyst at IHS Markit."
General Motors,2017-7,Lyft's new push comes as Uber is facing a lawsuit from Waymo over alleged theft of trade secrets relating to self-driving technology designs.
General Motors,2017-7,"Lyft in April raised $600 million in new funding [nL1N1HJ1J3]. The company has begun preparations for an initial public offering, sources close to the company told Reuters."

General Motors,2017-7,GM has cut shifts at several U.S. plants this year to offset rapidly deteriorating car sales. Industry analysts said more jobs could be at risk as the automaker wrestles with how to permanently shrink production of unpopular sedans.
General Motors,2017-7,"Reuters has learned from sources familiar with GM's plans that the company is mulling whether to phase out U.S. production of at least six passenger cars after 2020, including the Chevrolet Volt hybrid, which could be replaced in 2022 with a new gasoline-electric crossover model."
General Motors,2017-7,"Other GM cars that could land on the chopping block, the sources said, include Buick LaCrosse, Cadillac CT6, Cadillac XTS, Chevrolet Impala and Chevrolet Sonic."
General Motors,2017-7,"Even as President Donald Trump promotes job creation in the U.S. auto industry, Detroit-based GM may have to further slash production of sedans and build them at fewer U.S. plants, analysts said. They noted that consumer demand has been shifting rapidly to SUVs and trucks, while GM has reduced sales to rental car fleets."
General Motors,2017-7,"GM must ""create some innovative new products"" to replace slow-selling sedans ""or start closing plants,"" said Sam Fiorani, vice president of AutoForecast Solutions."
General Motors,2017-7,"The automaker this year overestimated demand for family and luxury sedans, then produced too many. It had bloated inventories of unsold vehicles at the end of June, as much as six months of supply in some cases. Two months is considered normal."
General Motors,2017-7,"With the overall U.S. auto market expected to decline this year to less than 17 million units, analysts said GM may have too many passenger car nameplates and too many underused assembly plants."
General Motors,2017-7,"""There could be some consolidation"" of passenger car production in fewer U.S. plants, said Jeff Schuster, senior vice president of LMC Automotive. ""GM doesn't need all the sedans it has today. They should look at reducing the number of sedan offerings and replacing some with SUVs or crossovers."""

General Motors,2017-7,"Despite heavy discounting by some dealers, sales of GM passenger cars plunged 17 percent in the first half and 36 percent in June, far exceeding the industry-wide declines of 12 percent in the first half and 14 percent in June, according to Automotive News."
General Motors,2017-7,"Batey said GM intends to reduce overall inventories to around 75 days by year-end. On July 1, GM car inventories shot to 126 days from 95 days on June 1, according to Automotive News."

General Motors,2017-7,"Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 15,000 to a seasonally adjusted 233,000 for the week ended July 15, the Labor Department said on Thursday. That was the lowest level since February, when claims fell to 227,000, which was the best reading since March 1973."
General Motors,2017-7,"Data for the prior week was revised to show 1,000 more applications received than previously reported. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims falling to 245,000."
General Motors,2017-7,"It was the 124th straight week that claims remained below 300,000, a threshold associated with a robust labor market. That is the longest such stretch since 1970, when the labor market was smaller. The labor market is near full employment, with the jobless rate at 4.4 percent."
General Motors,2017-7,Claims are volatile early in the summer when automakers shut assembly plants for annual retooling. A Labor Department official said there were no special factors influencing the claims data and that no states had been estimated.
General Motors,2017-7,"The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 2,250 to 243,750 last week."
General Motors,2017-7,"Last week's claims data covered the survey period for July's nonfarm payrolls. The four-week average of claims fell 1,250 between the June and July survey periods, suggesting strong job gains in July."
General Motors,2017-7,"The economy created 222,000 jobs last month, the second biggest payrolls increase this year."
General Motors,2017-7,"Economists believe that labor market strength likely keeps the Federal Reserve on track to raise interest rates for a third time this year and announce a plan to start reducing its $4.2 trillion portfolio of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, despite a recent ebb in inflation pressures."

General Motors,2017-7,"NANJING, China, July 20 (Reuters) - While Western drivers like the 'new car' smell fresh off the production line, Chinese would rather their cars didn't smell of anything - a cultural divide that's testing car makers seeking an edge to revive sales in the world's biggest auto market."
General Motors,2017-7,"At Ford Motor Co , for example, 18 smell assessors - dubbed ""golden noses"" - at its research plant outside the eastern city of Nanjing test the smell of each material that goes inside a Ford car to be sold in China and around Asia."
General Motors,2017-7,"The China smell test isn't unique, but illustrates the lengths automakers go to to attract buyers in markets where consumer attitudes vary widely."
General Motors,2017-7,"""In North America, people want a new car smell and will even buy a 'new car' spray to make older cars feel new and fresh. In China it's the opposite,"" says Andy Pan, supervisor for material engineering at the Ford facility, which employs around 2,300 people."
General Motors,2017-7,"The smell of a new car in China can have an outsized effect. A J.D. Power report last year showed that unpleasant car smells were the top concern for Chinese drivers, ahead of engine issues, road noise or fuel consumption."
General Motors,2017-7,"The smell assessors at Ford, whose China sales are down 7 percent this year, [nL3N1JX1R8] [nL4N1K22BG] carry out 300 tests a year, a third more than their counterparts in Europe. They rate the odour of all materials used in a car from ""not perceptible"" to ""extremely disturbing""."
General Motors,2017-7,"Pungent materials - from carpets to seat covers and steering wheels - are noted as smelling of anything from ""burnt tire"" and ""bad meat"" to ""moth balls"" or ""dirty socks"". Some are sent back to the supplier."
General Motors,2017-7,"Seats for Ford cars in China are stored in perforated cloth bags to keep them ventilated before being installed, as opposed to plastic wrapping in the U.S. market where consumers are less concerned about chemical smells."
General Motors,2017-7,"""The smell inside the car can often be pretty pungent,"" said Tom Lin, a 24-year-old high-school teacher in Zhejiang province, who bought a local Roewe brand car last October. He said there was still a bit of an odour six months later."
General Motors,2017-7,"""With the next car I buy, I'm going to take more care to check out any odd smells,"" he said."
General Motors,2017-7,"To be sure, smell is just one factor for automakers to get right in China, where picky buyers are always looking for fresh car models and Beijing is making a big drive towards new energy vehicles. [nL8N1K44FT]"
General Motors,2017-7,"In a slower market - consultancy IHS forecasts vehicle sales will slip slightly this year - firms are looking for an extra edge to appeal to consumers, beyond price discounts, says IHS analyst James Chao."
General Motors,2017-7,"Local rivals Geely Automobile <0175.HK> and BYD Co Ltd <002594.SZ> tout their in-car air filters to protect drivers from China's harmful air pollution, and BMW says it is adding larger touch screens and tweaking colours to appeal to Chinese buyers."
General Motors,2017-7,"Smell is key though, reflecting a wider concern in China about chemicals and pollution."
General Motors,2017-7,"""When I lived in the United States I might look at the suspension or the engine,"" said Don Yu, China general manager at CGT, which makes materials to cover car seats and dashboards for General Motors , Volkswagen and Ford."
General Motors,2017-7,"""In China, though, people open the car and sit inside, if the smell isn't good enough they think it will jeopardize their health."""

General Motors,2017-7,"WASHINGTON, July 19 (Reuters) - A U.S. House panel on Wednesday approved a sweeping proposal by voice vote to allow automakers to deploy up to 100,000 self-driving vehicles without meeting existing auto safety standards and bar states from imposing driverless car rules."
General Motors,2017-7,"Representative Robert Latta, a Republican who heads the Energy and Commerce Committee subcommittee overseeing consumer protection, said he would continue to consider changes before the full committee votes on the measure, expected next week. The full U.S. House of Representatives will not take up the bill until it reconvenes in September after the summer recess."
General Motors,2017-7,"The measure, which would be the first significant federal legislation aimed at speeding self-driving cars to market, would require automakers to submit safety assessment reports to U.S. regulators, but would not require pre-market approval of advanced vehicle technologies."

General Motors,2017-7,"Representative Debbie Dingell, a Democrat from Michigan, said the bill creates a ""strong but flexible regulatory framework"" that seeks to avoid ""a patchwork"" of different state rules."
General Motors,2017-7,Auto dealers want the final bill to clarify that the measure would not preempt state dealer franchise laws that generally bar automakers from selling vehicles directly to consumers.
General Motors,2017-7,"Democrats praised the bipartisan proposal but said they want more changes before the full committee takes it up, including potentially adding other auto safety measures."

General Motors,2017-7,"NEW YORK, July 19 (Reuters) - A federal jury in New York on Wednesday found General Motors was not to blame for a crash of an Arizona man who alleged that his accident was caused by an updated version of the carmaker's ignition switch that did not adequately fix the flaws of a previous model."
General Motors,2017-7,"An earlier version of the switch had been linked to nearly 400 injuries and deaths, but GM settled the last case involving that switch in September last year. The company so far has paid roughly $2.5 billion in criminal and civil penalties, settlements and legal fees in connection with that switch."
General Motors,2017-7,"The plaintiff, Dennis Ward, said in this lawsuit that an updated model of that defective switch was to blame for the 2014 accident in which he hurt his knee. He alleged the switch suddenly rotated out of place, cutting off his car's power and leaving him unable to steer and brake the vehicle."
General Motors,2017-7,"There are some 230 individual cases pending with the Manhattan court over the new switch model, six of which have been selected as test trials."
General Motors,2017-7,"""In this case, the jury carefully considered the evidence and found that the ignition switch in this car was not defective and played no role in the accident,"" GM said in a statement after the verdict."
General Motors,2017-7,"Ward's car had been outfitted with the so-called ""190 switch,"" an updated version of the previous ""423 switch"" model."
General Motors,2017-7,"GM conceded the 423 switch was defective, leading to the 2014 recall of 2.6 million vehicles. But the company insisted that the flaws were solved in the updated model, which was equipped with a stronger spring to improve resistance."
General Motors,2017-7,"During the trial, the carmaker's defense lawyers had said the accident was Ward's own fault for not paying attention to traffic conditions and the road ahead."

General Motors,2017-7,"July 19 (Reuters) - General Motors Co and Japan's Softbank Group Corp <9984.T> are among the latest investors in Nauto, a Silicon Valley startup developing software for self-driving vehicles."
General Motors,2017-7,"Nauto, based in Palo Alto, said on Tuesday it closed a $159 million Series B funding round, led by Softbank and venture capital firm Greylock Partners. Previous investors included German automaker BMW AG and Japanese automaker Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T>, as well as German insurance firm Allianz ."
General Motors,2017-7,"Nauto is unusual in attracting money from big-name automakers, and also in its focus on software and data, which cost less to develop than hardware or entire vehicles."
General Motors,2017-7,"""Any (vehicle) manufacturer is better than any startup at building cars,"" said Stefan Heck, founder and chief executive officer of two-year-old Nauto. ""Our aim is to provide the data, intelligence and a cloud platform"" to automakers that plan to begin putting self-driving cars on the road from 2020."
General Motors,2017-7,The amount of GM's investment in Nauto was not disclosed. The Detroit automaker bought Silicon Valley startup Cruise Automation in early 2016 for more than $500 million.
General Motors,2017-7,"Heck declined to specify the company's post-funding valuation. He did say it was shy of $1 billion, ""unicorn"" status in Silicon Valley shorthand."
General Motors,2017-7,"To develop its technology, Nauto is retrofitting windshields of commercial trucks from North America to Europe and Japan with dual cameras: one aimed at the road and the other at the driver. The goal is to gather data on driver distraction and on the environment around vehicles and speed development of self-driving technology."
General Motors,2017-7,"Using such techniques as computer vision and deep learning, a form of artificial intelligence, the company is analyzing video feeds and data from the retrofit devices to improve driver performance and safety. Learning more about how humans drivers behave is critical, Heck said, because self-driving cars must share the roads with those vehicles for at least the next 20 to 30 years."
General Motors,2017-7,"""During that transition period, we need autonomous vehicles that are not just smart, but are able to collaborate with humans,"" Heck said in an interview."
General Motors,2017-7,"Nauto is working with investors and other companies ""to learn from human drivers, the best and the worst, to inform"" the development of self-driving vehicles."
General Motors,2017-7,"Heck declined to say how many vehicles are using Nauto's cameras and software, but said the company expects to accumulate more than one billion miles of real-world data within the next year."

General Motors,2017-7,"WILMINGTON, Del./NEW YORK, July 17 (Reuters) - The global recall of Takata Corp's <7312.T> defective air bags widened last week and the number of confirmed deaths rose, but legal experts said the bigger worry for car companies caught in the fallout is playing out in a Delaware bankruptcy courtroom."
General Motors,2017-7,"Earlier this month, people injured by the air bags, which degrade over time and can inflate with excessive force, were appointed to their own official committee in the Japanese company's U.S. bankruptcy, giving them a powerful voice in the proceedings."
General Motors,2017-7,"This unusual committee, which includes people whose cars lost value due to the recall, will be pitted against Honda Motor Co <7267.T>, Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T>, and other automakers."
General Motors,2017-7,"The car companies have been trying to use the bankruptcy to limit their liability for installing the faulty air bags, said Kevin Dean, a Motley Rice attorney who represents injured drivers on the committee."
General Motors,2017-7,"Because the committee has official status, Takata must provide it with funds which can be used to investigate the automakers' liability or to challenge financial assumptions. Without a committee, plaintiffs' lawyers would typically have to pay for that themselves."

General Motors,2017-7,"Takata, Honda, Toyota and General Motors Co declined to comment. Other carmakers did not return requests for comment."
General Motors,2017-7,"Bankruptcies typically only have one official creditors committee.

General Motors,2017-7,"{{20170715T135632.082+0000}}Germany eyes effective emission control from diesel carsFRANKFURT, July 15 (Reuters) - Germany is considering ""effective measures"" to cut pollution from diesel engines, the transport ministry said on Saturday, reacting to a media report saying planned goals were unambitious."
General Motors,2017-7,"German magazine Der Spiegel reported that, after pressure from the auto industry, Berlin was planning to allow car makers to shut off emission control technology once outside temperatures fall below 10 degrees. Germany's annual average temperature was 9.4 degrees in 2016."
General Motors,2017-7,"The transport ministry said in an emailed statement that no decisions had been taken though discussions were continuing.""The reporting by Spiegel is wrong,"" it added."
General Motors,2017-7,Germany is working on a national plan to cut pollution from diesel engines and set up a new organisation to test vehicles to try to restore consumer confidence after Volkswagen's emissions scandal.
General Motors,2017-7,The moves come as the German government faces growing pressure ahead of national elections on Sept. 24 to reduce emissions or see some cities ban diesel cars themselves.
General Motors,2017-7,"Last month, the transport ministry and the environment ministry announced the creation of a ""national diesel forum"" to work with the auto industry and regional governments to cut emissions, with the first meeting set for Aug. 2."
General Motors,2017-7,The German auto industry hopes a plan under discussion with the government to reduce pollution from older diesel cars will avert planned bans in German cities that are deterring consumers from buying diesel cars. [nL8N1JO12V][nL8N1JV24R]
General Motors,2017-7,"Government sources have told Reuters that software updates to reduce emissions could cost 1.5 billion to 2.5 billion euros, but HSBC analysts said hardware might be needed that could mean costs of up to 10 billion euros."
General Motors,2017-7,"Sales of diesel cars have been falling since the Volkswagen scandal, but have dropped even faster since cities, including Stuttgart and Munich, have considered banning some diesel vehicles, blaming emissions for increased respiratory disease.[nL8N1JB2J8]"
General Motors,2017-7,"European governments had in the past promoted diesel cars as part of efforts to fight climate change as they produce less carbon dioxide than petrol cars, although environmental groups have cast doubt over how much less they produce and have focused instead on the levels of toxic nitrogen oxides they emit."

General Motors,2017-7,"{{20170714T182206.808+0000}}Behind the scenes, companies fight Trump on US steel tariffsBy Ginger Gibson"
General Motors,2017-7,"WASHINGTON, July 14 (Reuters) - American manufacturers, energy companies and retailers reliant on cheap steel are quietly lobbying against President Donald Trump's desire to impose tariffs on steel imports ahead of possible decision by the U.S. Commerce Department next week."
General Motors,2017-7,"Honoring a promise made in the 2016 election campaign, in April this year Trump initiated a ""Section 232"" review of the steel industry, a provision in the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 allowing for the imposition of tariffs or quotas on imports if they threaten national security. The provision has only been used to review imports twice before."
General Motors,2017-7,"The Commerce Department could issue findings on the matter as early as next week, a decision that three lobbyists say has been delayed due to debate inside the administration."
General Motors,2017-7,"Steel producers in the U.S., like U.S. Steel Corp and AK Steel stand to benefit from protectionist tariffs which would enable them to raise their prices."
General Motors,2017-7,"But U.S. manufacturers and energy companies who use steel want to keep their costs down and say tariffs could costs jobs in their industries, while retailers need cheap steel for many facets of their business including shelving in their stores and warehouses, and to sell to consumers."
General Motors,2017-7,Any U.S. tariffs may also result in damage to unrelated industries if other countries retaliate by also imposing tariffs on American exports in sectors such as agriculture.
General Motors,2017-7,"""Our member companies have quietly had these conversations with both members of the administration but also with the Hill,"" said Hun Quach, the vice president for international trade at the Retail Industry Leaders Association."
General Motors,2017-7,"Those in favor of approving new tariffs include not only steel manufacturers, but some aligned unions. They have allies in Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, a former U.S. Steel lawyer who has promised to recuse himself from decisions regarding the industry."
General Motors,2017-7,"Mario Longhi, who until a few weeks ago was chief executive of U.S. Steel, said earlier this year that curbing cheap steel imports could restore jobs for 10,000 American steel workers."
General Motors,2017-7,"The U.S. steel industry employed about 147,000 people in 2015, according to the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic analysis."
General Motors,2017-7,"But manufacturers that need steel employ about 6.5 million people each year, and the construction industry supports another 6.3 million jobs."
General Motors,2017-7,"Manufacturers argue that pushing up the cost of steel by imposing tariffs on imports ultimately hurts American consumers who will pay more for everyday goods made from steel, such as lawn mowers, washing machines, and microwaves."
General Motors,2017-7,"When former President George W. Bush imposed steel tariffs in 2002, the move was found illegal by the World Trade Organization which permitted other countries to retaliate against American exports and Bush was forced to back down."
General Motors,2017-7,"Studies by the free trade lobby group, the Consuming Industries Trade Action Coalition (CITAC), found that 200,000 workers in U.S. manufacturing lost their jobs as a result of the 2002 steel tariffs."
General Motors,2017-7,"Pushing back against something that was a signature piece of Trump's campaign carries some political risk though and most companies would only elaborate on their lobbying efforts anonymously, saying they were making their case to Trump and lawmakers behind closed doors."
General Motors,2017-7,"They see allies in Gary Cohn, the head of the National Economic Council and Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue."
General Motors,2017-7,"""We've been quite vocal both on the Hill and in the administration,"" said a lobbyist for a large manufacturing company that uses both U.S. steel and imported steel, but who declined to speak on the record over concerns public statements could damage relationships with the White House."
General Motors,2017-7,"Several companies have also been pressing members of Congress to advocate against tariffs with the administration on their behalf, said several lobbyists."
General Motors,2017-7,"Several companies, including National Oilwell Varco Inc. , Ball Corporation , and Electrolux , submitted public comments to the Commerce Department arguing against tariffs."
General Motors,2017-7,"The American Petroleum Industry, which represents the largest oil refiners and chemical companies including ExxonMobil , Shell Oil Company , Chevron and Dow Chemical Company , issued forceful comments against the proposed tariffs, as did the American Automotive Policy Council, which includes Ford Motor Co. and General Motors ."
General Motors,2017-7,"""The auto industry and the U.S. workers that the industry employs would be adversely affected and that this unintended negative impact would exceed the benefit provided to the steel industry,"" the American Automotive Policy Council said in a message echoed in other comments."

General Motors,2017-7,"The new Accord, like rival Toyota Motor Corp's <7203.T> all-new Camry launching this month, offers more horsepower, safety technology like standard collision-avoiding braking, styling that pays homage to German sports sedans, and better fuel economy although Honda did not release figures."
General Motors,2017-7,"In a nod to driving enthusiasts, Honda will offer manual transmission as an option in two versions of the 2018 Accord, instead of only automatic shift in most midsize cars. Certain new Accords will be available with a new 10-speed auto shift, which Honda called a first for a front-wheel drive car."
General Motors,2017-7,"The new Accord's infotainment system can be upgraded over a Wi-Fi network, although functions such as braking or engine performance will not be upgradable over the air, Honda said."
General Motors,2017-7,"The Accord and Camry are pillars of their manufacturers' U.S. businesses, each selling well over 300,000 vehicles a year. In the coming months, Nissan Motor Co Ltd <7201.T> is expected to launch a new Altima midsize sedan, and Hyundai Motor Co <005380.KS will launch a new Sonata midsize car. All are popular marques that will be promoted heavily."

General Motors,2017-7,"NEW YORK, July 14 (Reuters) - Growth fund managers who have long held shares in Tesla Inc said they were still confident in the electric car maker even after production problems sent the stock diving more than 15 percent from its all-time high."
General Motors,2017-7,"Fund managers from Janus Henderson, Baron, and Tanaka said they still believed in Tesla, whose pricey valuation and 51 percent gain for the year to date have made it a target of noted short-sellers such as Greenlight Capital's David Einhorn and Kynikos Associates' Jim Chanos."
General Motors,2017-7,"The stock tumbled from its record high of $386.99 after the company said July 3 that it had experienced production delays and delivered about 47,100 vehicles in the first half of the year, at the low end of its own forecasts. Tesla shares fell to $323.41 on Thursday."
General Motors,2017-7,"""This is not the first nor the last quarterly Tesla disappointment or miss,"" said David Chung, a portfolio manager at Denver-based Janus Henderson funds. ""I think longer-term investors like us recognize that we are still early in this sector and this is a truly special company and exceptional CEO."""
General Motors,2017-7,"Chung said the stock valuation remained reasonable based on his estimates of the company's 2020 fiscal year, in which its Model 3 sedan, now in production, will be fully ramped up."
General Motors,2017-7,"Chung said he expected the company would sometimes miss estimates sometimes, but Musk has earned the benefit of the doubt given the quality of existing models. The company is well on track to have a significant mass market presence within the next three years, Chung added."
General Motors,2017-7,"The first Model 3 rolled off Tesla's assembly line a few days ago, though the company has yet to announce when it will begin regular shipments of pre-ordered vehicles."
General Motors,2017-7,"Tesla investors have high hopes for the $35,000 sedan, the company's first foray into the mass market and a key indicator of whether its electric vehicles can become popular enough to displace established rivals like General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co ."
General Motors,2017-7,The company expects the Model 3 to help it deliver 6 times its annual volume and turn a profit.
General Motors,2017-7,"Yet the company has also been plagued by production delays that prompted it to miss previous forecasts, leading some analysts to cut their outlook."
General Motors,2017-7,"""We continue to be cautious relative to the potential for a slower than guided start to Model 3 assembly, and newly believe that the potential for Model3 pre-orders cancellations may increasingly become a point of investor concern,"" noted Ryan Brinkman, an analyst at JPMorgan, who has an underweight rating on the company and a $190 price target on its shares."
General Motors,2017-7,"Short sellers have targeted Tesla, which analysts expect to turn its first full-year profit in 2019. Approximately 17 percent of its shares are now being shorted, according to Thomson Reuters data, a level that has remained level throughout the year even as short sellers annual losses have topped $3.8 billion [L1N1I4170]."
General Motors,2017-7,"""In terms of conviction, they seem to be very strong because they are taking it on the chin and keep on going on,"" said Ihor Dusaniwsky, head of research at S3 Partners, a financial analytics firm in New York."
General Motors,2017-7,"Graham Tanaka, portfolio manager of the New York-based Tanaka Growth fund, said Tesla short sellers were not factoring in potential improvements and growth of the battery division. The company began production of Model 3 batteries at its Gigafactory in Nevada in January, which should reduce costs and improve the lifespan of batteries with greater scale of production, Tanaka said."
General Motors,2017-7,"""They're going to be making better batteries at a cheaper price than any of the competition,"" he said."

General Motors,2017-7,"NEW YORK, July 14 (Reuters) - Growth fund managers who have long held shares in Tesla Inc said they were still confident in the electric car maker even after production problems sent the stock diving more than 15 percent from its all-time high."
General Motors,2017-7,"Fund managers from Janus Henderson, Baron, and Tanaka said they still believed in Tesla, whose pricey valuation and 51 percent gain for the year to date have made it a target of noted short-sellers such as Greenlight Capital's David Einhorn and Kynikos Associates' Jim Chanos."
General Motors,2017-7,"The stock tumbled from its record high of $386.99 after the company said July 3 that it had experienced production delays and delivered about 47,100 vehicles in the first half of the year, at the low end of its own forecasts. Tesla shares fell to $323.41 on Thursday."
General Motors,2017-7,"""This is not the first nor the last quarterly Tesla disappointment or miss,"" said David Chung, a portfolio manager at Denver-based Janus Henderson funds. ""I think longer-term investors like us recognize that we are still early in this sector and this is a truly special company and exceptional CEO."""
General Motors,2017-7,"Chung said the stock valuation remained reasonable based on his estimates of the company's 2020 fiscal year, in which its Model 3 sedan, now in production, will be fully ramped up."
General Motors,2017-7,"Chung said he expected the company would sometimes miss estimates sometimes, but Musk has earned the benefit of the doubt given the quality of existing models. The company is well on track to have a significant mass market presence within the next three years, Chung added."
General Motors,2017-7,"The first Model 3 rolled off Tesla's assembly line a few days ago, though the company has yet to announce when it will begin regular shipments of pre-ordered vehicles."
General Motors,2017-7,"Tesla investors have high hopes for the $35,000 sedan, the company's first foray into the mass market and a key indicator of whether its electric vehicles can become popular enough to displace established rivals like General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co ."
General Motors,2017-7,The company expects the Model 3 to help it deliver 6 times its annual volume and turn a profit.
General Motors,2017-7,"Yet the company has also been plagued by production delays that prompted it to miss previous forecasts, leading some analysts to cut their outlook."
General Motors,2017-7,"""We continue to be cautious relative to the potential for a slower than guided start to Model 3 assembly, and newly believe that the potential for Model3 pre-orders cancellations may increasingly become a point of investor concern,"" noted Ryan Brinkman, an analyst at JPMorgan, who has an underweight rating on the company and a $190 price target on its shares."
General Motors,2017-7,"Short sellers have targeted Tesla, which analysts expect to turn its first full-year profit in 2019. Approximately 17 percent of its shares are now being shorted, according to Thomson Reuters data, a level that has remained level throughout the year even as short sellers annual losses have topped $3.8 billion [L1N1I4170]."
General Motors,2017-7,"""In terms of conviction, they seem to be very strong because they are taking it on the chin and keep on going on,"" said Ihor Dusaniwsky, head of research at S3 Partners, a financial analytics firm in New York."
General Motors,2017-7,"Graham Tanaka, portfolio manager of the New York-based Tanaka Growth fund, said Tesla short sellers were not factoring in potential improvements and growth of the battery division. The company began production of Model 3 batteries at its Gigafactory in Nevada in January, which should reduce costs and improve the lifespan of batteries with greater scale of production, Tanaka said."
General Motors,2017-7,"""They're going to be making better batteries at a cheaper price than any of the competition,"" he said."

General Motors,2017-7,"DETROIT, July 13 (Reuters) - Honda Motor Co Ltd <7267.T> on Friday will unveil its newest-generation Accord, one of four re-engineered midsize sedans that Asian automakers are betting on to win market share as Detroit automakers shift focus to SUVs, crossovers and pickup trucks."
General Motors,2017-7,"The new Accord, like rival Toyota Motor Corp's <7203.T> all-new Camry launching this month, is expected to offer major improvements in fuel economy, technology, styling and safety, according to Honda's U.S. dealers."
General Motors,2017-7,Honda declined to discuss details ahead of Friday's event in Detroit.
General Motors,2017-7,"The Accord and Camry are pillars of their manufacturers' U.S. businesses, each selling well over 300,000 vehicles a year. In the coming months, Nissan Motor Co Ltd <7201.T> is expected to launch a new Altima midsize sedan, and Hyundai Motor Co <005380.KS will launch a new Sonata midsize car. Both are popular marques that will be promoted heavily."
General Motors,2017-7,"""There has been no new news on the midsize sedan side for three years and we think this is a great opportunity to bring attention back to the segment,"" said Jack Hollis, Toyota's head of marketing for North America. [nL4N1K13D4]"
General Motors,2017-7,"Year to date, U.S. passenger car sales are down 11.4 percent and sales of midsize sedans are down 14.2 percent. Still, Americans bought 7.1 million sedans in 2016. With General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co cutting sedan production, and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV abandoning the segment, Honda and its Asian rivals could boost sales with updated models, dealers said."
General Motors,2017-7,"""They could take share from other brands, which is traditionally what happens when a new product is launched,"" said Pete DeLongchamps, vice president for manufacturer relations at Group 1 Automotive Inc , the third-largest U.S. auto dealer group."
General Motors,2017-7,"The Accord for years was Honda's top-selling model in the United States. Within the past year, U.S. sales of the Honda CR-V compact utility vehicle have eclipsed the aging Accord as Honda has expanded production capacity for the former. [nL1N1CI1GM]"
General Motors,2017-7,"The new Accord and Camry ""may stem the decline,"" said IHS Markit's Tom Libby. ""I don't think they will cause a marked reverse."""
General Motors,2017-7,"Improvements to the Accord should boost sales at Galpin Honda in San Fernando, California, general manager Ed Hartoonian said. The dealership sells about 500 Accords and Civics, combined, per month and Accord sales are up nearly 13 percent so far this year, he said."

General Motors,2017-7,"WASHINGTON, July 13 (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Communications Commission on Thursday approved allocating a larger consolidated block of spectrum for use by motor vehicle and aircraft radar systems to help avoid crashes."
General Motors,2017-7,The FCC first approved 1 GHz of spectrum in 1995 for motor vehicles to use radar that allowed for the introduction of collision avoidance and adaptive cruise control systems that are credited with preventing tens of thousands of crashes annually.
General Motors,2017-7,"Thursday's decision expands the band that vehicle radars can operate to 5 GHz of spectrum and will improve lane departure warning, blind spot detection systems, automatic braking and pedestrian detection, the FCC said."
General Motors,2017-7,"In 2016, some 20 automakers reached a voluntary agreement with U.S. auto safety regulators to make collision-avoiding braking systems standard equipment by 2022, a move that could eliminate 1 million crashes a year."
General Motors,2017-7,"FCC Chairman Ajit Pai said the agency was giving automakers ""the bandwidth needed"" to allow ""proven technologies that enable services like collision avoidance, blind spot monitoring, and lane change assistance"" and allow for ""new innovations."""
General Motors,2017-7,"Automakers will exit some other smaller portions of spectrum used for some radar systems as part of the expansion after 2022, the FCC said."
General Motors,2017-7,"The vote harmonizes vehicle spectrum with European rules that could allow automakers to bring technologies to the U.S. market faster, the FCC said."
General Motors,2017-7,The decision will also lead to improved aviation safety by boosting foreign object debris detection radars on airport runways and aircraft wingtip radars that can help avoid collisions with objects while moving on airport grounds.
General Motors,2017-7,"The move was prompted by a petition filed by German auto supplier Robert Bosch GmbH [ROBG.UL] in 2012. Continental AG said the expanded spectrum will allow for ""better range separation, range accuracy, angular accuracy, and reliable object discrimination."""
General Motors,2017-7,"FCC Commissioner Michael O'Rielly voted for the change but noted automakers were granted another block of spectrum in 1999 for vehicle-to-vehicle communications, but it has gone largely unused."
General Motors,2017-7,"In December, the U.S. Transportation Department proposed requiring future new cars and trucks to be able to ""talk"" to one another, but it has not been finalized."
General Motors,2017-7,Automakers are pursuing technologies to assist drivers in avoiding crashes while working on fully self-driving cars.
General Motors,2017-7,"U.S. traffic deaths jumped 8 percent in the first nine months of 2016, following a spike in 2015 when road deaths had their highest full-year increase since 1966. In 2015, total U.S. traffic crashes rose by 4 percent to 6.3 million."

General Motors,2017-7,"CARACAS, July 12 (Reuters) - Venezuela's government has seized assets from dozens of foreign corporations in nationalizations by the late President Hugo Chavez and the embattled current government of Nicolas Maduro."
General Motors,2017-7,"The man behind the confiscation of General Motors Co's $100 million assembly plant in April is a much more obscure figure: Kaled Kansao, the owner of two long-defunct GM dealerships."

General Motors,2017-7,"SAN FRANCISCO, July 11 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc said it is expanding its auto service centers and adding 350 mobile service vans as it gears up to support its Model 3 sedan, a mass-market car that is expected to drive a 500 percent increase in the electric car company's sales."
General Motors,2017-7,"A senior executive speaking on behalf of the company told Reuters that Tesla would be able to triple its global service capacity by increasing efficiency, adding to mobile service, and adding 100 service centers to its current total of more than 150."
General Motors,2017-7,"Tesla is adding 1,400 technicians this year, and the company plans to continue expanding mobile and service center capacity at a similar pace over then next few years."
General Motors,2017-7,Tesla needs to expand service quickly to be able to handle the increase in sales and as the electric car company transforms itself from a luxury vehicle maker into a competitor with mainstream cars.
General Motors,2017-7,"Expectations for a smooth roll out are particularly high among investors. Tesla has been challenging General Motors for the title of biggest U.S. automaker by market capitalization, even though its output is a fraction of GM's."

General Motors,2017-7,"Tesla's last launch was the Model X SUV in 2015, which had a number of production issues."
General Motors,2017-7,"Model 3 production began in the last few days and is expected to reach 20,000 per month in December. The first deliveries are expected on July 28."
General Motors,2017-7,"Tesla had fielded 373,000 Model 3 reservations as of April 2016, the latest date at which it announced a figure."

General Motors,2017-7,"ZOETERMEER, Netherlands, July 10 (Reuters) - Dutch prosecutors said on Monday they will investigate possible misuse of vehicle emissions software by Suzuki <7269.T> and Fiat Chrysler's Jeep."
General Motors,2017-7,They were responding after the Dutch road authority (RDW) found that the Jeep Grand Cherokee and Suzuki Vitara models produced unacceptably high levels of toxic emissions during road tests.
General Motors,2017-7,"The RDW said that there are approximately 27,000 of the Jeeps and 42,000 of the Suzukis on European roads."
General Motors,2017-7,The RDW said in a statement that its tests of more than a dozen car makers in the wake of the Volkswagen emissions scandal had singled out Jeep and Suzuki. Other manufacturers were not found to have violated regulations.
General Motors,2017-7,"The Dutch agency has been investigating what it called ""impermissible defeat devices"" for the past year, following the disclosure in the United States in 2015 that Volkswagen had used software to alter its emissions during testing."
General Motors,2017-7,The RDW's investigation was centered on nitrogen oxide emission levels in diesel cars that appeared much higher than legally allowed during road driving rather than under laboratory test conditions.
General Motors,2017-7,The agency said that in all cases carmakers argued that the reason for the discrepancy was software intended to protect the motor from harm under certain conditions.
General Motors,2017-7,"Such software is permissible under current European law and the agency no longer refers to it as a ""defeat device"" but uses the term ""impermissible software"" for when the pollution seems out of proportion with any need to protect the engine."
General Motors,2017-7,"""For the 14 other carmakers we were able to get to the core of the matter and ask all the questions that we wanted and got satisfactory answers,"" said Maarten Balk, Manager for Licensing and Supervision at the RDW."
General Motors,2017-7,Suzuki representatives in Europe could not immediately be reached for comment. Jeep representatives did not immediately respond to an email request for comment.
General Motors,2017-7,"The RDW said Suzuki Vitaras appeared to emit much more nitrogen oxide after a short time on the road. The company has offered a fix and is currently rolling it out for the roughly 8,000 Vitara models on Dutch roads."
General Motors,2017-7,"The Jeep Grand Cherokee appeared to emit higher levels of pollutants when its engine was hot, the RDW said. There are very few of them in the Netherlands, and the model is no longer in production."
General Motors,2017-7,"Jeep has proposed a software fix for the Cherokees this month, but the RDW hasn't had a chance to evaluate it yet."
General Motors,2017-7,RDW Director Paul Dietz said that this is the first time his agency has taken such an action.
General Motors,2017-7,"He said the agency has no power to levy fines, that will be up to prosecutors. The RDW will continue to pressure the two firms to offer remedies and follow up to make sure the offending models are retrofitted."

General Motors,2017-7,"CARLETON, Mich., July 7 (Reuters) - Two lanes apart at a noisy, fast-paced auto auction near Detroit, two vehicles show why major U.S. automakers have a problem with used cars."
General Motors,2017-7,"In one lane of the Manheim auction facility, a black 2015 Chevy Malibu sedan with barely 20,000 miles on it sold for just over $13,000, less than half its original sticker price. In the other lane, a white 2013 Chevy Silverado pick-up truck sold for $11,500 - despite having 200,000 miles on the odometer."
General Motors,2017-7,"America's renewed lust for new SUVs and trucks instead of smaller cars is already hurting major auto companies, which posted their fourth consecutive month of declining new vehicle sales.[nL1N1JU104]"
General Motors,2017-7,"But millions cars that were leased two or three years ago, many of them used compact and midsized cars with low mileage, are heading toward auction lots and used car dealerships."
General Motors,2017-7,"That surge in supply threatens to depress prices for new and used vehicles, raising the risk of losses for automakers and finance companies on lease deals. It also undercuts the value of cars customers want to trade in for a new vehicle. [nL1N1I40JA]"
General Motors,2017-7,"So major carmakers, including General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co , are aligning with auto auction houses with aggressive moves to make sure they are getting the best prices for their vehicles. Such maneuvers include transporting the automobiles to where the greater demand is based on real-time pricing data, spending more to spruce up used cars and slowing the pace which leased cars get moved to used car lots or auction houses."
General Motors,2017-7,"Auto auction houses such as Manheim in southeastern Michigan are where the romance of new car marketing goes to die. The dominant player in the U.S. auction market along with rival KAR Auction Services Inc , Manheim treats vehicles like commodities, grading them on a fine-tuned scale from one (poor) to five (excellent) that provides dealers with certainty and transparency."
General Motors,2017-7,"""If a dealer sees a 2015 Ford Fusion with a rating of 4.3, they know what to pay for it and what they can sell it for,"" said Matt Trapp, a Manheim vice president on a tour of the auction, scanning tags on vehicles with his smartphone to pull up a multitude of transactions for that make, model, year, condition and mileage."
General Motors,2017-7,"""If you don't want to overbid on this one, wait a minute and another will be right along,"" he said."
General Motors,2017-7,"Increasingly, the auction houses and automakers are collaborating to try to raise the scores, and the prices, of vehicles running through auctions. Auction houses have offered add-on reconditioning services on used vehicles for decades, but after the lean years following the Great Recession, demand is rising for those higher-margin services."
General Motors,2017-7,"Manheim's chief economist Jonathan Smoke says ""we can help determine the optimal way to sell their vehicle, which includes location, timing,"" the level of reconditioning and whether to opt for a physical auction or online auction. Online auctions account for 30 percent of sales at Manheim versus 10 percent three years ago, he added."
General Motors,2017-7,"Armed with detailed, real-time pricing data that was not available during the last downturn, auctioneers can now help automakers figure out where a used car could fetch the best price."
General Motors,2017-7,"Manheim has an expanded logistics arm that can aggregate cars for transport to the place they'll fetch the highest price at auction, or arrange their sale before they even move."
General Motors,2017-7,"Jason Ferreri, KAR's executive vice president of online services, said this is happening ""significantly more often."""
General Motors,2017-7,"Neither he nor Manheim officials would give specifics. In April, KAR agreed to buy DRIVIN, a data aggregator that matches vehicle inventory to dealer demand, whose founders include Brad Keywell and Eric Lefkofsky, the co-founders of Groupon Inc , for $43 million in stock. [nL1N1HR0D3]"
General Motors,2017-7,Ferreri said the deal was in response to automakers' demands for greater data services amid the influx of off-lease vehicles. This real-time pricing data helps the companies steer the used cars toward higher demand.
General Motors,2017-7,"For example, the national price for a 2015 Chevrolet Malibu with average mileage the week of June 11 was $15,514, according to data compiled for Reuters by car-shopping website CarGurus."
General Motors,2017-7,"In Memphis, that Malibu cost nearly 9 percent above the national average fair price, but in Miami it would sell for more than 9 percent below that price, representing a difference of $2,700."
General Motors,2017-7,"Manheim's Matt Trapp, whose territory includes the U.S. northeast, says around 40 percent of vehicles coming off leases are returned to dealers within around five hours' drive of New York City. Many are now being shipped to other regions."
General Motors,2017-7,"In New Jersey, for instance, one in three off-lease vehicles now leaves the state, Trapp says."
General Motors,2017-7,"""I am not seeing a glut of used cars hitting the market,"" said Mike Gentry, who buys cars for 20 dealerships in northwest Ohio and attended the Manheim auction outside Detroit. ""Automakers have set a floor for pricing and when they can't get that price they ship them 500 miles to where they can get a better price."""
General Motors,2017-7,"GM spokesman Jim Cain said the company is relying on ""a lot more tools"" including certified pre-owned vehicles ""to support resale values."" A Ford spokesman said the company has adopted a ""disciplined approach"" to maintaining used car values."
General Motors,2017-7,"Those tools include slowing the flow of vehicles to the used market, which they can afford in the short term as their balance sheets are strong."
General Motors,2017-7,"""With off-lease vehicles we are not seeing all of them coming to market, some of them are being held back,"" National Automobile Dealers Association chief economist Steven Szakaly told reporters on a conference call on Thursday."
General Motors,2017-7,"Automakers also allow their franchised dealers to take first pick of vehicles just coming off a lease before they go to auction. These are usually sold as ""certified pre-owned"" cars that come with a factory warranty, and a higher price tag than a run-of-the-mill used car."
General Motors,2017-7,"For vehicles that have suffered wear and tear, auction houses are now preparing for what Manheim's Mandy Savage calls a ""tsunami"" that will hit the market in the coming years."
General Motors,2017-7,"At Manheim's body shop here in Carleton, Savage, the facility's general manager, says 90 percent of the vehicles being painted or undergoing small fixes are cars that have just come off lease. Automakers are increasingly willing to spend $500 to boost a car's resale value by $750, she said."
General Motors,2017-7,"But Mark Wakefield, head of the North American automotive practice for consultancy AlixPartners, said propping up used car values makes sense, but automakers will have to do more to stem the flow of used cars longer-term by trimming inventory levels."

General Motors,2017-7,"SEOUL, July 6 (Reuters) - U.S. auto imports from the likes of General Motors and Ford Motor must become more chic, affordable or fuel-efficient to reap the rewards of President Donald Trump's attempts to renegotiate a trade deal with key ally South Korea, officials and industry experts in Seoul say."
General Motors,2017-7,"Meeting South Korean President Moon Jae-in last week in Washington, Trump said the United States would do more to address trade imbalances with South Korea and create a level playing ground for U.S. businesses, especially carmakers, in the world's 11th largest auto market by sales. [nL1N1JR0T2]"
General Motors,2017-7,"While imports from automakers including Ford, Chrysler and GM more than doubled last year largely thanks to free trade deal which took effect in 2012, sales account for just 1 percent of a market dominated by more affordable models from local giants Hyundai Motor Co <005380.KS> and affiliate Kia Motors Corp <000270.KS>."
General Motors,2017-7,"Imports make up just 15 percent of the overall Korean auto market, and are mainly more luxurious models from German automakers BMW and Daimler AG's Mercedes-Benz, which also benefit from a trade deal with the European Union."
General Motors,2017-7,"""Addressing non-tariff barriers would not fundamentally raise the competitiveness of U.S. cars,"" a senior Korean government official told Reuters, declining to be identified because of the sensitivity of the subject."
General Motors,2017-7,"""What we really want to say to the United States is: make good cars, make cars that Korean consumers like."""
General Motors,2017-7,"In Korea, U.S. imports are seen as lagging German brands in brand image, sophistication and fuel economy, industry experts say. U.S. imports do have a competitive advantage in electric cars: Tesla Motors' electric vehicles are seen as both environmentally friendly and trendy, while GM has launched a long-range Bolt EV."
General Motors,2017-7,U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross had cited a quota in the current trade deal as an obstacle to boosting imports.
General Motors,2017-7,"The quota allows U.S. automakers to bring in each year 25,000 vehicles that meet U.S., not necessarily Korean, safety standards. Should GM, for example, decide to bring in more than its quota of one model - the Impala sedans - it would cost up to $75 million to modify the cars to meet Korean safety standards, the company told its local labour union."
General Motors,2017-7,"Asked about non-tariff barriers, a spokesman at GM's Korean unit said removing them could expand the range of models the company can bring in from the United States."
General Motors,2017-7,"No U.S. company, however, has yet to make full use of the quota, industry data shows. GM, the most popular U.S. brand, sold only 13,150 U.S.-made vehicles last year."
General Motors,2017-7,"U.S. cars could also see the benefits of a renegotiated trade deal at a time when diesel-powered cars offered by Volkswagen's are losing appeal following cheating on emissions tests. However, they still need to appeal to the locals, experts say."
General Motors,2017-7,"""Upgrading their vehicles and meet the luxurious taste of consumers is more important than complaining about non-tariff barriers,"" said Kim Pil-soo, a professor of engineering at Daelim University College near Seoul."

General Motors,2017-7,"Tesla's Model S received the highest rating in IIHS's crash testing in every category except one, the small overlap front crash test, where it received the second highest rating available, a Tesla spokesperson said in an email."
General Motors,2017-7,"""IIHS and dozens of other private industry groups around the world have methods and motivations that suit their own subjective purposes,"" the spokesperson said."
General Motors,2017-7,"Tesla said the most objective and accurate independent vehicle safety test is done by the U.S. government, which found Model S and Model X to have the lowest probability of injury of any cars that it has ever tested."
General Motors,2017-7,"In order to get the top IIHS rating, automakers must have a frontal crash prevention system with automatic braking capabilities to prevent a rear-end collision."
General Motors,2017-7,"The vehicles must stop or slow down without driver intervention before hitting a target in tests at 12 or 25 miles per hour among other factors, IIHS said."
General Motors,2017-7,Toyota said in a statement it is committed to developing safe and reliable vehicles.
General Motors,2017-7,"General Motors Co declined to comment, while Ford and Mercedes were not immediately available for comment."
