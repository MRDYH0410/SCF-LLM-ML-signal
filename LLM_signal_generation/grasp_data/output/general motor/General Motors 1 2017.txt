General Motors,2017-1,"DETROIT, Feb 1 (Reuters) - Automakers on Wednesday are likely to report a 3 percent decline in U.S. auto sales for January after a surprisingly strong December stole some thunder from the start of the new year, industry analysts and economists said."
General Motors,2017-1,"Still, with December's good showing pulling sales from January, normally the weakest month of the year in terms of sales volume, some analysts cautioned against putting too much emphasis on the month's annualized selling rate."
General Motors,2017-1,The 11 analysts polled by Reuters in Detroit showed expectations of an annualized selling rate of 17.4 million vehicles. A wider poll of 40 economists by Thomson Reuters showed estimates of 17.55 million vehicles on the annualized basis.
General Motors,2017-1,"The overall U.S. auto market remained on a roll, with rising sales for the past seven years, and record highs for the past two, they said. Each month, auto sales are an early indicator of U.S. consumer spending."
General Motors,2017-1,"Last year ended surprisingly strong. December U.S. sales were 18.43 million on a seasonally adjusted annualized basis, far outpacing expectations of 17.7 million vehicles."
General Motors,2017-1,"A Reuters poll of industry analysts showed expectations that General Motors Co sales fell about 2 percent, and guesses ranged from down 9 percent to up 3 percent."
General Motors,2017-1,"At Ford Motor Co , analysts expected, on average, that January sales dropped 3 percent, with estimates ranging from down 7 percent to up 2 percent."
General Motors,2017-1,"Fiat Chrysler Automobiles sales were seen dropping 16 percent, and analysts forecast stretched from between 14 percent and 18 percent."

General Motors,2017-1,"FRANKFURT/LONDON, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Germany's auto industry is losing hope that trade tariffs with Britain can be avoided, several executives have told Reuters, despite warnings from British Prime Minister Theresa May that an overly tough stance on post-Brexit commerce would seriously harm the country's EU partners."
General Motors,2017-1,"""Merkel may force us to walk away from UK profits for the sake of preventing further EU fragmentation,"" said a senior executive at a German luxury carmaker."
General Motors,2017-1,"The executive, who asked not to be identified because of the subject's sensitivity, said Brexit looks increasingly likely to be ""a disaster"" for trade and for German manufacturers."
General Motors,2017-1,"BMW , along with the Germany-based European arms of GM and Ford , which all have UK plants, know trade barriers would bring large, currently incalculable costs."
General Motors,2017-1,"Under World Trade Organization (WTO) rules, British exports of complete vehicles could be subject to tariffs of up to 10 percent."
General Motors,2017-1,"Ford, Britain's biggest engine maker, warned of 2.7 percent duties on engines ahead of last June's Brexit referendum."
General Motors,2017-1,"Duties on components such as gear boxes and brakes shipped from Britain would likely vary around the 3.7 percent average currently levied by the EU on similar imports from third countries, according to the WTO, unless a preferential deal is struck."
General Motors,2017-1,May recently vowed to take Britain out of the EU single market that allows tariff-free trade in order to gain more control over immigration.
General Motors,2017-1,"At the same time May argued for the ""greatest possible"" market access. But German Chancellor Angela Merkel responded that London should not get an attractive Brexit deal that might encourage other departures. [nB4N1DJ017]"
General Motors,2017-1,"Much is at stake for carmakers in general, and the Germans in particular. About every other car built in Britain is destined for another EU market. German-owned brands claim more than one-third of UK car sales."
General Motors,2017-1,"Think tank Civitas estimates that if Britain leaves the EU without a trade deal, German automotive exporters would pay 1.8 billion pounds ($2.3 billion) in tariffs, nearly half the total 3.9 billion pounds faced by EU-based firms."
General Motors,2017-1,"UK-built vehicles and parts, on the other hand, would be hit by tariffs of around 1.3 billion pounds, according to the group."
General Motors,2017-1,"But German car bosses are unwilling to undermine Merkel's position. Merkel recently reiterated that EU governments would not negotiate Brexit terms until London had triggered the irreversible ""article 50"" leaving process, before adding pointedly that business leaders should show similar restraint."
General Motors,2017-1,"That sentiment was quickly echoed by Matthias Wissmann, head of Germany's influential auto industry lobby, the VDA."
General Motors,2017-1,"""Everything must be done to allow the unfettered flow of goods and services,"" he told reporters. ""But there is one clear priority: we must stand together among the 27 EU member states."""
General Motors,2017-1,"Wissmann's counterpart at Britain's SMMT car industry group also warned UK lawmakers that BMW, Daimler and VW may not push too hard for free trade."
General Motors,2017-1,"German carmakers see ""Europe as more important than the UK market"", SMMT chief Mike Hawes told a parliamentary committee in January. ""They will align with what is best for Germany."""
General Motors,2017-1,"BMW employs in the region of 8,000 workers in Britain, including at its plants which export roughly 2.4 billion pounds of vehicles and engines, most notably a large majority of the Mini and Rolls-Royce cars assembled there."
General Motors,2017-1,"Ford, which has warned against tariffs, builds engines in Dagenham and Bridgend for vehicles assembled in mainland Europe. GM builds Opel/Vauxhall Astras on Britain's west coast and expects Brexit to have wiped $400 million from 2016 earnings."
General Motors,2017-1,"""We are worried,"" said a director at the German unit of a major global carmaker. ""I don't expect there will be special deals for any industry."""
General Motors,2017-1,"Trade duties on components, which can cross the Channel several times before a vehicle is assembled, would require costly supply-chain upheaval to avoid a compounding of duties."
General Motors,2017-1,Raw castings from mainland Europe are machined into engine blocks at BMW's Hams Hall plant near Birmingham. Many are then shipped to Germany and fitted into cars destined for the UK.
General Motors,2017-1,"In all, UK car plants purchase 59 percent of their components overseas, and two-thirds of those from the EU, the SMMT says. Even where cross-Channel supply chains stayed viable, border formalities would hurt delivery timings, raising warehousing costs and ultimately consumer prices."
General Motors,2017-1,"Locally made components would become more attractive for British-built cars, but the UK assembly plants could find it harder to win new vehicle programmes in the first place."
General Motors,2017-1,"Investing in an assembly line for the British market alone - rather than export - becomes viable only above an annual output of about 150,000 vehicles, industry experts explain."
General Motors,2017-1,"For many models, Exane BNP analyst Dominic O'Brien said, ""the UK market is not necessarily big enough to sustain its own dedicated plant."" Again, consumer choice and prices suffer."
General Motors,2017-1,"Some German carmakers have been more vocal in urging Britain to give ground, stressing attachment to their EU workers' freedom of movement."
General Motors,2017-1,"""Not only free trade but also cross-border employment opportunities ... are of proven benefit to business,"" BMW said."
General Motors,2017-1,"Still, huge unknowns remain, including French and German elections this year that could change the direction of Brexit."
General Motors,2017-1,Already there are some signs of dissent within the governing coalition between Merkel's conservative CDU and its Social Democrat SPD junior partner.
General Motors,2017-1,"Brexit should be used to spur EU reform, not deter would-be leavers, SPD Economy Minister Sigmar Gabriel said last week."
General Motors,2017-1,"""We should not purely focus on Brexit as a threat,"" he said. ""Should we reach a good result in negotiations with the UK, it could serve as an example for a Europe of different speeds."" ($1 = 0.8011 pounds)"

General Motors,2017-1,Jan 27 (Reuters) - Ordering a bottle of Corona beer at a bar in the United States is a simple proposition.
General Motors,2017-1,"Getting it there from its brewery in Mexico involves a complex, cross-border supply network that will likely get more complicated if U.S. president Donald Trump follows through on vows to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) or tax imports."
General Motors,2017-1,"Trump has not outlined specific plans for revising NAFTA, but he has made repeated calls for a levy to discourage companies from moving jobs outside the United States. On Thursday, the White House floated a plan to impose a 20 percent tax on imports. Republican leaders in the U.S. House of Representatives have included a tax on imports in their blueprint for overhauling corporate taxes."
General Motors,2017-1,"The ideas have met opposition in Congress, even inside Trump's own party. U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham, a republican from South Carolina, took to Twitter on Thursday, saying ""Simply put, any policy proposal which drives up costs of Corona, tequila, or margaritas is a big-time bad idea. Mucho Sad."""
General Motors,2017-1,Trump's rhetoric has also heightened uncertainty over the billions in supply chain and infrastructure investment that a diverse array of companies from automakers and railroads to appliance makers and food producers have made on both side of the U.S.-Mexico border during the past two decades.
General Motors,2017-1,"The stakes are high for brands like Corona, which is entirely brewed in Mexico, and the transport companies such as Union Pacific Corp that make money moving the beer's raw ingredients and packaging into Mexico, and bringing the finished brew back to the United States."
General Motors,2017-1,"Victor, New York-based Constellation Brands Inc , which owns the U.S. rights to Corona, plans to spend $2.5 billion to expand an existing brewery in Nava, just south of the border with Texas and $2 billion on a new brewery in Mexicali by 2021."
General Motors,2017-1,"Just days before the November 8 U.S. election, the company said it would buy a Mexican brewery from Grupo Modelo for $600 million and expand its operations in the country."
General Motors,2017-1,"To qualify as a Mexican beer, Constellation's beer brands must be made in Mexico. However, about 40 percent of the cost of the company's Mexican beers are tied to ingredients, supplies and freight services that come from the United States, said David Klein, Constellation's chief financial officer during a conference call earlier this month."
General Motors,2017-1,"The company - which has seen its market valuation triple to nearly $30 billion since 2013 when it obtained rights to sell Corona and other Mexican beer brands - imports hops, barley and other grains from the United States to brew Corona. The company does not disclose the specific origin of ingredients."
General Motors,2017-1,"""The majority of our glass bottle supply comes from the glass plant at the Nava brewery and other Mexico suppliers. We source less than 20 percent of our glass bottles from the United States. Some raw materials, including hops and grains to brew the beer, do come from the United States,"" Constellation said in a statement."
General Motors,2017-1,"Farms in the Midwestern and Northwestern United States are major growers of barley in North America, and in 2015 Mexico was the world's largest importer of U.S. barley. Since 2010, Mexico has been either the world's largest importer of U.S. hops or second just behind the United Kingdom."
General Motors,2017-1,"Unraveling the NAFTA supply chains of companies such as Constellation, or the big automakers, would lead to higher prices for consumer goods, experts and industry executives say."
General Motors,2017-1,"""Everyone would lose, especially the consumer, it's that simple,"" said Brandon Stallard, CEO of Troy, Michigan-based TPS Logistics, which handles tens of thousands of cross-border shipments for customers daily."
General Motors,2017-1,"U.S. companies also benefit from Corona production. Perrysburg, Ohio-based glass maker Owens-Illinois formed a joint venture with Constellation to expand a glass bottle plant next to the Nava brewery and subsequently bought a major Mexican glass bottle producer to meet demand. Owens-Illinois declined to comment on where its raw materials come from."
General Motors,2017-1,"Broomfield, Colorado-based Ball Corp is building a plant in Monterrey to make cans for Constellation's new brewery."
General Motors,2017-1,"Constellation says it imports almost 20 percent of its glass bottles from the United States. The company did not say where those bottles come from, but Lance Fritz, chief executive of No. 1 U.S. railroad Union Pacific often cites the example of glass bottles the company hauls from a plant in Texas to a brewery in Mexico and that those bottles are made from recycled glass Union Pacific hauls from all over America."
General Motors,2017-1,"The railroad has also invested $40 million in cleaning, washing and repair facility for beer-carrying box-cars just north of Constellation's Nava brewery. Union Pacific hauls U.S. barley, malt and rice for brewing."
General Motors,2017-1,"""The job we have at hand is to help our elected officials see the world from our perspective and then pray for them to make the right decision,"" said Fritz."

General Motors,2017-1,"NEW ORLEANS, Jan 29 (Reuters) - U.S. auto dealers gathered for their annual convention in New Orleans said they want President Donald Trump to ease federal regulation of vehicle emissions and consumer lending, reversing action taken by his predecessor."
General Motors,2017-1,"Former President Barack Obama enacted rules requiring automakers to roughly double the average fuel efficiency of their U.S. car and truck fleets to 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025.

General Motors,2017-1,"""You inflate the price of the vehicle and a car that was maybe within reach of being affordable now may not be,"" Scarpelli said."
General Motors,2017-1,"He added that a ""different phase-in period"" for the rules could be a better option."
General Motors,2017-1,"U.S. auto dealers have a strong lobby in Washington, due largely to their engagement with and support for local congressmen. They are also aligned on the fuel emissions issue with U.S. automakers."

General Motors,2017-1,"The job cuts were somewhat surprising, given GM's investment of some C$800 million on upgrades to produce a new 2019 Equinox model, said Tony Faria, a University of Windsor professor who studies the industry."

General Motors,2017-1,"DETROIT, Jan 26 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co on Thursday reported a fourth-quarter loss, citing an accounting change to pensions and costs for abandoning a factory in Mexico, which President Donald Trump had attacked on the road the White House."
General Motors,2017-1,"Ford also reaffirmed its forecast that 2017 profits would be lower, which contrasted with more upbeat forecasts from Detroit rivals General Motors Co [nL1N1F018Q] and the U.S. operations of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV . [nL5N1FG3EG]"

General Motors,2017-1,Ford said overall it will save $500 million by consolidating small car production planned for the new assembly factory at an existing plant in Mexico. [nL1N1EW1XY]
General Motors,2017-1,"The company said the decision was driven by slack demand and weak pricing for small cars, but Ford executives said they were encouraged by Trump's promises of corporate tax cuts and regulatory relief. [nL1N1ET0V9]"
General Motors,2017-1,"Since last fall, Ford has cautioned that its 2017 profit will be pressured by investments in electrified vehicles, autonomous vehicles and big data systems that would power ride hailing and other services. This year will be the most expensive year in developing those emerging areas, Shanks said in an interview with Reuters."
General Motors,2017-1,"""We see this as being a one-year phenomenon in terms of the impact because of the timing of the investment, the degree of the investments that we're making in the new part of our business,"" he said."
General Motors,2017-1,"Shanks said Ford will not turn a profit on these businesses in aggregate until next decade, but they ultimately could yield profit margins higher than 20 percent."
General Motors,2017-1,"Ford's results and its downbeat outlook point to other challenges for the Dearborn, Michigan automaker beyond plant investments."
General Motors,2017-1,"Ford's North American auto operations, which account for about 90 percent of pre-tax profit, had adjusted profit margins for the quarter of 8.5 percent, up from 8.2 percent a year earlier."
General Motors,2017-1,"GM, however, reported 11.2 percent adjusted profit margin in North America in the third quarter, and has said it will easily eclipse its more than 10-percent margin target for the region for 2016. GM reports earnings on Feb. 7."
General Motors,2017-1,"Ford's 2016 North American pretax profit margin was 9.7 percent, from 10.2 percent in 2015. Ford CFO Shanks said the North American margin would have been 10.3 percent last year if not for a $570 million recall expense."

General Motors,2017-1,"Ford's revenue fell 4 percent to $38.7 billion in the quarter. The company said its pretax profit for 2016 was $10.4 billion, second to a record $10.8 billion reached in 2015."

General Motors,2017-1,{{20170126T180311.244+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-Detroit can power-steer around political obstacles(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.)
General Motors,2017-1,"NEW YORK, Jan 26 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Detroit is under scrutiny from Washington. New President Donald Trump told the bosses of Fiat Chrysler , Ford and General Motors on Tuesday that he wants more U.S. factories and jobs. In theory that could hobble the industry. But the Big Three have a few tricks up their sleeves."
General Motors,2017-1,"Trump's threat of a potential 35 percent tariff on vehicles made overseas and sold in America would affect 7.5 million units a year if taken to its extreme. That would require 38 new factories, assuming each could handle 200,000 units a year, at a cost of $1.6 billion each, based on what Ford was planning to spend on the plant in Mexico it canceled earlier this month. That's $60 billion in total."
General Motors,2017-1,"All three big Motown manufacturers have already painted these developments in ways that curry favor with Trump. They should also gain from his plans to slash the corporate tax rate to as little as 15 percent from the current headline 35 percent. Major exporters like Ford would get extra benefit if congressional Republicans' proposed border adjustments are adopted. Any loosening of the previous administration's fuel-economy standards should help, too."
General Motors,2017-1,"The carmakers can also turn autonomous-driving technology to their advantage. They're still playing catch-up with rivals and Silicon Valley in a capital-intensive business. Highlighting and even increasing their investments and hiring in this area, while pointing out the declining sales of Mexican-made cars, could play well in their boardrooms and the Oval Office alike. It's one way they can power-steer around political obstacles."
General Motors,2017-1,- Ford Motor on Jan. 26 reported a fourth-quarter loss of $783 million after taking a $2 billion after-tax charge driven by lower discount rates for the company's pension liabilities and other post-retirement benefit obligations. Ford had already announced the charge on Jan. 20.
General Motors,2017-1,"- Excluding the charge, earnings of 30 cents a share matched the consensus estimate of sell-side analysts. Revenue of $38.7 billion was $1.6 billion lower than in the final three months of 2015."
General Motors,2017-1,"- For the full 2016 year, Ford's revenue was up slightly on 2015 at $152 billion, while adjusted pre-tax income was $10.4 billion, 3.7 percent lower than in 2015. Ford reiterated that it expects to earn less in 2017."
General Motors,2017-1,"- President Donald Trump on Jan. 24 said he wants carmakers to open more factories in the United States. He made the comment in a meeting with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne, Ford boss Mark Fields and General Motors CEO Mary Barra."

General Motors,2017-1,"MEXICO CITY, Jan 24 (Reuters) - Under pressure from President Donald Trump, Mexico is preparing to discuss changes to trade rules about a product's country of origin to try to avoid a disruptive fight with the United States over commerce."
General Motors,2017-1,"As the two countries begin a difficult new relationship, Mexico sees possible common ground with Trump on the ""rules of origin"" of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) that binds the two countries and Canada, several sources said."
General Motors,2017-1,"Rules of origin are regulations setting out where trade products are sourced from. Although formal negotiations about NAFTA have not begun, the rules could eventually be altered to favor U.S. industry over competitors from outside North America, particularly in Asia."
General Motors,2017-1,Changes to those rules could help align Mexico with Trump's industrial strategy of boosting U.S. manufacturing jobs and dovetail with the Mexican government's calls to strengthen North American competitiveness.
General Motors,2017-1,"It could also help pave the way for a broader deal with Trump over border security and immigration, Mexican officials believe."
General Motors,2017-1,"Talks about NAFTA rules of origin will be a ""very important"" point of discussion between the two countries now that Trump is in office, a Mexican official said."
General Motors,2017-1,"A White House official said: ""As a general rule, it is in the best interests of the U.S. to insist on strong rules of origin provisions in pursuing bilateral negotiations. Lax rules of origin in proposed treaties like the now defunct Trans-Pacific Partnership shrink and weaken our supply chain and contribute to the offshoring of American jobs."""

General Motors,2017-1,"Fears of economic disaster have haunted Mexico since Trump won the presidency in November threatening to tear up NAFTA, impose protectionist tariffs and build a wall on the United States' southern border to halt illegal immigration."
General Motors,2017-1,"While Mexico is reluctant to alter the 1994 trade accord, officials concede that some changes may be necessary to help keep trade open with the United States, which absorbs 80 percent of its exports."
General Motors,2017-1,"""What we want is to maintain free access for Mexican products, without restrictions, without tariffs and quotas,"" Videgaray, the spearhead of the government's outreach to Trump, said on Monday."
General Motors,2017-1,"Speaking on condition of anonymity, two Mexican government officials and four other people familiar with ongoing discussions said Mexico saw rules of origin as an important avenue to brokering a deal with Trump, provided a fair compromise can be reached."
General Motors,2017-1,"In trade agreements, content rules or rules of origin are often used to determine import duties."
General Motors,2017-1,"Under NAFTA, 62.5 percent of the material in a car or light truck made in Mexico must be from North America to be able to enter the United States tariff free."
General Motors,2017-1,"If the countries agree in negotiations, that percentage could be increased, potentially giving an advantage to U.S. industry at the expense of Asian competitors."
General Motors,2017-1,"For Mexico, changing the rules of origin could be a lesser evil than Trump's threat to impose a 35 percent tax on certain goods made by foreign companies in Mexico for sale in the United States."
General Motors,2017-1,"Trump's pressure on U.S. automakers such as Ford to build more cars at home worries Mexico, where the industry has been one of the main drivers of growth and accounted for 18.5 percent of manufacturing GDP in 2015."

General Motors,2017-1,Mexico warned it could pull out of NAFTA if a renegotiation of the pact does not benefit it. [nL1N1FE4AM]
General Motors,2017-1,"Trump's team is behind the push for changes in the origin rules, seeing it as a means of reducing imports from China, two of the Mexican sources familiar with the matter said."
General Motors,2017-1,"Trump's nominee for Commerce Secretary, Wilbur Ross, spoke of the importance of content rules in protecting the automotive industry during Senate hearings last week, and Canadian media reported that Ross had told Canada rules of origin would be central to NAFTA talks. [nL4N1F844A]"
General Motors,2017-1,"NAFTA rules of origin apply to goods made in any of the three countries. Two Mexican sources said the Trump administration could push for national content requirements that would ensure that the United States benefits from changes in rules of origin, and not just the NAFTA region as a whole."
General Motors,2017-1,"However, that would be more complex to manage, they added."
General Motors,2017-1,"So as not to hurt companies, any changes would need to be phased in gradually, and the more items that were targeted, the trickier negotiations would be, one of the sources said."
General Motors,2017-1,"Any deal would need to ensure rules changes applied to all countries, not just to Mexico, one Mexican official said."
General Motors,2017-1,"Of the foreign carmakers in Mexico, Toyota <7203.T> might be able to handle a higher NAFTA content ratio better than others. Its Camry car, for example, has very high North American and U.S. content."
General Motors,2017-1,Other Japanese automakers such as Mazda <7261.T> have a larger proportional reliance on Asia-based suppliers.
General Motors,2017-1,"Kristin Dziczek, a labor analyst at the Center of Automotive Research, said deepening rules of origin could have some impact on U.S. jobs and would hit some foreign automakers harder - especially those that produce more parts and vehicles outside North America."
General Motors,2017-1,The NAFTA rules are in place to prevent China or other lower wage countries from being able to produce the majority of content in a vehicle and export it to another country to assemble it without paying tariffs.
General Motors,2017-1,U.S. automakers have not backed tougher rules of origin previously because they wanted flexibility on sourcing parts.

General Motors,2017-1,"WASHINGTON, Jan 24 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump urged the chief executives of the Big Three U.S. automakers on Tuesday to build more cars in the country, pressing his pledge to bring jobs to America and discourage the car industry from investing in Mexico."
General Motors,2017-1,"Trump, who has threatened to impose 35 percent tariffs on imported vehicles, opened a White House meeting with General Motors Co CEO Mary Barra, Ford Motor Co's Mark Fields and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV's Sergio Marchionne by saying he wanted to see more auto plants in the United States."
General Motors,2017-1,"In return, the new Republican president has vowed to cut regulations and taxes to make it more attractive for businesses to operate in the United States. He promised during his campaign to be a job-creating president and stressed that message in his inaugural address last Friday."
General Motors,2017-1,"""We have a very big push on to have auto plants and other plants - many other plants,"" he told reporters at the start of the meeting. ""It's happening. It's happening big league."""
General Motors,2017-1,"Matt Blunt, who heads a U.S. automaker trade association and attended the meeting, told Reuters that Trump asked what his administration could do ""on domestic and trade policy that would help make the United States more competitive and strengthen the ability of automakers to add production here."""
General Motors,2017-1,"The hour-long meeting was the latest sign of Trump's uncommon degree of intervention for a U.S. president into corporate affairs as he has repeatedly pressured automakers and other manufacturers to ""buy American and hire American."""
General Motors,2017-1,It was the first time the heads of the big three automakers met jointly with a U.S. president since a 2011 session with Barack Obama to tout a deal to nearly double fuel efficiency standards by 2025. Automakers have urged the Trump administration to rethink those aggressive mandates.
General Motors,2017-1,"The auto executives on Tuesday raised the issue of the fuel efficiency rules, trade policy and other regulatory matters, another person briefed on the meeting said. Marchionne told reporters afterward that Trump did not give them specifics on what regulations he would cut."
General Motors,2017-1,"The companies also discussed autonomous and electric vehicles and Trump asked about advanced vehicles, the person said."
General Motors,2017-1,"With flattening U.S. auto sales and excess capacity in the United States, U.S. automakers have been reluctant to open new U.S. auto plants in recent years. GM and Ford last built new U.S. assembly plants in 2004, while Fiat Chrysler opened a new transmission plant in Indiana in 2014."
General Motors,2017-1,"Kristin Dziczek, an analyst at the Michigan-based Center for Automotive Research, said automakers still had excess capacity in North America after suffering in the 1990s and 2000s from overcapacity and shifts in market share."
General Motors,2017-1,"Building a new plant would take three or more years and cost at least $1 billion, industry experts said."
General Motors,2017-1,"Automakers have expanded operations at existing U.S. plants to meet rising demand for trucks and SUVs. GM, Ford, Fiat Chrysler and foreign automakers have announced new U.S. jobs and investments in recent weeks."
General Motors,2017-1,"Coinciding with Tuesday's meeting, Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T> said it would add 400 jobs and invest $600 million in an Indiana plant, aiming to boost production of a popular SUV by 10 percent. [nL4N1FE2UN]"
General Motors,2017-1,"Ford's Fields said automakers wanted to work with Trump to create a ""renaissance in American manufacturing"" and that Trump's economic priorities were encouraging, including his move on Monday to formally bow out of the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership trade pact championed by Obama."
General Motors,2017-1,"""The mother of all trade barriers is currency manipulation. And TPP failed in meaningfully dealing with that, and we appreciate the president's courage to walk away from a bad trade deal,"" Fields told reporters after the meeting."
General Motors,2017-1,"Barra said there was a ""huge opportunity"" to work together with the government to ""improve the environment, improve safety and improve the jobs creation."""
General Motors,2017-1,"U.S. automakers have collectively added more than 78,000 jobs since 2009, the year when GM and Chrysler, now a unit of Italian-American Fiat Chrysler, filed for bankruptcy as part of government bailouts during the U.S. recession. They have invested more than $40 billion in U.S. facilities during that period."
General Motors,2017-1,"Despite the vocal pressure from Trump, the companies are unlikely to truly change their existing business plans for now, said Sam Fiorani, vice president of global vehicle forecasting with AutoForecast Solutions."
General Motors,2017-1,"""We need to have more concrete policies from the president,"" he said. ""Automakers will make decisions on whether there is a solid business case. Does it make more sense to build outside the U.S. or to build in the U.S.?"""
General Motors,2017-1,"GM said in 2014 it would invest $5 billion in Mexico through 2018, a move that would allow it to double its production capacity, and Barra has said the automaker is not reconsidering the plan."
General Motors,2017-1,"While automakers are adding U.S. jobs, they are also cutting U.S. production of small cars. On Monday, GM ended two shifts of production of small cars in Ohio and Michigan, cutting about 2,000 jobs."
General Motors,2017-1,"Barclays auto analyst Brian Johnson said in a note on Tuesday that ""automakers will be willing to make a deal that would bring back jobs to the U.S. in return for a slower ramp of (fuel efficiency) targets and related state-level mandates."""

General Motors,2017-1,"WASHINGTON, Jan 19 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Donald Trump is taking office more as a middle manager than a chief executive. In the two months between winning the election and his inauguration as 45th president of the United States, the reality-TV star has devoted far too much attention to trivial matters."
General Motors,2017-1,"As a real-estate mogul, Trump developed a reputation for keeping watch over even the tiniest parts of his business. Despite the vast new reach and consequence involved with his new job, he's sticking with that micro-managing style. Tom Barrack, chair of Trump's inaugural committee, told the New York Post that the president-elect has been picking out tablecloth fabrics for Friday's party. ""I beg him all the time to go back to running the free world and let me focus on setting the tables,"" Barrack said."
General Motors,2017-1,"They are not the only inconsequential details distracting Trump. While he has declined daily intelligence briefings, he found time to meet with chief executives of Boeing and Lockheed Martin to complain about airplane costs. Meanwhile, senior roles at the Council of Economic Advisers and other agencies remain unfilled."
General Motors,2017-1,"Celebrities, local public officials and athletes have paraded into Trump Tower for an audience with the next commander-in-chief. Trump chatted with rapper Kanye West, Oklahoma City Mayor Mick Cornett and Hall of Fame running back Jim Brown. Trump, whose sons are being given keys to the property kingdom and whose daughter and son-in-law will be joining him in the White House, also squeezed in some time with comedian Steve Harvey, who presides over the shenanigans on ""Family Feud."""
General Motors,2017-1,"And Trump has kept tweeting avidly. Along with tacitly setting U.S. industrial policy by calling out the likes of General Motors over jobs, he has offered up critiques of ""Saturday Night Live,"" where he is lampooned by Alec Baldwin. He also labeled Meryl Streep ""overrated"" after she bashed him while receiving a lifetime achievement award at the Golden Globes."
General Motors,2017-1,"Trump's to-do list is colossal, ranging from finding a new way to provide healthcare insurance to millions of Americans to overhauling the tax code to renegotiating global trade deals. With less than 24 hours until he occupies the Oval Office, here's hoping he can grow into the big promotion."
General Motors,2017-1,"- Donald Trump is set to take the oath of office on Jan. 20 to be the 45th president of the United States. After the swearing-in ceremony, Trump will participate in a procession and inaugural parade that ends at the White House. A ball is due to be held the same night."

General Motors,2017-1,"DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan 19 (Reuters) - Business leaders in Davos, traditionally the high priests of globalisation, are talking up the benefits of local production this week to shield themselves from criticism from incoming U.S. President Donald Trump."
General Motors,2017-1,"Elected on a jobs-focused ""America First"" platform, Trump has taken to Twitter to rebuke major companies like General Motors , Lockheed Martin and United Technologies , either for making goods in Mexico or for the price of their products."
General Motors,2017-1,"At this week's World Economic Forum (WEF), a gathering of business and political elites in the Swiss Alps synonymous with free markets, company bosses said they were now preparing to adjust to the Trump era."
General Motors,2017-1,"""The basic message is to be more national, don't just be global,"" Richard Edelman, CEO of communications marketing firm Edelman, told Reuters. ""Let's try and pre-empt that tweet by having a long-term discussion about the supply chain."""
General Motors,2017-1,"General Motors on Tuesday highlighted moves it said would add nearly 2,000 U.S. manufacturing jobs, including a decision to shift some production of axles to an American factory, rather than have them supplied from Mexico. The automaker said it wanted to ""build where we sell"". [nL4N1F74EB]"
General Motors,2017-1,"""There is no doubt we need to adapt,"" Carlos Ghosn, chief executive of Renault-Nissan <7201.T>, told Reuters. ""All carmakers have to revise their strategy as a function of what is coming."""
General Motors,2017-1,"At the same time, companies are reviewing potential mergers and rethinking job cuts, fearing the stigma of being labelled ""anti-American"". [nL1N1EW19P]"
General Motors,2017-1,What companies have yet to spell out is the economic cost of such shifts or the extent of localisation that will be needed to keep the peace with the new White House administration.
General Motors,2017-1,Adding to the incentive to increase U.S. manufacturing is the promise of lower corporate taxes under the Trump administration.
General Motors,2017-1,"""It could mean increased investment in the U.S.,"" Novartis CEO Joe Jimenez told Reuters. [nL5N1F81OE]"
General Motors,2017-1,"Vishal Sikka, chief executive of Infosys , which provides IT services to large companies including banks, said his company expected more business from helping companies localise."
General Motors,2017-1,"""The irony is that when more walls show up it is a good opportunity for services companies to help do business across those walls,"" he said."
General Motors,2017-1,"The move to go local in response to Trump looks set to fuel a trend already evident in some industries, including food and fashion, which are trying to tap into consumer demand for homegrown materials and production."

General Motors,2017-1,"DETROIT, Jan 19 (Reuters) - After an 18-month review, General Motors Co is nearer to resolving a raft of issues that have hobbled its $1 billion strategy for India, one of the fastest growing emerging markets for automobiles."
General Motors,2017-1,"The strategy, announced in July 2015, [nL4N1AB27X] includes selling one of its two Indian assembly plants to a Chinese partner; changing its vehicle platform to provide a product line-up better suited to the local market; and making India an export hub, two Asia-based people with knowledge of the plans told Reuters in Detroit this month. They did not want to be named as the review is ongoing."
General Motors,2017-1,"GM needs to finalize these moves to turn around its money-losing business in India, where its sales fell by more than a fifth last year to just 28,949 vehicles, taking its market share to below 1 percent."
General Motors,2017-1,"""India is a very tough market. It's growing and has potential for the future. But you need the right recipe,"" one of the individuals said."
General Motors,2017-1,"India's auto market, dominated by Japan's Suzuki Motor <7269.T> and South Korea's Hyundai Motor <005380.KS> and their local partners, is widely tipped to overtake Japan as the world's third biggest by around 2020."
General Motors,2017-1,GM said in mid-2015 it aimed to double its India market share by 2020. But its share fell to 0.93 percent last year from 1.18 percent in 2015 - even as India's market grew 7 percent to around 3 million vehicles.
General Motors,2017-1,"""Despite being one of the earliest entrants to India ... GM has consistently lost share. One issue is that it misunderstood what value means to Indian consumers. Value doesn't mean low price, it means having a product that has the right mix of good price and content,"" said Puneet Gupta, an analyst at IHS Markit in New Delhi."
General Motors,2017-1,"""That said, GM understands the market's potential and is positioning itself for a comeback. It has already been fairly successful in exporting small cars by leveraging the frugal engineering skills of India suppliers."""
General Motors,2017-1,"The U.S. automaker is close to selling its Halol plant in the western Gujarat state to SAIC Motor <600104.SS>, its main Chinese joint-venture partner, the two people said, predicting a deal would be finalised this year. [nL4N1EW3OK]"
General Motors,2017-1,"""We have a defined path: we are aligned with our partner SAIC. They want to take over that plant,"" one of them said."
General Motors,2017-1,"Selling the Halol facility, which has annual capacity for up to 110,000 vehicles, would allow GM to consolidate and modernize its India manufacturing capability at Talegaon, about 100 km (62 miles) southeast of Mumbai, which currently can produce 150,000 vehicles a year."
General Motors,2017-1,"The proposed sale to SAIC has dragged on, the people said, in part because of India's complex official approval process, which involves multiple stakeholders and regulators. They said a deal still needs to be approved by government agencies and the plant's labour union."
General Motors,2017-1,"GM is also reviewing its vehicle architecture so it can be more flexible and produce a range of more competitive small cars for India, the two people said, noting a market shift from no-frills sedans and 'people movers' to crossover sport utility vehicles (SUVs)."
General Motors,2017-1,"And GM needs to ""adjust to the new normal of ... low oil prices, foreign currency fluctuations and geopolitical instability"" to make its operations leaner and more efficient, one of the two people said, adding this could impact the $1 billion strategy price tag."
General Motors,2017-1,"""That's what we're looking into now; whether it will be that $1 billion or whether it will be less or more."""
General Motors,2017-1,"The shift in consumer preferences to SUVs has forced GM to re-think its product strategy, and put on hold a move to a new emerging market vehicle architecture - known internally as GEM - which it jointly developed with SAIC."
General Motors,2017-1,"GEM remains central to product programmes for markets such as Brazil, Mexico and China, but, for India, GM is now assessing it against other options to be more competitive."
General Motors,2017-1,"""There are several alternatives, and we are investigating right now,"" one of the two individuals said, declining to elaborate."

General Motors,2017-1,"WASHINGTON, Jan 18 (Reuters) - Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt, U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's choice to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, said on Wednesday he will review the Obama administration's recent decision to lock in fuel efficiency rules."
General Motors,2017-1,"On Friday, outgoing EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy finalized a determination that the landmark fuel efficiency rules instituted by President Barack Obama should be locked in through 2025, a bid to maintain a key part of his administration's climate legacy."
General Motors,2017-1,"""It merits review and I would review that,"" Pruitt said during a contentious Senate confirmation hearing, questioning the decision of McCarthy to finalize the determination just two weeks after the public comment period closed on Dec. 30."
General Motors,2017-1,Pruitt said separately he would not commit to allowing California to continue its own clean vehicle rules under a 2009 decision by the Obama administration.
General Motors,2017-1,"Major U.S. and foreign automakers have appealed to Trump, who has been critical of Obama's climate policies, to review the rules requiring them to nearly double fleet-wide fuel efficiency by 2025, saying they impose significant costs and are out of step with consumer preferences."
General Motors,2017-1,"As part of a 2012 regulation, EPA had to decide by April 2018 whether to modify the 2022-2025 model year vehicle emission rules requiring average fleet-wide efficiency of more than 50 miles per gallon."
General Motors,2017-1,"In 2011, Obama announced an agreement with major automakers to raise fuel efficiency standards to 54.5 miles per gallon. This, the administration said, would save motorists $1.7 trillion in fuel costs over the life of the vehicles, but cost the auto industry about $200 billion over 13 years."
General Motors,2017-1,"The EPA said in July that because Americans were buying fewer cars and more SUVs and trucks, it estimated the fleet will average 50.8 mpg to 52.6 mpg in 2025. In November, the agency moved up the timetable for proposing that automakers can meet the 2025 standards."
General Motors,2017-1,"McCarthy said her determination, a legally binding decision to maintain the fuel efficiency rules, rested on an extensive technical record. She said the rules are ""feasible, practical and appropriate"" and in ""the best interests of the auto industry."""
General Motors,2017-1,"Senator James Inhofe, an Oklahoma Republican, on Wednesday said McCarthy's determination was an ""extreme action"" that ""broke the deal"" with automakers."
General Motors,2017-1,Legal experts have said it will be more difficult for the Trump administration and Congress to undo the determination than to unwind other regulatory actions issued by the Obama administration during its final months in office.
General Motors,2017-1,"The 2025 determination is not a new regulation, so the EPA under Trump would likely have to go through an extensive process before withdrawing it and could face lawsuits from environmental groups if that step was taken."
General Motors,2017-1,"Separately. California's new Democrat Senator Kamala Harris asked Pruitt whether he would commit to upholding the California waiver. Pruitt did not say outright that he would uphold the waiver, which allows California to pursue its own emission standards that are more stringent than the federal rules."

General Motors,2017-1,"NEW YORK, Jan 18 (Reuters) - General Motors Co has agreed to pay $1 million to resolve a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission accounting case related to a faulty ignition switch linked to 124 deaths and 275 injuries, the regulator said on Wednesday."
General Motors,2017-1,"The deal would resolve charges that accounting control failures at the automaker prevented GM from properly assessing the potential financial impact of the defective ignition switch, which led to vehicle recalls beginning in 2014, the SEC said."
General Motors,2017-1,"The largest U.S. automaker said in a statement it consented to an administrative SEC order, without admitting or denying any wrongdoing. ""The SEC settlement does not call into question any of GM's current or prior financial statements or its disclosures,"" GM said."
General Motors,2017-1,The SEC said GM's internal investigation involving the defective ignition switch was not brought to the attention of its accountants until November 2013 even though other GM personnel understood in the spring of 2012 that a safety issue was at hand.
General Motors,2017-1,"""Internal accounting controls at General Motors failed to consider relevant accounting guidance when it came to considering disclosure of potential vehicle recalls,"" said Andrew M. Calamari, director of the SEC's New York Regional Office, said in the statement."
General Motors,2017-1,"Automakers must assess the likelihood of ""whether the potential recall will occur, and provide an estimate of the associated loss or range of loss or otherwise provide a statement that such an estimate cannot be made,"" the SEC said."
General Motors,2017-1,GM incurred ignition switch-related costs of more than $2 billion and set aside billions more for other recalls in 2014 and 2015.
General Motors,2017-1,"In 2015, GM paid $900 million to settle a U.S. Justice Department criminal investigation. It also set aside nearly $1.1 billion to settle lawsuits from investors and owners and pay injury and death claims stemming from the ignition switch recalls."

General Motors,2017-1,GM and other automakers have been sharply criticized by Republican U.S. President-elect Donald Trump for building vehicles in Mexico that are imported into the United States. Trump will be sworn in on Friday.
General Motors,2017-1,"GM said the $1 billion investment will create or retain 1,500 jobs. The Detroit automaker said details of individual projects will be announced throughout the year."
General Motors,2017-1,"""Thank you to General Motors and Walmart for starting the big jobs push back into the U.S.,"" Trump tweeted, referring as well to Wal-Mart Stores Inc's announcement that it will hire 10,000 U.S. workers in 2017 as part of a plan previously announced by the discount retailer. [nL4N1F73X6]"
General Motors,2017-1,"GM also said it will begin work on bringing axle production for its next generation of full-size pickup trucks, including work previously done in Mexico, to operations in Michigan, creating 450 U.S. jobs."
General Motors,2017-1,The part was previously built by American Axle & Manufacturing Holdings Inc . American Axle did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
General Motors,2017-1,"GM spokeswoman Joanne Krell said the automaker planned to add 7,000 new U.S. jobs over the next two to three years. Krell said the decisions being announced ""had been in the works for some time"" but she added ""the timing was good for us to share what we are doing."""
General Motors,2017-1,"The 7,000 figure includes the 450 jobs on axle production, 1,500 jobs tied to the $1 billion announcement and more than 5,000 new jobs tied to engineering, GM Financial and advanced technology."
General Motors,2017-1,GM in 2014 announced it was investing $5 billion in Mexico and doubling production capacity by 2018. GM said last week it had no plans to cancel Mexican investments despite Trump pressure.
General Motors,2017-1,"GM said it had added about 6,000 U.S. jobs, consisting of 4,000 hourly and 2,000 salaried positions, since the end of 2015 for a total American workforce of 103,000."
General Motors,2017-1,"Since GM's bankruptcy restructuring in 2009, when it had 77,000 U.S. employees, it has added more than 25,000 jobs as it boosted production, acquired an auto finance company and brought information technology work in house."

General Motors,2017-1,"Trump has been inaccurate in describing some U.S. auto investments, wrongly saying last week that Fiat Chrysler was planning to build a new factory in the United States. The company announced it is investing $1 billion in two existing plants, adding 2,000 jobs."
General Motors,2017-1,"On Jan. 3, Trump threatened to impose a ""big border tax"" on GM for making some of its Chevrolet Cruze compacts in Mexico - and he has extended that threat to German automakers like BMW AG and Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T> over building vehicles abroad. Separately, Hyundai Motor Group said Tuesday in South Korea that it plans to boost U.S. investment by 50 percent to $3.1 billion over five years and may build a new plant in the United States."
General Motors,2017-1,"Hyundai Motor Co <005380.KS> and Kia Motors Corp <000270.KS>, which make up the Hyundai Motor Group, have not been directly criticized by Trump but they may have felt vulnerable because among major brands, they have one of the lowest ratios of cars built in the United States to cars sold."

General Motors,2017-1,"NEW YORK, Jan 17 (Reuters Breakingviews) - General Motors is rolling off the factory floor a buzzword custom-designed for Donald Trump. The automaker was recently harangued by the president-elect for building cars in Mexico. Now it's bragging about ""insourcing"" 6,500 jobs to America. Chief Executive Mary Barra isn't the first to use the term, but she is ahead of the curve as more companies try to curry favor with the next commander-in-chief."
General Motors,2017-1,"Companies touting how they're investing in their U.S. businesses has quickly become commonplace. Wal-Mart , for example, said on Tuesday that 10,000 jobs will come from an investment plan announced last October."
General Motors,2017-1,"GM is taking it one step further. Its announcement on Tuesday contained a flurry of breathless jargon extolling how the $57 billion car producer is investing money and creating new employment opportunities in the United States. It is, for example, ""insourcing"" to Michigan 450 posts that are currently south of the border."
General Motors,2017-1,"Keeping tally of the number of jobs, however, is a brain twister that makes GM's safe-harbor statement an easier read by comparison. GM trumpets 7,000 new positions in total, but only a fraction from ""insourcing."" Of the rest, 1,500 are tied to an extra $1 billion the company is investing in its U.S. manufacturing operations, with 5,000 new gigs tied to various other divisions including engineering and its car-loans unit."

General Motors,2017-1,"BOSTON, Jan 17 (Reuters) - David Einhorn's hedge fund Greenlight Capital, which gained 8.4 percent in 2016, said on Tuesday it raised its stake in General Motors , already the firm's biggest position, and still likes Apple Inc but is betting that companies like Caterpillar Inc. and other industrial cyclicals will fall."
General Motors,2017-1,"In a letter to Greenlight clients dated Monday and seen by Reuters, the firm said it feels it is well positioned for 2017.

General Motors,2017-1,Automaker General Motors is already the hedge fund's biggest name in the portfolio with 17 million shares owned at the end of September. Greenlight did not say by how much it raised its stake but will disclose that next month when it releases its holdings for the end of December.

General Motors,2017-1,"On the other hand, Trump's promises to build roads and bridges, which had sent many infrastructure-related companies surging after the election, signal a sign to sell because they moved much higher.

General Motors,2017-1,"But he is sticking by his bet on gold, arguing that Trump could create many economic and geopolitical uncertainties where gold could be a helpful hedge.

General Motors,2017-1,"Under pressure to deliver on campaign promises to revive U.S. industrial jobs, Trump has warned of a 35 percent tax on vehicles imported from Mexico, where many automakers have taken advantage of the country's lower labour costs."

General Motors,2017-1,"Hyundai Motor Co <005380.KS> and Kia Motors Corp <000270.KS> which make up the Hyundai Motor Group have not been directly criticised by Trump but they may have felt vulnerable because among major brands, they have one of the lowest ratios of cars built in the United States to cars sold."
General Motors,2017-1,"Chung Jin-haeng, president of the group, denied the plan was due to pressure from Trump, adding that a new U.S. factory would depend on whether demand improved under the next U.S. administration."

General Motors,2017-1,"BEIJING, Jan 17 (Reuters) - General Motors Co's Cadillac expects sales in China to continue growing at a double-digit rate this year, but at a slower pace than in 2016 when volumes saw a sharp spike after the brand opened its first dedicated factory in the country."
General Motors,2017-1,"Cadillac, relatively late to introduce local production in the world's biggest auto market, is among a second wave of luxury car brands in China that seek to take market share from established brands such as BMW , Daimler's Mercedes-Benz, and Volkswagen's Audi."
General Motors,2017-1,"While it surpassed Toyota's <7203.T> Lexus, which does not manufacture in China, in sales to become the fifth best-selling premium marque in the country last year, Cadillac still lags the German ""Big Three"" and No. 4 Jaguar Land Rover [TAMOJL.UL]."
General Motors,2017-1,"The brand has to do a ""mind shift"" to no longer think of itself as a second-tier brand, Cadillac's China chief, Andreas Schaaf, told Reuters in an interview on Tuesday. ""We want to move up to the top three,"" he said, adding he expects China to become Cadillac's biggest market in less than five years."
General Motors,2017-1,"""We are expecting another double-digit growth in China. Most likely not in the same range as what we have seen last year (2016) because growth of nearly 50 percent is truly a very exceptional year,"" he said during the interview."
General Motors,2017-1,"Underlining the brand's aim to be perceived as international and cut its reliance on its home market, the United States, Schaaf said Cadillac planned to launch more products in China ahead of other regions in the future."
General Motors,2017-1,"This month, Cadillac is rolling out a plug-in hybrid version of its CT6 flagship sedan in China, which it looks to follow up with launches of more plug-ins and electric vehicles to meet the country's strict emission regulations."
General Motors,2017-1,"Cadillac's CT6 plug-in uses 1.7 litres of petrol per 100 kilometres, versus 7.9 litres for the normal version and far below China's average fuel use requirements of 5 litres by 2020."
General Motors,2017-1,"Shanghai, where plug-ins get free license plates, is the key market for the CT6 hybrid, he said."
General Motors,2017-1,"""A brand that doesn't have more plug-ins and more electric vehicles will most likely have a very difficult future in China,"" Schaaf said."
General Motors,2017-1,"China's auto market recorded a 13.7 percent rise in sales for 2016, aided partly by a cut in taxes on small-engine vehicles. Sales growth is expected to slow this year as the incentive is phased out by 2018. [nL4N1F13A4]"

General Motors,2017-1,"Since the beginning of this year, GM has come under heavy criticism from Trump for building vehicles in Mexico, as have other automakers. On Jan. 3, Trump threatened to impose a ""big border tax"" on GM for making some of its Chevrolet Cruze compact cars in Mexico."
General Motors,2017-1,"At a news conference last week, Trump cited recent U.S. investments by other automakers and said ""General Motors will be following, and I think they will be."""
General Motors,2017-1,"Trump, who campaigned hard on bringing manufacturing jobs back to the United States, said in an interview with German newspaper Bild published on Monday that he would impose a border tax of 35 percent on German car companies' vehicles imported to the U.S. market."
General Motors,2017-1,Earlier this month he criticized Toyota Motor Corp's <7203.T> plans to move production of the Corolla to Mexico from Canada.
General Motors,2017-1,"Auto sales have been rising since 2009 and hit a new record in 2016. Automakers have recently been touting American investments, but say the investments have not been in response to Trump."
General Motors,2017-1,"Last week, Japan's Toyota said it would invest $10 billion in the United States over the next five years, while Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV said it would invest $1 billion to modernize two plants in the Midwest, creating 2,000 jobs."
General Motors,2017-1,Ford Motor Co announced this month it would cancel a planned $1.6 billion factory in Mexico and would invest $700 million at a Michigan plant.
General Motors,2017-1,"GM's ""general plan is to build where we sell and we're focused on what we're doing in the United States,"" Chief Executive Mary Barra said in an interview with Reuters on the sidelines of an event in Washington on Monday. ""We're a global company so we're going to continue that focus."""
General Motors,2017-1,"Barra, who told Reuters she planned to attend Trump's inauguration on Friday, said GM wants to work with him. ""I do believe we have more in common than we have areas that we aren't aligned."""

General Motors,2017-1,"China, struggling with catastrophic pollution levels in major cities, is aggressively pushing plug-in vehicles.

General Motors,2017-1,"BEIJING, Jan 11 (Reuters) - More electric cars are sold in China than in the rest of the world combined, but are mainly locally-branded models that are cheaper and have a shorter range than those offered by foreign automakers such as Tesla and Nissan <7203.T>."
General Motors,2017-1,The Chinese-branded electric vehicle (EV) market is propped up by huge government subsidies as part of Beijing's policy to build global leadership in cleaner energy driving.
General Motors,2017-1,"China has spent billions of dollars on subsidies to help companies including Warren Buffett-backed BYD <002594.SZ> <1211.HK> and BAIC Motor <1958.HK> achieve large-scale production of plug-in vehicles, which are gaining traction among urban drivers as well as taxi fleets and government agencies."
General Motors,2017-1,"Sales of battery electric and plug-in hybrids increased 60 percent in January-November, to 402,000 vehicles. By 2020, China wants 5 million plug-in cars on its roads."
General Motors,2017-1,"The domestic EVs don't have the 'wow' factor of a fast, longer-range and luxury-style Tesla. They sell on price."
General Motors,2017-1,"In Shanghai last year, a two-door battery electric Chery eQ cost around 60,000 yuan ($8,655) after subsidies. Without subsidies, the eQ would cost an additional 100,000 yuan or so. At this week's Detroit auto show, General Motors showed off its latest Bolt EV, which costs around $30,000 after a $7,500 federal tax credit."
General Motors,2017-1,"""EV cars are very cheap (in China), you'll only spend a little money to buy a car. If you just go to work or use an EV in the city, it's OK ... for using within 100 kms (62 miles),"" said Xie Chao, who works for a chemical company in Shanghai."
General Motors,2017-1,"Xie said he has bought three EVs since 2015 - an Anhui Jianghuai Automobile <600418.SS> iEV4, a BAIC EV160 and a Geely Automobile <0175.HK> Emgrand EV - one for him to use, one for his wife and one he rents out."
General Motors,2017-1,"Most Chinese electric cars come with similar specifications, so price is the deciding factor, said Dawei Zhang, CEO of EVBuy, a dealer. The eQ has been the top seller in recent months, with decent enough quality at a low price, he said."
General Motors,2017-1,"""It's a transport tool. It's purely for mobility rather than for showing off, having a big car for all the family, or for any technology factors,"" he added."
General Motors,2017-1,"Some EV buyers in Beijing and Shanghai said they primarily bought plug-in vehicles to easily get a license plate. Half a dozen of China's biggest cities tightly control license plates for traditional gasoline cars, but freely award plates that can only be used by plug-in vehicles."
General Motors,2017-1,"For those set on buying a plug-in, price is key."
General Motors,2017-1,"""I only considered BYD and BAIC. I definitely can't afford the 300,000-600,000 yuan price of a luxury-style Tesla or Denza,"" said Qu Lijian, a 31-year-old government worker in Beijing, who eventually opted for a BYD Qin pure electric car."
General Motors,2017-1,Denza is a Chinese brand produced by a joint venture between BYD and Daimler .
General Motors,2017-1,"China's cocktail of pro-electric policies is a challenge for global automakers, as foreign manufacturers can access subsidies only via joint ventures with local partners, producing cars under new made-for-China brand names such as Denza."
General Motors,2017-1,"But those brands lack the cachet of established foreign marques, and cost more than most local brands even after subsidies."
General Motors,2017-1,"That's in part because Chinese automakers are more aggressive in lowering their costs regardless of quality, said an executive at a multinational auto parts firm."
General Motors,2017-1,"""The lowest price wins (the contract). That's the process, no questions asked,"" said the executive, who declined to be identified to avoid impacting future contract bidding."
General Motors,2017-1,"""And when you win, they come back and ask you for another price reduction,"" the executive added, noting less stringent safety regulations in China also help keep costs lower than in the United States."
General Motors,2017-1,"The version of the Leaf that Nissan's joint venture with Dongfeng Automobile <600006.SS> offers in China, under the Venucia brand, ""isn't selling very well,"" Nissan's global chief Carlos Ghosn told Reuters in November. Chinese EV buyers don't want to spend much more than $8,000, after incentives, and the Nissan vehicle is too expensive, Ghosn said."
General Motors,2017-1,"The playing field for foreign brands in China should, though, gradually even out as subsidies are phased out by 2020."
General Motors,2017-1,"This year, subsidies have been reduced by a fifth, likely adding about 15,000 yuan to the price of a Chery eQ, though official 2017 subsidies for individual models aren't yet clear, notes EVBuy."
General Motors,2017-1,"Local EV manufacturers have, with the help of subsidies, been able to build economies of scale, pushing down their cost per unit and allowing them to spend more on research and development, Li Yunfei, BYD's deputy chief of branding and public relations, told Reuters."
General Motors,2017-1,"""By 2020, China will have no subsidies, but your scale has expanded, your costs have come down, and you'll be able to hit a price that consumers can accept,"" he said."
General Motors,2017-1,"While China has grabbed early-mover advantage, global automakers plan to quickly ramp up their plug-in offerings in the world's biggest market. GM's local joint venture, for example, promises to spend 26.5 billion yuan ($3.8 billion) on electrification and developing 10 ""new energy"" models by 2020."

General Motors,2017-1,"Under the program, which came into effect on Jan. 1, companies that are the biggest polluters must buy permits if they exceed set limits on greenhouse gas emissions."
General Motors,2017-1,"Automakers and other large companies are exempt from the plan until 2020 and some want that exemption to be extended, a third source said. They also want federal and provincial governments to share the cost of investments in new technology that would cut emissions and energy consumption, the person added."
General Motors,2017-1,All three sources spoke on condition of anonymity before the closed-door meeting.
General Motors,2017-1,"Canada's automakers, the country's largest exporters, received a boost in 2016, after they agreed to C$2 billion ($1.5 billion) in investments during union negotiations."
General Motors,2017-1,"""This could be more burdensome for manufacturers, if Canada is doing cap-and-trade but Trump is cutting back regulations,"" said one of the sources."
General Motors,2017-1,"Stephen Carlisle, managing director of General Motors Co in Canada, said automakers are committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, but described potential higher costs from cap-and-trade after 2020 as ""headwinds."" He would like governments to support automakers which invest in technological improvements to reduce energy consumption and emissions."
General Motors,2017-1,"Jerry Dias, president of Unifor, which represents Canadian autoworkers, noted a deal this week by the Ontario and Canadian governments to defray up to 17 percent of Honda Motor Co's <7267.T> C$492 million investment to modernize its Alliston paint shop.

General Motors,2017-1,"Since the Nov. 8 election, Trump has taken to Twitter to call out by name a number of manufacturers with both planned and existing operations outside of the country."
General Motors,2017-1,"On Wednesday, he returned to the issue in his first news conference since the election. Trump, who will be sworn into office on Jan. 20, warned of a ""very large border tax"" on companies that shift production to foreign countries."
General Motors,2017-1,"""You want to move your plant, and you think, as an example, you're going to build that plant in Mexico, and you're going to make your air conditioners or your cars, or whatever you're making, and you're going to sell them through what will be a very, very strong border ... Not going to happen. You're going to pay a very large border tax,"" he warned."
General Motors,2017-1,"U.S. automakers in particular have felt the brunt of Trump's ire, as he has called for the industry to return to former manufacturing hubs in the American Midwest from Mexico, which accounts for a fifth of all vehicle production in North America and has attracted more than $24 billion in auto investment since 2010, according to the Ann Arbor, Michigan-based Center for Automotive Research."
General Motors,2017-1,"Trump thanked Fiat Chrysler and Ford Motor Co for announcements in the past week of investments in Midwestern plants. He added that he hoped General Motors Co , the No. 1 American automaker, would take similar steps to expand U.S. operations."
General Motors,2017-1,"On Monday, Fiat Chrysler Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne said, ""It's possible, if the economic terms imposed by the U.S. administration on anything that comes into the United States that, if they're sufficiently large, that it would make the production of anything in Mexico uneconomical."
General Motors,2017-1,"""We would have to withdraw,"" Marchionne said. ""It is quite possible."" [nL1N1EZ10T]"
General Motors,2017-1,"Trump also reiterated his criticism of Lockheed Martin Corp's F-35 fighter jet program, saying it was ""way, way behind schedule and many, many billions of dollars over budget."""
General Motors,2017-1,"After the news conference, Lockheed Martin said in a statement read on CNBC, ""We understand President-elect Trump's concerns about the F-35 program and we've given him our full commitment to drive down cost aggressively."""
General Motors,2017-1,"In its annual State of the American Business Address on Wednesday morning, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which traditionally has worked in concert with the Republican Party, urged Trump not to add to the ""burdens"" of exporters by erecting barriers to trade that could hamper economic growth."

General Motors,2017-1,"{{20170111T123505.130+0000}}China's anti-Teslas: cheap models drive electric car boom* Chinese electric cars can cost just $8,000 after subsidies"
General Motors,2017-1,"* China Nissan Leaf model too expensive by comparison - CEO Subsidies reduced 20 pct this year, phased out by 2020"
General Motors,2017-1,"BEIJING, Jan 11 (Reuters) - More electric cars are sold in China than in the rest of the world combined, but are mainly locally-branded models that are cheaper and have a shorter range than those offered by foreign automakers such as Tesla and Nissan <7203.T>."
General Motors,2017-1,The Chinese-branded electric vehicle (EV) market is propped up by huge government subsidies as part of Beijing's policy to build global leadership in cleaner energy driving.
General Motors,2017-1,"China has spent billions of dollars on subsidies to help companies including Warren Buffett-backed BYD <002594.SZ> <1211.HK> and BAIC Motor <1958.HK> achieve large-scale production of plug-in vehicles, which are gaining traction among urban drivers as well as taxi fleets and government agencies."
General Motors,2017-1,"Sales of battery electric and plug-in hybrids increased 60 percent in January-November, to 402,000 vehicles. By 2020, China wants 5 million plug-in cars on its roads."
General Motors,2017-1,"The domestic EVs don't have the 'wow' factor of a fast, longer-range and luxury-style Tesla. They sell on price."
General Motors,2017-1,"In Shanghai last year, a two-door battery electric Chery eQ cost around 60,000 yuan ($8,655) after subsidies. Without subsidies, the eQ would cost an additional 100,000 yuan or so. At this week's Detroit auto show, General Motors showed off its latest Bolt EV, which costs around $30,000 after a $7,500 federal tax credit."
General Motors,2017-1,"""EV cars are very cheap (in China), you'll only spend a little money to buy a car. If you just go to work or use an EV in the city, it's OK ... for using within 100 kms (62 miles),"" said Xie Chao, who works for a chemical company in Shanghai."
General Motors,2017-1,"Xie said he has bought three EVs since 2015 - an Anhui Jianghuai Automobile <600418.SS> iEV4, a BAIC EV160 and a Geely Automobile <0175.HK> Emgrand EV - one for him to use, one for his wife and one he rents out."
General Motors,2017-1,"Most Chinese electric cars come with similar specifications, so price is the deciding factor, said Dawei Zhang, CEO of EVBuy, a dealer. The eQ has been the top seller in recent months, with decent enough quality at a low price, he said."
General Motors,2017-1,"""It's a transport tool. It's purely for mobility rather than for showing off, having a big car for all the family, or for any technology factors,"" he added."
General Motors,2017-1,"Some EV buyers in Beijing and Shanghai said they primarily bought plug-in vehicles to easily get a license plate. Half a dozen of China's biggest cities tightly control license plates for traditional gasoline cars, but freely award plates that can only be used by plug-in vehicles."
General Motors,2017-1,"For those set on buying a plug-in, price is key."
General Motors,2017-1,"""I only considered BYD and BAIC. I definitely can't afford the 300,000-600,000 yuan price of a luxury-style Tesla or Denza,"" said Qu Lijian, a 31-year-old government worker in Beijing, who eventually opted for a BYD Qin pure electric car."
General Motors,2017-1,Denza is a Chinese brand produced by a joint venture between BYD and Daimler .
General Motors,2017-1,"China's cocktail of pro-electric policies is a challenge for global automakers, as foreign manufacturers can access subsidies only via joint ventures with local partners, producing cars under new made-for-China brand names such as Denza."
General Motors,2017-1,"But those brands lack the cachet of established foreign marques, and cost more than most local brands even after subsidies."
General Motors,2017-1,"That's in part because Chinese automakers are more aggressive in lowering their costs regardless of quality, said an executive at a multinational auto parts firm."
General Motors,2017-1,"""The lowest price wins (the contract). That's the process, no questions asked,"" said the executive, who declined to be identified to avoid impacting future contract bidding."
General Motors,2017-1,"""And when you win, they come back and ask you for another price reduction,"" the executive added, noting less stringent safety regulations in China also help keep costs lower than in the United States."
General Motors,2017-1,"The version of the Leaf that Nissan's joint venture with Dongfeng Automobile <600006.SS> offers in China, under the Venucia brand, ""isn't selling very well,"" Nissan's global chief Carlos Ghosn told Reuters in November. Chinese EV buyers don't want to spend much more than $8,000, after incentives, and the Nissan vehicle is too expensive, Ghosn said."
General Motors,2017-1,"The playing field for foreign brands in China should, though, gradually even out as subsidies are phased out by 2020."
General Motors,2017-1,"This year, subsidies have been reduced by a fifth, likely adding about 15,000 yuan to the price of a Chery eQ, though official 2017 subsidies for individual models aren't yet clear, notes EVBuy."
General Motors,2017-1,"Local EV manufacturers have, with the help of subsidies, been able to build economies of scale, pushing down their cost per unit and allowing them to spend more on research and development, Li Yunfei, BYD's deputy chief of branding and public relations, told Reuters."
General Motors,2017-1,"""By 2020, China will have no subsidies, but your scale has expanded, your costs have come down, and you'll be able to hit a price that consumers can accept,"" he said."
General Motors,2017-1,"While China has grabbed early-mover advantage, global automakers plan to quickly ramp up their plug-in offerings in the world's biggest market. GM's local joint venture, for example, promises to spend 26.5 billion yuan ($3.8 billion) on electrification and developing 10 ""new energy"" models by 2020."
General Motors,2017-1,Chinese brands such as GAC Motor and BYD are looking to advance on global rivals' home turf.
General Motors,2017-1,"GAC Motor, part of Guangzhou Automobile Group <601238.SS>, debuted its pure electric GE3 sport utility vehicle, among other models, at the Detroit show on Monday. A spokeswoman told Reuters that the company plans to enter the United States by 2019, delaying from an initial target of 2017, without further explanation."
General Motors,2017-1,"Shenzhen-based BYD already sells its electric buses in Africa, Europe and South America and has a factory in the United States. The company is preparing ""on all fronts"" to enter foreign passenger car markets, Li said, without elaborating."
General Motors,2017-1,"""Because Chinese companies have this large Chinese market, when they have big enough scale and their power grows, their products improve and they increasingly understand foreign markets,"" he said."
General Motors,2017-1,"""In the future, they will definitely take the world stage. The potential is huge."""

General Motors,2017-1,"DETROIT/BERLIN, Jan 10 (Reuters) - Volkswagen AG confirmed on Tuesday it has negotiated a $4.3 billion draft settlement with U.S. regulators to resolve its diesel emissions troubles and plans to plead guilty to criminal misconduct."
General Motors,2017-1,"The guilty plea is part of the civil and criminal deal as the automaker looks to restore its tarnished global brand. Volkswagen said with the addition of the fine, its diesel costs will exceed the nearly 18.2 billion euros ($19.2 billion) it has set aside to handle the problem. VW also said it will face oversight by an independent monitor over the next three years."
General Motors,2017-1,Reuters reported earlier the company's supervisory board is set to meet on Wednesday to approve a civil and criminal settlement with the U.S. Justice Department over the automaker's diesel emissions. VW said the supervisory board and the management board would meet Tuesday or possibly Wednesday to approve the deal.
General Motors,2017-1,"VW is expected to plead guilty as part of the settlement as early as Wednesday, a source familiar with matter said. The plea deal will need the approval of a U.S. judge."
General Motors,2017-1,"Evercore ISI said in a research note it believes the ""settlement is intended to draw a line under all remaining U.S. related legal risk. This is good news."""
General Motors,2017-1,VW had raced to get a deal done before President Barack Obama leaves office on Jan. 20. A change in administration could have delayed a final settlement for months if not longer.
General Motors,2017-1,"""The most important news is that VW managed to come to an agreement that allows the company to move on from here. It's a major relief that this doesn't get dragged into the new U.S. administration,"" Evercore ISI said."
General Motors,2017-1,"VW admitted in September 2015 to installing secret software in hundreds of thousands of U.S. diesel cars to cheat exhaust emissions tests and make them appear cleaner than they were on the road, and that as many as 11 million vehicles could have similar software installed worldwide."
General Motors,2017-1,"On Monday, a VW executive, Oliver Schmidt, the second VW employee charged by U.S. prosecutors, was accused of conspiracy to defraud the United States over the company's emissions cheating and the automaker was accused of concealing the cheating from regulators."
General Motors,2017-1,"The Justice Department settlement with VW will not end the Justice Department's investigation into individual misconduct and more executives may face charges, sources said.[nL5N1EZ44Q]"
General Motors,2017-1,VW still must spend the next two years buying back or fixing dirty U.S. vehicles and faces unresolved lawsuits from U.S. investors and about 20 U.S. states.
General Motors,2017-1,"Volkswagen's expected guilty plea is in contrast to Justice Department deferred prosecution agreements with Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T> and General Motors Co , which were both accused of misleading regulators or consumers and paid fines of $1.2 billion and $900 million, respectively, but were not required to plead guilty."
General Motors,2017-1,"VW warned in a financial disclosure the impact of the U.S. settlement on 2016 group results cannot be quantified yet, citing ""various further factors."""
General Motors,2017-1,"VW said in late October it expected the group operating margin to come in at the upper end of a 5 to 6 percent target range before one-off items, compared with 6 percent in 2015."
General Motors,2017-1,"Separately, Porsche SE , the main shareholder of VW, issued a profit warning after the VW news."
General Motors,2017-1,"The settlement on U.S. criminal and civil fines will negatively affect Porsche SE's results for 2016, the company said, adding it is possible the net result may drop below the previously reported range of 1.4-2.4 billion euros."
General Motors,2017-1,"Volkswagen had previously agreed to spend up to $17.5 billion in the United States to resolve claims by U.S. regulators, owners and dealers and offered to buy back nearly 500,000 polluting vehicles."
General Motors,2017-1,"Much of the company's senior management departed following the scandal, including chief executive Martin Winterkorn."
General Motors,2017-1,"VW Group said on Tuesday it had record sales in 2016 of 10.3 million vehicles, including a 12 percent increase in December. That figure should put VW ahead of Japanese rival Toyota Motor as the world's largest car producer by volume for the year."
General Motors,2017-1,"On Monday, VW shares rose 4.2 percent to their highest since September 2015 on optimism about the expected U.S. criminal settlement, topping the German blue-chip DAX index. The shares are still 10 percent below pre-scandal levels."
General Motors,2017-1,VW shares closed up less than 0.2 percent in trading Tuesday in Frankfurt before the company's announcement.

General Motors,2017-1,{{20170110T211140.421+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-Fiat and GM show limits of shareholder optimism(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.)
General Motors,2017-1,"NEW YORK, Jan 10 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and General Motors are showing the limits of shareholder optimism about their industry. The surge in sales of high-margin, U.S.-made trucks and SUVs is not only boosting their profit and stock prices. It should also help keep the ""America-first"" concerns of President-elect Donald Trump at bay. Longer-term challenges, though, are keeping most carmakers' valuations deflated."
General Motors,2017-1,"Mary Barra, chief executive of GM, America's largest carmaker, told investors on Tuesday that earnings in 2016 will be at the high end of previous forecasts and will grow next year. Ford expects its earnings to fall. Meanwhile, shares in FCA, the Italian-American concern run by Sergio Marchionne, have sped ahead by almost 50 percent since the day before the U.S. election - followed by Peugeot at over 20 percent and GM only a little shy of that figure."
General Motors,2017-1,"The rally has been stoked by hopes that Trump will cut corporate taxes and by rising sales of the chunky vehicles that appeal to U.S. drivers when fuel prices are relatively low. Record U.S. vehicle sales of 17.5 million last year were only a tad higher than in 2015. But SUVs and trucks accounted for almost 60 percent, up from 56 percent 12 months earlier, according to Kelley Blue Book. And that trend is expected to continue."
General Motors,2017-1,"Most carmakers are playing catch-up to leaders Fiat and GM. True, Ford's F-150 truck remains the U.S. market's best-selling vehicle, but the manufacturer has sidelined other brands in recent years. At the North American International Auto Show in Detroit on Monday, executives revealed they're bringing back the Ranger pickup truck and the Bronco SUV of O.J. Simpson car-chase fame. Nissan <7201.T>, Toyota <7203.T>, Honda <7267.T> and others are ramping up, too."
General Motors,2017-1,"Even after recent gains, however, Fiat Chrysler trades at just 6.4 times estimated 2017 earnings, according to Thomson Reuters data. That puts it ahead of GM, which boasts better pre-tax margins. But trading below 10 times earnings suggests investors expect these companies to shrink."
General Motors,2017-1,"The two are, though, symbols of their industry. Only Honda and Toyota trade above the 10 times yardstick, and only barely. Investors see too many risks. Rising consumer-borrowing costs may hit sales this year, for example. And the big automakers have not yet solved the longer-term existential problem presented by the shift to technology-heavy autonomous and driverless cars. In such investment conditions, driving cautiously makes sense."
General Motors,2017-1,- General Motors Chief Executive Mary Barra said on Jan. 10 that full-year earnings for 2016 should be at the high end of the guidance the company had previously given of $5.50 to $6 a share. She also said GM is targeting earnings of between $6 and $6.50 a share for 2017.
General Motors,2017-1,- Rival Ford Motor said in November that it expects its pre-tax profit to fall in 2017 as it invests in electric and self-driving vehicles as well as in car-sharing technology.
General Motors,2017-1,"- Shares of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles have risen nearly 50 percent since Nov. 7, 2016, the day before the U.S. presidential election. GM shares are up 16 percent, and Ford stock has gained 11 percent."
General Motors,2017-1,"- Several major carmakers have unveiled new SUVs and small trucks at this year's North American International Auto Show in Detroit, which runs until Jan. 22."
General Motors,2017-1,"- Ford is upgrading its F-150 pickup truck as well as bringing back the Bronco, an SUV it last built in 1996, and the Ranger pickup truck which has not rolled off U.S. production lines since 2011. Nissan unveiled the Rogue Sport, a brand to be sold in what used to be a sedan segment. General Motors rolled out the next version of the Chevrolet Traverse and the GMC Terrain."

General Motors,2017-1,"DETROIT, Jan 10 (Reuters) - No. 1 U.S. automaker General Motors Co on Tuesday gave an upbeat profit outlook for 2017 that was significantly above Wall Street forecasts, countering analysts' concerns that the U.S. car industry peaked in 2016 after several years of record or near-record sales, sending its shares up nearly 4 percent."
General Motors,2017-1,GM said it expects its earnings for 2016 at the high end of its previous forecast and that profits will rise 2017.

General Motors,2017-1,"The Detroit-based automaker said it expects 2017 earnings per share in a range of $6 to $6.50. Analysts have, on average, predicted the company post EPS this year of $5.76, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S."
General Motors,2017-1,"GM said it expects full-year 2016 EPS at the high end of its previously announced range of $5.50 to $6. Analysts currently expect 2016 EPS of $6.01, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S."
General Motors,2017-1,"In September, rival U.S. automaker Ford Motor Co lowered its 2016 pre-tax profit forecast, blaming a charge related to a vehicle recall. Ford has been trading at 6.29 times earnings, above GM, which has been trading at 4.12 times earnings."
General Motors,2017-1,"GM shares were up 3.8 percent at $37.38 in afternoon trading, after earlier hitting their highest level in almost two years. Ford shares rose 2 percent after GM's profit outlook announcement."
General Motors,2017-1,"Over the next three years, GM said that more profitable crossovers, trucks and SUVs that have dominated sales for several years due to lower gas prices, will ""increase significantly"" to 52 percent of GM sales volumes from 2017 to 2020, versus 38 percent over the previous six years."
General Motors,2017-1,The company also announced a $5-billion increase to its share buyback program and additional planned cost savings of $1 billion. The increase in GM's 2017 EPS will in part reflect the impact of the increased share repurchase program.
General Motors,2017-1,"GM executives said, by 2019 the company expects $2 billion in pre-tax profits from its financial arm, its parts business and its new mobility ventures including OnStar and Maven."
General Motors,2017-1,The company said it should generate about $6 billion in free cash flow in 2017.

General Motors,2017-1,"Last week, Ford scrapped plans to build the $1.6-billion Focus plant in Mexico and said it would invest $700 million in a factory in Michigan. [nL1N1ET0OD]"
General Motors,2017-1,"When asked about the company's plans for investments in Mexico, GM CEO Mary Barra said she could not comment, but emphasized a willingness to cooperate with the incoming Trump administration."
General Motors,2017-1,"""Make America Great Again"" was Trump's slogan during the 2016 U.S. general election campaign."
General Motors,2017-1,"DETROIT, Jan 10 (Reuters) - Automakers unveiled several new diesel models at the Detroit auto show this week, hoping to dispel the doubts created by Volkswagen's diesel emissions scandal and revive interest in a technology that offers benefits under fuel economy regulations."
General Motors,2017-1,"Ford Motor Co said it would offer a diesel version of its best-selling F-150 pickup truck for the first time in 40 years, while General Motors Co said Sunday it will offer a diesel version of its compact GMC Terrain SUV."
General Motors,2017-1,"Last year, GM announced it will start selling diesel versions of it Chevrolet Equinox and Chevrolet Cruze car, while in November Mazda Motor Co <7261.T> said it would start selling a diesel version of its 2017 CX-5 SUV in the United States later this year."
General Motors,2017-1,"Automakers are pushing diesels in part because they offer higher mileage and better performance, particularly for heavier vehicles, than gasoline engines. The fuel economy boost helps automakers comply with federal greenhouse gas limits. The improvements in towing and acceleration are attributes automakers believe they can sell."
General Motors,2017-1,"""I think we'd be very stupid to forego the benefits of diesel,"" Daimler AG chief executive Dieter Zetsche told reporters at the auto show."
General Motors,2017-1,"With their CO2 emissions 15 to 20 percent below equivalent gasoline engines, he said, diesels will ""continue to be very relevant"" to efforts to meet climate goals."
General Motors,2017-1,"In April, Daimler said the U.S. Justice Department had asked the carmaker to investigate its emissions certification process for vehicles including its Mercedes brand."
General Motors,2017-1,"Diesels account for a small fraction of U.S. sales, but more than half of all passenger vehicle sales in Europe. Diesel vehicles represented less than 1 percent of all light-duty vehicle sales in the United States last year, according to hybridcars.com."
General Motors,2017-1,"Overall diesel sales in the U.S. fell nearly 30 percent in the United States in 2016, as Volkswagen AG stopped selling diesel models in late 2015 after admitting it had rigged diesel engines to pass government emissions tests."
General Motors,2017-1,The company on Tuesday confirmed it is negotiating a settlement of a criminal investigation with the U.S. Justice Department and expects to pay $4.3 billion in penalties and plead guilty to criminal misconduct. [nFWN1F00YS]
General Motors,2017-1,VW brand chief Herbert Diess reiterated to reporters on Sunday night in Detroit the brand has no plans to resume sales of diesels. VW is focusing on gasoline-powered vehicles and electric vehicle offerings.
General Motors,2017-1,Diesels accounted for about a quarter of VW brand sales before the scandal erupted. VW U.S. brand sales were down nearly 8 percent in 2016.
General Motors,2017-1,"Regulatory problems have saddled diesel technology with ""an incredibly bad reputation"" and made the vehicles ""an incredibly undesirable product, although its usefulness is beyond doubt,"" Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV chief executive Sergio Marchionne said on the sidelines of the Detroit auto show, without referring to the VW scandal by name."
General Motors,2017-1,Marchionne said the automaker is spending 500 million euros to meet new European diesel emissions standards.
General Motors,2017-1,"""What's going to kill diesel is this continuous drain on capital and this continuous skepticism about its value to society,"" he said."
General Motors,2017-1,Diesel advocates were optimistic about the technology's future after the announcements.
General Motors,2017-1,"""These announcements send a strong message that diesel remains an important option for meeting the future vehicle needs of U.S. drivers,"" said Allen Schaeffer, the Executive Director of the Diesel Technology Forum."
General Motors,2017-1,"Diesels offer strong performance and good fuel economy, GM said, and the automaker is not having trouble getting its engines approved by federal regulators."
General Motors,2017-1,"""We're really good at it,"" said Mark Reuss, the automaker's executive vice president for product development. ""It's not a bet the farm thing, it's an option."""

General Motors,2017-1,"DETROIT, Jan 10 (Reuters) - Global automakers are reworking their product strategies and investments for the United States to bring more sport utility vehicles to showrooms amid a sharp turn away from small- and medium-sized cars, executives at Detroit's auto show say."
General Motors,2017-1,"Carmakers from Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T> to General Motors Co to Volkswagen AG are adding more SUVs to their product plans, amid forecasts that SUVs and pickup trucks could soon make up two-thirds of U.S. light vehicle sales, up from 56 percent in 2015 and just under 60 percent last year."
General Motors,2017-1,"""The shift to trucks is profound,"" said Mike Jackson, chief executive of AutoNation Inc , the largest U.S. auto dealership chain."
General Motors,2017-1,"Sedans are not only losing sales volume, but automakers and dealers are offering bigger discounts to move them out of showrooms, industry executives said. Profit margins on SUVs and trucks are fatter."
General Motors,2017-1,"The average incentive for a midsize car in September was 14.1 percent, according to Kelley Blue Book, compared with 7.4 percent for a midsize crossover."
General Motors,2017-1,"The shift has forced some automakers to slash production capacity dedicated just a few years ago to small cars, and put a new emphasis on designing vehicles and assembly plants that can switch quickly from building cars to SUVs."
General Motors,2017-1,"Volkswagen's Audi unit, for example, builds a small Q2 SUV and its A3 sedan on the same assembly line, Dietmar Voggenreiter, head of sales and marketing for Audi, said in an interview. ""We will always have an SUV and a sedan"" on the same production line, he said."
General Motors,2017-1,Automakers are bringing SUVs into segments that previously were only for cars.
General Motors,2017-1,"Case in point is Nissan Motor Co's <7201.T> Rogue Sport, revealed on Monday at the North American International Auto Show, an Americanized version of the small Qashqai SUV Nissan has sold for several years in Europe and Asia."
General Motors,2017-1,"""The increasing shift of cars to crossovers finally drove our decision to bring this car to the U.S.,"" said Michael Bunce, vice president of product strategy for Nissan's U.S. arm."
General Motors,2017-1,"The Rogue Sport will be sold alongside the slightly larger Rogue, appealing to consumers who previously would have had only small cars to choose from."
General Motors,2017-1,"The cars to SUV shift is hitting luxury brands, as well."
General Motors,2017-1,"At German luxury automaker BMW last year, about 43 percent of U.S. sales were SUVs. In December, that percentage neared 50, said Ian Robertson, the German luxury brand's global sales chief."
General Motors,2017-1,"""I think that tells you where the trend is in the U.S., probably on a 50-50 level,"" Robertson told Reuters."
General Motors,2017-1,"At Toyota Motor Co <7203.T>, SUVs and trucks will account for about 63 percent of U.S. sales in 2017, said North America CEO Jim Lentz, predicting its RAV4 SUV could top the Camry this year as its best-selling U.S. vehicle."
General Motors,2017-1,"Honda Motor Co <7267.T> is working to expand production of SUVs for the U.S. market, shifting production of the Acura MDX sport utility to a factory in Ohio to make room for additional production of higher volume Pilot SUVs and Ridgeline pickup trucks, Chief Executive Takahiro Hachigo said."
General Motors,2017-1,"Cheap gasoline is emboldening some automakers to add more SUVs based on body-on-frame pickup truck designs - after years of shifting SUVs to lighter, car-like unitized body construction."
General Motors,2017-1,Ford Motor Co is reviving its Bronco SUV. It was last built in 1996 after gaining notoriety as the vehicle used during O.J. Simpson's police pursuit. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV on Sunday outlined plans to bring back a body on frame SUV for its Jeep line.

General Motors,2017-1,"DETROIT, Jan 9 (Reuters) - General Motors Co Chief Executive Mary Barra says often that the auto industry will change more during the next decade than it has in the past half-century, as she highlights how GM will keep up."
General Motors,2017-1,"In 2016, it has invested nearly $1 billion to buy a self-driving car technology startup, Cruise Automation; invested $500 million into ride services company Lyft; launched a new car-sharing brand, Maven, and a new electric car, the Chevrolet Bolt."
General Motors,2017-1,The automaker is also expanding the array of services available via the high-speed mobile internet connections embedded in millions of GM vehicles.
General Motors,2017-1,"None of those high-profile moves, however, are likely to have much near-term impact on the No. 1 U.S. automaker's bottom line."
General Motors,2017-1,"For now and for years to come, GM will make money the way it did 60 years ago: By selling large vehicles built on steel frames, with V8 engines driving the rear wheels. In 1957, that technology was sold as a Chevy Bel Air. Today, it is packaged as a Chevrolet Silverado pickup truck or a Cadillac Escalade SUV."
General Motors,2017-1,"The company makes more than 90 percent of its profits, before interest and taxes, in its North American auto operations. The bulk of those profits come from sales of trucks and SUVs, analysts and company executives said."
General Motors,2017-1,"""That business model has worked and continues to work,"" GM President Dan Ammann told Reuters. ""We believe that model will keep going, particularly in places where we are strongest, for a long time."""
General Motors,2017-1,"GM is pursuing a two-pronged strategy, aimed at the increasingly divergent segments of its home market."
General Motors,2017-1,"In big cities along the coasts, GM is widening its efforts to capture urban consumers who are shifting away from traditional vehicle ownership and some day may get around by summoning self-driving cars with a smartphone."
General Motors,2017-1,"""We're at the very infancy of that,"" Ammann said."
General Motors,2017-1,"Ride sharing today accounts for less than 1 percent of all miles traveled in the United States. But if buying rides by the mile takes off, it could be a ""significant"" opportunity, he said."
General Motors,2017-1,"Earlier this week, GM's Cadillac luxury division launched in New York what it said was the industry's first service allowing customers to pay a monthly fee to drive any of the brand's models."
General Motors,2017-1,GM is investing billions in U.S. factories to expand production of large trucks and SUVs.
General Motors,2017-1,"Defending the V8 truck franchise is critical to GM. More than 90 percent of GM's pickup trucks are sold with V8 engines, said Dan Nicholson, head of the company's propulsion systems engineering operations."
General Motors,2017-1,"As of now, he said, GM does not have a V8 that can comply with the 2025 emissions standards - put in place by the outgoing Obama administration - without turning off customers who like the trucks as the are."
General Motors,2017-1,"The Alliance for Automobile Manufacturers, which includes GM, is lobbying the incoming Trump administration to revise those standards."
General Motors,2017-1,"GM is meanwhile working on improving the fuel efficiency of its V8 engines, Nicholson said, but current fuel economy rules could force the company to limit availability and raise the price of trucks equipped with the larger engines."
General Motors,2017-1,"Rival Ford Motor Co, with its F-150 pickup, has already made the transition to V6 turbo engines - which now sell in larger volumes than its V8 trucks - along with aluminum body panels that reduce weight and boost fuel economy."
General Motors,2017-1,"GM's dual marketing strategies - one for the heartland, the other for the coasts - will be on display at the Detroit Auto Show this week."
General Motors,2017-1,"The automaker will feature new SUV models including a large Chevrolet Traverse and a revamped GMC Terrain compact SUV. On Chevrolet's show stand, the electric Bolt hatchback will be presented as one of the brand's family of SUVs, along with the hulking Chevrolet Suburban."
General Motors,2017-1,"At a scheduled Jan. 10 presentation, GM also will have a dual message for investors: Trucks make the money, and the investments in alternatives to that business are still modest and pose no threat to GM's promises of profitability."
General Motors,2017-1,"The automaker has assured investors it will boost pre-tax profit margins to 9 to 10 percent by early in the next decade, and buy back $9 billion worth shares for the period 2015-2017."
General Motors,2017-1,"The company's current results need no explanation, Amman told Reuters. ""It's a very strong performance,"" he said."
General Motors,2017-1,"For urban customers, and an increasing number of younger customers who are less interested in car ownership, GM is preparing alternatives at a measured pace."
General Motors,2017-1,"The electric Bolt illustrates GM's approach. Tesla Motors Inc Chief Executive Elon Musk has said he intends to build 500,000 of his planned Model 3 electric sedans annually by 2020. That would be about six times the number of battery electric cars sold in the U.S. last year, based on data from the Electric Drive Transportation Association, a trade group."
General Motors,2017-1,"Suppliers have said that GM, by contrast, plans to build about 20,000 to 30,000 of its Chevrolet Bolt electric vehicles annually. Many are expected to serve in Lyft ride hailing fleets."
General Motors,2017-1,"GM officials have not said how many Bolts the company will build. But Mike Abelson, GM's vice president for strategy and global portfolio planning, told Reuters that it will err on the side of building too few than too many to suit consumer demand."
General Motors,2017-1,"""We'd rather have the problem of working fast to increase volume"" than building too many cars that languish on dealer lots, he said."
General Motors,2017-1,"Coastal dwellers buy a relatively small share of the gasoline-powered vehicles GM sells in the U.S. The automaker's market share in California is just 9.9 percent, compared to about 17 percent in the nation as a whole, according to IHS Markit data."

General Motors,2017-1,Q&A-What does Trump's 'big border tax' threat really mean? - Reuters News
General Motors,2017-1,"{{20170109T223559.721+0000}}Q&A-What does Trump's 'big border tax' threat really mean?WASHINGTON, Jan 9 (Reuters) - In a series of tweets, President-elect Donald Trump has recently threatened several companies with ""big border tax"" if they expand manufacturing facilities abroad for products to be sold into the United States, but he has provided few details."
General Motors,2017-1,"Whether he is talking about a tax or a tariff is unclear, experts said, reacting to Trump's terse warnings to United Technologies Corp , General Motors Co , Ford Motor Co and Japan's Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T>."
General Motors,2017-1,Trump has said U.S. companies that shut manufacturing plants and lay off workers only to open new facilities abroad would pay a 35 percent tax or tariff on products they ship back to the U.S. market.
General Motors,2017-1,"Asked about the issue on a conference call with reporters on Monday, Trump transition team spokesman Sean Spicer said the president-elect had been focused on U.S.-based employers that ""move overseas for the express purpose of selling back to the U.S. market with non-U.S. workers. ... That continues to stand."""
General Motors,2017-1,A. No. Congress writes the tax laws and the revenue-raising power of the federal government is held primarily by the House of Representatives under the Constitution. Tax laws are enforced by the Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service.
General Motors,2017-1,"A. Perhaps, but he would likely face a legal challenge. Like taxes, tariffs are also revenue-raising measures."
General Motors,2017-1,"New York University School of Law tax professor Daniel Shaviro said the president's power to impose tariffs on his own was ""highly contested. ... Targeting one particular company would certainly add to the legal, as well as the policy concerns."""
General Motors,2017-1,"Shaviro said selective tariffs on individual companies, including foreign-based ones, would likely draw a challenge through the World Trade Organization and trigger retaliation."
General Motors,2017-1,"Brooklyn Law School professor Rebecca Kysar wrote in an op-ed last week in the New York Times that Trump was floating the idea of a 5 to 10 percent imports tariff imposed by executive action. She said that would be unconstitutional, citing the origination clause that vests revenue-raising power in Congress."
General Motors,2017-1,"A. Some experts said Trump's tweets might mean he supports an unprecedented export-boosting approach to corporate taxation that is being proposed by Republicans in the House of Representatives, including House Speaker Paul Ryan."
General Motors,2017-1,"Known as border adjustability, the approach is intended to help U.S. manufacturers by favoring exports over imports. As laid out in Ryan's ""Better Way"" agenda, companies would pay no tax on revenues from exports and would be unable to deduct the cost of imports from their taxable income."
General Motors,2017-1,"Advocates said if that approach became law, it would attract investment to the United States, provide incentives to manufacturers to maintain or expand their U.S. facilities, and dissuade companies from leaving the country. But some tax experts are skeptical it will be approved by Congress."
General Motors,2017-1,Q: Are Trump's tweets in line with the border adjustability plan?
General Motors,2017-1,"A. Not exactly. His comments have stirred anxiety in business circles about the possibility of a special penalty tax on U.S. companies that send jobs overseas. By contrast, the House Republican proposal would treat all imported products equally, whether produced by U.S. or foreign-owned companies."
General Motors,2017-1,Q: Where does Trump get the 35 percent figure he cites for the tax or tariff he has warned U.S. companies that shut manufacturing plants only to open new facilities abroad will pay on products they ship back to the U.S. market.
General Motors,2017-1,"A. That is not clear either. Experts said the president-elect may be referring in his tweets to the current 35 percent U.S. corporate income tax rate. That would also differ from the House Republican plan, which would impose a 20 percent tax on imports."
General Motors,2017-1,"While some experts said Trump could follow the House Republican approach and subject all imports to a lower tax rate, others said Trump had indicated an interest in using different tax rates to penalize or reward certain business behaviors."
General Motors,2017-1,"For example, a tax reform plan released by Trump in September called for cutting the corporate tax rate to 15 percent but added a potentially important caveat: ""This rate is available to all businesses, both small and large, that want to retain the profits within the business."""
General Motors,2017-1,"A. Trump himself could offer more details at any time, including at a news conference scheduled for Wednesday. Some expect House Republicans to unveil initial tax reform legislation by the end of February. That timetable could slip as Republicans and their staff discuss sweeping reforms with the Trump transition team, analysts said."

General Motors,2017-1,"{{20170109T223406.500+0000}}FACTBOX-Automakers reveal new models at the Detroit auto show(Adds more models, details)"
General Motors,2017-1,"Jan 9 (Reuters) - Global automakers kicked off 2017 displaying a wide array of future vehicles at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit. Luxury sedans and small sport utility vehicles jostled for the spotlight along with electric cars and diesel-powered pickup trucks. When it came to industry profits, the trucks and SUVs were at center-stage."
General Motors,2017-1,"Here are some of the notable vehicle debuts at the Detroit show, which opens to the public on Saturday, January 14."
General Motors,2017-1,"* Nissan Rogue Sport. A 5-passenger SUV that will be slightly smaller than the Nissan <7201.T> Rogue, which has become the top-selling model in the company's U.S. lineup. Rogue was the top-selling non-pickup truck in the U.S. in December. It will go on sale in the spring. This is part of Nissan's response to U.S. consumers' growing preference for SUVs of all sizes."
General Motors,2017-1,* Kia Motors Co <000270.KS> Stinger. The Stinger is a new 5-passenger fastback sport sedan. Kia said it would produce the Stinger after showing a concept version of it earlier. The car was designed in Frankfurt. It will go on sale in the U.S. market in late 2017.
General Motors,2017-1,"* Lexus LS. Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T> debuted the first Lexus LS 400 sedan in Detroit at the 1989 auto show. On Monday, the brand unveiled the fifth generation of its big sedan to a market that is turning away from the traditional concept that a luxury brand's ""flagship"" model must be a sedan, instead of a sport utility vehicle. The brand also is showing a compact crossover concept called UX."
General Motors,2017-1,"* BMW 5-series. BMW AG has already taken the wraps off the look of the new 5-series, which competes with the Mercedes E-class and Audi A6. The German luxury automaker displayed a plug-in hybrid version of the car for the first time in Detroit. Like its competitors, the 5-series is losing ground to SUVs - and the Tesla Model S electric sedan - among affluent U.S. buyers. BMW also is showing a compact X2 crossover concept."
General Motors,2017-1,"* Honda Odyssey. Just in time for millennials starting to have the baby boom generation's grandchildren, Honda Motor Co <7267.T> debuted a new generation of its Odyssey minivan. The minivan segment has shrunk since the former Chrysler Corp pioneered the concept of a boxy family hauler in the 1980s, but sales in the segment rose 8 percent last year."
General Motors,2017-1,"* Ford F-150. Ford Motor Co will give the 2018 model of the best-selling vehicle in the United States some modest appearance changes, and more significantly, new technology to reduce fuel consumption. For the first time, Ford will offer a diesel engine option in the F-150. The company is not releasing fuel economy estimates for that engine. A new 3.3-liter six-cylinder engine will also be offered and fuel-saving technology that shuts down the engine at a stop light will be available."
General Motors,2017-1,"* Chevrolet Traverse. General Motors Co highlighted two redesigned sport utility vehicles in Detroit, including a new generation of the Chevrolet Traverse, a family hauling SUV that will compete with the likes of the Ford Explorer, Honda Pilot, Toyota Highlander and Jeep Grand Cherokee."
General Motors,2017-1,"* Toyota Camry. The best-selling passenger car in the United States for the past 15 years got a major makeover. Camry sales fell 9.5 percent in 2016 from the year before, reflecting pressure from the shift to SUVs. Overall, mid-sized sedan sales in the United States fell 10 percent. Toyota <7203.T> has been giving its mainstream models more expressive styling and advanced technology, to counter a long-held image for dull reliability. The 2018 Camry is expected to reflect that direction."
General Motors,2017-1,"* Mercedes-Benz E Class Coupe. Daimler AG's mainstream brand has redesigned its mid-size E Class Coupe. It also showed a facelifted version of the GLA compact crossover, as well as a redesigned Smart Electric Drive."
General Motors,2017-1,"* Audi Q8. Audi, the high-volume luxury brand of Volkswagen AG showed a concept of a new, large sport utility vehicle in Detroit. It is also unveiling a facelifted version of its SQ5 mid-size SUV and redesigned A5 cabriolet."
General Motors,2017-1,"* Volkswagen Tiguan. The mid-size Tiguan crossover utility vehicle has been redesigned. VW is also displaying yet another revival of its classic Microbus, this time as a battery-powered electric concept called I.D. Buzz."
General Motors,2017-1,* Infiniti QX50. Nissan's luxury brand is showing a concept version of its redesigned QX50 mid-size SUV.
General Motors,2017-1,"* GMC Terrain. The brand's compact SUV gets its first major redesign, sharing major components with the redesigned Chevrolet Equinox."

General Motors,2017-1,"Fiat Chrysler Automobiles Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne said on Monday that uncertainty over Trump's trade and tax policies could lead automakers to delay investments in Mexico, and he confirmed plans to create 2,000 jobs at Fiat Chrysler's U.S. factories."
General Motors,2017-1,"""The reality is the Mexican automotive industry has now for a number of years been tooled-up to try and deal with the U.S. market.

General Motors,2017-1,"FCA announced on Sunday it would spend $1 billion to retool factories in Ohio and Michigan to build new Jeep sport utility vehicles, as well as a pickup truck, and potentially move production of a Ram heavy-duty pickup truck to Michigan from Mexico."
General Motors,2017-1,"On Monday, Ford confirmed it would build a new Ranger pickup and a new SUV under the storied Bronco name at a Michigan factory that currently builds Focus small cars.

General Motors,2017-1,"Last week, Ford scrapped plans to build the $1.6-billion Focus plant in Mexico and said it would invest $700 million in a factory in Michigan. [nL1N1ET0OD]"
General Motors,2017-1,"Executives at Ford, Fiat Chrysler and other automakers said during interviews at the auto show their investment decisions were driven by business considerations, not Trump's comments."
General Motors,2017-1,"Most major automakers in the U.S. market have substantial vehicle-making operations in Mexico, as well as complex networks of parts makers that supply their factories in the United States and support jobs and investment in states such as Ohio and Michigan."
General Motors,2017-1,Trump praised Ford and Fiat Chrysler's latest announcements on his Twitter account on Monday.
General Motors,2017-1,"""It's finally happening - Fiat Chrysler just announced plans to invest $1BILLION in Michigan and Ohio plants, adding 2000 jobs,"" Trump said in a tweet. In a follow-up tweet, he added: ""Ford said last week that it will expand in Michigan and U.S. instead of building a BILLION dollar plant in Mexico. Thank you Ford & Fiat C(hrysler)."" [nL1N1EZ0NU]"
General Motors,2017-1,"Honda <7267.T> will build a new hybrid model that does not have a gasoline counterpart in its lineup. The hybrid will be made in the United States in 2018 at an existing plant, and Honda said it would boost investment at its transmission plant in Georgia."

General Motors,2017-1,"FCA's Marchionne said Monday his company's decision to invest in expanded truck production in the United States ""was in the works and has been in the works for a long period of time."""
General Motors,2017-1,"Marchionne wanted to get out the news about adding jobs and investment in the United States in case the company encountered more criticism from Trump, a person familiar with the situation said on Sunday."
General Motors,2017-1,"Marchionne said he has not made a decision on whether to move production of certain Ram heavy-duty pickups from Mexico to the United States, in part because of uncertainty about tariffs."
General Motors,2017-1,"""There's no commitment to move the heavy-duty. If tomorrow morning President-elect Trump decides to impose a border tax on anything that comes up from Mexico, then we'll have to adjust."""
General Motors,2017-1,"Also on Monday, Toyota's Lentz warned that a ""border adjustability tax,"" could add $1,000 to the cost of a Kentucky-built Camry sedan, because it has foreign-made parts."
General Motors,2017-1,"Ford Motor Co Chairman Bill Ford Jr and GM Chief Executive Mary Barra have, separately, spoken with Trump in recent days."
General Motors,2017-1,"Ford said he has been ""in relatively frequent contact with him."" He said he was encouraged that overhauling the corporate tax code was high on Trump's agenda."
General Motors,2017-1,"Barra on Sunday said tax reform and ""streamlining regulations ... are just two areas that would be extremely beneficial"" for Trump to address."

General Motors,2017-1,"In 2016, it has invested nearly $1 billion to buy a self-driving car technology startup, Cruise Automation; invested $500 million into ride services company Lyft; launched a new car-sharing brand, Maven, and a new electric car, the Chevrolet Bolt."
General Motors,2017-1,The automaker is also expanding the array of services available via the high-speed mobile internet connections embedded in millions of GM vehicles.
General Motors,2017-1,"None of those high-profile moves, however, are likely to have much near-term impact on the No. 1 U.S. automaker's bottom line."
General Motors,2017-1,"For now and for years to come, GM will make money the way it did 60 years ago: By selling large vehicles built on steel frames, with V8 engines driving the rear wheels. In 1957, that technology was sold as a Chevy Bel Air. Today, it is packaged as a Chevrolet Silverado pickup truck or a Cadillac Escalade SUV."
General Motors,2017-1,"The company makes more than 90 percent of its profits, before interest and taxes, in its North American auto operations. The bulk of those profits come from sales of trucks and SUVs, analysts and company executives said."
General Motors,2017-1,"""That business model has worked and continues to work,"" GM President Dan Ammann told Reuters. ""We believe that model will keep going, particularly in places where we are strongest, for a long time."""
General Motors,2017-1,"GM is pursuing a two-pronged strategy, aimed at the increasingly divergent segments of its home market."
General Motors,2017-1,"In big cities along the coasts, GM is widening its efforts to capture urban consumers who are shifting away from traditional vehicle ownership and some day may get around by summoning self-driving cars with a smartphone."
General Motors,2017-1,"""We're at the very infancy of that,"" Ammann said."
General Motors,2017-1,"Ride sharing today accounts for less than 1 percent of all miles traveled in the United States. But if buying rides by the mile takes off, it could be a ""significant"" opportunity, he said."
General Motors,2017-1,"Earlier this week, GM's Cadillac luxury division launched in New York what it said was the industry's first service allowing customers to pay a monthly fee to drive any of the brand's models."
General Motors,2017-1,GM is investing billions in U.S. factories to expand production of large trucks and SUVs.
General Motors,2017-1,"Defending the V8 truck franchise is critical to GM. More than 90 percent of GM's pickup trucks are sold with V8 engines, said Dan Nicholson, head of the company's propulsion systems engineering operations."
General Motors,2017-1,"As of now, he said, GM does not have a V8 that can comply with the 2025 emissions standards - put in place by the outgoing Obama administration - without turning off customers who like the trucks as the are."
General Motors,2017-1,"The Alliance for Automobile Manufacturers, which includes GM, is lobbying the incoming Trump administration to revise those standards."
General Motors,2017-1,"GM is meanwhile working on improving the fuel efficiency of its V8 engines, Nicholson said, but current fuel economy rules could force the company to limit availability and raise the price of trucks equipped with the larger engines."
General Motors,2017-1,"Rival Ford Motor Co, with its F-150 pickup, has already made the transition to V6 turbo engines - which now sell in larger volumes than its V8 trucks - along with aluminum body panels that reduce weight and boost fuel economy."
General Motors,2017-1,"GM's dual marketing strategies - one for the heartland, the other for the coasts - will be on display at the Detroit Auto Show this week."
General Motors,2017-1,"The automaker will feature new SUV models including a large Chevrolet Traverse and a revamped GMC Terrain compact SUV. On Chevrolet's show stand, the electric Bolt hatchback will be presented as one of the brand's family of SUVs, along with the hulking Chevrolet Suburban."
General Motors,2017-1,"At a scheduled Jan. 10 presentation, GM also will have a dual message for investors: Trucks make the money, and the investments in alternatives to that business are still modest and pose no threat to GM's promises of profitability."
General Motors,2017-1,"The automaker has assured investors it will boost pre-tax profit margins to 9 to 10 percent by early in the next decade, and buy back $9 billion worth shares for the period 2015-2017."
General Motors,2017-1,"The company's current results need no explanation, Amman told Reuters. ""It's a very strong performance,"" he said."
General Motors,2017-1,"For urban customers, and an increasing number of younger customers who are less interested in car ownership, GM is preparing alternatives at a measured pace."
General Motors,2017-1,"The electric Bolt illustrates GM's approach. Tesla Motors Inc Chief Executive Elon Musk has said he intends to build 500,000 of his planned Model 3 electric sedans annually by 2020. That would be about six times the number of battery electric cars sold in the U.S. last year, based on data from the Electric Drive Transportation Association, a trade group."
General Motors,2017-1,"Suppliers have said that GM, by contrast, plans to build about 20,000 to 30,000 of its Chevrolet Bolt electric vehicles annually. Many are expected to serve in Lyft ride hailing fleets."
General Motors,2017-1,"GM officials have not said how many Bolts the company will build. But Mike Abelson, GM's vice president for strategy and global portfolio planning, told Reuters that it will err on the side of building too few than too many to suit consumer demand."
General Motors,2017-1,"""We'd rather have the problem of working fast to increase volume"" than building too many cars that languish on dealer lots, he said."
General Motors,2017-1,"Coastal dwellers buy a relatively small share of the gasoline-powered vehicles GM sells in the U.S. The automaker's market share in California is just 9.9 percent, compared to about 17 percent in the nation as a whole, according to IHS Markit data."
General Motors,2017-1,"""We're 10 percent in San Francisco. In New York, we're below 7 percent,"" said Julia Steyn, head of GM's new Maven ride services unit."
General Motors,2017-1,Maven is offering short-term loans of GM vehicles in a growing number of cities where GM's market share is below the nationwide average.
General Motors,2017-1,"Compare GM's California market share to the 27.4 share, according to IHS Markit, that GM enjoys in Indiana, where people buy four-door Silverado pickups as family transportation."
General Motors,2017-1,"Maven has about 8,000 vehicles in its fleet. GM sells more than eight times that many vehicles in a month."
General Motors,2017-1,Asked when Maven will be a significant contributor to GM's revenues - currently more than $150 billion a year - Steyn laughed.

General Motors,2017-1,"Jan 8 (Reuters) - Global automakers will kick off 2017 by displaying a wide array of future vehicles at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit. This year, luxury sedans and small sport utility vehicles will jostle for the spotlight along with electric cars and diesel-powered pickup trucks. When it comes to industry profits, the trucks and SUVs will be at center-stage."
General Motors,2017-1,"Here are some of the notable vehicle debuts expected at the Detroit show, which opens to the public on Saturday, January 14."
General Motors,2017-1,"* Nissan Rogue Sport. A 5-passenger SUV that will be slightly smaller than the Nissan Rogue, which has become the top-selling model in the company's U.S. lineup. Rogue was the top-selling non-pickup truck in the U.S. in December. It will go on sale in the spring. This is part of Nissan's response to U.S. consumers' growing preference for SUVs of all sizes."
General Motors,2017-1,* Kia Motors Co <000270.KS> Stinger. The Stinger is a new 5-passenger fastback sport sedan. Kia said it will produce the Stinger after showing a concept version of it earlier. The car was designed in Frankfurt. It will go on sale in the U.S. market in late 2017.
General Motors,2017-1,"* Lexus LS. Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T> debuted the first Lexus LS 400 sedan in Detroit at the 1989 auto show. On Monday, the brand will unveil the fifth generation of its big sedan to a market that is turning away from the traditional concept that a luxury brand's ""flagship"" model must be a sedan, instead of a sport utility vehicle."
General Motors,2017-1,"* BMW 5-series. BMW AG has already taken the wraps off the look of the new 5-series, which competes with the Mercedes E-class and Audi A6. The German luxury automaker plans to display a plug-in hybrid version of the car for the first time in Detroit. Like its competitors, the 5-series is losing ground to SUVs - and the Tesla Model S electric sedan - among affluent U.S. buyers."
General Motors,2017-1,"* Honda Odyssey. Just in time for millennials starting to have the baby boom generation's grandchildren, Honda Motor Co <7267.T> is expected to debut in Detroit a new generation of its Odyssey minivan. The minivan segment has shrunk since the former Chrysler Corp pioneered the concept of a boxy family hauler in the 1980s, but sales in the segment rose 8 percent last year."
General Motors,2017-1,"* Ford F-150. Ford Motor Co will give the 2018 model of the best-selling vehicle in the United States some modest appearance changes, and more significantly, new technology to reduce fuel consumption. For the first time, Ford will offer a diesel engine option in the F-150. The company is not releasing fuel economy estimates for that engine. A new 3.3-liter six-cylinder engine will also be offered and fuel-saving technology that shuts down the engine at a stop light will be available."
General Motors,2017-1,"* Chevrolet Traverse. General Motors Co is highlighting two redesigned sport utility vehicles in Detroit, including a new generation of the Chevrolet Traverse, a family hauling SUV that will compete with the likes of the Ford Explorer, Honda Pilot, Toyota Highlander and Jeep Grand Cherokee."
General Motors,2017-1,"* Toyota Camry. The best-selling passenger car in the United States for the past 15 years gets a major makeover. Camry sales fell 9.5 percent in 2016 from the year before, reflecting pressure from the shift to SUVs. Overall, mid-sized sedan sales in the United States fell 10 percent. Toyota has been giving its mainstream models more expressive styling and advanced technology, to counter a long-held image for dull reliability. The 2018 Camry is expected to reflect that direction."
General Motors,2017-1,"* Audi SUV. Analysts expect Audi, the high-volume luxury brand of Volkswagen AG , to show a new, large sport utility vehicle in Detroit. The mainstream Volkswagen brand, meanwhile, is expected to highlight a new generation of its compact Tiguan sport utility."
General Motors,2017-1,* Nissan. Analysts expect Nissan Motor Co <7201.T> 's luxury brand Infiniti to show a redesigned QX50 compact SUV.

Some of the companies have seen volatile price spikes in their shares after the tweets.
General Motors,2017-1,"Toyota Motor Corp: Trump, who campaigned on promises to keep manufacturing business in the United States, tweeted that he would impose a fee if the Japanese automaker built its Corolla cars for the U.S. market in Mexico.

The stock has given back some of the gains and is now up 4.4 percent since Tuesday."
General Motors,2017-1,"Lockheed Martin Corp : Trump on Dec. 12 tweeted about the U.S. defense company's F-35 fighter jet program, calling it ""out of control.""

General Motors,2017-1,{{20170106T191154.952+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-Carmakers rattled by Backseat-Driver-in-Chief(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.)
General Motors,2017-1,"NEW YORK, Jan 6 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Carmakers are getting rattled by the Backseat-Driver-in-Chief. President-elect Donald Trump's attacks on General Motors and Toyota <6201.T> over imports have soured the industry's mood ahead of its big annual Detroit jamboree next week. They also have revived fears of rising costs just as a slowing market and autonomous driving jolt financial prospects."
General Motors,2017-1,"By some metrics, automakers are humming along nicely. U.S. sales hit a record high of 17.55 million last year. And the share prices of most of the major manufacturers have increased by as much as a fifth since Nov. 7, the day before American voters picked Trump to steer the country."
General Motors,2017-1,"The probability of lower U.S. corporate tax rates has helped power the market improvement. Revenue at Ford Motor , General Motors and Fiat Chrysler is expected to be virtually flat between now and 2019, according to estimates culled by Thomson Reuters. Only Honda <7267.T>, Nissan <7201.T> and Renault might grow the top line at double-digit rates."
General Motors,2017-1,"Even that may be optimistic, however. In the United States, the most profitable market, car resale values have been falling. Rising interest rates will make borrowing more expensive. And manufacturers already have been offering, at 12.2 percent of the average purchase price, the highest incentives since the financial crisis to entice customers, according to Barclays."
General Motors,2017-1,"Virtually all carmakers are jacking up their R&D spending to make vehicles more fuel efficient, connected and autonomous. The industry is rife with tech-related investments, partnerships and joint ventures. There's little to show for the capital allocation so far. The first pilot program for driverless taxis, for example, is run in Pittsburgh by ride-hailing upstart Uber using Volvos."
General Motors,2017-1,"While Trump's Twitterventions are unsettling, they may also help a bit. Scrapping a new plant in Mexico allows Ford not just to appease the next commander-in-chief but also its shareholders. The decision should cut costs allocated to build the Focus, a low-margin small car whose sales declined almost 17 percent last year."
General Motors,2017-1,"The bigger hazard would be tariffs and tax breaks imposed by Trump and the Republican-led Congress, which render much of the industry's Mexico operations unprofitable. Higher costs and damaged sales could require the movement of some production back north of the border. The last thing the auto industry needs is another big obstacle in the road."
General Motors,2017-1,- The North American International Auto Show in Detroit opens to members of the press on Jan. 8 and to the general public on Jan. 14. The event runs to Jan. 22.

General Motors,2017-1,"NEW DELHI, Jan 6 (Reuters) - A subsidiary of China's top carmaker SAIC Motor Corp <600104.SS> plans to acquire certain General Motors manufacturing assets in India, a filing with the country's competition watchdog showed on Friday."
General Motors,2017-1,"The assets, which could give the Chinese automaker a toehold in the Indian car market, will be acquired via an Indian subsidiary of SAIC that is yet to be incorporated, according to the filing with the Competition Commission of India."
General Motors,2017-1,"As part of a side deal, General Motors also plans to buy out SAIC's 9.2 percent stake in SAIC General Motors Investment - a joint venture it formed with the Chinese automaker in 2009 to expand its presence in emerging markets like India, a separate filing showed."
General Motors,2017-1,"GM, in an emailed response to a Reuters query following the filing, said discussions with SAIC on the sale of Halol - its plant in the Western state of Gujarat - were progressing well and that the two parties were working to secure necessary approvals."
General Motors,2017-1,"""We'll share any progress at the appropriate time,"" GM said."
General Motors,2017-1,"It was not immediately clear whether the two deals are being structured as some sort of asset swap, or whether there would be payments made by both parties for the assets. A spokeswoman for SAIC declined to comment."
General Motors,2017-1,Sources familiar with the matter had told Reuters last April that the Chinese carmaker was in discussions to buy GM's Gujarat plant and had been evaluating car models to launch in India. [nL3N16U43O]
General Motors,2017-1,"GM said in 2015 that it planned to stop production at one of its two plants in India by mid-2016 and consolidate operations at one location. The Detroit carmaker's Halol plant can manufacture up to 110,000 vehicles a year. GM also runs a plant in Talegaon in the western state of Maharashtra that has a capacity of about 170,000 vehicles a year."
General Motors,2017-1,"Several foreign carmakers like GM, Volkswagen AG and Ford Motor have struggled to ramp up sales in India, expected to be the world's third-largest car market by 2020, and are now pushing exports from the country to utilize idle manufacturing capacity."

General Motors,2017-1,"Trump's bully pulpit, both online and at rallies, can certainly be effective. General Motors, Lockheed Martin and Boeing have all scrambled to respond. This week Ford ditched a plan to build a new plant in Mexico that Trump had slated."
General Motors,2017-1,"In Toyota's case, a 35 percent import tax on 200,000 Corollas built annually at its new plant in Mexico would add $1.4 billion to their overall cost, assuming a $20,000 sticker price per car. That's around 10 percent of this year's expected earnings, which either Toyota or customers would have to swallow."
General Motors,2017-1,"That's never going to happen, though, for one very simple reason: Toyota's new plant would replace one in Canada, not America. All Corolla production for U.S. sales remains in the company's Mississippi factory. The plant is also in Guanajuato, not Baja, as Trump asserted."
General Motors,2017-1,Getting such basic facts wrong might not bother Trump's supporters. But shareholders are more likely to get wise to such antics and start focusing on more concrete issues.
General Motors,2017-1,"Contrast Toyota with Constellation Brands , the $30 billion alcoholic drinks firm. Its shares dropped more than 7 percent on Thursday, despite strong earnings. The maker of Corona and other Mexican brews faces higher costs if tax breaks are scrapped for overseas costs. That's a central tenet of tax reforms sought by congressional Republicans and Trump. And these would be easier to put in place than long-term cross-border tariffs, which break trade agreements."
General Motors,2017-1,"None of this means Trump's ability to micromanage via social-media bullying is over. But the more his punches fall wide of the mark, the more inclined investors will be to ignore him."
General Motors,2017-1,"- President-elect Donald Trump on Jan. 5 attacked Toyota Motor Corp on Twitter over its potential plan to build a car plant in Mexico. Trump tweeted: ""Toyota Motor said will build a new plant in Baja, Mexico, to build Corolla cars for U.S. NO WAY! Build plant in U.S. or pay big border tax."""
General Motors,2017-1,"- The Japanese carmaker is in fact building a new plant in Guanajuato, not Baja, to build up to 200,000 Corollas a year once it goes online in 2019. Production will be shifted there from a plant in Canada, not the United States."
General Motors,2017-1,"- Currently Toyota makes all Corollas it sells in the United States at its plant in Mississippi. It makes 1.3 million vehicles a year in America. Last year Toyota sent around 47,000 Mexico-made cars to sell north of the border."
General Motors,2017-1,"- Toyota, in a statement to Reuters, said it ""looks forward to collaborating with the Trump administration to serve in the best interests of consumers and the automotive industry."""
General Motors,2017-1,"- By early afternoon in Tokyo on Jan. 6, Toyota shares stood 2 percent lower at 6,905 yen."
General Motors,2017-1,"- Shares of Constellation Brands fell more than 7 percent on Jan. 5 even though the wine, beer and spirits-maker beat earnings and increased its outlook for the year. Investors were concerned about the effect on its Mexico operations of U.S. tax reforms proposed by both Trump and the congressional Republican Party."

General Motors,2017-1,"Baja produces around 100,000 pickup trucks and truck beds annually. The Guanajuato plant will build Corollas and have an annual capacity of 200,000 when it comes online in 2019, shifting production of the small car from Canada."

General Motors,2017-1,"""We will consider our option as we see what policies the incoming president adopts,"" Toyoda said at an industry gathering in Tokyo on Thursday before Trump's tweet, when asked whether his company was considering any changes to a production plant the automaker was building in Mexico."
General Motors,2017-1,"Automakers in the United States have been slammed by Trump for building cars in lower-cost factories south of the border, which he said costs American jobs. Pressure to curb that production intensified this week after Ford Motor Co scrapped plans to build a $1.6 billion assembly plant in Mexico after Trump harshly criticized the investment. [nL1N1ET0V9]"
General Motors,2017-1,"Ford, however, still plans to shift production of small cars to Mexico from Michigan, even as it uses $700 million from the planned Mexico investment to expand its operations in Flat Rock, Michigan, and add 700 jobs."
General Motors,2017-1,"During the campaign, Trump criticized barriers to U.S. auto exports to Japan and said the U.S. government did not do enough to open the market to more American-made vehicles."

General Motors,2017-1,"Trump has also said General Motors Co could become subject to tariffs on Mexico-made cars for the U.S. market, and that he would like to renegotiate terms of the North American Free Trade Agreement signed with Canada and Mexico, or scrap it altogether."
General Motors,2017-1,"Trump criticized GM for importing Mexican-made versions of the Chevrolet Cruze, even as the automaker is laying off 1,200 workers in Ohio this month who assemble the car."

General Motors,2017-1,"{{20170105T165513.845+0000}}UPDATE 1-Political doubt dampens recovery hopes of Brazil auto sector(Adds details, forecasts)"
General Motors,2017-1,"SAO PAULO, Jan 5 (Reuters) - Brazil's auto sector has revised downwards its expectations for a rebound in vehicle sales this year to just 4 percent from the high single digits, the Anfavea automakers association said on Thursday, with political uncertainty and a recession still weighing on a market that saw sales slump 20 percent last year."
General Motors,2017-1,"Anfavea President Antonio Megale said that while production of vehicles in Brazil would jump by 11.9 percent this year to 2.4 million units, sales of new vehicles would only creep up 4 percent to 2.13 million units."
General Motors,2017-1,"Exports are forecast to climb 7 percent this year to 558,000 units, he said, helped by stronger sales to Colombia, Chile and Ecuador. A trade deal with Argentina helped boost exports last year by 25 percent."
General Motors,2017-1,"""We had a forecast for a much stronger number (for sales) but we have reduced it to 4 percent because of the economic situation and, principally, because of the political environment that we are facing,"" Megale told a news conference."
General Motors,2017-1,Megale had said late last year that he expected a sales increase for the industry as a whole this year in the high single digits.
General Motors,2017-1,"Yet corruption allegations implicating Brazilian President Michel Temer and his party are casting doubt on his ability to remain in office and causing cracks in his coalition, amid growing calls for early elections."
General Motors,2017-1,"That could destabilize a return to economic growth expected this year and derail Temer's agenda of restoring fiscal discipline, which has been welcomed by business leaders and foreign investors. [nL1N1EB0O9]"
General Motors,2017-1,The tepid rebound in auto sales this year comes after a painful 2016 as Brazil's worst recession in more than a century slashed demand for new vehicles.
General Motors,2017-1,"Anfavea said sales of newly produced cars in Brazil fell by 20.2 percent in 2016 to 2.05 million units, while production slumped 11.2 percent."
General Motors,2017-1,"In a sign of recovery, vehicle sales in December rose by 14.7 percent month on month, the association said."
General Motors,2017-1,"The recovery in sales is unlikely to spell a major return to hiring by the sector, Megale said, as the industry as a whole has about 50 percent idle capacity."
General Motors,2017-1,Anfavea's more modest growth forecast for this year was in line with a prediction by the car dealership association Fenabrave that sales would grow 2.3 percent in 2017.

General Motors,2017-1,"But after three years of increasing Canadian auto sales, Gomes does not expect another record in 2017 as manufacturers raise prices due to the comparative weakness of the Canadian dollar, which closed today at $1.3308, or 75.14 U.S. cents. [nL1N1EU1PK]"

General Motors,2017-1,* Trump also hits GM over making Chevrolet Cruze cars in Mexico
General Motors,2017-1,"FLAT ROCK, Mich./WASHINGTON, Jan 3 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co on Tuesday scrapped a planned Mexican car factory and added 700 jobs in Michigan following criticism by Donald Trump, as the U.S. president-elect turned his attention toward rival General Motors Co with the threat of a ""big border tax"" over compact cars made in Mexico."
General Motors,2017-1,"Ford CEO Mark Fields called the move ""a vote of confidence"" in Trump, but primarily a response to a decline in North American demand for small cars like those that would have been made at the Mexican plant. He said Ford would have made the same decision even if Trump had not been elected."
General Motors,2017-1,"Ford will cancel plans unveiled in April to spend $1.6 billion to build the new plant in San Luis Potosi, Mexico, a project Trump urged the automaker to abandon and called an ""absolute disgrace"" during the election campaign."
General Motors,2017-1,"The No. 2 U.S. automaker also said it would invest $700 million to expand the Flat Rock, Michigan factory and would make new electric, hybrid and autonomous vehicles there."
General Motors,2017-1,"Trump's efforts to browbeat the U.S. car industry show he may go further than other modern presidents to try to influence corporate decisions, especially those related to trade and investment."
General Motors,2017-1,"In a Twitter post hours before Ford's announcement, Trump wrote, ""General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across border. Make in U.S.A. or pay big border tax!"" GM, the largest U.S. automaker, said making some of the Cruze cars in the plant in Coahuila, Mexico was part of its strategy to serve global customers, not sell those vehicles in the United States."
General Motors,2017-1,"Trump's GM tweet was his latest broadside aimed at an American company over jobs, imports and costs even before he takes office on Jan. 20."
General Motors,2017-1,Mexico's government said it regrets Ford's decision and has ensured that the company will reimburse San Luis Potosi state for any costs associated with the investment.
General Motors,2017-1,"""Obviously, this isn't a good decision for us,"" said Mexico's economy minister, Ildefonso Guajardo. [nE1N1DI020]"
General Motors,2017-1,"Ford said it still will shift production from Michigan of its Focus compact car to an existing plant in Hermosillo, Mexico. Fields said he expects Michigan to give incentives for Ford's investment in Flat Rock."
General Motors,2017-1,"Ford spokeswoman Jennifer Flake said the automaker will save $500 million by not opening the new plant in the near term, but will have some undisclosed costs to retool the other Mexican plant to build the Focus."
General Motors,2017-1,Ford shares closed up about 3.8 percent. GM shares rose about 0.9 percent.
General Motors,2017-1,Top Ford executives personally notified Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence of their decision. Fields praised tax and regulatory proposals advocated by Trump and his fellow Republicans who control Congress.
General Motors,2017-1,"""Our view is that we see a more positive U.S. manufacturing business environment under President-elect Trump and the pro-growth policies and proposals that he's talking about, so this is a vote of confidence for President-elect Trump and some of the policies that they may be pursuing,"" Fields said."
General Motors,2017-1,"Union workers gathered at the Flat Rock factory cheered Fields' announcement. Hiring of the 700 new workers there will probably start in 2018 with the majority of it in 2020, Fields said."
General Motors,2017-1,Trump said during the presidential campaign that if elected he would not allow Ford to open the new plant in Mexico and would slap hefty tariffs on imported Ford vehicles. Trump also accused Mexico of sending criminals and rapists into the United States and vowed to build a border wall to combat illegal immigration.
General Motors,2017-1,"Since winning the Nov. 8 election, Trump has targeted a wide range of American companies also including United Technologies Inc , Boeing Co and Lockheed Martin Corp . Trump also has touted decisions by companies to keep some production in the United States, including United's Carrier unit in Indiana."
General Motors,2017-1,"Trump previously vowed to hit companies that shift production from America to other countries with a 35 percent tax on their exports into the United States. He also has denounced the North American Free Trade Agreement between the United States, Mexico and Canada."
General Motors,2017-1,Fields said there were no negotiations between Ford and the incoming president over canceling the Mexico plant or investing in Michigan.
General Motors,2017-1,"Ford will build a battery electric SUV with a 300-mile (482-km) driving range at the Michigan plant by 2020, and will launch production there by 2021 of a fully autonomous vehicle without a steering wheel or a brake pedal for use in ride services fleets. Ford also plans new hybrid versions of its F-150 pickup truck, Mustang and police vehicles by 2020."

General Motors,2017-1,"""There was no quid pro quo because there was no negotiation"" with Trump over the decision to cancel the plant, Fields said."
General Motors,2017-1,"Fields told reporters the decision related to the need to ""fully utilize capacity at existing facilities"" amid declining sales of small and medium sized cars such as the Focus and Fusion."

The company said the decision was influenced by Trump's policy goals such as lowering taxes and regulations but that there were no negotiations over the decision announced on Tuesday.

General Motors,2017-1,"NEW YORK, Jan 3 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Donald Trump is adding some attack-dog bite to his global-trade bark. The U.S. president-elect on Tuesday yelped out more of the latter by taking to Twitter to upbraid General Motors for outsourcing to Mexico. Meanwhile, his nominee for the post of U.S. trade representative, also unveiled on Tuesday, heralds a more comprehensive assault on free cross-border commerce."
General Motors,2017-1,Robert Lighthizer is not just a vocal critic of China and the World Trade Organization. He also has a wealth of experience both arguing for and imposing tariffs and other import restraints.
General Motors,2017-1,"He was a deputy U.S. trade representative in the 1980s when the Reagan administration used various barriers and levies to stem an influx of cars, motorcycles, steel and semiconductors from Japan. More recently, he helped U.S. steel companies persuade the U.S. government to jack up import duties on Chinese steel."
General Motors,2017-1,"Lighthizer is an avowed believer in protectionism. That made him an early supporter of Trump, whose calls to get tough with China, according to Lighthizer, make him a fitting heir to leaders like Ronald Reagan, Abraham Lincoln and Alexander Hamilton who believed in protecting U.S. industry, not free-trade dogma."
General Motors,2017-1,"That puts Lighthizer squarely in the anti-WTO camp. Trump railed against NAFTA on the campaign trail but the WTO is the more important part of Bill Clinton's trade legacy. The Geneva-based organization enshrined a rules-based multilateral system, and China's admittance to the body in 2001 accelerated its industrialization and the rise of its massive trade surplus."
General Motors,2017-1,"Lighthizer blames an out-of-control WTO dispute-settlement system for too often ruling against the United States and making it almost impossible to combat dumping and unfair subsidies. His arguments are perfectly attuned to Trump's penchant for bilateral dealmaking, which lets him throw his, and now America's, weight around without restraint."
General Motors,2017-1,"- President-elect Donald Trump on Jan. 3 named trade lawyer Robert Lighthizer to be U.S. Trade Representative, saying he would ""fight for good trade deals that put the American worker first."""
General Motors,2017-1,"- As a deputy U.S. trade representative during the Reagan administration in the 1980s, Lighthizer helped to stem a tide of imports from Japan with threats of quotas and punitive tariffs. As a partner in the trade practice at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, he has represented U.S. steelmakers in cases that helped establish import duties against Chinese steel."
General Motors,2017-1,"- Shortly after the announcement, Trump attacked General Motors on Twitter for selling Chevy Cruze subcompacts made in Mexico in the United States, telling the company, ""Make in U.S.A. or pay a big border tax!"" GM said it builds the Cruze for global markets in Mexico and imports only ""a small number"" to the United States."

General Motors,2017-1,"Last month, Trump announced the formation of a council to advise him on job creation comprised of leaders from a variety of major U.S. corporations including GM Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra."
General Motors,2017-1,"GM said in 2015 it would build its next-generation Chevrolet Cruze compact in Mexico as automakers look to expand in the Latin American nation to take advantage of low labor costs and free trade agreements. The company said in 2015 it would invest $350 million to produce the Cruze at its plant in Coahuila as part of the $5 billion investment in its Mexican plants announced in 2014, creating 5,600 jobs."
General Motors,2017-1,GM said last year it would import some Cruze cars from Mexico.
