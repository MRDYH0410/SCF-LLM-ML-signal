General Motors,2017-4,"April 28 (Reuters) - Apple Inc urged California to toughen up its proposed policy on testing self-driving cars, a move that would result in more public data that could help Apple catch up to rivals in the self-driving space by giving it a better window into their strengths and weaknesses."
General Motors,2017-4,"In a letter made public on Friday, Apple suggested a series of changes to the draft policy that is under development and said it looks forward to working with California and others ""so that rapid technology development may be realized while ensuring the safety of the traveling public."""
General Motors,2017-4,"Waymo, the self-driving car unit of Google parent company Alphabet Inc , Ford Motor Co , Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL], Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T>, Tesla Motors Inc and others also filed comments suggesting changes."
General Motors,2017-4,California said on Tuesday it would review comments before deciding whether to make changes to the policy that aims to allow companies to test vehicles without traditional steering wheels and controls or human back-up drivers. [nL1N1HY1XM]
General Motors,2017-4,The state is at the forefront of a crowded race to develop self-driving vehicles and the proposed changes from automakers and technology companies help provide insight into current efforts.
General Motors,2017-4,"In its letter, Apple said California should revise how companies report self-driving system ""disengagements."" California currently requires companies to report how many times the self-driving system was deactivated and control handed back to humans because of a system failure or a situation tied to traffic, weather or road conditions that required human intervention for safety reasons."
General Motors,2017-4,"But Apple wants those rules to extend to humans stepping in to prevent even minor traffic violations. Apple contends the reporting rules as written leave too much wiggle room for car makers and ""caused public confusion and misunderstanding,"" wrote Steve Kenner, Apple's director of product integrity."
General Motors,2017-4,Apple also asked regulators to revisit language around the definition of an autonomous vehicle to clarify that permits are required in advanced systems even when a safety driver is present.
General Motors,2017-4,The exact wording around when permits are needed became a sticking point between Uber and state officials last year when the California Department of Motor Vehicles ordered Uber to cease its self-driving tests in San Francisco.
General Motors,2017-4,"Apple also said the state's rules for development vehicles used only in testing could ""restrict both the design and equipment that can be used in test vehicles."""
General Motors,2017-4,"A late entrant to the self-driving race, Apple secured a permit earlier this month to test autonomous vehicles in California. Although it has never openly acknowledged it is looking into building a car, Apple has recruited dozens of auto experts. The company declined to comment on Friday."
General Motors,2017-4,"Tesla said California should not bar testing of autonomous vehicles that are 10,000 pounds (4,535 kg) or more, a move that Apple also joined. Tesla said such a move could ""stifle innovation,"" and bar a company from testing a heavy autonomous vehicle that might be used to haul parts on private property rather than on public roads, pushing developers in this sector out of the state."
General Motors,2017-4,"Elon Musk, chief executive of Tesla, in 2016 announced plans for new electric vehicles, including a commercial truck called the Tesla Semi and a public transport bus. The electric vehicle pioneer said earlier this month it plans to unveil a commercial truck in September."
General Motors,2017-4,"Tesla also said California should not prohibit the sale of non-self-driving vehicles previously used for autonomous vehicle testing. Tesla said that under the proposal, if it loads a vehicle with autonomous testing software and then replaces it with conventional production software it could be barred from selling the vehicle."
General Motors,2017-4,"Uber said California should allow paying members of the public to ride in autonomous vehicles with drivers, saying: ""There is no reason to deny those riders an opportunity to travel in an autonomous test vehicle and provide honest feedback."""
General Motors,2017-4,"Lyft Inc, a ride-hailing service rival of Uber, asked the state to remove a requirement that it notify local authorities of autonomous vehicle testing."
General Motors,2017-4,"Waymo asked California to remove its liability proposal. On Tuesday, General Motors Co had said the state's proposed liability rules could make automakers liable regardless of fault for any crash. GM also said that automakers should be allowed to reuse autonomous vehicles and parts after testing or if the vehicle is scrapped."
General Motors,2017-4,Volkswagen AG and Daimler AG submitted joint comments seeking changes to the extent of data required to be retained in crashes involving self-driving cars.
General Motors,2017-4,"A number of automakers have said they plan to begin deploying self-driving vehicles, some in commercial fleets, by 2020-21."

General Motors,2017-4,"SAO PAULO/BRASILIA, April 28 (Reuters) - Brazilian protesters torched buses, clashed with police in several cities and marched on President Michel Temer's Sao Paulo residence on Friday amid the nation's first general strike in more than two decades."
General Motors,2017-4,"Unions called the strike to voice anger over Temer's efforts to push austerity measures through congress, bills that would weaken labor laws and trim a generous pension system."
General Motors,2017-4,The blackened hulls of at least eight burned commuter buses littered central Rio de Janeiro as police launched rounds of tear gas and rubber bullets at masked protesters.
General Motors,2017-4,"Despite the protests, Temer and members of his centre-right government denounced the strike as a failure. They said that the unions' targeting of public transport meant that people who wanted to go to work were unable to."
General Motors,2017-4,"Unions said the strike was a success and pointed to adherence by millions of workers in key sectors like automakers, petroleum, schools and even banking. Strikes hit all 26 states and the Federal District."
General Motors,2017-4,"""It is important for us to send a message to the government that the country is watching what they are doing, taking away workers' rights,"" said Marco Clemente, head of the 4,000-member radio and TV workers union in Brasilia, leading a picket line outside the headquarters of state broadcaster EBC."
General Motors,2017-4,"Temer, who was in Brasilia, denounced the violence used by some protesters. He said in an emailed statement that ""small groups"" had blocked the population from using public transport and said that ""work toward the modernization of national legislation will continue."""
General Motors,2017-4,"Brazil's last general strike took place in 1996, in protests over privatizations and labor reforms under former President Fernando Henrique Cardoso."
General Motors,2017-4,"Despite Friday's action, many analysts said the strike would have little immediate impact on the president's austerity push, and that the bills are still expected to pass given Temer's continued support among lawmakers."
General Motors,2017-4,Temer's reforms have deeply angered many Brazilians and he is weighed down by a 10 percent approval rating for his government.
General Motors,2017-4,"He took over last year when former leader Dilma Rousseff, whom Temer served as vice president, was impeached for breaking budgetary rules. Her supporters denounced the act as a 'coup' orchestrated by Temer and his allies in a bid to derail a sweeping corruption investigation."
General Motors,2017-4,"""This is not a government that was elected with these proposals,"" said Bernard Costa, a 27-year-old medical student protesting in Sao Paulo. ""These reforms are showing people that this government has is neither legitimate nor representative."""
General Motors,2017-4,"""Shameless government"" read one placard waved by one of a group of protesters who gathered outside Temer's family home in Sao Paulo. Police used tear gas to disperse the crowd."
General Motors,2017-4,Nearly one-third of Temer's ministers and several congressional leaders are under investigation in Brazil's largest political graft scheme yet uncovered. It revolves around kickbacks from construction companies in return for winning lucrative projects at state-run oil company Petrobras . [nS0N1H000X]
General Motors,2017-4,"Temer has proposed a minimum age for retirement, which would compel many employees to work longer to receive a pension and reduce payouts in a country were many workers retire with full benefits in their 50s."
General Motors,2017-4,"The lower house of Congress approved a bill this week to weaken labor laws by relaxing restrictions on outsourcing and temporary contracts, further inflaming union resistance."
General Motors,2017-4,"The government argues that economic reforms are needed to pull Brazil out of its worst recession on record, cut a huge budget deficit, reduce record unemployment and modernize the economy."
General Motors,2017-4,"The strike had a large impact on auto production in Sao Paulo, which concentrates the bulk of the industry in Brazil."
General Motors,2017-4,"General Motors Co , Ford Motor Co , Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T> and Mercedes-Benz parent Daimler AG all halted production, according to company officials, unions and market analysts. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV , the No. 1 car seller Brazil, said it was operating normally."
General Motors,2017-4,"Union officials said most workers at state-run oil producer Petroleo Brasileiro SA , known as Petrobras, joined the strike, but the company said the stoppage had no significant impact on output. Iron ore miner Vale SA said the strike did not affect its operations."
General Motors,2017-4,"The 24-hour strike started after midnight on Friday, ahead of a long weekend with Labor Day on Monday."
General Motors,2017-4,"The benchmark Bovespa stock index <.BVSP> was up nearly 1 percent while the nation's currency, the real , was little changed as investors assessed the impact of the strike."

General Motors,2017-4,"DETROIT, April 28 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc needs to complete fixing its Model S sedan emergency braking system to regain Consumer Reports' top safety rating, the magazine said on Friday, noting that a recent update by the luxury electric car maker was not enough."
General Motors,2017-4,"The magazine, which provides an annual rating of vehicles sold in the United States, said on Wednesday the sedan had lost its top ranking in the ultra-luxury car category for failing to install the feature that it had promised to owners as standard equipment. [nL1N1HY0B2]"
General Motors,2017-4,The Model S fell to third place in Consumer Reports' ratings behind the Lexus LS made by Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T> and the BMW 7 Series .
General Motors,2017-4,"Consumer Reports said both Tesla models previously came with standard automatic emergency braking (AEB), a feature that helps reduce accidents. The software issue affects more recent vehicles built since late October 2016."
General Motors,2017-4,"The magazine said Friday that the Model S sedan it owns had received an automatic emergency braking software update Thursday, but the new version only operates up to 28 miles per hour (45 km)."
General Motors,2017-4,That is far less than the current 90 mile per hour limit for the prior Tesla AEB system included on vehicles built before late October.
General Motors,2017-4,"The magazine cited a statement from Tesla that ""over the next several weeks"" the car maker would increase the speed limit ""until it is the most capable of any vehicle in the world."""

General Motors,2017-4,"SAN FRANCISCO, April 28 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc is recruiting engineers from Mexico to work on robotics and other automated equipment at its California factory, according to LinkedIn postings viewed by Reuters, part of a hiring push to ready the plant for mass production of the upcoming Model 3."
General Motors,2017-4,"The electric vehicle maker, which prides itself on its ""Made in America"" credentials, aims to build 500,000 cars a year by 2018 at its plant in Fremont, California, south of San Francisco. That would be a six-fold increase from 2016."
General Motors,2017-4,Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment on its Mexico hiring plans.
General Motors,2017-4,"The Silicon Valley carmaker is under the gun to accelerate production and save money as it readies for volume production of the Model 3 in September. The company's future profitability hinges on its success, and high hopes for the mass-market vehicle have helped push Tesla shares up 47 percent since January. [nL1N1HU0BC]"

General Motors,2017-4,"Doug Patton, president of SAE International, a professional association of automotive engineers headquartered in Pennsylvania, said Tesla's search for engineers in Mexico underscored a dearth of talent in the industry."
General Motors,2017-4,"""There are many more jobs than engineers, this is an engineering problem across the board,"" he said."

General Motors,2017-4,"WASHINGTON, April 27 (Reuters) - Manufacturers and Wall Street have led the quest for business access to President Donald Trump in his first 100 days in office, with media companies and Silicon Valley seldom entering the presidential bubble, a Reuters review found."
General Motors,2017-4,"Since inauguration day on Jan. 20, top executives from at least 186 companies have visited with Trump or senior advisers at the White House or on presidential trips, including those to Mar-a-Lago, the private, seaside Florida club where he spends many weekends."
General Motors,2017-4,"Some of the meetings have been reported in the press. But Reuters analyzed more than 900 White House press pool reports to give the first big picture view, albeit an incomplete one, of who has had the most and least success at bending the president's ear."
General Motors,2017-4,"Such access can be crucial for companies, with Trump regularly passing judgment and making proposals on business issues such as trade, taxes, immigration and regulation."
General Motors,2017-4,"The review showed Trump listening closely to some segments of Corporate America, though perhaps neglecting the dynamic technology and entertainment sectors, both powerful U.S. export industries."
General Motors,2017-4,"Tim Cook, CEO of Apple Inc , and other tech leaders met with Trump before his inauguration. [nL1N1E90NI]"
General Motors,2017-4,"Access sometimes means influence, but it was likely too soon to tell, after less than 100 days, whether Trump's actions have disproportionately favored big manufacturers and Wall Street."
General Motors,2017-4,"Industrial power-houses have led the way on access, including companies with the clout to make significant hiring decisions: Ford Motor Co CEO Mark Fields has met with Trump at least four times; General Motors CEO Mary Barra, at least four times; and Boeing representatives, at least three times."
General Motors,2017-4,The Reuters review helps fill a blank in the Trump record that opened in mid-April when he put the White House visitor logs off-limits to the public. They had been mostly public under Obama.
General Motors,2017-4,Transparency advocates have warned that Trump's decision will make it harder to hold him accountable. [nL1N1HM0KQ] [nL1N1HI1PS]
General Motors,2017-4,"""A public record of who has the president's ear is more important than it has ever been,"" said John Wonderlich, executive director of the Sunlight Foundation, a nonprofit good-government advocacy group."
General Motors,2017-4,"The review showed about half of the companies that have made it into the Trump inner circle through April 21, day 92 of his presidency, were manufacturers or financial firms - asset managers, insurers and banks ranging from Wall Street giants such as Citigroup to small community banks."
General Motors,2017-4,"Financier Stephen Schwarzman, who chairs a presidential advisory forum of business leaders, is CEO of the Blackstone Group , the largest manager of private equity and real estate assets. He was spotted by the press pool aboard Air Force 1 on Feb. 3 when the president was traveling to Mar-a-Lago. Schwarzman also attended at least three meetings with Trump and other executives."
General Motors,2017-4,"Almost all of Trump's meetings were group encounters with 10 or more executives sitting down with the president and White House officials in events billed as listening sessions, roundtable discussions or town halls."
General Motors,2017-4,"A few were more intimate encounters, such as on March 18, when Ike Perlmutter, CEO of Marvel Entertainment, a Walt Disney Corp. subsidiary, met with the president in Mar-a-Lago before having dinner with the president, first lady Melania Trump and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross."
General Motors,2017-4,"Perlmutter, however, was one of few executives from media companies seen by pool reporters in meetings with Trump."
General Motors,2017-4,"Information technology firms, which enjoyed significant access to former President Barack Obama, have had less access to Trump than legacy manufacturers such as auto and steel makers. IBM CEO Ginni Rometty attended three meetings with Trump, but was one of only a few CEOs from big tech firms seen at the White House."
General Motors,2017-4,"Manufacturers and financiers also enjoyed access to the White House under Obama, according to a Reuters review in December 2015 of White House visitor logs."
General Motors,2017-4,"The recent Reuters review is not comprehensive since the press pool, though dogged and alert, may have missed some of Trump's meetings with business leaders."
General Motors,2017-4,"The pool is a rotation of journalists from several outlets, including Reuters, who follow Trump and get briefings from White House officials on some, but not all of his meetings."
General Motors,2017-4,"WASHINGTON, April 26 (Reuters) - Major automakers are set to meet Thursday with the head of the U.S. Transportation Department and Environmental Protection Agency as the agencies begin a review of federal fuel efficiency rules that are a major piece of the climate change policy enacted by the Obama administration."
General Motors,2017-4,"U.S. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao and EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt will meet with board members Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a trade group representing General Motors Co , Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T>, Volkswagen AG , Ford Motor Co , Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV , Daimler AG and others, three people briefed on the matter said Wednesday."
General Motors,2017-4,"An alliance spokeswoman declined to comment Wednesday, while the EPA and the Transportation Department did not immediately comment."
General Motors,2017-4,"In March, President Donald Trump ordered a review of U.S. vehicle fuel-efficiency standards from 2022-2025 put in place by the Obama administration, effectively reopening a process the Obama administration had ended ahead of an April 2018 deadline."
General Motors,2017-4,"In 2011, Obama said the rules would save motorists $1.7 trillion in fuel costs over the life of the vehicles, but cost the auto industry about $200 billion over 13 years. Automakers have said that cost estimate is low."
General Motors,2017-4,"California regulators, who had worked with the Obama administration on the current national fuel efficiency standards, have opposed weakening the rules."
General Motors,2017-4,California has threatened to pursue tougher standards unilaterally and could mount a legal challenge. New York has also threatened a fight if the Trump administration rolls back the Obama standards.
General Motors,2017-4,"Earlier this month, Mitch Bainwol, chief executive of the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, said automakers hope to reach a deal with California and the Trump administration over vehicle fuel efficiency standards."
General Motors,2017-4,"Automakers want ""rational, predictable, stable policy,"" not a rollback of the existing standards, Bainwol said."
General Motors,2017-4,"The White House plans to hold negotiations with car companies and California over the fuel rules, but none have been scheduled since Trump met with autoamakers in Michigan on March 15 in a sesssion that included Chao and Pruitt."
General Motors,2017-4,Automakers need years of lead time to engineer future models and want uniform rules across all 50 states to reduce the cost and complexity of compliance.
General Motors,2017-4,"Without a deal, automakers could be forced to meet one set of standards in California and about a dozen states that have adopted its rules and other rules in the rest of the country."

General Motors,2017-4,"MILAN/DETROIT, April 26 (Reuters) - Fiat Chrysler Automobiles may seek more supplier partners to help it develop and build self-driving vehicles, Chief Executive Officer Sergio Marchionne said on Wednesday."
General Motors,2017-4,"The Jeep and Ram brands are strong enough to exist as standalone entities outside FCA, Marchionne also said on a conference call with analysts after the company reported record first-quarter results. But he did not elaborate on whether there were any plans for a spin-off of either, like with Ferrari."
General Motors,2017-4,"The automaker reported an 11 percent jump in first-quarter operating profit, boosted by strong sales in North America, its most profitable market. Shares jumped about 10 percent on the news. [nL8N1HY4VK]"
General Motors,2017-4,"FCA currently has a partnership with Alphabet Inc's Waymo self-driving unit. Marchionne said Waymo has an ""unbeatable solution"" to help build self-driving vehicles, including versions of the Chrysler Pacifica hybrid minivan, but that FCA is looking at additional partners."
General Motors,2017-4,"""Between now and the next three years, we need to provide viable solutions to take people around,"" Marchionne said, citing Waymo's new test program in Phoenix offering ride sharing in self-driving Pacificas. [nL1N1HX00V]"
General Motors,2017-4,"But FCA is considering more partners ""because banking all of our solutions on one possible outcome is going to be disastrous,"" Marchionne said. FCA continues to work with Waymo ""in a very intense way,"" he said, but ""we need to look at optionality in more than one dimension"" to build self-driving cars."
General Motors,2017-4,FCA is retooling several U.S. plants to produce redesigned versions of the popular Jeep Wrangler and Ram 1500 pickup later this year and early next. Marchionne said the company would continue to produce several versions of the current models for several months in 2018 after the new versions begin production.
General Motors,2017-4,"New models from premium brands Maserati and Alfa Romeo should help boost FCA's gross margins. Marchionne said Alfa, long a cash drain on the company, could be profitable in the fourth quarter, while Maserati has returned double-digit margins over the past three quarters. Both brands have launched new luxury utility vehicles in the United States."
General Motors,2017-4,"Marchionne said FCA hopes to resolve emissions certification issues ""in a few weeks"" with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the California Air Resources Board."
General Motors,2017-4,"In the meantime, he said FCA will try to meet future emissions regulations without relying so heavily on diesel engines, but with a combination of gasoline engines and electric motors."

General Motors,2017-4,"WASHINGTON, April 25 (Reuters) - Automakers on Tuesday urged the state of California to further ease its proposed regulations for autonomous vehicles, saying the state did not respond to their earlier objections by making enough revisions to its planned set of rules for self-driving cars."
General Motors,2017-4,"At a public hearing in Sacramento monitored via webcast, automakers urged California to drop some additional proposed regulations and leave much of the oversight to the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. But safety and consumer advocates urged the state to adopt strict oversight, and an official from San Francisco said cities should have more local control."
General Motors,2017-4,"A number of automakers have said they plan to begin deploying self-driving vehicles, some in commercial fleets, by 2020-2021."
General Motors,2017-4,"Paul Scullion, a manager at the Association of Global Automakers, said California's proposed regulations go ""too far."""
General Motors,2017-4,"The group opposes California's plan to require a permit to deploy autonomous vehicles, which must meet performance and design criteria. ""We do not think requiring a permit to deploy is the right approach,"" Scullion said. Global Automakers said it opposes California's proposal that it could withdraw permits to deploy vehicles even if they met federal requirements."
General Motors,2017-4,"Ron Medford, director of safety at Alphabet Inc's self-driving unit Waymo, urged California to quickly issue final rules ""to provide manufacturers with the certainty that they need."""
General Motors,2017-4,"Brian Soublet, deputy director of the California Department of Motor Vehicles, said the agency will review written comments before unveiling final rules."
General Motors,2017-4,"Andre Welch, a Ford Motor Co official, asked the state to lift the proposed prohibition on testing self-driving vehicles weighing more than 10,000 pounds, such as multi-passenger shuttles."
General Motors,2017-4,"Existing California regulations require self-driving test vehicles to have conventional manual controls such as steering wheels and pedals, as well as a backup driver. California moved to change the rules as many states said they would allow testing of vehicles without conventional controls."
General Motors,2017-4,"In March, California's Department of Motor Vehicles revised proposed rules to allow testing by the end of the year of autonomous vehicles without human backup drivers."
General Motors,2017-4,"After objections from automakers, the proposal was revised to drop requirements that local communities approve testing and that companies generate a year of testing data before being allowed to deploy vehicles on public roads."
General Motors,2017-4,"Among those who called for strict oversight of self-driving cars were Consumers for Auto Reliability and Safety. ""We do not trust the auto manufacturers or the tech industry to protect the public in the absence of federal motors vehicle safety standards,"" said the group's president Rosemary Shahan."
General Motors,2017-4,"The group Consumer Watchdog called for stricter state rules, noting that there were not yet any federal standards for self-driving cars. In written comments, the group said relying on federal standards would amount to a ""meaningless house of cards."""
General Motors,2017-4,"In February, U.S. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao said she was reviewing self-driving vehicle guidance issued by the Obama administration. Those guidelines call on automakers to voluntarily submit details of self-driving vehicle systems to regulators in a 15-point ""safety assessment."""
General Motors,2017-4,"California has proposed requiring companies submit a copy of a voluntary assessment submitted to NHTSA. David Strickland, a lawyer representing a group of self-driving advocates including Google, Ford and Uber [UBER.UL] opposed California's proposal, saying it effectively makes the assessment mandatory."
General Motors,2017-4,"Tom Maguire, an official at San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency, said in some cases the proposed rules ""rely too heavily on manufacturers' self certification of their safety technology."" The agency believes cities should have the authority to deny deployment and determine when and how testing occurs."
General Motors,2017-4,"General Motors Co official Paul Hemmersbaugh said California should drop plans to include separate privacy rules for driverless cars. The company said California's proposed liability rules could make automakers liable regardless of fault for any crash. He said that would be ""unduly punitive"" and could have a ""chilling effect on testing and deployment of self-driving cars."""

General Motors,2017-4,"DETROIT, April 24 (Reuters) - U.S. auto parts maker Flex-N-Gate will build a plant in Detroit in what local officials described on Monday as the first new investment by an automotive supplier in decades for Motor City, the cradle and former beating heart of the car industry."
General Motors,2017-4,"""This is the largest automotive supplier investment in Detroit in more than 20 years,"" Mayor Mike Duggan said at a groundbreaking ceremony under a light blue spring sky on Detroit's northeast side. ""We're starting to compete and win again."""
General Motors,2017-4,"Urbana, Illinois-based Flex-N-Gate will invest $95 million in the plant, which will employ 400-700 people and supply parts to Ford Motor Co . It is scheduled to open in the first quarter of 2018."
General Motors,2017-4,"Flex-N-Gate owner Shahid Khan said Ford was the ""great impetus"" behind locating the plant in Detroit and said it aims to employ locals.

General Motors,2017-4,"Workers say that before the seizure was announced, GM had been dismantling the plant, which has not produced a car since the beginning of 2016 because of shortages of parts and strict currency controls in the OPEC nation."
General Motors,2017-4,"The seizure, which GM called ""illegal,"" comes amid a deepening economic and social crisis in leftist-led Venezuela that has already roiled many U.S. companies."

General Motors,2017-4,"April 24 (Reuters) - General Motors Co's bid to block hundreds of lawsuits, potentially worth billions of dollars, over a deadly ignition-switch defect broke down on Monday when the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear its appeal claiming the suits were barred by the No. 1 American automaker's 2009 bankruptcy."
General Motors,2017-4,The justices declined to review a 2016 ruling by the New York-based 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that rejected GM's bid to block customer lawsuits related to crashes and diminished vehicle value because the plaintiffs had not been properly notified of the defect prior to the bankruptcy filing.
General Motors,2017-4,"The case involved a faulty ignition switch in GM vehicles linked to 124 deaths and 275 injuries. The switch could slip out of place, causing engine stalls while driving and cutting power to critical brakes, steering and air bag systems."
General Motors,2017-4,"GM spokesman Jim Cain said in a statement the denial of the appeal ""was not a decision on the merits, and it's likely that the issues we raised will have to be addressed in the future in other venues because the Second Circuit's decision departed substantially from well-settled bankruptcy law."""
General Motors,2017-4,"Investors shrugged off the ruling as GM shares rose $0.33, or 1 percent, to $34.08 in Monday trading."
General Motors,2017-4,"The court's action allows lawsuits to proceed over pre-bankruptcy death, injury, economic loss and used-car economic losses."
General Motors,2017-4,"""Hundreds of death and injury cases have been frozen in place for years as GM wrongly tried to hide behind a fake bankruptcy,"" Robert Hilliard, lead counsel for the plaintiffs, said in a statement. ""Now, GM can hide no more."""
General Motors,2017-4,"GM's Cain said that ""as a practical matter, this doesn't change the landscape much in terms of the GM litigation. The plaintiffs must still establish their right to assert successor liability claims. From there, (they) still have to prove those claims have merit."""
General Motors,2017-4,The defect prompted Detroit-based GM to begin recalling 2.6 million vehicles in 2014. It has already paid roughly $2.5 billion in criminal and civil penalties and settlements and legal fees in connection with the switch. The company previously acknowledged that some of its employees knew about the switch defect for years before a recall was initiated.
General Motors,2017-4,"In 2015, a U.S. bankruptcy judge ruled that GM was shielded from liability over its pre-bankruptcy actions. The 2nd Circuit reversed that ruling. Since the plaintiffs were not properly notified of the defect or bankruptcy filing, barring them from suing GM would violate their constitutional rights to due process, the court found."
General Motors,2017-4,"""Due process applies even in a company's moment of crisis,"" the appeals court stated."
General Motors,2017-4,"That ruling affected injury and death cases stemming from pre-bankruptcy crashes, as well as claims from customers who said their vehicles lost value as a result of the ignition switch and recalls involving other parts. The claims could be worth up to $10 billion, according to court papers."
General Motors,2017-4,"GM, supported by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers, said under the federal bankruptcy code, its 2009 bankruptcy sale to a new government-owned entity made it ""free and clear"" of former liabilities."

General Motors,2017-4,"Most automakers test a new model's production line by building vehicles with relatively cheap, prototype tools designed to be scrapped once they deliver doors that fit, body panels with the right shape and dashboards that don't have gaps or seams."
General Motors,2017-4,"Tesla, however, is skipping that preliminary step and ordering permanent, more expensive equipment as it races to launch its Model 3 sedan by a self-imposed volume production deadline of September, Musk told investors last month."
General Motors,2017-4,"Musk's decision underscores his high-risk tolerance and willingness to forego long-held industry norms that has helped Tesla upend the traditional auto industry. While Tesla is not the first automaker to try to accelerate production on the factory floor, no other rival is putting this much faith in the production strategy succeeding."
General Motors,2017-4,"Musk expects the Model 3 rollout to help Telsa deliver five times its current annual sales volume, a key target in the automaker's efforts to stop burning cash."
General Motors,2017-4,"""He's pushing the envelope to see how much time and cost he can take out of the process,"" said Ron Harbour, a manufacturing consultant at Oliver Wyman."
General Motors,2017-4,"Investors are already counting on Tesla's factory floor success, with shares soaring 39 percent since January as it makes the leap from niche producer to mass producer in far less time than rivals."

Tesla has encountered quality problems on its existing low-volume cars, and the Model 3 is designed to sell in numbers as high as 500,000 vehicles a year, raising the potential cost of recalls or warranty repairs."
General Motors,2017-4,"""It's an experiment, certainly,"" said Consumer Reports' Jake Fisher, who has done extensive testing of Tesla's previous Models S and X. Tesla could possibly fix errors quicker, speeding up the process, ""or it could be they have unsuspected problems they'll have a hard time dealing with."""

General Motors,2017-4,"Tesla's decision to move directly to the final tools is in part because lower grade, disposable equipment known as ""soft tooling"" ended up complicating the debut of the problem-plagued Model X SUV in 2015, according to a person familiar with the decision and Tesla's assembly line planning."
General Motors,2017-4,"Working on a tight deadline, Tesla had no time to incorporate lessons learned from soft tooling before having to order the permanent production tooling, making the former's value negligible, the source said."
General Motors,2017-4,"""Soft tooling did very little for the program and arguably hurt things,"" said the person."
General Motors,2017-4,"In addition, Tesla has learned to better modify final production tools, and its 2015 purchase of a Michigan tooling company means it can make major equipment 30 percent faster than before, and more cheaply as well, the source said."
General Motors,2017-4,"Financial pressure is partly driving Tesla's haste. The quicker Tesla can deliver the Model 3 with its estimated $35,000 base price to the 373,000 customers who have put down a $1000 deposit, the closer it can log $13 billion."
General Motors,2017-4,"Tesla has labored under financial pressure since it was founded in 2003. The company has yet to turn an annual profit, and earlier this year Musk said the company was ""close to the edge"" as it look toward capital spending of $2-2.5 billion in the first half of 2017."
General Motors,2017-4,Tesla has since gotten more breathing room by raising $1.2 billion in fresh capital in March [nL2N1GU03D] and selling a five per cent stake to Chinese internet company Tencent Holdings Ltd <0700.HK> .
General Motors,2017-4,"Musk has spoken to investors about his vision of an ""alien dreadnought"" factory that uses artificial intelligence and robots to build cars at speeds faster than human assembly workers could manage."
General Motors,2017-4,"But there are limits to what technology can do in the heavily regulated car business. For example, Tesla will still have to use real cars in crash tests required by the U.S. government, because federal rules do not allow simulated crash results to substitute for data from a real car."

General Motors,2017-4,"Tesla has labored under financial pressure since it was founded in 2003. The company has yet to turn an annual profit, and earlier this year Musk said the company was ""close to the edge"" as it look toward capital spending of $2-2.5 billion in the first half of 2017."
General Motors,2017-4,Tesla has since gotten more breathing room by raising $1.2 billion in fresh capital in March [nL2N1GU03D] and selling a five per cent stake to Chinese internet company Tencent Holdings Ltd <0700.HK> .
General Motors,2017-4,"Musk has spoken to investors about his vision of an ""alien dreadnought"" factory that uses artificial intelligence and robots to build cars at speeds faster than human assembly workers could manage."
General Motors,2017-4,"But there are limits to what technology can do in the heavily regulated car business. For example, Tesla will still have to use real cars in crash tests required by the U.S. government, because federal rules do not allow simulated crash results to substitute for data from a real car."

General Motors,2017-4,"SHANGHAI, April 18 (Reuters) - China's auto industry is charging ahead with aggressive plans to electrify cars even as policymakers scale back subsidies aimed at building sales from relatively low levels and consider tapping the brakes on sales quotas for plug-in cars."
General Motors,2017-4,"Industry executives will use the Shanghai Motor Show, which opens to the public on Friday, to show off numerous battery electric and plug-in hybrid models. But behind the scenes, many are worried that batteries capable of delivering the same driving range as gasoline cars are still too expensive."
General Motors,2017-4,"While green energy car sales have risen dramatically on the back of government policies, making China the world's leading market in this segment, electric cars have otherwise generated little consumer interest. They make up less than 2 percent of China's overall auto market of 28 million vehicles sold last year."
General Motors,2017-4,"The dominant players in China's electric vehicle market are local, including state-owned Beijing Automotive Group, and Warren Buffett-backed BYD <1211.HK><002594.SZ>. Most cars are relatively cheap with limited range."
General Motors,2017-4,"Beijing's central government has floated proposals to require automakers to substantially boost sales of so-called ""new energy vehicles"" (NEVs), or risk being penalized. But at the same time, it is cutting subsidies on green cars by a fifth this year, a move that could deepen manufacturers' losses on such models and discourage consumers from buying them."
General Motors,2017-4,Policymakers say reducing subsidies gradually to 2020 will wean automakers off government support and create a self-sustained market for electric vehicles. Industry officials and experts reckon tightening fuel efficiency regulations through 2020 will compel car makers to rely more on electrification to boost average fuel efficiency despite the drop-off in subsidies.
General Motors,2017-4,"Industry executives say long term, they expect China will insist on more electric vehicles, and to be ready, they must invest in developing those vehicles now."
General Motors,2017-4,"""We're not holding back anything. The requirements whether they get changed or adjusted or whatever, the bottom line is clear that electrification is going to play a bigger and bigger role ... in China and other markets as well,"" Ford Motor Co CEO Mark Fields told reporters at a pre-show event this month."
General Motors,2017-4,"Industry executives expect Beijing to ask automakers operating in China ultimately to generate green car credits equivalent to 12 percent of annual sales volume with NEVs by around 2020, with each green vehicle getting a different number of credits depending on the level of electrification and driving range."
General Motors,2017-4,Automakers and government officials have been bargaining over China's electric vehicle policy for years.
General Motors,2017-4,"In the latest draft policy released in September, Beijing proposed a requirement that they generate credits equivalent to 8 percent of automakers' sales next year by selling battery electric or plug-in hybrid vehicles, rising to 10 percent in 2019 and 12 percent in 2020. More recently, the government has indicated that timetable could slip. [nL3N1GL230]"
General Motors,2017-4,"Whatever target the government sets, automakers would have little choice but to comply. China is the world's biggest auto market by far, and growth is set to continue this year, albeit at a slower 5 percent, according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers."
General Motors,2017-4,"That is why even as automakers fight electric vehicle mandates in the United States, they are scrambling to develop more plug-in electric hybrids and electric battery cars for China."
General Motors,2017-4,"Ford, for example, says that by 2018 it will launch in China a plug-in hybrid sedan called the Mondeo Energi, a version of the low-volume Ford Fusion Energi offered in the United States. It also plans to bring an all-electric sport-utility vehicle to China over the next five years."
General Motors,2017-4,"General Motors Co , one of the largest automakers in the Chinese market, plans to launch at least 10 NEVs by 2020. To support the growth of its NEV line-up, GM has built a battery assembly plant in Shanghai which should be ready to deliver battery packs next year."
General Motors,2017-4,"Volkswagen plans to have 13 additional NEVs by 2020 based on its current generation of technology, following on plug-in hybrid versions of the Phideon sedan, due to be unveiled later on Tuesday, and the Audi A6L sedan. The VW brand aims to further launch 10 electric vehicles between 2020 and 2025."
General Motors,2017-4,"The German manufacturer also hopes to form a joint venture just for NEVs with Anhui Jianghuai Automobile Group (JAC) <600418.SS>, and any models from that partnership would be on top of those plans, a spokesman told Reuters. VW said in January the first VW-JAC car could be produced next year."
General Motors,2017-4,"China's drive for electric vehicles, driven in part to combat often suffocating urban smog, has put pressure on Japan's Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T> to re-think its earlier scepticism about battery-electric technology.

General Motors,2017-4,"To be sure, even as automakers renew commitments to produce more NEVs, it's not clear how aggressively they would push those cars in the marketplace."

General Motors,2017-4,"But PSA's sales fell 16 percent in the region last year and the decline has accelerated since. Deliveries were down by almost half in the first two months of 2017, when the Citroen brand achieved little more than one-third of its tally for the same period last year."
General Motors,2017-4,"Demand has also shifted from the saloons and hatchbacks that account for most of PSA's line-up to higher-riding models and Citroen will soon begin Chinese sales of the new C5 Aircross compact SUV, unveiled at the Shanghai show."

General Motors,2017-4,"RUSTON, Louisiana, April 17 (Reuters) - Mini motorcycle and go-kart maker Monster Moto made a big bet on U.S. manufacturing by moving assembly to this Louisiana town in 2016 from China."
General Motors,2017-4,"But it will be a long ride before it can stamp its products ""Made in USA."""
General Motors,2017-4,"The loss of nearly one out four U.S. factories in the last two decades means parts for its bike frames and engines must be purchased in China, where the manufacturing supply chain moved years ago."
General Motors,2017-4,"""There's just no way to source parts in America right now,"" said Monster Moto Chief Executive Alex Keechle during a tour of the company's assembly plant. ""But by planting the flag here, we believe suppliers will follow."""
General Motors,2017-4,"Monster Moto's experience is an example of the obstacles American companies face as they, along with President Donald Trump, try to rebuild American manufacturing. U.S. automakers and their suppliers, for example, have already invested billions in plants abroad and would face an expensive and time-consuming transition to buy thousands of American-made parts if President Trump's proposed ""border tax"" on imported goods were to become law."
General Motors,2017-4,"For now, finding U.S.-based suppliers ""remains one of the top challenges across our supplier base,"" said Cindi Marsiglio, Wal-Mart Stores Inc's vice president for U.S. manufacturing and sourcing. Wal-Mart partnered with Monster Moto and several other U.S. companies in a drive to increase spending on American-made goods by $250 billion by 2023 in response to consumer demand for American-made goods."
General Motors,2017-4,"Their experience has shown Americans' patriotic shopping habits have limits, namely when it comes to price."
General Motors,2017-4,"Take Monster Moto's bikes, which sell for between $249 to $749. Keechle, the CEO, says he can't raise those prices for fear his price sensitive prospective customers will turn to less expensive rivals made in China."
General Motors,2017-4,"""Consumers won't give you a free pass just because you put 'Made in USA' on the box,"" Keechle says. ""You have to remain price competitive."""
General Motors,2017-4,"Keeping a sharp eye on labor costs in their factory is one thing these U.S. manufactures can control. They see replacing primarily lower-skilled workers on the assembly line with robots on American factory floors as the only way to produce here in a financially viable, cost-competitive way. It's a trend that runs against the narrative candidate Donald Trump used to win the U.S. Presidency."
General Motors,2017-4,"Since taking office, Trump has continued promises to resurrect U.S. manufacturing's bygone glory days and bring back millions of jobs. On March 31, Trump directed his administration to clamp down on countries that abuse trade rules in a bid to end to the ""theft of American prosperity."" [nW1N1GM01Z]"
General Motors,2017-4,But it's more complicated on the ground for companies like Monster Moto.
General Motors,2017-4,"""It's almost as if people think you can just unplug manufacturing in one part of the world and plug it in to the U.S. and everything's going to be fine,"" said David Abney, Chief Executive Officer of package delivery company United Parcel Service Inc , which helped Monster Moto reconfigure its supply chain to bring its Chinese-made parts to Ruston."
General Motors,2017-4,A White House official said that the Trump administration's efforts to encourage manufacturers to reshore production will be focused on cutting regulations and programs to provide new skills to manufacturing workers.
General Motors,2017-4,"""We recognize that the manufacturing jobs that come back to America might not all look like the ones that left,"" a White House official said, ""and we are taking steps to ensure that the American workforce is ready for that."""
General Motors,2017-4,"In Monster Moto's cavernous warehouse in Ruston, boxes of imported parts that are delivered at one end then become bikes on a short but industrious assembly line of a few dozen workers."
General Motors,2017-4,"A solitary, long-bearded worker by the name of Billy Mahaffey fires up the bikes to test their engine and brakes before a small group of workers puts them in boxes declaring: ""Assembled in the USA."""
General Motors,2017-4,"Helped by that label, Monster Moto has experienced a recent boom in demand from major customers that include Wal-Mart. The company expects to double production to 80,000 units and increase its assembly workers - who make $13 to $15 an hour - to 100 from around 40 in 2017."
General Motors,2017-4,"The most likely components Monster Moto could produce in America first are black, welded-metal frames for bikes and go-karts, but they would have to automate production because human welders would be too expensive."
General Motors,2017-4,"""We can't just blow up our cost structure,"" said Monster Moto President Rick Sukkar. ""The only way to make it work in America is with robotics."""
General Motors,2017-4,"The same principle applies for much larger manufacturers, such as automotive supplier Delphi Automotive PLC's . Chief Financial Officer Joe Massaro told analysts in February that 90 percent of the company's hourly workforce is in ""best-cost countries."""
General Motors,2017-4,"""We're going to see more automation in this country because it makes good sense economically for every company,"" said Hal Sirkin, a managing director at the Boston Consulting Group. ""You can spend a lot of time bemoaning it, but that's not going to change."""
General Motors,2017-4,"Manufacturers say automated production requires fewer, but more skilled workers such as robot programmers and operators. The National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) estimates because of the ""skills gap"" there are 350,000 unfilled manufacturing jobs today in a sector that employs over 12 million people."
General Motors,2017-4,"In Ruston, Mayor Ronny Walker bet on Monster Moto by guaranteeing the company's lease because he wants to diversify the city's economy, and envisions suppliers setting up alongside Monster Moto's assembly plant."

General Motors,2017-4,"Marchionne had repeatedly called for mergers in the car industry and a tie-up has long been seen as the ultimate aim of his relaunch of Fiat Chrysler, which he is due to leave in early 2019 after 15 years at the helm."

General Motors,2017-4,"DETROIT/BOSTON, April 12 (Reuters) - Greenlight Capital nominated three directors to General Motors Co's board on Wednesday and accused the company of misrepresenting to ratings agencies the prominent hedge fund's proposal to split the automaker's common stock into two classes."
General Motors,2017-4,Greenlight manager David Einhorn told Reuters on Wednesday the automaker has refused to allow him to present his proposal to credit agencies for a formal review of how the plan would affect the company's credit risk.
General Motors,2017-4,"""We think the credit rating process has been unfairly manipulated,"" Einhorn said. ""We call on GM to allow us to work directly with the credit rating agencies."""
General Motors,2017-4,"GM fired back that any suggestion the automaker had failed to share Greenlight's proposal in full with the ratings agencies was ""baseless and irresponsible."""
General Motors,2017-4,"Einhorn went public with a proposal in late March that the U.S. automaker create one class of stock that pays a dividend and one that does not, but would be tied to GM's potential growth. [nL3N1H54NI]"
General Motors,2017-4,"The move would lower the company's cost of capital, improve financial flexibility and boost market capitalization by as much as $38 billion, Einhorn said."
General Motors,2017-4,"No other GM shareholder has yet backed Einhorn's proposal, with Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc remaining conspicuously silent."
General Motors,2017-4,"GM has rebuffed Einhorn's proposal, saying it would not help the automaker ""sell more cars, drive higher profitability, or generate greater cash flow."" Both Moody's and Standard & Poor's have declared such a structure could hurt its credit rating."
General Motors,2017-4,"When asked whether Einhorn's claims on Wednesday changed anything, an S&P Global Ratings spokesman referred Reuters to the agency's previous opinion from late March."
General Motors,2017-4,"The views of the rating agencies are a key element in the proxy fight that will play out over the next several weeks, unless GM and Einhorn can reach a settlement."
General Motors,2017-4,"In the interview, Einhorn said his plan would also allow GM to preserve more of its cash reserves, at a time when some analysts are concerned the U.S. auto industry is heading into a cyclical slowdown."
General Motors,2017-4,"""Our proposal is an elegant way to unlock that kind of value without drawing on the cash resources of the company,"" Einhorn said."
General Motors,2017-4,"Greenlight Capital has owned GM shares on and off for five years and now has a 4.9 percent stake, including options."
General Motors,2017-4,GM stock has performed poorly versus its peers and compared with the broader market. GM shares traded on Wednesday afternoon at $34 - just a dollar above the IPO price when the company went public in 2010 after a government-led bankruptcy.
General Motors,2017-4,"The disagreement became a full-fledged proxy fight on Wednesday as Greenlight said GM's advisers had no interest ""in performing an objective analysis"" of Einhorn's proposal."
General Motors,2017-4,"In a regulatory filing, Greenlight said GM had then ""substantially altered"" the term sheet for its proposal before handing it to the ratings agencies and that this different version included ""various misrepresentations"" of the plan."
General Motors,2017-4,"GM said in a statement: ""The rating agencies' public statements issued regarding the Greenlight proposal clearly indicate that they understood the idea in all its facets, and would represent a credit negative if implemented.

General Motors,2017-4,"NEW YORK, April 12 (Reuters Breakingviews) - The struggle to unlock shareholder value at General Motors is turning increasingly acrimonious. Activist David Einhorn on Wednesday stepped up his campaign for the automaker to create a second class of stock by resorting to belittlement, accusation and three board nominees. The war of words does little to alter the arguments, or the activist's chances of success."
General Motors,2017-4,"Both the company and Einhorn, who runs Greenlight Capital, are frustrated by GM's depressed valuation. Despite solid earnings, the automaker trades at just 5.6 times this year's estimated earnings, the lowest multiple in the S&P 500. Einhorn reckons splitting the stock into one share entitling holders to the company's $1.52 dividend and a second share to capture all future growth would boost the company's value by as much as 72 percent."
General Motors,2017-4,On Wednesday he spelled out in a detailed regulatory filing his fruitless attempts in several meetings over an eight-month period to persuade GM boss Mary Barra and finance chief Chuck Stevens of the merits of his plan. They rejected it last month saying it might cost the company its investment-grade credit rating.
General Motors,2017-4,"Einhorn and Greenlight didn't pull any punches. GM, reads the filing, ""substantially altered"" his proposal before sharing it with rating agencies, obscuring the fact that under one of his alternative ideas, new GM dividend shares would rank as common rather than preferred stock. For good measure, Einhorn said Stevens showed ""a shocking lack of understanding of the proposal"" at one meeting."
General Motors,2017-4,"Classifying dividend shares as common might well ease the rating agencies' concerns. But if that means the company can suspend dividends at any time, as Einhorn suggests, investors would be unlikely to value them as highly."
General Motors,2017-4,"GM has dismissed Greenlight's charge of misrepresentation as ""baseless and irresponsible."" Einhorn's proposal also pays little heed to broader auto-industry issues that have kept most manufacturers' multiples in single digits for several years: the challenge of electric and autonomous cars and, more recently, the decline in U.S. car sales. It's hard to see how financial engineering can address those more fundamental issues."
General Motors,2017-4,- David Einhorn's Greenlight Capital on April 12 nominated three people for shareholders to consider voting onto General Motors' board at the automaker's annual meeting. In a regulatory filing Greenlight also outlined its discussions with GM executives about its proposal to split GM's common stock into two classes.
General Motors,2017-4,"- In the filing, Greenlight accused GM of misrepresenting its ideas to rating agencies and reported that Einhorn told GM's finance chief Chuck Stevens that one of his statements about the stock plan ""represented a shocking lack of understanding of the proposal and the associated valuation arithmetic and after many months of alleged evaluation of the proposal."""

General Motors,2017-4,"NEW YORK, April 11 (Reuters) - A trade group for automakers said on Tuesday it hopes to reach a deal with California and the Trump administration over vehicle fuel efficiency standards."
General Motors,2017-4,"Mitch Bainwol, chief executive of the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a trade group representing General Motors Co , Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T>, Volkswagen AG and others, said at a forum ahead of the New York auto show that automakers were not seeking a rollback of existing standards."
General Motors,2017-4,"""What we want is rational, predictable, stable policy,"" he said. Automakers hope ""that over time responsible parties will come together and have an honest conversation about what the data is."""
General Motors,2017-4,"In March, President Donald Trump ordered a review of U.S. vehicle fuel-efficiency standards from 2022-2025 put in place by the Obama administration, saying they were too tough on the auto industry."
General Motors,2017-4,"But California opposed weakening the rules, threatened to pursue tougher standards unilaterally and could mount a legal challenge. New York has also threatened a fight."
General Motors,2017-4,"The White House plans to hold negotiations with car companies and California. A deal would remove uncertainty for automakers, who need years of lead time to engineer future models and want uniform rules across all 50 states."
General Motors,2017-4,"The Obama administration's rules, negotiated with automakers in 2011, were aimed at doubling average fleet-wide fuel efficiency to 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025. Under the 2011 deal, the 2022-2025 model year rules must be finalized by April 2018."
General Motors,2017-4,"""The talk the of rollback is fallacious. What we are talking here is the nature of the slope,"" Bainwol said. ""We will get to the Obama numbers (54.5 mpg). We will get beyond the Obama numbers. The question is when and how."""
General Motors,2017-4,"Without a deal, automakers could be forced to meet one set of standards in California and about a dozen states that have adopted its rules and other rules in the rest of the country."
General Motors,2017-4,"In 2011, Obama said the rules would save motorists $1.7 trillion in fuel costs over the life of the vehicles, but cost the auto industry about $200 billion over 13 years."

General Motors,2017-4,"NEW YORK, April 11 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Tesla's shareholders have driven off into la-la land. By the close on Monday they charged up the company's market value to $51 billion, taking it just ahead of General Motors to become America's largest automaker. That implies investors think Chief Executive Elon Musk will outdo even some of his biggest cheerleaders' expectations."
General Motors,2017-4,"For all his success, though, Musk has also routinely missed production targets in recent years. Even so, Tesla now trades at some 28 times estimated earnings in 2020. By then Musk expects to be producing 1 million cars a year, up from around 100,000 in 2017."
General Motors,2017-4,Another way to assess these numbers is to discount the projected 2030 earnings back to this year at a rule-of-thumb 10 percent annual rate. Tesla's current valuation is about 18 times that discounted profit figure.
General Motors,2017-4,"That's possible. By 2030, a quarter of miles driven in the United States could be in self-driving electric cars, according to Boston Consulting Group. Musk faces plenty of competition, though. His backers seem to be assuming he will always have the run of the road."
General Motors,2017-4,"- Tesla stock closed up more than 3 percent at $312.39 a share on April 10, taking its market value to just under $51 billion and a fraction above that of General Motors, making Tesla the largest U.S. car maker by market capitalization for the first time."

General Motors,2017-4,"DETROIT, April 6 (Reuters) - General Motors Co's chief financial officer said on Thursday the automaker expects another ""very strong year"" in 2017 and reiterated the company's earnings forecast for the year."
General Motors,2017-4,"""Overall, we expect a more challenging environment across a number of dimensions"" in 2017, due to rising interest rates and falling used-car prices, CFO Chuck Stevens told investors and analysts on a conference call."
General Motors,2017-4,"But thanks to an improving economy and lower fuel prices, Stevens said GM believes ""we're going to be in a reasonably constructive industry environment."""
General Motors,2017-4,"Stevens said the No. 1 U.S. automaker will reduce inventory levels, a concern for Wall Street, to around 90 days in June from 98 at the end of March, and to around 70 days by the end of 2017."

General Motors,2017-4,"GM still expects full-year earnings per share of $6.00 to $6.50, he said."
General Motors,2017-4,Stevens said the company expected its used car prices to come down around 7 percent this year as many leased vehicles return to the market.

General Motors,2017-4,"SYDNEY, April 5 (Reuters) - When ride-hailing company Uber started in 2014, Sydney resident Rosalina Kariotakis was among the first drivers to sign up, becoming part of the ""gig economy"" where freelance work is transforming the traditional job market in step with advances in technology."
General Motors,2017-4,"Mobile or online platforms are at the forefront of a boon in casual work for individuals who are seeking greater flexibility for less security - many of them are giving up benefits such as sick leave, life insurance and pension fund savings."
General Motors,2017-4,"In Australia, this sea change is putting a strain on the country's much-admired A$2.1 trillion ($1.60 trillion) system of retirement savings - the world's fourth largest - which relies on mandated contributions by employers."
General Motors,2017-4,"""Our research shows that contingent and part-time workers are missing out on A$150 million a year in super payments,"" said Damian Hill, chief executive of REST Super, a superannuation fund with A$39 billion in assets."
General Motors,2017-4,"Australia is one of the few countries to have a mandatory retirement system, also known as superannuations or supers, whereby employers pay a contribution of 9.5 percent on top of the employees' wages."
General Motors,2017-4,"But digital companies including Uber, Deliveroo, Airtasker and Foodora, which employ independent contractors are not obliged to contribute to superannuations as the workers are seen as self employed."
General Motors,2017-4,"Even Kariotakis, a former General Motors employee now in her mid-40s, is nervous about the absence of retirement savings."
General Motors,2017-4,"""It's a big problem,"" Kariotakis said, in response to how she envisages her finances when she retires. ""At the moment, we can't afford to put money aside."""
General Motors,2017-4,"So as the gig economy grows, it signals a problematic trend for the retirement savings pool in Australia which made superannuations compulsory in 1983 to reduce the reliance on the national pension system."
General Motors,2017-4,"Even though the gig economy's ""leakage"" from the pension funds is a drop compared with the A$136 billion of annual contributions paid by employers in 2016, the dent on retirement savings could be significant in years to come."
General Motors,2017-4,"""When people are self-employed, their tendency to set aside money for retirement is secondary to their need to maintain cashflow for the business,"" said Martin Fahy, the chief executive of Australia's superannuation industry body."
General Motors,2017-4,"While the scale of Australia's gig economy - a relatively recent phenomenon - is yet to be reflected in official data, an increasing number of individuals are freelancing for various digital outfits."
General Motors,2017-4,"The Australian Industry Group, a major business lobby, said in an August 2016 report that 32 percent of the country's workforce had freelanced between 2014 and 2015 - meaning the digital economy is already creating irrevocable changes in the country's labour market."
General Motors,2017-4,"In the longer term, Kariotakis is hoping to see modifications to the national benefits framework so that employers, such as Uber, are legally forced to pay pension benefits."

General Motors,2017-4,"DETROIT, April 4 (Reuters) - General Motors Co on Tuesday unveiled a German-made Buick crossover wagon it plans to sell in the United States, and in so doing highlighted the U.S. auto industry's vulnerability to shifting trade politics."
General Motors,2017-4,"The Buick Regal TourX, scheduled to launch later this year in the United States, is aimed at imported all-wheel drive vehicles such as those offered by Subaru and Zhejiang Geely Holding's [GEELY.UL] Volvo Cars."
General Motors,2017-4,"In a plan mapped out long before the Trump administration and Congress began talking about taxing imported goods, GM planned to build the TourX at a factory in Ruesselsheim, Germany, near Frankfurt."
General Motors,2017-4,"Asked how a potential ""border tax"" on imported goods could affect the TourX, GM product development chief Mark Reuss told reporters that such a levy might hurt, but added: ""I don't know what the border tax is."
General Motors,2017-4,"""How can you make a product plan based on something you don't know?"" he asked."
General Motors,2017-4,"Reuss said GM is making plans to deal with a border tax, which could affect not just the Regal TourX. GM imports a Buick sport utility vehicle called the Envision from China, and has electric vehicles it needs for the Chinese market that it currently builds only in the United States. China levies steep tariffs and taxes on imported vehicles."
General Motors,2017-4,"In a separate interview, the head of GM's North American operations said he is encouraged that President Donald Trump and administration officials are listening as auto industry executives explain the complex, global supply chains behind their model lineups."
General Motors,2017-4,"""It's too early to speculate, but we believe the new administration is more aligned with us than different,"" said Alan Batey, who runs GM's North American auto business and the Chevrolet brand globally. There is ""a very open and constant dialogue"" with administration officials, he said."
General Motors,2017-4,"GM's chief executive, Mary Barra, is a member of an advisory council to President Trump."
General Motors,2017-4,"The TourX was one of two new Buick models the brand unveiled at GM's design center in suburban Detroit. The other, the Regal Sportback, offered an unusual hatch opening designed to give a car that looks like a sporty coupe the functional utility of a sport utility vehicle.

General Motors,2017-4,"BEIJING/WASHINGTON, April 4 (Reuters) - Although worried about the prospect of a trade war, American businesses operating in China nonetheless want President Donald Trump to wring some concessions on market access from China's leader Xi Jingping when the two meet this week."
General Motors,2017-4,"Trump warned in a tweet last week the meetings at his Mar-a-Lago resort on Thursday and Friday will be ""very difficult"" and ""American companies must be prepared to look at other alternatives."""
General Motors,2017-4,Trump has said he wants U.S. companies to stop investing in China and instead create jobs at home. He has also accused China of manipulating its currency to boost exports.
General Motors,2017-4,"Critics within U.S. industry have accused China of unfair government subsidies to its companies, and of flooding the U.S. market with cheap products from steel to solar panels, while restricting foreign investment over vast swathes of the world's second-biggest economy."
General Motors,2017-4,"But they also worry Trump's policies on China are not entirely clear, with his trade team still not in place, and may be subject to a 'grand bargain' involving other issues such as North Korea."
General Motors,2017-4,"Trump is set to enter the meeting without several key advisors, including his pick for trade negotiator, Robert Lighthizer who has yet to be confirmed by Congress. His nominee as ambassador to China, Iowa Governor Terry Branstad, has also yet to be confirmed, while several posts in the U.S. State Department that formulate Asia policy remain unfilled."
General Motors,2017-4,"""With this in mind, it is hard to imagine that there will be much in the way of concrete accomplishments at this summit, or even that there has been any significant interagency discussion on strategy leading up to it,"" said Randal Phillips, Mintz Group's Beijing-based managing partner for Asia and the former chief CIA representative in China."
General Motors,2017-4,"Some of the largest U.S. companies have contributed to the billions of dollars of foreign direct investment that have poured into China over the past two decades, creating hundreds of thousands of jobs. They include tech companies like Apple, which makes much of its iPhone in China, automakers such as General Motors and Ford, heavy machinery firms like Caterpillar, retailers like Starbucks and makers of shaving foam and detergent, like Procter & Gamble."
General Motors,2017-4,"U.S. steel producers want Trump to press Xi on Chinese steel prices, according to a source who has been in discussions with the administration in advance of the summit."
General Motors,2017-4,"U.S. automakers complain about a disparity in tariffs: The United States has a 2.5 percent tariff on auto imports, China's is 25 percent."
General Motors,2017-4,"But the stakes are perhaps highest for American technology firms, who worry that China's new cyber-security law, which takes effect in June, sets potentially discriminatory standards for multinationals."
General Motors,2017-4,"The Information Technology & Innovation Foundation (ITIF), a think-tank whose board includes representatives from Apple, IBM Google and other tech heavyweights, has urged the Trump administration to pressure China to ""stop rigging markets"". It warned that possible retaliation from Beijing was not a reason for inaction.[nL3N1GT2ZS]"
General Motors,2017-4,"Trump has staked out various positions on China as president in his tweets, phone calls and statements."
General Motors,2017-4,"Trump signed two executive orders on trade on Friday, one to improve import tariff collection and another to study the causes of the U.S. trade deficit. Trump said at the White House signing ceremony he and Xi were ""going to get down to some serious business"" and vowed that ""the theft of American prosperity"" by foreign countries would end."
General Motors,2017-4,Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Zheng Zeguang said on Friday the U.S.-China trade imbalance was mostly the result of differences in the two countries' economic structures and noted China had a trade deficit in services.
General Motors,2017-4,"China tops the list of countries who have trade surpluses with the United States, with a $347 billion surplus last year."
General Motors,2017-4,Some in the U.S. business community worry about tit-for-tat retaliation in trade disputes with China.
General Motors,2017-4,"Jacob Parker, vice president of China operations at the U.S.-China Business Council, said the two presidents need to take ""positive actions that would lead to a more durable relationship, not retaliatory actions that would lead to a trade war""."
General Motors,2017-4,"The list of commercial issues between the two countries was so long, it would be impossible to make a major dent in them with one meeting, he said."
General Motors,2017-4,"China is the largest export market for U.S. soybean producers, accounting for 62 percent of U.S. soy exports in 2016 with a value of over $14 billion, leading some experts to suggest the sector could be particularly vulnerable to retaliation."
General Motors,2017-4,"Steve Censky, chief executive of the American Soybean Association, told Reuters he hopes Trump will take a ""prudent"" approach to the trade relationship and address any issues in a ""workman-like manner"", recognising that both countries have a lot to lose if the relationship suffers."
General Motors,2017-4,"William Zarit, chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China met senior Trump administration officials in February, and said ""it was clear they were very familiar with the issues facing American companies in China, perhaps more so than previous administrations""."
General Motors,2017-4,"But several corporate lobbyists, representing a range of companies expressed concern Trump's lack of attention to detail could prove counterproductive when it comes to the intricacies of the massive trade and investment relationship."

General Motors,2017-4,"BOSTON, March 31 (Reuters) - Investors have given billionaire hedge fund manager David Einhorn's plan to boost General Motors Co's value a frosty reception with most surveyed saying his call for two types of shares would not raise the automaker's worth, according to an Evercore ISI poll."
General Motors,2017-4,"Einhorn, who runs hedge fund Greenlight Capital, this week proposed that GM create two classes of stock, one that pays a dividend and one that does not, to boost the No. 1 U.S. carmaker's languishing share price. More investors would buy the shares, helping boost the company's market capitalization, Greenlight contended."
General Motors,2017-4,"But 53 out of 61 investors surveyed by investment banking advisory firm Evercore ISI said they did not believe Greenlight's proposal would lead to value accretion at GM. In fact, a significant majority of investors polled - 48 people, or 80 percent - said Einhorn's plan could jeopardize the company's credit rating. Of the investors surveyed, 34 percent were GM shareholders."
General Motors,2017-4,"Greenlight on Friday called the survey ""fundamentally flawed"" and through a spokesman said it failed to understand the firm's plan to unlock value at GM."
General Motors,2017-4,"GM rejected Einhorn's plan, saying it had reviewed it for seven months but considered it too risky. [nL3N1H54NI]"
General Motors,2017-4,"Evercore ISI is working for GM and surveyed investors after Einhorn, whose Greenlight Capital has owned GM shares on and off for five years and currently owns a 0.9 percent stake, made his plan public on Tuesday."
General Motors,2017-4,Now Einhorn is taking his plan to GM shareholders more broadly through a proxy contest where he hopes to win seats on the board. Investors will vote on board members at the upcoming annual meeting and Einhorn would need to quickly mobilize many large owners to agree with his proposal in order to win enough votes for his slate.
General Motors,2017-4,"While a number of investors in Einhorn's own fund have applauded him for coming up with this novel approach, no major GM shareholder has yet publicly thrown their weight behind the plan."
General Motors,2017-4,"Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc , which is GM's sixth largest investor with a 3.34 percent stake, has remained silent about Einhorn's proposal. Greenlight Capital is the 17th largest investor."
General Motors,2017-4,"Nearly all those polled, or 93 percent of investors, said they were satisfied with GM management's plan to return some $7 billion to shareholders this year, through share buy backs worth $5 billion and $2.2 billion in dividend payouts."
General Motors,2017-4,GM's stock is currently trading at $35.46 and it pays an annual dividend of $1.52 per share.
