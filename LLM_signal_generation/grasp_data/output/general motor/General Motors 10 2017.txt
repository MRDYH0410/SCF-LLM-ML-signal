General Motors,2017-10,"SYDNEY/MELBOURNE, Oct 31 (Reuters) - Battery makers are increasingly turning to nickel to help power growing global electric car sales, but only half of the world's producers of the metal are likely to benefit, mining analysts and executives say."
General Motors,2017-10,"Lithium batteries containing nickel, which helps keep a charge over longer distances, are being installed in electric cars from Tesla's top-of-the-line Model X to General Motors Co modestly-priced Chevy Bolt."
General Motors,2017-10,"The battery boom promises a new and growing market for miners producing high-grade nickel products. However, half the world's supply of the metal, comprised of so-called ferronickel and nickel pig iron grades, is unsuitable for battery production, according to analysts at UBS."
General Motors,2017-10,"Some of the biggest producers of the higher-grade ores, including BHP Norilsk Nickel , Vale and Sumitomo Corp <8053.T>, are moving quickly to take advantage and seal long-term supply deals with battery producers."
General Motors,2017-10,"Smaller producers with ores suitable for batteries, such as Australia's Independence Group and Western Areas also stand to win."
General Motors,2017-10,These producers are building plants to convert the metal into a powder-like sulfate that is particularly suited for use in batteries. Sulfate nickel regularly fetches a price premium over London Metal Exchange-traded nickel.

General Motors,2017-10,"""We've met with quite a number of battery manufacturers, and they are quite specific on their requirements. Nickel is an important component of these batteries."""
General Motors,2017-10,"Among those losing out would be lower-grade nickel mines like Cerro Matoso in Columbia, owned by South32 Ltd and Glencore's Koniambo in New Caledonia, as well as Anglo American's mines in Brazil producing ferronickel."
General Motors,2017-10,"""The market dynamics will change in the coming years as a result of electric vehicles,"" said Peter Bradford, chief executive of Independence Group Ltd , which is aiming to produce around 25,0000 tonnes of high-purity nickel this year from a new mine."

General Motors,2017-10,{{20171029T190740.705+0000}}GM settles California county recall case for $13.9 mlnBy David Shepardson
General Motors,2017-10,"WASHINGTON Oct 29 (Reuters) - General Motors Co agreed to a $13.9 million settlement with Orange County, California after prosecutors accused the Detroit automaker of intentionally concealing serious safety defects including those involving faulty ignition switches tied to nearly 400 deaths and injuries, the company said on Sunday."
General Motors,2017-10,"An Orange County superior court judge late Friday approved the settlement for alleged violations of unfair competition and false advertising laws for some vehicles recalled in 2014, including the ignition switch recall. Earlier this month, GM agreed to a separate $120 million settlement with 49 states and the District of Columbia over faulty ignition switches and its auto safety practices. [nL2N1MU18E]"
General Motors,2017-10,"Orange County District Attorney Tony Rackauckas said in a statement that GM failed to disclose defects in power steering, airbag and braking systems."
General Motors,2017-10,"The largest U.S. automaker had previously paid about $2.5 billion in penalties and settlements over faulty ignition switches that could cause engines to stall and prevent airbags from deploying in crashes. The defect has been linked to 124 deaths and 275 injuries, and prompted a recall that began in February 2014 of 2.6 million vehicles."
General Motors,2017-10,"GM spokesman David Caldwell said in a statement that since 2014, GM had taken important steps to help ensure vehicle safety, including a new organizational structure and a new program to encourage employees to report potential issues."
General Motors,2017-10,"GM still faces more than 100 lawsuits in connection with the ignition switch recall, including economic loss and personal injury claims. The only remaining governmental lawsuit is from the state of Arizona."
General Motors,2017-10,"In 2015, GM paid $900 million to settle a U.S. Justice Department criminal investigation and agreed to three years of oversight by an independent monitor after being charged with wire fraud."
General Motors,2017-10,"No individuals were charged, but Chief Executive Mary Barra fired 15 people, including eight executives, over the issue. The ignition switch probe prompted an industrywide jump in recalls in 2014 to an all-time high and cast a spotlight on GM's safety record as Barra testified before the U.S. Congress."

General Motors,2017-10,"WASHINGTON, Oct 27 (Reuters) - The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said Friday it is funding a pilot program that will notify drivers in the state of Maryland if there are open, uncompleted recalls at the time that they register their vehicles."
General Motors,2017-10,The government says only about 70 percent of auto safety recalls have led to repairs or resolution of the problematic issues.
General Motors,2017-10,"Automakers, who have recalled record numbers of vehicles in recent years, have struggled to convince millions of owners of vehicles with potentially faulty Takata air bags to get the necessary repair work done."
General Motors,2017-10,"The number of U.S. vehicle recall campaigns hit a record high in 2016 for a third consecutive year, with 927 separate recalls affecting 53.2 million vehicles."
General Motors,2017-10,"That total was bloated by recalls of Takata air bag inflators, which can rupture and send deadly metal fragments flying, and are already linked to 18 deaths and more than 180 injuries worldwide. Those recalls will eventually cover about 125 million inflators, representing the largest single auto safety recall ever for a single issue."
General Motors,2017-10,"As of June, more than 65 percent of 46.2 million previously recalled Takata inflators in the United States had not been repaired."
General Motors,2017-10,"Congress gave NHTSA the authority to provide grant funding for up to six states that agreed to pilot programs to notify consumers of open recalls on their vehicles at the time of registration, but Maryland was the only state to apply."
General Motors,2017-10,"""This first-in-the-nation grant will serve as an example to the rest of the country as we continue to work across government to reach consumers in new and creative ways with potentially life-saving information about their vehicles,"" Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao said in a statement."
General Motors,2017-10,"Some automakers, including Honda Motor Co <7267.T>, whose vehicles account for 17 of the 18 reported Takata-related deaths to date, are taking additional steps to locate vehicles with the potentially dangerous inflators."

General Motors,2017-10,"WASHINGTON, Oct 27 (Reuters) - The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said Friday it was opening a preliminary investigation into 841,000 Ford Motor Co vehicles over concerns the steering wheels may get detached while the cars are in motion."
General Motors,2017-10,"The auto safety agency said it was investigating 2014-2016 model Ford Fusion cars after three reports of steering wheel bolts becoming loose, including one completely detaching as a driver attempted to turn into a gas station."
General Motors,2017-10,"Ford said in an emailed statement Friday it was cooperating ""with the agency on its investigation, as we always do."""
General Motors,2017-10,"In 2011, General Motors Co in 2011 recalled 2,100 Cruze cars because the steering wheel could detach. GM also issued a separate recall for about 150 Buick Encore SUVs in 2013 to address steering wheels that could come off."
General Motors,2017-10,"Last week, Ford said it was recalling 1.34 million 2015-17 Ford F-150 and 2017 Ford Super Duty trucks in North America to add water shields to side door latches at a cost of $267 million. The recall came after authorities in Canada asked Ford for answers in March after four reports of doors opening while people were driving."
General Motors,2017-10,"Ford has now recalled more than 5 million vehicles for varying door latch-related issues since 2016, but the company said the issue in last week's door-latch recall was different from prior ones."
General Motors,2017-10,The company has previously disclosed plans to spend $935 million on other recalls announced since August 2016.

General Motors,2017-10,"BANGKOK, Oct 27 (Reuters) - Thailand's biggest auto parts maker Thai Summit Group is looking to a pick-up in revenues from abroad as its domestic market slows, a senior company official told Reuters on Friday."
General Motors,2017-10,"""We are quite pessimistic about the Thai domestic (automobile) market,"" executive vice president Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit said in an interview."
General Motors,2017-10,"""It's growing only at about 3-5 percent"" due to high consumer debt and political uncertainty, he added."
General Motors,2017-10,Thanathorn is the son of company president and chief executive Somporn Juangroongruangkit.
General Motors,2017-10,"Foreign sources of revenue currently account for 18-20 percent of Thai Summit's sales, but it expects that ratio to reach 30 percent in 3-5 years, with plants in the United States, India and South Africa driving growth. This year, Thai Summit expects total revenue of 79 billion baht ($2.4 billion)."
General Motors,2017-10,Thanathorn said the privately-held company was looking to take advantage of the similarity in vehicles produced in Thailand and South Africa.
General Motors,2017-10,"""Car makers usually import parts from Thailand to assemble cars in South Africa,"" he said. Local operators and the South African government want to source more parts domestically, so Thai Summit's strategy is to preempt this, he added."
General Motors,2017-10,"The company will begin next year by renting a factory for light manufacturing and eventually build factories for heavier equipment by 2021, spending approximately $100-150 million."
General Motors,2017-10,"SUVs, pick-up trucks and derivatives made in South Africa also receive tax benefits when exported to Europe thanks to a trade agreement, Thanathorn said, adding the country was a window to other African markets as well in the long run."
General Motors,2017-10,"Currently, the United States accounts for over half of Thai Summit's overseas revenue. Its plants in Michigan and Kentucky are expected to bring in $500 million next year. The company is aiming for U.S. revenue to reach $1 billion within five years."
General Motors,2017-10,"Revenue from plants in India, meanwhile, is doubling each year, but from a low base of 1.5 billion baht."
General Motors,2017-10,"Anticipating future trends in the automotive industry, Thai Summit has spent over 400 million baht on testing centres and research and development of lightweight technology."
General Motors,2017-10,Thanathorn said the company was producing an aluminium chassis for U.S. electric carmaker Tesla Inc.
General Motors,2017-10,"Despite a weak domestic market, Thai auto exports are doing well, the executive said."
General Motors,2017-10,"""Thai auto exports grow with the global economy,"" he said, adding a reduction in foreign investment into the country was due to weak demand rather than any loss of competitiveness."
General Motors,2017-10,"""Cambodia, Vietnam and Myanmar do not have the capacity to pull investment away from Thailand,"" Thanathorn said, adding any investment from auto companies in Indonesia and the Philippines would be for market access rather than export capacity."
General Motors,2017-10,"Thailand is the world's 13th largest auto exporter, selling over 60 percent of vehicles produced or 1.18 million in total last year. Auto exports account for about 10 percent of the economy and in September reached a two-year high. [nL4N1MT1ZG]"
General Motors,2017-10,"Thailand was dubbed the ""Detroit of the East"" after foreign automakers, particularly Japanese companies like Toyota Motor <7203.T>, Honda Motor <7267.T> and Isuzu <7202.T> set up shop in the 1980s, while Ford , Chrysler and General Motors chose the country mainly to manufacture one-tonne pickup trucks."

General Motors,2017-10,{{20171027T110001.932+0000}}RPT-ANALYSIS-Self-driving startups race down a narrowing road(Repeats for additional clients with no changes to text)
General Motors,2017-10,"DETROIT/SAN FRANCISCO, Oct 27 (Reuters) - Lei Xu and Justin Song once worked at electric carmaker Tesla Inc , one of the hottest companies in Silicon Valley. But with interest and investments in autonomous vehicles mounting, they left to pursue what they see as the next big thing."
General Motors,2017-10,"Their company, Nullmax, is one of more than 240 startups worldwide, including 75 in Silicon Valley, attempting to design software, hardware components and systems for future self-driving cars, according to a Reuters analysis."
General Motors,2017-10,"Xu and Song are bankrolled by corporate money, but unlike many of their fellow entrepreneurs, they skipped funding from Silicon Valley venture capitalists. Founded in August 2016, Nullmax got $10 million from a Chinese firm, Xinmao Science and Technology Co <000836.SZ>."
General Motors,2017-10,"By seeking corporate backing in China, the Nullmax founders managed to sidestep an issue facing other startups in the sector: While big automotive and technology companies are pouring billions into the autonomous vehicle space, Silicon Valley investors so far have been fairly restrained in increasing their bets."
General Motors,2017-10,"Headlines have been dominated by old-line players such as General Motors Co , which jolted the industry last year when it bought a tiny San Francisco software company called Cruise Automation for a reported $1 billion. Just this week, top-tier supplier Delphi Automotive PLC acquired Boston-based software startup nuTonomy for $450 million. [nL2N1MZ0VE]"
General Motors,2017-10,"Now, ""every startup thinks they will get a billion dollars"" in valuation, said Evangelos Simoudis, a Silicon Valley venture investor and an advisor on corporate innovation."
General Motors,2017-10,"However, investment in untested startup companies remains relatively modest despite all the buzz and lofty expectations. Total funding of self-driving startups from both corporate and private investors has barely topped $5 billion, the Reuters analysis of publicly available data shows."
General Motors,2017-10,"With the notable exceptions of Andreessen Horowitz and New Enterprise Associates, few of the big Valley venture capital firms are heavily invested in the sector. Overall, only seven of the top 30 self-driving startups have received later-stage funding, the Reuters analysis shows, an indication that some venture capitalists are ambivalent about the industry's potential."
General Motors,2017-10,Skeptics note that few of the startups are making money. And established auto and parts companies have not demonstrated a clear path to revenue and profitability in autonomous vehicles despite their big bets in the space.
General Motors,2017-10,"Another sticking point: While the initial wave of self-driving vehicles is expected to begin commercial service in 2019-2020, experts expect the transition from human-driven to automated cars could take a decade or more to roll out."
General Motors,2017-10,"Cautions Sergio Marchionne, chief executive officer of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles : ""You can destroy a lot of value by chasing your tail in autonomous driving."""
General Motors,2017-10,"All told, U.S. automotive and technology firms likely have invested some $40 billion to $50 billion in self-driving technology in recent years, mainly through acquisitions and partnerships. The full extent is hard to know because big players such as Alphabet Inc , whose Waymo subsidiary is considered among the front-runners in the arena, have not revealed the full scope of their investments, although it is believed to be in the billions."
General Motors,2017-10,"Among the top corporate investors in the sector are Samsung Group [SAGR.UL], Intel Corp , Qualcomm Inc , Delphi and Robert Bosch GmbH [ROBG.UL]. Corporate investors also have backed five of the six self-driving startups with valuations of $1 billion or more."
General Motors,2017-10,"Whether the industry is poised to produce more such unicorns is now a topic of much debate. Two former investors in Cruise Automation, for example, are poles apart in their views of self-driving vehicles and technology."
General Motors,2017-10,"Veronica Wu, managing partner in Palo Alto-based Hone Capital, said her company continues to invest in ""quite a number"" of self-driving startups, while acknowledging that the technology will take time to deploy."

General Motors,2017-10,"WASHINGTON, Oct 26 (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc's self-driving car unit Waymo is expanding winter testing as it works to address a potential blind spot for autonomous vehicles: snowy and icy conditions."
General Motors,2017-10,"Waymo said Thursday that Michigan is the sixth state where the self-driving car project will test autonomous vehicles. The company chose the state to see how vehicles will respond in snow, sleet, and ice."
General Motors,2017-10,"Waymo has been testing vehicles in Texas, Arizona, Washington State, Nevada and California and starts in Michigan next week on public roads with a backup safety driver sitting in the driver seat if necessary."
General Motors,2017-10,"""For human drivers, the mix of winter conditions affects how well you can see and the way your vehicle handles the road. The same is true for self-driving cars,"" said Waymo chief executive John Krafcik in a blog post.

General Motors,2017-10,* Mazda's SPCCI engines could be used in more efficient hybrids
General Motors,2017-10,"HIROSHIMA, Japan, Oct 25 (Reuters) - In the high-stakes, high-cost battle among global automakers to develop ever more efficient vehicles, one of the biggest breakthroughs in internal combustion engine technology in years looks to be coming from one of the industry's smaller players."
General Motors,2017-10,"Japan's Mazda Motor Corp <7261.T> has zoomed past its larger global rivals to develop an engine which ignites gasoline using combustion ignition technology, a fuel-saving process considered something of a holy grail of efficient gasoline engines."
General Motors,2017-10,"As global emissions regulations get tougher, not only could Mazda's technology prolong the life of internal combustion engines, it could also improve ""greener"" engines as they can be used to produce more efficient gasoline hybrid and plug-in hybrid vehicles."
General Motors,2017-10,"Mazda will showcase the Skyactiv-X technology at the Tokyo Motor Show this week. When it launches the engine in 2019, the automaker says it will deliver as much as 30 percent fuel efficiency over its Skyactiv-G engine, already one of the most fuel efficient gasoline engines on the market."
General Motors,2017-10,"""Our resources are limited, so unlike bigger automakers, we don't have the array of options in which to invest our R&D funds,"" said Mitsuo Hitomi, managing executive officer at Mazda who oversees engine development. ""That's why we're betting on this technology ... We were determined that no matter what, we would develop this engine,"" Hitomi told Reuters in an interview at the company's headquarters in Hiroshima."
General Motors,2017-10,"Churning out around 1.6 million in annual vehicle sales, Mazda accounts for only a sliver of global car sales, and its R&D budget is roughly a tenth that of automaking giant Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T>."
General Motors,2017-10,"Many automakers with big spending budgets have invested heavily in developing a host of new powertrain technologies, including gasoline hybrids, battery electric cars and fuel cell vehicles, as fuel efficient alternatives to gasoline and diesel vehicles."
General Motors,2017-10,"But Mazda believes fuel-sipping engines are a better way to reduce carbon emissions than cars powered by fossil fuel-generated electricity, focusing on the Skyactiv-G high-compression gasoline engine, and its diesel cousin, the Skyactiv-D."
General Motors,2017-10,"Its latest technology is a variant of homogeneous charge combustion ignition (HCCI) technology, which marries the clean-burning qualities of gasoline engines and the fuel economy and grunt of diesel engines to produce an efficient, powerful engine."
General Motors,2017-10,"Mazda's engineering team began developing the engine around the time it completed developing its Skyactiv-G engine, which came out in 2011."
General Motors,2017-10,"From the start, solving the multiple variables required to balance performance with successful compression ignition was a challenge so complex and frustrating that there were ""countless times"" the team wanted to throw in the towel, Hitomi said."
General Motors,2017-10,"Engineers at General Motors , Honda Motor Co <7267.T> and other automakers have also pondered how to develop a cost-effective way to control the HCCI process, which requires precise timing inside the engine chamber to achieve efficient ignition."
General Motors,2017-10,"The process is controlled by precisely monitoring each movement in the combustion chamber, enabling visibility of when the intake valve allows air to be drawn into the chamber to when the fireball is ignited."
General Motors,2017-10,"""Kudos to them for taking the next step,"" said Paul Najt, Group Manager of Research & Development at GM, which began showing an early HCCI prototype around 2007."
General Motors,2017-10,"GM has since applied HCCI technologies to develop smaller, turbocharged engines, but Najt said the automaker was not developing a full system at the moment due to cost concerns. In the meantime, it has released gasoline hybrid and other electric models."
General Motors,2017-10,"Hitomi said Mazda's spark plug breakthrough came during a crisis point around two years ago, when the development team showed him an early rendition of the engine."
General Motors,2017-10,"""It had so many parts to it, like separate controls for variable valve timing and intake and exhaust levels, that it had become a monster of an engine,"" too costly to produce, he said."
General Motors,2017-10,"The team then ""performed massive surgery"" to simplify the engine, using a spark plug to achieve an even compression ignition process and stripping unnecessary functions."
General Motors,2017-10,"Now the Skyactiv-X engine consists of just three additional key components compared with the Skyactiv-G: in-cylinder sensors to monitor the combustion process, a high pressure fuel system to create the optimal fuel mix and a supercharger."
General Motors,2017-10,"The cost of the new engine ""falls somewhere between a gasoline and diesel engine"", Hitomi says."
General Motors,2017-10,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology Prof. William Green, who has worked with HCCI development teams at U.S. automakers, said Skyactiv-X's efficiency gains may be limited compared with hybrids and the even larger longer-term potential benefits of EVs."
General Motors,2017-10,"But the automaker could win over customers looking for an inexpensive, fuel-saving option which does not require battery recharging time or infrastructure, he added."
General Motors,2017-10,"""It has the advantage of being simple and straight forward, not expensive, and practical. Those are a lot of advantages."""

General Motors,2017-10,"DETROIT, Oct 24 (Reuters) - General Motors Co posted stronger-than-expected pre-tax profit for the third quarter on Tuesday, helped by cost-cutting and a shift to higher-margin trucks and sport utility vehicles, and its shares jumped to a record high."
General Motors,2017-10,"GM reported a net loss due to charges related to the sale of its European operations, but the automaker's operating results beat Wall Street expectations and the company reaffirmed a forecast that 2017 financial results would be in line with last year's record performance."
General Motors,2017-10,The automaker also assured investors it was on track to cut stocks of unsold vehicles in the U.S. to a manageable 70-days' supply by the end of the year.
General Motors,2017-10,"GM, rival Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV , and heavy machinery maker Caterpillar Inc all are benefiting from a strong U.S. economy, continued growth in China and a recovery in demand from Latin America."
General Motors,2017-10,"In the case of the automakers, U.S. car and light truck sales have so far defied predictions of a significant slump. September sales hit the fastest pace in 12 years as residents of Texas and Florida rushed to replace cars damaged by storms. [nL2N1ME0OD] [nL8N1MZ44E]"
General Motors,2017-10,"The latest results sent GM shares up 2.3 percent to the highest levels since its initial public offering in 2010, amid a broad rally by U.S. manufacturing stocks. [nL2N1MZ0QZ]"
General Motors,2017-10,GM over the past several months has regained its status as the largest U.S. automaker by market capitalization over electric luxury car maker Tesla Inc .
General Motors,2017-10,"Some of GM's share price surge has come from investors betting on its investments in self-driving and electric cars. The company's profits, however, are driven entirely by demand for its petrol-fueled trucks and SUVs in North America, and its growing sales in China."
General Motors,2017-10,"The No. 1 U.S. automaker said it expects U.S. vehicle sales to remain stable at an annual pace of about 17 million light vehicles in 2017, ""and we expect that in 2018 as well,"" GM Chief Financial Officer Chuck Stevens told reporters on Tuesday."
General Motors,2017-10,"The U.S. auto industry has been coming off a strong run of sales that culminated in a record 17.55 million units in 2016. Industry analysts have predicted a slight decline for U.S. new car sales in 2017, driven in part by a flood of nearly-new, low-mileage off-lease vehicles into the market."
General Motors,2017-10,"GM's share price has risen nearly 30 percent this year, in part as the company has highlighted efforts to put self-driving cars on the road. However, spending on autonomous vehicles and ride services amounted to just $150 million in the latest quarter, the company indicated in its financial report."
General Motors,2017-10,"GM posted lower revenue for the quarter as it shuttered plants in North America to reduce production and tackle bloated inventory levels, especially of unpopular sedan models as consumers move increasingly to pickup trucks, SUVs and crossovers."
General Motors,2017-10,"GM had 76 days' supply of unsold vehicles at the end of September, down from 88 days a month earlier and over 100 in the summer. The company's wholesale volumes were down 26 percent versus the same quarter in 2016."
General Motors,2017-10,"GM is taming its inventory problem in the United States in part by laying off about 3,100 temporary and full-time hourly workers, mainly at factories that build compact and midsize sedans. The rapid shift by U.S. consumers to SUVs and pickup trucks in response to low, stable gasoline prices has left GM with too many North American factories tooled to produce low-profit sedans, analysts said. [nL4N1MN4NU]"
General Motors,2017-10,GM showed a pre-tax profit in North America despite the steep production cuts and heavy discounts. Stevens credited cost-cutting and a shift to higher-profit trucks and sport utility vehicles. The company cut North American production costs by $2 billion during the first nine months of 2017.
General Motors,2017-10,GM posted a quarterly net loss on Tuesday due to charges stemming from the sale of its Opel unit in Europe to France's Peugeot SA .

General Motors,2017-10,"NEW YORK, Oct 24 (Reuters Breakingviews) - General Motors is getting there. But getting there isn't the same as arriving. Production cuts and surging post-hurricane vehicle sales are helping the $66 bln automaker right-size its U.S. operations, while growth accelerated in China and even Latin America moved into the black.

General Motors,2017-10,"WASHINGTON, Oct 24 (Reuters) - Major automakers, suppliers and auto dealers are launching a new coalition on Tuesday to urge U.S. President Donald Trump not to withdraw from the North American Free Trade Agreement."
General Motors,2017-10,"Auto trade associations representing General Motors Co Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T>, Volkswagen AG , Hyundai Motor Co <005380.KS>, Ford Motor Co and nearly every other major automaker, are part of the coalition dubbed ""Driving American Jobs"" and backing an advertising campaign to convince the White House and voters that the agreement has been crucial in boosting U.S. automotive sector production and jobs."
General Motors,2017-10,"Trump has threatened to withdraw from the trade deal with U.S., Canada and Mexico, which is heavily utilized by automakers who have production and supply chains spread across the three countries."
General Motors,2017-10,"In the most recent round of talks to renegotiate NAFTA last week, Trump proposed changes to the rules of origin for autos, which are used to determine how much of an auto is made in a certain place. The proposed rules were viewed as untenable for automakers, as well as Mexico and Canada."
General Motors,2017-10,"The auto industry joins the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and other large business groups that have become more vocal in recent weeks about Trump's efforts to change the 23-year-old accord, saying they would be detrimental to American jobs."
General Motors,2017-10,"The auto coalition, which includes the Motor & Equipment Manufacturers Association and American International Automobile Dealers Association, said ending NAFTA, which underpins $1.2 trillion in annual trade between the three countries, would put U.S. auto sector jobs at risk."
General Motors,2017-10,They pointed to $9.5 billion in new investments announced this year by the auto and auto parts sector and feature the personal stories of auto sector employees throughout America - from plant workers to auto dealership personnel.
General Motors,2017-10,"""We need you to tell your elected officials that you don't change the game in the middle of a comeback. We're winning with NAFTA,"" the group said on its website."
General Motors,2017-10,"The campaign comes amid rising concern that the Trump administration could opt early next year to withdraw after giving six months notice, a move that could expose automakers to high tariffs who are building trucks in Mexico and impose new tariffs on parts and cars made throughout North America."
General Motors,2017-10,"President Donald Trump told the Fox Business Network in an interview that aired Sunday he thinks the deal will ""probably"" be renegotiated, but said he will withdraw if it is not fair. ""We can't allow the world to look at us as a whipping post. Not going to happen anymore,"" Trump said."
General Motors,2017-10,"The Chamber of Commerce accused the Trump administration of trying to sabotage the talks with ""poison pill proposals,"" including demands for more favorable treatment for the U.S. side on car production, and a ""sunset clause"" to force regular negotiations. [nL2N1MM0LE]"
General Motors,2017-10,"U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said earlier this month the Trump administration was focused on trying to get an agreement that was fair but said he had ""seen no indication that our partners are willing to make any changes that will result in a rebalancing and a reduction in these huge trade deficits."""
General Motors,2017-10,"Under NAFTA, at least 62.5 percent of the material in a car or light truck made in the region must be from North America to be able to enter the marketplace tariff-free."

General Motors,2017-10,"The automaker wants the Federal Maritime Commission to order payments from Wallenius Wilhelmsen Logistics AS and its sister company EUKOR Car Carriers Inc [EUKOR.UL], Nippon Yusen Kabushiki Kaisha <9101.T>, Mitsui O.S.K. Lines Ltd <9104.T>, Compania Sud Americana de Vapores , Hoegh Autoliners AS and affiliated companies. Fiat Chrysler filed its complaint on Oct. 17."
General Motors,2017-10,"The auto maker said it and its corporate predecessors have purchased ""hundreds of millions of dollars"" in delivery services and none of the firms have compensated it or other victims ""of their illegal activities."""
General Motors,2017-10,"All but one of the shippers sued by Fiat Chrysler pleaded guilty and admitted to price fixing as part of a Justice Department investigation. The remaining firm, Hoegh, agreed last month to plead guilty and pay a $21 million criminal fine. To date, four shipping executives have also pleaded guilty in the government's probe, which began in 2012"
General Motors,2017-10,"Fiat Chrysler said the companies and ""unnamed conspirators have conspired since 1997 to suppress competition"" in shipping cargo. The Italian-American automaker said they entered into contracts that resulted in Fiat Chrysler ""paying far more"" than if there were a competitive market and that the shipping companies made illegal agreements to ""allocate customers and routes, rig bids, and fix, stabilize, and maintain"" prices."
General Motors,2017-10,"The companies failed to disclose these agreements to the Maritime Commission as a 1984 law requires, FCA said. Other companies, including auto and truck dealers, sued shippers in 2016 before the Maritime Commission but those cases are also pending."
General Motors,2017-10,"A number of lawsuits, including from General Motors Co , were filed under a different legal theory in federal courts starting in 2013. But a federal appeals court ruled in January that the shippers were immune from antitrust lawsuits under the 1984 law. The Supreme Court declined to hear the case earlier this month."

General Motors,2017-10,{{20171023T020718.326+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-Tesla could hit second gear with Shanghai factory(The authors are Reuters Breakingviews columnists. The opinions expressed are their own.)
General Motors,2017-10,"NEW YORK/WASHINGTON, Oct 23 (Reuters Breakingviews) - A factory in Shanghai could help Tesla shift into second gear. It would give Elon Musk's $58 billion electric-car company a better shot at catching up to or keeping pace with rivals in the fast-growing market. Any deal, though, is apt to have some roadblocks."
General Motors,2017-10,"China presents a large but perplexing opportunity for all foreign automakers. The country is now the biggest market for passenger cars. Though growth has been slowing, sales increased 3.3 percent in September from a year ago. Worsening air quality, however, has prompted Beijing to consider a possible ban on gasoline-only cars."
General Motors,2017-10,"Many customers for now prefer gas-guzzling SUVs. And there are plenty of domestic competitors developing battery technology, such as Anhui Zotye Automobile <000980.SZ>, which recently struck an alliance with Ford . Tesla, for all its U.S. hype, has just around a 3 percent share of China's electric-vehicle market. It faces competition from Volvo , which is scrapping petrol-only vehicles from 2019, Daimler and General Motors ."
General Motors,2017-10,"There are nagging problems at home, too. Tesla produced just 260 of its new Model 3s in the third quarter, far short of the more than 1,500 that were targeted. Musk talked of ""production hell"" on the road to building half a million vehicles next year, or roughly five times as many as the company is likely to manage in 2017. A factory in China should in theory alleviate some of the strain, while reducing costs and customer wait times."
General Motors,2017-10,"The manufacturing facility deal reported by the Wall Street Journal on Sunday would not alleviate a core problem, however. Cars produced in a factory wholly owned and located within Shanghai's free trade zone probably will be subject to the country's 25 percent import tax."
General Motors,2017-10,"The only way to evade the levy would be a joint venture with a Chinese partner. Tesla, an unprofitable enterprise currently valued at 30 times expected EBITDA for the next year, so far has been reluctant to tie such a knot because of legitimate concerns about technology transfer. And yet it's hard to imagine how its mass-market models can be competitive in China with the tariff included. As useful as a local factory would be, it may give Tesla limited acceleration."
General Motors,2017-10,"- Tesla has reached an agreement with Shanghai officials to set up a manufacturing facility in the city's free trade zone, according a Wall Street Journal report published on Oct. 22, citing unnamed sources."
General Motors,2017-10,"- The electric-car company said in June that it would ""clearly define"" its production plans in China by the end of the year. According to the news report, Tesla would likely still face 25 percent import duties on its factory-produced cars sold in China."

General Motors,2017-10,"""My impression is that many problems are due to the fact that things are out of proportion at Opel, that they consume too much energy, that processes are not efficient enough,"" Tavares said in an interview published on Friday in Die Welt."

General Motors,2017-10,"PSA is in the process of integrating Opel after buying it from General Motors , a task which analysts say will lead to sweeping job cuts."
General Motors,2017-10,"PSA, which has already said it will use its own technology and vehicle platforms for future Opel models, will fund programmes planned for the unit's headquarters in Ruesselsheim, Germany, only when convinced they will make money, Tavares added."
General Motors,2017-10,Existing development plans in place at Opel were simply not enough to make the company successful.
General Motors,2017-10,"""A strategy has been pursued that simply did not work. And now we are facing the danger that Opel will not be able to meet the emissions ceilings that will come into force in 2020. This is extremely serious and extremely dangerous for the company,"" Tavares was quoted saying."
General Motors,2017-10,"PSA has already said it would cut about 400 jobs at the Ellesmere Port plant of Vauxhall, the British brand also acquired along with Opel from GM. [nL8N1MO646]"

General Motors,2017-10,"SYDNEY, Oct 20 (Reuters) - Australia's near 100-year automotive industry ended on Friday as GM Holden Ltd, a unit of U.S. carmaker General Motors Co , closed its plant in South Australia to move manufacturing to cheaper locations."
General Motors,2017-10,"The closure comes a year after Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T> and Ford Motor Co similarly moved out, eliminating thousands of manufacturing jobs. It adds pressure on the government to help those made redundant find work in a battleground state ahead of a federal election in 18 months."
General Motors,2017-10,"""The end of Holden making cars in Australia is a very sad day for the workers and for every Australian. It is the end of an era,"" Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull told reporters at a regular briefing on Friday. ""Everyone has a Holden story."""
General Motors,2017-10,Turnbull has sought to soften the impact of a declining automotive industry in a state which historically determines who forms government by making South Australia a defence industry hub.
General Motors,2017-10,"The government plans to increase defence spending by nearly A$30 billion ($23.52 billion) by 2022, with the manufacture of a fleet of frigates, armoured personnel carriers and submarines to be concentrated in South Australia."

General Motors,2017-10,"The round was led by CapitalG, the growth investment fund of Alphabet that has also backed large private tech companies such as home-renting platform Airbnb and payments firm Stripe.

General Motors,2017-10,"The largest U.S. automaker had previously paid about $2.5 billion in penalties and settlements over faulty ignition switches that could cause engines to stall and prevent airbags from deploying in crashes. The defect has been linked to 124 deaths and 275 injuries, and prompted a recall that began in February 2014 of 2.6 million vehicles."
General Motors,2017-10,GM spokesman David Caldwell said the Detroit automaker had reached a settlement with states over the more than 3-year-old consumer protection investigations.
General Motors,2017-10,"""GM will continue ongoing improvements it's made to ensure the safety of its vehicles,"" Caldwell said. These include retaining a new organizational structure devoted to global vehicle safety and a program that encourages employees to speak up about possible safety issues."
General Motors,2017-10,"New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said in a statement GM had ""turned a blind eye for years and chose to conceal the safety defects associated with several models of their vehicles."""
General Motors,2017-10,"Under the settlement, GM dealers must not sell certified pre-owned vehicles with uncompleted recalls, and is required to have a team to ""improve and enhance recall awareness to car owners with open recalls."""
General Motors,2017-10,Some states said they would use settlement funds to investigate and prosecute future deceptive practices.
General Motors,2017-10,"In 2015, GM paid $900 million to settle a U.S. Justice Department criminal investigation and agreed to three years of oversight by an independent monitor after being charged with wire fraud."
General Motors,2017-10,"No individuals were charged, but Chief Executive Mary Barra fired 15 people, including eight executives, over the issue. Barra said last week the ignition recall was ""a moment in time where the company committed deeply to safety."""
General Motors,2017-10,"The states said GM knew as early as 2004 that the ignition switch posed a safety defect because it could cause airbag non-deployment, but company officials decided it was not a safety concern and delayed recalls."
General Motors,2017-10,The issue prompted an industrywide jump in recalls in 2014 to an all-time high and cast a spotlight on GM's safety record as Barra testified before the U.S. Congress.

General Motors,2017-10,"Electric cars do away with many of the mechanical systems that prompt consumer complaints about conventional cars, the magazine said. Tesla Inc's Model 3, despite recent production problems, should have ""average"" reliability because it relies on technology already used on the older Tesla Model S, Jake Fisher, the magazine's head of automotive testing said on Thursday at a meeting of the Detroit Automotive Press Association."
General Motors,2017-10,"The Bolt is the most reliable car in General Motors Co's Chevrolet brand, he said."
General Motors,2017-10,"Tesla in a statement on Thursday criticized Consumer Reports because it previously declared the Model S ""to be the best car ever and then revoked the rating after being questioned by Tesla skeptics."" As for the Model 3, Tesla said ""it's important to note that Consumer Reports has not yet driven a Model 3, let alone do they know anything substantial about how the Model 3 was designed and engineered."""
General Motors,2017-10,"The magazine's annual survey of new vehicle reliability predicts which cars will give owners fewer or more problems than their competitors, based on data collected. Its scorecard is influential among consumers and industry executives."
General Motors,2017-10,"For the fifth straight year, Japanese automaker Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T> placed first in the magazine's ranking with the most reliable vehicles on average. General Motors Co's Cadillac brand was last among 27 brands ranked. Tesla ranked 21st on the list."
General Motors,2017-10,"With many new cars, customers complain about problems with continuously variable transmissions and eight- and nine-speed gear boxes designed to boost fuel mileage, Fisher said."
General Motors,2017-10,"Hard to use infotainment systems also continue to annoy customers, Fisher said. But over-the-air updates are helping automakers alleviate problems more quickly, he said."

General Motors,2017-10,"The magazine said its survey of 640,000 vehicles showed that all-new vehicles or models with newly updated technology are more likely than older models to have a wonky engine, a jerky transmission, or high-tech features that fail outright."
General Motors,2017-10,"The magazine's annual survey of new vehicle reliability predicts which cars will give owners fewer or more problems than their competitors, based on data collected. Its scorecard is influential among consumers and industry executives."
General Motors,2017-10,"For the fifth straight year, Japanese automaker Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T> placed first in the magazine's ranking with the most reliable vehicles on average. General Motors Co's Cadillac brand was last among 27 brands ranked. Tesla ranked 21st on the list."
General Motors,2017-10,"The magazine's prediction that the Tesla Model 3, which has faced production bottlenecks, will have average reliability illustrates the challenges automakers face."
General Motors,2017-10,"The Model 3 is the luxury electric vehicle maker's newest car, and Consumer Reports said it had no data on the vehicle. But it relies largely on technology the carmaker has used on its Model S sedan, which has been in production since 2012, and Consumer Reports said predicted reliability for that car is now ""above average."""
General Motors,2017-10,"""Electric vehicles are inherently less complicated than gasoline or hybrid alternatives. The Model 3 is the least complicated Tesla yet,"" Consumer Reports said."
General Motors,2017-10,"With many new cars, customers complain about problems with continuously variable transmissions and eight- and nine-speed gear boxes designed to boost fuel mileage, the magazine said."
General Motors,2017-10,Hard to use infotainment systems also continue to annoy customers. Consumer Reports said its survey found that owners of models in the first year of production reported twice as many complaints about vehicle electronics.
General Motors,2017-10,"""More often than not, our data suggests it's prudent for consumers to wait for the technology to mature,"" Jake Fisher, head of Consumer Reports auto testing, said in a statement ahead of a presentation in Detroit."
General Motors,2017-10,"Automakers are moving quickly to fix problems, the magazine said. After Korean automaker Hyundai Motor Co <005380.KS> got hit with complaints about the transmission on its 2016 Hyundai Tucson sport utility vehicle, the company took action that reduced complaints about the 2017 model by more than half, Consumer Reports said."
General Motors,2017-10,"In July, Consumer Reports restored a top rating in its class for Tesla's Model S after the company updated the braking system. [nL3N1KG4MF]"

General Motors,2017-10,"Laguna Beach, Calif., Oct 17 (Reuters) - After a series of acquisitions, General Motors Co has the building blocks it needs to deploy a large-scale fleet of robot cars, the automaker's president said on Tuesday."
General Motors,2017-10,"GM's acquisition earlier this month of LIDAR technology company Strobe may have been the final missing piece, GM President Dan Ammann told Reuters. More acquisitions are unlikely, as Ammann said GM's autonomous business is, for the moment, complete.[nL4N1MK2NZ]"
General Motors,2017-10,"""We feel pretty good about what we have,"" he said."
General Motors,2017-10,"Since buying San Francisco self-driving car startup Cruise GM last year for a price that could total about $1 billion, GM has accelerated efforts to build both autonomous driving software and mass produce electric cars that can pilot themselves. GM has indicated that it could start testing robot taxi services within two to three years."
General Motors,2017-10,"Investors have responded by pushing GM's stock to $45 a share recently, up 29 percent from the beginning of the year."
General Motors,2017-10,"""By having all those capabilities under our control and making sure we have the ability to do that is enabling us to move really quickly,"" said Ammann, who spoke on stage at The Wall Street Journal DLive conference in Southern California and with Reuters on the conference sidelines Tuesday."
General Motors,2017-10,"Ammann said GM is focused on building large autonomous fleets, and he rejected the idea, put forward by some analysts, that GM could spin off its autonomous vehicle unit or Maven, the app-based car-sharing business."
General Motors,2017-10,"""The unique advantage is having all capability under one roof,"" Ammann said."
General Motors,2017-10,"As to when GM's autonomous cars will be ready for prime time, Ammann was elusive. ""We will see some pretty interesting developments"" by 2021, he said."
General Motors,2017-10,"Nearly two years after GM struck a partnership with Lyft Inc, and invested $500 million into the ride-services company, the future of that relationship remains unclear."
General Motors,2017-10,"""Everybody is better off having worked together,"" said Ammann, and pointed to the success of Express Drive, a program through which Lyft drivers can rent cars from Maven."
General Motors,2017-10,"But there are no firm plans for the partnership going forward. Lyft in July formed a self-driving car division to build its own autonomous car systems, becoming something of a competitor to GM."
General Motors,2017-10,"Whether GM will collaborate with Lyft on those efforts is ""not defined at this time,"" Ammann said."
General Motors,2017-10,"Lyft last month formed an alliance with GM's arch-rival, Ford Motor Co , to deploy self-driving Ford vehicles in its fleet. [nL2N1M80X2]"

General Motors,2017-10,"The deal would create a C$300 million ($239.5 million) fund for workers in the event GM ever decides to close CAMI, and employees would have to be offered early retirement incentives in the case of layoffs, plant chair Mike Van Boekel told Reuters in a telephone interview."

General Motors,2017-10,"{{20171016T102603.750+0000}}Toyota to test self-driving, talking cars by about 2020TOKYO, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T> on Monday said it would begin testing self-driving electric cars around 2020, which will use artificial intelligence (AI) to engage with drivers, as the company competes with tech firms to develop new vehicles."
General Motors,2017-10,"The car, whose concept model was unveiled earlier this year at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, will be able to converse with drivers, while building up knowledge of users' preferences, habits and emotions through deep learning, the company said."
General Motors,2017-10,"""By using AI technology, we want to expand and enhance the driving experience, making cars an object of affection again,"" said Makoto Okabe, general manager of Toyota's EV business planning division."
General Motors,2017-10,"Facing competition from rival automakers and tech companies to produce self-driving, intelligent cars, Toyota has committed $1 billion through 2020 to develop advanced automated driving and AI technology."
General Motors,2017-10,"The Concept-i model, a battery-electric car which will have a cruising range of 300 kilometres (180 miles) on a single charge, will be able to estimate the emotions and alertness of drivers by reading their expressions, actions and tone of voice."
General Motors,2017-10,"Using this information, the vehicle will be able to take over driving responsibilities when necessary -- after assessing the driver is too tired to drive safely, for example -- and also interact with the driver and passengers."
General Motors,2017-10,"Facing a future where car ownership may be overtaken by new mobility services, automakers are ramping up investment to develop AI capabilities to enhance the driving experience."
General Motors,2017-10,"Ford Motor Co earlier this year invested $1 billion in Argo AI, a start-up set up by former employees of Uber Technologies' self-driving car development team, to develop an on-demand self-driving car service. General Motors Co has also been investing in AI start-ups."

General Motors,2017-10,"TORONTO, Oct 13 (Reuters) - General Motors Co said on Friday it reached a tentative labor agreement with striking workers at its CAMI plant in Canada, ending an almost month-old dispute."
General Motors,2017-10,"Some 2,500 workers at the CAMI plant in Ingersoll, in southern Ontario, walked off the job on Sept. 18 after the U.S. automaker rejected a union call to designate the factory as lead production site for the Chevrolet Equinox model in North America. [nL4N1LZ1PX]"
General Motors,2017-10,"""These members have shown incredible courage and strength by standing up for good jobs and a secure future for their families and their community,"" Jerry Dias, president of Unifor National, the main union leading the contract talks, said in a statement."
General Motors,2017-10,"""This strike has shown all of Canada why a renewed North American Free Trade Agreement must address the needs of working people first,"" he said."
General Motors,2017-10,"The agreement is subject to member ratification, and Unifor said details of the deal will not be released until after the vote is held. The ratification vote has not yet been scheduled."
General Motors,2017-10,"This week, the dispute ratcheted up when GM warned the union that it would start winding down production at the CAMI plant and ramp up output of the popular Equinox SUV at two plants in Mexico unless workers called off their strike. [nL2N1MN05J]"

General Motors,2017-10,"ARLINGTON, Va., Oct 13 (Reuters) - The Trump administration is demanding the use of North American-made steel, aluminum, copper and plastic resins in cars and trucks sold under North American Free Trade Agreement rules, as it seeks to give U.S. industry a boost."
General Motors,2017-10,"People briefed on the matter said U.S. negotiators issued the proposal, which could force automakers to shift sourcing of some components to North America from Asia, during talks on Friday to overhaul NAFTA."
General Motors,2017-10,"It calls for the inclusion of steel, aluminum and other raw materials on a so-called NAFTA tracing list for auto parts, according to the sources, referring to the mechanism by which the regional content level of cars, trucks and large engines is monitored and verified under the trade agreement."
General Motors,2017-10,"The list would be greatly expanded under the U.S. proposal to cover a vast and complex web of automotive components, essentially eliminating the concept of ""deemed originating,"" under which parts not listed get a free pass to tariff-free NAFTA access, no matter their origin."
General Motors,2017-10,"In addition to the metals and plastics, the list would now include sophisticated automotive electronics, electric vehicle batteries and other parts not on the tracing list because they did not exist when NAFTA was negotiated by Canada, Mexico and the United States in the early 1990s."
General Motors,2017-10,"If Washington prevails, the components would now need to be sourced from North America to count toward proposed sharply higher content levels, or companies would need to pay U.S. tariffs of around 2.5 percent on them."
General Motors,2017-10,"People briefed on the U.S. proposal said it would lift the regional content threshold to 85 percent from the current 62.5 percent, with a 50 percent minimum U.S. content level. [nL2N1MO0U5]"
General Motors,2017-10,A spokeswoman for the U.S. Trade Representative's office declined to comment on the auto industry proposal.
General Motors,2017-10,"U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross has vowed to close ""loopholes"" in the parts list that he says allow too many cheap auto parts from Asia and other regions to enter the United States."
General Motors,2017-10,Ross has already sought to protect the U.S. steel and aluminum industries from subsidized imports with national security reviews that could lead to import restrictions.
General Motors,2017-10,Steel industry trade groups from all three NAFTA countries in June issued a joint statement calling for any renewal of the trade pact to require North American steel use in manufactured goods. [nL1N1J21D1]
General Motors,2017-10,"However, two people briefed on the talks said the U.S. proposal stops short of labor unions' call for ""melted and poured"" North American steel, which would have precluded the use of raw steel from elsewhere that has been rolled or otherwise processed on the continent."
General Motors,2017-10,Automakers in North America largely already use North American steel but currently get no content value credit for it. Adding it to the tracing list would get a typical vehicle hundreds of dollars closer to meeting the goal.
General Motors,2017-10,"But any such gains would be offset largely by the higher overall content thresholds and the need to find other sources for electronics, said Kristin Dziczek, a trade and labor economist with the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Michigan."
General Motors,2017-10,"Dziczek and auto industry groups say that the U.S. content proposal was likely to backfire, with automakers and suppliers simply choosing to pay the 2.5 percent U.S. tariffs for passenger cars and many parts, sourcing more of them from China or other Asian countries."
General Motors,2017-10,"""That could be the preferred trading route if NAFTA becomes too strict,"" she added."
General Motors,2017-10,UPDATE 1-PSA says to cut about 400 jobs at Vauxhall's Ellesmere Port - Reuters News
General Motors,2017-10,"PARIS, Oct 13 (Reuters) - French carmaker PSA on Friday said it would cut about 400 jobs at Vauxhall's Ellesmere Port in Britain by the end of the year to improve the production facility's competitiveness."
General Motors,2017-10,"PSA acquired the Opel and Vauxhall brands from General Motors Co in August, helping the carmaker leapfrog French rival Renault SA to become Europe's second-ranked carmaker by sales."
General Motors,2017-10,"""Facing challenging European market conditions and a declining passenger car market, Vauxhall needs to adjust production volumes at its Ellesmere Port production facility to the current level of demand and to improve its performance, in order to protect its future,"" a PSA spokesman told Reuters."
General Motors,2017-10,The spokesman said the 400 job cuts - which amount to about a quarter of the facility's staff - would be carried out via a voluntary redundancy plan.
General Motors,2017-10,This and a move towards a single-shift operation will be discussed with employees representatives over a 45-day period.
General Motors,2017-10,"PSA is committed to the Opel Astra plant at Ellesmere Port, the spokesman added, while pointing that current manufacturing costs there were ""significantly higher"" than those of the benchmark plants of the PSA Group in France."
General Motors,2017-10,PSA's Chief Executive Carlos Tavares had said last month that it was hard to decide upon the group's strategy for Vauxhall given lack of clarity over Britain's plans to leave the European Union.
General Motors,2017-10,The spokesman on Friday said PSA would be in a position to consider future investments once it has visibility on Britain's future trading relationship with the EU and once the plant's competitiveness has been addressed.

General Motors,2017-10,"WASHINGTON, Oct 13 (Reuters) - The Trump administration is seeking to use NAFTA to boost the U.S. steel and other basic materials industries by proposing stricter automotive content rules that require the use of North American-made steel, aluminum, copper and plastic resins."
General Motors,2017-10,Three people who were briefed on the matter said that the U.S. rules of origin proposal would put these materials on the North American Free Trade Agreement's auto parts tracing list for the first time.
General Motors,2017-10,The list is used to verify the regional content level of vehicles and parts so that they can qualify for tariff-free shipment to all three NAFTA countries.
General Motors,2017-10,"U.S. negotiators submitted their rules of origin proposal to Mexican and Canadian counterparts on Friday. Other sources briefed on the talks said the proposal includes raising the threshold for overall North American value content for cars, trucks and large engines to 85 percent from the current 62.5 percent and a first-ever U.S.-specific content requirement of 50 percent. [nL2N1MO0U5]"
General Motors,2017-10,A spokeswoman for the U.S. Trade Represntative's office declined to comment on the autos proposal.

General Motors,2017-10,"In some ways, the proposed steel, aluminum, copper and plastics requirement would help vehicle and parts makers meet the higher thresholds. Auto plants in North America already largely use North American steel and aluminum, but the metals' value does not count towards reaching the threshold because it is not on the tracing list."
General Motors,2017-10,"But the bigger problem is that President Donald Trump's administration also wants the auto parts tracing list expanded to include many components in modern cars and trucks that did not exist when NAFTA was first negotiated in the early 1990s, such as sophisticated electronics that largely come from Asia."

General Motors,2017-10,"WASHINGTON, Oct 12 (Reuters) - A bipartisan pair of Michigan lawmakers introduced a bill to make it easier for automakers to comply with federal fuel efficiency requirements, as the Trump administration considers softening standards that require nearly doubling the fuel economy of the U.S. new vehicle fleet by 2025."
General Motors,2017-10,"The proposal, introduced late on Wednesday, would extend the life of fuel economy credits that would currently expire after five years, lift a cap on transferring credits between car and truck fleets and award automakers credits for emissions reductions not measured by existing test procedures."
General Motors,2017-10,"The measure proposed by Representatives Fred Upton, a Republican, and Debbie Dingell, a Democrat, would also grant an industry wish by requiring that the Environmental Protection Agency and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration reconcile their respective fuel economy standards so the industry can comply with just one set of rules."
General Motors,2017-10,"The proposal comes on the heels of a bipartisan measure to create a single federal standard for self-driving cars, also backed by the industry, that is on track to passage. [nL2N1MF0XY]"
General Motors,2017-10,The Union of Concerned Scientists said the harmonization legislation and a similar bill introduced in the Senate would allow manufacturers to make vehicles that are on average 3 miles a gallon less efficient in 2021.
General Motors,2017-10,"The group estimated that would result in additional U.S. oil consumption of 350 million barrels of oil, costing drivers $34 billion and an additional 155 million metric tons of greenhouse gases."

The group noted there were significant differences between how the EPA and NHTSA award and allow use of credits."

General Motors,2017-10,"LONDON, Oct 12 (Reuters) - The university city of Oxford has unveiled plans to ban petrol and diesel cars from its centre as part of the most radical set of proposals so far in Britain to curb pollution."
General Motors,2017-10,"Whilst London is rolling out an ""ultra low emission zone"", which will see the most gas-guzzling vehicles pay daily charges to enter the city centre from 2020, Oxford's ""Zero Emission Zone"" will ban emitting vehicles from entering part of the city centre from that date."
General Motors,2017-10,"Since German carmaker Volkswagen admitted in 2015 to cheating U.S. emissions tests, politicians around the world have unveiled plans to clamp down on diesel vehicles in a bid to improve air quality and meet more stringent targets."
General Motors,2017-10,"""All of us who drive or use petrol or diesel vehicles through Oxford are contributing to the city's toxic air,"" said city council board member John Tanner."
General Motors,2017-10,Oxford will also introduce reduced parking fees for electric vehicles and electric-taxi ranks.
General Motors,2017-10,"In the first stage of its plans from 2020, taxis, cars, light commercial vehicles and buses which are non zero-emission, will be banned from six streets in the city centre, including near the world-famous Oxford Union debating society."

General Motors,2017-10,"BEIJING, Oct 12 (Reuters) - China's vehicles sales rose in September for a fourth straight month, an industry body said on Thursday, but added that the market may struggle to hit a forecast for 5 percent annual growth set earlier in the year."
General Motors,2017-10,"The world's largest auto market may not hit growth levels estimated by the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers in January, ""but 4 percent and above should be pretty much a sure thing"", said Shi Jianhua, CAAM's deputy secretary general."
General Motors,2017-10,"Vehicle sales in China have rebounded since June, but CAAM's caution on full-year growth underlines challenges in the market, which saw a slow start to the year due to tax incentives on smaller-engined cars being phased out."
General Motors,2017-10,"China vehicle sales touched 2.71 million units in September, up 5.7 percent from a year ago, CAAM data showed."
General Motors,2017-10,"That took year-to-date sales to 20.2 million vehicles, up 4.5 percent against the same period in 2016. Vehicle sales in the country rose 13.7 percent last year."
General Motors,2017-10,"Recent sales have been relatively strong - growing 5.3 percent in August, 6.2 percent in July and 4.5 percent in June - underpinned by stronger overall economic growth and increased incentives for buyers, market watchers said."

General Motors,2017-10,"Ford Motor Co , set to report September sales later this week, has lagged its global peers in China this year."
General Motors,2017-10,"CAAM data showed sales of new energy vehicles (NEV) shot up 79.1 percent in September amid a government push to support the sector and shift away from traditional petrol engine cars in the long term.

General Motors,2017-10,"The company has found possible further cases of tampering, the CEO said, including in overseas operations."
General Motors,2017-10,"The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry ordered Kobe Steel to report on the results of safety checks within about two weeks and the reasons for the tampering, along with prevention measures in under a month."
General Motors,2017-10,"He said he was not expecting to see recalls of cars or airplanes for now and none of the company's customers have cancelled orders. Kobe Steel has no plans to sell assets at the moment, Kawasaki said."

General Motors,2017-10,"DETROIT, Oct 9 (Reuters) - No. 1 U.S. automaker General Motors Co said on Monday it would buy Strobe Inc, which uses LIDAR technology to help self-driving cars identify objects at a distance, to boost its push into the market for self-driving vehicles."
General Motors,2017-10,"LIDAR is one of the major sensor technologies used in autonomous vehicles. There is fierce competition between large automakers to bring autonomous, or self-driving, vehicles to market first."
General Motors,2017-10,Fully self-driving vehicles are expected to hit the market in a limited form by around 2020. GM and its U.S. rival Ford Motor Co have both publicly stated that they aim to have fully self-driving cars on sale by 2021.
General Motors,2017-10,"""Strobe's LIDAR technology will significantly improve the cost and capabilities of our vehicles so that we can more quickly accomplish our mission to deploy driverless vehicles at scale,"" Kyle Vogt, chief executive of GM's Cruise Automation unit, said in a statement."
General Motors,2017-10,GM did not say how much it was paying for Strobe.

General Motors,2017-10,"DETROIT, Oct 9 (Reuters) - No. 1 U.S. automaker General Motors Co said on Monday it would buy Strobe Inc, which uses LIDAR technology to help self-driving cars identify objects at a distance, to speed up development of autonomous vehicles and slash sensor costs."
General Motors,2017-10,"LIDAR is one of the major sensor technologies used in autonomous, or self-driving vehicles, and there is fierce competition between large automakers to bring the cars to market first."
General Motors,2017-10,"Fully self-driving vehicles are expected to hit the market in a limited form by around 2020. GM and its U.S. rival Ford Motor Co have both publicly stated that they aim to have fully self-driving cars on sale by 2021. ""This acquisition is a game changer for GM and Cruise,"" because of the cost savings it will bring,"" Kyle Vogt, chief executive of GM's Cruise Automation unit, said."
General Motors,2017-10,"""We've made this acquisition because we aim to speed our path to market,"" he added."
General Motors,2017-10,"Strobe's new microchip LIDAR system would significantly enhance the capabilities of the self-driving cars GM was developing, Vogt said in a blog post and on a conference call with reporters."
General Motors,2017-10,"By reducing the entire sensor down to a single chip, Strobe's system should reduce the cost of each LIDAR on its self-driving cars by 99 percent, he said."
General Motors,2017-10,"The technology provided not just a distance measurement for an object on the road - vehicles, people and objects - but also measured that object's velocity."
General Motors,2017-10,"""This is really important for self-driving cars, especially in challenging situations,"" Vogt said."
General Motors,2017-10,"Vogt did not disclose financial terms, but said 11 full-time Strobe employees would join Cruise as part of the deal."
General Motors,2017-10,"He said last week that the unit was making ""rapid progress"" toward deploying self-driving cars in part through testing vehicles on the crowded streets of San Francisco. [L2N1ME18X]"

General Motors,2017-10,"{{20171006T221836.397+0000}}Automakers say U.S. fuel economy standards unrealistic, cite costs and consumersBy David Shepardson"
General Motors,2017-10,"WASHINGTON, Oct 6 (Reuters) - Automaker trade groups told U.S. regulators they should revise fuel efficiency mandates approved in the final weeks of the Obama administration because the costs would be onerous and the standards do not reflect how cheap gas prices are affecting consumer demand, but they stopped short of asking for a specific reduction in the requirements for 2025."
General Motors,2017-10,"The comments to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) set up the next round in a battle between automakers and the state of California and environmental groups, which argue against any retreat from limits to greenhouse gas emissions."
General Motors,2017-10,"Automakers want changes that would make it easier for them to comply with fuel economy standards, including flexibility in the use of a system of credits under the program."
General Motors,2017-10,Automakers have to meet parallel fuel economy standards overseen by the NHTSA and vehicle emissions limits regulated by the EPA.
General Motors,2017-10,"President Donald Trump has championed deregulation, saying it is needed to promote economic growth. In March he told auto workers, ""We are going to ensure that any regulations we have protect and defend your jobs, your factories."""
General Motors,2017-10,"The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a trade group representing General Motors Co , Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T>, Volkswagen AG and others, said the EPA understated the costs of technologies needed to meet the 2025 requirements."
General Motors,2017-10,"The Obama administration finalized rules in 2012 to double the fleetwide average fuel economy to 54.5 mpg by 2025, but the EPA revised it to 51.4 mpg based on a rising number of trucks. The EPA said that would result in a real world average of 36 mpg by 2025, because of credits automakers receive and differences in test procedures versus real-world driving."
General Motors,2017-10,"Automakers earn credits by producing cars and trucks that exceed the requirements in a given year -- and can then apply credits to deficits in future years. They also earn credits for air conditioning improvements, building electric vehicles and other improvements that may not be captured in testing procedures."
General Motors,2017-10,Automakers said the Obama administration finding that the 2025 targets were achievable at reasonable cost was based on errors in modeling the impact of new technology and assumptions about fuel prices and sales trends that have proved wrong.
General Motors,2017-10,"Global Automakers, a group representing Honda Motor Co <7267.T>, Hyundai Motor Co <005380.KS> and others, cited shifting consumer preferences for bigger vehicles as a problem."
General Motors,2017-10,"""There is, simply put, a misalignment between the increasing stringency of the standards and the decreasing consumer demand for fuel efficiency,"" the group said in comments filed late Thursday with the EPA."
General Motors,2017-10,"The two auto groups said the EPA has agreed to develop a new modeling approach after they said a prior model ""caused the agencies to overestimate the role that conventional technologies can play in achieving future"" improvements."
General Motors,2017-10,"An EPA spokesman declined to comment on its reconsideration, saying it would review all comments."
General Motors,2017-10,"The risk for automakers is that California, the most populous U.S. state, will withdraw from a 2012 agreement to adhere to the national EPA standard if the current standards are weakened. California's standards are followed by a dozen other states. Automakers have said it is vital to maintain one national regime for emissions regulation to avoid higher costs by having to meet two differing standards."
General Motors,2017-10,"""If the federal standards are relaxed despite the overwhelming body of evidence demonstrating they should continue as is, California will maintain its standards. Moreover, we will pursue all available legal remedies to overturn federal actions that are unsupported by the facts and law,"" state officials said in a statement."
General Motors,2017-10,Environmental groups also oppose the decision to reopen the standards.
General Motors,2017-10,"The Natural Resources Defense Council said ""automakers can meet the current standards with known technologies at reasonable cost. ... Rolling them back, however, would increase pollution, raise costs for drivers, slow innovation and put jobs at risk."""

General Motors,2017-10,"DETROIT, Oct 6 (Reuters) - Japanese auto parts supplier Denso Corp <6902.T> plans to invest $1 billion in its Maryville, Tennessee plant to develop vehicle electrification and safety systems, creating around 1,000 jobs."
General Motors,2017-10,This is the latest in a series of announcements from automakers rushing to bring a large number of electric vehicle models to market in the coming years.
General Motors,2017-10,"Policymakers in key markets such as China are pushing a shift to electric cars from internal combustion engines over the next two to three decades, while relatively new rival Tesla Inc is gaining momentum, pressuring traditional automakers to crank up plans for fully electric vehicles."
General Motors,2017-10,"Denso said in a statement the investment would expand multiple production lines at the facility to produce advanced safety, connectivity and electrification products for hybrid and electric vehicles. The new jobs will include production workers, technicians and engineers."
General Motors,2017-10,"""We are seeing dramatic shifts in the role of transportation in society, and this investment will help position us to meet those changing demands,"" Kenichiro Ito, chairman of Denso's North American board, said in a statement."

General Motors,2017-10,"VALENCIA, Venezuela, Oct 6 (Reuters) - Venezuelan auto worker Celso Nunez spends his days moonlighting as a mover and trading salvaged building materials in his worn-out red pick-up."
General Motors,2017-10,"In fact, it is paying him to stay off the job."
General Motors,2017-10,"With Venezuela's economy in shambles, Ford has furloughed Nunez and 1200 colleagues at its moribund plant here in Valencia, Venezuela's third-largest city. The company said it wants to call them back when times are better."
General Motors,2017-10,"Nunez hasn't reported for work in ten months, save for a few days in September to work on a prototype for a new cargo truck. But he still collects a quarter of his weekly salary of 50,000 bolivars, the equivalent of just $1.70 at the widely used black-market exchange rate."
General Motors,2017-10,"""Ford has given me stability ... to help my family,"" said Nunez, proudly wearing his blue factory shirt after a recent meeting at the plant about the new prototype."
General Motors,2017-10,"""We know it's not their fault, it's the national situation."""
General Motors,2017-10,"Ford is among roughly 150 multinationals still hanging on in Venezuela. The once-prosperous OPEC nation is now in the fourth year of a recession caused by a fall in oil prices and, economists say, failed policies of its socialist government."
General Motors,2017-10,"A dearth of raw materials and plummeting demand has led many to halt or vastly scale back production, furloughing many employees in a country where labor laws ban mass layoffs."
General Motors,2017-10,"A handful of companies, including Clorox , Kimberly-Clark , General Mills , General Motors and Harvest Natural Resources , have given up entirely, abandoning assets or selling them cheap.[nL1N1DG0JM]"
General Motors,2017-10,"Most multinationals, however, say they want to keep at least a minimum presence to be ready for a future upturn in Venezuela, home to the world's largest proven oil reserves."
General Motors,2017-10,"In Valencia, retrenchment by multinationals including Fiat Chrysler , Colgate Palmolive , Johnson & Johnson and Nestle SA have rendered the city a near ghost town."
General Motors,2017-10,"Last week, Nestle suspended operations at a baby food plant there, blaming a lack of supplies. In a statement, Nestle said it continues to pay the plant's 80 workers and remains committed to Venezuela and about 3200 employees at other factories there."
General Motors,2017-10,"At Ford, the company said its Valencia factory had assembled about 400 cars through August of this year, compared with 17,000 units in 2012. Still, the No. 2 U.S. automaker said in an e-mail it ""has no plans to leave the country."""
General Motors,2017-10,"The drastically reduced work schedules, it added, is a way to ""adapt to the local market's needs."""
General Motors,2017-10,"Ford began selling cars in dollars in 2015 so it could buy parts without requesting hard currency via government exchange controls. Other automakers followed suit, but have not been able to sell many cars because few Venezuelans can afford them."
General Motors,2017-10,"Venezuela's car assembly output slumped to 2,849 units in 2016 from a record 172,418 units in 2007, according to auto industry group Cavenez. Sales, including imports, plunged to 3,008 last year from 491,899 in 2007."
General Motors,2017-10,"At dealerships including Ford, Chrysler and Toyota, Venezuelan-made luxury vehicles sit without buyers, priced as much as $20,000 more than in other countries. Costs are inflated by imported parts and few economies of scale, analysts said."
General Motors,2017-10,"To stay afloat in such conditions, Ford and other multinationals have shortened shifts, reduced payrolls and focused on cheaper products, according to unions and company officials."
General Motors,2017-10,"The cutbacks make for scenes like that at the Fiat Chrysler plant in Valencia, where dust gathers on semi-assembled 2016 Jeep Cherokees, still missing windshields and mirrors."
General Motors,2017-10,"On a recent day, about 20 employees stood at the entrance to the plant, which sold more than 25,000 units in 2007 but only about 150 this year."
General Motors,2017-10,"About 60 percent of workers stay home, earning a fraction of their salaries. The rest come in but are confined to maintenance and administrative activities, employees and union leaders said."
General Motors,2017-10,"Despite the tough conditions, Fiat Chrysler has told employees it does not plan to close, said Henry Ospina of the Fiat Chrysler union."
General Motors,2017-10,"A Fiat Chrysler spokesman said the company was making ""its best efforts to keep production at levels adequate to the availability of inputs and components."" The company declined further comment."
General Motors,2017-10,"Though many multinational workers said they feel like ""pseudo-employees,"" they fare better than most unemployed Venezuelans, who struggle to buy food and medicine. Payments from state welfare programs lag the triple-digit inflation."
General Motors,2017-10,"As of April 2016, half of Venezuela's working population was either jobless or employed only in part-time, ""informal"" jobs, like street vending, according to the last available official statistics."
General Motors,2017-10,"Compounding the pain, consumer spending slumped by 15 percent last year and is expected to decline by yet another 25 percent this year, according to local consulting group Ecoanalitica."
General Motors,2017-10,"Venezuelan businesses are enduring their worst moment in decades, with at least two in every 10 factories halted, according to a Conindustria, the country's main industry association."
General Motors,2017-10,"President Nicolas Maduro's government defends policies, like widely-criticized currency controls, that many businesses say wrecked the economy. He blames the halving of international oil prices since 2014, which slashed Venezuela's revenues."
General Motors,2017-10,"Maduro also accuses foreign firms of intentionally limiting investment and production as part of an ""economic war"" waged by political opponents and the United States."
General Motors,2017-10,The Information Ministry did not respond to a request for comment.
General Motors,2017-10,"At some multinationals, furloughed employees are still allowed to eat lunch at cafeterias of halted plants - a big perk at a time of increasing hunger."
General Motors,2017-10,"Fiat Chrysler serves up staples like chicken, rice, pasta and plantains daily to 60 of its 800 workers. A schedule prioritizes the neediest."
General Motors,2017-10,"""It's one meal I don't have to pay for at home,"" said Pedro Rodriguez, 44, who has worked just six days this year at Fiat Chrysler, his employer of two decades."
General Motors,2017-10,"""There are colleagues who only eat half the meals and take the other half home because the situation is tough."""
General Motors,2017-10,"To get around strict layoff rules, many multinationals have offered voluntary buyouts."
General Motors,2017-10,"Ford launched a ""voluntary separation program"" in 2016 that about 800 employees, or 40 percent of its workforce, signed onto. Many use the severance payments to start businesses like bakeries or selling construction materials, workers said."
General Motors,2017-10,"At Fiat Chrysler, a severance offer included four new tires, each of which is worth the equivalent of a monthly factory wage in Venezuela. As of August, 23 workers had accepted: some planned to sell their tires and use the proceeds to emigrate."
General Motors,2017-10,"Elsewhere in Valencia, multinationals have struggled to adapt to other government rules, including strict price controls for some products like milk and soap. The prices rarely keep up with inflation."
General Motors,2017-10,"For instance, a Colgate-Palmolive soap plant has been shut since February. Workers there said company officials told them it could not cover costs if it sold soap at the mandated price, equal to less than $0.01 per soap bar at the black-market exchange rate."
General Motors,2017-10,"Workers said Colgate recently restarted production of price-controlled toothpaste, packaged in brown cardboard. The recycled boxes are cheaper than its usual red packaging."
General Motors,2017-10,"Earlier, it stopped producing children's flavors and toothpaste with whitener, reducing its portfolio of 300 products to less than a dozen, said union representative Felix Bello."
General Motors,2017-10,"Johnson & Johnson, which once sold everything from mouthwash to moisturizers, now only produces panty liners, a feminine hygiene product."
General Motors,2017-10,"Still, the U.S. drugmaker agreed not to lay off any of its 157 Venezuelan factory employees."
General Motors,2017-10,"Only three of the factory's seven production lines are in operation, said union representative Jaime Guevara. Workers not on the production line do maintenance work."
General Motors,2017-10,"""Johnson & Johnson has a responsibility to our employees and the communities in which we live and work,"" a company spokeswoman said."

General Motors,2017-10,"""We know it's not their fault, it's the national situation."""
General Motors,2017-10,"Ford is among roughly 150 multinationals still hanging on in Venezuela. The once-prosperous OPEC nation is now in the fourth year of a recession caused by a fall in oil prices and, economists say, failed policies of its socialist government."
General Motors,2017-10,"A dearth of raw materials and plummeting demand has led many to halt or vastly scale back production, furloughing many employees in a country where labor laws ban mass layoffs."
General Motors,2017-10,"A handful of companies, including Clorox , Kimberly-Clark , General Mills , General Motors and Harvest Natural Resources , have given up entirely, abandoning assets or selling them cheap.[nL1N1DG0JM]"
General Motors,2017-10,"Most multinationals, however, say they want to keep at least a minimum presence to be ready for a future upturn in Venezuela, home to the world's largest proven oil reserves."
General Motors,2017-10,"In Valencia, retrenchment by multinationals including Fiat Chrysler , Colgate Palmolive , Johnson & Johnson and Nestle SA have rendered the city a near ghost town."
General Motors,2017-10,"Last week, Nestle suspended operations at a baby food plant there, blaming a lack of supplies. In a statement, Nestle said it continues to pay the plant's 80 workers and remains committed to Venezuela and about 3200 employees at other factories there."
General Motors,2017-10,"At Ford, the company said its Valencia factory had assembled about 400 cars through August of this year, compared with 17,000 units in 2012. Still, the No. 2 U.S. automaker said in an e-mail it ""has no plans to leave the country."""
General Motors,2017-10,"The drastically reduced work schedules, it added, is a way to ""adapt to the local market's needs."""
General Motors,2017-10,"Ford began selling cars in dollars in 2015 so it could buy parts without requesting hard currency via government exchange controls. Other automakers followed suit, but have not been able to sell many cars because few Venezuelans can afford them."
General Motors,2017-10,"Venezuela's car assembly output slumped to 2,849 units in 2016 from a record 172,418 units in 2007, according to auto industry group Cavenez. Sales, including imports, plunged to 3,008 last year from 491,899 in 2007."
General Motors,2017-10,"At dealerships including Ford, Chrysler and Toyota, Venezuelan-made luxury vehicles sit without buyers, priced as much as $20,000 more than in other countries. Costs are inflated by imported parts and few economies of scale, analysts said."
General Motors,2017-10,"To stay afloat in such conditions, Ford and other multinationals have shortened shifts, reduced payrolls and focused on cheaper products, according to unions and company officials."
General Motors,2017-10,"The cutbacks make for scenes like that at the Fiat Chrysler plant in Valencia, where dust gathers on semi-assembled 2016 Jeep Cherokees, still missing windshields and mirrors."
General Motors,2017-10,"On a recent day, about 20 employees stood at the entrance to the plant, which sold more than 25,000 units in 2007 but only about 150 this year."
General Motors,2017-10,"About 60 percent of workers stay home, earning a fraction of their salaries. The rest come in but are confined to maintenance and administrative activities, employees and union leaders said."
General Motors,2017-10,"Despite the tough conditions, Fiat Chrysler has told employees it does not plan to close, said Henry Ospina of the Fiat Chrysler union."
General Motors,2017-10,"A Fiat Chrysler spokesman said the company was making ""its best efforts to keep production at levels adequate to the availability of inputs and components."" The company declined further comment."
General Motors,2017-10,"Though many multinational workers said they feel like ""pseudo-employees,"" they fare better than most unemployed Venezuelans, who struggle to buy food and medicine. Payments from state welfare programs lag the triple-digit inflation."
General Motors,2017-10,"As of April 2016, half of Venezuela's working population was either jobless or employed only in part-time, ""informal"" jobs, like street vending, according to the last available official statistics."
General Motors,2017-10,"Compounding the pain, consumer spending slumped by 15 percent last year and is expected to decline by yet another 25 percent this year, according to local consulting group Ecoanalitica."
General Motors,2017-10,"Venezuelan businesses are enduring their worst moment in decades, with at least two in every 10 factories halted, according to a Conindustria, the country's main industry association."
General Motors,2017-10,"President Nicolas Maduro's government defends policies, like widely-criticized currency controls, that many businesses say wrecked the economy. He blames the halving of international oil prices since 2014, which slashed Venezuela's revenues."
General Motors,2017-10,"Maduro also accuses foreign firms of intentionally limiting investment and production as part of an ""economic war"" waged by political opponents and the United States."
General Motors,2017-10,The Information Ministry did not respond to a request for comment.
General Motors,2017-10,"At some multinationals, furloughed employees are still allowed to eat lunch at cafeterias of halted plants - a big perk at a time of increasing hunger."
General Motors,2017-10,"Fiat Chrysler serves up staples like chicken, rice, pasta and plantains daily to 60 of its 800 workers. A schedule prioritizes the neediest."
General Motors,2017-10,"""It's one meal I don't have to pay for at home,"" said Pedro Rodriguez, 44, who has worked just six days this year at Fiat Chrysler, his employer of two decades."
General Motors,2017-10,"""There are colleagues who only eat half the meals and take the other half home because the situation is tough."""
General Motors,2017-10,"To get around strict layoff rules, many multinationals have offered voluntary buyouts."
General Motors,2017-10,"Ford launched a ""voluntary separation program"" in 2016 that about 800 employees, or 40 percent of its workforce, signed onto. Many use the severance payments to start businesses like bakeries or selling construction materials, workers said."
General Motors,2017-10,"At Fiat Chrysler, a severance offer included four new tires, each of which is worth the equivalent of a monthly factory wage in Venezuela. As of August, 23 workers had accepted: some planned to sell their tires and use the proceeds to emigrate."
General Motors,2017-10,"Elsewhere in Valencia, multinationals have struggled to adapt to other government rules, including strict price controls for some products like milk and soap. The prices rarely keep up with inflation."
General Motors,2017-10,"For instance, a Colgate-Palmolive soap plant has been shut since February. Workers there said company officials told them it could not cover costs if it sold soap at the mandated price, equal to less than $0.01 per soap bar at the black-market exchange rate."
General Motors,2017-10,"Workers said Colgate recently restarted production of price-controlled toothpaste, packaged in brown cardboard. The recycled boxes are cheaper than its usual red packaging."
General Motors,2017-10,"Earlier, it stopped producing children's flavors and toothpaste with whitener, reducing its portfolio of 300 products to less than a dozen, said union representative Felix Bello."
General Motors,2017-10,"Johnson & Johnson, which once sold everything from mouthwash to moisturizers, now only produces panty liners, a feminine hygiene product."
General Motors,2017-10,"Still, the U.S. drugmaker agreed not to lay off any of its 157 Venezuelan factory employees."
General Motors,2017-10,"Only three of the factory's seven production lines are in operation, said union representative Jaime Guevara. Workers not on the production line do maintenance work."

General Motors,2017-10,"WASHINGTON, Oct 4 (Reuters) - General Motors Co's self-driving unit, Cruise Automation, has more than doubled the size of its test fleet of robot cars in California during the past three months, a GM spokesman said on Wednesday."
General Motors,2017-10,"As the company increases the size of its test fleet, it has also reported more run-ins between its self-driving cars and human-operated vehicles and bicycles, telling California regulators its vehicles were involved in six minor crashes in the state in September."
General Motors,2017-10,"""All our incidents this year were caused by the other vehicle,"" said Rebecca Mark, spokeswoman for GM Cruise."
General Motors,2017-10,"In the past three months, the Cruise unit has increased the number of vehicles registered for testing on California streets to 100 from the previous 30 to 40, GM spokesman Ray Wert said."
General Motors,2017-10,Cruise is testing vehicles in San Francisco as part of its effort to develop software capable of navigating congested and often chaotic urban environments.
General Motors,2017-10,"Investors are watching GM's progress closely, and the automaker's shares have risen 17 percent during the past month as some analysts have said the company could deploy robot taxis within the next year or two. [nL2N1ME18X]"
General Motors,2017-10,"A U.S. Senate panel approved legislation on Wednesday that would allow automakers to greatly expand testing of self-driving cars. Some safety groups have objected to the proposal, saying it gives too much latitude to automakers.[nL2N1MF0XY]"
General Motors,2017-10,"As Cruise, and rivals, put more self-driving vehicles on the road to gather data to train their artificial intelligence systems, they are more frequently encountering human drivers who are not programmed to obey all traffic laws."
General Motors,2017-10,"In filings to California regulators, Cruise said the six accidents in the state last month involved other cars and a bicyclist hitting its test cars."
General Motors,2017-10,"The accidents did not result in injuries or serious damage, according to the GM reports. In total, GM Cruise vehicles have been involved in 13 collisions reported to California regulators in 2017, while Alphabet Inc's Waymo vehicles have been involved in three crashes."
General Motors,2017-10,"California state law requires that all crashes involving self-driving vehicles be reported, regardless of severity."
General Motors,2017-10,"Most of the crashes involved drivers of other vehicles striking the GM cars that were slowing for stop signs, pedestrians or other issues. In one crash, a driver of a Ford Ranger was on his cellphone when he rear-ended a Chevrolet Bolt stopped at a red light."
General Motors,2017-10,"In another instance, the driver of a Chevrolet Bolt noticed an intoxicated cyclist in San Francisco going the wrong direction toward the Bolt.

General Motors,2017-10,"SAO PAULO, Oct 4 (Reuters) - French car maker Peugeot SA on Wednesday said it was focusing on utility vehicles to lift its market share in Brazil and would offer a similar set of models as it sells in Europe."
General Motors,2017-10,"The plan is part of the company's strategy to improve consumer perception of its products and, as a result, its performance in the Brazilian market."
General Motors,2017-10,"It follows Peugeot's 207 project, in which the company adapted a small, older European model for the Brazil market to lure customers with a cheaper car, but saw disappointing results."
General Motors,2017-10,"Brazil is seen by Peugeot, a Groupe PSA company, as one of five priority markets in the world, said Chief Executive Jean-Philippe Imparato to reporters in Sao Paulo on Wednesday."
General Motors,2017-10,"""Sales volumes are not our outright target. I prefer to boost our brand image,"" he said."
General Motors,2017-10,"""We are not going to fall again in the temptation of developing a small car specifically for Brazil, we are not going to sell at any price,"" he added, detailing the plan for the Brazilian market to converge to the same set of models Peugeot offers in Europe in five years' time."
General Motors,2017-10,"France, Iran and China are currently the largest markets for Peugeot. He declined to cite a target for Brazil or Latin America, but said the fact the firm has defined the country as a priority underscores the potential it sees for future brand development."
General Motors,2017-10,"According to Brazilian car dealers association Fenabrave, Peugeot sold 19,128 vehicles in the country this year, accounting for a market share of 1.22 percent. Its French rival Renault has 7.79 percent share while the leader General Motors, 17.9 percent."
General Motors,2017-10,Peugeot is also looking to offer high-end models such as premium SUVs. In June it launched its 3008 model in Brazil and said there was a four-month wait for interested buyers to get the car.
General Motors,2017-10,"Imparato said the situation was a problem, due to higher than expected demand, but also an opportunity."
General Motors,2017-10,The company will next year sell the 5008 version of the car in Brazil.

General Motors,2017-10,"WASHINGTON, Oct 4 (Reuters) - A U.S. Senate panel on Wednesday unanimously gave the green light to a bill aimed at speeding the use of self-driving cars without human controls, a measure that also bars states from imposing regulatory road blocks."
General Motors,2017-10,"The bill still must clear a Senate vote, but it appears on track to passage. This should rev up profits for automakers, technology companies and ride service providers, hastening the day when their robot cars can carry passengers on the same U.S. roads as cars driven by people."
General Motors,2017-10,"General Motors Co , Alphabet Inc , Ford Motor Co and others have lobbied for the landmark legislation, while auto safety groups urged more safeguards and have pledged to keep fighting for changes."
General Motors,2017-10,"However the measure will not speed the process for self-driving commercial trucks, which remain in a slower lane despite support from several Republican senators."
General Motors,2017-10,"The Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee approved the bill, and the U.S. House of Representatives unanimously passed a similar measure last month. Automakers would be able to win exemptions from safety rules that require human controls. States could set rules on registration, licensing, liability, insurance and safety inspections, but not performance standards."
General Motors,2017-10,"Senator John Thune, the Republican who chairs the Commerce Committee, said the bill ""underscores the bipartisan desire to move ahead with self-driving vehicle technology.... The safety and economic benefits of self-driving vehicles are too critical to delay."""
General Motors,2017-10,"Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat, sought to amend the bill to require human controls in case of emergency, but dropped that proposal. Some senators argued it would be more dangerous to allow human drivers to seek to take over driverless cars."
General Motors,2017-10,"Even with the legislative victory, developers of self-driving technology face technical challenges. There are also the complications of driverless vehicles sharing the road with human drivers. GM told California its self-driving cars were involved in six crashes in September. The accidents were all minor, and the automaker has blamed them on human drivers and one bicyclist who hit its self-driving vehicles. [nL2N1MF1RO]"
General Motors,2017-10,"Neither the House nor the Senate bill would speed approval of self-driving technology for vehicles over 10,000 pounds, a step pushed by trucking organizations. Labor unions raised safety and employment concerns, and Democrats resisted that part of the proposal."
General Motors,2017-10,"Teamsters President Jim Hoffa said the ""safe development of advanced heavy trucking technology must encapsulate the life-and-death issues that are specific to that industry, not consider such consequences as an inconvenient after-thought."" He said Congress should also consider U.S. jobs."
General Motors,2017-10,"Tesla Inc , Alphabet, Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] and others have said they are working on self-driving trucks."
General Motors,2017-10,"After lengthy negotiations, congressional aides added language to the bill aimed at preserving legal rights to sue over defective vehicles. This resolved a dispute that threatened to derail the bill."
General Motors,2017-10,"Within three years, the bill would allow automakers to each sell up to 80,000 self-driving vehicles annually if they could demonstrate they are as safe as current vehicles. Auto safety advocates complained it lacked sufficient safeguards."
General Motors,2017-10,"The phase-in schedule was revised to initially allow 15,000 per manufacturer in the first year and up to 80,000 after three years, down from 50,000 to start and up to 100,000 in three years. It would eliminate the cap after four years."
General Motors,2017-10,The bill grants the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) authority to exempt vehicles from federal safety requirements and the agency would have to make a determination within six months of getting a request.
General Motors,2017-10,"The Self-Driving Coalition, a group of automakers, tech firms and advocates for the disabled, said the legislation ""will help ensure that the United States leads the world in self-driving innovation."""
General Motors,2017-10,"Under the measure, NHTSA must write permanent rules on self-driving cars within a decade and regulators must study how to encourage U.S. production of self-driving equipment and also look at the impact of self-driving vehicles on infrastructure, traffic congestion and fuel consumption."
General Motors,2017-10,Companies would need to disclose what information self-driving cars are collecting about individuals and how it is used. Companies would need to disclose if consumers could opt out of data collection.

General Motors,2017-10,"TOKYO, Oct 4 (Reuters) - Honda Motor Co <7267.T> plans to end production at its Sayama plant in Japan by 2022, cutting capacity by around 24 percent in its shrinking domestic market as it shifts focus to electric cars (EVs) and other new technologies."
General Motors,2017-10,The automaker has seen stagnant domestic sales and said on Wednesday it was streamlining its Japanese operations as it takes a more nimble approach to development and manufacturing in the face of fierce competition from carmakers and technology companies to make EVs and self-driving cars.
General Motors,2017-10,"""As we focus more on adopting electrification and other new technologies, we want to hone our vehicle manufacturing expertise in Japan and expand it globally,"" CEO Takahiro Hachigo told a press conference."
General Motors,2017-10,"While automobile plant closures are rare in Japan, Honda, like its global rivals, is facing pressure to cut costs in legacy businesses, including countries where sales and profits are weak, in order to fund expansions in China and development of new technology."
General Motors,2017-10,"Earlier this week, Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T> ended production at its production plant in Australia, while Ford Motor Co said it would cut $14 billion in costs in the next five years. [nL4N1ME3GX]"
General Motors,2017-10,General Motors Co earlier this year sold its European operations to France's PSA Group while it also plans to exit India and other countries where sales have been struggling.
General Motors,2017-10,"Hachigo has been trying to revive a culture of innovation at Japan's No. 3 automaker, after a number of major recalls in recent years as well as lacklustre product offerings, partly because it focused so much on increasing volumes and profit. [nL4N1LO36S]"
General Motors,2017-10,"Honda said it would consolidate production at the ageing Sayama plant in Saitama Prefecture north of Tokyo, into its Yorii plant in the same prefecture by the end of the 2022 financial year."
General Motors,2017-10,"The move would cut overall domestic annual production capacity to around 810,000 units, the same as Honda's current output levels, which are around 76 percent of its current production capacity of 1.06 million vehicles."
General Motors,2017-10,"""Domestic sales haven't increased as much as we were expecting and it has become difficult to boost exports,"" Hachigo said."
General Motors,2017-10,"Following consolidation, Honda said the Yorii plant will produce EVs and serve as a major centre for developing manufacturing technology for electric cars. It will also produce other vehicles including larger-sized global models."
General Motors,2017-10,"While the automaker cuts capacity at home, it plans to open a new plant by 2019 in China, where it has seen explosive growth. Honda also has been expanding capacity in North America and just recently announced plans to expand output of its Accord sedan at one of its plants in Ohio. [nL2N1LZ0NF]"
General Motors,2017-10,"Overall, global annual production would remain largely unchanged at around 5.06 million units, it said."
General Motors,2017-10,"Honda has struggled to expand sales at home in the past few years, facing stiff competition from popular offerings including Toyota's Prius gasoline hybrid and Nissan Motor Co.'s <7201.T>, Note compact hatchback."
General Motors,2017-10,"In the year ended March, it sold 668,000 units domestically, almost the same as in the previous year. Overall, passenger car sales in Japan have been decreasing in past years due to a greying population while interest in car ownership among young people has been falling."
General Motors,2017-10,Hachigo also said he was confident Honda was following proper procedures for final vehicle inspection for the Japanese market.
General Motors,2017-10,He said the company was complying with a request from Japan's transport ministry for inspection records after Nissan said on Monday it would recall 1.2 million vehicles due to procedural irregularities with its final inspection processes. [nL4N1MF0FF]

General Motors,2017-10,"NEW YORK, Oct 3 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Ford's new chief executive is betting his ambitious retool on big cost cuts. Jim Hackett, who jumped into the driver's seat in May, wants to slash $14 billion of fat by 2022 and switch $7 billion of investment to trucks and SUVs from cars. That should boost earnings, helping speed development of electric and autonomous vehicles. The plan will have to fire on all cylinders, though, to catch up with competitors."
General Motors,2017-10,"Expense savings alone could generate a huge profit boost for a company that has often missed earnings estimates and posted declining pretax margins, allowing GM to take pole position. If the entire $14 billion were, once taxed, to go straight to the bottom line, it would more than double last year's net income. Favoring larger vehicles over cars will boost margins, too."
General Motors,2017-10,"These steps, if successful, will enable Hackett to develop the car of the future by ramping up spending on things like electric batteries, machine learning, autonomous driving and big data."
General Motors,2017-10,"But BMW has been more forthcoming about its progress. And GM is promising to double its electric lineup and hints it may be able to put robotaxis on the road within a couple of years. That raises the bar for rivals, especially for one that has disappointed investors in recent years. If Hackett cannot show he's making headway on new technology or stumbles in his attempts to pare back costs, Ford may have to go back to the drawing board."
General Motors,2017-10,- Ford Chief Executive Jim Hackett on Oct. 3 unveiled his strategy for the automaker at an event in New York City.
General Motors,2017-10,"- Hackett took over as boss in May after Executive Chairman Bill Ford and the board decided to fire his predecessor, Mark Fields."

General Motors,2017-10,"WASHINGTON, Oct 3 (Reuters) - A coalition of auto safety advocates criticized a bill before the U.S. Congress that would allow automakers eventually to sell up to 100,000 self-driving vehicles annually if they could demonstrate they are as safe as current vehicles."
General Motors,2017-10,"The measure, the first significant federal legislation aimed at speeding self-driving cars to market, would allow automakers to win exemptions from safety standards for self-driving cars without human controls and bar states from imposing performance requirements."
General Motors,2017-10,"Last week, U.S. Senator John Thune, a Republican who chairs the Commerce Committee, and Senator Gary Peters, a Michigan Democrat, said they had reached a bipartisan deal on the legislation."
General Motors,2017-10,"The Senate Commerce Committee will vote on the measure on Wednesday, but may also vote on whether to include larger trucks. The U.S. House unanimously passed a similar bill in early September that did not include vehicles above 10,000 pounds (4.5 tonnes)."
General Motors,2017-10,"""The public will be the crash-test dummy for this dangerous experiment,"" former National Highway Traffic Safety Administration chief Joan Claybrook told a conference call with reporters on Tuesday, arguing the auto industry ""is essentially trying to deregulate auto safety."""

General Motors,2017-10,"States could still set rules on registration, licensing, liability, insurance and safety inspections, but not performance standards."
General Motors,2017-10,The bill grants the NHTSA authority to exempt vehicles from existing federal safety requirements and the agency would have to make a determination within six months of getting a request.
General Motors,2017-10,"It is not clear how the agency would make that assessment, given limited current testing on U.S. roads. The fatality rate in 2015 was 1.12 deaths and 78 injuries per 100 million miles traveled."

General Motors,2017-10,"The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a trade group, said on Tuesday that NHTSA's authority was not affected by the bill.

General Motors,2017-10,"GM Cruise vehicles, for example, must maneuver past double-parked cars on narrow San Francisco streets 24.3 times more often than vehicles in suburban environments, Vogt said."

General Motors,2017-10,{{20171003T150427.448+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-Ford is playing catch-up with General Motors(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.)
General Motors,2017-10,"At 7.8 times next year's earnings, Ford trades at a premium to GM's 7.1 times, even after its stock tanked by more than a third under former Chief Executive Mark Fields. Skepticism about GM's post-bankruptcy turnaround offset Ford's missed earnings targets, declining profitability and confusion about its plans for a connected, self-driving future."
General Motors,2017-10,"New boss Jim Hackett's big fix has gotten off to a poor start. On Monday, Ford announced it was setting up a new unit, Team Edison, to ""think big,"" ""make quicker decisions"" and ""think holistically"" about electric cars. Within hours, GM bested that, saying it would have 20 electric and hybrid vehicles on the road by 2023."
General Motors,2017-10,"Autonomous and electric vehicles may not hit the roads en masse or be profitable for years. And whatever Hackett cooks up, Ford is unlikely to get near the valuation multiple of Tesla , even after the latter's third-quarter production of its Model 3 came in at less than a fifth of its target."
General Motors,2017-10,"Nonetheless, the stakes are high. Automakers need to show they know roughly where they're going without squandering capital. GM, with its shares hitting a record high, gets the joke. If Hackett cannot show Ford does, too, its premium to GM is under imminent threat."
General Motors,2017-10,- Ford Motor will unveil new Chief Executive Jim Hackett's strategy for the automaker after stock markets close on Oct. 3.
General Motors,2017-10,"- Ford has formed a team to speed up development of electric cars, with a brief to ""think big,"" ""make quicker decisions"" and ""look holistically"" at the market, Sherif Marakby, vice president of autonomous vehicles and electrification, said on Oct. 2."
General Motors,2017-10,- General Motors the same day outlined plans to put 20 electric-battery and fuel-cell vehicles on the roads by 2023. These would include most if not all of the at least 10 hybrid or electric cars Chief Executive Mary Barra has pledged to introduce to the Chinese market by 2020.
General Motors,2017-10,"- GM's shares closed at a record high $42.15 on Oct. 2, driven higher by a Deutsche Bank research note saying the automaker plans to have autonomous ride-sharing service in operation by 2020."
General Motors,2017-10,"- Tesla delivered 26,150 cars in the third quarter, the electric-car maker reported on Oct. 2. Of these, 220 were the new Model 3. A total of 260 Model 3s were built in the quarter, well below the target of 1,500."

General Motors,2017-10,Sales at No. 1 U.S. automaker General Motors Co jumped nearly 12 percent versus September 2016 as a 43 percent increase in sales of crossovers and a 10 percent rise for pickup trucks offset an 11 percent decline for passenger cars.
General Motors,2017-10,"GM inventory fell to 76 days supply last month from 88 days in August, a positive development since analysts have blamed the automaker for much of the industry's oversupply of unsold new vehicles. GM is moving closer to its goal of around 70 days supply by the end of the year."
General Motors,2017-10,"The ""overall strength of the U.S. economy is the main force driving the market,"" said GM chief economist Mustafa Mohatarem, with recovery in hurricane-damaged areas ""spurring new and used vehicle sales."""
General Motors,2017-10,"New car sales in the Houston area, the fourth most populous in the United States, jumped 109 percent in the three weeks after Hurricane Harvey compared with the three weeks before the storm, according to car shopping website Edmunds."
General Motors,2017-10,"Some industry consultants have estimated up to 500,000 cars were damaged or destroyed during Harvey."
General Motors,2017-10,"But Jessica Caldwell, Edmunds executive director of industry analysis, said automakers were struggling to reduce inventories in the rest of the country."
General Motors,2017-10,"Ford Motor Co's sales rose 8.7 percent in September, with those to consumers up 4.4 percent and lower-margin fleet sales up 25.1 percent. F-Series pickup truck sales soared 21.4 percent."
General Motors,2017-10,"Toyota Motor Corp's <7203.T> September sales were up nearly 15 percent, with strong gains for SUVs and trucks. Sales of the revamped 2018 Camry sedan were up 13 percent in the vehicle's first full month of sales."

General Motors,2017-10,"BEIJING/DETROIT, Oct 3 (Reuters) - U.S. automaker Ford Motor Co is overhauling its China plans as its global ""One Ford"" strategy is holding it back in the world's biggest auto market, two high-ranking company insiders told Reuters."
General Motors,2017-10,"The review of its China operations, part of a broader strategy re-think under new CEO Jim Hackett, will likely see Ford focus on electric commercial vans, which China is encouraging in its polluted and congested city centres, as well as electric cars."
General Motors,2017-10,A shift to e-vans and e-trucks in China would also fit with Ford's reckoning that a best play globally for electrification and autonomous driving might be in commercial and delivery vehicles - a part of the market where it is already strong in the United States and Europe.
General Motors,2017-10,"The ""One Ford"" strategy - which helped the automaker's turnaround under former CEO Alan Mulally - doesn't fit all situations, the two insiders said, particularly in China and India, two crucial markets where Ford's sales have slowed."
General Motors,2017-10,"""That's why nobody internally talks about ""One Ford"" (in those markets) anymore,"" said one of the insiders, who are familiar with Ford's Chinese strategy. Neither wanted to be named as they are not authorized to speak with reporters."
General Motors,2017-10,"In a sign that Ford is turning away from what is essentially a global push of its Ford and Lincoln brands, the Dearborn, Michigan automaker wants to drive its truck-making China partner Jiangling Motors Corp (JMC) <000550.SZ> more towards electric commercial vans."

General Motors,2017-10,"Sherif Marakby, Ford's vice president of autonomous vehicles and electrification, told Reuters he couldn't comment on specific partnerships that haven't been announced. ""But we are absolutely open to (EV) partnerships in different markets, and we continue to talk to other companies and Tier One suppliers. Don't be surprised to see more partnerships in electric vehicles in different markets,"" he said."
General Motors,2017-10,Hackett was scheduled to give a presentation to analysts in New York later on Tuesday.
General Motors,2017-10,"In India, Ford and local automaker Mahindra and Mahindra said last month they will launch a strategic alliance in a market shifting to vehicle electrification."
General Motors,2017-10,"In August, Ford said it was considering a joint venture with Anhui Zotye Automobile Co <000980.SZ> to build electric vehicles in China under a new brand, tapping Zotye's low-cost electric-vehicle (EV) technology. One of the insiders said Ford was seeking Chinese regulatory approval for this."
General Motors,2017-10,"It has also brought in Jason Luo, a Chinese-born American, from U.S.-based air bag maker Key Safety Systems to run its China operations. He has been tasked, one of the insiders said, with building closer ties with local partners including JMC and Changan Automobile Co <000625.SZ>, working more effectively with regulators, and responding faster to changing consumer tastes."
General Motors,2017-10,"""One big issue at Ford China is our decision-making process is too slow,"" one of the knowledgeable insiders said. ""We try to manage everything, all aspects of the business under ""One Ford"","" and that hobbled the company's ability to move quickly, costing market share."
General Motors,2017-10,"Ford's China sales are forecast to decline 4.6 percent this year, according to LMC Automotive, a far cry from double-digit growth just five years ago."
General Motors,2017-10,"Ford has no affordable electric plug-in cars for the Chinese market, despite it being little secret that Beijing planned new quotas for all-electric battery cars and heavily electrified plug-in hybrid vehicles. Those quotas were announced late last month. [nL4N1M92KV]"
General Motors,2017-10,"Nor does Ford have a high-volume brand of affordable entry cars for China - such as the Baojun cars sold by rival General Motors Co and its China partner SAIC Motor Corp <600104.SS>. Launched in 2010, Baojun sold more than 2 million vehicles last year."
General Motors,2017-10,"With JMC, its nearly one-third-owned venture with JMC Group, Ford was slow to expand the light commercial vehicle maker into low-cost entry passenger cars - a market that has now become saturated with Chinese-branded cars and foreign-operated China-only brands like Baojun and Nissan Motor Co's <7201.T> Venucia."
General Motors,2017-10,"Ford's missteps in China were partly through a rigid adherence to the ""One Ford"" mantra and a lack of local knowledge, one of the insiders said, noting company executives sent into China often lacked the cultural ties to work with Chinese regulators, policymakers and partners."

General Motors,2017-10,"""One big issue at Ford China is our decision-making process is too slow,"" one of the knowledgeable insiders said. ""We try to manage everything, all aspects of the business under ""One Ford"","" and that hobbled the company's ability to move quickly, costing market share."
General Motors,2017-10,"Ford's China sales are forecast to decline 4.6 percent this year, according to LMC Automotive, a far cry from double-digit growth just five years ago."
General Motors,2017-10,"Ford has no affordable electric plug-in cars for the Chinese market, despite it being little secret that Beijing planned new quotas for all-electric battery cars and heavily electrified plug-in hybrid vehicles. Those quotas were announced late last month. [nL4N1M92KV]"
General Motors,2017-10,"Nor does Ford have a high-volume brand of affordable entry cars for China - such as the Baojun cars sold by rival General Motors Co and its China partner SAIC Motor Corp <600104.SS>. Launched in 2010, Baojun sold more than 2 million vehicles last year."
General Motors,2017-10,"With JMC, its nearly one-third-owned venture with JMC Group, Ford was slow to expand the light commercial vehicle maker into low-cost entry passenger cars - a market that has now become saturated with Chinese-branded cars and foreign-operated China-only brands like Baojun and Nissan Motor Co's <7201.T> Venucia."
General Motors,2017-10,"Ford's missteps in China were partly through a rigid adherence to the ""One Ford"" mantra and a lack of local knowledge, one of the insiders said, noting company executives sent into China often lacked the cultural ties to work with Chinese regulators, policymakers and partners."
General Motors,2017-10,"Also, China's market, consumer tastes and government policies shift rapidly, the person said."
