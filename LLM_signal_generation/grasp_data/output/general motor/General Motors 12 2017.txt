General Motors,2017-12,"{{20171229T101357.596+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-Wanted: Italian-American carmaker seeks new driverMILAN, Dec 29 (Reuters Breakingviews)"
General Motors,2017-12,(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are her own.)
General Motors,2017-12,"MILAN, Dec 29 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne will soon be heading for Fiat Chrysler's off ramp. As directors consider who should succeed him, Breakingviews imagines what advice a consultant might give."
General Motors,2017-12,"Thank you for giving us the opportunity to share our thoughts on Fiat Chrysler Automobiles after Sergio Marchionne's planned 2019 departure. His extraordinary achievements, unique management style and dominant presence will be a tough act to follow."
General Motors,2017-12,"Marchionne was the right person for the job, despite a lack of industry experience when he took the wheel in June 2004. His direct, pugnacious and intrepid approach was what was needed to turn around a moribund Fiat and get insolvent Chrysler back on the road."
General Motors,2017-12,"Shareholders, including top owner Exor , have so far received a 900 percent total return on FCA stock, 2.6 times the industry average. Those who held on to their stakes in spun-off CNH and Ferrari have even more to cheer about. Combined, these two were worth $37 billion as of Dec. 7, 45 percent more than their erstwhile parent company."
General Motors,2017-12,"Spending a lot more time both in and on China is critical for Marchionne's replacement. The Middle Kingdom is now the world's biggest car market: vehicle sales surpassed 28 million in 2016, about a third of global demand."
General Motors,2017-12,"FCA's 2014 deepening of its alliance with Guangzhou Automobile Industry Group [GZGVTD.UL] has not gone far enough. Its sales were 176,000 in 2016 against about 4 million for VW . Your company is falling a long way short of its 2014 goal of selling 850,000 vehicles by 2018."
General Motors,2017-12,"Next, the new chief needs a solid understanding of the tech world to steer FCA through unprecedented industry disruption. Marchionne has been reluctant to make big financial bets in new technology, in large part because he has been a vocal sceptic of electric cars."
General Motors,2017-12,"He has a point. Questions remain about the environmental impact of lithium batteries and the availability of cobalt and other materials. Now, though, China is vowing to ban petrol and diesel cars by 2040, so having battery-powered vehicles will be essential to compete. France and the United Kingdom are talking a similar line."
General Motors,2017-12,"Fiat Chrysler also lags rivals in connected and autonomous cars, having outsourced most work to Alphabet's Waymo. Such a conservative R&D approach made sense given FCA's high debt. And getting regulators and customers comfortable with self-driving vehicles may well take a while. Marchionne has been speeding up in this area lately. But General Motors' plan to get robo-taxis in U.S. streets by 2019 suggests FCA needs to move even faster."
General Motors,2017-12,"We would also caution against choosing just one replacement for Marchionne. There's no need for joint CEOs. But we'd note that Marchionne put on too many hats. He runs the entire company, is chairman and CEO of both North America and Ferrari, where he'll stay on after leaving FCA, and is chair of Maserati and CNH."
General Motors,2017-12,"We laud your decision to seek stability by looking to promote people who are graduates, shall we say, of the ""Marchionne School"". Finance chief Richard Palmer, Jeep boss Michael Manley and EMEA Chief Operating Officer Alfredo Altavilla are all worthy choices. But we urge you not dismiss the idea of outside candidates, if only for some of the roles below the CEO level."
General Motors,2017-12,"Finally, the sooner you can announce the new CEO, the better. Marchionne is planning to unveil a new five-year plan in 2018. That could constrain his successor, who needs to own the plan, not simply inherit it. After all, FCA does not need a Marchionne copycat, but someone who can decisively drive it into the future."
General Motors,2017-12,- Fiat Chrysler's board has already started to look for a successor and is expected to choose someone from inside the company.
General Motors,2017-12,"- Marchionne, who became CEO of Italy's Fiat on June 1, 2004, is set to present shareholders with a new five-year plan for FCA in mid-2018."
General Motors,2017-12,"- By close of market on Dec. 7, Fiat Chrysler's New York-listed shares had risen 93 percent during 2017, far more than any major rival."
General Motors,2017-12,- Reports over the summer that Chinese carmaker Great Wall <601633.SS> was interested in buying part or all of the company helped fuel the surging valuation.
General Motors,2017-12,"- Fiat Chrysler has also reported much improved financial results, including a 50 percent increase in third-quarter net income to 910 million euros, compared with the same period in 2016. The group's pre-tax profit margin was 5.5 percent for the period."

General Motors,2017-12,"NEW YORK, Dec 28 (Reuters) - General Motors Co on Thursday won a court ruling that could reduce the private litigation it faces over flawed vehicle ignition switches, which have been linked to 124 deaths and triggered a big recall."
General Motors,2017-12,"U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman in Manhattan said the plaintiffs in two bellwether cases, involving accidents where airbags had deployed, could not introduce expert testimony to show how defective ignition switches might have played a role in the crashes."
General Motors,2017-12,"The plaintiffs said their GM ignition switches might have rotated from ""run"" at the moment of impact to ""accessory"" or ""off,"" causing the accidents or making them worse, and then back to ""run"" before the airbags deployed."
General Motors,2017-12,"But Furman, who oversees multi-district litigation (""MDL"") over the ignition switches, including 213 cases where airbags deployed, called the expert testimony ""unreliable"" because there was no evidence that ""double switch rotation"" occurred anywhere."
General Motors,2017-12,"""The court recognizes that these conclusions may have a significant impact on a swath of cases now pending in the MDL and, thus, does not reach them lightly,"" the judge wrote."
General Motors,2017-12,"Furman said his role is ""to ensure the reliability and relevancy of expert testimony,"" and the opinions of the plaintiffs' experts ""do not pass muster."""
General Motors,2017-12,"Bob Hilliard and Tamar Lusztig, two lawyers for the plaintiffs, did not immediately respond to requests for comment."
General Motors,2017-12,"David Caldwell, a spokesman for Detroit-based GM, said the decision ""reinforces our approach to contest cases that lack merit, while being open to fair resolution of cases that have more merit according to the facts and the law."""
General Motors,2017-12,"GM has paid more than $2.6 billion in penalties and settlements, including $900 million to settle a U.S. Department of Justice criminal case, over ignition switches that could cause engines to stall and prevent airbags from deploying."
General Motors,2017-12,The largest U.S. automaker has recalled more than 2.6 million vehicles over the defect since February 2014.
General Motors,2017-12,"As of Nov. 30, there were 1,723 unresolved personal injury and wrongful death claims in the multi-district litigation, including the 213 where airbags deployed, a court filing shows. GM has also settled claims related to more than 1,700 claimants."
General Motors,2017-12,"Thursday's decision dismissed claims by Vivian Garza, who was 19 when her Chevrolet Cobalt crashed on an icy highway in Alice, Texas, in February 2011."
General Motors,2017-12,It also dismissed claims by the son of Ruby Greenroad over the January 2013 crash of her 2007 Cobalt in the Houston area. Greenroad died at age 90 the following year.

General Motors,2017-12,(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are her own.)
General Motors,2017-12,"HONG KONG, Dec 28 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Samsung Electronics <005930.KS> will soon soup up its engine for the car race of the future. The tech behemoth faces slowing growth in its core smartphone and chips products at the same time as it's distracted by a leadership crisis. Revving up its automotive offering, as strategy chief Young Sohn recently said the company would like to do, could help Samsung jump start new growth engines."
General Motors,2017-12,"The cyclical market for memory chips, which account for over 60 percent of Samsung's operating profit, may enter a downturn next year, analysts warn. Meanwhile, the automotive tech market is growing fast and could be worth $645 billion or more by 2030, according to Jefferies. By then 95 percent of new cars on the road could be self-driving, reckon Bernstein analysts."
General Motors,2017-12,"The South Korean conglomerate splashed out $8 billion in 2016 for Harman, a parts supplier which provides infotainment systems to Volkswagen , General Motors and other carmakers. So far, though, the company has only dabbled in autonomous vehicles, taking small stakes in startups including Oculii, which makes radar sensors, and car-safety specialist TTTech."
General Motors,2017-12,"That pales in comparison to Qualcomm's $47 billion bid for automotive chip maker NXP Semiconductors , or Intel's $15 billion acquisition of Mobileye. Apple , Alphabet and Uber are pouring huge sums into self-driving cars and GM plans to put fleets of robo-taxis on U.S. streets by 2019."
General Motors,2017-12,"Samsung's $46 billion or so of net cash gives it the financial power to try and catch up. Investing some of that to beef up Harman's integrated car systems to rival Delphi is one option. Another would involve playing to its natural strengths in semiconductors and taking on the likes of NXP and Nvidia , whose chips power cars from Tesla to Toyota <7203.T>."
General Motors,2017-12,"Or it could try expanding into a related field by snagging, for example, a cyber-security specialist. The candidates range from the $3 billion FireEye to $18 billion Symantec ."
General Motors,2017-12,"There are a couple of obstacles in its path, though. First, Samsung is engulfed in a leadership crisis: de facto boss Jay Y. Lee was convicted of bribery in August and several top executives have since resigned. Second, organic expansion takes time, yet Samsung has never been a big M&A player: Harman is its largest acquisition."
General Motors,2017-12,"That means new executives will need quickly to get comfortable with taking the wheel. With so many players already further down the road, Samsung needs to speed up to compete."
General Motors,2017-12,"- Samsung Electronics President and Chief Strategy Officer Young Sohn on Dec. 1 said he was keen for the company to expand in automotive markets, digital health and industrial automation."
General Motors,2017-12,"- Speaking to Reuters on the sidelines of the Slush tech startup festival in Helsinki, Sohn said Samsung's $8 billion purchase of automotive and audio company, Harman, in 2016 had given Samsung confidence to chase big deals."
General Motors,2017-12,"- By 2030, 106 million new vehicles a year, or 95 percent of all new cars sold, will be fully autonomous, according to analysts at Bernstein."

General Motors,2017-12,"WASHINGTON, Dec 21 (Reuters) - U.S. automakers installed automatic emergency braking technology that experts said could prevent thousands of deaths and injuries in just 19 percent of new vehicles sold in the 2017 model year, regulators and safety advocates said on Thursday."
General Motors,2017-12,"Last year, 20 automakers struck a voluntary agreement with the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) to make collision-avoiding braking systems standard equipment on nearly all light vehicles by September 2022, representing 99 percent of all U.S. vehicle sales."
General Motors,2017-12,"The push comes as U.S. traffic deaths jumped 5.6 percent in 2016 to a decade-high 37,461, and pedestrian deaths rose 9 percent to 5,987, the highest number since 1990. By 2025, standard automatic braking systems could prevent 28,000 crashes and 12,000 injuries, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety estimated."
General Motors,2017-12,"Automatic braking systems, which activate brakes when the technology senses objects ahead and the driver does not slow down, require more sensors and software than conventional brakes and add to vehicle costs. Automakers say they need time to engineer the systems that use radar or cameras into vehicles as part of more comprehensive makeovers."
General Motors,2017-12,"Luxury automakers have been quick to install the systems, while others have lagged."
General Motors,2017-12,"Tesla Inc and Daimler AG's Mercedes-Benz unit have installed the technology on virtually all vehicles sold, according to figures released by NHTSA."
General Motors,2017-12,"Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T> has the largest number of 2017 model vehicles with automatic emergency braking, equipping 56 percent of its fleet, or 1.4 million vehicles."
General Motors,2017-12,"Volkswagen AG's VW brand has it in 36 percent of vehicles, while its Audi unit has it in 73 percent of vehicles. Its Porsche unit did not install the technology on any 2017 vehicles. Subaru Corp <7270.T> has the technology in nearly all vehicles sold."
General Motors,2017-12,"General Motors Co installed the technology on 20 percent of vehicles sold, while Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV has it in 6 percent and Ford Motor Co just 2 percent - the lowest of any major automaker. Jaguar Land Rover, owned by India's Tata Motors did not install the technology on any 2017 vehicles."
General Motors,2017-12,"GM said it continues to expand availability of automatic emergency braking, and about two thirds of its U.S. models offer the system."
General Motors,2017-12,"Ford spokeswoman Elizabeth Weigandt said the automaker offers automatic emergency braking on a number of vehicles and has ""a plan to standardize over time."""
General Motors,2017-12,"Fiat Chrysler backs the 2022 commitment, and a spokesman said it is offering automatic emergency braking on a growing number of vehicles."

General Motors,2017-12,Dec 18 (Reuters) - Lawyers for General Motors on Monday urged a federal bankruptcy judge in Manhattan to throw out a settlement that would require the company to pay $1 billion to car owners suing over faulty ignition switches.
General Motors,2017-12,The carmaker made its argument on the first day of a scheduled three-day bench trial before Judge Martin Glenn of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New York. The trial will determine the validity of a deal the car owners said they reached in August with a trust that holds many GM liabilities from before its 2009 bankruptcy. [nL2N1L31WM]
General Motors,2017-12,"The claims stem from GM's 2014 recall of 2.6 million vehicles with defective ignition switches, including one linked to 124 deaths."
General Motors,2017-12,"Lawyers for the car owners say the trust agreed to a deal in August but walked away several days later, instead accepting GM's offer to help pay for its defense against the car owners' claims."
General Motors,2017-12,"The judge questioned how that came about, noting GM had an interest in dissolving any deal that required it to pay more."
General Motors,2017-12,"""I have trouble saying it passes the smell test,"" Glenn said, referring to a two-hour meeting between the trust and GM in August, after which the trust dropped the agreement with the plaintiffs."
General Motors,2017-12,But attorneys for the carmaker and the trust told Glenn the trust had every right to drop the agreement.
General Motors,2017-12,"""Sometimes people simply get cold feet, even when they get married,"" said Susheel Kirpalani, a lawyer for GM, ""and the same applies to settlements, your honor."""
General Motors,2017-12,"The carmaker said the deal with the car owners had never been signed, rendering it non-binding. Mitchell Karlan, an attorney for the trust, on Monday also said plaintiff lawyers contradicted each other in their testimony on when the agreement was allegedly reached."
General Motors,2017-12,"But the car owners said the trust acted in bad faith and claimed the agreement was binding even without a signature, pointing to conversations and emails with the trust."
General Motors,2017-12,The settlement called for the trust to accept $10 billion in claims to resolve about 11.9 million allegations over economic loss and between 400 and 500 personal injury and wrongful death claims.
General Motors,2017-12,"About 2.4 million claims, involving vehicles sold after GM's bankruptcy, would have remained pending in another court."
General Motors,2017-12,"GM has already paid roughly $2.5 billion to settle ignition switch-related claims, including $900 million to settle a criminal probe by the U.S. Justice Department."
General Motors,2017-12,"{{20171216T210000.000+0000}}GM offers a sneak peek at new Chevy truck, loaded with profitsDETROIT, Dec 16 (Reuters)"
General Motors,2017-12,"DETROIT, Dec 16 (Reuters) - General Motors Co offered a sneak peek on Saturday of the next generation Chevrolet Silverado pickup, designed to haul big payloads of profits for the automaker when it launches next year."
General Motors,2017-12,"The current Silverado is GM's best selling vehicle in North America, with sales of more than 500,000 vehicles last year. Analysts and company executives said it was also one of the manufacturer's highest-profit model lines."
General Motors,2017-12,"GM has disclosed investments of nearly $3 billion to upgrade factories in Michigan, Indiana and Mexico that build the Silverado and its GMC brand counterpart, the Sierra."
General Motors,2017-12,"Until now, GM has disclosed few details of the new truck ahead of its official debut at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit in January."
General Motors,2017-12,"GM said it revealed an off-road version of the Silverado at an event for loyal Chevy truck owners in Texas, a state whose residents buy a lot of large, high-priced pickup trucks."
General Motors,2017-12,"GM, in a statement, said the new Silverado will have a high-strength steel bed floor, and use ""mixed materials"" to achieve ""a significant reduction in total weight."" Lighter weight usually translates to improved fuel economy."
General Motors,2017-12,"Previously, GM executives signaled they did not intend to ape their top rival and build the new Silverado's body entirely or mostly of aluminum, like Ford Motor Co's F-series pickups."
General Motors,2017-12,"Detroit automakers, under pressure to boost fuel efficiency and cut carbon emissions, are slashing the weight of their best-selling large trucks. Yet the companies do not want to compromise the load-hauling capability and luxury features that allow them to command prices that average $46,984 a vehicle, according to Cox Automotive."
General Motors,2017-12,"Ford recently launched a luxury F250 pickup that can have a sticker price as high as $94,455."
General Motors,2017-12,"GM will offer eight versions of the new Silverado and more engine and transmission combinations than the current lineup, GM said."
General Motors,2017-12,Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV is expected to unveil the next generation of its big Ram 1500 pickup at the Detroit auto show.

General Motors,2017-12,"WASHINGTON, Dec 15 (Reuters) - A compromise Republican tax bill released late Friday does not eliminate a $7,500 electric vehicle tax credit as Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives had previously proposed."
General Motors,2017-12,"The measure follows the lead of the Senate version approved last month that did not eliminate the credit. Killing the credit could have hurt automakers like General Motors Co , Volkswagen AG , Tesla Inc and Nissan Motor Co <7201.T>."
General Motors,2017-12,"Consumers under current law are eligible for a $7,500 tax credit to defray the cost of plug-in electric vehicles. The electric vehicle tax credit starts to phase out after a manufacturer sells 200,000 plug-in vehicles. After an automaker hits that point, the $7,500 tax credit is still available for at least three more months before phasing out."
General Motors,2017-12,"Consumers are currently allowed to take the credit on vehicles until the manufacturer hits 200,000 plug-in vehicles sold. Electric vehicles have expensive batteries that make them pricier than gasoline-powered vehicles."
General Motors,2017-12,"The Electric Drive Transportation Association said in a statement late Friday it was pleased the credit would remain in law. ""The credit supports innovation and job creation while helping drivers access advanced vehicle technology,"" the group said."
General Motors,2017-12,"More than 50 automakers and other companies and groups released a letter earlier this week urging Congress to retain the credit, including Ford Motor Co , BMW AG , GM, Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL]."
General Motors,2017-12,"Former President Barack Obama repeatedly proposed hiking the tax credit for electric vehicles to $10,000 and converting it to a point-of-sale rebate, but Congress did not approve the measure."
General Motors,2017-12,Automakers face mandates from California and a dozen other states to produce a rising number of zero-emission vehicles and have said the credits are essential to meeting requirements.

General Motors,2017-12,"FRANKFURT, Dec 15 (Reuters) - PSA Group's Opel, under pressure to cut costs, said on Friday that management and staff representatives had reached an agreement that includes shorter hours for its workers."
General Motors,2017-12,"The Ruesselsheim, Germany-based carmaker said a deal had been struck to, among other things, cut hours for at least six months from Jan. 1 in the engineering and administration departments."
General Motors,2017-12,"From April 1, the work week will also be shortened to 35 hours for workers who currently have agreements in place to work more, Opel said."
General Motors,2017-12,"Opel, which operates as Vauxhall in Britain, did not say how many workers would be affected. The loss-making company, which PSA bought from General Motors , earlier this year, employs over 37,000 people, including more than 19,000 in Germany, according to its website."
General Motors,2017-12,"Opel also said a new common procurement organisation for Opel/Vauxhall with PSA's other brands, including Peugeot and Citroen, would increase efficiencies."
General Motors,2017-12,"In the long term, 30 percent of savings from the integration of Opel into PSA will stem from procurement, it said."
General Motors,2017-12,"""It is our common goal to make Opel competitive,"" said Michael Lohscheller, chief executive officer of Opel Automobile."
General Motors,2017-12,"PSA Group Chief Executive Carlos Tavares had signalled possible cost cuts at Opel, noting in a newspaper interview in October that production costs were at least 50 percent higher than at the group's French factories. [nL8N1MV49A]"
General Motors,2017-12,"Tavares has also said a failure of turnaround efforts at Opel would spell ""very serious"" consequences for workers at the German division and the company as a whole. [nL8N1NM4GJ]"
General Motors,2017-12,"PSA has given Opel until 2020 to return to profit as part of a recovery plan aimed at shifting the brand's model lineup onto PSA's architecture, with the French parent pursuing 1.7 billion euros ($2 billion) in savings from its purchase of Opel."
General Motors,2017-12,Other key elements of the agreement announced on Friday include an expansion of part-time programmes for older employees and the possibility of early retirement.
General Motors,2017-12,"Managers' bonuses will be linked to the turnaround plan, Opel said."

General Motors,2017-12,"Dec 13 (Reuters) - General Motors Co said on Wednesday Joseph Ashton, a former United Auto Workers vice president who led the union's GM department, has resigned from the company's board."
General Motors,2017-12,"The trust can nominate a replacement for Ashton, but shareholders won't vote on the trust's nominee until the company's next annual meeting in the spring, a GM spokesman said."
General Motors,2017-12,"The U.S. Justice Department is looking into the use of money at UAW managed training centers funded by GM and Ford Motor Co , and into charities established by senior UAW officers. [nL2N1N8232]"
General Motors,2017-12,General Motors and Ford said last month they were cooperating with the investigation into the finances of training centers.
General Motors,2017-12,"GM is conducting its own investigation of the UAW-GM Center for Human Resources, the company spokesman said, but did not provide details of that investigation."
General Motors,2017-12,"Ashton has not been charged with any wrongdoing, and federal authorities have not disclosed that he is under scrutiny as part of their probe."
General Motors,2017-12,Federal officials expanded their probe of the UAW training centers after charging a former Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV vice president of making $1.2 million in improper payments to a former union vice president and his wife. Four people have been charged in the Fiat Chrysler investigation.

General Motors,2017-12,"Bus ridership is falling nationwide, according to the American Public Transportation Association, and transit officials say they are trying to keep a lid on fares."
General Motors,2017-12,"The technology is still a gamble for many cities, says Chris Stoddart, an executive at Canadian bus maker New Flyer Industries Inc . A top supplier of conventional buses to the U.S. market, the company has just a handful of pure battery electrics in service."
General Motors,2017-12,"""People worry about being an early adopter. Remember 20 years ago someone paid $20,000 for a plasma TV and then 10 years later it was $900 at Best Buy,"" said Stoddart, senior vice president of engineering and customer service for New Flyer. ""People just don't want a science project."""
General Motors,2017-12,Rival electric bus manufacturers expect dramatic growth; the most ambitious forecasts call for all bus purchases to be electric by 2030.
General Motors,2017-12,"But even green-energy advocates are skeptical of such rosy predictions. CALSTART, a California-based nonprofit that promotes clean transportation, figures 50 percent to 60 percent of new buses will be zero emissions by 2030. Market research firm Navigant Research expects electric buses to make up 27 percent of new U.S. bus sales by 2027."
General Motors,2017-12,"Transit agencies have found EV performance lags in extreme conditions. In environmentally friendly San Francisco, officials have resisted electrics over concerns about the city's famously steep hills."
General Motors,2017-12,"""The technology isn't quite there yet,"" Erica Kato, a spokeswoman for the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency, said in a statement."
General Motors,2017-12,"An electric bus tested last year near Phoenix wilted in the summer heat due to the strains of running the air conditioning. The vehicle never achieved more than 89.9 miles on a charge, less than two-thirds of its advertised range, according to a report by the Valley Metro Regional Public Transportation Authority."
General Motors,2017-12,"In Massachusetts, two agencies running small numbers of electric buses - the Pioneer Valley Transit Authority in Springfield and Worcester's Regional Transit Authority - say the vehicles weaken in extreme cold and snow. They have no plans to acquire additional EVs, officials at those agencies said."
General Motors,2017-12,"Even places with successful pilots have downplayed expectations. Seattle's King County Metro transit agency soon will be operating more than a dozen vehicles by three manufacturers, according to Pete Melin, director of zero emission fleet technologies. The agency likes what it has seen so far."
General Motors,2017-12,"Still, Melin said, high electricity rates from the local utility at peak demand periods are a concern. And the lack of a uniform charging system among bus makers has complicated Seattle's goal of running an all-electric fleet by 2034."
General Motors,2017-12,"""We have caveats to becoming zero emissions,"" Melin said in an interview."
General Motors,2017-12,"Another worry is government funding. Federal money for bus purchases is about 25 percent lower than it was five years ago, according to Rob Healy, vice president of government affairs for the American Public Transportation Association."
General Motors,2017-12,An Obama-era program that sets aside $55 million a year in grants to help transit agencies purchase clean buses will expire in 2020 if not renewed by Congress.
General Motors,2017-12,"In addition to New Flyer, the fledgling U.S. electric bus industry has two other major players: Chinese automaker BYD, which is backed by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc ; and Silicon Valley startup Proterra Inc."
General Motors,2017-12,"BYD and Proterra began selling electric buses into the U.S. market several years ago, and have 165 and 126 vehicles on the road today, respectively."
General Motors,2017-12,"Both are ramping up U.S. manufacturing on expectations that EVs will account for nearly all new bus sales in a little over a decade. BYD has a plant in Lancaster, California, while Proterra has manufacturing facilities in City of Industry, California and Greenville, South Carolina."
General Motors,2017-12,"Buffett paid $230 million for a 10 percent stake in BYD in 2008. Today the company has a market capitalization of $25 billion, thanks mainly to China's aggressive move to electrify transportation. More than 15 percent of the 608,600 buses in China are pure electric, according to government data."
General Motors,2017-12,"Proterra investors include venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and the venture capital arm of General Motors Co . Proterra, based in Burlingame, California, is planning an initial public offering, but would not give a timeline for the debut."
General Motors,2017-12,"Chief Executive Ryan Popple said range is improving quickly. The company is currently shipping models with up to 350 miles of range, but new battery technology is expected to boost that by nearly 30 percent."
General Motors,2017-12,"""We're starting to outstrip the market requirement in terms of what city buses actually do,"" Popple said. ""It opens up new markets for us."""
General Motors,2017-12,"Notably, Proterra's growth should also lift the fortunes of U.S. wind blade maker TPI Composites Inc , which struck a deal to build up to 3,350 lightweight bus bodies for the EV bus maker over the next five years. Raymond James analyst Pavel Molchanov estimated the deal could account for 12 percent of Scottsdale, Arizona-based TPI's revenue in 2019."
General Motors,2017-12,"Winnipeg-based New Flyer, meanwhile, has won some big orders, including a deal to supply up to 100 electric buses to Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority. Still, company executives view electrification as a gradual transformation."
General Motors,2017-12,"""It's going to be a slow, methodical rather than an absolute disruption type environment,"" CEO Paul Soubry said on a conference call with analysts last month."
General Motors,2017-12,"Despite the technology's limitations, some U.S. transit agencies are hitting the accelerator on their electric conversions. IndyGo, which serves greater Indianapolis, has struck a deal with BYD to purchase 31 electric buses, with the option to add dozens more, in addition to the 21 already in its fleet, according to an IndyGo board of directors meeting report from July. Agency spokesman Bryan Luellen said the EVs have reduced fuel and maintenance costs by up to half compared to conventional buses."
General Motors,2017-12,"Foothill Transit, in Southern California, has been operating Proterra buses since 2010. It now has 17 in its fleet, with 13 more scheduled to arrive before the end of the year, according to spokeswoman Felicia Friesema."
General Motors,2017-12,"Still, both agencies acknowledged trade-offs due to the limited range of these vehicles. Foothill has mainly confined its electric buses to a short 16-mile route. The Indianapolis EVs run primarily during the morning and evening rush hours, not all day long like the diesel workhorses that remain the mainstay of the fleet."
General Motors,2017-12,"Still, IndyGo's Luellen figures the best is yet to come."

General Motors,2017-12,"Bus ridership is falling nationwide, according to the American Public Transportation Association, and transit officials say they are trying to keep a lid on fares."
General Motors,2017-12,"The technology is still a gamble for many cities, says Chris Stoddart, an executive at Canadian bus maker New Flyer Industries Inc . A top supplier of conventional buses to the U.S. market, the company has just a handful of pure battery electrics in service."
General Motors,2017-12,"""People worry about being an early adopter. Remember 20 years ago someone paid $20,000 for a plasma TV and then 10 years later it was $900 at Best Buy,"" said Stoddart, senior vice president of engineering and customer service for New Flyer. ""People just don't want a science project."""
General Motors,2017-12,Rival electric bus manufacturers expect dramatic growth; the most ambitious forecasts call for all bus purchases to be electric by 2030.
General Motors,2017-12,"But even green-energy advocates are skeptical of such rosy predictions. CALSTART, a California-based nonprofit that promotes clean transportation, figures 50 percent to 60 percent of new buses will be zero emissions by 2030. Market research firm Navigant Research expects electric buses to make up 27 percent of new U.S. bus sales by 2027."
General Motors,2017-12,"Transit agencies have found EV performance lags in extreme conditions. In environmentally friendly San Francisco, officials have resisted electrics over concerns about the city's famously steep hills."
General Motors,2017-12,"""The technology isn't quite there yet,"" Erica Kato, a spokeswoman for the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency, said in a statement."
General Motors,2017-12,"An electric bus tested last year near Phoenix wilted in the summer heat due to the strains of running the air conditioning. The vehicle never achieved more than 89.9 miles on a charge, less than two-thirds of its advertised range, according to a report by the Valley Metro Regional Public Transportation Authority."
General Motors,2017-12,"In Massachusetts, two agencies running small numbers of electric buses - the Pioneer Valley Transit Authority in Springfield and Worcester's Regional Transit Authority - say the vehicles weaken in extreme cold and snow. They have no plans to acquire additional EVs, officials at those agencies said."
General Motors,2017-12,"Even places with successful pilots have downplayed expectations. Seattle's King County Metro transit agency soon will be operating more than a dozen vehicles by three manufacturers, according to Pete Melin, director of zero emission fleet technologies. The agency likes what it has seen so far."
General Motors,2017-12,"Still, Melin said, high electricity rates from the local utility at peak demand periods are a concern. And the lack of a uniform charging system among bus makers has complicated Seattle's goal of running an all-electric fleet by 2034."
General Motors,2017-12,"""We have caveats to becoming zero emissions,"" Melin said in an interview."
General Motors,2017-12,"Another worry is government funding. Federal money for bus purchases is about 25 percent lower than it was five years ago, according to Rob Healy, vice president of government affairs for the American Public Transportation Association."
General Motors,2017-12,An Obama-era program that sets aside $55 million a year in grants to help transit agencies purchase clean buses will expire in 2020 if not renewed by Congress.
General Motors,2017-12,"In addition to New Flyer, the fledgling U.S. electric bus industry has two other major players: Chinese automaker BYD, which is backed by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc ; and Silicon Valley startup Proterra Inc."
General Motors,2017-12,"BYD and Proterra began selling electric buses into the U.S. market several years ago, and have 165 and 126 vehicles on the road today, respectively."
General Motors,2017-12,"Both are ramping up U.S. manufacturing on expectations that EVs will account for nearly all new bus sales in a little over a decade. BYD has a plant in Lancaster, California, while Proterra has manufacturing facilities in City of Industry, California and Greenville, South Carolina."
General Motors,2017-12,"Buffett paid $230 million for a 10 percent stake in BYD in 2008. Today the company has a market capitalization of $25 billion, thanks mainly to China's aggressive move to electrify transportation. More than 15 percent of the 608,600 buses in China are pure electric, according to government data."
General Motors,2017-12,"Proterra investors include venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and the venture capital arm of General Motors Co . Proterra, based in Burlingame, California, is planning an initial public offering, but would not give a timeline for the debut."
General Motors,2017-12,"Chief Executive Ryan Popple said range is improving quickly. The company is currently shipping models with up to 350 miles of range, but new battery technology is expected to boost that by nearly 30 percent."
General Motors,2017-12,"""We're starting to outstrip the market requirement in terms of what city buses actually do,"" Popple said. ""It opens up new markets for us."""
General Motors,2017-12,"Notably, Proterra's growth should also lift the fortunes of U.S. wind blade maker TPI Composites Inc , which struck a deal to build up to 3,350 lightweight bus bodies for the EV bus maker over the next five years. Raymond James analyst Pavel Molchanov estimated the deal could account for 12 percent of Scottsdale, Arizona-based TPI's revenue in 2019."
General Motors,2017-12,"Winnipeg-based New Flyer, meanwhile, has won some big orders, including a deal to supply up to 100 electric buses to Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority. Still, company executives view electrification as a gradual transformation."
General Motors,2017-12,"""It's going to be a slow, methodical rather than an absolute disruption type environment,"" CEO Paul Soubry said on a conference call with analysts last month."
General Motors,2017-12,"Despite the technology's limitations, some U.S. transit agencies are hitting the accelerator on their electric conversions. IndyGo, which serves greater Indianapolis, has struck a deal with BYD to purchase 31 electric buses, with the option to add dozens more, in addition to the 21 already in its fleet, according to an IndyGo board of directors meeting report from July. Agency spokesman Bryan Luellen said the EVs have reduced fuel and maintenance costs by up to half compared to conventional buses."
General Motors,2017-12,"Foothill Transit, in Southern California, has been operating Proterra buses since 2010. It now has 17 in its fleet, with 13 more scheduled to arrive before the end of the year, according to spokeswoman Felicia Friesema."
General Motors,2017-12,"Still, both agencies acknowledged trade-offs due to the limited range of these vehicles. Foothill has mainly confined its electric buses to a short 16-mile route. The Indianapolis EVs run primarily during the morning and evening rush hours, not all day long like the diesel workhorses that remain the mainstay of the fleet."
General Motors,2017-12,"Still, IndyGo's Luellen figures the best is yet to come."
General Motors,2017-12,"""With battery technology evolving rapidly we think it's a big opportunity for us to maximize our budget and do more,"" he said."

General Motors,2017-12,"DETROIT, Dec 7 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co will begin testing its latest self-driving vehicle technology next year in at least one city but has not changed its plan to begin commercial production until 2021, the company said."
General Motors,2017-12,"The automaker said on Thursday that it would test self-driving prototypes in various pilot programs with partners such as Lyft, the ride services company in which rival General Motors Co owns a minority stake, and Domino's Pizza Inc . However, Ford has still not decided whether to operate its own on-demand transportation service."
General Motors,2017-12,"In a blog post, Jim Farley, president of global markets, said Ford also would test new business models that involve its self-driving vehicles, including the movement of people and goods."

General Motors,2017-12,"Ford is shifting production of a future battery electric vehicle to Mexico to free up capacity at its Flat Rock, Michigan, plant to build the self-driving vehicles in 2021, according to spokesman Alan Hall."
General Motors,2017-12,"The electric vehicle, whose more-advanced battery system will enable a driving range of more than 300 miles, will go into production in 2020 at Ford's Cuatitlan plant, which suppliers say will also build a new hybrid crossover vehicle around the same time."

General Motors,2017-12,"BEIJING, Dec 6 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co is expected to sign as early as Thursday a deal with Alibaba Group Holding Ltd which may allow the U.S. automaker to test selling cars to consumers in China through Alibaba's online retail arm Tmall, as well as via a new ""auto vending machine"" store concept, according to a Ford source familiar with the matter."
General Motors,2017-12,"Representatives of Ford and Alibaba, including Ford Executive Chairman Bill Ford Jr. and Ford CEO Jim Hackett, are expected to be in Hangzhou on Thursday to sign a letter of intent that outlines the scope of the new partnership."
General Motors,2017-12,"According to the source, who did not want to be named because he is not authorized to speak with reporters, the deal is intended to position the Dearborn, Michigan, automaker for an emerging Chinese marketplace where more cars could be sold online."
General Motors,2017-12,The partnership would be part of Ford's effort to overhaul its China strategy to revive the growth momentum it has lost in recent months.
General Motors,2017-12,"Ford's global chief spokesman Mark Truby said the company is expected to make an announcement on Thursday in Hangzhou, where Alibaba is based, but declined to comment in advance."
General Motors,2017-12,The source said the proposal could mean that cars purchased online are delivered to buyers by franchised Ford retail stores and would be maintained and repaired by them.
General Motors,2017-12,"According to Alibaba, consumers can use their phones to browse through the cars garaged in the store and choose to either immediately buy one or test drive it. The vehicle would be delivered to them on the ground floor."
General Motors,2017-12,"The model allows shoppers with good credit to purchase their new ride with a 10 percent down payment and then make monthly payments for the car purchase through Alibaba's affiliate Alipay, according to Alibaba."
General Motors,2017-12,"Ford believes dealers would likely agree to this direct retailing model because they still get to service cars sold through Tmall, the Ford source said."
General Motors,2017-12,"The move, though, could be potentially problematic for dealers, some industry experts said."
General Motors,2017-12,"""When online sales and direct sales volume was small that's one thing. But if this format gained steam, it would definitely impact dealers,"" according to Yale Zhang, head of Shanghai-based consultancy Automotive Foresight. ""Retail innovation is great, but it is by its nature disruptive and can't keep everybody happy."""
General Motors,2017-12,The danger is that the dealers lose out not only on a lot of car sales but also the potentially lucrative auto financing aspect of their traditional business.
General Motors,2017-12,"Direct selling by auto brands is not always possible in many markets around the world. In the United States, for example, because of franchise auto dealer operators' political clout, except for a small number of states, direct selling is largely not possible."
General Motors,2017-12,"The source said Ford is ""behind in using big data"" to monitor sales trends and effectively market its cars and the move to online sales as well as the access to Tmall's massive database of information on consumers would help it to catch up."
General Motors,2017-12,"Online auto sales volumes are currently limited in China because car buyers want to be able to see, touch and drive cars before buying them, said Zhang. The ability to test drive a car ordered online could change that."
General Motors,2017-12,"Ford's China sales have been sluggish in recent months in part because it has failed to catch on to rapidly changing trends in the marketplace, including the rise of entry-level cars popular in smaller and less-well-known cities, where demand is booming."
General Motors,2017-12,"Ford's sales in the first 10 months of this year were 938,570, a decline of 5 percent from the same period in 2016, against a 2.2 percent gains to 3.13 million for hometown rival General Motors ."

General Motors,2017-12,"DETROIT, Dec 1 (Reuters) - Major automakers posted mixed U.S. November new vehicle sales on Friday and predicted a competitive December as they rush to sell vehicles and boost their 2017 numbers before the year comes to an end."
General Motors,2017-12,"Automakers are trying to sell down 2017 model year vehicles, offering high discounts to consumers as the year-end nears. In 2016, the industry reported record annual sales of 17.55 million units."
General Motors,2017-12,"The seasonally adjusted annualized rate of U.S. car and light truck sales in November fell to 17.48 million vehicles, down from 17.71 million vehicles a year earlier, according to Autodata Corp, which tracks industry sales. This was roughly in line with the 17.5 million predicted by analysts polled by Thomson Reuters."
General Motors,2017-12,"According to consultancies J.D. Power and LMC, discounts have been above 10 percent of the average transaction price for 16 of the last 17 months, a level experts say is unhealthy and unsustainable. [nL1N1NU19X]"
General Motors,2017-12,"The November sales results come as the National Automobile Dealers Association said on Friday it expects new vehicle sales to decline to 16.7 million units in 2018, after dropping to 17.1 million for the full year in 2017. [nL1N1O110A]"
General Motors,2017-12,"If that forecast comes true, the race to move new vehicles off dealers' lots will only intensify next year."
General Motors,2017-12,"Brandon Mason, a director at PwC's automotive practice, said a worrying trend for the industry was a rising number of subprime loans. He said subprime levels are at just over 20 percent of originations, against more than 30 percent prior to the Great Recession, but recent increases remain a concern."
General Motors,2017-12,"""That's a bit of a red flag,"" Mason said. ""It's something to keep an eye on as we move into 2018."""
General Motors,2017-12,"No. 1 U.S. automaker General Motors Co said its sales fell 2.9 percent in November, with sales to consumers flat against the same month in 2016. Much of the decrease was driven by lower fleet sales to rental agencies, businesses and government agencies."
General Motors,2017-12,"GM said strong SUV and crossover sales pushed its average transaction price for the month above $37,000 for the first time. The company's level of unsold cars, which has been a concern for analysts and the industry, rose slightly to 83 days supply, from 80 days at the end of October."
General Motors,2017-12,"""More vehicles are sold in December than any other month and we are very well positioned because we have momentum in so many segments, but especially in crossovers,"" said Kurt McNeil, U.S. vice president of sales operations."
General Motors,2017-12,Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCA) in particular has targeted a significant reduction in this type of sale in 2017.
General Motors,2017-12,"The automaker posted a 4 percent overall decrease in sales for November, but said fleet sales were down 25 percent while sales to consumers were up 2 percent on the year."
General Motors,2017-12,"No. 2 U.S. automaker Ford Motor Co reported a 6.7 percent increase in sales in November, with fleet sales up nearly 26 percent and retail sales 1.3 percent higher than in November 2016."

General Motors,2017-12,"{{20171130T234941.909+0000}}UPDATE 2-Influential U.S. auto union caucus nominates regional head for president(Adds biographical details of nominee, background)"
General Motors,2017-12,"DETROIT, Nov 30 (Reuters) - An influential caucus at the United Auto Workers nominated on Thursday a regional director as candidate for union president as the UAW struggles to organize auto plants and faces a probe into alleged misuse of funds at training centers funded by Detroit's automakers."
General Motors,2017-12,"The caucus, named for renowned former UAW President Walter Reuther, nominated Gary Jones, director of the union's region 5 covering 17 Western and Southwestern states, for a four-year term."
General Motors,2017-12,"For the past seven decades, the Reuther Caucus's nominee has won election as union president. The UAW will hold a leadership election in June."
General Motors,2017-12,"Current UAW President Dennis Williams was elected in 2014 and will turn 65 in 2018, which would bar him from re-election."
General Motors,2017-12,"Based in Kansas City, Missouri, where he has been regional director since 2012, Jones is far removed from the Justice Department probe into alleged misuse of funds at the UAW training centers in the Detroit area. [nL2N1N8232]"
General Motors,2017-12,"Jones joined the UAW in 1975 when he was hired at a Ford Motor Co plant in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma. He has worked for the union in various roles since 1990."
General Motors,2017-12,"The UAW's next president will have to steer the union through challenging contract negotiations with General Motors Co , Ford and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV in 2019."
General Motors,2017-12,"After a boom running from 2010 to record annual sales of 17.55 million units in 2016, new vehicle sales are expected to decline slightly this year, followed by further decreases in 2018 and 2019."
General Motors,2017-12,"Industry consultant LMC predicts U.S. new vehicle sales will dip to 16.8 million units in 2019, likely portending a much tougher round of contract talks than in 2015 when automakers were on an upswing."
General Motors,2017-12,"UAW membership has crept up since the end of the 2007-2009 recession, but is about half of what it was in 1998 and well below a peak of 1.5 million members in 1979. The Detroit automakers and their suppliers have slashed workforces at UAW-represented factories over the past 30 years as they have automated and lost sales to European and Asian rivals."
General Motors,2017-12,"Earlier this month, workers at a Chinese-owned auto glass plant in southwestern Ohio voted heavily against union representation. The UAW lost the vote at Fuyao Glass Industry Group Co Ltd <600660.SS> by a 2-to-1 margin. [nL1N1NG04X]"
General Motors,2017-12,"The union also lost a bitterly contested vote at a Nissan Motor Co Ltd <7201.T> plant in Mississippi in August, adding to a decades-long record of failure to organize a major automaker's plant in the U.S. South. [nL1N1KR04I]"
General Motors,2017-12,{{20171130T205831.809+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-GM drives towards self-disruption(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.)
General Motors,2017-12,"NEW YORK, Nov 30 (Reuters Breakingviews) - General Motors is driving towards self-disruption. At an event in San Francisco on Thursday the biggest U.S. automaker showed off its autonomous-vehicle strategy. The $61 billion company run by Mary Barra is even teasing the prospect that in a decade or so it could make more money from robo-taxis than its current business."
General Motors,2017-12,"GM argues that it controls most of the process, from mass-production of cars to self-driving technology and data. So it won't have to share proceeds. By contrast Uber [UBER.UL], for example, is buying its cars from Volvo ."
General Motors,2017-12,"Second, Barra's engineers think they can take battery costs below $100 per kilowatt-hour from the present $145 per kWh. And Strobe, a recent acquisition, will soon build crucial light-detection and ranging sensors for just $300 a unit - down from $20,000."
General Motors,2017-12,"Greater utilization of vehicles, better maintenance and a raft of marketable data on everything from traffic to weather would add to the juice. It could take an automaker's lifetime revenue from a car to ""several hundreds of thousands of dollars"" from around $30,000 at present, according to Amman."
General Motors,2017-12,Being first to market is critical. GM is the only player that has been testing self-driving vehicles in bustling cities. On Thursday the company confirmed it expects to deploy a commercial fleet of robo-taxis in 2019. That puts pressure on Uber and Alphabet's Waymo division as well as Ford Motor and other traditional rivals.
General Motors,2017-12,Much could go wrong. But shareholders and competitors alike now have to reckon with a company that is no longer their parents' General Motors.

General Motors,2017-12,"""We have a path to take 40 percent of the cost out of ride services,"" Stevens said on the same call. Lowering the cost to below $1 per mile by 2025 from about $2.50 today could result in margins of 20 to 30 percent, he said."
General Motors,2017-12,Using a vehicle for a robo-taxi service - rather than GM's current business model of building cars for individual customers - could increase revenue generation exponentially because the vehicle could be continuously used by multiple users over its lifespan.

General Motors,2017-12,{{20171130T140917.921+0000}}ANALYSIS-Luxury auto brands adopt new strategies as the old run out of gasBy Joseph White
General Motors,2017-12,"LOS ANGELES, Nov 30 (Reuters) - Success in the United States used to come easily for German automaker BMW AG , whose sporty sedans in three sizes would be snapped up by affluent consumers."
General Motors,2017-12,"The premium auto business has now become more complicated, as illustrated by the BMW models displayed at this week's Los Angeles auto show, amid a backdrop of heavy spending by luxury auto brands on new models and technology as they make awkward leaps from a predictable past to an uncertain future."
General Motors,2017-12,"On one side of BMW's display stood a prototpye of a large X7 sport utility vehicle, a vehicle that was unthinkable in its lineup a few years ago when the top of the line was still defined as a large sedan."
General Motors,2017-12,"On the other side, BMW displayed the iVision, a prototype of an electric sedan that will rival Silicon Valley electric luxury car maker Tesla Inc's Model S when the production version, or non-prototype version, launches in 2021."
General Motors,2017-12,"""This is the future,"" said Bernhard Kuhnt, the new head of BMW's North American operations, referring to the iVision and electric vehicles in general."
General Motors,2017-12,"More immediately, Kuhnt said, the X7 represents BMW's determination to offer more sport utility vehicles, which now account for more than half of luxury vehicle sales in the United States, to reverse a four percent slide in sales this year through October."
General Motors,2017-12,"""In October, we sold 60 percent sedans in a market that is 55 percent SUVs,"" he said."
General Motors,2017-12,"But next year, as BMW's U.S. dealers get more newly redesigned X3 SUVs, and a new X2 sport utility, the SUV-to-sedan ratio will start to flip, and sales should grow, he said."
General Motors,2017-12,BMW's rivals are at different points in their own jumps from the strategies that fueled growth during the past two decades. The type of vehicle that defines the top of the line for German luxury brands shows how the business is changing.
General Motors,2017-12,"""The classic definition of the standard bearer as a three-box sedan, that is migrating in three directions,"" said Scott Keogh, head of U.S. operations for Volkswagen AG's Audi brand."
General Motors,2017-12,"One direction, he said, is ""electrification as the new prestige,"" a trend driven by Tesla."
General Motors,2017-12,Rivals at other established luxury brands agreed during interviews at the LA show that some form of electric power - fully electric or plug-in hybrids - is now necessary in order to compete.
General Motors,2017-12,"""The U.S. is a market where customers are asking for electric"" vehicles, Hakan Samuelsson, chief executive of Volvo Cars, said in an interview on the sidelines of the LA auto show Wednesday. ""That's a premium value - to be carbon free."""
General Motors,2017-12,Volvo has said it will engineer all its vehicles to rely on full or partial electric power starting in 2019.
General Motors,2017-12,German luxury car makers have announced aggressive plans to expand their electric vehicle lineups.[nL5N1LT47Z]
General Motors,2017-12,"Another way the market is veering away from sedans is with the rise of the large, luxury SUV, now available in most luxury brands at prices that can easily top $100,000. Jaguar Land Rover, owned by India's Tata Motors Ltd, is displaying a $207,900, 557-horsepower Range Rover model at the LA show."
General Motors,2017-12,"Audi plans to launch a Q8 SUV next year that will add a more luxurious SUV to the top of its U.S. lineup, Keogh said. Two large luxury SUVs are now sold for each large luxury sedan, Audi reckons.[nL1N1NU0Y5]"
General Motors,2017-12,"Daimler AG's Mercedes-Benz brand used the Los Angeles show to debut an example of a third trend. The new generation of the Mercedes CLS coupe joins Audi's A7 and the Porsche Panamera in a stable of large, premium, sporty fastbacks."
General Motors,2017-12,"Not to be outdone, BMW is displaying a large, sleek coupe of its own, the 8-series."
