Ford Motor,2017-4,"May 2 (Reuters) - General Motors Co said on Tuesday it would take a charge of up to $100 million after a judge ordered the seizure of its plant in Valencia last month, a move that prompted the halting of its operations in Venezuela."
Ford Motor,2017-4,"The largest U.S. automaker said it was deconsolidating its business in the country following the seizure of its Valencia plant on April 18 by judicial authorities, which led GM to fire 2,700 workers. [nL1N1HS221] The plant had not produced a car since the beginning of 2016 because of parts shortages and strict currency controls."
Ford Motor,2017-4,"GM, the market leader in Venezuela for 35 years, said executives have expressed a willingness ""to talk with government officials and union leaders about the circumstances under which it could be possible to start production and employ some number of workers with a new, viable business model."""
Ford Motor,2017-4,"Total auto production in Venezuela fell to a historic low of 2,849 cars in 2016, about 75 percent less than the year before, according to Venezuela's automotive industry group."
Ford Motor,2017-4,"In the first two months of 2017, total Venezuelan auto production was just 240 vehicles, down 50 percent over the same period last year."
Ford Motor,2017-4,"Declining auto production comes amid rising protests. On Tuesday, Venezuela's opposition was blocking streets to decry unpopular leftist President Nicolas Maduro's decision to create a new super-body known as a ""constituent assembly,"" a move they say is a veiled attempt to cling to power by avoiding elections."
Ford Motor,2017-4,Venezuela's car industry has been hit by a lack of raw materials stemming from complex currency controls.
Ford Motor,2017-4,"Nearly all vehicles built in Venezuela in the first two months this year were assembled by Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T>, which said last month its plant was operating normally. But the company said it was ""only producing based on orders that come in."""
Ford Motor,2017-4,"In early 2015, Ford Motor Co wrote off its investment in Venezuela when it took an $800 million pretax writedown. The company does not currently produce vehicles in Venezuela."
Ford Motor,2017-4,"The South American nation's economic crisis has hurt many other U.S. companies, including food makers and pharmaceutical firms. A growing number of them, like GM, have removed their Venezuelan operations from their consolidated accounts."

Ford Motor,2017-4,"DETROIT, May 2 (Reuters) - General Motors Co, Ford Motor Co and Toyota Motor Corp, the top three automakers in the United States, on Tuesday all posted lower new vehicle sales in April in a fresh sign the long boom cycle for the auto industry is losing steam."
Ford Motor,2017-4,"No. 1 U.S. automaker GM reported a 6 percent decline in April sales to 244,406 vehicles, but said the month continued to see strong growth for crossovers and trucks."
Ford Motor,2017-4,"Over the past couple of years, U.S. consumers have increasingly shunned cars in favor of larger crossovers, SUVs and trucks."
Ford Motor,2017-4,"New vehicle sales have risen ever since the end of the Great Recession, hitting a record of 17.55 million units in 2016. But as consumer appetite for new cars has waned, automakers have raised discounts to get vehicles off dealer lots."
Ford Motor,2017-4,GM said the average transaction price for its vehicles rose in the first quarter and that its consumer discounts were equivalent to 11.7 percent of the transaction price. The automaker also said its inventory level had risen to 100 days of supply at the end of April versus around 70 days at the end of 2016.
Ford Motor,2017-4,"GM has said it will bring inventories down by the end of 2017, but the most recent level has created concern among analysts."
Ford Motor,2017-4,"Ford, the No. 2 U.S. automaker, said sales were down 7.2 percent in April, with sales to consumers down 10.5 percent. Car sales dropped 21 percent and trucks declined 4.2 percent, while SUV sales rose 1.2 percent."
Ford Motor,2017-4,"Toyota <7203.T> said sales fell 4.4 percent in April, with its luxury Lexus brand posting an 11.1 percent drop. U.S. car sales at the Japanese automaker were down 10.4 percent, while truck sales were up 2.1 percent."

Ford Motor,2017-4,"{{20170427T162534.105+0000}}Manufacturers, Wall Street getting Trump's ear in first 100 daysBy Jason Lange"
Ford Motor,2017-4,"WASHINGTON, April 27 (Reuters) - Manufacturers and Wall Street have led the quest for business access to President Donald Trump in his first 100 days in office, with media companies and Silicon Valley seldom entering the presidential bubble, a Reuters review found."
Ford Motor,2017-4,"Since inauguration day on Jan. 20, top executives from at least 186 companies have visited with Trump or senior advisers at the White House or on presidential trips, including those to Mar-a-Lago, the private, seaside Florida club where he spends many weekends."
Ford Motor,2017-4,"Some of the meetings have been reported in the press. But Reuters analyzed more than 900 White House press pool reports to give the first big picture view, albeit an incomplete one, of who has had the most and least success at bending the president's ear."
Ford Motor,2017-4,"Such access can be crucial for companies, with Trump regularly passing judgment and making proposals on business issues such as trade, taxes, immigration and regulation."
Ford Motor,2017-4,"The review showed Trump listening closely to some segments of Corporate America, though perhaps neglecting the dynamic technology and entertainment sectors, both powerful U.S. export industries."
Ford Motor,2017-4,"Tim Cook, CEO of Apple Inc , and other tech leaders met with Trump before his inauguration. [nL1N1E90NI]"
Ford Motor,2017-4,"Access sometimes means influence, but it was likely too soon to tell, after less than 100 days, whether Trump's actions have disproportionately favored big manufacturers and Wall Street."
Ford Motor,2017-4,"Industrial power-houses have led the way on access, including companies with the clout to make significant hiring decisions: Ford Motor Co CEO Mark Fields has met with Trump at least four times; General Motors CEO Mary Barra, at least four times; and Boeing representatives, at least three times."
Ford Motor,2017-4,The Reuters review helps fill a blank in the Trump record that opened in mid-April when he put the White House visitor logs off-limits to the public. They had been mostly public under Obama.
Ford Motor,2017-4,Transparency advocates have warned that Trump's decision will make it harder to hold him accountable. [nL1N1HM0KQ] [nL1N1HI1PS]
Ford Motor,2017-4,"""A public record of who has the president's ear is more important than it has ever been,"" said John Wonderlich, executive director of the Sunlight Foundation, a nonprofit good-government advocacy group."
Ford Motor,2017-4,"The review showed about half of the companies that have made it into the Trump inner circle through April 21, day 92 of his presidency, were manufacturers or financial firms - asset managers, insurers and banks ranging from Wall Street giants such as Citigroup to small community banks."
Ford Motor,2017-4,"Financier Stephen Schwarzman, who chairs a presidential advisory forum of business leaders, is CEO of the Blackstone Group , the largest manager of private equity and real estate assets. He was spotted by the press pool aboard Air Force 1 on Feb. 3 when the president was traveling to Mar-a-Lago. Schwarzman also attended at least three meetings with Trump and other executives."
Ford Motor,2017-4,"Almost all of Trump's meetings were group encounters with 10 or more executives sitting down with the president and White House officials in events billed as listening sessions, roundtable discussions or town halls."
Ford Motor,2017-4,"A few were more intimate encounters, such as on March 18, when Ike Perlmutter, CEO of Marvel Entertainment, a Walt Disney Corp. subsidiary, met with the president in Mar-a-Lago before having dinner with the president, first lady Melania Trump and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross."
Ford Motor,2017-4,"Perlmutter, however, was one of few executives from media companies seen by pool reporters in meetings with Trump."
Ford Motor,2017-4,"Information technology firms, which enjoyed significant access to former President Barack Obama, have had less access to Trump than legacy manufacturers such as auto and steel makers. IBM CEO Ginni Rometty attended three meetings with Trump, but was one of only a few CEOs from big tech firms seen at the White House."
Ford Motor,2017-4,"Manufacturers and financiers also enjoyed access to the White House under Obama, according to a Reuters review in December 2015 of White House visitor logs."
Ford Motor,2017-4,"The recent Reuters review is not comprehensive since the press pool, though dogged and alert, may have missed some of Trump's meetings with business leaders."
Ford Motor,2017-4,"The pool is a rotation of journalists from several outlets, including Reuters, who follow Trump and get briefings from White House officials on some, but not all of his meetings."

Ford Motor,2017-4,"DETROIT, April 27 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co reported a lower quarterly net profit on Thursday but beat analyst expectations amid higher commodity, engineering and recall costs, and a drop in vehicle sales"
Ford Motor,2017-4,"The No. 2 U.S. automaker, which reiterated its pretax profit forecast for 2017, warned investors in late March that higher costs and lower sales volumes would hurt quarterly earnings."
Ford Motor,2017-4,"Chief Financial Officer Bob Shanks told reporters at the company's headquarters in Dearborn, Michigan, that additional costs made this the ""toughest quarter"" for 2017."
Ford Motor,2017-4,"Shanks said Ford's results for the rest of the year would be ""about flat to a little bit better"" compared with 2016."
Ford Motor,2017-4,The company's results come at a time of uncertainty for the U.S. auto industry following disappointing sales in March. [nL2N1HE0JN]
Ford Motor,2017-4,"While sales of new vehicles have risen since the end of the Great Recession and hit 17.55 million units in 2016, analysts expect a slight sales decline in 2017. Ford said Thursday it expects industrywide sales to decrease a little this year and in 2018."
Ford Motor,2017-4,Ratings agencies have warned of worsening credit and there are concerns millions of nearly new leased vehicles due to flood the market over the next couple of years will depress used-car values and hurt U.S. automakers' sales.
Ford Motor,2017-4,"Shanks said Ford's own used-car values at its finance arm were down 7 percent compared to the same quarter in 2016, but said customers' credit scores remained high and we ""feel really good about where credit is."""
Ford Motor,2017-4,"""Clearly we're moving to a different stage of the cycle, but we think based on what we know that we've got it covered,"" he said."
Ford Motor,2017-4,"Ford's costs during the first quarter were hurt by two recalls in North America, one to replace potentially faulty side door latches and the other for under-hood fire risks. The company said it expects to spend $295 million to fix those problems. [nL2N1H60PE]"
Ford Motor,2017-4,Ford expects commodity costs to be around $1 billion higher this year. Shanks said around half of that will be due to higher steel prices.
Ford Motor,2017-4,"Ford maintained its expectation for a full-year 2017 pretax profit of around $9 billion, down from a record of $10.4 billion in 2016."
Ford Motor,2017-4,"The company reported a first-quarter net profit of $1.6 billion, or 40 cents a share, down 36 percent from $2.5 billion, or 61 cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts had, on average, expected earnings per share for the quarter of 35 cents."
Ford Motor,2017-4,Automotive revenue rose to $36.5 billion from $35.3 billion a year earlier. Analysts had expected $34.7 billion.

Ford Motor,2017-4,"In March, President Donald Trump ordered a review of U.S. vehicle fuel-efficiency standards from 2022-2025 put in place by the Obama administration, effectively reopening a process the Obama administration had ended ahead of an April 2018 deadline."
Ford Motor,2017-4,"In 2011, Obama said the rules would save motorists $1.7 trillion in fuel costs over the life of the vehicles, but cost the auto industry about $200 billion over 13 years. Automakers have said that cost estimate is low."
Ford Motor,2017-4,"California regulators, who had worked with the Obama administration on the current national fuel efficiency standards, have opposed weakening the rules."
Ford Motor,2017-4,California has threatened to pursue tougher standards unilaterally and could mount a legal challenge. New York has also threatened a fight if the Trump administration rolls back the Obama standards.

Ford Motor,2017-4,"MILAN/DETROIT, April 26 (Reuters) - Fiat Chrysler Automobiles may seek more supplier partners to help it develop and build self-driving vehicles, Chief Executive Officer Sergio Marchionne said on Wednesday."
Ford Motor,2017-4,"The Jeep and Ram brands are strong enough to exist as standalone entities outside FCA, Marchionne also said on a conference call with analysts after the company reported record first-quarter results. But he did not elaborate on whether there were any plans for a spin-off of either, like with Ferrari."
Ford Motor,2017-4,"The automaker reported an 11 percent jump in first-quarter operating profit, boosted by strong sales in North America, its most profitable market. Shares jumped about 10 percent on the news. [nL8N1HY4VK]"
Ford Motor,2017-4,"FCA currently has a partnership with Alphabet Inc's Waymo self-driving unit. Marchionne said Waymo has an ""unbeatable solution"" to help build self-driving vehicles, including versions of the Chrysler Pacifica hybrid minivan, but that FCA is looking at additional partners."
Ford Motor,2017-4,"""Between now and the next three years, we need to provide viable solutions to take people around,"" Marchionne said, citing Waymo's new test program in Phoenix offering ride sharing in self-driving Pacificas. [nL1N1HX00V]"
Ford Motor,2017-4,"But FCA is considering more partners ""because banking all of our solutions on one possible outcome is going to be disastrous,"" Marchionne said. FCA continues to work with Waymo ""in a very intense way,"" he said, but ""we need to look at optionality in more than one dimension"" to build self-driving cars."
Ford Motor,2017-4,FCA is retooling several U.S. plants to produce redesigned versions of the popular Jeep Wrangler and Ram 1500 pickup later this year and early next. Marchionne said the company would continue to produce several versions of the current models for several months in 2018 after the new versions begin production.
Ford Motor,2017-4,"New models from premium brands Maserati and Alfa Romeo should help boost FCA's gross margins. Marchionne said Alfa, long a cash drain on the company, could be profitable in the fourth quarter, while Maserati has returned double-digit margins over the past three quarters. Both brands have launched new luxury utility vehicles in the United States."
Ford Motor,2017-4,"Marchionne said FCA hopes to resolve emissions certification issues ""in a few weeks"" with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the California Air Resources Board."

Ford Motor,2017-4,"WASHINGTON, April 26 (Reuters) - Major automakers and other groups are raising objections to the way Volkswagen AG wants to spend $2 billion on electric vehicle infrastructure and projects, as part of the German automaker's atonement for diesel emissions cheating."
Ford Motor,2017-4,"Volkswagen plans to install hundreds of EV charging stations nationwide as part of the 10-year plan. About $800 million of the total will be spent in California as part of a settlement with the government after the German automaker admitted to secretly installing cheating software in 580,000 diesel vehicles allowing them to emit excess pollution."
Ford Motor,2017-4,"The California Air Resources Board is considering whether to approve the $200 million spending plan for the first 30 months and is reviewing the 120 comments submitted, said spokesman Dave Clegern."
Ford Motor,2017-4,Automakers object to the proposed locations of some charging stations in areas that already have many electric vehicles and have concerns about competitive advantages VW could get from the program. An environmental group said more of the stations should be built in low-income areas.
Ford Motor,2017-4,"Also, Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T>, Honda Motor Co <7267.T> and Hyundai Motor Co <005380.KS> wrote a joint letter urging California to require Volkswagen to spend a ""significant portion"" of the money on hydrogen fuel cell fueling stations, saying the current commitment by California to get 100 such stations in place by 2020 is ""not on track."""
Ford Motor,2017-4,"In its initial California spending plan, Volkswagen wants to allocate $120 million to build more than 400 highway and community EV charging stations by 2019 in high-traffic areas. Several automakers said in their comments that they would prefer that the new charging stations be installed instead in areas that have little electric vehicle traffic."
Ford Motor,2017-4,"Ford Motor Co said it ""has reservations about having a key electrification driver dependent on and ultimately controlled by one automotive competitor."" Ford added VW should target areas where ""demonstrated market interest does not already exist."""
Ford Motor,2017-4,"BMW AG said Volkswagen ""should not be afforded an implicit comparative advantage through its ability to control day-to-day operations of consumer charging events"" such as waiting times, pricing and billing."
Ford Motor,2017-4,"Under the agreement with California and the Justice Department, funds spent on education and outreach must be brand-neutral and cannot feature Volkswagen vehicles. Charging stations must be accessible to all vehicles."
Ford Motor,2017-4,The three automakers who want Volkswagen to spend more on building hydrogen fueling stations are trying to sell fuel cell vehicles.
Ford Motor,2017-4,"Volkswagen declined to comment on the automaker letters, but said its goal is to ""make it easy for as many (zero emission vehicle) drivers as possible to enjoy the collective charging networks available."""

Ford Motor,2017-4,"WASHINGTON, April 25 (Reuters) - Automakers on Tuesday urged the state of California to further ease its proposed regulations for autonomous vehicles, saying the state did not respond to their earlier objections by making enough revisions to its planned set of rules for self-driving cars."
Ford Motor,2017-4,"At a public hearing in Sacramento monitored via webcast, automakers urged California to drop some additional proposed regulations and leave much of the oversight to the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. But safety and consumer advocates urged the state to adopt strict oversight, and an official from San Francisco said cities should have more local control."
Ford Motor,2017-4,"A number of automakers have said they plan to begin deploying self-driving vehicles, some in commercial fleets, by 2020-2021."
Ford Motor,2017-4,"Paul Scullion, a manager at the Association of Global Automakers, said California's proposed regulations go ""too far."""
Ford Motor,2017-4,"The group opposes California's plan to require a permit to deploy autonomous vehicles, which must meet performance and design criteria. ""We do not think requiring a permit to deploy is the right approach,"" Scullion said. Global Automakers said it opposes California's proposal that it could withdraw permits to deploy vehicles even if they met federal requirements."
Ford Motor,2017-4,"Ron Medford, director of safety at Alphabet Inc's self-driving unit Waymo, urged California to quickly issue final rules ""to provide manufacturers with the certainty that they need."""
Ford Motor,2017-4,"Brian Soublet, deputy director of the California Department of Motor Vehicles, said the agency will review written comments before unveiling final rules."
Ford Motor,2017-4,"Andre Welch, a Ford Motor Co official, asked the state to lift the proposed prohibition on testing self-driving vehicles weighing more than 10,000 pounds, such as multi-passenger shuttles."
Ford Motor,2017-4,"Existing California regulations require self-driving test vehicles to have conventional manual controls such as steering wheels and pedals, as well as a backup driver. California moved to change the rules as many states said they would allow testing of vehicles without conventional controls."
Ford Motor,2017-4,"In March, California's Department of Motor Vehicles revised proposed rules to allow testing by the end of the year of autonomous vehicles without human backup drivers."
Ford Motor,2017-4,"After objections from automakers, the proposal was revised to drop requirements that local communities approve testing and that companies generate a year of testing data before being allowed to deploy vehicles on public roads."

""We do not trust the auto manufacturers or the tech industry to protect the public in the absence of federal motors vehicle safety standards,"" said the group's president Rosemary Shahan."
Ford Motor,2017-4,"The group Consumer Watchdog called for stricter state rules, noting that there were not yet any federal standards for self-driving cars. In written comments, the group said relying on federal standards would amount to a ""meaningless house of cards."""

Ford Motor,2017-4,"Tom Maguire, an official at San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency, said in some cases the proposed rules ""rely too heavily on manufacturers' self certification of their safety technology."" The agency believes cities should have the authority to deny deployment and determine when and how testing occurs."
Ford Motor,2017-4,"General Motors Co official Paul Hemmersbaugh said California should drop plans to include separate privacy rules for driverless cars.

Ford Motor,2017-4,"The world's second biggest supplier to vehicle manufacturers by sales, Continental is also strengthening its expertise in automotive electronics as customers such as Volkswagen , Daimler and Ford raise their investments in electric and self-driving technologies."
Ford Motor,2017-4,"By raising spending on development of new products such as charging systems and battery management components, Continental may generate an additional 2 billion euros in sales by 2025, Chief Executive Elmar Degenhart said."
Ford Motor,2017-4,But the Hanover-based group also pledged to go on developing new products and systems for combustion-based power trains until at least 2025 when it expects demand for electric vehicles to start taking off on the back of continuing reductions in battery prices.
Ford Motor,2017-4,"""Flexibility will be the name of the game in the next five to 10 years,"" Degenhart said on a conference call to outline its so-called Strategy 2020 plan for its Powertrain division."
Ford Motor,2017-4,"Continental had said in January it was reviewing its strategy for the division after earnings at the business, whose products include transmission control units and fuel pumps, failed to meet expectations."
Ford Motor,2017-4,"The company, which is also a leading supplier of tyres and other rubber products, expects the market share of fully or at least semi-electrified cars to grow to about 60 percent of all vehicles by 2030 from around 35 percent in 2025."
Ford Motor,2017-4,"Demand for diesel cars has been declining across Europe, their main market, ever since the Volkswagen emissions scandal broke in September 2015, which led Continental to review strategy at the Powertrain division."
Ford Motor,2017-4,"Some investors had hoped for management to make structural changes at the division such as a reduction in business lines or even a sale of some of the diesel-related products, which include common-rail fuel injection systems."
Ford Motor,2017-4,"But Continental has refrained from making any radical changes even though the market share of diesel cars is falling faster than expected, pointing out that diesel-related sales account for less than 2 percent of the group's turnover."

Ford Motor,2017-4,"SHANGHAI, April 19 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co is taking a cautious approach to producing electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles for the Chinese market, citing uncertainty about consumer interest and government policy, despite a rush by carmakers to jump into the sector."
Ford Motor,2017-4,"""You don't get any prizes for being first to market,"" said Trevor Worthington, Ford's vice president for product development in Asia Pacific. The challenge is to offer electrified vehicles ""at the right time""."
Ford Motor,2017-4,"Ford earlier this month outlined plans to offer by 2025 hybrid or fully electric versions of all models built in China with its domestic joint venture partner, Chongqing Changan Automobile Co Ltd <000625.SZ>."
Ford Motor,2017-4,"However, Ford executives said how many such vehicles are built and sold will depend on factors including government subsidies, regulatory policy and when battery-electric cars can match the cost and fast refuelling of gasoline vehicles."
Ford Motor,2017-4,"During a meeting with reporters ahead of the Shanghai auto show on Wednesday, Worthington and Mazen Hammoud, the automaker's Asia Pacific powertrain director, said battery recharging would be a critical issue."
Ford Motor,2017-4,"""Our goal needs to be something on the order of less than half an hour"" to deliver an 80 percent charge, said Hammoud. Ultimately, ""the goal needs to be similar to refuelling a gasoline vehicle. We are a long way from that."""
Ford Motor,2017-4,"Worthington also said Ford has a ""team of people who meet with the government every week"" to discuss the still evolving policies designed to promote vehicle electrification."
Ford Motor,2017-4,"Reuters reported in March, citing industry executives, that China was considering easing proposed quotas aimed at producing more electric vehicles [nL3N1GQ4AT]. China has strongly supported and subsidized electric vehicles, but is gradually swapping out incentives for hard targets automakers must meet."

Ford Motor,2017-4,"Industry executives will use the Shanghai Motor Show, which opens to the public on Friday, to show off numerous battery electric and plug-in hybrid models. But behind the scenes, many are worried that batteries capable of delivering the same driving range as gasoline cars are still too expensive."
Ford Motor,2017-4,"While green energy car sales have risen dramatically on the back of government policies, making China the world's leading market in this segment, electric cars have otherwise generated little consumer interest. They make up less than 2 percent of China's overall auto market of 28 million vehicles sold last year."

Ford Motor,2017-4,Policymakers say reducing subsidies gradually to 2020 will wean automakers off government support and create a self-sustained market for electric vehicles.

Ford Motor,2017-4,"RUSTON, Louisiana, April 17 (Reuters) - Mini motorcycle and go-kart maker Monster Moto made a big bet on U.S. manufacturing by moving assembly to this Louisiana town in 2016 from China."
Ford Motor,2017-4,"But it will be a long ride before it can stamp its products ""Made in USA."""
Ford Motor,2017-4,"The loss of nearly one out four U.S. factories in the last two decades means parts for its bike frames and engines must be purchased in China, where the manufacturing supply chain moved years ago."
Ford Motor,2017-4,"""There's just no way to source parts in America right now,"" said Monster Moto Chief Executive Alex Keechle during a tour of the company's assembly plant. ""But by planting the flag here, we believe suppliers will follow."""
Ford Motor,2017-4,"Monster Moto's experience is an example of the obstacles American companies face as they, along with President Donald Trump, try to rebuild American manufacturing. U.S. automakers and their suppliers, for example, have already invested billions in plants abroad and would face an expensive and time-consuming transition to buy thousands of American-made parts if President Trump's proposed ""border tax"" on imported goods were to become law."
Ford Motor,2017-4,"For now, finding U.S.-based suppliers ""remains one of the top challenges across our supplier base,"" said Cindi Marsiglio, Wal-Mart Stores Inc's vice president for U.S. manufacturing and sourcing. Wal-Mart partnered with Monster Moto and several other U.S. companies in a drive to increase spending on American-made goods by $250 billion by 2023 in response to consumer demand for American-made goods."
Ford Motor,2017-4,"Their experience has shown Americans' patriotic shopping habits have limits, namely when it comes to price."
Ford Motor,2017-4,"Take Monster Moto's bikes, which sell for between $249 to $749. Keechle, the CEO, says he can't raise those prices for fear his price sensitive prospective customers will turn to less expensive rivals made in China."
Ford Motor,2017-4,"""Consumers won't give you a free pass just because you put 'Made in USA' on the box,"" Keechle says. ""You have to remain price competitive."""
Ford Motor,2017-4,"Keeping a sharp eye on labor costs in their factory is one thing these U.S. manufactures can control. They see replacing primarily lower-skilled workers on the assembly line with robots on American factory floors as the only way to produce here in a financially viable, cost-competitive way. It's a trend that runs against the narrative candidate Donald Trump used to win the U.S. Presidency."
Ford Motor,2017-4,"Since taking office, Trump has continued promises to resurrect U.S. manufacturing's bygone glory days and bring back millions of jobs. On March 31, Trump directed his administration to clamp down on countries that abuse trade rules in a bid to end to the ""theft of American prosperity."" [nW1N1GM01Z]"
Ford Motor,2017-4,But it's more complicated on the ground for companies like Monster Moto.
Ford Motor,2017-4,"""It's almost as if people think you can just unplug manufacturing in one part of the world and plug it in to the U.S. and everything's going to be fine,"" said David Abney, Chief Executive Officer of package delivery company United Parcel Service Inc , which helped Monster Moto reconfigure its supply chain to bring its Chinese-made parts to Ruston."
Ford Motor,2017-4,A White House official said that the Trump administration's efforts to encourage manufacturers to reshore production will be focused on cutting regulations and programs to provide new skills to manufacturing workers.
Ford Motor,2017-4,"""We recognize that the manufacturing jobs that come back to America might not all look like the ones that left,"" a White House official said, ""and we are taking steps to ensure that the American workforce is ready for that."""
Ford Motor,2017-4,"In Monster Moto's cavernous warehouse in Ruston, boxes of imported parts that are delivered at one end then become bikes on a short but industrious assembly line of a few dozen workers."
Ford Motor,2017-4,"A solitary, long-bearded worker by the name of Billy Mahaffey fires up the bikes to test their engine and brakes before a small group of workers puts them in boxes declaring: ""Assembled in the USA."""
Ford Motor,2017-4,"Helped by that label, Monster Moto has experienced a recent boom in demand from major customers that include Wal-Mart. The company expects to double production to 80,000 units and increase its assembly workers - who make $13 to $15 an hour - to 100 from around 40 in 2017."
Ford Motor,2017-4,"The most likely components Monster Moto could produce in America first are black, welded-metal frames for bikes and go-karts, but they would have to automate production because human welders would be too expensive."
Ford Motor,2017-4,"""We can't just blow up our cost structure,"" said Monster Moto President Rick Sukkar. ""The only way to make it work in America is with robotics."""
Ford Motor,2017-4,"The same principle applies for much larger manufacturers, such as automotive supplier Delphi Automotive PLC's . Chief Financial Officer Joe Massaro told analysts in February that 90 percent of the company's hourly workforce is in ""best-cost countries."""
Ford Motor,2017-4,"""We're going to see more automation in this country because it makes good sense economically for every company,"" said Hal Sirkin, a managing director at the Boston Consulting Group. ""You can spend a lot of time bemoaning it, but that's not going to change."""
Ford Motor,2017-4,"Manufacturers say automated production requires fewer, but more skilled workers such as robot programmers and operators. The National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) estimates because of the ""skills gap"" there are 350,000 unfilled manufacturing jobs today in a sector that employs over 12 million people."
Ford Motor,2017-4,"In Ruston, Mayor Ronny Walker bet on Monster Moto by guaranteeing the company's lease because he wants to diversify the city's economy, and envisions suppliers setting up alongside Monster Moto's assembly plant."
Ford Motor,2017-4,"""Could it take a long time to bring manufacturing back here? Sure,"" he says. ""But you have to start somewhere."""

Ford Motor,2017-4,"BEIJING, April 13 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co said on Thursday that its China vehicle sales fell by 21 percent in the first quarter compared with a year ago, after a tax cut on small-engined vehicles was rolled back."

Ford Motor,2017-4,Many in the industry had feared that consumers rushing to buy small-engine cars before a tax increase at the end of 2016 would lead to weaker sales in the first few months of 2017.
Ford Motor,2017-4,"Roughly 70-75 percent of Ford cars sold in China qualified for the tax cut, which applies to vehicles with engine capacity of 1.6 litres or below, Ford Chief Executive Mark Fields told reporters in Shanghai on Saturday ahead of the release of Ford's March figures."

Ford Motor,2017-4,Greenlight manager David Einhorn told Reuters on Wednesday the automaker has refused to allow him to present his proposal to credit agencies for a formal review of how the plan would affect the company's credit risk.
Ford Motor,2017-4,"""We think the credit rating process has been unfairly manipulated,"" Einhorn said. ""We call on GM to allow us to work directly with the credit rating agencies."""
Ford Motor,2017-4,"GM fired back that any suggestion the automaker had failed to share Greenlight's proposal in full with the ratings agencies was ""baseless and irresponsible."""
Ford Motor,2017-4,"Einhorn went public with a proposal in late March that the U.S. automaker create one class of stock that pays a dividend and one that does not, but would be tied to GM's potential growth. [nL3N1H54NI]"
Ford Motor,2017-4,"The move would lower the company's cost of capital, improve financial flexibility and boost market capitalization by as much as $38 billion, Einhorn said."
Ford Motor,2017-4,"No other GM shareholder has yet backed Einhorn's proposal, with Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc remaining conspicuously silent."
Ford Motor,2017-4,"GM has rebuffed Einhorn's proposal, saying it would not help the automaker ""sell more cars, drive higher profitability, or generate greater cash flow."" Both Moody's and Standard & Poor's have declared such a structure could hurt its credit rating."
Ford Motor,2017-4,"When asked whether Einhorn's claims on Wednesday changed anything, an S&P Global Ratings spokesman referred Reuters to the agency's previous opinion from late March."
Ford Motor,2017-4,"The views of the rating agencies are a key element in the proxy fight that will play out over the next several weeks, unless GM and Einhorn can reach a settlement."
Ford Motor,2017-4,"In the interview, Einhorn said his plan would also allow GM to preserve more of its cash reserves, at a time when some analysts are concerned the U.S. auto industry is heading into a cyclical slowdown."
Ford Motor,2017-4,"""Our proposal is an elegant way to unlock that kind of value without drawing on the cash resources of the company,"" Einhorn said."
Ford Motor,2017-4,"Greenlight Capital has owned GM shares on and off for five years and now has a 4.9 percent stake, including options."
Ford Motor,2017-4,GM stock has performed poorly versus its peers and compared with the broader market. GM shares traded on Wednesday afternoon at $34 - just a dollar above the IPO price when the company went public in 2010 after a government-led bankruptcy.
Ford Motor,2017-4,"The disagreement became a full-fledged proxy fight on Wednesday as Greenlight said GM's advisers had no interest ""in performing an objective analysis"" of Einhorn's proposal."
Ford Motor,2017-4,"In a regulatory filing, Greenlight said GM had then ""substantially altered"" the term sheet for its proposal before handing it to the ratings agencies and that this different version included ""various misrepresentations"" of the plan."
Ford Motor,2017-4,"GM said in a statement: ""The rating agencies' public statements issued regarding the Greenlight proposal clearly indicate that they understood the idea in all its facets, and would represent a credit negative if implemented. Any suggestion to the contrary is baseless and irresponsible."""
Ford Motor,2017-4,"Greenlight on Wednesday nominated former AT&T Broadband Chief Executive Officer Leo Hindery, longtime Greenlight research director Vinit Sethi and Consol Energy Inc Chairman William Thorndike to the automaker's board of directors."
Ford Motor,2017-4,Sethi was involved in talks with GM on Greenlight's proposal going back to last September.
Ford Motor,2017-4,Einhorn's fund has returned an annualized 16 percent since the firm's launch in 1996 but its gains have been more muted recently with an increase of only 1.5 percent in the first three months of 2017.
Ford Motor,2017-4,"Einhorn's fight with GM marks the first time since taking on Apple Inc in 2013 that the closely watched fund manager has pressed management publicly to make changes, taking a page from the playbooks of so-called activist hedge funds like Jana Partners and Pershing Square Capital Management."

Ford Motor,2017-4,"Subaru Corp <7270.T> unveiled a concept seven-passenger Ascent SUV Concept, meanwhile, saying it planned to start selling the large SUV in 2018, and General Motors Co showed off a new larger seven-passenger Buick Enclave."

Ford Motor,2017-4,"SUVs accounted for nearly 40 percent of total U.S. vehicle sales in 2016, up from 32.6 percent in 2014, as a growing number of Americans ditched cars for more fuel-thirsty larger vehicles."

Ford Motor,2017-4,"Mitch Bainwol, chief executive of the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a trade group representing General Motors Co , Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T>, Volkswagen AG and others, said at a forum ahead of the New York auto show that automakers were not seeking a rollback of existing standards."

Ford Motor,2017-4,"In March, President Donald Trump ordered a review of U.S. vehicle fuel-efficiency standards from 2022-2025 put in place by the Obama administration, saying they were too tough on the auto industry."
Ford Motor,2017-4,"But California opposed weakening the rules, threatened to pursue tougher standards unilaterally and could mount a legal challenge. New York has also threatened a fight."
Ford Motor,2017-4,"The White House plans to hold negotiations with car companies and California. A deal would remove uncertainty for automakers, who need years of lead time to engineer future models and want uniform rules across all 50 states."
Ford Motor,2017-4,"The Obama administration's rules, negotiated with automakers in 2011, were aimed at doubling average fleet-wide fuel efficiency to 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025. Under the 2011 deal, the 2022-2025 model year rules must be finalized by April 2018."
Ford Motor,2017-4,"""The talk the of rollback is fallacious. What we are talking here is the nature of the slope,"" Bainwol said. ""We will get to the Obama numbers (54.5 mpg). We will get beyond the Obama numbers. The question is when and how."""
Ford Motor,2017-4,"Without a deal, automakers could be forced to meet one set of standards in California and about a dozen states that have adopted its rules and other rules in the rest of the country."
Ford Motor,2017-4,"In 2011, Obama said the rules would save motorists $1.7 trillion in fuel costs over the life of the vehicles, but cost the auto industry about $200 billion over 13 years."

Ford Motor,2017-4,"The hackers left a malicious link on web pages where members of the National Foreign Trade Council (NFTC) register for upcoming meetings, according to researchers at Fidelis Cybersecurity and a person familiar with the trade group."

Ford Motor,2017-4,"The malicious link deployed a spying tool called Scanbox, which would have recorded the type and versions of software running on the computers of those exposed to it, said Fidelis researcher John Bambenek. Such reconnaissance is typically followed by new attacks using known flaws in the detected software, especially older versions."
Ford Motor,2017-4,"Scanbox has only been used by groups associated with the Chinese government, Fidelis said, and was recently seen on a political site aimed at Uyghurs, an ethnic minority under close government scrutiny in China."
Ford Motor,2017-4,"The breach was detected about five weeks ago by a NFTC director who is a customer of Fidelis, the security company said.

Ford Motor,2017-4,The FBI and the NFTC declined to comment. A spokesman for the Chinese foreign ministry did not respond to a request for comment.
Ford Motor,2017-4,"Bambenek said he believed the attack was classic espionage related to international trade talks, rather than a violation of a 2015 agreement between former U.S. President Barack Obama and Xi to end spying for commercial motives."
Ford Motor,2017-4,"The summit starting on Thursday is the first meeting between Xi and Trump, who blamed China on the campaign trail for the loss of many U.S. jobs and vowed to confront the country's leaders on the matters of trade and currency manipulation."

Ford Motor,2017-4,"In a conference call with media and analysts, officials of the National Automobile Dealers Association said they expected sales of cars and light trucks in the United States to dip to 17.1 million vehicles this year, high by historical standards but below 2016's record 17.55 million vehicles."

Ford Motor,2017-4,"Trump warned in a tweet last week the meetings at his Mar-a-Lago resort on Thursday and Friday will be ""very difficult"" and ""American companies must be prepared to look at other alternatives."""
Ford Motor,2017-4,Trump has said he wants U.S. companies to stop investing in China and instead create jobs at home. He has also accused China of manipulating its currency to boost exports.
Ford Motor,2017-4,"Critics within U.S. industry have accused China of unfair government subsidies to its companies, and of flooding the U.S. market with cheap products from steel to solar panels, while restricting foreign investment over vast swathes of the world's second-biggest economy."

Ford Motor,2017-4,Some in the U.S. business community worry about tit-for-tat retaliation in trade disputes with China.
Ford Motor,2017-4,"Jacob Parker, vice president of China operations at the U.S.-China Business Council, said the two presidents need to take ""positive actions that would lead to a more durable relationship, not retaliatory actions that would lead to a trade war""."
Ford Motor,2017-4,"The list of commercial issues between the two countries was so long, it would be impossible to make a major dent in them with one meeting, he said."
Ford Motor,2017-4,"China is the largest export market for U.S. soybean producers, accounting for 62 percent of U.S. soy exports in 2016 with a value of over $14 billion, leading some experts to suggest the sector could be particularly vulnerable to retaliation."

Ford Motor,2017-4,"BEIJING/WASHINGTON, April 4 (Reuters) - Although worried about the prospect of a trade war, American businesses operating in China nonetheless want President Donald Trump to wring some concessions on market access from China's leader Xi Jingping when the two meet this week."
Ford Motor,2017-4,"Trump warned in a tweet last week the meetings at his Mar-a-Lago resort on Thursday and Friday will be ""very difficult"" and ""American companies must be prepared to look at other alternatives."""
Ford Motor,2017-4,Trump has said he wants U.S. companies to stop investing in China and instead create jobs at home. He has also accused China of manipulating its currency to boost exports.
Ford Motor,2017-4,"Critics within U.S. industry have accused China of unfair government subsidies to its companies, and of flooding the U.S. market with cheap products from steel to solar panels, while restricting foreign investment over vast swathes of the world's second-biggest economy."
Ford Motor,2017-4,"But they also worry Trump's policies on China are not entirely clear, with his trade team still not in place, and may be subject to a 'grand bargain' involving other issues such as North Korea."
Ford Motor,2017-4,"Trump is set to enter the meeting without several key advisors, including his pick for trade negotiator, Robert Lighthizer who has yet to be confirmed by Congress. His nominee as ambassador to China, Iowa Governor Terry Branstad, has also yet to be confirmed, while several posts in the U.S. State Department that formulate Asia policy remain unfilled."
Ford Motor,2017-4,"""With this in mind, it is hard to imagine that there will be much in the way of concrete accomplishments at this summit, or even that there has been any significant interagency discussion on strategy leading up to it,"" said Randal Phillips, Mintz Group's Beijing-based managing partner for Asia and the former chief CIA representative in China."
Ford Motor,2017-4,"Some of the largest U.S. companies have contributed to the billions of dollars of foreign direct investment that have poured into China over the past two decades, creating hundreds of thousands of jobs. They include tech companies like Apple, which makes much of its iPhone in China, automakers such as General Motors and Ford, heavy machinery firms like Caterpillar, retailers like Starbucks and makers of shaving foam and detergent, like Procter & Gamble."
Ford Motor,2017-4,"U.S. steel producers want Trump to press Xi on Chinese steel prices, according to a source who has been in discussions with the administration in advance of the summit."
Ford Motor,2017-4,"U.S. automakers complain about a disparity in tariffs: The United States has a 2.5 percent tariff on auto imports, China's is 25 percent."
Ford Motor,2017-4,"But the stakes are perhaps highest for American technology firms, who worry that China's new cyber-security law, which takes effect in June, sets potentially discriminatory standards for multinationals."
Ford Motor,2017-4,"The Information Technology & Innovation Foundation (ITIF), a think-tank whose board includes representatives from Apple, IBM Google and other tech heavyweights, has urged the Trump administration to pressure China to ""stop rigging markets"". It warned that possible retaliation from Beijing was not a reason for inaction.[nL3N1GT2ZS]"
Ford Motor,2017-4,"Trump has staked out various positions on China as president in his tweets, phone calls and statements."
Ford Motor,2017-4,"Trump signed two executive orders on trade on Friday, one to improve import tariff collection and another to study the causes of the U.S. trade deficit. Trump said at the White House signing ceremony he and Xi were ""going to get down to some serious business"" and vowed that ""the theft of American prosperity"" by foreign countries would end."
Ford Motor,2017-4,Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Zheng Zeguang said on Friday the U.S.-China trade imbalance was mostly the result of differences in the two countries' economic structures and noted China had a trade deficit in services.
Ford Motor,2017-4,"China tops the list of countries who have trade surpluses with the United States, with a $347 billion surplus last year."
Ford Motor,2017-4,Some in the U.S. business community worry about tit-for-tat retaliation in trade disputes with China.
Ford Motor,2017-4,"Jacob Parker, vice president of China operations at the U.S.-China Business Council, said the two presidents need to take ""positive actions that would lead to a more durable relationship, not retaliatory actions that would lead to a trade war""."
Ford Motor,2017-4,"The list of commercial issues between the two countries was so long, it would be impossible to make a major dent in them with one meeting, he said."
Ford Motor,2017-4,"China is the largest export market for U.S. soybean producers, accounting for 62 percent of U.S. soy exports in 2016 with a value of over $14 billion, leading some experts to suggest the sector could be particularly vulnerable to retaliation."
Ford Motor,2017-4,"Steve Censky, chief executive of the American Soybean Association, told Reuters he hopes Trump will take a ""prudent"" approach to the trade relationship and address any issues in a ""workman-like manner"", recognising that both countries have a lot to lose if the relationship suffers."
Ford Motor,2017-4,"William Zarit, chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China met senior Trump administration officials in February, and said ""it was clear they were very familiar with the issues facing American companies in China, perhaps more so than previous administrations""."
Ford Motor,2017-4,"But several corporate lobbyists, representing a range of companies expressed concern Trump's lack of attention to detail could prove counterproductive when it comes to the intricacies of the massive trade and investment relationship."
