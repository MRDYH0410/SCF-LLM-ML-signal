Ford Motor,2017-6,"SYDNEY, June 29 (Reuters) - BHP Billiton's Chairman Jac Nasser said on Thursday BHP's $20 billion investment in U.S. shale oil and gas six years ago was, in hindsight, a mistake."
Ford Motor,2017-6,BHP entered the shale business at the height of the fracking boom in 2011 and invested billions more developing the operations. The fall in oil prices since then has led to pre-tax writedowns of about $13 billion on the business.
Ford Motor,2017-6,"Activist shareholder and hedge fund Elliott Management, holding 4.1 percent of BHP's London-listed shares, has been trying to gain support from other shareholders to persuade BHP to sell the shale oil and gas business."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"""If you had to turn the clock back, and if we knew what we knew today, we wouldn't do it, of course we wouldn't do it, but go back and put yourself in our position at that time,"" Nasser told a business seminar, referring to the shale purchase."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"""We bought exactly what we thought we were buying, but the timing was way off."""
Ford Motor,2017-6,New York-based Elliott has directed a barrage of criticism at the global miner since releasing a list of changes in April it wants the company to implement. [nL3N1HI3HI]
Ford Motor,2017-6,"Its list includes an exit from shale, removal of BHP's dual London and Australian stock listings and greater emphasis on shareholder returns."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"Nasser would not comment on Elliott's proposal. But he defended BHP's performance, saying the company's shareholder returns were up 486 percent since BHP merged with Billiton Plc in 2001."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"BHP Chief Executive Andrew Mackenzie told a conference in May the company was considering divesting some shale acreage, although it believed the assets were ""well-placed for the future."""
Ford Motor,2017-6,"Australian wealth management group Escala and fund Tribeca Investment Partners have also campaigned for a revamp at BHP, calling for board changes and reviews of the energy operations."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"Nasser, a former head of Ford Motor Co. is scheduled to retire as chairman on Sept. 1. The appointment of Nasser's successor, Ken MacKenzie, a former packaging industry executive, has been welcomed by Elliott as a ""constructive step in bringing much needed change to the direction of BHP."""

Ford Motor,2017-6,"SAN FRANCISCO, June 29 (Reuters) - Peer at the instrument panel on your new car and you may find sleek digital gauges and multicolored screens. But a glimpse behind the dashboard could reveal what U.S. auto supplier Visteon Corp found: a mess."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"As automotive cockpits become crammed with ever more digital features such as navigation and entertainment systems, the electronics holding it all together have become a rat's nest of components made by different parts makers."
Ford Motor,2017-6,Now the race is on to clean up the clutter.
Ford Motor,2017-6,"Visteon is among a slew of suppliers aiming to make dashboard innards simpler, cheaper and lighter as the industry accelerates toward a so-called virtual cockpit - an all-digital dashboard that will help usher in the era of self-driving cars."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"What's at stake is a piece of the $37-billion cockpit electronics market, estimated by research firm IHS Market to nearly double to $62 billion by 2022. Accounting firm PwC estimates that electronics could account for up to 20 percent of a car's value in the next two years, up from 13 percent in 2015."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"Meanwhile, the number of suppliers for those components is likely to dwindle as automakers look to work with fewer companies capable of doing more, according to Mark Boyadjis, principal automotive analyst at IHS Markit."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"""The complexity of engineering ten different systems from ten different suppliers is no longer something an automaker wants to do,"" Boyadjis said."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"He estimates manufacturers eventually will work with two to three cockpit suppliers for each model, down from six to 10 today."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"One of Visteon's solutions is a computer module dubbed ""SmartCore."" This cockpit domain controller operates a vehicle's instrument cluster, infotainment system and other features, all on the same tiny piece of silicon."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"So far this year, the Detroit-based company has landed two big contracts for undisclosed sums. One, announced in April, is with China's second-largest automaker, Dongfeng Motor Corp. The other is with Mercedes-Benz , Reuters has learned. Mercedes did not respond to requests for comment. Another unnamed European automaker plans to use the system in 2018, according to Visteon."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"Visteon is going all in on cockpit electronics, having shed its remaining automotive climate and interiors businesses in 2016. The bet so far is paying off. The company secured $1.5 billion in new business in the first quarter, helped by growth in China. Visteon's stock price is up more than 50 percent over the past year."
Ford Motor,2017-6,It's a major turnaround since Visteon was spun off from Ford Motor Co a decade ago. Visteon filed for bankruptcy protection in 2009 before emerging a year later.
Ford Motor,2017-6,"""You have to be changing and adapting fast. If not, you're not going to keep up in this market,"" said Tim Yerdon, Visteon's head of global marketing. ""It's about reinventing yourself to stay ahead."""
Ford Motor,2017-6,"Visteon's makeover hints at the coming battle between suppliers fighting for real estate in the digital cockpit. The trend is already triggering acquisitions, as companies look to boost their offerings to automakers."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"Visteon in 2014 bought Johnson Controls' electronics business, which was also developing a domain controller. In March, Samsung <005930.KS> completed its $8-billion purchase of infotainment company Harman. France's Faurecia , a top seating and interiors supplier, last year purchased a 20 percent stake in Paris-based infotainment firm Parrot Automotive SAS in a deal that could make Faurecia the biggest shareholder by 2019."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"Deal-making in the wider automotive sector has been at a fever pitch over the past two years fueled by the race to develop autonomous vehicle technology. [nL1N1HK206] Activity in the sector was worth $41 billion in 2016, according to PwC."
Ford Motor,2017-6,Analysts say German automakers are taking the lead in consolidating functions within the dashboard. Audi was the first to debut a virtual cockpit last year that combined its instrument cluster and infotainment system.
Ford Motor,2017-6,"Streamlined dashboards can lead to cost reductions for manufacturers, who can save as much as $175 per car with an integrated cockpit, according to Munich-based management consulting firm Roland Berger."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"They can also help with fuel efficiency. That's because vehicles are lighter when there are fewer behind-the-scenes computers, known as electronic control units (ECUs). Vehicles today contain 80 to 120 ECUs, numbers expected to fall sharply in coming years."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"But perhaps the biggest motivation for fancy cockpits is sales. Drivers accustomed to the seamless technology of their smartphones are finding today's dashboard offerings clunky and non-intuitive. A J.D. Power study released this month found the most complaints from new vehicle owners stemmed from audio, communications, entertainment and maps systems."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"Better cockpits could prove crucial to attracting younger consumers, who are not showing the same enthusiasm for cars, or even driving, that their parents did. Research company Mintel found that 41 percent of millennial car buyers are interested in having the latest technology in their vehicles."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"Disjointed dashboards ""are one of the most noticeable gaps in user experience - what you see right in front of you,"" said Andrew Hart of UK-based consultancy SBD Automotive."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"On many car models, he said, audible warning systems to alert the driver to a potential collision are not in sync with the radio, meaning your favorite song could drown out the warning beep."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"""That's a crazy example of something when you don't consolidate ECUs,"" Hart said."
Ford Motor,2017-6,Industry watchers say this and other safe-driving features are among the systems ripe for integration. Additional targets include rear-seat entertainment systems and so-called heads-up displays that project data such as the car's speed onto the windshield for easy viewing.
Ford Motor,2017-6,"Back in Detroit, Visteon says it is in talks with carmakers in China and Europe for its domain controller, a technology it hopes can give it an edge over rivals such as Delphi , Robert Bosch [ROBG.UL], Continental , and Denso <6902.T>."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"While it isn't clear who will prevail, electronics suppliers are seeing their products take on new importance as vehicles become more connected."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"Five years ago, the dashboard was ""a plastic molded cockpit that we stuffed electronics into,"" said Yerdon, Visteon's marketing chief. ""Now it's more about an electronic architecture that's experience-driven, and we mold plastic around it."""
Ford Motor,2017-6,{{20170628T224452.124+0000}}Auto industry groups urge caution in changing NAFTA origin rulesBy David Lawder
Ford Motor,2017-6,"WASHINGTON, June 28 (Reuters) - Auto industry trade groups said on Wednesday that tightening the rules of origin in the North American Free Trade Agreement could be disruptive and hurt the competitiveness of U.S., Mexican and Canadian auto plants."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"Their testimony at a public hearing ahead of NAFTA renegotiations, expected to start Aug. 17, contrasted sharply with frequent comments from U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross that the trade pact's local content rules are an area that needs strengthening to avoid being used as a ""back door"" for Chinese auto parts."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"Matt Blunt, president of the American Automotive Policy Council, said the current NAFTA 62.5 percent local content requirement was working just fine and ""strikes the right balance"" for encouraging local manufacturing investment and keeping the industry's costs competitive."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"Blunt, whose group represents Detroit automakers General Motors, Ford and Fiat Chrysler urged a ""very cautions and careful"" approach for any origin rule changes and discussed the affects of stricter enforcement."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"""It could make us less competitive as compared to our international peers and affect our ability to export,"" Blunt said."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"""It could deny us access to supply chains which would drive up costs and could affect sales and ultimately employment within the industry."""
Ford Motor,2017-6,Ross has said that NAFTA's rules of origin need tightening to avoid producers from outside the region to benefit from tariff-free access to the U.S. market. He also has noted that vehicles now have many new electronic components that were not contemplated when the pact was negotiated in the early 1990s.
Ford Motor,2017-6,"But Blunt disputed that the origin rules were allowing China to benefit from NAFTA in a major way, arguing that Chinese components make up less than six percent of the value of North American-built vehicles."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"His comments were seconded by representatives of other groups, including the Motor Equipment Manufacturers Association (MEMA), representing parts makers, the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, which includes Detroit and foreign automakers building vehicles in the United States, and the Association Global Automakers, a group that represents international automakers that sell into the U.S. market."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"Leigh Merino, senior director of regulatory affairs for MEMA, said auto components and subsystems in particular depend on complex ""ecosystem"" of diverse parts suppliers and small changes to this ""can be extremely disruptive."""
Ford Motor,2017-6,"Nonetheless, the trade groups said that they were not opposed to examining ways to improve the rules."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"The NAFTA hearings, which allow industry groups and companies to express views on the U.S. negotiating objectives for the talks are expected to conclude on Thursday."

Ford Motor,2017-6,"WASHINGTON, June 27 (Reuters) - Republicans and Democrats in Congress sparred on Tuesday over U.S. states setting rules for testing and deployment of self-driving cars and a proposal to allow automakers and technology companies to bypass existing regulations in introducing autonomous cars."
Ford Motor,2017-6,Democrats on a U.S. House Energy and Commerce subcommittee said that the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) must play a more aggressive role in mandating self-driving car safety.
Ford Motor,2017-6,"A Republican draft package of 14 bills would allow NHTSA to exempt up to 100,000 vehicles per year from federal motor vehicle safety rules, which currently prevent the sale of self-driving vehicles without human controls. It would also bar states from setting self-driving rules and prevent NHTSA from preapproving self-driving car technologies. [nL1N1JC229]"
Ford Motor,2017-6,"""We simply cannot have cars that stop at state lines,"" Representative Robert Latta said at a hearing of the subcommittee. ""This isn't the government saying you have to get in a self-driving car. This is government make sure that industry can innovate."""
Ford Motor,2017-6,Latta said he hoped to win committee approval of a bipartisan legislative package by the end of July.
Ford Motor,2017-6,"General Motors Co , Alphabet Inc , Tesla Inc and others have been lobbying Congress to pre-empt rules under consideration in California and other states that could limit self-driving vehicle deployment."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"Representative Frank Pallone, a Democrat, said that under the Republican proposal, states would be barred from regulating self-driving car safety ""without a guarantee that NHTSA will step in"" to set binding rules. ""We need to be sure that we get this right and that safety is the first priority,"" Pallone said."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"Democrats noted that the administration of President Donald Trump, a Republican, has not nominated a candidate to head NHTSA, which has a number of vacant senior positions. NHTSA did not sent an official to testify."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"Two automaker trade associations said in testimony it is essential they do not face a ""patchwork"" of self-driving state rules. They said NHTSA will have to approve exemptions."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"Republicans, citing competition from other countries and the rising number of traffic deaths, say it is urgent Congress approve sweeping legislation to ensure automakers and technology companies test the vehicles inside the United States."
Ford Motor,2017-6,The administration of former Democratic President Barack Obama last year unveiled voluntary guidelines on self-driving cars. Trump's Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao has vowed to quickly update those. [nL1N1J21LZ]

Ford Motor,2017-6,"Matt Blunt, president of the American Automotive Policy Council, said the current NAFTA 62.5 percent local content requirement was working just fine and ""strikes the right balance"" for encouraging local manufacturing investment and keeping the industry's costs competitive."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"Blunt, whose group represents Detroit automakers General Motors, Ford and Fiat Chrysler urged a ""very cautions and careful"" approach for any origin rule changes and discussed the affects of stricter enforcement."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"""It could make us less competitive as compared to our international peers and affect our ability to export,"" Blunt said."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"""It could deny us access to supply chains which would drive up costs and could affect sales and ultimately employment within the industry."""
Ford Motor,2017-6,Ross has said that NAFTA's rules of origin need tightening to avoid producers from outside the region to benefit from tariff-free access to the U.S. market. He also has noted that vehicles now have many new electronic components that were not contemplated when the pact was negotiated in the early 1990s.
Ford Motor,2017-6,"But Blunt disputed that the origin rules were allowing China to benefit from NAFTA in a major way, arguing that Chinese components make up less than six percent of the value of North American-built vehicles."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"His comments were seconded by representatives of other groups, including the Motor Equipment Manufacturers Association (MEMA), representing parts makers, the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, which includes Detroit and foreign automakers building vehicles in the United States, and the Association Global Automakers, a group that represents international automakers that sell into the U.S. market."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"Leigh Merino, senior director of regulatory affairs for MEMA, said auto components and subsystems in particular depend on complex ""ecosystem"" of diverse parts suppliers and small changes to this ""can be extremely disruptive."""
Ford Motor,2017-6,"Nonetheless, the trade groups said that they were not opposed to examining ways to improve the rules."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"The NAFTA hearings, which allow industry groups and companies to express views on the U.S. negotiating objectives for the talks are expected to conclude on Thursday."

Ford Motor,2017-6,"WASHINGTON, June 27 (Reuters) - Republicans and Democrats in Congress sparred on Tuesday over U.S. states setting rules for testing and deployment of self-driving cars and a proposal to allow automakers and technology companies to bypass existing regulations in introducing autonomous cars."
Ford Motor,2017-6,Democrats on a U.S. House Energy and Commerce subcommittee said that the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) must play a more aggressive role in mandating self-driving car safety.
Ford Motor,2017-6,"A Republican draft package of 14 bills would allow NHTSA to exempt up to 100,000 vehicles per year from federal motor vehicle safety rules, which currently prevent the sale of self-driving vehicles without human controls. It would also bar states from setting self-driving rules and prevent NHTSA from preapproving self-driving car technologies. [nL1N1JC229]"
Ford Motor,2017-6,"""We simply cannot have cars that stop at state lines,"" Representative Robert Latta said at a hearing of the subcommittee. ""This isn't the government saying you have to get in a self-driving car. This is government make sure that industry can innovate."""
Ford Motor,2017-6,Latta said he hoped to win committee approval of a bipartisan legislative package by the end of July.
Ford Motor,2017-6,"General Motors Co , Alphabet Inc , Tesla Inc and others have been lobbying Congress to pre-empt rules under consideration in California and other states that could limit self-driving vehicle deployment."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"Representative Frank Pallone, a Democrat, said that under the Republican proposal, states would be barred from regulating self-driving car safety ""without a guarantee that NHTSA will step in"" to set binding rules. ""We need to be sure that we get this right and that safety is the first priority,"" Pallone said."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"Democrats noted that the administration of President Donald Trump, a Republican, has not nominated a candidate to head NHTSA, which has a number of vacant senior positions. NHTSA did not sent an official to testify."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"Two automaker trade associations said in testimony it is essential they do not face a ""patchwork"" of self-driving state rules. They said NHTSA will have to approve exemptions."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"Republicans, citing competition from other countries and the rising number of traffic deaths, say it is urgent Congress approve sweeping legislation to ensure automakers and technology companies test the vehicles inside the United States."
Ford Motor,2017-6,The administration of former Democratic President Barack Obama last year unveiled voluntary guidelines on self-driving cars. Trump's Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao has vowed to quickly update those. [nL1N1J21LZ]

Ford Motor,2017-6,"LORDSTOWN, Ohio, June 21 (Reuters) - Wall Street is fretting that the U.S. auto industry is heading for a downturn, but for thousands of workers at General Motors Co factories in the United States, the hard times are already here."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"Matt Streb, 36, was one of 1,200 workers laid off on Jan. 20 - inauguration day for Republican U.S. President Donald Trump - when GM canceled the third shift at its Lordstown small-car factory here. Sales of the Chevrolet Cruze sedan, the only vehicle the plant makes, have nosedived as U.S. consumers switch to SUVs and pickup trucks."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"Streb is looking for another job, but employers are wary because they assume he will quit whenever GM calls him back. ""I get it,"" said Streb, who has a degree in communications, ""but it's frustrating."""
Ford Motor,2017-6,Layoffs at Lordstown and other auto plants point to a broader challenge for the economy in Midwestern manufacturing states and for the Trump administration.
Ford Motor,2017-6,The U.S. auto industry's boom from 2010 through last year was a major driver for manufacturing job creation. The fading of that boom threatens prospects for U.S. industrial output and job creation that were central to President Trump's victory in Ohio and other manufacturing states.
Ford Motor,2017-6,"""This is about economics, not what Trump says,"" said Robert Morales, president of United Auto Workers (UAW) union Local 1714, which represents workers at GM's stamping plant at Lordstown. ""Even if Trump went out and bought 10,000 Cruzes a month, he wouldn't get the third shift back here."""
Ford Motor,2017-6,"Last week the Federal Reserve said U.S. factory output fell 0.4 percent in May, the second decline in three months, due partly to a 2-percent drop in motor vehicles and parts production."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"Mark Muro, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, has compiled data from government sources that show the auto industry punching higher than its weight in job creation in recent years - accounting for between 60 percent and 80 percent of all U.S. manufacturing jobs added in 2015 and 2016."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"In the first quarter of this year, the auto industry accounted for less than 2 percent of the 45,000 manufacturing jobs created."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"""There's no argument with the idea that auto has been pulling the manufacturing sled up the mountain for the last three or four years,"" Muro said. ""If you take auto out, you're left with a very tepid outlook indeed."""
Ford Motor,2017-6,"Long-term auto layoffs could threaten the economies of communities and states directly affected, although after decades of boom and bust, many communities in the auto manufacturing heartland have diversified."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"In Ohio's Mahoning Valley, which was battered by the collapse of the once-dominant steel industry, the boom in drilling for shale gas helps offset job cuts at auto plants."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"Lordstown Mayor Arno Hill says the town salted away money during the boom to pay down its debts and new businesses are coming in, including a $900-million power plant being built in town that will burn cheap natural gas produced in the region."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"GM makes up 40 percent of tax receipts versus 85 percent in the early 1990s, he said."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"""GM is still the brightest star in the Mahoning Valley, but luckily we have diversified our economy,"" Hill said. ""There is pain for the laid-off workers, but it won't hurt us as bad it used to."""
Ford Motor,2017-6,"Lordstown's workers have taken steps to blunt the impact of layoffs, with help from GM."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"Matt Streb's wife is due to start work soon after getting a degree, while he hopes to return to a former job as a mailman. In the meantime, GM gave advance notice of job cuts so he saved extra money and has drastically cut his spending."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"""The auto industry is cyclical and has always had its ups and downs,"" Streb said. ""This is just another Lordstown downturn."""
Ford Motor,2017-6,"The decline in U.S. auto sales is still minor compared to the dramatic collapse during the 2007-2009 financial crisis, when demand for new vehicles plunged to its lowest levels in decades."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"However, the days when auto assembly and parts plants throughout the Midwest were running flat-out because of high demand for nearly every type of vehicle are over. Recent sales trends show consumers becoming more selective, shunning older models and especially smaller cars."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"For much of the boom that ran from 2010 through to a record year in 2016 of 17.55 million new vehicles sold, the share of cars has declined versus ""light trucks"" - or pickup trucks, SUVs and crossovers."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"After peaking at 51.32 percent of all sales in 2012, passenger cars fell to 40.4 percent of sales in 2016. That decline equates to the output of seven or eight vehicle assembly plants."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"Through the first five months of this year, sedan sales fell 11 percent, even as the light truck category rose 4.7 percent."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"To avoid profit-sapping discounts, and reverse a decline in prices of used vehicles, automakers are ordering more and deeper production cuts. [nL1N1JH0GP]"
Ford Motor,2017-6,"GM has laid off more than 5,000 workers so far this year - including 1,000 at its Fairfax plant in Kansas that makes the Chevrolet Malibu midsize sedan. GM has also laid off 1,100 workers at a plant in Lansing because it has ended production of the GMC Acadia SUV there."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"More GM workers will be hit with temporary layoffs this summer. Lordstown will shut up shop for five weeks this summer, much longer than the usual two-week summer vacation closure."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"Many laid-off GM workers are finding temporary employment at other facilities or taking permanent transfers to plants like its Arlington, Texas, facility where production of large sport utility vehicles continues unabated. However, those temporary postings require workers to relocate hundreds of miles from home."

Ford Motor Co signaled its long-term pessimism about small-car demand in the United States by announcing plans on Tuesday to shift production of its Focus compact car model to China. The Michigan plant that builds the Focus currently is expected to switch to building trucks and SUVs in 2018. [nL1N1JH0GP]"

Ford Motor,2017-6,"DETROIT/WASHINGTON, June 20 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co said on Tuesday it will move some production of its Focus small car to China and import the vehicles to the United States in a long-term bet on low oil prices and stable U.S.-China trade relations despite recent tensions."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"The move suggests China could play a much larger role in future vehicle production for North America, perhaps eclipsing Mexico as a low-cost manufacturing source."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"Ford painted the production shift from Mexico to China, slated for mid-2019, as a purely financial move that will save the company $500 million in reduced tooling costs."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"But Ford also expects to ship about 80,000 vehicles to China this year, including the redesigned Lincoln Navigator luxury sport utility vehicle, which goes into production this fall at Ford's Kentucky truck plant."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"Ford's decision to import its first vehicles from China to the United States is also the first major manufacturing investment decision made by new Chief Executive Jim Hackett, who succeeded Mark Fields in May. Discussion about the small-car production shift from Mexico to China began ""a couple months ago"" under Fields, said Joe Hinrichs, president of global operations."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"The decision also signals a shift in strategy at Ford, which is responding to dwindling U.S. consumer demand for small cars in favor of more expensive and more profitable trucks and SUVs. Cars accounted for more than 50 percent of U.S. auto sales as recently as 2012, but have fallen to just 37 percent of sales this year."
Ford Motor,2017-6,Ford on Tuesday said it would invest $900 million at the Kentucky truck plant to build the redesigned Navigator and Ford Expedition. It has contingency plans to build more of the big SUVs at an Ohio plant if demand grows.
Ford Motor,2017-6,"In January, after U.S. President Donald Trump repeatedly criticized Ford for shipping small-car manufacturing to Mexico, Ford said it would kill plans to build a $1.8 billion Focus plant in San Luis Potosi and instead produce the new Focus at an existing plant in Hermosillo."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"""The Ford decision shows how flexible multinational companies are in terms of geography,"" U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in a statement."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said Trump ""wants to create a tax system (so) that companies want to come back and bring back jobs in manufacturing here in the United States."""
Ford Motor,2017-6,"Although it is cheaper to build and ship cars to the United States from Mexico than China, ""this was not a variable cost decision,"" Hinrichs said in a briefing on Tuesday. ""It allows us to free up a lot of capital"" because Ford now has to retool only one plant - the existing Focus factory in Chongqing - rather than two to supply North America."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"The current Focus will be phased out of production in Wayne, Michigan, in mid-2018, according to Hinrichs. The Wayne plant will begin building a new Ranger midsize truck in late 2018 and a Bronco midsize SUV in 2020."
Ford Motor,2017-6,Ford executives told Trump last year that moving production to Michigan of bigger vehicles that were more profitable would secure the Wayne plant's future - a decision later praised by Trump.
Ford Motor,2017-6,"No U.S. jobs will be affected by shifting Focus production to China, Ford said, adding that it employs more U.S. hourly workers and builds more vehicles in the United States than any other automaker."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"Hinrichs said ""the capital saving outweighs the risk"" of having to pay a potential border tax, or import tax, on the Chinese-built Focus."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"Ford U.S. Focus sales have fallen 22 percent this year, as low gas prices have helped spur more buyers into larger vehicles. Ford's full-size F-series pickup truck remains the best-selling U.S. vehicle by a wide margin."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"Unlike many consumer products, few Chinese-made vehicles are sold in the United States."

Ford Motor,2017-6,{{20170620T194839.093+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-Ford's new driver veers back onto old road(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.)
Ford Motor,2017-6,"NEW YORK, June 20 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Ford's new driver is veering back onto an old road. Detroit's second-largest carmaker on Tuesday unveiled Jim Hackett's first major decision since being named chief executive a month ago. He's shifting production of the next-generation Ford Focus compact car for the North America market to China from Mexico. There are some decent reasons for doing so, even if it risks irking President Donald Trump."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"So it makes little sense to invest too much money in production capacity. Fields had already decided in January to ditch plans to build a fresh Mexico plant for the new Focus, which goes on sale in 2019, opting to use an existing factory. That freed up some $500 million of capital. Moving manufacturing to an existing Focus plant in China will double that. And, says Hinrichs, ""the capital saving outweighs the risk"" of any border taxes the White House might impose."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"That's a bold statement from a corporate icon, one that breathes life back into globalization. Trump, after all, rode his ""America First"" rhetoric to the White House. He lambasted Ford on the campaign trail for its initial plan to move production to Mexico, prompting the company's partial retreat in January."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"That might appease Trump. But nothing about Tuesday's news gives shareholders any more insight into what Hackett's longer-term plans are for the company. That's in large part a function of the carmaking business: rolling out new products takes three years or more, while new autonomous and connected-car initiatives are likely to contain more promise than monetizable substance for a while yet. If nothing else, Hackett's trip down memory lane is a reminder there's no quick and easy fix to what ails Ford."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"- Ford Motor on June 20 said it is shifting production for the North American market of the next generation of its Focus compact car to China from Mexico. The decision will save Ford around $500 million. That's on top of the $500 million of savings former Chief Executive Mark Fields expected in January when he canceled plans to build a dedicated plant in Mexico to assemble the car, instead deciding to base production at an existing facility in the country."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"- During his presidential campaign last year, Donald Trump criticized the company's earlier decision to move Focus production to Mexico."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"- Under the new plan, exports of the vehicle from China to the United States will start in 2019. Production of the current-model Focus at a plant in Wayne, Michigan, will be phased out in mid-2018."

Ford Motor,2017-6,* CEO will not backtrack on decision to step down in 2019
Ford Motor,2017-6,"VENICE, Italy, June 16 (Reuters) - Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) does not expect its diesel problems in the United States to have an impact on its short-term business targets to 2018, Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne said on Friday."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"The U.S. Justice Department sued FCA last month, accusing the Italian-American automaker of illegally using software to bypass emission controls in 104,000 diesel vehicles sold since 2014, in a move that could potentially lead to heavy fines. [nL1N1IP14G]"
Ford Motor,2017-6,"The company has proposed a software update as part of certifying 2017 diesel models to allow them to go on sale and then use that fix to update the 104,000 vehicles on the road."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"Asked whether it could take months to get U.S. authority approval for the software fix, as suggested by a U.S. Justice Department lawyer this week, Marchionne said ""we are much closer than this"". [nL1N1JB1I5]"
Ford Motor,2017-6,"""When we made the proposal, we were ready to implement the fix immediately ... now it depends on them,"" Marchionne told journalists on the sidelines of a meeting in Venice of the U.S.-Italy council. ""We are talking to them ... we think we have a viable solution."""
Ford Motor,2017-6,"He said the company had not made any provisions for any potential fines, adding it was ""impossible to try estimate""."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"Part of the 2018 business plan, which is centred around the revamp of its Jeep, Maserati and Alfa Romeo brands, is erasing all debt and accumulating at least 4 billion euros ($4.5 billion) of cash by the end of next year."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"After failing to strike a much sought alliance for FCA, Marchionne has made executing the 2018 plan his core ambition before he steps down at the end of his tenure early in the following year."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"When asked whether he could rethink his decision to quit in early 2019 given political and market uncertainties surrounding his company, Marchionne, who turns 65 on Saturday, said ""No."""
Ford Motor,2017-6,"He said there was a ""wide and deep bench"" of possible internal candidates to succeed him, and did not exclude the possibility of his powers being divided among several managers, although added this would be up to the board to decide."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"""My job is not easy, it's a bit loaded,"" he said."
Ford Motor,2017-6,Marchionne said the second quarter was going in line with expectations and confirmed the targets for the full year.
Ford Motor,2017-6,"Widely credited with reviving one of Italy's top corporate names and rescuing U.S. Chrysler from bankruptcy, Marchionne has seen pressure mounting in recent months, with the U.S. market at its peak and legal challenges launched in the United States and in Europe over the company's emissions credentials."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"His ambition to tie up with General Motors to share the costs of making cleaner and more autonomous vehicles has been repeatedly rebuffed. While Marchionne briefly flirted with the idea of a tie-up with Volkswagen , he reiterated on Friday that there were no talks with anyone at present."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"He stressed, however, that a merger for FCA was ""ultimately inevitable"" to be able to compete, although it might not happen during his tenure."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"""The only way you're going to get that is by mass, there is no other solution,"" he said. ""Being small, cute is going to do nothing. Go home, go to a beauty parlour and do something else."""
Ford Motor,2017-6,"Asked whether FCA felt the same investor pressure that led to the sacking of his counterpart at U.S. rival Ford or that which prompted GM to leave Europe, Marchionne said the 2018 plan would be his judge. [nL4N1IR42T] [nL8N1J936F]"

Ford Motor,2017-6,"BERLIN, June 16 (Reuters) - Volkswagen is making headway with efforts to raise profitability at its troubled core brand and expects strong business next year thanks to a raft of new models, the division's top executive said."
Ford Motor,2017-6,The world's largest automaker's core division is being restructured with thousands of job cuts and retrenchments in parts and vehicle development as it struggles to fund a post-dieselgate shift to electric cars and new technologies.
Ford Motor,2017-6,"More than 10 new models launched this year including the top-of-the-line Arteon fastback and a redesigned Polo subcompact, one of VW's all-time bestsellers, would stoke demand and underpin the turnaround, VW brand chief executive Herbert Diess told Reuters on Friday."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"""We are making good progress,"" Diess said during an event to present the next-generation Polo. ""2018 will be a strong year for VW,"" he said, adding a new product always helped margins."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"VW brand's operating margin jumped to 4.6 percent in the first quarter from 0.3 percent a year earlier, still lagging French rivals PSA Peugeot Citroen and Renault but nearing its long-term 2025 target of 6 percent."
Ford Motor,2017-6,Diess said VW had a goal for 2017 to maintain the brand's first-quarter performance when operating profit surged to 869 million euros from 73 million a year ago.
Ford Motor,2017-6,"""The most important thing is the product offensive in coming months,"" Diess said."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"Wolfsburg-based VW is counting on the larger, technology-packed Polo model to revive its sluggish sales in the core European market where the brand's deliveries slid 0.2 percent in the January-to-May period to 726,000 cars."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"The new Polo, priced from 12,975 euros ($14,500) and due to hit showrooms in October, will be the main volume product VW launches this year, preceding the all-new T-Roc, a Golf-sized sport utility vehicle (SUV) which is due out later in 2017."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"A spokesman declined to specify the new Polo's on-road nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions and whether they met EU targets, saying VW at this point only had emissions estimates for the model which cannot be disclosed."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"The advent of the new Polo will intensify the struggle for dominance in Europe's crowded subcompact segment where the VW model is going up against a redesigned Ford Fiesta and an upgraded Renault Clio, all vying for the top spot."
Ford Motor,2017-6,Research firm IHS Markit expects the VW model to win easily.
Ford Motor,2017-6,"European deliveries of the Polo may jump a quarter to 368,158 cars by 2025 from 293,700 this year, compared with a 2.7 percent gain to 328,846 models for the Fiesta and a 32 percent plunge to 185,525 cars for the Clio, according to IHS."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"Registrations of the Peugeot 208 model may surge a fifth to 277,067 cars, IHS said."

Ford Motor,2017-6,"New passenger car registrations in the European Union and European Free Trade Association increased to 1.43 million vehicles last month, according to the Brussels-based Association of European Carmakers (ACEA)."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"""In volume terms, this result comes close to May 2007 levels, just before the economic crisis hit the auto industry,"" the industry group said in a statement."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"European car sales returned to annual growth in 2014 after a six-year slump during which registrations fell to their lowest in decades. Demand has been growing most months since, as an improvement in consumer confidence, retail incentives and new product launches lured customers back to the showrooms."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"The May increase comes after registrations dropped the previous month, given fewer trading days around Easter and thanks to a double-digit sales decline in Britain. [nL8N1IH6NJ]"
Ford Motor,2017-6,"May's growth was led by Japanese carmakers Suzuki <7269.T> and Toyota <7203.T>, up 21.4 percent and 19.6 percent respectively, and Germany's Daimler , up 14 percent."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"Sales from the Fiat Chrysler Automobiles stable rose 11.9 percent, as a 47.8 percent jump for sporty Alfa Romeo models helped offset a 7.3 percent drop for its Jeep SUV brand."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"France's Renault recorded a 10.4 percent rise in registrations, outpacing domestic rival PSA Group , whose sales increased 4.8 percent."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"Sales at Volkswagen , Europe's biggest carmaker, rose 8.4 percent, both for the group and its core namesake brand, as the German company continues to recover from its diesel emissions test-rigging scandal. Its market share remained roughly stable year-on-year at 24.3 percent."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"The only carmakers to report falling sales last month were Jaguar Land Rover, down 9.3 percent, Japanese carmakers Honda and Mazda, falling 14.5 percent and 2.3 percent respectively, and Opel Group, down 1.7 percent."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"All five major national markets, except for the United Kingdom, recorded sales increases last month, led by Germany, where registrations increased 12.9 percent, and followed by Spain, where sales were up 11.2 percent. UK sales dropped 8.5 percent."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"In the first five months of the year, European registrations increased 5.1 percent to 6.92 million vehicles, ACEA added."

Ford Motor,2017-6,* Takata has been working for months on deal with Key Safety
Ford Motor,2017-6,"NEW YORK/WASHINGTON, June 15 (Reuters) - Takata Corp <7312.T>, the Japanese company facing billions in liabilities stemming from its defective air bag inflators, is preparing to file for bankruptcy as early as next week as it works toward a deal for financial backing from U.S. auto parts maker Key Safety Systems Inc, sources said on Thursday."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"Takata, one of the world's biggest automotive suppliers, has been working for months to complete a deal with Key Safety."
Ford Motor,2017-6,A person briefed on the matter told Reuters Key was expected to acquire Takata assets as part of a restructuring in bankruptcy.
Ford Motor,2017-6,"The Nikkei business daily reported that a new company created under Key will purchase Takata operations for about 180 billion yen ($1.6 billion) and continue supplying air bags, seat belts and other products, leaving liabilities behind in a separate entity."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"Takata declined to comment. Michigan-based Key, owned by Chinese supplier Ningbo Joyson <600699.SS>, did not immediately respond to a request for comment."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"The Tokyo Stock Exchange said on Friday it had suspended trading in shares of Takata following media reports of preparations for a bankruptcy filing. At its previous close, it had a market value of $360 million."
Ford Motor,2017-6,Also at stake is $850 million owed by Takata to major global automakers under a settlement agreed to earlier this year stemming from the automotive industry's largest ever safety recall.
Ford Motor,2017-6,"Sources familiar with the matter, who asked for anonymity because they were not authorized to speak with the media, said a final deal with Key may not be reached before Takata files for bankruptcy. The company plans to begin proceedings in both the United States and Japan, the sources said."
Ford Motor,2017-6,Major global car manufacturers have expressed concern about the company filing for bankruptcy without a deal in place because of disruption it could cause to the production of replacement air bag inflators. More than 65 percent of 46.2 million recalled Takata air bag inflators in the United States have not been repaired.
Ford Motor,2017-6,A U.S. judge said earlier this year the costs of replacing all of the faulty Takata inflators could be $8 billion. [nL2N1GD1AS]
Ford Motor,2017-6,"Takata inflators can explode with excessive force, unleashing metal shrapnel inside cars and trucks."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"In January, Takata agreed to plead guilty to criminal wrongdoing and to pay $1 billion to resolve a U.S. Justice Department investigation into ruptures of its air bag inflators linked to at least 16 deaths worldwide. They also have been blamed for more than 180 injuries worldwide. [nL1N1F31KX]"
Ford Motor,2017-6,A federal grand jury in January indicted three former Takata executives for criminal wrongdoing in connection with the safety defect. [nL1N1F3140]
Ford Motor,2017-6,"Takata has already paid a $25 million fine and $125 million to a victims' compensation fund, including for future incidents."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"Takata has until early 2018 to pay the $850 million owed to automakers, or within five days of securing a financial backer. Then-U.S. Attorney Barbara McQuade said in January that if Takata filed for bankruptcy, the Justice Department would be a creditor in the restructuring."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"Key was chosen by Takata earlier this year as the favored buyer for the company. Since then, Key has been working with Takata on a restructuring plan. [nL4N1HZ047]"
Ford Motor,2017-6,"Inflator recalls began around 2008 and involve around 100 million inflators around the world used in vehicles made by 19 automakers, including Honda Motor Co <7267.T>, Ford Motor Co , Volkswagen AG and Tesla Inc . Recalls are to continue through at least the end of 2019."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"Last month, four automakers including Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T> agreed to a $553 million settlement to address class-action economic loss claims covering owners of nearly 16 million recalled vehicles with Takata inflators. [nL2N1IL1O0]"

Ford Motor,2017-6,"BERLIN, June 12 (Reuters) - General Motors' European division Opel is losing its top executive just as it prepares to be acquired by France's PSA Group , a move that could see the former Volkswagen manager rejoin the German behemoth."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"Karl-Thomas Neumann, 56, who has restored Opel's image and reputation since taking the helm in March 2013, on Monday resigned from his post, making way for finance chief Michael Lohscheller to become the next CEO of the 155-year-old carmaker."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"German-based Opel will be pressed by its new owners PSA to draw up a plan to return to profit once the acquisition, agreed in March valuing the GM division at 2.2 billion euros ($2.46 billion), closes later this year."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"""Under Neumann's leadership we have made enormous progress in turning around Opel,"" GM President Dan Ammann said. The U.S. parent's European business also includes British brand Vauxhall."

Ford Motor,2017-6,"""The prospects are good that he will move to Volkswagen,"" said Bankhaus Metzler analyst Juergen Pieper. ""He's one of Germany's most distinguished car managers and VW is in great need for excellent people."""
Ford Motor,2017-6,PSA wants Opel to return to lasting profit no later than by 2020 with operating margin goals of 2 percent that year and even around 6 percent by 2026 - a target never achieved under Neumann whose push for profitability was hampered by a weak Russian market and effects of Britain's Brexit decision.
Ford Motor,2017-6,"""We will vigorously proceed along the agreed path and gain more clout as part of the PSA group,"" Lohscheller said."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"Germany's Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung reported on Saturday that while Neumann views the sale to PSA as the right strategic step, he is concerned that the new owner is underestimating the growing importance of electric cars."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"""These comments are interesting given we have previously noted our concerns around PSA's lack of investment in key future trends,"" said London-based Evercore ISI analyst Arndt Ellinghorst."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"PSA only came eighth in a top-ten ranking compiled by Evercore of carmakers based on average R&D spending between 2014-2016, lagging rivals such as Ford , Renault and leader Volkswagen where Neumann was formerly in charge of group-wide electronics research."

Ford Motor,2017-6,"WASHINGTON, June 9 (Reuters) - New York State's attorney general and 12 other top state law enforcement officials said on Friday they would mount a vigorous court challenge to any effort to roll back vehicle emission rules by the Trump administration."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"In March, President Donald Trump ordered a review of U.S. vehicle fuel-efficiency standards from 2022-2025 put in place by the Obama administration, saying they were too tough on the auto industry."
Ford Motor,2017-6,The push to weaken the rules by the Trump administration comes as automakers are worried that consumers shift to larger vehicles and low gas prices will make it expensive or impossible to meet the regulations. They also fear a prolonged fight with states over the rules could make revising their product plans difficult.
Ford Motor,2017-6,Democratic state officials have been increasingly aggressive in challenging Trump administration regulatory rollback efforts.
Ford Motor,2017-6,"""In light of the critical public health and environmental benefits the standards will deliver, if EPA acts to weaken or delay the current standards for model years 2022-25, like California, we intend to vigorously pursue appropriate legal remedies to block such action,"" the state attorneys wrote in a letter to the Environmental Protection Agency including Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Iowa, Washington State, Oregon and Rhode Island."
Ford Motor,2017-6,An EPA spokesman said Friday the agency is reviewing the letter.
Ford Motor,2017-6,"Automakers including General Motors Co , Ford Motor Co and Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T> say the Obama administration did not conduct a proper review to ensure those rules are feasible."
Ford Motor,2017-6,Automakers have met with Trump administration officials in recent months and hope to reach a deal with California and other states on vehicle fuel efficiency standards.
Ford Motor,2017-6,"Gloria Bergquist, a spokeswoman for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a trade group, said automakers ""urge everyone to avoid pre-judging the results"" of the ongoing review. ""A process is now under way again for a thoughtful and coordinated analysis,"""
Ford Motor,2017-6,"California has opposed weakening the rules, threatened to pursue tougher standards unilaterally and could mount a legal challenge."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"The White House plans to hold negotiations with car companies, California and potentially other states. A deal would remove uncertainty for automakers, who need years of lead time to engineer future models and want uniform rules across all 50 states."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"The Obama administration's rules, negotiated with automakers in 2011, were aimed at doubling average fleet-wide fuel efficiency to 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025. Under the 2011 deal, the 2022-2025 model year rules had to be finalized by April 2018. The Obama administration completed a review of the 2022-2025 rules days before leaving office."

Ford Motor,2017-6,"DETROIT, June 8 (Reuters) - Big automakers are rushing to launch self-driving cars as early as 2021, but the industry's major players are moving slowly when it comes to widespread deployment of a less expensive crash prevention technology that regulators say could prevent thousands of deaths and injuries every year."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"Nissan Motor Co Ltd <7201.T> said on Thursday it would make automatic braking systems standard on an estimated 1 million 2018 model cars and light trucks sold in the United States, including high-volume models such as the Rogue and Rogue Sport compact sport utility vehicles, the Altima sedan, Murano and Pathfinder SUVs, LEAF electric car, Maxima sedan and Sentra small car.

Ford Motor,2017-6,Rival Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T> has said it will make so-called automatic emergency braking standard on nearly all its U.S. models by the end of this year. [nWNAB0AD2N]
Ford Motor,2017-6,"Overall, however, most automakers are not rushing to make automatic brake systems part of the base cost of mainstream vehicles sold in the competitive U.S. market. The industry has come under pressure from regulators, lawmakers and safety advocates to adopt the technology, which can slow or stop a vehicle even if the driver fails to act."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"So far, only about 17 percent of models tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety offered standard collision-avoiding braking, according to data supplied by the auto safety research group backed insurance industry. Many of the models with standard collision-avoiding brake systems are luxury vehicles made by European or Japanese manufacturers."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"The systems require more sensors and software than conventional brakes, and automakers said they need time to engineer the systems into vehicles as part of more comprehensive makeovers."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"Last year, 20 automakers reached a voluntary agreement with U.S. auto safety regulators to make collision-avoiding braking systems standard equipment by 2022. [nL2N16P1S5]"
Ford Motor,2017-6,"Safety advocates have petitioned the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to begin a regulatory process to require the technologies, but the agency has said the voluntary agreement will result in faster deployment than a formal rule-making process. NHTSA says the technology could eliminate one-fifth of crashes."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"""Do the math. That's 5 million crashes every year - 20 percent reduction means 1 million less. Those are big numbers,"" Mark Rosekind, the NHTSA's then-administrator, told Reuters last year."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"But customers would likely experience the benefits of the technology infrequently. The technology to enable a car to drive itself is far more costly, but industry executives foresee autonomous vehicles driving revenue-generating transportation services that could be attractive to investors."
Ford Motor,2017-6,General Motors Co offers automatic braking as optional equipment on about two-thirds of its models. The company did not say on Thursday how many vehicles have the technology as standard equipment. GM has not made public its plans to make the technology standard across its lineup.
Ford Motor,2017-6,"""Any time you have a voluntary agreement you have a spectrum of implementation,"" Jeff Boyer, GM's vice president for safety, told Reuters earlier this week. Asked when GM would roll out standard automatic braking, Boyer said, ""let's just say we honor the voluntary commitment."""

Currently, automatic braking systems are optional on several 2017 Ford and Lincoln models, and will be offered on certain 2018 models including the best-selling F-150 pickup truck."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV offers automatic braking as optional equipment in nine model lines, using cameras and radar to detect hazards ahead. The company has said it will meet the 2022 target for making the systems standard."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"As 2018 models roll out during the second half of this year, more vehicles will offer automatic braking, said Dean McConnell, an executive with Continental AG 's North American business. Continental's automatic braking technology systems will be on certain Nissan models."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"""We see it accelerating,"" he said. ""It varies. There are some (automakers) that are being aggressive"" and others that are waiting."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"Nissan did not disclose how much prices for vehicles would rise to offset the cost of standard automatic emergency braking. The 2018 models will be launched later this year. Currently, Nissan, like most carmakers, offers automatic braking as part of a bundle of optional safety and technology features."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"A 2017 Nissan Sentra compact sedan has a starting price of $17,875. To buy the car equipped with automatic braking requires spending another $6,820 for a Sentra SR with a premium technology package."

Ford Motor,2017-6,"NEW YORK, June 8 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Tesla's shareholders have revealed their faith is blind. Even after excluding the 22 percent stake owned by founder and Chief Executive Elon Musk, a proposal forcing all seven board members to stand for election every year was rejected at this week's annual meeting. Authorizing bad corporate governance makes little sense at a company with such a lofty valuation."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"Tesla's argument for the status quo rings hollow. It reckons directors risk being ""distracted by special interests that seek only short-term returns"" if each were to face re-election annually. But the company is losing money and has no cash to spare. Absent a highly unlikely sale, there's not much that a short-term-biased director could do."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"Enough investors were nevertheless persuaded. That's surprising, especially considering recent history. Last year, about three-quarters of unaffiliated shareholders supported a proposal to eliminate the limited supermajority voting rules. That fell to 42 percent after factoring in Musk's block."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"Yet Tesla's board could use a shakeup. Lead director Antonio Gracias, Steve Jurvetson and Musk's brother Kimbal all sit on the board at another Musk company, SpaceX, in which fellow director and venture capitalist Ira Ehrenpreis has invested. Gracias was also a director at SolarCity before Tesla bought it last year and runs a private-equity fund Musk backs, while Brad Buss spent seven years as SolarCity's finance chief."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"That leaves just one member with no other obvious ties to the boss. Musk did, at least, say at Tuesday's meeting that he hopes to add some independent directors soon. Even so, shareholders are too accepting of Tesla's chummy board."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"Of course, the company's stock also has surged over 60 percent over the past year. At a market value of $60 billion, it's worth more than both Ford and General Motors . Tesla also now trades at 30 times consensus earnings for 2020, according to Thomson Reuters data, implying astonishing growth in vehicle sales at eye-popping margins of at least 30 percent. The complete confidence of shareholders is as consistent in the market as it is at the ballot."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"- A majority of Tesla's independent shareholders on June 6 voted against a proposal at the carmaker's annual meeting to force board directors to stand for election each year, the company revealed in a regulatory filing on June 8. Tesla currently allows its seven directors to serve three-year terms."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"- Tesla recommended shareholders vote against the proposal, put forward by the Connecticut Retirement Plans and Trust Fund, arguing it allows directors ""to maximize the interests of the Company and our stockholders over the long-term, without being distracted by special interests that seek only short-term returns."""
Ford Motor,2017-6,"- Holders of 74.7 million shares voted against the proposal, while 32.7 million voted in favor. After stripping out Musk's 36.1 million shares, 38.5 million independent owners rejected the amendment."

Ford Motor,2017-6,"From its San Francisco base, Canvas started offering variable-term leases with flexible payment options to Bay area customers in early May, with plans to eventually roll out the service to other cities."
Ford Motor,2017-6,Canvas's roots date back to an earlier startup called Breeze.
Ford Motor,2017-6,"""Our mission is to identify, test and launch financial products that meet the changing needs of consumers,"" said Ned Ryan, co-founder of Breeze and chief executive officer of Canvas, in an interview."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"The focus on consumers, including those who might not qualify for conventional auto leases or don't want to make long-term financial commitments, is a pivot from Breeze's original mission, which was to provide short-term vehicle leases to ride-sharing drivers who worked mainly for Uber and Lyft."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"When both ride-sharing firms began offering lease plans of their own, including short-term financing deals through General Motors Co's Maven subsidiary, the potential market for Breeze thinned markedly and the company ceased operations in July 2016."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"Seeing a related opportunity and a broader audience, Ford Credit acquired the assets of Breeze, along with many of its executives and employees, in November 2016 and rebranded the company as Canvas."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"Ford Credit recognized ""the need for financial services and technology to facilitate our future vision of mobile,"" said David McClelland, executive vice president of marketing and sales."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"The Breeze acquisition gave Ford Credit access to a web-based platform and month-to-month vehicle ""subscriptions"" that bundle maintenance, insurance and roadside assistance, aimed at younger, non-traditional drivers."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"Because Canvas buys used Ford vehicles coming off lease, it also gives the automaker a new source of revenue and another way to manage used-car values, which have plummeted in recent months."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"Unlike Breeze, Canvas does not compete head-to-head with Maven, which offers ride-sharing drivers short-term leases on new Chevrolet Bolt EV electric vehicles and used GM vehicles, through such programs as Maven Gig and Lyft Express Drive."

Ford Motor,2017-6,"TORONTO, June 5 (Reuters) - BlackBerry Ltd on Monday downplayed news that Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T> would adopt rival software for its future vehicle consoles, saying it was more focused on the faster-growing market for autonomous driving technology."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"Automotive Grade Linux (AGL), a collaborative effort of some 100 technology companies and automakers, said last week that Toyota would start using its open-source software in Entune 3.0 consoles of its 2018 Camry sedans, before deploying it in most Toyota and Lexus vehicles sold in North America."

Ford Motor,2017-6,One economist attributed the record May sales to discounting among the large automakers in a fight for market share.
Ford Motor,2017-6,"Automakers sold 216,861 vehicles in May, a number which ""smashed all previous monthly records,"" and was up 11 percent compared with the same month a year earlier, Canadian auto analyst Dennis DesRosiers wrote in a note."

Ford Motor,2017-6,One economist attributed the record May sales to discounting among the large automakers in a fight for market share.
Ford Motor,2017-6,"Automakers sold 216,861 vehicles in May, a number which ""smashed all previous monthly records,"" and was up 11 percent compared with the same month a year earlier, Canadian auto analyst Dennis DesRosiers wrote in a note."

Ford Motor,2017-6,"By contrast, in the United States, automakers reported sales fell 1 percent from a year ago.

Ford Motor,2017-6,"WASHINGTON, June 1 (Reuters) - More than 65 percent of 46.2 million recalled Takata Corp <7312.T> airbag inflators in the United States have not been repaired, a U.S. senator said on Thursday, urging automakers to speed up the pace of repairs."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"Senator Bill Nelson of Florida said only 15.8 million inflators out of 46.2 million inflators recalled to date have been repaired through mid-May, though nationwide recalls began in 2015. He was citing answers submitted from a National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) independent monitor."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"About 8.8 million owners had received recall notices, Nelson said, but they were told no replacement parts were currently available."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"The affected Takata inflators can explode with excessive force, unleashing metal shrapnel inside cars and trucks. They have been blamed for at least 16 deaths and more than 180 injuries worldwide."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"Inflator recalls began around 2008 and involve around 100 million inflators around the world used in vehicles made by 19 automakers, including Honda Motor Co <7267.T>, Ford Motor Co , Volkswagen AG and Tesla Inc ."

Ford Motor,2017-6,"Nelson noted the administration of President Donald Trump still had not nominated a candidate to lead NHTSA. ""We're in desperate need of a leader who will commit to resolving this Takata mess,"" Nelson said in a statement."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"In February, Takata pleaded guilty to U.S. charges of criminal wrongdoing and to pay $1 billion to resolve a federal investigation into its inflators."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"The majority of the air bag-related fatalities and injuries have occurred in the United States, and most of them in Honda vehicles."
Ford Motor,2017-6,"Automakers have recalled 46 million Takata air bag inflators in 29 million U.S. vehicles. By 2019, automakers will recall 64 million to 69 million U.S. inflators in 42 million total vehicles, NHTSA said in December."
Ford Motor,2017-6,Takata has been searching for more than a year for a financial sponsor to pay the replacement costs for its inflators which are at the center of the auto industry's biggest recall.
