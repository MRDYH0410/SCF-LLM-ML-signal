Ford Motor,2017-7,"{{20170731T100001.261+0000}}Ford CEO Hackett reviewing future products, plants, countries -sourcesBy Paul Lienert and Joseph White"
Ford Motor,2017-7,"July 31 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co Chief Executive Jim Hackett is reviewing the automaker's operations in India and other markets, as well as Ford's future product programs including plans to build a self-driving commercial vehicle in 2021, according to company officials and other sources familiar with that review."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"Hackett, who took over as CEO in May, has told investors he is working on a 100-day review of Ford's operations but has so far provided few details of the process, except to indicate that it is looking at the automakers' luxury vehicle strategy, the future of its small vehicles and investments in emerging markets."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"Ford Chief Financial Officer Bob Shanks told Reuters in an interview that the review covers a range of issues, including Ford's strategy for India."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"""We have a lot of work to do (as) we address issues of how to fix India,"" Shanks said. ""Everything is on the table."""
Ford Motor,2017-7,"General Motors Co in May said it would stop selling cars in India but continue to produce vehicles there for export. [nL4N1IK1ZS] Shanks said no decisions have been made and noted that Ford has a larger business in India than GM did. ""We are very cognizant that will be the third-largest market in the world,"" he said."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"""Some big decisions will be made,"" Shanks said, but he cautioned Ford may not disclose all those decisions at the end of the 100-day review."
Ford Motor,2017-7,Hackett is addressing challenges that have contributed to a nearly 8 percent decline in Ford's share price this year.
Ford Motor,2017-7,"The review of the Lincoln luxury brand includes whether current plans will meet former CEO Mark Fields' ambitious targets for growth and revenue, people familiar with the process said."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"Ford has set a target of putting a self-driving shuttle into commercial ride-sharing fleets by 2021. Hackett is reviewing the investment and timing for that project, the sources said."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"Hackett also assessing whether to reduce and consolidate production of models such as the Fiesta subcompact and two midsized sedans that are built in multiple locations around the world, but are experiencing slowing demand."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"One proposal would shift production of the next-generation Mondeo mid-sized sedan from Europe to Mexico, where it would share an assembly line with its sibling, the Ford Fusion, avoiding the cost of retooling two plants."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"Shortly after he took charge, Hackett approved a proposal to shift production of the next-generation Focus for North America from Mexico to China, saving the company an estimated $500 million by consolidating two factories into one."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"Hackett also is said to be questioning a plan to build at least half a dozen future models, including replacements for the Ford Mustang and Explorer and Lincoln Continental, on a new flexible platform that is designed to accommodate both front- and rear-wheel-drive vehicles."

Ford Motor,2017-7,"{{20170727T220449.855+0000}}UPDATE 2-Honda says Florida crash death may be linked to Takata air bag inflator(Adds attempt to reach Takata, NHTSA investigating, Honda comment)"
Ford Motor,2017-7,"July 27 (Reuters) - Honda Motor Co <7267.T> said on Thursday that a Takata airbag inflator ruptured in car crash last week in Florida, in what could be the 19th death worldwide linked to faulty airbags recalled as part of the largest automotive safety campaign in history."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"The Japanese automaker said the driver of a 2002 Honda Accord was killed in Holiday, Florida, after the inflator ruptured. An official cause of death has not been announced."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"Last week, authorities in Australia said the death of a Sydney man earlier this month was likely the result of a faulty Takata airbag inflator."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"At least 18 deaths and 180 injuries worldwide have been tied to the defect that led Takata Corp to file for bankruptcy protection last month. Takata inflators can explode with excessive force, unleashing metal shrapnel inside cars and trucks."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"Last week's crash involved a 34-year-old woman who died around 6:40 p.m. on Wednesday in a head-on collision near St. Petersburg when a 19-year-old driving a 1999 Pontiac Firebird turned into her path, according to local media reports."
Ford Motor,2017-7,The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration sent an investigator to Florida.
Ford Motor,2017-7,"The inflator in 2002 Accords has been recalled since 2011 and Honda said it had mailed 21 recall notices over several years to registered owners of this vehicle. Ten notices had been sent to the current registered owner, but the repairs were never completed, Honda said."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"""This is more evidence that the recall is failing and not enough is being done to find the affected vehicles and fix them,"" U.S. Senator Bill Nelson of Florida said in a statement."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"Honda said it has adequate replacement parts and urged owners ""to seek repair as soon as possible,"" adding that older vehicles, especially 2001-2003 Honda vehicles, pose the greatest safety risk."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"Last year, NHTSA urged owners to stop driving about 300,000 2001-2003 Honda vehicles until they were fixed. NHTSA said some 2001-2003 vehicles had as much as a 50 percent chance of a dangerous air bag inflator rupture in a crash."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"Of the deaths linked to Takata inflators, 17 involved Honda vehicles since May 2009, including five in Malaysia using a different type Takata inflator. One death occurred in a Ford Motor Co vehicle in South Carolina in December 2015."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"Scott Caudill, chief operating officer of TK Holdings, Takata's U.S. unit, has said Takata recalled, or expected to recall, about 125 million vehicles worldwide by 2019, including more than 60 million in the United States."
Ford Motor,2017-7,UK car industry says clarity needed now as Brexit weighs - Reuters News
Ford Motor,2017-7,{{20170726T230101.815+0000}}UK car industry says clarity needed now as Brexit weighsBy William Schomberg
Ford Motor,2017-7,"LONDON, July 27 (Reuters) - Britain's car-makers and traders are starting to feel the strains of Brexit, and output this year is likely fall short of the industry's expectations, the head of the leading UK group in the sector said."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"Mike Hawes, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, said the government needed to say now what its plans were for the sector when Britain left the European Union in 2019."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"The number of cars made in Britain in June slumped by almost 14 percent year on year to 136,901, the SMMT said on Thursday."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"That left first half output in a sector that supports more than 800,000 jobs down nearly 3 percent at 866,656 units."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"Although that represented the second-highest January-June performance in 12 years and a pick-up was likely later in the year, output in 2017 would probably be closer to 1.8 million units than a previous forecast of 1.9 million, Hawes said."
Ford Motor,2017-7,Britain's car industry has boomed in recent years with global manufacturers investing heavily in the country as a base for selling to the rest of the EU and beyond. More than half of the cars exported from Britain go to the EU.
Ford Motor,2017-7,"But last year's decision by voters to leave the bloc has left the industry exposed. The bloc has tariffs of 10 percent on car imports, posing a risk if Britain leaves in under two years' time with no new trade deal in place."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"The impact of the referendum on the country's consumers is another problem for car-makers. Households have been pinched by a sharp rise in inflation, caused in large part by the fall in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"Cars made for the domestic market were down nearly 10 percent in the first six months of 2017 while exports - which account for nearly 80 percent of output - were roughly stable, SMMT figures showed."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"The SMMT's long-held target of increasing production to just under 2 million units in 2020 was also in doubt, with changing assumptions about individual company decisions on their models also a factor."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"Britain could miss the target by 10 percent if it fails to secure an interim deal with the EU, Hawes said."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"The SMMT, like other British industry groups, wants the country to stay in the EU's single market and customs union as it transitions to a future trading relationship with the EU, something the government is ruling out."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"""The government has been in listening mode but now it must put on the table the concrete plans that will assure the future competitiveness of the sector,"" Hawes said."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"A fall in investment this year was another sign of Brexit concerns, even if some of the drop had been expected after strong levels in recent years, he said."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"The industry also faces the challenge of shifting away from petrol- and diesel-fuelled cars. On Wednesday, the government said it would ban such vehicles from 2040 to promote electric cars. [nL5N1KH21I]"

Ford Motor,2017-7,{{20170726T190400.391+0000}}UPDATE 5-Ford results foreshadow tougher times for Detroit automakers(Adds CFO comments)
Ford Motor,2017-7,"DETROIT, July 26 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co on Wednesday joined rival General Motors Co in reporting higher-than-expected second-quarter profits, and in the next breath warning of a rougher ride for the rest of the year."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"Ford said full-year pre-tax profit, automotive operating margins and cash flow would be lower than 2016 results, sending the company's shares down 2.1 percent."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"Rival GM on Tuesday reported headline profits that beat analysts' estimates, but warned that profits for the second half of the year will likely be lower than the first half, as the company scales back scale back North American production to cut its burgeoning inventories. [nL1N1KG0CT]"
Ford Motor,2017-7,"Ford and GM's results present a counterpoint to other big U.S. companies reporting strong profits, including heavy equipment maker Caterpillar Inc , aircraft maker Boeing Co and telecommunications power AT&T Inc . [nL3N1KH4VH]"
Ford Motor,2017-7,"Investors worry that for Detroit's automakers, the second quarter marks a peak and profits are headed downhill. Thousands of workers at GM's U.S. factories are dealing with short- and long-term layoffs as production of slow-selling sedans is throttled back."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"Ford's new Chief Executive, Jim Hackett, on Wednesday promised investors a rethink of Ford's spending, marketing and investment strategy within his first 100 days, focusing on the company's approach to emerging markets, small cars and its Lincoln luxury brand."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"In the meantime, Ford is contending with sliding sales and rising costs. Ford's global sales fell by 43,000 vehicles in the quarter, and the company Ford said its full-year margin in North America, its most profitable market, would be lower than in 2016 due to $1.2 billion in additional commodity costs, costlier price cuts and engineering expenses."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"Ford Chief Financial Officer Bob Shanks told Reuters on Wednesday the company would be concerned if the United States imposed new tariffs on imported steel, as the Trump Administration is considering. ""It would give producers here the opportunity to raise prices,"" he said."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"Ford reported second-quarter net income of $2.04 billion, or 51 cents per share, up from nearly $2 billion, or 49 cents per share, a year earlier. A big contributor was a lower tax rate of 15 percent, half the level analysts had expected."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"Excluding one-time items, Ford earned 56 cents a share, and on that basis analysts, on average, looked for 43 cents."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"It forecast full-year adjusted earnings per share in a range from $1.65 to $1.85, above the $1.51 expected by Wall Street, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. However, the company has already booked 96 cents a share in adjusted profit - more than half its full-year target. GM has also generated more than half its full year target of $6 to $6.50 a share."

Ford Motor,2017-7,{{20170726T144807.481+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-New Ford boss leaves shareholders stuck in traffic(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.)
Ford Motor,2017-7,"NEW YORK, July 26 (Reuters Breakingviews) - The first earnings report after taking office usually offers a new boss the perfect excuse for ditching the predecessor's financial targets with near impunity. Ford Chief Executive Jim Hackett, though, decided against using his 65th day running the Glass House to carry out such a kitchen-sinking. He instead chose to leave the carmakers' shareholders stuck in traffic."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"For starters, only a whopping tax break allowed the company to handily beat second-quarter estimates. The 10.2 percent rate it paid, after taking advantage of some deferred benefits from past overseas losses, boosted earnings per share to 56 cents, way ahead of the consensus-matching 43 cents its more usual 30 percent levy would have produced."
Ford Motor,2017-7,Abandoning that practice allowed Ford to mask what could be as much as a 14 percent drop in its earlier guidance of $9 billion in 2017 pre-tax earnings. That ruse was wholly unnecessary since many analysts were already assuming the previous target was too high and even factoring in cuts next year.
Ford Motor,2017-7,"It's not an auspicious start for a CEO brought in to speed up change and profit at America's second-largest vehicle producer. And it partly explains why the stock is currently just 1 percent higher than when he took over from Mark Fields, who was ousted in May after a more than one-third drop in the company's value during his time behind the wheel."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"Hackett talks a big game about improving Ford, not least its decision-making processes, the way it invests capital and the mobility unit he used to run that works on autonomous-driving and connected cars. So far, though, words are all investors have to go by. He will quickly need to do better than this to navigate the stock out of the mire."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"- Ford Motor on July 26 reported second-quarter net income of $2 billion, or 51 cents a share. Excluding one-off items, the company earned 56 cents a share. The consensus estimate of sell-side analysts was for earnings of 43 cents a share."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"- The carmaker's results were helped by an adjusted tax rate of just 10.2 percent, compared with 31.4 percent in the same period last year. This included $421 million from realizing deferred tax assets in businesses outside the United States."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"- The company also said it has revised upwards its expected earnings to between $1.65 and $1.85 a share, ahead of sell-side expectations of $1.51 a share. That is due to the annual tax rate dropping to 15 percent, compared with analysts' consensus estimate of 30 percent."

Ford Motor,2017-7,"DETROIT, July 26 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co on Wednesday reported a better-than-expected quarterly net profit due to a lower tax rate and increased U.S. sales of more-profitable pickup trucks, but forecast a slightly lower 2017 pre-tax profit, sending its shares down 2.3 percent."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"Against a backdrop of declining sales for the U.S. auto industry, Ford leaned heavily on consumer discounts during the quarter and the value of its unsold vehicles rose. Ford warned its full-year automotive operating margin and cash flow would be lower than in 2016."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"The No. 2 U.S. automaker said, however, a reduced tax rate would boost its full-year net profit. The results are the first for Chief Executive Jim Hackett since Ford ousted his predecessor in late May and elected him to the top spot."
Ford Motor,2017-7,Hackett has promised a broad-reaching review of Ford's operations within his first 100 days.
Ford Motor,2017-7,Analysts are concerned about the high discounts that Ford and other automakers are relying on to sell cars and high supplies of unsold vehicles.
Ford Motor,2017-7,"Ford's global sales were down 43,000 vehicles in the quarter, with 8,000 of that coming in the U.S. market. Ford said its full-year margin in North America would be lower than in 2016 due to rising commodity costs and engineering expenses."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"Rival General Motors Co on Tuesday reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit, helped by cost-cutting, and promised to scale back production to cut its burgeoning inventories. [nL1N1KG0CT]"
Ford Motor,2017-7,"Ford said it now expect full-year adjusted earnings per share in a range from $1.65 to $1.85, above the $1.51 expected by Wall Street, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S."
Ford Motor,2017-7,But Chief Financial Officer Bob Shanks said this would be largely due to a 2017 tax rate of 15 percent as Ford pulls forward deferred tax losses from outside the United States and could be affected by U.S. market conditions. Wall Street had expected an effective tax rate of 30 percent for 2017.
Ford Motor,2017-7,"Shanks said Ford's pre-tax profit would be slightly lower than the $9 billion Ford has previously forecast, after a record of $10.4 billion in 2016."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"In a research note for clients, Buckingham Research Group analyst Joseph Amaturo wrote that stripping out the impact of the lower tax rate, the midpoint of Ford's full-year earnings outlook is below analyst expectations."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"""We recommend investors remain on the sidelines given our concerns for lower U.S. industry volumes... and continued pricing pressure we expect for the back half of the year, which likely puts profitability under pressure,"" he wrote."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"Ford's CFO said the company has canceled plans to build the next generation of its compact Focus model in South America. For the North American market, Ford announced last month that it would move production of the Focus to China from Mexico."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"The company reported second-quarter net income of $2.04 billion, or 51 cents per share, up from just under $2 billion, or 49 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, the No. 2 U.S. automaker reported earnings per share of 56 cents, and on that basis analysts, on average, looked for 43 cents."

Ford Motor,2017-7,"SAN DIEGO, July 22 (Reuters) - Canadian director Denis Villeneuve had fended off numerous requests to direct big-budget sequels until he was approached to make a follow-up to Ridley Scott's 1982 neo-noir sci-fi film ""Blade Runner."""
Ford Motor,2017-7,"""I accepted to do 'Blade Runner' because it was meaningful,"" Villeneuve, the director of last year's cerebral alien sci-fi film ""Arrival,"" told Reuters."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"""The resonance of the first movie in my life, the love I have for it, it's worth it to take that risk,"" he added."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"""Blade Runner 2049,"" in theaters on Oct. 6, will pick up 30 years after the events of the first movie, when human-like robots were hunted by police in a dystopian Los Angeles."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"""We created a world that is an extension of the first movie, a projection of its future, where some laws and some rules will be in relationship with the first movie and not with today,"" Villeneuve said."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"The first film followed Harrison Ford as ""blade runner"" Rick Deckard, an expert on hunting the humanoid Replicant robots living on earth illegally, against a backdrop of a futuristic Los Angeles depicted as a hybrid of Eastern and Western cultural influences."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"In a new trailer released this week, the sequel returns to a dystopian California after the ecosystem has broken down, where a Los Angeles police officer (Ryan Gosling) stumbles upon a secret that could jeopardize society and seeks out Deckard, who has been missing for 30 years."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"Villeneuve, Ford and Gosling were joined by other cast members on Saturday at San Diego's annual Comic-Con as they discussed the sequel and debuted new footage that showed a world where Replicants and humans live alongside each other, but not in harmony."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"""The original film explored the ethics of the creation of the Replicants and their utility and we further developed those themes in this story,"" Ford said."
Ford Motor,2017-7,Villeneuve told Reuters that he had worked with Ford to evolve the character of Deckard.
Ford Motor,2017-7,"""There's a melancholia that I like in the first movie that we kept alive in Deckard, and something taciturn, not someone who talks a lot, and a sadness to the character that is there and existential doubt,"" the director said."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"The sequel will stay close to the original film's themes of identity and memory, Villeneuve added."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"""I don't think the movie will necessarily say interesting things about our future, apart from the fact we're still there, but it'll say things about today, for sure,"" he said."

Ford Motor,2017-7,"Separately, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said Nissan Motor Co <7201.T> agreed to recall 515,394 2007-2011 Versa cars after Takata declared 2.7 million vehicles to have potentially defective inflators."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"Ford spokesman John Cangany said the automaker will file a petition requesting ""to continue testing and analyzing our inflators."" The NHTSA said the petition will seek an exemption from the recall because Ford believes the issue is inconsequential."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"Ford said the issue covers 2.5 million vehicles, including the 2007-11 Ranger, 2006-12 Fusion and Lincoln MKZ, 2006-11 Mercury Milan, and 2007-10 Ford Edge and Lincoln MKX. Ford previously said it covered about 2.2 million vehicles."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"Last week, the NHTSA said that new testing prompted Takata to declare inflators defective in Ford, Nissan and Mazda Motor Corp <7261.T> vehicles in some driver-side air bags built from 2012 through 2015."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"The NHTSA said in a statement on Friday that ""testing data shows that the propellant in this inflator is degrading and on the path towards potential ruptures in the future. There are no reported ruptures in the real-world or in testing."""
Ford Motor,2017-7,"Takata air bag inflators are already linked to 17 deaths and more than 180 injuries worldwide, and the recalls will eventually cover about 125 million inflators."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"Nissan said last week it would recall 627,000 Versa cars from the 2007-12 model years, including 515,000 in the United States ""out of an abundance of caution."""
Ford Motor,2017-7,"Nissan said testing of 895 inflators showed no ruptures, while one ""exhibited an elevated internal pressure."" Takata said the inflators potentially could rupture ""after several years of exposure to high absolute humidity."""
Ford Motor,2017-7,"Mazda said last week the issue impacts just 6,000 of 2007-09 B-series trucks that were built under a previous Ford partnership. The company said on Friday that it also plans to file a petition to avoid a recall."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"The automakers have 30 days to submit their petitions, and the NHTSA will then take public comment before making a decision."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"More than 65 percent of 46.2 million previously recalled Takata airbag inflators in the United States have not been repaired. The issue is the largest-ever auto-safety recall, covering 17 automakers."

Ford Motor,2017-7,"NANJING, China, July 20 (Reuters) - While Western drivers like the 'new car' smell fresh off the production line, Chinese would rather their cars didn't smell of anything - a cultural divide that's testing car makers seeking an edge to revive sales in the world's biggest auto market."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"At Ford Motor Co , for example, 18 smell assessors - dubbed ""golden noses"" - at its research plant outside the eastern city of Nanjing test the smell of each material that goes inside a Ford car to be sold in China and around Asia."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"The China smell test isn't unique, but illustrates the lengths automakers go to to attract buyers in markets where consumer attitudes vary widely."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"""In North America, people want a new car smell and will even buy a 'new car' spray to make older cars feel new and fresh. In China it's the opposite,"" says Andy Pan, supervisor for material engineering at the Ford facility, which employs around 2,300 people."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"The smell of a new car in China can have an outsized effect. A J.D. Power report last year showed that unpleasant car smells were the top concern for Chinese drivers, ahead of engine issues, road noise or fuel consumption."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"The smell assessors at Ford, whose China sales are down 7 percent this year, [nL3N1JX1R8] [nL4N1K22BG] carry out 300 tests a year, a third more than their counterparts in Europe. They rate the odour of all materials used in a car from ""not perceptible"" to ""extremely disturbing""."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"Pungent materials - from carpets to seat covers and steering wheels - are noted as smelling of anything from ""burnt tire"" and ""bad meat"" to ""moth balls"" or ""dirty socks"". Some are sent back to the supplier."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"Seats for Ford cars in China are stored in perforated cloth bags to keep them ventilated before being installed, as opposed to plastic wrapping in the U.S. market where consumers are less concerned about chemical smells."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"""The smell inside the car can often be pretty pungent,"" said Tom Lin, a 24-year-old high-school teacher in Zhejiang province, who bought a local Roewe brand car last October. He said there was still a bit of an odour six months later."

Ford Motor,2017-7,"To be sure, smell is just one factor for automakers to get right in China, where picky buyers are always looking for fresh car models and Beijing is making a big drive towards new energy vehicles. [nL8N1K44FT]"
Ford Motor,2017-7,"In a slower market - consultancy IHS forecasts vehicle sales will slip slightly this year - firms are looking for an extra edge to appeal to consumers, beyond price discounts, says IHS analyst James Chao."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"Local rivals Geely Automobile <0175.HK> and BYD Co Ltd <002594.SZ> tout their in-car air filters to protect drivers from China's harmful air pollution, and BMW says it is adding larger touch screens and tweaking colours to appeal to Chinese buyers."

Ford Motor,2017-7,"""When I lived in the United States I might look at the suspension or the engine,"" said Don Yu, China general manager at CGT, which makes materials to cover car seats and dashboards for General Motors , Volkswagen and Ford."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"""In China, though, people open the car and sit inside, if the smell isn't good enough they think it will jeopardize their health."""
Ford Motor,2017-7,"For Ford's ""golden noses"" that means a strict routine. Testers undergo a tough selection process, proving themselves on blind smell tests before being chosen."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"""We have to have very healthy habits; we can't smoke, we can't drink,"" says one of the team, 33-year-old Amy Han, adding she avoids spicy food and doesn't wear nail polish, strong perfume or even a leather jacket to keep her smell sense sharp."

Ford Motor,2017-7,"WASHINGTON, July 19 (Reuters) - A U.S. House panel on Wednesday approved a sweeping proposal by voice vote to allow automakers to deploy up to 100,000 self-driving vehicles without meeting existing auto safety standards and bar states from imposing driverless car rules."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"Representative Robert Latta, a Republican who heads the Energy and Commerce Committee subcommittee overseeing consumer protection, said he would continue to consider changes before the full committee votes on the measure, expected next week. The full U.S. House of Representatives will not take up the bill until it reconvenes in September after the summer recess."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"The measure, which would be the first significant federal legislation aimed at speeding self-driving cars to market, would require automakers to submit safety assessment reports to U.S. regulators, but would not require pre-market approval of advanced vehicle technologies."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"Automakers would have to show self-driving cars ""function as intended and contain fail safe features"" to get exemptions from safety standards but the Transportation Department could not ""condition deployment or testing of highly automated vehicles on review of safety assessment certifications,"" the draft measure unveiled late Monday said."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"The issue has taken new urgency because road deaths in the United States rose 7.7 percent in 2015 over the previous year to 35,200, the highest annual jump since 1966. Traffic deaths climbed nearly 8 percent in the first nine months of 2016, government data showed."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"Current federal motor vehicle safety rules prevent the sale of self-driving vehicles without human controls. Automakers must meet nearly 75 auto safety standards, many of which were written with the assumption that a licensed driver will be in control of the vehicle."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"General Motors Co , Alphabet Inc , Ford Motor Co , Tesla Inc and others have been lobbying Congress to pre-empt rules under consideration in California and other states that could limit self-driving vehicle deployment."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"States could still set rules on registration, licensing, liability, insurance and safety inspections, but could not set self-driving car performance standards, under the proposal."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"Representative Debbie Dingell, a Democrat from Michigan, said the bill creates a ""strong but flexible regulatory framework"" that seeks to avoid ""a patchwork"" of different state rules."
Ford Motor,2017-7,Auto dealers want the final bill to clarify that the measure would not preempt state dealer franchise laws that generally bar automakers from selling vehicles directly to consumers.
Ford Motor,2017-7,"Democrats praised the bipartisan proposal but said they want more changes before the full committee takes it up, including potentially adding other auto safety measures."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a trade group, said it is ""pleased that the legislation is moving forward, and expect to see areas fine-tuned in the legislation."""
Ford Motor,2017-7,"Consumers Union, a public advocacy group, said the bill needs more changes and must ""ensure that automakers demonstrate automated vehicles' safety and don't put consumers at greater risk in a crash."" The group opposes ""restricting states' safety authority without strong federal safety standards in place."""
Ford Motor,2017-7,"The administration of former President Barack Obama last year unveiled voluntary guidelines on self-driving cars that asked automakers to submit a 15-question safety assessment. President Donald Trump's transportation secretary, Elaine Chao, said she plans to update those in the coming months."

Ford Motor,2017-7,"Automakers would have to show self-driving cars ""function as intended and contain fail safe features"" but the Transportation Department could not ""condition deployment or testing of highly automated vehicles on review of safety assessment certifications,"" the draft measure unveiled late Monday said."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"The issue has taken new urgency because road deaths in the United States rose 7.7 percent in 2015 over the previous year to 35,200, the highest annual jump since 1966. Traffic deaths climbed nearly 8 percent in the first nine months of 2016, government data showed."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"Current federal motor vehicle safety rules prevent the sale of self-driving vehicles without human controls. Automakers must meet nearly 75 auto safety standards, many of which were written with the assumption that a licensed driver will be in control of the vehicle."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"General Motors Co , Alphabet Inc , Ford Motor Co , Tesla Inc and others have been lobbying Congress to pre-empt rules under consideration in California and other states that could limit self-driving vehicle deployment."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"States could still set rules on registration, licensing, liability, insurance and safety inspections, but could not set self-driving car performance standards, under the proposal."
Ford Motor,2017-7,Auto dealers want the final bill to clarify that the measure would not preempt state dealer franchise laws that generally bar automakers from selling vehicles directly to consumers.
Ford Motor,2017-7,"Consumers Union, a public advocacy group, said Wednesday the bill needs more changes and must ""ensure that automakers demonstrate automated vehicles' safety and don't put consumers at greater risk in a crash."" The group opposes ""restricting states' safety authority without strong federal safety standards in place."""
Ford Motor,2017-7,"The administration of former President Barack Obama last year unveiled voluntary guidelines on self-driving cars that asked automakers to submit a 15-question safety assessment. President Donald Trump's transportation secretary, Elaine Chao, said she plans to update those in the coming months."

Ford Motor,2017-7,"WASHINGTON, July 17 (Reuters) - U.S. labor union leaders and Democratic lawmakers on Monday reminded U.S. President Donald Trump they expect him to keep election campaign promises to protect American workers in NAFTA talks, but they stopped short of demanding termination of the 1994 trade pact with Canada and Mexico."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"Their comments came hours before U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer was to outline the administration's priorities for the talks. Under U.S. ""fast-track"" rules, the administration must release the priorities 30 days before negotiations begin."

Ford Motor,2017-7,"The document outlining White House priorities was expected on Monday afternoon, said House Democrat Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut, a leading voice against trade legislation on Capitol Hill."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"The Trump administration has so far offered few specifics, other than expressing its desire to modernize the pact to increase U.S. manufacturing jobs and cut the trade deficit."

Ford Motor,2017-7,"July 17 (Reuters) - About $1 million worth of smuggled marijuana was discovered last week in the spare tire compartments of newly assembled Ford Fusion sedans imported into the United States from Mexico, U.S. officials said on Monday."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"The smuggling was uncovered on Wednesday when workers at a Ford dealer in Kent, Ohio found the marijuana in a new Fusion, said Major Dale Kelly of the Portage County Sheriff's Office by phone."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"In all, 15 Mexican-made Ford cars, each packed with marijuana instead of a spare tire, made it to Ohio by rail, the Drug Enforcement Agency said. The sheriff's office said that the shipment crossed over the Mexican border in Arizona."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"None of the cars, each packed with 32 pounds (14.5 kg) of marijuana, made it to consumers, Balzano said."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"The marijuana was likely supposed to be collected at the rail station or in transit, Bob Balzano, resident agent-in-charge of the DEA in Youngstown, Ohio, said by phone."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"After reaching Ohio by rail, nine of the 15 cars were then taken by truck to auto dealerships in Ohio and one went to a dealer in Pennsylvania, Balzano said. Five other cars never left the rail yard in Lordstown, Ohio."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"Of the 15 cars, 14 were Ford Fusion sedans and one was a Lincoln MKZ sedan, Balzano said."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"The marijuana was tightly packed into crescents, so that when two halves were put together, they created a circular shape like a tire."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"Ford Motor Co spokeswoman Kelli Felker said the U.S. automaker was working with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and U.S. Customs. ""We have confirmed that this is not happening at our plant or at our internal shipping yards,"" she said."

Ford Motor,2017-7,"{{20170714T182206.808+0000}}Behind the scenes, companies fight Trump on US steel tariffsBy Ginger Gibson"
Ford Motor,2017-7,"WASHINGTON, July 14 (Reuters) - American manufacturers, energy companies and retailers reliant on cheap steel are quietly lobbying against President Donald Trump's desire to impose tariffs on steel imports ahead of possible decision by the U.S. Commerce Department next week."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"Honoring a promise made in the 2016 election campaign, in April this year Trump initiated a ""Section 232"" review of the steel industry, a provision in the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 allowing for the imposition of tariffs or quotas on imports if they threaten national security. The provision has only been used to review imports twice before."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"The Commerce Department could issue findings on the matter as early as next week, a decision that three lobbyists say has been delayed due to debate inside the administration."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"Steel producers in the U.S., like U.S. Steel Corp and AK Steel stand to benefit from protectionist tariffs which would enable them to raise their prices."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"But U.S. manufacturers and energy companies who use steel want to keep their costs down and say tariffs could costs jobs in their industries, while retailers need cheap steel for many facets of their business including shelving in their stores and warehouses, and to sell to consumers."
Ford Motor,2017-7,Any U.S. tariffs may also result in damage to unrelated industries if other countries retaliate by also imposing tariffs on American exports in sectors such as agriculture.
Ford Motor,2017-7,"""Our member companies have quietly had these conversations with both members of the administration but also with the Hill,"" said Hun Quach, the vice president for international trade at the Retail Industry Leaders Association."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"Those in favor of approving new tariffs include not only steel manufacturers, but some aligned unions. They have allies in Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, a former U.S. Steel lawyer who has promised to recuse himself from decisions regarding the industry."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"Mario Longhi, who until a few weeks ago was chief executive of U.S. Steel, said earlier this year that curbing cheap steel imports could restore jobs for 10,000 American steel workers."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"The U.S. steel industry employed about 147,000 people in 2015, according to the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic analysis."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"But manufacturers that need steel employ about 6.5 million people each year, and the construction industry supports another 6.3 million jobs."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"Manufacturers argue that pushing up the cost of steel by imposing tariffs on imports ultimately hurts American consumers who will pay more for everyday goods made from steel, such as lawn mowers, washing machines, and microwaves."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"When former President George W. Bush imposed steel tariffs in 2002, the move was found illegal by the World Trade Organization which permitted other countries to retaliate against American exports and Bush was forced to back down."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"Studies by the free trade lobby group, the Consuming Industries Trade Action Coalition (CITAC), found that 200,000 workers in U.S. manufacturing lost their jobs as a result of the 2002 steel tariffs."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"Pushing back against something that was a signature piece of Trump's campaign carries some political risk though and most companies would only elaborate on their lobbying efforts anonymously, saying they were making their case to Trump and lawmakers behind closed doors."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"They see allies in Gary Cohn, the head of the National Economic Council and Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"""We've been quite vocal both on the Hill and in the administration,"" said a lobbyist for a large manufacturing company that uses both U.S. steel and imported steel, but who declined to speak on the record over concerns public statements could damage relationships with the White House."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"Several companies have also been pressing members of Congress to advocate against tariffs with the administration on their behalf, said several lobbyists."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"Several companies, including National Oilwell Varco Inc. , Ball Corporation , and Electrolux , submitted public comments to the Commerce Department arguing against tariffs."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"The American Petroleum Industry, which represents the largest oil refiners and chemical companies including ExxonMobil , Shell Oil Company , Chevron and Dow Chemical Company , issued forceful comments against the proposed tariffs, as did the American Automotive Policy Council, which includes Ford Motor Co. and General Motors ."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"""The auto industry and the U.S. workers that the industry employs would be adversely affected and that this unintended negative impact would exceed the benefit provided to the steel industry,"" the American Automotive Policy Council said in a message echoed in other comments."

Ford Motor,2017-7,"The new Accord, like rival Toyota Motor Corp's <7203.T> all-new Camry launching this month, offers more horsepower, safety technology like standard collision-avoiding braking, styling that pays homage to German sports sedans, and better fuel economy although Honda did not release figures."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"In a nod to driving enthusiasts, Honda will offer manual transmission as an option in two versions of the 2018 Accord, instead of only automatic shift in most midsize cars. Certain new Accords will be available with a new 10-speed auto shift, which Honda called a first for a front-wheel drive car."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"The new Accord's infotainment system can be upgraded over a Wi-Fi network, although functions such as braking or engine performance will not be upgradable over the air, Honda said."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"The Accord and Camry are pillars of their manufacturers' U.S. businesses, each selling well over 300,000 vehicles a year. In the coming months, Nissan Motor Co Ltd <7201.T> is expected to launch a new Altima midsize sedan, and Hyundai Motor Co <005380.KS will launch a new Sonata midsize car. All are popular marques that will be promoted heavily."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"Honda Senior Vice President Jeff Conrad said in Detroit on Friday he expected the Accord to sustain its current sales level, estimated at around 350,000 cars this year, despite the overall decline in sedan sales."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"""We think the addition of new product is going to make people stop and take a look"" at the sedan segment, Conrad said, in reference to the models hitting the market this fall.[nL4N1K13D4]"

Ford Motor,2017-7,"NEW YORK, July 14 (Reuters) - Growth fund managers who have long held shares in Tesla Inc said they were still confident in the electric car maker even after production problems sent the stock diving more than 15 percent from its all-time high."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"Fund managers from Janus Henderson, Baron, and Tanaka said they still believed in Tesla, whose pricey valuation and 51 percent gain for the year to date have made it a target of noted short-sellers such as Greenlight Capital's David Einhorn and Kynikos Associates' Jim Chanos."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"The stock tumbled from its record high of $386.99 after the company said July 3 that it had experienced production delays and delivered about 47,100 vehicles in the first half of the year, at the low end of its own forecasts. Tesla shares fell to $323.41 on Thursday."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"""This is not the first nor the last quarterly Tesla disappointment or miss,"" said David Chung, a portfolio manager at Denver-based Janus Henderson funds. ""I think longer-term investors like us recognize that we are still early in this sector and this is a truly special company and exceptional CEO."""
Ford Motor,2017-7,"Chung said the stock valuation remained reasonable based on his estimates of the company's 2020 fiscal year, in which its Model 3 sedan, now in production, will be fully ramped up."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"Chung said he expected the company would sometimes miss estimates sometimes, but Musk has earned the benefit of the doubt given the quality of existing models. The company is well on track to have a significant mass market presence within the next three years, Chung added."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"The first Model 3 rolled off Tesla's assembly line a few days ago, though the company has yet to announce when it will begin regular shipments of pre-ordered vehicles."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"Tesla investors have high hopes for the $35,000 sedan, the company's first foray into the mass market and a key indicator of whether its electric vehicles can become popular enough to displace established rivals like General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co ."
Ford Motor,2017-7,The company expects the Model 3 to help it deliver 6 times its annual volume and turn a profit.
Ford Motor,2017-7,"Yet the company has also been plagued by production delays that prompted it to miss previous forecasts, leading some analysts to cut their outlook."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"""We continue to be cautious relative to the potential for a slower than guided start to Model 3 assembly, and newly believe that the potential for Model3 pre-orders cancellations may increasingly become a point of investor concern,"" noted Ryan Brinkman, an analyst at JPMorgan, who has an underweight rating on the company and a $190 price target on its shares."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"Short sellers have targeted Tesla, which analysts expect to turn its first full-year profit in 2019. Approximately 17 percent of its shares are now being shorted, according to Thomson Reuters data, a level that has remained level throughout the year even as short sellers annual losses have topped $3.8 billion [L1N1I4170]."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"""In terms of conviction, they seem to be very strong because they are taking it on the chin and keep on going on,"" said Ihor Dusaniwsky, head of research at S3 Partners, a financial analytics firm in New York."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"Graham Tanaka, portfolio manager of the New York-based Tanaka Growth fund, said Tesla short sellers were not factoring in potential improvements and growth of the battery division. The company began production of Model 3 batteries at its Gigafactory in Nevada in January, which should reduce costs and improve the lifespan of batteries with greater scale of production, Tanaka said."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"""They're going to be making better batteries at a cheaper price than any of the competition,"" he said."

Ford Motor,2017-7,"NEW YORK, July 14 (Reuters) - Growth fund managers who have long held shares in Tesla Inc said they were still confident in the electric car maker even after production problems sent the stock diving more than 15 percent from its all-time high."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"Fund managers from Janus Henderson, Baron, and Tanaka said they still believed in Tesla, whose pricey valuation and 51 percent gain for the year to date have made it a target of noted short-sellers such as Greenlight Capital's David Einhorn and Kynikos Associates' Jim Chanos."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"The stock tumbled from its record high of $386.99 after the company said July 3 that it had experienced production delays and delivered about 47,100 vehicles in the first half of the year, at the low end of its own forecasts. Tesla shares fell to $323.41 on Thursday."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"""This is not the first nor the last quarterly Tesla disappointment or miss,"" said David Chung, a portfolio manager at Denver-based Janus Henderson funds. ""I think longer-term investors like us recognize that we are still early in this sector and this is a truly special company and exceptional CEO."""
Ford Motor,2017-7,"Chung said the stock valuation remained reasonable based on his estimates of the company's 2020 fiscal year, in which its Model 3 sedan, now in production, will be fully ramped up."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"Chung said he expected the company would sometimes miss estimates sometimes, but Musk has earned the benefit of the doubt given the quality of existing models. The company is well on track to have a significant mass market presence within the next three years, Chung added."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"The first Model 3 rolled off Tesla's assembly line a few days ago, though the company has yet to announce when it will begin regular shipments of pre-ordered vehicles."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"Tesla investors have high hopes for the $35,000 sedan, the company's first foray into the mass market and a key indicator of whether its electric vehicles can become popular enough to displace established rivals like General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co ."
Ford Motor,2017-7,The company expects the Model 3 to help it deliver 6 times its annual volume and turn a profit.
Ford Motor,2017-7,"Yet the company has also been plagued by production delays that prompted it to miss previous forecasts, leading some analysts to cut their outlook."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"""We continue to be cautious relative to the potential for a slower than guided start to Model 3 assembly, and newly believe that the potential for Model3 pre-orders cancellations may increasingly become a point of investor concern,"" noted Ryan Brinkman, an analyst at JPMorgan, who has an underweight rating on the company and a $190 price target on its shares."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"Short sellers have targeted Tesla, which analysts expect to turn its first full-year profit in 2019. Approximately 17 percent of its shares are now being shorted, according to Thomson Reuters data, a level that has remained level throughout the year even as short sellers annual losses have topped $3.8 billion [L1N1I4170]."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"""In terms of conviction, they seem to be very strong because they are taking it on the chin and keep on going on,"" said Ihor Dusaniwsky, head of research at S3 Partners, a financial analytics firm in New York."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"Graham Tanaka, portfolio manager of the New York-based Tanaka Growth fund, said Tesla short sellers were not factoring in potential improvements and growth of the battery division. The company began production of Model 3 batteries at its Gigafactory in Nevada in January, which should reduce costs and improve the lifespan of batteries with greater scale of production, Tanaka said."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"""They're going to be making better batteries at a cheaper price than any of the competition,"" he said."

Ford Motor,2017-7,"DETROIT, July 13 (Reuters) - Honda Motor Co Ltd <7267.T> on Friday will unveil its newest-generation Accord, one of four re-engineered midsize sedans that Asian automakers are betting on to win market share as Detroit automakers shift focus to SUVs, crossovers and pickup trucks."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"The new Accord, like rival Toyota Motor Corp's <7203.T> all-new Camry launching this month, is expected to offer major improvements in fuel economy, technology, styling and safety, according to Honda's U.S. dealers."
Ford Motor,2017-7,Honda declined to discuss details ahead of Friday's event in Detroit.
Ford Motor,2017-7,"The Accord and Camry are pillars of their manufacturers' U.S. businesses, each selling well over 300,000 vehicles a year. In the coming months, Nissan Motor Co Ltd <7201.T> is expected to launch a new Altima midsize sedan, and Hyundai Motor Co <005380.KS will launch a new Sonata midsize car. Both are popular marques that will be promoted heavily."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"""There has been no new news on the midsize sedan side for three years and we think this is a great opportunity to bring attention back to the segment,"" said Jack Hollis, Toyota's head of marketing for North America. [nL4N1K13D4]"
Ford Motor,2017-7,"Year to date, U.S. passenger car sales are down 11.4 percent and sales of midsize sedans are down 14.2 percent. Still, Americans bought 7.1 million sedans in 2016. With General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co cutting sedan production, and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV abandoning the segment, Honda and its Asian rivals could boost sales with updated models, dealers said."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"""They could take share from other brands, which is traditionally what happens when a new product is launched,"" said Pete DeLongchamps, vice president for manufacturer relations at Group 1 Automotive Inc , the third-largest U.S. auto dealer group."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"The Accord for years was Honda's top-selling model in the United States. Within the past year, U.S. sales of the Honda CR-V compact utility vehicle have eclipsed the aging Accord as Honda has expanded production capacity for the former. [nL1N1CI1GM]"
Ford Motor,2017-7,"The new Accord and Camry ""may stem the decline,"" said IHS Markit's Tom Libby. ""I don't think they will cause a marked reverse."""
Ford Motor,2017-7,"Improvements to the Accord should boost sales at Galpin Honda in San Fernando, California, general manager Ed Hartoonian said. The dealership sells about 500 Accords and Civics, combined, per month and Accord sales are up nearly 13 percent so far this year, he said."

Ford Motor,2017-7,{{20170713T181622.204+0000}}U.S. FCC approves new spectrum for vehicle radar systemsBy David Shepardson
Ford Motor,2017-7,"WASHINGTON, July 13 (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Communications Commission on Thursday approved allocating a larger consolidated block of spectrum for use by motor vehicle and aircraft radar systems to help avoid crashes."
Ford Motor,2017-7,The FCC first approved 1 GHz of spectrum in 1995 for motor vehicles to use radar that allowed for the introduction of collision avoidance and adaptive cruise control systems that are credited with preventing tens of thousands of crashes annually.
Ford Motor,2017-7,"Thursday's decision expands the band that vehicle radars can operate to 5 GHz of spectrum and will improve lane departure warning, blind spot detection systems, automatic braking and pedestrian detection, the FCC said."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"In 2016, some 20 automakers reached a voluntary agreement with U.S. auto safety regulators to make collision-avoiding braking systems standard equipment by 2022, a move that could eliminate 1 million crashes a year."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"FCC Chairman Ajit Pai said the agency was giving automakers ""the bandwidth needed"" to allow ""proven technologies that enable services like collision avoidance, blind spot monitoring, and lane change assistance"" and allow for ""new innovations."""
Ford Motor,2017-7,"Automakers will exit some other smaller portions of spectrum used for some radar systems as part of the expansion after 2022, the FCC said."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"The vote harmonizes vehicle spectrum with European rules that could allow automakers to bring technologies to the U.S. market faster, the FCC said."
Ford Motor,2017-7,The decision will also lead to improved aviation safety by boosting foreign object debris detection radars on airport runways and aircraft wingtip radars that can help avoid collisions with objects while moving on airport grounds.
Ford Motor,2017-7,"The move was prompted by a petition filed by German auto supplier Robert Bosch GmbH [ROBG.UL] in 2012. Continental AG said the expanded spectrum will allow for ""better range separation, range accuracy, angular accuracy, and reliable object discrimination."""
Ford Motor,2017-7,"FCC Commissioner Michael O'Rielly voted for the change but noted automakers were granted another block of spectrum in 1999 for vehicle-to-vehicle communications, but it has gone largely unused."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"In December, the U.S. Transportation Department proposed requiring future new cars and trucks to be able to ""talk"" to one another, but it has not been finalized."
Ford Motor,2017-7,Automakers are pursuing technologies to assist drivers in avoiding crashes while working on fully self-driving cars.
Ford Motor,2017-7,"U.S. traffic deaths jumped 8 percent in the first nine months of 2016, following a spike in 2015 when road deaths had their highest full-year increase since 1966. In 2015, total U.S. traffic crashes rose by 4 percent to 6.3 million."

Ford Motor,2017-7,"The associations, based in Europe, the United States, Japan and South Korea and representing around 70 percent of global car production, also called for the quotas to be postponed by at least one to three years, the magazine said on Thursday."

Ford Motor,2017-7,The number of credits per car is based on the level of electrification.
Ford Motor,2017-7,"According to WirtschaftsWoche, the industry associations are demanding that the Chinese government includes less harsh penalties for failing to reach the sales quota, and that it tailors the quota to each carmaker's production volume to avoid putting companies that make a smaller number of vehicles at a disadvantage."

Ford Motor,2017-7,The legislative action comes as major automakers are joining forces with auto suppliers and other groups to prod Congress into action.
Ford Motor,2017-7,"Last month, a U.S. House of Representatives Energy and Commerce subcommittee held a hearing on a Republican draft package of 14 bills that would allow U.S. regulators to exempt up to 100,000 vehicles a year per manufacturer from federal motor vehicle safety rules that prevent the sale of self-driving vehicles without human controls."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"Blair Ellis, a spokeswoman for the committee, said on Monday it was likely that legislation would be introduced this week and a formal hearing on the bills would occur next week."
Ford Motor,2017-7,Republican U.S. Representative Robert Latta said last month he hoped to win committee approval of a bipartisan legislative package by the end of July.
Ford Motor,2017-7,The draft measures would bar states from setting self-driving rules and prevent the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration from pre-approving self-driving car technologies.

Ford Motor,2017-7,"CARLETON, Mich., July 7 (Reuters) - Two lanes apart at a noisy, fast-paced auto auction near Detroit, two vehicles show why major U.S. automakers have a problem with used cars."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"In one lane of the Manheim auction facility, a black 2015 Chevy Malibu sedan with barely 20,000 miles on it sold for just over $13,000, less than half its original sticker price. In the other lane, a white 2013 Chevy Silverado pick-up truck sold for $11,500 - despite having 200,000 miles on the odometer."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"America's renewed lust for new SUVs and trucks instead of smaller cars is already hurting major auto companies, which posted their fourth consecutive month of declining new vehicle sales.[nL1N1JU104]"
Ford Motor,2017-7,"But millions cars that were leased two or three years ago, many of them used compact and midsized cars with low mileage, are heading toward auction lots and used car dealerships."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"That surge in supply threatens to depress prices for new and used vehicles, raising the risk of losses for automakers and finance companies on lease deals. It also undercuts the value of cars customers want to trade in for a new vehicle. [nL1N1I40JA]"
Ford Motor,2017-7,"So major carmakers, including General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co , are aligning with auto auction houses with aggressive moves to make sure they are getting the best prices for their vehicles. Such maneuvers include transporting the automobiles to where the greater demand is based on real-time pricing data, spending more to spruce up used cars and slowing the pace which leased cars get moved to used car lots or auction houses."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"Auto auction houses such as Manheim in southeastern Michigan are where the romance of new car marketing goes to die. The dominant player in the U.S. auction market along with rival KAR Auction Services Inc , Manheim treats vehicles like commodities, grading them on a fine-tuned scale from one (poor) to five (excellent) that provides dealers with certainty and transparency."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"""If a dealer sees a 2015 Ford Fusion with a rating of 4.3, they know what to pay for it and what they can sell it for,"" said Matt Trapp, a Manheim vice president on a tour of the auction, scanning tags on vehicles with his smartphone to pull up a multitude of transactions for that make, model, year, condition and mileage."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"""If you don't want to overbid on this one, wait a minute and another will be right along,"" he said."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"Increasingly, the auction houses and automakers are collaborating to try to raise the scores, and the prices, of vehicles running through auctions. Auction houses have offered add-on reconditioning services on used vehicles for decades, but after the lean years following the Great Recession, demand is rising for those higher-margin services."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"Manheim's chief economist Jonathan Smoke says ""we can help determine the optimal way to sell their vehicle, which includes location, timing,"" the level of reconditioning and whether to opt for a physical auction or online auction. Online auctions account for 30 percent of sales at Manheim versus 10 percent three years ago, he added."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"Armed with detailed, real-time pricing data that was not available during the last downturn, auctioneers can now help automakers figure out where a used car could fetch the best price."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"Manheim has an expanded logistics arm that can aggregate cars for transport to the place they'll fetch the highest price at auction, or arrange their sale before they even move."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"Jason Ferreri, KAR's executive vice president of online services, said this is happening ""significantly more often."""
Ford Motor,2017-7,"Neither he nor Manheim officials would give specifics. In April, KAR agreed to buy DRIVIN, a data aggregator that matches vehicle inventory to dealer demand, whose founders include Brad Keywell and Eric Lefkofsky, the co-founders of Groupon Inc , for $43 million in stock. [nL1N1HR0D3]"
Ford Motor,2017-7,Ferreri said the deal was in response to automakers' demands for greater data services amid the influx of off-lease vehicles. This real-time pricing data helps the companies steer the used cars toward higher demand.
Ford Motor,2017-7,"For example, the national price for a 2015 Chevrolet Malibu with average mileage the week of June 11 was $15,514, according to data compiled for Reuters by car-shopping website CarGurus."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"In Memphis, that Malibu cost nearly 9 percent above the national average fair price, but in Miami it would sell for more than 9 percent below that price, representing a difference of $2,700."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"Manheim's Matt Trapp, whose territory includes the U.S. northeast, says around 40 percent of vehicles coming off leases are returned to dealers within around five hours' drive of New York City. Many are now being shipped to other regions."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"In New Jersey, for instance, one in three off-lease vehicles now leaves the state, Trapp says."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"""I am not seeing a glut of used cars hitting the market,"" said Mike Gentry, who buys cars for 20 dealerships in northwest Ohio and attended the Manheim auction outside Detroit. ""Automakers have set a floor for pricing and when they can't get that price they ship them 500 miles to where they can get a better price."""
Ford Motor,2017-7,"GM spokesman Jim Cain said the company is relying on ""a lot more tools"" including certified pre-owned vehicles ""to support resale values."" A Ford spokesman said the company has adopted a ""disciplined approach"" to maintaining used car values."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"Those tools include slowing the flow of vehicles to the used market, which they can afford in the short term as their balance sheets are strong."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"""With off-lease vehicles we are not seeing all of them coming to market, some of them are being held back,"" National Automobile Dealers Association chief economist Steven Szakaly told reporters on a conference call on Thursday."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"Automakers also allow their franchised dealers to take first pick of vehicles just coming off a lease before they go to auction. These are usually sold as ""certified pre-owned"" cars that come with a factory warranty, and a higher price tag than a run-of-the-mill used car."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"For vehicles that have suffered wear and tear, auction houses are now preparing for what Manheim's Mandy Savage calls a ""tsunami"" that will hit the market in the coming years."

Ford Motor,2017-7,"Automakers in Brazil produced 212,300 new cars and trucks last month, while sales totaled 195,000 vehicles, according to data released by industry group Anfavea."

Ford Motor,2017-7,"July 6 (Reuters) - The number of planned layoffs at U.S. firms fell in June to its lowest level of the year as employers opted to hold onto existing jobs in a tight labor market where skilled laborers are harder to find, a report released on Thursday showed."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"U.S. companies announced 31,105 planned job cuts in June, a 6.0 percent decline from 33,092 in May, according to outplacement consultancy firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas Inc."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"The previous month's figure was downwardly revised from 51,692 after Ford Motor Co reported it would cut 1,400 workers, not 20,000, as initially reported."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"Overall, June's job cuts were down 19.3 percent from a year earlier, when 38,536 layoffs were announced in June 2016."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"""Some companies are not making their layoffs this year, which they might have done if the labor pool wasn't so stretched, especially for skilled labor,"" John Challenger, chief executive officer of Challenger, Gray and Christmas, told Reuters."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"With the unemployment rate at 4.3 percent, its lowest since May 2001, employers are having a harder time finding the talent they need so they keep existing workers, Challenger said."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"The slowdown in layoff activity in June is reflected in the year-to-date totals as well, with the number of planned workforce reductions falling by 28 percent to 227,000 in the first six months of 2017 from more than 313,000 in the first half of 2016."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"The technology sector, for instance, reported 23,813 job cuts for the first six months of the year, down 52.5 percent from 50,161 announced in the first half of 2016."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"One notable exception is in the retail sector, where announced layoffs in the first half of 2016 are the highest since the recession as big chains such as Macy's Inc close stores and companies restructure to focus on online sales."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"The sector had announced 60,127 job cuts through June, a 42 percent increase from the 42,095 cuts reported through the first half of 2016. This represents the highest number of layoffs in the first half since 2009, according to Challenger."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"Though the retail sector reported over 5,000 store closings this year, the worst of the layoffs may be behind. Challenger said retailers typically trim their staff in the first quarter after the holiday season before they start to expand again."

Ford Motor,2017-7,"SEOUL, July 6 (Reuters) - U.S. auto imports from the likes of General Motors and Ford Motor must become more chic, affordable or fuel-efficient to reap the rewards of President Donald Trump's attempts to renegotiate a trade deal with key ally South Korea, officials and industry experts in Seoul say."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"Meeting South Korean President Moon Jae-in last week in Washington, Trump said the United States would do more to address trade imbalances with South Korea and create a level playing ground for U.S. businesses, especially carmakers, in the world's 11th largest auto market by sales. [nL1N1JR0T2]"
Ford Motor,2017-7,"While imports from automakers including Ford, Chrysler and GM more than doubled last year largely thanks to free trade deal which took effect in 2012, sales account for just 1 percent of a market dominated by more affordable models from local giants Hyundai Motor Co <005380.KS> and affiliate Kia Motors Corp <000270.KS>."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"Imports make up just 15 percent of the overall Korean auto market, and are mainly more luxurious models from German automakers BMW and Daimler AG's Mercedes-Benz, which also benefit from a trade deal with the European Union."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"""Addressing non-tariff barriers would not fundamentally raise the competitiveness of U.S. cars,"" a senior Korean government official told Reuters, declining to be identified because of the sensitivity of the subject."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"""What we really want to say to the United States is: make good cars, make cars that Korean consumers like."""
Ford Motor,2017-7,"In Korea, U.S. imports are seen as lagging German brands in brand image, sophistication and fuel economy, industry experts say. U.S. imports do have a competitive advantage in electric cars: Tesla Motors' electric vehicles are seen as both environmentally friendly and trendy, while GM has launched a long-range Bolt EV."
Ford Motor,2017-7,U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross had cited a quota in the current trade deal as an obstacle to boosting imports.
Ford Motor,2017-7,"The quota allows U.S. automakers to bring in each year 25,000 vehicles that meet U.S., not necessarily Korean, safety standards. Should GM, for example, decide to bring in more than its quota of one model - the Impala sedans - it would cost up to $75 million to modify the cars to meet Korean safety standards, the company told its local labour union."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"Asked about non-tariff barriers, a spokesman at GM's Korean unit said removing them could expand the range of models the company can bring in from the United States."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"No U.S. company, however, has yet to make full use of the quota, industry data shows. GM, the most popular U.S. brand, sold only 13,150 U.S.-made vehicles last year."
Ford Motor,2017-7,"U.S. cars could also see the benefits of a renegotiated trade deal at a time when diesel-powered cars offered by Volkswagen's are losing appeal following cheating on emissions tests. However, they still need to appeal to the locals, experts say."

Ford Motor,2017-7,"What's at stake is a piece of the $37-billion cockpit electronics market, estimated by research firm IHS Markit to nearly double to $62 billion by 2022.
