Ford Motor,2017-10,{{20171027T220151.818+0000}}U.S. wants to remove 'unnecessary' barriers to self-driving vehiclesBy David Shepardson
Ford Motor,2017-10,"WASHINGTON, Oct 27 (Reuters) - The U.S. National Highway Traffic-Safety Administration said Friday it is looking for input on how it can remove regulatory roadblocks to self-driving cars."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"The auto safety agency said in a report that it wants to find any ""unnecessary regulatory barriers"" to self-driving cars ""particularly those that are not equipped with controls for a human driver."""
Ford Motor,2017-10,"The agency also wants comments on what research it needs to conduct before deciding whether to eliminate or rewrite regulations. But it could take the agency years to complete the research and finalize rule changes, and advocates are pushing Congress to act."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"NHTSA said in a statement it plans to issue a formal notice in the ""near future requesting comment"" on the hurdles. The agency hopes to make the notice public by the end of November."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"Automakers must meet nearly 75 auto safety standards, many of which were written with the assumption that a licensed driver will be in control of the vehicle. The agency said last year that current regulations pose ""significant"" regulatory hurdles to vehicles without human controls."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"In early October, a U.S. Senate committee unanimously gave the green light to a bill aimed at speeding the use of self-driving cars without human controls and would allow the agency to waive requirements."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"General Motors Co , Alphabet Inc , Ford Motor Co and others have lobbied for the landmark legislation, while auto safety groups urged more safeguards and have pledged to keep fighting for changes."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"The Senate Commerce Committee approved the bill, and the U.S. House passed a similar measure last month. Automakers would be able to win exemptions from NHTSA for safety rules for up to 80,000 vehicles annually within three years."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"Under the Senate measure, NHTSA would have to write permanent rules on self-driving cars within a decade."

Ford Motor,2017-10,"DETROIT, Oct 27 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co's Argo AI unit, which develops software for self-driving vehicles, is buying Princeton Lightwave, one of the oldest makers of lidar sensing devices that use laser light to help autonomous cars ""see"" nearby objects and obstacles."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"Announcing the Princeton Lightwave acquisition in a blog post on Friday morning, Argo Chief Executive Officer Bryan Salesky said his company ""won't be able to build"" self-driving cars without lidar."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"Argo wants to develop ""affordable"" lidar sensors with Princeton's help, he added."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"The deal comes more than a year after Ford's $75 million investment in Velodyne, a better-known lidar startup whose sensor technology is still considered too expensive. [nL1N1AX0P0]"
Ford Motor,2017-10,Argo did not disclose terms of the Princeton Lightwave deal.
Ford Motor,2017-10,"Founded in 2000, New Jersey-based Princeton Lightwave is one of more than 20 global manufacturers of lidar."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"Private and corporate investors have poured more than $700 million into startups developing lidar systems for self-driving cars, according to a Reuters analysis of publicly available investment data."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"Princeton Lightwave is one of at least four of those startups to be acquired in the past two years. Others include Tyto Lidar, a small San Francisco Bay area company purchased by Uber Technologies [UBER.UL] in 2016, and Pasadena, California-based Strobe Inc, which General Motors Co bought earlier this month. [nL2N1MK0HR]"

Ford Motor,2017-10,"{{20171027T142557.464+0000}}UPDATE 1-U.S. probes Ford Fusion cars over steering wheels that may detach(Adds Ford statement, earlier GM recalls for similar issues, background on recent Ford recall costs)"
Ford Motor,2017-10,"WASHINGTON, Oct 27 (Reuters) - The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said Friday it was opening a preliminary investigation into 841,000 Ford Motor Co vehicles over concerns the steering wheels may get detached while the cars are in motion."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"The auto safety agency said it was investigating 2014-2016 model Ford Fusion cars after three reports of steering wheel bolts becoming loose, including one completely detaching as a driver attempted to turn into a gas station."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"Ford said in an emailed statement Friday it was cooperating ""with the agency on its investigation, as we always do."""
Ford Motor,2017-10,"In 2011, General Motors Co in 2011 recalled 2,100 Cruze cars because the steering wheel could detach. GM also issued a separate recall for about 150 Buick Encore SUVs in 2013 to address steering wheels that could come off."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"Last week, Ford said it was recalling 1.34 million 2015-17 Ford F-150 and 2017 Ford Super Duty trucks in North America to add water shields to side door latches at a cost of $267 million. The recall came after authorities in Canada asked Ford for answers in March after four reports of doors opening while people were driving."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"Ford has now recalled more than 5 million vehicles for varying door latch-related issues since 2016, but the company said the issue in last week's door-latch recall was different from prior ones."
Ford Motor,2017-10,The company has previously disclosed plans to spend $935 million on other recalls announced since August 2016.

Ford Motor,2017-10,{{20171027T122013.380+0000}}INTERVIEW-Top Thai auto parts maker looks overseas as home market slowsBy Chayut Setboonsarng
Ford Motor,2017-10,"BANGKOK, Oct 27 (Reuters) - Thailand's biggest auto parts maker Thai Summit Group is looking to a pick-up in revenues from abroad as its domestic market slows, a senior company official told Reuters on Friday."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"""We are quite pessimistic about the Thai domestic (automobile) market,"" executive vice president Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit said in an interview."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"""It's growing only at about 3-5 percent"" due to high consumer debt and political uncertainty, he added."
Ford Motor,2017-10,Thanathorn is the son of company president and chief executive Somporn Juangroongruangkit.
Ford Motor,2017-10,"Foreign sources of revenue currently account for 18-20 percent of Thai Summit's sales, but it expects that ratio to reach 30 percent in 3-5 years, with plants in the United States, India and South Africa driving growth. This year, Thai Summit expects total revenue of 79 billion baht ($2.4 billion)."
Ford Motor,2017-10,Thanathorn said the privately-held company was looking to take advantage of the similarity in vehicles produced in Thailand and South Africa.
Ford Motor,2017-10,"""Car makers usually import parts from Thailand to assemble cars in South Africa,"" he said. Local operators and the South African government want to source more parts domestically, so Thai Summit's strategy is to preempt this, he added."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"The company will begin next year by renting a factory for light manufacturing and eventually build factories for heavier equipment by 2021, spending approximately $100-150 million."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"SUVs, pick-up trucks and derivatives made in South Africa also receive tax benefits when exported to Europe thanks to a trade agreement, Thanathorn said, adding the country was a window to other African markets as well in the long run."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"Currently, the United States accounts for over half of Thai Summit's overseas revenue. Its plants in Michigan and Kentucky are expected to bring in $500 million next year. The company is aiming for U.S. revenue to reach $1 billion within five years."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"Revenue from plants in India, meanwhile, is doubling each year, but from a low base of 1.5 billion baht."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"Anticipating future trends in the automotive industry, Thai Summit has spent over 400 million baht on testing centres and research and development of lightweight technology."
Ford Motor,2017-10,Thanathorn said the company was producing an aluminium chassis for U.S. electric carmaker Tesla Inc.
Ford Motor,2017-10,"Despite a weak domestic market, Thai auto exports are doing well, the executive said."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"""Thai auto exports grow with the global economy,"" he said, adding a reduction in foreign investment into the country was due to weak demand rather than any loss of competitiveness."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"""Cambodia, Vietnam and Myanmar do not have the capacity to pull investment away from Thailand,"" Thanathorn said, adding any investment from auto companies in Indonesia and the Philippines would be for market access rather than export capacity."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"Thailand is the world's 13th largest auto exporter, selling over 60 percent of vehicles produced or 1.18 million in total last year. Auto exports account for about 10 percent of the economy and in September reached a two-year high. [nL4N1MT1ZG]"
Ford Motor,2017-10,"Thailand was dubbed the ""Detroit of the East"" after foreign automakers, particularly Japanese companies like Toyota Motor <7203.T>, Honda Motor <7267.T> and Isuzu <7202.T> set up shop in the 1980s, while Ford , Chrysler and General Motors chose the country mainly to manufacture one-tonne pickup trucks."

Ford Motor,2017-10,{{20171027T074825.808+0000}}AUTOSHOW-Special delivery: Automakers make plug for electric vans* Take-up of electric delivery vehicles seen faster than for cars
Ford Motor,2017-10,"TOKYO, Oct 27 (Reuters) - In the rush towards electric vehicles, automakers are increasingly sparing a thought for the humble delivery van, an often overlooked segment with big growth potential given tightening pollution restrictions in urban areas."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"Given lingering consumer concerns about cost and charging infrastructure, many in the industry expect it will take at least a decade for electric vehicles (EVs) to win over mainstream car owners."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"But as e-commerce begins to dominate the retail sector and cities clamp down on pollution, more vehicle makers see opportunities for faster take-up of EVs as delivery vehicles, taxis and other business uses in dense, urban areas."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"At the Tokyo Motor Show which opened to the public on Friday, Nissan Motor Co <7201.T>, an early embracer of EV technology and maker of the Leaf, the world's top-selling electric car, unveiled a concept model of its e-NV200 electric van with refrigeration capabilities, designed to transport chilled food to restaurants and homes."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"""Imagine if you have city access challenges, how will you get food delivered to restaurants, and goods to customers?"" said Ashwani Gupta, head of the light commercial business at the automaking alliance of Nissan and France's Renault SA ."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"Nissan plans to launch the refrigeration model in Japan next year, Gupta said. Both Nissan and Renault already market electric vans in Europe."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"Nissan is also looking to introduce the e-NV200 series in China in the near term as it expects demand will ""explode"" as big cities in the country effectively ban gasoline and diesel trucks and vans in an effort to crack down on emissions."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"At the moment, the country's electric light commercial vehicle market has yet to be tapped by major foreign automakers, although Ford Motor Co wants to drive its truck-making China partner Jiangling Motors Corp (JMC) <000550.SZ> more towards electric commercial vans. [nL4N1ME2KZ]"
Ford Motor,2017-10,"Mitsubishi Fuso Truck and Bus Corporation, majority owned by Germany's Daimler AG , has also begun selling its eCanter electric light-duty truck in the United States, Europe and Japan, where it targets transport delivery services and convenient stores."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"As increases demand for e-commerce creates more work for delivery services, Toyota Auto Body, a wholly owned subsidiary of Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T>, was thinking about the harried delivery van driver when it designed its LCV D-Cargo concept model."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"""We set out to make the delivery truck more comfortable for drivers,"" said Ichiro Mukai, who worked on the model's design."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"""In the past home deliveries mainly centred around larger parcels, but recently, a big increase in the number of deliveries has come just as people are getting smaller parcels delivered,"" he said, adding that this had increased the workload of drivers."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"The model's futuristic design is based on Toyota's gasoline-hybrid minivan models marketed in Japan, and can be adapted to operate as an all-battery electric."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"Removing the passenger seat entirely, the driver's seat configuration - which includes a retractable steering wheel and rounded seat corners - is designed to enable drivers to get in and out of the vehicle more quickly and easily."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"A removable tablet device in the centre of the steering wheel enables drivers to easily locate parcels in the hold, where track shelving units and a wider door opening allows for easy access to parcels from outside the vehicle."

Ford Motor,2017-10,"{{20171027T050002.872+0000}}ANALYSIS-Wall Street loves electric cars, America loves trucksBy Paul Lienert and Joseph White"
Ford Motor,2017-10,"DETROIT, Oct 27 (Reuters) - Wall Street may love the shares of Silicon Valley electric carmaker Tesla Inc , but Americans love big, fuel-thirsty trucks like Ford Motor Co's bestselling F-Series pickups and are paying ever higher prices to buy them."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"The auto industry is at a crossroads, with the future of legacy automakers like Ford, General Motors Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV uncertain as governments float proposals to ban internal combustion engines over the next two decades."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"But in the present, consumer enthusiasm for trucks and sport utility vehicles is strong, especially in the United States. And that is providing Ford, GM and other established automakers with billions in cash to mount a challenge to Tesla."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"Tesla has ambitions to boost annual sales to 500,000 vehicles a year. But it is wrestling with the sort of production problems that old-line automakers have largely put behind them, and has reported a net loss of $666.7 million through the first six months of 2017. Analysts expect the company to post a third quarter net loss of $380.4 million when it reports results next Wednesday. [nL2N1N02OM]"
Ford Motor,2017-10,"Electric cars are money losers, which explains why global automakers have been slow to roll them out until now. But regulatory and consumer pressures are forcing established automakers to put more electric vehicles in their fleets over the next several years. In a cash-intensive industry, profits from pickups and SUVs may give them a competitive edge."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"Ford said on Thursday that the average price of one of its F-series pickups rose $2,800 to an average $45,400 a truck in the third quarter. Sales of F-series trucks, which range from spartan work trucks to Platinum models with the features - and price tags - of a European luxury sedan, were up nearly 11 percent to 658,636 vehicles for the first nine months of this year."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"GM has driven its share price up nearly 30 percent so far in 2017 as Chief Executive Mary Barra has talked up plans for putting self-driving, electric Chevrolet Bolts into ride services fleets within a few quarters."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"Barra told investors on Tuesday improved profit margins on trucks were ""one of the big drivers of the overall 8.3 percent margins"" in the automaker's North American business during the latest quarter."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"GM has forecast free cash flow for the full year of roughly $6 billion. That is $1 billion less than forecast earlier this year, but strong enough to fund the company's promise to develop 20 more electric vehicles by 2023 and send $7 billion back to shareholders. [nL2N1MD1YS]"
Ford Motor,2017-10,"GM, which emerged from a government funded bankruptcy eight years ago, now has $31.4 billion in available funds, including $17.3 billion in cash."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"Ford lags behind GM in sales of battery electric models, but the company has said it will spend $5 billion developing battery electric and hybrid models. Ford's new Chief Executive Officer Jim Hackett has said the plans include shifting $500 million into electric vehicle development from internal combustion projects. [nL4N1ME3GX]"
Ford Motor,2017-10,"Ford's share price has been flat for the year as the No. 2 U.S. automaker ushered out former CEO Mark Fields. Still, it had $28 billion in cash and marketable securities as of Sept. 30."
Ford Motor,2017-10,Automakers also are becoming more confident they can make money on electric cars as battery costs come down.
Ford Motor,2017-10,"Volkswagen AG's Audi brand is gearing up a fleet of electric models that the company expects will account for 25 percent of sales by 2025. In the United States, Audi plans to launch an electric SUV ""in the sweet spot of the market"" in 2019, Scott Keogh, head of Audi's U.S. operations, told Reuters on Thursday."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"Sales of Audi's current lineup of SUVs ""pay for what we want to do, which is lead the future,"" Keogh said."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"Renault SA Chief Executive Carlos Ghosn expressed confidence earlier this month that electric cars will become ""a significant contributor to our performance."" [nL8N1MH0QX]"
Ford Motor,2017-10,"Tesla, by comparison to its legacy rivals, is market value rich, and cash poor. It had $3 billion in cash on hand at the end of the second quarter, and some analysts predict the automaker will have to raise more to cover the expected cash drain from the slow launch of the Model 3, which is lower priced than other Teslas and aimed at the market for $35,000 to $45,000 cars."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk has outlined ambitious plans to expand its network of factories and service facilities, including potentially an assembly plant in China and up to three more electric battery Gigafactories. He told investors in July the company could sell more shares to fund that expansion."

Ford Motor,2017-10,"DETROIT, Oct 26 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co reported a better-than-expected quarterly net profit on Thursday, driven largely by U.S. sales of its high-margin pickup trucks, and said it would begin to test self-driving cars in some cities next year."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"A large part of the company's profits came from its F-Series pickup trucks, which have been the best-selling vehicle in North America for decades. Ford said the average transaction price for its trucks rose $2,800 to $45,400."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"The company redesigned its larger F-series Super Duty pickups a year ago, and recently updated its standard F-150 trucks for model year 2018."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"Ford said its North American margin rose to 8.1 percent from 5.8 percent a year earlier. Earlier this week, GM reported a third-quarter margin for North America of 8.3 percent. [nL2N1MZ0FE]"
Ford Motor,2017-10,"Ford plans to begin testing self-driving vehicles in some cities in 2018, Chief Executive Officer Jim Hackett disclosed on an earnings call with analysts on Thursday, but gave no details."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"Ford also is developing new business partnerships with unnamed companies to use its self-driving vehicles in commercial applications other than ride hailing, Hackett said. He declined to confirm whether Ford still planned to put those vehicles into service by 2021, executives have said."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"Rival General Motors Co said in recent weeks it plans to accelerate the commercial application of its self-driving Chevrolet Bolts, some of which could be in operation before 2020. GM also plans to introduce 20 electric vehicles by 2023."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"Year to date, GM's stock is up nearly 30 percent, while Ford is down almost 1 percent. In mid-morning trade, Ford was up 0.3 percent to $12.08."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"Wall Street has been underwhelmed by Ford, particularly by Hackett's caveat that most of the company's $14 billion in planned cost savings will not show up on Ford's bottom line until 2019 and 2020. [nL4N1ME3GX]"
Ford Motor,2017-10,"When asked by reporters about the flagging stock, Chief Financial Officer Bob Shanks said Ford has a ""really good plan"" for electric vehicles and self-driving car technology."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"On the earnings call on Thursday, Shanks said Ford will ""aggressively restructure the business as required to achieve our objectives ... We are prepared to do what we have to do."" He did not provide details."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"Apart from North America, the only other region that was profitable for Ford was Asia Pacific, where a record profit was driven by sales increases outside China. CFO Shanks said sales volumes, market share and margins were all down in China."
Ford Motor,2017-10,He said Ford's European operations would return to profitability in the fourth quarter and for the full year.
Ford Motor,2017-10,"Ford said it had lower engineering, advertising and promotion expenses than in the third quarter."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"The second largest U.S. automaker posted a quarterly net profit of $1.56 billion, or 39 cents per share, up more than 60 percent from $960 million, or 24 cents, a year earlier."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"Excluding one-time items, Ford reported earnings per share of 43 cents, above Wall Street expectations of 32 cents."
Ford Motor,2017-10,Ford said it now expects full-year earnings in a range of $1.75 to $1.85 per share. Previously it had looked for $1.65 to $1.85.

Ford Motor,2017-10,"WASHINGTON, Oct 26 (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc's self-driving car unit Waymo is expanding winter testing as it works to address a potential blind spot for autonomous vehicles: snowy and icy conditions."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"Waymo said Thursday that Michigan is the sixth state where the self-driving car project will test autonomous vehicles. The company chose the state to see how vehicles will respond in snow, sleet, and ice."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"Waymo has been testing vehicles in Texas, Arizona, Washington State, Nevada and California and starts in Michigan next week on public roads with a backup safety driver sitting in the driver seat if necessary."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"""For human drivers, the mix of winter conditions affects how well you can see and the way your vehicle handles the road. The same is true for self-driving cars,"" said Waymo chief executive John Krafcik in a blog post. ""Our ultimate goal is for our fully self-driving cars to operate safely and smoothly in all kinds of environments."""
Ford Motor,2017-10,"Waymo said it has conducted cold weather testing since 2012, including some around the Nevada and California border of Lake Tahoe, but the new testing in Metro Detroit may pose tougher challenges navigating snow slicked or icy roads crowded with commuters."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"Waymo opened a development center in Novi, Michigan in May 2016, working with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV to integrate Waymo's self-driving technology into Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid minivans."
Ford Motor,2017-10,The new winter testing is in the back yard of Detroit's Big Three automakers. U.S. automakers have touted plans to get self-driving cars on the roads.
Ford Motor,2017-10,"General Motors Co chief executive Mary Barra said Tuesday the Detroit automaker is working hard on self-driving cars and expects to deploy cars without backup drivers in ""quarters not years."""
Ford Motor,2017-10,"Waymo has been mapping areas in Metro Detroit and wants to assess how its sensors perform in wet, cold conditions. One hurdle is self-driving car mapping software may have challenges in winter weather."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"One challenge for Waymo may be human drivers. Many self-driving vehicles from numerous companies have been struck by inattentive or careless drivers in California, according to reports to filed with the state."

Ford Motor,2017-10,{{20171023T020718.326+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-Tesla could hit second gear with Shanghai factory(The authors are Reuters Breakingviews columnists. The opinions expressed are their own.)
Ford Motor,2017-10,"NEW YORK/WASHINGTON, Oct 23 (Reuters Breakingviews) - A factory in Shanghai could help Tesla shift into second gear. It would give Elon Musk's $58 billion electric-car company a better shot at catching up to or keeping pace with rivals in the fast-growing market. Any deal, though, is apt to have some roadblocks."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"China presents a large but perplexing opportunity for all foreign automakers. The country is now the biggest market for passenger cars. Though growth has been slowing, sales increased 3.3 percent in September from a year ago. Worsening air quality, however, has prompted Beijing to consider a possible ban on gasoline-only cars."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"Many customers for now prefer gas-guzzling SUVs. And there are plenty of domestic competitors developing battery technology, such as Anhui Zotye Automobile <000980.SZ>, which recently struck an alliance with Ford . Tesla, for all its U.S. hype, has just around a 3 percent share of China's electric-vehicle market. It faces competition from Volvo , which is scrapping petrol-only vehicles from 2019, Daimler and General Motors ."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"There are nagging problems at home, too. Tesla produced just 260 of its new Model 3s in the third quarter, far short of the more than 1,500 that were targeted. Musk talked of ""production hell"" on the road to building half a million vehicles next year, or roughly five times as many as the company is likely to manage in 2017. A factory in China should in theory alleviate some of the strain, while reducing costs and customer wait times."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"The manufacturing facility deal reported by the Wall Street Journal on Sunday would not alleviate a core problem, however. Cars produced in a factory wholly owned and located within Shanghai's free trade zone probably will be subject to the country's 25 percent import tax."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"The only way to evade the levy would be a joint venture with a Chinese partner. Tesla, an unprofitable enterprise currently valued at 30 times expected EBITDA for the next year, so far has been reluctant to tie such a knot because of legitimate concerns about technology transfer. And yet it's hard to imagine how its mass-market models can be competitive in China with the tariff included. As useful as a local factory would be, it may give Tesla limited acceleration."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"- Tesla has reached an agreement with Shanghai officials to set up a manufacturing facility in the city's free trade zone, according a Wall Street Journal report published on Oct. 22, citing unnamed sources."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"- The electric-car company said in June that it would ""clearly define"" its production plans in China by the end of the year. According to the news report, Tesla would likely still face 25 percent import duties on its factory-produced cars sold in China."

Ford Motor,2017-10,"DETROIT, Oct 19 (Reuters) - New technology to stream music into dashboards or boost fuel efficiency is making cars less reliable, although electric cars such as the Tesla Model 3 and the Chevrolet Bolt should fare better than many conventional models, Consumer Reports magazine said on Thursday."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"The magazine said its survey of 640,000 vehicles showed that all-new vehicles or models with newly updated technology are more likely than older models to have a ""wonky engine, a jerky transmission, or high-tech features that fail outright."""
Ford Motor,2017-10,"Electric cars do away with many of the mechanical systems that prompt consumer complaints about conventional cars, the magazine said. Tesla Inc's Model 3, despite recent production problems, should have ""average"" reliability because it relies on technology already used on the older Tesla Model S, Jake Fisher, the magazine's head of automotive testing said on Thursday at a meeting of the Detroit Automotive Press Association."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"The Bolt is the most reliable car in General Motors Co's Chevrolet brand, he said."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"Tesla in a statement on Thursday criticized Consumer Reports because it previously declared the Model S ""to be the best car ever and then revoked the rating after being questioned by Tesla skeptics."" As for the Model 3, Tesla said ""it's important to note that Consumer Reports has not yet driven a Model 3, let alone do they know anything substantial about how the Model 3 was designed and engineered."""
Ford Motor,2017-10,"The magazine's annual survey of new vehicle reliability predicts which cars will give owners fewer or more problems than their competitors, based on data collected. Its scorecard is influential among consumers and industry executives."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"For the fifth straight year, Japanese automaker Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T> placed first in the magazine's ranking with the most reliable vehicles on average. General Motors Co's Cadillac brand was last among 27 brands ranked. Tesla ranked 21st on the list."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"With many new cars, customers complain about problems with continuously variable transmissions and eight- and nine-speed gear boxes designed to boost fuel mileage, Fisher said."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"Hard to use infotainment systems also continue to annoy customers, Fisher said. But over-the-air updates are helping automakers alleviate problems more quickly, he said."

Ford Motor,2017-10,"The magazine's prediction that the Tesla Model 3, which has faced production bottlenecks, will have average reliability illustrates the challenges automakers face."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"The Model 3 is the luxury electric vehicle maker's newest car, and Consumer Reports said it had no data on the vehicle. But it relies largely on technology the carmaker has used on its Model S sedan, which has been in production since 2012, and Consumer Reports said predicted reliability for that car is now ""above average."""
Ford Motor,2017-10,"""Electric vehicles are inherently less complicated than gasoline or hybrid alternatives. The Model 3 is the least complicated Tesla yet,"" Consumer Reports said."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"With many new cars, customers complain about problems with continuously variable transmissions and eight- and nine-speed gear boxes designed to boost fuel mileage, the magazine said."
Ford Motor,2017-10,Hard to use infotainment systems also continue to annoy customers. Consumer Reports said its survey found that owners of models in the first year of production reported twice as many complaints about vehicle electronics.
Ford Motor,2017-10,"""More often than not, our data suggests it's prudent for consumers to wait for the technology to mature,"" Jake Fisher, head of Consumer Reports auto testing, said in a statement ahead of a presentation in Detroit."

After Korean automaker Hyundai Motor Co <005380.KS> got hit with complaints about the transmission on its 2016 Hyundai Tucson sport utility vehicle, the company took action that reduced complaints about the 2017 model by more than half, Consumer Reports said."

Ford Motor,2017-10,"WASHINGTON, Oct 18 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co said on Wednesday it would recall 1.34 million 2015-17 Ford F-150 and 2017 Ford Super Duty trucks in North America to add water shields to side door latches at a cost of $267 million."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"The No.2 U.S. automaker said the safety recall is due to a frozen door latch or a bent or kinked actuation cable in the affected vehicles, that may result in a door not opening or closing."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"A Ford spokeswoman, Elizabeth Weigandt, said customers would be notified next month but did not have a timetable for when parts will be available. Dealers will install water shields over the door latches and inspect and repair door latch cables if needed."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"Ford has now recalled more than 5 million vehicles for varying door latch-related issues since 2016, but the company said the issue in the new recall is different from prior ones."
Ford Motor,2017-10,The company in November 2016 sent a bulletin to dealers that warned some 2015-2017 Ford F-150 trucks could have inoperative latches during freezing temperatures. The bulletin told dealers to install a rain shield to address the problem. The company initially alerted dealers in 2015 about the issue.
Ford Motor,2017-10,"Weigandt said Ford's decision to issue a recall is driven by data. ""When the data indicates a safety recall is needed, we move quickly,"" she said."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"The company said it was not aware of any accidents or injuries associated with the issue but said because of the fault, the door may appear closed, increasing the risk of the door opening while driving."
Ford Motor,2017-10,Ford has previously disclosed plans to spend $935 million on other recalls announced since August 2016.
Ford Motor,2017-10,"In March, Ford said it would spend $295 million to recall 211,000 vehicles in North America to replace potentially faulty side door latches and 230,000 vehicles for under-hood fire risks."

Ford Motor,2017-10,"ARLINGTON, Va., Oct 13 (Reuters) - The Trump administration is demanding the use of North American-made steel, aluminum, copper and plastic resins in cars and trucks sold under North American Free Trade Agreement rules, as it seeks to give U.S. industry a boost."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"People briefed on the matter said U.S. negotiators issued the proposal, which could force automakers to shift sourcing of some components to North America from Asia, during talks on Friday to overhaul NAFTA."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"It calls for the inclusion of steel, aluminum and other raw materials on a so-called NAFTA tracing list for auto parts, according to the sources, referring to the mechanism by which the regional content level of cars, trucks and large engines is monitored and verified under the trade agreement."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"The list would be greatly expanded under the U.S. proposal to cover a vast and complex web of automotive components, essentially eliminating the concept of ""deemed originating,"" under which parts not listed get a free pass to tariff-free NAFTA access, no matter their origin."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"In addition to the metals and plastics, the list would now include sophisticated automotive electronics, electric vehicle batteries and other parts not on the tracing list because they did not exist when NAFTA was negotiated by Canada, Mexico and the United States in the early 1990s."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"If Washington prevails, the components would now need to be sourced from North America to count toward proposed sharply higher content levels, or companies would need to pay U.S. tariffs of around 2.5 percent on them."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"People briefed on the U.S. proposal said it would lift the regional content threshold to 85 percent from the current 62.5 percent, with a 50 percent minimum U.S. content level. [nL2N1MO0U5]"
Ford Motor,2017-10,A spokeswoman for the U.S. Trade Representative's office declined to comment on the auto industry proposal.
Ford Motor,2017-10,"U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross has vowed to close ""loopholes"" in the parts list that he says allow too many cheap auto parts from Asia and other regions to enter the United States."
Ford Motor,2017-10,Ross has already sought to protect the U.S. steel and aluminum industries from subsidized imports with national security reviews that could lead to import restrictions.
Ford Motor,2017-10,Steel industry trade groups from all three NAFTA countries in June issued a joint statement calling for any renewal of the trade pact to require North American steel use in manufactured goods. [nL1N1J21D1]
Ford Motor,2017-10,"However, two people briefed on the talks said the U.S. proposal stops short of labor unions' call for ""melted and poured"" North American steel, which would have precluded the use of raw steel from elsewhere that has been rolled or otherwise processed on the continent."
Ford Motor,2017-10,Automakers in North America largely already use North American steel but currently get no content value credit for it. Adding it to the tracing list would get a typical vehicle hundreds of dollars closer to meeting the goal.
Ford Motor,2017-10,"But any such gains would be offset largely by the higher overall content thresholds and the need to find other sources for electronics, said Kristin Dziczek, a trade and labor economist with the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Michigan."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"Dziczek and auto industry groups say that the U.S. content proposal was likely to backfire, with automakers and suppliers simply choosing to pay the 2.5 percent U.S. tariffs for passenger cars and many parts, sourcing more of them from China or other Asian countries."

Ford Motor,2017-10,"WASHINGTON, Oct 13 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co said on Friday it will offer free repairs to North American owners of more than 1.4 million Explorer sport utility vehicles to help ensure that carbon monoxide and other exhaust gases cannot get into the vehicles, following the U.S. government's decision to upgrade an investigation in July."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"Several U.S. police agencies have raised concerns about potentially deadly carbon monoxide gas entering the cabins of Ford Explorers that had been adapted for law enforcement uses. Federal regulators have said they are aware of more than 2,700 complaints for exhaust odors as well as reports of three crashes and 41 injuries that may be linked to exposure to carbon monoxide among police and civilian 2011-2017 Explorer vehicles."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"Ford said its investigation has not found ""carbon monoxide levels that exceed what people are exposed to every day"" in the 1.4 million civilian vehicles. There is no U.S. government standard for in-vehicle carbon monoxide levels. Ford says it believes the vehicles are safe and is making the offer, which it is not classifying as a recall, in response to customer concerns."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"The second largest U.S. automaker said starting November 1, dealers will reprogram the air conditioner, replace the liftgate drain valves and inspect sealing of the rear of the vehicle. The fix covers about 1.3 million U.S. vehicles and about 100,000 in Canada and Mexico."
Ford Motor,2017-10,Ford declined to comment on the potential financial impact of the service offer that will last through the end of 2018.
Ford Motor,2017-10,The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) in July upgraded and expanded a probe into 1.33 million Ford Explorer SUVs over reports of exhaust odors in vehicle compartments and exposure to carbon monoxide.
Ford Motor,2017-10,Police agencies have reported two crashes that may be linked to carbon monoxide exposure and a third incident involving injuries related to carbon monoxide exposure.
Ford Motor,2017-10,NHTSA said it is evaluating preliminary testing that suggests carbon monoxide levels may be elevated in certain driving scenarios.
Ford Motor,2017-10,Ford has issued four technical service bulletins related to the exhaust odor issue to address complaints from police fleets and other owners.
Ford Motor,2017-10,"In July, Ford said it would pay to repair police versions of its Ford Explorer SUVs to correct possible carbon monoxide leaks that may be linked to crashes and injuries after some police reports temporarily halted use of the vehicles over carbon monoxide concerns."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"The city of Austin, Texas said in July it would remove all 400 of the city's Ford Explorer SUVs from use for additional testing and repairs after the city said 20 police officers were found with elevated levels of carbon monoxide. The department returned the vehicles to service after repairs and testing."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"In 2016, Ford agreed to settle a U.S. class-action lawsuit involving 1 million 2011-2015 Explorer SUVs over exhaust odor complaints, including reimbursements of up to $500 for repairs and the company agreed to make repairs. That settlement was approved in June but has not taken effect because of a penidng appeal."

Ford Motor,2017-10,"WASHINGTON, Oct 13 (Reuters) - The Trump administration is seeking to use NAFTA to boost the U.S. steel and other basic materials industries by proposing stricter automotive content rules that require the use of North American-made steel, aluminum, copper and plastic resins."
Ford Motor,2017-10,Three people who were briefed on the matter said that the U.S. rules of origin proposal would put these materials on the North American Free Trade Agreement's auto parts tracing list for the first time.
Ford Motor,2017-10,The list is used to verify the regional content level of vehicles and parts so that they can qualify for tariff-free shipment to all three NAFTA countries.
Ford Motor,2017-10,"U.S. negotiators submitted their rules of origin proposal to Mexican and Canadian counterparts on Friday. Other sources briefed on the talks said the proposal includes raising the threshold for overall North American value content for cars, trucks and large engines to 85 percent from the current 62.5 percent and a first-ever U.S.-specific content requirement of 50 percent. [nL2N1MO0U5]"
Ford Motor,2017-10,A spokeswoman for the U.S. Trade Represntative's office declined to comment on the autos proposal.
Ford Motor,2017-10,"U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross has vowed to close ""loopholes"" in the parts list that he says allow too many cheap auto parts from Asia and other regions to enter the United States."
Ford Motor,2017-10,The proposal would also give a boost to the steel and aluminum industries that Ross has sought to protect from subsidized imports with national security reviews.
Ford Motor,2017-10,"In some ways, the proposed steel, aluminum, copper and plastics requirement would help vehicle and parts makers meet the higher thresholds. Auto plants in North America already largely use North American steel and aluminum, but the metals' value does not count towards reaching the threshold because it is not on the tracing list."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"But the bigger problem is that President Donald Trump's administration also wants the auto parts tracing list expanded to include many components in modern cars and trucks that did not exist when NAFTA was first negotiated in the early 1990s, such as sophisticated electronics that largely come from Asia."

Ford Motor,2017-10,The U.S. automaker has lacked a high-volume brand of affordable entry cars for China and has been criticised for slow decision-making that has cost it share in a market where consumer tastes change quickly.

Ford Motor,2017-10,"DETROIT/WASHINGTON, Oct 12 (Reuters) - General Motors Co said on Thursday it plans to scale back production at an assembly plant in Detroit starting later this month as it tries to deal with declining U.S. sedan sales"
Ford Motor,2017-10,"GM said in a statement that effective Oct. 20 its Detroit-Hamtramck plant ""will operate under a reduced production schedule."""
Ford Motor,2017-10,"""This action will help maintain more stable production,"" the No. 1 U.S. carmaker said."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"The statement followed reports that GM plans to shut the plant for about six weeks from mid-November and lay off about 1,500 workers then cut production roughly 20 percent once operations resume, according to a source familiar with the plans."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"The Hamtramck plant makes four poorly performing sedan models, including the Buick LaCrosse, sales of which are down 21.5 percent year to date, and the Chevrolet Impala, which is down 31.8 percent."
Ford Motor,2017-10,Both GM and rival Ford Motor Co have struggled to rein in high inventories of passenger cars as consumers have shifted to buying pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles. Consultants have blamed a large portion of the U.S. auto industry's excessive inventories of unsold vehicles on GM.
Ford Motor,2017-10,"Domestic manufacturers ""continue to face steep competition in the passenger car segment and production must be aligned with waning sales in order to reduce the elevated amounts of inventory,"" Buckingham Research Group analyst Joseph Amaturo wrote in a client note about the Hamtramck news."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"Earlier this year, GM eliminated the plant's second shift, saying it was laying off around 1,200 workers."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"GM has reduced the number of shifts at five plants. The automaker announced last month that it would cut the third shift at its plant in Spring Hill, Tennessee, as of late November."
Ford Motor,2017-10,A GM spokesman said there are no plans to reinstate any of those shifts at this time.
Ford Motor,2017-10,"Although the eliminated shifts employed 6,000 hourly and salaried workers, GM's actual layoffs have been smaller. A spokesman said GM has let go 2,300 temporary workers and 800 hourly, union-represented workers have been laid off, for a total of 3,100 job cuts so far."

Ford Motor,2017-10,"Whilst London is rolling out an ""ultra low emission zone"", which will see the most gas-guzzling vehicles pay daily charges to enter the city centre from 2020, Oxford's ""Zero Emission Zone"" will ban emitting vehicles from entering part of the city centre from that date."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"Since German carmaker Volkswagen admitted in 2015 to cheating U.S. emissions tests, politicians around the world have unveiled plans to clamp down on diesel vehicles in a bid to improve air quality and meet more stringent targets."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"""All of us who drive or use petrol or diesel vehicles through Oxford are contributing to the city's toxic air,"" said city council board member John Tanner."
Ford Motor,2017-10,Oxford will also introduce reduced parking fees for electric vehicles and electric-taxi ranks.
Ford Motor,2017-10,"In the first stage of its plans from 2020, taxis, cars, light commercial vehicles and buses which are non zero-emission, will be banned from six streets in the city centre, including near the world-famous Oxford Union debating society."

Ford Motor,2017-10,"BEIJING, Oct 12 (Reuters) - China's vehicles sales rose in September for a fourth straight month, an industry body said on Thursday, but added that the market may struggle to hit a forecast for 5 percent annual growth set earlier in the year."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"The world's largest auto market may not hit growth levels estimated by the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers in January, ""but 4 percent and above should be pretty much a sure thing"", said Shi Jianhua, CAAM's deputy secretary general."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"Vehicle sales in China have rebounded since June, but CAAM's caution on full-year growth underlines challenges in the market, which saw a slow start to the year due to tax incentives on smaller-engined cars being phased out."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"China vehicle sales touched 2.71 million units in September, up 5.7 percent from a year ago, CAAM data showed."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"That took year-to-date sales to 20.2 million vehicles, up 4.5 percent against the same period in 2016. Vehicle sales in the country rose 13.7 percent last year."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"Recent sales have been relatively strong - growing 5.3 percent in August, 6.2 percent in July and 4.5 percent in June - underpinned by stronger overall economic growth and increased incentives for buyers, market watchers said."

Ford Motor,2017-10,"The revised state regulations will allow testing of autonomous vehicles without a driver behind the steering wheel and public use of vehicles equipped with autonomous technology, the state said."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"DETROIT, Oct 10 (Reuters) - The head of the National Automobile Dealers Association (NADA) on Tuesday criticized automakers' use of so-called stair-step bonus programs, calling them harmful to U.S. auto dealers, to consumer confidence and brand loyalty."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"In a speech in Detroit, NADA Chairman Mark Scarpelli said the practice results in ""wild discrepancies and fluctuations"" in vehicles prices between different dealers, as well as a ""lack of consistency, lack of transparency, and lack of explanation"" that lead directly to a ""lack of trust"" in auto dealers and in vehicle brands, he said"
Ford Motor,2017-10,Stair-step bonuses are paid out to dealers on an escalating scale as they hit progressively higher sales targets. Dealers that fall short of targets receive nothing.
Ford Motor,2017-10,"In the past, dealers and dealer groups have criticized Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV , Nissan Motor Co Ltd <7201.T> and Ford Motor Co for using stair-step programs."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"NADA commissioned a study into automakers' stair-step programs by Boston-based consultancy Analysis Group, Scarpelli said, whose results it will share with automakers and use them as the basis for discussion."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"The NADA, a trade association that represents around 16,500 auto dealers, has an influential presence in Washington, built largely on dealers' engagement with and support for local members of Congress."
Ford Motor,2017-10,Scarpelli's speech comes at a time when major automakers and their dealers are coming off a strong run in U.S. new-vehicle sales that lasted from the end of the Great Recession and culminated in record sales of 17.55 million units in 2016.
Ford Motor,2017-10,"This year's sales figures are expected to dip slightly, putting pressure on carmakers and their dealers to sell off high levels of inventory."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"At a time the industry likely finds itself in the middle of a ""lengthier sales plateau,"" Scarpelli said, it is critical for dealers and manufacturers to work together."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"In his speech Scarpelli also cited rising concerns from auto dealers about ""increasing attempts by their manufacturer partners to run their stores"" and mandate investments in expensive, and possibly unnecessary, facility upgrades."

Ford Motor,2017-10,UPDATE 3-U.S. Senate panel puts self-driving cars in fast lane - Reuters News
Ford Motor,2017-10,"{{20171004T222750.462+0000}}UPDATE 3-U.S. Senate panel puts self-driving cars in fast lane(New throughout, adds Teamsters reaction, GM report)"
Ford Motor,2017-10,"WASHINGTON, Oct 4 (Reuters) - A U.S. Senate panel on Wednesday unanimously gave the green light to a bill aimed at speeding the use of self-driving cars without human controls, a measure that also bars states from imposing regulatory road blocks."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"The bill still must clear a Senate vote, but it appears on track to passage. This should rev up profits for automakers, technology companies and ride service providers, hastening the day when their robot cars can carry passengers on the same U.S. roads as cars driven by people."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"General Motors Co , Alphabet Inc , Ford Motor Co and others have lobbied for the landmark legislation, while auto safety groups urged more safeguards and have pledged to keep fighting for changes."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"However the measure will not speed the process for self-driving commercial trucks, which remain in a slower lane despite support from several Republican senators."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"The Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee approved the bill, and the U.S. House of Representatives unanimously passed a similar measure last month. Automakers would be able to win exemptions from safety rules that require human controls. States could set rules on registration, licensing, liability, insurance and safety inspections, but not performance standards."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"Senator John Thune, the Republican who chairs the Commerce Committee, said the bill ""underscores the bipartisan desire to move ahead with self-driving vehicle technology.... The safety and economic benefits of self-driving vehicles are too critical to delay."""
Ford Motor,2017-10,"Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat, sought to amend the bill to require human controls in case of emergency, but dropped that proposal. Some senators argued it would be more dangerous to allow human drivers to seek to take over driverless cars."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"Even with the legislative victory, developers of self-driving technology face technical challenges. There are also the complications of driverless vehicles sharing the road with human drivers. GM told California its self-driving cars were involved in six crashes in September. The accidents were all minor, and the automaker has blamed them on human drivers and one bicyclist who hit its self-driving vehicles. [nL2N1MF1RO]"
Ford Motor,2017-10,"Neither the House nor the Senate bill would speed approval of self-driving technology for vehicles over 10,000 pounds, a step pushed by trucking organizations. Labor unions raised safety and employment concerns, and Democrats resisted that part of the proposal."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"Teamsters President Jim Hoffa said the ""safe development of advanced heavy trucking technology must encapsulate the life-and-death issues that are specific to that industry, not consider such consequences as an inconvenient after-thought."" He said Congress should also consider U.S. jobs."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"Tesla Inc , Alphabet, Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] and others have said they are working on self-driving trucks."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"After lengthy negotiations, congressional aides added language to the bill aimed at preserving legal rights to sue over defective vehicles. This resolved a dispute that threatened to derail the bill."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"Within three years, the bill would allow automakers to each sell up to 80,000 self-driving vehicles annually if they could demonstrate they are as safe as current vehicles. Auto safety advocates complained it lacked sufficient safeguards."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"The phase-in schedule was revised to initially allow 15,000 per manufacturer in the first year and up to 80,000 after three years, down from 50,000 to start and up to 100,000 in three years. It would eliminate the cap after four years."
Ford Motor,2017-10,The bill grants the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) authority to exempt vehicles from federal safety requirements and the agency would have to make a determination within six months of getting a request.
Ford Motor,2017-10,"The Self-Driving Coalition, a group of automakers, tech firms and advocates for the disabled, said the legislation ""will help ensure that the United States leads the world in self-driving innovation."""
Ford Motor,2017-10,"Under the measure, NHTSA must write permanent rules on self-driving cars within a decade and regulators must study how to encourage U.S. production of self-driving equipment and also look at the impact of self-driving vehicles on infrastructure, traffic congestion and fuel consumption."
Ford Motor,2017-10,Companies would need to disclose what information self-driving cars are collecting about individuals and how it is used. Companies would need to disclose if consumers could opt out of data collection.

Ford Motor,2017-10,UPDATE 3-Honda to cut Japanese production by a quarter as domestic sales stagnate - Reuters News
Ford Motor,2017-10,{{20171004T134404.000+0000}}UPDATE 3-Honda to cut Japanese production by a quarter as domestic sales stagnate* Honda to stop producing at Sayama plant north of Tokyo
Ford Motor,2017-10,* Says slimmed down operations will allow more focus on EVs
Ford Motor,2017-10,"TOKYO, Oct 4 (Reuters) - Honda Motor Co <7267.T> plans to end production at its Sayama plant in Japan by 2022, cutting capacity by around 24 percent in its shrinking domestic market as it shifts focus to electric cars (EVs) and other new technologies."
Ford Motor,2017-10,The automaker has seen stagnant domestic sales and said on Wednesday it was streamlining its Japanese operations as it takes a more nimble approach to development and manufacturing in the face of fierce competition from carmakers and technology companies to make EVs and self-driving cars.
Ford Motor,2017-10,"""As we focus more on adopting electrification and other new technologies, we want to hone our vehicle manufacturing expertise in Japan and expand it globally,"" CEO Takahiro Hachigo told a press conference."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"While automobile plant closures are rare in Japan, Honda, like its global rivals, is facing pressure to cut costs in legacy businesses, including countries where sales and profits are weak, in order to fund expansions in China and development of new technology."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"Earlier this week, Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T> ended production at its production plant in Australia, while Ford Motor Co said it would cut $14 billion in costs in the next five years. [nL4N1ME3GX]"
Ford Motor,2017-10,General Motors Co earlier this year sold its European operations to France's PSA Group while it also plans to exit India and other countries where sales have been struggling.
Ford Motor,2017-10,"Hachigo has been trying to revive a culture of innovation at Japan's No. 3 automaker, after a number of major recalls in recent years as well as lacklustre product offerings, partly because it focused so much on increasing volumes and profit. [nL4N1LO36S]"
Ford Motor,2017-10,"Honda said it would consolidate production at the ageing Sayama plant in Saitama Prefecture north of Tokyo, into its Yorii plant in the same prefecture by the end of the 2022 financial year."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"The move would cut overall domestic annual production capacity to around 810,000 units, the same as Honda's current output levels, which are around 76 percent of its current production capacity of 1.06 million vehicles."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"""Domestic sales haven't increased as much as we were expecting and it has become difficult to boost exports,"" Hachigo said."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"Following consolidation, Honda said the Yorii plant will produce EVs and serve as a major centre for developing manufacturing technology for electric cars. It will also produce other vehicles including larger-sized global models."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"While the automaker cuts capacity at home, it plans to open a new plant by 2019 in China, where it has seen explosive growth. Honda also has been expanding capacity in North America and just recently announced plans to expand output of its Accord sedan at one of its plants in Ohio. [nL2N1LZ0NF]"
Ford Motor,2017-10,"Overall, global annual production would remain largely unchanged at around 5.06 million units, it said."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"Honda has struggled to expand sales at home in the past few years, facing stiff competition from popular offerings including Toyota's Prius gasoline hybrid and Nissan Motor Co.'s <7201.T>, Note compact hatchback."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"In the year ended March, it sold 668,000 units domestically, almost the same as in the previous year. Overall, passenger car sales in Japan have been decreasing in past years due to a greying population while interest in car ownership among young people has been falling."
Ford Motor,2017-10,Hachigo also said he was confident Honda was following proper procedures for final vehicle inspection for the Japanese market.
Ford Motor,2017-10,He said the company was complying with a request from Japan's transport ministry for inspection records after Nissan said on Monday it would recall 1.2 million vehicles due to procedural irregularities with its final inspection processes. [nL4N1MF0FF]

Ford Motor,2017-10,"Beijing is trying to cut back on grim urban air pollution, reduce oil imports, and incubate local electric vehicle champions. Under official pressure, manufacturers are preparing to crank out EVs. For foreign automakers like Ford, the problem is that their most popular models tend to be large SUVs; they worry they will be forced to produce EVs that nobody buys."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"Ford's solution appears to be a sneak attack on an adjacent market: the millions of mid-sized trucks and delivery vans plying Chinese streets, most belching smog. As aggressive as Beijing's targets are for electrifying passenger cars, officials want to replace commercial clunkers even faster, and are rapidly regulating them off the roads."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"However, JMC and Ford will have to bring models to market quicker than rivals. Here secure access to battery supply may prove decisive. Some domestic carmakers have already invested in lithium mines and battery factories, worried that there won't be enough to go around. Ford can probably get where it's going, but best keep the pedal to the metal."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"- Ford Motor plans to slash $14 billion in costs over the next five years, Chief Executive Officer Jim Hackett told investors on Oct. 3, adding that the U.S. automaker would shift capital investment away from sedans and internal combustion engines to develop more trucks and electric and hybrid cars."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"- Ford is considering revamping its China strategy and detaching it from the ""One Ford"" strategy to focus on developing electric commercial vans and trucks, Reuters reported on Oct. 3, quoting two insiders. The new initiative would involve pushing its truck-making partner Jiangling Motors Corp more towards electric vans, the report said."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"- Ford's China sales are forecast to decline 4.6 percent this year, by number of vehicles sold, according to LMC Automotive. That is down from double-digit percentage growth five years ago."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"- China is introducing quotas to promote so-called ""new energy vehicles"". Carmakers will need to amass credits for NEVs equivalent to 10 percent of annual sales by 2019, China's industry ministry said on Sept. 28. That level would rise to 12 percent for 2020."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"- China's capital Beijing plans to ban diesel trucks burning dirtier classes of diesel from Sept. 21, 2019, state media reported on Sept. 18, citing a government document."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"- In August, the Ministry of Environmental Protection ordered certain companies in 28 cities to halve their use of diesel trucks in winter, when pollution is at its worst, Reuters reported.

Ford Motor,2017-10,"DETROIT, Oct 3 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co plans to slash $14 billion in costs over the next five years, Chief Executive Officer Jim Hackett told investors on Tuesday, adding that the No. 2 U.S. automaker would shift capital investment away from sedans and internal combustion engines to develop more trucks and electric and hybrid cars."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"Most of those savings will not show up on Ford's bottom line until 2019 and 2020, Hackett and other Ford executives said, reflecting the industry's long product engineering lead times."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"Ford will be open to more partnerships to spread the costs and risks of simultaneously developing new technology and services while churning out profit from selling trucks and sport utility vehicles in North America, Hackett said during a nearly two-hour presentation. He cited a partnership with ride services company Lyft to deploy future Ford self-driving cars, an alliance with Indian automaker Mahindra and a potential alliance with Chinese electric vehicle maker Zotye. [nL4N1LZ2UI]"
Ford Motor,2017-10,The automaker reaffirmed a goal of achieving 8 percent automotive operating margins and generating returns that exceed the cost of capital. Ford will provide a financial forecast for 2018 in January. Ford Chief Financial Officer Bob Shanks said it could take until 2020 or later to achieve the 8 percent margin goal.
Ford Motor,2017-10,"Other automakers have warned that shifting to all-electric vehicles could undercut profit margins. ""I don't think we should walk off a ledge where we destroy the earnings power of the company,"" Hackett said, saying Ford is planning for a third of vehicles to still have internal combustion engines by 2030 - the year some European governments have proposed banning petroleum fueled cars."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"Hackett, former CEO of office furniture maker Steelcase Inc , took the top post at Ford in May after his predecessor Mark Fields was pushed out. At the time, Hackett promised to tell investors after 100 days how he would improve the ""fitness"" of Ford to compete as the auto industry becomes more digital, more electric and less wedded to selling one vehicle at a time to individuals."

Ford Motor,2017-10,"Hackett has signed off on a series of moves, including a plan to shift production of Ford Focus compact cars from Michigan to China. He also hired a company outsider, Jason Luo, to lead Ford's business in China, the world's largest car market, where Ford is revamping operations and looking to expand partnerships in electric vehicles. [nL4N1MD26Z]"
Ford Motor,2017-10,"Ford is playing catch up in some areas. By 2019, Ford plans to equip all U.S. models with built-in modems and to install mobile internet connections in 90 percent of global vehicles by 2020, Hackett said."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"Rival General Motors Co has been installing built-in mobile broadband connections in its U.S. vehicles since 2015 and now has about 7 million 4G LTE connected vehicles on the road globally, a spokesman said on Tuesday."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"Of Ford's $14 billion in promised cost reductions over five years, $10 billion will come from material costs and $4 billion from reduced engineering costs, Hackett said."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"""We have too much cost across our business,"" Hackett said."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"By 2022, Ford plans to cut spending on future internal combustion engines by a third, or about $500 million, putting that money instead into expanded electric and hybrid vehicle development, on top of $4.5 billion previously announced. Ford had already promised 13 new electric or hybrid vehicles within the next five years."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"Ford is ""looking to build sustainably profitable BEV (battery electric vehicle) business"" in segments where ""we have a strong revenue presence,"" Jim Farley, head of global markets, told investors."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"Farley also said Ford is looking ""carefully"" at marginally profitable or unprofitable operations in Europe and Latin America, and could look to partnerships in those markets."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"Electric vehicles will mean auto factories can have a final assembly area that is half the size, requires half the capital investment and 30 percent fewer labor hours per car, said Joe Hinrichs, president of global operations."
Ford Motor,2017-10,GM on Monday said it planned to launch 20 new all-electric vehicles by 2023. [nL2N1MD1YS]
Ford Motor,2017-10,"One way to cut costs will be to offer fewer variations of Ford's models, Hackett said. The slow-selling Ford Fusion midsize sedan can now be ordered in 35,000 combinations of features, colors and powertrain options. The future model will come in just 96 combinations, meaning fewer parts to design, produce and store in inventory, Ford showed in a presentation."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"He said Ford also will cut the time it takes to engineer a new car by 20 percent, and invest in ""factories of the future"" that will occupy less space and use more robots."

Ford Motor,2017-10,"Of Ford's $14 billion in promised cost reductions over five years, $10 billion will come from material costs and $4 billion from reduced engineering costs, Hackett said."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"""We have too much cost across our business,"" Hackett said."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"By 2022, Ford plans to cut spending on future internal combustion engines by a third, or about $500 million, putting that money instead into expanded electric and hybrid vehicle development, on top of $4.5 billion previously announced. Ford had already promised 13 new electric or hybrid vehicles within the next five years."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"Ford is ""looking to build sustainably profitable BEV (battery electric vehicle) business"" in segments where ""we have a strong revenue presence,"" Jim Farley, head of global markets, told investors."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"Farley also said Ford is looking ""carefully"" at marginally profitable or unprofitable operations in Europe and Latin America, and could look to partnerships in those markets."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"Electric vehicles will mean auto factories can have a final assembly area that is half the size, requires half the capital investment and 30 percent fewer labor hours per car, said Joe Hinrichs, president of global operations."
Ford Motor,2017-10,GM on Monday said it planned to launch 20 new all-electric vehicles by 2023. [nL2N1MD1YS]
Ford Motor,2017-10,"One way to cut costs will be to offer fewer variations of Ford's models, Hackett said. The slow-selling Ford Fusion midsize sedan can now be ordered in 35,000 combinations of features, colors and powertrain options. The future model will come in just 96 combinations, meaning fewer parts to design, produce and store in inventory, Ford showed in a presentation."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"He said Ford also will cut the time it takes to engineer a new car by 20 percent, and invest in ""factories of the future"" that will occupy less space and use more robots."

Ford Motor,2017-10,{{20171003T224043.632+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-Ford CEO bets ambitious retool on big cost cuts(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.)
Ford Motor,2017-10,"NEW YORK, Oct 3 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Ford's new chief executive is betting his ambitious retool on big cost cuts. Jim Hackett, who jumped into the driver's seat in May, wants to slash $14 billion of fat by 2022 and switch $7 billion of investment to trucks and SUVs from cars. That should boost earnings, helping speed development of electric and autonomous vehicles. The plan will have to fire on all cylinders, though, to catch up with competitors."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"Expense savings alone could generate a huge profit boost for a company that has often missed earnings estimates and posted declining pretax margins, allowing GM to take pole position. If the entire $14 billion were, once taxed, to go straight to the bottom line, it would more than double last year's net income. Favoring larger vehicles over cars will boost margins, too."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"These steps, if successful, will enable Hackett to develop the car of the future by ramping up spending on things like electric batteries, machine learning, autonomous driving and big data."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"But BMW has been more forthcoming about its progress. And GM is promising to double its electric lineup and hints it may be able to put robotaxis on the road within a couple of years. That raises the bar for rivals, especially for one that has disappointed investors in recent years. If Hackett cannot show he's making headway on new technology or stumbles in his attempts to pare back costs, Ford may have to go back to the drawing board."
Ford Motor,2017-10,- Ford Chief Executive Jim Hackett on Oct. 3 unveiled his strategy for the automaker at an event in New York City.

Ford Motor,2017-10,"DETROIT, Oct 3 (Reuters) - Major automakers on Tuesday posted higher U.S. new vehicle sales in September as consumers in hurricane-hit parts of the country replaced flood-damaged cars, extending a rally in their shares that began when Hurricane Harvey hit southeast Texas in late August."
Ford Motor,2017-10,Analysts and industry consultants had predicted hurricanes Harvey and Irma would provide automakers with their first monthly gains in 2017. Sales had been weak after a strong run since 2010 that culminated in record sales of 17.55 million units in 2016. [nL2N1M90YP]
Ford Motor,2017-10,But others warned high inventory levels and record consumer discounts remained a concern moving forward.
Ford Motor,2017-10,"The seasonally adjusted annualized rate of U.S. car and light truck sales in September rose to 18.57 million units from 17.72 million units a year earlier, according to Autodata Corp, which tracks industry sales."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"While U.S. sales rose beyond the storm zones, according to automakers and dealers, much of the September gains came after Hurricane Harvey hit Texas.

Ford Motor,2017-10,GM's sales jumped nearly 12 percent versus September 2016 as a 43 percent increase in sales of crossovers and a 10 percent rise for pickup trucks offset an 11 percent decline for passenger cars.
Ford Motor,2017-10,"The No. 1 U.S. automaker's inventory fell to 76 days' supply last month from 88 days in August, a positive development since analysts have blamed the automaker for much of the industry's oversupply of unsold new vehicles.

Ford Motor,2017-10,{{20171003T195511.067+0000}}Auto safety advocates criticize U.S. self-driving car legislationBy David Shepardson
Ford Motor,2017-10,"WASHINGTON, Oct 3 (Reuters) - A coalition of auto safety advocates criticized a bill before the U.S. Congress that would allow automakers eventually to sell up to 100,000 self-driving vehicles annually if they could demonstrate they are as safe as current vehicles."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"The measure, the first significant federal legislation aimed at speeding self-driving cars to market, would allow automakers to win exemptions from safety standards for self-driving cars without human controls and bar states from imposing performance requirements."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"Last week, U.S. Senator John Thune, a Republican who chairs the Commerce Committee, and Senator Gary Peters, a Michigan Democrat, said they had reached a bipartisan deal on the legislation."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"The Senate Commerce Committee will vote on the measure on Wednesday, but may also vote on whether to include larger trucks. The U.S. House unanimously passed a similar bill in early September that did not include vehicles above 10,000 pounds (4.5 tonnes)."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"""The public will be the crash-test dummy for this dangerous experiment,"" former National Highway Traffic Safety Administration chief Joan Claybrook told a conference call with reporters on Tuesday, arguing the auto industry ""is essentially trying to deregulate auto safety."""
Ford Motor,2017-10,"Jason Levine, who heads the Center for Auto Safety, said on the call there was an ""absence of corporate caution in the rush to be first to get self-driving cars on the road."""
Ford Motor,2017-10,"General Motors Co , Alphabet Inc , Ford Motor Co and others have lobbied for the legislation to speed deployment of self-driving cars without human controls."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"States could still set rules on registration, licensing, liability, insurance and safety inspections, but not performance standards."
Ford Motor,2017-10,The bill grants the NHTSA authority to exempt vehicles from existing federal safety requirements and the agency would have to make a determination within six months of getting a request.
Ford Motor,2017-10,"It is not clear how the agency would make that assessment, given limited current testing on U.S. roads. The fatality rate in 2015 was 1.12 deaths and 78 injuries per 100 million miles traveled."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"The bill is backed by groups including the Association of People with Disabilities, that say self-driving vehicles ""have the potential to transform how Americans, with and without disabilities, move about their communities."""
Ford Motor,2017-10,"The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a trade group, said on Tuesday that NHTSA's authority was not affected by the bill. ""Given that human error contributes to nine out of 10 crashes, advancing self-driving technologies right now is critical to enhancing future roadway safety,"" spokesman Wade Newton said."

Ford Motor,2017-10,{{20171003T150427.448+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-Ford is playing catch-up with General Motors(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.)
Ford Motor,2017-10,"At 7.8 times next year's earnings, Ford trades at a premium to GM's 7.1 times, even after its stock tanked by more than a third under former Chief Executive Mark Fields. Skepticism about GM's post-bankruptcy turnaround offset Ford's missed earnings targets, declining profitability and confusion about its plans for a connected, self-driving future."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"New boss Jim Hackett's big fix has gotten off to a poor start. On Monday, Ford announced it was setting up a new unit, Team Edison, to ""think big,"" ""make quicker decisions"" and ""think holistically"" about electric cars. Within hours, GM bested that, saying it would have 20 electric and hybrid vehicles on the road by 2023."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"Autonomous and electric vehicles may not hit the roads en masse or be profitable for years. And whatever Hackett cooks up, Ford is unlikely to get near the valuation multiple of Tesla , even after the latter's third-quarter production of its Model 3 came in at less than a fifth of its target."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"Nonetheless, the stakes are high. Automakers need to show they know roughly where they're going without squandering capital. GM, with its shares hitting a record high, gets the joke. If Hackett cannot show Ford does, too, its premium to GM is under imminent threat."
Ford Motor,2017-10,- Ford Motor will unveil new Chief Executive Jim Hackett's strategy for the automaker after stock markets close on Oct. 3.
Ford Motor,2017-10,"- Ford has formed a team to speed up development of electric cars, with a brief to ""think big,"" ""make quicker decisions"" and ""look holistically"" at the market, Sherif Marakby, vice president of autonomous vehicles and electrification, said on Oct. 2."
Ford Motor,2017-10,- General Motors the same day outlined plans to put 20 electric-battery and fuel-cell vehicles on the roads by 2023. These would include most if not all of the at least 10 hybrid or electric cars Chief Executive Mary Barra has pledged to introduce to the Chinese market by 2020.
Ford Motor,2017-10,"- GM's shares closed at a record high $42.15 on Oct. 2, driven higher by a Deutsche Bank research note saying the automaker plans to have autonomous ride-sharing service in operation by 2020."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"- Tesla delivered 26,150 cars in the third quarter, the electric-car maker reported on Oct. 2. Of these, 220 were the new Model 3. A total of 260 Model 3s were built in the quarter, well below the target of 1,500."

Ford Motor,2017-10,"DETROIT, Oct 3 (Reuters) - Major automakers posted higher U.S. new vehicle sales in September, as consumers in hurricane-hit parts of the country, in particular southeast Texas, rushed to replace flood-damaged cars."
Ford Motor,2017-10,Analysts and industry consultants had predicted that hurricanes Harvey and Irma would provide automakers with their first monthly sales gain in 2017. [nL2N1M90YP]
Ford Motor,2017-10,But others warned that high inventory levels and record consumer discounts remained a concern moving forward.
Ford Motor,2017-10,Sales at No. 1 U.S. automaker General Motors Co jumped nearly 12 percent versus September 2016 as a 43 percent increase in sales of crossovers and a 10 percent rise for pickup trucks offset an 11 percent decline for passenger cars.
Ford Motor,2017-10,"GM inventory fell to 76 days supply last month from 88 days in August, a positive development since analysts have blamed the automaker for much of the industry's oversupply of unsold new vehicles. GM is moving closer to its goal of around 70 days supply by the end of the year."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"The ""overall strength of the U.S. economy is the main force driving the market,"" said GM chief economist Mustafa Mohatarem, with recovery in hurricane-damaged areas ""spurring new and used vehicle sales."""
Ford Motor,2017-10,"New car sales in the Houston area, the fourth most populous in the United States, jumped 109 percent in the three weeks after Hurricane Harvey compared with the three weeks before the storm, according to car shopping website Edmunds."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"Some industry consultants have estimated up to 500,000 cars were damaged or destroyed during Harvey."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"But Jessica Caldwell, Edmunds executive director of industry analysis, said automakers were struggling to reduce inventories in the rest of the country."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"Ford Motor Co's sales rose 8.7 percent in September, with those to consumers up 4.4 percent and lower-margin fleet sales up 25.1 percent. F-Series pickup truck sales soared 21.4 percent."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"Toyota Motor Corp's <7203.T> September sales were up nearly 15 percent, with strong gains for SUVs and trucks. Sales of the revamped 2018 Camry sedan were up 13 percent in the vehicle's first full month of sales."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCA) reported a 10 percent decline in sales, driven by a 41 percent drop in lower-margin fleet sales. The company is cutting back on fleet sales."
Ford Motor,2017-10,FCA said retail sales to consumers rose 0.3 percent from with September 2016.
Ford Motor,2017-10,"In early trading, Ford shares were up 2.1 percent to $12.34 and GM was up nearly 3 percent to $43.37."

Ford Motor,2017-10,"BEIJING/DETROIT, Oct 3 (Reuters) - U.S. automaker Ford Motor Co is overhauling its China plans as its global ""One Ford"" strategy is holding it back in the world's biggest auto market, two high-ranking company insiders told Reuters."

Ford Motor,2017-10,"DETROIT, Oct 2 (Reuters) - Detroit automaker General Motors Co outlined plans on Monday to add 20 new battery electric and fuel cell vehicles to its global product lineup by 2023, financed by robust profits from sales of gasoline-fueled trucks and sport utility vehicles in the United States and China."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"""General Motors believes in an all-electric future,"" GM global product development chief Mark Reuss said on Monday during a briefing at the company's suburban Detroit technical center."
Ford Motor,2017-10,"Future generations of GM electric vehicles ""will be profitable,"" Reuss said, but added it was not clear when GM could make all its new vehicle offerings zero-emission electric cars."
Ford Motor,2017-10,Regulators in China and some European countries have floated proposals to ban internal combustion engines by 2030 or 2040.
Ford Motor,2017-10,"""We will continue to make sure our internal combustion engines will get more and more efficient,"" Reuss said."

Ford Motor,2017-10,"GM earned more than 90 percent of its $12.5 billion in pretax profits last year in North America, amid robust demand for its lineup of large sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks.

The company offered sneak peeks of three electric vehicle prototypes: a Buick brand sport utility vehicle, a sporty Cadillac wagon and a futuristic pod car wearing a Bolt badge."

Ford Motor,2017-10,"The company plans to offer a fuel cell vehicle to retail customers within five years, it said. Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T>, Honda Motor Co <7267.T> and Hyundai Motor Co <005380.KS> already are marketing fuel cell vehicles in low volume."
