Exxon,2017-8,{{20170831T110001.566+0000}}NAFTA nations plan talks progress under barrage of Trump threatsBy Dave Graham
Exxon,2017-8,"MEXICO CITY, Aug 31 (Reuters) - Trade negotiators plan to take small steps forward in a second round of talks to rework the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) this weekend, trying to ignore daily threats from U.S. President Donald Trump to tear it up if he does not get his way."
Exxon,2017-8,"Trump has used Twitter, press conferences and speeches to attack NAFTA in recent days, a ploy Mexican and Canadian officials regard as a negotiating strategy to wring concessions, but which has heightened uncertainty over the accord."
Exxon,2017-8,"""Hopefully we can renegotiate it, but if we can't, we'll terminate it and we'll start all over again with a real deal,"" Trump told cheering workers at a factory in Missouri on Wednesday, as Mexico's foreign and trade ministers met their U.S. counterparts in Washington to keep relations on track."
Exxon,2017-8,"Away from the diplomatic noise, trade experts from the three NAFTA nations hope to advance the revamp during the five days of talks in Mexico that start on Friday by working through areas of greater consensus before turning to trickier issues."
Exxon,2017-8,"""We want to see positive signs of progress at the negotiating tables,"" said Moises Kalach, head of the international negotiating arm of Mexico's CCE business lobby, which is leading the private sector in the talks. ""Hopefully we'll get it, even if it doesn't have to be stated publicly. Hopefully we'll start getting closure on some issues."""
Exxon,2017-8,"Overall, the Mexican round, which follows talks two weeks ago in Washington, is expected to define more clearly the priorities of each nation rather than yield major breakthroughs."
Exxon,2017-8,"The emergence of detailed positions on the tougher points looks less likely in this round, officials said."
Exxon,2017-8,"Kalach and one Mexican negotiator, who spoke on condition of anonymity, saw broad agreement between the NAFTA members on how to improve conditions for small businesses, as well as in salvaging elements of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade accord that Trump ditched after taking office."
Exxon,2017-8,"Some consensus was forged between the three countries when the TPP was finalized in 2015 on issues including the environment, anti-corruption, labor rules and digital trade."
Exxon,2017-8,"More divisive issues that could enter the talks range from exploring the scope to raise NAFTA content requirements for autos to the contested U.S. demand to scrap the so-called Chapter 19 dispute settlement mechanism for resolving complaints about illegal subsidies and dumping, officials say."
Exxon,2017-8,"A key plank of the U.S. strategy is how to reduce its trade deficit with Mexico, which has sent negotiators scrambling for creative ways to rebalance trade, Kalach said."
Exxon,2017-8,"One hope is that Mexico's incipient oil and gas sector opening will result in more imports and infrastructure investment from U.S. companies, some of which have already entered the market, such as Exxon Mobil Corp and Chevron Corp."
Exxon,2017-8,"Folding that reform into NAFTA in a way that would make any attempt to unwind it politically costly for a future Mexican government would give U.S. and Canadian investors more security, Kalach and the Mexican negotiator said."
Exxon,2017-8,"The risk the reform will stall has preoccupied officials in the region because the current front-runner for Mexico's July 2018 presidential election, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, opposed the opening of the energy industry."
Exxon,2017-8,"""The best thing (the United States and Canada) can do is protect NAFTA because this essentially protects their investments,"" said Kalach."
Exxon,2017-8,"Trump has accused Mexico and Canada of being ""very difficult"", and officials from both countries say his words come as little surprise given his confrontational negotiating style."
Exxon,2017-8,"Still, Mexico's government has touted a back-up plan, seeing a ""high risk"" that NAFTA could unravel.[nL2N1LF14H]"
Exxon,2017-8,Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Tuesday shrugged off the threats and Canadian officials close to the process said they remained fully focused on the talks.
Exxon,2017-8,"""There are always going to be words thrown about here and there but ... we will continue to work seriously and respectfully to improve NAFTA to benefit not just Canadians but our American and Mexican friends as well,"" Trudeau said."
Exxon,2017-8,"A spokeswoman for U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) Robert Lighthizer declined to comment directly on how Trump's comments would affect the talks. However, trade experts say they are unlikely to foster a spirit of cooperation."
Exxon,2017-8,"""I think his tweets and statements are just complicating what's already a difficult negotiation,"" said Wendy Cutler, a former deputy USTR and lead U.S. negotiator for the TPP."
Exxon,2017-8,"""I think it will embolden the naysayers in Canada and Mexico who don't want to move in certain areas by telling the negotiators, 'don't move on these issues because the president has already said he probably won't sign off on this deal'""."

Exxon,2017-8,{{20170829T132828.360+0000}}Harvey threatens more U.S. oil refineries after heavy rainsBy Erwin Seba
Exxon,2017-8,"HOUSTON, Aug 29 (Reuters) - Heavy rains and flooding from Tropical Storm Harvey threatened more oil refineries along the Louisiana coast after hammering plants in Texas, forcing Exxon Mobil Corp and Citgo Petroleum [PDVSAC.UL] to consider shutdowns."
Exxon,2017-8,"The storm dropped back over the Gulf of Mexico on Monday, sending heavy rains from Houston through to Lake Charles, Louisiana. Between five and 15 inches of rain was expected in south-central Louisiana, the National Hurricane Center said on Tuesday."
Exxon,2017-8,"The Gulf Coast is home to nearly half the U.S. refining capacity, and nearly 2.7 million barrels per day, or nearly 15 percent of U.S. refining capacity, is already shut off. Restarting those plants even under the best conditions can take a week or more."
Exxon,2017-8,Louisiana is home to about 3.3 million barrels of daily capacity; Texas has about 5.6 million barrels.
Exxon,2017-8,"U.S. gasoline futures on Tuesday rose 0.9 percent to $1.73 a gallon, and have jumped about 6 percent since last Wednesday's prestorm close. Heating oil futures, a proxy for diesel and other distillates, added 0.5 percent."
Exxon,2017-8,"Fuel prices are expected to keep rising as refining capacity remains down because of the storm. In cash trading on Monday, the spread between Gulf Coast gasoline prices and benchmark futures hit a five-year high in anticipation of constrained supply. [nL2N1LE1PT]"
Exxon,2017-8,"The full impact of the refining outages, which began last week when Harvey slammed into Corpus Christi, Texas, and is now affecting Louisiana's refining center, remained uncertain, analysts said."
Exxon,2017-8,"""The current disruptions are affecting both demand and supply, making it difficult to assess the impact on balances at this point,"" wrote analysts at JBC Energy."
Exxon,2017-8,"Exxon may begin shutting units as early as Tuesday at its 362,300-barrel-per-day (bpd) Beaumont refinery in east Texas due to high water in the plant, said sources familiar with the company's plans. It was weighing a shutdown of its 240,000-bpd crude distillation unit and 45,000-bpd coking unit, the sources said. The company earlier cut production at its Baytown, Texas, refinery, the nation's second largest."
Exxon,2017-8,"Motiva Enterprises [MOTIV.UL] plans to make a final decision Tuesday on whether to shut the nation's largest crude refinery as the storm pours more water into its Port Arthur, Texas, plant, two sources familiar with plant operations said. Motiva said Monday that operations at the plant were ""stable."""
Exxon,2017-8,"Citgo's 425,0000-bpd Lake Charles, Louisiana, refinery has reduced production because of crude oil shipping disruptions, Energy News Today reported on Monday. Citgo is keeping a close eye on operations, a spokeswoman said Monday night."
Exxon,2017-8,"Previous storms have substantially affected demand, which may offset expectations for tightening refined product supply. Retail gasoline prices have started to rise, with the average price for a gallon of gasoline rising 1 cent overnight to $2.38 nationally, while the average price in Texas rose 2 cents overnight to $2.19 per gallon."
Exxon,2017-8,"Compounding matters is the possible closing of the Houston Ship Channel, a prime artery for crude supplies, for an extended period of time."

Exxon,2017-8,"HOUSTON, Aug 28 (Reuters) - Historic flooding from Tropical Storm Harvey killed at least seven people in Texas and was expected to drive 30,000 from their homes, as officials on Monday warned that floodwaters would likely rise in the coming days as the storm hovers over the U.S. Gulf Coast."
Exxon,2017-8,"Thousands of National Guard troops, police, rescue workers and civilians raced in helicopters, boats and special high-water trucks to rescue the hundreds of people still believed trapped in Houston, the nation's fourth-largest city."
Exxon,2017-8,"The storm was the most powerful hurricane to strike Texas in more than 50 years when it came ashore on Friday near Corpus Christi, about 220 miles (354 km) south of Houston."
Exxon,2017-8,"It is believed to have killed at least six people in Harris County, where Houston is located, according to Tricia Bentley, a spokeswoman for the county coroner's office. A 60-year-old woman died in neighboring Montgomery County when a tree fell on her trailer home while she slept, the local medical examiner's letter said on Twitter. More deaths were suspected in neighboring counties."
Exxon,2017-8,"As stunned families surveyed the wreckage of destroyed homes along the nearby coast and roads that were not flooded were clogged with debris, Texas Governor Greg Abbott warned Houstonians to brace for a long period of disruption."
Exxon,2017-8,"""We need to recognize this is going to be a new and different normal for this entire region,"" Abbott told reporters after touring the damaged coastal city of Corpus Christi."
Exxon,2017-8,"Harvey was expected to remain over Texas' Gulf Coast for the next few days, dropping another 10 inches to 20 inches (25-51 cm) of rain, with threats of flooding extending into neighboring Louisiana."
Exxon,2017-8,"In scenes evoking the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans in 2005, police and Coast Guard teams have rescued at least 2,000 people so far, plucking many from rooftops by helicopter, as they urged the hundreds believed to be marooned in flooded houses to hang towels or sheets outside to alert rescuers."
Exxon,2017-8,"Harvey's center was 85 miles (137 km) south-southwest of Houston on Monday afternoon and forecast to arc slowly toward the city through Wednesday, with the worst floods expected later that day and on Thursday."
Exxon,2017-8,"Schools and office buildings were closed throughout in the metropolitan area, home to 6.8 million people, on Monday as chest-high water filled some neighborhoods in the low-lying city."
Exxon,2017-8,Numerous refiners shut operations in the nation's refining and petrochemical hub.
Exxon,2017-8,"The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers said Monday that it was releasing water from the nearby Addicks and Barker reservoirs into Buffalo Bayou, the primary body of water running through Houston. Officials warned that would lead to more flooding."
Exxon,2017-8,"""The more they release it could go up and it could create even additional problems,"" Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner warned. The release was necessary to prevent an uncontrolled surge of water, which Turner said ""would be exponentially worse."""
Exxon,2017-8,"Torrential rain also hit areas more than 150 miles (240 km) away, swelling rivers upstream and causing a surge that was heading toward the Houston area, where numerous rivers and streams already have been breached."
Exxon,2017-8,"The high floodwaters made it hard for some residents who had fled their homes to find safe places to stay. Christe Fletcher, 37, fled her house after it flooded to waist-deep, but was struggling to find a safe route to the hotel where she had reserved a room."
Exxon,2017-8,"""It's kind of hard to get there because all of the roads are closed,"" Fletched said. ""It's the worst experience you can go through."""
Exxon,2017-8,"About 5,500 people were in shelters as of Monday morning, city officials said, with Federal Emergency Management Agency director Brock Long forecasting that as more than 30,000 people would eventually are expected to be placed temporarily in shelters."
Exxon,2017-8,"Many area residents were left in limbo, wondering what remained of their flooded homes."
Exxon,2017-8,"Regina Costilla, 48, said she and her 16-year-old son had been rescued from their home by a good Samaritan with a boat. She sat and worried until she was reunited with her husband and large dog, who had been left behind because they didn't fit into the boat."
Exxon,2017-8,"""I'm not complaining, we're alive,"" said Costilla. ""When I saw the forecast of the storm I said I'll be happy if we get out with our lives"""
Exxon,2017-8,"Houston did not order an evacuation due to concerns about people being stranded on city highways now consumed by floods, Turner said."

Exxon,2017-8,"HOUSTON, Aug 29 (Reuters) - Heavy rains and flooding from Tropical Storm Harvey threatened more oil refineries along the Louisiana coast after hammering plants in Texas, forcing Exxon Mobil Corp and Citgo Petroleum [PDVSAC.UL] to consider shutdowns."
Exxon,2017-8,"The storm dropped back over the Gulf of Mexico on Monday, sending heavy rains from Houston through to Lake Charles, Louisiana. Between five and 15 inches of rain was expected in south-central Louisiana, the National Hurricane Center said on Tuesday."
Exxon,2017-8,"The Gulf Coast is home to nearly half the U.S. refining capacity, and nearly 2.7 million barrels per day, or nearly 15 percent of U.S. refining capacity, is already shut off. Restarting those plants even under the best conditions can take a week or more."
Exxon,2017-8,Louisiana is home to about 3.3 million barrels of daily capacity; Texas has about 5.6 million barrels.
Exxon,2017-8,"U.S. gasoline futures on Tuesday rose 0.9 percent to $1.73 a gallon, and have jumped about 6 percent since last Wednesday's prestorm close. Heating oil futures, a proxy for diesel and other distillates, added 0.5 percent."
Exxon,2017-8,"Fuel prices are expected to keep rising as refining capacity remains down because of the storm. In cash trading on Monday, the spread between Gulf Coast gasoline prices and benchmark futures hit a five-year high in anticipation of constrained supply. [nL2N1LE1PT]"
Exxon,2017-8,"The full impact of the refining outages, which began last week when Harvey slammed into Corpus Christi, Texas, and is now affecting Louisiana's refining center, remained uncertain, analysts said."
Exxon,2017-8,"""The current disruptions are affecting both demand and supply, making it difficult to assess the impact on balances at this point,"" wrote analysts at JBC Energy."
Exxon,2017-8,"Exxon may begin shutting units as early as Tuesday at its 362,300-barrel-per-day (bpd) Beaumont refinery in east Texas due to high water in the plant, said sources familiar with the company's plans. It was weighing a shutdown of its 240,000-bpd crude distillation unit and 45,000-bpd coking unit, the sources said. The company earlier cut production at its Baytown, Texas, refinery, the nation's second largest."
Exxon,2017-8,"Motiva Enterprises [MOTIV.UL] plans to make a final decision Tuesday on whether to shut the nation's largest crude refinery as the storm pours more water into its Port Arthur, Texas, plant, two sources familiar with plant operations said. Motiva said Monday that operations at the plant were ""stable."""
Exxon,2017-8,"Citgo's 425,0000-bpd Lake Charles, Louisiana, refinery has reduced production because of crude oil shipping disruptions, Energy News Today reported on Monday. Citgo is keeping a close eye on operations, a spokeswoman said Monday night."
Exxon,2017-8,"Previous storms have substantially affected demand, which may offset expectations for tightening refined product supply. Retail gasoline prices have started to rise, with the average price for a gallon of gasoline rising 1 cent overnight to $2.38 nationally, while the average price in Texas rose 2 cents overnight to $2.19 per gallon."

Exxon,2017-8,"Harvey was expected to remain over Texas' Gulf Coast for the next few days, dropping another 10 inches to 20 inches (25-51 cm) of rain, with threats of flooding extending into neighboring Louisiana."
Exxon,2017-8,"In scenes evoking the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans in 2005, police and Coast Guard teams have rescued at least 2,000 people so far, plucking many from rooftops by helicopter, as they urged the hundreds believed to be marooned in flooded houses to hang towels or sheets outside to alert rescuers."

Exxon,2017-8,"The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers said Monday that it was releasing water from the nearby Addicks and Barker reservoirs into Buffalo Bayou, the primary body of water running through Houston. Officials warned that would lead to more flooding."
Exxon,2017-8,"""The more they release it could go up and it could create even additional problems,"" Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner warned. The release was necessary to prevent an uncontrolled surge of water, which Turner said ""would be exponentially worse."""
Exxon,2017-8,"Torrential rain also hit areas more than 150 miles (240 km) away, swelling rivers upstream and causing a surge that was heading toward the Houston area, where numerous rivers and streams already have been breached."
Exxon,2017-8,"The high floodwaters made it hard for some residents who had fled their homes to find safe places to stay. Christe Fletcher, 37, fled her house after it flooded to waist-deep, but was struggling to find a safe route to the hotel where she had reserved a room."

Exxon,2017-8,"Regina Costilla, 48, said she and her 16-year-old son had been rescued from their home by a good Samaritan with a boat. She sat and worried until she was reunited with her husband and large dog, who had been left behind because they didn't fit into the boat."
Exxon,2017-8,"""I'm not complaining, we're alive,"" said Costilla. ""When I saw the forecast of the storm I said I'll be happy if we get out with our lives"""

Exxon,2017-8,"HOUSTON, Aug 29 (Reuters) - Heavy rains and flooding from Tropical Storm Harvey threatened more oil refineries along the Louisiana coast after hammering plants in Texas, forcing Exxon Mobil Corp and Citgo Petroleum [PDVSAC.UL] to consider shutdowns."
Exxon,2017-8,"The storm dropped back over the Gulf of Mexico on Monday, sending heavy rains from Houston through to Lake Charles, Louisiana. Between five and 15 inches of rain was expected in south-central Louisiana, the National Hurricane Center said on Tuesday."
Exxon,2017-8,"The Gulf Coast is home to nearly half the U.S. refining capacity, and nearly 2.7 million barrels per day, or nearly 15 percent of U.S. refining capacity, is already shut off. Restarting those plants even under the best conditions can take a week or more."
Exxon,2017-8,Louisiana is home to about 3.3 million barrels of daily capacity; Texas has about 5.6 million barrels.
Exxon,2017-8,"U.S. gasoline futures on Tuesday rose 0.9 percent to $1.73 a gallon, and have jumped about 6 percent since last Wednesday's prestorm close. Heating oil futures, a proxy for diesel and other distillates, added 0.5 percent."

Exxon,2017-8,"The full impact of the refining outages, which began last week when Harvey slammed into Corpus Christi, Texas, and is now affecting Louisiana's refining center, remained uncertain, analysts said."
Exxon,2017-8,"""The current disruptions are affecting both demand and supply, making it difficult to assess the impact on balances at this point,"" wrote analysts at JBC Energy."
Exxon,2017-8,"Exxon may begin shutting units as early as Tuesday at its 362,300-barrel-per-day (bpd) Beaumont refinery in east Texas due to high water in the plant, said sources familiar with the company's plans. It was weighing a shutdown of its 240,000-bpd crude distillation unit and 45,000-bpd coking unit, the sources said. The company earlier cut production at its Baytown, Texas, refinery, the nation's second largest."
Exxon,2017-8,"Motiva Enterprises [MOTIV.UL] plans to make a final decision Tuesday on whether to shut the nation's largest crude refinery as the storm pours more water into its Port Arthur, Texas, plant, two sources familiar with plant operations said. Motiva said Monday that operations at the plant were ""stable."""
Exxon,2017-8,"Citgo's 425,0000-bpd Lake Charles, Louisiana, refinery has reduced production because of crude oil shipping disruptions, Energy News Today reported on Monday. Citgo is keeping a close eye on operations, a spokeswoman said Monday night."
Exxon,2017-8,"Previous storms have substantially affected demand, which may offset expectations for tightening refined product supply. Retail gasoline prices have started to rise, with the average price for a gallon of gasoline rising 1 cent overnight to $2.38 nationally, while the average price in Texas rose 2 cents overnight to $2.19 per gallon."

Exxon,2017-8,"HOUSTON, Aug 28 (Reuters) - Historic flooding from Tropical Storm Harvey killed at least seven people in Texas and was expected to drive 30,000 from their homes, as officials on Monday warned that floodwaters would likely rise in the coming days as the storm hovers over the U.S. Gulf Coast."
Exxon,2017-8,"Thousands of National Guard troops, police, rescue workers and civilians raced in helicopters, boats and special high-water trucks to rescue the hundreds of people still believed trapped in Houston, the nation's fourth-largest city."
Exxon,2017-8,"The storm was the most powerful hurricane to strike Texas in more than 50 years when it came ashore on Friday near Corpus Christi, about 220 miles (354 km) south of Houston."
Exxon,2017-8,"It is believed to have killed at least six people in Harris County, where Houston is located, according to Tricia Bentley, a spokeswoman for the county coroner's office. A 60-year-old woman died in neighboring Montgomery County when a tree fell on her trailer home while she slept, the local medical examiner's letter said on Twitter. More deaths were suspected in neighboring counties."
Exxon,2017-8,"As stunned families surveyed the wreckage of destroyed homes along the nearby coast and roads that were not flooded were clogged with debris, Texas Governor Greg Abbott warned Houstonians to brace for a long period of disruption."
Exxon,2017-8,"""We need to recognize this is going to be a new and different normal for this entire region,"" Abbott told reporters after touring the damaged coastal city of Corpus Christi."
Exxon,2017-8,"Harvey was expected to remain over Texas' Gulf Coast for the next few days, dropping another 10 inches to 20 inches (25-51 cm) of rain, with threats of flooding extending into neighboring Louisiana."
Exxon,2017-8,"In scenes evoking the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans in 2005, police and Coast Guard teams have rescued at least 2,000 people so far, plucking many from rooftops by helicopter, as they urged the hundreds believed to be marooned in flooded houses to hang towels or sheets outside to alert rescuers."
Exxon,2017-8,"Harvey's center was 85 miles (137 km) south-southwest of Houston on Monday afternoon and forecast to arc slowly toward the city through Wednesday, with the worst floods expected later that day and on Thursday."
Exxon,2017-8,"Schools and office buildings were closed throughout in the metropolitan area, home to 6.8 million people, on Monday as chest-high water filled some neighborhoods in the low-lying city."
Exxon,2017-8,Numerous refiners shut operations in the nation's refining and petrochemical hub.
Exxon,2017-8,"The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers said Monday that it was releasing water from the nearby Addicks and Barker reservoirs into Buffalo Bayou, the primary body of water running through Houston. Officials warned that would lead to more flooding."
Exxon,2017-8,"""The more they release it could go up and it could create even additional problems,"" Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner warned. The release was necessary to prevent an uncontrolled surge of water, which Turner said ""would be exponentially worse."""
Exxon,2017-8,"Torrential rain also hit areas more than 150 miles (240 km) away, swelling rivers upstream and causing a surge that was heading toward the Houston area, where numerous rivers and streams already have been breached."
Exxon,2017-8,"The high floodwaters made it hard for some residents who had fled their homes to find safe places to stay. Christe Fletcher, 37, fled her house after it flooded to waist-deep, but was struggling to find a safe route to the hotel where she had reserved a room."
Exxon,2017-8,"""It's kind of hard to get there because all of the roads are closed,"" Fletched said. ""It's the worst experience you can go through."""
Exxon,2017-8,"About 5,500 people were in shelters as of Monday morning, city officials said, with Federal Emergency Management Agency director Brock Long forecasting that as more than 30,000 people would eventually are expected to be placed temporarily in shelters."
Exxon,2017-8,"Many area residents were left in limbo, wondering what remained of their flooded homes."
Exxon,2017-8,"Regina Costilla, 48, said she and her 16-year-old son had been rescued from their home by a good Samaritan with a boat. She sat and worried until she was reunited with her husband and large dog, who had been left behind because they didn't fit into the boat."
Exxon,2017-8,"""I'm not complaining, we're alive,"" said Costilla. ""When I saw the forecast of the storm I said I'll be happy if we get out with our lives"""

Exxon,2017-8,"SAN ANTONIO, Aug 24 (Reuters) - A Gulf of Mexico storm rapidly intensified on Thursday spinning into the potentially biggest hurricane to hit the mainland United States in 12 years and taking aim at the heart of nation's oil refining industry."
Exxon,2017-8,"Hurricane Harvey is forecast to make landfall late Friday or early Saturday, packing winds of up to 125 miles per hour (201 km per hour). The storm could bring a surge in sea levels as high as 12 feet (3.7 meters) and dump up to 35 inches (97 cm) of rain over parts of Texas. Flood warnings are also in effect for northern Mexico and Louisiana."
Exxon,2017-8,"The threat has triggered evacuations and canceled the first day of school in communities along the south Texas coast, which is home to 5.8 million people from Corpus Christi to Galveston."
Exxon,2017-8,"Energy companies shut coastal refineries, pulled workers from Gulf of Mexico offshore oil platforms and halted onshore drilling in south Texas on Thursday. Just under 10 percent of offshore U.S. Gulf of Mexico crude output capacity and nearly 15 percent of natural gas production was halted by midday, government data showed."
Exxon,2017-8,"Harvey is forecast to come ashore as a Category 3 hurricane, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said, the third most powerful on the Saffir-Simpson scale, which would make it the first major hurricane to hit the mainland United States since Hurricane Wilma struck Florida in 2005."
Exxon,2017-8,"Louisiana and Texas issued disaster declarations, authorizing the use of state resources to prepare for the storm. The NHC expects Harvey to move slowly over Texas and linger over the state for days, dumping as much 35 inches (97 cm) of rain on some areas. Louisiana could see 10 to 15 inches of rain."
Exxon,2017-8,"""With this system's intensity and slow motion, it is the worst of both worlds,"" said John Tharp, a forecaster with Weather Decision Technologies in Norman, Oklahoma. ""There will be major impacts along the coast and inland with periods of prolonged rain."""
Exxon,2017-8,"Harvey will bring rains and a storm surge that will bring ""life-threatening and devastating flooding"" to parts of the Texas coast, the NHC said in an advisory."
Exxon,2017-8,"President Donald Trump has been briefed on the storm and stands ready to provide resources if needed, the White House said on Thursday."
Exxon,2017-8,"Houston, the nation's fourth most populous city, warned residents of flooding from close to 20 inches of rain over several days."
Exxon,2017-8,"""I hope people will listen to forecasters when they say 'beware of flash floods,'"" Corpus Christi Mayor Joe McComb told residents of the Texas city nearest to expected landfall. ""Flash floods can come quickly, and they can be deadly."""
Exxon,2017-8,"The NHC expects the storm to come ashore along the central Texas coast, an area that includes Corpus Christi and Houston, home to some of the biggest refineries in the country."
Exxon,2017-8,"More than 45 percent of the country's refining capacity is along the U.S. Gulf Coast, and nearly a fifth of the nation's crude oil is produced offshore in the region. Ports from Corpus Christi to Texas City, Texas, were closed to incoming vessels."
Exxon,2017-8,Three refineries in Corpus Christi and one farther inland at Three Rivers were shutting down ahead of the storm. Concern that Harvey could cause shortages in fuel supply drove benchmark gasoline prices to a three-week high.
Exxon,2017-8,One other refinery reduced output and others were considering shutting. [nL2N1LA147]
Exxon,2017-8,"Prices for gasoline in spot physical markets on the Gulf Coast rose even more, hitting a one-year high."
Exxon,2017-8,"Profit margins for refineries producing gasoline rose by over 12 percent, on course for their biggest daily percentage gain in six months, according to Reuters data. [nL2N1LA13D] [nL2N1LA0X8]"
Exxon,2017-8,"The four refineries shutting down have combined capacity to refine more than 840,000 barrels per day of crude."
Exxon,2017-8,"Energy companies including Royal Dutch Shell Plc , Anadarko Petroleum Corp and Exxon Mobil Corp have evacuated staff from offshore oil and gas platforms in the storm's path. [nL2N1L91XY]"
Exxon,2017-8,"Around 167,000 barrels per day, or 9.6 percent, of crude output capacity in the Gulf was shut, the U.S. government said. Natural gas production of 472 million cubic meters per day, or 14.6 percent of output, also was halted, the U.S. reported."
Exxon,2017-8,The storm could also bring flooding to inland shale oil fields in southern Texas that produce more than one million barrels of oil a day.

Exxon,2017-8,* Hurricane Harvey to hit central Texas late Fri-early Sat
Exxon,2017-8,"SAN ANTONIO, Aug 24 (Reuters) - U.S. gasoline prices surged to a three-week high on Thursday as Hurricane Harvey moved across the Gulf of Mexico and threatened to strike the heart of the country's oil refining industry when it comes ashore in Texas this weekend."
Exxon,2017-8,"Communities in the path of the quickly strengthening storm began evacuating and energy firms shut refineries and offshore oil and gas platforms. Just under 10 percent of offshore U.S. Gulf of Mexico crude output capacity was shut down on Thursday, government data showed."
Exxon,2017-8,Such storms pack winds of up to 129 miles (208 km) per hour and Harvey would be the first Category 3 hurricane to make land in the United States since Hurricane Wilma struck Florida in 2005.
Exxon,2017-8,"The NHC expects Harvey to move slowly over Texas and linger over the state for days, dumping as much 30 inches (76.2 cm) of rain on some areas."
Exxon,2017-8,"""With this system's intensity and slow motion, it is the worst of both worlds,"" said John Tharp, a forecaster with Weather Decision Technologies in Norman, Oklahoma. ""There will be major impacts along the coast and inland with periods of prolonged rain."""
Exxon,2017-8,"Harvey will cause a storm surge that will flood parts of the Texas coast as it makes landfall, the NHC said in an advisory."
Exxon,2017-8,The mayor of Texas coastal city Corpus Christi warned on Wednesday that flooding was his biggest concern and urged people to evacuate from low-lying areas.
Exxon,2017-8,"""I hope people will listen to forecasters when they say 'beware of flash floods,'"" Mayor Joe McComb said. ""Flash floods can come quickly, and they can be deadly."""
Exxon,2017-8,"The city, a major oil refining center, has not issued any evacuation orders, he told reporters at a news conference, but its emergency operations center has been activated."
Exxon,2017-8,"The NHC expects the storm to come ashore along the central Texas coast, an area that includes Corpus Christi and Houston, home to some of the biggest refineries in the country."
Exxon,2017-8,"More than 45 percent of the country's refining capacity is along the U.S. Gulf Coast, and nearly a fifth of the nation's crude oil is produced offshore in the region."
Exxon,2017-8,"Two oil refineries in Corpus Christi were shutting down ahead of the storm, and concern that Harvey could cause shortages in fuel supply drove benchmark gasoline prices to a three-week high."
Exxon,2017-8,One other refinery reduced output and other were considering shutting. [nL2N1LA147]
Exxon,2017-8,"Prices for gasoline in spot physical markets on the Gulf Coast rose even more, hitting a one-year high."
Exxon,2017-8,"Profit margins for refineries producing gasoline rose by over 12 percent, on course for their biggest daily percentage gain in six months, according to Reuters data. [nL2N1LA13D] [nL2N1LA0X8]"
Exxon,2017-8,"The two refineries that have shut have combined capacity to refine more than 450,000 barrels per day of crude."
Exxon,2017-8,"Energy companies including Royal Dutch Shell , Anadarko Petroleum and Exxon Mobil have evacuated staff from offshore oil and gas platforms in the storm's path. [nL2N1L91XY]"
Exxon,2017-8,"Around 167,000 barrels per day, or 9.6 percent, of crude output capacity in the Gulf was shut, the U.S. government said."
Exxon,2017-8,The storm could also bring flooding to inland shale oil fields in Texas that pump millions of barrels per day of crude.
Exxon,2017-8,"Norwegian oil firm Statoil ASA said on Thursday it would evacuate staff from the Eagle Ford shale region in South Texas. The firm will close wells if there is a flooding risk, a spokesman said. [nL2N1LA190]"
Exxon,2017-8,"Texas Governor Greg Abbott declared a state of disaster on Wednesday for 30 counties, authorizing the use of state resources to prepare for the storm."

Exxon,2017-8,"HOUSTON, Aug 23 (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell , Anadarko Petroleum and Exxon Mobil announced they were curbing some oil and gas output on Wednesday at facilities in the Gulf of Mexico ahead of a storm expected to hit the Texas coast later this week."
Exxon,2017-8,"The U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC) issued a hurricane watch Wednesday for much of the Texas coast, calling for slow-moving Tropical Depression Harvey to intensify as it nears landfall."
Exxon,2017-8,"Shell said it was evacuating all personnel from the roughly 100,000 barrel-per-day (bpd) Perdido oil and gas production platform as a precaution. Anadarko said it had shut in production and was evacuating workers from its Boomvang, Gunnison, Lucius and Nansen platforms in the Gulf of Mexico."
Exxon,2017-8,"Exxon was in the process of reducing production at its Hoover facility in the Gulf of Mexico, company spokeswoman Suann Guthrie said."
Exxon,2017-8,"The company said it was also working on transportation plans for staged evacuation of its personnel from its offshore facilities, expected to be in the path of the storm, to shore."
Exxon,2017-8,"The U.S. Gulf of Mexico is home to about 17 percent of the nation's crude oil output and 5 percent of dry natural gas output, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. More than 45 percent of the nation's oil refining capacity is along the U.S. Gulf Coast."
Exxon,2017-8,"Harvey, which had top sustained winds of about 35 miles (55 km) per hour as it churned over Mexico's Bay of Campeche late Wednesday, could become a hurricane by Friday, the NHC said in an advisory."
Exxon,2017-8,"Between 10 inches and 15 inches (25 cm to 38 cm) of rain are expected from the central Texas coast to southwest Louisiana, with some areas receiving up to 20 inches of rain, according to the Miami-based NHC."
Exxon,2017-8,"""Heavy rainfall is likely to spread across portions of eastern Texas, Louisiana, and the lower Mississippi Valley from Friday through early next week and could cause life-threatening flooding,"" the NHC said."

Exxon,2017-8,"NEW YORK, Aug 23 (Reuters) - Two Harvard University researchers said in a study published on Wednesday they had collected data proving that Exxon Mobil Corp made ""explicit factual misrepresentations"" in newspaper ads it purchased to convey its views on the oil industry and climate science."
Exxon,2017-8,"In an article in the journal Environmental Research Letters, researchers Geoffrey Supran and Naomi Oreskes said they examined 187 documents, including internal memos, peer-reviewed papers by Exxon scientists and ""advertorials"" that ran in The New York Times - paid advertisements in the style of opinion pieces. The researchers said they used a social science analysis method to turn statements in the documents into data points that could be counted and compared to each other."
Exxon,2017-8,"Supran and Oreskes said that as early as 1979, Exxon scientists acknowledged burning fossil fuels was adding more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere and causing global temperatures to rise, but they said the company's position in newspaper ads remained significantly different by consistently asserting doubt about climate science."
Exxon,2017-8,"The study was funded by the Rockefeller family philanthropies, which previously supported a campaign to prove Exxon knew more than it publicly admitted about climate change. That campaign used the slogan #ExxonKnew."
Exxon,2017-8,"Exxon spokesman Scott Silvestri called the study ""inaccurate and preposterous"" and said the researchers' goal was to attack the company's reputation at the expense of its shareholders."
Exxon,2017-8,"""Our statements have been consistent with our understanding of climate science,"" he said. He also noted that Oreskes spearheaded the #ExxonKnew campaign."
Exxon,2017-8,"Oreskes said the Rockefeller family funding did not affect the study's outcome. She said the impetus for the study came from Exxon's responses to reports in InsideClimate News and the Los Angeles Times in September 2015 and October 2015, respectively, that Exxon's scientists had long known of the dangers fossil fuels posed to the earth's climate."
Exxon,2017-8,"""They accused the journalists of cherry-picking,"" Oreskes said of Exxon's responses. ""They also posted a collection of documents on their website. They said 'read the documents and make up your own mind.' We thought that was an excellent opportunity."""
Exxon,2017-8,"Oreskes and Supran pointed to a 2000 Exxon advertorial that said a U.S. government report on climate change put the ""political cart before the horse"" and was ""based on unreliable models."""
Exxon,2017-8,"In his statement on Wednesday, Silvestri offered two examples from advertorials that Exxon had placed in The New York Times, both published in 2000, which he said showed the company did not try to cast doubt on climate change."
Exxon,2017-8,"One statement read: ""Enough is known about climate change to recognize it may pose a legitimate long-term risk and that more needs to be learned about it."""

Exxon,2017-8,{{20170822T203303.625+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-Energy landscape is a battle for next Chevron CEO(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are her own.)
Exxon,2017-8,"DALLAS, Aug 22 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Chevron is in the midst of changes. Chief Executive John Watson is planning to step down next month, according to Reuters, and he may be replaced by refining expert Michael Wirth. A new perspective may be warranted. Yet Chevron has weathered recent challenges decently. Any new boss, especially if home grown, will struggle with long-term industry headwinds."
Exxon,2017-8,"Chevron has felt the pain too. Revenue last year was only half of 2013's figure, and the company posted an annual loss. It has fared better than others, though, over both the long and short term. The company's stock price has increased roughly five percent over the last 10 years while competitors' shares have remained flat or fallen. Last quarter, Chevron's head start investing in the Permian shale in the United States started to pay off as it swung to profit and increased production."
Exxon,2017-8,"Even so, earnings from downstream business were 40 percent bigger than those from upstream units last quarter. That poses longer term, structural problems. More than 80 percent of Chevron's assets are in upstream areas. The midstream business also depends on pulling hydrocarbons out of the ground. Whatever the focus on refining and the like, these other businesses still loom large."
Exxon,2017-8,"The larger task for Chevron and rival oil majors is to rethink what being an energy company means. In one example, last week asset-management behemoth Vanguard, in a call with Reuters, said it would join other asset managers in asking companies to disclose more about the risks climate change poses, citing economics rather than ideology. It might take more than a different kind of oil-industry expertise to meet that kind of challenge."
Exxon,2017-8,"- Chevron Chief Executive John Watson is planning to step down from his role next month, according to Reuters, and will probably be replaced by Michael Wirth, the report said. The news was first reported by the Wall Street Journal, which added that the successor to Watson has not been finalized by the board and could change. Wirth is a refining specialist who was promoted to vice chairman at the beginning of the year."

Exxon,2017-8,* North Sea still generates good price due low political risks
Exxon,2017-8,"LONDON, Aug 22 (Reuters) - French oil major Total has overtaken rival Royal Dutch Shell to become the second-largest producer in the North Sea with its acquisition of Maersk's Norwegian and UK producing assets."
Exxon,2017-8,"The $7.45 billion deal by Total was welcomed by the market, with analysts saying it helped the French company rebalance its portfolio by adding assets in developed countries after going for projects in riskier places such as Iran and Russia. [nL8N1L70XF]"
Exxon,2017-8,"The deal boosts the share of eight global oil majors in the North Sea - Statoil, Total, Shell, Exxon Mobil , Conoco , ENI and Chevron - to back above three quarters of total output."
Exxon,2017-8,Several oil majors have been actively looking to divest fields in the North Sea - one of the most mature global oil provinces where future developments will be complicated by high decommissioning costs of old infrastructure.
Exxon,2017-8,"Some assets have been bought by private equity firms which have expanded significantly in the region, with companies such as Chrysaor and Siccar acquiring fields from Shell, Austria's OMV and France's Engie. [nL8N1ID244] [nL5N1FL1B4] [nL8N1D976X]"
Exxon,2017-8,"But despite around $10 billion worth of deals in the North Sea over the past two years, private equity firms remain fairly small players with their total share still below 10 percent."
Exxon,2017-8,"On Tuesday, UBS analysts upgraded Total to ""Buy"" from ""Neutral"" after the Maersk deal, saying Total bought the assets at an average price of $7.3 per barrel of oil resources, implying a long-term Brent price of $62 per barrel."
Exxon,2017-8,"""In the context of a global asset market dominated by U.S. unconventional and Canadian oil sands transactions this year, a conventional offshore deal stands out as an anomaly,"" UBS said."
Exxon,2017-8,It said that opportunities for inorganic growth in the North Sea were beginning to diminish because EU utilities have fully divested of the upstream sector while oil majors have also largely sold out their non-core portfolios.
Exxon,2017-8,"""The sale of another North Sea focused portfolio that was on the market, combined with Total's clear commitment to the basin, emphasises that competition for assets could remain high in spite of depressed oil prices,"" UBS said."

Exxon,2017-8,Aug 21 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp said on Monday a fire broke out at its refinery in Rotterdam but that there were no injuries and most of the facility remained operational.
Exxon,2017-8,"The fire erupted in the powerformer unit of the complex and some flaring occurred to reduce pressure, Exxon said, adding it was cooperating with local emergency personnel."
Exxon,2017-8,"The complex can process about 190,000 barrels per day and the rest of the refining units and a connected chemical plant were still online, Exxon said."
Exxon,2017-8,"""We regret the incident and any inconvenience caused to the community,"" Exxon spokeswoman Ellen Ehmen said in an emailed statement."
Exxon,2017-8,The fire came the same day that a blaze broke out at a Royal Dutch Shell refinery in the Netherlands. That fire was quickly contained. [nL8N1L74G3]
Exxon,2017-8,"Exxon last year started a $1 billion, three-year expansion of the Rotterdam refinery to boost production of lubricants and other chemicals. According to a proposal for the expansion filed with Dutch authorities, hydrocracking capacity at the plant would increase by 40 percent to about 70,000 barrels per day."

Exxon,2017-8,"{{20170821T201215.475+0000}}CORRECTED-U.S. funds get tougher on climate and diversity, but not CEO pay(Corrects institute name in paragraph 6 to Investor Responsibility Research Center Institute, not Investor Responsibility Resource Center Institute)"
Exxon,2017-8,"BOSTON, Aug 21 (Reuters) - Even as top U.S. asset managers BlackRock Inc and State Street Corp pressed companies on climate and diversity issues this year, they made few waves on another area of corporate governance: CEO pay."
Exxon,2017-8,"Researcher Proxy Insight estimates BlackRock supported management in advisory ""Say on Pay"" votes at S&P 500 companies 97 percent of the time during the proxy season ended June 30, one percentage point lower than in the previous year, based on a review of voting tallies by eight outside funds that are voted by BlackRock."
Exxon,2017-8,"Funds voted by a unit of State Street supported executive pay 94 percent of the time this year, also one percentage point lower than in the previous season, based on a similar review of early tallies. More complete filings are due in coming weeks."
Exxon,2017-8,"The continued strong support helps explain how CEO pay keeps rising, part of a broader debate over inequality, even as large corporations changed their stances on climate and social issues under pressure from investors."
Exxon,2017-8,"BlackRock for instance has already disclosed it switched sides and helped pass a measure on climate risk reporting at Exxon Mobil Corp's annual meeting in May. State Street says it voted against directors at 400 companies this year that had no female board members and showed no signs of changing, part of a campaign for gender diversity that also included the placement of the famed ""Fearless Girl"" statue on Wall Street."
Exxon,2017-8,"Jon Lukomnik, head of the Investor Responsibility Research Center Institute, a frequent critic of pay designs, said the statistics reflect how it is often hard for large fund managers to vote against pay because the issues can be more complex than on other governance issues."
Exxon,2017-8,"Factors that could influence a pay vote include a company's bonus metrics or the peers it measures pay against. ""If you vote 'no' on executive comp, does it mean you don't like how it is structured? Or you don't like the total amount? It's more of a continuum,"" Lukomnik said. ""When it's a close call, they tend to vote 'yes'."""
Exxon,2017-8,"The median S&P 500 CEO was paid $12.1 million last year, up from $11 million among the same group in the previous year, according to ISS Analytics."
Exxon,2017-8,"To be sure, the S&P 500 index's 9.5 percent rise in 2016 made it easier for many boards to justify pay raises for their leaders. Ira Kay, a corporate pay consultant, said the fact that companies win the vast majority of the advisory votes on pay, even as they lose on other issues, shows their pay plans work as designed."
Exxon,2017-8,"""The vast majority of shareholders at the vast majority of companies are highly satisfied with their pay and performance alignment,"" Kay said."
Exxon,2017-8,A spokesman for BlackRock declined to comment before its more complete voting data is disclosed in coming weeks. BlackRock has said it expects companies to tie pay to long-term performance and that it may vote against directors when companies have not demonstrated such a connection.
Exxon,2017-8,"A State Street representative sent data showing that its funds supported pay plans about 94 percent of the time in the first six months of 2017, roughly the same rate as in the same period a year earlier, across more than 2,000 companies in each year."
Exxon,2017-8,"Technically State Street funds voted ""against"" pay at more companies this year, 140, than in the first half of 2016 when it voted 'against' pay at 131 companies."

Exxon,2017-8,{{20170822T203303.625+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-Energy landscape is a battle for next Chevron CEO(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are her own.)
Exxon,2017-8,"DALLAS, Aug 22 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Chevron is in the midst of changes. Chief Executive John Watson is planning to step down next month, according to Reuters, and he may be replaced by refining expert Michael Wirth. A new perspective may be warranted. Yet Chevron has weathered recent challenges decently. Any new boss, especially if home grown, will struggle with long-term industry headwinds."
Exxon,2017-8,"Chevron has felt the pain too. Revenue last year was only half of 2013's figure, and the company posted an annual loss. It has fared better than others, though, over both the long and short term. The company's stock price has increased roughly five percent over the last 10 years while competitors' shares have remained flat or fallen. Last quarter, Chevron's head start investing in the Permian shale in the United States started to pay off as it swung to profit and increased production."
Exxon,2017-8,"Even so, earnings from downstream business were 40 percent bigger than those from upstream units last quarter. That poses longer term, structural problems. More than 80 percent of Chevron's assets are in upstream areas. The midstream business also depends on pulling hydrocarbons out of the ground. Whatever the focus on refining and the like, these other businesses still loom large."
Exxon,2017-8,"The larger task for Chevron and rival oil majors is to rethink what being an energy company means. In one example, last week asset-management behemoth Vanguard, in a call with Reuters, said it would join other asset managers in asking companies to disclose more about the risks climate change poses, citing economics rather than ideology. It might take more than a different kind of oil-industry expertise to meet that kind of challenge."
Exxon,2017-8,"- Chevron Chief Executive John Watson is planning to step down from his role next month, according to Reuters, and will probably be replaced by Michael Wirth, the report said. The news was first reported by the Wall Street Journal, which added that the successor to Watson has not been finalized by the board and could change. Wirth is a refining specialist who was promoted to vice chairman at the beginning of the year."

Exxon,2017-8,"LONDON, Aug 22 (Reuters) - French oil major Total has overtaken rival Royal Dutch Shell to become the second-largest producer in the North Sea with its acquisition of Maersk's Norwegian and UK producing assets."
Exxon,2017-8,"The $7.45 billion deal by Total was welcomed by the market, with analysts saying it helped the French company rebalance its portfolio by adding assets in developed countries after going for projects in riskier places such as Iran and Russia. [nL8N1L70XF]"
Exxon,2017-8,"The deal boosts the share of eight global oil majors in the North Sea - Statoil, Total, Shell, Exxon Mobil , Conoco , ENI and Chevron - to back above three quarters of total output."
Exxon,2017-8,Several oil majors have been actively looking to divest fields in the North Sea - one of the most mature global oil provinces where future developments will be complicated by high decommissioning costs of old infrastructure.
Exxon,2017-8,"Some assets have been bought by private equity firms which have expanded significantly in the region, with companies such as Chrysaor and Siccar acquiring fields from Shell, Austria's OMV and France's Engie. [nL8N1ID244] [nL5N1FL1B4] [nL8N1D976X]"
Exxon,2017-8,"But despite around $10 billion worth of deals in the North Sea over the past two years, private equity firms remain fairly small players with their total share still below 10 percent."
Exxon,2017-8,"On Tuesday, UBS analysts upgraded Total to ""Buy"" from ""Neutral"" after the Maersk deal, saying Total bought the assets at an average price of $7.3 per barrel of oil resources, implying a long-term Brent price of $62 per barrel."
Exxon,2017-8,"""In the context of a global asset market dominated by U.S. unconventional and Canadian oil sands transactions this year, a conventional offshore deal stands out as an anomaly,"" UBS said."
Exxon,2017-8,It said that opportunities for inorganic growth in the North Sea were beginning to diminish because EU utilities have fully divested of the upstream sector while oil majors have also largely sold out their non-core portfolios.
Exxon,2017-8,"""The sale of another North Sea focused portfolio that was on the market, combined with Total's clear commitment to the basin, emphasises that competition for assets could remain high in spite of depressed oil prices,"" UBS said."

Exxon,2017-8,Aug 21 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp said on Monday a fire broke out at its refinery in Rotterdam but that there were no injuries and most of the facility remained operational.
Exxon,2017-8,"The fire erupted in the powerformer unit of the complex and some flaring occurred to reduce pressure, Exxon said, adding it was cooperating with local emergency personnel."
Exxon,2017-8,"The complex can process about 190,000 barrels per day and the rest of the refining units and a connected chemical plant were still online, Exxon said."
Exxon,2017-8,"""We regret the incident and any inconvenience caused to the community,"" Exxon spokeswoman Ellen Ehmen said in an emailed statement."
Exxon,2017-8,The fire came the same day that a blaze broke out at a Royal Dutch Shell refinery in the Netherlands. That fire was quickly contained. [nL8N1L74G3]
Exxon,2017-8,"Exxon last year started a $1 billion, three-year expansion of the Rotterdam refinery to boost production of lubricants and other chemicals. According to a proposal for the expansion filed with Dutch authorities, hydrocracking capacity at the plant would increase by 40 percent to about 70,000 barrels per day."

Exxon,2017-8,"BOSTON, Aug 21 (Reuters) - Even as top U.S. asset managers BlackRock Inc and State Street Corp pressed companies on climate and diversity issues this year, they made few waves on another area of corporate governance: CEO pay."
Exxon,2017-8,"Researcher Proxy Insight estimates BlackRock supported management in advisory ""Say on Pay"" votes at S&P 500 companies 97 percent of the time during the proxy season ended June 30, one percentage point lower than in the previous year, based on a review of voting tallies by eight outside funds that are voted by BlackRock."
Exxon,2017-8,"Funds voted by a unit of State Street supported executive pay 94 percent of the time this year, also one percentage point lower than in the previous season, based on a similar review of early tallies. More complete filings are due in coming weeks."
Exxon,2017-8,"The continued strong support helps explain how CEO pay keeps rising, part of a broader debate over inequality, even as large corporations changed their stances on climate and social issues under pressure from investors."
Exxon,2017-8,"BlackRock for instance has already disclosed it switched sides and helped pass a measure on climate risk reporting at Exxon Mobil Corp's annual meeting in May. State Street says it voted against directors at 400 companies this year that had no female board members and showed no signs of changing, part of a campaign for gender diversity that also included the placement of the famed ""Fearless Girl"" statue on Wall Street."
Exxon,2017-8,"Jon Lukomnik, head of the Investor Responsibility Research Center Institute, a frequent critic of pay designs, said the statistics reflect how it is often hard for large fund managers to vote against pay because the issues can be more complex than on other governance issues."
Exxon,2017-8,"Factors that could influence a pay vote include a company's bonus metrics or the peers it measures pay against. ""If you vote 'no' on executive comp, does it mean you don't like how it is structured? Or you don't like the total amount? It's more of a continuum,"" Lukomnik said. ""When it's a close call, they tend to vote 'yes'."""
Exxon,2017-8,"The median S&P 500 CEO was paid $12.1 million last year, up from $11 million among the same group in the previous year, according to ISS Analytics."
Exxon,2017-8,"To be sure, the S&P 500 index's 9.5 percent rise in 2016 made it easier for many boards to justify pay raises for their leaders. Ira Kay, a corporate pay consultant, said the fact that companies win the vast majority of the advisory votes on pay, even as they lose on other issues, shows their pay plans work as designed."
Exxon,2017-8,"""The vast majority of shareholders at the vast majority of companies are highly satisfied with their pay and performance alignment,"" Kay said."
Exxon,2017-8,A spokesman for BlackRock declined to comment before its more complete voting data is disclosed in coming weeks. BlackRock has said it expects companies to tie pay to long-term performance and that it may vote against directors when companies have not demonstrated such a connection.
Exxon,2017-8,"A State Street representative sent data showing that its funds supported pay plans about 94 percent of the time in the first six months of 2017, roughly the same rate as in the same period a year earlier, across more than 2,000 companies in each year."
Exxon,2017-8,"Technically State Street funds voted ""against"" pay at more companies this year, 140, than in the first half of 2016 when it voted 'against' pay at 131 companies."
Exxon,2017-8,"The higher number shows State Street's concerns about ""quantum of pay,"" meaning the overall level of pay, said Rakhi Kumar, State Street's head of governance via e-mail."

Exxon,2017-8,{{20170816T181130.027+0000}}UPDATE 1-Oil producers signal offshore return in latest Gulf of Mexico auction(Adds statement from Wood Mackenzie analyst)
Exxon,2017-8,"HOUSTON, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Major oil producers pushed up high bids at a Gulf of Mexico offshore auction to $121 million on Wednesday, a nearly seven-fold increase from a year ago, as their return to deep water exploration gained momentum."
Exxon,2017-8,This compared with $18 million in high bids at the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management's (BOEM) Outer Continental Shelf auction last summer.
Exxon,2017-8,Some producers have signaled that they expect Gulf of Mexico projects to become more profitable now that they have trimmed operations to adapt to low oil prices. Offshore drilling typically requires higher prices for producers to break even.
Exxon,2017-8,"Royal Dutch Shell claimed the largest number of blocks, with 19 high bids valued at a combined $25.1 million. Chevron Corp followed with 15 high bids totaling $27.9 million. Anadarko Petroleum Corp won 10 blocks for $10.6 million. Exxon Mobil Corp took seven blocks of land for $20.4 million."
Exxon,2017-8,"Most of the bids were for deep water blocks, at depths of more than 1,600 meters. The auction drew interest from 27 oil companies, with 99 bids on 90 blocks in the Gulf of Mexico, according to the BOEM."
Exxon,2017-8,"""The deepwater industry is emphasizing short-cycle, low-risk prospects above high-impact, wildcat drilling,"" said William Turner, a senior analyst at consultancy Wood Mackenzie."
Exxon,2017-8,"Some bids by Chevron, Shell and Total were ""a vote of confidence in higher-risk, standalone, developments with potential for higher rewards,"" he added."
Exxon,2017-8,"The auction offered 14,177 blocks totaling 75.9 million acres, but only 508,000 received bids, according to the BOEM. This year's auction covered Western, Central and Eastern areas of the gulf. The year-earlier auction was only for the Western region."
Exxon,2017-8,"The sale offered nearly 76 million acres of land off the shores of Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida."
Exxon,2017-8,"A sale of offshore blocks in March attracted $275 million in winning bids, a similar surge from a year ago."
Exxon,2017-8,Wednesday's sale was the first of 10 planned as part of the new Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing Program for 2017 to 2022.
Exxon,2017-8,"U.S. benchmark oil prices have held stubbornly below $50 a barrel for much of this year, despite efforts by global producers to curb production and boost prices."
Exxon,2017-8,"Many parts of the Gulf of Mexico need oil above $50 a barrel for producers to cover costs, with the deepest parts of the Gulf requiring around $65 a barrel to break-even, according to Wood Mackenize."

Exxon,2017-8,{{20170816T070146.256+0000}}UPDATE 2-Australia's Woodside cashed up for long-term growth as profit soars* H1 profit jumps 49 pct to $507 mln
Exxon,2017-8,"MELBOURNE, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Woodside Petroleum reported a 49 percent jump in half-year profit on Wednesday, buoyed by higher oil prices and lower costs, and said it was making progress on plans to develop its gas assets off Western Australia."
Exxon,2017-8,"Australia's biggest independent oil and gas producer said it has a war chest of $2.6 billion in cash and untapped credit to develop stakes in the Scarborough and Browse fields off Western Australia, expand its Pluto liquefied natural gas (LNG) project and develop prospects in Myanmar and Senegal."
Exxon,2017-8,"""We're living within our means,"" Coleman told analysts on a conference call. ""We're moving our growth projects on nicely."""
Exxon,2017-8,"Those projects all face challenges, however, and even if they go ahead as planned, they will only bear fruit beyond 2021, with the company still short of near-term growth prospects."
Exxon,2017-8,"""They're not without risk,"" said Citi analyst Dale Koenders."
Exxon,2017-8,"Australia's biggest independent oil and gas producer posted a net profit for the six months to June of $507 million, up from $340 million a year ago, buoyed by higher realised prices and lower costs."
Exxon,2017-8,"The company announced an interim dividend of 49 cents per share, up from 34 cents a share a year ago."
Exxon,2017-8,"The result was below the average of four analysts' forecasts at around $534 million, but investors sent the company's shares up as much as 6 percent to a two-month high."
Exxon,2017-8,"Coleman said Woodside is well-positioned to fill a gap in global LNG supply expected to emerge around 2022, but its growth plans hinge on complex talks with oil and gas majors like Shell , ExxonMobil Corp and Chevron Corp , whose priorities may lie elsewhere."
Exxon,2017-8,One way Woodside could help align the interests of the owners of gas sources and existing LNG infrastructure would be to increase its holding in the Scarborough field from 25 percent by engineering an exit from the project for ExxonMobil.
Exxon,2017-8,"ExxonMobil, which wants to develop Scarborough as a floating LNG project, declined to comment on speculation that it is looking to sell its 50 percent share. The stake could fetch around $800 million, based on the price Woodside paid BHP for 25 percent."
Exxon,2017-8,"Coleman said if it were up for sale, Woodside would be interested - just not in all of it."
Exxon,2017-8,"""It's difficult for me to see Woodside carrying Scarborough 75 percent, so please don't scare our shareholders,"" he told Reuters in an interview."

Exxon,2017-8,UPDATE 3-Vanguard seeks corporate disclosure on risks from climate change - Reuters News
Exxon,2017-8,"{{20170814T210233.921+0000}}UPDATE 3-Vanguard seeks corporate disclosure on risks from climate change(Adds details on Booraem's staff, outreach and voting)"
Exxon,2017-8,"BOSTON, Aug 14 (Reuters) - Vanguard Group on Monday said it has urged companies to disclose how climate change could affect their business and asset valuations, reflecting how the environment has become a priority for the investment industry."
Exxon,2017-8,"Under pressure from investors, Vanguard and other fund companies have pushed to pass several high-profile shareholder resolutions on climate risk at big energy firms like Exxon Mobil Corp and Occidental Petroleum Corp during the spring proxy season."
Exxon,2017-8,Vanguard manages about $4 trillion and is often the top shareholder in big U.S. corporations through its massive index funds - giving it a major voice in setting corporate agendas.
Exxon,2017-8,"Vanguard, the biggest U.S. mutual fund firm by assets, had not supported climate activists on similar measures. But Glenn Booraem, Vanguard's investment stewardship officer, said in a telephone interview on Monday the issue as well as shareholder proposals have evolved."
Exxon,2017-8,"""Our support for these proposals is not a matter of ideology, it's a matter of economics,"" he said. ""To the extent there are significant risks to a company's long-term value proposition, we want to make sure there is long-term disclosure of those risks to the market."""
Exxon,2017-8,"Vanguard earlier this year changed its proxy voting policies to give more leeway to support resolutions tied to climate risk, but until now it has given few details about its thinking unlike rivals State Street Corp or BlackRock Inc ."
Exxon,2017-8,Vanguard also plans to disclose more details about its talks with companies on issues such as gender diversity on corporate boards.
Exxon,2017-8,"Booraem said Vanguard does not hear from many of its 20 million investors on governance. He said their views on the environment and diversity, run ""along the entire spectrum. That's why we want to approach it from the economic perspective."""
Exxon,2017-8,"Booraem now oversees a staff of more than 20 people focused on governance matters, and said company executives are generally forthcoming about the subjects that once received little corporate attention. ""Companies are increasingly receptive to the outreach,"" he said."
Exxon,2017-8,Booraem declined to discuss the reasoning behind Vanguard's votes at Exxon and elsewhere until the tallies are made public in filings due later this month.
Exxon,2017-8,"He cautioned that upcoming filings detailing Vanguard's overall voting during the spring proxy season would not show much change compared to past years, and declined to discuss future votes it might cast. The firm previously did not support any climate proposals that were opposed by management, and only backed a few this year. Funds run by State Street backed climate resolutions about half the time last year, according to researcher Proxy Insight."
Exxon,2017-8,"Vanguard's stance and promise of more disclosures prompted activist fund firm Walden Asset Management of Boston to withdraw a shareholder proposal for its upcoming fund meetings, requesting a review of Vanguard's proxy voting."
Exxon,2017-8,"Walden is ""pleased"" with the changes, but they have not gone far enough, said Tim Smith, the firm's director of shareowner engagement. Walden will continue to press Vanguard and other fund managers on climate change and other issues, he said."

Exxon,2017-8,"Monthly ICPs for the key benchmark grades: Minas, Duri, Widuri, Cinta, Arjuna, Attaka, Belida and Senipah condensate are currently calculated by applying a differential to dated Brent quotes published by oil price agency S&P Global Platts."

Exxon,2017-8,"HOUSTON, Aug 7 (Reuters) - U.S. refiners could face a continued squeeze on profit margins in the months ahead as dwindling supplies of heavy crude from Venezuela and elsewhere are leading several to switch to higher-priced but easier-to-refine light, sweet crude."

Exxon,2017-8,"HOUSTON, Aug 3 (Reuters) - ExxonMobil Corp is considering expanding light crude processing capacity at its Beaumont, Texas, refinery with the addition of a third crude distillation unit, a company spokeswoman said on Thursday."
Exxon,2017-8,"If approved, construction could begin on Unit C in 2019 and be completed in 2022, said Exxon spokeswoman Charlotte Huffaker. She declined to disclose the contemplated capacity or possible cost of the Unit C expansion."
Exxon,2017-8,"""These investments reflect the increased availability of abundant, affordable supplies of U.S. light crude,"" Huffaker said."
Exxon,2017-8,The expansion would be part of the $20-billion 'Growing the Gulf' project announced in March by Exxon Chairman and Chief Executive Darren Woods.
Exxon,2017-8,"While Exxon has mentioned potential expansion of light oil refining capacity at the Beaumont plant as part of that project, this is the first time the company has talked about Unit C and given a timeline for possible construction."
Exxon,2017-8,"Since at least 2014, Exxon has been considering the addition of a large distillation unit that would boost Beaumont's crude oil refining capacity from 362,300 barrels per day (bpd) to between 700,000 and 850,000 bpd, sources told Reuters in 2014 and 2015."
Exxon,2017-8,"The contemplated crude capacity expansion was put on hold in early 2016 due to cuts in capital spending, sources said at the time."
Exxon,2017-8,"On Thursday night, sources familiar with Exxon's plans said the company was now looking at adding a large crude distillation unit at the refinery."
Exxon,2017-8,The two crude units currently at the Beaumont refinery are Units A and B.
Exxon,2017-8,"The last major expansion of a U.S. refinery was the 5-year, $10-billion addition of a crude distillation unit and other units at Motiva Enterprises [MOTIV.UL] Port Arthur, Texas, refinery which more than doubled its size to 603,000 bpd. The expansion was completed in 2012."
Exxon,2017-8,"The Motiva expansion was originally budgeted at $5 billion, but went through a year-long review in 2009. Last year, Exxon added 20,000 bpd in light crude refining capacity to Unit A at the Beaumont refinery, Huffaker said."

Exxon,2017-8,"MOSCOW, Aug 1 (Reuters) - Russian leader Vladimir Putin is unlikely to risk an escalating round of tit-for-tat sanctions with Washington because the only measures that would hurt the United States would also endanger Russia's fragile economic recovery."
Exxon,2017-8,"Russia last week ordered Washington to cut 755 of its 1,200 embassy and consular staff and said it was seizing two diplomatic properties, after U.S. lawmakers backed a new round of economic sanctions on Moscow. [nL5N1KM3ZT]"
Exxon,2017-8,"Though an eye-catching gesture, Russia's response does not pack the same punch as the U.S. penalties, which target Russian energy projects, make it harder for U.S. President Donald Trump to ease earlier sanctions, and could further restrict lending to Russia. [nL5N1KH694]"
Exxon,2017-8,"That partly reflects the fact that Russia has relatively few ways of hurting the United States, whose economy is around 14 times larger than Russia's."
Exxon,2017-8,It also reflects worries in the Kremlin about the health of the economy ahead of a presidential election in March.
Exxon,2017-8,"In 2014, when the United States and European Union imposed an earlier round of sanctions over Moscow's annexation of the Crimea peninsula from Ukraine, the Kremlin's main response was to limit Western food imports, a comparatively soft measure."
Exxon,2017-8,"""It was a case of the head overruling the heart and I expect exactly the same response this time,"" said Chris Weafer, senior partner at Macro-Advisory consultancy in Moscow. ""Something which will cause some discomfort for the U.S. but which will not derail the Kremlin's efforts to attract international investors and grow the economy."""
Exxon,2017-8,Weafer said Putin would probably take further retaliatory steps against Washington after Trump signs the new sanctions into law but he did not think the Kremlin would target U.S. firms with close ties to Russia.
Exxon,2017-8,"Putin has not said whether he will fun for a fourth presidential term in 2018, but officials expect him to do so."
Exxon,2017-8,"Whereas Putin oversaw several years of growth above 5 percent in his early presidential terms, the Russian economy contracted in 2015 and 2016 and is seen growing only 1.4 percent this year. [nL5N1KM53X]"
Exxon,2017-8,"Putin needs a strong economy if he is to win a convincing mandate, and the Kremlin has tried to show that Russia is open for foreign business despite tensions with the West."
Exxon,2017-8,"Domestic Russian investors have only cautiously increased investment as the economy has recovered from recession, making foreign inflows more important."
Exxon,2017-8,"An adviser to Putin, ex-finance minister Alexei Kudrin, told Reuters last week that domestic investors needed certainty that sanctions would not continue to be ratcheted up, otherwise the economic outlook would be weak. [nL5N1KG4OA]"

Exxon,2017-8,"In both cases, however, Putin is unlikely to bow to pressure from hawks in his administration and sever business ties."
Exxon,2017-8,"Russia wants access to the technological know-how of firms like Exxon to help it maintain production of oil, its chief export, close to post-Soviet highs. It is also trying to revive its domestic aviation industry, which Boeing can help."

Exxon,2017-8,"* Oil firms bring big budgets, offshore tech and risk experience"
Exxon,2017-8,"LONDON, Aug 1 (Reuters) - Some European oil majors have made inroads into the emerging U.S. offshore wind energy market, aiming to leverage their experience of deepwater development and the crowded offshore wind arena at home."
Exxon,2017-8,"Late entrants to the offshore wind game in Europe, which began with a project off Denmark 25 years ago and is now approaching maturity, they are looking across the Atlantic at what they view as a huge and potentially lucrative new market."
Exxon,2017-8,"Norway's Statoil has won a licence to develop a wind farm of the New York coast, is marketing its new floating turbine to California and Hawaii and is retraining some oil and gas staff to work in its wind division."
Exxon,2017-8,"Royal Dutch Shell bid for a lease offshore North Carolina earlier this year while Denmark's DONG Energy, a wind energy pioneer which agreed to sell its oil and gas business in May, is in a Massachusetts-based offshore wind consortium, holds a lease off the New Jersey coast and has opened an office in Boston."
Exxon,2017-8,"Offshore wind generation began in the United States late last year, ironically after the election of President Donald Trump. He is sceptical about climate change, complains about subsidies for renewable energy and battled against an offshore wind farm near his Scottish golf resort."
Exxon,2017-8,"However, a string of federal seabed leases were awarded before Trump took office and more are planned. [L5N1KM40R] The investment needed to get projects going is one of the biggest obstacles."
Exxon,2017-8,"""Undeniably, offshore wind is a big boys' game because it requires large amounts of capital because scale is such an important cost driver,"" said Samuel Leupold chief executive of DONG Energy's offshore wind business."
Exxon,2017-8,"While DONG has shifted decisively towards renewables, Statoil and Shell are still firmly rooted in fossil fuels and other major European oil companies, in common with their U.S. counterparts, have so far steered clear of U.S. offshore wind."
Exxon,2017-8,"Washington estimates its potential at 2,000 gigawatts (GW), many times anticipated capacity in Europe of 25 GW by 2020, but U.S. federal subsidies expire at the end of 2019 and while they may be renewed by Congress, that is no means certain."
Exxon,2017-8,"Costs in Europe have fallen to a level that enabled DONG to place a zero subsidy bid earlier this year, but offshore wind farms are still multi-billion dollar projects. A push into deeper U.S. waters and the bigger turbines needed to compete without subsidies will keep price tags high.[nL8N1JJ2OL]"
Exxon,2017-8,"Trump signed an executive order in March expected to roll back his predecessor Barack Obama's plan requiring states to slash carbon emissions from power plants. There is also no carbon price mechanism across the United States like those in Europe and elsewhere, although there are two regional ones."
Exxon,2017-8,"U.S. oil companies have some investments in solar and onshore wind, but when it comes to offshore wind, many say they are waiting for a time when government support is not needed."
Exxon,2017-8,"""Chevron supports renewables that are scalable and can compete without subsidies,"" said Morgan Krinklaw, a spokesman for Chevron, which owns an onshore wind farm."
Exxon,2017-8,"A report from analysts at Lazard in December pegged the cost of U.S. offshore wind at $118 MWh, around twice as much as onshore wind or combined-cycle gas turbines."
Exxon,2017-8,"Asked to comment on that figure, Statoil, which is building its first floating wind turbine park off the Scottish coast, said costs were coming down and it was working to drive them down further, partly by redeploying existing staff."
Exxon,2017-8,"The company has about 1,000 employees in the U.S. oil industry, said Stephen Bull, senior vice president of the company's wind business. ""There's scope for us to plug into our existing oil and gas supply chain,"" he added, referring to existing contracts with equipment and service suppliers."
Exxon,2017-8,"Statoil spokeswoman Elin Isaksen said she did not expect any of its offshore wind projects in the U.S. to have begun construction by 2019 and that it was too early to quote numbers for the New York project, while acknowledging there was, as yet, no supply chain."
Exxon,2017-8,"In Virginia, where Spanish utility Iberdrola's Avangrid has secured an offshore wind licence, a rich marine engineering heritage is expected to help local companies gain work. Smaller European oil and gas firms are also gaining work."
Exxon,2017-8,"JDR Cable Systems, a British company that has traditionally supplied subsea power lines to oil and gas platforms, earlier this year won a $275 million contract to provide electric cables for the largest U.S. offshore wind farm off the Maryland coast."
Exxon,2017-8,"""We are well placed to develop business in the U.S. because of the existing relationships we have in Europe,"" said John Price, global sales director for renewables at JDR."
Exxon,2017-8,"State level decision-making on electricity procurement, the next stage of getting offshore wind off the ground, is helping."
Exxon,2017-8,"Massachusetts, where DONG has secured a seabed license, last year issued a law requiring its utilities to buy up to 1.6 GW of offshore wind power by June 2027, with a tender to be held later this year."
Exxon,2017-8,"DONG's North America wind power president Thomas Bostrom said it would bid in the Massachusetts power purchase tender in December and would not comment on costs ahead of that. He too, emphasised his company was playing the long game."
Exxon,2017-8,"""As excited as we are for offshore wind in the U.S., we are still in the early days of the industry,"" Bostrom said."
