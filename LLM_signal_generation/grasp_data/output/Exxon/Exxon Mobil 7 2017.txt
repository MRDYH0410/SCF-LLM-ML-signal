Exxon,2017-7,July 30 (Reuters) - Saudi Basic Industries Corp <2010.SE> (SABIC) missed estimates with a 25 percent fall in second-quarter net profit on Sunday as the world's fourth-largest petrochemicals maker reported higher selling costs and lower sales.
Exxon,2017-7,"Net profit fell to 3.71 billion riyals ($989.3 million) in the three months to June 30 from a revised 4.96 billion a year earlier, the company said in a bourse statement."
Exxon,2017-7,That fell well short of the 4.6 billion riyals expected by analysts.
Exxon,2017-7,SABIC shares fell 1.2 percent in opening trade on the kingdom's stock exchange.
Exxon,2017-7,Chief Executive Yousef al-Benyan said profit fall stemmed from weaker performance at its Hadeed iron and steel unit.
Exxon,2017-7,"""The impact of our Q2 comes from Hadeed, related to inventory and slow sales,"" Benyan told a news conference in Riyadh."
Exxon,2017-7,"The drop in demand for steel was seasonal, driven by the Muslim holidays of Ramadan and Eid, he said, adding the company would try to reduce expenses and increase production."
Exxon,2017-7,"""Hopefully in the third and fourth quarters the demand will pick up, because normally these (expenses and production) are impacted by these important occasions in the second quarter,"" Benyan said."
Exxon,2017-7,"SABIC, which aims to be the world's third-biggest petrochemicals producer, said prior period figures had been restated."
Exxon,2017-7,"Like most Saudi publicly listed firms, SABIC adopted IFRS accounting standards in January."
Exxon,2017-7,"Its plastics, fertilisers and metals are used in construction, agriculture and manufacturing."
Exxon,2017-7,SABIC had expected this year to be positive in terms of economic growth in key markets. The firm's earnings shot up 80 percent in the first quarter buoyed by higher prices.
Exxon,2017-7,"Benyan told Reuters in May the firm was evaluating acquisition opportunities in the range of $3 billion to $6 billion in petrochemicals, speciality chemicals and fertilisers and aims to do the first such deal in the fourth quarter of this year. [nL8N1I442]"
Exxon,2017-7,SABIC's expansion is driven by the need to be closer to key markets and feedstock. Constraints in new gas supplies in Saudi Arabia are forcing petrochemical producers to look abroad for expansion.
Exxon,2017-7,The company is making progress towards a major investment in the United States with an affiliate of Exxon Mobil .
Exxon,2017-7,"It is also pursuing its first project with oil giant Saudi Aramco, development of an oil-to-chemicals project in Saudi Arabia which analysts see as a breakthrough in the industry."
Exxon,2017-7,Benyan said he expected to announce more detail on the project by the end of the third quarter. ($1 = 3.7501 riyals)

Exxon,2017-7,"SABIC, like most Saudi publicly listed firms adopted IFRS accounting standards in January this year"
Exxon,2017-7,"SABIC, which aims to be Number 3 petrochemicals producer globally, attributed the profit fall to higher cost of sales and lower sales quantities."
Exxon,2017-7,"The company's results are closely tied to oil prices and global economic growth because its products -- plastics, fertilisers and metals -- are used extensively in construction, agriculture, industry and the manufacturing of consumer goods."

But fellow integrated major Chevron outpaced it as investments it made in the Permian Basin in West Texas earlier in the cycle are starting to pay off."
Exxon,2017-7,"These helped Chevron turn a $1.5 billion loss in the three months to June in 2016 into a $1.5 billion profit this year. Its overall production rose by 250,000 barrels a day, equivalent to a 10 percent increase over the quarter, thanks in large part to a one-third jump in Permian output."
Exxon,2017-7,"Moreover, it has reduced operating costs in the area by 37 percent since 2015. Chief Executive John Watson has also been investing more in the region, having closed seven deals so far this year which he reckons should yield a 30 percent internal rate of return. He is also eyeing as much as 200,000 acres for purchase before the end of 2018."
Exxon,2017-7,"Darren Woods, who took over as Exxon chief executive at the start of the year, is not in as good a position; predecessor Rex Tillerson had not committed as many resources to the Permian before he left to become U.S. secretary of state. As a consequence, Exxon's U.S. E&P division fell well short of Goldman Sachs' expectations and the company is only just breaking ground on West Texas wells on land it bought earlier this year. Production at the company fell by 1 percent to 3.9 million barrels a day."
Exxon,2017-7,"That's part of Woods' broader plan to boost capital expenditure and put its cash pile to work that should bring relatively quick results, assuming commodity prices allow. And Exxon does, at least, have a decent investment track record: the 6.7 percent return on capital employed, according to Thomson Reuters data, that analysts expect this year is best in class."
Exxon,2017-7,"Trouble is, rivals including Chevron are starting to cut back spending as prices fall, just as oil floods the market. Exxon may end up being a smart contrarian. If not, it'll only be able to look longingly at its competitor's primed pumps."
Exxon,2017-7,"- Exxon Mobil, the world's largest publicly traded oil and gas company, on July 28 reported second-quarter earnings of $3.4 billion, 97 percent higher than the same period last year. Revenue rose 9 percent. At 78 cents per share the company missed the consensus estimate of sell-side analysts of 84 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S."
Exxon,2017-7,"- Earnings in the company's upstream division were $1.2 billion, up $890 million from the second quarter last year. The company's production fell 1 percent in the quarter to 3.9 million barrels per day."
Exxon,2017-7,"- On the same day, Chevron said it earned $1.5 billion in the second quarter, or 78 cents per share, compared with a loss of $1.5 billion in the same quarter last year. Excluding one-time items, the company's earnings per share hit 91 cents. Analysts were expecting earnings of 87 cents per share. Revenue grew 18 percent. Net oil-equivalent production was 2.8 million barrels per day, compared with 2.5 million barrels per day from a year ago."

Exxon,2017-7,UPDATE 2-Italy's Eni confident of dividend even with lower oil prices - Reuters News
Exxon,2017-7,{{20170728T160312.848+0000}}UPDATE 2-Italy's Eni confident of dividend even with lower oil prices* Adjusted net profit 463 mln euros vs 317 mln loss year ago
Exxon,2017-7,"MILAN, July 28 (Reuters) - Italian oil major Eni said on Friday its dividend was safe even at lower oil prices thanks to a string of major discoveries underpinning output growth and cash generation for the years to come."
Exxon,2017-7,"Eni , the most active of the foreign oil majors in Africa, has one of the best discovery records in the industry, with large gas fields in Mozambique and Egypt. More recently it also made an oil find in Mexico."
Exxon,2017-7,"Under its so-called ""dual exploration"" strategy, the company aims to sell down stakes in fields it operates to raise cash to fund future development and support dividends."
Exxon,2017-7,"""We have all the tools to cope with oil at $45 a barrel,"" CEO Claudio Descalzi told analysts on a second-quarter results call when asked about dividend sustainability."
Exxon,2017-7,"""We are able to tackle this situation, and we won't be using scrip dividends,"" he said, referring to a practice where investors are offered shares in place of cash."
Exxon,2017-7,"Eni, whose cash flow jumped 56 pct to 2.7 billion euros in the second quarter, has committed to paying a dividend in 2017 of 0.80 euros per share."
Exxon,2017-7,"Investors in oil firms have been unnerved by weak oil prices, which have struggled to hold gains that followed a deal between the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and some other producers to cut crude production from January."
Exxon,2017-7,"Prices climbed above $58 a barrel in January, recovering from the 2016 lows of just $27. But Brent has since slipped back and is now hovering around $52, leading banks to downgrade price forecasts and investor concerns about shareholder returns."
Exxon,2017-7,"Eni, which has pledged to cut spending this year by about 18 percent, earmarked about 32 billion euros of investments in its four-year business plan in March."
Exxon,2017-7,"Descalzi said there was room to reduce those investments if needed. ""In the second half of the plan 50 percent of the capex is not yet committed ... we have flexibility,"" he said."
Exxon,2017-7,"Eni, which will benefit from a ramp-up at Kazakhstan's giant Kashagan field, said it expected output this year to jump 5 percent to 1.84 million barrels per day as projects in Angola, Ghana, Indonesia and Egypt come on stream ahead of schedule."
Exxon,2017-7,Eni said its discovery in the Gulf of Mexico could contain more than the 1.3 billion barrels of oil equivalent in place estimated so far. It said it would decide early next year whether to proceed with investment there.
Exxon,2017-7,"""We own 100 percent of Mexico and it's clearly one of our future targets (for selling down),"" Descalzi said."
Exxon,2017-7,"Eni, which has agreed to sell stakes in its Mozambique and Egyptian fields to ExxonMobil and Rosneft , expects to raise 4 billion euros this year from disposals."
Exxon,2017-7,"Santander oil analyst Jason Kenney, who was upbeat about Eni on a three- to five-year outlook, said the market had underestimated the value of Eni's dual exploration strategy."
Exxon,2017-7,"""Investors have proved unwilling to support Eni for its valuable discovered resource potential,"" he said."
Exxon,2017-7,"Shares in Eni closed up 0.3 percent, broadly in line with the European oil and gas sector <.SXEP>. Milan's blue-chip index <.FTMIB> closed down 0.9 percent."

Exxon,2017-7,* Profits to drop on quarter after oil price recovery stalls
Exxon,2017-7,"LONDON, July 21 (Reuters) - After a brief respite at the start of the year, the world's top oil and gas companies are set to double down on cost cutting as a recovery in crude prices after a three-year slump falters."
Exxon,2017-7,"Corporate hopes were raised by a deal between members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other non-OPEC producers to cut production, which lifted oil prices above $58 a barrel in January, after they had slid to as low as $27 in 2016."
Exxon,2017-7,"But Brent crude prices have since slipped back below $50 and banks have lowered price forecasts, amid surging output from the United States and other nations not bound by the global oil pact."
Exxon,2017-7,"Investors are again focussing on the ability of top oil firms such as Exxon Mobil , Royal Dutch Shell and Total to live within their means and eke out profits when oil has failed to recover, as hoped, to $60."
Exxon,2017-7,"The majors, often dubbed Big Oil, have already been through tough spending cuts since a collapse in crude prices since mid-2014 from above $100. They have shed thousands of jobs, scrapped projects, sold assets and squeezed service costs."
Exxon,2017-7,"Net income for Exxon, Chevron , Shell, BP , Total, Eni and Statoil is set to double on average in the quarter ending June 30 from a year earlier, even though oil prices are back as similar levels, according to analyst estimates compiled by Reuters."
Exxon,2017-7,"By early 2017, management teams said their operations in 2017 would cover spending and dividend payouts at $60 a barrel, although for many firms this included using scrip programmes, when investors can opt for dividend payouts in shares not cash."
Exxon,2017-7,"But earlier savings may not now be enough, with Brent crude averaging below $50 in the second quarter and forecasts that the 2017 average will be $54. [O/POLL]"
Exxon,2017-7,"While net income for Q2 may climb year-on-year, the quarter-on-quarter picture is different. Compared to the first three months of the year, the second quarter will see net income fall by about 20 percent, according to analyst estimates."
Exxon,2017-7,"""Given where oil prices are, 2017 is still a year of transition for these companies, and that is not necessarily supportive for investment,"" said Jason Kenney, head of pan-European oil and gas equity research at Banco Santander."
Exxon,2017-7,"""The sector needs to continue doing more of the same,"" he said, referring to the ongoing need to reduce costs."
Exxon,2017-7,"Dividend yield, the ratio between a firm's dividend payout and share price, has risen in recent weeks to near recent highs as share prices have slipped, underscoring investor concerns."
Exxon,2017-7,"Shell, Statoil and Total kick off the Q2 earnings reports on Thursday, followed by Exxon and Chevron on Friday. BP reports on Aug. 1."
Exxon,2017-7,"Majors were targetting break even at $55 a barrel and could further cut spending by delaying investments, simplifying offshore and other project designs and selling assets, Kenney said."
Exxon,2017-7,"About two thirds of the industry's capital expenditure went to new projects, with the rest used to maintain existing output, Kenney added."
Exxon,2017-7,Company boards have taken different approaches to deal with the bumpy oil price recovery.
Exxon,2017-7,"Exxon and Chevron have invested in U.S. shale oil in recent months, seeking to benefit from the relatively low development cost and the short time it takes to extract commercial oil."
Exxon,2017-7,"Across the Atlantic, Shell, BP and Total have focussed more heavily on cutting costs of large, deepwater oil and gas projects to compete with the low-cost shale. [nL8N1JG4D4]"
Exxon,2017-7,"Analysts have rewarded some firms for their ongoing savings. Total holds 18 ""strong buy"" or ""buy"" recommendations, while Chevron has 17, among analysts polled by Reuters. Shell has 16."
Exxon,2017-7,"Exxon holds the lowest number of ""buy"" recommendations at 8. Its high share price to earnings (P/E) ratio and a weaker production growth outlook make it less attractive, HSBC said."
Exxon,2017-7,"Exxon shares are trading at a P/E ratio of 16.9, compared with Shell's 11.9 and BP's 10.3."
Exxon,2017-7,"""The fundamental environment is looking quite good because this is an environment where (companies) can cut costs and reduce headcount and they don't have to develop anything,"" said Jonathan Waghorn, co-manager of the energy fund at Guinness Asset Management, which holds shares in Shell, BP, Total and Chevron. ""They are off life support at $55 a barrel."""

Exxon,2017-7,* Profits to drop on quarter after oil price recovery stalls
Exxon,2017-7,"LONDON, July 21 (Reuters) - After a brief respite at the start of the year, the world's top oil and gas companies are set to double down on cost cutting as a recovery in crude prices after a three-year slump falters."
Exxon,2017-7,"Corporate hopes were raised by a deal between members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other non-OPEC producers to cut production, which lifted oil prices above $58 a barrel in January, after they had slid to as low as $27 in 2016."
Exxon,2017-7,"But Brent crude prices have since slipped back below $50 and banks have lowered price forecasts, amid surging output from the United States and other nations not bound by the global oil pact."
Exxon,2017-7,"Investors are again focussing on the ability of top oil firms such as Exxon Mobil , Royal Dutch Shell and Total to live within their means and eke out profits when oil has failed to recover, as hoped, to $60."
Exxon,2017-7,"The majors, often dubbed Big Oil, have already been through tough spending cuts since a collapse in crude prices since mid-2014 from above $100. They have shed thousands of jobs, scrapped projects, sold assets and squeezed service costs."
Exxon,2017-7,"Net income for Exxon, Chevron , Shell, BP , Total, Eni and Statoil is set to double on average in the quarter ending June 30 from a year earlier, even though oil prices are back as similar levels, according to analyst estimates compiled by Reuters."
Exxon,2017-7,"By early 2017, management teams said their operations in 2017 would cover spending and dividend payouts at $60 a barrel, although for many firms this included using scrip programmes, when investors can opt for dividend payouts in shares not cash."
Exxon,2017-7,"But earlier savings may not now be enough, with Brent crude averaging below $50 in the second quarter and forecasts that the 2017 average will be $54. [O/POLL]"
Exxon,2017-7,"While net income for Q2 may climb year-on-year, the quarter-on-quarter picture is different. Compared to the first three months of the year, the second quarter will see net income fall by about 20 percent, according to analyst estimates."
Exxon,2017-7,"""Given where oil prices are, 2017 is still a year of transition for these companies, and that is not necessarily supportive for investment,"" said Jason Kenney, head of pan-European oil and gas equity research at Banco Santander."
Exxon,2017-7,"""The sector needs to continue doing more of the same,"" he said, referring to the ongoing need to reduce costs."
Exxon,2017-7,"Dividend yield, the ratio between a firm's dividend payout and share price, has risen in recent weeks to near recent highs as share prices have slipped, underscoring investor concerns."
Exxon,2017-7,"Shell, Statoil and Total kick off the Q2 earnings reports on Thursday, followed by Exxon and Chevron on Friday. BP reports on Aug. 1."
Exxon,2017-7,"Majors were targetting break even at $55 a barrel and could further cut spending by delaying investments, simplifying offshore and other project designs and selling assets, Kenney said."
Exxon,2017-7,"About two thirds of the industry's capital expenditure went to new projects, with the rest used to maintain existing output, Kenney added."
Exxon,2017-7,Company boards have taken different approaches to deal with the bumpy oil price recovery.
Exxon,2017-7,"Exxon and Chevron have invested in U.S. shale oil in recent months, seeking to benefit from the relatively low development cost and the short time it takes to extract commercial oil."
Exxon,2017-7,"Across the Atlantic, Shell, BP and Total have focussed more heavily on cutting costs of large, deepwater oil and gas projects to compete with the low-cost shale. [nL8N1JG4D4]"
Exxon,2017-7,"Analysts have rewarded some firms for their ongoing savings. Total holds 18 ""strong buy"" or ""buy"" recommendations, while Chevron has 17, among analysts polled by Reuters. Shell has 16."
Exxon,2017-7,"Exxon holds the lowest number of ""buy"" recommendations at 8. Its high share price to earnings (P/E) ratio and a weaker production growth outlook make it less attractive, HSBC said."
Exxon,2017-7,"Exxon shares are trading at a P/E ratio of 16.9, compared with Shell's 11.9 and BP's 10.3."
Exxon,2017-7,"""The fundamental environment is looking quite good because this is an environment where (companies) can cut costs and reduce headcount and they don't have to develop anything,"" said Jonathan Waghorn, co-manager of the energy fund at Guinness Asset Management, which holds shares in Shell, BP, Total and Chevron. ""They are off life support at $55 a barrel."""

Exxon,2017-7,UPDATE 3-Exxon sues U.S. over fine levied for Russia deal under Tillerson - Reuters News
Exxon,2017-7,"{{20170720T230108.805+0000}}UPDATE 3-Exxon sues U.S. over fine levied for Russia deal under Tillerson(Recasts, adds material from lawsuit)"
Exxon,2017-7,"WASHINGTON/HOUSTON, July 20 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp sued the U.S. government on Thursday, blasting as ""unlawful"" and ""capricious"" a $2 million fine levied against it for a three-year-old oil joint venture with Russia's Rosneft ."
Exxon,2017-7,"The U.S. Treasury Department on Thursday morning slapped the world's largest publicly traded oil producer with the fine for ""reckless disregard"" of U.S. sanctions in dealings with Russia in 2014 when Secretary of State Rex Tillerson was Exxon's chief executive."
Exxon,2017-7,"The lawsuit and the Treasury's unusually detailed statement on Exxon's conduct represented an extraordinary confrontation between a major American company and the U.S. government, made all the more striking because Exxon's former CEO is now in President Donald Trump's Cabinet."
Exxon,2017-7,"Exxon took the government to court despite the fact that the fine, the maximum allowed, would have a minor impact on the company, which made $7.84 billion in profit last year."
Exxon,2017-7,"The fine came after a U.S. review of deals Exxon signed with Rosneft, Russia's largest oil producer, weeks after Washington imposed sanctions on Moscow for annexing Ukraine's Crimea region."
Exxon,2017-7,"Between May 14 and May 23, 2014, top U.S.-based Exxon executives signed eight documents with Igor Sechin, the head of state-run Rosneft, the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) said in the statement on its website."
Exxon,2017-7,"The Treasury imposed sanctions on Sechin in April 2014 as part of measures to pressure Russia over its intervention in Ukraine, saying Sechin had shown ""utter loyalty"" to Russian President Vladimir Putin."
Exxon,2017-7,"The sanctions prohibit U.S. citizens or people in the United States from dealing with those on the blacklist, such as Sechin. Rosneft itself is subject to narrower U.S. sanctions that still allow Americans to deal with the company on some transactions."
Exxon,2017-7,"Exxon said in a statement that OFAC's action was ""fundamentally unfair,"" and sued the U.S. government in Texas in an effort to overturn the decision. The company is based in Irving, Texas."
Exxon,2017-7,"In its 21-page complaint, Exxon argued that Sechin ""was subject to sanctions only in his individual capacity"" and that guidance from the Obama administration at the time made clear that the sanctions ""applied only to the 'personal assets' of the sanctioned individuals and emphasized that the sanctions did not restrict business with the companies those individuals managed."""
Exxon,2017-7,"Tillerson left Exxon late last year to become secretary of state after 10 years running the company. He is now responsible for U.S. foreign policy, which includes helping make sanctions decisions."
Exxon,2017-7,The State Department referred questions about the fine to Exxon and the Treasury. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert told reporters on Thursday that the agency was alerted to the fine on Wednesday.
Exxon,2017-7,"A Treasury spokesman said OFAC engaged with Exxon's lawyers only, and ""did not discuss this case with Secretary Tillerson."""
Exxon,2017-7,"Tillerson said in January that he would recuse himself from matters involving Exxon for one year after his December 2016 resignation, unless he is authorized to participate."
Exxon,2017-7,"Though the State Department plays a major part in formulating sanctions policy, former U.S. officials and sanctions experts said it was unlikely the agency had a role in deciding the fine announced on Thursday, because it falls under OFAC's regulatory role."
Exxon,2017-7,"The back-and-forth between the Treasury and Exxon over the 2014 dealings spanned both the Obama and Trump administrations, and started with a subpoena from OFAC to Exxon in July 2014, Exxon said in its complaint."
Exxon,2017-7,"Exxon fully complied with guidance from Democratic former President Barack Obama's administration that ongoing oil and gas business activities with Rosneft were permitted, Exxon spokesman Alan Jeffers said in a statement."
Exxon,2017-7,"The Treasury ""is trying to retroactively enforce a new interpretation of an executive order"" inconsistent with its prior guidance, Jeffers said. ""OFAC's action is fundamentally unfair."""
Exxon,2017-7,Exxon also cited a Treasury Department representative's comments in May 2014 that BP Plc Chief Executive Bob Dudley - an American citizen - could continue to participate in Rosneft board meetings so long as they related only to Rosneft's business.
Exxon,2017-7,"In its statement explaining the fine, OFAC said that the Treasury Department representative's comments did not address Exxon's conduct. BP did not immediately respond to a request for comment."
Exxon,2017-7,"Publicly available guidance on the Treasury's website at the time of Exxon's dealings with Sechin said Americans should ensure they do not enter into contracts signed by sanctioned individuals, OFAC said."
Exxon,2017-7,"And by dealing with Sechin, the company ""caused significant harm"" to U.S. sanctions on Russia, the agency said."
Exxon,2017-7,"Because Rosneft itself is not off-limits to Americans, another company executive could have signed the contract with no sanctions risk to Exxon, said David Mortlock, who was a State Department and White House sanctions official under Obama."
Exxon,2017-7,"""You could have Sechin standing over the guy's shoulder,"" said Mortlock, now an attorney at Willkie Farr & Gallagher LLP in Washington. ""But the problem here is that it was signed by Sechin himself."""
Exxon,2017-7,Exxon said that approach would have flown in the face of standard business practice.
Exxon,2017-7,"""You don't ask your business partner to have someone else sign instead of the CEO,"" said Exxon spokesman Jeffers."
Exxon,2017-7,"Exxon has long opposed U.S. sanctions on Russia, saying they harm American business interests and actually help European rivals."
Exxon,2017-7,"Tillerson said in 2014 that the company did not support sanctions because they are not effective ""unless they are very well implemented."""

Exxon,2017-7,UPDATE 3-Exxon sues U.S. over fine levied for Russia deal under Tillerson - Reuters News
Exxon,2017-7,"{{20170720T230108.805+0000}}UPDATE 3-Exxon sues U.S. over fine levied for Russia deal under Tillerson(Recasts, adds material from lawsuit)"
Exxon,2017-7,"WASHINGTON/HOUSTON, July 20 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp sued the U.S. government on Thursday, blasting as ""unlawful"" and ""capricious"" a $2 million fine levied against it for a three-year-old oil joint venture with Russia's Rosneft ."
Exxon,2017-7,"The U.S. Treasury Department on Thursday morning slapped the world's largest publicly traded oil producer with the fine for ""reckless disregard"" of U.S. sanctions in dealings with Russia in 2014 when Secretary of State Rex Tillerson was Exxon's chief executive."
Exxon,2017-7,"The lawsuit and the Treasury's unusually detailed statement on Exxon's conduct represented an extraordinary confrontation between a major American company and the U.S. government, made all the more striking because Exxon's former CEO is now in President Donald Trump's Cabinet."
Exxon,2017-7,"Exxon took the government to court despite the fact that the fine, the maximum allowed, would have a minor impact on the company, which made $7.84 billion in profit last year."
Exxon,2017-7,"The fine came after a U.S. review of deals Exxon signed with Rosneft, Russia's largest oil producer, weeks after Washington imposed sanctions on Moscow for annexing Ukraine's Crimea region."
Exxon,2017-7,"Between May 14 and May 23, 2014, top U.S.-based Exxon executives signed eight documents with Igor Sechin, the head of state-run Rosneft, the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) said in the statement on its website."
Exxon,2017-7,"The Treasury imposed sanctions on Sechin in April 2014 as part of measures to pressure Russia over its intervention in Ukraine, saying Sechin had shown ""utter loyalty"" to Russian President Vladimir Putin."
Exxon,2017-7,"The sanctions prohibit U.S. citizens or people in the United States from dealing with those on the blacklist, such as Sechin. Rosneft itself is subject to narrower U.S. sanctions that still allow Americans to deal with the company on some transactions."
Exxon,2017-7,"Exxon said in a statement that OFAC's action was ""fundamentally unfair,"" and sued the U.S. government in Texas in an effort to overturn the decision. The company is based in Irving, Texas."
Exxon,2017-7,"In its 21-page complaint, Exxon argued that Sechin ""was subject to sanctions only in his individual capacity"" and that guidance from the Obama administration at the time made clear that the sanctions ""applied only to the 'personal assets' of the sanctioned individuals and emphasized that the sanctions did not restrict business with the companies those individuals managed."""
Exxon,2017-7,"Tillerson left Exxon late last year to become secretary of state after 10 years running the company. He is now responsible for U.S. foreign policy, which includes helping make sanctions decisions."
Exxon,2017-7,The State Department referred questions about the fine to Exxon and the Treasury. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert told reporters on Thursday that the agency was alerted to the fine on Wednesday.
Exxon,2017-7,"A Treasury spokesman said OFAC engaged with Exxon's lawyers only, and ""did not discuss this case with Secretary Tillerson."""
Exxon,2017-7,"Tillerson said in January that he would recuse himself from matters involving Exxon for one year after his December 2016 resignation, unless he is authorized to participate."
Exxon,2017-7,"Though the State Department plays a major part in formulating sanctions policy, former U.S. officials and sanctions experts said it was unlikely the agency had a role in deciding the fine announced on Thursday, because it falls under OFAC's regulatory role."
Exxon,2017-7,"The back-and-forth between the Treasury and Exxon over the 2014 dealings spanned both the Obama and Trump administrations, and started with a subpoena from OFAC to Exxon in July 2014, Exxon said in its complaint."
Exxon,2017-7,"Exxon fully complied with guidance from Democratic former President Barack Obama's administration that ongoing oil and gas business activities with Rosneft were permitted, Exxon spokesman Alan Jeffers said in a statement."
Exxon,2017-7,"The Treasury ""is trying to retroactively enforce a new interpretation of an executive order"" inconsistent with its prior guidance, Jeffers said. ""OFAC's action is fundamentally unfair."""
Exxon,2017-7,Exxon also cited a Treasury Department representative's comments in May 2014 that BP Plc Chief Executive Bob Dudley - an American citizen - could continue to participate in Rosneft board meetings so long as they related only to Rosneft's business.
Exxon,2017-7,"In its statement explaining the fine, OFAC said that the Treasury Department representative's comments did not address Exxon's conduct. BP did not immediately respond to a request for comment."
Exxon,2017-7,"Publicly available guidance on the Treasury's website at the time of Exxon's dealings with Sechin said Americans should ensure they do not enter into contracts signed by sanctioned individuals, OFAC said."
Exxon,2017-7,"And by dealing with Sechin, the company ""caused significant harm"" to U.S. sanctions on Russia, the agency said."
Exxon,2017-7,"Because Rosneft itself is not off-limits to Americans, another company executive could have signed the contract with no sanctions risk to Exxon, said David Mortlock, who was a State Department and White House sanctions official under Obama."
Exxon,2017-7,"""You could have Sechin standing over the guy's shoulder,"" said Mortlock, now an attorney at Willkie Farr & Gallagher LLP in Washington. ""But the problem here is that it was signed by Sechin himself."""
Exxon,2017-7,Exxon said that approach would have flown in the face of standard business practice.
Exxon,2017-7,"""You don't ask your business partner to have someone else sign instead of the CEO,"" said Exxon spokesman Jeffers."
Exxon,2017-7,"Exxon has long opposed U.S. sanctions on Russia, saying they harm American business interests and actually help European rivals."
Exxon,2017-7,"Tillerson said in 2014 that the company did not support sanctions because they are not effective ""unless they are very well implemented."""
Exxon,2017-7,"Sanctions were a contentious topic at Tillerson's confirmation hearing last January. At the time, Republican and Democratic lawmakers were concerned that Trump, whose associates are now under investigation for their ties to Russia, would try to quickly lift U.S. sanctions on the country."
Exxon,2017-7,"""When sanctions are imposed, they by their design are going to harm American business,"" Tillerson said during the hearing, in response to a question about his views on them."
Exxon,2017-7,"He also said that Exxon ""never directly lobbied against sanctions,"" a claim that was immediately challenged by senators who cited Exxon's own lobbying disclosure forms."
Exxon,2017-7,"The case is Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Steve Munchin, et al, U.S. District Court, North District of Texas, No. 3:17-cv-1930."

Exxon,2017-7,{{20170719T145543.653+0000}}Qatar LNG company postpones layoffs amid diplomatic crisisBy Tom Finn
Exxon,2017-7,"DOHA, July 19 (Reuters) - Majority state-owned Qatari gas producer Rasgas has postponed a round of job cuts after the diplomatic crisis which erupted between Qatar and its neighbours in early June, people familiar with the matter have told Reuters."
Exxon,2017-7,"Staff at Rasgas were told earlier this year that they would be laid off in June, with the job cuts following last year's decision to merge RasGas with Qatargas, the two liquefied natural gas divisions of Qatar Petroleum [QATPE.UL]. [nL5N1E6047]"
Exxon,2017-7,"But in a company email last month staff were informed that the job cuts had been delayed, two Rasgas employees said."
Exxon,2017-7,It was not immediately clear whether the delay meant the entire merger had been postponed.
Exxon,2017-7,"The move comes as Qatar works to cope with sanctions imposed by Saudi Arabia and other Arab states, striking trade deals and cancelling the leave of foreign expatriate workers in ""essential government sectors"" to help cope with the crisis. [nL8N1JJ4MU]"
Exxon,2017-7,"""The layoffs were postponed. No reason was given,"" said one of the employees, who declined to be named. A Rasgas spokeswoman was not available to comment."
Exxon,2017-7,"Qatar Petroleum's chief executive said at the end of last year the merger of RasGas and Qatargas would help to cut operating costs by hundreds of millions of dollars at the world's largest LNG producer, and another group official familiar with the plan said hundreds of people would be laid off. [nL5N1E6047]"
Exxon,2017-7,"An official working at a Gulf energy company said Doha was apparently postponing the layoffs because it needed to focus the attention of leaders and managers on the diplomatic crisis, which has disrupted some imports into the country."
Exxon,2017-7,"""I still think the job cuts will happen in the long run, as the Rasgas-Qatargas merger will go ahead and many of the jobs are duplicated across both organisations,"" said the official."
Exxon,2017-7,"""This seems to be a case of 'we currently have bigger fish to fry than a fast merger'."""
Exxon,2017-7,Last month Qatar announced plans to expand its LNG production capacity by 30 percent and build infrastructure to bolster its role as a major global supplier amid rising LNG output from Australia and the United States. [nL8N1JV3ML]
Exxon,2017-7,"""With the political crisis and this output expansion, it is all hands on deck,"" said a Qatar Petroleum official."
Exxon,2017-7,"RasGas currently has a production capacity of about 37 million tonnes a year of LNG, according to its website. It is a 70/30 percent joint venture between Qatar Petroleum and Exxon Mobil"

Exxon,2017-7,"JAKARTA, July 18 (Reuters) - The Indonesian unit of ExxonMobil on Tuesday said it ""no longer wishes to continue further discussions or activity"" involving the country's East Natuna natural gas block, believed to hold one of the world's largest reserves of untapped gas."
Exxon,2017-7,"The firm's Vice President of Public and Government Affairs Erwin Maryoto told Reuters in an email the decision was taken after completing a ""technology and market review""."
Exxon,2017-7,"Exxon's exit likely means further delays in developing a field that was first discovered in the 1970s. Difficulties with the field have included contract disputes and the remoteness of the block, which is on the southern edge of the South China Sea."
Exxon,2017-7,"The East Natuna field holds approximately 46 trillion cubic feet of recoverable gas resources, according to Exxon, although it comes with a carbon dioxide content of more than 70 percent - which also increases the cost of extracting useable fuel."
Exxon,2017-7,State energy firm Pertamina had expected to sign a production sharing contract with ExxonMobil and Thailand's PTTEP for the project last year.
Exxon,2017-7,"Syamsu Alam, Pertamina's upstream director, said the company has not been informed directly of Exxon's decision, but that it was committed to developing the East Natuna field, once a partner is found."
Exxon,2017-7,"""Surely Pertamina wouldn't be able to develop the block alone, we need a partner,"" Alam told Reuters in a text message."
Exxon,2017-7,"Indonesia's government has received a letter from the U.S. oil major on its decision to pull out of the gas block, Wiratmaja Puja, director general of oil and gas at the energy ministry, told reporters."
Exxon,2017-7,"In the letter, Exxon said developing the block would be ""uneconomical for the company under current terms"", but it offered to help with technology and technical assistance for the project if needed, according to Puja."
Exxon,2017-7,"Puja estimated that developing the project under current terms would make its gas too expensive, at about $10-15 per million British thermal units (mmBtu). That compares with spot prices for liquefied natural gas (LNG) in Asia that are currently less than $6 per mmBtu ."
Exxon,2017-7,"The government plans to invite Exxon to discuss the project again, saying it might offer ""a special incentive"" to make it economically viable, Puja said."
Exxon,2017-7,"Malaysia's Petronas [PETRA.UL] and France's Total were previously involved with the East Natuna project, but they have both pulled out."
Exxon,2017-7,"In the past, Pertamina's official has said that developing the East Natuna project could cost up to $40 billion."

Exxon,2017-7,"{{20170714T182206.808+0000}}Behind the scenes, companies fight Trump on US steel tariffsBy Ginger Gibson"
Exxon,2017-7,"WASHINGTON, July 14 (Reuters) - American manufacturers, energy companies and retailers reliant on cheap steel are quietly lobbying against President Donald Trump's desire to impose tariffs on steel imports ahead of possible decision by the U.S. Commerce Department next week."
Exxon,2017-7,"Honoring a promise made in the 2016 election campaign, in April this year Trump initiated a ""Section 232"" review of the steel industry, a provision in the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 allowing for the imposition of tariffs or quotas on imports if they threaten national security. The provision has only been used to review imports twice before."
Exxon,2017-7,"The Commerce Department could issue findings on the matter as early as next week, a decision that three lobbyists say has been delayed due to debate inside the administration."
Exxon,2017-7,"Steel producers in the U.S., like U.S. Steel Corp and AK Steel stand to benefit from protectionist tariffs which would enable them to raise their prices."
Exxon,2017-7,"But U.S. manufacturers and energy companies who use steel want to keep their costs down and say tariffs could costs jobs in their industries, while retailers need cheap steel for many facets of their business including shelving in their stores and warehouses, and to sell to consumers."
Exxon,2017-7,Any U.S. tariffs may also result in damage to unrelated industries if other countries retaliate by also imposing tariffs on American exports in sectors such as agriculture.
Exxon,2017-7,"""Our member companies have quietly had these conversations with both members of the administration but also with the Hill,"" said Hun Quach, the vice president for international trade at the Retail Industry Leaders Association."
Exxon,2017-7,"Those in favor of approving new tariffs include not only steel manufacturers, but some aligned unions. They have allies in Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, a former U.S. Steel lawyer who has promised to recuse himself from decisions regarding the industry."
Exxon,2017-7,"Mario Longhi, who until a few weeks ago was chief executive of U.S. Steel, said earlier this year that curbing cheap steel imports could restore jobs for 10,000 American steel workers."
Exxon,2017-7,"The U.S. steel industry employed about 147,000 people in 2015, according to the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic analysis."
Exxon,2017-7,"But manufacturers that need steel employ about 6.5 million people each year, and the construction industry supports another 6.3 million jobs."
Exxon,2017-7,"Manufacturers argue that pushing up the cost of steel by imposing tariffs on imports ultimately hurts American consumers who will pay more for everyday goods made from steel, such as lawn mowers, washing machines, and microwaves."
Exxon,2017-7,"When former President George W. Bush imposed steel tariffs in 2002, the move was found illegal by the World Trade Organization which permitted other countries to retaliate against American exports and Bush was forced to back down."
Exxon,2017-7,"Studies by the free trade lobby group, the Consuming Industries Trade Action Coalition (CITAC), found that 200,000 workers in U.S. manufacturing lost their jobs as a result of the 2002 steel tariffs."
Exxon,2017-7,"Pushing back against something that was a signature piece of Trump's campaign carries some political risk though and most companies would only elaborate on their lobbying efforts anonymously, saying they were making their case to Trump and lawmakers behind closed doors."
Exxon,2017-7,"They see allies in Gary Cohn, the head of the National Economic Council and Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue."
Exxon,2017-7,"""We've been quite vocal both on the Hill and in the administration,"" said a lobbyist for a large manufacturing company that uses both U.S. steel and imported steel, but who declined to speak on the record over concerns public statements could damage relationships with the White House."
Exxon,2017-7,"Several companies have also been pressing members of Congress to advocate against tariffs with the administration on their behalf, said several lobbyists."
Exxon,2017-7,"Several companies, including National Oilwell Varco Inc. , Ball Corporation , and Electrolux , submitted public comments to the Commerce Department arguing against tariffs."
Exxon,2017-7,"The American Petroleum Industry, which represents the largest oil refiners and chemical companies including ExxonMobil , Shell Oil Company , Chevron and Dow Chemical Company , issued forceful comments against the proposed tariffs, as did the American Automotive Policy Council, which includes Ford Motor Co. and General Motors ."
Exxon,2017-7,"""The auto industry and the U.S. workers that the industry employs would be adversely affected and that this unintended negative impact would exceed the benefit provided to the steel industry,"" the American Automotive Policy Council said in a message echoed in other comments."

Exxon,2017-7,"HOUSTON, July 13 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp has been fined about $165,000 by U.S. regulators for safety lapses including inadequate training and equipment maintenance over an explosion that injured four workers at an aging Baton Rouge, Louisiana, refinery last year."
Exxon,2017-7,"The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) issued nine citations, several of which echo previous cautions by federal agencies at two other Exxon plants. The citations, issued in May, were seen by Reuters this month."
Exxon,2017-7,A separate investigation by the U.S. Chemical Safety Board (CSB) is ongoing and its report on the incident is due by year-end.
Exxon,2017-7,Exxon said it is contesting the OSHA citations and fines.
Exxon,2017-7,The facility was faulted five years ago by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for failing to address corrosion on pipes and valves and for inadequate shutdown and emergency procedures provided to workers.
Exxon,2017-7,"The Nov. 22, 2016 explosion on a sulfuric-acid alkylation unit that makes octane-boosting components of gasoline in the sprawling Baton Rouge refinery and chemical plant injured four workers, two of them severely. Two of the affected workers declined to comment; others could not be reached."
Exxon,2017-7,"A worker on the alkylation unit removed the cover of a malfunctioning valve on an isobutane line and used a wrench to turn the value stem, Exxon reported to the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality in a letter. Volatile isobutane is converted in the alkylation unit to a component of gasoline."
Exxon,2017-7,"As the operator turned the valve stem, portions of the valve fell out, releasing isobutane, according to the Exxon letter, which was ignited by a welding machine 70 feet away."
Exxon,2017-7,"One worker was knocked off a scaffold next to the alkylation unit and left dangling over the fire, according to two sources. Another worker was burned over most of her body."
Exxon,2017-7,"Exxon's safety procedures and training for operators on the alkylation unit were lacking, equipment was not properly maintained, and required inspections were not carried out within required time periods, according to a copy of the citations seen by Reuters."
Exxon,2017-7,"""We cooperated with OSHA's investigation and shared extensive information and records,"" said Exxon spokeswoman Charlotte Huffaker. ""We are contesting the citations and associated penalty."""
Exxon,2017-7,"Huffaker said ""nothing is more important"" to Exxon than maintaining a safe workplace for workers and residents near its facilities."
Exxon,2017-7,"Eight of the nine citations were listed as serious, each carrying a fine of $12,675. The ninth, for failing to carry out external visual and ultrasonic inspections of piping, totaled $63,373."
Exxon,2017-7,"The latter fine was higher because Exxon was cited in 2016 for violating the same inspection standard at a Baytown, Texas, refining and chemical plant complex, OSHA said in the citation."
Exxon,2017-7,"In a report issued in May after a two-year investigation of a 2015 explosion at an 86-year-old Torrance, California, refinery then owned by Exxon, the CSB said the company lacked a procedure for operating a fluidic catalytic cracking unit in an idled mode, as was being done when the explosion took place."
Exxon,2017-7,Exxon sold the Torrance refinery to PBF Energy Inc in July 2016.
Exxon,2017-7,"In 2012, the EPA inspected the Baton Rouge refinery as part of a risk management prevention program. It found Exxon had not examined in five years more than 1,000 underground pipes, many of which were corroded, according to the agency's report on the inspection. The EPA also said emergency and shutdown procedures failed to provide needed details for operators."
Exxon,2017-7,"Huffaker said in an email that Exxon contested the violations, and said the EPA withdrew all but two of its findings. She did not specify the two violations but said Exxon resolved those issues."

Exxon,2017-7,"{{20170713T155010.733+0000}}UPDATE 1-Dutch court hearing pits Big Oil against Groningen locals(Adds company, government comments)"
Exxon,2017-7,"THE HAGUE, July 13 (Reuters) - Angry Dutch residents living near the huge Groningen gas field demanded a total halt to production, accusing oil companies of causing house-damaging earth tremors and the government of lying at a hearing in the Netherlands' highest court on Thursday."
Exxon,2017-7,Two days of proceedings at the Council of State is considering appeals against a government plan to curb production at the massive field by an additional 10 percent from Oct. 1.
Exxon,2017-7,"Residents want extraction at the field, which once supplied 10 percent of the European Union's gas needs, to be stopped altogether due to minor earthquakes that have damaged thousands of homes and buildings."
Exxon,2017-7,"Gas production company NAM, a joint venture between oil majors Royal Dutch Shell and Exxon Mobil , has accepted responsibility for damage caused by the quakes, for which it is paying more than 1 billion euros ($1.14 billion)."
Exxon,2017-7,"However, opponents accused NAM and the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs, which sets production levels, of underestimating the dangers."
Exxon,2017-7,"""We have consistently been lied to,"" lawyer Nette Kruzenga, representing a group of Groningen residents, told the court. ""The NAM is only interested in maximizing production, and the government is ignoring its task to protect people."""
Exxon,2017-7,"The Dutch government has lowered production at Groningen several times over the past three years due to small earthquakes triggered by gas extraction. The latest cap, announced in May, would lower output to 21.6 billion cubic metres (bcm) per year, down from 53.9 bcm in 2013."
Exxon,2017-7,"NAM said it was appealing against the cut because the decision ignored earlier agreed safety norms. The 50-50 Exxon-Shell joint venture has said it had been put in an impossible position having been told it could continue production, vital to supply millions of Dutch homes with gas for heating and cooking, but without guarantees it is meeting safety standards."
Exxon,2017-7,"""We are on the same side as others in this case,"" NAM Director Gerald Schotman said in court. ""This may seem contradictory, but we have a common interest: clarity about safety."""
Exxon,2017-7,"The Ministry of Economic Affairs said production in Groningen was necessary for the gas supply in the Netherlands and parts of Germany, Belgium and France and that the earlier cuts had already diminished risks."
Exxon,2017-7,But a relatively large number of light tremors last winter prompted more cuts.
Exxon,2017-7,"""This decision was carefully prepared and well motivated,"" government lawyer Hans Besselink said. ""It does justice to all parties involved."""

Exxon,2017-7,"{{20170712T140620.241+0000}}Oil majors face downgrades if crude prices don't pick up - S&PLONDON, July 12 (Reuters) - Big oil firms would face increased credit rating downgrade pressures if crude prices stayed below $50 a barrel on average until the end of 2018 and they did not compensate by cutting costs, S&P Global said on Wednesday."
Exxon,2017-7,"S&P currently has downgrade warnings - or negative outlooks in rating agency parlance - on ExxonMobil , Chevron Corp and Total , while the other so-called 'majors' include Royal Dutch Shell and BP ."
Exxon,2017-7,"""If oil prices persistently trend below our price assumptions ($50/bbl on average until the end of 2018), downgrade pressure for many ratings would increase without material and sufficient further cost and capex efficiencies, disposals, or other countermeasures against weak credit metrics for a sustained period,"" S&P said in a report."
Exxon,2017-7,"It added that moderately higher oil prices would help credit metrics, but that for most of the big firms -with the exception of Shell- it ""remains to be seen"" whether they could see upgrades without a strong and sustained rebound in crude prices."
Exxon,2017-7,"Oil majors' debt levels have ballooned with aggregate debt reaching nearly $300 billion in 2014, up from just under $200 billion in 2009 according to S&P's estimates."

Exxon,2017-7,"JAKARTA, July 12 (Reuters) - Indonesia is unlikely to need to import liquefied natural gas (LNG) until at least 2020 due to robust gas production at home, a senior government official said on Wednesday, even as the government has pushed increased domestic gas consumption."
Exxon,2017-7,"""Our production has turned out to be better than predicted,"" the country's Director General of Oil and Gas, Wiratmaja Puja, told reporters on Wednesday. ""So there's a high possibility we won't need to import in 2019."""
Exxon,2017-7,"Puja was referring to higher-than-expected output from the Jangkrik gas field operated by Eni . The field was designed to produce 450 million cubic feet per day of gas but output could be up to 600 million cubic feet per day, he said."
Exxon,2017-7,"Currently the world's fifth-biggest exporter of LNG, Indonesia has lost market share to new production from Australia and Qatar and as output is reserved for domestic needs. However, the domestic gas market has not developed as anticipated even after the government promoted the fuel to replace coal for power plants and as an industrial fuel. [nL3N18F3L8][nL4N19D1YD]"
Exxon,2017-7,Puja also called into question imports after 2020 when he mentioned BP's Tangguh Train 3 project will supply more gas to Indonesia from 2020 onwards.
Exxon,2017-7,"""At the end of 2020 we won't need to import,"" he added."
Exxon,2017-7,The comments come even as Australia's Woodside Petroleum inked a contract in April to supply Indonesia's state-owned energy company Pertamina with LNG from 2019 to 2034. Pertamina also has a LNG import deal with U.S.-based Cheniere Energy Inc from 2018 and Exxon Mobil Corp from 2025. [nWNBS02BKK][nFWN1J20OM]
Exxon,2017-7,"Puja suggested those supplies could be redirected to other LNG buyers in Asia, particularly Bangladesh. ""We are pushing Pertamina to go global,"" he said."
Exxon,2017-7,"When contacted by Reuters, Pertamina's Vice President for LNG, Didik Sasongko, supported that idea."
Exxon,2017-7,"""We can use it for trading or to optimise Pertamina's LNG portfolio,"" Sasongko said, referring to the Cheniere deal. ""There's flexibility on delivery,"" he said when asked about the Woodside imports."
Exxon,2017-7,"Meanwhile, Puja said that Indonesia is looking for buyers for 16 to 18 uncommitted LNG cargoes for this year."
Exxon,2017-7,He expects an average of 50 to 60 uncommitted cargoes per year until 2035.

Exxon,2017-7,"NEW YORK, July 11 (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court said on Tuesday that Exxon Mobil Corp cannot enforce a large international arbitration award against Venezuela stemming from an asset seizure in 2007, when the country was nationalizing its oil industry."
Exxon,2017-7,"The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan said a lower court judge erred in entering a judgment to enforce the $1.6 billion award, since reduced to about $188 million, announced in October 2014 by the World Bank's International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID)."
Exxon,2017-7,"It agreed with Venezuela's argument, which the U.S. government supported, that Exxon should have tried to enforce the award under the federal Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA), which offers more protections for sovereign defendants, rather than be permitted to use streamlined procedures."
Exxon,2017-7,"""Applying the FSIA will facilitate national uniformity in procedure,"" Circuit Judge Susan Carney wrote. ""Consistency as to enforcement seems to us importantly aligned with the values of predictability and federal control that foreign affairs demands and that the FSIA was designed to promote."""
Exxon,2017-7,"Exxon spokesman Todd Spitler said the Irving, Texas-based oil company disagreed with the 3-0 decision and is considering its legal options."
Exxon,2017-7,Venezuela and its U.S.-based lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Exxon,2017-7,"The case arose from Venezuela's seizure of Exxon assets in the Cerro Negro and La Ceiba oil development ventures, when the country was nationalizing its oil industry."
Exxon,2017-7,Exxon had made its investments on a joint-venture basis with the state-owned Petroleos de Venezuela SA.
Exxon,2017-7,"According to court papers, an ICSID annulment committee on March 9 threw out nearly all of the arbitration award that concerned the Cerro Negro project, reducing Venezuela's payout to $188.3 million from $1.6 billion."
Exxon,2017-7,Tuesday's decision voids a 2015 judgment by U.S. District Judge Paul Engelmayer in Manhattan.
Exxon,2017-7,"The appeals court also said Exxon's petition should be dismissed without prejudice, allowing the company to seek enforcement in compliance with the FSIA."
Exxon,2017-7,"The case is Mobil Cerro Negro Ltd et al v Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 15-707."

Exxon,2017-7,* Pakistan in talks on govt-to-govt LNG supply deals
Exxon,2017-7,"ISLAMABAD, July 10 (Reuters) - Pakistan says it could become one of the world's top-five buyers of liquefied natural gas (LNG), with Petroleum Minister Shahid Abbasi predicting imports could jump more than fivefold as private companies build new LNG terminals."
Exxon,2017-7,"Outlining Pakistan's ambitious plans - which, if fully implemented, could shake up the global LNG market - Abbasi told Reuters that imports could top 30 million tonnes by 2022, up from just 4.5 million tonnes currently."
Exxon,2017-7,"Cheaper than fuel oil and cleaner burning than coal, LNG suits emerging economies seeking to bridge electricity shortfalls and support growth on tight budgets."
Exxon,2017-7,"""Within five years, I don't see any reason why we should not be beyond 30 million tonnes (in annual LNG imports). We will be one of the top five markets in the world,"" Abbasi said."
Exxon,2017-7,"That kind of jump would represent one of the fastest growth stories in the energy industry, comparable to what China has done in many commodities - but there are doubts whether Pakistan can achieve its ambitions, given the complexity and cost of expansion projects."
Exxon,2017-7,"""It's always possible, but seems very difficult as they will need much more (regasification) capacity and downstream pipeline capacity,"" said Trevor Sikorski at Energy Aspects, a London-based industry market researcher. ""There are infrastructural issues and financial issues."""
Exxon,2017-7,"""Still, it is one of the key LNG growth markets, and its demand will help tighten up the market that has threatened to lurch into over supply."""
Exxon,2017-7,"Abbasi said no one took Pakistan seriously after a decade of botched attempts to bring LNG to the country, but this has changed with the construction of new LNG terminals and gas plants. He said foreign suppliers are now arriving in Pakistan - where energy shortages have prompted Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to promise he'll end the country's frequent blackouts."
Exxon,2017-7,"""Before, we used to go out to talk to LNG suppliers. Now they're coming to us,"" Abbasi said."
Exxon,2017-7,"""(LNG) is really what has saved the whole energy system. It has been a huge success in Pakistan and it will continue,"" he said after Sharif on Friday inaugurated a new Chinese-built LNG power plant that uses General Electric turbines."
Exxon,2017-7,"Pakistan built its first LNG terminal in 2015 and, after some delays, a second terminal is due to come online in October, doubling annual import capacity to about 9 million tonnes."
Exxon,2017-7,"A consortium of Exxon Mobil , Total , Mitsubishi <8058.T>, Qatar Petroleum and Norway's Hoegh is expected to decide by September whether to build a third LNG terminal for about $700 million, Abbasi said."
Exxon,2017-7,"Pakistan has dropped plans to finance up to two more terminals, as private companies have said they would finance these themselves and use Pakistan's existing gas network to sell directly to consumers."
Exxon,2017-7,"""That's been the real success and that's where the growth will come from,"" Abbasi said, adding that about 10 million homes are linked to gas connections in Pakistan - a nation of around 200 million."
Exxon,2017-7,"""In the last four years, we would have added two million additional connections. We are really ramping that up."""
Exxon,2017-7,"If Pakistan achieves its ambitious development goals, it could significantly erode market oversupply, which has helped pull down Asian LNG spot prices by more than 70 percent since 2014 to around $5 per million British thermal units (mmBtu)."
Exxon,2017-7,"Abbasi said Pakistan is in talks with Russia, Indonesia, Malaysia and Oman about government-to-government deals for up to three monthly LNG cargoes for its second terminal, which can import 600 million cubic feet of gas per day, equal to six cargoes a month."
Exxon,2017-7,"""We have a basic idea of what the market is. So if we are able to better those prices through negotiated procurement, we will go with that, otherwise we might float some more tenders,"" Abbasi said."
Exxon,2017-7,"Tenders for two of the terminal's six cargoes have already been won by trading house Gunvor and Italy's Eni , which have signed 5-year and 15-year deals, respectively. The contracts are worth about $5 billion over their lifetime. [nL8N1I43LO]"
Exxon,2017-7,Qatar supplies most of the gas for Pakistan's first LNG terminal.
Exxon,2017-7,"Abbasi said Pakistan is considering inviting private investors to build small-scale gas power plants to add another 3,000-4,000 megawatts to the network, on top of the three new LNG plants that will contribute 3,600 MW."

Exxon,2017-7,"Pakistan has dropped plans to finance up to two more terminals, as private companies have said they would finance these themselves and use Pakistan's existing gas network to sell directly to consumers."
Exxon,2017-7,"""That's been the real success and that's where the growth will come from,"" Abbasi said, adding that about 10 million homes are linked to gas connections in Pakistan - a nation of around 200 million."
Exxon,2017-7,"""In the last four years, we would have added two million additional connections. We are really ramping that up."""
Exxon,2017-7,"If Pakistan achieves its ambitious development goals, it could significantly erode market oversupply, which has helped pull down Asian LNG spot prices by more than 70 percent since 2014 to around $5 per million British thermal units (mmBtu)."
Exxon,2017-7,"Abbasi said Pakistan is in talks with Russia, Indonesia, Malaysia and Oman about government-to-government deals for up to three monthly LNG cargoes for its second terminal, which can import 600 million cubic feet of gas per day, equal to six cargoes a month."
Exxon,2017-7,"""We have a basic idea of what the market is. So if we are able to better those prices through negotiated procurement, we will go with that, otherwise we might float some more tenders,"" Abbasi said."
Exxon,2017-7,"Tenders for two of the terminal's six cargoes have already been won by trading house Gunvor and Italy's Eni , which have signed 5-year and 15-year deals, respectively. The contracts are worth about $5 billion over their lifetime. [nL8N1I43LO]"
Exxon,2017-7,Qatar supplies most of the gas for Pakistan's first LNG terminal.
Exxon,2017-7,"Abbasi said Pakistan is considering inviting private investors to build small-scale gas power plants to add another 3,000-4,000 megawatts to the network, on top of the three new LNG plants that will contribute 3,600 MW."

Exxon,2017-7,"Greece, under pressure by EU lenders to conclude the sale as it has earmarked about 180 million euros of the proceeds in this year's budget, relaunched the tender in June after a 400 million euro deal with Azerbaijan state oil company SOCAR fell through over gas tariffs among other issues. [nA8N1G500J]"
Exxon,2017-7,"""We anticipate that the price will be the same or even bigger (compared with the previous tender),"" Stathakis said in the interview published on Monday."
Exxon,2017-7,It has set a July 24 deadline for potential investors to submit initial expressions of interest.

Exxon,2017-7,"DOHA/LONDON, July 10 (Reuters) - Total is well placed to take a lead role in helping Qatar expand output from the world's largest gas field, largely thanks to its involvement in the Iranian side of the shared deposit, two sources familiar with Doha's thinking said."
Exxon,2017-7,"That puts the French oil major ahead of rivals like Exxon and Shell in the early running for developing the expansion, which the tiny Gulf state announced as it seeks to counter growing isolation caused by a regional diplomatic rift."
Exxon,2017-7,"Total boss Patrick Pouyanne signed a deal this month to develop the South Pars field, as Iran's part of the shared reserves are known, becoming the first oil major to return to the country since the lifting of sanctions. [nL8N1JU2W4]"
Exxon,2017-7,"As he was ironing out details of that agreement, he was careful to keep Qatar in the loop."
Exxon,2017-7,"""Of course, I won't go to the same field in Iran without telling Qatar,"" Pouyanne told Reuters."
Exxon,2017-7,"""The Iranian block where we are supposed to produce is next to the border with Qatar. When I travelled to Doha I discussed it with the (Qatari) authorities and they told us: 'It is ok - we know you'."""
Exxon,2017-7,"""I would expect Total to be in the strongest position for the new (Qatari) project, because of the political issues at play and their recent deals in (Iran's) South Pars,"" one senior Gulf energy source said."
Exxon,2017-7,"On one level, working with both countries who share a prized gas asset seems obvious. But it is not without risks for Total."
Exxon,2017-7,"Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt have imposed political and economic sanctions on Qatar, demanding that it stops fostering terrorism and courting Iran, Riyadh's main rival. Qatar denies the accusations."
Exxon,2017-7,"Besides Iran and Qatar, Total also has large projects in Saudi Arabia and the UAE, highlighting the complexity of investing in the Middle East. [nL8N1JW0KM]"
Exxon,2017-7,"Qatar, already the world's largest liquefied gas exporter, lifted a self-imposed ban on development of the North Field in April and last week it said it would raise gas output capacity by around 30 percent to 100 billion cubic metres."
Exxon,2017-7,The move was widely seen as a show of strength in its dispute with Gulf neighbours and Egypt. [nL8N1JV3LI]
Exxon,2017-7,"Qatar has built its gas export power over the past decade with support from global oil majors including ExxonMobil , Total, and Royal Dutch Shell . [nL8N1JW0KM]"
Exxon,2017-7,"The projects have generated billions of dollars for Qatar and its Western partners and the planned expansion to its gas capacity would make Qatar even more dominant in the gas market, accounting for a third of current global LNG output."
Exxon,2017-7,"Sources told Reuters earlier this month that Exxon, Shell and Total have all expressed interest in helping Qatar expand its gas facilities, with top executives travelling to Doha in recent weeks even after a spike in political tensions. [nL8N1JW5NC]"
Exxon,2017-7,"Exxon, Shell and Total declined to comment on plans to participate in Qatar's tenders to expand gas capacity, which are yet to be announced and will take several years to complete."
Exxon,2017-7,"Even without those tenders, Total's role in Qatar is set to grow significantly after it won a 30 percent stake in 2016 in a new 25-year contract to operate its largest offshore Al-Shaheen oilfield."
Exxon,2017-7,"Total, which will take over the field operation from Maersk Oil on July 14, plans to invest $2 billion in expanding the field over the next five years."
Exxon,2017-7,"With Qatar's gas production costs among the lowest in the world, being a part of any expansion would give Total a strategic advantage over rivals in the fast-growing global LNG market."
Exxon,2017-7,"Total's involvement in fields on both sides of the Qatari-Iranian border may also help save on costs and service contracts as well as better understand the fields' geology, although Pouyanne said there was no mechanism to coordinate production jointly by the countries."
Exxon,2017-7,"The development of the new capacity over the next 5-7 years could cost between $14-$18 billion, according to consultant Wood Mackenzie."
Exxon,2017-7,"""Qatar may also be keen to show it is still open for business despite the current diplomatic disputes with some of its Gulf neighbours,"" it said."

Exxon,2017-7,"HANOI/NEW DELHI, July 6 (Reuters) - Vietnam has extended an Indian oil concession in the South China Sea and begun drilling in another area it disputes with China in moves that could heighten tensions over who owns what in the vital maritime region."
Exxon,2017-7,"The moves come at a delicate time in Beijing's relations with Vietnam, which claims parts of the sea, and India, which recently sent warships to monitor the Malacca Straits, through which most of China's energy supplies and trade passes."
Exxon,2017-7,"Vietnam granted Indian oil firm ONGC Videsh a two-year extension to explore oil block 128 in a letter that arrived earlier this week, the state-run company's managing director Narendra K. Verma told Reuters."
Exxon,2017-7,"Part of that block is in the U-shaped 'nine-dash line' which marks the vast area that China claims in the sea, a route for more than $5 trillion in trade each year in which the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia and Taiwan also have claims."
Exxon,2017-7,"A senior official of ONGC Videsh, who asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter, said interest in the block was strategic rather than commercial, given that oil development there was seen as high-risk with only moderate potential."
Exxon,2017-7,"""Vietnam also wants us to be there because of China's interventions in the South China Sea,"" the official said."
Exxon,2017-7,"Vietnam's state-run PetroVietnam declined to comment on the concession, which was first granted to India in 2006 but had been due to expire in mid-June."
Exxon,2017-7,Conflicting territorial claims over the sea stretch back many decades but have intensified in recent years as China and its rivals have reinforced their positions on the rocks and reefs they hold.
Exxon,2017-7,"Far to the south of block 128, drilling has begun in a block owned jointly by Vietnam's state oil firm, Spain's Repsol and Mubadala Development Co [MUDEV.UL] of the United Arab Emirates."
Exxon,2017-7,"Deepsea Metro I, operated by Odfjell Drilling Ltd. , has been drilling in the region since the middle of last month on behalf of Spain's Repsol SA , which also has rights to neighbouring block 07/03, Odfjell said."
Exxon,2017-7,"Odfjell declined to comment on the specific location of its vessel, but shipping data from Thomson Reuters Eikon showed it was in oil block 136/3, which also overlaps China's claims."
Exxon,2017-7,"When asked about the activity, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said China opposes anyone ""carrying out unilateral, illegal oil and gas activities in waters China has jurisdiction over""."
Exxon,2017-7,"""We hope the relevant country can act on the basis of maintaining regional peace and stability and not do anything to complicate the situation,"" he told a briefing in Beijing."
Exxon,2017-7,Chinese General Fan Changlong cut short a visit to Vietnam and a friendship meeting at the China-Vietnam border was cancelled around the time the drilling began.
Exxon,2017-7,"The centuries-old mistrust between China and Vietnam is nowhere more evident than in their competing maritime claims, despite their shared communist ideology and growing trade."
Exxon,2017-7,"Asked about the most recent drilling, Vietnamese officials said their Chinese counterparts have started raising concerns about cooperation with both Repsol and ExxonMobil Corp. of the United States, which is developing the $10 billion ""Blue Whale"" gas concession off central Vietnam."
Exxon,2017-7,"They said Chinese officials also expressed concern at Vietnam's evolving security relationships with the United States and Japan, both of which have offered moral support for its South China Sea claims and help for Vietnam's coastguard."
Exxon,2017-7,"Tensions with China were being contained, however, and had not yet reached crisis proportions, they said."
Exxon,2017-7,"Underlining the relationship between India and Vietnam, Vietnamese deputy prime minister Pham Binh Minh told a forum in New Delhi this week that India was welcome to play a bigger role in Southeast Asia - and specifically the South China Sea."
Exxon,2017-7,Hanoi's growing defence and commercial ties with India are part of its strategy of seeking many partnerships with big powers while avoiding formal military alliances.
Exxon,2017-7,The pace has picked up since Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's administration took office in 2014 and sought to push back against China's expanding presence in South Asia by raising its diplomatic and military engagement in Southeast Asia.
Exxon,2017-7,"India is providing naval patrol boats, satellite cover to monitor Vietnam's waters and training for its submarines and fighter pilots - more military support than it is giving to any other Southeast Asian country."

Exxon,2017-7,"LONDON, July 5 (Reuters) - Three of the West's biggest energy corporations are lobbying Qatar to take part in a huge expansion of its gas production, handing Doha an unintended but timely boost in its bitter dispute with Gulf Arab neighbours."
Exxon,2017-7,"The chief executives of ExxonMobil, Royal Dutch Shell and France's Total all met the emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, in Qatar before it announced a plan on Tuesday to raise output of liquefied natural gas (LNG) by 30 percent."
Exxon,2017-7,Company and industry sources told Reuters that the CEOs had expressed interest in helping Qatar with its ambition to produce 100 million tonnes of LNG annually - equivalent to a third of current global supplies - in the next five to seven years.
Exxon,2017-7,"The companies already have large investments in countries on both sides of the dispute, and are keen to remain neutral after Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt severed ties with Doha on June 5. [nL8N1JW0KM]"
Exxon,2017-7,"Spokespeople from all three firms declined comment. However, a top executive from one energy major looking into expanding in Qatar said the huge business opportunity was worth the considerable political risk."
Exxon,2017-7,"Energy sales have powered Qatar's rapid rise as a regional player since the late 1990s, and the oil majors' interest in the LNG expansion underline its longer-term economic muscle during the political row with its neighbours."
Exxon,2017-7,Chief executives Darren Woods of Exxon and Ben van Beurden of Shell both met the emir after the four Arab countries imposed the sanctions. Total chief Patrick Pouyanne has also visited Doha in recent weeks.
Exxon,2017-7,"Qatar, the world's largest LNG supplier and second biggest gas exporter after Russia, has some of the lowest production costs. The plan was seen as an opening shot in a price war as Doha tries to defend its market share, especially against supplies from U.S. shale deposits where costs are higher."
Exxon,2017-7,"The four Arab countries, which have demanded Qatar stop fostering terrorism and courting Iran, said after meeting on Wednesday that Doha's response to their grievances had been negative."
Exxon,2017-7,"Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir said the political and economic boycott would remain until Qatar improved its policies. Further steps would be taken at the appropriate time, he said."

Exxon,2017-7,"Exxon, Shell and Total have already invested extensively in Qatar, particularly in projects to liquefy gas, allowing it to be shipped by tanker to consumer markets where transport by pipeline is not feasible."
Exxon,2017-7,"Woods met the emir on June 26, discussing ""cooperation"" with Qatar, where Exxon has been present since 1935, according to a statement carried by the state news agency."
Exxon,2017-7,"Industry sources close to the talks said that ""the Exxon CEO was very keen to join the new gas capacity expansion and expressed willingness to invest""."
Exxon,2017-7,"Woods replaced Rex Tillerson, under whom Exxon helped to build Qatar's LNG industry until he left to become U.S. Secretary of State earlier this year."
Exxon,2017-7,"Exxon will be the largest foreign investor in Qatar in 2017, with most money going into LNG facilities, representing around seven percent of its global portfolio, according to consultancy WoodMackenzie."
Exxon,2017-7,"Shell's Van Beurden was among the first foreign company leaders to visit Qatar after the crisis broke out, meeting the emir on June 14. This was followed several days later by a new deal under which Qatar will supply Shell, the world's largest LNG trader, with 1.1 million tonnes annually for five years starting in 2019."
Exxon,2017-7,"Shell's operations in Qatar include Pearl GTL, the world's largest gas liquefaction plant. Its overall investments in the state represent around six percent of its global portfolio."
Exxon,2017-7,"The three firms had been expecting Qatar to expand its LNG exports since it lifted a self-imposed moratorium on development of the North Field, the world's biggest natural gas field it shares with Iran, the sources said."
Exxon,2017-7,"Oil and gas companies generally are no strangers to operating in risky areas. This week Total became the first Western energy firm to invest in Iran since the lifting of sanctions against the country. The project, phase 11 of Iran's South Pars development, draws gas from the same reservoir as Qatar's North Field.[nL8N1JU2W4]"
Exxon,2017-7,"Total chief Pouyanne discussed new opportunities in the LNG sector as well as the company's plans to develop the Al-Shaheen oil field on his trip to Doha, according to a senior source."
Exxon,2017-7,"Qatar's LNG capacity could be boosted by up to 10 million tonnes per year relatively quickly and cheaply by optimising existing facilities and upgrading a small number of units, a process known as ""debottlenecking"", according to a senior industry source."
Exxon,2017-7,"Beyond that, the expansion would require building new liquefaction terminals involving significant investments, which the energy giants can offer."
Exxon,2017-7,"""Qatar LNG is really an important part of their overall portfolio, especially for Exxon but Total and Shell are also material LNG players there,"" Tom Ellacott, analyst at WoodMackenzie said."
Exxon,2017-7,"""Qatar LNG is very competitive. Debottlenecking will be a relatively cheap option to increase capacity, but with the industry at a low point in the cost cycle, it may also be a good time to install new terminals."""

Exxon,2017-7,"The French oil major has been working with Qatar since 1936 through cooperation with Qatar Petroleum in developing LNG, refining and petrochemicals projects."
Exxon,2017-7,"Total is one of the main partners of Qatargas, the world's largest LNG producer, owning stakes in Qatargas 1 and Qatargas 2. It is a main shareholder in the Dolphin Energy pipeline which transfers natural gas from Qatar to the UAE and Oman."
Exxon,2017-7,"It has joint ventures with Qatar Petroleum to develop the Al-Khalij and Al-Shaheen oil fields. Total Refining & Petrochemicals has stakes in both Qatar Petrochemicals Company (QAPCO), operating a petrochemical complex manufacturing ethylene and low-density polyethylene, and QATOFIN. Total is a partner in the Ras Laffan refinery and also sells lubricants."

Exxon,2017-7,"It also has a joint venture that markets and sells Shell lubricants, and another that handles aviation re-fueling operations in the kingdom."
Exxon,2017-7,"Shell currently does not own a direct stake in UAE's oil or gas fields as talks with ADNOC to renew its 40-year oil concession stalled. However, the company has its regional headquarters in Dubai, through which it manages its businesses in the Middle East."

Exxon,2017-7,"""We would have to figure out why Qatar is planning to boost its output.. We don't have plans yet to import new LNG cargoes from Qatar,"" said Kim Young-ki, a spokesman at Korea Gas Corp. (KOGAS), one of the world's biggest single LNG buyers."
Exxon,2017-7,Qatar's announcement came just a day after Iran signed its first deal with France's Total and China's state-owned oil company CNPC to produce gas from a field it shares with Qatar. [nL8N1JU2W4]
Exxon,2017-7,"Beveridge, at Sanford C. Bernstein, said Qatar's move to raise output ""could be a response to Total restarting development work"" on Iran's side of the gas reserves."
Exxon,2017-7,"Trying to cement its own market share, Russia's Gazprom the world's biggest single producer of natural gas, said late on Tuesday that it would start pumping gas to China through a new pipeline by late 2019, earlier than many expected. [nL8N1JW045]"
Exxon,2017-7,"China is already the top consumer of most commodities, including oil and coal, and as part of a huge investment programme to expand its LNG and pipeline infrastructure it is also on its way to become a top natural gas user."
Exxon,2017-7,"Australia has invested hundreds of billions of dollars in a bid to overtake Qatar as the world's top LNG exporter by 2019, a challenge Qatar is now rising to."
Exxon,2017-7,"Qatar, whose state-owned Qatar Petroleum has partnered with U.S. oil giant Exxon Mobil to produce its LNG, has a strong interest in defending its position."
Exxon,2017-7,"LNG, as well as exports of condensate, a super-light form of crude oil that's a byproduct of gas extraction, have made Qatar rich despite a 70 percent fall in LNG prices and a more than 50 percent drop in oil prices since 2014."
Exxon,2017-7,"Ramping up LNG exports to 100 million tonnes a year would, at current prices, reap revenues of around $30 billion, with another $6 billion coming from condensate."
Exxon,2017-7,"That equates to $120,000 per person, helping Qatar to become the world's richest nation, according to the World Bank."
Exxon,2017-7,"The main producers challenged by Qatar's move are those who have yet to attract a final investment decision, especially in the United States."
Exxon,2017-7,"So far only Cheniere exports U.S. LNG, but there are proposals with a total capacity of 150 million tonnes per year."
Exxon,2017-7,"Chong Zhi Xin, at energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie, said Qatar's low cost LNG expansion ""is pushing a lot of new projects out of the market""."
Exxon,2017-7,The winners in this aggressive fight for market share are consumers.
Exxon,2017-7,"""Expansion of LNG capacity translates to lower for longer LNG prices,"" said Kerry Anne Shanks, head of Asia gas and LNG research at Wood Mackenzie. ""That's good news for gas buyers."""

Exxon,2017-7,"DOHA, July 4 (Reuters) - Qatar announced plans for a steep rise in Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) production capacity on Tuesday that suggested it was ready for a protracted dispute with Gulf neighbours, but Doha said it was doing all it could to reach agreement."
Exxon,2017-7,"Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Bahrain were due to meet on Wednesday to decide whether to continue sanctions they imposed on Qatar on accusations it was aiding terrorism and courting regional rival Iran. Doha denies the charges and has submitted to mediator Kuwait replies to 13 demands that the gathering will consider."
Exxon,2017-7,"""What Qatar has given in goodwill and good initiative for a constructive solution, based on dialogue, we believe should be sufficient (to show) we have carried out our duties from our side,"" Qatari Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani told a news conference in Doha."
Exxon,2017-7,"""There is a lot of progress that has been made on that front (countering terrorism financing)... but of course there is always room for improvement,"" he said, describing the sanctions as illegal steps under the pretext of fighting terrorism."
Exxon,2017-7,"The three Gulf states and Egypt have severed diplomatic and transport ties with Doha in a dispute that has raised concern across the Middle East and beyond. Western states fear a lengthy dispute, besides threatening political instability, could upset supply chains in a region vital for energy supplies."
Exxon,2017-7,German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel told the same Doha news conference he felt Qatar had shown restraint in the row which began on June 5 when the Gulf states severed diplomatic and transport ties.
Exxon,2017-7,"Qatar says it is ready to meet any ""reasonable"" demands."
Exxon,2017-7,"But the Gulf state, with a population of just over two million to Saudi Arabia's 31 million, may be reluctant to carry out conditions such as the closure of the al-Jazeera television station and removal of a Turkish military base - matters it considers impinge on Qatari sovereignty."
Exxon,2017-7,"Qatar mounted what appeared to be a show of strength on Tuesday, when the state-owned Qatar Petroleum [QATPE.UL] announced plans to raise liquefied natural gas capacity by 30 percent. Its immediate effect will be to worsen a glut on the LNG market where Australia, the United States and Russia vie."
Exxon,2017-7,"LNG is natural gas liquified at low temperatures to reduce its volume, thus allowing it to be transported by tanker where pipelines are not feasible."
Exxon,2017-7,"Qatar Petroleum chief executive Saad al-Kaabi said the firm would increase gas production from its giant North Field, which it shares with Iran, by 20 percent after new gas development. In April, Qatar lifted a self-imposed ban on development of the North Field, the world's biggest natural gas field, and announced a new project to develop its southern section, increasing output in five to seven years. [nL5N1HB1RQ]"
Exxon,2017-7,"That new project will raise Qatar's total LNG production capacity by 30 percent to 100 million tonnes from 77 million tonnes per year in five to seven years, Kaabi said."
Exxon,2017-7,"With such low production costs and LNG facilities closer to buyers in Europe and Asia, the Qatari move means U.S. producers could struggle to sell their LNG competitively and projects still needing finance could struggle to find investors. So far only Cheniere exports U.S. LNG, but there are project proposals with a total capacity of some 150 million tonnes/year."
Exxon,2017-7,"Energy sales have driven Qatar's rapid rise as a regional player, with vast infrastructure projects and widening diplomatic influence as well as a role in the Syrian conflict that is viewed with suspicion by Gulf neighbours."
Exxon,2017-7,"The Saudi Ambassador to Sudan Ali Hassan Jaafar, speaking at a news conference, said he hoped the Gulf crisis would end ""in the coming hours"" with the Qatari response to demands."
Exxon,2017-7,The LNG glut has already driven down prices. Asian spot LNG prices LNG-AS have fallen more than 40 percent this year to $5.50 per mmBtu and by 70 percent from peaks in 2014.
Exxon,2017-7,"So far, the majority of LNG is supplied via long-term contracts between producers and users which allow little flexibility and in many cases also prevent importers from reselling cargoes. With supplies far outpacing demand, analysts expect more and more LNG to be freely traded."
Exxon,2017-7,Many producers have already started to offer contracts without resale or destination restrictions. [nL3N1J9338]
Exxon,2017-7,"Kaabi, alluding to suggestions that the Gulf states may ask trading partners to choose between them and Doha, said the company's operations would not be affected by the crisis."
Exxon,2017-7,"""Qatar Petroleum will continue working...If some companies decide they don't want to work with QP that's their choice. We will find other foreign companies to work with,"" he said."
Exxon,2017-7,"Analysts said the move to boost production was partly to do with added competition in the LNG market, mainly from Australia, the United States and Russia."
Exxon,2017-7,"""It is also to do with Iran now set to increase production on the South Pars field, which means they can up production from their side of the field (North Field) without destabilizing the geology of the field,"" said Oliver Sanderson, gas analyst at Thomson Reuters."
Exxon,2017-7,"Some experts say that, while the Gulf States accuse Qatar of cooperating too closely with Iran, their sanctions could push it to closer cooperation with Tehran on gas production and exports from the shared field."
Exxon,2017-7,"""Qatar needs the support of Iran now more than any time before. I don't believe it would be possible for Qatar to increase production without the cooperation with Iran, if in the long term the (political) situation stayed same as now,"" said Reza Mostafavi Tabatabaei, president of London-based ENEXD, a firm involved in oil and gas equipment in the Middle East."
Exxon,2017-7,"""Also, major (oil) companies may be asked to choose between working in Qatar or Saudi/UAE and Egypt, otherwise there be sanctions against them. That's why I don't think that developing this project by Qatar now will be as easy as before, politically not financially,"" he added."

Exxon,2017-7,"It also concluded that ""regulation would increase barriers to trade, increase product costs and potentially remove some products from the market""."
Exxon,2017-7,"A final version should be ready by July 17, the draft said, although the Commission said it could not confirm that date."
Exxon,2017-7,The Commission had asked for the report to help resolve an argument between fire safety campaigners and the plastics industry.
Exxon,2017-7,"""Member States are free to set their own requirements for building design and safety,"" a Commission spokeswoman said, when asked about the report and the possibility of new regulation."
Exxon,2017-7,Trade body Plastics Europe says there is no evidence new rules on the toxicity of smoke from building materials would save lives. But firefighters and other safety campaigners say labelling products according to their toxicity when burned is one simple way to address a lack of clear fire safety regulations for builders in the EU.
Exxon,2017-7,"EU officials, fire safety and industry representatives debated the draft report in Brussels on May 16."
Exxon,2017-7,"Among those present was Richard Hull, a professor of fire science at the University of Central Lancashire in England."
Exxon,2017-7,"""If I go to my laboratory and I develop a new insulation material which is excellent in many respects but is lethally toxic when it burns, there's no restriction on me selling that as a building product,"" he said."
Exxon,2017-7,"Plastics Europe, which represents companies such as ExxonMobil , Total and BASF , said new regulations would not be useful because there are multiple factors to consider when assessing the safety of a building."
Exxon,2017-7,"""A smoke toxicity criterion for construction products will not per se guarantee more safety in the eventuality of a fire,"" Plastics Europe said."
Exxon,2017-7,"Presently, the EU only sets standards to ensure construction materials can be shipped across borders within the bloc, although EU sources said the Commission had decided long before the Grenfell fire to draw up new rules to harmonise fire-safety tests for building facades."
Exxon,2017-7,Police investigating the cause of London's most deadly fire since World War Two have said it started in a faulty fridge and spread rapidly because of external cladding on the 24-storey building. The cladding used has since failed safety checks and prompted a review of the materials used on British buildings ranging from hospitals to hotels to apartment blocks. [nL8N1JL04P][nL8N1JP35L]
Exxon,2017-7,"Hull said the use of more synthetic materials in construction has made smoke more toxic, with insulation products such as polyisocyanurate (PIR) producing high yields of hydrogen cyanide and carbon monoxide when burned."
Exxon,2017-7,"Pressure group Fire Safe Europe says around 40 percent of deaths in fires are caused directly by smoke, while a further 20 percent are caused by a combination of severe burns and smoke."
Exxon,2017-7,"The body brings together fire fighters, representatives of the concrete and cable industries, and equipment and insulation companies including Danish-listed Rockwool and Germany's Knauf Insulation."
Exxon,2017-7,"""Smoke is playing a crucial role in modern fire behaviour. said Brussels firefighter Pieter Maes, who attended the May meeting. ""We need to take it into account in our testing of materials, to understand how smoke production from a certain material can influence how fire spreads."""
Exxon,2017-7,Czech Member of the European Parliament Pavel Poc told Reuters his Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats group would push the Commission for specific rules on smoke.
Exxon,2017-7,"""Testing and labelling could give the consumers the chance to choose between more or less toxic materials,"" he said."
