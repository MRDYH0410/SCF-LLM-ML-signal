Exxon,2017-5,"Greece has launched an ambitious programme to discover more oil and gas, encouraged by recent big large gas finds in the eastern Mediterranean and spurred on by its protracted financial crisis."

Exxon,2017-5,The existing deal is due to expire in 2024 and BP-led consortium and Azeri state oil firm SOCAR signed a letter of intent in December to continue developing the giant Azeri-Chirag-Guneshly (ACG) offshore fields until 2050.
Exxon,2017-5,"""End of June is a very reasonable time for it,"" Gary Jones, BP's regional head for Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey, told reporters when asked when the contract was due to be signed. ""It's a big deal. We want to get it right."""
Exxon,2017-5,"The shareholders in the consortium include BP, SOCAR, Chevron , INPEX <1605.T>, Statoil , ExxonMobil , TPAO, ITOCHU <8001.T> and ONGC Videsh ."
Exxon,2017-5,Azeri President Ilham Aliyev said on Wednesday he expected the contract to be signed soon.

Exxon,2017-5,"HOUSTON/BOSTON, May 31 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp has stepped up efforts to persuade investors to vote against climate-related proposals at Wednesday's annual meeting with a campaign of calling, writing and lobbying shareholders in person."
Exxon,2017-5,"The world's largest publicly traded oil company opposes a proposal requiring it to report on the risks to its business from new technologies and global climate change policies, insisting it already provides the information."
Exxon,2017-5,"Last year, the same proposal was backed by 38.1 percent of shares voted."
Exxon,2017-5,The stakes are higher this year. The business-impact issue is central to lawsuits by two state attorneys general alleging Exxon soft-peddled the risks to consumers and shareholders. Wall Street support of similar measures also has convinced energy companies including Occidental Petroleum to address the Paris climate accord's goal of keeping global temperature increases under 2-degrees Celsius. [nL2N1IK1TB]
Exxon,2017-5,"If the proposal garners less than last year's 38 percent support, it could endorse Exxon's view which is that its current reporting is appropriate, said Rob Schuwerk, senior counsel for environmental think tank Carbon Tracker Initiative."
Exxon,2017-5,"But if support this year exceeds 50 percent, the oil company likely would do more to explain potential business impacts from having to meet the Paris agreement's temperature goal. A result in between the two, he said, would be the ""the hazy middle"" that would still show growing investor interest in climate issues."
Exxon,2017-5,"Exxon took a conciliatory approach in a letter to investors on Tuesday. Vice President Jeff Woodbury wrote that on many of the shareholder proposals ""the corporation agrees with the underlying objective - we just have a different view on the best means to achieve it."""
Exxon,2017-5,"Prior shareholder letters insisted the proposals were misguided or ignored the company's efforts to spell out its position that even in world intent on limited temperature rises, it would still need more oil."
Exxon,2017-5,"Anne Sheehan, head of corporate governance at California State Teachers' Retirement System, which backs the additional climate reporting, said Exxon's letter suggests the voting is at least very close and may be going against the company."
Exxon,2017-5,"""You're not going to do an eleventh-hour shareholder communication if everything was going swimmingly,"" she said in an interview."
Exxon,2017-5,"In addition to the vote on the climate-impact report, Exxon holders will consider proposals to shift spending to dividends and buybacks from oil exploration and on a proposal to require a report on its efforts to restrict emissions of methane, a greenhouse gas."
Exxon,2017-5,"Exxon opposes all these proposals and has actively lobbied shareholders. This campaign ""is a lot more intense than normal,"" said one investor, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ""I think they're pulling out all the stops."""
Exxon,2017-5,"Climate campaigners are also active. They have organized rallies and held media briefings. In Dallas, where the meeting takes place, they have put up billboards and signs seeking to sway votes."
Exxon,2017-5,"Any change likely will be driven by institutional holders shifting their positions. Big investors including State Street Corp and BlackRock Inc , which together hold about 9 percent of Exxon shares, recently have made clear they are now giving more attention to climate issues. [nL1N1IS0KA]"
Exxon,2017-5,"Bob Litterman, chairman of the risk committee at asset-management firm Kepos Capital LP and who holds derivatives betting that oil companies will underperform the S&P 500 index, said no matter the outcome of the vote on Wednesday, pressures on Exxon to spell out the potential impact of a global warming on the value of its energy assets will only grow."
Exxon,2017-5,"""Whether it's shareholders or attorneys general or the passage of time, they're going to have to become honest about the potential for their assets to be stranded,"" or become uneconomic to pursue, said Litterman."

Exxon,2017-5,"Woods is due to attend the June 1-3 forum where Russian President Vladimir Putin will deliver the keynote speech, the sources said. A meeting between Woods and Putin is possible, one of the sources said."
Exxon,2017-5,"Woods visited Moscow in March to meet Putin. Russian energy minister Alexander Novak and the head of top Russian oil producer Rosneft , Igor Sechin, also attended. [nR4N1GE00X]"
Exxon,2017-5,"This year's forum is the first since Donald Trump became U.S. president. During his election campaign, Trump said he wanted to restore frayed relations with the Kremlin."
Exxon,2017-5,"Wood's predecessor, Rex Tillerson, now U.S. Secretary of State, appeared at last year's forum having stayed away for two years over Russia's intervention in Ukraine."
Exxon,2017-5,"In 2014, sanctions drove Exxon away from a joint project with Rosneft in the offshore Arctic Kara sea oil field, where both companies started - and then postponed - exploratory drilling."
Exxon,2017-5,"Rosneft and Exxon are also partners in the Pacific oil and gas project, Sakhalin-1, an Exxon-led venture that has been at odds with Russia's government over taxes. Sakhalin-1 is not subject to sanctions."

Exxon,2017-5,"NEW YORK, May 26 (Reuters) - Three fossil fuel industry groups dropped their attempt to intervene in a court case over climate change this week after failing to reach an agreement on a unified legal position on climate science, court filings show."
Exxon,2017-5,"The American Petroleum Institute (API) and the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM), prominent trade groups in the oil and gas industry, along with the American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers (AFPM), intervened in a federal case in which a group of teenagers sued the U.S. government for violating their constitutional rights by causing climate change."
Exxon,2017-5,The three groups were arguing that a judgment requiring the government to tighten environmental regulations would harm their business interests. But discord arose among them after a judge ordered them to submit a joint filing stating their views on climate science.
Exxon,2017-5,"A lawyer representing the three groups said in a court hearing on May 18 that they were unable to agree on the causes and effects of human activity and greenhouse gas emissions on the climate, transcripts of the proceedings show."
Exxon,2017-5,"""It seems pretty clear that the trade group intervenors have recognized that there may be costs as well as benefits to intervention and that they might be better off leaving the defense of the case to the government,"" said Seth Jaffe, an environmental lawyer who is a partner at Foley Hoag in Boston. He is not involved in the case."
Exxon,2017-5,"NAM was the first to file its request to withdraw, submitting it to the court on Monday. API asked to withdraw on Thursday. AFPM filed its request early on Friday."
Exxon,2017-5,"""What is noticeably absent from these withdrawal motions is the reason why the fossil fuel industry wants to leave the case,"" said Philip Gregory, a lawyer for the teen plaintiffs."
Exxon,2017-5,One issue for the industry groups is that laying out in court the scientific findings they accept on climate change could bind them to specific positions in other legal proceedings.
Exxon,2017-5,"Exxon Mobil , for instance, a member of both API and NAM, is battling with attorneys general in Massachusetts and New York who are investigating the company for fraud based on apparent discrepancies between its public stance on global warming and internal documents on climate science. [nL1N1CN11P]"
Exxon,2017-5,NAM spokeswoman Jennifer Drogus said the group had reevaluated its need to fight on behalf of the industry following the 2016 U.S. elections.
Exxon,2017-5,"""We no longer feel that our participation in this case is needed to safeguard industry and our workers,"" she said in an email on Friday."
Exxon,2017-5,API spokeswoman Sabrina Fang did not say why the industry group had asked to withdraw from the case.
Exxon,2017-5,"""We have full confidence that the courts will recognize that Congress and the Executive branch have the constitutional authority to write and execute the laws of the U.S.,"" she said in an email to Reuters on Thursday."
Exxon,2017-5,Spokespeople for AFPM did not immediately respond to request for comment.
Exxon,2017-5,"The API formed a ""Climate Change Task Force"" last year to form a new message on climate change. Fang, when asked by Reuters on May 19 if the force had made any changes to API's public stance on climate change, said: ""Nothing has changed."""
Exxon,2017-5,A spokeswoman for NAM did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Exxon,2017-5,"Exxon has been battling subpoenas from New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who is probing the company for fraud in its public statements about climate change.

Exxon,2017-5,"LONDON, May 23 (Reuters) - Companies' disclosure of risks to their business from climate change could become mandatory in a few years as investor pressure gathers pace, climate finance experts said on Tuesday."
Exxon,2017-5,"Investors have urged companies, particularly those operating in the oil, gas and coal sectors, to disclose the financial impact of long-term climate change and increase transparency as the world shifts away from fossil fuels."
Exxon,2017-5,"""I think we are moving towards the disclosure of climate change risks and stress testing of investments by companies. That is something which is gaining traction,"" John Roome, senior director of climate change at the World Bank, told an FT climate finance summit in London."
Exxon,2017-5,"""We are now in the voluntary stage but I suspect that in a few years we may very well see standardised requirements from various regulatory authorities on disclosure of climate risk,"" he added."
Exxon,2017-5,"Last year, a global task force set up by the G20's Financial Stability Board proposed that companies disclose in their public financial findings how they identify and manage risks to their business from climate change."
Exxon,2017-5,"Although the measures are voluntary, there are calls for them to become mandatory."
Exxon,2017-5,"This could happen in a few years and further ahead prudential requirements could be placed on potential stranded assets, Roome said, using a term for assets that no longer provide an economic return because of changes in the market or regulatory environment."
Exxon,2017-5,"Last year, institutions managing trillions of U.S. dollars of assets called for oil majors Exxon Mobil and Chevron to disclose the impact of curbing global temperature rise on their businesses, although shareholders narrowly voted against resolutions calling for such stress tests."
Exxon,2017-5,"On Tuesday, Royal Dutch Shell shareholders rejected a proposal by an environmental activist group demanding the oil major sets and publishes annual targets to reduce carbon emissions. [nL9N1BB01U]"
Exxon,2017-5,"There are also a number of financial regulators who argue that climate risk is not part of companies' core business, Roome said."
Exxon,2017-5,"Environmental lawyer Alice Garton at ClientEarth said existing laws apply to company disclosure where climate risks are material, or affect the economic decisions of shareholders."
Exxon,2017-5,There have already been lawsuits in the United States against Exxon Mobil and coal miner Peabody Energy Corp over disclosures related to climate change.
Exxon,2017-5,"ClientEarth said it had written to energy company BP , miner and trader Glencore and investors this week warning of the risk of investor lawsuits based on statements about future fossil fuel demand in their reporting."

Exxon,2017-5,"LONDON, May 23 (Reuters) - Companies' disclosure of risks to their business from climate change could become mandatory in a few years as investor pressure gathers pace, climate finance experts said on Tuesday."
Exxon,2017-5,"Investors have urged companies, particularly those operating in the oil, gas and coal sectors, to disclose the financial impact of long-term climate change and increase transparency as the world shifts away from fossil fuels."
Exxon,2017-5,"""I think we are moving towards the disclosure of climate change risks and stress testing of investments by companies. That is something which is gaining traction,"" John Roome, senior director of climate change at the World Bank, told an FT climate finance summit in London."
Exxon,2017-5,"""We are now in the voluntary stage but I suspect that in a few years we may very well see standardised requirements from various regulatory authorities on disclosure of climate risk,"" he added."
Exxon,2017-5,"Last year, a global task force set up by the G20's Financial Stability Board proposed that companies disclose in their public financial findings how they identify and manage risks to their business from climate change."
Exxon,2017-5,"Although the measures are voluntary, there are calls for them to become mandatory. This could happen in a few years and further ahead, prudential requirements could be placed on potential stranded assets, Roome said."
Exxon,2017-5,"Last year, institutions managing trillions of U.S. dollars of assets called for oil majors Exxon Mobil and Chevron to disclose the impact of curbing global temperature rise on their businesses, although shareholders narrowly voted against resolutions calling for such stress tests."
Exxon,2017-5,Investors are also pushing oil giant Royal Dutch Shell to explain the finer details of its plan to link executives' bonus pay to lowering carbon emissions. [nL8N1II59A]
Exxon,2017-5,"However, there are a number of financial regulators who argue that climate risk is not part of companies' core business, Roome said."
Exxon,2017-5,"Environmental lawyer Alice Garton at ClientEarth said existing laws apply to company disclosure where climate risks are material, or affect the economic decisions of shareholders."
Exxon,2017-5,There have already been lawsuits in the United States against Exxon Mobil and coal miner Peabody Energy Corp over disclosures related to climate change.
Exxon,2017-5,"ClientEarth said it had written to energy company BP , miner and trader Glencore and investors this week warning of the risk of investor lawsuits based on statements about future fossil fuel demand in their reporting."
Exxon,2017-5,"""It is highly likely that more cases like Peabody and Exxon arise in the future. Class action lawyers have become very clever at developing these cases for profit,"" said Garton, company and financial project leader at ClientEarth."

Exxon,2017-5,"{{20170522T110001.478+0000}}Ahead of Exxon's annual meeting, climate activists gain groundBy Ross Kerber"
Exxon,2017-5,"BOSTON, May 22 (Reuters) - Shareholder activists focused on climate issues are gaining traction in their push to have large energy companies and utilities take account of the impact rising global temperatures could have on their businesses."
Exxon,2017-5,Proponents ranging from giant New York and California state pension funds to Wespath Investment Management of Illinois scored a number of victories this month.
Exxon,2017-5,Those include a resolution at PPL Corp approved by 57 percent of votes cast calling for the utility holding company to publicly report how it could be affected by policies and technologies aimed at limiting global warning.
Exxon,2017-5,"The PPL result comes on the heels of a vote at Occidental Petroleum Corp on a similar resolution, backed by two-thirds of votes cast. Also, top proxy advisers recommended votes in favor of a third such resolution set for Exxon Mobil Corp's annual meeting on May 31.[nL4N1IL1K7]"
Exxon,2017-5,"Activists say the developments suggest they are at an inflection point after years of seeking support from big institutional investors like BlackRock Inc. The giant New York asset manager switched sides in this year's vote at Occidental, citing concerns about the company's pace of disclosures to date.[nL1N1IE20Q]"
Exxon,2017-5,"The reports the activists have sought through the advisory shareholder resolutions are sometimes known as ""2 degree scenario analysis"" reports after the goal of the 2015 Paris climate accord to limit global temperature increases to 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) from preindustrial levels by phasing out fossil fuels."
Exxon,2017-5,"The limits could hit companies' bottom lines such as by reducing the revenue they can expect from extracting fossil fuel reserves. Activists hope that having the companies lay out plans for dealing with future regulatory, technology and market changes will smooth their transition to cleaner energy."
Exxon,2017-5,"Edward Kamonjoh, executive director of the 50/50 Climate Project in Washington, which supports the resolutions, said actions by U.S. President Donald Trump like the dismantling of Obama-era climate policies may have moved big investors to take on a more active role."
Exxon,2017-5,"While Trump has not so far followed through on a campaign promise to take the United States out of the Paris deal, investors cannot count on strong environmental regulations in the future, he said."
Exxon,2017-5,"""Investors who feel that climate is a risk now realize they just have themselves to manage this risk in the next few years,"" Kamonjoh said."
Exxon,2017-5,"Most energy company and utility boards have urged their investors to oppose the measures, some arguing they already take climate change seriously."
Exxon,2017-5,A key test of investors' mood will come at the end of May at Exxon. The largest U.S. oil & gas producer argues a climate report is unnecessary because it already conducts reviews that sufficiently test its business for impacts from changing technology and energy demand.
Exxon,2017-5,"Exxon has offered other arguments including that it supports the Paris agreement, Exxon Secretary Jeffrey Woodbury told investors in a May 18 letter, and that it has invested nearly $7 billion since 2000 on emissions-reduction technology."
Exxon,2017-5,"At PPL, spokesman Ryan Hill said via e-mail that its board ""will carefully consider the results and determine the best path forward."" PPL is committed to sustainable energy, he said, noting steps it has taken such as retiring coal plants and building Kentucky's largest solar power facility."
Exxon,2017-5,"Some companies have made changes even without votes. Activists including Wespath on May 2 said they withdrew a call for a climate-change report from Chevron Corp, citing an 18-page document Chevron issued in March titled ""Managing Climate Risks"" as a good first step."
Exxon,2017-5,"While it did not analyze all the scenarios sought by activists, the report went further than past efforts to outline how climate change could affect its profitability."
Exxon,2017-5,"Chevron CEO John Watson said in the report he ""shares the concerns of governments and the public about climate change risks."""
Exxon,2017-5,"Also, Danielle Fugure, president of California nonprofit As You Sow, said last month it withdrew a shareholder resolution calling for a climate risk report from Anadarko Petroleum Corp.. In return, she said, the Texas company agreed to continue to work with her group and others to develop methods for reporting on climate risks that would be practical for the company but still convey to investors the full extent of the risks it could face."
Exxon,2017-5,"Anadarko spokesman John Christiansen confirmed the agreement. ""We are consistently looking for ways to further enhance sustainability in our operations, as well as improve transparency regarding these efforts,"" he said via e-mail."
Exxon,2017-5,"Fugure said the high vote totals such as at Occidental show how climate change is becoming an accepted business issue. ""The market itself is moving to take carbon risk into account, and the market itself will be pricing carbon risk into the value of companies,"" she said."

Exxon,2017-5,"""If the result is not enough, we have 5 percent discretion from the minister. If that's still not enough, now we have a problem."""
Exxon,2017-5,"The latest offer includes 10 conventional blocks and 5 non-conventional oil and gas blocks and all will be offered under a gross split production sharing contract scheme, Wiratmaja Puja, director general of oil and gas told reporters."
Exxon,2017-5,"Unlike the conventional pools of oil and natural gas, unconventional oil and natural gas do not flow naturally through the rock, making them much more difficult to produce."
Exxon,2017-5,"Shale gas: 1. Jambi I 2. Jambi II Coal bed methane: 1. Raja (South Sumatra) 2. Bungamas (South Sumatra) 3. West Air Komering (South Sumatra) Indonesia offered a total of 17 oil and gas blocks last year, according to Tunggal, Indonesia's upstream oil and gas director."
Exxon,2017-5,"""There were lots of bids, but because of evaluations in the end there was only one winner,"" he said."
Exxon,2017-5,"Thin interest in the 2016 tender was a result of low oil prices, among other factors, said Tahar, who denied that Indonesia was unattractive to energy investors."
Exxon,2017-5,"""It wasn't the (investment) climate, but there was a combination of what investors' strategies were like (and) oil prices were down,"" Tahar told reporters, noting that the recently introduced gross split mechanism had not proven to be more or less attractive yet."
Exxon,2017-5,"""In fact we are now more open to change things that never used to be changed. We have opened everything now,"" he added."
Exxon,2017-5,"""When oil prices pick up (investment) doesn't necessarily go up. It's slow - there's a lag."""
Exxon,2017-5,"But industry participants were less enthusiastic about the latest offer, and said more work is still needed to make Indonesia attractive."
Exxon,2017-5,"""In Indonesia at the moment, the returns are difficult, the time to get a return is too long, and the risk of political involvement is quite high,"" said Andrew Harwood, director of Asia Pacific upstream oil and gas research at WoodMackenzie."
Exxon,2017-5,"""So it's difficult for Indonesia at the current stage to get the gross split to be attractive against other opportunities oil and gas companies have elsewhere,"" he said referring to opportunities in the Gulf of Mexico, Africa, Europe and Australia."
Exxon,2017-5,"""Indonesia is less economically competitive than other countries,"" said one executive at an international oil company operating in Indonesia, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter."
Exxon,2017-5,"""Production is going down in oil and gas, while a lot of countries are increasing, so I think that says it all."""
Exxon,2017-5,"Despite President Joko Widodo's efforts to improve the ease of doing business for energy investors in Indonesia, there is ""still much more work to do,"" he said."
Exxon,2017-5,"Countries that have traditionally done a very good job in attracting capital from energy investors were those that provided competitive fiscal terms, contract sanctity and a stable regulatory regime, he said."

Exxon,2017-5,{{20170517T235233.530+0000}}NAFTA demise fears fade as U.S. firms committed to Mexico -lobbyBy Dave Graham and Ana Isabel Martinez
Exxon,2017-5,"MEXICO CITY, May 17 (Reuters) - Companies no longer fear the North American Trade Agreement (NAFTA) will collapse and top U.S. multinationals in Mexico are committed to investing in the country going forward, the head of a global business lobby said on Wednesday."
Exxon,2017-5,"Frederic Garcia, President of Mexico's Executive Council of Global Companies (CEEG), said preparations to renegotiate NAFTA and growing awareness of the accord's economic benefits had all but put an end to fears that the deal would be scrapped."
Exxon,2017-5,"""There was a moment where the probability, or the perception that NAFTA would end, was very strong,"" Garcia said in an interview in Mexico City. ""But today I think there's an awareness that it will continue. The big worry that the deal could come to an end is an issue that's behind us."""
Exxon,2017-5,"The CEEG represents a host of multinationals in Mexico including AT&T Inc , Coca-Cola Co , General Motors Co , Microsoft Corp , Exxon Mobil Corp , Nestle, HSBC, Siemens and IBM Corp , which it says account for around 40 percent of total foreign direct investment."
Exxon,2017-5,"It and other business associations have been active in extolling the benefits of NAFTA to Americans to counter threats by U.S. President Donald Trump to dump the 23 year-old accord that binds the United States, Mexico and Canada."
Exxon,2017-5,"Mexico's Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo said on Tuesday he expected the U.S. government to notify Congress early next week of plans to rework the accord, yielding talks by late August. [nL2N1II1AT]"
Exxon,2017-5,"It was not yet clear how NAFTA would be revamped, but if Mexico's efforts to update its free trade deal with the European Union proved instructive, it could include provisions to boost corporate compliance and adherence to the law, Garcia said."
Exxon,2017-5,"Trump said last month he was ready to renegotiate NAFTA with Mexico and Canada, though since taking the presidency in January he also has maintained that the United States could withdraw from the agreement if talks did not work in favor of his homeland. [nL1N1I0047]"
Exxon,2017-5,"Arguing the accord has destroyed U.S. jobs, Trump has menaced multinationals manufacturing in Mexico with punitive tariffs, and his threats to quit NAFTA. This sent the peso to a record low in January."
Exxon,2017-5,"Earlier that month Ford abruptly canceled a $1.6 billion plant in central Mexico following verbal attacks by Trump. But as the rhetoric from the White House began to moderate, the peso has recovered somewhat, and fears for NAFTA's future have eased."
Exxon,2017-5,"Last week, a Mexican business lobby said it expected investment to drop slightly this year due to uncertainty over Trump, but Garcia said the CEEG would make no forecasts over projected outlays to avoid drawing attention to the matter."
Exxon,2017-5,"""As far as the U.S. firms in the CEEG go, from the first day of the new U.S. administration they've stated their great interest to continue operating in Mexico (and) their great interest to continue investing in Mexico,"" he said."
Exxon,2017-5,"However, they had done so in such a way as to preserve their interests with the U.S. administration, Garcia added."
Exxon,2017-5,"{{20170517T234118.016+0000}}UPDATE 3-Exxon says to open gas stations in Mexico, invest $300 mln(Adds details, report on Shell gas stations)"
Exxon,2017-5,"MEXICO CITY, May 17 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp announced it will bring its Mobil-brand gas stations to Mexico, pumping $300 million in the coming decade as it seeks to gain a foothold in the country's retail fuel market."
Exxon,2017-5,"Exxon expects to open its first service stations in Mexico later this year and will offer motorists its Synergy gasoline and diesel fuels, the U.S.-based oil company said in a statement on Wednesday."
Exxon,2017-5,The company did not specify how many service stations it would open in Mexico or where it would source the fuel for them. But local newspaper Reforma reported on Wednesday that Exxon company official Martin Proske said in an interview that supply options included importing fuel via train or boat or buying gasoline from state-owned Pemex [PEMX.UL].
Exxon,2017-5,"The plan follows BP Plc's announcement earlier this year that the British oil giant would open about 1,500 service stations in Mexico within five years."
Exxon,2017-5,"BP told Reuters on Wednesday that its foray into Mexico is proving more promising than expected, and that it would likely increase its investment in everything from exploration to retail fuel sales. [nL2N1IJ13S]"
Exxon,2017-5,"Separately, Mexican media reported Royal Dutch Shell said it would also open its first gas station in the country this year, citing the firm's downstream chief for Mexico, Andres Cavallari. Shell did not immediately reply to requests for comment."
Exxon,2017-5,"Latin America's No. 2 economy is home to about 11,400 gas stations and is the world's fourth biggest gasoline market, Mexico's energy minister has said."
Exxon,2017-5,"For decades, Mexico's fuel market was closed - by law - to any company but Pemex. But in 2013, reforms ended Pemex's monopoly in everything from crude oil production to retail sales."
Exxon,2017-5,"""Recent energy reforms present a unique opportunity to help meet the growing demand for reliable fuel supplies and quality service in Mexico,"" Exxon's Proske said in a company statement."
Exxon,2017-5,"Fears had grown in Mexico that foreign investment might fall after U.S. President Donald Trump was elected last year, as he railed against companies that moved operations to Mexico."
Exxon,2017-5,U.S.-Mexico relations have also been strained by Trump's threat to ditch the North American Free Trade Agreement and his promise to build a wall between the two countries.
Exxon,2017-5,But Exxon's announcement was the latest good news for Mexico's economy after General Electric Co last week praised the country as vital to its growth and Siemens later said that it was going to swap out U.S. imports for local supplies at its Mexican plants. [nL2N1IH1WG] [nL1N1IE18Z]
Exxon,2017-5,"However, growing fuel theft has worried some in the energy sector. Mexican authorities have been struggling to contain criminal gangs siphoning off fuel that Pemex has said is costing it some 27,000 barrels per day in gasoline and diesel."
Exxon,2017-5,{{20170517T181615.991+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-Running government like business proves difficult(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are her own.)
Exxon,2017-5,"Trump touted his business acumen, as a successful builder of shiny skyscrapers and reality-TV celebrity, as the solution to making America great again. He stacked his administration with corporate and finance executives from places like Exxon Mobil and Goldman Sachs . He said his skills as a dealmaker would help forge beautiful trade pacts and a huge tax-reform plan. Voters fell for the pitch."
Exxon,2017-5,"Yet though he spent his career in the public eye, the Trump Organization is a private family business. His three eldest children were executives at the firm, along with a handful of loyal longtime associates. Trump, though, was the decider and rarely answered to outsiders, though he had to deal with creditors in his four bankruptcies. Alan Garten, general counsel for Trump's company, summed it up in an interview with Corporate Counsel in 2016: ""At the end of the day, I work for the Trump family."""
Exxon,2017-5,"As a consequence, Trump never faced the kind of oversight that comes with being the chief executive of a public company. At the top is the board of directors, who are elected by shareholders and have a fiduciary obligation to serve them. The CEO reports to the board, which assesses management, and increasingly an independent chairman. The directors typically base a chief executive's compensation on how the company performed over a fiscal year."
Exxon,2017-5,"The limits of Trump's informal style, which might have worked when licensing his name out to hoteliers in Azerbaijan or a Chinese maker of ties, is most evident in the White House's frequent communications missteps. Last week, for instance, administration officials offered explanations for Comey's firing that were then contradicted by the commander-in-chief in a televised interview."
Exxon,2017-5,"At public companies, it is imperative for chief executives to scale their messages far and wide, from their deputies down to their front-line staff, and across to investors, suppliers, customers, union officials and politicians. Trump didn't need to do that in private business, and is failing to ensure the members of his administration are on the same page on important matters ranging from Comey to trade."
Exxon,2017-5,"The system isn't perfect and many times boards are too entrenched and slow to respond, while directors are chummy with management. But it provides some accountability and boards can also punish executives for screwing up. To wit, Barclays directors have pledged to cut CEO Jes Staley's pay by a ""very significant"" amount for trying to find out the identity of a whistleblower."
Exxon,2017-5,"Even some private companies have implemented changes after CEO missteps. In February, Uber [UBER.UL] hired former Attorney General Eric Holder to investigate allegations of sexual harassment. In March, Uber CEO Travis Kalanick said he was on the lookout for a No. 2 after he acknowledged he ""must fundamentally change as a leader and grow up."" He had lashed out at an Uber driver complaining about reduced prices, which was caught on video."
Exxon,2017-5,"Of course, the White House is different from a public company and the bar for admonishing or ousting a president should be very high. It was Trump, however, who promised to bring business savvy to government, so should be judged accordingly. His victory benefited the Republican Party, which cemented control of the House of Representatives and the Senate."
Exxon,2017-5,"So to complete the corporate analogy, it falls on the majority party, particularly in the Senate, to act as the most important check on the president. That means Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell effectively plays the role of lead independent director. If he fails to correct the course of dysfunction, Congress can expect to feel the wrath of shareholders, that is, American voters."
Exxon,2017-5,"- U.S. President Donald Trump asked former FBI Director James Comey to end the agency's investigation into former National Security Adviser Mike Flynn and his ties to Russia, the New York Times reported May 16. The White House denied that Trump made such a request to Comey, who was fired on May 9. Flynn resigned in February after making misstatements to Vice President Mike Pence about his past conversations with Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak."
Exxon,2017-5,"- Kislyak and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov met with Trump in the White House on May 10. The Washington Post reported on May 15 that Trump revealed classified information about a planned Islamic State operation to those Russian officials. Trump tweeted on May 16 that he has an ""absolute right"" to share facts about the fight against terrorism with Russian officials. The FBI is investigating Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election and potential ties to Trump's campaign."

Exxon,2017-5,"LEA COUNTY, N.M., May 17 (Reuters) - As oilfield workers for Lilis Energy Inc threaded together drill pipes one recent morning in the Permian Basin, a bulldozer cleared sagebrush to make way for the company's fifth well since January."
Exxon,2017-5,Lilis aims to expand production sevenfold this year in America's most active oilfield.
Exxon,2017-5,"The whir of activity is all the more impressive after the small firm nearly collapsed in late 2015 - amid unrestrained production from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). As per-barrel prices plummeted, Lilis piled on debt and struggled to pay workers."
Exxon,2017-5,Now - with prices higher after a November OPEC decision to cut output - Lilis can't grow fast enough.
Exxon,2017-5,"Such resurrections are common these days in the Permian, which stretches across West Texas and eastern New Mexico. They tell the story of the U.S. shale resurgence and the quandary it poses for OPEC as it struggles to tame a global glut."
Exxon,2017-5,"Surging U.S. production has stalled OPEC's effort to cut supply. Inventories in industrialized nations totaled 3.05 billion barrels in February - about 330 million barrels above the five-year average, according to the International Energy Agency."
Exxon,2017-5,The Permian boom will be high on the agenda as OPEC oil ministers begin gathering in Vienna ahead of a May 25 policy meeting to decide whether to extend output cuts.[nL4N1IA1M6]
Exxon,2017-5,"In the long term, too much U.S. output could spur OPEC to open the spigots again - setting off another price war - but for now its member nations' need for revenue makes that unlikely."
Exxon,2017-5,"On Monday, the world's top two oil producers - OPEC heavyweight Saudi Arabia and Russia, a non-OPEC nation - said they had agreed in principle on the need to continue output cuts for an additional nine months, through March 2018. [nL4N1IH4FH]"
Exxon,2017-5,"That would extend the initial agreement, which took effect in January and reduced production by 1.2 barrels per day (bpd) from OPEC nations and another 600,000 bpd from non-OPEC producers, including Russia."
Exxon,2017-5,The pledge to extend cuts marked an evolution in the thinking of Saudi Arabia Oil Minister Khalid al-Falih - in response to surging U.S. output.
Exxon,2017-5,"After OPEC's decision in November, Al-Falih expressed confidence that no further supply curbs would be needed because of rising demand."
Exxon,2017-5,"Then in March, Al-Falih told a Houston energy conference that the ""green shoots"" in U.S. shale might be ""growing too fast"" - and warned there would be no ""free rides"" for U.S. producers benefiting from OPEC production cuts."
Exxon,2017-5,"But by last week, Al-Falih vowed OPEC would do ""whatever it takes"" to control oversupply."
Exxon,2017-5,"Unlike OPEC nations, U.S. firms are barred by anti-trust laws from colluding to control output or prices, leaving market demand as the only check on production."
Exxon,2017-5,"""I'm really proud American production is offsetting those OPEC cuts,"" said Lilis Chief Executive Avi Mirman."
Exxon,2017-5,Now it appears the free ride for U.S. shale producers will continue at least into next year.

Exxon,2017-5,"FAIRBANKS, Alaska, May 11 (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson signed an agreement recognizing the landmark Paris climate accord at a meeting of Arctic nations in Alaska on Thursday, but said President Donald Trump was not rushing to decide whether to leave or weaken U.S. commitments to the pact."
Exxon,2017-5,Trump's efforts to dilute U.S. climate policies have made the country an outlier on the issue and put Tillerson in an awkward position at a meeting of the Arctic Council.
Exxon,2017-5,"The council meets every two years to tackle climate change and other problems facing the North. The Arctic is warming at a faster pace than any other part of the world, forcing native villagers on coasts and rivers in the region to move to higher ground as permafrost and glaciers melt and seas rise."
Exxon,2017-5,Global warming also puts stress on wildlife such as walruses and polar bears as they lose their habitat areas.
Exxon,2017-5,"The Arctic agreement Tillerson signed with foreign ministers from the other seven nations of the council, including Russia, Canada and Norway, made only a passing reference to the Paris pact. It noted ""entry into force"" of the pact and its implementation and called for global action to reduce greenhouse gas pollution."
Exxon,2017-5,"Still, Tillerson's signing of the document surprised a source close to the State Department. ""We'd heard ... that there would likely be a significant U.S. effort to redline or even remove entirely the Paris and climate language,"" said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitive nature of the talks."
Exxon,2017-5,"Tillerson signed the agreement at a dinner the council members ate together on Wednesday night after hours of debate before the meal, Denmark's Foreign Minister Anders Samuelsen told Reuters. The ministers stressed to Tillerson the business benefits, as well as the advantages to the environment and Arctic natives, of taking action on climate, Samuelsen said. Tillerson, a former chief executive of Exxon Mobil is one of Trump's advisers who supports staying in the agreement."
Exxon,2017-5,"""He was happy about it; he seemed to be satisfied. We all were because it's a big step,"" Samuelsen said."
Exxon,2017-5,"A local tribal leader also pressured Tillerson to act at a celebration of the council on Wednesday. ""We the tribes ask you to listen to our land. It's telling us to implement promises to slow the change,"" Chairman Victor Joseph of the Tanana Chief Conference said before Tillerson was introduced at the celebration."
Exxon,2017-5,"It was unclear how much influence the Arctic agreement, signed late on Wednesday and made public on Thursday, would influence Trump's decision."
Exxon,2017-5,"Tillerson told the council the Trump administration was reviewing how it will approach climate change but was not going to rush to make a decision on Paris. ""We are appreciative that each of you has an important point of view,"" said Tillerson. ""We are going to make the right decision for the United States,"" said Tillerson."
Exxon,2017-5,Trump is expected to make a decision on Paris after a Group of Seven summit at the end of May.
Exxon,2017-5,"Finland's Foreign Minister Timo Soini, whose country will chair the council for the next two years, praised U.S. leadership in the Arctic Council, but added that the Paris pact is an important tool in fighting climate change."
Exxon,2017-5,"Arctic warming is thawing permafrost and melting sea ice, causing damage to infrastructure but also opening up new oil reserves, shipping routes and access to fisheries - intensifying a decades-long race for Arctic resources."
Exxon,2017-5,"Adding pressure on Trump, scientists from the United States and other Arctic nations issued a report ahead of the meeting warning that the warming could lead to trillions of dollars worth of damage to buildings, roads and other infrastructure this century. [nL8N1HS53K]."
Exxon,2017-5,"The council also signed an agreement on sharing science and data on the Arctic, an effort led by Russia and the United States, and addressed Arctic search and rescue and communications."
Exxon,2017-5,"Trump's administration has already reversed Obama-era bans on offshore drilling in certain parts of the Arctic, a turn that could intensify competition for resources in the region with major oil producer Russia."
Exxon,2017-5,"Russia has beefed up its military presence in the Arctic to levels not seen since the fall of the Soviet Union, as global interest in the region's oil, gas and rare earth metals heats up. [nL5N1FG40N]"

Exxon,2017-5,{{20170515T205953.874+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-Investors may impose a climate change upon Exxon(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are her own.)
Exxon,2017-5,"DALLAS, May 15 (Reuters Breakingviews) - The shareholder climate appears to be changing at Exxon Mobil . The New York State Common Retirement Fund has put a proposal on the company's proxy urging it to increase disclosures about the risks climate change poses to its business. After a similar proposal passed last week at Occidental Petroleum , the $350 billion oil giant will find it hard to resist the tide."
Exxon,2017-5,"Meanwhile the world is headed in another direction. Nearly 200 countries pledged to take action under the Paris climate-change agreement of 2015. Though President Donald Trump has threatened to pull out from this agreement, many companies as well as city and state municipalities are stepping up efforts to increase their use of clean energy. Renewable energy increased nearly a third in the U.S. between 2010 and 2015, according to data from the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy."
Exxon,2017-5,"Pension funds smartly want assurances that the world's largest oil company won't be left behind. The New York fund is calling for more disclosure around how a global push to clean energy is going to affect Exxon's business, including the value of its hefty oil and gas reserves."
Exxon,2017-5,"A similar proposal by the New York fund fell short last year, garnering support from just 38 percent of shareholders. The recent vote at Occidental will make it hard for other Exxon shareholders to resist. The support of BlackRock , the third-largest shareholder at Exxon, effectively sealed that vote. So long as the changing climate can affect earnings, shareholders should demand more disclosure."
Exxon,2017-5,- Proxy advisors Glass Lewis on May 6 recommended that shareholders at Exxon Mobil support a proposal calling on the company to publish an annual assessment of the long-term impact of climate-change policies and technological advances on its oil and gas reserves.
Exxon,2017-5,"- The proposal was put forward by the New York State Common Retirement Fund and the Church Commissioners of England. On May 12, shareholders of Occidental Petroleum approved a proposal that would require the company to report the business impacts of climate change."

Exxon,2017-5,"JOHANNESBURG, May 15 (Reuters) - South Africa's government may award its first shale gas exploration licences by the end of September, after environmental objections delayed the process, a senior government official said on Monday."
Exxon,2017-5,The five licence applications under review are for exploration in the semi-arid Karoo basin.
Exxon,2017-5,"Environmentalists criticised plans to work in the sparsely populated region, known for its rugged scenery and home to rare species such as the mountain zebra and riverine rabbit."
Exxon,2017-5,"Royal Dutch Shell , Falcon Oil and Gas and Bundu Gas & Oil are among five firms whose applications were being reviewed by the regulator, acting Petroleum Agency SA (PASA) Chief Executive Lindiwe Mekwe told Reuters."
Exxon,2017-5,PASA would make recommendations to Mineral Resources Minister Mosebenzi Zwane to decide on the licence awards.
Exxon,2017-5,"""We anticipate that the minister will be in a position to make a determination during the second or third quarter,"" Mekwe said."
Exxon,2017-5,"""If the decision is made this year the exploration rights will be valid for a period of three years, exploration activities should commence within three years,"" she said."
Exxon,2017-5,South Africa is seeking to replace its dwindling offshore gas reserves and reduce reliance on coal to fuel power plants.
Exxon,2017-5,Shell said last year its Karoo project could compete in its global shale gas and oil portfolio provided commercial terms were attractive. It had previously pulled back from the plans due to low energy prices and licence delays. [nL5N16G4CZ]

Exxon,2017-5,{{20170515T100001.886+0000}}U.S. companies push hard for lower tax rate on offshore profitsBy Ginger Gibson
Exxon,2017-5,"WASHINGTON, May 15 (Reuters) - Major U.S. multinationals are pushing the Trump administration to deepen the tax break it has already tentatively proposed on $2.6 trillion in corporate profits being held offshore, a key piece in Washington's intricate tax reform puzzle."
Exxon,2017-5,"As President Donald Trump tries to deliver on his campaign promise to overhaul the tax code, lobbyists for technology, drug and other manufacturers are working with officials behind closed doors, six lobbyists working with various industries told Reuters."
Exxon,2017-5,"In line with tax cuts already embraced by Republicans in the House of Representatives, the lobbyists said they are telling the White House and Treasury Department that if companies are forced to bring home, or repatriate, foreign earnings, they want a sharply reduced tax rate."
Exxon,2017-5,"The lobbyists are making an aggressive case that cutting the tax rate on offshore profits to 10 percent from 35 percent, as the administration has indicated it may favor, is not enough."
Exxon,2017-5,"Rather, the lobbyists said they want a lower, bifurcated rate of 3.5 percent on earnings already invested abroad in illiquid assets, such as factories, and 8.75 percent on cash and liquid assets."
Exxon,2017-5,"During the 2016 presidential campaign, Trump proposed setting the rate at 10 percent, and argued it could be used to raise tax revenue to pay for tax cuts or infrastructure."
Exxon,2017-5,"Discussion of hard numbers in the long-running repatriation debate may indicate tax reform is advancing on Trump's slow-moving domestic policy agenda. Or it may just be lobbyists trying to set the early framework for a long slog ahead, which could be adjusted if they get concessions elsewhere."
Exxon,2017-5,"""For us, it's how you create a tax environment where you give business long-term certainty,"" one lobbyist said."
Exxon,2017-5,"The changes being discussed are part of larger tax reform, another lobbyist said: ""Our international tax system is out of whack with the rest of the world. This system is not sustainable."""
Exxon,2017-5,"The lobbyists' demands represent the latest effort in a push by corporate America that has been under way since 2004-2005, the last time Washington let multinationals pay only a small fraction of the taxes due on their foreign profits."
Exxon,2017-5,"Repatriation and comprehensive tax reform are important to the economy, Apple Inc CEO Tim Cook said earlier this month on CNBC. ""The administration ... they're really getting this and want to bring this back and I hope that that comes to pass,"" he said. Apple held $239.6 billion of cash and securities offshore as of April 1."
Exxon,2017-5,"Under current law, U.S.-based corporations are supposed to pay 35-percent income tax on profits worldwide. But companies can defer that tax on active profits left outside the country."
Exxon,2017-5,"The deferral rule has incentivized multinationals to park profits offshore and about $2.6 trillion in earnings is being held overseas by more than 500 U.S. companies, according to Audit Analytics, a corporate research firm."
Exxon,2017-5,"Nearly a third of that is held by 10 companies, including Apple, Microsoft Corp , Pfizer Inc and General Electric Co , the firm said. All four of those companies declined to comment."
Exxon,2017-5,"These companies and hundreds of others could bring their foreign profits into the United States at any time, but they do not in order to avoid paying the 35-percent tax due."
Exxon,2017-5,"If the $2.6 trillion overseas were repatriated at once, two things would happen. First, Washington would get a big jolt of tax revenue. Second, repatriated profits not collected by the Internal Revenue Service could be put to use in the economy."
Exxon,2017-5,"As the law stands, tax-deferred profits can be held offshore indefinitely. The result of that has been companies biding their time, claiming their profits are ""trapped"" offshore while lobbying for a repatriation tax cut. The last time they got one was in 2004-2005 under former President George W. Bush, whose administration let multinationals voluntarily repatriate profits at a 5.25 percent tax rate."
Exxon,2017-5,"At the time, Bush tried to extract promises from companies that they would dedicate repatriated funds to investments in new plants and other job-creating projects."
Exxon,2017-5,"But in a 2011 follow-up study, a Senate committee concluded the Bush repatriation tax ""holiday"" cost the Treasury at least $3.3 billion in net revenue over 10 years and ""produced no appreciable increase in U.S. jobs or domestic investment."""
Exxon,2017-5,"Rather, the repatriated funds largely went to shareholder dividends and executive bonuses, the committee said."
Exxon,2017-5,"The repatriation tax break now being discussed differs from Bush's: repatriation would not be voluntary, but mandatory, so foreign profits would have to be brought home."
Exxon,2017-5,"In addition, lobbyists said they have talked to the administration about ending deferral and exempting foreign profits from taxation. The administration has floated this as an option. Lobbyists said there has been discussion about limiting that exemption to 95 percent of repatriated foreign earnings."

Exxon,2017-5,"BOSTON, May 12 (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc said on Friday that it voted in favor of a successful shareholder proposal calling for more climate change reporting by Occidental Petroleum Corp , in the first sign the world's largest asset manager was backing up its tough new talk on environmental matters."
Exxon,2017-5,"Backers of the resolution called its passage a major victory, the first time such a measure succeeded at a major U.S. oil and gas company. Proponents said they were pleased by BlackRock's support, which they had sought."
Exxon,2017-5,"BlackRock , which has $5.4 trillion under management, traditionally has given few details of its reasoning behind specific proxy votes. On Friday, however, it said it was concerned about Occidental's pace of disclosure to date. It also gave details about its talks with other companies such as Chevron Corp , which BlackRock said has provided more detail on climate risks it faces such as a recent report it published."
Exxon,2017-5,"A Chevron representative said the company would continue speaking with investors, and that it had held ""extensive dialogue with proponents and other stockholders."""
Exxon,2017-5,BlackRock spokesman Ed Sweeney said BlackRock would not explain every vote it casts in such detail but wanted to underscore how it promotes its corporate governance priorities in talks with companies.
Exxon,2017-5,"""We want to highlight our engagement and articulate our voting decisions,"" he said."
Exxon,2017-5,"Occidental Chairman Eugene Batchelder said in an emailed statement: ""We look forward to continuing our shareholder engagement on the topic and providing additional disclosure about the company's assessment and management of climate-related risks and opportunities."""
Exxon,2017-5,"Major oil companies have long faced shareholder criticism for being slow to respond to climate concerns, though some have moved to mend fences with activists in recent years such as ExxonMobil's decision earlier this year to name a environmental expert to its board."
Exxon,2017-5,"Specifically, the resolution at Occidental - which was also backed by Wespath Investment Management and state pension funds including the California Public Employees' Retirement System - called on the energy company to explain the impact it could face from changes like new public policies on climate change, such as the 2016 Paris climate agreement."
Exxon,2017-5,"BlackRock, Occidental's largest investor with about 8 percent of its shares, last year had opposed a similar resolution, which failed to get a majority of support from investors."
Exxon,2017-5,"In a statement sent by Sweeney explaining the switch, the fund firm said its vote last year was meant to give Occidental time. But despite talks with Occidental, ""we remain concerned about the lack of discernable improvements to the company's reporting practices"" on climate issues, the statement said."
Exxon,2017-5,Last year a similar resolution was narrowly defeated with 249 million votes cast for it and 259 million votes cast against. The size of BlackRock's holdings suggested its switch helped give the proposal a majority of support this year. An Occidental spokesman said the company would provide details about the vote in coming days.

Exxon,2017-5,"Under the plan, which falls under the framework of the U.S.-China Comprehensive Economic Dialogue, Chinese companies can now negotiate long-term contracts to source LNG from U.S. suppliers, the U.S. Commerce Department said."
Exxon,2017-5,"""We are happy for all support in moving forward with U.S. LNG exports...We view this announcement as a step forward in improving the balance of trade,"" said Joi Lecznar, a spokeswoman for Tellurian, which is developing the $13-$16 billion Driftwood LNG export facility in Louisiana, expected to enter service in 2022."
Exxon,2017-5,"Until now, Chinese buyers have not bought long-term LNG supplies from the U.S. directly."
Exxon,2017-5,"China, however, has bought U.S. LNG through short-term, or spot, deals. The only long-term contracts it has for U.S. LNG are with companies, like Royal Dutch Shell PLC , which themselves have agreements to buy gas from Cheniere's Sabine Pass or other U.S. export terminals."
Exxon,2017-5,"Sabine Pass in Louisiana entered service in February 2016, making it the first and only big LNG export facility in the lower 48 U.S. states. The United States has been a net importer of natural gas for 60 years; that is expected to change in 2017 as a result of LNG exports."
Exxon,2017-5,"China was the third biggest importer of U.S. LNG in 2016, having imported 17.2 billion cubic feet (bcf) on six vessels, according to federal energy data. For the first two months of 2017, China imported 30.9 bcf of gas on 10 tankers."
Exxon,2017-5,One billion cubic feet is enough gas for about five million U.S. homes.
Exxon,2017-5,"By 2030, Wood Mackenzie projects Chinese LNG demand will reach 75 million tonnes per annum or 10 bcfd. That would be worth $26 billion a year at current prices ($7 per million British thermal units)."
Exxon,2017-5,"""The U.S. is keen for a slice of the pie,"" Di-Odoardo said, noting that U.S. LNG accounted for about 7 percent of total LNG imports into China in March."

Exxon,2017-5,"OIAPOQUE, Brazil, May 12 - Deep beneath the waters of the Atlantic off Brazil's most northern coast, French major Total SA is hunting for what it hopes will be Latin America's next big oil discovery."
Exxon,2017-5,"Some geologists say the area, known as the Foz do Amazonas Basin, may contain as many as 14 billion barrels of petroleum, more than the entire proven reserves of Mexico."
Exxon,2017-5,"But another underwater discovery threatens to derail Total's plans: a massive system of coral reefs just 28 kilometers from where the French firm and its partners, Britain's BP PLC and Brazilian state oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA, plan to drill."
Exxon,2017-5,"Brazilian scientists had suspected since the 1970s that the area might be home to a sizeable reef. But the unusual depth of this formation - reaching more than 100 meters (400 ft) - coupled with the Amazon silt clouding the waters, delayed that confirmation until just five years ago, just as the government was putting drilling leases out for tender."
Exxon,2017-5,"Environmentalists, led by campaigner Greenpeace, are now pressuring regulators to block oil exploration in the area. They believe the thriving reef system, which is more 1,000 kilometers long and dotted with brightly colored coral and giant sponges, may be home to new marine species."
Exxon,2017-5,Total says it is scrupulously complying with all requirements by Brazilian authorities and is taking every precaution to ensure that drilling would be safe.
Exxon,2017-5,The dispute highlights pressures facing Brazil to protect its unique environmental patrimony as its tries to foment jobs and economic growth for its citizens.
Exxon,2017-5,"It is also reviving concerns that Brazil, which ranks among the Western hemisphere's least open economies, remains a difficult place to do business despite a new conservative government's efforts to cut red tape and woo foreign investment as it seeks to drag the economy out of the worst downturn since the Great Depression."
Exxon,2017-5,"Four years after Total and its partners paid 622 million reais ($196 million) for five exploration blocks, they are still waiting for the go-ahead from Brazil's environmental regulator, Ibama."
Exxon,2017-5,The agency has given no indication as to when it will make a ruling.
Exxon,2017-5,"""It's an area that is very sensitive. We're concerned about everything there,"" said Alexandre Souza, environmental analyst for Ibama."
Exxon,2017-5,"The delay has Total's Chief Executive in Brazil, Maxime Rabilloud, suggesting the company might sit out three offshore oil license rounds that Brazil has scheduled for this year."
Exxon,2017-5,"He said Total had already invested some 200 million reais ($64 million) in developing its fields in Foz do Amazonas, with no guarantee yet that it will be able to proceed."
Exxon,2017-5,"""It's complicated to ask for more money to enter into more exploration blocks without clarity about when the earlier blocks can be evaluated to see if they have any oil,"" he said in his office in Rio de Janeiro in March."

Exxon,2017-5,"Total, which said it hopes to receive a decision from Ibama this year, plans to drill nine exploratory wells at water depths of more than 1,900 meters."
Exxon,2017-5,"Environmentalists say such extreme depths bring greater risks, making it harder to plug and contain any spill. BP's 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill, the worst in U.S. waters, was from a deep-water well of similar depth."
Exxon,2017-5,"In a 64-page document submitted to Ibama, reviewed by Reuters, Total said the environmental risks were fully understood."
Exxon,2017-5,"""We are very aware of the sensitivity of the ecosystems,"" Rabilloud said. He said the company was using a well design that has been used in similar conditions in French Guiana without any incidents."

Exxon,2017-5,"{{20170512T034501.612+0000}}ANALYSIS-China, India plans for electric cars threaten to cut gasoline demand* China and India prepare for radical policy shifts"
Exxon,2017-5,"SINGAPORE/KUALA LUMPUR, May 12 (Reuters) - Demand for gasoline in Asia may peak much earlier than expected as millions of people in China and India buy electric vehicles over the next decade, threatening wrenching change for the oil industry, oil and auto company executives warned."
Exxon,2017-5,"They said refiners should prepare for a future in which gasoline, their biggest source of revenue, will be much less of a cash cow."
Exxon,2017-5,"Change is being prompted by policy moves in India and China, where governments are trying to rein in rampant pollution, cut oil imports, and compete for a slice of the fast-growing green car market."
Exxon,2017-5,"In its ""road map"", released in April, China said it wants alternative fuel vehicles to account for at least one-fifth of the 35 million annual vehicle sales projected by 2025. [nL4N1HX1HS]"
Exxon,2017-5,"India is considering even more radical action, with an influential government think-tank drafting plans in support of electrifying all vehicles in the country by 2032, according to government and industry sources interviewed by Reuters late last week. [nL4N1I8080]"
Exxon,2017-5,"""We will see a clear shift to electric cars. It's driven by legislation so electric cars are coming, it's not a niche anymore,"" Wilco Stark, vice president for strategy and product planning at German car maker Daimler , told Reuters."
Exxon,2017-5,Stark and other executives were interviewed during the Asia Oil & Gas Conference in Kuala Lumpur this week.
Exxon,2017-5,"Daimler sees electric vehicles contributing 15-20 percent of its overall sales by 2025 and at least an additional 10 percent of sales coming from hybrids, he said."
Exxon,2017-5,"Electric cars currently make up less than 2 percent of the global car fleet, and any faster-than-expected growth in that percentage will materially impact oil demand and the refining business."
Exxon,2017-5,"""Technology is moving fast. In 10-15 years... our gasoline market might not be the same as it is today,"" said Dawood Nassif, board director at the state-owned oil company Bahrain Petroleum Company (BAPCO)."
Exxon,2017-5,"With gasoline responsible for up to 45 percent of refinery output, and one of the highest profit-margin fuels, a slowdown or fall in demand will have far reaching implications."
Exxon,2017-5,"Credit agency Moody's says that the fast pace of technological development makes accurate predictions difficult, but warned that direct financial effects from falling oil demand, including gasoline, ""could be material by the 2020s."" [nL8N1HZ24U]"
Exxon,2017-5,The changes are so big that the influential International Energy Agency (IEA) plans to revisit its analysis of electric vehicle trends and oil demand.
Exxon,2017-5,"""The choices made by China and India are obviously most relevant for the possible future peak in passenger car oil demand,"" an IEA spokesman told Reuters."
Exxon,2017-5,"In its current policies scenario, last updated in November 2016, the IEA still expects oil demand from vehicle use to rise until 2040. [nL8N1DH3M6]"
Exxon,2017-5,It's not just China and India that are changing fast.
Exxon,2017-5,"Asia's major car makers, Japan and South Korea, already sell significant volumes of hybrid vehicles - which operate off gasoline and electricity - while fuel efficiency gains will continue to cut gasoline consumption for standard vehicles. [nL3N1H71GT]"
Exxon,2017-5,"There will, though, be some major hurdles before a country like India goes mostly electric. High battery costs would push up car prices and a lack of charging stations and other infrastructure in India means car makers may hesitate to make the necessary investment in the technology."
Exxon,2017-5,Asia has long been the main driver of future oil demand thanks to supercharged growth in sales of autos.
Exxon,2017-5,"China sells more than 2 million new cars a month and is challenging the United States as the world's biggest oil consumer. India now is the world's third-biggest oil importer, ahead of Japan."
Exxon,2017-5,"More than a third of the world's refineries are in Asia, up from just 18 percent in 1990."
Exxon,2017-5,"For refiners, the growth of vehicles that run on electricity and other alternative fuels is a wake-up call. They can tweak the products they make from crude oil to an extent, but still mostly rely on gasoline consumption for revenue."
Exxon,2017-5,"""Rising pressure on margins and cash flows will potentially lead to stranded assets,"" Moody's warned, using a term for assets that no longer provide an economic return because of changes in the market or regulatory environment."
Exxon,2017-5,"Royal Dutch Shell said this week that it ""is looking into ... the potential to introduce electric vehicle charging points at our retail sites in several countries."""
Exxon,2017-5,Oil executives say it is still premature to expect overall oil demand to fall soon.
Exxon,2017-5,"""Our industry will not disappear,"" said Abdulaziz al Judaimi, senior vice president for downstream at Saudi Aramco, the world's biggest oil export company."
Exxon,2017-5,"They are envisaging a shift towards producing more petrochemicals like plastics or household chemicals, areas where consumption is soaring. [nL4N1DG248]"

Exxon,2017-5,Exxon Mobil this week said it would buy a petrochemical plant in Singapore. [nL4N1ID1R0]
Exxon,2017-5,Refiners also still see strong oil demand from heavy industry.
Exxon,2017-5,"""Refiners may shift their focus from gasoline to middle distillates,"" said KY Lin of Taiwan's Formosa Petrochemical <6505.TW>, a major Asian refiner. ""Gasoil is used widely, including in farming/industrial equipment... and also as a marine fuel."""

Exxon,2017-5,"The work on the 110,000 bpd PSLA-9 CDU could finish as early as May 14. Exxon is also overhauling the 32,000 bpd West Coker, which is expected to remain shut until the work finishes in late May, the sources said."
Exxon,2017-5,"A company spokeswoman declined to discuss operations at the Baton Rouge refinery, but said Exxon continues to meet its contractual obligations."
Exxon,2017-5,PSLA-9 is the second-largest of the four CDUs at the Baton Rouge refinery. The other three crude units remain in operation.
Exxon,2017-5,"CDUs do the primary refining of oil coming into a refinery, breaking down the crude into feed for all other units."

Exxon,2017-5,"MILAN, May 5 (Reuters) - Total and energy group Erg have received four bids for the Italian petrol station network they jointly own, three sources close to the matter said."
Exxon,2017-5,"The bidders, which include Italian refiner API Anonima Petroli [APIHDA.UL], have asked for additional information, two of the sources said, adding that details on how the sale will be structured would likely be announced by the end of May."
Exxon,2017-5,"France's Total and Italy's Erg jointly control TotalErg which operates close to 2,600 service stations in Italy with a market share of around 11 percent."
Exxon,2017-5,"But the joint venture also holds other assets including a quarter of Italian refinery Sarpom, controlled by ExxonMobil's Esso unit, which is proving a stumbling block."
Exxon,2017-5,"""The sale has not been wrapped up yet because the bidders have asked more questions,"" one of the sources said, adding it was not clear if the assets would be sold as a single block or would be broken up."
Exxon,2017-5,"TotalErg, 51 percent owned by Erg, has appointed HSBC and Rothschild to sell a business which sources have said could be worth more than 600 million euros ($657 million)."
Exxon,2017-5,A person close to the deal said that in addition to API the bidders included a foreign industrial player and private equity firms.
Exxon,2017-5,"Italian financial daily Il Sole 24 Ore reported this week that Terra Firma, TRC Capital, and Glencore had made bids."

Exxon,2017-5,"NEW YORK/MEXICO CITY, May 5 (Reuters) - Sweeping energy reforms have turned Mexico into one of the world's most attractive offshore prospects, but one segment is getting no love from U.S. investors: the nation's aging refineries."
Exxon,2017-5,"Efforts by Mexico's state-owned oil company Pemex to attract about $5 billion in capital to help modernize its two largest refineries so far have proved futile, according to two people familiar with the process who declined to be named because they were not authorized to speak publicly."
Exxon,2017-5,The company is seeking a joint venture partner for its Salina Cruz refinery on the West Coast. It's also looking for an investor to complete construction of a coking unit to process heavy crude at its Tula refinery just north of Mexico's capital.
Exxon,2017-5,"Among those to rebuff overtures from Pemex over the past year are U.S. refining giants Valero Energy Corp and Tesoro Corp , the people said."
Exxon,2017-5,"Valero and Tesoro declined to comment. Those and other companies were deterred by operational, political and market concerns, the people said."
Exxon,2017-5,"Pemex officials said they ""categorically reject"" the notion that they are struggling to find investors."
Exxon,2017-5,"""There has been interest,"" a company spokesman said Thursday. ""We've had talks with many companies whose names we can't reveal."""
Exxon,2017-5,"Pemex has said publicly it's seeking investment from Korean, Japanese and Chinese firms. The company hired Bank of America last year to seek potential partners."
Exxon,2017-5,"The refining sector has contributed buckets of red ink to Pemex's bottom line. Its six domestic refineries have accumulated annual operating losses of about $5 billion in recent years. Government-set fuel prices, a spate of accidents and other non-scheduled stoppages have cut deeply into margins."
Exxon,2017-5,"For years, Pemex prioritized investment in profitable drilling projects, neglecting other areas. As a result, refineries built decades ago to process light, sweet crude from Mexico's shallower waters can't efficiently process heavy oil from fields currently in production."
Exxon,2017-5,"The upshot: Today Mexico imports more than 60 percent of its refined gasoline and diesel from the United States, while its own refineries operate at about half capacity."
Exxon,2017-5,The mismatch would seem a prime business opportunity. Instead Pemex's refineries have become a virtual third rail for investors.
Exxon,2017-5,"Some potential partners are leery of the sums needed to bring the aging facilities up to standard, people familiar with the situation said. Then there's the bloated refinery workforce whose jobs are protected by a strong union. On average, Pemex uses about 3,000 full-time workers to operate each refinery. That's triple the number found at U.S. facilities with similar sized operations, according to figures from Pemex and U.S. refiners."
Exxon,2017-5,"""The refineries aren't competitive. Their product slate doesn't meet the demand of the country,"" said Dave Hackett, an energy consultant at Stillwater Associates in California."
Exxon,2017-5,"Pemex's refineries could be the biggest challenge yet for Jose Antonio Gonzalez Anaya, who was brought in as chief executive last year to lure investment to Mexico's most important company. The oil giant has struggled in recent years with slumping production, falling oil prices and rising debt."
Exxon,2017-5,"Gonzalez Anaya, a polished, American-educated technocrat, has scored some early wins. He oversaw cost cuts of more $5 billion last year and has hustled to attract exploration and production partnerships; the first one covering a deep water Gulf block was inked in February between Pemex, U.S. oil major Chevron and Japan's Inpex <1605.T>."
Exxon,2017-5,"On Wednesday, Pemex reported its first quarterly profit in five years, gaining some $4.7 billion during the January-March period."
Exxon,2017-5,"Overall, the outlook is bullish for Mexico's oil industry. Reforms to Mexico's constitution four years ago ended Pemex's nearly 80-year monopoly and allowed the government-controlled company to form its first-ever equity partnerships. The changes also permitted private oil companies to operate fields on their own. Major oil companies including Exxon Mobil Corp , Total SA and Statoil have snagged offshore leases at auction."
Exxon,2017-5,"Overhauling Mexico's refining sector, however, has proven daunting. Unlike offshore production, where new rigs can be brought in and operators can largely call their own shots, the refineries come with baggage. Potential investors must contend with the existing infrastructure, much of it dating back to the 1970s. Then there are entrenched relationships with local government officials and union leaders."
Exxon,2017-5,"Lowering a massive coking drum into place during an event at the Tula facility last month, Pemex chief Gonzalez Anaya was accompanied, not by foreign investors, but by Carlos Romero Deschamps, head of the powerful oil workers union and a senator with the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, of President Enrique Pena Nieto."
Exxon,2017-5,"If refinery investors ""are forced to follow exactly how Pemex has worked in the past, obviously no one will enter,"" said Carlos Petersen, an analyst covering Latin America for Eurasia Group."
Exxon,2017-5,"Mexico's political climate is another concern. By law, Pena Nieto, who led the oil reform, is limited to a single six-year term that ends next year. The government's decision to open its oil industry to outside producers and sell off some Pemex assets was vehemently opposed by many Mexicans and left-leaning politicians. Among them is Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, a populist who's the current front-runner for the 2018 presidential race."
Exxon,2017-5,"In the meantime, Pemex is moving forward - alone - to finance some of its refining needs. Badly in need of more capacity to process heavy crude, Pemex broke ground in 2013 on the coker project at its Tula refinery."
Exxon,2017-5,"The company will fund half the $2.2-billion cost for the first phase while it seeks partners to help complete the facility, Pemex's top downstream executive Carlos Murrieta told analysts on a conference call earlier this week. He put the final price tag at $4.5 billion and projected the plant would be ready in 2022."
Exxon,2017-5,Houston oil analyst Jake Fuller is dubious that other new Pemex refinery projects will follow anytime soon.

Exxon,2017-5,"{{20170503T194049.240+0000}}FACTBOX-U.S. Chemical Safety Board conclusions in Torrance blast probeMay 3 (Reuters) - The U.S. Chemical Safety Board has wrapped up a two-year investigation of a Feb. 18, 2015, explosion at a Torrance, California, refinery then owned by Exxon Mobil Corp . It found that weaknesses in Exxon Mobil's process safety management program led to the explosion, which caused minor injuries to four workers and spiked West Coast gasoline prices. [nL1N1I425P]"
Exxon,2017-5,"The blast occurred when volatile hydrocarbons flowed backwards in an idled gasoline-producing fluidic catalytic cracking unit (FCCU) to the electrostatic precipitator, which releases sparks as it collects catalyst particles from escaping through the unit's exhaust stack."
Exxon,2017-5,"""These weaknesses led to operation of the FCC unit without pre-established safe operating limits and criteria for unit shutdown, reliance on safeguards that could not be verified, the degradation of a safety-critical safeguard, and the re-use of a previous procedure deviation without a sufficient hazard analysis that confirmed that the assumed process conditions were still valid,"" the CSB said in its report."
Exxon,2017-5,"The board also found debris from the ESP nearly struck alkylation unit settler tanks containing toxic hydrofluoric acid, which can be deadly at 30 parts per million. The CSB has asked a federal court to enforce subpoenas against Exxon so the board can read information the company withheld about steps taken to prevent hydrofluoric acid releases or to mitigate them."
Exxon,2017-5,FCCU: A fluidic catalytic cracking unit converts gas oil to gasoline and diesel using a catalyst under high heat and pressure.
Exxon,2017-5,Alkylation unit: An alkylation unit uses an acid catalyst to convert low-octane refining byproducts into high-octane components used in gasoline. Hydrofluoric acid is the most commonly used acid in U.S. refinery alkylation units.
Exxon,2017-5,ESP: An electrostatic precipitator uses electricity to collect catalyst from the exhaust stack of FCCUs in compliance with environmental rules.
Exxon,2017-5,"""Exxon Mobil deeply regrets the Feb. 18, 2015 incident at the Torrance refinery. We are thankful that no one was seriously hurt and wish to express our appreciation to city officials and community partners, the Torrance Fire Department and the Torrance Police Department for their dedication in ensuring the safety of the community."
Exxon,2017-5,"""We are confident that we understand the cause of the Feb. 18 incident and have worked cooperatively with the Chemical Safety Board and staff to fully understand their findings and recommendations to improve the safety of our operations."
Exxon,2017-5,"""During the course of the investigation, there was no evidence the Feb. 18 incident posed any risk to the modified hydrofluoric acid alkylation unit or risk of harm to the community. There was no loss of containment in the alkylation unit, it was neither associated with nor damaged in the Feb. 18 incident, and all safety systems and procedures operated as designed."
Exxon,2017-5,"""In terms of safety, Exxon Mobil meets or exceeds accepted industry practices (API 751) and has stringent safety measures in place to mitigate risks associated with the modified hydrofluoric acid alkylation process. We employ multiple industry leading systems designed to detect a release of modified hydrofluoric acid and effectively mitigate and contain such a release, should one occur."""
Exxon,2017-5,OPPOSITION California residents have pushed local and state leaders to ban the use of hydrofluoric acid in the state's refineries.
Exxon,2017-5,"The U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board is tasked with finding the root causes of chemical plant fires and explosions. It has no regulatory or enforcement authority and only issues reports on the results of its investigations, which include recommendations to companies, regulators and industry associations."

Exxon,2017-5,"HOUSTON, May 3 (Reuters) - The U.S. Chemical Safety Board (CSB) has concluded that a 2015 explosion at a Torrance, California, refinery then owned by Exxon Mobil Corp could have been prevented, the agency concluded in a report issued on Wednesday."
Exxon,2017-5,"""This explosion and near miss should not have happened,"" said CSB Chair Vanessa Allen Sutherland in a statement. ""The CSB's report concludes the unit was operating without proper procedures."""
Exxon,2017-5,The federal watchdog found that weaknesses in the Torrance refinery's safety program led to the blast. [nL1N1I507I]
Exxon,2017-5,"The blast blew a large piece of debris 80 feet (24.38 m) to nearby alkylation unit settler tanks containing toxic hydrofluoric acid, which the board called a ""near-miss event."""
Exxon,2017-5,"Four workers suffered minor injuries and part of the refinery underwent a lengthy shutdown, contributing to a spike in the state's gasoline prices."
Exxon,2017-5,The Torrance refinery supplies 20 percent of the gasoline in Southern California and 10 percent statewide.
Exxon,2017-5,"The explosion occurred when volatile hydrocarbons flowed backward through an idled gasoline-producing fluidic catalytic cracking unit (FCCU) to a pollution control device called an electrostatic precipitator (ESP), the CSB found."
Exxon,2017-5,The generation of sparks by the ESP ignited the hydrocarbons setting off the explosion.
Exxon,2017-5,"The board, which has no regulatory authority and does not assess fines, found that the FCCU was operating without pre-established limits for a shutdown."
Exxon,2017-5,The agency also said Exxon relied on safeguards that it could not be sure were working and that a critical safeguard failed.
Exxon,2017-5,"Exxon said in a statement: ""We are confident we understand the cause of the blast and have worked cooperatively with the Chemical Safety Board and staff to fully understand their findings and recommendations."""
Exxon,2017-5,"Regarding the hydrofluoric acid, Exxon said, ""There was no evidence the Feb. 18 incident posed any risk to the modified hydrofluoric acid alkylation unit or risk of harm to the community."""
Exxon,2017-5,Residents near the refinery want local and state officials to ban the use of hydrofluoric acid in making octane-boosting gasoline additives.
Exxon,2017-5,Hydrofluoric acid is a highly toxic chemical that can kill or seriously injure at a concentration of 30 parts per million. As a gas it forms a ground-hugging cloud.
Exxon,2017-5,The board said it has asked a federal court to enforce subpoenas requiring Exxon to provide information about safeguards to prevent or mitigate a release of hydrofluoric acid.
Exxon,2017-5,"Exxon said it ""strongly disagrees"" with any statement questioning its responsiveness or cooperation with the investigation."
Exxon,2017-5,"""We offered to make additional documents available if the CSB could provide a sufficient basis for the documents and agreed to respect commercial confidentiality, which they have not done,"" a spokesman said Wednesday."
Exxon,2017-5,"PBF Energy Inc , which acquired the refinery last year, ""has already implemented a number of measures that address the CSB's recommendations,"" PBF spokesman Michael Karlovich said in a statement. ""We plan to complete two studies later this year that will address the remaining recommendations."""
Exxon,2017-5,"The CSB determines root causes of chemical plant accidents and provides recommendations to companies, industry organizations and regulatory agencies."

Exxon,2017-5,"NORFOLK, Va., May 3 (Reuters) - Climate change poses a global security threat that all countries must fight together, a NATO general said on Wednesday, as U.S. President Donald Trump nears a decision on whether to pull out of the Paris climate deal."
Exxon,2017-5,"The comments were the strongest yet from the U.S.-European military alliance about the importance of upholding the Paris accord. They come amid lingering tensions between the leadership of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and Trump, who at one point called NATO ""obsolete""."
Exxon,2017-5,"""There is a huge necessity that the U.N. continues to involve all nations and coordinate the action of all nations,"" to fight climate change, General Denis Mercier, NATO's supreme allied commander for transformation, told Reuters on the sidelines of a conference in Norfolk, Virginia."
Exxon,2017-5,"""If one nation, especially the biggest nation ... if they do not recognize a problem, then we will have trouble dealing with the causes,"" of climate change, said Mercier."
Exxon,2017-5,"Though he did not single out any country by name, the United States is the world's biggest economy and the second largest emitter of greenhouse gases after China."
Exxon,2017-5,"Trump, a Republican, is weighing whether the United States should stay in the Paris climate agreement, a deal struck by nearly 200 countries in 2015 to limit global warming by reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and to provide funds to poor countries dealing with the effects of climate change. [L8N1I56C4]"
Exxon,2017-5,"Trump has complained that the United States was treated unfairly in the agreement because it would pay more than other countries to fight global warming. He is expected to decide in the next week or two on whether the country will leave the pact, or stay in with reduced commitments. [nW1N1GA00N]"
Exxon,2017-5,"His Democratic predecessor, former President Barack Obama, had pledged a 26 percent to 28 percent cut in U.S. greenhouse gas emissions from 2005 levels, by 2025."
Exxon,2017-5,"NATO's duty when it comes to climate change is to try to predict its impacts on geopolitical stability, said Mercier, who is French. He said risks include rising seas, water scarcity and the opening of access to resources in the Arctic - all of which he said are likely to bring about new conflicts that could involve the 28 NATO countries."
Exxon,2017-5,"A global effort to stem climate change could help the world avoid some of these crises and conflicts, he said."
Exxon,2017-5,"""It's not too late, but it is time,"" he added."
Exxon,2017-5,"Norfolk, home to the world's largest naval base, already faces severe risks from rising sea levels. The main road to U.S. Naval Station Norfolk has experienced chronic flooding, and electric and water utilities supporting the base are threatened every time the waters rise."
Exxon,2017-5,"""In some circles many public policy makers do not want to use (the words) global warming or climate change, but the reality is we are experiencing it, Norfolk Mayor Kenneth Alexander told reporters on the sidelines of the conference."
Exxon,2017-5,"U.S. greenhouse gas emissions have fallen recently due to a switch from coal to natural gas and renewables in generating electricity. But many climate experts fear that if Washington leaves the Paris accord, or adjusts down its commitments, other countries could follow suit and global emissions could surge."
Exxon,2017-5,"Many companies including ExxonMobil Corp , Microsoft Corp , and Arch Coal Inc , have urged the United States to stay in the Paris agreement, in part to retain their global competitiveness."
