Exxon,2017-10,{{20171101T064826.194+0000}}UPDATE 2-Australia's Oil Search buys into promising Alaska oil find* Spain's Repsol sees field holding 1.2 bln barrels of oil
Exxon,2017-10,"MELBOURNE, Nov 1 (Reuters) - Australia's Oil Search Ltd has agreed to buy stakes in a huge oil find in Alaska for $400 million, in a surprise push to diversify from its sweet spot of gas in Papua New Guinea."
Exxon,2017-10,"Oil Search will pick up stakes in three oil blocks from privately owned U.S. firms Armstrong Energy and GMT Exploration giving it a roughly 26 percent holding in the Nanushuk play, co-owned by Spain's Repsol SA ."
Exxon,2017-10,"The play includes the Horseshoe block, which hit oil in March in what Repsol called the biggest U.S. onshore find in 30 years. It estimated the field could hold 1.2 billion barrels. [nFWN1GM0QP]"
Exxon,2017-10,"Oil Search bought in assuming the field holds 500 million barrels, expecting production to begin in 2023, with output to plateau at 80,000 to 120,000 barrels per day."
Exxon,2017-10,"""With the quality of the assets, the fact that they're tier 1, and the fact that we've gone in very conservatively against what Repsol are saying, I think we can demonstrate to the market that this will be a super deal for Oil Search in the medium term,"" Oil Search Chief Executive Peter Botten told Reuters."
Exxon,2017-10,"Investors were nervous about the $8 billion company's move into a region where it has no experience and which is dominated by giants like BP and ExxonMobil Corp , sending its shares down 3 percent, especially after it gave up on a push into Kurdistan."
Exxon,2017-10,Other Australian oil and gas producers rose more than 1 percent on Wednesday.
Exxon,2017-10,"""Questions will inevitably be asked about Oil Search's competitive advantage to play in Alaska until it proves its operational capability there,"" said Saul Kavonic, an analyst with energy consultants Wood Mackenzie."
Exxon,2017-10,"RBC analyst Ben Wilson said the move was well-timed near the bottom of the oil price cycle and with some of the appraisal work on the field already done. He said it had ""good prospects"" as the oil was high-grade."
Exxon,2017-10,"Botten began working on the deal eight months ago when oil prices were about 20 percent lower than now and said Oil Search managed to get the asset despite higher-priced interest from others in nearby fields, whom he declined to name."
Exxon,2017-10,"The owners of the neighbouring fields are ConocoPhillips , ExxonMobil and Italy's ENI ."
Exxon,2017-10,Oil Search has the option of doubling its stake in the Alaskan assets for a further $450 million. It plans to fund the deal from its cash reserves.
Exxon,2017-10,Oil Search will work with oilfield services giant Halliburton Co and Armstrong before taking over as operator of the assets in June 2018.

Exxon,2017-10,"ATHENS, Oct 31 (Reuters) - A consortium led by France's Total moved a step closer to exploring for oil and gas off Greece after signing a lease on Tuesday with the government for a block in the Ionian Sea."
Exxon,2017-10,Greece wants to tap into its limited oil reserves to reduce dependence on oil imports and boost public finances.
Exxon,2017-10,"It awarded the contract to the Total consortium, which also includes Greece's biggest oil refiner Hellenic Petroleum and Italy's Edison , in October 2016."
Exxon,2017-10,"""Undoubtedly it is a vote of confidence in the Greek economy,"" Energy Minister George Stathakis said of the agreement on Tuesday."
Exxon,2017-10,"Total will operate the block with a 50 percent stake, while Edison and Hellenic Petroleum will each hold 25 percent. The agreement must be ratified by Greece's parliament before exploration work can begin."
Exxon,2017-10,"Western Greece is a frontier, underexplored area and very little data exists on its hydrocarbon potential."
Exxon,2017-10,"Bernard Clement, a senior Total executive for the Caspian and Southern Europe, said it would maintain ""realistic expectations"" before obtaining data."
Exxon,2017-10,Total has shown interest in the eastern Mediterranean following major gas discoveries off Israel and Egypt. It is currently drilling for oil off Cyprus.
Exxon,2017-10,"Together with Hellenic Petroleum in a consortium led by U.S. oil major Exxon Mobil , Total has also expressed interest in exploration at two sites off Crete, prompting Greece to launch a tender."
Exxon,2017-10,"Greece, like other European countries, relies on Russian gas imports which account for over 60 percent of supplies. Russia covers about a third of Greece's oil needs."
Exxon,2017-10,Athens also wants to attract investment into the oil industry as it tries to emerge from years of economic crisis.
Exxon,2017-10,"During a meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump this month, Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras said Athens wanted U.S. investment in energy too, and it planned to set up a taskforce to overcome red tape."
Exxon,2017-10,"""It helps a lot to keep the bureaucracy moving if you have a clear message from the top that the answer to investors should be 'Yes',"" U.S. ambassador to Greece, Geoffrey Pyatt, told Reuters."
Exxon,2017-10,"Greece has one LNG terminal off Athens, where it imports Algerian gas, but an official at state-run gas firm DEPA said it plans to invite U.S. companies to ship LNG there for the first time."
Exxon,2017-10,"It is also developing a floating storage and regasification unit (FSRU) off Alexandroupolis, a city close to the Turkish and Bulgarian borders near where EU-backed pipelines are being built to cut reliance on Russian gas."
Exxon,2017-10,"""Our vision for Greece (is) as a European energy hub,"" said Pyatt, a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine."
Exxon,2017-10,"The FSRU, with an estimated annual capacity of 6.1 billion cubic metres, will seek to supply gas to southeastern Europe via the Interconnector Greece-Bulgaria (IGB) pipeline, which is due to begin construction next year."
Exxon,2017-10,"The IGB and the FSRU could be connected to the Trans-Adriatic Pipeline which is being built to carry Caspian gas to European markets, which currently depends on Russian oil giant Gazprom for a third of its supply."

Exxon,2017-10,"OSLO, Oct 31 (Reuters) - The world's 250 biggest listed companies account for a third of all man-made greenhouse gas emissions yet few have strong goals to limit rising temperatures, a study showed on Tuesday."
Exxon,2017-10,"Coal India , Gazprom and Exxon Mobil topped the list when measuring carbon dioxide emitted by companies and by consumers using their products, it said."
Exxon,2017-10,"""Without continual reduction in emissions from this group of companies, effectively mitigating the long-term risks of climate change is not possible,"" according to the study, a Thomson Reuters Financial & Risk white paper."
Exxon,2017-10,"In the past three years, emissions from the group of 250 had been flat ""when they should have been going down by roughly three percent per year"" to limit temperatures in line with goals set by the 2015 Paris climate agreement, it said."
Exxon,2017-10,"The report, written in collaboration with Constellation Research & Technology, emissions tracking group CDP and BSD Consulting, found the group emitted a third of world carbon emissions and that only about 30 percent of the 250 firms had set strong goals to curb them."
Exxon,2017-10,"Under the 2015 Paris Agreement, almost 200 nations promised to curb emissions to limit more heat waves, downpours and rising sea levels and said they would work to involve the private sector."
Exxon,2017-10,"U.S. President Donald Trump, who doubts human activities are the main driver of climate change, plans to pull out."
Exxon,2017-10,"David Lubin, a co-author of the report at Constellation Research & Technology, told Reuters: ""250 CEOs - that's a relatively small auditorium if you can bring together the leaders who really have a significant impact on the fate of the planet."""
Exxon,2017-10,"Tim Nixon, a co-author at Thomson Reuters, said the study found ""no evidence"" that companies adopting stronger policies to reduce their carbon emissions paid a penalty in terms of shareholder returns, profits or employment."
Exxon,2017-10,"And case studies of companies including Xcel Energy , Ingersoll Rand and Total , which have acted strongly to curb emissions, showed there may even be a significant benefit to action, he said."

Exxon,2017-10,"The ACG fields produce 585,000 barrels per day, accounting for three quarters of Azerbaijan's oil output, but production is expected to rise as the partners could invest up to $40 billion in the next 32 years."

Exxon,2017-10,"Differences among the six-member group behind the project in Port Qasim in Karachi mean French oil major Total and Japan's Mitsubishi may also quit and join a rival scheme, government officials and industry sources told Reuters."
Exxon,2017-10,"A senior Pakistani government official put the chances of success for the project, set to be Pakistan's third and biggest by import capacity, at 10-20 percent due to the disagreements."
Exxon,2017-10,"A highly-developed pipeline grid, extensive industrial demand and the biggest natural gas-powered vehicle fleet in Asia after China and Iran make Pakistan an easy fit for LNG and official estimates show imports could jump fivefold to 30 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) by 2022."

Exxon,2017-10,"Since 2014, Exxon has been paying royalties to the government in physical crude cargoes that were subsequently allocated by state firm SHT to Glencore."
Exxon,2017-10,"But this process will end in early January as the government has asked Exxon to pay royalties in cash instead, according to a letter from the company dating from mid-October."
Exxon,2017-10,"""In this context, we wish to levy in cash, and not in kind, the royalties due by the Consortium on January 2, 2018,"" the letter stated."
Exxon,2017-10,The change will see Exxon replace Glencore as the marketer of the royalty oil.
Exxon,2017-10,Spokesmen for ExxonMobil and Glencore declined to comment. Chad's finance ministry did not respond immediately to requests for comment.

Exxon,2017-10,"Chad previously had a grace period in 2016, after Brent oil futures hit their lowest level since the end of 2003."
Exxon,2017-10,"""Glencore does not want to hear about a restructuring,"" a government source said. ""This is why we have decided to take the marketing of our oil away from them."""

Exxon,2017-10,"BOSTON, Oct 27 (Reuters) - Activist Exxon Mobil Corp investors, five months after winning a landmark shareholder vote, are still pressing the company for an analysis on how its business could be affected by regulations aimed at limiting climate change."
Exxon,2017-10,"The two sides have held discussions, and talks are continuing ahead of a mid-December deadline to prepare proxy resolutions for next spring's shareholder meeting, activists said."
Exxon,2017-10,An Exxon spokesman said it was meeting with investors but declined to discuss specifics.

Exxon,2017-10,"Exxon faces several lawsuits, including from New York and Massachusetts state attorneys general, over the possibility it misled the public and investors about the risks of climate change. Exxon has denied the allegations and called them politically motivated."
Exxon,2017-10,"Calls for companies to disclose more about how they will fare in a warming world received higher-than-usual levels of support at shareholder meetings this past spring, sometimes with new backing from asset managers like BlackRock Inc and Vanguard Group."
Exxon,2017-10,"Occidental Petroleum Corp, said in a second quarter earnings presentation that it would provide additional disclosure of ""climate-related risks and opportunities"" after a majority of investors backed a call for such a report in May."
Exxon,2017-10,"Also, this month refiner Marathon Petroleum Corp published a report, ""Perspectives on Climate-Related Scenarios,"" meant partly to address suggestions from the Financial Stability Board."

Outgoing Chief Executive John Watson expects production to rise as much as 8 percent worldwide, excluding asset sales. Two flagship liquefied natural gas projects in Australia are finally online after years of development, too."
Exxon,2017-10,"Companies are cautious about the future, however. Exxon seems wary about doing a big deal in Texas unless the company can find enough synergies to justify the price. ConocoPhillips, which reported earnings on Thursday, is cutting spending by a tenth. Chevron's Watson reckons costs next year should stay under control as investments in short-cycle shale projects are already well funded. He appears to be more focused on cash flow than big growth plans."
Exxon,2017-10,"Longer term, though, oil companies face a dilemma between increasing drilling and making money. Exxon illustrates this well. The company is planning a near-fourfold increase in U.S. production by 2025. Some of that may come from acquiring drillers that already produce oil. But Exxon also has plenty of untapped land to develop, which will add more oil to the market."
Exxon,2017-10,"- Exxon Mobil on Oct. 27 reported third-quarter net income of $3.97 billion, compared with $2.7 billion in the same period last year.

The largest independent oil producer reported better-than-expected profit of 34 cents a share compared to a loss of 84 cents a share a year ago. Excluding one-time items, Conoco earned 16 cents a share. By that measure, analysts expected earnings of 8 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S."

Exxon,2017-10,Oct 27 (Reuters) - Canadian oil producer and refiner Imperial Oil Ltd on Friday posted a smaller-than-expected quarterly profit as higher costs and a marginal drop in production offset an increase in realized crude prices.
Exxon,2017-10,"Imperial's realized crude oil price of C$49.03 per barrel was C$9 higher for the latest quarter, but total expenses rose 6.4 percent to C$6.7 billion, and production dipped to average 390,000 gross oil-equivalent barrels per day from 393,000 boepd a year earlier."
Exxon,2017-10,"Still, Imperial realized an 18 percent increase in production from the second quarter of 2017, returning it to profitability. Production in the first half of the year had been negatively affected by factors including a fire at the Syncrude Mildred Lake upgrader."

Exxon,2017-10,"LONDON, Oct 27 (Reuters) - A $1 billion fund created by top energy companies to curb climate change announced its first three investments on Friday and said two new members could be poised join the scheme."
Exxon,2017-10,The Oil and Gas Climate Initiative (OGCI) was set up last year and includes Saudi Aramco and Royal Dutch Shell .
Exxon,2017-10,"Pratima Rangarajan, OGCI chief executive, said she expected more companies to join and that Brazil's Petrobras and Abu Dhabi National Oil Co (ADNOC) were among those interested."
Exxon,2017-10,"""They are potentially joining and were observing today,"" she said in an interview with Reuters."
Exxon,2017-10,"Other participants include BP , Total , Eni , Repsol , Statoil , CNPC, Pemex [PEMX.UL] and Reliance Industries ."
Exxon,2017-10,"Together, the 10 firms produce around 20 percent of the world's oil and gas and last year pledged to invest $1 billion over 10 years on technologies to curb climate change.[nL8N1D52Q7]"
Exxon,2017-10,Rangarajan said new members would be expected to pledge a further $100 million each.
Exxon,2017-10,"In the first investments, U.S. firm Solidia Technologies will receive funding for making cement with carbon dioxide instead of water, potentially lowering emissions by 70 percent and water use by 80 percent, the OGCI said."
Exxon,2017-10,"It will also help U.S.-based Achates Power, which develops vehicle engines that produce fewer greenhouse gas emissions, to roll out its technology worldwide."
Exxon,2017-10,"Neither of the U.S. oil majors, Exxon or Chevron , are a part of the initiative. Rangarajan said the location of its members was not a factor in deciding where investments would be made."
Exxon,2017-10,"""We have to be open to looking anywhere in the world for the best ideas,"" she said."

Exxon,2017-10,"Earlier on Friday, Eni confirmed its production would grow by 5 percent this year to 1.84 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (mboe/d), while investments would fall 18 percent."
Exxon,2017-10,"Production in the third quarter rose 5 percent to 1.8 mboe/d, lifted in part by the restart of fields in Libya."
Exxon,2017-10,The group said it expected output to rise to 1.9 mboe/d in the final quarter despite a delay in ramp-up at its giant Kashagan field to next year. [nS8N1KP00A]

Exxon,2017-10,{{20171027T090001.110+0000}}Big Oil executives jet to Rio for deepwater oil saleBy Alexandra Alper and Simon Webb
Exxon,2017-10,"RIO DE JANEIRO, Oct 27 (Reuters) - Brazil will auction eight blocks in its coveted deepwater oil region on Friday, a prospect that has lured top executives from the world's biggest oil companies to Rio de Janeiro for the bidding round."
Exxon,2017-10,The oil firms and Brazilian officials expect to see aggressive bidding for the more than 12 billion barrels of estimated oil reserves on offer.
Exxon,2017-10,"""It's going to be competitive,"" Bernard Looney, chief executive for upstream at oil major BP , told Reuters on the sidelines of an industry conference in Rio this week."
Exxon,2017-10,"The blocks are in a region with prolific oil production from fields known as pre-salt, where crude and gas sit beneath thousands of feet of salt under the deep Atlantic waters off eastern Brazilian shores."
Exxon,2017-10,"President Michel Temer's government has enacted reforms to make the energy sector more attractive to oil majors, and for the first time foreign energy firms will be offered the rights to operate the pre-salt fields."
Exxon,2017-10,"Previously, the government required state oil giant Petrobras to operate the fields. That made investment less attractive to oil majors, because they could not manage development as they saw fit."
Exxon,2017-10,"The quality of reserves and the improved terms have made Brazil a target for oil majors, even though they have had less appetite for capital-intensive mega projects since crude prices crashed in 2014."
Exxon,2017-10,"""It's great for Brazil that the oil majors are here,"" Wael Sawan, Executive Vice President for Shell's deepwater division, told Reuters, describing Brazil's oil reserves as among the best in the world."
Exxon,2017-10,"Shell will participate in the auction and is confident it can pump from the pre-salt fields at below $40 a barrel, he said. [nL4N1MZ66M]"
Exxon,2017-10,"Exxon Mobil is also expected to bid, oil industry sources said. The U.S. major set the stage for a move into the sought-after offshore region in September, when it won 10 blocks near the pre-salt in another auction."
Exxon,2017-10,"Exxon needs the kind of reserves on offer, as its share price has underperformed peers in part because the firm has been slow to replace reserves."
Exxon,2017-10,Exxon declined to comment on Thursday on its strategy for the bid round.
Exxon,2017-10,"Brazil has big hopes for the volume of oil the energy giants can pump from the blocks. Brazilian oil output could double to more than 5 million barrels per day (bpd) by 2027, up from just shy of 2.6 million bpd produced in August, regulator the ANP said on Thursday. [nL2N1N11FW]"
Exxon,2017-10,"Reforms in Brazil have faced opposition from the left. Just a day before the auction, the Workers Party obtained a federal injunction to suspend the auction from a judge in the state of Amazonas."
Exxon,2017-10,"The injunction does not mean the auction will be blocked because it could easily be overturned on appeal, as is often the case in Brazil."

Exxon,2017-10,"""The Araku-1 well was an ambitious wildcat exploration well that was drilled efficiently and at very low cost,"" Exploration Director Angus McCoss said."
Exxon,2017-10,"""While we have not made a commercial discovery, we are encouraged by recovering gas condensate from the well and remain fully committed to exploration in Suriname and Guyana,"" he said."

Exxon,2017-10,"The well was drilled in a block where Tullow Oil operates with a 30 percent interest alongside joint venture partners, Statoil and Noble Energy , Tullow said."
Exxon,2017-10,"Analysts at Jefferies said that while the Araku-1 exploration well has proved unsuccessful, the result ""ironically"" meant no additional capital expenditure demands on Tullow's balance sheet."
Exxon,2017-10,"Investec analysts said: ""The well was also being closely watched by the market with expectations in our view higher than normal given the recent successes of Exxon across the martime border in Guyana."""

Exxon,2017-10,"{{20171027T015941.042+0000}}UPDATE 1-Brazil judge suspends pre-salt oil auctions set for Friday(Adds details from injunction, background on oil auctions)"
Exxon,2017-10,"BRASILIA, Oct 26 (Reuters) - A federal judge in the Brazilian state of Amazonas issued an injunction on Thursday ordering the suspension of the billion-dollar auctions of pre-salt oil and gas rights scheduled for Friday."
Exxon,2017-10,"The injunction was sought by the leftist Workers Party and could easily be overturned if appealed, as is often the case in Brazil."
Exxon,2017-10,"Major oil firms are vying for the blocks in Brazil's offshore pre-salt area, where billions of barrels of oil are trapped under a layer of salt."
Exxon,2017-10,"The injunction was made public by the Workers Party, which opposes the privatization of oil production and a reduced role for state-run oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA ."
Exxon,2017-10,"In his decision issued in Manaus, Judge Ricardo Sales said it was plausible that the auctions would result in the loss of income to the Brazilian state as argued in the injunction request."
Exxon,2017-10,Sales ordered the suspension of all the second- and third- round auctions organized by Brazilian oil industry regulator ANP. The auctions were due to start in Rio de Janeiro at 9 a.m. (1100 GMT) on Friday.
Exxon,2017-10,"Top global oil companies are lined up to bid in the auctions for some of the world's most prolific deepwater oilfields, a test of their appetite for capital-intensive offshore projects after three years of low oil prices. [L2N1MY1TO]"
Exxon,2017-10,"Firms such as Exxon Mobil , Royal Dutch Shell and Total are expected to be compete for the more than 12 billion barrels of estimated oil reserves that Brazil is offering. At current prices, that volume of oil is worth about $600 billion."
Exxon,2017-10,"Several of the blocks were expected to go to companies that are already developing nearby blocks, such as Shell, Norway's Statoil and Petrobras."

Exxon,2017-10,"CAPE TOWN, Oct 26 (Reuters) - Africa should develop a gas pricing index based on the cost of electricity set midway between existing global benchmarks to ensure fairer pricing in new export projects on the continent, two African ministers said."
Exxon,2017-10,"The idea is being floated when the world's poorest continent, where 600 million people are without electricity, is turning to liquefied natural gas (LNG) as a cheaper way to power up amid plentiful global supply."
Exxon,2017-10,"Plans to boost African power generation by 30,000 megawatts by 2030 could translate into 42 million tonnes of additional LNG consumption a year, according to the U.S. Department of Energy."
Exxon,2017-10,"""The pricing of the LNG coming into Africa is going to be more than 50 percent for electricity, so it will be fixed to the price of electricity,"" Equatorial Guinea's minister Gabriel Obiang Lima told Reuters during the Africa Oil Week conference."
Exxon,2017-10,"""What we need to calculate is the pricing of the power to be able to have this index and that should be something between (the U.S. gas exchange) Henry Hub, which is very low, and the Asian index, so we are talking about a range of between $3-$7 dollars,"" he said on the sidelines of the meeting in Cape Town."
Exxon,2017-10,"Obiang Lima said trading firm Gunvor [GGL.UL] could peg some sales of LNG from its planned Fortuna facility in Equatorial Guinea, due to start in 2020, to the index."
Exxon,2017-10,"Gunvor struck a deal to buy all of the plant's output, but there is a provision allowing Equatorial Guinea and its partners to sell up to half the volumes within Africa. [nL5N1KQ1JE]"
Exxon,2017-10,Equatorial Guinea already exports LNG to countries that include South Korea and Argentina.
Exxon,2017-10,"Angola and Nigeria are also major African LNG exporters, with Cameroon set to start this year. New LNG projects are planned in Senegal, Mozambique, Congo Republic and Tanzania."
Exxon,2017-10,"Equatorial Guinea aims to export LNG to Africa for the first time, including to Mali, Burkina Faso and Ghana. [nL8N1L7451]"
Exxon,2017-10,"Africa's natural gas consumption rose 20 percent from 2011 to 2014 from 3,909 billion cubic feet (bcf) to 4,689 bcf, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, still a tiny market but the world's fastest growing."
Exxon,2017-10,"In Nigeria, Seplat Petroleum expects demand to grow rapidly for use in energy, cement and fertiliser projects."
Exxon,2017-10,"But the still small size of Africa's gas market may make establishing an index difficult, industry experts said."
Exxon,2017-10,"""It would be extremely difficult to find a unified pricing system in Africa at the source. If one day Africa is well-connected with pipelines and many different sources, then maybe an index,"" said Mounir Bouaziz, Royal Dutch Shell's vice president for new business development."

Exxon,2017-10,{{20171026T142924.689+0000}}Brazil vs Mexico: Latin America's fight for Big Oil's money* Latin American reforms luring oil firms to bid on blocks
Exxon,2017-10,"HOUSTON/RIO DE JANEIRO, Oct 26 (Reuters) - Brazil and Mexico are competing for a diminishing resource: the investment dollars of oil majors beating a retreat from the big-ticket offshore projects they once coveted."
Exxon,2017-10,"After two waves of resource nationalism that left few openings in Latin America for energy giants such as Exxon Mobil Corp , Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Total , the tables are turning."
Exxon,2017-10,Governments throughout the continent are enacting reforms and changing contract terms to lure oil firms that have slashed spending as they adapt to lower crude prices. Global policy changes to address climate change have given an added sense of urgency to governments in the region and worldwide that are sitting on oil and gas reserves. They want to pump it before it becomes less valuable.
Exxon,2017-10,"""Both are attractive. Both have real potential,"" said Wael Sawan, Shell's executive vice president for deepwater. ""We have as a company, I think as an industry, scarce capital resources to be able to make the investments that the particular projects in deep water require."""
Exxon,2017-10,"Sawan is among the executives from the world's top energy firms who have jetted into Rio de Janeiro this week, hoping to win fields in Brazil's latest auction."
Exxon,2017-10,"Brazil has created a more conducive environment for investment than in the past, and venturing into Mexico looks exciting despite concerns over political risk and lack of infrastructure, he said."
Exxon,2017-10,"Low crude prices have made oil firms choose carefully where they invest, but they need the substantial reserves Brazil and Mexico are offering. The rate that energy companies replace the barrels they produce is a key metric for shareholders, and offshore blocks such as those in Mexico and Brazil come with billions of barrels in available reserves."
Exxon,2017-10,Latin America governments have relaxed deal terms and set accelerated auction schedules to lure investment to everything from ultra-deep water to mature fields that need specialist technology to squeeze more oil and gas from wells.
Exxon,2017-10,"To boost its chances, Brazil has ended its requirement for state-controlled Petrobras to be the operator of deep-sea projects in the country's pre-salt province, which contains large volumes of high-value light oil. That gives majors more freedom to manage exploration and output."
Exxon,2017-10,"Brazil has loosened local content requirements on equipment and supplies, which had previously slowed development, and set out a three-year calendar of oilfield auctions to facilitate planning for foreign firms."
Exxon,2017-10,"Mexico has countered with an easier qualification process to bid in auctions and is selling geological data on oilfields for majors and service firms to reprocess, while offering flexible local content requirements according to field type."
Exxon,2017-10,"For many oil majors, the Mexican side of the Gulf offers a familiar geology: the formations below the seabed are similar to those they have drilled for decades in the nearby U.S. waters. But unlike Brazil, there has been no deepwater development in Mexico, so more infrastructure needs to be built."
Exxon,2017-10,"Beyond the potential of the oilfields, the two countries offer different political challenges."
Exxon,2017-10,"Mexico's relatively recent reforms and a presidential election in 2018 imply a high political risk for majors, many of which were squeezed out of their Venezuela holdings by the country's socialist governments in the last decade."
Exxon,2017-10,Foreign firms are beginning to operate in Mexico just as the country's relationship with the United States worsens as U.S. President Donald Trump seeks trade concessions from Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto.
Exxon,2017-10,"Trump's public statements on Mexico have riled many Mexicans, giving the leftist opposition firebrand Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who is openly critical of Trump, a lift in the opinion polls. Lopez Obrador has said he could hold a referendum on the energy reform if he became president. [nL4N1FV4PI]"
Exxon,2017-10,"""I have no doubts that Mexico could be more attractive than Brazil,"" said Francisco Monaldi, a fellow in Latin American Energy Policy at Rice University's Baker Institute."
Exxon,2017-10,"""But the possible combination of Trump and Lopez Obrador is scary for investors,"" Monaldi said."
Exxon,2017-10,"Mexico's next bidding round should be concluded in January and includes 29 blocks that hold an estimated 4.2 billion barrels of prospective reserves. Another 35 blocks in shallow water areas with potentially 2 billion barrels will follow, with results expected to be announced in March. [nL2N1MU1PT]"
Exxon,2017-10,"Brazilian authorities have billed the round to be held on Friday its most competitive yet. Some 16 firms qualified to bid for blocks in the country's pre-salt reservoirs, where oil and gas are trapped under layers of salt beneath the ocean floor."
Exxon,2017-10,"""In the last year we have made extraordinary advances in the regulatory framework,"" said Joao Carlos de Luca, an adviser to the Brazilian Petroleum, Gas and Biofuels Institute that represents oil companies working in the country. ""That has put Brazil back on the map."""
Exxon,2017-10,"The previous auction, for 287 blocks in September, received $1.2 billion in offers, far more than expected. That was largely down to Exxon, which stole the show with aggressive bids. Until that round, Exxon was one of the few big oil firms absent from Brazil's offshore areas."
Exxon,2017-10,"Exxon has spent heavily this year on projects to replenish diminishing reserves, including in the U.S. Permian Basin shale play."
Exxon,2017-10,"In South America, Exxon has also invested in Argentina's Vaca Muerta shale areas while venturing into offshore Guyana along with Hess Corp in a $4.4 billion offshore project. [nL2N1M929Q] [nL3N1JD3UC] [nL2N1LI1RA]"
Exxon,2017-10,"In Ecuador, where every administration in recent decades has changed the country's oil contracts, President Lenin Moreno has called two new bidding rounds in 2018 for up to 24 blocks under more attractive terms. [nL2N1MH14S]"
Exxon,2017-10,Argentina also plans to announce next year a bidding round for oil and gas exploration blocks off its Atlantic coast after a 15-year hiatus on offshore auctions.
Exxon,2017-10,"""Current conditions are exactly opposed to those for nationalism. Everybody is now offering fields, but the spots available in the majors' portfolios under $50-60 per barrel of crude are just a few,"" Monaldi said."
Exxon,2017-10,"Other oil majors including BP Plc and Chevron Corp also are exploring investment opportunities in the region, from the Gulf of Mexico to Argentina."
Exxon,2017-10,"But making the case within oil majors for offshore capital-intensive projects is a challenge, said Javier La Rosa, president of Chevron's Brazil unit, at an industry conference in Rio on Wednesday."
Exxon,2017-10,"""I face this battle each year when our corporate business plan is put out,"" he said. ""It is not easy to convince shareholders to spend more money on deepwater fields when there are other lower cost options still available."""

Exxon,2017-10,"DALLAS, Oct 25 (Reuters Breakingviews) - It's a dilemma worthy of the OPEC cartel. U.S.-focused oil producers may be targeting higher returns rather than pumping more crude. Majors like Exxon Mobil and Chevron , reporting third-quarter earnings on Friday, know the trade-off, too. Selling less oil at a higher price is appealing if everyone joins in. But a history of internal tensions at the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries shows how easily self-interest prevails."
Exxon,2017-10,"Oil companies are better off than 20 months ago when the West Texas Intermediate price hovered around $30 a barrel: it is now above $50. Still, crude is plentiful and Anadarko Petroleum , Hess and ConocoPhillips , three large U.S. producers, cut capital-spending estimates last quarter. The U.S. rig count is falling, and earlier this week Halliburton Chief Executive Jeffrey Miller said his clients were focusing on ""cost-effective"" production."
Exxon,2017-10,"Some are shifting compensation plans for top executives to include more profit-related metrics like return on capital. Chevron restructured its pay in the spring, Evercore ISI notes, urging others to follow. In theory, if companies avoid drilling in expensive places they'll improve margins, and the reduced supply should in turn push up prices."
Exxon,2017-10,- ConocoPhillips is set to report third-quarter earnings on Oct. 26. Exxon Mobil and Chevron follow on Oct. 27.
Exxon,2017-10,"- Anadarko Petroleum and ConocoPhillips cut their capital-spending estimates last quarter, and U.S. rig counts have fallen in 10 of the past 13 weeks, according to Baker Hughes, though the count is still 64 percent higher than its level at the same time last year."
Exxon,2017-10,"- Halliburton Chief Executive Jeffrey Miller said on Oct. 23 in its third-quarter earnings call with analysts that the company's customers, which include oil producers in the U.S. Permian and Bakken basins, were focused on ""cost-effective"" production. He also said that in North America, a $50 per barrel oil price ""drives significant activity."""
Exxon,2017-10,"- On Oct. 11, the Energy Information Administration projected U.S. crude production would average 9.2 million barrels per day in 2017 and 9.9 million bpd in 2018, surpassing the previous record of 9.6 million bpd in 1970. The 2017 estimates fell slightly from the previous month, but the forecast for 2018 was slightly higher. Continental Resources Chief Executive Harold Hamm said on Sept. 21 that the EIA's predictions for U.S. oil production were ""flat wrong."""

Exxon,2017-10,{{20171025T110002.334+0000}}PREVIEW-Brazil auction tests oil major appetite for deepwater fields By Marta Nogueira and Alexandra Alper
Exxon,2017-10,"RIO DE JANEIRO, Oct 25 (Reuters) - Top global oil companies will compete on Friday in Brazil's billion-dollar auction for some of the world's most prolific deepwater oilfields, a test of their appetite for capital intensive offshore projects after three years of low oil prices."
Exxon,2017-10,"Competition between firms such as Exxon Mobil , Royal Dutch Shell and Total is expected to be fierce for the more than 12 billion barrels of estimated oil reserves Brazil is offering. At current prices, that volume of oil is worth around $600 billion."
Exxon,2017-10,"After reforms to the energy sector in the past year and a half, Brazil will auction eight blocks on more attractive terms than ever before to international firms for access to its pre-salt fields. They are reservoirs of oil that sit beneath thousands of feet of salt under the deep Atlantic waters off eastern Brazilian shores."
Exxon,2017-10,"Big oil firms have stepped back from multi-year projects such as those in deepwater fields since oil prices crashed in 2014, as they cut costs to survive at prices of around $50 a barrel."
Exxon,2017-10,But the production potential and the size of the reserves on offer make Brazil attractive despite the capital constraints oil majors face in a low price environment.
Exxon,2017-10,"""The quality of the reserves in Brazil is one of the best in the world, if not the best,"" said Wael Sawan, Executive Vice President for Shell's deepwater division. He said that the nature and density of the reserves meant they produced ""unparalleled volumes"" of oil, he said."
Exxon,2017-10,"Reforms enacted under President Michel Temer had made the fields more attractive than they would have been a couple of years earlier, Shell's Sawan said."
Exxon,2017-10,Shell is the largest foreign operator in Brazil's deepwater oilfields. Sawan said the firm would participate in the auction but declined to give any further details.
Exxon,2017-10,"Exxon and Total are also expected to bid in the auction, oil industry sources said."
Exxon,2017-10,"Exxon has been struggling to replace crude reserves in recent years. The U.S. major stole the show at the last Brazilian oilfield auction in September, which was for areas outside the pre-salt."
Exxon,2017-10,"Exxon took 10 areas, six in partnership with Petrobras, and paid a record 2.24 billion reais for one block alone. That set the stage for an aggressive bid for pre-salt, analysts said. [nL2N1M929Q]"
Exxon,2017-10,"Exxon's Brazil Country Manager Carla Lacerda on Thursday declined to comment on Exxon's plans ahead of the bid round, but a Brazilian oil executive said a joint bid between the American firm and the Brazilian company would make sense."
Exxon,2017-10,Exxon is being punished by shareholders for failing to replace reserves more quickly.
Exxon,2017-10,"The last pre-salt auction was a limited success. In 2013, the first pre-salt round saw just one bid by Petrobras, Shell, Total, CNPC and CNOOC, for one block on offer, the Libra area."
Exxon,2017-10,"This week, Brazil is for the first time allowing foreign oil firms the right to operate in the pre-salt area, one of the biggest reforms enacted under Temer. Previously, they had to work as a minority partner with Petrobras in the area."
Exxon,2017-10,"Other reforms included cuts to local content requirements, which had been aimed at stimulating the domestic oil service industry but slowed development and deterred investment."
Exxon,2017-10,"Those changes may prompt the 16 companies registered to bid aggressively, despite political risk in Brazil, which has seen successive governments mired in corruption scandals."
Exxon,2017-10,Petrobras itself is still reeling after a massive graft scandal in which construction companies bilked the state oil giant out of billions.
Exxon,2017-10,"""I don't see how this can fail,"" said Magda Chambriard, former director of Brazil's oil regulator ANP. ""Investors are scared with the low oil prices, but...they are looking for a project pipeline, with good projects and chances to grow."""
Exxon,2017-10,"The contracts will be offered under a production sharing scheme, where the winner will offer the government the biggest share of oil after cost. The government will rake in 7.75 billion reais ($2.39 billion) in signing bonuses if it sells all the blocks, which are located in the Campos and Santos basins."
Exxon,2017-10,"Petrobras has exercised its preemptive right to three blocks - Sapinhoa, Peroba, and Alto de Cabo Frio Central - meaning it will serve as operator and likely take a 30 percent minimum stake in the consortia behind the winning bids for those areas."
Exxon,2017-10,"Expectations are high for the Peroba block, which has an estimated 5.3 billion barrels of oil, while Carcara and Alto de Cabo frio Central are also seen as enticing."
Exxon,2017-10,"Several of the blocks are expected to go to companies that are already developing nearby blocks, such as Shell, Norway's Statoil and Petrobras. ($1 = 3.2376 reais)"

Exxon,2017-10,{{20171023T102826.186+0000}}UPDATE 1-Saudi Aramco CEO says listing on track for 2018 - CNBC(Adds quotes)
Exxon,2017-10,"DUBAI, Oct 23 (Reuters) - Saudi Aramco's initial public offering will take place in 2018 as planned and the listing venue will be revealed in due course, the company's chief executive said in a CNBC interview broadcast on Monday."
Exxon,2017-10,"""We have always said that we will be listing in 2018, and to be more specific, in the second half of 2018,"" CEO Amin Nasser said, later adding: ""The IPO is on track. The listing venue will be discussed and shared in due course."""
Exxon,2017-10,"Aramco is preparing to list about 5 percent of its shares in local and international stock markets. It has yet to choose an overseas market. Nasser rejected a report that China was emerging as a frontrunner in a possible plan to delay the IPO and sell shares to sovereign wealth funds, CNBC said."
Exxon,2017-10,"""Saudi Aramco are not talking, as I said, to the Chinese or others,"" he said."
Exxon,2017-10,"Regarding the IPO process and possible venues for the listing, Nasser said all was still being considered."
Exxon,2017-10,"""All of that analysis is being reviewed in detail ... to make a decision at a certain stage, and we're not going to be pushed, you know, by a journalist saying this needs to be talked about or not."""
Exxon,2017-10,Reuters reported last week that China was offering to buy up to 5 percent of Saudi Aramco directly. The Financial Times reported earlier this month that the company was considering shelving IPO plans in favour of a private share sale to world sovereign funds and institutional investors. [nL4N1MO563][nL4N1MO569]
Exxon,2017-10,"Nasser also said Aramco will ""meet all the requirements of that market in terms of reserve assessment"" and other rules of the country where it chooses to list. He said Saudi Arabia was largely operating in line with its closest peers, such as Exxon Mobil and BP ."
Exxon,2017-10,"""I can say Aramco has always been run like a publicly traded company,"" he said. ""If you look at our governance, we have independent board members. Everything that has been done in the company is similar to any international oil company in terms of the way we do business."""
Exxon,2017-10,"Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said last year the country was considering listing about 5 percent of Aramco in 2018 in a deal that could raise $100 billion, if the company is valued at about $2 trillion as hoped,"

Exxon,2017-10,"Data storage company Western Digital Corp is expected to post a third-quarter profit on Thursday, from a loss last year, helped by a rise in demand for its flash memory chips.

Exxon,2017-10,"Halliburton Co, the No.3 oilfield services provider, is expected to report a higher third-quarter profit, helped by increased drilling activity in North America.

Exxon,2017-10,"Boston-based custody bank State Street Corp is expected to report a rise in net interest income for the third quarter, aided by higher interest rates and modest loan growth. Results will also be driven by higher market levels, despite seasonally slower foreign exchange and securities lending revenues."
Exxon,2017-10,"Toymaker Hasbro Inc, which reports third-quarter results, said in July that second-half revenue will be skewed more towards fourth quarter due to the release timing of movie franchises such as Star Wars and customers shifting to sourcing inventory just-in-time for the holidays. Investors will also be interested in comments on how the Toys ""R"" Us bankruptcy would affect Hasbro, which gets about 10 percent of its revenue from the retailer."

Exxon,2017-10,"NEW YORK, Oct 19 (Reuters) - Thirty years ago, before heading to work at the New York Stock Exchange, Peter Kenny left his home in lower Manhattan and made a detour to the nearby Our Lady of Victory church to pray to St. Jude, the Roman Catholic patron saint of desperate and lost causes."
Exxon,2017-10,"The reason was the stock market crash known as ""Black Monday"" on October 19, 1987."
Exxon,2017-10,"Kenny, now senior market strategist at Global Markets Advisory Group in New York, was a newly minted member of the New York Stock Exchange, having joined the exchange in February that year. He was stunned by the events that unfolded the previous day, the worst trading day in U.S. history."
Exxon,2017-10,"""I don't think anyone was prepared for what actually transpired in the overseas markets, which led to the bloodbath on Monday,"" said Kenny."
Exxon,2017-10,"When it was over, the Dow Jones Industrial Average <.DJI> had lost 22.6 percent in one day, equivalent to a drop of about 5,200 points in the index today. The benchmark U.S. S&P 500 index <.SPX> plunged 20.5 percent on Black Monday, equal to a drop of over 520 points today, and the Nasdaq dropped 11.4 percent, comparable to a drop of about 750 points."
Exxon,2017-10,"In 1987 U.S. stock prices had climbed steadily all year, as they have in 2017, with each of the three major U.S. indexes hitting record highs in late August. But September turned into a difficult month, with each index falling more than 2.0 percent, though not by enough to raise alarm bells among investors."
Exxon,2017-10,"But as the calendar flipped to October, the selling in U.S. equity markets intensified. The Dow Jones Industrial Average <.DJI> and S&P 500 <.SPX> fell more than 9.0 percent in the week before Black Monday."
Exxon,2017-10,"On the morning of Monday, October 19, 1987, Art Hogan, then a floor broker at the Boston Stock Exchange, expected a possible rebound for stock prices. Nothing had prepared him for what was to unfold."
Exxon,2017-10,"""It was clear in that first hour... this was going to be as bad as we've seen in our lifetimes,"" said Hogan, now chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities in New York."
Exxon,2017-10,"Many describe the events of Black Monday as the first instance of computer trading gone haywire, caused by the use of portfolio insurance, a hedging strategy against market declines that involves selling short in stock index futures."
Exxon,2017-10,"The prior week's fall in U.S. stocks led to selling by investors in Asian markets to limit losses. Those losses then signaled investors in Europe to sell, which caused increased selling by the time U.S. markets were to open on Black Monday."
Exxon,2017-10,"""It was like nobody wanted to question the computer,"" said Ken Polcari, director of the NYSE floor division at O'Neil Securities in New York, who was a 26-year-old in his second year as a member of the NYSE."
Exxon,2017-10,"""Then what happens is it feeds on itself because as the prices got worse the risk management software kept spitting out a new message - You need to sell more,"" said Polcari."
Exxon,2017-10,"Portfolio insurance, the short selling of stock index futures to protect against a decline in value, caused computerized program trading to issue sell orders as a safeguard against more losses. Instead, losses intensified, causing even more sell orders in a feedback loop."
Exxon,2017-10,"With computer trading in its infancy, the floor of the NYSE was filled with more members than today, with trades executed by hand on paper. Thousands of traders scrambled to handle the tidal wave of selling, with volumes so extreme prices were delayed by hours, further complicating the process."
Exxon,2017-10,"""The opening was 90 minutes (delayed), so you knew there was a lot of influx of orders, the futures (contracts) were down, everything was down, so we knew we were in for a rough ride,"" said Peter Costa, president at Empire Executions Inc in New York, who has been working on the trading floor since 1981."
Exxon,2017-10,"The widespread selling and delay in reporting prices also hit the stock options market, said Gordon Charlop, a managing director at Rosenblatt Securities in New York who was trading options on the American Exchange at the time of the crash."
Exxon,2017-10,"""The options market slowed down to a crawl because nobody could really figure out how to derive options prices from equities because we weren't sure what the equity prices were,"" said Charlop."
Exxon,2017-10,"Of the 30 companies whose stocks are in the Dow today, slightly less than half were in the index at the time. American Express lost 26.2 percent on Black Monday, Procter & Gamble plunged 27.8 percent, and Exxon Mobil tumbled 23.4 percent."
Exxon,2017-10,"""The price movements in the stocks were not like anything I had ever seen prior to that day, or since that day, in fact,"" said Ted Weisberg, floor trader with Seaport Securities in New York, who has been a member of the exchange since 1969."
Exxon,2017-10,"""It was in fact the scariest day, the most emotional day, except when we came back to work after September 11, that I have ever spent on the trading floor."""

Exxon,2017-10,"LONDON, Oct 13 (Reuters) - The world's top trading houses, among the most nimble entities in oil, say even they aren't sure how to stay a step ahead of a coming cut in shipping fuel sulphur."
Exxon,2017-10,"The new rules come into force in just over two years, and threaten to upend markets from heating fuel to crude oil."
Exxon,2017-10,"But uncertainty around them casts a shadow over how smoothly the transition can go; industry experts say investments in refining, tank storage or vessel upgrades need to happen now in order to be ready in time."
Exxon,2017-10,"""I don't know if it's going to provide opportunity or disaster at the moment, to be honest,"" Vitol boss Ian Taylor told the Reuters Global Commodity Summit."
Exxon,2017-10,"Nearly a year after the International Maritime Organization finalised rules that will cap ships' sulphur emissions at 0.5 percent of fuel content in 2020, from 3.5 percent now, Taylor and the heads of trading firms Gunvor, Glencore and Mercuria said there were still too many unanswered questions."
Exxon,2017-10,The lack of clarity could create immense volatility in fuel prices if the bulk of vessels turn to low-sulphur gasoil.
Exxon,2017-10,"But if shippers opt for scrubbers, it could nullify returns on expensive refinery upgrades or low-sulphur fuel storage tanks and blending facilities. Analysts at JBC warn that less than 5 percent of the global fleet will add scrubbers. [nL4N1MN3KK]"
Exxon,2017-10,"""The big question is, obviously, if shipowners are going to equip their ships with scrubbers,"" said Torbjorn Tornqvist, chief executive of Gunvor Group. ""If everyone would equip their ships with scrubbers, there is absolutely no impact on refining."""
Exxon,2017-10,"""These are questions to which we just don't have the answers at this point,"" he added."
Exxon,2017-10,"Some refineries, including those operated by Exxon Mobil , Total and Shell , have announced upgrades to cut high-sulphur fuel output. But consultancy KBC has warned that 40 percent of Middle Eastern and European refineries are not prepared for the change. [nL8N1L144R]"
Exxon,2017-10,"None of the traders said they would invest in scrubbers, including Gunvor, which is bulking up its shipping division.

Exxon,2017-10,REUTERS SUMMIT-Opportunity or disaster? Traders see choppy waters due to shipping sulphur cap - Reuters News
Exxon,2017-10,"LONDON, Oct 13 (Reuters) - The world's top trading houses, among the most nimble entities in oil, say even they aren't sure how to stay a step ahead of a coming cut in shipping fuel sulphur."
Exxon,2017-10,"The new rules come into force in just over two years, and threaten to upend markets from heating fuel to crude oil."
Exxon,2017-10,"But uncertainty around them casts a shadow over how smoothly the transition can go; industry experts say investments in refining, tank storage or vessel upgrades need to happen now in order to be ready in time."
Exxon,2017-10,"""I don't know if it's going to provide opportunity or disaster at the moment, to be honest,"" Vitol boss Ian Taylor told the Reuters Global Commodity Summit."
Exxon,2017-10,"Nearly a year after the International Maritime Organization finalised rules that will cap ships' sulphur emissions at 0.5 percent of fuel content in 2020, from 3.5 percent now, Taylor and the heads of trading firms Gunvor, Glencore and Mercuria said there were still too many unanswered questions."
Exxon,2017-10,The lack of clarity could create immense volatility in fuel prices if the bulk of vessels turn to low-sulphur gasoil.
Exxon,2017-10,"But if shippers opt for scrubbers, it could nullify returns on expensive refinery upgrades or low-sulphur fuel storage tanks and blending facilities. Analysts at JBC warn that less than 5 percent of the global fleet will add scrubbers. [nL4N1MN3KK]"
Exxon,2017-10,"""The big question is, obviously, if shipowners are going to equip their ships with scrubbers,"" said Torbjorn Tornqvist, chief executive of Gunvor Group. ""If everyone would equip their ships with scrubbers, there is absolutely no impact on refining."""
Exxon,2017-10,"""These are questions to which we just don't have the answers at this point,"" he added."
Exxon,2017-10,"Some refineries, including those operated by Exxon Mobil , Total and Shell , have announced upgrades to cut high-sulphur fuel output. But consultancy KBC has warned that 40 percent of Middle Eastern and European refineries are not prepared for the change. [nL8N1L144R]"
Exxon,2017-10,"None of the traders said they would invest in scrubbers, including Gunvor, which is bulking up its shipping division.

Exxon,2017-10,"SINGAPORE, Oct 12 (Reuters) - U.S. oil major ExxonMobil officially opened its third cogeneration power plant in Singapore on Thursday on the site of its Jurong refinery, increasing its total cogeneration capacity in the city-state by nearly a quarter."
Exxon,2017-10,"The new 84 megawatt cogeneration plant - which produces both electricity and steam - will increase the energy efficiency of the refinery, the company said. Together with its two other plants, the Jurong site has combined power capacity of 440 megawatts."

Exxon,2017-10,"MILAN, Oct 11 (Reuters) - French oil company Total and energy group Erg are in exclusive talks to try and sell their Italian petrol station network, sources said, after some investors grew jittery over the move to electric cars."
Exxon,2017-10,"Italian refiner API Anonima Petroli, which already owns 2,600 stations of its own, is in exclusive talks to buy the pump network to create efficiencies of scale, three sources said on Wednesday."
Exxon,2017-10,"""The aim is to reach a general agreement in coming weeks and wrap the deal up by the year end,"" one of the sources said, but added no final decision had been taken yet."
Exxon,2017-10,"Total and Erg jointly control TotalErg which operates close to 2,600 service stations in Italy with a market share of around 11 percent."
Exxon,2017-10,Last year they appointed HSBC and Rothschild to sell the business which sources have said could be worth more than 600 million euros ($710 million).
Exxon,2017-10,The deal originally drew interest from private equity and industry players but people close to the matter said many had opted not to press ahead.
Exxon,2017-10,One of the sources said investors were concerned that the rise of electric cars might mean traditional pump stations could go into decline.
Exxon,2017-10,"The number of electric vehicles on roads is forecast to grow significantly in the coming decades, with an impact on petrol consumption and pump network business models."
Exxon,2017-10,"Charging points are becoming more common in workplaces, shopping centres and public venues."
Exxon,2017-10,"In Italy, the country's biggest utility Enel has already earmarked around 300 million euros to install some 12,000 recharging columns to meet demand. Some of those columns will be installed in existing pump stations."
Exxon,2017-10,"""TotalErg has been trying to sell its network for a long time but it's a hard sell because any buyer will have to spend to modernise,"" a banking source said on Wednesday."
Exxon,2017-10,"Privately-owned API had been negotiating with private equity groups to back its bid, sources previously said [nL8N1I72CT]. But with interest waning, two sources said it had now turned to Italian banks UniCredit and UBI to help it fund the deal."
Exxon,2017-10,"The TotalErg joint venture also holds a quarter of Italian refinery Sarpom, controlled by ExxonMobil's Esso unit, which sources previously said was a stumbling block to the deal."
Exxon,2017-10,One of the sources on Wednesday said the talks with API excluded the Sarpom stake by way of a sweetener.

Exxon,2017-10,"JUBA, Oct 11 (Reuters) - South Sudan's president was a no-show for the nation's first international oil conference, a gathering that also failed to attract prospective investors from the biggest global energy companies."
Exxon,2017-10,"The turnout shows only smaller companies are risking bets on the oil sector of the world's youngest country. South Sudan has 3.5 billion barrels of oil and 3 trillion cubic feet of natural gas in proven reserves, and is seen by companies as one of the last frontiers in energy exploration in sub-Saharan Africa."
Exxon,2017-10,"But a civil war that broke out in late 2013 dashed the hopes of oil major Exxon Mobil , which has ditched exploration plans. Its rival Total has put such plans on hold. Four million people have fled the conflict."

Exxon,2017-10,"But at coffee breaks conference attendees said they worried that political obstacles, more than technical ones, would plague any possible investment."
Exxon,2017-10,A fragile peace deal broke down last year amid gun battles between soldiers and rebels in Juba. International efforts to bring warring sides to new talks have not succeeded.

Exxon,2017-10,{{20171010T153536.247+0000}}INTERVIEW-South Sudan targets oilfield security ahead of restoring productionBy Maggie Fick
Exxon,2017-10,"JUBA, Oct 10 (Reuters) - South Sudan is tackling the chief obstacle to new investment in its oil sector - security - as it aims next year to restore production to the level recorded before war broke out in 2013, the oil minister said on Tuesday."
Exxon,2017-10,"""Security is now under control, and those investing will be provided with security,"" Minister Ezekiel Lol Gatkuoth said in an interview in the South Sudanese capital Juba."
Exxon,2017-10,"High hopes for the fledgling oil sector of the world's youngest nation evaporated when conflict erupted, forcing oil firms to shut in crude and cutting production to 130,000 barrels per day (bpd)."
Exxon,2017-10,"The country has sub-Saharan Africa's third-largest reserves and is the only mature oil producer in East Africa. But it is embroiled in a war that has forced a third of its population to flee, creating Africa's biggest refugee crisis since the Rwandan genocide."
Exxon,2017-10,"All but one oil asset, the Melut Basin project, remain shut in due to conflict."
Exxon,2017-10,"But a security force comprised of soldiers, national security officers and police was deployed this year to the Melut Basin. It is operated by a consortium including China National Petroleum Co and Malaysia's state-run oil and gas firm Petronas."
Exxon,2017-10,The minister said this deployment showed the government's commitment to ensuring oil companies are provided with security which is critical to securing investments badly needed to boost production and government revenues.
Exxon,2017-10,"""Resumption of production ... back to where it used to be, increase in production and exploration in certain areas, these are our priorities,"" he said."
Exxon,2017-10,"Giving a more modest target than other officials have this year, he said production would reach 150,000 bpd by the end of 2017 after output is increased in the Melut Basin."
Exxon,2017-10,"""Next year it will reach 200,000 (bpd),"" he added. Output had reached about 245,000 bpd before the war."
Exxon,2017-10,"On Wednesday, Juba will host executives from French oil major Total and nearly a dozen other oil companies for a conference to bring new investment."
Exxon,2017-10,"That could still be a hard sell to firms such as ExxonMobil , which the minister said shunned his offer to take a stake in a block in what the government says is its biggest untapped oil deposit."
Exxon,2017-10,"The United Nations says South Sudanese soldiers have committed violations against civilians that may amount to war crimes, charges the government says are baseless."
Exxon,2017-10,"Gun battles in Juba in July 2016 ended a fragile peace process, and the most powerful rebel figure - the former vice president - is under house arrest in South Africa."
Exxon,2017-10,"As recently as March, rebels kidnapped four oil workers including a Pakistani national in a bid to force their Chinese and Malaysian consortium to leave the country."
Exxon,2017-10,"The government is talking to private security firms who are preparing options for ""third-party security"" for existing oil projects, the minister said."

Exxon,2017-10,"On the sidelines of the FT Africa Summit in London, dos Santos said changes to the Sonangol board announced last week would help the company revamp new exploration and production agreements and significantly cut costs."
Exxon,2017-10,"""We are rethinking all our strategy, with a view of being able to produce barrels within $40-$50 per barrel,"" said dos Santos, the billionaire daughter of Angola's President Jose Eduardo dos Santos."
Exxon,2017-10,"She said some projects were targeting a breakeven as low as $20-$30 per barrel, adding the changes were essential so new concession agreements could begin ""delivering dollars per barrel, rather than just cost."""
Exxon,2017-10,"""In the past, we had investments that were quite heavy, quite capex heavy. That leaves us with a portfolio with barrels over $70, over $80, so we have some issues with some fields,"" dos Santos said."
Exxon,2017-10,"Sonangol has been trying since the recent slump in oil prices to reduce costs and attract investment, but dos Santos said bringing in new talent, particularly people with experience at multinational companies and oil majors, could deliver further results."
Exxon,2017-10,"In a statement on Friday, Sonangol said it had saved $1.7 billion thanks to spending cuts since 2014. But it also said it had replaced the chairman of its executive committee, Paulino Jeronimo, who had managed new concessions and relationships with operators. [nL8N1MH4Y0]"

Exxon,2017-10,"Nate, which has already killed three people in Costa Rica, according to local authorities, is forecast to scrape past Honduras and Mexico, enter the Gulf and strengthen into a hurricane before making landfall early on Sunday in Louisiana, near several major refineries."
Exxon,2017-10,"That path takes it through an area populated by offshore oil and natural gas platforms, which pumps more than 1.6 million barrels of crude per day, about 17 percent of U.S. output, according to government data."
