Exxon,2017-1,"WASHINGTON, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Republicans on Monday continued their drive to loosen U.S. regulation, taking the first step to kill five Obama-era rules on corruption, the environment, labor and guns under the virtually untested Congressional Review Act."
Exxon,2017-1,"The House Rules Committee sent to the full chamber three regulations enacted under former President Barack Obama, a Democrat, to ax."
Exxon,2017-1,"They were the Stream Protection Rule, the Securities and Exchange Commission's ""resource extraction rule,"" and one on gun buying."
Exxon,2017-1,"Republicans put as much urgency on limiting what they consider over-regulation that stifles economic growth as they do on overhauling the tax code and dismantling the Affordable Care Act, according to House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy."
Exxon,2017-1,This is the first time the Republican-led House of Representatives has targeted specific rules since convening on Jan. 3. Earlier this month it passed bills to limit regulatory agencies and Republican President Donald Trump is cutting regulation through executive orders. [nL1N1FK0UQ]
Exxon,2017-1,"Under the law, Congress can use simple majority votes to stop recent regulations in their tracks. Agencies cannot create a new rule to replace any part of an overturned regulation. Timing in the law means any rules enacted in the final months of Obama's administration are eligible for axing."
Exxon,2017-1,"The law has been used effectively only once, in 2001. Both sides consider this week a test of its powers."
Exxon,2017-1,"On Tuesday the Rules Committee will send two more regulations to the full chamber, which is expected to vote to kill all five on Wednesday and then hand them off to the Senate. [nL1N1FF0QX]"
Exxon,2017-1,"Senate Republicans on Monday prepared to act quickly after the House vote, with Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Environment Committee Chairman James Inhofe introducing companion measures on the stream and extraction rules."
Exxon,2017-1,"The Interior Department took years to craft the stream rule, hoping to prevent coal-mining waste from contaminating water sources in areas near mountain-top removal mining sites. Critics say it is unnecessary and goes too far, wiping out jobs and usurping state rights."
Exxon,2017-1,"The extraction rule is required in the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law, but was only approved six years later this summer. It requires companies such as Exxon Mobil Corp to state publicly how much they pay governments in taxes and other fees. Opponents say it hurts U.S. energy companies, while human rights groups argue it reduces corruption. [nL1N1FK0Z1]"
Exxon,2017-1,"Meanwhile, the gun rule requires extra scrutiny of purchasers who receive Social Security benefits and also have a history of mental illness."
Exxon,2017-1,"Liberal groups are outraged by the rollbacks, but their traditional allies, Democratic lawmakers, have limited means to stop them in the Republican-dominated Congress."
Exxon,2017-1,"Those on the Rules Committee said important protections were being rushed to the chopping block and pleaded for hearings on the regulations, to no avail."
Exxon,2017-1,"This week House Democrats and activists are planning to rally the public, hoping to persuade Republicans to vote no. Senate Democrats cannot filibuster the measures but congressional aides expect them to slow the process by taking the full five hours they are allowed to speak against each measure on the chamber's floor."

Exxon,2017-1,"WASHINGTON, Jan 30 (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate advanced the nomination of former Exxon Mobil Corp Chief Executive Rex Tillerson on Monday to be President Donald Trump's secretary of state, moving closer to filling a key seat on the Republican's national security team despite partisan rancor over Trump's immigration order."
Exxon,2017-1,"The vote was 56 to 43 to move toward a final confirmation vote after up to 30 hours' debate, putting a final vote very early on Wednesday, if senators do not agree to change the time."
Exxon,2017-1,The vote broke largely along party lines. Every Republican favored advancing the nomination and all but four members of the Democratic caucus voted against it.
Exxon,2017-1,"The Senate's Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer, and several other members of the party tried, but failed, to delay considering Tillerson because of Trump's executive order banning immigration from seven mostly Muslim countries and temporarily halting the entry of refugees. [nL1N1FK0WQ]"
Exxon,2017-1,"They said they wanted to question Tillerson more closely on his views on Muslim immigration. During his confirmation hearing, the former oil executive said he did not support a ""blanket-type rejection"" of any group of people."
Exxon,2017-1,"Trump and his supporters, including many Republicans, said his order is necessary to keep Americans safe and is not intended to ban Muslims, despite addressing only Muslim-majority nations whose citizens have not been involved in attacks on the United States."
Exxon,2017-1,They said it was important to fill important slots on Trump's national security team quickly.
Exxon,2017-1,"""As we proceed in ensuring the new administration has the leaders it needs to implement our nation's foreign policy going forward, I have great confidence Rex Tillerson will serve the United States well,"" Senator Bob Corker, the Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said."

Exxon,2017-1,"WASHINGTON, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Two senior U.S. lawmakers unveiled legislative plans on Monday to scrap a rule devised under the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law requiring publicly-traded mining, oil and gas companies to disclose payments they make to foreign governments."
Exxon,2017-1,"Michigan Republican Bill Huizenga, who chairs the House of Representatives Financial Services subcommittee on capital markets, and Oklahoma Republican James Inhofe, chairman of the Senate Environment Committee, took aim at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's so-called ""resource extraction"" rule, saying it makes it harder for U.S. energy companies to compete."
Exxon,2017-1,"They introduced measures to ax the rule using the Congressional Review Act, which allows Congress to stop recently adopted regulations through a simple majority vote. Republicans this week are expected to undo five Obama-era regulations. The full Republican-led House on Wednesday will vote to kill all the regulations and then send them to the Senate, also controlled by Republicans. [nL1N1FK1KL]"
Exxon,2017-1,The SEC rule is championed by human rights organizations who say disclosure of payments to foreign governments by companies like Exxon Mobil Corp and Chevron helps fight corruption.
Exxon,2017-1,"""There is absolutely no benefit to nullifying this common sense law unless your objective is to make it easier for corrupt elites to steal money,"" said Isabel Munilla who studies extraction policies for anti-poverty group Oxfam."
Exxon,2017-1,"But the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and other industry groups have long opposed it, saying it hurts U.S. companies without providing investors with meaningful, material information."
Exxon,2017-1,"Industry groups successfully beat back the rule a few years ago and the SEC was forced to go back to the drawing board. Then, Oxfam accused the regulator of dragging its feet on a new draft."
Exxon,2017-1,"A federal judge ordered the SEC to fast-track the rule in 2015, and the agency issued a final version last summer set to take effect in 2018."
Exxon,2017-1,"""The SEC continues to propose a resource extraction rule that is overly burdensome, puts U.S. companies at a competitive disadvantage, and fails to provide investors with useful information,"" Huizenga said."
Exxon,2017-1,"The House Financial Services Committee's senior Democrat, Maxine Waters, said killing the rule ""is undoubtedly another conflict of interest on account of Trump and his cronies."""
Exxon,2017-1,"President Donald Trump's Secretary of State nominee Rex Tillerson headed Exxon when it fought the drafting of the rule, Waters said. She added the regulation would identify oil companies with financial ties to countries that have been hostile to the United States, such as Russia."

Exxon,2017-1,"WASHINGTON, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Days before a group of Republican lawmakers were due to discuss their party's controversial proposal to tax all imports, Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T> sent an urgent message to its U.S. dealers - tell the politicians the tax would seriously hurt car buyers."
Exxon,2017-1,"Some of Toyota's 1,500 dealers heeded the call and contacted members of the House of Representatives' tax-writing Ways and Means Committee, urging them to rethink their proposal, according to people familiar with the effort. Imposing a 20 percent tax on imports would force consumers to pay potentially thousands of dollars more for vehicles, they warned."
Exxon,2017-1,The Japanese automaker's mobilization of its army of dealers underscores the growing alarm among some of the world's largest companies that sell imported goods in the United States. They fear a big tax on imports would hurt their sales and profits and put them at a disadvantage to rivals more reliant on U.S.-made products.
Exxon,2017-1,"""Cost is going to go up, as a result demand is going to go down. As a result, we're not going to able to employ as many as people as we do today. That's my biggest fear,"" Toyota's North America CEO Jim Lentz said in an interview."
Exxon,2017-1,"Toyota dealers employ more than 97,000 people in the United States."
Exxon,2017-1,"While companies and industry groups frequently lobby Congress, the threat of an import tax has mobilized an unusually broad swath of firms at home and abroad. That lobbying effort is taking place largely out of the public eye partly to avoid potential conflict with President Donald Trump, who has attacked companies for manufacturing abroad for U.S. consumers."
Exxon,2017-1,"Earlier this month Trump targeted Toyota, threatening to impose a hefty fee on the world's largest automaker if it builds its Corolla cars for the U.S. market at a plant in Mexico."
Exxon,2017-1,"The White House said last week that a border tax is one option under review to pay for a wall with Mexico, although what exactly Trump is planning to do is still not clear. He has pledged to impose a ""big border tax"" on Mexican imports."
Exxon,2017-1,"The plan proposed by House Republicans would cut corporate income tax to 20 percent from 35 percent, exclude export revenue from taxable income and impose the 20 percent tax on imports."
Exxon,2017-1,Companies that rely heavily on imports say a border tax will outweigh the benefit of a lower headline corporate tax.
Exxon,2017-1,"As car dealers are reaching out to members of Congress in their districts, Toyota and other automakers are lobbying lawmakers in states where they have large manufacturing plants and employ thousands of workers."
Exxon,2017-1,"The No. 3 vehicle seller in the United States behind General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co , Toyota imports about 1.2 million vehicles to the U.S. market annually, half of its 2.4 million U.S. sales. It employs 40,000 people directly."
Exxon,2017-1,Toyota and the automakers are not alone in this lobbying effort.
Exxon,2017-1,"Target Corp's chief executive, Brian Cornell, traveled to Washington to meet members of the House Ways and Means Committee. He told them an import tax could impact consumers' ability to buy essential goods, such as baby supplies that are made overseas and imported to the United States, according to a person familiar with the talks. Target spokeswoman Dustee Jenkins confirmed the visit."
Exxon,2017-1,"The largest U.S. electronics retailer, Best Buy , headquartered down the road from Minneapolis-based Target, has circulated a flyer to lawmakers. It cites an analyst forecast that a 20 percent tax would wipe out the company's projected annual net income of $1 billion and turn it into a $2 billion loss."
Exxon,2017-1,"The flyer, a copy of which was seen by Reuters, argues that foreign Internet sellers like China's Alibaba.com would be able to avoid the tax by making sales online and shipping to U.S. consumers directly, ""undercutting U.S. businesses."""
Exxon,2017-1,"Company officials have been handing out the flyer to lawmakers and their staff on Capitol Hill, Best Buy spokesman Jeff Shelman confirmed."
Exxon,2017-1,"Constellation Brands , which brews Corona and Modelo in Mexico, has been pushing lawmakers to exempt products like Mexican beer in any border tax ""because it's inherently a Mexican product,"" CEO Rob Sands said on an earnings call."

Exxon,2017-1,"WASHINGTON, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Republicans on Monday continued their drive to loosen U.S. regulation, taking the first step to kill five Obama-era rules on corruption, the environment, labor and guns under the virtually untested Congressional Review Act."
Exxon,2017-1,"The House Rules Committee sent to the full chamber three regulations enacted under former President Barack Obama, a Democrat, to ax."
Exxon,2017-1,"They were the Stream Protection Rule, the Securities and Exchange Commission's ""resource extraction rule,"" and one on gun buying."
Exxon,2017-1,"Republicans put as much urgency on limiting what they consider over-regulation that stifles economic growth as they do on overhauling the tax code and dismantling the Affordable Care Act, according to House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy."
Exxon,2017-1,This is the first time the Republican-led House of Representatives has targeted specific rules since convening on Jan. 3. Earlier this month it passed bills to limit regulatory agencies and Republican President Donald Trump is cutting regulation through executive orders. [nL1N1FK0UQ]
Exxon,2017-1,"Under the law, Congress can use simple majority votes to stop recent regulations in their tracks. Agencies cannot create a new rule to replace any part of an overturned regulation. Timing in the law means any rules enacted in the final months of Obama's administration are eligible for axing."
Exxon,2017-1,"The law has been used effectively only once, in 2001. Both sides consider this week a test of its powers."
Exxon,2017-1,"On Tuesday the Rules Committee will send two more regulations to the full chamber, which is expected to vote to kill all five on Wednesday and then hand them off to the Senate. [nL1N1FF0QX]"
Exxon,2017-1,"Senate Republicans on Monday prepared to act quickly after the House vote, with Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Environment Committee Chairman James Inhofe introducing companion measures on the stream and extraction rules."
Exxon,2017-1,"The Interior Department took years to craft the stream rule, hoping to prevent coal-mining waste from contaminating water sources in areas near mountain-top removal mining sites. Critics say it is unnecessary and goes too far, wiping out jobs and usurping state rights."
Exxon,2017-1,"The extraction rule is required in the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law, but was only approved six years later this summer. It requires companies such as Exxon Mobil Corp to state publicly how much they pay governments in taxes and other fees. Opponents say it hurts U.S. energy companies, while human rights groups argue it reduces corruption. [nL1N1FK0Z1]"
Exxon,2017-1,"Meanwhile, the gun rule requires extra scrutiny of purchasers who receive Social Security benefits and also have a history of mental illness."
Exxon,2017-1,"Liberal groups are outraged by the rollbacks, but their traditional allies, Democratic lawmakers, have limited means to stop them in the Republican-dominated Congress."
Exxon,2017-1,"Those on the Rules Committee said important protections were being rushed to the chopping block and pleaded for hearings on the regulations, to no avail."
Exxon,2017-1,"This week House Democrats and activists are planning to rally the public, hoping to persuade Republicans to vote no.

Exxon,2017-1,"WASHINGTON, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Two senior U.S. lawmakers unveiled legislative plans on Monday to scrap a rule devised under the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law requiring publicly-traded mining, oil and gas companies to disclose payments they make to foreign governments."
Exxon,2017-1,"Michigan Republican Bill Huizenga, who chairs the House of Representatives Financial Services subcommittee on capital markets, and Oklahoma Republican James Inhofe, chairman of the Senate Environment Committee, took aim at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's so-called ""resource extraction"" rule, saying it makes it harder for U.S. energy companies to compete."
Exxon,2017-1,"They introduced measures to ax the rule using the Congressional Review Act, which allows Congress to stop recently adopted regulations through a simple majority vote. Republicans this week are expected to undo five Obama-era regulations. The full Republican-led House on Wednesday will vote to kill all the regulations and then send them to the Senate, also controlled by Republicans. [nL1N1FK1KL]"
Exxon,2017-1,The SEC rule is championed by human rights organizations who say disclosure of payments to foreign governments by companies like Exxon Mobil Corp and Chevron helps fight corruption.
Exxon,2017-1,"""There is absolutely no benefit to nullifying this common sense law unless your objective is to make it easier for corrupt elites to steal money,"" said Isabel Munilla who studies extraction policies for anti-poverty group Oxfam."
Exxon,2017-1,"But the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and other industry groups have long opposed it, saying it hurts U.S. companies without providing investors with meaningful, material information."
Exxon,2017-1,"Industry groups successfully beat back the rule a few years ago and the SEC was forced to go back to the drawing board. Then, Oxfam accused the regulator of dragging its feet on a new draft."
Exxon,2017-1,"A federal judge ordered the SEC to fast-track the rule in 2015, and the agency issued a final version last summer set to take effect in 2018."
Exxon,2017-1,"""The SEC continues to propose a resource extraction rule that is overly burdensome, puts U.S. companies at a competitive disadvantage, and fails to provide investors with useful information,"" Huizenga said."
Exxon,2017-1,"The House Financial Services Committee's senior Democrat, Maxine Waters, said killing the rule ""is undoubtedly another conflict of interest on account of Trump and his cronies."""
Exxon,2017-1,"President Donald Trump's Secretary of State nominee Rex Tillerson headed Exxon when it fought the drafting of the rule, Waters said. She added the regulation would identify oil companies with financial ties to countries that have been hostile to the United States, such as Russia."

Exxon,2017-1,"BEIRUT, Jan 26 (Reuters) - Lebanon relaunched its first oil and gas exploration and production licensing round after a three-year delay, its energy minister said on Thursday, kick-starting the development of a hydrocarbon industry stalled by national political paralysis."
Exxon,2017-1,"Lebanon has opened five offshore blocks (1,4,8,9 and 10) for bidding in a first licensing round, Minister of Energy and Water Cesar Abou Khalil told a news conference."
Exxon,2017-1,"Lebanon, along with Cyprus, Israel and Egypt, sits on the Levant Basin in the eastern Mediterranean where new gas fields have been discovered since 2009."
Exxon,2017-1,"In 2013, 46 companies qualified to take part in bidding for oil and gas tenders in Lebanon, 12 of them as operators, including Chevron , Total and Exxon Mobil ."
Exxon,2017-1,"But political paralysis, which left Lebanon without a president for more than two years, meant the licensing process was put on hold."
Exxon,2017-1,"Abou Khalil said these companies will remain qualified to bid and a second pre-qualification round for any more companies interested in exploration and production contracts would run between Feb. 2 and March 31. The qualifying companies will be announced on April 13, he said."
Exxon,2017-1,Pre-qualified companies will submit their bids to the Lebanese Petroleum Administration on Sept. 15 where they will be considered for a month before being passed to the energy minister and then to the cabinet for final approval.
Exxon,2017-1,Three of the five blocks opened for bidding border Israeli waters. Lebanon considers Israel an enemy state and has an unresolved maritime border dispute with it over a triangular area of sea around 860 sq km that extends along the edge of the three blocks.
Exxon,2017-1,"Abou Khalil said the choice of blocks offered in the first licensing round was dictated by the likelihood of finding exploitable quantities of oil and gas, and by the need to protect Lebanon's resources along its border."

Exxon,2017-1,"SINGAPORE, Jan 26 (Reuters) - Australia's plans for a huge increase in its production of liquefied natural gas are being dealt a big blow by a series of production delays, as energy companies struggle with technical problems and cost overruns."
Exxon,2017-1,"The country is still likely to become the world's biggest LNG exporter, dispatching about 85 million tonnes a year by the end of the decade, up from 30.7 million tonnes in 2015 and 45.1 million tonnes last year. But the pace of growth is much slower than expected because of snafus and higher-than-expected costs that have delayed plans to start or increase LNG exports from four megaprojects, Gorgon, Ichthys, Prelude and Wheatstone, all along or off the coast of northwest Australia."
Exxon,2017-1,"Now at least three of them, Shell's Prelude floating LNG production vessel, Inpex's <1605.T> Ichtys project, and the expansion of Chevron's Gorgon operation, won't begin exporting until 2018 or even later, rather than 2017 as previously planned, according to several sources with knowledge of the matter."
Exxon,2017-1,"Chevron, Shell, and Inpex would not comment on potential delays."
Exxon,2017-1,"It should all be a boon for other suppliers of LNG to Asian buyers, such as utilities in the region. These suppliers can also benefit from higher prices."
Exxon,2017-1,"Traders said that the beneficiaries include U.S.-based Cheniere Energy with its facility at Sabine Pass in the Gulf of Mexico, and global energy giant Exxon Mobil with its production in Papua New Guinea."
Exxon,2017-1,"Making matters even worse, the producers in Australia are having to go to their rivals to fulfil contracts."
Exxon,2017-1,"""The Australian producers have supply commitments, so when there's production delays they have to buy these supplies from competitors in the spot market,"" said an LNG trader involved in such deals who was speaking on condition of anonymity."

Exxon,2017-1,Once completed the four projects will have a combined annual LNG capacity of 36.5 million tonnes. The development costs will total $130 billion.
Exxon,2017-1,"Each one has had to hit the brakes. ""All of Australia's recent wave of LNG projects have had cost and schedule overruns compared to expectations,"" said Saul Kavonic of energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie."
Exxon,2017-1,The projects being built In Australia are amongst the biggest and technically most challenging ever attempted in the industry. One problem the LNG project developers have pointed to in explaining production delays is that they struggle to find enough qualified and experienced staff.
Exxon,2017-1,"""There aren't many experts and teams with relevant experience who can lead such huge developments. That's contributed to some of the delays,"" said on engineer who has worked on developing offshore oil and gas projects."
Exxon,2017-1,"At the $35 billion Ichthys project, engineering firm CIMIC this week pulled out of its contract to build the facility's power station, citing cost overruns."
Exxon,2017-1,"Ichthys, which includes a stationary rig and a floating production vessel, was due to start operations between July and September this year, but the power station problem will almost certainly cause more delays and costs. [nL4N1FF2PN]"
Exxon,2017-1,"""Any delays to the delivery of the project may have very serious implications for Inpex. Low oil prices have already impacted the financial position of the company,"" said Tom O'Sullivan, managing director of energy consultancy Mathyos Japan."
Exxon,2017-1,"At Gorgon, which has cost $55 billion to develop and which started operations last year, there are problems in bringing expanded production online. [nL4N1EU1RG]"
Exxon,2017-1,"Two sources with knowledge of the matter said that crews working on the expansion phase had to be shifted to repair operational facilities, delaying full completion. [nL4N1FA34E]"
Exxon,2017-1,"Delays are also expected at Shell's Prelude. The production vessel, the world's biggest ship at half-a-kilometre in length, is currently being built in South Korea."
Exxon,2017-1,"Scheduled to generate cash flow by 2018, one source with the shipyard and another with one of Prelude's LNG buyers said it was unlikely that Prelude would produce any gas before late 2018, maybe even 2019."
Exxon,2017-1,Potential delays and cost overruns are likely to have a big impact on returns on investment.
Exxon,2017-1,"""On average, Australia's recent LNG projects were forecast to achieve an internal rate of return (IRR) of around 13 percent,"" Wood Mackenzie's Kavonic said. ""They are now only forecast to realise below 8 percent,"""
Exxon,2017-1,"Neil Beveridge, oil and gas analyst at AB Bernstein in Hong Kong, said that ""the returns of many of the projects are going to be low and probably lower than the cost of capital in the current oil price environment."""
Exxon,2017-1,"Beyond adding to already huge costs for its developers, the delays will have a strong market impact."
Exxon,2017-1,"For 2017, they mean a tighter market than initially expected, and prices have already reacted. The Asian spot LNG price almost doubled between June last year and January 2017 to more than $9 per million British thermal units (mmBtu), its highest since 2014. [nL4N1FA34E]"
Exxon,2017-1,"The delays are happening just as new supplies are coming on stream elsewhere. Seven U.S. export projects are currently approved, with a potential to reach 50 million tonnes a year by the early 2020s."
Exxon,2017-1,"""Australian LNG projects will be competing with U.S. projects. Cost efficiency is going to be critical. And here, the Australians have to put in some serious effort,"" Kavonic said."

Exxon,2017-1,"DAR ES SALAAM, Jan 24 (Reuters) - Tanzania hopes to reach an agreement with international oil companies in 2018 paving the way for the construction of a liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant, part of a bigger plan for a new export terminal, a senior official said on Tuesday."
Exxon,2017-1,The planned new infrastructure will enable Tanzania to export some of the huge offshore gas reserves discovered in recent years in a region that has turned into a hydrocarbon exploration hotspot.
Exxon,2017-1,"BG Group - recently acquired by Royal Dutch Shell -, together with Statoil , Exxon Mobil and Ophir Energy , plan to build a $30 billion onshore LNG export terminal in partnership with the state-run Tanzania Petroleum Development Corporation (TPDC)."
Exxon,2017-1,But a final investment decision has been held up by government delays in finalising issues relating to the acquisition of land at the site and establishing a legal framework for the nascent hydrocarbon industry.
Exxon,2017-1,"As a first step, the Tanzanian government and oil companies must work out a ""host government agreement"" setting out terms on which the foreign investors will build and run the project."
Exxon,2017-1,"""Discussions for a host government agreement started in September 2016 and we expect the negotiations to last for about one and a half years,"" Kapuulya Musomba, acting managing director of TPDC, told Reuters in an interview."
Exxon,2017-1,"""Conclusion of these talks will determine when the international oil companies will actually put in money for construction of the LNG."""
Exxon,2017-1,"Oil majors are expected to push for government guarantees of stable fiscal, regulatory and commercial terms before they invest, analysts said."
Exxon,2017-1,"Oystein Michelsen, Statoil's Tanzania country manager, said in November a final investment decision on the LNG export terminal will not be made for at least five years and possibly much longer. [nL4N1DH4D6]"
Exxon,2017-1,"It would take another five years after that decision to build the plant, he said."
Exxon,2017-1,The government has said it is keen to promote the LNG project but has said little about the timeline.
Exxon,2017-1,"Tanzanian President John Magufuli ordered officials in August to speed up work on the planned LNG plant, saying it had taken too long to start the project."
Exxon,2017-1,"The government said it has acquired more than 2,000 hectares (5,000 acres) of land for the construction of the planned two-train LNG terminal at Likong'o village in the southern Tanzanian town of Lindi close to large offshore natural gas discoveries."
Exxon,2017-1,The country's central bank believes just starting work on the plant would add another 2 percentage points to annual economic growth of around 7 percent.
Exxon,2017-1,"Tanzania discovered an additional 2.17 trillion cubic feet of gas deposits in February, according to local media, raising its total estimated recoverable reserves to more than 57 trillion cubic feet. [nL8N16427G]"

Exxon,2017-1,"WASHINGTON, Jan 23 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's choice for secretary of state, former Exxon Mobil Corp Chairman Rex Tillerson, narrowly won approval from a Senate committee on Monday, but is expected to be confirmed by the full Senate."
Exxon,2017-1,"The Senate Foreign Relations Committee voted 11-10 to approve Tillerson, with every Republican backing the former oil executive and every Democrat opposing him."
Exxon,2017-1,"His approval by the panel, a victory for Trump, had been in doubt until earlier on Monday, when Senator Marco Rubio, a committee member who had been Tillerson's most vocal Republican critic, said he would back the nominee. [nL1N1FD173]"
Exxon,2017-1,"Tillerson's confirmation by the 100-member Senate, where Republicans hold 52 seats, is not expected before next week. Democrats want more time to debate and the chamber may not be in session all this week."
Exxon,2017-1,"Rubio's backing had been in doubt after his tough questioning during Tillerson's confirmation hearing, focusing on issues including concerns about Tillerson's support for human rights. Rubio ultimately decided he would approve the nominee in deference to Trump, as well as to fill a critical top job."
Exxon,2017-1,"Democrats said they voted against Tillerson over fears he might lift sanctions on Russia, where he did business for years, questions about his views on human rights and his refusal to recuse himself from matters related to his former employer during his entire term as the top U.S. diplomat."
Exxon,2017-1,Tillerson pledged to recuse himself only for the year required by law.
Exxon,2017-1,"Amid Democratic anger over allegations that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election, Tillerson also raised committee hackles by saying he did not know Exxon Mobil lobbied against sanctions on Russia while he was running the company."
Exxon,2017-1,"Senator Ben Cardin, the committee's top Democrat, said Tillerson's ""business orientation"" and responses at his hearing ""could compromise his ability as secretary of state to forcefully promote the values and ideals that have defined our country and our leading role in the world for more than 200 years."""
Exxon,2017-1,"The Senate confirmed only two of Trump's Cabinet nominees on Friday, his Inauguration Day, a relatively low number among recent presidencies. [nL1N1FA1ZO]"
Exxon,2017-1,"Democrats have been unable to block any of his choices because they changed Senate rules in 2013 to allow nominees to be confirmed with just a majority, not 60 votes. Instead, they have used Senate rules to slow the confirmation of nominees they say hold extreme views, are unqualified or have not completed ethics disclosures."

Exxon,2017-1,"PARIS, Jan 19 (Reuters) - France's Total is preparing to drill for gas off Cyprus, close to ENI's huge Zohr discovery off the Egyptian coast which in 2015 renewed interest among oil majors for exploration in the Mediterranean."

Exxon,2017-1,"Last July SABIC, one of the world's largest petrochemicals groups, said it was studying whether to build a petrochemical complex on the U.S. Gulf Coast with an Exxon affiliate. The project would supply ethylene to other units making derivatives. [nL8N1AB35F]"
Exxon,2017-1,SABIC chief executive Yousef al-Benyan told Reuters on Thursday that he would travel to the United States at the end of this month to look at the proposed project.
Exxon,2017-1,"""The outlook is still very positive...We will be working with Exxon Mobil to come up with a very strong competitive structure of this project."
Exxon,2017-1,"""We are very excited about current developments with Exxon Mobil, not only the cracker but also in the downstream type of projects we are going to do."""
Exxon,2017-1,"He added that SABIC would probably make an announcement about the ethylene project in the second quarter of this year, though this was not certain."
Exxon,2017-1,SABIC is keen to invest abroad to diversify its risks and improve its access to foreign markets. Benyan said the company was looking to make other U.S. investments worth between $2.5 billion and $3 billion.

Exxon,2017-1,"SEOUL, Jan 19 (Reuters) - Lotte Chemical Corp <011170.KS> is looking into acquiring troubled Singapore petrochemical company Jurong Aromatics Corp, as the South Korean company continues to push for growth."
Exxon,2017-1,"JAC went into receivership in September 2015, struggling with debt problems in the face of a global commodity rout at that time."
Exxon,2017-1,It was also forced to halt production for around 18 months until last summer to fix a technical issue at an integrated refining-petrochemical complex in Singapore that had cost around $2.4 billion to build. [nL4N1A02J6]
Exxon,2017-1,Lotte Chemical <011170.KS> said on Thursday in a filing to the stock exchange in South Korea that it had submitted a letter of intent earlier this month on the possible acquisition of JAC and that it had been shortlisted on Jan. 10.
Exxon,2017-1,"""We are studying whether it would be worth acquiring JAC with the letter of intent,"" said Jung Seung-han, a Lotte Chemical spokesman, adding that it was too early to give other details or put a possible value on the deal."
Exxon,2017-1,"An industry source in Singapore said that a bidding process had started for JAC, but declined to give details or name companies involved. He did not want to be identified as he was not permitted to speak with media."
Exxon,2017-1,"JAC's facilities include a 100,000-barrel per day condensate splitter and petrochemical units, which produce paraxylene, a raw material for textiles and plastic bottles that are often churned out in China."
Exxon,2017-1,"An acquisition would also potentially boost the supply of petrochemical feedstock naphtha to Lotte Chemical, as well as consolidating its position as one of the largest condensate buyers in Asia, said a Singapore-based trader."
Exxon,2017-1,"Lotte Chemical currently operates two naphtha cracking centers in the South Korean cities of Yeosu and Daesan, with a combined ethylene output of 2.1 million tonnes per year (tpy)."
Exxon,2017-1,"The company also co-owns a 130,000-bpd condensate splitter with Hyundai Oilbank Co that started operations last year. [nL4N1DG1PG]"

Exxon,2017-1,{{20170119T070002.425+0000}}Big Oil back on the acquisition trail as outlook brightens* More than $30 bln of deals signed since late November
Exxon,2017-1,"LONDON, Jan 19 (Reuters) - The world's top oil companies are back in acquisition mode, targeting smaller exploration and development firms to boost oil and gas reserves rather than the mega-mergers that followed previous slumps in crude prices."
Exxon,2017-1,"Since late November, major oil companies have announced 11 deals worth more than $500 million each with a combined value of $31 billion, the clearest sign yet that oil executives are more confident a recovery is underway."
Exxon,2017-1,"When crude prices collapsed in the second half of 2014, large oil firms slashed spending on exploration and production and offloaded assets to reduce debt so they could cope with lower revenue from oil and gas sales."
Exxon,2017-1,"But with crude reservoirs declining at a rate of 10 percent a year in some cases, major oil companies are now looking to snap up assets to start growing again and there are plenty of smaller firms burdened with debt looking to sell."
Exxon,2017-1,"""You're seeing the majors sharpening their pencils after a long while and actually flipping around from disposals to acquisitions,"" said Tony Durrant, chief executive of British energy firm Premier Oil , which is looking to sell several stakes in its North Sea operations. [nL8N15G1ET]"
Exxon,2017-1,"Total acquisitions of oil and gas fields, known as upstream assets, tripled to $31 billion in December from a month earlier, when the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed to cut output for the first time in eight years, according to data from consultancy Energy Market Square."
Exxon,2017-1,"BP announced a string of investments in the last two months of 2016, including a $1 billion partnership with Dallas-based Kosmos Energy in Mauritania and Senegal in West Africa, as well as acquisitions in Abu Dhabi and Azerbaijan."
Exxon,2017-1,The British company also spent $375 million on a 10 percent stake in Eni's giant Zohr gas field in Egypt while Russian oil giant Rosneft bought 30 percent stake of the same field for $1.575 billion. [nL5N1E722C]
Exxon,2017-1,France's Total and Norway's Statoil bought into Brazil's lucrative sub-salt deepwater oil fields while ExxonMobil Corp bought assets in Papua New Guinea to meet growing Asian demand for liquefied natural gas. [nL1N1EG1S4] [nL4N1A758E]
Exxon,2017-1,The trend continued in January with Total boosting its stake in Uganda's Lake Albert oil project by snapping up most of Tullow Oil's stake for $900 million. [nL5N1EZ4XF]
Exxon,2017-1,"ExxonMobile and Noble Energy also struck deals worth nearly $10 billion combined for a larger slice of the Permian Basin, the largest U.S. oil field. [nL4N1F74E1] [nL1N1F60XV]"
Exxon,2017-1,"While deal making outside the United States almost ground to a halt at the start of 2016, acquisitions in North American shale basins have continued at a steady pace."
Exxon,2017-1,"In the Permian Basin, for example, the time it takes to produce oil and gas after an initial investment is far quicker and cheaper than developing conventional fields over three to five years."
Exxon,2017-1,More deals are likely this year as the large overhang of crude oil in the world that has weighed on the market since 2014 continues to clear and oil prices rise.
Exxon,2017-1,"""When you can cut capex (capital spending), two-and-a-half to three years later you see production decline and reserves depleting and you have one choice only and that is going after high quality resource,"" said Sachin Oza, co-manager with Stephen Williams of the Guinness Global Oil and Gas Exploration Trust."
Exxon,2017-1,"""If you've not spent any time filling your hopper with these opportunities that take five years to build up, there is only one choice: you have to buy them,"" said Oza."
Exxon,2017-1,The Guinness Trust is a fund that invests in firms in the early stages of exploration or development of energy resources which it believes will attract investment from oil majors.
Exxon,2017-1,"Investors reckon large firms will focus on underdeveloped basins in east and west Africa, Romania and Albania, as well as nascent Latin American reserves in places such as Colombia, all areas where the growth potential is seen as greater than in established regions such as North America and the North Sea."
Exxon,2017-1,"While slides in oil prices typically unleash a wave of takeovers, companies emerging from the current downturn are generally shunning outright acquisitions and instead looking at specific deals for specific fields."
Exxon,2017-1,"After a prolonged period of low oil prices in the late 1990s Exxon merged with Mobil, Total merged with Elf Aquitaine and Petrofina, Chevron bought Texaco, BP snapped up Amoco and ARCO and Conoco and Philips merged."
Exxon,2017-1,"This time round, the only stand-out acquisition has been Royal Dutch Shell's takeover of BG, which was announced in April 2015 and completed in February a year later for $53 billion. [nL8N15R388]"
Exxon,2017-1,"As large oil firms are wary of increasing their debt burden at this point, investors say corporate acquisitions are likely to be limited in numbers and scope but oil field assets are very much in the crosshairs."
Exxon,2017-1,"Oil majors are opting for joint ventures to develop specific fields in complex deals, such as share swaps or deferred payments, to lower their risk and limit the amount they need to spend upfront following two years of budget cuts."
Exxon,2017-1,"""The international (ex-U.S.) asset market is a buyer's market, as sellers continue in balance sheet preservation mode,"" said Charles Whall, energy portfolio manager at Investec Asset Management."
Exxon,2017-1,"""European majors, which already have large dividend commitments, are unwilling to use equity for assets without immediate cash flow ... Most of these asset deals are structured to minimise the debt impact in the near term,"" he said."
Exxon,2017-1,"Such deals also mean the sellers can retain a stake in the assets as their value rises with oil prices, said Oza and Williams at the Guinness Trust."
Exxon,2017-1,Analysts say for much of 2015 and 2016 there was subdued activity because buyers and sellers were too far apart on price.
Exxon,2017-1,Buyers hunting for bargain-basement deals were frustrated by sellers holding out for better terms but as oil prices have started to stabilise there has been more convergence.
Exxon,2017-1,"According to Martijn Rats, equity analyst at Morgan Stanley, most of the deals announced in recent months have been based on a long-term oil price of about $60 a barrel to $65 a barrel."
Exxon,2017-1,"While that is significantly lower than before the collapse in oil prices from a 2014 peak of $115 a barrel, it is still above current long-term oil price forecasts, Rats said."

Exxon,2017-1,"BUT WHAT ABOUT THE BAD PROMISES, LIKE IMPOSING TARIFFS AND RIPPING UP TRADE AGREEMENTS? AREN'T YOU WORRIED ABOUT A NEW SMOOT-HAWLEY ACT?"
Exxon,2017-1,"Yeah, that's sort of a drag. But remember, that law - which raised import duties on 890 products in 1930, helping to precipitate the Great Depression - was put forward by Congressman Willis Hawley and Senator Reed Smoot. There is no appetite in today's Republican Party-controlled House of Representatives or Senate to do anything remotely like that."
Exxon,2017-1,"THE ONLY CABINET MEMBERS I'VE EVER SEEN AT DAVOS ARE GARY COHN, WHO WAS A REGULAR AS PRESIDENT OF GOLDMAN SACHS, AND FORMER EXXON MOBIL BOSS REX TILLERSON. SHOULD THAT WORRY ME?"
Exxon,2017-1,"No. Trump has put lots of experienced people in charge, even if they aren't veterans of Salesforce.com founder Marc Benioff's famous Davos parties. Many of them, as you may have seen from recent testimonies to Congress, aren't totally aligned with the president-elect's more radical views. One thing for sure is that most of them hail from the business and financial communities, so won't be bashing us as much as the last president's people did."
Exxon,2017-1,"WHAT ABOUT MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS? IF YOU DO DEALS THAT CUT AMERICAN JOBS, WON'T TRUMP PILLORY YOU?"
Exxon,2017-1,"He might, but think of it this way: it gives us CEOs a once-in-a-tenure excuse to do ""transformative"" deals that allow us to expand into other industries. For some of us, with businesses that look under threat from technological change, obsolescence or malaise by finicky millennial, this could be a life saver."
Exxon,2017-1,AREN'T YOU WORRIED HE WILL GO TO WAR WITH CHINA?
Exxon,2017-1,Donald Trump builds hotels and golf courses. He's the last guy in the world who will want to get into a fight over rocky outcroppings or artificial islands in the South China Sea incapable of supporting either.
Exxon,2017-1,"What about it? Trump has a chance of improving relations with Vladimir Putin, maybe by giving the Russian president a big role in sorting out the Middle East, where the absence of American leadership has created a vacuum. At best, Putin sends around some compromising photos."

Exxon,2017-1,"LONDON, Jan 18 (Reuters) - Oil and gas discoveries around the world dropped last year to their lowest since the 1940s after companies sharply cut back in their search for new resources amid falling oil prices."
Exxon,2017-1,"The decline in discoveries means companies such as Exxon Mobil and Royal Dutch Shell will struggle to offset the natural depletion of existing fields, reinforcing forecasts of a supply shortage by the end of the decade."
Exxon,2017-1,"Total oil and gas resources found in 2016 reached just more than 6 billion barrels of oil equivalent (boe), said Sona Mlada, senior analyst at Oslo-based consultancy Rystad Energy."
Exxon,2017-1,The numbers do not include North American shale resources which have been a key driver in supply growth in recent years.
Exxon,2017-1,"Offshore liquid discoveries, where most major new fields have been found in recent decades, reached 2.3 billion boe last year, 90 percent below 2010 levels."
Exxon,2017-1,"As a result, companies were able on average to replace only 10 percent of their oil and liquid gas reserves last year, compared with a reserve replacement ratio of 30 percent in 2013."
Exxon,2017-1,"""The lack of discovered volumes in 2016 will not have an immediate impact on the global oil supply in the short-term, given the lead time it takes from the discovery to start-up of a field's production,"" Mlada said."

Exxon,2017-1,"MIDLAND, Texas, Jan 17 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp said on Tuesday it will pay up to $6.6 billion to double its holdings in the Permian Basin of west Texas and New Mexico, the largest oil field in the United States."
Exxon,2017-1,"The deal, Exxon's biggest since its 2009 buyout of XTO Energy, is the latest by oil producers across the Permian since last summer, with technological improvements and rangebound oil prices fueling the buyouts."
Exxon,2017-1,"Exxon is exchanging an initial $5.6 billion in stock for leases covering roughly 275,000 acres from the Bass family of Fort Worth, Texas. Additional payments of up to $1 billion will start in 2020, depending on how the acreage performs, Exxon said in a statement."
Exxon,2017-1,"Most of the wells to be drilled on the land should provide ""attractive returns"" with oil prices at or above $40 per barrel, Exxon spokeswoman Suann Guthrie said."
Exxon,2017-1,"Much of the Permian's oil can be pumped at current prices of about $53 per barrel, whereas the economics of other large U.S. shale fields require a price of $60 per barrel or more."

Exxon,2017-1,"The Permian land, which Exxon estimates holds 3.4 billion barrels of oil retrievable with current technology, produces about 18,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd), most of which is crude."

Exxon,2017-1,"Much of the Permian's oil can be pumped at current prices of about $53 per barrel, whereas the economics of other large U.S. shale fields require a price of $60 per barrel or more."

Exxon,2017-1,"MOSCOW, Jan 17 (Reuters) - Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Tuesday that Moscow was ready to talk to U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's new administration about nuclear weapons and Syria, saying the two countries could together solve many of the world's problems."
Exxon,2017-1,"Lavrov, speaking days before Trump's inauguration, used an annual news conference to flag potential areas of cooperation and to belittle what he described as malicious attempts to link Trump to Russia in a negative light."
Exxon,2017-1,"Trump, who has praised President Vladimir Putin, has signalled he wants to improve strained ties with Russia despite U.S. intelligence agencies alleging the Kremlin chief ordered a cyber campaign to help him beat rival Hillary Clinton to the White House. [nL1N1EW0ZW]"
Exxon,2017-1,"Russia denies it tried to sway the U.S. election by hacking or other means. It has also dismissed as a fabrication a dossier written by a former officer in Britain's Secret Intelligence Service, MI6, which suggested Moscow had collected compromising information about Trump. [nL1N1F10JA] [nL5N1F26LD]"
Exxon,2017-1,"Lavrov dismissed the dossier's author, Christopher Steele, as ""a fugitive charlatan from MI6"" and said the dossier looked like part of a campaign to cause problems for Trump and his allies. Putin on Tuesday called the same dossier a hoax."
Exxon,2017-1,"While cautioning that the new U.S. administration would need to settle in before wider conclusions could be drawn, Lavrov signalled he was encouraged by the tenor of the Trump team's statements so far which he said suggested it would be possible to have a pragmatic relationship."
Exxon,2017-1,"""Trump has a particular set of views which differ a lot from his predecessor,"" said Lavrov, who accused the Obama administration of wrecking cooperation across a swath of areas and of trying to recruit Russian diplomats as agents."
Exxon,2017-1,"""By concentrating on a pragmatic search for mutual interests we can solve a lot of problems."""
Exxon,2017-1,"He said Syria was one of the most promising areas for cooperation, saying the Kremlin had welcomed Trump's statement that he wanted to make fighting global terrorism a priority."
Exxon,2017-1,"""What we hear from Donald Trump (on Syria) and his team speaks to how they have a different approach (to Obama) and won't resort to double standards,"" said Lavrov."
Exxon,2017-1,"On Syria, Lavrov said representatives from the new U.S. administration had been invited to take part in peace talks slated for Jan. 23 in Kazakhstan."
Exxon,2017-1,"He hoped U.S. officials would attend, he said, as that would be the first opportunity for Moscow and Washington to start talking about closer Syria cooperation."
Exxon,2017-1,"Moscow backs President Bashar al-Assad in the Syria conflict while Washington supports rebels opposing him, but both have a common enemy in Islamic State militants."
Exxon,2017-1,"Lavrov questioned however whether Trump, in an interview he gave to The Times of London, had really suggested he would be ready to drop U.S. sanctions on Moscow in exchange for nuclear arms cuts saying his own reading of the interview had not suggested any linkage between the two issues. [nL5N1F50VI]"
Exxon,2017-1,But he said Moscow wanted to start talks with the United States on nuclear weapons and on the balance of military power between the two former Cold War foes anyway.
Exxon,2017-1,"""It's one of key themes between Russia and the United States. I am convinced we will be able to restart a dialogue on strategic stability with Washington that was destroyed along with everything else by the Obama administration."""
Exxon,2017-1,"Such talks could cover hypersonic weapons, the U.S. anti-missile shield in Europe, space weapons, and what he said was the U.S. refusal to ratify a ban on nuclear testing. Trump has called for a nuclear weapons build-up."
Exxon,2017-1,"Some commentators have said Senate hearings for some of Trump's picks show they will be tough on Russia. But Lavrov said he had been encouraged by Rex Tillerson, the incoming Secretary of State, whom he cited as saying Moscow's behaviour was not unpredictable."
Exxon,2017-1,"""(That) means that we are dealing with people who won't get involved in moralising, but will try to understand their partner's interests,"" Lavrov said."
Exxon,2017-1,Tillerson had extensive dealings with Russia when he was the head of Exxon Mobil oil company.

Exxon,2017-1,"Lawyers for the teenagers, who sued the federal government claiming it violated their constitutional rights by causing global warming, were scheduled to depose Tillerson, the former chief executive of Exxon Mobil , in his capacity as a board member of the American Petroleum Institute, a trade group."
Exxon,2017-1,The lawyers planned to ask Tillerson when he first learned of the impact the burning of fossil fuels was having on the Earth's atmosphere.

Exxon,2017-1,{{20170111T201622.896+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-Tillerson misses chance to overcome Putin problem(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.)
Exxon,2017-1,"NEW YORK, Jan 11 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Rex Tillerson has plenty of the right qualifications to become U.S. secretary of state. That was obvious from the first part of the Senate's hearing on his nomination on Wednesday. Mealy-mouthed answers on sanctions against Russia, though, betrayed his decades at Exxon Mobil . It's a flashpoint even for some Republicans."
Exxon,2017-1,"Wide knowledge of the world, a stated belief in facts and logic, recognition of America's vulnerability to cyber attacks, acceptance of climate change and his own clean severing of financial ties to the $355 billion Exxon are all strong points in Tillerson's favor. He has clearly done the requisite rounds visiting senators, too."
Exxon,2017-1,"Yet he's known for relationships he developed in Russia, including a personal one with President Vladimir Putin. With the U.S. intelligence services confident that Russia hacked American institutions and alleged Russian entanglements a weak spot for President-elect Donald Trump, Tillerson needs to persuade the Senate's foreign-relations committee that he wouldn't be soft on Putin."
Exxon,2017-1,"It was nonetheless posturing for Senator Marco Rubio to ask Tillerson to call the Russian president a war criminal. The former Exxon boss responded, with reason, that he didn't have the information to reach that conclusion, partly because he hasn't had any classified briefings. And the nominee robustly criticized Russia's annexation of Crimea."
Exxon,2017-1,"But he didn't embrace existing or potential future economic sanctions with great enthusiasm. At one point, he sounded more worried about what impact they might have on U.S. business interests than their value as disincentives to behavior that harms the United States - which is considerable because sanctions hit bad actors in the wallet, where it hurts. In claiming he and Exxon hadn't lobbied against sanctions in the past, Tillerson was artful with the facts."
Exxon,2017-1,"Moreover, in talking about Exxon's dealings in sanctioned countries like Iran, he focused on their strict legality - which, to be fair, isn't in question - rather than alignment with Washington's goals at the time. That's no surprise after a 40-year career at the company, latterly as chief executive. The question, intensified by concerns about Putin's Russia, is whether, even armed with good intentions, he can shake that mindset in the service of broader national interests."
Exxon,2017-1,"- The U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations on Jan. 11 held a hearing on the nomination of Rex Tillerson, former chairman and chief executive of Exxon Mobil, to be secretary of state in Donald Trump's administration."
Exxon,2017-1,"- Tillerson, previously scheduled to retire in March, left the $355 billion oil giant at the end of December after his nomination was announced. He had joined the company in 1975 and was chairman and CEO for a decade."
Exxon,2017-1,"- Earlier in January, the company and Tillerson agreed to sever all ties to comply with government conflict-of-interest requirements. If his appointment is confirmed, the value of more than 2 million deferred Exxon shares that Tillerson would have received over the next 10 years will be transferred to an independently managed trust, the company said in a statement. These were worth about $182 million at the closing price on Jan. 3."

Exxon,2017-1,"WASHINGTON, Jan 8 (Reuters) - Two senior Republican senators urged President-elect Donald Trump to punish Russia in response to U.S. intelligence agencies' conclusion that President Vladimir Putin personally directed efforts aimed at influencing the outcome of the November election."
Exxon,2017-1,"In a joint appearance on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" on Sunday, Republican Senators Lindsey Graham and John McCain said evidence was conclusive that Putin sought to influence the election - a point that Trump has refuted repeatedly by arguing it might be impossible to tell who was responsible."
Exxon,2017-1,"""In a couple weeks, Donald Trump will be the defender of the free world and democracy,"" Graham said. ""You should let everybody know in America, Republicans and Democrats, that you're going to make Russia pay a price for trying to interfere."""
Exxon,2017-1,"Both senators said they remain unsure if they will support Trump's pick for secretary of state, former Exxon Mobil Corp Chairman and CEO Rex Tillerson, who has been criticized for his close ties to Putin. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee is scheduled to hold a hearing on Wednesday to consider Tillerson's nomination. [nL1N1EU1CC]"
Exxon,2017-1,Three U.S. intelligence agencies released a joint report on Friday that concluded that Putin directed efforts to help Trump's electoral chances by discrediting his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. [nL1N1EW0ZW]
Exxon,2017-1,"Hackers penetrated the Democratic National Committee's email server and separately stole emails from John Podesta, who chaired Clinton's campaign. The emails were then posted online and used to embarrass Clinton, including by Trump who frequently used the content as political ammunition."
Exxon,2017-1,"Russia was trying to undermine public faith in the democratic process, damage Clinton, making it harder for her to win and harm her presidency if she did, the unclassified report said."
Exxon,2017-1,"""We need to come to grips with it and get to the bottom of it and overall come up with a strategy in this new form of warfare that can basically harm our economy, harm our elections, harm our national security,"" he said."
Exxon,2017-1,"Trump, whose views on Russia are out of step with his party, has repeatedly dismissed claims that the Russians were trying to help him, arguing that the charges against Russia are the product of his political opponents trying to undermine his victory."
Exxon,2017-1,"On Friday, after receiving his intelligence briefing, Trump did not squarely address whether he was told of the agencies' belief Russia carried out the hacking."
Exxon,2017-1,"Instead, he said: ""Russia, China, other countries, outside groups and people are consistently trying to break through the cyber infrastructure of our governmental institutions, businesses and organizations"" including the DNC."

Exxon,2017-1,"BEIRUT, Jan 5 (Reuters) - Lebanon intends to restart its first oil and gas licensing round after a three-year delay, the energy minister said on Thursday, hoping to kick-start the development of a hydrocarbon industry stalled by national political paralysis."
Exxon,2017-1,"In its first sitting since being formed in December, Lebanon's new cabinet passed two decrees on Wednesday defining the blocks and specifying conditions for production and exploration tenders and contracts. [nL5N1EU2I8]"
Exxon,2017-1,The country's offshore resources could bring a major economic boost to a country whose financial mainstays including tourism have been hit by conflict in the region and Beirut's own political turmoil. But analysts warn of challenges ahead and that investor confidence has been shaken by the setbacks.
Exxon,2017-1,"Lebanon will offer five offshore blocks for exploration and production and is to hold another pre-qualification round for companies interested in bidding, Minister of Energy and Water Cesar Abou Khalil told a news conference."
Exxon,2017-1,"Lebanon, along with Cyprus, Israel and Egypt, sits on the eastern Mediterranean gas field discovered in 2009."
Exxon,2017-1,"The Lebanese government has estimated with a probability of 50 percent it has 96 trillion cubic feet of natural gas reserves and 865 million barrels of oil offshore, but squabbling between parties has prevented the passage of vital laws needed to develop the sector."
Exxon,2017-1,Abou Khalil said if all goes to plan exploration contracts could be signed in nine months and drilling could take place in as little as a year and a half after that because a lot of the necessary mapping and analysis has already been done.
Exxon,2017-1,"With large debt, stagnant growth and bearing the costs of more than 1 million refugees from neighbouring Syria's conflict, Lebanon would benefit from the revenues, job creation and increased economic activity that might accompany a hydrocarbon industry."
Exxon,2017-1,"But analysts urge caution, saying until drills actually break ground, there is no way of telling how much gas or oil there really is and potential economic impact is a complete unknown."
Exxon,2017-1,"Sami Atallah, executive director of the Lebanese Center for Policy Studies, said it could take around seven years before revenues start to flow."
Exxon,2017-1,"""Oil and gas are not the answer,"" he said. ""You don't want it to stall reforms ... to be a disincentive for making changes to the economy."""
Exxon,2017-1,"Industry watchers say Lebanon needs to now produce transparent road maps and regulatory framework for the energy industry. This will boost investor confidence and avoid the accusations of corruption which surround many of Lebanon's public services and industries such as refuse disposal, telecommunications and electricity."
Exxon,2017-1,"""The oil and gas industry can be a curse or a blessing,"" said Diana Kaissy, of the Lebanon Oil and Gas Initiative, a non-governmental organisation promoting transparency and policy development in the hydrocarbon sector."
Exxon,2017-1,"""Lebanon is blessed with the chance of starting straight from the beginning with its oil and gas industry. It can learn from others' mistakes and best practices,"" said Kaissy, who is also part of international transparency campaign group Publish What You Pay."
Exxon,2017-1,"In 2013, 46 companies qualified to take part in bidding for oil and gas tenders, 12 of them as operators, including Chevron , Total and Exxon Mobil ."
Exxon,2017-1,Abou Khalil said he expects these 46 companies to be interested still and that Lebanon will hold another pre-qualification process to increase competition and secure the best deal.
Exxon,2017-1,"Political risk consultant Mona Sukkarieh said investor enthusiasm for the 2013 tender was high, but the delays have undermined this."
Exxon,2017-1,"""It is essential now to do things right, even if not swiftly ... A competitive fiscal regime, in addition to regulatory and fiscal stability are key to gain back investors' confidence,"" said Sukkarieh, co-founder of Beirut-based Middle East Strategic Perspectives (MESP)."
Exxon,2017-1,"Political paralysis left Lebanon without a president for more than two years. The government was unable to tackle long-pending economic and development issues such as garbage disposal, electricity, water and stock market privatisations."
Exxon,2017-1,The deadlock finally came to an end late last year with the election of Michel Aoun as president and the formation of a new government under Prime Minister Saad Hariri.
Exxon,2017-1,"""At times, country risk might be high, but that does not entirely conceal Lebanon's energy potential. Oil and gas companies are used to operating in areas where political and country risks are high,"" Sukkarieh said."
Exxon,2017-1,The government's next task is to agree a tax regime for the nascent hydrocarbon industry.
Exxon,2017-1,"On Wednesday, the cabinet also agreed to form a ministerial committee to discuss the draft tax law. Abou Khalil said the committee would meet on Thursday."

Exxon,2017-1,"AMSTERDAM, Jan 5 (Reuters) - A Dutch court on Thursday upheld a government decision to cap production at the offshore Groningen gas field, a step aimed at easing the risk of earthquakes triggered by drawing gas from Europe's biggest field."
Exxon,2017-1,"The court was responding to requests for a preliminary injunction against the June decision to cap annual output at 24 billion cubic metres (bcm) until Oct. 1, 2021. Critics had sought a deeper cut or halt to production. [L8N19G55U]"
Exxon,2017-1,Output has been cut several times from 53.9 bcm in 2013 as criticism mounted that Dutch authorities had failed to adequately assess the risk to citizens from earthquakes caused by production.
Exxon,2017-1,"The government was formally censured by the country's Safety Board after a magnitude 3.6 quake hit the town of Huizinge in 2012 - larger than had been deemed possible by NAM, the Shell-Exxon joint venture that oversees production."
Exxon,2017-1,"Small quakes remain frequent in Groningen, and while no physical injuries have been reported, buildings across the region have suffered billions of euros in damage because they were never designed to withstand tremors."
Exxon,2017-1,"The Council of State, the court which allows challenges to government decisions, said it saw no reason to alter the decision ahead of a broader case against Groningen gas field production it will consider this spring."
Exxon,2017-1,"Last year's decision capped production at 24 bcm, down from a previous maximum of 27 bcm. It includes the possibility to expand output back up to 30 bcm if unusually cold weather were to jeopardise supplies for households in the Netherlands, Germany and Belgium that depend on Groningen gas for warmth."
Exxon,2017-1,"At the request of the Dutch parliament, the cap is subject to annual review by the government in case technical or other developments make it possible to reduce production more quickly."
Exxon,2017-1,Economic Affairs Minister Henk Kamp has said that production at Groningen is expected to continue winding down as the Netherlands seeks to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and its dependency on fossil fuels.
Exxon,2017-1,"Germany has said it intends to speed up weaning households off natural gas, and Kamp last month announced plans to ban gas heating from all new housing projects in the Netherlands."

Exxon,2017-1,"{{20170104T185948.770+0000}}CORRECTED-Oil business seen in strong position as Trump tackles tax reform(Corrects to remove reference in paragraph 8 to ConocoPhillips, which is not an integrated oil company)"
Exxon,2017-1,"WASHINGTON, Jan 3 (Reuters) - Big Oil could be in a unique position to protect its interests against a Republican proposal to tax imports, given that President-elect Donald Trump's cabinet is studded with oil champions sensitive to the risk of higher gasoline prices."
Exxon,2017-1,"Trump's emerging leadership includes Exxon Mobil Corp Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson as secretary of state, former Texas Governor Rick Perry as energy secretary and Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt as Environmental Protection Agency administrator."
Exxon,2017-1,Trump himself has made no secret of his support for the energy sector.
Exxon,2017-1,"And in Congress, both Republicans and Democrats have close industry ties, including House tax panel chairman Kevin Brady, a Texas Republican whose district takes in the northern Houston suburbs."
Exxon,2017-1,House Republicans want to adopt a sweeping tax reform that would sharply reduce tax rates for corporations and end the taxation of U.S. corporate overseas profits.
Exxon,2017-1,"But a provision known as border adjustability is stirring up controversy. Though intended to boost U.S. manufacturing by exempting export revenues from tax, the provision worries some industries because it would also tax imports. [nL1N1EA1I8]"
Exxon,2017-1,"Because U.S. oil refiners import about half the crude oil they use to make gasoline, diesel and other products, analysts say the change could lead to higher gasoline prices and potentially undermine economic growth."
Exxon,2017-1,"Integrated oil companies such as Exxon, Chevron Corp , BP Plc and Royal Dutch Shell Plc could also be hit, depending on whether they are net importers."
Exxon,2017-1,"But the industry's allies would likely move to soften any rough edges, analysts say."
Exxon,2017-1,"""I don't see this mix of leadership figures in the House, Senate and the White House, doing something that has the effect of raising gasoline prices,"" said Peter Cohn, an energy analyst with Height Securities, a Washington-based investment firm."
Exxon,2017-1,"The danger is that a move to protect the oil refiners could open the door to assistance for other industries, including retailers and automakers, which would also face higher costs if no longer able to deduct the cost of imports from their taxable income."
Exxon,2017-1,Such a knock-on effect could prevent border adjustability from raising an expected $1 trillion in revenues to help pay for lower tax rates over the next decade.
Exxon,2017-1,"""We hope that raising these concerns early in the process will allow members of Congress to consider the issues carefully,"" Chet Thompson, president of the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers trade group, said in a statement."
Exxon,2017-1,"Brady said earlier this month that his committee was sensitive to the impact on specific businesses and ""listening very closely to how we can make sure we smooth that out."" [nL1N1E92CK]"
Exxon,2017-1,"Moreover, some economists dismiss industry worries about higher import costs, saying the dollar's value would rise in response to such sweeping tax changes and ultimately reduce the cost of imports. Currency markets would adjust to higher oil prices by lowering the dollar value of crude, they predict."
Exxon,2017-1,"""This argument by the oil industry is, frankly, all wrong,"" said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, former director of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, who now heads the American Action Forum think tank."
Exxon,2017-1,"""Refiners are going to be basically held harmless. They'll have a lower dollar price of oil. Net cost is the same. And they go about their business. I'm unsympathetic,"" he added."
Exxon,2017-1,"Height Securities' Cohn said Trump and his advisers could look for ways to soften any blow to refiners and their customers: ""Trump doesn't want to have refineries closing on his watch."""
Exxon,2017-1,Oil already benefits from several tax code provisions in place for decades that would be eliminated under the House Republican plan. But they stand to gain more than they will lose.
Exxon,2017-1,"For instance, an existing tax deduction for domestic production lets oil producers shave down their corporate tax rate to 32 percent from the top headline rate of 35 percent. Under the congressional Republicans' plan, the corporate rate would be cut to 20 percent; under Trump's plan, to 15 percent."
Exxon,2017-1,"Similarly, companies that now write off intangible drilling costs or get a tax allowance for asset depletion would be able to immediately expense capital investments."
Exxon,2017-1,"Then there is a tax credit oil companies claim for fees from foreign countries. Congressional Republicans would eliminate foreign taxes altogether, while Trump would maintain taxation at a substantially lower rate."

Exxon,2017-1,"{{20170104T151645.621+0000}}UPDATE 2-New Lebanese govt OKs oil decrees to start stalled tender process(Adds detail, analyst quotes)"
Exxon,2017-1,"BEIRUT, Jan 4 (Reuters) - Lebanon's new government on Wednesday passed two decrees concerning oil and gas exploration blocks, meaning a tender process for offshore reserves, stalled since 2013, can begin."
Exxon,2017-1,"Beirut estimates it has 96 trillion cubic feet of natural gas reserves and 865 million barrels of oil offshore, but squabbling between parties has prevented it from kick-starting exploration and development of the sector."
Exxon,2017-1,"""The two oil decrees have been decided in the first achievement for the government,"" Foreign Minister Gibran Bassil wrote on Twitter during the first meeting of the new cabinet under Prime Minister Saad Hariri."
Exxon,2017-1,The decrees define the blocks and specify conditions for production and exploration tenders and contracts. Full details of these model exploration and production agreements have not yet been published.
Exxon,2017-1,"The cabinet also agreed to form a ministerial committee to study the tax regime needed for the hydrocarbon industry, and another committee to study a draft hydrocarbon law, Information Minister Melhem Riachi said after the meeting."
Exxon,2017-1,"In 2013, 46 companies qualified to take part in bidding for oil and gas tenders, 12 of them as operators, including Chevron , Total and Exxon Mobil ."
Exxon,2017-1,"Jeremy Arbid of the Lebanon Oil and Gas Initiative, a non-governmental organisation promoting transparency and policy development in the hydrocarbon sector, said it appears those 46 companies will now be able to enter a bidding process."
Exxon,2017-1,He said the situation will be clearer when the full decrees are published.
Exxon,2017-1,"Ayham Kamel, Middle East director for the political risk group Eurasia, said delays in oil and gas licensing had undermined confidence in Lebanese policymaking."
Exxon,2017-1,"""Lebanon had to demonstrate that it is extremely business-friendly and that political issues will not represent a real obstacle,"" he said."
Exxon,2017-1,"""The Lebanese Petroleum Administration (regulatory body) is proving responsive to international dynamics but the body needs political support to manage the process and broaden interest in the Lebanese energy sector,"" Kamel said."
Exxon,2017-1,"Beirut hopes exploiting the hydrocarbon reserves will help tackle its debt and power shortages, which see most homes go without electricity or rely on generators for many hours a day."
Exxon,2017-1,"Political paralysis left Lebanon without a president for more than two years. The government was unable to tackle long-pending economic and development issues such as garbage disposal, electricity, water and stock market privatisation."
Exxon,2017-1,The country is also bearing the costs of hosting more than 1 million refugees from neighbouring Syria's civil war.

Exxon,2017-1,{{20170103T142442.837+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-Hadas: Four resolutions for a more humane economy(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.)
Exxon,2017-1,"LONDON, Jan 3 (Reuters Breakingviews) - The global establishment is under attack. Britain's vote to break its 40-year bond with the European Union and Donald Trump's election as U.S. president are the most prominent examples of a prevailing unhappiness with the established social and economic elites. Though its members have promised to be more responsive to angry people, they are floundering. Here are four New Year's resolutions to make the economy more humane."
Exxon,2017-1,"Start with gross domestic product. Actually, stop with GDP. The fetish of increasing an arbitrary measure of output does more harm than good, especially in developed economies. Real GDP, the measure which is always supposed to rise, captures almost none of people's big economic worries."
Exxon,2017-1,"Growing GDP does not measure inadequate and insecure jobs, unexpectedly low retirement income, or the worry of huge medical bills in the United States. It does not register the plight of the very poor or the greed of the very rich. Worse still, rising GDP can actually be a contrary indicator of social and emotional wellbeing, for example when more money is devoted to dealing with substance abuse or family breakdowns."
Exxon,2017-1,"More fundamentally, the fixation with ever-higher GDP is an invitation to unhappiness in already developed economies. Whatever satisfaction and security goods and services can buy is already available to almost everyone. Sure, more equal distribution of income or more capital investment might improve the mood. But the best antidote to incessant accumulation of more stuff is the pursuit of goals that are more spiritually uplifting."
Exxon,2017-1,"Such inspiration is in short supply these days. That brings up the second resolution for the establishment agenda: the fight against alienation. Ever since religious belief became optional in the West, social observers have worried about the widespread loss of higher purpose and standards. Without some cause to live and perhaps to die for, people can eventually become restless, miserable or even violent."
Exxon,2017-1,"Politicians and business leaders can hardly be expected to provide substitutes for God. But they should at least recognise the danger of deep social despair fuelling radical nationalism that, in the 20th century, culminated in two world wars."
Exxon,2017-1,"While casting around for uplifting ideas, leaders might focus on some small ones. The third resolution is one of those: the promotion of communities. These days, the word community is usually preceded by an adjective like broken, damaged, or isolated. Though the loss is real, the positive potential is also great. Family, friends, tribe, neighbourhood and worship can bind people together in deeply satisfactory ways."
Exxon,2017-1,"Big business can help. Though corporations sometimes claim to treat their workers as a sort of close-knit tribe, the search for growth and profit usually gets in the way. A good initial reform would be to cut back on exorbitant - and community-breaking - executive pay."
Exxon,2017-1,"At Exxon Mobil , chairman and Chief Executive Rex Tillerson's annual pay has averaged $24 million over the last decade. The oil giant would have a better chance of working like a united team if his successor received something a lot closer to the $204,000 Tillerson will make if he is confirmed as U.S. secretary of state. That figure - four times the median U.S. household income - is enough to live on, but little enough to allow other employees to feel the leader inhabits the same world they do."
Exxon,2017-1,"Modern governments, with their countless agencies and huge, rule-bound and bureaucrat-heavy welfare states, are structured to undermine traditional communities. U.S. Republicans often talk about changing that, but will struggle to reverse this well-established historical trend."
Exxon,2017-1,"Trump and other leaders could start by emphasising the final resolution: local decision-making. The principle of subsidiarity - the notion that political issues should be tackled as locally as possible - is endorsed in the EU's Maastricht Treaty. The reality seems to be almost the opposite, which helps explain why so many British voters voted to leave the Union."
Exxon,2017-1,"Indeed, governments everywhere have become steadily more distant from the people for the last two centuries. Centralisation can bring significant economies of scale, but these days such efficiency may be less valuable than the human scale which has been sacrificed."
Exxon,2017-1,"New Year's resolutions are often discarded as swiftly as they are made. Less emphasis on GDP, peaceful ways to fight alienation, more community and more subsidiarity may be too demanding for today's leaders. But unless their successors are more imaginative and competent in pursuing a more humane economy, the political ructions of 2016 may prove a bitter introduction to something much worse."

Exxon,2017-1,{{20170103T142442.837+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-Hadas: Four resolutions for a more humane economy(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.)
Exxon,2017-1,"LONDON, Jan 3 (Reuters Breakingviews) - The global establishment is under attack. Britain's vote to break its 40-year bond with the European Union and Donald Trump's election as U.S. president are the most prominent examples of a prevailing unhappiness with the established social and economic elites. Though its members have promised to be more responsive to angry people, they are floundering. Here are four New Year's resolutions to make the economy more humane."
Exxon,2017-1,"Start with gross domestic product. Actually, stop with GDP. The fetish of increasing an arbitrary measure of output does more harm than good, especially in developed economies. Real GDP, the measure which is always supposed to rise, captures almost none of people's big economic worries."
Exxon,2017-1,"Growing GDP does not measure inadequate and insecure jobs, unexpectedly low retirement income, or the worry of huge medical bills in the United States. It does not register the plight of the very poor or the greed of the very rich. Worse still, rising GDP can actually be a contrary indicator of social and emotional wellbeing, for example when more money is devoted to dealing with substance abuse or family breakdowns."
Exxon,2017-1,"More fundamentally, the fixation with ever-higher GDP is an invitation to unhappiness in already developed economies. Whatever satisfaction and security goods and services can buy is already available to almost everyone. Sure, more equal distribution of income or more capital investment might improve the mood. But the best antidote to incessant accumulation of more stuff is the pursuit of goals that are more spiritually uplifting."
Exxon,2017-1,"Such inspiration is in short supply these days. That brings up the second resolution for the establishment agenda: the fight against alienation. Ever since religious belief became optional in the West, social observers have worried about the widespread loss of higher purpose and standards. Without some cause to live and perhaps to die for, people can eventually become restless, miserable or even violent."
Exxon,2017-1,"Politicians and business leaders can hardly be expected to provide substitutes for God. But they should at least recognise the danger of deep social despair fuelling radical nationalism that, in the 20th century, culminated in two world wars."
Exxon,2017-1,"While casting around for uplifting ideas, leaders might focus on some small ones. The third resolution is one of those: the promotion of communities. These days, the word community is usually preceded by an adjective like broken, damaged, or isolated. Though the loss is real, the positive potential is also great. Family, friends, tribe, neighbourhood and worship can bind people together in deeply satisfactory ways."
Exxon,2017-1,"Big business can help. Though corporations sometimes claim to treat their workers as a sort of close-knit tribe, the search for growth and profit usually gets in the way. A good initial reform would be to cut back on exorbitant - and community-breaking - executive pay."
Exxon,2017-1,"At Exxon Mobil , chairman and Chief Executive Rex Tillerson's annual pay has averaged $24 million over the last decade. The oil giant would have a better chance of working like a united team if his successor received something a lot closer to the $204,000 Tillerson will make if he is confirmed as U.S. secretary of state. That figure - four times the median U.S. household income - is enough to live on, but little enough to allow other employees to feel the leader inhabits the same world they do."
Exxon,2017-1,"Modern governments, with their countless agencies and huge, rule-bound and bureaucrat-heavy welfare states, are structured to undermine traditional communities. U.S. Republicans often talk about changing that, but will struggle to reverse this well-established historical trend."
Exxon,2017-1,"Trump and other leaders could start by emphasising the final resolution: local decision-making. The principle of subsidiarity - the notion that political issues should be tackled as locally as possible - is endorsed in the EU's Maastricht Treaty. The reality seems to be almost the opposite, which helps explain why so many British voters voted to leave the Union."
Exxon,2017-1,"Indeed, governments everywhere have become steadily more distant from the people for the last two centuries. Centralisation can bring significant economies of scale, but these days such efficiency may be less valuable than the human scale which has been sacrificed."
Exxon,2017-1,"New Year's resolutions are often discarded as swiftly as they are made. Less emphasis on GDP, peaceful ways to fight alienation, more community and more subsidiarity may be too demanding for today's leaders. But unless their successors are more imaginative and competent in pursuing a more humane economy, the political ructions of 2016 may prove a bitter introduction to something much worse."
