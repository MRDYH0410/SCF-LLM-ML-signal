ConocoPhillips,2017-9,{{20170929T200250.702+0000}}REFILE-ANALYSIS-Energy industry says 'no thanks' to Trump offer of marine sanctuaries(Corrects penultimate paragraph spelling to Michael instead of Michel)
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"WASHINGTON/LOS ANGELES, Sept 28 (Reuters) - In a bid to boost energy development, U.S. President Donald Trump's administration is considering shrinking or eliminating 11 marine sanctuaries designed to protect 425 million acres of coral reefs, marine mammal habitats and pristine beaches."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"The review is part of a broader strategy to open new areas to oil and gas drilling and ""put the energy needs of American families and businesses first,"" according to the order Trump signed in April that triggered it."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"But interviews with energy industry representatives signal the effort will likely miss its target. Opening up these areas would likely help wind power companies - which Trump has lambasted - more than oil producers, they say. And neither industry is interested because of the high costs of offshore development, comparatively rich opportunities on land and the public relations headaches of developing protected oceanscapes."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,The White House did not respond to a request for comment.
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"The U.S. Commerce Department is scheduled to issue its recommendations on the sanctuaries, located in the Pacific, the Great Lakes, and the Atlantic, next month. Most public comments submitted to Commerce favored preserving existing sanctuaries."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"""Our members are not currently pursuing this opportunity,"" said Catherine Reheis-Boyd, the president of the Western States Petroleum Association, referring to four marine sanctuaries off California's coast that are under review."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"The WSPA represents major integrated companies including Exxon Mobil , BP , Chevron , and ConocoPhillips , and is focused on the region that would be most affected by the review."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,Officials for those companies did not respond to requests for comment.
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"Other sanctuaries under review include the Thunder Bay Sanctuary in the Great Lakes, the Northeast Canyons and Seamounts in the Atlantic, and sites off Hawaii, American Samoa, and the Northern Mariana Islands."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"Government offshore drilling lease data reviewed by Reuters shows the oil industry is bidding on less offshore acreage with less money than it has in years, in part because onshore reserves have become easier to tap with new drilling technology."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"The average price drillers have bid for available offshore drilling leases in the Central Gulf of Mexico, for example, declined to about $300 per acre this year, from more than $700 per acre in 2013."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"Even so, U.S. oil and gas production has surged because of the onshore boom: Production hit 8.85 million barrels per day in 2016, from 5.09 million a decade earlier, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"""It is clear we don't need to take from every portion of our oceans and coasts to maintain a healthy energy economy,"" Democratic lawmakers on the House Natural Resources Committee wrote in July in a letter opposing the sanctuary review."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"Drillers' groups such as the American Petroleum Institute and the National Ocean Industries Association have expressed support for the review, mainly on the grounds that it sends a strong signal of federal support for the oil industry."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"Neal Kirby, a spokesman for the Independent Petroleum Producers of America, said that ""it's possible to find the appropriate balance between safety, protecting the environment, and making sure we can move forward with responsible offshore energy development."""
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"Trump had campaigned on a promise to bolster U.S. fossil fuels production by repealing environmental rules he says unnecessarily hinder drilling and mining. So far he has moved to roll back carbon emissions limits, lift curbs on federal energy leasing, and ease permitting requirements."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"The Department of the Interior completed a separate but similar review in August of some 27 national monuments across the country, which include vast areas of protected land."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"The recommendations from that review have not been announced, but a leaked version obtained by the Washington Post showed Interior will recommend shrinking some of the monuments where energy resources are available or industries like commercial fishing and timber want more access. [nL2N1LZ0JQ]"
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,Wind industry representatives say that firms could power more than 16 million homes by erecting wind turbines on California's marine sanctuaries - but they would rather look for growth in places where such development is cheaper and less controversial.
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"California's waters are deep, requiring costly and unproven floating wind turbine technology. Development there would likely also face onerous state regulatory hurdles and potential public opposition."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"""The American Wind Energy Association is not advocating for re-visiting any (marine sanctuary) designations,"" said Evan Vaughan, spokesman for AWEA. ""In general, the designations have not been a barrier to offshore wind development."""
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"Michael Conathan, oceans policy director at the Center for American Progress, a progressive policy advocacy group, said the sanctuary review appeared to hold mostly symbolic value given the lack of oil and wind industry demand."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"""The reality is it is not going to happen unless something drastic happens with the economics,"" he said."

ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"The review is part of a broader strategy to open new areas to oil and gas drilling and ""put the energy needs of American families and businesses first,"" according to the order Trump signed in April that triggered it."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"But interviews with energy industry representatives signal the effort will likely miss its target. Opening up these areas would likely help wind power companies - which Trump has lambasted - more than oil producers, they say. And neither industry is interested because of the high costs of offshore development, comparatively rich opportunities on land and the public relations headaches of developing protected oceanscapes."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,The White House did not respond to a request for comment.
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"The U.S. Commerce Department is scheduled to issue its recommendations on the sanctuaries, located in the Pacific, the Great Lakes, and the Atlantic, next month. Most public comments submitted to Commerce favored preserving existing sanctuaries."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"""Our members are not currently pursuing this opportunity,"" said Catherine Reheis-Boyd, the president of the Western States Petroleum Association, referring to four marine sanctuaries off California's coast that are under review."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"The WSPA represents major integrated companies including Exxon Mobil , BP , Chevron , and ConocoPhillips , and is focused on the region that would be most affected by the review."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,Officials for those companies did not respond to requests for comment.
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"Other sanctuaries under review include the Thunder Bay Sanctuary in the Great Lakes, the Northeast Canyons and Seamounts in the Atlantic, and sites off Hawaii, American Samoa, and the Northern Mariana Islands."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"Government offshore drilling lease data reviewed by Reuters shows the oil industry is bidding on less offshore acreage with less money than it has in years, in part because onshore reserves have become easier to tap with new drilling technology."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"The average price drillers have bid for available offshore drilling leases in the Central Gulf of Mexico, for example, declined to about $300 per acre this year, from more than $700 per acre in 2013."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"Even so, U.S. oil and gas production has surged because of the onshore boom: Production hit 8.85 million barrels per day in 2016, from 5.09 million a decade earlier, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"""It is clear we don't need to take from every portion of our oceans and coasts to maintain a healthy energy economy,"" Democratic lawmakers on the House Natural Resources Committee wrote in July in a letter opposing the sanctuary review."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"Drillers' groups such as the American Petroleum Institute and the National Ocean Industries Association have expressed support for the review, mainly on the grounds that it sends a strong signal of federal support for the oil industry."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"Neal Kirby, a spokesman for the Independent Petroleum Producers of America, said that ""it's possible to find the appropriate balance between safety, protecting the environment, and making sure we can move forward with responsible offshore energy development."""
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"Trump had campaigned on a promise to bolster U.S. fossil fuels production by repealing environmental rules he says unnecessarily hinder drilling and mining. So far he has moved to roll back carbon emissions limits, lift curbs on federal energy leasing, and ease permitting requirements."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"The Department of the Interior completed a separate but similar review in August of some 27 national monuments across the country, which include vast areas of protected land."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"The recommendations from that review have not been announced, but a leaked version obtained by the Washington Post showed Interior will recommend shrinking some of the monuments where energy resources are available or industries like commercial fishing and timber want more access. [nL2N1LZ0JQ]"
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,Wind industry representatives say that firms could power more than 16 million homes by erecting wind turbines on California's marine sanctuaries - but they would rather look for growth in places where such development is cheaper and less controversial.
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"California's waters are deep, requiring costly and unproven floating wind turbine technology. Development there would likely also face onerous state regulatory hurdles and potential public opposition."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"""The American Wind Energy Association is not advocating for re-visiting any (marine sanctuary) designations,"" said Evan Vaughn, spokesman for AWEA. ""In general, the designations have not been a barrier to offshore wind development."""
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"Michel Conathan, oceans policy director at the Center for American Progress, a progressive policy advocacy group, said the sanctuary review appeared to hold mostly symbolic value given the lack of oil and wind industry demand."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"""The reality is it is not going to happen unless something drastic happens with the economics,"" he said."

ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"NEW DELHI/MUMBAI, Sept 27 (Reuters) - India plans to offer stakes of up to 60 percent in oil and gas fields owned by state energy companies that are already in production to private firms, five sources with knowledge of the matter said, a move that would hit revenues of state explorers."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,The government is making the decision after failing to draw investment from global oil majors in new fields.
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,The plan is meant to boost India's domestic oil and gas output and help meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi's target to reduce oil imports by 10 percent by 2022.
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"India is the world's third-largest crude importer, buying about 80 percent of its supplies from overseas."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"The sales plan would affect so-called ""nomination blocks"" or fields handed to state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) and Oil India Ltd . The fields are both onshore and offshore, according to the sources."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"The Directorate General of Hydrocarbon (DGH), a unit of the oil ministry, has suggested the state companies form joint ventures with private firms including foreign majors that have long eyed the fields, the sources said."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"India's cabinet could accept the new policy by December, said a government official."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"The DGH has also proposed the state-owned companies form technical tie-ups with private firms, offering to give them an assured rate of return if the output increases beyond a certain level, the five sources said."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,The shift in strategy is triggered by the inability of domestic explorers to keep pace with India's rising energy demand.
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"After the discovery of the Bombay High oil fields in 1974 and Bassein gas fields in 1976, ONGC has not been able to bring any new major fields into production in the last three decades."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"India has failed to draw interest from global oil majors in licensing rounds since 1990 even though the fiscal terms were eased. However, Royal Dutch Shell and BP later bought stakes from firms that had won drilling rights."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,An ONGC executive said the government's move to invite private firms into the mature oil fields would impact its long-term plans.
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"""We look at the blocks from a long-term basis ... internally, the company is not keen on the move as it can disrupt the current planning and production targets over the long term,"" the executive said, speaking on the condition of anonymity as he was not authorised to speak to journalists."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,Another ONGC official said the company would prefer to share revenue with new partners for incremental production but not for the entire output from the fields.
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,A spokesman for ONGC declined to comment. The DGH Director General Atanu Chakraborty also declined to comment.
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"The move would hit the revenues of ONGC and Oil India, which make most of their profits from these about 200 fields."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"""Definitely this will hit revenues and profits of these companies. These companies are already passing through a tough time because of low oil prices. They have huge plans for development of various assets,"" said Prayesh Jain, associate vice-president at domestic wealth management company IIFL."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"While explorers sell oil produced from these blocks at market rates, gas is sold at state-set prices. DGH has suggested market rates for gas sold from these blocks."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"Oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan told Reuters last month a decision would be taken to allow private participation in India's producing nomination blocks, but did not specify any timeframe."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"""Nomination blocks are not meant forever for anyone. It is the property of the government of India,"" Pradhan said."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"In the past, foreign firms including Conocophillips and Shell tried to buy stakes in nomination blocks, mainly Mumbai High fields, but the moves failed to come off."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"R.S. Sharma, head of the hydrocarbon committee at industry chamber FICCI and former chairman of ONGC, said private participation should be allowed in fields where oil and gas recovery is low, and not for fields such as Mumbai High."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"He said foreign firms would be interested in the fields if they won equity stakes. During his tenure, Shell was keen to buy stakes and help ONGC boost output from heavy oil fields in western India, he said."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"""Global oil majors want equity share in fields; they don't want a role of service contractor."""

ConocoPhillips,2017-9,Statoil and partners plan output capacity expansion at Norway's Troll gas field - Reuters News
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,{{20170926T103156.354+0000}}Statoil and partners plan output capacity expansion at Norway's Troll gas field* Aker Solutions awarded contract to boost output capacity
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"OSLO, Sept 26 (Reuters) - Norway's Statoil and partners are working to increase the output capacity of Troll, the country's largest gas field, a move traders say would enable the firms to produce more flexibly and cover production shortages at other fields due to outages."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,The Troll field accounts for 40 percent of Norway's gas resources and is a crucial energy source for many European states.
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"Operator Statoil has awarded a front-end engineering and design (FEED) contract to engineering firm Aker Solutions so that oil and gas can be produced simultaneously from the Troll West reservoir, it said on Sept. 21."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,The North Sea field consists of two reservoirs: Troll West contains both oil and gas while Troll East holds gas only.
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"""Starting immediately, the FEED work will be performed at Aker Solutions ... If the option to extend the contract is exercised, the work will last until 2020,"" Statoil spokesman Morten Eek said."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,He declined to say how much extra capacity would be available.
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,Troll is expected to reach record output this year as Norwegian authorities allowed Statoil to increase production to a high of 36 billion cubic metres. [nO9N1IC01B]
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"A gas trader said the extra capacity could be used to provide flexibility to the market when supply is constrained, by backing up Norwegian output in case of maintenance and outages at other fields."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"""Since there are quotas for production I think that capacity will be used to fill in the gaps and provide flexibility ... higher capacity doesn't automatically translate in higher output,"" said Accenture trader Natalie Oliynyk-Fritsch."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"Statoil and partners could also choose to produce the most profitable hydrocarbon at any given time, said another trader."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"""If they have gas commitments that make more (money), they can emphasise the gas, if it is oil (that makes more money) they will emphasise oil,"" said the trader, who declined to be named."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"Following the award of the FEED contract, Statoil and partners will work towards a final investment decision, which could come in 2018, said another Statoil spokesman, Eskil Eriksen."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"If the project gets the go-ahead, construction will include drilling of 8 production wells, laying of a 36-inch pipeline, and installation of a new processing module on the Troll A platform, said Statoil, but couldn't give a cost estimate."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"The project does not involve building new infrastructure to process and transport gas after extraction, but it will heighten the utilisation of existing infrastructure, said Lisbet Kallevik, a spokeswoman for gas pipeline operator Gassco."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,Gas from Troll is processed by the Kollsnes plant on Norway's west coast.
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"State-owned Petoro has a 56 percent stake in Troll, with majority state-owned Statoil holding 30.6 percent."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"The other partners are oil majors Shell with 8.1 percent, Total with 3.7 percent and ConocoPhillips with 1.6 percent."

ConocoPhillips,2017-9,{{20170929T200250.702+0000}}REFILE-ANALYSIS-Energy industry says 'no thanks' to Trump offer of marine sanctuaries(Corrects penultimate paragraph spelling to Michael instead of Michel)
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"WASHINGTON/LOS ANGELES, Sept 28 (Reuters) - In a bid to boost energy development, U.S. President Donald Trump's administration is considering shrinking or eliminating 11 marine sanctuaries designed to protect 425 million acres of coral reefs, marine mammal habitats and pristine beaches."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"The review is part of a broader strategy to open new areas to oil and gas drilling and ""put the energy needs of American families and businesses first,"" according to the order Trump signed in April that triggered it."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"But interviews with energy industry representatives signal the effort will likely miss its target. Opening up these areas would likely help wind power companies - which Trump has lambasted - more than oil producers, they say. And neither industry is interested because of the high costs of offshore development, comparatively rich opportunities on land and the public relations headaches of developing protected oceanscapes."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,The White House did not respond to a request for comment.
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"The U.S. Commerce Department is scheduled to issue its recommendations on the sanctuaries, located in the Pacific, the Great Lakes, and the Atlantic, next month. Most public comments submitted to Commerce favored preserving existing sanctuaries."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"""Our members are not currently pursuing this opportunity,"" said Catherine Reheis-Boyd, the president of the Western States Petroleum Association, referring to four marine sanctuaries off California's coast that are under review."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"The WSPA represents major integrated companies including Exxon Mobil , BP , Chevron , and ConocoPhillips , and is focused on the region that would be most affected by the review."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,Officials for those companies did not respond to requests for comment.
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"Other sanctuaries under review include the Thunder Bay Sanctuary in the Great Lakes, the Northeast Canyons and Seamounts in the Atlantic, and sites off Hawaii, American Samoa, and the Northern Mariana Islands."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"Government offshore drilling lease data reviewed by Reuters shows the oil industry is bidding on less offshore acreage with less money than it has in years, in part because onshore reserves have become easier to tap with new drilling technology."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"The average price drillers have bid for available offshore drilling leases in the Central Gulf of Mexico, for example, declined to about $300 per acre this year, from more than $700 per acre in 2013."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"Even so, U.S. oil and gas production has surged because of the onshore boom: Production hit 8.85 million barrels per day in 2016, from 5.09 million a decade earlier, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"""It is clear we don't need to take from every portion of our oceans and coasts to maintain a healthy energy economy,"" Democratic lawmakers on the House Natural Resources Committee wrote in July in a letter opposing the sanctuary review."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"Drillers' groups such as the American Petroleum Institute and the National Ocean Industries Association have expressed support for the review, mainly on the grounds that it sends a strong signal of federal support for the oil industry."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"Neal Kirby, a spokesman for the Independent Petroleum Producers of America, said that ""it's possible to find the appropriate balance between safety, protecting the environment, and making sure we can move forward with responsible offshore energy development."""
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"Trump had campaigned on a promise to bolster U.S. fossil fuels production by repealing environmental rules he says unnecessarily hinder drilling and mining. So far he has moved to roll back carbon emissions limits, lift curbs on federal energy leasing, and ease permitting requirements."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"The Department of the Interior completed a separate but similar review in August of some 27 national monuments across the country, which include vast areas of protected land."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"The recommendations from that review have not been announced, but a leaked version obtained by the Washington Post showed Interior will recommend shrinking some of the monuments where energy resources are available or industries like commercial fishing and timber want more access.

ConocoPhillips,2017-9,Wind industry representatives say that firms could power more than 16 million homes by erecting wind turbines on California's marine sanctuaries - but they would rather look for growth in places where such development is cheaper and less controversial.
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"California's waters are deep, requiring costly and unproven floating wind turbine technology. Development there would likely also face onerous state regulatory hurdles and potential public opposition."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"""The American Wind Energy Association is not advocating for re-visiting any (marine sanctuary) designations,"" said Evan Vaughan, spokesman for AWEA. ""In general, the designations have not been a barrier to offshore wind development."""
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"Michael Conathan, oceans policy director at the Center for American Progress, a progressive policy advocacy group, said the sanctuary review appeared to hold mostly symbolic value given the lack of oil and wind industry demand."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"""The reality is it is not going to happen unless something drastic happens with the economics,"" he said."

ConocoPhillips,2017-9,{{20170928T145208.869+0000}}ANALYSIS-Energy industry says 'no thanks' to Trump offer of marine sanctuariesBy Valerie Volcovici and Nichola Groom
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"WASHINGTON/LOS ANGELES, Sept 28 (Reuters) - In a bid to boost energy development, U.S. President Donald Trump's administration is considering shrinking or eliminating 11 marine sanctuaries designed to protect 425 million acres of coral reefs, marine mammal habitats and pristine beaches."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"The review is part of a broader strategy to open new areas to oil and gas drilling and ""put the energy needs of American families and businesses first,"" according to the order Trump signed in April that triggered it."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"But interviews with energy industry representatives signal the effort will likely miss its target. Opening up these areas would likely help wind power companies - which Trump has lambasted - more than oil producers, they say. And neither industry is interested because of the high costs of offshore development, comparatively rich opportunities on land and the public relations headaches of developing protected oceanscapes."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,The White House did not respond to a request for comment.
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"The U.S. Commerce Department is scheduled to issue its recommendations on the sanctuaries, located in the Pacific, the Great Lakes, and the Atlantic, next month. Most public comments submitted to Commerce favored preserving existing sanctuaries."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"""Our members are not currently pursuing this opportunity,"" said Catherine Reheis-Boyd, the president of the Western States Petroleum Association, referring to four marine sanctuaries off California's coast that are under review."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"The WSPA represents major integrated companies including Exxon Mobil , BP , Chevron , and ConocoPhillips , and is focused on the region that would be most affected by the review."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,Officials for those companies did not respond to requests for comment.
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"Other sanctuaries under review include the Thunder Bay Sanctuary in the Great Lakes, the Northeast Canyons and Seamounts in the Atlantic, and sites off Hawaii, American Samoa, and the Northern Mariana Islands."

ConocoPhillips,2017-9,* ONGC wants new cos to share profit on extra output-source
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"NEW DELHI/MUMBAI, Sept 27 (Reuters) - India plans to offer stakes of up to 60 percent in oil and gas fields owned by state energy companies that are already in production to private firms, five sources with knowledge of the matter said, a move that would hit revenues of state explorers."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,The government is making the decision after failing to draw investment from global oil majors in new fields.
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,The plan is meant to boost India's domestic oil and gas output and help meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi's target to reduce oil imports by 10 percent by 2022.
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"India is the world's third-largest crude importer, buying about 80 percent of its supplies from overseas."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"The sales plan would affect so-called ""nomination blocks"" or fields handed to state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) and Oil India Ltd . The fields are both onshore and offshore, according to the sources."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"The Directorate General of Hydrocarbon (DGH), a unit of the oil ministry, has suggested the state companies form joint ventures with private firms including foreign majors that have long eyed the fields, the sources said."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"India's cabinet could accept the new policy by December, said a government official."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"The DGH has also proposed the state-owned companies form technical tie-ups with private firms, offering to give them an assured rate of return if the output increases beyond a certain level, the five sources said."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,The shift in strategy is triggered by the inability of domestic explorers to keep pace with India's rising energy demand.
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"After the discovery of the Bombay High oil fields in 1974 and Bassein gas fields in 1976, ONGC has not been able to bring any new major fields into production in the last three decades."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"India has failed to draw interest from global oil majors in licensing rounds since 1990 even though the fiscal terms were eased. However, Royal Dutch Shell and BP later bought stakes from firms that had won drilling rights."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,An ONGC executive said the government's move to invite private firms into the mature oil fields would impact its long-term plans.
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"""We look at the blocks from a long-term basis ... internally, the company is not keen on the move as it can disrupt the current planning and production targets over the long term,"" the executive said, speaking on the condition of anonymity as he was not authorised to speak to journalists."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,Another ONGC official said the company would prefer to share revenue with new partners for incremental production but not for the entire output from the fields.
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,A spokesman for ONGC declined to comment. The DGH Director General Atanu Chakraborty also declined to comment.
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"The move would hit the revenues of ONGC and Oil India, which make most of their profits from these about 200 fields."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"""Definitely this will hit revenues and profits of these companies. These companies are already passing through a tough time because of low oil prices. They have huge plans for development of various assets,"" said Prayesh Jain, associate vice-president at domestic wealth management company IIFL."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"While explorers sell oil produced from these blocks at market rates, gas is sold at state-set prices. DGH has suggested market rates for gas sold from these blocks."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"Oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan told Reuters last month a decision would be taken to allow private participation in India's producing nomination blocks, but did not specify any timeframe."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"""Nomination blocks are not meant forever for anyone. It is the property of the government of India,"" Pradhan said."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"In the past, foreign firms including Conocophillips and Shell tried to buy stakes in nomination blocks, mainly Mumbai High fields, but the moves failed to come off."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"R.S. Sharma, head of the hydrocarbon committee at industry chamber FICCI and former chairman of ONGC, said private participation should be allowed in fields where oil and gas recovery is low, and not for fields such as Mumbai High."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"He said foreign firms would be interested in the fields if they won equity stakes. During his tenure, Shell was keen to buy stakes and help ONGC boost output from heavy oil fields in western India, he said."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"""Global oil majors want equity share in fields; they don't want a role of service contractor."""

ConocoPhillips,2017-9,{{20170926T103156.354+0000}}Statoil and partners plan output capacity expansion at Norway's Troll gas field* Aker Solutions awarded contract to boost output capacity
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"OSLO, Sept 26 (Reuters) - Norway's Statoil and partners are working to increase the output capacity of Troll, the country's largest gas field, a move traders say would enable the firms to produce more flexibly and cover production shortages at other fields due to outages."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,The Troll field accounts for 40 percent of Norway's gas resources and is a crucial energy source for many European states.
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"Operator Statoil has awarded a front-end engineering and design (FEED) contract to engineering firm Aker Solutions so that oil and gas can be produced simultaneously from the Troll West reservoir, it said on Sept. 21."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,The North Sea field consists of two reservoirs: Troll West contains both oil and gas while Troll East holds gas only.
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"""Starting immediately, the FEED work will be performed at Aker Solutions ... If the option to extend the contract is exercised, the work will last until 2020,"" Statoil spokesman Morten Eek said."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,He declined to say how much extra capacity would be available.
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,Troll is expected to reach record output this year as Norwegian authorities allowed Statoil to increase production to a high of 36 billion cubic metres. [nO9N1IC01B]
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"A gas trader said the extra capacity could be used to provide flexibility to the market when supply is constrained, by backing up Norwegian output in case of maintenance and outages at other fields."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"""Since there are quotas for production I think that capacity will be used to fill in the gaps and provide flexibility ... higher capacity doesn't automatically translate in higher output,"" said Accenture trader Natalie Oliynyk-Fritsch."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"Statoil and partners could also choose to produce the most profitable hydrocarbon at any given time, said another trader."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"""If they have gas commitments that make more (money), they can emphasise the gas, if it is oil (that makes more money) they will emphasise oil,"" said the trader, who declined to be named."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"Following the award of the FEED contract, Statoil and partners will work towards a final investment decision, which could come in 2018, said another Statoil spokesman, Eskil Eriksen."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"If the project gets the go-ahead, construction will include drilling of 8 production wells, laying of a 36-inch pipeline, and installation of a new processing module on the Troll A platform, said Statoil, but couldn't give a cost estimate."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"The project does not involve building new infrastructure to process and transport gas after extraction, but it will heighten the utilisation of existing infrastructure, said Lisbet Kallevik, a spokeswoman for gas pipeline operator Gassco."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,Gas from Troll is processed by the Kollsnes plant on Norway's west coast.
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"State-owned Petoro has a 56 percent stake in Troll, with majority state-owned Statoil holding 30.6 percent."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"The other partners are oil majors Shell with 8.1 percent, Total with 3.7 percent and ConocoPhillips with 1.6 percent."

ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"HOUSTON, Sept 7 (Reuters) - ConocoPhillips is still shut out of its global headquarters nearly two weeks after Tropical Storm Harvey slammed into Houston, so Chief Executive Ryan Lance and thousands of employees are running the world's largest independent oil and natural gas producer remotely."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"Lance, whose own Houston home was flooded by Harvey, has 2,800 employees in the region working at home or at smaller offices in Dallas or Bartlesville, Oklahoma, overseeing natural gas trading along with operations in the Texas Eagle Ford shale region and the Gulf of Mexico. Many were moved out of Harvey's path before the storm."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"""You can run virtually for a long time if you've got the right systems and personnel,"" Lance told Reuters on Wednesday."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"Conoco's headquarters in west Houston sustained minor flooding damage, but roads to the campus are still submerged under several feet of water. Another nearby ConocoPhillips office was flooded."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"""Like everyone else, we didn't anticipate all this rain. The damage quickly passed for our Eagle Ford operations, but then our attention turned to our headquarters,"" he said."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,The flooding stems from a decision by regional officials to release water from a nearby reservoir to prevent collapse after nearly 52 inches (132 cm) of rainfall during Harvey.
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"Conoco initially expected to reopen by Sept. 5, but flooding pushed that back until at least Sept. 11. The company is not expected to need temporary office space, he said."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"Lance, CEO since 2012, said he speaks daily with emergency staff and board members, most of whom do not live in the Houston area. About 8 percent of Conoco employees in the region, roughly 200 people, have long-term home damage from the storm."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"Conoco said it donated $5 million to the United Way and American Red Cross, the largest sum from any oil company in Harvey's wake."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"BP Plc's U.S. offices, less than 2 miles (3 km) west of Conoco headquarters, suffered extensive flooding and are closed indefinitely. Some of the day-to-day functions were absorbed by BP's London headquarters."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"Companies that need temporary office space will find a Houston real estate market with spare capacity, though the extent of damage is unclear. There were about 10 million square feet of office space available ahead of Harvey, according to real estate firm CBRE."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"""As oil and gas companies continue to downsize in response to the low oil price environment, Houston remains flush with sublease space with existing furniture already in place,"" said CBRE's Graham Horton."

ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"MIDLAND, Texas, Sept 7 (Reuters) - When Joe Forsythe returned to the West Texas oilfields last year after a stint in a drug rehab facility, he figured he had beaten his addiction to methamphetamine."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,The 32-year-old rig worker and equipment handler lasted about a year before relapsing.
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"""It's easy to get back into that mentality,"" said Forsythe, of Midland, Texas, who said he no longer uses drugs after several stints in rehab since 2015. ""I'd work 24 hours ... I was just plagued with fatigue and needed something to improve my work ethic."""
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"Forsythe's experience and others like it reflect a painful flipside of the nation's shale oil boom - a parallel increase in substance abuse, drug crime and related social ills."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"While drug use is a problem among industrial workers nationwide, it raises particular concern in the oil patch as U.S. production surges to record levels in what is already one of the nation's most dangerous sectors - with a fatality rate about three times the average for other industries, according to 2015 federal statistics."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"Drug use is a significant factor in workplace injuries and crimes involving oilfield workers, according to drug counselors, hospital and police officials and court records in West Texas, the epicenter of the U.S. shale sector."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"As the shale revolution has spawned waves of hiring here since 2010, law enforcement authorities have tracked a boom in drug trafficking and related crime. In Midland and Ector counties, home to many Permian Basin oil workers, state and local police in 2016 seized more than 95 pounds of methamphetamine - up from less than four pounds in 2010."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"Meth and cocaine are stimulants of choice in the oil patch to get though long oilfield shifts, but alcohol and pain killers such as opioids are also widely abused - often to soften the crash after taking stimulants, drug addicts and counselors said."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"Drug charges in the industry town of Midland more than doubled between 2012 and 2016, to 942 from 491, according to police data. In neighboring Odessa, total drug arrests doubled between 2010 and 2016, to 1291 from 756, according to Odessa Police Department data."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"The increase in drug crime stretched through two boom periods in the West Texas oil patch, before and after a crude price crash that hit in 2014."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"Oil companies typically drug test job applicants and often conduct additional random tests on employees. For truck drivers and those involved with hazardous materials, tests are also conducted under federal programs run by the U.S. Department of Transportation."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,Several oil firms with major operations in the Permian Basin declined to discuss how they handle drugs in the oil patch or did not respond to inquiries.
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"Schlumberger NV , Halliburton Co and Exxon Mobil Corp declined to comment. Exxon referred Reuters to its alcohol and drug policy."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,Pioneer Natural Resources Co. and ConocoPhillips did not respond to requests for comment.
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"The American Petroleum Institute, an industry trade group, declined to comment."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"Despite corporate and regulatory efforts to curb drug abuse, many oilfield workers regularly use stimulants on long shifts of grueling work for relatively high pay, said drug counselors, local law enforcement officials and oil field workers recovering from addictions."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"More than a third of clients at Midland's Springboard drug rehabilitation center are currently involved in the oil and gas industry, said Executive Director Steve Thomason."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"Rising oil prices have brought more admissions for methamphetamine abuse, Thomason said."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"""People say they can work on it for 24 hours straight,"" he said."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"Long shifts are common in the oil industry because expensive drilling equipment, often leased at high daily rates, runs through the night, and workers often have to commute to wells in remote locations. Most oil producers subcontract oilfield services to smaller companies that are not unionized."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"Springboard's admissions of methamphetamine users went up 20 percent in the first six months of this year compared with the last half of 2016, he said. The number of rigs operating in the Permian Basin increased more than 38 percent during the same period, according to data from energy services firm Baker Hughes ."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"Corporal Steve LeSueur, a spokesman for the Odessa police, said the influx of drugs in the oil patch is stretching police resources."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"In 2016, Shawn Pinson, an employee of a well construction company, was convicted of murdering an acquaintance following a drug-related dispute."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"The murder occurred around the same time he was arrested for possession of methamphetamine, police records show. The victim tested positive for meth at the time of the murder, according to an autopsy."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"At his trial, witnesses close to Pinson testified he had become addicted to methamphetamine while working in the oilfield, according to a prosecutor and a defense attorney involved in the case."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"Pinson did not respond to a letter seeking comment and his current attorney, Michele Greene, did not respond to a request for comment."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"When oil jobs are plentiful, companies desperate for labor sometimes will disregard signs of substance abuse, said three recovering drug addicts who worked in the oilfield."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"""These oilfield bosses - they party, too,"" Forsythe said. ""As long as you're getting the job done and not making a scene, they won't drug test you."""
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"One recovering addict, who declined to use his name because he still works in the industry, said he was often high during long-haul trips driving trucks transporting oil."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"""I could do a little coke and speed and it would give me the extra stretch,"" he said. ""It ended up running me to the ground."""

ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"{{20170907T084646.634+0000}}Meth, coke and oil: A drug boom in the Texas shale patchBy Liz Hampton"
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"MIDLAND, Texas, Sept 7 (Reuters) - When Joe Forsythe returned to the West Texas oilfields last year after a stint in a drug rehab facility, he figured he had beaten his addiction to methamphetamine."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,The 32-year-old rig worker and equipment handler lasted about a year before relapsing.
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"""It's easy to get back into that mentality,"" said Forsythe, of Midland, Texas, who said he no longer uses drugs after several stints in rehab since 2015. ""I'd work 24 hours ... I was just plagued with fatigue and needed something to improve my work ethic."""
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"Forsythe's experience and others like it reflect a painful flipside of the nation's shale oil boom - a parallel increase in substance abuse, drug crime and related social ills."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"While drug use is a problem among industrial workers nationwide, it raises particular concern in the oil patch as U.S. production surges to record levels in what is already one of the nation's most dangerous sectors - with a fatality rate about three times the average for other industries, according to 2015 federal statistics."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"Drug use is a significant factor in workplace injuries and crimes involving oilfield workers, according to drug counselors, hospital and police officials and court records in West Texas, the epicenter of the U.S. shale sector."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"As the shale revolution has spawned waves of hiring here since 2010, law enforcement authorities have tracked a boom in drug trafficking and related crime. In Midland and Ector counties, home to many Permian Basin oil workers, state and local police in 2016 seized more than 95 pounds of methamphetamine - up from less than four pounds in 2010."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"Meth and cocaine are stimulants of choice in the oil patch to get though long oilfield shifts, but alcohol and pain killers such as opioids are also widely abused - often to soften the crash after taking stimulants, drug addicts and counselors said."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"Drug charges in the industry town of Midland more than doubled between 2012 and 2016, to 942 from 491, according to police data. In neighboring Odessa, total drug arrests doubled between 2010 and 2016, to 1291 from 756, according to Odessa Police Department data."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"The increase in drug crime stretched through two boom periods in the West Texas oil patch, before and after a crude price crash that hit in 2014."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"Oil companies typically drug test job applicants and often conduct additional random tests on employees. For truck drivers and those involved with hazardous materials, tests are also conducted under federal programs run by the U.S. Department of Transportation."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,Several oil firms with major operations in the Permian Basin declined to discuss how they handle drugs in the oil patch or did not respond to inquiries.
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"Schlumberger NV , Halliburton Co and Exxon Mobil Corp declined to comment. Exxon referred Reuters to its alcohol and drug policy."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,Pioneer Natural Resources Co. and ConocoPhillips did not respond to requests for comment.
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"The American Petroleum Institute, an industry trade group, declined to comment."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"Despite corporate and regulatory efforts to curb drug abuse, many oilfield workers regularly use stimulants on long shifts of grueling work for relatively high pay, said drug counselors, local law enforcement officials and oil field workers recovering from addictions."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"More than a third of clients at Midland's Springboard drug rehabilitation center are currently involved in the oil and gas industry, said Executive Director Steve Thomason."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"Rising oil prices have brought more admissions for methamphetamine abuse, Thomason said."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"""People say they can work on it for 24 hours straight,"" he said."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"Long shifts are common in the oil industry because expensive drilling equipment, often leased at high daily rates, runs through the night, and workers often have to commute to wells in remote locations. Most oil producers subcontract oilfield services to smaller companies that are not unionized."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"Springboard's admissions of methamphetamine users went up 20 percent in the first six months of this year compared with the last half of 2016, he said. The number of rigs operating in the Permian Basin increased more than 38 percent during the same period, according to data from energy services firm Baker Hughes ."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"Corporal Steve LeSueur, a spokesman for the Odessa police, said the influx of drugs in the oil patch is stretching police resources."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"In 2016, Shawn Pinson, an employee of a well construction company, was convicted of murdering an acquaintance following a drug-related dispute."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"The murder occurred around the same time he was arrested for possession of methamphetamine, police records show. The victim tested positive for meth at the time of the murder, according to an autopsy."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"At his trial, witnesses close to Pinson testified he had become addicted to methamphetamine while working in the oilfield, according to a prosecutor and a defense attorney involved in the case."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"Pinson did not respond to a letter seeking comment and his current attorney, Michele Greene, did not respond to a request for comment."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"When oil jobs are plentiful, companies desperate for labor sometimes will disregard signs of substance abuse, said three recovering drug addicts who worked in the oilfield."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"""These oilfield bosses - they party, too,"" Forsythe said. ""As long as you're getting the job done and not making a scene, they won't drug test you."""
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"One recovering addict, who declined to use his name because he still works in the industry, said he was often high during long-haul trips driving trucks transporting oil."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"""I could do a little coke and speed and it would give me the extra stretch,"" he said. ""It ended up running me to the ground."""

ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"OSLO, Sept 5 (Reuters) - Norway's government plans to make taxpayers rather than oil companies pay special U.N. fees for any offshore production from remote Arctic regions, according to letters sent to oil firms and seen by Reuters."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,The plan could serve as an example for other nations looking to fund exploration of the seabed ever further from land.
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"It was criticised by opposition parties that want tighter limits on exploration in the fragile Arctic environment, days before an election in which the future of Norway's big offshore oil and gas sector is a major issue."

ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"""Neither me, nor the committee were informed about this,"" he said of the plans, outlined in letters provided to Reuters by the Oil and Energy Ministry, for implementing a dormant provision of the 1982 U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"Under Article 82 of the treaty, rich nations are due to pay up to 7 percent a year of the value of any production -- of oil, gas or other minerals -- from their continental shelves more than 200 nautical miles (370 km) from land to a fund to help developing nations."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,The money would be channelled to poor nations via the United Nations' International Seabed Authority in Jamaica. The mechanism is untested as there is no production so far offshore.
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"The Oil and Energy Ministry included a warning about Article 82 when it offered parts of the Arctic Barents Sea, more than 200 nautical miles from land, for exploration in the latest licensing round awarded in 2016."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"""The licensees could be required to cover certain costs in this connection,"" it wrote in the letters to oil companies. ""Any such cost will be deductible in the calculation of the petroleum tax."""

ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"Last month, Statoil and partners Chevron, ConocoPhillips , Lundin Petroleum , and Petoro drilled the first well in the Arctic Korpfjell prospect, 410 km from the nearest land."

ConocoPhillips,2017-9,He said it was reasonable to give oil companies tax breaks for taking on the risks of operating so far from land. Article 82 makes states responsible for payments but lets them decide how to raise the cash.
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"Rasmus Hansson, the only member of parliament for the opposition Green Party and a member of the Energy and Environment Committee, criticised the government plan."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"""This is yet another round of subsidising Norway's future contributions to global warming with taxpayers' money,"" he said."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"Environmental group Greenpeace also criticised the plan, saying that oil and gas in the high north was simply too risky. ""There is no anchor in the democratic process,"" said Truls Gulowsen, leader of Greenpeace Norway."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"Legal scholars say Article 82 is based on the idea that the high seas, owned by no nation, usually start 200 nautical miles offshore, the limit of each country's exclusive economic zone (EEZ)."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"Article 82 lets rich nations exploit resources beyond their EEZs in offshore areas where, such as in Arctic Norway, a shallow continental shelf extends beyond 200 nautical miles."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"Under Article 82, countries will have to start paying 1 percent of the value or volume of any production after five years, with the annual rate rising to a plateau of 7 percent after 12 years."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"Norway's parliament debated and ratified the Law of the Sea in 1996, and included an assessment that any application of Article 82 was unlikely to have a big economic impact."

ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"{{20170901T170706.289+0000}}U.S. drillers add no oil rigs as Hurricane Harvey slows production - Baker HughesNEW YORK, Sept 1 (Reuters) - U.S. energy firms did not add any oil rigs this week as Hurricane Harvey barrelled into the nation's energy heartland, forcing drillers to halt production and refiners to shut plants."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"The total oil rig count for the week ended Friday stayed at 759, General Electric Co's Baker Hughes energy services firm said in its report on Friday."
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,That compares with 407 active oil rigs during the same week a year ago. Drillers have added rigs in 56 of the past 67 weeks since the start of June 2016.
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,The rig count is an early indicator of future output.
ConocoPhillips,2017-9,"Hurricane Harvey has killed more than 40 people and brought record flooding to the U.S. oil heartland of Texas, paralyzing at least 4.4 million barrels per day (bpd) of refining capacity, according to company reports and Reuters estimates."
