ConocoPhillips,2017-1,"Australia has previously resisted renegotiating a permanent border but under pressure from the United Nations has agreed to enter talks with East Timor, which is desperate to see the Greater Sunrise field, in waters between the two countries, developed. [nL8N1CJ201]"
ConocoPhillips,2017-1,"East Timor and Australian officials met with an independent body tasked with finding a resolution earlier this month, where a timetable was agreed and possible areas of discussion were set out, a joint statement from the two countries and the Permanent Court of Arbitration said on Tuesday."
ConocoPhillips,2017-1,"The existing maritime boundary is aligned with Australia's continental shelf, but East Timor has long argued the border should lie half way between it and Australia - placing much of the Greater Sunrise fields under its control."
ConocoPhillips,2017-1,"""The Commission intends to do its utmost to help the parties reach an agreement that is both equitable and achievable,"" the joint statement said, referring to the Conciliation Commission."
ConocoPhillips,2017-1,"The long-running political dispute has led the owners of the Greater Sunrise fields - Woodside Petroleum , ConocoPhillips , Royal Dutch Shell and Japan's Osaka Gas <9532.T> - to shelve the project."
ConocoPhillips,2017-1,"The fields are estimated to hold 5.1 trillion cubic feet (144 billion cubic metres) of gas and 226 million barrels of condensate, which analysts have estimated could be worth $40 billion."
ConocoPhillips,2017-1,"Australia earlier this month agreed to allow East Timor to terminate an oil revenue sharing treaty between the two countries, while earlier treaties that govern production remain in place. [nL4N1EZ1OA]"
ConocoPhillips,2017-1,"East Timor has withdrawn legal proceedings it launched over the past few years against Australia challenging the validity of the Treaty on Certain Maritime Arrangements in the Timor Sea, to advance the conciliation process, the joint statement said."

ConocoPhillips,2017-1,"{{20170124T013829.643+0000}}Australia, East Timor aim to agree maritime border by SeptSYDNEY, Jan 24 (Reuters) - Australia and East Timor said on Tuesday they aim to reach an agreement on a maritime border by the end of September, which would end a decade-old row between the two nations that has stalled a $40 billion offshore gas project."
ConocoPhillips,2017-1,"Australia has previously resisted renegotiating a permanent border but under pressure from the United Nations has agreed to enter talks with East Timor, which is desperate to see the Greater Sunrise field, in waters between the two countries, developed. [nL8N1CJ201]"
ConocoPhillips,2017-1,"East Timor and Australian officials met with an independent body tasked with finding a resolution earlier this month, where a timetable was agreed and possible areas of discussion were set out, a joint statement from the two countries and the Permanent Court of Arbitration said on Tuesday."
ConocoPhillips,2017-1,"The existing maritime boundary is aligned with Australia's continental shelf, but East Timor has long argued the border should lie half way between it and Australia - placing much of the Greater Sunrise fields under its control."
ConocoPhillips,2017-1,"""The Commission intends to do its utmost to help the parties reach an agreement that is both equitable and achievable,"" the joint statement said, referring to the Conciliation Commission."
ConocoPhillips,2017-1,"The long-running political dispute has led the owners of the Greater Sunrise fields - Woodside Petroleum , ConocoPhillips , Royal Dutch Shell and Japan's Osaka Gas <9532.T> - to shelve the project."
ConocoPhillips,2017-1,"The fields are estimated to hold 5.1 trillion cubic feet (144 billion cubic metres) of gas and 226 million barrels of condensate, which analysts have estimated could be worth $40 billion."
ConocoPhillips,2017-1,"Australia earlier this month agreed to allow East Timor to terminate an oil revenue sharing treaty between the two countries, while earlier treaties that govern production remain in place. [nL4N1EZ1OA]"
ConocoPhillips,2017-1,"East Timor has withdrawn legal proceedings it launched over the past few years against Australia challenging the validity of the Treaty on Certain Maritime Arrangements in the Timor Sea, to advance the conciliation process, the joint statement said."

ConocoPhillips,2017-1,"STAVANGER, Norway, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Oil and gas output from Western Europe's top producer Norway will be higher than previously expected in 2017 and 2018 following above-forecast output last year, the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate (NPD) predicted on Thursday."
ConocoPhillips,2017-1,At the same time the regulator cut its forecast for the industry's investments in 2017 and said it would continue to decline in 2018 before a predicted rebound the following year.
ConocoPhillips,2017-1,"Oil production for 2017 is now expected to hit 93.9 million cubic metres, corresponding to 1.62 million barrels per day and in line with 2016, against a year-ago forecast that output would fall to 87.3 million cubic metres in the current year."
ConocoPhillips,2017-1,"Gas production for 2017 is seen at 114.5 billion cubic metres (bcm), down from 116.8 bcm in 2016, but much higher than the forecast a year ago of 107.9 bcm."
ConocoPhillips,2017-1,"NPD said forecasts were revised up because the fields, through efficiency measures, particularly within drilling of wells and regularity on the facilities, produced more than previously presumed."
ConocoPhillips,2017-1,"The directorate also expects several projects to start production earlier than previously anticipated, it added."

ConocoPhillips,2017-1,"{{20170109T073910.410+0000}}Australia bows to East Timor to kill controversial gas field treatySYDNEY, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Australia on Monday agreed to let East Timor terminate an oil revenue treaty between the two neighbours, a key step towards ending a maritime border dispute that has prevented the development of a $40 billion offshore gas field."
ConocoPhillips,2017-1,"Ending years of opposition, Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said Australia would accept Dili's formal notice to terminate the agreement to split petroleum revenue equally from the Greater Sunrise fields and set a 50-year timetable for negotiating a permanent sea boundary."
ConocoPhillips,2017-1,"East Timor had sought for years to terminate the agreement, after allegations Australia bugged the tiny Pacific Island nation during treaty discussions in 2004. Australia has never admitted nor denied the allegations."
ConocoPhillips,2017-1,"Dili took the dispute to the Permanent Court of Arbitration, which ordered compulsory arbitration between the two last September. [nL8N1CJ201]"
ConocoPhillips,2017-1,"""The governments of Timor-Leste and Australia look forward to continuing to engage with the Conciliation Commission and to the eventual conclusion of an agreement on maritime boundaries in the Timor Sea,"" the two countries said in a statement on Monday."
ConocoPhillips,2017-1,"The existing maritime boundary is aligned with Australia's continental shelf, but East Timor has long argued the border should lie half way between it and Australia and put more of the Greater Sunrise field under its jurisdiction."
ConocoPhillips,2017-1,"The political dispute had led the owners of the Greater Sunrise fields -- Woodside Petroleum , ConocoPhillips , Royal Dutch Shell and Japan's Osaka Gas <9532.T> -- to shelve the project."
ConocoPhillips,2017-1,"The fields are estimated to hold 5.1 trillion cubic feet of gas and 226 million barrels of condensates, which analysts have estimated could be worth $40 billion."
ConocoPhillips,2017-1,"""We look forward to an agreement that allows for the earliest commercialisation of the Greater Sunrise fields, which promise great benefits for all parties,"" Woodside, the operator of the project, said in an emailed statement."
ConocoPhillips,2017-1,"Earlier treaties that established a joint petroleum development area with revenue split 90 percent to East Timor and 10 percent to Australia, which govern production from the Bayu-Undan field run by ConocoPhillips, will remain in place."

ConocoPhillips,2017-1,"WASHINGTON, Jan 3 (Reuters) - Big Oil could be in a unique position to protect its interests against a Republican proposal to tax imports, given that President-elect Donald Trump's cabinet is studded with oil champions sensitive to the risk of higher gasoline prices."
ConocoPhillips,2017-1,"Trump's emerging leadership includes Exxon Mobil Corp Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson as secretary of state, former Texas Governor Rick Perry as energy secretary and Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt as Environmental Protection Agency administrator."
ConocoPhillips,2017-1,Trump himself has made no secret of his support for the energy sector.
ConocoPhillips,2017-1,"And in Congress, both Republicans and Democrats have close industry ties, including House tax panel chairman Kevin Brady, a Texas Republican whose district takes in the northern Houston suburbs."
ConocoPhillips,2017-1,House Republicans want to adopt a sweeping tax reform that would sharply reduce tax rates for corporations and end the taxation of U.S. corporate overseas profits.
ConocoPhillips,2017-1,"But a provision known as border adjustability is stirring up controversy. Though intended to boost U.S. manufacturing by exempting export revenues from tax, the provision worries some industries because it would also tax imports. [nL1N1EA1I8]"
ConocoPhillips,2017-1,"Because U.S. oil refiners import about half the crude oil they use to make gasoline, diesel and other products, analysts say the change could lead to higher gasoline prices and potentially undermine economic growth."
ConocoPhillips,2017-1,"Integrated oil companies such as Exxon, Chevron Corp , BP Plc and Royal Dutch Shell Plc could also be hit, depending on whether they are net importers."
ConocoPhillips,2017-1,"But the industry's allies would likely move to soften any rough edges, analysts say."
ConocoPhillips,2017-1,"""I don't see this mix of leadership figures in the House, Senate and the White House, doing something that has the effect of raising gasoline prices,"" said Peter Cohn, an energy analyst with Height Securities, a Washington-based investment firm."
ConocoPhillips,2017-1,"The danger is that a move to protect the oil refiners could open the door to assistance for other industries, including retailers and automakers, which would also face higher costs if no longer able to deduct the cost of imports from their taxable income."
ConocoPhillips,2017-1,Such a knock-on effect could prevent border adjustability from raising an expected $1 trillion in revenues to help pay for lower tax rates over the next decade.
ConocoPhillips,2017-1,"""We hope that raising these concerns early in the process will allow members of Congress to consider the issues carefully,"" Chet Thompson, president of the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers trade group, said in a statement."
ConocoPhillips,2017-1,"Brady said earlier this month that his committee was sensitive to the impact on specific businesses and ""listening very closely to how we can make sure we smooth that out."" [nL1N1E92CK]"
ConocoPhillips,2017-1,"Moreover, some economists dismiss industry worries about higher import costs, saying the dollar's value would rise in response to such sweeping tax changes and ultimately reduce the cost of imports. Currency markets would adjust to higher oil prices by lowering the dollar value of crude, they predict."
ConocoPhillips,2017-1,"""This argument by the oil industry is, frankly, all wrong,"" said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, former director of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, who now heads the American Action Forum think tank."
ConocoPhillips,2017-1,"""Refiners are going to be basically held harmless. They'll have a lower dollar price of oil. Net cost is the same. And they go about their business. I'm unsympathetic,"" he added."
ConocoPhillips,2017-1,"Height Securities' Cohn said Trump and his advisers could look for ways to soften any blow to refiners and their customers: ""Trump doesn't want to have refineries closing on his watch."""
ConocoPhillips,2017-1,Oil already benefits from several tax code provisions in place for decades that would be eliminated under the House Republican plan. But they stand to gain more than they will lose.
ConocoPhillips,2017-1,"For instance, an existing tax deduction for domestic production lets oil producers shave down their corporate tax rate to 32 percent from the top headline rate of 35 percent. Under the congressional Republicans' plan, the corporate rate would be cut to 20 percent; under Trump's plan, to 15 percent."
ConocoPhillips,2017-1,"Similarly, companies that now write off intangible drilling costs or get a tax allowance for asset depletion would be able to immediately expense capital investments."
ConocoPhillips,2017-1,"Then there is a tax credit oil companies claim for fees from foreign countries. Congressional Republicans would eliminate foreign taxes altogether, while Trump would maintain taxation at a substantially lower rate."
ConocoPhillips,2017-1,Statoil to drill high-impact well near Russian border in summer - Reuters News
ConocoPhillips,2017-1,"{{20170104T160334.973+0000}}Statoil to drill high-impact well near Russian border in summerOSLO, Jan 4 (Reuters) - Norway's Statoil will know by autumn whether it has made a significant oil discovery in the Barents Sea close to the Russian border, its exploration chief Tim Dodson said on Wednesday."
ConocoPhillips,2017-1,"This year the company plans to drill six so-called high-impact wells, meaning each could hold more than 250 million barrels of oil equivalent, including three in the Barents Sea."
ConocoPhillips,2017-1,"One of the planned wells is the Korpfjell prospect in the northernmost license awarded on the Norwegian continental shelf, close to Russia's Perseevsky block which Statoil has agreed to explore with Rosneft ."
ConocoPhillips,2017-1,"""Korpfjell is a large structure with a very significant potential, but there are lots of uncertainties,"" Dodson told Reuters. The first well will be drilled in late summer."
ConocoPhillips,2017-1,"""It should be a quick well...We should know some results by autumn,"" he added."
ConocoPhillips,2017-1,"Other partners in the Statoil-operated field are Chevron , Petoro, Lundin and ConocoPhillips ."
ConocoPhillips,2017-1,"Dodson said seismic data showed that while the structure was close to the Russian border, it was entirely located in Norwegian waters."
ConocoPhillips,2017-1,"However, the Korpfjell drilling results could give an indication of the potential on the other side of the border, he added."
ConocoPhillips,2017-1,"Statoil and Rosneft signed an agreement in 2012 to jointly explore offshore frontier areas in Norway and Russia, but plans were put on hold due to Western sanctions imposed on Moscow over the conflict in Ukraine."
ConocoPhillips,2017-1,"Dodson said Statoil had no immediate plans to drill offshore Russia, although the partners in Perseevsky were required to start drilling no later than 2019."
ConocoPhillips,2017-1,"Statoil does however plan to drill one or two onshore wells in Russia this winter, also in partnership with Rosneft, he added."
ConocoPhillips,2017-1,"The Norwegian company said earlier on Wednesday it planned to drill some 30 wells in 11 countries this year, including Britain, Brazil, the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and Indonesia, up from 23 wells in 2016.[nFWN1EU03X]"
