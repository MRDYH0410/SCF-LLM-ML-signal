General Electric,2017-6,"{{20170628T040002.785+0000}}JPMorgan Chase to centralize energy controls for 4,500 branchesNEW YORK, June 28 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co is shifting control of heating, air-conditioning and lighting in 4,500 of its branches to an operations center hosted in the internet cloud."
General Electric,2017-6,"Sol Gindi, chief administrative officer for JPMorgan's consumer bank, said the company is making the change so that bank branch managers and loan officers can do their jobs instead of adjusting thermostats and keeping track of replacing light bulbs before they burn out."
General Electric,2017-6,"The move is expected to reduce energy consumption in the branches by 15 percent, Gindi told Reuters on Tuesday."
General Electric,2017-6,"""To operate in the most efficient way, we have to be centralized and automated,"" he said."
General Electric,2017-6,"The energy and lighting management will be done by General Electric Co using sensors in branches across the United States and linked by the internet to computers. The work also includes managing water for irrigation of landscapes, as well as a pilot installation of solar panels at California branches."
General Electric,2017-6,GE last year got the job of replacing old light bulbs in Chase branches with more energy efficient LED bulbs.
General Electric,2017-6,"Chase has another 700 branches that are not included in the plan for various reasons, including locations in buildings that are leased or not suited to the new controls."
General Electric,2017-6,"The actions could save roughly $20 million a year - tiny compared with JPMorgan's $58 billion of company-wide expenses. More valuable, Gindi said, is supporting branch employees in their jobs and keeping customers comfortable."

General Electric,2017-6,{{20170626T150310.358+0000}}AIRSHOW-New Boeing bosses target more wins after Paris plane launch* Boeing beat Airbus at air show after launching new jet
General Electric,2017-6,"PARIS, June 26 (Reuters) - Boeing's new commercial management has signalled a determination to win back market share with a combative new style, swapping traits with an unusually sombre Airbus after winning the Paris Airshow with a slick launch for its new 737 MAX 10 jet."
General Electric,2017-6,A carefully packaged week of announcements created momentum that Boeing has struggled to display in recent years after being outmanoeuvred for sales of single-aisle planes since the pair decided to upgrade their best-selling models early this decade.
General Electric,2017-6,"Boeing has seen its market share fall from 50 percent to around 42 percent for the latest models, partly because the Airbus A320 family's design allowed it to use a larger version of the latest generation of engines, which helps in some cases."
General Electric,2017-6,"It was the first show in their respective roles for ex-General Electric executive Kevin McAllister, the first outsider hired to run Boeing's commercial division, and Ihssane Mounir, recently made sales chief after fighting Airbus in North Asia."
General Electric,2017-6,"Its outcome reflects a ""more aggressive marketing strategy"" at the U.S. company, Jefferies analyst Howard Rubel wrote in a note."
General Electric,2017-6,"Boeing got 361 orders and commitments for the 737 MAX 10 from 16 customers, including 147 incremental ones. Reuters had reported it would win close to 150 incremental orders."
General Electric,2017-6,"""It's a fightback. It goes back to (McAllister's predecessor) Ray Conner's recent talk about winning markets,"" said Nick Cunningham, analyst at UK-based Agency Partners."
General Electric,2017-6,"""The battle showed itself in price and is now beginning to show itself in products."""
General Electric,2017-6,"Boeing's energy contrasted with a flatter tone than usual from Airbus, even though it too won more orders than expected."
General Electric,2017-6,"It suggests Boeing will be looking to maintain last week's momentum as it tries to poach Airbus customers without the previous disadvantage of an uneven portfolio dependent mainly on the smaller MAX 8, industry sources said."
General Electric,2017-6,That could result in bruising battles as Boeing's fired-up new management targets Airbus customers while working on a separate new mid-sized aircraft project for next decade.
General Electric,2017-6,"Its executives painted the 737 MAX 10 as something forced on Boeing to defend a weak market share, and highlighted the more than 200 conversions to 737 MAX 10s from existing Boeing orders. Some questioned whether all buyers would stick with the model."
General Electric,2017-6,"""It was a good PR exercise. I am not so sure if there was as much quality or substance to they deals they did at the air show,"" said Kiran Rao, recently designated as successor to Airbus sales chief John Leahy, who retires this year."
General Electric,2017-6,"Analyst Scott Hamilton of Leeham News played down Airbus's objection about conversions, saying switching up in size is standard and noting the important backing of United Airlines for the new Boeing model."
General Electric,2017-6,"Still, industry sources said Boeing's decision to launch the 737 MAX 10, seating up to 230 people, was a twin defensive move."
General Electric,2017-6,"Most attention focused on Boeing's need to fix a gap in seats at the top end of its single-aisle portfolio against the A321neo, which Airbus says can seat up to 240 people."
General Electric,2017-6,"Industry sources say it had grown increasingly worried about losing sales of its main cash cow, the MAX 8, through the back door because of interlocking relationships between models."
General Electric,2017-6,Alarm bells began ringing at the same air show two years ago when Korean Air <003490.KS> split a $6.9 billion order for narrow-body jets between the A321neo and Boeing 737 MAX 8.
General Electric,2017-6,"The success of the A321neo created the threat that Boeing customers who needed a high proportion of the larger category in their fleets could pick the A321neo, and then take the 150-seat A320neo by default to avoid the inefficiency of two types."
General Electric,2017-6,"Airbus says the A321neo size will make up half the single- aisle market, worth $3 trillion over 20 years."
General Electric,2017-6,"But even at Boeing's lower estimate, the success of the A321neo handed Airbus a powerful lever to make inroads into the rest of Boeing's fleet and damage its biggest-selling product."
General Electric,2017-6,"""It was a threat. Boeing needed to defend the 737 MAX 8,"" a senior aircraft leasing company executive said."
General Electric,2017-6,"The grab for market share, which began under soon-to-retire Boeing vice chairman Ray Conner, who handed the commercial unit to McAllister in November, still leaves Boeing trailing Airbus."
General Electric,2017-6,"""It improves the 737's competitive position but does not resolve it entirely,"" Cunningham said."
General Electric,2017-6,Mounir rejected a suggestion that Boeing had approached the air show in the spirit of 'attack is the best form of defence'.
General Electric,2017-6,"""We are playing offence; this was offence,"" he told Reuters."

General Electric,2017-6,"LONDON, June 24 (Reuters) - British investigators said on Friday they would consider manslaughter charges over the London tower block fire that killed at least 79 people, as thousands of apartment-dwellers a few miles away were told to leave their homes due to fire risk."
General Electric,2017-6,"The outside cladding engulfed in June 14's deadly blaze has since been shown to fail all safety tests, police said. They have already seized material from a number of undisclosed organisations."
General Electric,2017-6,"Fire safety checks are now taking place on public buildings across Britain. Late on Friday, one municipal authority in north London began to evacuate nearly 4,000 people from five tower blocks after firefighters said it was unsafe for them to stay."
General Electric,2017-6,"Detective Superintendent Fiona McCormack said experts had now concluded that the earlier fire, the mostly deadly blaze in London since World War Two, had started in a fridge freezer."
General Electric,2017-6,"The blaze has provoked anger and heaped pressure on Prime Minister Theresa May, who is fighting for her political survival after her party lost its parliamentary majority in a snap election at a time when Britain is beginning divorce talks with the European Union. [nL8N1JK1RQ]"
General Electric,2017-6,The speed at which the fire engulfed the 24-storey Grenfell Tower raised questions about the external cladding on the block.
General Electric,2017-6,"Asked if the insulation and aluminium tiles used were acceptable for such buildings, McCormack told reporters: ""No they're not."""
General Electric,2017-6,"""All I can say at the moment is they don't pass any of the safety tests. So that will form part of what is a manslaughter investigation."""
General Electric,2017-6,"As well as possible manslaughter, police will consider health and safety offences and breaches of other building regulations. McCormack said all companies involved in the building and refurbishment of the building would be reviewed."
General Electric,2017-6,"Britain also ordered an immediate technical examination of the Hotpoint fridge model FF175BP, which had not been subject to any recall to establish whether further action should be taken, but said there was no need for owners to switch off their appliances."
General Electric,2017-6,"Whirlpool's shared closed down 3.3 percent on Friday, wiping almost $500 million off the company's value."
General Electric,2017-6,"Whirlpool owns the Hotpoint brand in the Europe and Asia Pacific regions. In the United States, the Hotpoint brand now belongs to Haier, following the Chinese group's purchase of General Electric Co's appliance business."
General Electric,2017-6,"""We are working with the authorities to obtain access to the appliance so that we can assist with the ongoing investigations,"" said Whirlpool, the world's largest maker of home appliances."
General Electric,2017-6,"""Words cannot express our sorrow at this terrible tragedy,"" Whirlpool said in a statement."
General Electric,2017-6,"The company said 64,000 such fridge freezers were made by Indesit between 2006 and 2009 when the model was discontinued, some years before Whirlpool acquired Indesit."
General Electric,2017-6,"The fire has acted as a focal point for anger at local authority funding cuts and, if more buildings are deemed unsafe, the government faces the task of rehousing people within existing social housing facilities which are stretched."
General Electric,2017-6,"The government said it was urgently conducting tests on some 600 high-rise buildings in England which have exterior cladding, often added to insulate them or improve the external appearance of ageing blocks. Some councils have begun removing the panels."
General Electric,2017-6,"May, who faced criticism for slow public reaction to the fire, said on Twitter that her thoughts were with the 800 households being evacuated from a group of tower blocks in north London on Friday evening."
General Electric,2017-6,Residents complained of first hearing about the evacuation from the media and getting very short notice to leave from city officials going door to door.
General Electric,2017-6,"""It was farcical communication. You don't get everyone to leave this quickly,"" 21-year-old Daniel Tackaberry told Reuters outside a nearby sports centre where the local council had laid out air beds for people for whom they could not find hotels."
General Electric,2017-6,"Broadcaster Sky News showed one resident, Abdul, who has cerebral palsy and uses a wheelchair, who said he had been told there was no hotel for him and he had to stay on an air bed."
General Electric,2017-6,"The council's leader, Georgia Gould, said in a statement outside the council's offices that it would take up to four weeks to repair the blocks that were evacuated and later added in a radio interview that nearly 4,000 residents were affected."
General Electric,2017-6,"Ed Miliband, the former leader of the opposition Labour Party, said on Twitter that May should have convened a central government emergency committee to assist the local council."
General Electric,2017-6,"Grenfell Tower, in west London, had undergone an 8.7 million pound ($11 million) refurbishment that was completed in 2016, but residents of the more than 120 apartments had complained about its fire safety."
General Electric,2017-6,"McCormack said the police investigation would look at the entire facade of the building, how the building was constructed and the refurbishment work. She said it would examine all aspects of the cladding: the aluminium tiles, the insulation behind it, how it was fitted to building and the installation."
General Electric,2017-6,"In addition to the criminal investigation, police and firefighters were continuing painstaking efforts to locate the victims. So far only nine people have been formally identified and police said the remains of some might never be found, the blaze having been so fierce."
General Electric,2017-6,Some residents believe the official number of the dead or missing presumed dead was lower than the true figure. McCormack acknowledged they might not know everyone who was in the building as some people might fear coming forward because they were in the country illegally.
General Electric,2017-6,She said the government had given assurances they were not interested in anyone's immigration status.
General Electric,2017-6,"""I remain really concerned though that we do not have a complete picture,"" she said. ""I fear that there are more."""

General Electric,2017-6,"FRANKFURT, June 23 (Reuters) - General Electric has won a large contract to supply gas power equipment for a new 430 megawatt Romanian power plant, the first major deal in the region to result from its $10.6 billion 2015 acquisition of Alstom's power business."

General Electric,2017-6,"June 23 (Reuters) - In today's U.S. shale fields, tiny sensors attached to production gear harvest data on everything from pumping pressure to the heat and rotational speed of drill bits boring into the rocky earth."
General Electric,2017-6,"The sensors are leading Big Oil's mining of so-called big data, with some firms envisioning billions of dollars in savings over time by avoiding outages, managing supplies and identifying safety hazards."
General Electric,2017-6,The industry has long used sophisticated technologies to find oil and gas. But only recently have oil firms pooled data from across the company for wider operating efficiencies - one of many cost-cutting efforts spurred by the two-year downturn in crude oil prices.
General Electric,2017-6,ConocoPhillips says that sensors scattered across its well fields helped it halve the time it once took to drill new wells in Eagle Ford shale basin of South Texas.
General Electric,2017-6,"By comparing data from hundreds of sensors, its program automatically adjusts the weight placed on a drill bit and its speed, accelerating the extraction of oil, said Matt Fox, ConocoPhillips' executive vice president for strategy, exploration and technology."
General Electric,2017-6,"It is just one application, but if applied to the more than 3,000 wells ConocoPhillips hopes to drill in the Texas basin, those small sensors could lead to ""billions and billions of dollars"" in savings, Fox said in an interview."

General Electric,2017-6,"June 23 (Reuters) - In today's U.S. shale fields, tiny sensors attached to production gear harvest data on everything from pumping pressure to the heat and rotational speed of drill bits boring into the rocky earth."
General Electric,2017-6,"The sensors are leading Big Oil's mining of so-called big data, with some firms envisioning billions of dollars in savings over time by avoiding outages, managing supplies and identifying safety hazards."
General Electric,2017-6,The industry has long used sophisticated technologies to find oil and gas. But only recently have oil firms pooled data from across the company for wider operating efficiencies - one of many cost-cutting efforts spurred by the two-year downturn in crude oil prices.
General Electric,2017-6,ConocoPhillips says that sensors scattered across its well fields helped it halve the time it once took to drill new wells in Eagle Ford shale basin of South Texas.
General Electric,2017-6,"By comparing data from hundreds of sensors, its program automatically adjusts the weight placed on a drill bit and its speed, accelerating the extraction of oil, said Matt Fox, ConocoPhillips' executive vice president for strategy, exploration and technology."
General Electric,2017-6,"It is just one application, but if applied to the more than 3,000 wells ConocoPhillips hopes to drill in the Texas basin, those small sensors could lead to ""billions and billions of dollars"" in savings, Fox said in an interview."

General Electric,2017-6,{{20170621T143219.879+0000}}AIRSHOW-Lockheed upbeat on foreign sales prospects of CH-53K helicopterBy Andrea Shalal
General Electric,2017-6,"PARIS, June 21 (Reuters) - Lockheed Martin Corp sees strong export prospects for the CH-53K heavy-lift helicopter it is building for the U.S. Marine Corps, it said on Wednesday, citing interest from Germany and Israel and potentially Japan in coming years."
General Electric,2017-6,"Dan Schultz, president of Lockheed's Sikorsky helicopter unit, said the CH-53K King Stallion was performing better than expected in testing and had been approved by the Pentagon for full-rate production ahead of schedule. The Marines expect to declare the CH-53K ready for combat use in 2019."
General Electric,2017-6,"""Everybody needs heavier-lift helicopters,"" Schultz, who flew earlier model CH-53 helicopters while serving in the Marines, told reporters at the Paris Airshow."
General Electric,2017-6,"Schultz declined to estimate how many additional CH-53K helicopters could be sold beyond the 200 aircraft to be bought by the Marines, but industry sources say another 100 aircraft could be sold to U.S. allies and potentially the U.S. Navy."
General Electric,2017-6,"The German defence ministry is expected later this month or early next to take the first step in an acquisition process for a new heavy-lift helicopter that will pit the CH-53K against Boeing Co's CH-47 Chinook, a twin-engine helicopter that has been in production for decades. It would then release formal requirements next year and award a contract a year later."
General Electric,2017-6,"Schultz said the CH-53K was a new design that could carry inside an entire pallet or Humvee, a big advantage over earlier models, and 12,200 kg (27,000 lbs) externally - more than triple the external load carrying capacity of the predecessor CH-53E."
General Electric,2017-6,"He said the cost was currently around $88 million a copy, but Lockheed and the Navy were implementing steps to further lower costs. Foreign orders could also help drive down costs by increasing economic order quantities."
General Electric,2017-6,"Experts say the cost of the Chinook would be far lower to buy, but it would take more flights to accomplish the same mission, given its lower carrying capacity."
General Electric,2017-6,"Marine Corps Lieutenant Colonel Jonathan Morel, the government's chief test pilot for the aircraft, said pilots and maintainers were consulted heavily before Sikorsky began designing the helicopter, resulting in an aircraft that was much easier to fly and service than other helicopters."
General Electric,2017-6,"He said the Navy, which oversees Marine Corps aviation, was studying if it could save money and time by eliminating some test points no longer needed given the helicopter's strong performance."
General Electric,2017-6,"Germany's competition for around 40 aircraft is the first on the horizon, and both Lockheed and Boeing are trying to forge ties with German firms that could provide components for the helicopters, and work on maintenance in coming years."
General Electric,2017-6,"Israel has asked for pricing and availability for 20 aircraft, but could potentially order more, Schultz said."
General Electric,2017-6,"In coming years, Japan could also look at orders since it now operates an earlier CH-53 model, Schultz added."
General Electric,2017-6,"Gene Cunningham, vice president of global sales for Boeing's defence unit, said the CH-47 was a strong contender for the German competition, saying it helped meet Germany's desire for a low-risk, affordable solution."
General Electric,2017-6,"Other NATO allies include Britain, the Netherlands, Spain and Italy also operate Chinooks, so a decision to buy the CH-47 would make it easier for the German military to operate together with other militaries, Cunningham said in an interview."
General Electric,2017-6,"""That seems to be a big factor as well with the German government,"" Cunningham said. ""The high availability rate of the aircraft would assure the mission readiness of Germany as a partner."""

General Electric,2017-6,"WASHINGTON, June 21 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Donald Trump's CEOs are getting more listening practice than influence. The U.S. president loves to hobnob with corporate chiefs, but his meetings have been largely a one-way street. Executives can claim some impact on China policy but not yet on immigration, and they got stiffed on climate. The White House forums are still useful."
General Electric,2017-6,"U.S. leaders have long tapped CEOs for advice, but the self-styled CEO president has taken it to a new level. Trump attends each gathering for on-camera remarks and relishes chumming around with the likes of JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon, former GE chief Jeff Immelt and Blackstone CEO Steve Schwarzman. At a meeting of tech executives on Monday, Trump jovially claimed that since his election the stock market's capitalization had grown as much as the $3.5 trillion in value represented in the room."
General Electric,2017-6,"On issues where they agree, such as regulatory reform, there is a symbiotic relationship. The energy and financial sectors have applauded his push to overhaul rules overseeing their industries. The corporate world also supports tax reform. CEOs are urging the administration to not get bogged down by the details, such as a border adjustment tax."
General Electric,2017-6,"But on issues where they aren't already on the same page, Trump has gone his own way. The Paris climate accord was a stark example. Despite impassioned pleas by IBM's Ginni Rometty and others, Trump announced in June he was pulling out of the deal. Most CEOs stayed on his councils even though many criticized the Paris move."
General Electric,2017-6,"On immigration, Apple's Tim Cook on Monday pressed Trump on visas for highly skilled foreign workers. The president said he supports comprehensive immigration reform, but he also told corporate chiefs in April: ""We are going to be very, very careful on the environment."" The long-term fate of children of illegal immigrants in the Dreamers program, which is still under review, will be another test of CEO influence."
General Electric,2017-6,"They have made some progress in tempering the White House's views on a few issues, including on China. The administration has yet to follow through on imposing high tariffs on Beijing and declined to name it a currency manipulator."
General Electric,2017-6,"The CEO forums are still worth the time, given the insights gained into the administration's thinking. The White House views on tax reform, infrastructure spending and other issues help company chiefs and their clients prepare for them. It's a major reason to keep riding on the one-way street."
General Electric,2017-6,"- U.S. President Donald Trump met with executives in the technology sector on June 19 to discuss modernizing the government and reducing waste. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Apple CEO Tim Cook and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella were among the attendees. Several of the executives pressed Trump on the country's need for more highly skilled immigrants. The president ordered a review of visas for such foreign employees to curtail abuse and see if they are hurting American workers."
General Electric,2017-6,"- Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg was invited to the meeting but didn't attend due to a scheduling conflict, his company said. Tesla CEO Elon Musk dropped out of the technology council after Trump said on June 1 he was pulling the United States out of the Paris climate accord. Disney CEO Bob Iger quit another White House business advisory council because of the president's Paris decision."

General Electric,2017-6,{{20170620T110104.725+0000}}RPT-INSIGHT-Innovators toil to revive Canada oil sands as majors exit(Repeats without change)
General Electric,2017-6,"CALGARY, Alberta/HOUSTON, June 19 (Reuters) - In the boreal forests and on the remote prairies of Alberta, a handful of firms are running pilot projects they hope will end a two-decade drought in innovation and stem the exodus of top global energy firms from Canada's oil sands."
General Electric,2017-6,They are searching for a breakthrough that will cut the cost of pumping the tar-like oil from the country's vast underground bitumen reservoirs and better compete with the booming shale industry in the United States.
General Electric,2017-6,"If they fail, a bigger chunk of the world's third-largest oil reserves will stay in the ground. Canada's oil sands sector has become one of the biggest victims of the global oil price crash that began in 2014 when top OPEC producer Saudi Arabia flooded the market with cheap crude to drive out high cost competitors."
General Electric,2017-6,"This year alone, oil majors have sold over $22.5 billion of assets in Canada's energy industry, and been lured south to invest in the higher returns of U.S. shale."
General Electric,2017-6,"Joseph Kuhach is among the entrepreneurs in Canada hoping they can turn the tide. He runs a small Calgary-based firm, Nsolv, that is testing the use of solvents to liquefy the bitumen buried in the sands and make it flow as oil."
General Electric,2017-6,Kuhach says using solvents can cut 20 to 40 percent from the cost of producing the oil. The technique currently used is to use steam to heat the sands underground to extract the oil.
General Electric,2017-6,"It's a hard sell, he said, to Canadian producers struggling with low oil prices. They are reluctant to invest in a multi-million dollar technology that is unproven on a commercial scale, he said."
General Electric,2017-6,"""The comment I hear so often when I am talking to companies is, 'We want to be the very first in line to be second',"" said Kuhach. ""It's easier to go after incremental improvements that they can back away from with no great cost and no great risk."""
General Electric,2017-6,"Nsolv is winding down a three-year pilot project with Canada's second-largest energy producer Suncor Energy at its Dover oil sands lease in northern Alberta. Suncor is evaluating the results, the firm's spokeswoman Erin Rees said."
General Electric,2017-6,"Fourth-largest producer Imperial Oil , controlled by ExxonMobil Corp , is also developing solvent technology and has had an ongoing C$100-million pilot project since 2013, the company said."
General Electric,2017-6,"The caution of oil sands producers stems in part from the unique challenges of operating here, where projects take years to build and require billions of dollars in upfront capital."
General Electric,2017-6,"The development of the technique using steam two decades ago made Canada's sands the new frontier for the oil industry, and majors were among the firms that flocked to buy in."
General Electric,2017-6,"Since then, innovation has stalled. That failure, energy-industry entrepreneurs and venture capitalists told Reuters, is rooted in a risk-averse culture that has left oil sands years behind U.S. shale."
General Electric,2017-6,"The exodus of international oil firms such as Royal Dutch Shell and Statoil ASA from oil sands has made innovation tougher because there are fewer potential customers who might adopt new technology, said Joe Gasca, chairman of Fractal Systems Inc. His firm processes bitumen into higher-quality crude at the wellhead."
General Electric,2017-6,"Fractal is running a 1,000 barrel-per-day (bpd) test plant in eastern Alberta for third-largest producer Cenovus Energy , which has yet to make a decision on whether to proceed commercially."
General Electric,2017-6,"The shale sector moved fast to innovate and cut costs to survive the oil price crash. In 2014, producing oil from most shale fields cost more than the average $60 a barrel needed for a new Canadian oil sands project to make money. Now, there are some shale patches that can make a profit at $15 a barrel. [nL1N1DU2DQ]"
General Electric,2017-6,It takes months of pumping steam into underground reservoirs before bitumen starts to flow from the oil sands. That makes engineers reluctant to experiment with the delicate balance of heat and pressure.
General Electric,2017-6,"Shale, by contrast, provides comparatively fertile ground for innovation. The initial investment is a fraction of what the cost of an oil sands project. Relatively easy access encourages competition as the many firms involved look for an edge. Wells can be drilled quickly. The stakes are lower and the scale is smaller if experiments fail."
General Electric,2017-6,"Drilling longer wells and being better able to pinpoint where in those wells to fracture the rock, among other techniques, have supercharged U.S. shale output in the past two years. That has boosted firms including Noble Energy and Devon Energy and drawn billions of dollars in new private equity investment.[nL1N1HF0L2]"
General Electric,2017-6,"Canadian producers have fewer projects to experiment with and are unwilling to risk their massive upfront investments, said Steve Fisher, chief executive of Calgary-based startup Veerum."
General Electric,2017-6,"""Shale is like going on a date, the oil sands is like getting married,"" he said. ""The risk for capital is high in the oil sands, you have massive assets that need to complete on time and operate for 40 years to make money."""
General Electric,2017-6,"Veerum's technology cuts capital costs by tracking how accurately a new project sticks to design specifications during construction, reducing the need for costly fixes later."
General Electric,2017-6,"The company is supported by GE's Zone Startups Calgary, an incubator for new firms in the energy capital of Canada."
General Electric,2017-6,"Another hurdle to innovation is the lack of sales and marketing expertise in the city's oil industry to carry ideas through to commercial execution, said Marty Reed, chief executive of clean-tech fund Evok Innovations."
General Electric,2017-6,"""At $100 a barrel it didn't take a sales and marketing genius to sell the product,"" Reed said. ""But if you are a new company trying to get Suncor to adopt a new widget those skills are crucial."""
General Electric,2017-6,Evok was launched last year with a C$100 million investment from Cenovus and Suncor over 10 years to accelerate development of technologies to cut oil sands costs and emissions.
General Electric,2017-6,"Since oil prices began falling in 2014, the long-term forecast for oil sands output in 2030 has fallen to 3.7 million bpd, down from 5.2 million bpd, according to the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers. Current output is around 2.4 million bpd."
General Electric,2017-6,"Expansion will mostly come from adding units at existing projects, given new projects are unprofitable at current international oil prices of around $45 a barrel."
General Electric,2017-6,"Canadian oil sands producers recognize that innovation is crucial for their survival, and some firms are spending more."
General Electric,2017-6,"The country's top energy producer Canadian Natural Resources Ltd allocated C$549 million ($406.97 million) or 14 percent of its 2016 C$3.8 billion capital budget on research and development (R&D), up 4 percent from C$527 million in 2015, when capital spending was higher."
General Electric,2017-6,"""It's mostly about incremental gains, but we do have some big stuff that could change things,"" Canadian Natural President Steve Laut told reporters last month, declining to elaborate."
General Electric,2017-6,"Suncor and Imperial both held R&D spending steady from the previous year while reducing overall capital budgets. Suncor spent C$150 million, or 3 percent of its budget in 2016 on what it calls ""step-change technologies"", while Imperial spent C$195 million, roughly 17 percent of its budget, company filings showed."
General Electric,2017-6,The firms all said they were working on ways to reduce costs and environmental impact. Producers also said new technology is often developed in the field during normal operations and does not necessarily show up in R&D budgets.
General Electric,2017-6,"A number of producers, including Cenovus and Suncor are looking at ways to add solvents to steam in their commercial operations."
General Electric,2017-6,"Unlike the solvent-only technique being pitched by Nsolv, this would allow firms to adapt existing thermal plants rather than build new ones, Kuhach said."
General Electric,2017-6,"Even if pilot steam-and-solvent projects are successful, it would take another three to five years for the technology to spread across the industry, said Dan Wicklum, chief executive of the Canadian Oil Sands Innovation Alliance."
General Electric,2017-6,"Vancouver-based Chrysalix Venture Capital has become more cautious about new oil sands investments since the oil majors pulled out, Chief Executive Wal van Lierop said, but is investing in technologies that may prove valuable to the sector."
General Electric,2017-6,"""I am really hoping we can get breakthrough technologies, but I don't see them yet,"" he said."
General Electric,2017-6,"""Mediocracy will not help. It will be go big or go home."""

General Electric,2017-6,"MONTREAL, June 19 (Reuters) - Caisse de Depot et Placement du Quebec's [CDPDA.UL] chief executive said on Monday the Canadian fund's $2 billion investment with GE Capital Aviation in a new aircraft leasing entity could increase over time."
General Electric,2017-6,"Canada's second largest pension fund is putting up 90 percent of the equity, along with the debt for the entity, which will be operated by the commercial aircraft financing and leasing business of General Electric Co"
General Electric,2017-6,"""This platform, at $2 billion today, has the potential over time to be meaningfully larger than $2 billion,"" Caisse Chief Executive Michael Sabia said in a phone interview."
General Electric,2017-6,"The new entity will focus on the market for high-tech, fuel-efficient narrow-body aircraft, he said. GE Capital Aviation Services (GECAS), which is putting up the remaining 10 percent in equity, is one of the world largest aircraft-leasing companies."
General Electric,2017-6,"""One of the reasons that this transaction has come together is that GE is looking for capital-efficient ways for them to grow their business,"" Sabia said. ""We're providing capital to help them grow and they're providing operating capability to make sure these assets are well-managed."""
General Electric,2017-6,"Sabia said the entity, to be called Einn Volant Aircraft Leasing (EVAL), was looking at fuel-efficient, narrow-body or single-aisle planes, because those planes ""move most quickly and most easily among the airlines of the world."""
General Electric,2017-6,"That market includes Airbus's A320neo and Boeing Co's 737 MAX, along with Canadian plane-and-train-maker Bombardier Inc's CSeries."
General Electric,2017-6,"He added that the Caisse's 30 percent stake in Bombardier's rail division was ""completely separate"" from the pension fund's $2 billion investment over four years with GE."
General Electric,2017-6,"One aviation financing industry watcher said it is unlikely that GE Capital Aviation would be interested in the 110- to 130-seat CSeries, since it uses the engine of GE rival Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies ."
General Electric,2017-6,"Sabia, however, said any decision about the financing of a specific aircraft would be a function of airline demand."
General Electric,2017-6,"""The focus of this platform is working with airlines,"" Sabia said. ""Our openness to financing specific aircraft has everything to do with what the airlines buy."""
General Electric,2017-6,Shares of Bombardier closed up nearly 5 percent on Monday in Toronto trading. Qatar Airways CEO Akbar Al Baker earlier in the day said he was considering the CSeries for a possible new carrier in India.
General Electric,2017-6,The CSeries has not secured a new firm order in about a year.

General Electric,2017-6,"If they fail, a bigger chunk of the world's third-largest oil reserves will stay in the ground. Canada's oil sands sector has become one of the biggest victims of the global oil price crash that began in 2014 when top OPEC producer Saudi Arabia flooded the market with cheap crude to drive out high cost competitors."
General Electric,2017-6,"This year alone, oil majors have sold over $22.5 billion of assets in Canada's energy industry, and been lured south to invest in the higher returns of U.S. shale."
General Electric,2017-6,"Joseph Kuhach is among the entrepreneurs in Canada hoping they can turn the tide. He runs a small Calgary-based firm, Nsolv, that is testing the use of solvents to liquefy the bitumen buried in the sands and make it flow as oil."
General Electric,2017-6,Kuhach says using solvents can cut 20 to 40 percent from the cost of producing the oil. The technique currently used is to use steam to heat the sands underground to extract the oil.
General Electric,2017-6,"It's a hard sell, he said, to Canadian producers struggling with low oil prices. They are reluctant to invest in a multi-million dollar technology that is unproven on a commercial scale, he said."
General Electric,2017-6,"""The comment I hear so often when I am talking to companies is, 'We want to be the very first in line to be second',"" said Kuhach. ""It's easier to go after incremental improvements that they can back away from with no great cost and no great risk."""
General Electric,2017-6,"Nsolv is winding down a three-year pilot project with Canada's second-largest energy producer Suncor Energy at its Dover oil sands lease in northern Alberta. Suncor is evaluating the results, the firm's spokeswoman Erin Rees said."
General Electric,2017-6,"Fourth-largest producer Imperial Oil , controlled by ExxonMobil Corp , is also developing solvent technology and has had an ongoing C$100-million pilot project since 2013, the company said."
General Electric,2017-6,"The caution of oil sands producers stems in part from the unique challenges of operating here, where projects take years to build and require billions of dollars in upfront capital."
General Electric,2017-6,"The development of the technique using steam two decades ago made Canada's sands the new frontier for the oil industry, and majors were among the firms that flocked to buy in."
General Electric,2017-6,"Since then, innovation has stalled. That failure, energy-industry entrepreneurs and venture capitalists told Reuters, is rooted in a risk-averse culture that has left oil sands years behind U.S. shale."
General Electric,2017-6,"The exodus of international oil firms such as Royal Dutch Shell and Statoil ASA from oil sands has made innovation tougher because there are fewer potential customers who might adopt new technology, said Joe Gasca, chairman of Fractal Systems Inc. His firm processes bitumen into higher-quality crude at the wellhead."
General Electric,2017-6,"Fractal is running a 1,000 barrel-per-day (bpd) test plant in eastern Alberta for third-largest producer Cenovus Energy , which has yet to make a decision on whether to proceed commercially."
General Electric,2017-6,"The shale sector moved fast to innovate and cut costs to survive the oil price crash. In 2014, producing oil from most shale fields cost more than the average $60 a barrel needed for a new Canadian oil sands project to make money. Now, there are some shale patches that can make a profit at $15 a barrel. [nL1N1DU2DQ]"
General Electric,2017-6,It takes months of pumping steam into underground reservoirs before bitumen starts to flow from the oil sands. That makes engineers reluctant to experiment with the delicate balance of heat and pressure.
General Electric,2017-6,"Shale, by contrast, provides comparatively fertile ground for innovation. The initial investment is a fraction of what the cost of an oil sands project. Relatively easy access encourages competition as the many firms involved look for an edge. Wells can be drilled quickly. The stakes are lower and the scale is smaller if experiments fail."
General Electric,2017-6,"Drilling longer wells and being better able to pinpoint where in those wells to fracture the rock, among other techniques, have supercharged U.S. shale output in the past two years. That has boosted firms including Noble Energy and Devon Energy and drawn billions of dollars in new private equity investment.[nL1N1HF0L2]"
General Electric,2017-6,"Canadian producers have fewer projects to experiment with and are unwilling to risk their massive upfront investments, said Steve Fisher, chief executive of Calgary-based startup Veerum."
General Electric,2017-6,"""Shale is like going on a date, the oil sands is like getting married,"" he said. ""The risk for capital is high in the oil sands, you have massive assets that need to complete on time and operate for 40 years to make money."""
General Electric,2017-6,"Veerum's technology cuts capital costs by tracking how accurately a new project sticks to design specifications during construction, reducing the need for costly fixes later."
General Electric,2017-6,"The company is supported by GE's Zone Startups Calgary, an incubator for new firms in the energy capital of Canada."
General Electric,2017-6,"Another hurdle to innovation is the lack of sales and marketing expertise in the city's oil industry to carry ideas through to commercial execution, said Marty Reed, chief executive of clean-tech fund Evok Innovations."
General Electric,2017-6,"""At $100 a barrel it didn't take a sales and marketing genius to sell the product,"" Reed said. ""But if you are a new company trying to get Suncor to adopt a new widget those skills are crucial."""
General Electric,2017-6,Evok was launched last year with a C$100 million investment from Cenovus and Suncor over 10 years to accelerate development of technologies to cut oil sands costs and emissions.
General Electric,2017-6,"Since oil prices began falling in 2014, the long-term forecast for oil sands output in 2030 has fallen to 3.7 million bpd, down from 5.2 million bpd, according to the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers. Current output is around 2.4 million bpd."
General Electric,2017-6,"Expansion will mostly come from adding units at existing projects, given new projects are unprofitable at current international oil prices of around $45 a barrel."
General Electric,2017-6,"Canadian oil sands producers recognize that innovation is crucial for their survival, and some firms are spending more."
General Electric,2017-6,"The country's top energy producer Canadian Natural Resources Ltd allocated C$549 million ($406.97 million) or 14 percent of its 2016 C$3.8 billion capital budget on research and development (R&D), up 4 percent from C$527 million in 2015, when capital spending was higher."
General Electric,2017-6,"""It's mostly about incremental gains, but we do have some big stuff that could change things,"" Canadian Natural President Steve Laut told reporters last month, declining to elaborate."
General Electric,2017-6,"Suncor and Imperial both held R&D spending steady from the previous year while reducing overall capital budgets. Suncor spent C$150 million, or 3 percent of its budget in 2016 on what it calls ""step-change technologies"", while Imperial spent C$195 million, roughly 17 percent of its budget, company filings showed."
General Electric,2017-6,The firms all said they were working on ways to reduce costs and environmental impact. Producers also said new technology is often developed in the field during normal operations and does not necessarily show up in R&D budgets.
General Electric,2017-6,"A number of producers, including Cenovus and Suncor are looking at ways to add solvents to steam in their commercial operations."
General Electric,2017-6,"Unlike the solvent-only technique being pitched by Nsolv, this would allow firms to adapt existing thermal plants rather than build new ones, Kuhach said."
General Electric,2017-6,"Even if pilot steam-and-solvent projects are successful, it would take another three to five years for the technology to spread across the industry, said Dan Wicklum, chief executive of the Canadian Oil Sands Innovation Alliance."
General Electric,2017-6,"Vancouver-based Chrysalix Venture Capital has become more cautious about new oil sands investments since the oil majors pulled out, Chief Executive Wal van Lierop said, but is investing in technologies that may prove valuable to the sector."
General Electric,2017-6,"""I am really hoping we can get breakthrough technologies, but I don't see them yet,"" he said."
General Electric,2017-6,"""Mediocracy will not help. It will be go big or go home."""

General Electric,2017-6,"PARIS, June 17 (Reuters) - CFM International said on Saturday it was confident of meeting a target of 500 deliveries of LEAP engines by the end of the year despite a recent quality flaw with a component."
General Electric,2017-6,"Boeing earlier this year briefly suspended 737 MAX test flights while CFM, co-owned by Safran and General Electric , conducted checks after a problem was found in a turbine disc."
General Electric,2017-6,Safran and GE have both recently talked of 450-500 engine deliveries but CFM officials told a briefing ahead of the Paris Airshow that they remained committed to the target of 500 and that their level of confidence had not changed.
General Electric,2017-6,"They said the engine, developed for Boeing and Airbus medium-haul planes, was proving to have higher utilisation rates than a rival model from Pratt & Whitney ."
General Electric,2017-6,"Each one percent in improved utilisation has the same benefit for airline finances as a five percent fuel saving, they said."
General Electric,2017-6,CFM also said it expects to have clearance for 180-minute extended operations by the end of June for the Boeing and Airbus versions of its LEAP engine.
General Electric,2017-6,"That means planes will be able to fly up to three hours away from the nearest airport at any one time, allowing airlines to serve long over-water routes like Hawaii to the U.S. West Coast."
General Electric,2017-6,"CFM, like rival engine makers Pratt & Whitney and Rolls-Royce , is meanwhile poring over proposals for a new mid-market jetliner from Boeing, seating around 220-270 people."
General Electric,2017-6,"Many in the industry expect Boeing to opt for an engine with a gear to increase the efficiency of its fan, which produces most of the thrust, especially on take-off."
General Electric,2017-6,Pratt & Whitney has introduced such a design to re-enter the civil market after mainly focusing on the U.S. military in recent years. Its Geared Turbofan is now in use on some Airbus and Bombardier jets.
General Electric,2017-6,"The head of Pratt & Whitney last month warned Rolls-Royce that the use of a gear in its planned Ultrafan engine project could cause a patent dispute, according to Flightglobal."
General Electric,2017-6,"CFM officials declined on Saturday to be drawn on whether they would offer a similar design for Boeing's new jet, but did not rule out using a gear that one described as generic technology."

General Electric,2017-6,"Nsolv is winding down a three-year pilot project with Canada's second-largest energy producer Suncor Energy at its Dover oil sands lease in northern Alberta. Suncor is evaluating the results, the firm's spokeswoman Erin Rees said."
General Electric,2017-6,"Fourth-largest producer Imperial Oil , controlled by ExxonMobil Corp , is also developing solvent technology and has had an ongoing C$100-million pilot project since 2013, the company said."
General Electric,2017-6,"The caution of oil sands producers stems in part from the unique challenges of operating here, where projects take years to build and require billions of dollars in upfront capital."
General Electric,2017-6,"The development of the technique using steam two decades ago made Canada's sands the new frontier for the oil industry, and majors were among the firms that flocked to buy in."
General Electric,2017-6,"Since then, innovation has stalled. That failure, energy-industry entrepreneurs and venture capitalists told Reuters, is rooted in a risk-averse culture that has left oil sands years behind U.S. shale."
General Electric,2017-6,"The exodus of international oil firms such as Royal Dutch Shell and Statoil ASA from oil sands has made innovation tougher because there are fewer potential customers who might adopt new technology, said Joe Gasca, chairman of Fractal Systems Inc. His firm processes bitumen into higher-quality crude at the wellhead."
General Electric,2017-6,"Fractal is running a 1,000 barrel-per-day (bpd) test plant in eastern Alberta for third-largest producer Cenovus Energy , which has yet to make a decision on whether to proceed commercially."
General Electric,2017-6,"The shale sector moved fast to innovate and cut costs to survive the oil price crash. In 2014, producing oil from most shale fields cost more than the average $60 a barrel needed for a new Canadian oil sands project to make money. Now, there are some shale patches that can make a profit at $15 a barrel. [nL1N1DU2DQ]"
General Electric,2017-6,It takes months of pumping steam into underground reservoirs before bitumen starts to flow from the oil sands. That makes engineers reluctant to experiment with the delicate balance of heat and pressure.
General Electric,2017-6,"Shale, by contrast, provides comparatively fertile ground for innovation. The initial investment is a fraction of what the cost of an oil sands project. Relatively easy access encourages competition as the many firms involved look for an edge. Wells can be drilled quickly. The stakes are lower and the scale is smaller if experiments fail."
General Electric,2017-6,"Drilling longer wells and being better able to pinpoint where in those wells to fracture the rock, among other techniques, have supercharged U.S. shale output in the past two years. That has boosted firms including Noble Energy and Devon Energy and drawn billions of dollars in new private equity investment.[nL1N1HF0L2]"
General Electric,2017-6,"Canadian producers have fewer projects to experiment with and are unwilling to risk their massive upfront investments, said Steve Fisher, chief executive of Calgary-based startup Veerum."
General Electric,2017-6,"""Shale is like going on a date, the oil sands is like getting married,"" he said. ""The risk for capital is high in the oil sands, you have massive assets that need to complete on time and operate for 40 years to make money."""
General Electric,2017-6,"Veerum's technology cuts capital costs by tracking how accurately a new project sticks to design specifications during construction, reducing the need for costly fixes later."
General Electric,2017-6,"The company is supported by GE's Zone Startups Calgary, an incubator for new firms in the energy capital of Canada."
General Electric,2017-6,"Another hurdle to innovation is the lack of sales and marketing expertise in the city's oil industry to carry ideas through to commercial execution, said Marty Reed, chief executive of clean-tech fund Evok Innovations."
General Electric,2017-6,"""At $100 a barrel it didn't take a sales and marketing genius to sell the product,"" Reed said. ""But if you are a new company trying to get Suncor to adopt a new widget those skills are crucial."""
General Electric,2017-6,Evok was launched last year with a C$100 million investment from Cenovus and Suncor over 10 years to accelerate development of technologies to cut oil sands costs and emissions.
General Electric,2017-6,"Since oil prices began falling in 2014, the long-term forecast for oil sands output in 2030 has fallen to 3.7 million bpd, down from 5.2 million bpd, according to the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers. Current output is around 2.4 million bpd."
General Electric,2017-6,"Expansion will mostly come from adding units at existing projects, given new projects are unprofitable at current international oil prices of around $45 a barrel."
General Electric,2017-6,"Canadian oil sands producers recognize that innovation is crucial for their survival, and some firms are spending more."
General Electric,2017-6,"The country's top energy producer Canadian Natural Resources Ltd allocated C$549 million ($406.97 million) or 14 percent of its 2016 C$3.8 billion capital budget on research and development (R&D), up 4 percent from C$527 million in 2015, when capital spending was higher."
General Electric,2017-6,"""It's mostly about incremental gains, but we do have some big stuff that could change things,"" Canadian Natural President Steve Laut told reporters last month, declining to elaborate."
General Electric,2017-6,"Suncor and Imperial both held R&D spending steady from the previous year while reducing overall capital budgets. Suncor spent C$150 million, or 3 percent of its budget in 2016 on what it calls ""step-change technologies"", while Imperial spent C$195 million, roughly 17 percent of its budget, company filings showed."
General Electric,2017-6,The firms all said they were working on ways to reduce costs and environmental impact. Producers also said new technology is often developed in the field during normal operations and does not necessarily show up in R&D budgets.
General Electric,2017-6,"A number of producers, including Cenovus and Suncor are looking at ways to add solvents to steam in their commercial operations."
General Electric,2017-6,"Unlike the solvent-only technique being pitched by Nsolv, this would allow firms to adapt existing thermal plants rather than build new ones, Kuhach said."
General Electric,2017-6,"Even if pilot steam-and-solvent projects are successful, it would take another three to five years for the technology to spread across the industry, said Dan Wicklum, chief executive of the Canadian Oil Sands Innovation Alliance."
General Electric,2017-6,"Vancouver-based Chrysalix Venture Capital has become more cautious about new oil sands investments since the oil majors pulled out, Chief Executive Wal van Lierop said, but is investing in technologies that may prove valuable to the sector."
General Electric,2017-6,"""I am really hoping we can get breakthrough technologies, but I don't see them yet,"" he said."
General Electric,2017-6,"""Mediocracy will not help. It will be go big or go home."""

General Electric,2017-6,"PARIS, June 17 (Reuters) - CFM International said on Saturday it was confident of meeting a target of 500 deliveries of LEAP engines by the end of the year despite a recent quality flaw with a component."
General Electric,2017-6,"Boeing earlier this year briefly suspended 737 MAX test flights while CFM, co-owned by Safran and General Electric , conducted checks after a problem was found in a turbine disc."
General Electric,2017-6,Safran and GE have both recently talked of 450-500 engine deliveries but CFM officials told a briefing ahead of the Paris Airshow that they remained committed to the target of 500 and that their level of confidence had not changed.
General Electric,2017-6,"They said the engine, developed for Boeing and Airbus medium-haul planes, was proving to have higher utilisation rates than a rival model from Pratt & Whitney ."
General Electric,2017-6,"Each one percent in improved utilisation has the same benefit for airline finances as a five percent fuel saving, they said."
General Electric,2017-6,CFM also said it expects to have clearance for 180-minute extended operations by the end of June for the Boeing and Airbus versions of its LEAP engine.
General Electric,2017-6,"That means planes will be able to fly up to three hours away from the nearest airport at any one time, allowing airlines to serve long over-water routes like Hawaii to the U.S. West Coast."
General Electric,2017-6,"CFM, like rival engine makers Pratt & Whitney and Rolls-Royce , is meanwhile poring over proposals for a new mid-market jetliner from Boeing, seating around 220-270 people."
General Electric,2017-6,"Many in the industry expect Boeing to opt for an engine with a gear to increase the efficiency of its fan, which produces most of the thrust, especially on take-off."
General Electric,2017-6,Pratt & Whitney has introduced such a design to re-enter the civil market after mainly focusing on the U.S. military in recent years. Its Geared Turbofan is now in use on some Airbus and Bombardier jets.
General Electric,2017-6,"The head of Pratt & Whitney last month warned Rolls-Royce that the use of a gear in its planned Ultrafan engine project could cause a patent dispute, according to Flightglobal."

General Electric,2017-6,"SEATTLE, June 13 (Reuters) - General Electric Co has begun testing autonomous drones and robotic ""crawlers"" to inspect refineries, factories, railroads and other industrial equipment with an eye on capturing a bigger slice of the $40 billion companies around the globe spend annually on inspections."
General Electric,2017-6,"In trials with customers, aerial drones and robots are able to move around and inside remote or dangerous facilities while photographing corrosion or taking temperature, vibration or gas readings that can be analyzed by computer algorithms and artificial intelligence, Alex Tepper, head of business development at Avitas Systems, a startup GE formed for this business, told Reuters."

General Electric,2017-6,"The maker of jet engines, power plants, medical scanners and railroad locomotives on Monday named veteran insider John Flannery as its next CEO, taking over from longtime leader Jeff Immelt, who reshaped one of corporate America's icons to focus more on technology but failed to deliver profit growth fast enough for some investors."
General Electric,2017-6,"""I'm going to do a fast but deliberate, methodical review of the whole company,"" Flannery told Reuters in an interview. ""The board has encouraged me to come in and look at it afresh."""
General Electric,2017-6,"In an earlier call with investors, he said the review would have ""no constraint."""
General Electric,2017-6,"Immelt, who will step aside Aug. 1, led GE for 16 years, steering it through the financial crisis but leaving it worth a third less than when he took over."
General Electric,2017-6,GE's shares closed up 3.6 percent at $28.94 on the New York Stock Exchange on Monday.
General Electric,2017-6,"Flannery did not mention any specific plans for GE, but said digital efforts will be at the heart of its strategy."
General Electric,2017-6,"The company has spent billions of dollars building a digital business that marries electronic sensors and analytic computing to industrial equipment, even though those efforts have not yet boosted GE's bottom line as much investors hoped."
General Electric,2017-6,"GE will make the results of the review public in the fall, but major changes are not needed, Flannery said. ""We're not starting from a weak position at all."""
General Electric,2017-6,The company will press ahead with its target of cutting overhead costs by $2 billion by 2019 and boosting profits to $2 a share next year.
General Electric,2017-6,"Flannery, a 55-year-old who joined the company 30 years ago and is now the head of its healthcare unit, will also become chairman after Immelt retires on Dec. 31."
General Electric,2017-6,"Known previously as a dealmaker at GE, Flannery has been credited with nursing that unit back to improving sales and profits by focusing on organic growth. [nL8N1J94AX]"
General Electric,2017-6,"He takes over from 61-year-old Immelt, who succeeded Jack Welch in 2001 and oversaw the divestment of its massive lending unit GE Capital, TV network NBCUniversal, and famed appliances business, shifting the conglomerate's focus toward technology, healthcare and manufacturing."
General Electric,2017-6,"Despite investing heavily on developing digital products, from sensors in jet engines to augmented reality software, shareholders have been wary of the company's new direction. [nL1N1I41F9]"
General Electric,2017-6,"Since Immelt became CEO, GE's shares have declined 30 percent, while the S&P 500 index more than doubled. That underperformance had some pressing for more urgency."
General Electric,2017-6,"Activist investor Nelson Peltz's Trian Fund Management bought a stake in GE in October 2015, the largest single investment the firm had ever made, and now worth about $2 billion. Trian immediately pushed for asset sales and cost cuts. Trian declined comment on the CEO change on Monday."
General Electric,2017-6,GE said Immelt's departure was not triggered by outside influences and was the culmination of six years of succession planning. It said its board set the summer of 2017 for Immelt's departure as far back as 2013.
General Electric,2017-6,"The timing was not surprising given the serial underperformance of the stock and ""investor fatigue with management's continued perceived ungainly portfolio actions,"" said Stifel analyst Robert McCarthy."
General Electric,2017-6,"During Immelt's tenure, GE bought French peer Alstom's power business. On Monday it got U.S. antitrust approval to merge its oil and gas business with Baker Hughes Inc ."
General Electric,2017-6,"Despite Immelt's efforts to kick-start growth, the oldest surviving member of the Dow Jones Industrial Average has struggled to boost sales significantly in the past few quarters. In particular, the company's cash flow has been a cause for concern."
General Electric,2017-6,"Flannery, who joined GE Capital in 1987, focused on leveraged buyouts and later led the corporate restructuring group. He has also ran GE's India business, its equity business in Latin America and the GE Capital business for Argentina and Chile. His new salary will be $2 million a year, GE said."

General Electric,2017-6,"WASHINGTON, June 12 (Reuters) - General Electric Co won U.S. antitrust approval to merge its oil and gas business with Baker Hughes Inc to form a new publicly traded company, the Justice Department said on Monday."
General Electric,2017-6,"GE and Baker Hughes announced the deal in October, months after Halliburton's effort to buy Baker Hughes collapsed under pressure from the Justice Department."
General Electric,2017-6,"Under the agreement, GE will combine Baker Hughes with its oil and gas business, creating a company with $23 billion in annual revenue, the companies said."
General Electric,2017-6,GE will pay existing Baker Hughes shareholders $7.4 billion for a special dividend.
General Electric,2017-6,"Following the approval, shares of Baker Hughes added slightly to gains to close up 1.1 percent at $56.16."
General Electric,2017-6,"Energy service companies like Baker Hughes have scrambled to recover from a two-year rout in global oil prices, which pushed the value of U.S. crude to around $26 per barrel last year. Services companies were among the hardest hit, laying off thousands of workers and idling equipment."
General Electric,2017-6,"A deal among major global oil producers last year to cut production has helped stabilize prices at about $50 a barrel, spurring drilling activity. In the United States, drillers have added some 513 rigs since last year, more than doubling the number in operation, according to data from Baker Hughes."
General Electric,2017-6,"GE is already the world's largest oilfield equipment maker, supplying blowout preventers, pumps and compressors used in exploration and production. It has also invested heavily in large data processing services just as the oil industry eyes its potential to boost oil recovery."
General Electric,2017-6,"Baker Hughes is seen as one of the world leaders in horizontal drilling, chemicals used to frack and other services key to oil production."
General Electric,2017-6,"The deal was approved on condition that GE sell its Water & Process Technologies business, the department said. The asset sale was required because GE and Baker Hughes are two of four companies that sell refineries the specialized chemicals they need to remove impurities from hydrocarbons, the department said in a court filing."
General Electric,2017-6,"GE will sell the assets to French waste and water group Suez for $3.4 billion, the company said in a statement."
General Electric,2017-6,"Baker Hughes has some 35 percent of the market for refinery process chemicals, while GE has about 20 percent, the department said in a court filing."
General Electric,2017-6,"""Today's milestone represents significant progress toward creating an oil and gas productivity leader,"" the companies said in a statement."

General Electric,2017-6,{{20170612T161747.498+0000}}Flannery wins top GE job after nursing growth at healthcare unitBy Ben Hirschler
General Electric,2017-6,"June 12 (Reuters) - When John Flannery was chosen to head GE Healthcare in 2014, his background as chief dealmaker for the industrial conglomerate led to speculation GE might consider spinning off its somewhat sickly health business."
General Electric,2017-6,"In fact, he has nursed it back to improving sales and profits by focusing primarily on organic growth opportunities, and the business remains core to GE."
General Electric,2017-6,"Flannery will take over General Electric Co from Jeff Immelt, who is stepping aside after 16 years as head of the conglomerate he helped steer through the financial crisis but which is now worth a third less than when he took over. [nL3N1J93DT]"
General Electric,2017-6,"On Flannery's watch, the healthcare unit - best-known for imaging and diagnostics - has also expanded into life sciences, offering a range of services to pharmaceutical and biotech companies."
General Electric,2017-6,"GE faces tough competition for its medical imaging machines, which include MRI scanners and ultrasound devices, from rivals including Philips and Siemens , as well as younger Asian upstarts."
General Electric,2017-6,"But a focus on expansion into new markets has helped lift sales at GE Healthcare to $18.3 billion last year, with organic revenue increasing by 5 percent and margins by 100 basis points."
General Electric,2017-6,"Flannery has worked hard to move GE into newer areas of healthcare like life sciences, where GE has emerged as a significant player in helping with the production of biological drugs and cell therapies."
General Electric,2017-6,"Such drugs, given by injection or infusion, are a pivotal driver of innovation in the drugs industry, being used to treat complex diseases from rheumatoid arthritis to cancer."
General Electric,2017-6,"Flannery told Reuters last year he aimed to ""double down on life sciences"", given this business's large and high-margin opportunities. [nL8N19Z25J]"
General Electric,2017-6,"One of the more innovative ideas launched by GE recently is the design of prefabricated drug factories for making complex biotech medicines, an idea it is pioneering in both China and Ireland."
General Electric,2017-6,"GE reckons its ""off-the-shelf"" modular factories are 25 to 50 percent cheaper than the traditional plants and can be constructed in just 18 months rather than the typical three years. [nL8N1BV13Z]"
General Electric,2017-6,"Some analysts continue to question whether healthcare truly fits with mainstay GE industries like power generation and jet engines, but Flannery's elevation suggests the group is not contemplating ditching healthcare any time soon."
General Electric,2017-6,"In a sign of continuity, GE said Kieran Murphy, who currently heads life sciences, would lead the wider GE Healthcare division - and the company stated bluntly: ""Healthcare is a key GE business now and in the future."""

General Electric,2017-6,{{20170612T141027.548+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-GE's CEO choice pushes the boundaries(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.)
General Electric,2017-6,"NEW YORK, June 12 (Reuters Breakingviews) - General Electric has seen the future: it is both stateless and globalist. With the anointment of John Flannery to succeed Jeffrey Immelt as chief executive, the $255 billion industrial titan appears to be doubling down on a strategy that transcends its American roots. Flannery has spent much of his career engineering growth abroad. He's also no stranger to restructuring."
General Electric,2017-6,"Despite the worldwide upheaval confronting chieftains of multinational companies, Flannery has been dealt a better hand. Immelt took over a GE addicted to finance, willing to prostitute the stellar credit ratings of its world-class manufacturing and engineering capabilities for a quick buck. Over his tenure, which started ominously on Sept. 11, 2001, Immelt did wean the company off $260 billion of financial assets, but only after the crisis forced his hand. He also divested appliances, plastics and media."
General Electric,2017-6,"For all this reimagining of GE, which included moving the headquarters to Boston and a plunge into the industrial internet, Immelt has been dogged by a poorly performing stock. GE returned $143 billion in dividends to shareholders under his stewardship, but the shares also have tumbled by some 30 percent."
General Electric,2017-6,"The Allman Brothers fan will have the difficult task of reassuring executives running GE's divisions, many of whom probably fancied themselves Immelt's rightful successor, that their future is peachy. Immelt's ascension to replace Jack Welch led to defections. Flannery also will need to reassure shareholders, including Nelson Peltz's Trian, whose arrival probably greased the skids for his appointment."
General Electric,2017-6,"To satisfy these and other constituents, Flannery may have to mine the more radical elements of Immelt's strategy. A merger and spinoff of the oil and gas division with Baker Hughes , for example, creates a separate and listed enterprise where GE calls the shots. That blueprint could have wider application. As the company embarks on localizing geographically, it also could become more of a federation operationally. In that sense, Immelt's murky legacy may be dependent on Flannery."
General Electric,2017-6,"- General Electric on June 12 named John Flannery to succeed Jeffrey Immelt as chief executive of the company, effective Aug. 1, and as chairman from the start of 2018."
General Electric,2017-6,"- Flannery, who joined the industrial group in 1987, is currently the president and CEO of GE Healthcare."
General Electric,2017-6,"- Before taking over GE Healthcare, Flannery led business development for GE Corporate, ""where he focused on capital allocation"" and was involved in the acquisition of Alstom, the reduction of GE Capital's balance sheet, the initial public offering of Synchrony Financial and the sale of GE Appliances to China's Haier."

General Electric,2017-6,* Also helping companies cut time and costs in tough market
General Electric,2017-6,"MUELHEIM-KAERLICH, Germany, June 12 (Reuters) - As head of the Muelheim-Kaerlich nuclear reactor, Thomas Volmar spends his days plotting how to tear down his workplace. The best way to do that, he says, is to cut out humans."
General Electric,2017-6,"About 200 nuclear reactors around the world will be shut down over the next quarter century, mostly in Europe, according to the International Energy Agency. That means a lot of work for the half a dozen companies that specialise in the massively complex and dangerous job of dismantling plants."
General Electric,2017-6,"The transformation of the sector is an engineering one, but companies are also looking to the new technology to cut time and costs in a competitive sector with slim margins."
General Electric,2017-6,"Dismantling a nuclear power plant can take decades and cost up to 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion), depending on its size and age. The cost of taking apart the plant in Muelheim-Kaerlich will be about 800 million euros, according to sources familiar with the station's economics."
General Electric,2017-6,Some inroads have already been made: a programmable robot arm developed by Areva has reduced the time it takes to dismantle some of the most contaminated components of a plant by 20-30 percent compared with conventional cutting techniques.
General Electric,2017-6,"For Areva and rival Westinghouse, reactor dismantling is unlikely to make an impact on the dire financial straits they are mired in at present as it represents just a small part of their businesses, which are dominated by plant-building."
General Electric,2017-6,"But it nonetheless represents a rare area of revenue growth; the global market for decommissioning services is expected to nearly double to $8.6 billion by 2021, from $4.8 billion last year, according to research firm MarketsandMarkets. Such growth could prove important for the two companies should they weather their current difficulties."

General Electric,2017-6,"When reactors were built in the 1970s, they were designed to keep radiation contained inside at all costs, with little thought given to those who might be tearing them down more than 40 years later."
General Electric,2017-6,"Finally, the reactor itself needs to be taken apart and the buildings demolished, which takes about a decade. Some of the most highly contaminated components are cocooned in concrete and placed in iron containers that will be buried deep underground at some point."
General Electric,2017-6,"Enter companies such as Areva, Westinghouse, Nukem Technologies, GE Hitachi <6501.T> as well as GNS, owned by Germany's four nuclear plant operators. They have all begun using robots and software to navigate their way into the reactor core, or pressure vessel."
General Electric,2017-6,"""The most difficult task is the dismantling of the reactor pressure vessel, where the remaining radioactivity is highest,"" said Volmar, who took charge of the RWE-owned Muelheim-Kaerlich plant two years ago. ""We leave this to a specialised expert firm."""
General Electric,2017-6,The 2011 Fukushima disaster and the Chernobyl accident of 1986 are imprinted in the world's consciousness as examples of the catastrophic consequences of the leakage of radioactive material.
General Electric,2017-6,"France's Areva recently won the contract to dismantle the pressure vessel internals at Vattenfall's 806 megawatt (MW) Brunsbuettel nuclear plant in Germany, which includes an option for the Swedish utility's 1,402 MW Kruemmel site. [nBw4r1vBma]"
General Electric,2017-6,"There, the group will for the first time use its new AZURo programmable robot arm. It hopes this will help it outstrip rivals in what is the world's largest dismantling market following Germany's decision to close all its last nuclear plants by 2022, in response to the Fukushima disaster."
General Electric,2017-6,"Areva's German unit invests about 5 percent of its annual sales, or about 40 million euros, in research and development, including in-house innovation such as AZURo. By comparison, the world's 1,000 largest corporate R&D spenders, on average, spent 4.2 percent last year, according to PwC."
General Electric,2017-6,"The robot arm technology helped Areva beat Westinghouse by winning tenders to dismantle pressure vessel internals at EnBW's Philippsburg 2 and Gundremmingen 2 blocks, industry sources familiar with the matter said."
General Electric,2017-6,"GNS, which is jointly owned by E.ON , RWE, EnBW and Vattenfall, is currently helping to dismantle the German Neckarwestheim 1 and Philippsburg 1 reactors, using its software to plan the demolition."
General Electric,2017-6,"The company also hopes to supply its software services for the dismantling of PreussenElektra's Isar 1 reactor, which is being tendered, and aims to expand to other European countries. ""Two things matter: time and money,"" said Joerg Viermann, head of sales of waste management activities at GNS."

General Electric,2017-6,"NEW YORK/WASHINGTON, June 1 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday withdrawing the country from the Paris climate accord would stave off an economic crisis and protect American jobs - but many American companies seemed to disagree."
General Electric,2017-6,"Criticism of his decision rolled in from blue-chip companies like Facebook Inc , Apple Inc , Ford Motor Co and Microsoft Corp , while the response from fossil fuel groups with the most to gain from a relaxation of U.S. carbon emissions standards was muted."
General Electric,2017-6,Tesla Inc Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk and Walt Disney Co CEO Robert Iger said they would leave White House advisory councils over Trump's decision. [nL3N1IY5QF]

General Electric,2017-6,"A spokesman for Peabody Energy Corp , America's largest publicly traded coal miner, had said on Wednesday that the company would support a decision by Trump to withdraw from the Paris deal because the ""accord is flawed on a number of levels."""
