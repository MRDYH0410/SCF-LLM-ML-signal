General Electric,2017-9,UPDATE 1-Air France flight with engine damage makes emergency landing in Canada - Reuters News
General Electric,2017-9,"{{20170930T194021.392+0000}}UPDATE 1-Air France flight with engine damage makes emergency landing in CanadaSept 30 (Reuters) - An Air France flight from Paris to Los Angeles made an emergency landing in eastern Canada on Saturday after one of its four engines sustained ""serious damage"" over the Atlantic, the airline said."
General Electric,2017-9,"Air France Flight 66, originating at Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport, landed at Goose Bay in Labrador at 1542 GMT, the airline said, and no one was hurt in the incident."
General Electric,2017-9,"""The regularly trained pilots and cabin crew handled this serious incident perfectly,"" the airline said in a statement."
General Electric,2017-9,"The aircraft involved in the incident was an Airbus 380 that was about seven years old, according to airfleets.net, an aircraft database. The engine was made by Engine Alliance, a joint venture between General Electric Co and United Technologies Corp's Pratt & Whitney unit."
General Electric,2017-9,The forced landing in Canada's easternmost province is reminiscent of an incident seven years ago in which one of the Rolls Royce engines on a Qantas A380 suffered mid-engine damage after taking off in Singapore. The November 2010 incident prompted the grounding of the entire Qantas A380 fleet -- six A380s at the time -- for over three weeks.
General Electric,2017-9,Officials with the Transportation Safety Board of Canada could not immediately be reached for comment on Saturday. The airline said it was making arrangements to send the plane's passengers to their destination of Los Angeles.
General Electric,2017-9,Aircraft on trans-Atlantic flights commonly use Goose Bay Airport in the province of Newfoundland and Labrador for emergency fueling stops.

General Electric,2017-9,* One of the largest railways contracts given to a foreign firm
General Electric,2017-9,"NEW DELHI, Sept 28 (Reuters) - General Electric's plan to build a diesel locomotive factory in eastern India is proceeding as planned, the nation's railways minister said on Thursday, aiming to allay the U.S. firm's concerns that India was unilaterally making changes to the contract."
General Electric,2017-9,Piyush Goyal's comments came after GE said this week that the Indian government could incur costs and its 'Make in India' initiative would be undermined if the railway ministry went ahead with changes to the scope of a joint venture of GE and the state-controlled network. [nL4N1M74VK]
General Electric,2017-9,"""Work in the factory is going on as per plan,"" he told reporters."
General Electric,2017-9,"GE had won a $2.6 billion contract in 2015 to supply the railways with 1,000 diesel locomotives and began work on a plant in an impoverished corner of eastern India, in one of the largest direct foreign investment projects in the South Asian nation."
General Electric,2017-9,But the railways ministry said last week it wouldn't need diesel engines after all - hoping to save on fuel and maintenance costs - and suggested GE might want to make electric locomotives instead.
General Electric,2017-9,"The contract to GE is one of the largest to be awarded to a foreign firm since India allowed 100 percent foreign direct investment in parts of its railways, and is part of a $137 billion programme to overhaul the vast but dilapidated network by 2020."
General Electric,2017-9,The uncertainty over the railway locomotives investment has come at a time when the government is facing political pressure after economic growth slowed to its weakest pace in three years. [nL8N1LI008]
General Electric,2017-9,A government source said Prime Minister Narendra Modi's office had intervened after GE raised its concerns and the railways had not made a written proposal for a change of plans from diesel to an all-electric fleet to power the world's fourth largest rail network.
General Electric,2017-9,"GE had approached Modi's office seeking clarity on the issue, an aide to Modi said. ""We told them we will look into the matter and that we respect their commitment to the Indian railways."""
General Electric,2017-9,"The apparent policy shift raised fears for the future of investments in the country, especially Modi's indigenisation drive to create tens of thousands of jobs for a swelling workforce."
General Electric,2017-9,"Goyal, who took charge of railways last month, said the government had no plans to make sudden changes in policy and there was no threat to the GE plant in the eastern Indian state of Bihar."
General Electric,2017-9,"""Our government does not make any sudden changes in policy...we take considered decisions...The Marhaura factory is being set up and I think it's on track."""
General Electric,2017-9,"But he said he was in talks with GE to explore ways of cutting costs including the railways' broader goal of electrification which could lead to savings of millions of dollars on fuel costs alone, besides a lower carbon footprint. GE already has investments in India's power, healthcare and transportation sectors."
General Electric,2017-9,"""Going for electrification in a much faster manner, is in the interest of the people of India,"" he said, adding he had fruitful meetings with GE in that regard and that these were internal discussions aimed at improving the network."
General Electric,2017-9,"""Can we look at opportunities going forward where we can meet the twin objectives of reducing pollution, saving cost in the overall interest of the country and yet making sure that the contracts or the agreements that are made by the country or by the railways continues to serve the people of India in the best interests of India?"" he said."

General Electric,2017-9,"ABU DHABI, Sept 28 (Reuters) - Abu Dhabi's state fund Mubadala Investment Company [MUDEV.UL] made a net profit of 4.2 billion dirhams ($1.14 billion) in the first half of the year, it reported on Thursday, its first set of results since merging with the other state wealth fund, International Petroleum Investment Company (IPIC)."
General Electric,2017-9,"Mubadala made a net loss of 4.7 billion dirhams in the first half of 2016, it said in a statement."
General Electric,2017-9,"Total assets rose to 465.5 billion dirhams at the end of June, from 449.7 billion dirhams a year ago."
General Electric,2017-9,"The merged fund, whose investments include stakes in General Electric and private equity firm Carlyle Group , also reported ""total comprehensive income"" of 6.8 billion dirhams in the first half of 2017 compared with a ""total comprehensive loss"" of 5.4 billion dirhams in the same period last year."
General Electric,2017-9,"Separating the results for the two funds, Mubadala Development Company made a first-half net attributable profit of 578.4 million dirhams versus a loss of 4.43 billion dirhams a year ago, while IPIC made a net attributable profit of 2.67 billion dirhams, having lost 946.2 million dirhams in the first half of last year."

General Electric,2017-9,"""We managed our costs prudently, while monetising mature assets and growing our profit as we reduced our overall leverage."""
General Electric,2017-9,"Mubadala said little about the outlook or its investment plans in its statement, but its CEO Khaldoon al-Mubarak said earlier this year the firm was lining up new overseas investments in 2017 and might also sell or reduce some of its existing stakes in companies. [nL5N1H727O]"
General Electric,2017-9,"Mubadala's revenues in the first half totalled 83.4 billion dirhams versus 72.9 billion dirhams in the year-ago period, helped by higher revenues from its oil and gas, semiconductors and aerospace interests, the statement said."
General Electric,2017-9,"The company also made gains from financial investments and favourable currency, it added."
General Electric,2017-9,In August Mubadala sold a 3.9 percent stake in Advanced Micro Devices in its second sale of shares in the U.S-based semiconductor company this year. The sale value was $529.6 million based on AMD's closing share price.[nL5N1KQ1CK]

General Electric,2017-9,"PARIS, Sept 28 (Reuters) - France will make sure Siemens sticks to its commitment to preserve jobs following its rail business merger with Alstom , the French finance minister said as the government seeks to reassure worried workers."
General Electric,2017-9,The French finance ministry said it had secured a commitment from Siemens to safeguard Alstom's French manufacturing plants and jobs for a four-year period after the deal struck this week by the two companies closes. [nL8N1M84ED][nL8N1M82F3]
General Electric,2017-9,"""I will put in place a committee to monitor the commitments taken by Siemens towards the French state,"" finance minister Bruno Le Maire told BFM TV on Thursday ahead of a visit to Alstom's Valenciennes site in northern France on Friday."
General Electric,2017-9,"With the unemployment rate still stuck above nine percent, a recent string of cross-border corporate deals giving foreign companies control over French firms have led to criticism from opposition politicians of the centrist government of new French President Emmanuel Macron."
General Electric,2017-9,"On Wednesday, Italian shipbuilder Fincantieri won a deal to take effective control of French shipyard STX France, ending months of resistance by the French government."
General Electric,2017-9,"In order to lessen concerns about foreign ownership, Le Maire said France will have independent board members in the new Siemens-Alstom company, who will have the right to veto all strategic decisions for four years."
General Electric,2017-9,"He also said that the French state, as a major customer, will have a major influence on the new Siemens-Alstom due to it having a 5 to 15 percent capital stake in the combination."
General Electric,2017-9,"Le Maire reiterated that fierce competition from Chinese players who are twice as big as Siemens and Alstom combined, meant they had no choice but to merge their rail activities."
General Electric,2017-9,"Asked about job promises made in previous takeovers of French companies, Le Maire said the government would make sure that General Electric respects commitments it made after its acquisition of Alstom's energy division two years ago."
General Electric,2017-9,He also said he had spoken with the president of Nokia to remind him of a promise to create jobs in France.
General Electric,2017-9,"When buying Alcatel-Lucent in 2016, Nokia pledged to hire 500 people in research and development in France, but the firm said earlier this month it would cut nearly 600 jobs in France by end-2019 as part of a cost-cutting plan."
General Electric,2017-9,"""I told him he needs to accelerate jobs creation, because the target has not been met and we have the means to exert all necessary pressure,"" Le Maire said."

General Electric,2017-9,"NEW DELHI, Sept 27 (Reuters) - Surprise policy shifts, such as an apparent U-turn over a locomotive deal with General Electric , risk undermining Prime Minister Narendra Modi's flagship 'Make in India' initiative, which aims to create millions of jobs and boost growth, industry executives say."
General Electric,2017-9,"GE won a $2.6 billion contract in 2015 to supply 1,000 diesel locomotives - the biggest direct investment in India by a U.S. firm and the first deal awarded to a foreign firm after India allowed 100 percent foreign investment in its railways - part of efforts to overhaul its creaking, colonial-era infrastructure."
General Electric,2017-9,But the railways ministry said last week it wouldn't need diesel after all - hoping to save on fuel and maintenance costs - and suggested GE might want to make electric engines instead.
General Electric,2017-9,"Electric engines are usually used for passenger trains, while diesel is used for freight. Around 25-30 percent of India's locomotives are diesel-engined."
General Electric,2017-9,The policy shift could cost New Delhi in compensation - GE is already building a factory for the diesel locos - but executives and investors say it is also an important test for a government that needs foreign investment to create jobs and reboot growth ahead of a 2019 general election.
General Electric,2017-9,"""The GE case is very important symbolically because they have been among the earliest and most committed investors,"" said Amitabh Dubey, a political analyst at research firm Trusted Sources."
General Electric,2017-9,"""People will be watching to see how this plays out, particularly because the railway contracts were initiatives that the government pushed consciously and worked very hard to get these people in. To then turn around two years later and change your strategy will bother a lot of people,"" he said."
General Electric,2017-9,"GE has already shipped its first diesel locomotive to India and is completing a factory in the state of Bihar. It has created around 1,000 jobs at the plant and a maintenance shed, and 5,000 jobs in the supplier network."
General Electric,2017-9,"In a statement, the U.S. firm said the government's change would put future foreign investment at risk."
General Electric,2017-9,"""An alteration of this contract will have serious impact on job creation and skills development, and cause the government to incur substantial costs,"" it said. ""This will also undermine government's signature 'Make in India' initiative."""
General Electric,2017-9,"Foreign direct investment (FDI) into India topped $60 billion in fiscal 2016-17, almost double the levels before Modi came to power in 2014."
General Electric,2017-9,"But after increasing by more than 20 percent in the first two years of the Modi government, FDI growth was less than half that rate in the latest financial year, hit by tax changes and a shock move to withdraw most of India's banknotes overnight."
General Electric,2017-9,"Yashwant Sinha, a veteran leader of Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and a former finance minister, said poorly executed policy shifts had stalled growth. ""Economies are destroyed more easily than they are built,"" he wrote in a newspaper column on Wednesday."

General Electric,2017-9,"In another example of shifting goalposts, India this month blindsided the auto industry by almost doubling the maximum levy on luxury cars and sport-utility vehicles (SUVs) - just weeks after first setting the rate as part of a major tax change. [nL4N1LN3JI]"
General Electric,2017-9,"Rahil Ansari, head of Audi India, said sudden shifts affect companies' ability to plan ahead, and could force changes."
General Electric,2017-9,"""This is bound to adversely impact sales, by possibly a double-digit reduction, and will reduce revenues for the company, dealers and perhaps also tax revenue for the government,"" he said."

General Electric,2017-9,"However, the government should give industry fair time to comply with new rules, and analyse its own contractual obligations, before changing policy, he added. ""There is no question that industry wants stability and predictability."""

General Electric,2017-9,{{20170925T111252.404+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-ABB's short-term value push takes $2.6 bln detour(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.)
General Electric,2017-9,"LONDON, Sept 25 (Reuters Breakingviews) - ABB's short-term shareholder value push just took a $2.6 billion detour. The Swiss engineering group is buying General Electric's industrial solutions unit despite past calls to shrink. The chance to boost lowly margins, however, means investors can live with the diversion."
General Electric,2017-9,"At first glance, an overseas acquisition seems the last thing the group led by Ulrich Spiesshofer should be doing. ABB has a worrying track record of underperforming rivals, and has faced calls from investors like activist Cevian to simplify by spinning off its power grids business."
General Electric,2017-9,"The acquisition of GE Industrial Solutions, based in Atlanta, brings in another 13,500 employees and sets back ABB's target of boosting margins in its Electrification Products division. The GE unit turned around 6 percent of its revenue into earnings before interest, tax and acquisition-related amortization costs last year; ABB is gunning for 15 to 19 percent by 2020."
General Electric,2017-9,"It also means Spiesshofer will shelve a $3 billion buyback programme announced last year as part of his ""next stage of unlocking value"" plan. In its place, shareholders in the Zurich-based group get an asset with an ageing portfolio and a declining share of the U.S. market."
General Electric,2017-9,"ABB shareholders are effectively being asked to swap the certainty of short-term buybacks for the prospect of potentially juicy synergies over a longer time period. Though that's not a sure-fire bet, the change of direction is more logical than it initially appeared."
General Electric,2017-9,- Swiss engineering group ABB said on Sept. 25 it will buy General Electric's Industrial Solutions business for $2.6 billion.
General Electric,2017-9,"- Products made by the GE unit include circuit breakers, switchgear and power supply equipment used for facilities including data centres."
General Electric,2017-9,"- The Zurich-based group expects annual cost synergies of around $200 million by the fifth year of the deal, which also grants ABB long-term rights to use the GE brand."
General Electric,2017-9,"- ABB will fund the deal with existing cash, and will put on hold a previously announced share buyback programme. The group led by Ulrich Spiesshofer in Oct. 2016 said it planned share buybacks of up to $3 billion from 2017 through to 2019."
General Electric,2017-9,- ABB shares were up 0.5 percent to 24.06 Swiss francs by 0855 BST.

General Electric,2017-9,"ZURICH, Sept 25 (Reuters) - Power grids maker ABB is buying General Electric's Industrial Solutions business for $2.6 billion in a bet it can improve the division's lacklustre margins over the next five years, the Swiss engineering company said on Monday."
General Electric,2017-9,"Zurich-based ABB sees potential for annual cost benefits of $200 million with the deal, which includes an agreement for long-term use of GE's brand and a strategic partnership. In 2016, the GE business had sales of $2.7 billion."
General Electric,2017-9,"The GE products include circuit breakers, switchgear, components for lighting control and power supply equipment for facilities including data centres. ABB's portfolio includes similar products."
General Electric,2017-9,ABB is seeking to better penetrate the North American market and gain access to GE's larger installed base of electrical installations worldwide.
General Electric,2017-9,"ABB said the business had been ""an unloved child"" and pledged to upgrade aging products with its own technology to help arrest a declining U.S. market share."
General Electric,2017-9,"ABB is suspending its $3 billion share buyback programme as part of the deal, which will bolster its position as the second-biggest supplier of electrical components behind France's Schneider Electric."
General Electric,2017-9,ABB is also wagering on being able to cut costs and boost profitability at the Georgia-based GE unit.
General Electric,2017-9,"""The key rationale of the integration is, first we will make this business better. And then afterwards, we will make this business bigger and better,"" said ABB Chief Executive Ulrich Spiesshofer."
General Electric,2017-9,"The GE unit's operating earnings before interest, taxes and amortisation (EBITA) are just 6 percent of sales, less than half the 15 percent operating margin at ABB's comparable Electrification Products division."
General Electric,2017-9,Spiesshofer said he agreed to the transaction only after striking a supply partnership where ABB and GE will increase buying and selling from each another.
General Electric,2017-9,"""Without that, the economics wouldn't have worked,"" he told reporters on a call. ""With the supply partnership, the economics at the price of 0.9 times revenue is working."""
General Electric,2017-9,GE has been under pressure from activist investor Nelson Peltz's Trian Fund Management to sell assets and focus on higher-margin businesses. [nL3N1J93DT]
General Electric,2017-9,Some analysts said the price was surprisingly high given the GE business's low profitability.
General Electric,2017-9,"""GE Industrial Solutions isn't in top shape, so ABB has its work cut out for it,"" said Zuercher Kantonalbank analyst Richard Frei."
General Electric,2017-9,ABB said it would finance the deal -- likely its last for some time -- with cash and did not need to raise equity capital. Its shares were little changed in early trading.
General Electric,2017-9,"GE had resumed negotiations to sell the business to ABB after moderating its price expectations, people familiar with the matter told Reuters in August. [nL8N1L95US]"
General Electric,2017-9,"Credit Suisse and Dyal Co acted as financial advisers to ABB, and Davis Polk & Wardwell provided legal counsel."

General Electric,2017-9,ATR challenges Pratt's hold on turboprop engine market - Reuters News
General Electric,2017-9,"{{20170913T180325.588+0000}}ATR challenges Pratt's hold on turboprop engine marketPARIS, Sept 13 (Reuters) - Pratt & Whitney's grip on the regional turboprop market could come under threat after Europe's ATR said it would look closely at alternative engines for its planes in future."
General Electric,2017-9,"Christian Scherer, who took over as chief executive of the world's largest maker of civil turboprops last year, told Reuters on Wednesday he would open the door to other potential suppliers as soon as he could."
General Electric,2017-9,"Pratt, which is struggling to reassert itself in the passenger jet market, enjoys an effective monopoly in the market for smaller regional turboprops via its Canadian subsidiary."
General Electric,2017-9,ATR and Canada's Bombardier dominate the market of about 100 aircraft a year and both exclusively use PW&C engines.
General Electric,2017-9,"The most obvious beneficiary from any decision by ATR to switch engine suppliers would be General Electric which is developing an ""Advanced Turboprop"", so far aimed at the business and general aviation markets."
General Electric,2017-9,Planemakers and airlines typically prefer competition in the engine market in order to drive down the prices for engines and the all-important aftermarket services.
General Electric,2017-9,"Although China is vying to enter the turboprop market with its Xian MA700 aircraft, even this is being developed with engines from PW&C, underlining the U.S. firm's strong position."

General Electric,2017-9,"HOUSTON, Sept 8 (Reuters) - The world's largest oilfield services company, Schlumberger NV , is spending billions of dollars buying stakes in its customers' oil and gas projects - investing in the same ventures it supplies with equipment and expertise."
General Electric,2017-9,"The new business model gives Schlumberger a say in drilling decisions, oilfield management and even on hiring other Schlumberger units for service contracts, the company has told investors."
General Electric,2017-9,The expanded operational authority saves Schlumberger from bidding for each of the many jobs that typically require separate contracts on a large drilling project - effectively locking out the firm's competitors.
General Electric,2017-9,"Schlumberger's gamble could upend the service business model throughout the industry, as rivals including General Electric Co's unit Baker Hughes say they are considering whether to adopt similar strategies."
General Electric,2017-9,"The model can supercharge profits on a given job but also ramps up risk, giving the firm more exposure to global oil price swings and potentially big losses if individual projects fail. The downsides have some analysts questioning whether the traditionally conservative firm is taking on too many speculative projects too quickly."
General Electric,2017-9,"Schlumberger already has taken hundreds of millions in write-downs or impairments on some of these joint ventures, according to its financial filings."
General Electric,2017-9,"Traditionally, oil producers manage the risk and make the financial and operational decisions on projects; they pay service providers a fee to carry out individual jobs. Firms such as Schlumberger typically supply a wide variety of services, such as well design, along with technology and staff to run rigs."
General Electric,2017-9,Schlumberger declined to make executives available for interviews and did not respond to written questions about its production business.
General Electric,2017-9,"Despite early setbacks, Schlumberger has committed cash to growing the division, called Schlumberger Production Management, since its launch in 2011. Last year, it generated $1.4 billion in revenue. It had investment of $2.6 billion as of June 30, Schlumberger Executive Vice President Patrick Schorn told investors earlier this summer."
General Electric,2017-9,"The company's investments have the firm co-managing about 230,000 barrels a day of oil and gas output at the end of 2016 - about as much as one of the largest U.S. independent producers, Pioneer Natural Resources ."
General Electric,2017-9,"This year, the company stepped up the financing role, opening a standalone investment fund to provide financing for the ventures. The company has not disclosed the size of the fund."
General Electric,2017-9,Such ventures require a breadth of skills and a tolerance for risk generally found at large integrated oil companies such as Chevron Corp and Exxon Mobil Corp .
General Electric,2017-9,Two of Schlumberger's newest partnerships - a deepwater liquefied natural gas project off the coast of Equatorial Guinea and an Argentina shale development with YPF SA - involve decision-making and operational authority similar to that typically held by multinational oil producers.
General Electric,2017-9,"In June, Schlumberger agreed to invest $700 million in an oil exploration project with Nigerian National Petroleum Corp and First Exploration & Production that would require global oil prices of between $50 to $60 a barrel to achieve a 20 percent profit, research house Bernstein estimated in a report published in July. Current prices are struggling to break out of the bottom of that range."
General Electric,2017-9,"As Schlumberger's production business has grown, it has negotiated deals that include equity in oil and gas fields and as well as deals that give the firm payment based on oil and gas output, according to interviews with customers, partners, investors and former Schlumberger executives."
General Electric,2017-9,"Schlumberger this year agreed to contribute $390 million for a 49 percent stake in a venture with YPF in Argentina's Vaca Muerta shale field, which has attracted international oil firms including Chevron and Royal Dutch Shell ."
General Electric,2017-9,Schlumberger Chief Executive Paal Kibsgaard has downplayed the potential for its production business to compete with its own oil company customers.
General Electric,2017-9,"He described the enterprise as ""a new avenue for project investments alongside our customers"" in remarks to investors in April."
General Electric,2017-9,"Schorn also insisted this spring that the business is ""not significantly changing the risk profile ... the biggest risk remains the cyclical nature"" of the oil and gas industry."
General Electric,2017-9,"Investors say Schlumberger, which held $6.22 billion in cash and short-term investments at June 30, is strong enough to handle any increased risks and the price volatility of its investments in long-term projects."
General Electric,2017-9,"As both project manager and service provider, Schlumberger also has an enviable level of control over operations, said Mike Breard of Dallas-based wealth management firm Hodges Capital, which invests in oilfield service companies."
General Electric,2017-9,"British-based natural gas explorer Sound Energy PLC was happy to give Schlumberger full rights to the service contracts on drilling projects in Morocco in exchange for a Schlumberger investment amounting to 27 percent of total costs, said the chief of British-based natural gas explorer."
General Electric,2017-9,Schlumberger will get 27.5 percent of revenue from the oil produced.
General Electric,2017-9,"""We're smaller and entrepreneurial. Schlumberger has the technical capability and cash. That's the nature of the partnership,"" Sound CEO James Parsons said in an interview."
General Electric,2017-9,The duo has completed three wells in Morocco and plans to drill three more by year end.
General Electric,2017-9,"""It's a $50 [million] or $60 million bet for them so far,"" Parsons said."
General Electric,2017-9,"Schlumberger's appetite for these ventures is spurring rivals to consider similar financing and services deals. Baker Hughes recently agreed to provide about $10 million in financing to Twinza Oil's first offshore gas field in Papua New Guinea, supplying the cash to prove the merits of the field."
General Electric,2017-9,"""It allows Twinza to have success in going out to raise financing,"" Baker Hughes CEO Lorenzo Simonelli said."
General Electric,2017-9,"Baker Hughes will not take a stake in the oilfield, unlike some of Schlumberger's joint investments with producers."
General Electric,2017-9,"In 2014 and 2015, Schlumberger took nearly $400 million in combined write-offs on oil production investments, including an Eagle Ford shale field in south Texas that struggled after oil prices crashed."
General Electric,2017-9,"It also is owed about $900 million by Ecuador. In July, the South American country said it had negotiated a payment plan that includes an expanded contract that has Schlumberger agreeing to invest another $1 billion in the venture."
General Electric,2017-9,Schlumberger hasn't commented on the South American nation's disclosure. It previously acknowledged taking Ecuadorian bonds in lieu of cash for $150 million in bills. It also previously estimated its investment in the projects at up to $4.9 billion over 20 years.
General Electric,2017-9,The write downs have stirred some on Wall Street to question whether Schlumberger should take more conservative path with its oil production partnerships.
General Electric,2017-9,"The firm's production division ""used to focus on production management of well understood low-risk oil fields,"" said Colin Davies, a Bernstein oilfield services analyst. ""Now it has expanded into frankly somewhat more speculative ventures."""

General Electric,2017-9,Two of Schlumberger's newest partnerships - a deepwater liquefied natural gas project off the coast of Equatorial Guinea and an Argentina shale development with YPF SA - involve decision-making and operational authority similar to that typically held by multinational oil producers.
General Electric,2017-9,"In June, Schlumberger agreed to invest $700 million in an oil exploration project with Nigerian National Petroleum Corp and First Exploration & Production that would require global oil prices of between $50 to $60 a barrel to achieve a 20 percent profit, research house Bernstein estimated in a report published in July. Current prices are struggling to break out of the bottom of that range."
General Electric,2017-9,"As Schlumberger's production business has grown, it has negotiated deals that include equity in oil and gas fields and as well as deals that give the firm payment based on oil and gas output, according to interviews with customers, partners, investors and former Schlumberger executives."

General Electric,2017-9,{{20170907T191416.038+0000}}UPDATE 1-Swiss utility BKW jumps into nuclear plant dismantling business* DfN already works with BKW at Muehleberg station
General Electric,2017-9,"ZURICH, Sept 7 (Reuters) - Swiss utility BKW AG bought a small German nuclear services company on Thursday, joining firms including GE that are banking on rising revenue from the decommissioning of European nuclear plants."
General Electric,2017-9,"BKW, which plans to dismantle its own Muehleberg nuclear station after shuttering it in 2019, bought Dienstleistungen fuer Nukleartechnik GmbH (DfN). Its services include verifying that components removed from nuclear facilities are no longer radioactive. [nL8N1DS0MF]"
General Electric,2017-9,"Other companies, including Finland's Fortum , privately held U.S.-based Bechtel and the GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy alliance, are also seeking to benefit from plant decommissioning in Sweden as well as Germany. [nL8N1LM42M]"
General Electric,2017-9,Germany decided to exit nuclear power by 2022 following the Fukushima disaster in Japan in 2011.
General Electric,2017-9,"Similarly, energy groups E.ON and EnBW , which are now tearing down their German nuclear plants, are seeking to parlay newfound dismantling expertise by offering similar services elsewhere in the world."
General Electric,2017-9,"With its acquisition of DfN, BKW hopes to capitalise on a growing sector. DfN is already working on five plants that are in the process of being decommissioned, BKW said."
General Electric,2017-9,"""Germany has many decommissioning projects either underway or in the works with the planned or already completed shuttering of nuclear power stations,"" BKW said in a statement."
General Electric,2017-9,"""That will open significant growth potential for DfN in the area of radiation protection services,"" it said."
General Electric,2017-9,"BKW's DfN will be a comparatively tiny player, with 22 employees. BKW declined to disclose financial details of the transaction or current or projected revenue for DfN."
General Electric,2017-9,"That compares E.ON's 650 staff at its PreussenElektra decommissioning unit and GE Hitachi's 3,000 employees."
General Electric,2017-9,"French water and waste giant Veolia has also started selling nuclear dismantling and decommissioning services in recent years, while France's EDF is expected to enter the business after its acquisition of Areva NP."
General Electric,2017-9,"DfN will not compete with larger companies that will be in charge of decommissioning, BKW said, but instead will offer complementary services necessary to completing the projects."
General Electric,2017-9,"""The services from DfN accompany the decommissioning projects but will cover niche activities that require very special qualifications and authorisation,"" a spokeswoman said."
General Electric,2017-9,"Switzerland has five reactors including Beznau 1, the world's oldest operating nuclear plant that was powered up in 1969."
General Electric,2017-9,"BKW has worked with the Heidelberg-based company since it was founded in 2009 on radiation protection for its Muehleberg station, the Bern-based utility said. DfN's head, Martin Herzner, will continue to run the unit."

General Electric,2017-9,"HOUSTON, Sept 8 (Reuters) - The world's largest oilfield services company, Schlumberger NV , is spending billions of dollars buying stakes in its customers' oil and gas projects - investing in the same ventures it supplies with equipment and expertise."
General Electric,2017-9,"The new business model gives Schlumberger a say in drilling decisions, oilfield management and even on hiring other Schlumberger units for service contracts, the company has told investors."
General Electric,2017-9,The expanded operational authority saves Schlumberger from bidding for each of the many jobs that typically require separate contracts on a large drilling project - effectively locking out the firm's competitors.
General Electric,2017-9,"Schlumberger's gamble could upend the service business model throughout the industry, as rivals including General Electric Co's unit Baker Hughes say they are considering whether to adopt similar strategies."
General Electric,2017-9,"The model can supercharge profits on a given job but also ramps up risk, giving the firm more exposure to global oil price swings and potentially big losses if individual projects fail. The downsides have some analysts questioning whether the traditionally conservative firm is taking on too many speculative projects too quickly."
General Electric,2017-9,"Schlumberger already has taken hundreds of millions in write-downs or impairments on some of these joint ventures, according to its financial filings."
General Electric,2017-9,"Traditionally, oil producers manage the risk and make the financial and operational decisions on projects; they pay service providers a fee to carry out individual jobs. Firms such as Schlumberger typically supply a wide variety of services, such as well design, along with technology and staff to run rigs."
General Electric,2017-9,Schlumberger declined to make executives available for interviews and did not respond to written questions about its production business.
General Electric,2017-9,"Despite early setbacks, Schlumberger has committed cash to growing the division, called Schlumberger Production Management, since its launch in 2011. Last year, it generated $1.4 billion in revenue. It had investment of $2.6 billion as of June 30, Schlumberger Executive Vice President Patrick Schorn told investors earlier this summer."

General Electric,2017-9,"In June, Schlumberger agreed to invest $700 million in an oil exploration project with Nigerian National Petroleum Corp and First Exploration & Production that would require global oil prices of between $50 to $60 a barrel to achieve a 20 percent profit, research house Bernstein estimated in a report published in July. Current prices are struggling to break out of the bottom of that range."
General Electric,2017-9,"As Schlumberger's production business has grown, it has negotiated deals that include equity in oil and gas fields and as well as deals that give the firm payment based on oil and gas output, according to interviews with customers, partners, investors and former Schlumberger executives."
General Electric,2017-9,"Schlumberger this year agreed to contribute $390 million for a 49 percent stake in a venture with YPF in Argentina's Vaca Muerta shale field, which has attracted international oil firms including Chevron and Royal Dutch Shell ."
General Electric,2017-9,Schlumberger Chief Executive Paal Kibsgaard has downplayed the potential for its production business to compete with its own oil company customers.
General Electric,2017-9,"He described the enterprise as ""a new avenue for project investments alongside our customers"" in remarks to investors in April."
General Electric,2017-9,"Schorn also insisted this spring that the business is ""not significantly changing the risk profile ... the biggest risk remains the cyclical nature"" of the oil and gas industry."
General Electric,2017-9,"Investors say Schlumberger, which held $6.22 billion in cash and short-term investments at June 30, is strong enough to handle any increased risks and the price volatility of its investments in long-term projects."
General Electric,2017-9,"As both project manager and service provider, Schlumberger also has an enviable level of control over operations, said Mike Breard of Dallas-based wealth management firm Hodges Capital, which invests in oilfield service companies."
General Electric,2017-9,"British-based natural gas explorer Sound Energy PLC was happy to give Schlumberger full rights to the service contracts on drilling projects in Morocco in exchange for a Schlumberger investment amounting to 27 percent of total costs, said the chief of British-based natural gas explorer."
General Electric,2017-9,Schlumberger will get 27.5 percent of revenue from the oil produced.
General Electric,2017-9,"""We're smaller and entrepreneurial. Schlumberger has the technical capability and cash. That's the nature of the partnership,"" Sound CEO James Parsons said in an interview."
General Electric,2017-9,The duo has completed three wells in Morocco and plans to drill three more by year end.
General Electric,2017-9,"""It's a $50 [million] or $60 million bet for them so far,"" Parsons said."
General Electric,2017-9,"Schlumberger's appetite for these ventures is spurring rivals to consider similar financing and services deals. Baker Hughes recently agreed to provide about $10 million in financing to Twinza Oil's first offshore gas field in Papua New Guinea, supplying the cash to prove the merits of the field."
General Electric,2017-9,"""It allows Twinza to have success in going out to raise financing,"" Baker Hughes CEO Lorenzo Simonelli said."
General Electric,2017-9,"Baker Hughes will not take a stake in the oilfield, unlike some of Schlumberger's joint investments with producers."
General Electric,2017-9,"In 2014 and 2015, Schlumberger took nearly $400 million in combined write-offs on oil production investments, including an Eagle Ford shale field in south Texas that struggled after oil prices crashed."
General Electric,2017-9,"It also is owed about $900 million by Ecuador. In July, the South American country said it had negotiated a payment plan that includes an expanded contract that has Schlumberger agreeing to invest another $1 billion in the venture."
General Electric,2017-9,Schlumberger hasn't commented on the South American nation's disclosure. It previously acknowledged taking Ecuadorian bonds in lieu of cash for $150 million in bills. It also previously estimated its investment in the projects at up to $4.9 billion over 20 years.
General Electric,2017-9,The write downs have stirred some on Wall Street to question whether Schlumberger should take more conservative path with its oil production partnerships.
General Electric,2017-9,"The firm's production division ""used to focus on production management of well understood low-risk oil fields,"" said Colin Davies, a Bernstein oilfield services analyst. ""Now it has expanded into frankly somewhat more speculative ventures."""

General Electric,2017-9,{{20170907T191416.038+0000}}UPDATE 1-Swiss utility BKW jumps into nuclear plant dismantling business* DfN already works with BKW at Muehleberg station
General Electric,2017-9,"ZURICH, Sept 7 (Reuters) - Swiss utility BKW AG bought a small German nuclear services company on Thursday, joining firms including GE that are banking on rising revenue from the decommissioning of European nuclear plants."
General Electric,2017-9,"BKW, which plans to dismantle its own Muehleberg nuclear station after shuttering it in 2019, bought Dienstleistungen fuer Nukleartechnik GmbH (DfN). Its services include verifying that components removed from nuclear facilities are no longer radioactive. [nL8N1DS0MF]"
General Electric,2017-9,"Other companies, including Finland's Fortum , privately held U.S.-based Bechtel and the GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy alliance, are also seeking to benefit from plant decommissioning in Sweden as well as Germany. [nL8N1LM42M]"
General Electric,2017-9,Germany decided to exit nuclear power by 2022 following the Fukushima disaster in Japan in 2011.
General Electric,2017-9,"Similarly, energy groups E.ON and EnBW , which are now tearing down their German nuclear plants, are seeking to parlay newfound dismantling expertise by offering similar services elsewhere in the world."
General Electric,2017-9,"With its acquisition of DfN, BKW hopes to capitalise on a growing sector. DfN is already working on five plants that are in the process of being decommissioned, BKW said."
General Electric,2017-9,"""Germany has many decommissioning projects either underway or in the works with the planned or already completed shuttering of nuclear power stations,"" BKW said in a statement."
General Electric,2017-9,"""That will open significant growth potential for DfN in the area of radiation protection services,"" it said."
General Electric,2017-9,"BKW's DfN will be a comparatively tiny player, with 22 employees. BKW declined to disclose financial details of the transaction or current or projected revenue for DfN."
General Electric,2017-9,"That compares E.ON's 650 staff at its PreussenElektra decommissioning unit and GE Hitachi's 3,000 employees."
General Electric,2017-9,"French water and waste giant Veolia has also started selling nuclear dismantling and decommissioning services in recent years, while France's EDF is expected to enter the business after its acquisition of Areva NP."
General Electric,2017-9,"DfN will not compete with larger companies that will be in charge of decommissioning, BKW said, but instead will offer complementary services necessary to completing the projects."
General Electric,2017-9,"""The services from DfN accompany the decommissioning projects but will cover niche activities that require very special qualifications and authorisation,"" a spokeswoman said."
General Electric,2017-9,"Switzerland has five reactors including Beznau 1, the world's oldest operating nuclear plant that was powered up in 1969."
General Electric,2017-9,"BKW has worked with the Heidelberg-based company since it was founded in 2009 on radiation protection for its Muehleberg station, the Bern-based utility said. DfN's head, Martin Herzner, will continue to run the unit."

General Electric,2017-9,"OTTAWA, Sept 6 (Reuters) - Canada, embroiled in a dispute with Boeing Co over the planned purchase of 18 new Super Hornet fighters, could buy older jets from Australia instead, the defense ministry said on Wednesday."
General Electric,2017-9,The Liberal government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau suspended talks with Boeing over a possible acquisition after the U.S. firm launched a trade challenge against Canadian planemaker Bombardier Inc . [nL1N1IY1KC]
General Electric,2017-9,"Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan says Canada needs the 18 jets as a stopgap measure until it can run a competition to replace its CF-18 fighters. The CF-18 is Canada's version of the F-18, a design that is 40 years old."
General Electric,2017-9,"""In light of Australia recently notifying all allies about their intent to dispose of their F-18 fleet, Canada visited them to inquire about the state of their equipment and spare parts,"" Sajjan's office said in a statement."
General Electric,2017-9,"""It is too early to provide detailed information about other options,"" it added."
General Electric,2017-9,Boeing declined to comment. The Australian High Commission (embassy) did not reply to a request for comment.
General Electric,2017-9,Sajjan spokeswoman Jordan Owens said Canada had not visited other nations to assess their planes.
General Electric,2017-9,"Trudeau on Tuesday slammed Boeing's ""unfair and aggressive"" challenge against Bombardier, which the U.S. firm alleges is dumping passenger planes in the American market. [nL2N1LM285]"
General Electric,2017-9,"Boeing's Canadian network of aerospace suppliers on Tuesday urged Trudeau to buy the Super Hornets, noting the firm supported more than 17,000 jobs in Canada."
General Electric,2017-9,"""Our partnership is deep and enduring, but it needs your engagement,"" said a letter from 10 firms, a copy of which was seen by Reuters."
General Electric,2017-9,"Signatories included CAE Inc , Heroux Devtek Inc and Honeywell International Inc. as well as the Canadian arms of General Electric Co and Raytheon Co ."
General Electric,2017-9,"CAE, which has close ties to Bombardier, later noted the letter had not mentioned the Boeing dispute."
General Electric,2017-9,"Asked for a reaction to the letter, a source familiar with government thinking said the Canadian aerospace sector supported many jobs in the United States."
General Electric,2017-9,Australia bought 24 Super Hornets as an interim fleet until it could take delivery of F-35 planes from Lockheed Martin Corp .
General Electric,2017-9,"Canada's former Conservative government said in 2010 it would buy 65 F-35s but later scrapped the decision, triggering years of delays and reviews."
General Electric,2017-9,"Ahead of the 2015 election that brought him to power, Trudeau campaigned against buying the F-35 on the grounds it was too expensive. Officials now say the plane would be eligible to participate in the competition. [nL1N1E7170]"

General Electric,2017-9,"{{20170906T205431.682+0000}}ABB plans expansion in U.S., scouting for acquisitions, CEO saysBy Joseph White"
General Electric,2017-9,"DETROIT, Sept 6 (Reuters) - ABB Ltd plans to expand its U.S. industrial robot factory in Michigan, the company's chief executive officer said on Wednesday, while declining to comment on reports that he is weighing the purchase of a unit of rival General Electric Co ."
General Electric,2017-9,"Ulrich Spiesshofer, who took over as CEO of ABB in 2013, said in an interview that the company plans to expand its industrial robot manufacturing facility in Auburn Hills, Michigan, which delivered its first robot in March. He declined to offer details on new jobs or investment. ABB currently has a workforce of about 1,000 at the Auburn Hills complex."
General Electric,2017-9,"Zurich-based ABB is counting on continued growth in demand for industrial robots from automakers and other sectors, such as the food and beverage industry, Spiesshofer said."
General Electric,2017-9,"U.S. automakers have caught up with Japanese and German rivals in the level of factory automation, Spiesshofer said. ""The next phase is about portfolio differentiation and expansion,"" as automakers build more electric cars, he said."
General Electric,2017-9,Spiesshofer has been reshaping ABB's portfolio of businesses through acquisitions and divestitures for the past four years. He declined to comment on whether he is discussing the acquisition of GE's industrial solutions business.
General Electric,2017-9,"People familiar with the situation said last month that GE and ABB had restarted talks after GE cut the asking price of the business, which sells industrial electrical equipment. [nL8N1L95US]"
General Electric,2017-9,"ABB is scouting for potential acquisitions in certain areas, such as planning software, and those would likely be smaller deals, Spiesshofer said."
General Electric,2017-9,"ABB will be ""brutally disciplined"" in what it buys, he said, noting that the company ""could have afforded"" to buy industrial robot maker Kuka last year, but walked away ""because the economics did not fit what we want to do."""
General Electric,2017-9,"In a presentation on Wednesday, Spiesshofer reaffirmed that, after what he called a ""transitional year"" in 2017, ABB should begin hitting its goals for revenue growth of 3 to 6 percent, and returns on capital investments in the ""mid-teens."""
General Electric,2017-9,Spiesshofer said problems with excess capacity in the robotics and motion business that hit second-quarter results should be resolved by growth in business.
General Electric,2017-9,"""I am confident for the full year we will be back"" within a profit margin range of 15 to 18 percent, he said. Operating margins for ABB's robotics and motion business were 14.9 percent in the second quarter."

In second sentence of 4th paragraph, corrects to say Michaels does not see a regulatory issue, not that this could be a bigger issue.))"
General Electric,2017-9,"PARIS/NEW YORK/WASHINGTON, Sept 5 (Reuters) - U.S. aerospace and industrial company United Technologies Corp faces a long road to win approval for its $23 billion plan to buy avionics maker Rockwell Collins Inc , and the biggest bumps could be in Brussels rather than Washington."
General Electric,2017-9,"United Tech and Rockwell, who both supply airplane makers, say the overlap in their product lines is relatively small. Yet opponents of the deal could argue the combination gives the aircraft parts supply company undue market power."
General Electric,2017-9,"The combined company could make more than 50 percent of the systems content on a Boeing 787 aircraft, by dollar value, noted Kevin Michaels, president of consulting firm AeroDynamic Advisory, referring to such components as flight controls and air conditioning. Michaels said he does not see the deal facing an issue from a competitive standpoint as there is virtually no overlap in products between the two companies."
General Electric,2017-9,"Rockwell's shares rose 0.3 percent to $131.00 while United Tech shares fell 5.7 percent to $111.21, in part on the warning from Boeing. [nL2N1LM0KR]"
General Electric,2017-9,"There was also a sign that Airbus is preparing to ratchet up pressure behind the scenes. A source close to the European plane maker told Reuters there were concerns about a ""disconnect"" between United Technologies and the leadership of its Pratt & Whitney unit. Another Airbus source said any distraction due to the merger would benefit Pratt & Whitney's main rival CFM International, co-owned by the U.S. manufacturer General Electric Co and France's Safran ."
General Electric,2017-9,"Problems at Pratt & Whitney have delayed European aircraft deliveries, and Airbus has publicly warned United Tech to focus on delivering jet engines on time. [nP6N1JF00H]"
General Electric,2017-9,"If Boeing or Airbus opts to complain to antitrust enforcers, they can take the complaint to Europe's competition authority and either the U.S. Justice Department or Federal Trade Commission, both of which review proposed mergers for compliance with antitrust law."
General Electric,2017-9,Their strongest argument would be if both companies made one or several parts and had few competitors.
General Electric,2017-9,"""Many initially assumed it would be a slam dunk because of the lack of overlap. But the EU probe may prove to be difficult, simply on the grounds that the combined company would be so big,"" said Nick Cunningham, aerospace analyst at UK-based Agency Partners."
General Electric,2017-9,"Boeing could also be concerned about the ""portfolio effect,"" where companies are able to exercise leverage based on the fact that they sell a wide range of specialized products to certain customers."
General Electric,2017-9,"This argument was used to doom GE's plan to buy Honeywell in 2001, although it was European regulators rather than Washington who killed that deal."
General Electric,2017-9,"Boeing or other companies objecting to the deal could complain about a loss of competition. That would be the case if the government proves that either United Tech or Rockwell had plans to expand to compete with the other, said James Tierney, a former Justice Department antitrust expert now at the law firm Orrick."
General Electric,2017-9,"Antitrust enforcers would also be concerned by the reduced number of market players if United Tech and Rockwell were among the few companies that Boeing or Airbus could reach out to resolve technical problems, said Tierney."
General Electric,2017-9,"That concern would be amplified if the Defense Department agreed, said Tierney."
General Electric,2017-9,"Both the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission review proposed mergers to ensure they are legal under antitrust law. It is unclear which of the agencies would review this deal, antitrust experts said."

General Electric,2017-9,"{{20170905T194317.335+0000}}UPDATE 5-UTC touts $23 bln deal as stock drops, Boeing turns critic(Recasts and adds detail)"
General Electric,2017-9,"NEW YORK, Sept 5 (Reuters) - Investors and Boeing Co gave two thumbs down on Tuesday to aerospace and industrial company United Technologies Corp $23 billion plan to buy avionics maker Rockwell Collins Inc ."
General Electric,2017-9,"The acquisition, announced on Monday, would be the largest in aerospace history and create a new player in the top echelon of suppliers to Boeing, Airbus, Bombardier and other plane makers. [nL2N1LL17P]"
General Electric,2017-9,"United Tech shares were down 5.2 percent after Boeing said it would and use the power granted by its contracts with the companies, and its sway with regulators, ""to protect our interests."" [nL2N1LM15K]"
General Electric,2017-9,"The stock had fallen more than 4 percent before Boeing's statement, as analysts factored in United Tech's decision to halt share buybacks for three to four years and earnings dilution caused by the cash-and-stock deal. Analysts expected $2 billion in buybacks in the second half of 2017 alone."
General Electric,2017-9,The loss of years of buybacks and Boeing's unusual blowback came as plane makers are pressing United Tech and other suppliers for price cuts and trying to compete against them on high-margin services and spare parts.
General Electric,2017-9,"By making more of the components used on each Boeing and Airbus SE aircraft, analysts say, United Technologies-Rockwell Collins would gain leverage to resist that pressure."
General Electric,2017-9,"United Tech Chief Executive Greg Hayes, who would lead the combined company, brushed aside Boeing's concerns."
General Electric,2017-9,"""The whole idea of this deal is to be able to drive more innovative solutions at lower cost for our customers - both the (plane makers) and the airlines,"" Hayes told Reuters on Tuesday, shortly before Boeing issued its criticism."
General Electric,2017-9,"Rockwell's skill with software combined with United Tech's expertise in numerous aircraft components allows the company to offer new ""digital"" products that airlines want, he said."
General Electric,2017-9,"""We'll be able to do predictive analytics that many others can't do, and that's how you add value to airline customers,"" Hayes said, referring to data-crunching that allows airlines to spot problems in engines and other components before they fail."
General Electric,2017-9,Hayes said he had assured Airbus CEO Tom Enders that United Tech's Pratt & Whitney unit will stay on track to deliver between 350 and 400 jetliner engines this year.
General Electric,2017-9,"United Tech fell behind on engine deliveries this year due to production problems, and Airbus raised concern last week about the deal distracting United Tech. [nL2N1LH0WI]"
General Electric,2017-9,"""Pratt has nothing to do with this,"" Hayes said, noting United Tech's aerospace unit, not Pratt, will combine with Rockwell Collins to create Collins Aerospace."
General Electric,2017-9,"Hayes also knocked down speculation that the purchase would prompt United Tech to spin off its Carrier air conditioner or Otis elevator units, saying the company needs their cash flow to help pay down debt from the deal."
General Electric,2017-9,But Hayes did not rule out such sales in the longer term.
General Electric,2017-9,"""After the deal is done, and after we pay down some debt, we're going to go back and look,"" he said."
General Electric,2017-9,"If the company's share price does not reflect its value, he said, ""we'll need to do something."""
General Electric,2017-9,"United Tech could sell ""non-core pieces"" such as home security in the meantime, Hayes said. But given taxes and lost earnings, ""it's hard to make financial sense out of those transactions"" unless they fetch a high price, he said."
General Electric,2017-9,"Rockwell's shares rose 0.3 percent to $131.00 in afternoon trading. United Tech shares, part of the Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI>, fell 5.2 percent to $111.82."
General Electric,2017-9,"""We see limited upside near term as share repurchase is withdrawn and deal timing becomes an investor focus,"" analyst Jeff Sprague at Vertical Research Partners said in a note."
General Electric,2017-9,"United Tech's engines and systems portfolio has little overlap with the avionics, seats and interiors businesses of Rockwell, which Hayes said should mean little trouble during the necessary regulatory review."
General Electric,2017-9,"The combination, if successful, would mark the rise of a second engines-to-seating supplier, after jet-engine maker Safran SA's pending $7.7-billion deal to buy seat maker Zodiac Aerospace . Safran said on Tuesday it would look at assets that might come up for sale after the United Tech-Rockwell deal. [nL8N1LM2UL]"
General Electric,2017-9,"United Tech expects to borrow $15 billion and will assume $7 billion in Rockwell debt to fund the deal, which is expected to close by the third quarter of 2018. [nL2N1LL17P]"
General Electric,2017-9,United Tech said the acquisition would add to earnings in its first full year and yield at least $500 million in cost savings by the fourth year of operation.
