General Electric,2017-10,UPDATE 2-Wind turbine makers say U.S. tax proposal puts investment at risk - Reuters News
General Electric,2017-10,{{20171103T143550.799+0000}}UPDATE 2-Wind turbine makers say U.S. tax proposal puts investment at risk* Vestas shares down as much as 12 pct
General Electric,2017-10,"COPENHAGEN/FRANKFURT, Nov 3 (Reuters) - The world's largest wind turbine makers said a proposed Republican tax bill that would cut support for the industry in the U.S. would put its businesses and future investment at risk, in a rare public criticism on Friday of government proposals."
General Electric,2017-10,"Equipment makers operating in the world's second-largest wind turbine market have relied upon so-called production tax credits (PTC) agreed in 2015. In a new tax bill, unveiled late on Thursday, the PTC would be cut to 1.5 dollar cents per kilowatt hour (kWh) from 2.4 cents. [nL2N1N81U1]"
General Electric,2017-10,"Shares in Denmark's Vestas , the world's largest maker of wind turbines fell as much as 12 percent on Friday, due to its large exposure to the U.S. market, where it overtook GE last year in installed capacity. [nL5N1FV2TV]"
General Electric,2017-10,"Shares in Siemens Gamesa and Germany's Nordex , which also operate in the U.S. along with General Electric , were all down."
General Electric,2017-10,"""Siemens Gamesa is disappointed in this step backwards. Our company is committed to this market and continues to invest in factories. A tax policy that has certainty is required for investment,"" the group said in an e-mailed statement."
General Electric,2017-10,"Vestas said the proposal was ""disappointing"". GE said the group was carefully reviewing the details of the bill, which could still face changes as it needs to pass both the House of Representatives and the Senate."
General Electric,2017-10,The tax credit scheme was considered critical to enabling wind projects to compete with fossil fuel plants and the wind energy industry has said the proposed cuts put $50 billion in planned investment at risk.[nL2N1N8251]
General Electric,2017-10,The planned legislative step comes after long-standing industry concerns that Trump might curb support for renewable energy to promote coal and other fossil fuels instead.
General Electric,2017-10,"""Even though Mr. Trump and team are not necessarily known for their adherence to the 'usual', we feel they are unlikely to be unaware of the wide-ranging consequences ... of the government essentially breaking open private contracts,"" Barclays wrote."
General Electric,2017-10,"""After all, what would there be to stop them from retroactively doing so elsewhere too?"""
General Electric,2017-10,"Analysts at Goldman Sachs reckon that in this bear case scenario wind capacity expansion in the United States could fall sharply to a combined 10 gigawatts (GW) in 2019 and 2020, less than half the 26 GW it expects under its base case model."
General Electric,2017-10,"The brokerage expects another consequence of the proposed PCT cut to be a fall in 2019 core earnings (EBITDA) at Vestas and Nordex of about 18 percent and 10 percent for Siemens Gamesa, whose market share has fallen in recent years. [nL8N1N74B7]"

General Electric,2017-10,Shareholder sues GE after 'unacceptable' results hurt stock - Reuters News
General Electric,2017-10,{{20171102T164255.688+0000}}Shareholder sues GE after 'unacceptable' results hurt stockBy Jonathan Stempel
General Electric,2017-10,"NEW YORK, Nov 2 (Reuters) - Two weeks after General Electric Co's new chief executive vowed to shed $20 billion of assets, a shareholder has sued the company for failing to divulge its problems sooner and posting quarterly results that were ""unacceptable, to say the least."""
General Electric,2017-10,"In a proposed class-action lawsuit filed Wednesday night in the U.S. District Court in Manhattan, Jihad Hachem accused GE of securities fraud for concealing how falling demand, excess inventory and higher costs would cause it fall far short of its 2017 profit forecast, and led to an inflated stock price."
General Electric,2017-10,"GE's market value slid $11 billion in the two trading days after the Boston-based company on Oct. 20 reported a third-quarter profit of 29 cents per share, below the 49 cents expected by analysts, and cut its 2017 profit forecast by one-third. [nL4N1MV3IM]"
General Electric,2017-10,Several analysts shortly thereafter cut their ratings or share price targets for GE.
General Electric,2017-10,"Other defendants include Chief Executive John Flannery, his predecessor Jeffrey Immelt, and former Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey Bornstein, who left that position this week."
General Electric,2017-10,"""The complaint appears to focus on projections conveyed during earnings calls, which by definition, were forward-looking statements,"" GE spokeswoman Jennifer Friedman said in an email. ""We intend to vigorously defend against these claims."""
General Electric,2017-10,"Shareholders have long been frustrated by GE, a maker of power plants, jet engines, medical devices and other industrial equipment and a member of the Dow Jones Industrial Average <.DJI>."
General Electric,2017-10,"Through Wednesday, GE's share price had fallen 51 percent in the 16 years since Jack Welch, who oversaw much of its growth, passed the CEO baton to Immelt. Investors who reinvested dividends suffered a roughly 19 percent negative total return."
General Electric,2017-10,"In contrast, the Standard & Poor's 500 <.SPX> rose about 133 percent over that time period."
General Electric,2017-10,"Though Immelt had shed some units, Flannery said GE must now focus on its more promising businesses, and hold managers accountable for poor performance."
General Electric,2017-10,"Flannery, a 30-year GE veteran who took over on Aug. 1, has made some early, symbolic cuts, including executive perks and the use of corporate jets."
General Electric,2017-10,"In his complaint, Hachem accused the defendants of having from July 21 to Oct. 20, made materially false and misleading statements about its business in public statements and filings, and knew that doing so would mislead investors."
General Electric,2017-10,Hachem is represented by the law firms Glancy Prongay & Murray and Kirby McInerney and is seeking unspecified damages.
General Electric,2017-10,Securities fraud class actions have become more plentiful in federal courts after recent rulings in Delaware state courts dissuaded some plaintiffs from suing there.
General Electric,2017-10,Cornerstone Research said 226 such class actions were filed from January to June - the most since it began tracking filings in 1996. Most involve smaller declines in market value and less familiar companies than GE.
General Electric,2017-10,"The case is Hachem v General Electric Inc et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 17-08457."

General Electric,2017-10,"FRANKFURT/MADRID, Nov 1 (Reuters) - Siemens Gamesa has fallen behind biggest rival Vestas in the race for orders in the United States, hurt by a perceived lack of technology investment and a less centralised supply chain in the world's second-biggest wind turbine market."
General Electric,2017-10,"The U.S. battleground is among the biggest for western turbine manufacturers, with the U.S. Energy Information Administration forecasting the addition of 6 gigawatts (GW) of capacity this year and a further 8 GW in 2018."
General Electric,2017-10,"But things have not gone well for Siemens Gamesa since the merger that brought together Siemens' wind power division with rival Gamesa this year, even though it has described the United States as critical to its success."
General Electric,2017-10,The merger was aimed at giving the combined entity an edge in an increasingly competitive global market amid sector consolidation that saw Germany's Nordex buy the turbine unit of Spain's Acciona and General Electric take over France's Alstom.
General Electric,2017-10,"""Siemens Gamesa has struggled to bring an attractive turbine to North America,"" said one senior industry adviser who declined to be named to protect business relations."
General Electric,2017-10,"There is a view that the company has not done enough to improve its geared turbines, the adviser added."
General Electric,2017-10,"Siemens has mainly sold gearbox-based turbines in the United States, where they are the preferred model, but its market share has dwindled in recent years while that of Vestas has increased steadily."
General Electric,2017-10,"Complementing its portfolio and recouping lost market share in the United States were among the main drivers of the tie-up with Gamesa, which has a broader offering of gearbox-based turbines and is expected to fare better locally."

General Electric,2017-10,"But that is still less than half of what has been taken in by Vestas. The Danish company's order book is brimming with 2,086 MW in announced U.S. deals, close to a third of its total orders globally."
General Electric,2017-10,Fresh data from the American Wind Energy Association (AWEA) also shows that Vestas is much more successful than Siemens Gamesa in striking deals for projects. The association's latest quarterly market report said Vestas has taken 47 percent of the U.S. wind projects under construction or in advanced development that have announced a supplier.

General Electric,2017-10,"In the medium term, the merger is expected to help Siemens Gamesa to gain a stronger foothold in the United States and recover some of this year's 30 percent lost market value -- a far cry from the 25 percent gain for shares in Vestas."
General Electric,2017-10,"Regardless of the actual products, Siemens Gamesa must also find a way to compete with the centralised supply chain that Vestas has built in the United States."

The U.S. business delegation's composition reflects Trump's desires to find low-hanging fruit deals to tout domestically, but low expectations for deeper concessions."
General Electric,2017-10,"U.S. corporate delegates include GE, Honeywell , Thermo Fisher and Cheniere Energy . They arrive at an opportune time to meet Chinese leaders, who just wrapped up a major party congress and rolled out new leadership slate at the end of October."
General Electric,2017-10,"However, the United States remains locked in contentious talks over improving market access for American firms in the People's Republic, including financial services. A senior administration official said Tuesday that progress has become more difficult. China is retrenching under President Xi Jinping, who has shown scant respect for market-based principles."
General Electric,2017-10,"While there have been some advances on raising ownership equity caps in financial services, a deal has not been finalized, and the lack of representation by big names like Citi or Goldman Sachs on this trip suggests no major compromise is nigh. William Zarit, chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, said he hoped the one-off deals don't overshadow the need to push for structural changes."
General Electric,2017-10,"Convincing Beijing to expose its domestic financial industry to more foreign competition is a tougher pitch than selling goods. The Trump administration is not indifferent to the financial sector's concerns, but low expectations for photo-op concessions have kept the industry at the back of the line this time around."
General Electric,2017-10,"- U.S. President Donald Trump will begin his 12-day Asia trip on Nov. 3, with scheduled stops in Japan, South Korea, China, Vietnam, and the Philippines. North Korea and economic relations are expected to be the main topics of discussion during the visit."
General Electric,2017-10,"- Among the companies listed as participating in the delegation to China are General Electric, Honeywell, Thermo Fisher and Cherniere Energy. The Trump administration also hopes to announce a 700-mile pipeline deal with China Petroleum & Chemical Corp., known as Sinopec, in Texas and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The firm is expected to partner with Massachusetts-based ArcLight Capital and Connecticut-based Freepoint Commodities."

General Electric,2017-10,"BEIJING, Oct 27 (Reuters) - U.S. energy and commodities firms will make up a major part of a business delegation visiting Beijing at the same time as U.S. President Donald Trump goes to China in November, according to an initial list seen by Reuters."
General Electric,2017-10,"Prominent technology and financial companies are mostly absent from the list, reflecting the slow progress Washington has made in opening up China in those sectors."
General Electric,2017-10,"Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, who will lead the 29 companies that have been approved to travel on the trade mission starting on Nov. 8, said they will be looking for ""immediate results"" and ""tangible agreements""."
General Electric,2017-10,"But, speaking at the Paley International Council Summit in New York on Wednesday, he acknowledged that market access, intellectual property rights, and tariffs are more complex and will take a longer time to negotiate. [nL2N1N01DW]"
General Electric,2017-10,"Some major industrial companies - General Electric Co , Honeywell International Inc and Boeing Co - are among the companies on the current list."
General Electric,2017-10,"Whether executives from all the named companies end up attending could be subject to agreements or deals being negotiated in time for the visit, according to multiple sources whose companies are involved."
General Electric,2017-10,"One of the few tech companies going with Trump is Qualcomm , which earns about half of its global revenue in China and faces a series of tricky legal issues there, including a lawsuit with Apple and the Chinese government's review of its pending $38 billion merger with NXP Semiconductors . Qualcomm said its CEO, Steve Mollenkopf, planned to attend."
General Electric,2017-10,"An industry source told Reuters tech firms were reluctant to go, given China market access issues, the unpredictability of the Trump administration, and a ""Section 301"" U.S. trade investigation alleging Chinese abuses of intellectual property."
General Electric,2017-10,"""(These) issues are extremely sensitive for tech companies said another source in the U.S. business community."
General Electric,2017-10,"""Very few want to stick their heads up and be perceived as complaining directly, and even fewer trust this White House to do anything helpful on their issues,"" he said."
General Electric,2017-10,"Particularly galling to foreign tech firms are a slate of new national security and cyber security regulations, which mandate companies store crucial data within China and pass security reviews they argue could put business secrets at risk. [nL4N1MR3IY]"
General Electric,2017-10,"Trump, a real estate magnate who had never before held public office, has had a sometimes testy relationship with corporate America since taking office in January."
General Electric,2017-10,He disbanded two high-profile business advisory councils in August after several chief executives quit in protest over his controversial remarks on racist violence in Charlottesville.
General Electric,2017-10,U.S. industry sources say it has been years since a major business delegation has gone to China during a U.S. presidential visit.
General Electric,2017-10,"Calls for such a delegation during Trump's visit originated in the China-based U.S. business community, according to several sources, who saw a need to match growing efforts by Germany, France and Britain to promote their nation's firms in China."
General Electric,2017-10,"Trump, who has frequently cited the substantial U.S. trade deficit with China as a reason why Washington should take more protectionist measures, was an easy sell on incorporating a group of executives into the visit, according to the sources."
General Electric,2017-10,"Nonetheless, some trade analysts say China has done a good job of taming Trump's combative trade impulses. They worry the U.S. administration will be willing to paper over market access concerns during the visit in its focus on getting Beijing to take action against North Korea over its nuclear and missile programmes."
General Electric,2017-10,"Beijing agreed in May to grant limited U.S. access in financial services in bilateral talks aimed at reducing China's trade surplus with the United States which reached $347 billion last year, but business groups complained it was too little, too late. [nL1N1IE179]"
General Electric,2017-10,"William Zarit, the chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, told Reuters he didn't expect Trump to push hard on market access issues on this trip."
General Electric,2017-10,"""Unfortunately, I think the Chinese aren't going to start to respond until they feel some pain,"" Zarit said. ""We're all wondering what that is going to mean."""
General Electric,2017-10,"Scott Kennedy, at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank in Washington, said Beijing has deflected commercial issues ""using a combination of leadership flattery, coaxing up to his (Trump's) family, token concessions, adjusting their level of help on North Korea sanctions, and threats of retaliation should the U.S. take any unilateral action""."
General Electric,2017-10,"Agribusiness and energy firms dominate the delegation list. They include Archer Daniels Midland Co (ADM) , one of the world's largest grain companies, and chemicals and agribusiness giant DowDuPont ."
General Electric,2017-10,"Ten of the companies are involved in gas or other energy fields, including Cheniere Energy Inc , which operates the only U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) export terminal, three that are building new projects, and Freepoint Commodities, founded and run by David Messer, who led power utility Sempra's vaunted commodities division.[L2N1N109T]"
General Electric,2017-10,Their presence underscores the U.S. ambition to sell more of its excess gas abroad as its shale revolution contributes to a global LNG glut.
General Electric,2017-10,"Others on the list who confirmed plans to attend include GE, Houston-based LNG company Delfin Midstream, SolarReserve, Stine Seed Company, biotech firm Drylet, wastewater-processing firm Viroment and the U.S. Soybean Export Council."
General Electric,2017-10,"Bell Helicopter and crane-maker Terex Corp are also on the delegation list. Honeywell, DowDuPont and ADM did not respond immediately to a request for comment and Freepoint, Cheniere, Sempra Energy , and Texas LNG Brownsville LLC said they had no comment."
General Electric,2017-10,Boeing told Reuters it does not yet have plans to send anyone but that may change. Alaska Gasline Development Corp said it had no information to release.
General Electric,2017-10,"The U.S. Commerce Department, which is leading the delegation, has not yet issued its own list."
General Electric,2017-10,"At least one of the companies on the list tried to distance itself from Trump. SolarReserve told Reuters in a statement that it had been selected to participate in the commerce department's delegation but stressed that ""we are not part of the business delegation travelling to China with President Trump."""
General Electric,2017-10,"One U.S. official told Reuters on condition of anonymity that Trump will tout deals announced during the trip, but they would have likely happened regardless."
General Electric,2017-10,"The risk is that commercial deals ""distract from long-term political solutions"" to trade issues, the official said."
General Electric,2017-10,"Evan Medeiros, former President Barack Obama's top Asia adviser, made a similar point in Washington. Beijing would avoid seriously addressing the ""underlying systemic problems"" such as market access for high-tech goods and intellectual property protection during the visit, he predicted."

General Electric,2017-10,"{{20171029T180737.074+0000}}GE Board did not know about CEO's extra plane -WSJOct 29 (Reuters) - General Electric Co executives did not tell the multinational conglomerate's board until October about a spare business jet that routinely flew for its now-retired chief executive, the Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday, citing people familiar with the matter."
General Electric,2017-10,"Executives also did not tell directors that the maker of aircraft engines, locomotives, power plants and other industrial equipment had received an internal complaint about the jet several years ago, the publication said, also citing people familiar with the matter."
General Electric,2017-10,"The Wall Street Journal reported on Oct. 18 that former Chairman and CEO Jeff Immelt had an extra aircraft follow his corporate jet on some overseas trips during much of his 16 years in the role. GE executives first informed the board about the practice after the report, the publication said."
General Electric,2017-10,"GE told its directors the company had scaled back the practice in mid-2014 and would continue to use the backup plane only in limited situations, such as going to risky locations, the Journal reported."
General Electric,2017-10,Immelt told the Journal on Thursday that he did not know the spare plane was flying.
General Electric,2017-10,"Immelt, 61, stepped down as CEO on Aug. 1 and planned to continue as chairman through Dec. 31. But John Flannery was named chairman on Oct. 2. [nL2N1MD24Z]"

General Electric,2017-10,"BEIJING, Oct 27 (Reuters) - U.S. energy and commodities firms will make up a major part of a business delegation visiting Beijing at the same time as U.S. President Donald Trump goes to China in November, according to an initial list seen by Reuters."
General Electric,2017-10,"Prominent technology and financial companies are mostly absent from the list, reflecting the slow progress Washington has made in opening up China in those sectors."
General Electric,2017-10,"Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, who will lead the 29 companies that have been approved to travel on the trade mission starting on Nov. 8, said they will be looking for ""immediate results"" and ""tangible agreements""."
General Electric,2017-10,"But, speaking at the Paley International Council Summit in New York on Wednesday, he acknowledged that market access, intellectual property rights, and tariffs are more complex and will take a longer time to negotiate. [nL2N1N01DW]"
General Electric,2017-10,"Some major industrial companies - General Electric Co , Honeywell International Inc and Boeing Co - are among the companies on the current list."
General Electric,2017-10,"Whether executives from all the named companies end up attending could be subject to agreements or deals being negotiated in time for the visit, according to multiple sources whose companies are involved."
General Electric,2017-10,"One of the few tech companies going with Trump is Qualcomm , which earns about half of its global revenue in China and faces a series of tricky legal issues there, including a lawsuit with Apple and the Chinese government's review of its pending $38 billion merger with NXP Semiconductors . Qualcomm said its CEO, Steve Mollenkopf, planned to attend."
General Electric,2017-10,"An industry source told Reuters tech firms were reluctant to go, given China market access issues, the unpredictability of the Trump administration, and a ""Section 301"" U.S. trade investigation alleging Chinese abuses of intellectual property."
General Electric,2017-10,"""(These) issues are extremely sensitive for tech companies said another source in the U.S. business community."
General Electric,2017-10,"""Very few want to stick their heads up and be perceived as complaining directly, and even fewer trust this White House to do anything helpful on their issues,"" he said."
General Electric,2017-10,"Particularly galling to foreign tech firms are a slate of new national security and cyber security regulations, which mandate companies store crucial data within China and pass security reviews they argue could put business secrets at risk. [nL4N1MR3IY]"
General Electric,2017-10,"Trump, a real estate magnate who had never before held public office, has had a sometimes testy relationship with corporate America since taking office in January."
General Electric,2017-10,He disbanded two high-profile business advisory councils in August after several chief executives quit in protest over his controversial remarks on racist violence in Charlottesville.
General Electric,2017-10,U.S. industry sources say it has been years since a major business delegation has gone to China during a U.S. presidential visit.
General Electric,2017-10,"Calls for such a delegation during Trump's visit originated in the China-based U.S. business community, according to several sources, who saw a need to match growing efforts by Germany, France and Britain to promote their nation's firms in China."
General Electric,2017-10,"Trump, who has frequently cited the substantial U.S. trade deficit with China as a reason why Washington should take more protectionist measures, was an easy sell on incorporating a group of executives into the visit, according to the sources."
General Electric,2017-10,"Nonetheless, some trade analysts say China has done a good job of taming Trump's combative trade impulses. They worry the U.S. administration will be willing to paper over market access concerns during the visit in its focus on getting Beijing to take action against North Korea over its nuclear and missile programmes."
General Electric,2017-10,"Beijing agreed in May to grant limited U.S. access in financial services in bilateral talks aimed at reducing China's trade surplus with the United States which reached $347 billion last year, but business groups complained it was too little, too late. [nL1N1IE179]"
General Electric,2017-10,"William Zarit, the chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, told Reuters he didn't expect Trump to push hard on market access issues on this trip."
General Electric,2017-10,"""Unfortunately, I think the Chinese aren't going to start to respond until they feel some pain,"" Zarit said. ""We're all wondering what that is going to mean."""
General Electric,2017-10,"Scott Kennedy, at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank in Washington, said Beijing has deflected commercial issues ""using a combination of leadership flattery, coaxing up to his (Trump's) family, token concessions, adjusting their level of help on North Korea sanctions, and threats of retaliation should the U.S. take any unilateral action""."
General Electric,2017-10,"Agribusiness and energy firms dominate the delegation list. They include Archer Daniels Midland Co (ADM) , one of the world's largest grain companies, and chemicals and agribusiness giant DowDuPont ."
General Electric,2017-10,"Ten of the companies are involved in gas or other energy fields, including Cheniere Energy Inc , which operates the only U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) export terminal, three that are building new projects, and Freepoint Commodities, founded and run by David Messer, who led power utility Sempra's vaunted commodities division.[L2N1N109T]"
General Electric,2017-10,Their presence underscores the U.S. ambition to sell more of its excess gas abroad as its shale revolution contributes to a global LNG glut.
General Electric,2017-10,"Others on the list who confirmed plans to attend include GE, Houston-based LNG company Delfin Midstream, SolarReserve, Stine Seed Company, biotech firm Drylet, wastewater-processing firm Viroment and the U.S. Soybean Export Council."
General Electric,2017-10,"Bell Helicopter and crane-maker Terex Corp are also on the delegation list. Honeywell, DowDuPont and ADM did not respond immediately to a request for comment and Freepoint, Cheniere, Sempra Energy , and Texas LNG Brownsville LLC said they had no comment."
General Electric,2017-10,Boeing told Reuters it does not yet have plans to send anyone but that may change. Alaska Gasline Development Corp said it had no information to release.
General Electric,2017-10,"The U.S. Commerce Department, which is leading the delegation, has not yet issued its own list."
General Electric,2017-10,"At least one of the companies on the list tried to distance itself from Trump. SolarReserve told Reuters in a statement that it had been selected to participate in the commerce department's delegation but stressed that ""we are not part of the business delegation travelling to China with President Trump."""
General Electric,2017-10,"One U.S. official told Reuters on condition of anonymity that Trump will tout deals announced during the trip, but they would have likely happened regardless."
General Electric,2017-10,"The risk is that commercial deals ""distract from long-term political solutions"" to trade issues, the official said."
General Electric,2017-10,"Evan Medeiros, former President Barack Obama's top Asia adviser, made a similar point in Washington. Beijing would avoid seriously addressing the ""underlying systemic problems"" such as market access for high-tech goods and intellectual property protection during the visit, he predicted."
General Electric,2017-10,UPDATE 1-France's Safran revises up revenue target as Q3 growth quickens - Reuters News
General Electric,2017-10,"PARIS, Oct 27 (Reuters) - French aerospace company Safran on Friday raised its revenue forecast for 2017, after growth in its civil engines business and higher engine deliveries for the Rafale combat jet produced stronger than expected third-quarter sales."
General Electric,2017-10,"The maker of aircraft engines, landing gear and military optronics said adjusted revenue grew 8.5 percent to 3.82 billion euros ($4.4 billion) in the quarter. Sales rose 11.3 percent on an underlying basis."
General Electric,2017-10,"The widely-watched civil aftermarket grew 10.4 percent in dollar terms in the first nine months, including 14.5 percent year-on-year growth in the third quarter."
General Electric,2017-10,"Safran's shares rose 1.7 percent, outpacing the French CAC40 <.FCHI> index which rose 0.9 percent."
General Electric,2017-10,"The French company raised its forecast for adjusted revenue growth in 2017 to 3 percent from 2-3 percent, and confirmed other targets, including operating income close to 2016 levels."
General Electric,2017-10,"But it said its 2017 operating earnings could be held back by 350-400 million euros in costs from a switch to the new LEAP jetliner engine, up slightly from 300-350 million euros."
General Electric,2017-10,"This includes provision for the cost of dealing with the premature loss of a special coating on part of some of the engines, Chief Executive Philippe Petitcolin said."
General Electric,2017-10,"Ensuring a smooth ramp-up in the new production of the new engine, co-developed with General Electric for the most popular Airbus and Boeing jets, is Safran's biggest priority."
General Electric,2017-10,"Safran said it was meeting targets for the LEAP engine, produced by the Safran-GE joint-venture CFM International, but softened language used to describe its goal."
General Electric,2017-10,"In April, it predicted around 500 LEAP deliveries in 2017. Safran and GE talked in the summer of 450-500 deliveries and in its latest release, Safran said it was on course for ""over 450""."
General Electric,2017-10,"""We are still in line and I don't see as of today why we could not do that, so yes we are going to deliver more than 450 engines in 2017,"" Petitcolin said."
General Electric,2017-10,GE said last week CFM had delivered 111 LEAP engines in the third quarter including 23 retrofitted for Boeing following a turbine disk problem in May. Safran said in July it had found a quality issue with some engines for Airbus.
General Electric,2017-10,"Safran also said it was working on a new timetable for the Silvercrest business jet engine, whose certification has been delayed after a development glitch."
General Electric,2017-10,"Petitcolin told reporters he expected the delay to last a matter of months but could not yet give a new date for engine certification, previously planned for 2018."
General Electric,2017-10,"""There are several options and scenarios and we working to minimise the impact,"" he said."
General Electric,2017-10,"Dassault Aviation said this month that its Falcon 5X jet, which had already been delayed to 2020, would be postponed again after Safran identified problems with the high-pressure compressor."

General Electric,2017-10,Dassault Aviation said this month that its Falcon 5X jet would be postponed after Safran identified problems with the engine's high-pressure compressor during flight testing.
General Electric,2017-10,"Petitcolin told reporters Safran was in discussions with Dassault to agree a new schedule. The engine had been due for certification in 2018, but he declined to estimate a new date."
General Electric,2017-10,"Speaking after posting better-than-expected third quarter sales, Petitcolin said a previous round of technical problems, identified when the Silvercrest engine programme was reset two years ago, had all been resolved."
General Electric,2017-10,"He said Safran's key priority remained the ramp-up of production for the LEAP engine, co-developed with General Electric for Airbus and Boeing narrowbody aircraft through their CFM International venture."
General Electric,2017-10,Safran said earlier that its 2017 operating earnings faced headwinds of 350-400 million euros from the transition to the new engine. Petitcolin said the previous working estimate had been 300-350 million euros.
General Electric,2017-10,"He also said talks continued with Airbus about the future of production of 'nacelles', or engine housings, for the A320neo."
General Electric,2017-10,"Airbus has said it is bringing in-house work on nacelles made by United Technologies for jets powered by Pratt & Whitney engines, and that it is considering doing the same for nacelles made by Safran for CFM-powered A320neo aircraft."
General Electric,2017-10,Petitcolin reaffirmed plans to launch a formal offer for Zodiac Aerospace by end-year and to close an agreed deal to buy the seats maker in 2018.

General Electric,2017-10,"Oct 26 (Reuters) - General Electric Co is exploring divesting its transportation and healthcare information technology businesses, as it seeks to reshape its portfolio under new Chief Executive John Flannery, people familiar with the matter said."
General Electric,2017-10,"Such a move would help GE to meet more than half of its stated goal of shedding more than $20 billion worth of assets, the sources said this week. There is no certainty that GE will proceed with these divestitures, the sources added."
General Electric,2017-10,The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. GE declined to comment.
General Electric,2017-10,The move would make GE the latest U.S. industrial conglomerate to go ahead with asset divestitures after Honeywell International Inc announced earlier this month it would part with some of its businesses by creating two new publicly listed companies. [nL2N1ML0CV]
General Electric,2017-10,"Ed Garden, a founding partner at activist investor Trian Fund Management who was recently given a board seat at GE, has also acted as a catalyst for change."
General Electric,2017-10,"GE is looking to bounce back after what Flannery earlier this month called horrible results in the third quarter. He has argued that GE's strong businesses are being held back by others that ""drain investment and management resources without the prospect for a substantial reward."""

General Electric,2017-10,"GE's healthcare information technology business, which would likely have to be broken up into separate chunks in the event of a sale, assists with electronic medical records, healthcare workforce management, and hospital revenue cycle management. Some of its better known brands include API Healthcare, which it acquired in 2014, and Centricity EMR."
General Electric,2017-10,"The business is part of GE's sprawling healthcare business, which had revenue last year of $18.3 billion and spans magnetic imaging, medical diagnostics and drug discovery."
General Electric,2017-10,"GE has taken several actions to prune its portfolio over the years, shedding plastics, NBCUniversal and most of its GE Capital business. It also combined its oilfield services business with Baker Hughes ."

General Electric,2017-10,"COPENHAGEN, Oct 26 (Reuters) - The United States signed a deal with Denmark on Thursday to expand cooperation on offshore wind power, giving a boost Europe's biggest green energy players."
General Electric,2017-10,"Danish companies DONG Energy and Vestas had feared the nascent U.S. offshore wind sector would be stymied after President Trump vowed to revive the coal industry, challenged climate-change science and blasted renewable energy as expensive and dependent on government subsidies. [nL8N1ME01D]"
General Electric,2017-10,But both companies now say the Trump administration is increasingly looking at Europe's experience as it seeks to kick-start the sector.
General Electric,2017-10,"""We see some positive initiatives coming out of the administration in Washington,"" the head of DONG's U.S. business, Thomas Brostroem, told Reuters. He pointed to measures being taken on a federal level to streamline and speed up the process to obtain permits to build offshore wind farms."
General Electric,2017-10,"""They've been really receptive to talk to European countries and developers to get know-how from the past decades,"" he said."
General Electric,2017-10,"The U.S. offshore wind sector, which has lagged behind Europe, is at a critical juncture, with the first large-scale offshore wind auction in Massachusetts coming up in December."
General Electric,2017-10,"But to gain traction, industry executives and experts say the United States will need to replicate the dramatic cost cuts which Europe has implemented."
General Electric,2017-10,"""Something that is important for the new administration is jobs, jobs, jobs and that is something that will come from the supply chain around the turbines,"" Adam Thomsen, head of U.S. growth implementation at MHI Vestas, told Reuters, but declined to quantify any numbers."

General Electric,2017-10,"""We need a much more stable market development before we can talk factories."""
General Electric,2017-10,"Record low subsidy prices in Europe, home to more than 12 gigawatts (GW) of offshore wind, has increased confidence in the sector but also prompted European developers to search for new revenue streams in the United States and China."

General Electric,2017-10,"SAN FRANCISCO, Oct 25 (Reuters) - General Electric Co will use more alliances to build its digital-industrial business in coming years, Chief Executive Officer John Flannery said on Wednesday, suggesting the industrial conglomerate will curb spending in that area."
General Electric,2017-10,"GE is investing about $2.1 billion in GE Digital this year, and executives had said that amount would fall in 2018."
General Electric,2017-10,"Flannery on Wednesday made his first direct remarks about the digital strategy since he became CEO on Aug. 1. He has begun slashing costs in other areas, including reducing staff, grounding corporate jets and axing the ""Maserati benefit"" of corporate cars for about 600 senior executives."
General Electric,2017-10,"Flannery is due to unveil new financial targets on Nov. 13 and is under heavy pressure to turn GE around after the company's third-quarter earnings and cash flow badly missed targets. GE stock is down 32 percent so far this year, while the S&P 500 index is up 14 percent,"
General Electric,2017-10,"GE's digital strategy is built around a cloud-based software platform, known as Predix, that connects factories, power plants and other industrial equipment to computers that improve performance and predict outages."
General Electric,2017-10,But Predix's limited capabilities and performance problems have caused GE to lose out to competitors such as Siemens AG and startups such as Uptake and C3IOT. [nL1N1KQ1UU]
General Electric,2017-10,"Flannery said on Wednesday that GE will focus on selling Predix in its own businesses: energy, oil-and-gas, aviation, healthcare, transportation and mining, as Reuters reported in August."
General Electric,2017-10,"In other markets, ""We're going to be more selective ... and do it largely through partners,"" Flannery said at GE's annual Minds + Machines conference."
General Electric,2017-10,"Gary Mintchell, chief executive of The Manufacturing Connection, an industrial-internet-focused research and consulting company, said GE's strategy of using partners reflects the company's realization that ""they can't build their own ecosystem."""
General Electric,2017-10,"GE said it was expanding its partnership with Microsoft Corp , to provide access to Microsoft applications on Predix. The specifics largely duplicated what the companies said when they first announced the deal in July 2016. [nL2N1N0124]"
General Electric,2017-10,"GE said Predix will be available on Azure in North America on Nov. 30, months later than the original target of the second quarter. Predix will still be available on Amazon.com Inc's Amazon Web Services cloud platform, GE said."
General Electric,2017-10,"GE Digital's chief executive, Bill Ruh, on Wednesday noted a partnership with Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co . GE also is linking Predix with Apple Inc's IOS operating system for iPhones and iPads."
General Electric,2017-10,"Patrick Franklin, vice president in charge of Predix, said there was still room to improve Predix after the company held a two-month time-out this year to fix bugs, but the platform was showing near-100 percent stability."
General Electric,2017-10,"""We are paying careful attention to quality,"" he said, referring to the delay in deploying Predix on Azure."
General Electric,2017-10,"GE executives said the company is focusing on developing apps for Predix to boost sales. GE plans to bundle applications for equipment monitoring and service technicians, both of which it bought last year."

General Electric,2017-10,{{20171025T233122.178+0000}}UPDATE 2-Argentina's YPF to invest $21.5 bln from 2018 to 2022(Adds comments from interview with executives starting in paragraph 4)
General Electric,2017-10,"BUENOS AIRES/NEW YORK, Oct 25 (Reuters) - Argentina's state-controlled energy company YPF plans to invest $21.5 billion in the country from 2018 to 2022 and increase oil production by 26 percent as it considers reshuffling its generation, distribution and refinery assets."
General Electric,2017-10,"Investment in Argentina's energy sector by companies in partnership with YPF is projected at $8.5 billion during the period, bringing total expected investment to $30 billion through 2022, the company said."
General Electric,2017-10,"By the end of that time Argentina's largest oil and gas producer expects to have drilled 1,600 new oil and natural gas wells, it said."
General Electric,2017-10,"YPF executives said in an interview in New York that part of the $8.5 billion will come in the form of a capital injection into the company's power generation business, which will be spun off as part of the process."
General Electric,2017-10,Press reports have previously said General Electric Co is the most likely partner for the business.
General Electric,2017-10,"The power sector transaction is just one of several the company may consider in coming years including a potential sale of its stake in gas distributor Metrogas , for which Citi has been mandated to consider ""strategic options,"" he said."
General Electric,2017-10,YPF will also be closely watching Brazilian state-owned cohort Petrobras' plan to spin off its fuel distribution arm in the coming months as well as its potential deals in refining and other areas.
General Electric,2017-10,"""We may look at a number of opportunities of reshuffling the portfolio across different business lines,"" YPF Chairman Miguel Gutierrez told Reuters."
General Electric,2017-10,"YPF is the main company exploring the shale formation of Vaca Muerta in Patagonia, which Argentina is counting on to help it become a net oil exporter after years of running an expensive energy deficit."
General Electric,2017-10,"The formation is expected to keep drawing interest from oil majors as well as private equity firms and may also see investments from several independent oil and gas companies, which explore for and produce crude, but do not refine it, Gutierrez said."
General Electric,2017-10,"""They are starting to knock on the door and understand the situation,"" he said."
General Electric,2017-10,"Attracting investment to develop Vaca Muerta is a priority for Argentina's business-friendly President Mauricio Macri, who took office in December 2015. Macri has implemented a number of free-market reforms, including the reduction of costly subsidies for home gas and electricity consumption."

General Electric,2017-10,"NEW YORK, Oct 20 (Reuters) - It has been a rough 16 years for General Electric Co and its shareholders."
General Electric,2017-10,"When recently retired Chief Executive Jeff Immelt took over at the helm of GE in September 2001, the conglomerate was the most valuable U.S. publicly traded company, giving it outsized influence on the stock market."
General Electric,2017-10,"In the years since, its annual net earnings have shrunk 35 percent and the stock has been effectively dead money: down more than 40 percent in price and posting a negative total return even after reinvesting its juicy dividends."
General Electric,2017-10,"Along the way, GE's sway on markets has withered. The stock now has about one quarter of the weight on both the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average <.DJI> and the large-cap benchmark S&P 500 <.SPX> that it had back on Immelt's first day."
General Electric,2017-10,"On Friday, GE reported its last quarterly profit of the Immelt era, well below Wall Street's expectations. Immelt's successor John Flannery derided the results as ""horrible"" and pledged ""sweeping change."" [nL4N1MV3IM]"
General Electric,2017-10,The following statistics highlight GE's stock troubles and its fading market influence.
General Electric,2017-10,"* GE's weight on the price-weighted Dow was 2.86 percent when Immelt took over, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices, when the stock was at $40, around the middle of the pack among the 30 members of the index. With the stock closing below $24 on Thursday, the lowest in the index by a margin of more than $10, it had a 0.7 percent weight. The shares closed at $23.83 on Friday."
General Electric,2017-10,"* At their current price, GE shares would have less than one-tenth of the impact on the Dow as Boeing Co , the highest-priced stock in the Dow at more than $260 a share."
General Electric,2017-10,"* GE is the lone remaining original component of the Dow, one of the 12 companies tracked by Charles Dow starting in 1896. But it has not been in the index continuously. GE was replaced and returned twice at the turn of the 20th century, but has been consistently a component since November 1907, nearly 110 years."
General Electric,2017-10,"* Since 1976, a component change in the Dow has occurred on average about every two-and-three-quarters years. The last shake-up, when Apple Inc replaced AT&T Inc , occurred in March 2015, just over two-and-a-half years ago. Apple's market cap was about 1/60th of GE's when Immelt took over, but is now four times larger and owns the mantle of the world's most valuable publicly traded company."
General Electric,2017-10,"* Could GE get the boot in the next change? Despite GE's troubles, Dave Nadig, CEO of ETF.com in Chicago, was skeptical that GE's recent struggles would push the stock out of the Dow. ""I don't think that they are going to get kicked out of the index because the performance is bad,"" Nadig said. ""You'd have to believe that the core of their business had really changed."""
General Electric,2017-10,"* It is not just in the Dow that GE's influence has shriveled. Once the heaviest component of the market-cap weighted S&P 500, GE now accounts for less than 1 percent of the S&P 500's market value. It accounted for about 4 percent when Immelt became CEO."
General Electric,2017-10,"* New CEO John Flannery took the reins in August from Immelt. Since the start of Immelt's tenure in 2001 to Friday, GE's shares have declined 41 percent, against gains of more than 130 percent for both the S&P 500 <.SPX> and the Dow."
General Electric,2017-10,"* GE pays a rich dividend, but even reinvesting those in the stock failed to pull investors out of the red in the Immelt era. Through Friday, the stock had delivered a total return of negative 0.4 percent since September 2001 against comparable gains of 222 percent for the S&P and 254 percent for the Dow."
General Electric,2017-10,"* Investors are speculating that the dividend could be cut. It would not be the first time. In February 2009 GE announced plans to reduce its dividend as its then-massive finance arm grappled with the financial crisis. It cut the annual payout 68 percent to 40 cents a share, but it has since recovered to 96 cents."
General Electric,2017-10,"* GE's dividend yield of about 4 percent is currently the second-biggest in the Dow, trailing Verizon Communications Inc's 4.8 percent yield."

General Electric,2017-10,"NEW YORK, Oct 20 (Reuters) - General Electric Co's new chief executive vowed on Friday to shed more than $20 billion worth of assets and hold executives accountable for failing to deliver profits after what he called ""horrible"" results in the third quarter."
General Electric,2017-10,"GE badly missed Wall Street expectations and slashed its full-year forecast, sending shares down as much as 6 percent early in the day. But the stock rebounded and closed up 1 percent at $23.83 after CEO John Flannery said he will focus the company on delivering profit and cash to shareholders."
General Electric,2017-10,"Investors are pushing for big change after more than a decade of frustration at poor returns from the 125-year-old maker of power plants, jet engines, medical devices and other industrial equipment."
General Electric,2017-10,"Since former CEO Jeff Immelt took the helm in September 2001, the stock is down more than 40 percent and has posted a negative return even after reinvesting its juicy dividends. [nL2N1MV0Z3]"
General Electric,2017-10,"Flannery, who took over as CEO on Aug. 1, said he would change GE's culture to hold managers more accountable, demand better performance from the businesses and reduce the complexity of GE's portfolio."
General Electric,2017-10,"GE's good businesses are being held back by others that ""drain investment and management resources without the prospect for a substantial reward,"" Flannery said on a conference call with analysts."
General Electric,2017-10,"""We will have a simpler, more focused portfolio"" in coming months, he said. ""We are driving sweeping change."""
General Electric,2017-10,"Flannery declined to say what is on the chopping block, details he is due to unveil on Nov. 13. Immelt also shook up GE's portfolio, shedding plastics, NBCUniversal and most of GE Capital. He made acquisitions to build its power and oil and gas businesses. He also poured money into 3-D printing and a digital-industrial unit. Flannery voiced support for both on Friday."
General Electric,2017-10,"Flannery also suggested GE would do what it could to sustain its dividend, but that it had to balance paying investors with investing to build its businesses."
General Electric,2017-10,"Analysts had clear ideas about what pieces GE could do without: ""GE will likely sell transportation, lighting and about anything else that isn't nailed down and very core,"" analyst Scott Davis at Melius Research wrote in a note on Friday."
General Electric,2017-10,"As proof of GE's new approach to performance, outgoing Chief Financial Officer Jeff Bornstein took the blame for the poor results during the conference call, his last as CFO."
General Electric,2017-10,"""Accountability has to start with me,"" he said. ""We are not living up to our own standards or those of investors, and the buck stops with me."""
General Electric,2017-10,"GE's poor third-quarter results showed the depth of problems confronting Flannery, and he voiced eagerness to shake up GE's highest levels. A board seat recently given to Ed Garden, a founding partner at activist investor Trian Fund Management, would spark ""robust dialogue,"" he said, and shedding some of the 18 directors was ""being examined."""
General Electric,2017-10,"GE reported adjusted profit of 29 cents a share, missing by a wide margin the 49 cents analysts had expected, according to a consensus of estimates from Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S."
General Electric,2017-10,"GE cut its profit forecast for the full year to $1.05 to $1.10 a share, from $1.60 to $1.70 previously, and said it would generate only about $7 billion in cash from operations, down from $12 billion to $14 billion it had forecast earlier. It left its dividend unchanged."
General Electric,2017-10,"Weak performance in GE's power and oil and gas businesses, goodwill impairment and higher-than-expected restructuring costs were the main causes of the profit decline."
General Electric,2017-10,"Profit at the GE power business, which makes power plants and related equipment, fell 51 percent in the quarter."
General Electric,2017-10,"Cash flow from operating activities was $1.74 billion in the quarter, down from $2.90 billion a year earlier."

General Electric,2017-10,"Along the way, GE's sway on markets has withered. The stock now has about one quarter of the weight on both the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average <.DJI> and the large-cap benchmark S&P 500 <.SPX> that it had back on Immelt's first day."
General Electric,2017-10,"On Friday, GE reported its last quarterly profit of the Immelt era, well below Wall Street's expectations. Immelt's successor John Flannery derided the results as ""horrible"" and pledged ""sweeping change."" [nL4N1MV3IM]"
General Electric,2017-10,The following statistics highlight GE's stock troubles and its fading market influence.
General Electric,2017-10,"* GE's weight on the price-weighted Dow was 2.86 percent when Immelt took over, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices, when the stock was at $40, around the middle of the pack among the 30 members of the index. With the stock closing below $24 on Thursday, the lowest in the index by a margin of more than $10, it had a 0.7 percent weight. The shares closed at $23.83 on Friday."
General Electric,2017-10,"* At their current price, GE shares would have less than one-tenth of the impact on the Dow as Boeing Co , the highest-priced stock in the Dow at more than $260 a share."
General Electric,2017-10,"* GE is the lone remaining original component of the Dow, one of the 12 companies tracked by Charles Dow starting in 1896. But it has not been in the index continuously. GE was replaced and returned twice at the turn of the 20th century, but has been consistently a component since November 1907, nearly 110 years."
General Electric,2017-10,"* Since 1976, a component change in the Dow has occurred on average about every two-and-three-quarters years. The last shake-up, when Apple Inc replaced AT&T Inc , occurred in March 2015, just over two-and-a-half years ago. Apple's market cap was about 1/60th of GE's when Immelt took over, but is now four times larger and owns the mantle of the world's most valuable publicly traded company."
General Electric,2017-10,"* Could GE get the boot in the next change? Despite GE's troubles, Dave Nadig, CEO of ETF.com in Chicago, was skeptical that GE's recent struggles would push the stock out of the Dow. ""I don't think that they are going to get kicked out of the index because the performance is bad,"" Nadig said. ""You'd have to believe that the core of their business had really changed."""
General Electric,2017-10,"* It is not just in the Dow that GE's influence has shriveled. Once the heaviest component of the market-cap weighted S&P 500, GE now accounts for less than 1 percent of the S&P 500's market value. It accounted for about 4 percent when Immelt became CEO."
General Electric,2017-10,"* New CEO John Flannery took the reins in August from Immelt. Since the start of Immelt's tenure in 2001 to Friday, GE's shares have declined 41 percent, against gains of more than 130 percent for both the S&P 500 <.SPX> and the Dow."
General Electric,2017-10,"* GE pays a rich dividend, but even reinvesting those in the stock failed to pull investors out of the red in the Immelt era. Through Friday, the stock had delivered a total return of negative 0.4 percent since September 2001 against comparable gains of 222 percent for the S&P and 254 percent for the Dow."
General Electric,2017-10,"* Investors are speculating that the dividend could be cut. It would not be the first time. In February 2009 GE announced plans to reduce its dividend as its then-massive finance arm grappled with the financial crisis. It cut the annual payout 68 percent to 40 cents a share, but it has since recovered to 96 cents."
General Electric,2017-10,"* GE's dividend yield of about 4 percent is currently the second-biggest in the Dow, trailing Verizon Communications Inc's 4.8 percent yield."

General Electric,2017-10,Oct 18 (Reuters) - Apple Inc and General Electric Co say they are working together to make it easier to write software that can track power plants and jet engines on Apple's iPhones and iPads.
General Electric,2017-10,"The companies have come up with a tool for app developers to connect Apple's iOS operating system more easily to Predix, the cloud-based software at the heart of GE's effort to turn itself into a ""digital industrial"" company."

General Electric,2017-10,"For example, Ichhpurani said, a power plant manager might be debating the best time to take a generator offline for scheduled maintenance.

General Electric,2017-10,"NEW YORK, Oct 13 (Reuters) - U.S. stock sectors that are particularly dependent on economic growth recently grabbed hold of the market's rally and are poised to keep the reins should further signs of global expansion emerge."
General Electric,2017-10,"Such sectors, including energy, industrials and financials, beat the S&P 500's 1.9 percent gain in September. Those sectors had previously lagged behind the benchmark S&P <.SPX>, which has climbed 14 percent this year while feasting on a steady diet of record highs. Instead, shares of technology and healthcare companies, whose profits are more impervious to economic down cycles, have led 2017's rally."
General Electric,2017-10,"The question for equity investors is now: Was September just a catch-up period for the lagging, cyclical sectors, or can an economic lift support a sustained run?"
General Electric,2017-10,"""If it's just a mean-reversion trade, then it's probably going to last another few weeks and then we're back to the old winners,"" said Walter Todd, chief investment officer at Greenwood Capital Associates in Greenwood, South Carolina. ""If it's something more fundamental, it should be longer lasting than that."""
General Electric,2017-10,"A test comes next week, as third-quarter corporate earnings season kicks into high gear. Reports from industrial conglomerates General Electric and Honeywell International , railroads CSX Corp and Kansas City Southern and steel company Nucor Corp stand to yield insight into the economy's health."
General Electric,2017-10,"September's stock action, which also included outsized gains for small-cap stocks, had echoes of the immediate aftermath of President Donald Trump's election in November 2016."
General Electric,2017-10,"The same areas showed strength on hopes that a Republican-led federal government would push through an agenda, including tax cuts and deregulation, that juices economic growth. Those trades faded as Trump struggled to rack up any significant legislative wins."
General Electric,2017-10,"Now, investors say, September's stock rally for those groups again stemmed at least in part from policy hopes, as Trump revved up his tax-reform push."
General Electric,2017-10,"""In many ways, we began to replicate the market performance following Trump's election,"" said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial in Newark, New Jersey."
General Electric,2017-10,But an improving economic picture in the United States and globally lends confidence for the cyclical sector rally.
General Electric,2017-10,"The Citi economic surprise index for the United States <.CESIUSD>, a measure of economic data that can come in weaker or stronger than forecast, is around a five-month high, with the barometer trending higher since hitting multi-year lows this summer."
General Electric,2017-10,"This week, the International Monetary Fund upgraded its global economic growth forecast for 2017 by 0.1 percentage point to 3.6 percent, and to 3.7 percent for 2018, from its April and July outlook, driven by a pickup in trade, investment, and consumer confidence. [nL2N1MK19Z]"
General Electric,2017-10,"The U.S. Commerce Department last month revised its estimate for second-quarter gross domestic product growth to 3.1 percent, up from 3 percent. [nL2N1M90MW]"
General Electric,2017-10,"""We've just had better data,"" said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at The Leuthold Group in Minneapolis, who also points to indicators such as firming industrial commodity and oil prices and a rise in the Baltic Exchange's main sea freight index <.BADI>."
General Electric,2017-10,"""Those things are all kind of reflecting a realism of economic momentum, not just a one-off, Trump pie-in-the-sky expectation about policy change,"" Paulsen said."
General Electric,2017-10,"Bets seemed to build on the cyclical sectors in the first week of October, which saw flows into the largest sector exchange-traded funds for financials , industrials and energy , and outflows for technology and healthcare , according to Lipper data."
General Electric,2017-10,"""There is some momentum developing in these underperforming sectors,"" said Anthony Saglimbene, global market strategist at Ameriprise in Troy, Michigan."

General Electric,2017-10,{{20171013T110001.743+0000}}Wall St Week Ahead-Cyclical sector rally banks on global economic expansionBy Lewis Krauskopf
General Electric,2017-10,"NEW YORK, Oct 13 (Reuters) - U.S. stock sectors that are particularly dependent on economic growth recently grabbed hold of the market's rally and are poised to keep the reins should further signs of global expansion emerge."
General Electric,2017-10,"Such sectors, including energy, industrials and financials, beat the S&P 500's 1.9 percent gain in September. Those sectors had previously lagged behind the benchmark S&P <.SPX>, which has climbed 14 percent this year while feasting on a steady diet of record highs. Instead, shares of technology and healthcare companies, whose profits are more impervious to economic down cycles, have led 2017's rally."
General Electric,2017-10,"The question for equity investors is now: Was September just a catch-up period for the lagging, cyclical sectors, or can an economic lift support a sustained run?"
General Electric,2017-10,"""If it's just a mean-reversion trade, then it's probably going to last another few weeks and then we're back to the old winners,"" said Walter Todd, chief investment officer at Greenwood Capital Associates in Greenwood, South Carolina. ""If it's something more fundamental, it should be longer lasting than that."""
General Electric,2017-10,"A test comes next week, as third-quarter corporate earnings season kicks into high gear. Reports from industrial conglomerates General Electric and Honeywell International , railroads CSX Corp and Kansas City Southern and steel company Nucor Corp stand to yield insight into the economy's health."
General Electric,2017-10,"September's stock action, which also included outsized gains for small-cap stocks, had echoes of the immediate aftermath of President Donald Trump's election in November 2016."
General Electric,2017-10,"The same areas showed strength on hopes that a Republican-led federal government would push through an agenda, including tax cuts and deregulation, that juices economic growth. Those trades faded as Trump struggled to rack up any significant legislative wins."
General Electric,2017-10,"Now, investors say, September's stock rally for those groups again stemmed at least in part from policy hopes, as Trump revved up his tax-reform push."
General Electric,2017-10,"""In many ways, we began to replicate the market performance following Trump's election,"" said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial in Newark, New Jersey."
General Electric,2017-10,But an improving economic picture in the United States and globally lends confidence for the cyclical sector rally.
General Electric,2017-10,"The Citi economic surprise index for the United States <.CESIUSD>, a measure of economic data that can come in weaker or stronger than forecast, is around a five-month high, with the barometer trending higher since hitting multi-year lows this summer."
General Electric,2017-10,"This week, the International Monetary Fund upgraded its global economic growth forecast for 2017 by 0.1 percentage point to 3.6 percent, and to 3.7 percent for 2018, from its April and July outlook, driven by a pickup in trade, investment, and consumer confidence.

General Electric,2017-10,"The U.S. Commerce Department last month revised its estimate for second-quarter gross domestic product growth to 3.1 percent, up from 3 percent. [nL2N1M90MW]"
General Electric,2017-10,"""We've just had better data,"" said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at The Leuthold Group in Minneapolis, who also points to indicators such as firming industrial commodity and oil prices and a rise in the Baltic Exchange's main sea freight index <.BADI>."
General Electric,2017-10,"""Those things are all kind of reflecting a realism of economic momentum, not just a one-off, Trump pie-in-the-sky expectation about policy change,"" Paulsen said."
General Electric,2017-10,"Bets seemed to build on the cyclical sectors in the first week of October, which saw flows into the largest sector exchange-traded funds for financials , industrials and energy , and outflows for technology and healthcare , according to Lipper data."
General Electric,2017-10,"""There is some momentum developing in these underperforming sectors,"" said Anthony Saglimbene, global market strategist at Ameriprise in Troy, Michigan."
General Electric,2017-10,"Earnings results could sway that momentum. Technology, which has gained 29 percent this year, topping all sectors, is expected to post a 12.2 percent increase in third-quarter profits, more than twice the expected rise for cyclical groups such as industrials and materials."

General Electric,2017-10,"SINGAPORE, Oct 13 (Reuters) - U.S. aviation authorities have ordered visual inspections of fan hubs in engines used on some Airbus SE A380 jets after an engine came apart on an Air France flight last month, forcing it to make an emergency landing."

General Electric,2017-10,"NEW YORK, Oct 11 (Reuters) - Concern among investors that General Electric Co may not generate enough cash this year to fully cover its dividend and other promised spending sent its stock to its lowest level in more than four years on Wednesday."
General Electric,2017-10,"The shares fell 1.2 percent to $23.07 after JPMorgan said a dividend cut was ""increasingly likely"" and lowered its price target on the stock to $20 from $22."
General Electric,2017-10,"""Despite the recent CEO change, by the numbers we see a core operating performance that is below (GE's) plan,"" JPMorgan analyst Stephen Tusa wrote in a note on Wednesday, referring to GE's full year forecast. Tusa was not available to comment beyond the note."
General Electric,2017-10,"Chief Executive John Flannery, who took over the position on August 1, is doing a comprehensive review of the company and is due to set new targets for earnings and capital allocation, which includes dividends, on Nov. 13."
General Electric,2017-10,"GE has affirmed its commitment to the dividend, which gives GE stock the second-highest dividend yield in the Dow Jones Industrial Average and ranks it 30th among the S&P 500."
General Electric,2017-10,"""Dividends remain a top priority,"" GE spokeswoman Jennifer Erickson said on Wednesday, declining to answer further questions as the company is in a quiet period ahead of its third-quarter results due next week. The dividend due to be paid Oct. 25 is not subject to being cut."
General Electric,2017-10,"GE's stock has fallen 5.4 percent since Friday, including falling 1.24 percent to $23.07 on Wednesday, its lowest close since Sept. 3, 2013. The stock is down 27 percent this year, the worst Dow performer."
General Electric,2017-10,"On Friday GE said that its long-time Chief Financial Officer Jeff Bornstein would retire and be replaced by Jamie Miller, who has been the head of its transportation unit. [nL4N1MH3QH]"
General Electric,2017-10,"A Reuters analysis of a GE presentation released in July and executives' comments showed that GE could generate $6 billion less cash this year than it planned to spend on dividends, share buybacks and other items. Its plan called for spending up to $25.8 billion, including about $8 billion on dividends, while generating about $20 billion in cash from operations and asset sales."
General Electric,2017-10,"GE has the capacity to pay the dividend. The company has more than $14 billion in cash on its balance sheet and $327 billion in orders for power plants, jet engines, locomotives, oil and gas equipment and healthcare devices."
General Electric,2017-10,"It could trim other spending instead, such as buying back fewer shares than the $11 billion to $13 billion it has targeted for this year."
General Electric,2017-10,"The 125-year-old company has cut its dividend six times in the last 34 years, including a 68 percent cut in 2009 during the financial crisis. It is operating against a far more favorable economic backdrop now."

General Electric,2017-10,"PARIS, Oct 10 (Reuters) - French investigators are preparing for an intricate operation to repatriate an Air France Airbus A380 passenger jet that was forced to make an emergency landing in Canada after one of its engines came apart in mid-flight, people familiar with the manoeuvre said."
General Electric,2017-10,"The Airbus superjumbo diverted to Goose Bay in Labrador on Sept. 30 after one of its four engines exploded over Greenland, sending the front part of the engine including its 3-metre-wide fan into the ice sheet 37,000 feet below."
General Electric,2017-10,"More than 500 passengers and crew, some of whom had reported a bang and vibration, were picked up on two replacement jets after waiting for hours onboard due to problems in accommodating the world's largest airliner at the remote military airport."
General Electric,2017-10,But the aircraft itself remained stranded while French-led investigators collected evidence and developed a plan for returning it to France.
General Electric,2017-10,"Making the roughly 2,300 nautical mile (4,260 km) trip will need a switch in engines to help the mammoth jet fly smoothly."
General Electric,2017-10,"First, the rump of the broken engine will be taken off the wing and flown to Wales, where manufacturer General Electric can examine it at its Cardiff repair workshop, the people said."
General Electric,2017-10,Then a spare engine will be mounted on the right wing in the same outer position as the damaged one. But this will only be used to balance the weight during flight and that engine will not be operable.
General Electric,2017-10,The people declined to be quoted as the plans have not yet been announced. France's BEA accident agency declined comment.
General Electric,2017-10,The operation to fetch the double-decker jet is not the only challenging errand triggered by the mid-air explosion.
General Electric,2017-10,Some parts of the engine were retrieved by helicopter in Greenland on Oct. 6 and dispatched to BEA headquarters in Paris. But investigators still face a tricky search in uncertain weather conditions to try to find other missing elements before they are buried by snow.
General Electric,2017-10,"Although nobody was injured, the engine break-up has led to what could be a lengthy investigation to ensure other aircraft are not exposed to the risk of damage from high-speed engine debris. Experts say such incidents are very rare, however."
General Electric,2017-10,"GP7200 engines used on Air France A380s are made by Engine Alliance, co-owned by GE and Pratt & Whitney ."
General Electric,2017-10,In 2010 a Qantas A380 engine built by UK rival Rolls-Royce blew up shortly after take-off. Investigators cited a poorly manufactured part.

General Electric,2017-10,{{20171009T155927.290+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-GE needs Nelson Peltz's help - and takes it(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.)
General Electric,2017-10,"NEW YORK, Oct 9 (Reuters Breakingviews) - General Electric's shareholders gained little during former boss Jeff Immelt's long tenure. John Flannery, his successor at the $200 billion U.S. industrial giant, still seems unable to get people excited about owning its shares. That might be why GE is putting a representative of Nelson Peltz-led Trian Fund management on its board. It's a contrast with Procter & Gamble , which is resisting Peltz's efforts to become a director."
General Electric,2017-10,"Immelt began talking to Peltz even before Trian bought a stake in 2015. Though a GE veteran, Flannery only moved into the corner office in August. Last week, he took over as chairman as well, and made his mark with a series of top management changes. Perhaps more so than Immelt, Flannery may benefit from the experience Ed Garden, the Peltz lieutenant and son-in-law who will join GE's directors, has gleaned over many years on a raft of boards."
General Electric,2017-10,"One challenge is to make GE's investment case more compelling. Immelt dismantled much of GE Capital, the company's Achilles heel during the financial crisis a decade ago, and kicked off other strategic changes. But the total shareholder return during his tenure ended up being just 6 percent. It's symptomatic of investors' attitude that the management and boardroom changes either side of the weekend sent the company's shares down 3 percent in Monday morning trade."
General Electric,2017-10,"- General Electric said on Oct. 9 it had elected Ed Garden, the founding partner and chief investment officer of activist investment firm Trian Fund Management, to its board of directors."
General Electric,2017-10,"- Garden will replace former Deere boss Robert Lane, who is retiring for health reasons, the U.S. industrial conglomerate said in a statement."
General Electric,2017-10,"- Nelson Peltz-led Trian, which has a stake of about 0.8 percent in GE, according to Thomson Reuters data, has been putting pressure on the company to improve its profit performance."
General Electric,2017-10,"- GE Chief Executive John Flannery, in the job since Aug. 1, became chairman on Oct. 2, replacing former chief Jeff Immelt ahead of schedule."
General Electric,2017-10,"- On Oct. 6, GE announced other changes, including the departure of Jeff Bornstein, finance chief and vice chair, to be replaced by Jamie Miller. Two other vice chairs, Beth Comstock and John Rice, will also be retiring from the company at the end of the year."

General Electric,2017-10,{{20171009T155927.290+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-GE needs Nelson Peltz's help - and takes it(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.)
General Electric,2017-10,"NEW YORK, Oct 9 (Reuters Breakingviews) - General Electric's shareholders gained little during former boss Jeff Immelt's long tenure. John Flannery, his successor at the $200 billion U.S. industrial giant, still seems unable to get people excited about owning its shares. That might be why GE is putting a representative of Nelson Peltz-led Trian Fund management on its board. It's a contrast with Procter & Gamble , which is resisting Peltz's efforts to become a director."
General Electric,2017-10,"Immelt began talking to Peltz even before Trian bought a stake in 2015. Though a GE veteran, Flannery only moved into the corner office in August. Last week, he took over as chairman as well, and made his mark with a series of top management changes. Perhaps more so than Immelt, Flannery may benefit from the experience Ed Garden, the Peltz lieutenant and son-in-law who will join GE's directors, has gleaned over many years on a raft of boards."
General Electric,2017-10,"One challenge is to make GE's investment case more compelling. Immelt dismantled much of GE Capital, the company's Achilles heel during the financial crisis a decade ago, and kicked off other strategic changes. But the total shareholder return during his tenure ended up being just 6 percent. It's symptomatic of investors' attitude that the management and boardroom changes either side of the weekend sent the company's shares down 3 percent in Monday morning trade."
General Electric,2017-10,"- General Electric said on Oct. 9 it had elected Ed Garden, the founding partner and chief investment officer of activist investment firm Trian Fund Management, to its board of directors."
General Electric,2017-10,"- Garden will replace former Deere boss Robert Lane, who is retiring for health reasons, the U.S. industrial conglomerate said in a statement."
General Electric,2017-10,"- Nelson Peltz-led Trian, which has a stake of about 0.8 percent in GE, according to Thomson Reuters data, has been putting pressure on the company to improve its profit performance."
General Electric,2017-10,"- GE Chief Executive John Flannery, in the job since Aug. 1, became chairman on Oct. 2, replacing former chief Jeff Immelt ahead of schedule."
General Electric,2017-10,"- On Oct. 6, GE announced other changes, including the departure of Jeff Bornstein, finance chief and vice chair, to be replaced by Jamie Miller. Two other vice chairs, Beth Comstock and John Rice, will also be retiring from the company at the end of the year."

General Electric,2017-10,"PARIS, Oct 4 (Reuters) - Airbus told European governments on Wednesday that it has made a strategic decision to bring the design of some nacelles or aircraft engine casings inside the company, rather than leaving it with suppliers, according to a presentation on its website."
General Electric,2017-10,"It also said the troubled A400M military plane project will continue to ""weigh significantly"" on cashflow in 2017 and 2018 in particular, according to the presentation prepared on Oct. 4 and presented on Wednesday to governments that own shares in the European planemaker: France, Germany and Spain."
General Electric,2017-10,An Airbus spokesman said the decision had already been taken to recoup nacelle work carried out by United Technologies for engines supplied by the same company to power the A320neo jet.
General Electric,2017-10,United Technologies engine subsidiary Pratt & Whitney was not immediately available for comment.
General Electric,2017-10,"The A320neo is offered with nacelles from United Technologies whenever it is mounted with engines made by Pratt & Whitney, or France's Safran for engines made by Safran's CFM joint venture with General Electric ."
General Electric,2017-10,"Airbus' decision to take control of some nacelles reflects a ""strategic decision for competitiveness,"" according to the presentation, part of a series of investor briefings."
General Electric,2017-10,Safran was not immediately available for comment. A person close to the company said talks are under way with Airbus but stressed no decision had been taken.
General Electric,2017-10,"""Bringing nacelle capability in-house allows Airbus to further improve nacelle aerodynamics to offer extra efficiency and better performance,"" the Airbus spokesman said."
General Electric,2017-10,The move comes amid growing concern among planemakers about the economic power of some major suppliers and an effort by planemakers to pull back more work to boost margins.
General Electric,2017-10,It comes weeks after United Technologies agreed to buy Rockwell Collins in a $23 billion deal. Airbus has urged United Tech not to let the merger draw its attention away from fixing industrial problems with the A320neo's Pratt & Whitney engines.
General Electric,2017-10,"Under the project, industry sources say Airbus will redesign a number of key parts including the Pratt & Whitney engine's thrust reverser. It will also be responsible for integrating the engine housing and the pylon which attaches it to the wing."
General Electric,2017-10,One of the main goals is to reduce recurring costs to allow the recently introduced A320neo to be made more cheaply.
General Electric,2017-10,"Until recently, the trend has been towards asking suppliers to take responsibility for piecing together large sub-systems."

General Electric,2017-10,"Canada was seen as keen to keep control of the case, but aviation experts said France had priority because that was where the plane was built, designed, registered and operated."

General Electric,2017-10,"PARIS, Oct 4 (Reuters) - Airbus told European governments on Wednesday that it has made a strategic decision to bring the design of some nacelles or aircraft engine casings inside the company, rather than leaving it with suppliers, according to a presentation on its website."
General Electric,2017-10,"It also said the troubled A400M military plane project will continue to ""weigh significantly"" on cashflow in 2017 and 2018 in particular, according to the presentation prepared on Oct. 4 and presented on Wednesday to governments that own shares in the European planemaker: France, Germany and Spain."
General Electric,2017-10,An Airbus spokesman said the decision had already been taken to recoup nacelle work carried out by United Technologies for engines supplied by the same company to power the A320neo jet.
General Electric,2017-10,United Technologies engine subsidiary Pratt & Whitney was not immediately available for comment.
General Electric,2017-10,"The A320neo is offered with nacelles from United Technologies whenever it is mounted with engines made by Pratt & Whitney, or France's Safran for engines made by Safran's CFM joint venture with General Electric ."
General Electric,2017-10,"Airbus' decision to take control of some nacelles reflects a ""strategic decision for competitiveness,"" according to the presentation, part of a series of investor briefings."
General Electric,2017-10,Safran was not immediately available for comment. A person close to the company said talks are under way with Airbus but stressed no decision had been taken.
General Electric,2017-10,"""Bringing nacelle capability in-house allows Airbus to further improve nacelle aerodynamics to offer extra efficiency and better performance,"" the Airbus spokesman said."
General Electric,2017-10,The move comes amid growing concern among planemakers about the economic power of some major suppliers and an effort by planemakers to pull back more work to boost margins.
General Electric,2017-10,It comes weeks after United Technologies agreed to buy Rockwell Collins in a $23 billion deal. Airbus has urged United Tech not to let the merger draw its attention away from fixing industrial problems with the A320neo's Pratt & Whitney engines.
General Electric,2017-10,"Under the project, industry sources say Airbus will redesign a number of key parts including the Pratt & Whitney engine's thrust reverser. It will also be responsible for integrating the engine housing and the pylon which attaches it to the wing."
General Electric,2017-10,One of the main goals is to reduce recurring costs to allow the recently introduced A320neo to be made more cheaply.
General Electric,2017-10,"Until recently, the trend has been towards asking suppliers to take responsibility for piecing together large sub-systems."

General Electric,2017-10,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi has championed a manufacturing drive, under the slogan 'Make in India', to boost the sluggish economy and create millions of jobs. Among the headline-grabbing details was a plan to eventually make Apple iPhones in India."
General Electric,2017-10,"Three years on, as executives and bureaucrats crowded into a Delhi convention centre for an inaugural mobile congress last week, India has managed only to assemble phones from imported components."
General Electric,2017-10,"While contract manufacturers such as iPhone-maker Foxconn Technology Co <2354.TW> and Flextronics Corp have set up base in India, one of the world's fastest-growing smartphone markets, almost none of the higher value chip sets, cameras and other high-end components are made domestically."
General Electric,2017-10,"Plans for Taiwan-based Foxconn to build an electronics plant in the state of Maharashtra, which local officials said in 2015 could employ some 50,000 people, have gone quiet."
General Electric,2017-10,"According to tech research firm Counterpoint, while phones are assembled domestically because of taxes on imported phones, locally made content in those phones is usually restricted to headphones and chargers - about 5 percent of a device's cost."
General Electric,2017-10,"""Rather than feeling that India is a place where I should be making mobile phones, it's more like this is the place I need to (assemble) phones because there is lower duty if I import components and assemble here,"" a senior executive with a Chinese smartphone maker said."
General Electric,2017-10,He declined to be named for fear of harming business.
General Electric,2017-10,Others listed the lack of skilled engineers and a sparse network of local component makers. They also cited high-profile tax disputes between India and foreign companies such as Nokia . Nokia eventually suspended mobile handset production at its southern India facility.
General Electric,2017-10,"""The Nokia escapade is in people's memory when they try to come here,"" a second industry source told Reuters at the first Indian Mobile Congress in capital New Delhi, which ended on Friday."
General Electric,2017-10,"India's nationwide sales tax (GST), which kicked in this year to replace a string of different levies, is also fraught with its own challenges, such as a lengthy tax-refund process that delays payments to suppliers, the source added."
General Electric,2017-10,"Last week, India rattled investors after publicly musing about possible changes in a $2.6 billion 2015 diesel locomotive contract with General Electric . The government has since said it would not take any hasty decisions. [nL4N1M92Q0]"
General Electric,2017-10,"""We needed some push from the government to start manufacturing,"" said Neeraj Sharma, the India head of Chinese chipmaker Spreadtrum. ""It was required, because without that nothing was happening."""
General Electric,2017-10,"But India now needs more sophisticated technology - such as surface-mounting technology, which places components directly on top of a printed board - to build a supply chain, he said."
General Electric,2017-10,"Otherwise, firms will not do research in India, Sharma said. ""For design to happen, we need strong local players."""
General Electric,2017-10,"The government says it has a phased programme to manufacture phones, aiming to step up value added locally every year."
General Electric,2017-10,"""While we have made a start with getting in mobile assembling, we want to move up the value chain,"" India's telecoms secretary Aruna Sundarajan told reporters. ""A lot of investors have shown very significant interest in this area."""
General Electric,2017-10,The Phased Manufacturing Programme began in 2016 with the manufacture of phone chargers and batteries and envisages the production of higher-end components by 2020.
General Electric,2017-10,"Sundarajan said the government was also trying to give investors ""a reasonable degree of certainty"", while also dealing with constant disruption to the industry."
General Electric,2017-10,"But for smartphone makers used to China's predictability, India may need to do more, executives warn."
General Electric,2017-10,"A third senior source at a Chinese smartphone maker in India said some Chinese players were rattled by labour unrest, including suspended operations at a facility belonging to smartphone maker Oppo earlier this year, after a foreign employee was reported to have torn a picture of the Indian flag."
General Electric,2017-10,"""Labour laws are lax, there's little effort to build a component ecosystem and logistics, and transport remains a big problem,"" the third source said."
General Electric,2017-10,"""No one seems to be investing in skilled labour that will build the phones"
General Electric,2017-10,UPDATE 1-Air France flight with engine damage makes emergency landing in Canada - Reuters News
General Electric,2017-10,"{{20170930T194021.392+0000}}UPDATE 1-Air France flight with engine damage makes emergency landing in CanadaSept 30 (Reuters) - An Air France flight from Paris to Los Angeles made an emergency landing in eastern Canada on Saturday after one of its four engines sustained ""serious damage"" over the Atlantic, the airline said."
General Electric,2017-10,"Air France Flight 66, originating at Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport, landed at Goose Bay in Labrador at 1542 GMT, the airline said, and no one was hurt in the incident."
General Electric,2017-10,"""The regularly trained pilots and cabin crew handled this serious incident perfectly,"" the airline said in a statement."
General Electric,2017-10,"The aircraft involved in the incident was an Airbus 380 that was about seven years old, according to airfleets.net, an aircraft database. The engine was made by Engine Alliance, a joint venture between General Electric Co and United Technologies Corp's Pratt & Whitney unit."
General Electric,2017-10,The forced landing in Canada's easternmost province is reminiscent of an incident seven years ago in which one of the Rolls Royce engines on a Qantas A380 suffered mid-engine damage after taking off in Singapore. The November 2010 incident prompted the grounding of the entire Qantas A380 fleet -- six A380s at the time -- for over three weeks.
General Electric,2017-10,Officials with the Transportation Safety Board of Canada could not immediately be reached for comment on Saturday. The airline said it was making arrangements to send the plane's passengers to their destination of Los Angeles.
General Electric,2017-10,Aircraft on trans-Atlantic flights commonly use Goose Bay Airport in the province of Newfoundland and Labrador for emergency fueling stops.
