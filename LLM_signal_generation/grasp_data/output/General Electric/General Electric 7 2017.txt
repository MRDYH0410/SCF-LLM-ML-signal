General Electric,2017-7,Sponsors may be tempted by Olympics return to Los Angeles - Reuters News
General Electric,2017-7,{{20170801T212828.220+0000}}Sponsors may be tempted by Olympics return to Los AngelesBy Liana B. Baker
General Electric,2017-7,"SAN FRANCISCO, Aug 1(Reuters) - Even if it is more than a decade away, a Summer Games in Los Angeles in 2028 may be a boost to the International Olympic Committee's (IOC) efforts to extend its lucrative contracts with top sponsors such as Visa Inc and Coca-Cola Co, Olympic sponsorship experts said."
General Electric,2017-7,"Los Angeles agreed to host the 2028 Summer Games, after bowing out of a two-way contest with Paris for the 2024 Summer Games. Awarding two Summer Games in tandem is rare for the IOC, and under normal circumstances, the 2028 host city would not be known until 2021. [nL8N1K24H9]"
General Electric,2017-7,"U.S.-based multinational companies Visa , Coca-Cola , Procter & Gamble , Dow Chemical Co and General Electric Co make up about half of the IOC's top sponsors program, which contributes more than $1 billion in each four-year cycle to the games."
General Electric,2017-7,All of these brands' agreements with the IOC expire in 2020 after the Summer Games in Tokyo.
General Electric,2017-7,"At least one U.S.-based sponsor, which spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity, said that it had been eager for the Games to return to the United States after so many years."
General Electric,2017-7,"""LA is a homegrown market, a U.S. market for these companies that gives a tremendous boost to the likelihood that they will continue to stay on as sponsors,"" said Rob Prazmark, chief executive of 21 Sports & Entertainment Marketing Group, who helped create the top sponsors program with the IOC."
General Electric,2017-7,"The 2028 U.S. Summer Games, the first Summer Games in the United States since 1996, could be a factor in the renewal discussions with sponsors that are currently underway, said John Grady, a sports law professor at the University of South Carolina."
General Electric,2017-7,"""Once you have an American city, it puts a flame under that U.S. brand. They have a reason to renew that otherwise didn't exist,"" Grady said."
General Electric,2017-7,"With the next three games in Asia, some U.S.-based sponsors have bowed out of their official Olympic sponsorship deals, though the IOC has signed on new Asia-based sponsors such as Alibaba Group Holding Ltd ."
General Electric,2017-7,"McDonald's Corp ended a 41-year sponsorship deal with the IOC in June, and the U.S. Olympic Committee also has lost sponsors such as AT&T Inc and Citigroup Inc ahead of the 2018 Winter Games in South Korea. [nL3N1JD3QM]"
General Electric,2017-7,"Visa and Coca-Cola declined to comment beyond saying that their Olympic deals run until 2020. The IOC, P&G, Dow and GE did not respond to a request for comment. Intel, which signed on as a top sponsor in June, is locked in until 2024 and declined to comment."
General Electric,2017-7,"Just knowing the location of Games 11 years out could also benefit U.S. broadcaster NBC, a unit of Comcast Corp , which is signed on until 2032, because it now has significant lead time to work with advertisers and deal with the changing ways people watch the Games over the internet, which has led to lower TV ratings."
General Electric,2017-7,"An NBC spokesman, in a statement, called the next three host cities for the Summer Games, Tokyo, Paris and Los Angeles, ""a U.S. broadcaster's dream."""

General Electric,2017-7,"July 28 (Reuters) - Oilfield services provider Baker Hughes , now part of General Electric Co , expects growth in North American onshore activity to decelerate in the second half of this year, the company said on Friday in a filing."
General Electric,2017-7,"The tempered outlook comes as oil prices fell from highs seen earlier in the year during the second quarter. This week, several major producers lowered capital spending plans for the remainder of the year. [nL1N1KI1DE]"
General Electric,2017-7,"GE's Baker Hughes said it expects international onshore activity to remain stable, with some areas of ""modest growth,"" and global offshore drilling activity to remain muted due to lack of customer confidence in the direction of commodity prices."
General Electric,2017-7,"Baker Hughes reported a smaller quarterly loss compared with a year earlier, when it incurred some restructuring charges."
General Electric,2017-7,"Industrial conglomerate GE earlier this month closed the merger of its oil and gas business with Baker Hughes, leaping over rival Halliburton to create the No. 2 oilfield services provider. Baker Hughes' merger with Halliburton Co collapsed last May."
General Electric,2017-7,"Net loss attributable to Baker Hughes narrowed to $179 million, or 42 cents per share in the second quarter ended June 30, from $911 million, or $2.08 per share, a year earlier. [nBwc5V7pSa]"
General Electric,2017-7,Baker Hughes took restructuring charges of $1.13 billion and a goodwill impairment charge of $1.84 billion in the year-ago quarter.
General Electric,2017-7,Its second-quarter numbers do not include results from GE's oil and gas operations.
General Electric,2017-7,"The company's revenue fell slightly to $2.40 billion in the second quarter, from $2.41 billion a year earlier. However, revenue climbed 6.3 percent from the preceding quarter due to increased drilling activity in the United States."
General Electric,2017-7,"Higher oil prices have prompted an uptick in drilling activity, with companies adding 488 rigs in the past year, nearly double those in operation a year ago, according to the latest data from Baker Hughes."
General Electric,2017-7,Baker's shares were up slightly in pre-market trading at $36.16.
General Electric,2017-7,Halliburton and bigger rival Schlumberger Ltd have also benefited from a boom in North American drilling even though oil prices have stayed below $50 a barrel. [nL3N1KF3TH]
General Electric,2017-7,"Baker Hughes reported a slight 3-percent increase in Latin America revenue sequentially, but said gains from shallow water activity in Mexico and increased sales in Argentina were offset by lower utilization of some services in Mexico and a decrease in artificial lift sales in Venezuela."
General Electric,2017-7,Both Halliburton and Schlumberger took a hit on bills owed by Venezuela in the second quarter. [nL1N1KG200]

General Electric,2017-7,"PARIS, July 28 (Reuters) - Aero engine maker Safran reported a 0.9 percent dip in core first-half profit on Friday as it carries out a product switch between its best-selling CFM56 engine and the new LEAP."
General Electric,2017-7,"The French company, which recently sold its security business and won backing from its shareholders to go ahead with a reduced offer for Zodiac Aerospace , said ongoing operations were clouded by weaker propulsion earnings."
General Electric,2017-7,"Recurring operating income fell to 1.218 billion euros ($1.42 billion) from 1.230 billion, dragging the operating margin 0.2 percentage points lower to 15.2 percent."
General Electric,2017-7,Revenues grew 0.6 percent or 2.4 percent on an underlying basis to 8.038 billion euros. The company reaffirmed targets.
General Electric,2017-7,"Analysts were on average expecting an operating profit of 1.201 billion euros on revenues of 8.086 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S consensus data."
General Electric,2017-7,Margins fell by more than a percentage point at the propulsion division as lower deliveries of the profitable CFM56 made way for loss-making early deliveries of the LEAP and as the helicopter market remained depressed.
General Electric,2017-7,"Aircraft equipment and defence margins rose, while civil aftermarket revenue grew 8.4 percent in dollar terms in the first half but failed to make up for other shortfalls."
General Electric,2017-7,Safran aims to break even on LEAP by the end of the decade.
General Electric,2017-7,Chief Executive Philippe Petitcolin said in a statement that the overall ramp-up of LEAP engines was going according to plan.
General Electric,2017-7,"The engines, co-produced through Safran's CFM joint venture with General Electric , have nonetheless suffered some manufacturing glitches affecting Boeing and Airbus."
General Electric,2017-7,"Although CFM has avoided the number of teething problems felt by rival Pratt & Whitney , India said on Thursday that its state carrier had experienced some delays in getting Airbus jets fitted with engines from the joint-venture. [nL3N1KI4ZV]"
General Electric,2017-7,"PARIS, July 28 (Reuters) - Aero engine maker Safran reported a 0.9 percent dip in core first-half profit on Friday that was still just above forecasts, as aircraft equipment and defence earnings offset headwinds from a switch to a new engine type."
General Electric,2017-7,"The French company, which recently sold its security business and won backing from its shareholders to make a reduced offer for Zodiac Aerospace , said it hoped to go ahead with a formal Zodiac bid by the end of the year."
General Electric,2017-7,"Production of the world's most-sold aircraft engine, the CFM56 co-produced with General Electric , is winding down in favour of its successor, the LEAP, which is ramping up. Progress is in line with plans but it is still making a loss."
General Electric,2017-7,"Recurring operating income fell to 1.218 billion euros ($1.42 billion) from 1.230 billion, dragging the operating margin 0.2 percentage points lower to 15.2 percent, but profits slightly beat expectations because of growth in non-engine businesses which benefited from a two-year cost-cutting drive."
General Electric,2017-7,"Safran shares fell around 1 percent, slightly outperforming a weaker market, as the company reaffirmed its targets."
General Electric,2017-7,Revenues grew 0.6 percent or 2.4 percent on an underlying basis to 8.038 billion euros.
General Electric,2017-7,"Analysts were on average expecting an operating profit of 1.201 billion euros on revenues of 8.086 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S consensus data."
General Electric,2017-7,Civil aftermarket revenue grew 8.4 percent in dollar terms in the first half but was flat in the second quarter.
General Electric,2017-7,Safran said it expected the key services earnings figure to rebound in the second half amid strong airline traffic growth.
General Electric,2017-7,"Safran aims to break even on LEAP in 2020, but together with GE it is in talks with planemakers over increased demand for engines that could theoretically speed the programme into the black earlier than expected [nL5N1KJ1TS]."
General Electric,2017-7,"Chief Executive Philippe Petitcolin cited a quality problem with a part on the model of the engine produced for Airbus. Any impact is expected to be minor, he said. [nL5N1KJ1H7]"

General Electric,2017-7,UPDATE 4-Pratt & Whitney in hot seat as Airbus profits fall - Reuters News
General Electric,2017-7,"{{20170727T150122.239+0000}}UPDATE 4-Pratt & Whitney in hot seat as Airbus profits fall* Q2 op profit down 27 pct, below expectations"
General Electric,2017-7,"PARIS, July 27 (Reuters) - Airbus turned up the heat on engine maker Pratt & Whitney over delays that have disrupted its biggest production line, after reporting a sharp drop in mid-year profits on Thursday."
General Electric,2017-7,"The European planemaker also said it would cut output of the A380, the world's biggest jetliner, to just eight from 2019, putting on life support a project that has been undercut by a generation of nimbler, fuel-efficient long-haul planes."
General Electric,2017-7,"Airbus's shares fell as much as 4.6 percent as investors contrasted its fortunes with those of U.S. arch-rival Boeing , whose stock hit a record high on Wednesday after its quarterly profit and cashflow beat estimates. [nL3N1KH44M]"
General Electric,2017-7,"Airbus Chief Executive Tom Enders challenged Pratt & Whitney, whose fuel-saving Geared Turbofan (GTF) engine is tied to thousands of orders for small A320neo jetliners, to ""work harder"" to fix delays and reliability problems."
General Electric,2017-7,"In an unusual public split with a major supplier, he said the engine maker had failed to meet earlier commitments and took issue with confidence over deliveries voiced by Pratt parent United Technologies ."
General Electric,2017-7,"""You can assume that Airbus is fully in the picture and knows what it is talking about,"" he told reporters, asked about the difference in tone accompanying their respective forecasts."
General Electric,2017-7,"""If there is a difference in messaging and perception, then there is a difference, but our picture is the picture we have at Airbus and ... the situation is unsatisfactory,"" he said."
General Electric,2017-7,"United Technologies this week said it was ""confident"" about building a total of 350-400 GTFs this year. [nL3N1KG3UD]"
General Electric,2017-7,"Airbus reiterated its own delivery goal but added a proviso, saying it depended on engine makers meeting commitments."
General Electric,2017-7,Jefferies analyst Howard Rubel wrote that only 300 GTF engines may qualify as paid customer deliveries in 2017.
General Electric,2017-7,Delays in A320neo deliveries helped slice a third off Airbus first-half profit on flat revenue. Its shares fell despite progress on the ramp-up of the wide-body A350 jet and confirmation of financial targets.
General Electric,2017-7,"Enders confirmed Airbus had delivered ""around 15"" Pratt-powered A320neo twin-engined aircraft in the first half compared with around 100 planned for that variant in 2017. [nL5N1KH4LL]"
General Electric,2017-7,"Asked how this squared with the 134 engines that Pratt says it delivered in the first half, Enders said deliveries of aircraft depended on customer acceptance. [nL3N1KG3UD]"
General Electric,2017-7,Industry sources say some airlines have been refusing to take Pratt-powered jets because of the lack of available spares.
General Electric,2017-7,"India, whose airlines have ordered hundreds of Pratt-powered A320neos, said Pratt had told its regulators it would address delays affecting GoAir and IndiGo. Air India has also had delays in getting jets with CFM engines, a minister said. [nL3N1KI4ZV]"
General Electric,2017-7,"The A320neo is one of several challenges as Airbus tries to accelerate output of new jetliners, fix glitches on its A400M military plane and squeeze costs out of the slow-selling A380."
General Electric,2017-7,"Airbus said it would cut output of the double-decker jet to eight in 2019, a move that insiders said was designed to stretch the dwindling order backlog into the next decade while Airbus tries to convince Emirates, IAG and others to place new orders."
General Electric,2017-7,That compares with 15 this year and 12 in 2018 and means production will continue at what Airbus calls a marginal loss.
General Electric,2017-7,"Enders said Airbus was working on sales campaigns but the probability of immediate success was ""not ... necessarily high""."
General Electric,2017-7,"The second output cut in a year puts off any decision on whether to close the iconic A380, which would force the company to pay redundancies and writedowns but also ease some pressure on its balance sheet from project debts to European governments."
General Electric,2017-7,"Enders said Airbus was in ""constructive talks"" with Qatar Airways over a recent cancellation of four A350s, adding, ""I think we will find a way out"" of the issue. [nL8N1JX4F5]"
General Electric,2017-7,Airbus' second quarter operating profit fell 27 percent to 859 million euros on revenues of 15.27 billion.
General Electric,2017-7,That fell short of the 910 million euros on revenue of 15.82 billion expected by analysts polled by Reuters. [nL5N1KG49A] ($1 = 0.8516 euros)

General Electric,2017-7,* Analyst: stock 'in a state of limbo' ahead of new targets
General Electric,2017-7,"July 21 (Reuters) - General Electric Co's shares dropped sharply on Friday after it posted a 59-percent decline in second-quarter profit and put off an expected cut to 2018 earnings targets until November, when new CEO John Flannery will be four months into his job."
General Electric,2017-7,"The maker of power plants, jet engines, medical scanners and other industrial equipment said profit and sales declines largely reflected sale of its appliances business."
General Electric,2017-7,"It beat analyst expectations on adjusted profit, but cash flow was weak and GE said full-year profit and cash flow will be at the low end of its forecasts."
General Electric,2017-7,"GE also said it would update its 2018 earnings target of $2 a share in November, later than analysts had expected. Analyst consensus 2018 estimate is $1.73, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, already suggesting a significant cut. [nL1N1KC0D2]"
General Electric,2017-7,"The length and scope of the review raised concern, since GE has just come through major shifts in its portfolio."
General Electric,2017-7,"""It's discouraging that we're going to wait again for the company to perform as we wait for the new CEO to review everything,"" said Jim Corridore, analyst at research firm CFRA, which cut GE shares to ""hold"" after Friday's results."
General Electric,2017-7,"Incoming CEO Flannery acknowledged on a conference call that his review would take time, but said it had not altered GE's 2017 outlook."
General Electric,2017-7,"Still, the stock could be in ""in a state of limbo"" until the review is finished, Deane Dray, analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said in a note."
General Electric,2017-7,"GE's cash flow was below expectations and also weighed on the stock, said Jeff Windau, analyst at Edward Jones. ""People want to get the answers sooner"" to Flannery's review."
General Electric,2017-7,Shares were down 3 percent at $25.87 in mid-morning trading after earlier hitting a 2-year low. [nL3N1KC484]
General Electric,2017-7,"GE faced a ""slow-growth, volatile environment"" in the quarter, Chief Executive Jeff Immelt said in his final earnings release before his Aug. 1 retirement."
General Electric,2017-7,"Immelt's tenure began days before the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and included the 2008 financial crisis. While GE stock is 27 percent below its price when Immelt arrived, it has more than tripled from its nadir in 2009."
General Electric,2017-7,"Immelt sold off NBCUniversal, appliances and most of GE Capital. He acquired power assets from France's Alstom , merged GE's oil and gas business with Baker Hughes, and moved the headquarters to Boston."
General Electric,2017-7,"Flannery said he is ""in the middle of a series of deep dives into the businesses."" He also is ""taking a hard look at our corporate spending"" to ensure it contributes to earnings, and on a listening tour of investors."
General Electric,2017-7,"GE has cut $670 million in industrial overhead costs this year, Immelt said, and will ""meet or exceed"" its $1 billion target for 2017 - a goal set after discussion with activist investor Trian Fund Management."
General Electric,2017-7,"GE was under pressure to report strong cash flow after a weak showing in the first quarter. Cash flow from operations totaled $3.6 billion, up from $400 million in the first quarter. The figure was down 67 percent from a year ago, partly reflecting the loss of contributions from the appliances division."
General Electric,2017-7,"Revenue fell 12 percent to $29.56 billion, slightly above the $29.02 billion consensus estimate of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. GE said its appliances sale eliminated $3.1 billion of revenue."

General Electric,2017-7,BREAKINGVIEWS-GE's new boss may find inspiration from Honeywell - Reuters Breakingviews
General Electric,2017-7,{{20170721T171142.818+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-GE's new boss may find inspiration from Honeywell(The authors are Reuters Breakingviews columnists. The opinions expressed are their own.)
General Electric,2017-7,"NEW YORK, July 21 (Reuters Breakingviews) - General Electric's new boss should look elsewhere for a role model. Jeff Immelt's weak earnings swan song at the $222 billion industrial giant underscores the challenge for successor John Flannery. Making quick progress on early goals is key, as Darius Adamczyk is doing several months in at Honeywell . With activists in both stocks, that should be a no-brainer."
General Electric,2017-7,"GE's second-quarter performance wasn't all bad in the face of a ""slow-growth, volatile environment,"" as Immelt put it. Revenue and adjusted earnings per share beat analysts' estimates, while organic revenue growth was on target at 4 percent and orders were up 5 percent."
General Electric,2017-7,"There were plenty of weak spots, though. Low crude prices, a drop in U.S. locomotive orders and sluggish services depressed operating profit in the company's oil and gas, transportation and power divisions, respectively. The company is now targeting the low end of its previous range for second-half cash flow and full-year earnings per share. The disposal of its industrial-solutions business, which sells electrical equipment, may slip into next year."
General Electric,2017-7,"Flannery, who takes over at the start of August, promises to take a fresh swipe at expenses with a zero-based budgeting exercise but won't unveil his overall plans until an investor day in November. Shareholders aren't waiting. Concern that his first move will be to lower earnings guidance for 2018 pushed the stock down nearly 3 percent to $25.94 in midday trading."
General Electric,2017-7,"By contrast, Adamczyk hit the ground running, outlining some of his strategy in March, a month before taking the helm. He also took in his stride the April appearance of Daniel Loeb's Third Point. The activist believes selling the aerospace unit would boost shareholder value 20 percent."
General Electric,2017-7,"Although he vows to look at all options, Adamczyk has overseen an improvement in the business. Aerospace revenue grew 2 percent in the latest quarter, excluding the sale of a business last year, while its operating margin hit 22.3 percent."
General Electric,2017-7,"That helped new management to increase its full-year earnings outlook for the second quarter in a row and bumped up the company's overall margin to 19 percent. Not surprisingly, Honeywell's stock is trading at 19.3 times the midpoint of management's own estimates for this year's earnings, ahead of GE's 15.7 multiple. Flannery shouldn't waste time in putting his imagination to work."
General Electric,2017-7,"- General Electric on July 21 reported net income attributable to shareholders of $1.2 billion for the second quarter, down 59 percent from the same period a year earlier. Earnings adjusted to strip out expected disposals were 28 cents a share, compared with the consensus estimate of sell-side analysts of 25 cents."
General Electric,2017-7,"- Revenue of $29.6 billion was down 12 percent, largely reflecting the sale of the company's appliances business. That exceeded analysts' expectations of $29 billion."
General Electric,2017-7,"- Cash flow from operations fell 67 percent in the latest quarter from the same period a year earlier, to $3.6 billion. Orders were up 6 percent, at $28.3 billion. The company reduced expenses by $700 million in the first half of 2017. Earlier this year GE announced plans to cut costs by $1 billion by the end of December in response to pressure from activist Nelson Peltz's Trian Partners."
General Electric,2017-7,"- Honeywell International on July 21 reported second-quarter net income attributable to common shareholders of $1.39 billion, a 5.5 percent increase on the same period last year. At $1.80, earnings per share beat the consensus estimate of sell-side analysts of $1.78 a share. Revenue of $9.9 billion beat the estimate of $9.89 billion."
General Electric,2017-7,"- Activist hedge fund Third Point, run by Daniel Loeb, in April argued that Honeywell could increase shareholder value by $20 billion if it sold its aerospace unit. Revenue in that division fell 3 percent from last year's second quarter, lower than the company had expected as organic growth helped offset income lost from selling a part of the business. Aerospace's operating margin, meanwhile, increase 1.4 percentage points to 22.3 percent."
General Electric,2017-7,"- Honeywell also increased its outlook for the year. It now expects revenue to be between $39.3 billion and $40 billion, up from its previous estimate of $38.6 billion to $39.5 billion."

General Electric,2017-7,"July 21 (Reuters) - General Electric Co's shares dropped sharply on Friday after it posted a 59-percent decline in second-quarter profit and put off an expected cut to 2018 earnings targets until November, when new CEO John Flannery will be four months into his job."
General Electric,2017-7,"The maker of power plants, jet engines, medical scanners and other industrial equipment said profit and sales declines largely reflected sale of its appliances business."
General Electric,2017-7,"It beat analyst expectations on adjusted profit, but cash flow was weak and GE said full-year profit and cash flow will be at the low end of its forecasts."
General Electric,2017-7,"GE also said it would update its 2018 earnings target of $2 a share in November, later than analysts had expected. Analyst consensus 2018 estimate is $1.73, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, already suggesting a significant cut. [nL1N1KC0D2]"
General Electric,2017-7,"The length and scope of the review raised concern, since GE has just come through major shifts in its portfolio."
General Electric,2017-7,"""It's discouraging that we're going to wait again for the company to perform as we wait for the new CEO to review everything,"" said Jim Corridore, analyst at research firm CFRA, which cut GE shares to ""hold"" after Friday's results."
General Electric,2017-7,"Incoming CEO Flannery acknowledged on a conference call that his review would take time, but said it had not altered GE's 2017 outlook."
General Electric,2017-7,"Still, the stock could be in ""in a state of limbo"" until the review is finished, Deane Dray, analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said in a note."

General Electric,2017-7,"Immelt's tenure began days before the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and included the 2008 financial crisis. While GE stock is 27 percent below its price when Immelt arrived, it has more than tripled from its nadir in 2009."
General Electric,2017-7,"Immelt sold off NBCUniversal, appliances and most of GE Capital. He acquired power assets from France's Alstom , merged GE's oil and gas business with Baker Hughes, and moved the headquarters to Boston."
General Electric,2017-7,"Flannery said he is ""in the middle of a series of deep dives into the businesses."" He also is ""taking a hard look at our corporate spending"" to ensure it contributes to earnings, and on a listening tour of investors."
General Electric,2017-7,"GE has cut $670 million in industrial overhead costs this year, Immelt said, and will ""meet or exceed"" its $1 billion target for 2017 - a goal set after discussion with activist investor Trian Fund Management."
General Electric,2017-7,"GE was under pressure to report strong cash flow after a weak showing in the first quarter. Cash flow from operations totaled $3.6 billion, up from $400 million in the first quarter. The figure was down 67 percent from a year ago, partly reflecting the loss of contributions from the appliances division."
General Electric,2017-7,"Revenue fell 12 percent to $29.56 billion, slightly above the $29.02 billion consensus estimate of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. GE said its appliances sale eliminated $3.1 billion of revenue."
General Electric,2017-7,"Net profit slumped 59 percent to $1.34 billion, or 15 cents a share, in the quarter ended June 30, from $3.30 billion, or 36 cents a share, a year earlier."

General Electric,2017-7,BREAKINGVIEWS-GE's new boss may find inspiration from Honeywell - Reuters Breakingviews
General Electric,2017-7,{{20170721T171142.818+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-GE's new boss may find inspiration from Honeywell(The authors are Reuters Breakingviews columnists. The opinions expressed are their own.)
General Electric,2017-7,"NEW YORK, July 21 (Reuters Breakingviews) - General Electric's new boss should look elsewhere for a role model. Jeff Immelt's weak earnings swan song at the $222 billion industrial giant underscores the challenge for successor John Flannery. Making quick progress on early goals is key, as Darius Adamczyk is doing several months in at Honeywell . With activists in both stocks, that should be a no-brainer."
General Electric,2017-7,"GE's second-quarter performance wasn't all bad in the face of a ""slow-growth, volatile environment,"" as Immelt put it. Revenue and adjusted earnings per share beat analysts' estimates, while organic revenue growth was on target at 4 percent and orders were up 5 percent."
General Electric,2017-7,"There were plenty of weak spots, though. Low crude prices, a drop in U.S. locomotive orders and sluggish services depressed operating profit in the company's oil and gas, transportation and power divisions, respectively. The company is now targeting the low end of its previous range for second-half cash flow and full-year earnings per share. The disposal of its industrial-solutions business, which sells electrical equipment, may slip into next year."
General Electric,2017-7,"Flannery, who takes over at the start of August, promises to take a fresh swipe at expenses with a zero-based budgeting exercise but won't unveil his overall plans until an investor day in November. Shareholders aren't waiting. Concern that his first move will be to lower earnings guidance for 2018 pushed the stock down nearly 3 percent to $25.94 in midday trading."
General Electric,2017-7,"By contrast, Adamczyk hit the ground running, outlining some of his strategy in March, a month before taking the helm. He also took in his stride the April appearance of Daniel Loeb's Third Point. The activist believes selling the aerospace unit would boost shareholder value 20 percent."
General Electric,2017-7,"Although he vows to look at all options, Adamczyk has overseen an improvement in the business. Aerospace revenue grew 2 percent in the latest quarter, excluding the sale of a business last year, while its operating margin hit 22.3 percent."
General Electric,2017-7,"That helped new management to increase its full-year earnings outlook for the second quarter in a row and bumped up the company's overall margin to 19 percent. Not surprisingly, Honeywell's stock is trading at 19.3 times the midpoint of management's own estimates for this year's earnings, ahead of GE's 15.7 multiple. Flannery shouldn't waste time in putting his imagination to work."
General Electric,2017-7,"- General Electric on July 21 reported net income attributable to shareholders of $1.2 billion for the second quarter, down 59 percent from the same period a year earlier. Earnings adjusted to strip out expected disposals were 28 cents a share, compared with the consensus estimate of sell-side analysts of 25 cents."
General Electric,2017-7,"- Revenue of $29.6 billion was down 12 percent, largely reflecting the sale of the company's appliances business. That exceeded analysts' expectations of $29 billion."
General Electric,2017-7,"- Cash flow from operations fell 67 percent in the latest quarter from the same period a year earlier, to $3.6 billion. Orders were up 6 percent, at $28.3 billion. The company reduced expenses by $700 million in the first half of 2017. Earlier this year GE announced plans to cut costs by $1 billion by the end of December in response to pressure from activist Nelson Peltz's Trian Partners."
General Electric,2017-7,"- Honeywell International on July 21 reported second-quarter net income attributable to common shareholders of $1.39 billion, a 5.5 percent increase on the same period last year. At $1.80, earnings per share beat the consensus estimate of sell-side analysts of $1.78 a share. Revenue of $9.9 billion beat the estimate of $9.89 billion."
General Electric,2017-7,"- Activist hedge fund Third Point, run by Daniel Loeb, in April argued that Honeywell could increase shareholder value by $20 billion if it sold its aerospace unit. Revenue in that division fell 3 percent from last year's second quarter, lower than the company had expected as organic growth helped offset income lost from selling a part of the business. Aerospace's operating margin, meanwhile, increase 1.4 percentage points to 22.3 percent."
General Electric,2017-7,"- Honeywell also increased its outlook for the year. It now expects revenue to be between $39.3 billion and $40 billion, up from its previous estimate of $38.6 billion to $39.5 billion."

General Electric,2017-7,{{20170713T193537.346+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-BlackRock opens new investment passivity front(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.)
General Electric,2017-7,"NEW YORK, July 13 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Larry Fink is opening a new front in the passive investment war on fund management. His firm, BlackRock , will sell exchange-traded funds using its own customized fixed-income indexes - and slash fees. It's a formula the money manager with $5.4 trillion of assets has used in equities to eat stock pickers' lunch. For an industry with little growth, the casualties of this latest assault may be widespread."
General Electric,2017-7,"Low cost and ample liquidity have made ETFs wildly popular for everyone from retail investors to hedge funds. Most of the action has been in equities, though. They represent nearly 80 percent of the U.S. industry's $3 trillion of assets, compared with just under 18 percent for fixed income."
General Electric,2017-7,The reasons are structural. ETFs track everything from broad indexes like the S&P 500 to so-called smart beta products that follow specific sectors or style factors such as low volatility.
General Electric,2017-7,"By contrast, the bond market is heavily fragmented. Companies like Apple and General Electric have dozens of bond issues outstanding but typically only one common share. There are a relative handful of widely followed bond indexes, like the Barclays Capital U.S. Aggregate, a broad gauge of investment-grade issues. BlackRock's iShares subsidiary uses that index for its largest bond ETF."
General Electric,2017-7,"Now the firm is offering two new bond ETFs that track its own customized indexes: one focusing on investment-grade bonds paying higher than average yields and another on high-yield bonds with low default risk. BlackRock is betting products like these will shake up bond investing just as they have equities. For extra measure, it's slashing fees on its existing mortgage-backed securities ETF by two-thirds, hoping to benefit when the Federal Reserve begins to sell down its massive holdings later this year."
General Electric,2017-7,"Fresh innovation by the world's largest manager, with a $71 billion market value, is more bad news for rivals. Assets under management rose 6 percent in the United States last year to some $33 trillion, but that was all market appreciation, according to Boston Consulting Group. Net new flows were slightly negative. The lack of growth and competition from passive vehicles has squeezed industry revenue margins by nearly a quarter over the past decade, to less than $27 for every $10,000 of assets."
General Electric,2017-7,"Fidelity Investments, which has been hit hard by the indexing trend, said earlier this week it was firing several hundred employees. There will be more active victims before the passive onslaught runs its course."
General Electric,2017-7,"- BlackRock on July 13 said it was launching four new bond exchange-traded funds and cut fees on another in a bid to attract investors. The company's ETF subsidiary, iShares, said two of the new products - a high-yield bond ETF and an investment-grade bond fund - will track new indexes created by BlackRock. Until now the company's ETFs have tracked indexes created by third-party providers."
General Electric,2017-7,"- The firm is also cutting the fee on its iShares MBS ETF, which tracks an index of mortgage-backed securities, to $9 a year for every $10,000 invested, from $27."
General Electric,2017-7,"- ""We have aspirations to be ubiquitous in every securities market,"" Martin Small, U.S. head of iShares, told Reuters."

General Electric,2017-7,"ISTANBUL, July 11 (Reuters) - The U.S. shale drilling boom is likely to ease next year as demand on the industry's service sector is unsustainable, Halliburton's business development head said on Tuesday."
General Electric,2017-7,"The number of rigs drilling for oil in the United States rose to 763 last week, the highest in more than two years, showing that despite oil trading below $50 a barrel, shale oil explorers are still ramping up activity. [nL1N1JX19E]"
General Electric,2017-7,"Halliburton's Mark Richard, senior vice president for global business development and marketing, sees that count rising above 1,000 by the end of the year, but not beyond that."
General Electric,2017-7,"""I think it might level off then. If our customers put too much out there, it's costing too much and putting too much demand on service companies to provide equipment and people,"" he told Reuters at an industry event in Istanbul."
General Electric,2017-7,Oil services companies cut back dramatically when demand for their products fell oil prices started falling in 2014 and it has taken them longer to readjust their output.
General Electric,2017-7,Richard said he sees 800-900 rigs as a more sustainable level in the medium term.
General Electric,2017-7,"The increase in shale activity has been a boon for companies like Halliburton which supply equipment to the sector and Richard said he had been able to raise prices in the U.S. because of rising demand, but declined to give details."
General Electric,2017-7,"However, appetite for oil and gas equipment is still weak outside of the Americas, Richard said."
General Electric,2017-7,"""We've hit the bottom in the first half of this year. Our customers are getting excited about things but we don't yet see a lot of activity increasing."""
General Electric,2017-7,"Richard denied Halliburton was under additional pressure following the acquisition of rival Baker Hughes, which it failed to buy last year after regulatory opposition, by GE Oil & Gas last week. [nL1N1JU0N3]"

General Electric,2017-7,* Pakistan in talks on govt-to-govt LNG supply deals
General Electric,2017-7,"ISLAMABAD, July 10 (Reuters) - Pakistan says it could become one of the world's top-five buyers of liquefied natural gas (LNG), with Petroleum Minister Shahid Abbasi predicting imports could jump more than fivefold as private companies build new LNG terminals."
General Electric,2017-7,"Outlining Pakistan's ambitious plans - which, if fully implemented, could shake up the global LNG market - Abbasi told Reuters that imports could top 30 million tonnes by 2022, up from just 4.5 million tonnes currently."
General Electric,2017-7,"Cheaper than fuel oil and cleaner burning than coal, LNG suits emerging economies seeking to bridge electricity shortfalls and support growth on tight budgets."
General Electric,2017-7,"""Within five years, I don't see any reason why we should not be beyond 30 million tonnes (in annual LNG imports). We will be one of the top five markets in the world,"" Abbasi said."
General Electric,2017-7,"That kind of jump would represent one of the fastest growth stories in the energy industry, comparable to what China has done in many commodities - but there are doubts whether Pakistan can achieve its ambitions, given the complexity and cost of expansion projects."
General Electric,2017-7,"""It's always possible, but seems very difficult as they will need much more (regasification) capacity and downstream pipeline capacity,"" said Trevor Sikorski at Energy Aspects, a London-based industry market researcher. ""There are infrastructural issues and financial issues."""
General Electric,2017-7,"""Still, it is one of the key LNG growth markets, and its demand will help tighten up the market that has threatened to lurch into over supply."""
General Electric,2017-7,"Abbasi said no one took Pakistan seriously after a decade of botched attempts to bring LNG to the country, but this has changed with the construction of new LNG terminals and gas plants. He said foreign suppliers are now arriving in Pakistan - where energy shortages have prompted Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to promise he'll end the country's frequent blackouts."
General Electric,2017-7,"""Before, we used to go out to talk to LNG suppliers. Now they're coming to us,"" Abbasi said."
General Electric,2017-7,"""(LNG) is really what has saved the whole energy system. It has been a huge success in Pakistan and it will continue,"" he said after Sharif on Friday inaugurated a new Chinese-built LNG power plant that uses General Electric turbines."
General Electric,2017-7,"Pakistan built its first LNG terminal in 2015 and, after some delays, a second terminal is due to come online in October, doubling annual import capacity to about 9 million tonnes."
General Electric,2017-7,"A consortium of Exxon Mobil , Total , Mitsubishi <8058.T>, Qatar Petroleum and Norway's Hoegh is expected to decide by September whether to build a third LNG terminal for about $700 million, Abbasi said."
General Electric,2017-7,"Pakistan has dropped plans to finance up to two more terminals, as private companies have said they would finance these themselves and use Pakistan's existing gas network to sell directly to consumers."
General Electric,2017-7,"""That's been the real success and that's where the growth will come from,"" Abbasi said, adding that about 10 million homes are linked to gas connections in Pakistan - a nation of around 200 million."
General Electric,2017-7,"""In the last four years, we would have added two million additional connections. We are really ramping that up."""
General Electric,2017-7,"If Pakistan achieves its ambitious development goals, it could significantly erode market oversupply, which has helped pull down Asian LNG spot prices by more than 70 percent since 2014 to around $5 per million British thermal units (mmBtu)."
General Electric,2017-7,"Abbasi said Pakistan is in talks with Russia, Indonesia, Malaysia and Oman about government-to-government deals for up to three monthly LNG cargoes for its second terminal, which can import 600 million cubic feet of gas per day, equal to six cargoes a month."
General Electric,2017-7,"""We have a basic idea of what the market is. So if we are able to better those prices through negotiated procurement, we will go with that, otherwise we might float some more tenders,"" Abbasi said."
General Electric,2017-7,"Tenders for two of the terminal's six cargoes have already been won by trading house Gunvor and Italy's Eni , which have signed 5-year and 15-year deals, respectively. The contracts are worth about $5 billion over their lifetime. [nL8N1I43LO]"
General Electric,2017-7,Qatar supplies most of the gas for Pakistan's first LNG terminal.
General Electric,2017-7,"Abbasi said Pakistan is considering inviting private investors to build small-scale gas power plants to add another 3,000-4,000 megawatts to the network, on top of the three new LNG plants that will contribute 3,600 MW."

General Electric,2017-7,"{{20170703T144917.492+0000}}RPT-GE closes Baker Hughes deal, becomes No. 2 oilfield service provider(Repeats with no changes)"
General Electric,2017-7,"HOUSTON, July 3 (Reuters) - General Electric Co on Monday completed its buyout of Baker Hughes Inc , merging it with its own oil and gas equipment and services operations to create the world's second-largest oilfield service provider by revenue."
General Electric,2017-7,"The new company, to be called ""Baker Hughes, a GE company,"" will begin trading on Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange under the stock ticker ""BHGE.""[nL4N1D13FG]"
General Electric,2017-7,"With headquarters in London and Houston, the combined company will have roughly $23 billion in annual revenue and offer oilfield gear including blowout preventers, pumps, drilling, chemicals, other products and services for oil producers in 120 countries."
General Electric,2017-7,"For Baker Hughes, the deal helps it grow in size and become an even-more important player in the industry after antitrust concerns scuttled a tie-up last year with rival Halliburton Co . The GE deal vaults the merged business past Halliburton to rival only Schlumberger NV for dominance in the global oilfield service market."
General Electric,2017-7,"For GE, the deal will help it focus more on the oil and gas sector, especially in North America, while shielding the parent company's earnings from the energy industry's boom and bust cycles. All of GE's oil and gas-related businesses will be folded into the new company, which will be 62.5 percent owned by GE. Baker shareholders will own the rest and receive a one-time, $17.50 dividend."
General Electric,2017-7,"The deal, when announced last autumn, was predicated on a recovery in the oil price to $60 per barrel by 2019, an increase that now seems less likely with a glut of crude still circling the globe and keeping prices below $50."
General Electric,2017-7,"Still, executives at the new company said the combination should help customers better perform if prices stay lower."
General Electric,2017-7,"""The crystal ball for all of us is cloudy,"" said Lorenzo Simonelli, the company's chief executive, who will relocate to Houston from London."
General Electric,2017-7,"""But we know energy requirements are still going to increase, globally. The fundamentals are there for energy."""
General Electric,2017-7,Analysts and investors generally praised the deal as data analytics and other high-technology operations grow in demand among oil producers.[nL1N1J61GW]
General Electric,2017-7,"""The GE-Baker deal will likely move the sector towards embracing Big Data in production optimization,"" said Jonathan Garrett of industry consultancy Wood Mackenzie."
General Electric,2017-7,"The new company will have roughly 70,000 employees and be led by Simonelli and 14 senior executives. Only five of those executives will be legacy Baker Hughes employees, with most from GE."
General Electric,2017-7,"The company will have access to GE's research and development facilities and be able to access GE's Predix software and analytics, Simonelli said."
