Chevron,2017-5,"ST PETERSBURG, Russia, June 2 (Reuters) - Russian oil major Rosneft agreed on Friday to explore and develop five fields in Iraq's Kurdistan as the company seeks to become a key player in one of the world's newest and fastest-growing oil provinces."
Chevron,2017-5,"Kremlin-controlled Rosneft this year became the first oil major to pre-finance Kurdish crude exports, an activity long dominated by trading houses, which had bankrolled the semi-autonomous region amid its fight against Islamic State and a budget crisis caused by low oil prices."
Chevron,2017-5,"On Friday, Rosneft and the government of Kurdistan signed production-sharing deals for five oil blocks, with Rosneft saying it would also aim to explore for gas in the future."
Chevron,2017-5,"Igor Sechin, Rosneft chief executive and a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, said the company was widening cooperation with Kurdistan following the first direct purchases of Kurdish oil for Rosneft's German refineries earlier this year."
Chevron,2017-5,"""The agreements ... set an example of well-weighed investments in one of the key Middle East regions, which will make it possible for the company to expand its exploration and production geography, provide feedstock for Rosneft's growing refining network and to raise profitability of our international assets,"" Sechin said in a statement."
Chevron,2017-5,"The documents were signed by Sechin and Kurdish natural resources minister Ashti Hawrami on the sidelines of Russia's main investment show, the St Petersburg International Economic Forum, where Putin was due to meet Kurdish premier Nechirvan Barzani."
Chevron,2017-5,Iraq had long opposed Kurdish independent oil sales but has lately eased its stance amid joint efforts by the regional government and Baghdad to defeat Islamic State.
Chevron,2017-5,"Rosneft and Kurdistan also said they had agreed on ""monetization of the export oil pipeline in Kurdistan"" with Rosneft getting access to the regional transportation system, which has throughput capacity of 700,000 barrels per day (bpd)."
Chevron,2017-5,"By the end of 2017, Kurdistan plans to expand the pipeline to 1 million bpd, or 1 percent of global output, betting on the arrival of new volumes from fresh developments."
Chevron,2017-5,Kurdish oil production has been mainly led in recent years by mid-sized firms including Genel. Larger companies such as Exxon Mobil and Chevron are still at the exploratory stage and have recently returned some blocks to Kurdistan after disappointing searches.
Chevron,2017-5,"Rosneft said the deals signed on Friday would allow it to talk about ""full entry in one of the most promising regions of the developing global energy market""."

Chevron,2017-5,"HOUSTON, May 25 (Reuters) - U.S. oil services companies have been doing a lot more work as recovering oil prices have lifted the shale industry from a two-year slump, but producers have been pocketing much of the new cash generated by rising output and squeezing service providers to keep costs down."
Chevron,2017-5,"Oil service companies that provide the crews, labor and technology used to drill, construct and operate wells are lagging the recovery in U.S. shale producers. The lopsided situation could chill the production rebound or keep it from spreading to more shale fields, executives of services companies said."
Chevron,2017-5,"Rising demand for certain services means raising salaries to attract workers and refurbishing equipment, while often being paid under fixed contracts signed during harder times, these companies said. That has pressured margins, leading to further losses. Law firm Haynes and Boone LLP said the U.S. oilfield sector experienced 127 bankruptcies between 2015 and April 2017."
Chevron,2017-5,"Among the 10 largest oilfield service providers, just five were profitable last quarter, the same number as a year ago. In contrast, seven of the top shale oil producers posted a first quarter profit, up from just one a year ago."
Chevron,2017-5,"""Both of us have to be able to earn a return and give something back to our shareholders,"" David Lesar, chief executive officer of Halliburton Co , the world's second-largest oilfield services company, said in an interview."
Chevron,2017-5,"The sector is struggling to change onerous contract terms set when oil prices were much lower. Service companies agreed to those prices out of necessity; they needed cash flow to cover expenses. Those contracts, some of which extend into next year, are contributing to losses, preventing some companies from adding equipment or moving it to oil fields where it could be put to use."
Chevron,2017-5,"The expiration of those contracts should allow prices for high-demand services to rise, oilfield services executives said."
Chevron,2017-5,"Even so, some of the changes that shale oil producers made during the downturn are likely to stick, making it harder for service firms to drive up prices."
Chevron,2017-5,"Oil producers have better returns today because of those cost controls, winning greater favor among investors."
Chevron,2017-5,"""Many of (oil producers) have reduced capex spending and are increasing capital returns to investors,"" said Tom Bergeron, a senior fund manager for Frost Investment Advisors."
Chevron,2017-5,"Shale firms have demanded deals that unbundle the functions of service providers, allowing them to spread the work out among more companies, who then have less leverage to raise prices."
Chevron,2017-5,Those practices allowed shale producer profits to start rebounding just a few months after oil prices began to recover from the $26 a barrel nadir of February 2016 . But it left services companies without a way to immediately benefit from the U.S. crude benchmark's return to about $50 a barrel.
Chevron,2017-5,"Service companies hope they can raise prices by the second half of this year, but for now there is limited scope to pass along costs, Chakra Mandava, an operations executive at Nabors Drilling USA, , said at an energy conference this month in Houston."

Chevron,2017-5,"BOSTON, May 22 (Reuters) - Shareholder activists focused on climate issues are gaining traction in their push to have large energy companies and utilities take account of the impact rising global temperatures could have on their businesses."
Chevron,2017-5,Proponents ranging from giant New York and California state pension funds to Wespath Investment Management of Illinois scored a number of victories this month.
Chevron,2017-5,Those include a resolution at PPL Corp approved by 57 percent of votes cast calling for the utility holding company to publicly report how it could be affected by policies and technologies aimed at limiting global warning.
Chevron,2017-5,"The PPL result comes on the heels of a vote at Occidental Petroleum Corp on a similar resolution, backed by two-thirds of votes cast. Also, top proxy advisers recommended votes in favor of a third such resolution set for Exxon Mobil Corp's annual meeting on May 31.[nL4N1IL1K7]"
Chevron,2017-5,"Activists say the developments suggest they are at an inflection point after years of seeking support from big institutional investors like BlackRock Inc. The giant New York asset manager switched sides in this year's vote at Occidental, citing concerns about the company's pace of disclosures to date.[nL1N1IE20Q]"
Chevron,2017-5,"The reports the activists have sought through the advisory shareholder resolutions are sometimes known as ""2 degree scenario analysis"" reports after the goal of the 2015 Paris climate accord to limit global temperature increases to 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) from preindustrial levels by phasing out fossil fuels."
Chevron,2017-5,"The limits could hit companies' bottom lines such as by reducing the revenue they can expect from extracting fossil fuel reserves. Activists hope that having the companies lay out plans for dealing with future regulatory, technology and market changes will smooth their transition to cleaner energy."
Chevron,2017-5,"Edward Kamonjoh, executive director of the 50/50 Climate Project in Washington, which supports the resolutions, said actions by U.S. President Donald Trump like the dismantling of Obama-era climate policies may have moved big investors to take on a more active role."
Chevron,2017-5,"While Trump has not so far followed through on a campaign promise to take the United States out of the Paris deal, investors cannot count on strong environmental regulations in the future, he said."
Chevron,2017-5,"""Investors who feel that climate is a risk now realize they just have themselves to manage this risk in the next few years,"" Kamonjoh said."
Chevron,2017-5,"Most energy company and utility boards have urged their investors to oppose the measures, some arguing they already take climate change seriously."
Chevron,2017-5,A key test of investors' mood will come at the end of May at Exxon. The largest U.S. oil & gas producer argues a climate report is unnecessary because it already conducts reviews that sufficiently test its business for impacts from changing technology and energy demand.
Chevron,2017-5,"Exxon has offered other arguments including that it supports the Paris agreement, Exxon Secretary Jeffrey Woodbury told investors in a May 18 letter, and that it has invested nearly $7 billion since 2000 on emissions-reduction technology."
Chevron,2017-5,"At PPL, spokesman Ryan Hill said via e-mail that its board ""will carefully consider the results and determine the best path forward."" PPL is committed to sustainable energy, he said, noting steps it has taken such as retiring coal plants and building Kentucky's largest solar power facility."
Chevron,2017-5,"Some companies have made changes even without votes. Activists including Wespath on May 2 said they withdrew a call for a climate-change report from Chevron Corp, citing an 18-page document Chevron issued in March titled ""Managing Climate Risks"" as a good first step."
Chevron,2017-5,"While it did not analyze all the scenarios sought by activists, the report went further than past efforts to outline how climate change could affect its profitability."
Chevron,2017-5,"Chevron CEO John Watson said in the report he ""shares the concerns of governments and the public about climate change risks."""
Chevron,2017-5,"Also, Danielle Fugure, president of California nonprofit As You Sow, said last month it withdrew a shareholder resolution calling for a climate risk report from Anadarko Petroleum Corp.. In return, she said, the Texas company agreed to continue to work with her group and others to develop methods for reporting on climate risks that would be practical for the company but still convey to investors the full extent of the risks it could face."
Chevron,2017-5,"Anadarko spokesman John Christiansen confirmed the agreement. ""We are consistently looking for ways to further enhance sustainability in our operations, as well as improve transparency regarding these efforts,"" he said via e-mail."
Chevron,2017-5,"Fugure said the high vote totals such as at Occidental show how climate change is becoming an accepted business issue. ""The market itself is moving to take carbon risk into account, and the market itself will be pricing carbon risk into the value of companies,"" she said."

Chevron,2017-5,"LEA COUNTY, N.M., May 17 (Reuters) - As oilfield workers for Lilis Energy Inc threaded together drill pipes one recent morning in the Permian Basin, a bulldozer cleared sagebrush to make way for the company's fifth well since January."
Chevron,2017-5,Lilis aims to expand production sevenfold this year in America's most active oilfield.
Chevron,2017-5,"The whir of activity is all the more impressive after the small firm nearly collapsed in late 2015 - amid unrestrained production from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). As per-barrel prices plummeted, Lilis piled on debt and struggled to pay workers."
Chevron,2017-5,Now - with prices higher after a November OPEC decision to cut output - Lilis can't grow fast enough.
Chevron,2017-5,"Such resurrections are common these days in the Permian, which stretches across West Texas and eastern New Mexico. They tell the story of the U.S. shale resurgence and the quandary it poses for OPEC as it struggles to tame a global glut."
Chevron,2017-5,"Surging U.S. production has stalled OPEC's effort to cut supply. Inventories in industrialized nations totaled 3.05 billion barrels in February - about 330 million barrels above the five-year average, according to the International Energy Agency."

Chevron,2017-5,"In the long term, too much U.S. output could spur OPEC to open the spigots again - setting off another price war - but for now its member nations' need for revenue makes that unlikely."
Chevron,2017-5,"On Monday, the world's top two oil producers - OPEC heavyweight Saudi Arabia and Russia, a non-OPEC nation - said they had agreed in principle on the need to continue output cuts for an additional nine months, through March 2018. [nL4N1IH4FH]"
Chevron,2017-5,"That would extend the initial agreement, which took effect in January and reduced production by 1.2 barrels per day (bpd) from OPEC nations and another 600,000 bpd from non-OPEC producers, including Russia."

Chevron,2017-5,"LEA COUNTY, N.M., May 17 (Reuters) - As oilfield workers for Lilis Energy Inc threaded together drill pipes one recent morning in the Permian Basin, a bulldozer cleared sagebrush to make way for the company's fifth well since January."
Chevron,2017-5,Lilis aims to expand production sevenfold this year in America's most active oilfield.
Chevron,2017-5,"The whir of activity is all the more impressive after the small firm nearly collapsed in late 2015 - amid unrestrained production from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). As per-barrel prices plummeted, Lilis piled on debt and struggled to pay workers."
Chevron,2017-5,Now - with prices higher after a November OPEC decision to cut output - Lilis can't grow fast enough.
Chevron,2017-5,"Such resurrections are common these days in the Permian, which stretches across West Texas and eastern New Mexico. They tell the story of the U.S. shale resurgence and the quandary it poses for OPEC as it struggles to tame a global glut."
Chevron,2017-5,"Surging U.S. production has stalled OPEC's effort to cut supply. Inventories in industrialized nations totaled 3.05 billion barrels in February - about 330 million barrels above the five-year average, according to the International Energy Agency."

Chevron,2017-5,"BOSTON, May 12 (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc said on Friday that it voted in favor of a successful shareholder proposal calling for more climate change reporting by Occidental Petroleum Corp , in the first sign the world's largest asset manager was backing up its tough new talk on environmental matters."
Chevron,2017-5,"Backers of the resolution called its passage a major victory, the first time such a measure succeeded at a major U.S. oil and gas company. Proponents said they were pleased by BlackRock's support, which they had sought."
Chevron,2017-5,"BlackRock , which has $5.4 trillion under management, traditionally has given few details of its reasoning behind specific proxy votes. On Friday, however, it said it was concerned about Occidental's pace of disclosure to date. It also gave details about its talks with other companies such as Chevron Corp , which BlackRock said has provided more detail on climate risks it faces such as a recent report it published."
Chevron,2017-5,"A Chevron representative said the company would continue speaking with investors, and that it had held ""extensive dialogue with proponents and other stockholders."""
Chevron,2017-5,BlackRock spokesman Ed Sweeney said BlackRock would not explain every vote it casts in such detail but wanted to underscore how it promotes its corporate governance priorities in talks with companies.
Chevron,2017-5,"""We want to highlight our engagement and articulate our voting decisions,"" he said."

Chevron,2017-5,"Major oil companies have long faced shareholder criticism for being slow to respond to climate concerns, though some have moved to mend fences with activists in recent years such as ExxonMobil's decision earlier this year to name a environmental expert to its board."
Chevron,2017-5,"Specifically, the resolution at Occidental - which was also backed by Wespath Investment Management and state pension funds including the California Public Employees' Retirement System - called on the energy company to explain the impact it could face from changes like new public policies on climate change, such as the 2016 Paris climate agreement."
Chevron,2017-5,"BlackRock, Occidental's largest investor with about 8 percent of its shares, last year had opposed a similar resolution, which failed to get a majority of support from investors."
Chevron,2017-5,"In a statement sent by Sweeney explaining the switch, the fund firm said its vote last year was meant to give Occidental time. But despite talks with Occidental, ""we remain concerned about the lack of discernable improvements to the company's reporting practices"" on climate issues, the statement said."
Chevron,2017-5,Last year a similar resolution was narrowly defeated with 249 million votes cast for it and 259 million votes cast against.

Chevron,2017-5,"It plans to add a further three, bringing its total number of pumping stations to 15."
Chevron,2017-5,"Gorban said Kazakhstan's Kashagan oilfield will supply 8 million to 9 million tonnes of oil this year, up from more than 800,000 tonnes in 2016."

Chevron,2017-5,{{20170511T040101.518+0000}}Company climate risk disclosure would distort markets -IHS MarkitBy Nina Chestney
Chevron,2017-5,"LONDON, May 11 (Reuters) - Proposals by a G20-backed task force for companies to disclose how they manage climate risks would mislead investors and distort markets, according to research by analytics and data provider IHS Markit on Thursday."
Chevron,2017-5,"Last year, the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosure (TCFD), set up by the G20's Financial Stability Board, proposed that companies disclose in their public financial findings how they identify and manage risks to their business from climate change. [nL5N1E94RG]"
Chevron,2017-5,"Although the measures are voluntary, some of the task force's members argue they should become mandatory."
Chevron,2017-5,The TCFD was set up due to growing concerns among the financial community that assets are being mispriced because the full extent of climate risk is not being factored in and increased calls for company transparency.
Chevron,2017-5,IHS Markit said some of the TCFD's proposals could help investors better understand how firms manage potential climate risks but others would actually undermine the aim of improving capital allocation decisions and financial market functioning.
Chevron,2017-5,"Climate risk disclosure could lead to unintended consequences, such as investors downgrading other risks which might have similar financial impacts but do not have to be disclosed in the same way, the research said."
Chevron,2017-5,"""The task force's proposals are useful in terms of heightening the discussion around climate risk but eight decades of understanding of the materiality concept would be changed by this initiative,"" Daniel Yergin, IHS Markit vice chairman and co-author of the report, told Reuters."
Chevron,2017-5,"""The use of scenarios and metrics is misleading; there are issues around confidentiality and why should we single out just one risk?"""
Chevron,2017-5,"IHS Markit said its report was financed by oil firms BP , Chevron , ConocoPhillips and Total , which are in one of the sectors most exposed to climate-related financial impacts, but its conclusions were its own."
Chevron,2017-5,"Proposals for disclosing the financial impact of long-term scenarios and using metrics to quantify climate risk could be misleading, the report said."
Chevron,2017-5,"Not only are scenarios based on a large number of assumptions, the assumptions will vary according to different companies and sources and are not comparable, IHS Markit added."
Chevron,2017-5,A TCFD recommendation that oil and gas firms disclose information related to the cost of supply for current and future projects could undermine their competitive positions. Such costs change constantly due to market and technology changes.
Chevron,2017-5,"Companies could also face potential litigation if their future costs do not match the projected costs in their disclosures, the report said."
Chevron,2017-5,"After a public consultation, the TCFD is expected to bring its final recommendations to the G20 at its meeting in Germany in July. The TCFD has 32 members from large banks, insurance companies, asset management companies, pension funds, credit rating agencies and accounting and consulting firms."

Chevron,2017-5,"YPF posted first-quarter profit of 192 million pesos ($12.47 million), down 78 percent from 855 million pesos a year earlier, the company announced on Tuesday. It said total petroleum production for the quarter fell 1.5 percent from a year earlier to 573,500 barrels per day. [nL1N1IB1WG]"
Chevron,2017-5,"""Clearly 2017 is not going to be a strong year in terms of hydrocarbons production,"" Gonzalez told investors on the call."
Chevron,2017-5,"""At this point we are targeting a 3 percent decline in our hydrocarbons production for this year,"" he added."
Chevron,2017-5,The company is seeking partners to develop some of the world's largest shale reserves in the southern Patagonia area of the country. The negative production estimate was due to bad flooding in Chubut province and labor disruptions earlier this year as the government was negotiating a new pact with unions.
Chevron,2017-5,"""We are envisioning (the 3 percent production decline), with some of the conflicts that we went through with the unions, that had to do with structural changes, which I think are a great thing for the long term, and also with negative weather that affected Chubut,"" Gonzalez said."
Chevron,2017-5,Argentina sealed a deal this year with unions and oil companies including Chevron Corp and Royal Dutch Shell Plc to guarantee investments in exchange for greater labor flexibility and wellhead price subsidies. [nL1N1HY290]

Chevron,2017-5,"NEW YORK/MEXICO CITY, May 5 (Reuters) - Sweeping energy reforms have turned Mexico into one of the world's most attractive offshore prospects, but one segment is getting no love from U.S. investors: the nation's aging refineries."
Chevron,2017-5,"Efforts by Mexico's state-owned oil company Pemex to attract about $5 billion in capital to help modernize its two largest refineries so far have proved futile, according to two people familiar with the process who declined to be named because they were not authorized to speak publicly."
Chevron,2017-5,The company is seeking a joint venture partner for its Salina Cruz refinery on the West Coast. It's also looking for an investor to complete construction of a coking unit to process heavy crude at its Tula refinery just north of Mexico's capital.
Chevron,2017-5,"Among those to rebuff overtures from Pemex over the past year are U.S. refining giants Valero Energy Corp and Tesoro Corp , the people said."
Chevron,2017-5,"Valero and Tesoro declined to comment. Those and other companies were deterred by operational, political and market concerns, the people said."
Chevron,2017-5,"Pemex officials said they ""categorically reject"" the notion that they are struggling to find investors."
Chevron,2017-5,"""There has been interest,"" a company spokesman said Thursday. ""We've had talks with many companies whose names we can't reveal."""
Chevron,2017-5,"Pemex has said publicly it's seeking investment from Korean, Japanese and Chinese firms. The company hired Bank of America last year to seek potential partners."
Chevron,2017-5,"The refining sector has contributed buckets of red ink to Pemex's bottom line. Its six domestic refineries have accumulated annual operating losses of about $5 billion in recent years. Government-set fuel prices, a spate of accidents and other non-scheduled stoppages have cut deeply into margins."
Chevron,2017-5,"For years, Pemex prioritized investment in profitable drilling projects, neglecting other areas. As a result, refineries built decades ago to process light, sweet crude from Mexico's shallower waters can't efficiently process heavy oil from fields currently in production."
Chevron,2017-5,"The upshot: Today Mexico imports more than 60 percent of its refined gasoline and diesel from the United States, while its own refineries operate at about half capacity."
Chevron,2017-5,The mismatch would seem a prime business opportunity. Instead Pemex's refineries have become a virtual third rail for investors.
Chevron,2017-5,"Some potential partners are leery of the sums needed to bring the aging facilities up to standard, people familiar with the situation said. Then there's the bloated refinery workforce whose jobs are protected by a strong union. On average, Pemex uses about 3,000 full-time workers to operate each refinery. That's triple the number found at U.S. facilities with similar sized operations, according to figures from Pemex and U.S. refiners."
Chevron,2017-5,"""The refineries aren't competitive. Their product slate doesn't meet the demand of the country,"" said Dave Hackett, an energy consultant at Stillwater Associates in California."
Chevron,2017-5,"Pemex's refineries could be the biggest challenge yet for Jose Antonio Gonzalez Anaya, who was brought in as chief executive last year to lure investment to Mexico's most important company. The oil giant has struggled in recent years with slumping production, falling oil prices and rising debt."
Chevron,2017-5,"Gonzalez Anaya, a polished, American-educated technocrat, has scored some early wins. He oversaw cost cuts of more $5 billion last year and has hustled to attract exploration and production partnerships; the first one covering a deep water Gulf block was inked in February between Pemex, U.S. oil major Chevron and Japan's Inpex <1605.T>."
Chevron,2017-5,"On Wednesday, Pemex reported its first quarterly profit in five years, gaining some $4.7 billion during the January-March period."
Chevron,2017-5,"Overall, the outlook is bullish for Mexico's oil industry. Reforms to Mexico's constitution four years ago ended Pemex's nearly 80-year monopoly and allowed the government-controlled company to form its first-ever equity partnerships. The changes also permitted private oil companies to operate fields on their own. Major oil companies including Exxon Mobil Corp , Total SA and Statoil have snagged offshore leases at auction."
Chevron,2017-5,"Overhauling Mexico's refining sector, however, has proven daunting. Unlike offshore production, where new rigs can be brought in and operators can largely call their own shots, the refineries come with baggage. Potential investors must contend with the existing infrastructure, much of it dating back to the 1970s. Then there are entrenched relationships with local government officials and union leaders."
Chevron,2017-5,"Lowering a massive coking drum into place during an event at the Tula facility last month, Pemex chief Gonzalez Anaya was accompanied, not by foreign investors, but by Carlos Romero Deschamps, head of the powerful oil workers union and a senator with the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, of President Enrique Pena Nieto."
Chevron,2017-5,"If refinery investors ""are forced to follow exactly how Pemex has worked in the past, obviously no one will enter,"" said Carlos Petersen, an analyst covering Latin America for Eurasia Group."
Chevron,2017-5,"Mexico's political climate is another concern. By law, Pena Nieto, who led the oil reform, is limited to a single six-year term that ends next year. The government's decision to open its oil industry to outside producers and sell off some Pemex assets was vehemently opposed by many Mexicans and left-leaning politicians. Among them is Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, a populist who's the current front-runner for the 2018 presidential race."
Chevron,2017-5,"In the meantime, Pemex is moving forward - alone - to finance some of its refining needs. Badly in need of more capacity to process heavy crude, Pemex broke ground in 2013 on the coker project at its Tula refinery."
Chevron,2017-5,"The company will fund half the $2.2-billion cost for the first phase while it seeks partners to help complete the facility, Pemex's top downstream executive Carlos Murrieta told analysts on a conference call earlier this week. He put the final price tag at $4.5 billion and projected the plant would be ready in 2022."
Chevron,2017-5,Houston oil analyst Jake Fuller is dubious that other new Pemex refinery projects will follow anytime soon.
