General Electric,2017-5,"WASHINGTON, May 31 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump talked trade with Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc during a White House visit on Wednesday and welcomed the signing of business deals worth billions of dollars and the jobs they would create."
General Electric,2017-5,"The U.S. Commerce Department announced 13 new transactions with Vietnam worth $8 billion, including $3 billion worth of U.S.-produced content that would support more than 23,000 American jobs."
General Electric,2017-5,"These include deals for General Electric Co worth $5.58 billion for power generation, aircraft engines and services, its largest-ever combined sale in Vietnam.[nL1N1IX17J]"

General Electric,2017-5,"""They (Vietnam) just made a very large order in the United States - and we appreciate that - for many billions of dollars, which means jobs for the United States and great, great equipment for Vietnam,"" Trump told reporters at the White House."
General Electric,2017-5,"The Commerce Department estimate of the deals was considerably less than the $15 billion figure given by Phuc during a speech at the Heritage Foundation, adding that most of the total involved the import of U.S. equipment."
General Electric,2017-5,"Communist Vietnam has gone from being a Cold War enemy to an important partner for the United States in the Asia-Pacific, where both countries share concerns about China's rising power."
General Electric,2017-5,"Phuc told Trump the relationship had undergone ""significant upheavals in history"" but that the two countries were now ""comprehensive partners."""
General Electric,2017-5,Phuc's meeting with Trump makes him the first Southeast Asian leader to visit the White House under the new administration.
General Electric,2017-5,"However, while Hanoi and Washington have stepped up security cooperation in recent years, trade has become a potential irritant, with a deficit widening steadily in Vietnam's favor, reaching $32 billion last year, compared with $7 billion a decade earlier."
General Electric,2017-5,"Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said it was important to shrink the U.S. trade deficit with Vietnam but noted that the southeast Asian country of 80 million people was the fastest-growing market for U.S. exports, rising 77 percent since 2014 to $4.4 billion."
General Electric,2017-5,"""The growth of the middle class and the increasing purchasing power in Vietnam are further incentives to strengthening our long-term trade and investment relationship,"" Ross said."
General Electric,2017-5,"Trump, who has had strong words for countries with large trade surpluses with the United States, said he would be discussing trade with Phuc, as well as North Korea."
General Electric,2017-5,"Washington has been seeking support to pressure North Korea to drop its nuclear and missile programs, which have become an increasing threat to the United States. Hanoi has said it shares concerns about North Korea. [nL1N1I61WZ]"
General Electric,2017-5,"In his Heritage speech, Phuc welcomed Trump's plans to attend the November APEC summit in Hanoi. He called it a sign of U.S. commitment to the region and ""an important occasion for the United States to assert its positive role."""
General Electric,2017-5,"In a reference to somewhat warmer ties between Washington and Beijing under Trump, who has been courting China's support on North Korea, Phuc said Vietnam welcomed good relations between the two powers, but hoped these would serve the interest of other nations in the region too."
General Electric,2017-5,"He urged Washington and Beijing ""to act with full transparency and in a responsible manner so as not to impact negatively the region and relations among other nations."""
General Electric,2017-5,"Vietnam's government said on its website Trump and Phuc had agreed to promote defense ties and discussed the possibility of U.S. vessels, including aircraft carriers, visiting Vietnamese ports."

General Electric,2017-5,"Murray Hiebert, a Southeast Asia expert at Washington's Center for Strategic and International Studies, said that while the Trump administration welcomed new business deals with Vietnam, its view was they were ""nice, but not enough."""
General Electric,2017-5,"""They want Vietnam to bring some ideas about how to tackle the surplus on an ongoing basis,"" he said."
General Electric,2017-5,"On Tuesday, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer expressed concern about the rapid growth of the deficit with Vietnam. He said it was a new challenge for the two countries and he was looking to Phuc to help address it. [nL1N1IX010]"
General Electric,2017-5,"The deficit is Washington's sixth largest and reflects growing imports of Vietnamese semiconductors and other electronics products in addition to more traditional sectors such as footwear, apparel and furniture."
General Electric,2017-5,"On Tuesday Vietnam's trade minister, Tran Tuan Anh, presented Lighthizer with suggestions to address some U.S. concerns, such as advertising on U.S. social media, electronic payment services and imports of information security and farm products, Vietnam's trade ministry said."

General Electric,2017-5,"BUDAPEST, May 24 (Reuters) - Russian nuclear group Rosatom unit JSC Atomstroyexport will soon issue the first major international tender for steam turbines at Hungary's new nuclear power plant, a top Hungarian government official said on Wednesday."
General Electric,2017-5,"Hungary signed a deal with Russia to build two Russian VVER 1200 reactors for 12.5 billion euros ($13.97 billion), with 80 percent funded by a Russian loan and 20 percent by Hungary, which will own the plant in Paks, 100 km (60 miles) south of Budapest."
General Electric,2017-5,Environmental groups and Hungary's opposition criticised the government for what they said was the opaque way the contract was issued to Russia's state-owned nuclear giant in 2014.
General Electric,2017-5,"After clearing a European Union probe on potential illegal state aid in March, construction work could begin in early 2018, Attila Aszodi, nominated as state secretary for the project, told the Reuters Central & Eastern Europe Investment Summit."
General Electric,2017-5,"This preparation phase could cost 600-900 million euros over 12 months, he said, adding main costs would be incurred between 2021 and 2024 when the main reactor sites were built and machinery installed."
General Electric,2017-5,"""I believe that in two years from now, if all conditions are right, then... the nuclear construction can begin,"" Aszodi said."
General Electric,2017-5,"He said the first major international tender for the steam turbines could be issued ""very soon"", without giving a date."
General Electric,2017-5,"""The Russian partner is committed to making this an international project,"" he said, adding that the turbine tender was expected to attract two or three bidders but other tenders would draw more interest."
General Electric,2017-5,"Based on a similar project in Finland, General Electric Alstom, Siemens and Toshiba could bid to manufacture turbines, he said."
General Electric,2017-5,"Hungary's Paks plant currently has four Russian-built VVER 440 reactors with a combined capacity of about 2,000 megawatts (MW), which will be decommissioned by 2037."

General Electric,2017-5,"CLEVELAND, May 18 (Reuters) - Hanging on the wall of David Shippoli's office at a sprawling factory here is his company's annual scavenger award, a stuffed hyena head, given to the employee who finds the cheapest way to execute an investment project in the past year."
General Electric,2017-5,"Shippoli, a manufacturing engineer at Dan T. Moore Co., a privately-held company which operates nine factories across Ohio and Indiana, won the prize for finding used machines that were a fraction of the cost of buying them new."
General Electric,2017-5,"He is a fan of President Donald Trump's policies and even propped a bright red ""Make America Great Again"" hat on the hyena during the campaign. But Shippoli embodies a mindset that exists across industrial America that will make it hard to boost business investment, even if the corporate tax breaks floated recently by the Trump administration come through."
General Electric,2017-5,"""I don't know why anyone would buy new equipment when there's so much stuff out there that's perfectly capable of doing the job,"" he said."
General Electric,2017-5,"Many U.S. companies emerged from the last recession extremely wary of spending on buildings and expensive new equipment, unless it was sure the returns would justify it."
General Electric,2017-5,Trump Administration officials forecast torrid economic growth on the back of the windfall U.S. companies would get if Trump's plan to cut corporate tax rates and slash taxes on cash parked overseas became law. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and White House economic advisor Gary Cohn met on Wednesday with the full Senate Finance Committee about the administration's framework for tax reform.
General Electric,2017-5,CEOs certainly are enthusiastic about the prospect of tax reform. A recent survey by the Business Roundtable - a group representing major U.S. corporations - found more than eight out of ten said they thought tax reform would prompt companies to boost capital spending. Seventy-six percent said it would fuel hiring.
General Electric,2017-5,And some companies such as General Electric Co are making big bets that new digital systems will improve efficiency on factory floors. [nL1N1I41F9]
General Electric,2017-5,But it is unclear how they would use the extra cash if it doesn't lead to a jump in economic growth. Previous tax holidays aimed at getting companies to repatriate foreign savings have done little to boost investment in the U.S.
General Electric,2017-5,"""Nobody builds a new factory unless they need the capacity"" and tax breaks won't change that, said Susan Helper, an economist at Case Western Reserve University, who has studied how companies curbed their spending habits in recent years."
General Electric,2017-5,"She notes that U.S. companies are sitting on plenty of cash - $1.8 trillion, according to Moody's Investors Service - so it is not that they lack resources, she says. What is missing is the kind of business opportunities that justify the spending."
General Electric,2017-5,It's not just smaller companies and startups that appreciate age in some industrial machines.
General Electric,2017-5,"Across town, for instance, at Arconic Inc's sprawling Cleveland Works, workers still use a 1930s metal press confiscated from Germany after World War II to stamp out aluminum parts. Arconic, based in New York, was created last year when Alcoa Inc split in two - creating Alcoa Corp and Arconic, which took the downstream aluminum processing business."
General Electric,2017-5,"Arconic has plenty of other vintage machines, including an even larger 50,000 ton press in Cleveland built in the 1950s, which it recently spent $100 million completely renovating. The update included fixing metal parts that had begun to crack as well as new controls that made it more precise."
General Electric,2017-5,"""You have to be frugal to survive,"" said Steve Peplin, CEO of privately held Talan Products Inc., which sells about $40 million in building materials each year. When he needed a new press recently, he bought an used machine and sent it to a company that specializes in modernizing such equipment."
General Electric,2017-5,"""It was literally rebuilt,"" he said. ""It got new high-efficiency motors and all computer controls."" The reason to go down that road was simple: The whole project cost about $1.5 million versus the $2.5 million he was quoted to buy a new machine."
General Electric,2017-5,"The big coup last year for Dan T. Moore's Shippoli was buying used machines from a factory in California that is allowing him to set up a new production line for $140,000 instead of the $3 million it would have cost new. The line will produce an insulated material the company forms into different shapes and aims to sell to carmakers and other large manufacturers."
General Electric,2017-5,"Case Western's Helper said there's ""good thrift and bad thrift."" If companies refuse to invest in new capabilities or processes, that is bad because it holds back productivity gains. Good thrift, by contrast, is the growing recognition that existing industrial machines are often good enough to get the job done, so splurging on new equipment isn't necessary."
General Electric,2017-5,"Dan Moore, the CEO of Shippoli's company, has made the former approach almost a cult at his operations."
General Electric,2017-5,"One of his favorite sayings is that ""steel doesn't know how old it is,"" meaning the basic components of many industrial machines remain useful for decades. The company will typically invest in new computer controls and other components to update the machines it buys. Not only does Moore reward people who find ways to use old machines to meet new needs, he has been known to demote managers who throw away machines that could be salvaged."
General Electric,2017-5,"One recent day, he led the way through one of his favorite places: HGR Industrial Surplus, a sprawling warehouse that sells old machines on the gritty industrial east side of Cleveland."
General Electric,2017-5,"""This is one of the secrets of how you can create new businesses in Cleveland,"" he said, walking past rows of hydraulic presses, some still smudged with oil from their previous life in a now-defunct factory."
General Electric,2017-5,"It makes sense to use old machines to get new operations off the ground, because it minimizes the risk if the business doesn't take off, according to Moore."
General Electric,2017-5,"For Windsor Ford, the company's vice-president of acquisitions, the idea of pitching a project to his CEO that involves buying new equipment isn't unheard of, but it's ""terrifying."""

General Electric,2017-5,"The deals with top U.S. companies such as oilfield services firms Schlumberger , Halliburton , Baker Hughes , and Weatherford are part of the oil giant's push to develop local manufacturing, the sources said."
General Electric,2017-5,"Aramco will also sign deals with General Electric (GE) and drilling companies National Oilwell Varco (NOV), Nabors Industries and Rowan Companies , among others, they added."
General Electric,2017-5,"When it launched its In-Kingdom Total Value Add programme (IKTVA) in 2015, Aramco said it aimed to double the percentage of locally-produced energy-related goods and services to 70 percent by 2021"
General Electric,2017-5,U.S. companies have traditionally worked with Aramco on massive projects covering consultancy and project management services to maintaining oil potential in upstream projects and drilling to building refineries.
General Electric,2017-5,"""These (new) partnerships will boost bilateral investment towards localisation,"" said one of the sources."

General Electric,2017-5,"CLEVELAND, May 18 (Reuters) - Hanging on the wall of David Shippoli's office at a sprawling factory here is his company's annual scavenger award, a stuffed hyena head, given to the employee who finds the cheapest way to execute an investment project in the past year."
General Electric,2017-5,"Shippoli, a manufacturing engineer at Dan T. Moore Co., a privately-held company which operates nine factories across Ohio and Indiana, won the prize for finding used machines that were a fraction of the cost of buying them new."
General Electric,2017-5,"He is a fan of President Donald Trump's policies and even propped a bright red ""Make America Great Again"" hat on the hyena during the campaign. But Shippoli embodies a mindset that exists across industrial America that will make it hard to boost business investment, even if the corporate tax breaks floated recently by the Trump administration come through."
General Electric,2017-5,"""I don't know why anyone would buy new equipment when there's so much stuff out there that's perfectly capable of doing the job,"" he said."
General Electric,2017-5,"Many U.S. companies emerged from the last recession extremely wary of spending on buildings and expensive new equipment, unless it was sure the returns would justify it."
General Electric,2017-5,Trump Administration officials forecast torrid economic growth on the back of the windfall U.S. companies would get if Trump's plan to cut corporate tax rates and slash taxes on cash parked overseas became law. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and White House economic advisor Gary Cohn met on Wednesday with the full Senate Finance Committee about the administration's framework for tax reform.
General Electric,2017-5,CEOs certainly are enthusiastic about the prospect of tax reform. A recent survey by the Business Roundtable - a group representing major U.S. corporations - found more than eight out of ten said they thought tax reform would prompt companies to boost capital spending. Seventy-six percent said it would fuel hiring.
General Electric,2017-5,And some companies such as General Electric Co are making big bets that new digital systems will improve efficiency on factory floors. [nL1N1I41F9]
General Electric,2017-5,But it is unclear how they would use the extra cash if it doesn't lead to a jump in economic growth. Previous tax holidays aimed at getting companies to repatriate foreign savings have done little to boost investment in the U.S.
General Electric,2017-5,"""Nobody builds a new factory unless they need the capacity"" and tax breaks won't change that, said Susan Helper, an economist at Case Western Reserve University, who has studied how companies curbed their spending habits in recent years."
General Electric,2017-5,"She notes that U.S. companies are sitting on plenty of cash - $1.8 trillion, according to Moody's Investors Service - so it is not that they lack resources, she says. What is missing is the kind of business opportunities that justify the spending."
General Electric,2017-5,It's not just smaller companies and startups that appreciate age in some industrial machines.
General Electric,2017-5,"Across town, for instance, at Arconic Inc's sprawling Cleveland Works, workers still use a 1930s metal press confiscated from Germany after World War II to stamp out aluminum parts. Arconic, based in New York, was created last year when Alcoa Inc split in two - creating Alcoa Corp and Arconic, which took the downstream aluminum processing business."
General Electric,2017-5,"Arconic has plenty of other vintage machines, including an even larger 50-ton press in Cleveland built in the 1950s, which it recently spent $100 million completely renovating. The update included fixing metal parts that had begun to crack as well as new controls that made it more precise."
General Electric,2017-5,"""You have to be frugal to survive,"" said Steve Peplin, CEO of privately held Talan Products Inc., which sells about $40 million in building materials each year. When he needed a new press recently, he bought an used machine and sent it to a company that specializes in modernizing such equipment."
General Electric,2017-5,"""It was literally rebuilt,"" he said. ""It got new high-efficiency motors and all computer controls."" The reason to go down that road was simple: The whole project cost about $1.5 million versus the $2.5 million he was quoted to buy a new machine."
General Electric,2017-5,"The big coup last year for Dan T. Moore's Shippoli was buying used machines from a factory in California that is allowing him to set up a new production line for $140,000 instead of the $3 million it would have cost new. The line will produce an insulated material the company forms into different shapes and aims to sell to carmakers and other large manufacturers."
General Electric,2017-5,"Case Western's Helper said there's ""good thrift and bad thrift."" If companies refuse to invest in new capabilities or processes, that is bad because it holds back productivity gains. Good thrift, by contrast, is the growing recognition that existing industrial machines are often good enough to get the job done, so splurging on new equipment isn't necessary."
General Electric,2017-5,"Dan Moore, the CEO of Shippoli's company, has made the former approach almost a cult at his operations."
General Electric,2017-5,"One of his favorite sayings is that ""steel doesn't know how old it is,"" meaning the basic components of many industrial machines remain useful for decades. The company will typically invest in new computer controls and other components to update the machines it buys. Not only does Moore reward people who find ways to use old machines to meet new needs, he has been known to demote managers who throw away machines that could be salvaged."
General Electric,2017-5,"One recent day, he led the way through one of his favorite places: HGR Industrial Surplus, a sprawling warehouse that sells old machines on the gritty industrial east side of Cleveland."
General Electric,2017-5,"""This is one of the secrets of how you can create new businesses in Cleveland,"" he said, walking past rows of hydraulic presses, some still smudged with oil from their previous life in a now-defunct factory."
General Electric,2017-5,"It makes sense to use old machines to get new operations off the ground, because it minimizes the risk if the business doesn't take off, according to Moore."
General Electric,2017-5,"For Windsor Ford, the company's vice-president of acquisitions, the idea of pitching a project to his CEO that involves buying new equipment isn't unheard of, but it's ""terrifying."""
General Electric,2017-5,"""All I can say is you better have data to back it up,"" he said."

General Electric,2017-5,{{20170515T100001.886+0000}}U.S. companies push hard for lower tax rate on offshore profitsBy Ginger Gibson
General Electric,2017-5,"WASHINGTON, May 15 (Reuters) - Major U.S. multinationals are pushing the Trump administration to deepen the tax break it has already tentatively proposed on $2.6 trillion in corporate profits being held offshore, a key piece in Washington's intricate tax reform puzzle."
General Electric,2017-5,"As President Donald Trump tries to deliver on his campaign promise to overhaul the tax code, lobbyists for technology, drug and other manufacturers are working with officials behind closed doors, six lobbyists working with various industries told Reuters."
General Electric,2017-5,"In line with tax cuts already embraced by Republicans in the House of Representatives, the lobbyists said they are telling the White House and Treasury Department that if companies are forced to bring home, or repatriate, foreign earnings, they want a sharply reduced tax rate."
General Electric,2017-5,"The lobbyists are making an aggressive case that cutting the tax rate on offshore profits to 10 percent from 35 percent, as the administration has indicated it may favor, is not enough."
General Electric,2017-5,"Rather, the lobbyists said they want a lower, bifurcated rate of 3.5 percent on earnings already invested abroad in illiquid assets, such as factories, and 8.75 percent on cash and liquid assets."
General Electric,2017-5,"During the 2016 presidential campaign, Trump proposed setting the rate at 10 percent, and argued it could be used to raise tax revenue to pay for tax cuts or infrastructure."
General Electric,2017-5,"Discussion of hard numbers in the long-running repatriation debate may indicate tax reform is advancing on Trump's slow-moving domestic policy agenda. Or it may just be lobbyists trying to set the early framework for a long slog ahead, which could be adjusted if they get concessions elsewhere."
General Electric,2017-5,"""For us, it's how you create a tax environment where you give business long-term certainty,"" one lobbyist said."
General Electric,2017-5,"The changes being discussed are part of larger tax reform, another lobbyist said: ""Our international tax system is out of whack with the rest of the world. This system is not sustainable."""
General Electric,2017-5,"The lobbyists' demands represent the latest effort in a push by corporate America that has been under way since 2004-2005, the last time Washington let multinationals pay only a small fraction of the taxes due on their foreign profits."
General Electric,2017-5,"Repatriation and comprehensive tax reform are important to the economy, Apple Inc CEO Tim Cook said earlier this month on CNBC. ""The administration ... they're really getting this and want to bring this back and I hope that that comes to pass,"" he said. Apple held $239.6 billion of cash and securities offshore as of April 1."
General Electric,2017-5,"Under current law, U.S.-based corporations are supposed to pay 35-percent income tax on profits worldwide. But companies can defer that tax on active profits left outside the country."
General Electric,2017-5,"The deferral rule has incentivized multinationals to park profits offshore and about $2.6 trillion in earnings is being held overseas by more than 500 U.S. companies, according to Audit Analytics, a corporate research firm."
General Electric,2017-5,"Nearly a third of that is held by 10 companies, including Apple, Microsoft Corp , Pfizer Inc and General Electric Co , the firm said. All four of those companies declined to comment."
General Electric,2017-5,"These companies and hundreds of others could bring their foreign profits into the United States at any time, but they do not in order to avoid paying the 35-percent tax due."
General Electric,2017-5,"If the $2.6 trillion overseas were repatriated at once, two things would happen. First, Washington would get a big jolt of tax revenue. Second, repatriated profits not collected by the Internal Revenue Service could be put to use in the economy."
General Electric,2017-5,"As the law stands, tax-deferred profits can be held offshore indefinitely. The result of that has been companies biding their time, claiming their profits are ""trapped"" offshore while lobbying for a repatriation tax cut. The last time they got one was in 2004-2005 under former President George W. Bush, whose administration let multinationals voluntarily repatriate profits at a 5.25 percent tax rate."
General Electric,2017-5,"At the time, Bush tried to extract promises from companies that they would dedicate repatriated funds to investments in new plants and other job-creating projects."
General Electric,2017-5,"But in a 2011 follow-up study, a Senate committee concluded the Bush repatriation tax ""holiday"" cost the Treasury at least $3.3 billion in net revenue over 10 years and ""produced no appreciable increase in U.S. jobs or domestic investment."""
General Electric,2017-5,"Rather, the repatriated funds largely went to shareholder dividends and executive bonuses, the committee said."
General Electric,2017-5,"The repatriation tax break now being discussed differs from Bush's: repatriation would not be voluntary, but mandatory, so foreign profits would have to be brought home."
General Electric,2017-5,"In addition, lobbyists said they have talked to the administration about ending deferral and exempting foreign profits from taxation. The administration has floated this as an option. Lobbyists said there has been discussion about limiting that exemption to 95 percent of repatriated foreign earnings."

General Electric,2017-5,"MELBOURNE, May 15 (Reuters) - Australia's soaring natural gas prices are driving up power tariffs on the world's smallest continent, boosting prospects for China's biggest wind turbine maker, which is already set to buy the biggest wind farm project in the southern hemisphere."
General Electric,2017-5,"Goldwind Australia - the local unit of Xinjiang Goldwind Science & Technology Co <002202.SZ> - beat at least 10 rivals for the purchase of the site and permits to build the 530 megawatt (MW) Stockyard Hill project, sold last week by Origin Energy for A$110 million ($81 million)."
General Electric,2017-5,"Goldwind Australia's managing director, John Titchen, declined to say how much the whole project would cost, but he expects it to take around two years to build. The Chinese company has said it would spend a further A$335 million and borrow more funds on top of that to complete the wind farm."
General Electric,2017-5,"Origin will buy all of the electricity generated from the Victoria state project - enough to power 400,000 homes - and the associated renewable energy certificates for a record low price in Australia of less than A$60 per megawatt hour (Mwh)."
General Electric,2017-5,"The price was achievable thanks to the scale of the wind farm, the capacity of Goldwind's new turbines and the location, Titchen said in an interview."
General Electric,2017-5,"""It's the biggest wind farm in Australia, so it's at the most attractive end of the spectrum,"" he told Reuters."
General Electric,2017-5,"The power price is well below a deal by Origin's rival AGL Energy , which in January agreed to buy all the electricity from another, smaller wind farm for A$65 per Mwh."
General Electric,2017-5,"While costs are coming down for wind and solar power relative to coal, Titchen said a key factor that has made renewable energy more competitive in Australia is a sharp rise in natural gas prices."
General Electric,2017-5,"""The tightening of the gas market, the high prices of gas, have had some significant impact on (electricity) market prices,"" Titchen said."
General Electric,2017-5,"Average wholesale power prices in the state of Victoria have doubled over the past two years to more than A$60/Mwh, while prices in neighbouring New South Wales have soared from A$35 to around A$80 over the same period."
General Electric,2017-5,"""That's made it clear that renewable energy contributions will help in terms of providing competitive cost of supply for Australian customers,"" Titchen said."
General Electric,2017-5,"Goldwind, the world's third-largest wind turbine maker behind Denmark's Vestas Wind Systems and General Electric Co in 2016, already runs two wind farms in Australia and is set to start a third next month."
General Electric,2017-5,"It has plans for three other projects in Australia besides Stockyard Hill, and is working on adding solar power at two of its wind farms to get more value out of infrastructure such grid connections, Titchen said."

General Electric,2017-5,"May 12 (Reuters) - Boeing Co said on Friday it resumed test flights of its $110-million 737 MAX 8 jetliner, just two days after saying it had grounded the entire fleet to address an engine problem."
General Electric,2017-5,"The resumption of flights, which the plane maker said was backed by air safety regulators, is good news for Boeing and engine-maker CFM International, a joint venture between General Electric Co and Safran SA of France."
General Electric,2017-5,CFM had said flaws in the forging of a disc inside the engine could have led to cracks.
General Electric,2017-5,"Boeing grounded the fleet late last week, and announced it on Wednesday, just days before it planned to deliver its first 737 MAX 8 to an airline."
General Electric,2017-5,Inability to fly the plane could have threatened Boeing's ability to deliver the new jetliners on time.
General Electric,2017-5,The company said a 737 MAX 8 took off around 12:15 pm Pacific Time on Friday.
General Electric,2017-5,Boeing spokesman Doug Alder said regulators supported the resumption of flights.
General Electric,2017-5,"""Our plan remains to start deliveries this month,"" he said, noting the flights are with planes that do not have the suspect discs."
General Electric,2017-5,Alder declined to say when the inspection and possible repair of any engines with the suspect discs would be complete.

General Electric,2017-5,"Alder also declined to estimate the potential cost, or say whether any faulty discs had been found so far."

General Electric,2017-5,"MONTERREY, Mexico, May 12 (Reuters) - General Electric on Friday praised Mexico as a big part of its future and said the company is ""very supportive"" of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) that U.S President Donald Trump has threatened to ditch."
General Electric,2017-5,"GE Chief Executive Officer Jeff Immelt said on a visit that Mexico had great potential and was not properly understood. He touted the conglomerate's Mexican operations and the trade deal binding Mexico, Canada and the United States."
General Electric,2017-5,"""GE as a company, we're very supportive of NAFTA,"" Immelt told employees at an event to mark the expansion of operations in the northern city of Monterrey. He said the trade accord could be modernized, as Mexico has argued."
General Electric,2017-5,Immelt sits on a Trump-appointed manufacturing council that Mexico has targeted for lobbying as Mexico and Canada push U.S. business leaders to defend NAFTA.
General Electric,2017-5,"The GE boss said trade meant ""win-win"" opportunities across North America. [nL1N1I602N]"
General Electric,2017-5,"""We will continue to work constructively in the context of wanting to see a close relationship between the U.S. and Mexico,"" he said, noting that GE's exports to the rest of the world from Mexico were worth $3 billion."
General Electric,2017-5,"""We're optimistic about Mexico, we're optimistic about what we can do here,"" Immelt added, saying Latin America's no. 2 economy would be a ""big part"" of GE's future."
General Electric,2017-5,"Earlier this month, Immelt urged the Trump administration to avoid protectionist policies, calling on it to level the playing field for U.S. companies with tax reform, revived export financing and improved trade agreements. [nL1N1I701C]"
General Electric,2017-5,"Trump touts a ""Buy American"" policy and has railed against U.S. companies moving operations to Mexico. He has threatened to ditch NAFTA, a lynchpin of the Mexican economy, if he cannot rework it to secure better terms for the United States."
General Electric,2017-5,"Unlike some U.S. companies, GE has not backed off plans in Mexico, risking broadsides from Trump on Twitter."
General Electric,2017-5,"Earlier, the Mexican presidency said in a statement that GE had stated an interest in doubling purchases from Mexican suppliers next year. Immelt did not mention this."
General Electric,2017-5,"Vladimiro de la Mora, CEO for Mexico, said the figure came from an announcement last year and did not mean GE aimed to double purchases between this year and 2018."

General Electric,2017-5,"May 12 (Reuters) - Boeing Co said on Friday it resumed test flights of its $110-million 737 MAX 8 jetliner, just two days after saying it had grounded the entire fleet to address an engine problem."
General Electric,2017-5,"The resumption of flights, which the plane maker said was backed by air safety regulators, is good news for Boeing and engine-maker CFM International, a joint venture between General Electric Co and Safran SA of France."
General Electric,2017-5,CFM had said flaws in the forging of a disc inside the engine could have led to cracks.
General Electric,2017-5,"Boeing grounded the fleet late last week, and announced it on Wednesday, just days before it planned to deliver its first 737 MAX 8 to an airline."
General Electric,2017-5,Inability to fly the plane could have threatened Boeing's ability to deliver the new jetliners on time.
General Electric,2017-5,The company said a 737 MAX 8 took off around 12:15 pm Pacific Time on Friday.
General Electric,2017-5,Boeing spokesman Doug Alder said regulators supported the resumption of flights.
General Electric,2017-5,"""Our plan remains to start deliveries this month,"" he said, noting the flights are with planes that do not have the suspect discs."
General Electric,2017-5,Alder declined to say when the inspection and possible repair of any engines with the suspect discs would be complete.
General Electric,2017-5,"The engines, known as the LEAP-1B, were being shipped back to plants in Lafayette, Indiana, and Villeroche, France, for inspection."
General Electric,2017-5,"Safran Aircraft Engines Chief Executive Olivier Andries told reporters on Thursday that the company hoped to fix the problem ""within a few weeks."""
General Electric,2017-5,"Alder also declined to estimate the potential cost, or say whether any faulty discs had been found so far."
General Electric,2017-5,"The problem stemmed from a forging issue noticed on low-pressure turbine discs after they were sent to CFM from a supplier. A second supplier had stepped up production, CFM said."
General Electric,2017-5,"Andries said on Thursday that CFM still hoped to deliver as many as 500 LEAP engines this year, including variants used by Airbus And China's COMAC."

General Electric,2017-5,"SEATTLE, May 10 (Reuters) - Boeing Co said on Wednesday it had temporarily halted test flights of its new 737 MAX aircraft due to an issue with the engine, which is jointly made by General Electric Co and Safran SA of France."
General Electric,2017-5,The grounding comes days before Boeing was due to deliver its first 737 MAX to an airline and marks a high-profile delay in a program that Boeing had said was ahead of schedule.
General Electric,2017-5,It poses no safety concerns for travelers because no airlines are yet flying the 737 MAX but it could mean a costly disruption if the problem persists. Timely delivery is important to planemakers as they get most of the payment for a plane when it is handed to the buyer.
General Electric,2017-5,Boeing and engine maker CFM said they do not know how long the delay will last.
General Electric,2017-5,Boeing shares fell 1.3 percent to $183.15 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. GE shares were down 0.9 percent at $28.67.
General Electric,2017-5,"The 737 MAX replaces an older version of Boeing's best-selling single-aisle aircraft, a key moneymaker for the aerospace company. The 737 MAX 8, the first version of the plane to be built, seats 162 passengers in a typical two-class configuration. It carries a list price of $110 million but airlines typically receive steep discounts."
General Electric,2017-5,"A delay in getting aircraft to customers likely would cause a build up in Boeing's inventory, ""as planes essentially sit waiting for engines,"" said analyst Rob Stallard at Vertical Research Partners."
General Electric,2017-5,"""Investors are acutely focused"" on the risks of speeding up production of the new engine, known as the LEAP-1B, he said."
General Electric,2017-5,"Separately, Airbus said it was continuing flights with its A320neo, which is powered by the similar LEAP-1A engine and is flying customers. [nL8N1IC89K]"
General Electric,2017-5,"The 737 MAX grounding likely will mean a delay for Malindo Air, a Malaysian carrier that had been expected to receive the first 737 MAX delivery as early as Monday. Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA , which was due to receive its first 737 MAX near the end of May, said it expected a ""a few days' delay."""
General Electric,2017-5,"""This will, however, not delay the launch of our upcoming trans-Atlantic routes from the United States to Edinburgh,"" spokesman Anders Lindstrom said in an email."
General Electric,2017-5,"Southwest Airlines Co , the initial customer for the 737 MAX, said Boeing had not warned it of any delays to its delivery schedule. Southwest is expected to begin receiving the jet later in the year after it retires some older 737s."
General Electric,2017-5,"American Airlines Group Inc , which has 100 737 MAX jets on order, declined to comment."
General Electric,2017-5,"The issue arose late last week when Safran found a quality problem in a large metal disc used in the low-pressure turbine at the rear of the engine, said Jamie Jewell, a spokesman for the engine maker, CFM International."
General Electric,2017-5,"CFM notified Boeing, which immediately grounded the fleet of about 21 planes. GE spokesman Rick Kennedy said the disc that prompted the concern had not been installed in an engine."
General Electric,2017-5,"""There have been no issues whatsoever with engines in the field,"" Jewell said."

General Electric,2017-5,The halo effect of Warren Buffett purchases isn't surprising given his record of outperforming the market. The airline sector rose 3 percent in February on news Berkshire had bought shares in four big airlines. News of an investment in Kinder Morgan sent the pipeline firm's stock up 10 percent last year.
General Electric,2017-5,"The Buffett effect is most noticeable, and valuable, in times of crisis. During the worst of the stock-market meltdown in 2008, Berkshire made investments on advantageous terms in companies including Goldman Sachs, General Electric, Swiss Re and Harley Davidson. Those purchases not only provided the firms with desperately needed cash, they fostered confidence that enabled the companies to tap capital markets."
General Electric,2017-5,"Yet withdrawal of the halo can hurt. News that Berkshire had sold a third of its IBM stake vaporized about $4.5 billion of that company's market value. After 20 straight quarters of revenue declines, the stock is trading below Berkshire's cost basis. Buffett's greater pain is the opportunity cost of missed chances. The S&P 500 has risen about 80 percent since his initial IBM investment."

General Electric,2017-5,"LONDON, May 4 (Reuters Breakingviews) - A company's share price usually reflects hopes for the future. Investors' views of Siemens , however, are clouded by its troubled past. For decades, the German engineering group displayed subpar profitability and a talent for botching large-scale projects. The consequence is a persistent discount to historically better-performing peers like GE and ABB ."
General Electric,2017-5,"Kaeser has cut red tape, hived off non-core businesses like consumer appliances and invested heavily in fast-growing, margin-rich software operations. Most importantly, he has ended the streak of one-off charges by overhauling Siemens' project management and appointing 100 managers who constantly assess and monitor risks attached to big-ticket orders."
General Electric,2017-5,"The approach is working. The first three months of 2017 marked the sixth consecutive quarter without any nasty surprises. Since 2013, the group's operating margin is up by a fifth and earnings per share have risen by a third. Analysts polled by Reuters expect the group's operating margin to widen by another 2 percentage points to more than 11 percent by 2019. The impending partial spin-off of Siemens' healthcare business should also help to reduce its conglomerate discount."
General Electric,2017-5,"All this is only partly reflected in Siemens' share price. Under Kaeser the company has produced a total shareholder return of close to 80 percent, well ahead of 34 percent at GE and 28 percent at ABB. Yet this mainly reflects improved earnings. Siemens' valuation discount to its peers remains a stubborn 9 percent. It's time for shareholders to start looking ahead."
General Electric,2017-5,"- Siemens on May 4 reported better-than-expected results for the three months to March. Orders rose 1 percent to 22.6 billion euros ($24.6 billion) compared with the same period in 2016, while revenue was up 5 percent at 20.2 billion euros."
General Electric,2017-5,"- Industrial business profit increased 18 percent year-on-year to 2.49 billion euros, giving Siemens a profit margin of 12.1 percent."
General Electric,2017-5,- Six of the industrial group's eight business units exceeded profit forecasts from analysts polled by Reuters. Siemens reiterated its guidance for the full year. It expects modest revenue growth and industrial profit margin of between 11 percent and 12 percent.
General Electric,2017-5,- Siemens shares were down 1 percent to 131.05 euros by 0906 BST on May 4.

General Electric,2017-5,* Says UK agency also willing to back some Boeing sales to Iran
General Electric,2017-5,"PARIS, May 4 (Reuters) - Iran is in talks with Britain's export credit agency to facilitate the financing of aircraft sales to state airline IranAir as part of its pact with world powers to lift sanctions over its nuclear programme, a senior Iranian official said."
General Electric,2017-5,IranAir's plan to buy more than 180 jets from Airbus [AIR.PA] and Boeing is the most visible economic deal on the table after major powers last year lifted most sanctions on Iran in return for restrictions on its nuclear activities.
General Electric,2017-5,"But financing for the purchases has been hard to secure because most Western banks are holding back, concerned about the future of the 2015 agreement after U.S. President Donald Trump called it a bad deal and ordered a review."
General Electric,2017-5,"So far, IranAir has taken delivery of just three Airbus jets, for which it paid cash, industry sources say."
General Electric,2017-5,"Deputy Roads and Urban Development Minister Asghar Fakhrieh-Kashan said the UK's export credit arm, UK Export Finance (UKEF), had tentatively offered support for least some Airbus jets built in Britain, France, Germany and Spain. It could also offer some support to Airbus's U.S. rival, Boeing, he added."
General Electric,2017-5,"""We have received some offers from UKEF, that is under review by Iran,"" Fakhrieh-Kashan told Reuters."
General Electric,2017-5,Two aircraft industry sources who asked not to be named also confirmed talks were taking place.
General Electric,2017-5,Countries in parts of the world where banks won't invest often turn to European and U.S. governments for export credits or loan insurance when they want to buy big-ticket items like aircraft from those countries' companies.
General Electric,2017-5,"About 6 percent of aircraft deliveries depend on such support, which removes some but not all of the risks banks face in lending to airlines with poor credit, helping to grease the wheels of trade."
General Electric,2017-5,"This fallback system has been frozen for more than a year, however, as European agencies demand more controls after Airbus acknowledged making faulty applications for UK aid, triggering a fraud probe, and UKEF's equivalent in Washington, the Export-Import Bank (EXIM), faced a battle over its future."
General Electric,2017-5,"U.S. President Donald Trump hinted in his campaign he might get rid of the EXIM Bank, which some conservative members of Congress have argued perpetuates cronyism. He has since talked up the benefits of exports for U.S. jobs and in April nominated a new bank president and a member of the board. [nL8N1HM1JZ]"
General Electric,2017-5,Speeding up aircraft deliveries is seen as a priority for Tehran as President Hassan Rouhani's government seeks to show results from the sanctions deal ahead of elections on May 19.
General Electric,2017-5,Iran says the prospect of buying Western jets to renew its decaying fleet was built into the 2015 nuclear deal and that any barriers to completing the purchases would undermine the accord.
General Electric,2017-5,"On the UK side, Prime Minister Theresa May's recent decision to hold a snap election in early June means any new funding deal is unlikely to be finalised before then."
General Electric,2017-5,UK government agencies like UKEF avoid major new initiatives during campaigning and a deal involving a topic as sensitive as trade with Iran would need approval before it could go ahead.
General Electric,2017-5,Airbus said last week on an investors' call that it hoped to receive some support from European export financing agencies this year.
General Electric,2017-5,But a source familiar with the process said it remained unclear how quickly UKEF would lift a temporary ban on Airbus funding as the UK and French fraud investigation continues.
General Electric,2017-5,"If UKEF provides support for Boeing deliveries, it would not be the first time, but it would be rare. The main proviso is that a certain proportion of parts in each jet need to be made in Britain - usually 20 percent."
General Electric,2017-5,"For Boeing exports, that would typically mean the jets would have to have Rolls-Royce engines. The Boeing planes ordered by Iran all have engines made by U.S. supplier General Electric or GE and its French partner Safran ."
General Electric,2017-5,UKEF has said in the past it recognises the need to be flexible on foreign content in view of global supply chains. People who have dealt with the agency before say it may be able to consider equipment bought by Boeing from British companies.

General Electric,2017-5,{{20170504T114811.897+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-Time for Siemens investors to forget troubled past(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.)
General Electric,2017-5,"LONDON, May 4 (Reuters Breakingviews) - A company's share price usually reflects hopes for the future. Investors' views of Siemens , however, are clouded by its troubled past. For decades, the German engineering group displayed subpar profitability and a talent for botching large-scale projects. The consequence is a persistent discount to historically better-performing peers like GE and ABB ."
General Electric,2017-5,"Kaeser has cut red tape, hived off non-core businesses like consumer appliances and invested heavily in fast-growing, margin-rich software operations. Most importantly, he has ended the streak of one-off charges by overhauling Siemens' project management and appointing 100 managers who constantly assess and monitor risks attached to big-ticket orders."
General Electric,2017-5,"The approach is working. The first three months of 2017 marked the sixth consecutive quarter without any nasty surprises. Since 2013, the group's operating margin is up by a fifth and earnings per share have risen by a third. Analysts polled by Reuters expect the group's operating margin to widen by another 2 percentage points to more than 11 percent by 2019. The impending partial spin-off of Siemens' healthcare business should also help to reduce its conglomerate discount."
General Electric,2017-5,"All this is only partly reflected in Siemens' share price. Under Kaeser the company has produced a total shareholder return of close to 80 percent, well ahead of 34 percent at GE and 28 percent at ABB. Yet this mainly reflects improved earnings. Siemens' valuation discount to its peers remains a stubborn 9 percent. It's time for shareholders to start looking ahead."
General Electric,2017-5,"- Siemens on May 4 reported better-than-expected results for the three months to March. Orders rose 1 percent to 22.6 billion euros ($24.6 billion) compared with the same period in 2016, while revenue was up 5 percent at 20.2 billion euros."
General Electric,2017-5,"- Industrial business profit increased 18 percent year-on-year to 2.49 billion euros, giving Siemens a profit margin of 12.1 percent."
General Electric,2017-5,- Six of the industrial group's eight business units exceeded profit forecasts from analysts polled by Reuters. Siemens reiterated its guidance for the full year. It expects modest revenue growth and industrial profit margin of between 11 percent and 12 percent.
General Electric,2017-5,- Siemens shares were down 1 percent to 131.05 euros by 0906 BST on May 4.

General Electric,2017-5,{{20170504T085022.903+0000}}EXCLUSIVE-Iran in talks with UK over jetliner export funding* Iran official says UK agency offers to fund some Airbus exports
General Electric,2017-5,* Says UK agency also willing to back some Boeing sales to Iran
General Electric,2017-5,"PARIS, May 4 (Reuters) - Iran is in talks with Britain's export credit agency to facilitate the financing of aircraft sales to state airline IranAir as part of its pact with world powers to lift sanctions over its nuclear programme, a senior Iranian official said."
General Electric,2017-5,IranAir's plan to buy more than 180 jets from Airbus [AIR.PA] and Boeing is the most visible economic deal on the table after major powers last year lifted most sanctions on Iran in return for restrictions on its nuclear activities.
General Electric,2017-5,"But financing for the purchases has been hard to secure because most Western banks are holding back, concerned about the future of the 2015 agreement after U.S. President Donald Trump called it a bad deal and ordered a review."
General Electric,2017-5,"So far, IranAir has taken delivery of just three Airbus jets, for which it paid cash, industry sources say."
General Electric,2017-5,"Deputy Roads and Urban Development Minister Asghar Fakhrieh-Kashan said the UK's export credit arm, UK Export Finance (UKEF), had tentatively offered support for least some Airbus jets built in Britain, France, Germany and Spain. It could also offer some support to Airbus's U.S. rival, Boeing, he added."
General Electric,2017-5,"""We have received some offers from UKEF, that is under review by Iran,"" Fakhrieh-Kashan told Reuters."
General Electric,2017-5,Two aircraft industry sources who asked not to be named also confirmed talks were taking place.
General Electric,2017-5,Countries in parts of the world where banks won't invest often turn to European and U.S. governments for export credits or loan insurance when they want to buy big-ticket items like aircraft from those countries' companies.
General Electric,2017-5,"About 6 percent of aircraft deliveries depend on such support, which removes some but not all of the risks banks face in lending to airlines with poor credit, helping to grease the wheels of trade."
General Electric,2017-5,"This fallback system has been frozen for more than a year, however, as European agencies demand more controls after Airbus acknowledged making faulty applications for UK aid, triggering a fraud probe, and UKEF's equivalent in Washington, the Export-Import Bank (EXIM), faced a battle over its future."
General Electric,2017-5,"U.S. President Donald Trump hinted in his campaign he might get rid of the EXIM Bank, which some conservative members of Congress have argued perpetuates cronyism. He has since talked up the benefits of exports for U.S. jobs and in April nominated a new bank president and a member of the board. [nL8N1HM1JZ]"
General Electric,2017-5,Speeding up aircraft deliveries is seen as a priority for Tehran as President Hassan Rouhani's government seeks to show results from the sanctions deal ahead of elections on May 19.
General Electric,2017-5,Iran says the prospect of buying Western jets to renew its decaying fleet was built into the 2015 nuclear deal and that any barriers to completing the purchases would undermine the accord.
General Electric,2017-5,"On the UK side, Prime Minister Theresa May's recent decision to hold a snap election in early June means any new funding deal is unlikely to be finalised before then."
General Electric,2017-5,UK government agencies like UKEF avoid major new initiatives during campaigning and a deal involving a topic as sensitive as trade with Iran would need approval before it could go ahead.
General Electric,2017-5,Airbus said last week on an investors' call that it hoped to receive some support from European export financing agencies this year.
General Electric,2017-5,But a source familiar with the process said it remained unclear how quickly UKEF would lift a temporary ban on Airbus funding as the UK and French fraud investigation continues.
General Electric,2017-5,"If UKEF provides support for Boeing deliveries, it would not be the first time, but it would be rare. The main proviso is that a certain proportion of parts in each jet need to be made in Britain - usually 20 percent."
General Electric,2017-5,"For Boeing exports, that would typically mean the jets would have to have Rolls-Royce engines. The Boeing planes ordered by Iran all have engines made by U.S. supplier General Electric or GE and its French partner Safran ."
General Electric,2017-5,UKEF has said in the past it recognises the need to be flexible on foreign content in view of global supply chains. People who have dealt with the agency before say it may be able to consider equipment bought by Boeing from British companies.
