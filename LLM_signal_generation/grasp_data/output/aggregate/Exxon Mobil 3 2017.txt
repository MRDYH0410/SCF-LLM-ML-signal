Exxon,2017-3,"{{20170331T124934.696+0000}}BUZZ-Exxon issues another new Qua Iboe plan due to loading delaysLONDON, March 31 (Reuters) - ** ExxonMobil has issued what is at least its fourth revised loading programme for Qua Iboe crude oil, Nigeria's largest export stream, after further loading delays, traders said on Friday."
Exxon,2017-3,"** Cargoes from the March, April and May programmes are delayed by up to four weeks, pushing two of the May cargoes into June, according to a revised programme seen by Reuters."
Exxon,2017-3,"** There are now 9 cargoes, for a total of 285,000 barrels per day (bpd) set to load in April, some of which were originally scheduled to load in the middle of March. There are 8 cargoes set to load in May with 245,000 bpd."
Exxon,2017-3,** Persistent loading delays have forced field operator ExxonMobil to revise the loading plan several times in what traders said was an unusual amount of changes for a grade not under force majeure. [nL5N1FL5VW][L5N1GG4JK]
Exxon,2017-3,** The issues have made buyers more reluctant to purchase Qua Iboe cargoes. Traders said Exxon is dealing with pumping issues and metering issues on the export pipeline. Exxon does not comment on its operations.

Exxon,2017-3,"HOUSTON, March 30 (Reuters) - North Dakota oil production will get a shot in the arm next month as a pipeline comes online despite opposition by environmental groups and Native Americans, allowing the energy industry to save at least $540 million in annual shipping costs."

Exxon,2017-3,Market players said they expect this will hasten a revival of output from the Bakken region which fell sharply along with global oil prices during the past two years. [nL1N1FS1QC]
Exxon,2017-3,"""We're back to growth in the Bakken,"" Hess Corp Chief Executive Officer John Hess said in a recent interview. The New York-based company has contracts to send roughly half its daily North Dakota output through DAPL. For 2017, Hess has said its Bakken production could grow more than 10 percent."
Exxon,2017-3,"President Donald Trump approved the $3.7 billion pipeline in February, reversing the prior administration which had blocked it last December with a decision by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers."
Exxon,2017-3,"Energy Transfer Partners LP , which operates the 1,100 mile (1,770 km) long DAPL, has begun filling the line with crude and could reach full operating capacity by late April, based on industry estimates."

Exxon,2017-3,"The pipeline will carry about 500,000 barrels of oil per day, more than half of North Dakota's daily output, cutting reliance on riskier rail-cars and reducing transport cost by roughly $3 to $5 per barrel, analysts estimate."

Exxon,2017-3,"The state's drilling rig count has jumped 40 percent since early February, when Trump gave final approval to the pipeline. By the end of the year, analysts expect the rig count to rise another 10 percent or more."
Exxon,2017-3,"DAPL's opponents say they will continue to oppose the line and oil production across North Dakota, which pumps more crude each day than any state but Texas."
Exxon,2017-3,"""Just because oil flow is pending does not mean that it cannot be stopped by court order, and we have a strong, ongoing case in front of the courts,"" said David Archambault II, chairman of North Dakota's Standing Rock Sioux tribe, which lives adjacent to the line."

Exxon,2017-3,"North Dakota's oil production fell 13 percent in the last 12 months for which data are available to about 980,000 barrels per day (bpd) due to low prices.

Exxon,2017-3,"{{20170330T032056.235+0000}}Texas judge kicks Exxon climate lawsuit to New York court HOUSTON, March 29 (Reuters) - A federal judge in Texas on Wednesday kicked an Exxon Mobil Corp lawsuit seeking to thwart two states from pursuing a fraud case over climate change to a Manhattan court, saying his court wasn't the best place to resolve the dispute."
Exxon,2017-3,"A group of state attorneys general, led by New York's Eric Schneiderman, brought a securities fraud suit against the world's largest publicly traded oil company in 2015 claiming it misled investors by soft-pedaling the dangers of climate change."
Exxon,2017-3,Exxon criticized their case as intended to get the company and others in the oil and gas industry to change their positions on climate change. It responded with its own suit in U.S. District Court in Dallas.
Exxon,2017-3,That suit argued the states conspired with climate activists to target Exxon and the states' demands for documents dating back 40 years violated its rights to protection against unreasonable searches and were abusive.
Exxon,2017-3,"U.S. District Judge Ed Kinkeade, who earlier sought to question Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey over Exxon's claims the original fraud lawsuit was biased, ruled in favor of Healey and her New York counterpart. He wrote his court was not the proper venue because events at issue in the case took place in New York."
Exxon,2017-3,"But the judge's decision questioned whether the two AGs ""are trying to hide something,"" citing an agreement with climate activists not to publicly discuss their contacts. He also said the agreement should be open to discovery by Exxon attorneys."
Exxon,2017-3,"Exxon had argued that the requests for documents were, as the judge summarized it, tools to cultivate the political goals of Healey and New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman."
Exxon,2017-3,"Despite having the case transferred to Manhattan, an Exxon spokesman said the company was gratified the judge agreed its ""claims involve important issues,"" adding: ""We look forward to continuing the case in that court."""
Exxon,2017-3,"Healey also lauded the decision to move the case, saying ""we will continue to argue that this frivolous lawsuit should be dismissed."""
Exxon,2017-3,"Amy Spitalnick, a spokeswoman for Schneiderman, said in a statement that the judge's remarks in the ruling were ""riddled with factual errors and oil industry spin,"" and said Exxon was free to make the same claims in New York but ""so far, inexplicably have not done so."""
Exxon,2017-3,"The case is 4:16-cv-00469 in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas, Fort Worth division."

Exxon,2017-3,"RAVENNA, Italy, March 29 (Reuters) - Italy's Eni said on Wednesday it expected that its recent discovery off the coast of Mexico would hold more than the 800 million barrels of oil it originally estimated."
Exxon,2017-3,"""This is an important find and we've found new layers of good light oil that make us think there's more,"" Chief Executive Claudio Descalzi said at an oil and gas conference."
Exxon,2017-3,"Eni said earlier this month it had found ""meaningful"" reserves of oil off the coast of Mexico after becoming the first international oil company to drill a well in the country after a 2013 reform opening up the sector to investors."
Exxon,2017-3,"State-controlled Eni, which in recent years has made major gas finds in Mozambique and Egypt, holds one of the best discovery track records in the industry."
Exxon,2017-3,Its organic reserve replacement ratio -- a measure of its ability to find hydrocarbons -- stood at 193 percent in 2016 compared to a 35 percent peer average.
Exxon,2017-3,"""Eni's Zohr discovery is a game changer,"" Egypt's oil minister Tarek El Molla said on Wednesday, referring to Eni's discovery in Egyptian waters of the biggest gas field ever found in the Mediterranean."
Exxon,2017-3,"Descalzi said Eni would follow the same strategy in Mexico as it had adopted in Egypt, using infrastructure already in place to help speed up time to market."
Exxon,2017-3,"He said the discovery, some 6-7 km from the coast, was close to installations owned by Mexico's state-owned oil company Pemex. He added he would speak to Pemex in coming months to discuss using some of their infrastructure in the area."
Exxon,2017-3,"Royal Dutch Shell , Chevron and Exxon Mobil have recently signaled the oil industry's return to Mexico's deep waters with high bids in a government auction."
Exxon,2017-3,"Since taking over as Eni CEO in 2014, oil veteran Descalzi has streamlined the company, focusing attention on the upstream job of finding oil and gas."
Exxon,2017-3,"Asked about the group's retail gas and power business which serves 11 million clients, he said a decision would be taken this year on whether or not to sell all or part of it. ""There is a lot of interest from industrial players and funds,"" he said."

Exxon,2017-3,"LONDON, March 29 (Reuters) - BP has no plan to build new refineries despite growing oil production and will focus on modernising existing plants while expanding its network of filling stations to generate $3 billion in additional cash."
Exxon,2017-3,"The group's head of refining told Reuters that even though BP's output was set to spike as new fields become operational, its attitude to refining remains more cautious."
Exxon,2017-3,"""Are we going to invest in more greenfield refining in BP? Probably not,"" said Tufan Erginbilgic, who has worked in refining since 1990."
Exxon,2017-3,He said BP was happy with its refining portfolio although it could sell some assets in downstream - which combines refineries with chemicals plants and infrastructure such as storage.
Exxon,2017-3,"Refining of crude oil into fuels such as gasoline, diesel and jet fuel has for years been the industry's problem child, having to grapple with weak and volatile profit margins as well as competition from modern refineries built in China, India and the Middle East."
Exxon,2017-3,"The problems are compounded by the prospect of more energy-efficient cars, aircraft and heating, tighter marine fuel standards, the rise of electric vehicles and slowing consumption growth."
Exxon,2017-3,"A push to modernise and streamline BP's refining, trading and marketing - known as downstream activities - generated $5.6 billion in free cashflow last year, up 25 percent from 2014 despite refining margins at 12-year lows, Erginbilgic said."
Exxon,2017-3,"Erginbilgic, who became downstream chief in 2014, said he is aiming for a $3 billion increase in free cashflow by 2021."
Exxon,2017-3,"""We will sell one or two assets, making very good money today because the tide went up for these assets,"" he told Reuters."
Exxon,2017-3,"Refining proved to be extremely valuable for integrated oil companies, offsetting much of the losses from production operations during the two-year tumble in oil prices that started in 2014."
Exxon,2017-3,Erginbilgic says BP's investment decisions are driven by an expected global push towards greater energy efficiency and its belief that demand growth will slow in the next 20 years to reach about 112 million barrels per day (bpd) from 96 million bpd today.
Exxon,2017-3,"Overcapacity and weak demand growth will probably prompt more refiners to close plants in Europe, he said. In the United States, refineries will benefit from rising production and booming exports to growing Asian markets."
Exxon,2017-3,"Last year BP and Russia's top oil company, Rosneft , dissolved a refining joint venture in Germany. In the United States, BP invested billions of dollars in modernising its Whiting refinery near Chicago, originally built in 1889 by John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil Company."
Exxon,2017-3,"BP is by no means the only oil major embracing a strategy rethink to adapt to evolving markets. Rivals including Shell and France's Total have undergone deep portfolio reviews in recent years, selling and closing many operations."
Exxon,2017-3,"BP was forced to start asset sales long before the oil price collapsed, in part to raise money for litigation costs relating to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill."
Exxon,2017-3,The company has sold or converted 16 plants since 2000 and today operates or has a stake in 11 refineries and 17 petrochemicals plants.
Exxon,2017-3,"It is seeking to sell its 50 percent stake in Chinese petrochemicals joint venture SECCO, its largest investment in China, Reuters reported last year.[nL4N1AQ1V0]"
Exxon,2017-3,"Though Shell and trading company Vitol, among others, expect gasoline and diesel demand to peak between 2020 and 2030, some refining segments still represent solid growth stories, Erginbilgic says."
Exxon,2017-3,"Petrochemicals will not suffer any significant slowdown because energy efficiency doesn't reduce demand for plastics, particularly in Asia, he said."
Exxon,2017-3,"BP's trading operations are expected to benefit from growing global crude trade on the back of abundant U.S., Canadian and Brazilian production and rising energy demand in Asia, he added.[nL5N1H44ZF]"
Exxon,2017-3,"BP is also betting on expanding its network of petrol stations with high-end convenience stores at a time other majors, including Shell and Exxon Mobil , have been shrinking their vast but often basic networks."
Exxon,2017-3,"In Britain, BP operates its chain with retailer Marks & Spencer . In Germany, it teamed up with REWE."
Exxon,2017-3,"Late last year it agreed to buy a chain of stations from Australia's top grocer Woolworths for $1.3 billion and Erginbilgic said BP's model could be expanded to markets such as Mexico, Indonesia, China and India. [nL4N1EM3DB]"
Exxon,2017-3,"Erginbilgic said the marketing business, which also includes lubricants, can deliver an extra $2 billion in cashflow by 2021, twice as much as refining and petrochemicals."

Exxon,2017-3,"HOUSTON, March 29 (Reuters) - An aging California refinery is testing PBF Energy Inc's reputation as a turnaround whiz, with mounting production woes and costly repairs at the 88-year-old plant throwing a wrench into efforts to quickly revive profits."
Exxon,2017-3,"The refinery, acquired from Exxon Mobil Corp for $537.5 million, has reported frequent breakdowns since the deal closed last July. On April 1, a regional air-quality regulator expects to consider the plant's frequent breakdowns and emissions, along with a plan to enhance safety with an expensive phase out of a chemical used in gasoline production."
Exxon,2017-3,"PBF is spending $100 million this year to improve operations, and is budgeting another $50 million for upgrading its electric power to prevent outages.

Exxon,2017-3,"HONG KONG, March 29 (Reuters) - Australian energy major Woodside Petroleum on Wednesday hinted it may in future be willing to allow buyers of liquefied natural gas (LNG) more flexibility as part of long-term contracts, saying that in time this could help create a more liquid market."
Exxon,2017-3,"Last week, the biggest buyers in the world's top three LNG consuming countries - Japan, South Korea and China - clubbed together to secure greater supply flexibility. [nL3N1H02FJ]"
Exxon,2017-3,"The move potentially shifts power to importers amid a growing surplus, adding pressure on producers like Woodside and peers Royal Dutch Shell , Chevron and Exxon Mobil to grant more flexible contracts."
Exxon,2017-3,"Speaking as one of the first executives of a major LNG producer to address the buyers' alliance, Woodside's Chief Executive Peter Coleman said on Wednesday he did not see a threat from the new grouping."
Exxon,2017-3,"""We are OK with it, we don't see a threat from it at all,"" he told Reuters in Hong Kong."
Exxon,2017-3,"The main goal of the buyers' alliance - made up Japan's JERA, Korea Gas Corp (KOGAS) and China National Offshore Oil Corp (CNOOC) - is to rid themselves of long-term contracts that oblige them to take in a fixed amount of cargoes every month and which do not allow them to sell excess cargoes to third parties."
Exxon,2017-3,"Coleman did not specifically say Woodside was willing to grant buyers more flexibility in future, but said that to ""cooperate and move things around"" was a sensible thing to do for the big LNG buyers."
Exxon,2017-3,"""It actually helps create more liquidity in the market place, because you have a large volume of LNG moving through the three different market players,"" he said."
Exxon,2017-3,"The LNG industry is undergoing huge change as the biggest ever flood of new supply is hitting the market, with volumes coming mainly from Australia and the United States."
Exxon,2017-3,The oversupply resulted in a more than 70 percent fall in Asian spot LNG prices from their 2014 peaks to around $5.50 per million British thermal unites (mmBtu).
Exxon,2017-3,"However, Woodside has come through the market rout in better shape than many rivals, with $2.7 billion in cash and undrawn debt, and sees itself well positioned. [nL4N1G662V]"
Exxon,2017-3,"Woodside operates large LNG export facilities like Pluto and the North West Shelf, and is a partner in the $34 billion Wheatstone project, scheduled to start up later this year. It also has plans for another project, Browse, but for which it has not yet made a final investment decision (FID). [nL4N1D00MR]"
Exxon,2017-3,"Still, while oversupply will likely trigger more trading in LNG as producers sell uncontracted cargoes, Coleman said it made it difficult to develop large new production projects."
Exxon,2017-3,"""The challenge today is there is not a market you can go to and develop a mega project ... The mega projects - 15-20 million tonnes (annual capacity) - still require buyers in long-term contracts to finance,"" he said."
Exxon,2017-3,"Thanks to high spot prices of up to $20 per mmBtu over past years, producers and buyers were keen to sign long-term contracts that guaranteed supplies at stable prices."
Exxon,2017-3,"Now, with oil and gas prices much lower and abundant supplies, LNG importers are keener on freely trading LNG instead of entering fixed term deals."
Exxon,2017-3,"""Buyers are still two years away from being able to take out (new) long-term contracts for big projects,"" Coleman said."

Exxon,2017-3,"LONDON, March 29 (Reuters) - BP has no plan to build new refineries despite growing oil production and will focus on modernising existing plants while expanding its network of filling stations to generate $3 billion in additional cash."
Exxon,2017-3,"The group's head of refining told Reuters that even though BP's output was set to spike as new fields become operational, its attitude to refining remains more cautious."
Exxon,2017-3,"""Are we going to invest in more greenfield refining in BP? Probably not,"" said Tufan Erginbilgic, who has worked in refining since 1990."
Exxon,2017-3,He said BP was happy with its refining portfolio although it could sell some assets in downstream - which combines refineries with chemicals plants and infrastructure such as storage.
Exxon,2017-3,"Refining of crude oil into fuels such as gasoline, diesel and jet fuel has for years been the industry's problem child, having to grapple with weak and volatile profit margins as well as competition from modern refineries built in China, India and the Middle East."
Exxon,2017-3,"The problems are compounded by the prospect of more energy-efficient cars, aircraft and heating, tighter marine fuel standards, the rise of electric vehicles and slowing consumption growth."
Exxon,2017-3,"A push to modernise and streamline BP's refining, trading and marketing - known as downstream activities - generated $5.6 billion in free cashflow last year, up 25 percent from 2014 despite refining margins at 12-year lows, Erginbilgic said."
Exxon,2017-3,"Erginbilgic, who became downstream chief in 2014, said he is aiming for a $3 billion increase in free cashflow by 2021."
Exxon,2017-3,"""We will sell one or two assets, making very good money today because the tide went up for these assets,"" he told Reuters."
Exxon,2017-3,"Refining proved to be extremely valuable for integrated oil companies, offsetting much of the losses from production operations during the two-year tumble in oil prices that started in 2014."
Exxon,2017-3,Erginbilgic says BP's investment decisions are driven by an expected global push towards greater energy efficiency and its belief that demand growth will slow in the next 20 years to reach about 112 million barrels per day (bpd) from 96 million bpd today.
Exxon,2017-3,"Overcapacity and weak demand growth will probably prompt more refiners to close plants in Europe, he said. In the United States, refineries will benefit from rising production and booming exports to growing Asian markets."
Exxon,2017-3,"Last year BP and Russia's top oil company, Rosneft , dissolved a refining joint venture in Germany. In the United States, BP invested billions of dollars in modernising its Whiting refinery near Chicago, originally built in 1889 by John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil Company."
Exxon,2017-3,"BP is by no means the only oil major embracing a strategy rethink to adapt to evolving markets. Rivals including Shell and France's Total have undergone deep portfolio reviews in recent years, selling and closing many operations."
Exxon,2017-3,"BP was forced to start asset sales long before the oil price collapsed, in part to raise money for litigation costs relating to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill."
Exxon,2017-3,The company has sold or converted 16 plants since 2000 and today operates or has a stake in 11 refineries and 17 petrochemicals plants.
Exxon,2017-3,"It is seeking to sell its 50 percent stake in Chinese petrochemicals joint venture SECCO, its largest investment in China, Reuters reported last year.[nL4N1AQ1V0]"
Exxon,2017-3,"Though Shell and trading company Vitol, among others, expect gasoline and diesel demand to peak between 2020 and 2030, some refining segments still represent solid growth stories, Erginbilgic says."
Exxon,2017-3,"Petrochemicals will not suffer any significant slowdown because energy efficiency doesn't reduce demand for plastics, particularly in Asia, he said."
Exxon,2017-3,"BP is also betting on expanding its network of petrol stations with high-end convenience stores at a time other majors, including Shell and Exxon Mobil , have been shrinking their vast but often basic networks."
Exxon,2017-3,"In Britain, BP operates its chain with retailer Marks & Spencer . In Germany, it teamed up with REWE."
Exxon,2017-3,"Late last year it agreed to buy a chain of stations from Australia's top grocer Woolworths for $1.3 billion and Erginbilgic said BP's model could be expanded to markets such as Mexico, Indonesia, China and India. [nL4N1EM3DB]"
Exxon,2017-3,"Erginbilgic said the marketing business, which also includes lubricants, can deliver an extra $2 billion in cashflow by 2021, twice as much as refining and petrochemicals."

Exxon,2017-3,"HOUSTON, March 29 (Reuters) - An aging California refinery is testing PBF Energy Inc's reputation as a turnaround whiz, with mounting production woes and costly repairs at the 88-year-old plant throwing a wrench into efforts to quickly revive profits."
Exxon,2017-3,"The refinery, acquired from Exxon Mobil Corp for $537.5 million, has reported frequent breakdowns since the deal closed last July. On April 1, a regional air-quality regulator expects to consider the plant's frequent breakdowns and emissions, along with a plan to enhance safety with an expensive phase out of a chemical used in gasoline production."
Exxon,2017-3,"PBF is spending $100 million this year to improve operations, and is budgeting another $50 million for upgrading its electric power to prevent outages. Phasing out the use of modified hydrofluoric acid at the plant presents a potentially larger bill that was not on the table when PBF bought the refinery last July."
Exxon,2017-3,"This week, the company lowered its estimate of first-quarter crude throughput at Torrance by 16 percent. It has said the overhaul would allow the Torrance refinery to boost production and hit profitability goals. ""These things will be fixed,"" PBF Chief Executive Tom Nimbley assured analysts on an earnings call last month."

Exxon,2017-3,"BOSTON, March 23 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump's White House has said his plans to slash environmental regulations will trigger a new energy boom and help the United States drill its way to independence from foreign oil."
Exxon,2017-3,"But the top U.S. oil and gas companies have been telling their shareholders that regulations have little impact on their business, according to a Reuters review of U.S. securities filings from the top producers."
Exxon,2017-3,"In annual reports to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, 13 of the 15 biggest U.S. oil and gas producers said that compliance with current regulations is not impacting their operations or their financial condition."
Exxon,2017-3,"The other two made no comment about whether their businesses were materially affected by regulation, but reported spending on compliance with environmental regulations at less than 3 percent of revenue."
Exxon,2017-3,"The dissonance raises questions about whether Trump's war on regulation can increase domestic oil and gas output, as he has promised, or boost profits and share prices of oil and gas companies, as some investors have hoped."
Exxon,2017-3,"According to the SEC, a publicly traded company must deem a matter ""material"" and report it to the agency if there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable investor would consider it important."
Exxon,2017-3,"""Materiality is a fairly low bar,"" said Cary Coglianese, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania who runs the university's research program on regulation. ""Despite exaggerated claims, regulatory costs are usually a very small portion of many companies' cost of doing business."""
Exxon,2017-3,"The oil majors' annual filings come after the industry and its political allies have spent years criticizing the Obama administration for policies aimed at reducing fossil-fuel consumption, curtailing drilling on federal lands and subsidizing renewable energy."
Exxon,2017-3,Trump promised during the campaign that a rollback of the Democratic administration's policies would help free the nation from reliance on imported oil.
Exxon,2017-3,"""Under my presidency, we will accomplish complete American energy independence,"" said Trump, describing regulation as a ""self-inflicted wound."""
Exxon,2017-3,"The Trump administration is now preparing an executive order - dubbed the ""Energy Independence"" executive order - to roll back Obama-era regulations, which could be signed as early as this month, according to administration officials."
Exxon,2017-3,"U.S. presidents have aimed to reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil since the Arab oil embargo of the 1970s, which triggered soaring prices. But the United States still imports about 7.9 million barrels of crude oil a day - almost enough meet total oil demand in Japan and India combined."
Exxon,2017-3,The Trump administration's attacks on regulation have been applauded by the oil industry.
Exxon,2017-3,"""We haven't seen 3 percent growth in the economy for eight years, and I think part of the reason is that we've had a heavy dose of regulation,"" Chevron Corp. CEO John Watson said at CERAWeek, a global energy conference in Houston this month."
Exxon,2017-3,"Continental Resources CEO, Harold Hamm, who advised Trump on energy issues during his campaign for the White House, told the Republican National Convention in Cleveland in July that stripping regulation could allow the country to double its production of oil and gas, triggering a new ""American energy renaissance."""
Exxon,2017-3,"Yet Continental's annual report, filed last month with the SEC, says environmental regulation - after eight years under the Obama administration - does not have a ""material adverse effect on our operations to any greater degree than other similarly situated competitors."""
Exxon,2017-3,Continental's competitors who reported actual spending on environmental compliance told investors that such expenses amount to a small percentage of operating revenues.
Exxon,2017-3,Fourteen of the 15 companies whose filings were reviewed by Reuters declined to comment on their statements to investors or the impact of regulation on their profits.
Exxon,2017-3,A spokesman for ConocoPhillips acknowledged that regulatory compliance has not had a material adverse impact on the company's liquidity or financial position. But red tape can be an unwelcome burden nonetheless.
Exxon,2017-3,"""Changing, excessive, overlapping, duplicative and potentially conflicting regulations increase costs, cause potential delays and negatively impact investment decisions, with great cost to consumers of energy,"" the spokesman, Daren Beaudo, said in a written statement."
Exxon,2017-3,The American Petroleum Institute - which represents the U.S. oil and gas industry - also declined to comment.
Exxon,2017-3,"Last month, before the U.S. Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, API President Jack Gerard said that the oil and gas industry has surged forward despite onerous regulations under the Obama administration."
Exxon,2017-3,"""Technological innovations and industry leadership have propelled the oil and gas industry forward despite the unprecedented onslaught of 145 new and pending federal regulatory actions targeting our industry."""
Exxon,2017-3,"Though the industry saw a staunch opponent in Obama, oil and gas production soared more than 50 percent during his presidency. That was mainly because of high oil prices and improved hydraulic fracturing, a drilling technology that has allowed producers to access new reserves in previously tough-to -reach shale formations."
Exxon,2017-3,The rush of production ultimately contributed to a global glut that dropped crude oil prices from a high of over $100 a barrel in early 2014 to a low of nearly $25 by 2016. Current prices hover near $50 a barrel.
Exxon,2017-3,"Four of the 15 companies reviewed by Reuters reported that spending on environmental matters - including new equipment or facilities, as well as fines and compliance staffing - amounted to a small fraction of revenues."
Exxon,2017-3,"Exxon Mobil reported spending $4.9 billion worldwide in 2016, or about 2.24 percent of gross revenue. Occidental Petroleum , a much smaller company, reported spending $285 million, or about 2.82 percent of revenue. Neither addressed whether the spending was ""material"" in their filings."
Exxon,2017-3,"Two other companies, ConocoPhillips and Chevron, also broke out their environmental spending while reporting that regulation had no material impact on their business. Conoco spent $627 million in 2016, or about 2.57 percent of gross revenue, while Chevron spent $2.1 billion, or 1.91 percent of gross revenue."
Exxon,2017-3,"The other 11 companies did not break out spending, but all of them told the SEC that environmental regulation did not have a material impact on their business."
Exxon,2017-3,"In one typical statement, EOG Resources , one of the biggest U.S. producers, told investors in a report filed last month: ""Compliance with environmental laws and regulations increases EOG's overall cost of business, but has not had, to date, a material adverse effect on EOG's operations, financial condition or results of operations."""
Exxon,2017-3,"Devon Energy Corp , Anadarko Petroleum Corp , Pioneer Natural Resources Co , Apache Corp , and other large U.S.-focused oil and gas drillers used similar wording."
Exxon,2017-3,"Still, Obama's exit - and Trump's win over Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in November - has been enough to brighten the outlook of some big investors."
Exxon,2017-3,"""I believe the absence of a negative is a positive,"" John Dowd, who manages several energy funds at Fidelity Investments, wrote in his 2017 energy outlook. ""The market has been concerned with the sustainability of fracking, and particularly to what extent it might have been regulated into obscurity by a different election outcome."""
Exxon,2017-3,Clinton had said during her campaign that she planned to increase regulation on fracking.
Exxon,2017-3,"Other segments of the energy industry, such as coal mining and oil refining, were harder hit by environmental protection measures during Obama's presidency. Several coal companies went bankrupt in recent years and blamed Obama's climate change initiatives for raising costs and hurting demand."
Exxon,2017-3,Refiners have also long complained that environmental regulations have stymied attempts to build new refineries and that they have borne the brunt of costly rules requiring them to blend biofuels into their gasoline.
Exxon,2017-3,"The abundance of cheap natural gas is seen as the biggest obstacle to reviving coal country, since both fuels compete for space in the furnaces of U.S. power plants. For refiners, the key driver for profitability is the differential between the price of their raw material, crude oil, and the fuels they make with it."
Exxon,2017-3,"""Supply and demand are the fundamental forces driving markets,"" said Coglianese, the University of Pennsylvania law professor. ""Regulation is relatively trivial."""

Exxon,2017-3,* Top LNG buyers to work together to get flexible LNG contracts
Exxon,2017-3,"(Recasts, adds background on buyers' clubs, producer comments, Qatar official, detail on WTO and market impact)"
Exxon,2017-3,"SEOUL/TOKYO/MILAN, March 23 (Reuters) - The world's biggest liquefied natural gas (LNG) buyers, all in Asia, are clubbing together to secure more flexible supply contracts in a move which shifts power to importers from producers as oversupply grows."
Exxon,2017-3,"Korea Gas Corp (KOGAS) said on Thursday it had signed a memorandum of understanding in mid-March with Japan's JERA and China National Offshore Oil Corp (CNOOC) to exchange information and ""cooperate in the joint procurement of LNG."""
Exxon,2017-3,"Together, the three companies purchase a third of global LNG production, giving them a strong hand to challenge restrictive contract terms that have squeezed buyers' finances."
Exxon,2017-3,"Influential buyers' clubs are largely unheard of in commodity markets where it is the producers, such as the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), who wield power, enforcing production quotas to manage prices."
Exxon,2017-3,"A painful period of high LNG prices before 2014 left Asian importers scrambling to contain losses and led to the first talks between India, Japan, South Korea, China and Taiwan about joint purchases."
Exxon,2017-3,"Several joint LNG-buying deals have been set up since then but none approach the scale of the latest agreement, which is the first involving the game's biggest players."
Exxon,2017-3,"Under Thursday's agreement, the buyers aim to extract concessions from producers that would give them supply flexibility, such as having the right to re-sell imports to third parties, something they are not allowed to do currently under so-called destination restrictions."
Exxon,2017-3,"""We have created a platform to share, discuss and solve our common issues such as traditional LNG business practices, including destination restrictions,"" said JERA spokesman Atsuo Sawaki."
Exxon,2017-3,"The alliance of three big buyers across three countries will put pressure on exporters such as Qatar, Australia and Malaysia. They prefer to have clients locked into fixed supply contracts which run for decades and make buyers take fixed amounts of monthly volumes irrespective of demand, with no right to re-sell surplus supplies to other end-users."
Exxon,2017-3,"The agreement has been helped by the fact the power wielded by OPEC is unparalleled in the commodities world. Attempts to create an OPEC-style body through the Gas Exporting Countries Forum has failed to gain traction because gas and LNG markets are more fragmented than oil, while similar moves in coffee, railroads, rubber and tin have all collapsed over the decades."
Exxon,2017-3,"The LNG market is undergoing huge changes as the biggest ever flood of new supply is hitting the market, with volumes coming mainly from Australia and the United States."
Exxon,2017-3,"JERA, KOGAS and CNOOC will all struggle with having excess supplies in the next few years, sources at three major LNG producers told Reuters, curbing the consortium's ability to strike any new deals this decade."
Exxon,2017-3,"Reworking existing deals, however, is feasible and may hit the world's biggest producer Qatar the hardest as many of its mid-term supply deals with Japan start to expire from around 2023, industry sources said."
Exxon,2017-3,A senior Qatar Petroleum official hinted that buyers - emboldened by temporarily oversupplied markets to demand better terms - may come to regret their actions when the cycle turns.
Exxon,2017-3,"""Right now the market is over-supplied but if we went into a period of a tighter market, how would these buyers organisations hold up? That is an important question,"" the official said."
Exxon,2017-3,"""If there is a market crunch and gas tightens it could recreate incentives for buyers to lock in long-term contracts."""
Exxon,2017-3,"More practically, the deal complements the buying habits of each company - KOGAS largely buys for winter, CNOOC for summer and JERA across both seasons - offering opportunities for swapping cargoes, industry sources said."
Exxon,2017-3,"""Flexibility is becoming critical for LNG buyers ... as the rise of solar capacity is going to make consumption of LNG more seasonal,"" said Kerry Anne Shanks, head of LNG research for Asia/Pacific at Wood Mackenzie."
Exxon,2017-3,"New production has resulted in global installed LNG capacity of over 300 million tonnes a year, while only around 268 million tonnes of LNG were traded in 2016, according to Thomson Reuters data."
Exxon,2017-3,That has helped pull down Asian spot LNG prices by more than 70 percent from their 2014 peaks to $5.65 per million British thermal units (mmBtu).
Exxon,2017-3,"It has also given importers more suppliers to choose from, putting pressure on major producers like Royal Dutch Shell , Chevron , ExxonMobil and Woodside Petroleum to grant more flexible contract terms."
Exxon,2017-3,"Companies forming cartels are difficult to challenge at the World Trade Organization, which does not have rules about anti-competitive behaviour and only governs trade relations between member countries. But WTO rules do oblige state-run firms to trade on commercial and non-discriminatory terms."
Exxon,2017-3,"Thomas Cottier, a law professor and senior research fellow at the World Trade Institute at the University of Bern, said the LNG alliance may or may not comply with the WTO rules."
Exxon,2017-3,"""To the extent that governments are directly or indirectly involved, it may violate rules on state trading or the prohibition to encourage voluntary export restraints. However, conduct of private companies is subject to domestic anti-trust law and is not part of WTO law,"" he told Reuters by email."
Exxon,2017-3,"Even if an LNG supplier such as Qatar, Russia or Australia launched a dispute at the WTO, several other major gas producers such as Iran and Turkmenistan are not members of the WTO and therefore have no right to have their complaints heard there."

Exxon,2017-3,"BOSTON, March 23 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump's White House has said his plans to slash environmental regulations will trigger a new energy boom and help the United States drill its way to independence from foreign oil."
Exxon,2017-3,"But the top U.S. oil and gas companies have been telling their shareholders that regulations have little impact on their business, according to a Reuters review of U.S. securities filings from the top producers."
Exxon,2017-3,"In annual reports to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, 13 of the 15 biggest U.S. oil and gas producers said that compliance with current regulations is not impacting their operations or their financial condition."
Exxon,2017-3,"The other two made no comment about whether their businesses were materially affected by regulation, but reported spending on compliance with environmental regulations at less than 3 percent of revenue."
Exxon,2017-3,"The dissonance raises questions about whether Trump's war on regulation can increase domestic oil and gas output, as he has promised, or boost profits and share prices of oil and gas companies, as some investors have hoped."
Exxon,2017-3,"According to the SEC, a publicly traded company must deem a matter ""material"" and report it to the agency if there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable investor would consider it important."
Exxon,2017-3,"""Materiality is a fairly low bar,"" said Cary Coglianese, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania who runs the university's research program on regulation. ""Despite exaggerated claims, regulatory costs are usually a very small portion of many companies' cost of doing business."""
Exxon,2017-3,"The oil majors' annual filings come after the industry and its political allies have spent years criticizing the Obama administration for policies aimed at reducing fossil-fuel consumption, curtailing drilling on federal lands and subsidizing renewable energy."
Exxon,2017-3,Trump promised during the campaign that a rollback of the Democratic administration's policies would help free the nation from reliance on imported oil.
Exxon,2017-3,"""Under my presidency, we will accomplish complete American energy independence,"" said Trump, describing regulation as a ""self-inflicted wound."""
Exxon,2017-3,"The Trump administration is now preparing an executive order - dubbed the ""Energy Independence"" executive order - to roll back Obama-era regulations, which could be signed as early as this month, according to administration officials."
Exxon,2017-3,"U.S. presidents have aimed to reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil since the Arab oil embargo of the 1970s, which triggered soaring prices. But the United States still imports about 7.9 million barrels of crude oil a day - almost enough meet total oil demand in Japan and India combined."
Exxon,2017-3,The Trump administration's attacks on regulation have been applauded by the oil industry.
Exxon,2017-3,"""We haven't seen 3 percent growth in the economy for eight years, and I think part of the reason is that we've had a heavy dose of regulation,"" Chevron Corp. CEO John Watson said at CERAWeek, a global energy conference in Houston this month."
Exxon,2017-3,"Continental Resources CEO, Harold Hamm, who advised Trump on energy issues during his campaign for the White House, told the Republican National Convention in Cleveland in July that stripping regulation could allow the country to double its production of oil and gas, triggering a new ""American energy renaissance."""
Exxon,2017-3,"Yet Continental's annual report, filed last month with the SEC, says environmental regulation - after eight years under the Obama administration - does not have a ""material adverse effect on our operations to any greater degree than other similarly situated competitors."""
Exxon,2017-3,Continental's competitors who reported actual spending on environmental compliance told investors that such expenses amount to a small percentage of operating revenues.
Exxon,2017-3,Fourteen of the 15 companies whose filings were reviewed by Reuters declined to comment on their statements to investors or the impact of regulation on their profits.
Exxon,2017-3,A spokesman for ConocoPhillips acknowledged that regulatory compliance has not had a material adverse impact on the company's liquidity or financial position. But red tape can be an unwelcome burden nonetheless.
Exxon,2017-3,"""Changing, excessive, overlapping, duplicative and potentially conflicting regulations increase costs, cause potential delays and negatively impact investment decisions, with great cost to consumers of energy,"" the spokesman, Daren Beaudo, said in a written statement."
Exxon,2017-3,The American Petroleum Institute - which represents the U.S. oil and gas industry - also declined to comment.
Exxon,2017-3,"Last month, before the U.S. Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, API President Jack Gerard said that the oil and gas industry has surged forward despite onerous regulations under the Obama administration."
Exxon,2017-3,"""Technological innovations and industry leadership have propelled the oil and gas industry forward despite the unprecedented onslaught of 145 new and pending federal regulatory actions targeting our industry."""
Exxon,2017-3,"Though the industry saw a staunch opponent in Obama, oil and gas production soared more than 50 percent during his presidency. That was mainly because of high oil prices and improved hydraulic fracturing, a drilling technology that has allowed producers to access new reserves in previously tough-to -reach shale formations."
Exxon,2017-3,The rush of production ultimately contributed to a global glut that dropped crude oil prices from a high of over $100 a barrel in early 2014 to a low of nearly $25 by 2016. Current prices hover near $50 a barrel.
Exxon,2017-3,"Four of the 15 companies reviewed by Reuters reported that spending on environmental matters - including new equipment or facilities, as well as fines and compliance staffing - amounted to a small fraction of revenues."
Exxon,2017-3,"Exxon Mobil reported spending $4.9 billion worldwide in 2016, or about 2.24 percent of gross revenue. Occidental Petroleum , a much smaller company, reported spending $285 million, or about 2.82 percent of revenue. Neither addressed whether the spending was ""material"" in their filings."
Exxon,2017-3,"Two other companies, ConocoPhillips and Chevron, also broke out their environmental spending while reporting that regulation had no material impact on their business. Conoco spent $627 million in 2016, or about 2.57 percent of gross revenue, while Chevron spent $2.1 billion, or 1.91 percent of gross revenue."
Exxon,2017-3,"The other 11 companies did not break out spending, but all of them told the SEC that environmental regulation did not have a material impact on their business."
Exxon,2017-3,"In one typical statement, EOG Resources , one of the biggest U.S. producers, told investors in a report filed last month: ""Compliance with environmental laws and regulations increases EOG's overall cost of business, but has not had, to date, a material adverse effect on EOG's operations, financial condition or results of operations."""
Exxon,2017-3,"Devon Energy Corp , Anadarko Petroleum Corp , Pioneer Natural Resources Co , Apache Corp , and other large U.S.-focused oil and gas drillers used similar wording."
Exxon,2017-3,"Still, Obama's exit - and Trump's win over Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in November - has been enough to brighten the outlook of some big investors."
Exxon,2017-3,"""I believe the absence of a negative is a positive,"" John Dowd, who manages several energy funds at Fidelity Investments, wrote in his 2017 energy outlook. ""The market has been concerned with the sustainability of fracking, and particularly to what extent it might have been regulated into obscurity by a different election outcome."""
Exxon,2017-3,Clinton had said during her campaign that she planned to increase regulation on fracking.
Exxon,2017-3,"Other segments of the energy industry, such as coal mining and oil refining, were harder hit by environmental protection measures during Obama's presidency. Several coal companies went bankrupt in recent years and blamed Obama's climate change initiatives for raising costs and hurting demand."
Exxon,2017-3,Refiners have also long complained that environmental regulations have stymied attempts to build new refineries and that they have borne the brunt of costly rules requiring them to blend biofuels into their gasoline.
Exxon,2017-3,"The abundance of cheap natural gas is seen as the biggest obstacle to reviving coal country, since both fuels compete for space in the furnaces of U.S. power plants. For refiners, the key driver for profitability is the differential between the price of their raw material, crude oil, and the fuels they make with it."
Exxon,2017-3,"""Supply and demand are the fundamental forces driving markets,"" said Coglianese, the University of Pennsylvania law professor. ""Regulation is relatively trivial."""

Exxon,2017-3,{{20170323T012920.550+0000}}Major oil companies open their wallets in Gulf of Mexico biddingBy Ruthy Munoz
Exxon,2017-3,"HOUSTON, March 22 (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell plc, Chevron Corp and Exxon Mobil Corp signaled the oil industry's return to the Gulf of Mexico's deep waters with high bids in a government auction up 76 percent over a year ago."
Exxon,2017-3,"The auction of offshore oil and gas parcels received nearly $275 million in high bids, compared with $156.4 million a year ago. The year-ago auction drew the fourth lowest total bids for leases in the central Gulf."
Exxon,2017-3,"The oil industry had moved away from deep water projects as oil prices fell and regulatory scrutiny increased following the Deepwater Horizon disaster in April 2010, the largest accidental marine oil spill. The five-month-long spill, which spewed some 210 million U.S. gallons (780,000 m3) into the Gulf, caused extensive damage to marine and wildlife habitats, as well as to the area's fishing and tourism industries, forcing BP to sell assets worth of billions of dollars."
Exxon,2017-3,"Wednesday's auction was the first under President Donald Trump, who has promised to cut permitting and regulatory hurdles in support of energy exploration."
Exxon,2017-3,"Shell and Chevron each had 20 high bids, and Shell's $55.8 million total was the largest among the 26 companies submitting offers. Norway's Statoil ASA was the second-largest total bidder with $44.5 million, followed by Hess Corp , Chevron and Exxon."
Exxon,2017-3,"""Today's strong sale reflects continued industry optimism and interest in the Gulf's Outer Continental Shelf, Department of Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said in a statement."
Exxon,2017-3,"The highest bid on a single block this year, from Shell, was for $24 million, almost twice last year's $13.6 million top offer. Among other top bidders, Exxon submitted 19 high bids totaling nearly $22 million, and Anadarko Petroleum had 16 high bids totaling nearly $19 million."
Exxon,2017-3,The bids will be evaluated for the next 90 days by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management and winners disclosed following the review.
Exxon,2017-3,"Interest in new deep-water projects is heating up with more favorable costs for drilling rigs, services and production equipment. Shell has cut its well costs by at least 50 percent and reduced logistics costs by three quarters, helping make deep-water projects affordable at crude prices under $50 a barrel."
Exxon,2017-3,"Last month, the Anglo-Dutch oil giant gave final approval to go ahead with its Kaikias deep-water project in the Gulf. In December, BP said it planned to move ahead with a previously delayed expansion project known as Mad Dog Phase 2, the first new platform sanctioned for the Gulf in a year and a half."

Exxon,2017-3,"Cyprus announced the completion of a third round of licensing for well drilling in which Exxon Mobil , Italy's ENI and France's Total won additional blocks offshore. The contracts will be signed on April 5 and 6, but it has not yet been determined which blocks off Cyprus' coast the companies will drill, Lakkotrypis said."
Exxon,2017-3,"The minister said that while the country's current priority is ""exploration, exploration, exploration,"" he expected much more for Cyprus on the energy front."
Exxon,2017-3,"""Once we have the results of this exploration 2.0 as I called it, then of course there will be a fourth (round) and a fifth and a sixth and I'm sure there will be plenty more,"" Lakkotrypis told Reuters on the sidelines of Capital Link's Invest in Cyprus Forum in New York City."
Exxon,2017-3,"Additionally, ENI and Total will have additional wells on the already licensed block with ENI expected to begin work in late June or early July. ENI will also progress with ""a couple"" of wells this year, Lakkotrypis said. Exxon will be developing its well in 2018 with a number of exploration wells to take place in the coming years."
Exxon,2017-3,"Cyprus is seeking to develop its energy sector to bolster an economy that relies largely on tourism, business services and shipping. However efforts to expand the energy sector could be complicated by the island's division between Turkish Cypriots and Greek Cypriots."
Exxon,2017-3,"Turkey, which supports a breakaway Turkish Cypriot state in northern Cyprus and is highly influential there, says the Greek Cypriot-led government of the island has no right to explore for hydrocarbons."
Exxon,2017-3,Cyprus and Turkey do not have diplomatic relations and peace talks between Greek and Turkish Cypriots to reunite the island under a federal umbrella broke off abruptly in February.
Exxon,2017-3,Lakkotrypis said the government was committed to negotiating an agreement with Turkey but that its oil and gas development was not part of that discussion.

Exxon,2017-3,"The EITI, which was founded in 2003, and which the U.S. joined in 2014, sets a global standard for governments to disclose their revenues from oil, gas, and mining assets, and for companies to report payments made to obtain access to publicly owned resources, as well as other donations."
Exxon,2017-3,"""The (U.S. Interior) Department remains committed to the principles and goals of EITI including transparency and good governance of the extractive sectors...,"" Heather Swift, a spokesperson for Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, said in an email to Reuters."

Exxon,2017-3,* It also gives Saudi's more leverage over oil product prices
Exxon,2017-3,"SINGAPORE, March 20 (Reuters) - Saudi King Salman's lavish tour of Asia, arriving in each country on a golden escalator with 400 tonnes of luggage, had a hardnosed marketing mission - to cement the kingdom's place as leading oil supplier to the world's biggest consumer region."
Exxon,2017-3,"The string of deals inked on his three-week tour to Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan and China also point to a fresh strategy, one to increase Saudi leverage over refined product and petrochemical markets, known as the downstream sector."
Exxon,2017-3,"""Our strategy is about growth in the downstream,"" said Amin Nasser, chief executive officer of state oil company Aramco, told Reuters on Sunday. ""The growth in that sector is very important, and anything integrated between refining, petrochemical, with marketing and distribution, is of interest to us."""
Exxon,2017-3,"Saudi Arabia's main influence on oil markets has been via the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), of which it is the de-facto leader."
Exxon,2017-3,"But OPEC's ability to control prices by turning the oil pumping spigots on and off has waned as non-OPEC producers like Russia and, more recently, U.S. shale drillers, have ramped up output and eroded its grip on market share. [nL3N1GU1GS]"
Exxon,2017-3,"One indication of a shift in Saudi strategy came on the first leg of the tour in Kuala Lumpur. Aramco signed a deal to take a $7 billion investment, in a joint venture with Malaysia's state oil company Petronas in a refinery and petrochemical project known as RAPID (Refinery and Petrochemical Integrated Development).[nL3N1GD2WX]"
Exxon,2017-3,"Under construction in Malaysia's southern Johor state, RAPID is just across a narrow strait from Singapore, Asia's oil trading hub. Some 70 percent of the oil for the project, set to start in 2019, will come from Saudi Arabia, giving the kingdom a key outlet for its crude in Asia, the world's fastest growing market. It is one of Aramco's largest new refinery projects outside the kingdom."
Exxon,2017-3,"Aramco also recently made a deal with Indonesia's Pertamina over a $5 billion expansion of the country's largest oil refinery, for which Aramco will supply the crude."
Exxon,2017-3,"""The investments are intended to enhance Aramco's competitive position in Southeast Asia,"" said Ihsan Buhulaiga, a Saudi economist."
Exxon,2017-3,The Malaysian investment also allows the Saudis to join the hub of refineries in and around Singapore that help determine fuel prices in the region.
Exxon,2017-3,"Price agency S&P Global Platts assesses dozens of fuel products during a set time every day, based on deliveries in and out of this region. Platts calls it Market-on-Close, but traders dub it ""the window"", and it influences pricing of oil products worth billions of dollars each day."
Exxon,2017-3,"While crude and fuel products by many companies flow in and out of the pricing region, known as FOB Straits. But the only refineries now in this price region are operated by U.S. Exxon , Anglo-Dutch Royal Dutch Shell , and Singapore Petroleum Corp (SPC), owned by PetroChina <601857.SS>."
Exxon,2017-3,"""When you control refining capacity with the capability to deliver petroleum products into the window, you have access to a physical outlet which also plays a key role in daily price discovery,"" said John Driscoll, director of consultancy JTD Energy in Singapore."
Exxon,2017-3,The Saudi move deeper into refineries and petrochemical plants would likely help the potential valuation of Aramco in what could be the world's largest-ever initial public offering.
Exxon,2017-3,"Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who oversees the kingdom's economic policy, has said the sale is expected to value Aramco at $2 trillion or more. Analysts have estimated a valuation between $1 trillion and $1.5 trillion."
Exxon,2017-3,"Singapore, along with Hong Kong and Tokyo have been mentioned as possible exchanges where Aramco's shares would be traded. The primary listing will be on Saudi Arabia's domestic exchange, and Riyadh is also looking at New York or London for the secondary listing."
Exxon,2017-3,"Aramco's joint ventures in Malaysia, Indonesia and elsewhere are not only aimed at increasing its refining capacity. Its new deals in the region would also greatly increase its participation in the petrochemical sector, which involves all forms of plastics and where profits have soared thanks to strong demand."
Exxon,2017-3,"""We have capacity of about 5.4 million barrels per day of participated refining capacity, and our target is to reach 10 million barrels by 2030,"" Aramco's Nasser said."
Exxon,2017-3,"Ultimately, the big prize is China, where the Saudis signed deals that could be worth as much as $65 billion during the last leg of the king's Asian tour, covering energy, manufacturing and even a theme park in the kingdom."
Exxon,2017-3,The deals included a memorandum of understanding between Aramco and China North Industries Group Corp (Norinco) to look into building refining and petrochemical plants in China.
Exxon,2017-3,"John Sfakianakis, director of the Riyadh-based Gulf Research Centre, said that the trip was ""the beginning of a long-term strategy of Saudi Arabia to open itself to Asian investors and vice versa"" as part of its Vision 2030 policy to diversify its economy beyond crude exports."

Exxon,2017-3,"Aramco's joint ventures in Malaysia, Indonesia and elsewhere are not only aimed at increasing its refining capacity.

Exxon,2017-3,"SYDNEY, March 19 (Reuters) - Australia's minister for resources said on Sunday that the government would take action to avert an energy shortage if big gas producers did not boost supply for the country's domestic market."
Exxon,2017-3,"Australia is on track to become the world's largest exporter of liquefied natural gas (LNG), yet its energy market operator has warned of a domestic gas crunch from 2019 that could trigger industry supply cuts and broad power outages."
Exxon,2017-3,"Major gas producers, including Exxon Mobil Corp and Royal Dutch Shell , who have large export contracts, guaranteed to ensure gas was available for the domestic market during crisis talks with the government this week. [nL3N1GT12M]"
Exxon,2017-3,"""If the commitments are not met, if we don't see more gas, we'll act, we'll take decisions in our national interest to secure our nation's energy supplies,"" Resources Minister Matt Canavan, who was at the talks, told The ABC on Sunday."

Exxon,2017-3,Manufacturers have long complained of tight gas supplies and soaring prices as producers have focused on supplying gas to LNG plants that have locked in 20-year export contracts. Restrictions on drilling coal seam gas have added to supply constraints.
Exxon,2017-3,"Producers blame state drilling bans, uncertainty over Australia's climate policy and, more recently, potential increases in petroleum producer taxes, for deterring development of new gas fields."
Exxon,2017-3,"Canavan, who did not elaborate on what action would be taken, said the companies had given strong commitments to the government."

Exxon,2017-3,"PORT HARCOURT, Nigeria/LONDON, March 16 (Reuters) - The moment a group of Nigerian contractors met executives from Italian oil major Eni to discuss unpaid wages they started shouting, calling them fraudsters and liars until a police commander restored calm."
Exxon,2017-3,"Wenenda Mpi, local manager of Eni unit Agip, blamed the payment delays on debts owed by the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), a view shared by an Eni spokesman in Rome, and said the government had promised to sort the problem out."
Exxon,2017-3,"The heated meeting, called after hundreds of Eni contractors threatened a protest that police feared could turn violent, highlights the challenge of stabilising the Niger Delta oil region, even though attacks on oil facilities have halted."
Exxon,2017-3,"Militants were persuaded to stop the attacks by promises of more investment and jobs from visiting officials including Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, a technocrat who stood in for President Muhammadu Buhari this year while he had seven weeks of medical treatment in London."
Exxon,2017-3,That has helped restore output to close to its former level 2.2 million barrels a day (bpd) from the 1.15 million bpd it hit last year. But it is unclear how long the calm will last.
Exxon,2017-3,"Protests like that against Eni in the region's biggest city Port Harcourt are common, partly because low global oil prices mean oil firms are firing hundreds of workers and cutting back on contractors such as welders, security guards and cooks."
Exxon,2017-3,"The Eni contractors showed up on time at the city's police headquarters for the meeting brokered by a local police commander, and tempers were high by the time three Agip managers and the police boss arrived more than an hour later."
Exxon,2017-3,"""We are giving Agip a two week ultimatum to pay all outstanding debt,"" said Clement Adaminegbe, head of contractors at Agip, threatening unspecified further action. ""In case of failure we will take a clear stand."""
Exxon,2017-3,Mpi promised to look into the grievances but was shouted down by the workers until the Commissioner of Police Zaki Ahmed stepped in - persuading them to meet again next week in the presence of an Italian manager.
Exxon,2017-3,"""I want both parties to resolve the issue amicably,"" he said, addressing the stone-faced protesters at the meeting attended by a Reuters reporter."
Exxon,2017-3,"Since the start of the year, Vice President Osinbajo has been going back and forth to the swamp lands, promising to drag the region's population out of poverty with a bigger share of Nigeria's huge oil wealth."
Exxon,2017-3,"Residents say Osinbajo, a Christian like most in the southern region, has connected much better with them than Buhari, a Muslim from the north, who last year sent the army to hunt down militants and has only visited the region once."
Exxon,2017-3,"Osinbajo has proposed legalising illegal oil refineries to ensure employment for angry youths who often join militants, although a military campaign to hunt them down has continued."
Exxon,2017-3,The future of the fragile peace will depend on whether the government follows up on such proposals at a time when Africa's biggest economy is hit by its first recession in 25 years.
Exxon,2017-3,"State oil firm NNPC has been planning for two years to pay back funds owed to oil majors for joint oil operations. The government said in December a remaining $5.1 billion would be paid back in five years, a time scale which means tensions over payments on the ground will likely continue."
Exxon,2017-3,"An Eni spokesman said payment delays from NNPC had been accumulating for 15 years, but they expected repayments to resume this year."
Exxon,2017-3,"A spokesman for Eni said 90 percent of its Nigerian subsidiary's workforce were already based in the Delta. A spokesperson for Shell's Nigeria unit said they had no such plans, Chevron and Exxon declined to comment on any relocation."
Exxon,2017-3,"The oil swamps are home to 40 ethnic groups competing for a share of oil money, a major obstacle to reaching an agreement that would put a permanent end to attacks on oil facilities."
Exxon,2017-3,"Villages fight for contracts, forcing oil firms to recruit only their youth as guards or risk pipelines being blown up by rejected hires. Or they demand firms to buy food or cement from them and block passage of vehicles if they bring in supplies from other villages, oil workers say."
Exxon,2017-3,"""The issue of surveillance contracts is not working well, we will revisit it,"" the Agip manager said at the meeting, referring to security contracts with host communities."
Exxon,2017-3,"The protesters handed the Agip delegation a list of 16 demands including a cash payment of 10 million naira ($32,000) to ""demobilise"" the planned protest. They also want to get 60 percent of future work tendered by Agip. Eni said its contracts were awarded on a competitive basis."
Exxon,2017-3,"Officials have repeatedly visited the biggest Delta group of Ijaw from which the Niger Delta Avengers, the biggest militant group, recruits. That has not gone down well with other groups."
Exxon,2017-3,"""If the people of the upland part of the region are not treated with same level of respect as those in the creeks, there will never be security for the oil assets you so much cherish,"" the militant group Niger Delta Greenland Justice Mandate said in a statement last week."
Exxon,2017-3,Locals hope Buhari will allow Osinbajo to continue his peace efforts in the Niger Delta after he resumed work on Monday following his medical leave.
Exxon,2017-3,"""Osinbajo ... was working hard to return peace,"" said Austin Ozobo, a Delta activist.

Exxon,2017-3,"PORT HARCOURT, Nigeria/LONDON, March 16 (Reuters) - The moment a group of Nigerian contractors met executives from Italian oil major ENI to discuss unpaid wages they started shouting, calling them fraudsters and liars until a police commander restored calm."
Exxon,2017-3,"Wenenda Mpi, local manager of ENI unit Agip, blamed the payment delays on debts owed by the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) and said the government had promised to sort the problem out."
Exxon,2017-3,"The heated meeting, called after hundreds of ENI contractors threatened a protest that police feared could turn violent, highlights the challenge of stabilising the Niger Delta oil region, even though attacks on oil facilities have halted."
Exxon,2017-3,"Militants were persuaded to stop the attacks by promises of more investment and jobs from visiting officials including Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, a technocrat who stood in for President Muhammadu Buhari this year while he had seven weeks of medical treatment in London."
Exxon,2017-3,That has helped restore output to close to its former level 2.2 million barrels a day (bpd) from the 1.15 million bpd it hit last year. But it is unclear how long the calm will last.
Exxon,2017-3,"Protests like that against ENI in the region's biggest city Port Harcourt are common, partly because low global oil prices mean oil firms are firing hundreds of workers and cutting back on contractors such as welders, security guards and cooks."
Exxon,2017-3,"The ENI contractors showed up on time at the city's police headquarters for the meeting brokered by a local police commander, and tempers were high by the time three AGIP managers and the police boss arrived more than an hour later."
Exxon,2017-3,"""We are giving Agip a two week ultimatum to pay all outstanding debt,"" said Clement Adaminegbe, head of contractors at Agip, threatening unspecified further action. ""In case of failure we will take a clear stand."""
Exxon,2017-3,Mpi promised to look into the grievances but was shouted down by the workers until the Commissioner of Police Zaki Ahmed stepped in -- persuading them to meet again next week in the presence of an Italian manager.
Exxon,2017-3,"""I want both parties to resolve the issue amicably,"" he said, addressing the stone-faced protesters at the meeting attended by a Reuters reporter."
Exxon,2017-3,"Since the start of the year, vice president Osinbajo has been going back and forth to the swamps land, promising to drag the region's population out of poverty with a bigger share of Nigeria's huge oil wealth."
Exxon,2017-3,"Residents say Osinbajo, a Christian like most in the southern region, has connected much better with them than Buhari, a Muslim from the north, who last year sent the army to hunt down militants and has only visited the region once."
Exxon,2017-3,"Osinbajo has proposed legalising illegal oil refineries to ensure employment for angry youths who often join militants, although a military campaign to hunt them down has continued."
Exxon,2017-3,The future of the fragile peace will depend on whether the government follows up on such proposals at a time when Africa's biggest economy is hit by its first recession in 25 years.
Exxon,2017-3,"State oil firm NNPC has been planning for two years to pay back funds owed to oil majors for joint oil operations. The government said in December a remaining $5.1 billion would be paid back in five years, a time scale which means tensions over payments on the ground will likely continue."
Exxon,2017-3,"A spokesperson for Shell's Nigeria unit said they had no such plans, Chevron and Exxon declined to comment on any relocation and a spokesperson for ENI did not respond immediately to a request to comment."
Exxon,2017-3,"The oil swamps are home to 40 ethnic groups competing for a share of oil money, a major obstacle to reaching an agreement that would put a permanent end to attacks on oil facilities."
Exxon,2017-3,"Villages fight for contracts, forcing oil firms to recruit only their youth as guards or risk pipelines being blown up by rejected hires. Or they demand firms to buy food or cement from them and block passage of vehicles if they bring in supplies from other villages, oil workers say."
Exxon,2017-3,"""The issue of surveillance contracts is not working well, we will revisit it,"" the Agip manager said at the meeting, referring to security contracts with host communities."
Exxon,2017-3,"The protesters handed the Agip delegation a list of 16 demands including a cash payment of 10 million naira ($32,000) to ""demobilize"" the planned protest. They also want to get 60 percent of future work tendered by Agip."
Exxon,2017-3,"Officials have repeatedly visited the biggest Delta group of Ijaw from which the Niger Delta Avengers, the biggest militant group, recruits. That has not gone down well with other groups."
Exxon,2017-3,"""If the people of the upland part of the region are not treated with same level of respect as those in the creeks, there will never be security for the oil assets you so much cherish,"" the militant group Niger Delta Greenland Justice Mandate said in a media release last week."
Exxon,2017-3,Locals hope Buhari will allow Osinbajo to continue his peace efforts in the Niger Delta after he resumed work on Monday following his medical leave.
Exxon,2017-3,"""Osinbajo...was working hard to return peace,"" said Austin Ozobo, a Delta activist. ""Our fear is that things may get worse with the return of President Buhari, certain steps or modalities taken by the (former) acting President Osinbajo to restore peace in the region may be abandoned.""

Exxon,2017-3,"Shell, which runs the Queensland Curtis LNG plant (QCLNG) and is sitting on undeveloped coal seam gas in the state, said it has sold significant volumes into southeastern Australia."
Exxon,2017-3,"Diverting gas from LNG plants into the domestic market would be the easiest short-term solution, as two of the three LNG plants in Queensland - Shell's QCLNG and Origin and ConocoPhillips' Australia Pacific LNG (APLNG) - have some capacity that is not locked into export contracts."
Exxon,2017-3,"Turnbull said both QCLNG and APLNG had committed to being net suppliers to the domestic market, while Santos' Gladstone LNG, which is short of gas, had taken the request on notice."

Exxon,2017-3,"DALLAS/NEW YORK, March 14 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Carl Icahn's first big pitch as deregulation consigliere to the president has sparked accusations of cronyism. His proposed overhaul of the U.S. biofuels program would directly benefit one of his own companies. Such a conflict of interest should preclude his having a say, yet it's part of a pattern for a Trump administration devoted to fossil fuels."
Exxon,2017-3,"Icahn wants to change who is responsible for mixing the right amount of ethanol into petroleum. At present, it falls on refiners' shoulders. If they can't do it directly, they have to buy credits as offsets."
Exxon,2017-3,"It's a pet peeve for Icahn, who recently ranted about how the Environmental Protection Agency makes life difficult for refiners. He alleges speculators are driving up the cost of credits. But he's hardly objective in this case, owning 82 percent of refiner CVR Energy , which last year spent some $200 million on ethanol credits. Icahn's meddling raised complaints last week from public watchdog group Public Citizen."
Exxon,2017-3,Icahn's role is polluting the ethanol battle. Administration officials usually have to sell any holdings and even then may still have to recuse themselves on key issues - as former Exxon Mobil boss and current Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has over the Keystone XL pipeline. As an informal adviser Icahn is not held to such basic standards.

Exxon,2017-3,Jeffers said the company had provided 2.5 million pages of documents in response to a subpoena from Schneiderman's office and would respond to the claims in the letter in court filings.
Exxon,2017-3,"The letter, seen by Reuters, said Exxon had not previously disclosed the alias account. It asked the judge to order Exxon to explain whether documents from the ""Wayne Tracker"" email and 34 additional accounts assigned to other Exxon executives and board members had been preserved."
Exxon,2017-3,"The letter said that Exxon had produced some 60 documents bearing the ""Wayne Tracker"" email but never said it was used by Tillerson for relevant communications at Exxon."
Exxon,2017-3,It asked the court to order Exxon to identify whether any other email accounts were used by Tillerson.
Exxon,2017-3,"""Exxon's top executives, and in particular, Mr. Tillerson, have made multiple representations that are at the center of OAG's (attorney general's office) investigation of potentially false or misleading statements to investors and the public,"" the letter said."

Exxon,2017-3,"March 13 (Reuters) - The California Public Employees' Retirement System plans to be active in 17 proxy efforts on climate change directed at energy companies this proxy season, the pension fund's Chief Investment Officer Ted Eliopoulos said on Monday."
Exxon,2017-3,"CalPERS' effort will build on its actions over the past year, when it was active in 12 proxy efforts, to increase the percentage of votes in favor of climate change strategy disclosures."
Exxon,2017-3,"Eliopoulos said during an investment committee board meeting that CalPERS would ask energy companies over the next three months for ""disclosure of their climate change strategy, among other topics."""
Exxon,2017-3,"In order to ""drive the votes at those companies, we are building on our networks of peer engagement,"" said Eliopoulos."
Exxon,2017-3,The nation's largest public pension fund joined New York City pension chiefs last year to urge Exxon Mobil shareholders to back a measure that would force the company to detail how its business would be impacted as governments move to tackle climate change. [nL2N1881YY]

Exxon,2017-3,"HOUSTON, March 10 (Reuters) - Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Friday dismissed a recent string of major oil companies selling their holdings in the heavy oil sands of Western Canada and moving investments to shale fields."
Exxon,2017-3,"Royal Dutch Shell and Marathon Oil this week disclosed sales of operations that largely removed both firms from the carbon-heavy oil reserves. Shell is selling its interests to Canadian Natural Resources. Last month, Exxon Mobil wrote down all of its oil reserves from its Kearl project in northern Alberta, saying extracting the oil was no longer economic at current prices."
Exxon,2017-3,"In a wide-ranging media briefing, Trudeau said oil and gas executives are looking for greater clarity on regulations and pricing, arguing that the world is ready for a low-carbon economy. He also said Canada and the United States are working on border issues, including migration and trade."
Exxon,2017-3,Trudeau said a Canadian consensus on a carbon price to meet international climate change goals shows the nation can move forward on difficult issues.
Exxon,2017-3,"""The one thing I've heard consistently from leaders in the energy industry is the need for clarity in terms of what (the) frame of regulations, (and) pricing is going to be,"" he said."
Exxon,2017-3,"Promoting both renewable and conventional energy sources shows ""investments in Canada are sound investments, not just for short term, but for the long term,"" Trudeau said."" We're going to see many people interested in partnering in drawing on Canadians' great natural resources."""
Exxon,2017-3,"Referring to a U.S. proposal for a tax on imports to stimulate job creation, which his government opposes, Trudeau cautioned that details are still lacking, and agreement is far from assured."
Exxon,2017-3,"""Anything that creates extra barriers and impediments to the smooth flow of goods will hurt our business and hurt our workers and limit our capacity to be competitive,"" he said, repeating his objections to a U.S. border tax."
Exxon,2017-3,"Asked about potential repercussions if a tax were imposed, Trudeau said his government would seek to protect the country's export jobs and ""stand up for the values we hold dear."""
Exxon,2017-3,"The United States and Canada are engaged at several levels, he said, including on trade, refugees and immigration. The country's minister of public safety is meeting with the U.S. secretary of Homeland Security on border issues, he said, adding that Canada is not skimping on border security."
Exxon,2017-3,"Work also is continuing on gaining pre-clearance approvals to allow more Canadians to pass U.S. customs reviews while still on Canadian soil, he said, speeding up travel between the two countries."

Exxon,2017-3,"HOUSTON, March 10 (Reuters) - Deepwater oil drilling can be expensive, time-consuming and a hard sell to investors. But the world's top energy firms are restarting their search for giant oilfields under the ocean after a two-year lull."
Exxon,2017-3,A recovery in oil prices to about $50 a barrel from a 12-year low in 2016 is reviving oil majors' appetite for risk. [nL1N1G9171]
Exxon,2017-3,"Reductions in offshore production costs mean that some projects may be able to compete with North American shale fields, executives said at an energy conference in Houston this week."
Exxon,2017-3,"The recovery in the industry has so far been focused on onshore shale output from the largest U.S. oilfield, the Permian Basin."
Exxon,2017-3,"""Our competition over the past years has evolved from 'we want to be the best in deepwater' to 'we want to compete with shale' to 'we want to beat the Permian',"" Wael Sawan, Royal Dutch Shell's executive vice president for deepwater, said in an interview."
Exxon,2017-3,"Shell is the largest deepwater producer among the world's top publicly traded oil companies and is set to pump 900,000 barrels per day (bpd) from such projects by the end of the decade."
Exxon,2017-3,"Firms such as Shell and Exxon Mobil , who specialize in complex offshore exploration, slashed budgets after oil prices collapsed in 2014. Spending cuts were so drastic that the Paris-based International Energy Agency warned this week of a looming supply crunch beyond 2020.[nL5N1GJ3H6]"
Exxon,2017-3,"Shell has cut well costs by at least 50 percent, reduced logistics cost by three quarters and cut staff by nearly a third to make developments in areas such as the Gulf of Mexico and Nigeria profitable at oil prices below $40 a barrel, on par with the most profitable shale wells, Sawan said."
Exxon,2017-3,Other companies such as France's Total have seen similar cost cuts.
Exxon,2017-3,"After cutting the cost of deepwater development, companies are also reviving the search for new resources."
Exxon,2017-3,"They are focusing exploration efforts on areas close to existing fields to maximize the chances of discovery and minimize costs. Many such areas are in Brazil, the Gulf of Mexico and Southeast Asia."
Exxon,2017-3,"Some firms are poised to benefit from decreased competition, lower costs of marine seismic studies and drilling rigs, and cheaper opportunities to acquire exploration licences from governments eager to attract investment."
Exxon,2017-3,"""Right now, we've entered the best time in the last decade to be in the exploration business,"" Gregory Hebertson, who heads Murphy's western hemisphere exploration, said at the CERAWeek conference in Houston. ""There is probably a two- or three-year window that we can capture the cost efficiency in the market."""
Exxon,2017-3,"Discovering new resources is essential for oil firms to grow and to offset natural decline of fields. But deepwater exploration requires money, time, expertise - and luck."
Exxon,2017-3,"Some shareholders would prefer that oil firms stick to other, less risky growth options, said Federico Arisi Rota, executive vice president Americas for Italy's Eni, which operates major offshore drilling projects."
Exxon,2017-3,"""We must compete with alternative growth options that might be considered more attractive,"" such as growth through mergers and acquisitions or investing in shale oil production, Rota said."
Exxon,2017-3,Pressure to limit company spending amid a slow recovery in oil prices is also putting a break on big exploration campaigns.

Exxon,2017-3,"LONDON, March 10 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Saudi Aramco is in danger of undermining its own cash call. The state-owned oil giant is preparing to launch the world's biggest initial public offering, targeting a valuation of $2 trillion - almost six times bigger than the value of the world's largest publically traded oil company, ExxonMobil . Yet concurrent plans to pump cash into what could prove to be a series of white elephants should have investors arguing for a discount."
Exxon,2017-3,"There are two problems. First, they have so far failed to tackle joblessness: youth unemployment is high and comparable to rates in poor sub-Saharan African countries at 30 percent of the workforce, according to World Bank figures. Spending on imports fell by just 2 percent in 2015 despite decades of investment into building domestic industrial capacity."
Exxon,2017-3,"Aramco's workforce is still only about two-thirds the size of its international peer Royal Dutch Shell , which has 93,000 employees. Hence it may not display all the bloated inefficiency characteristic of state-dominated groups. But if it persists with quixotic social engineering, investors will start with the $2 trillion valuation and apply a white elephant discount."
Exxon,2017-3,"- Saudi Aramco plans to develop an industrial city in the eastern part of Saudi Arabia, focusing on energy related activities, the state-owned oil producer's vice president for procurement said on March 7."
Exxon,2017-3,"- Aramco will invest 16.5 billion riyals ($4.4 billion) into the new industrial area, Abdulaziz al-Abdulkarim said. The scheme is part of a government plan to create more domestic jobs for its energy industry. The kingdom is in the process of reforming its economy with the aim of reducing dependence on oil exports."

Exxon,2017-3,A recovery in oil prices to about $50 a barrel from a 12-year low in 2016 is reviving oil majors' appetite for risk. [nL1N1G9171]
Exxon,2017-3,"Reductions in offshore production costs mean that some projects may be able to compete with North American shale fields, executives said at an energy conference in Houston this week."
Exxon,2017-3,"The recovery in the industry has so far been focused on onshore shale output from the largest U.S. oilfield, the Permian Basin."
Exxon,2017-3,"""Our competition over the past years has evolved from 'we want to be the best in deepwater' to 'we want to compete with shale' to 'we want to beat the Permian',"" Wael Sawan, Royal Dutch Shell's executive vice president for deepwater, said in an interview."

Exxon,2017-3,"Firms such as Shell and Exxon Mobil , who specialize in complex offshore exploration, slashed budgets after oil prices collapsed in 2014.

Exxon,2017-3,"Shell has cut well costs by at least 50 percent, reduced logistics cost by three quarters and cut staff by nearly a third to make developments in areas such as the Gulf of Mexico and Nigeria profitable at oil prices below $40 a barrel, on par with the most profitable shale wells, Sawan said."
Exxon,2017-3,Other companies such as France's Total have seen similar cost cuts.
Exxon,2017-3,"After cutting the cost of deepwater development, companies are also reviving the search for new resources."
Exxon,2017-3,"They are focusing exploration efforts on areas close to existing fields to maximize the chances of discovery and minimize costs. Many such areas are in Brazil, the Gulf of Mexico and Southeast Asia."
Exxon,2017-3,"Some firms are poised to benefit from decreased competition, lower costs of marine seismic studies and drilling rigs, and cheaper opportunities to acquire exploration licences from governments eager to attract investment."
Exxon,2017-3,"""Right now, we've entered the best time in the last decade to be in the exploration business,"" Gregory Hebertson, who heads Murphy's western hemisphere exploration, said at the CERAWeek conference in Houston. ""There is probably a two- or three-year window that we can capture the cost efficiency in the market."""
Exxon,2017-3,"Discovering new resources is essential for oil firms to grow and to offset natural decline of fields. But deepwater exploration requires money, time, expertise - and luck."
Exxon,2017-3,"Some shareholders would prefer that oil firms stick to other, less risky growth options, said Federico Arisi Rota, executive vice president Americas for Italy's Eni, which operates major offshore drilling projects."
Exxon,2017-3,"""We must compete with alternative growth options that might be considered more attractive,"" such as growth through mergers and acquisitions or investing in shale oil production, Rota said."

Exxon,2017-3,"CARACAS, March 9 (Reuters) - A World Bank tribunal's order for Venezuela to pay $1.4 billion in damages to Exxon Mobil Corp over nationalizations has been annulled, a lawyer for the Venezuelan government said on Thursday."
Exxon,2017-3,The case at the World Bank's International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes is one of many arising from nationalizations during late President Hugo Chavez's 1999-2013 rule of the South American OPEC member country.
Exxon,2017-3,"""We were confident all along that our position was correct and are very pleased that the annulment committee agreed,"" Venezuela's lawyer George Kahale said."
Exxon,2017-3,A reduction to the overall $1.6 billion award would be welcome news to President Nicolas Maduro's cash-strapped government as it faces heavy foreign debt repayments amid a deep economic recession that has led to widespread shortages.
Exxon,2017-3,"The ICSID ruling, dated Thursday, said ""portions of the award"" were annulled but did not give a breakdown of figures."
Exxon,2017-3,"A spokesman for the U.S.-based oil company, Todd Spitler, did not confirm financial details, but said: ""Exxon Mobil will continue to evaluate its legal rights and determine next steps."""
Exxon,2017-3,"Venezuela had challenged the 2014 award with various arguments, including that a previous decision from Paris-based International Chamber of Commerce to award Exxon $908 million should be deducted from the ICSID award."
Exxon,2017-3,"Chavez, the firebrand socialist leader whose rule was cut short by death from cancer, nationalized a range of oil ventures, including the Cerro Negro heavy crude project and a smaller project called La Ceiba, both operated by Exxon."
Exxon,2017-3,"Despite its appeal of the World Bank court's initial ruling in the Exxon case, Venezuela's government had hailed that as a success because the company had been seeking compensation of up to $10 billion."
Exxon,2017-3,"Chavez led a wave of takeovers that also encompassed the electricity, telecoms, metal and agricultural sectors. Many companies deemed the takeovers unlawful, and Venezuela faces more than 20 international arbitration cases."

Exxon,2017-3,March 8 (Reuters) - Top shale oil producers are lifting their crude and gas reserve estimates for the first time in two years - even as many major oil companies are cutting the same projections and taking write downs on more expensive fields.
Exxon,2017-3,Rising confidence in the growth prospects of the U.S. shale patch is in striking contrast to the retreat of the world's top oil firms from the high-cost oil sands of Canada.
Exxon,2017-3,"The increase in reported shale reserves is driven by new drilling efficiencies, leaner operations and improved well completion techniques, industry experts said."
Exxon,2017-3,"""Many wells that were not profitable a year ago have become profitable"" because those advances have cut the cost of producing from shale, said Per Magnus Nysveen, a senior partner at consultancy Rystad Energy."
Exxon,2017-3,"The top 20 U.S. shale firms - a group that includes Pioneer Natural Resources Co and Chesapeake Energy Corp, - hiked their proved oil reserves by nearly 7 percent on average in 2016, according to a Reuters review of year-end financial filings."
Exxon,2017-3,"While shale producers reap the benefits of technological advances, oil majors that bet billions of dollars on giant long-term projects in Canada have taken a hit."
Exxon,2017-3,"On Thursday, Royal Dutch Shell plc became the latest energy giant to quit on oil sands. Shell said it would remove 2 billion barrels of oil from its reserves and take a $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion after-tax impairment in a retreat from most of its Canadian oil sands operations. [nL5N1GM1VZ]"
Exxon,2017-3,Exxon Mobil Corp and ConocoPhillips last month reported total reductions of nearly 5 billion barrels of proved reserves from oil sands projects after deciding they could not be pumped at current prices.
Exxon,2017-3,"Overall, the 10 U.S. oil companies with the largest holdings in conventional oil fields reduced their reserves by 13.4 percent in 2016, according to a Reuters' analysis of year-end regulatory filings."
Exxon,2017-3,"In 2015, the same shale firms, a group which do not operate in conventional oil fields, reported that proved reserves had fallen by 13 percent on average as low oil prices made many fields unprofitable."
Exxon,2017-3,Firms operating in shale oil fields use hydraulic fracturing to tap oil in rock formations that cannot be accessed by conventional drilling methods.
Exxon,2017-3,The reserves reflect oil and gas that can be profitably tapped in the next five years and are valued by investors as a measure of future revenue growth. Greater reserves also can give the companies more borrowing power.
Exxon,2017-3,"The 2016 shale reserve gains, while modest, came as conventional drillers were paring back their own estimates as oil prices remain below the levels needed to make output from higher cost fields profitable. The cost of pumping a barrel of oil from Canada's oil sands is much higher than the cost of producing oil from shale."
Exxon,2017-3,The reported 2016 increases in shale reserves are based on U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rules and use an average West Texas Intermediate oil price of $42.75 per barrel in 2016.
Exxon,2017-3,"The oil price on Thursday fell below $50 per barrel amid worries about growing crude inventories, especially from shale producers."
Exxon,2017-3,"Shale producers' reported natural gas reserves were based on a $2.49 per million British Thermal Units (MMBtu) average price in 2016, down from $2.58 a year earlier."
Exxon,2017-3,"Recent production increases from U.S. shale fields have rattled OPEC producers aiming to pare global crude inventories. In remarks to industry executives at an energy conference in Houston this week, Saudi Oil Minister Khalid al-Falih warned that OPEC won't accept shale oil rivals getting ""free rides"" from its production cutbacks."
Exxon,2017-3,"The implied threat was that OPEC could reverse the output cuts, which took effect in January, and flood the world market with oil, kicking off another price war. The curbs have boosted oil prices and in turn revived the shale industry in the United States after a two-year downturn."
Exxon,2017-3,"The technological improvements in shale fields include the ability to drill further into the earth, both vertically and horizontally, creating more underground sites in each well for hydraulic fracturing."
Exxon,2017-3,"""Reserve growth really comes down to better well design,"" said Michael Dynan, vice president for portfolio and strategic development at Schramm, a manufacturer of drilling rigs."
Exxon,2017-3,Such changes are helping oil firms tap more oil and gas while keeping spending low. Continental Resources Inc says it found twice the reserves per dollar spent in 2016 than in 2014.
Exxon,2017-3,"More recently, producers have also embraced big data analysis techniques that are providing ""a lot of insight into how best to drill a well, where to locate a well and the fracking techniques to use,"" said Binu Mathew, who heads digital products at GE Oil & Gas, which is merging with Baker Hughes Inc ."
Exxon,2017-3,"Such advances are only the beginning of the shale oil industry's efforts to wring more oil from wells for less money, said Stephen Ingram, southern region director of Halliburton Co's completion and production business."
Exxon,2017-3,Another factor in aiding reserves is the sharp decline last year in fees charged by oilfield service suppliers.
Exxon,2017-3,"Oilfield service firms are looking to take back some of the discounts they extended during the downturn, but shale producers say they expect to hold the line on expenses as they continue to expand production. [nL1N1G12BF]"
Exxon,2017-3,"Some of the reported gains in reserves are coming from un-drilled acreage, which makes them less certain. At least six of the companies Reuters analyzed reported a rise in proved reserves based on undeveloped properties in 2016."
Exxon,2017-3,"Investors have increasing faith in the profit potential of such undeveloped properties, however."
Exxon,2017-3,"""Confidence is very high that they are going to be turned into proved, producing assets,"" said Todd Heltman, a senior energy analyst at investment firm Neuberger Berman."
Exxon,2017-3,"Still, some investors worry that shale firms are becoming too aggressive about booking undeveloped reserves."
Exxon,2017-3,"""There is no geological risk here, but if your wells don't live up to your expectations, you have negative reserve revisions,"" said Bill Costello, a portfolio manager at Westwood Holdings Group, referring to downgrading proved reserves to uneconomic-to-tap categories."

Exxon,2017-3,"The deal will put Exxon in charge of developing one of the world's biggest new sources of LNG after trailing peers such as Royal Dutch Shell , which is doubling-down on the growth potential of gas as the world switches to cleaner-burning fuels."
Exxon,2017-3,"""This strategic investment will enable ExxonMobil's LNG leadership and experience to support development of Mozambique's abundant natural gas resources,"" Exxon Chairman and CEO Darren Woods said in a statement on Thursday."
Exxon,2017-3,"The deal shows energy groups are still willing to invest in new production when the stakes are high enough, despite spending cuts put in place to offset the oil price slide."
Exxon,2017-3,It will also give Mozambique the chance to transform itself from one of the world's poorest countries into a wealthier state and a major global LNG exporter.
Exxon,2017-3,"With billions of dollars tied up in developing its giant Zohr gas find in Egypt, Eni will also benefit from Exxon's deep-pockets and track-record of delivering complex LNG plants in remote areas on time and to budget."
Exxon,2017-3,"The state-controlled company, which is selling down stakes in some of its prize discoveries to help fund growth and support dividends, has raised more than $9 billion in the last four years from disposals."
Exxon,2017-3,"In 2013, Eni sold 20 percent of its Area 4 stake to China's CNPC for $4.2 billion but since then oil and gas prices have come down sharply."
Exxon,2017-3,"""Mozambique is going to be one of the world's largest gas hubs in the next 10-15 years and Exxon has to be there,"" Mediobanca oil analyst Alessandro Pozzi said."
Exxon,2017-3,"Under the deal, Eni will continue to lead all upstream operations in Area 4, while Exxon will be in charge of building the onshore LNG plants."
Exxon,2017-3,"Eni, which has previously estimated overall investments at around $50 billion, said it would remain in charge of building the floating LNG plant in the Coral field, part of Area 4."
Exxon,2017-3,Talks to bring on board a technically-savvy partner like Exxon have dragged on for months due to differences over valuations due to falling oil and gas prices.
Exxon,2017-3,"Last year, sources told Reuters Eni had wrapped up the deal with Exxon but it would not be announced for several months at Exxon's request. [nL8N1AM34L]"

Exxon,2017-3,"HOUSTON, March 8 (Reuters) - Financially strapped oil producers are spending billions to boost production before it's clear that recent crude price gains brought on by OPEC output cuts can be sustained."
Exxon,2017-3,"Five of the largest publicly traded oil companies - BP , Chevron , Exxon Mobil , Royal Dutch Shell , and Total - are trying to work down debts that totaled $297 billion at the end of December. That nearly doubled the companies' 2012 debt levels."
Exxon,2017-3,"But even with oil prices about 70 percent higher than a year ago, most companies have yet to reach the point where their cash flow covers annual shareholder payouts and expansion projects vital to the industry's long-term survival."
Exxon,2017-3,"Add other expenses, such as the interest on debt, and the break-even point is pushed out until at least 2020, industry analysts from Citigroup estimated."
Exxon,2017-3,"""For the entire oil and gas industry, balance sheets have never been worse,"" said Fadel Gheit, an Oppenheimer & Co oil industry analyst. Producers, he said, ""were in critical condition and have been upgraded to guarded."""
Exxon,2017-3,"For now, U.S. producers are taking advantage of the price increase spurred by OPEC's production cuts to boost their output. Some of the oil they are pumping would not have been profitable at $40 a barrel, but is with prices holding steady above $50."
Exxon,2017-3,"The industry is betting that prices will maintain a delicate balance - high enough to repair balance sheets and finance new projects, but not so high that it creates a new glut."
Exxon,2017-3,"If crude maintains a price in the mid-$50s per barrel, the biggest oil producers could see their cash flows increase by 71 percent on average over 2016, according to Citigroup."
Exxon,2017-3,"The danger is that too many wells could come back online too soon, undercutting OPEC's effort to reduce global inventories. That could send prices back to the 12-year lows of early 2016."
Exxon,2017-3,"U.S. shale producers in March are forecast to pump 79,000 barrels a day (bpd) more than in February, when shale contributed about 4.75 million bpd to U.S. output, according to the U.S. Energy Information Agency, reversing production declines last year. [nL1N1FE5NT]"
Exxon,2017-3,"Shale output could rise more than 500,000 bpd by the end of the year, said Daniel Yergin, vice chairman of analysis firm IHS Markit and an oil historian."
Exxon,2017-3,"""U.S. shale has demonstrated that it's still a player,"" Yergin said in an interview. ""It's going to continue to be a major factor in the global market."""
Exxon,2017-3,"Most majors are planning strong production growth until at least 2021, a Reuters analysis of the latest investor presentation and corporate plans showed."
Exxon,2017-3,"The firms - Royal Dutch Shell, Exxon Mobil, Chevron, BP, Total, Statoil and Eni - plan to grow output by a combined 15 percent in the next five years.[nL5N1GJ31I][nL5N1GJ31I]"
Exxon,2017-3,"It could take another year before the biggest companies' cash from operations exceeds their combined capital spending and dividends, Citigroup estimated. It projects the major oil producers will need to sell their oil for between $55 and $60 per barrel this year just to cover those two big costs."
Exxon,2017-3,"Chevron Corp, which expects positive cash flow this year, says it could generate an additional $3.5 billion selling its oil at $55 a barrel, a figure predicted to be 2017's average price in a Reuters poll of analysts and economists. [O/POLL]"
Exxon,2017-3,"Exxon Mobil Corp and BP have signaled they will spend more on expansion projects this year than in 2016, a sign of optimism about stronger pricing.[nL1N1FL0M7][nL5N1FS16K]"
Exxon,2017-3,"Higher production could deliver fresh money that can be used to hire workers, reduce debt or boost shareholder payouts."
Exxon,2017-3,"It would also be a welcome turn for an industry that has been spending more cash than it generates and borrowing to pay dividends that shareholders expect, regardless of the state of the industry."
Exxon,2017-3,"John Watson, Chevron's chief executive, said in late January he wants to ""maintain and grow"" the oil giant's dividend, calling it his top priority."
Exxon,2017-3,"Chevron is winding down construction of several big projects, helping to stem its past spending rate and generate more revenue as new operations come online."
Exxon,2017-3,"France's Total SA is raising its dividend by 1.6 percent this year, the first time in three years, and says it expects to cover its capital spending and cash dividend with oil above $50 a barrel.[nL5N1FU1JC]"
Exxon,2017-3,"The gains are driven largely by the OPEC output cut in November - the first in eight years. The agreement to reduce supply by about 1.8 million barrels a day runs through June, and OPEC and Russia are expected to review the cut in May."
Exxon,2017-3,"Some analysts expect the agreement to be extended, but the cartel could just as easily resume higher production, squelching the industry's nascent financial recovery.[nL8N1G737L]"
Exxon,2017-3,"Torgrim Reitan, head of U.S. operations for Statoil - Norway's state-owned firm - said he has ""stopped guessing"" what OPEC might do in crafting the company's plans."
Exxon,2017-3,"""We need to be prepared for volatility,"" he said in an interview at the CERAWeek energy conference in Houston. ""This is the time for leadership in the oil industry, the time for making the right decisions that will fuel growth."""
Exxon,2017-3,"Unlike the major producers, U.S. shale companies are better equipped to live with volatility. When prices rise, they ramp up drilling and lock in returns with price hedges, which Chevron, Exxon and other large producers typically don't do."
Exxon,2017-3,"When prices fall, shale producers can more easily cut spending than the majors because of their small size."
Exxon,2017-3,Shale producers' ability to pour more of their new cash into production is feeding technology developments that allow them to squeeze more oil out of existing wells and at a faster pace than a few years ago.[nL1N1DU2DQ]
Exxon,2017-3,"""Those who withstood the storm and survived have learned just how nimble they can be,"" said Avi Mirman, chief executive of Lilis Energy Inc , a shale oil producer in west Texas."
Exxon,2017-3,"Similar approaches are belatedly being adopted by the biggest producers. Chevron is embracing a short-cycle approach to investing in projects that can go into production in months, not years."
Exxon,2017-3,"However, Alastair Syme, who tracks global oil and gas companies for Citigroup, cautions the continued cost reductions by shale producers could thwart OPEC's ability to prop oil prices through production cuts, undercutting the cash flows needed to rebuild."
Exxon,2017-3,"""If shale producers can grow U.S. supply at between 1 million and 1.5 million barrels a day, it'll be a challenge for everyone to respond to that,"" he said in an interview."

Exxon,2017-3,"LONDON, March 7 (Reuters) - Oil industry costs are notoriously pro-cyclical, which is one of the main reasons for the pattern of boom and bust that has afflicted in the industry from the beginning."
Exxon,2017-3,"The cost of everything from skilled and unskilled labour to engineering contracts, field services, raw materials, equipment, spare parts and rig hire tends to rise and fall with price of oil."
Exxon,2017-3,"During a boom, prices for labour and equipment escalate rapidly, pushing up the breakeven cost of finding and developing new deposits, and driving the market-clearing price of oil even higher."
Exxon,2017-3,"In a bust, labour and equipment prices fall sharply, pushing down breakeven costs and helping sustain production at an unexpectedly high level despite the plunge in oil prices."
Exxon,2017-3,"Pro-cyclical costs include everything from skilled petroleum engineers and unskilled labour, to fuel, rig hire and drill bits."
Exxon,2017-3,"Pro-cyclical costs apply to a host of other services in the supply chain including catering, accommodation and transportation."
Exxon,2017-3,"And in the broadest sense, pro-cyclical costs include taxes, royalties and other government charges on exploration and production."
Exxon,2017-3,"In a downturn, governments cut tax and royalty rates, and offer regulatory relief, to attract investment, only to increase them again during a boom to capture windfall gains."
Exxon,2017-3,The pro-cyclical behaviour of costs is a classic example of positive feedback which amplifies the boom-bust cycle in oil prices and delays the process of adjustment following a supply or demand shock.
Exxon,2017-3,"Pro-cyclical costs ensure crude supply tends to respond sluggishly to even a big change in oil prices (""Oil prices: volatility and prediction"", Reuters, 2016)."
Exxon,2017-3,Rising costs hampered efforts to boost oil production during the 2004-2014 boom; more recently falling costs have hampered efforts to cut output and rebalance the market during the slump.
Exxon,2017-3,"The best symbol of the industry's cost cycle is the provision of free fruit to employees at BP's giant Sunbury campus near London (""Operational excellence becomes oil industry watchword (again)"", Reuters, 2015)."
Exxon,2017-3,"Free fruit tends to be axed when oil prices fall, only to return when prices rise, as the company's priority switches between cost control and employee morale."
Exxon,2017-3,Free fruit is a trivial example but multiplied up by thousands of items in the supply chain it shows how the entire cost structure can rise and fall by tens of billions of dollars per year.
Exxon,2017-3,The recent slump in oil prices has been accompanied by brutal cost-cutting across the entire oil and gas industry.
Exxon,2017-3,"Cheaper prices for everything from drilling contracts to labour, fracking sand, pressure pumping and freight have helped lower breakeven prices for U.S. shale producers."
Exxon,2017-3,"Similar cost reduction strategies have been implemented by state-owned oil companies such as Saudi Aramco as well as major privately-owned companies such as Exxon , Shell and BP."
Exxon,2017-3,"As a result, breakeven prices for the entire oil industry from OPEC to shale and offshore producers have tumbled since 2014."
Exxon,2017-3,The critical question is how much of this reduction is structural and permanent versus how much is cyclical and will be reversed as oil prices start to recover.
Exxon,2017-3,Oil industry leaders insist this time will be different and that they will maintain tight control over expenses even as oil prices rise.
Exxon,2017-3,Some of the efficiency improvements wrung from the supply chain during the slump are likely to prove enduring.
Exxon,2017-3,"Standardisation of equipment and procedures, as well as better targeting of production zones, longer lateral sections in wells, and multilayer wells are improvements that will not be unlearned."
Exxon,2017-3,"Past experience indicates, however, that costs have a large cyclical component and will start to increase as producers shift from contraction to expansion."
Exxon,2017-3,"Changes in drilling costs, for example, have been closely associated with changes in the number of rigs drilling for oil and gas."
Exxon,2017-3,"U.S. drilling prices were down 7 percent in January 2017 compared with January 2016, according to preliminary data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics."
Exxon,2017-3,"Fracking sand prices have already surged, owing to a combination of poor weather, supply problems and a big increase in consumption."
Exxon,2017-3,"Oilfield service company leaders have warned contract prices have been cut to unsustainably low levels and must increase, at least in the United States."
Exxon,2017-3,"For the time being, oil industry buyers will continue to hold the upper hand in negotiations, but the balance will shift as the industry returns to expansion mode."
Exxon,2017-3,"And as the balance of pricing power shifts, costs will begin to escalate, and the industry's estimated breakevens are also likely to increase."
Exxon,2017-3,Pro-cyclical costs are a fundamental rather than incidental feature of the supply chain and there is no reason to believe that will change.
Exxon,2017-3,"Appeals for cost discipline may work in the short term, but in the medium term they are no more likely to be successful than in the past."

Exxon,2017-3,"The CERAWeek event kicked off with a gushing letter from the White House praising Exxon Mobil for its plan, originally unveiled in 2013 and curiously touted again on Monday, to invest and hire in America. President Donald Trump might have been less pleased, however, with other remarks by Darren Woods, the company's new chief executive."

Exxon,2017-3,"LONDON, March 7 (Reuters) - Oil industry costs are notoriously pro-cyclical, which is one of the main reasons for the pattern of boom and bust that has afflicted in the industry from the beginning."
Exxon,2017-3,"The cost of everything from skilled and unskilled labour to engineering contracts, field services, raw materials, equipment, spare parts and rig hire tends to rise and fall with price of oil."
Exxon,2017-3,"During a boom, prices for labour and equipment escalate rapidly, pushing up the breakeven cost of finding and developing new deposits, and driving the market-clearing price of oil even higher."
Exxon,2017-3,"In a bust, labour and equipment prices fall sharply, pushing down breakeven costs and helping sustain production at an unexpectedly high level despite the plunge in oil prices."
Exxon,2017-3,"Pro-cyclical costs include everything from skilled petroleum engineers and unskilled labour, to fuel, rig hire and drill bits."
Exxon,2017-3,"Pro-cyclical costs apply to a host of other services in the supply chain including catering, accommodation and transportation."
Exxon,2017-3,"And in the broadest sense, pro-cyclical costs include taxes, royalties and other government charges on exploration and production."
Exxon,2017-3,"In a downturn, governments cut tax and royalty rates, and offer regulatory relief, to attract investment, only to increase them again during a boom to capture windfall gains."
Exxon,2017-3,The pro-cyclical behaviour of costs is a classic example of positive feedback which amplifies the boom-bust cycle in oil prices and delays the process of adjustment following a supply or demand shock.
Exxon,2017-3,"Pro-cyclical costs ensure crude supply tends to respond sluggishly to even a big change in oil prices (""Oil prices: volatility and prediction"", Reuters, 2016)."
Exxon,2017-3,Rising costs hampered efforts to boost oil production during the 2004-2014 boom; more recently falling costs have hampered efforts to cut output and rebalance the market during the slump.
Exxon,2017-3,"The best symbol of the industry's cost cycle is the provision of free fruit to employees at BP's giant Sunbury campus near London (""Operational excellence becomes oil industry watchword (again)"", Reuters, 2015)."
Exxon,2017-3,"Free fruit tends to be axed when oil prices fall, only to return when prices rise, as the company's priority switches between cost control and employee morale."
Exxon,2017-3,Free fruit is a trivial example but multiplied up by thousands of items in the supply chain it shows how the entire cost structure can rise and fall by tens of billions of dollars per year.
Exxon,2017-3,The recent slump in oil prices has been accompanied by brutal cost-cutting across the entire oil and gas industry.
Exxon,2017-3,"Cheaper prices for everything from drilling contracts to labour, fracking sand, pressure pumping and freight have helped lower breakeven prices for U.S. shale producers."
Exxon,2017-3,"Similar cost reduction strategies have been implemented by state-owned oil companies such as Saudi Aramco as well as major privately-owned companies such as Exxon , Shell and BP."
Exxon,2017-3,"As a result, breakeven prices for the entire oil industry from OPEC to shale and offshore producers have tumbled since 2014."
Exxon,2017-3,The critical question is how much of this reduction is structural and permanent versus how much is cyclical and will be reversed as oil prices start to recover.
Exxon,2017-3,Oil industry leaders insist this time will be different and that they will maintain tight control over expenses even as oil prices rise.
Exxon,2017-3,Some of the efficiency improvements wrung from the supply chain during the slump are likely to prove enduring.
Exxon,2017-3,"Standardisation of equipment and procedures, as well as better targeting of production zones, longer lateral sections in wells, and multilayer wells are improvements that will not be unlearned."
Exxon,2017-3,"Past experience indicates, however, that costs have a large cyclical component and will start to increase as producers shift from contraction to expansion."
Exxon,2017-3,"Changes in drilling costs, for example, have been closely associated with changes in the number of rigs drilling for oil and gas."
Exxon,2017-3,"U.S. drilling prices were down 7 percent in January 2017 compared with January 2016, according to preliminary data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics."
Exxon,2017-3,"Fracking sand prices have already surged, owing to a combination of poor weather, supply problems and a big increase in consumption."
Exxon,2017-3,"Oilfield service company leaders have warned contract prices have been cut to unsustainably low levels and must increase, at least in the United States."
Exxon,2017-3,"For the time being, oil industry buyers will continue to hold the upper hand in negotiations, but the balance will shift as the industry returns to expansion mode."
Exxon,2017-3,"And as the balance of pricing power shifts, costs will begin to escalate, and the industry's estimated breakevens are also likely to increase."
Exxon,2017-3,Pro-cyclical costs are a fundamental rather than incidental feature of the supply chain and there is no reason to believe that will change.
Exxon,2017-3,"Appeals for cost discipline may work in the short term, but in the medium term they are no more likely to be successful than in the past."

Exxon,2017-3,"HOUSTON, March 6 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp , the world's largest publicly traded oil producer, said on Monday it would invest $20 billion through 2022 to expand its chemical and oil refining plants on the U.S. Gulf Coast."
Exxon,2017-3,"The investments at 11 sites should create 35,000 temporary construction jobs and 12,000 permanent jobs, Chief Executive Darren Woods said in a speech at CERAWeek, the world's largest gathering of energy executives. [nL2N1GC1LX]"
Exxon,2017-3,"Some of the expansions began in 2013, but the scope of the project is now growing and the timeline extended, Exxon said."
Exxon,2017-3,"Woods ran Exxon's refining division before becoming CEO two months ago, and the new spending benefits a sector with which he has significant experience and comfort. Investments in the high-margin projects should help ease concerns from Wall Street that Exxon's growth potential - especially in oil and gas exploration and production - is sliding. [nL2N1GE0UU]"
Exxon,2017-3,"""Exxon Mobil is building a manufacturing powerhouse along the U.S. Gulf Coast,"" Woods said. ""These businesses are leveraging the shale revolution to manufacture cleaner fuels and more energy-efficient plastics."""
Exxon,2017-3,"The investments across Texas and Louisiana will take advantage of cheap shale gas to make plastics and other chemicals for export. The strategy builds on prior steps Exxon and peers, including Dow Chemical Co , have taken in the wake of the American shale expansion, which sharply cut production costs."
Exxon,2017-3,"""The supply is here. The demand is there. We want to keep connecting those dots,"" Woods said."
Exxon,2017-3,"Exxon last month pledged to boost this year's spending by 16 percent to expand operations, especially in shale production, after the company posted a better-than-expected quarterly profit, helped by rising oil prices and lower costs. [nL1N1FL0M7]"
Exxon,2017-3,"U.S. President Donald Trump, who tapped former Exxon CEO Rex Tillerson for secretary of state, praised the company's spending plans as an example of ""a true American success story."" Most of the permanent jobs are expected to pay more than $100,000 per year."
Exxon,2017-3,"""This is exactly the kind of investment, economic development and job creation that will help put Americans back to work,"" Trump said."
Exxon,2017-3,"When asked if Trump was taking credit for an investment program that began under former President Barack Obama in 2013, White House spokesman Sean Spicer said that Exxon made it clear to the president it was investing more in the United States because of his push for fewer regulations and tax relief."
Exxon,2017-3,"The bulk of the expansion will take place in Beaumont, Texas, with plans to expand polyethylene production, oil refining capacity and liquefied natural gas exports."
Exxon,2017-3,"Exxon also will increase its lubricant manufacturing capacity and potentially build a new refinery to produce ethane, a key building block for chemical production."
Exxon,2017-3,"Woods spent the larger part of his speech discussing climate change, an area for which Exxon has come under attack in the past year. The global economy can grow while also improving the climate, he said."
Exxon,2017-3,"""I believe the assumption that affordable energy and a cleaner environment are a zero-sum game is mistaken,"" he said. ""It underestimates the power of technology."""
Exxon,2017-3,"Woods highlighted Exxon's research into carbon capture sequestration, biofuels and other areas as ones helping the company expand its operations beyond oil and gas."
Exxon,2017-3,"""The only way to keep winning in a competitive market is to keep innovating,"" he said."
Exxon,2017-3,"Hoping to stem at least some of the environmental controversy, Exxon in January, just after Woods became CEO, named an environmentalist to its board of directors. [nL1N1FF222]"

Exxon,2017-3,Majors were unable to grow output for the past decade even as oil prices soared above $100 per barrel due bad capital discipline and huge project delays.
Exxon,2017-3,The oil price slump since 2014 has prompted the world's biggest oil firms to drastically cut costs but also to force contractors to make projects more efficient and extract the same amount of barrels for fewer dollars.

Exxon,2017-3,"NEW YORK, March 1 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp , the world's largest publicly traded oil producer, sought to reassure anxious investors on Wednesday about its growth potential, highlighting both short- and long-term projects executives said should continue to help fund the 106-year-old dividend."
Exxon,2017-3,"""Our job is to compete and succeed in any market,"" new Chief Executive Officer Darren Woods said at the company's annual analyst day in New York."
Exxon,2017-3,Woods sought to assuage Wall Street concerns that Exxon has lagged Chevron Corp and other peers in its ability to replace the oil and gas reserves it needs for future profitability.
Exxon,2017-3,"It was a tough task, with analysts critical of the company's ability to sustain growth. Of 25 Wall Street analysts tracking Exxon, only five recommend buying its shares, less than a third of the 17 who advise buying Chevron's shares, according to Thomson Reuters data."
Exxon,2017-3,"""Darren Woods did an effective job in laying out the story, but he was hamstrung by his predecessor's mistakes and the market's increasingly skeptical sentiment on the stock,"" Raymond James analyst Pavel Molchanov said."
Exxon,2017-3,"Woods, who was meeting analysts for the first time since predecessor Rex Tillerson left in January to become U.S. secretary of state, sought to show Wall Street that the company's investment potential was positive."
Exxon,2017-3,"Shares of Exxon rose 2 percent on Wednesday in line with the broader market, despite a drop in oil prices ."
Exxon,2017-3,"Exxon touted short-term projects in North Dakota and Texas, while pointing to larger endeavors in Russia, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Angola and Canada slated to come online later this year."
Exxon,2017-3,"Combined, all growth projects should boost the company's production to between 4 million and 4.4 million barrels of oil equivalent per day by 2020, Exxon said."
Exxon,2017-3,Exxon pumped 4.1 million barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2016.
Exxon,2017-3,"Exxon and other oil majors have been slow to recover from a two-year price war with OPEC members that has eroded profitability. Exxon does not hedge its oil production, so it is particularly sensitive to price swings."

Exxon,2017-3,"DALLAS, March 1 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Exxon Mobil's new chief executive, Darren Woods, is staking long-term growth on short-term fixes. At the oil major's annual analyst confab in New York on Wednesday, he outlined plans to ramp up the amount of capital expenditure dedicated to shale drilling in North Dakota and Texas. These should yield results more quickly than the longer-term projects Exxon tended to focus on and help it replace reserves it recently lost."
Exxon,2017-3,"Like its rivals, Exxon engages in a constant tug of war for its cash. On the one side, shareholders are big fans of the dividend that the company has steadily increased over the past several years. On the other, though, is the need to invest to grow its production. While oil prices were high, it was relatively easy to keep the two in balance."
Exxon,2017-3,"As prices dropped though, so did profit, meaning Exxon had to borrow more money to help fund both investments and dividend payments. Just last week, Exxon finally cut reserves by a record 3.3 billion barrels, which stoked fears a dividend cut could be in the offing."
Exxon,2017-3,"Trouble is, this year, at least, shale will only account for around a quarter of capex, with most of the rest going to projects that will take longer to bear fruit. And overall its investments over the next few years are only expected to boost production to as much as 4.4 million barrels equivalent a day by 2020, compared with 4.1 million and falling last year. The extra flow will be useful, but Woods may need to up the ante."
Exxon,2017-3,"- Exxon Mobil's new Chief Executive Darren Woods told shareholders at the company's annual analyst day on March 1 that the oil major is to invest $5.5 billion in short-term drilling projects in North Dakota and Texas in 2017, or around a quarter of capex. These so-called short-cycle investments will make up an even bigger portion of capex between 2018 and 2020."
Exxon,2017-3,"- Exxon is also making investments in Russia, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Angola and Canada. Together the projects should boost Exxon's production to as much as 4.4 million barrels of oil per day by 2020, Reuters reported."

Exxon,2017-3,"NEW YORK, March 1 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp , the world's largest publicly traded oil producer, sought to reassure anxious investors on Wednesday about its growth potential, highlighting both short- and long-term projects executives said should continue to help fund the 106-year-old dividend."
Exxon,2017-3,"""Our job is to compete and succeed in any market,"" new Chief Executive Officer Darren Woods said at the company's annual analyst day in New York."
Exxon,2017-3,Woods sought to assuage Wall Street concerns that Exxon has lagged Chevron Corp and other peers in its ability to replace the oil and gas reserves it needs for future profitability.
Exxon,2017-3,"It was a tough task, with analysts critical of the company's ability to sustain growth. Of 25 Wall Street analysts tracking Exxon, only five recommend buying its shares, less than a third of the 17 who advise buying Chevron's shares, according to Thomson Reuters data."
Exxon,2017-3,"""Darren Woods did an effective job in laying out the story, but he was hamstrung by his predecessor's mistakes and the market's increasingly skeptical sentiment on the stock,"" Raymond James analyst Pavel Molchanov said."
Exxon,2017-3,"Woods, who was meeting analysts for the first time since predecessor Rex Tillerson left in January to become U.S. secretary of state, sought to show Wall Street that the company's investment potential was positive."
Exxon,2017-3,"Shares of Exxon rose 2 percent on Wednesday in line with the broader market, despite a drop in oil prices ."
Exxon,2017-3,"Exxon touted short-term projects in North Dakota and Texas, while pointing to larger endeavors in Russia, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Angola and Canada slated to come online later this year."
Exxon,2017-3,"Combined, all growth projects should boost the company's production to between 4 million and 4.4 million barrels of oil equivalent per day by 2020, Exxon said."
Exxon,2017-3,Exxon pumped 4.1 million barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2016.
Exxon,2017-3,"Exxon and other oil majors have been slow to recover from a two-year price war with OPEC members that has eroded profitability. Exxon does not hedge its oil production, so it is particularly sensitive to price swings."
Exxon,2017-3,"Last year, for the second year in a row, Texas-based Exxon failed to replace 100 percent of its oil and gas reserves with new projects.[nL1N1G723D]"
Exxon,2017-3,"The company repeated its January spending outlook, in which it said it would spend $22 billion this year, up about 16 percent from 2016. [nL1N1FL0M7]"
Exxon,2017-3,Woods said that spending should increase to about $25 billion by the end of the decade.
Exxon,2017-3,"""We are confident in our ability to create significant shareholder value over the long-term,"" he said."
Exxon,2017-3,"Woods, who previously ran Exxon's refining unit, defended the company's integrated business model, which twins oil exploration and production with refining. Refining profits typically rise when oil prices fall, which has helped lift Exxon's results in the past year."
Exxon,2017-3,"While some investors have pushed oil companies to spin off refining units to boost shareholder returns, Woods said Exxon's profitability would suffer should that occur."

Exxon,2017-3,"DALLAS, March 1 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Exxon Mobil's new chief executive, Darren Woods, is staking long-term growth on short-term fixes. At the oil major's annual analyst confab in New York on Wednesday, he outlined plans to ramp up the amount of capital expenditure dedicated to shale drilling in North Dakota and Texas. These should yield results more quickly than the longer-term projects Exxon tended to focus on and help it replace reserves it recently lost."
Exxon,2017-3,"Like its rivals, Exxon engages in a constant tug of war for its cash. On the one side, shareholders are big fans of the dividend that the company has steadily increased over the past several years. On the other, though, is the need to invest to grow its production. While oil prices were high, it was relatively easy to keep the two in balance."
Exxon,2017-3,"As prices dropped though, so did profit, meaning Exxon had to borrow more money to help fund both investments and dividend payments. Just last week, Exxon finally cut reserves by a record 3.3 billion barrels, which stoked fears a dividend cut could be in the offing."
Exxon,2017-3,"Trouble is, this year, at least, shale will only account for around a quarter of capex, with most of the rest going to projects that will take longer to bear fruit. And overall its investments over the next few years are only expected to boost production to as much as 4.4 million barrels equivalent a day by 2020, compared with 4.1 million and falling last year. The extra flow will be useful, but Woods may need to up the ante."
Exxon,2017-3,"- Exxon Mobil's new Chief Executive Darren Woods told shareholders at the company's annual analyst day on March 1 that the oil major is to invest $5.5 billion in short-term drilling projects in North Dakota and Texas in 2017, or around a quarter of capex. These so-called short-cycle investments will make up an even bigger portion of capex between 2018 and 2020."
Exxon,2017-3,"- Exxon is also making investments in Russia, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Angola and Canada. Together the projects should boost Exxon's production to as much as 4.4 million barrels of oil per day by 2020, Reuters reported."

Exxon,2017-3,"WASHINGTON, March 1 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump and his top advisors have often scoffed at government support of green energy. His chief strategist called it ""madness."""
Exxon,2017-3,"But the largest U.S. government agency - the Department of Defense - plans to forge ahead under the new administration with a decade-long effort to convert its fuel-hungry operations to renewable power, senior military officials told Reuters."
Exxon,2017-3,"The reasons have nothing to do with the white-hot debate over climate change. In combat zones, green energy saves lives by, for instance, reducing the need for easily attacked convoys to deliver diesel fuel to generators at U.S. bases. Mobile solar-power units allow soldiers to prowl silently through enemy territory."
Exxon,2017-3,"The military's zeal for renewable power has already had broad impacts on energy contractors, generating hundreds of millions in contracts for solar companies and helping to reduce fuel consumption by the world's largest single petroleum buyer."
Exxon,2017-3,"The armed forces nearly doubled renewable power generation between 2011 and 2015, to 10,534 billion British thermal units, or enough to power about 286,000 average U.S. homes, according to a Department of Defense report."
Exxon,2017-3,"The number of military renewable energy projects nearly tripled to 1,390 between 2011 and 2015, department data showed, with a number of utilities and solar companies benefiting. Many of those projects are at U.S. bases, where renewable energy allows the military to maintain its own independent source of power in case of a natural disaster or an attack - or cyber attack - that disables the public grid."
Exxon,2017-3,"The White House did not respond to Reuters requests for comment on the military's use of green energy. Although Trump has blasted solar subsidies, vowed to boost fossil fuel development and questioned the science behind climate change, military leaders remain confident that the president won't halt their march toward renewable power."
Exxon,2017-3,"""We expect that it's going to continue during the Trump administration,"" said Lt. Col. Wayne Kinsel, head of the infrastructure unit of the Air Force Asset Management Division for Logistics, Engineering and Force Protection. ""It's really not political."""

Exxon,2017-3,"Delayed cokers do not produce coke continuously, but at regular intervals when a drum, which can be 300 feet (91.4 meters) in length, is lifted out of the unit. High-pressure hot water jets are used to remove the layer of coke that has been cooked along the wall of the drum."
