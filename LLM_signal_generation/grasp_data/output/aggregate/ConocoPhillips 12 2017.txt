ConocoPhillips,2017-12,"{{20171222T145946.000+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-Big Oil's discipline reinforces shale's swing roleDALLAS, Dec 22 (Reuters Breakingviews)"
ConocoPhillips,2017-12,(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are her own.)
ConocoPhillips,2017-12,"Expensive, longer-term projects will be constrained as a result, while U.S. shale, among the fastest and least costly sources of oil in the world, will fill in the gap. In 2017, U.S. tight oil, as shale is also known, solidified its place as the market's swing producer even as OPEC, the oil world's dominant cartel, cut production. The International Energy Agency says that though the number of active U.S. rigs fell in 2017, output will continue to rise in 2018."
ConocoPhillips,2017-12,"Unless new discoveries or technologies upend the energy sector, shale's influence will grow. The IEA says U.S. shale output in the 15 years to 2025 will match the highest sustained period of oil output growth by any single country in the history of the oil markets. By then the United States will be the largest liquefied natural gas exporter and, shortly after, a net exporter of oil. Shale has the power to keep oil prices subdued for a long time yet."
ConocoPhillips,2017-12,"- On Nov. 30, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and non-OPEC producers led by Russia agreed to extend oil output cuts until the end of 2018. The cartel also decided to cap the combined output of Nigeria and Libya at 2017 levels of less than 2.8 million barrels a day. Both countries had previously been exempt from production restraints."
ConocoPhillips,2017-12,"- By October, commercial inventories in member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development had fallen to a level 140 million barrels above the five-year moving average, draining more than half the previous glut, according to OPEC."

ConocoPhillips,2017-12,"ANCHORAGE, Alaska, Dec 15 (Reuters) - The state of Alaska will receive hundreds of millions of dollars in a settlement with oil companies over the value of North Slope crude oil shipped through the Trans-Alaska Pipeline (TAP), officials announced."
ConocoPhillips,2017-12,The settlement between Alaska and the companies that own the 800-mile oil artery concerns transportation tariffs charged by the pipeline owners between 2009 and 2015.
ConocoPhillips,2017-12,"Alaska claimed that the Alyeska owner companies, including BP, ConocoPhillips, ExxonMobil, Koch Industries and Unocal, overstated the tariffs and improperly devalued the oil delivered by the pipeline, thus reducing state income."
ConocoPhillips,2017-12,"""This settlement is a great result for the State,"" Alaska Attorney General Jahna Lindemuth said in statement. ""It creates certainty going forward, avoids future litigation, and will provide additional taxes and royalties -- bringing needed money to the state treasury."""
ConocoPhillips,2017-12,"The settlement was filed Friday with the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the Regulatory Commission of Alaska (RCA), said Chief Alaska Attorney General John Ptacin. It is subject to FERC and RCA approval, which state officials hope will happen by next spring, he said."
ConocoPhillips,2017-12,"The settlement resolves multiple disputes over the time period. ""There's about 40 rate cases. We're settling all of those cases in this settlement agreement,"" Ptacin said."
ConocoPhillips,2017-12,The terms allow the state to retain $224 million in already collected revenues and grant the state an additional $165 million in oil revenues.
ConocoPhillips,2017-12,"Other terms require the companies to exclude from any tariff calculations approximately $625 million that the owner companies spent on ""strategic reconfiguration"" for TAPS operator Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. Terms also include a methodology for calculating transportation tariffs through 2021."
ConocoPhillips,2017-12,"The settlement resolves complaints the oil companies filed in Washington, D.C. and Alaska courts that challenged past FERC and RCA rulings, Ptacin said."
ConocoPhillips,2017-12,"Much of the disagreement stemmed from Alyeska's strategic reconfiguration project, which was aimed at streamlining operations, increasing automation and reducing costs in a time when the pipeline is carrying reduced oil volumes."
ConocoPhillips,2017-12,"The state argued that the owner companies botched the project and added costs that should not be used to reduce the value of North Slope crude or the revenues derived from that crude. The state prevailed on that point, Ptacin said."
ConocoPhillips,2017-12,"Disputes also concerned property taxes and how they would be treated in the tariff calculations, he said."
ConocoPhillips,2017-12,"Also parties to the settlement are Anadarko, Tesoro, Flint Hills and Petro Star Inc., which shipped oil through the pipeline but held no ownership shares. Those companies generally sided with the state in the tariff disputes, Ptacin said."

ConocoPhillips,2017-12,"Dec 14 (Reuters) - Canadian oil sands company Cenovus Energy Inc said on Thursday it would cut an additional 15 percent of its workforce and lower operating expenses as new chief executive, Alex Pourbaix, seeks to aggressively reduce costs and lower debt."
ConocoPhillips,2017-12,The move was expected as Pourbaix last month vowed to focus on cost cuts as the company remains under investor pressure to justify its C$17 billion ($13.3 billion) deal to buy ConocoPhillips assets. [nL4N1N540C]
ConocoPhillips,2017-12,"Calgary-based Cenovus, which hired Pourbaix last month, had said in June that it expected to eliminate some jobs, but did not specify the scale."
ConocoPhillips,2017-12,"The company also said it expected to reduce per-barrel operating costs by 8 percent, compared with estimated 2017 expenses, and lower capital costs needed to sustain each oil barrel by 12 percent. [nL1N1JH160]"
ConocoPhillips,2017-12,"""Our priorities for 2018 are to reduce costs and deleverage our balance sheet,"" Pourbaix said in a statement."
ConocoPhillips,2017-12,"Cenovus also cut spending in the Deep Basin gas assets it bought from ConocoPhillips, which had been unpopular in part because they departed from the Canadian company's oil sands focus."
ConocoPhillips,2017-12,"Raymond James analyst Chris Cox said such moves were ""consistent with the messaging"" Pourbaix has provided."
ConocoPhillips,2017-12,"""Tackling the cost structure and improving the balance sheet appear to be the hallmarks of the early strategy for new CEO,"" he said."
ConocoPhillips,2017-12,"Cenovus also announced the departures of three top-level executives, which was also expected given that new CEOs typically shake up their management teams, said Desjardins analyst Justin Bouchard."
ConocoPhillips,2017-12,"As of Nov. 15, Cenovus had raised just under C$4 billion out of a targeted C$4 billion to C$5 billion to pay down debt it took on to fund the ConocoPhillips deal."
ConocoPhillips,2017-12,"Cenovus also said it expected to produce between 483,000 to 510,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2018, an increase of 4-5 percent compared to 2017. [nGNXOJYVCa]"

ConocoPhillips,2017-12,(Updates with INEOS saying outage could last up to 4 weeks)
ConocoPhillips,2017-12,"LONDON, Dec 12 (Reuters) - Britain's biggest pipeline from its North Sea oil and gas fields is likely to be shut for several weeks for repairs, its operator said on Tuesday, disrupting gas flows and sending international crude prices to their highest since mid-2015."
ConocoPhillips,2017-12,"The closure has struck during a winter freeze in Britain, where snow and ice have driven up demand for heating fuel just as gas flows through the network, which carries a third of Britain's gas produced offshore, were disrupted."
ConocoPhillips,2017-12,"""We are working to get the pipeline restored to full operation as quickly as we can safely do so... We have previously indicated a time frame of three to four weeks and we believe it is no less than two,"" operator INEOS said in a email to customers seen by Reuters."
ConocoPhillips,2017-12,"The pipeline, which carries about 450,000 barrels per day (bpd) of Forties crude, was shut after cracks were found."
ConocoPhillips,2017-12,"It has particular significance to global markets because Forties is the largest out of the five crude oil streams that underpin the dated Brent benchmark, against which other crude prices are broadly based. Benchmark Brent crude prices rose above $65 per barrel for the first time since the middle of 2015 following the closure on Monday. [O/R]"
ConocoPhillips,2017-12,INEOS only completed the purchase of the Forties pipeline system from oil major BP in October. A minor leak had caused a partial shutdown on Dec. 7 and a full shutdown on Monday. INEOS said the small crack has not increased over the past 24 hours.

ConocoPhillips,2017-12,"""If it's a lengthy outage, then a recovery period for the fields will be long as well,"" the trading source said."
ConocoPhillips,2017-12,"A number of producers including BP , Shell and Chrysaor, said they had closed down oil fields in response."
ConocoPhillips,2017-12,"The largest contributor to the Forties stream, the 180,000-bpd Buzzard oil field run by Nexen Petroleum UK Ltd, a subsidiary of China's CNOOC <0883.HK>, had also closed, two trading sources said. [CRU/OUT]"
ConocoPhillips,2017-12,"Monthly loading programmes show the supply of Forties is expected to reach 21 cargoes of 600,000 barrels each this month, equal to a daily supply rate of 406,000 bpd. [nL9N1AF03S]"

ConocoPhillips,2017-12,"ANCHORAGE, Alaska, Dec 6 (Reuters) - An oil-and-gas lease sale that raised concerns with environmentalists due to the vast amount of acres offered in Arctic Alaska drew few bids on Wednesday, government officials said."
ConocoPhillips,2017-12,"Seven bids were received, covering about 80,000 acres - or less than 1 percent of the 10.3 million acres offered in the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska by the Trump administration. It was, by far, more territory than ever offered in any of the previous 12 NPR-A lease sales held since 1999."
ConocoPhillips,2017-12,"The sale was the latest move by the administration of President Donald Trump, a Republican, supporting his pledge to make the United States ""energy dominant"" by boosting output of oil, natural gas and coal."
ConocoPhillips,2017-12,Environmentalists have generally accepted some oil development in the National Petroleum Reserve but worry the Trump administration will lift too many restrictions. Environmentalists want to entirely block opening the state's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to drilling. [nL2N1MV01Z]
ConocoPhillips,2017-12,"ConocoPhillips Alaska Inc, in partnership with Anadarko Petroleum Corp , submitted the seven bids, totaling $1.16 million, for tracts in the NPR-A. Results were revealed in a bid opening conducted in Anchorage by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management."
ConocoPhillips,2017-12,"The ConocoPhillips-Anadarko bids were for tracts along the southern border of ConocoPhillips' Greater Mooses Tooth unit, where oil production is expected to start next year."
ConocoPhillips,2017-12,"""Lease sale interest is unpredictable,"" Ted Murphy, associate director of the BLM's Alaska office, said in a telephone news conference after the sale. ""We don't know what industry, ultimately, will be interested in getting from year to year."""
ConocoPhillips,2017-12,"Last year's NPR-A lease sale drew $18.8 million in bids, led by ConocoPhillips , for 67 tracts covering 613,529 acres."
ConocoPhillips,2017-12,One environmentalist said the results on Wednesday suggest that the Trump administration is overestimating industry's desire to drill new Arctic territory.
ConocoPhillips,2017-12,"""It seems, from my perspective, that it's this mentality that if we open it, industry will come. And that's not necessarily true,"" said Lisa Baraff of the Fairbanks-based Northern Alaska Environmental Center."
ConocoPhillips,2017-12,"Kara Moriarty, executive director of the Alaska Oil and Gas Association, said the low level of NPR-A bidding might show that companies were being strategic about new leases."
ConocoPhillips,2017-12,"She noted that another lease sale for state land ""right next door"" to NPR-A drew brisk bidding. The Alaska Oil and Gas Division's lease sale, also held Wednesday, drew $19.9 million and over 100 bids, mostly from Spanish energy company Repsol SA and Colorado-based independent oil company Armstrong."

ConocoPhillips,2017-12,"Dec 5 (Reuters) - Even as the U.S. Senate moves to allow oil drilling in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR), the real action is 150 miles (241 km) west, where industry proponents hope a coming sale of 10 million acres of land will revitalize the state's sagging crude production."
ConocoPhillips,2017-12,"The Trump administration, through the U.S. Bureau of Land Management, will auction off 10 million acres on Wednesday in the National Petroleum Reserve (NPR-A), a hotbed of oil exploration and development in the western part of Alaska's North Slope."
ConocoPhillips,2017-12,"The planned sale has encouraged the oil industry while angering environmental groups. It would be the largest amount of land offered in a single lease sale there. The last sale of 1.45 million acres in 2016 netted $18.8 million, according to the U.S. Interior Department."
ConocoPhillips,2017-12,"Alaskan crude output this year was just 490,000 bpd, according to government data, far off its peak in 1988, when it produced more than 2 million barrels a day, nearly a quarter of overall U.S. production at the time."
ConocoPhillips,2017-12,"Alaska's Congress members have pushed to allow drilling in ANWR, and a provision to do that was included in the Republican tax bill that recently passed the Senate."
ConocoPhillips,2017-12,"Yet industry supporters say development in the NPR-A, already established for the oil and gas industry, could yield barrels much more quickly than drilling in more remote Alaska frontiers."
ConocoPhillips,2017-12,"""NPR-A has the potential to fulfill short-term oil and gas needs for the state,"" said Kara Moriarty, executive director of the Alaska Oil and Gas Association."
ConocoPhillips,2017-12,"""It's right next to currently producing fields,"" she said, rather than in the Arctic Ocean or the wilderness. She said that even if ANWR is opened to drilling, it would be 10 to 15 years before any oil could be produced there."
ConocoPhillips,2017-12,"The NPR-A was set aside in 1923 as a source of oil for the military, but seven decades passed before there was any serious interest in drilling, and first production did not happen until 2015. Future development is held in check by a land management plan issued in 2013 that established five areas across the 23 million-acre reserve for special protection."
ConocoPhillips,2017-12,"Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke in May issued an order to review Arctic Alaska oil policies, with a potential repeal of environmental rules restricting NPR-A drilling."
ConocoPhillips,2017-12,"The reserve holds an estimated 896 million barrels of recoverable oil and 52.8 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, according to a mean estimate issued by the U.S. Geological Survey in 2010, though the oil figure represents a sharp downward revision from 2002 estimates. In his May order, Zinke directed the USGS to revise that 2010 estimate."
ConocoPhillips,2017-12,"ConocoPhillips Inc , the company most active in NPR-A, will ask the Bureau of Land Management to open up some territory near Teshekpuk Lake, Lisa Bruner, the company's Alaska vice president of North Slope operations and development, said at an industry conference last month in Anchorage."
ConocoPhillips,2017-12,Teshekpuk is the North Slope's biggest lake and site of protections that date to the Reagan administration.
ConocoPhillips,2017-12,"""We see potential as we move into that area further to the west,"" Bruner said. ConocoPhillips plans to drill four exploration wells this winter on leases within NPR-A, and one on adjacent state land."
ConocoPhillips,2017-12,"Federal law requires protection of ecological resources and Alaska Native cultural rights to hunting and fishing areas, along with oil development, Whittington-Evans said. The Obama-era management plan, the product of years of scientific and public review, accomplished those goals, she said."

ConocoPhillips,2017-12,"OSLO, Dec 5 (Reuters) - Norway's attractiveness as an oil region took a hit on Tuesday when energy authorities said 11 oil firms applied for stakes in exploration blocks off Norway in its latest oil licensing round, less than half the number that applied in the previous round."
ConocoPhillips,2017-12,"A disappointing drilling campaign this year in the Arctic Barents Sea - where oil companies did not make a single significant discovery - was the main factor discouraging oil companies from taking part in the 24th licencing round, industry experts said. [nL8N1MK1HD]"
ConocoPhillips,2017-12,"""Clearly the results of the exploration campaign in the Barents Sea this year have impacted the number of companies applying,"" said Helge Andre Martinsen, an analyst at DNB Markets."
ConocoPhillips,2017-12,"""Overall exploration results this year have been extremely disappointing: dry wells and less volumes than expected,"" he added, citing in particular Statoil's Korpfjell prospect, for which expectations were high. [nL8N1LF1D4]"
ConocoPhillips,2017-12,"""The only thing that can turn this around is the upcoming Barents Sea campaign in 2018,"" he said."
ConocoPhillips,2017-12,"Oil and gas are the Nordic country's largest industry, accounting for 12 percent of GDP. To replace existing output, new discoveries must be made and authorities expect them to be in the Barents Sea. After 2022, Norway has no major oil projects in the pipeline."
ConocoPhillips,2017-12,"The number of firms applying for licences this year compares with 26 companies seeking drilling permits in the previous round in 2015. If all 11 applicants are awarded acreage, the 24th round would still be at a 15-year low in terms of participants. [nL8N1MK1HD]"
ConocoPhillips,2017-12,"Statoil, the largest explorer and producer off Norway, plans to drill five or six wells in the Barents Sea next year [nL8N1NY1MG]. Earlier on Tuesday it announced a $6 billion development plan for the Johan Castberg field in the Arctic. [nL8N1O50OW]"
ConocoPhillips,2017-12,"The oil and energy ministry said the latest licensing round is mainly about getting exploration going in key areas in Norway's least explored areas. Awards will be made in June 2018, it said in a statement."
ConocoPhillips,2017-12,"In this licensing round, which focused on the Barents Sea, applicants included Statoil , Aker BP , Lundin Petroleum , Shell , OMV , Centrica , DEA and Wintershall ."
ConocoPhillips,2017-12,"Idemitsu <5019.T>, KUFPEC and RN Nordic Oil, a subsidiary of Rosneft , were also on the list of applicants."

ConocoPhillips,2017-12,"The limited interest in the round does have a positive side for some of the firms taking part. ""For Statoil, Aker BP and Lundin Petroleum, it is less competition,"" said Martinsen."
ConocoPhillips,2017-12,"The government offered a total of 102 exploration blocks, consisting of 93 blocks in the Barents Sea and nine in the Norwegian Sea, although it is expected to narrow this down based on the interest expressed by oil firms."

ConocoPhillips,2017-12,"HOUSTON, Dec 4 (Reuters) - ConocoPhillips will receive $337 million from Ecuador under a settlement of an arbitration case that the U.S. energy company brought over a 2009 confiscation of assets in the South American country."
ConocoPhillips,2017-12,"A World Bank panel in February had ordered Ecuador to pay $380 million in damages to the oil and gas producer's subsidiary, Burlington Resources. The subsidiary had stakes in two blocks producing about 22,000 barrels of oil per day that were taken over by the government more than eight years ago. [nL4N1FU00G]"
ConocoPhillips,2017-12,"The settlement includes an offset for a decision awarding Ecuador $42 million on its environmental and infrastructure counterclaims. Burlington is entitled to $24 million through a third-party contribution to the payment, ConocoPhillips said on Monday"
ConocoPhillips,2017-12,ConocoPhillips also said it was pleased to reach a conclusion of the matter. It received $75 million on Dec. 1 from Ecuador and expects to collect another $262 million by April 2018. [nBw24kcCfa]
ConocoPhillips,2017-12,"In a statement, Ecuador's attorney general's office said, ""The agreement between Ecuador and Burlington allows us to resolve this controversy and to reaffirm the Ecuadorean state's commitment to fulfilling its international obligations."""
