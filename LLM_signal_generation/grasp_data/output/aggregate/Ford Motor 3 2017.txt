Ford Motor,2017-3,"The 300 engineers in Canada and 100 in the United States will double the current size of the Detroit automaker's mobile connectivity engineering team. The company said it also plans to establish a new research and engineering center in Ottawa, Canada."
Ford Motor,2017-3,"Connectivity is a key investment area for the auto industry as in-car technology catches up to that of smartphones. As more modems are built directly into cars, vehicles are able to access a richer array of digital services. Ford plans to equip 20 million cars with built-in modems in the next five years."
Ford Motor,2017-3,"The new hires, many of whom are coming from BlackBerry Ltd's shuttered handset business, will work on infotainment, in-vehicle modems, gateway modules, handset integration, security, driver assist features and autonomous vehicles, Ford said."
Ford Motor,2017-3,"The move by the Detroit carmaker underscores how many new jobs in the auto sector are for white-collar technology jobs related to connectivity, mobility or autonomous vehicles, versus traditional factory jobs."

Ford Motor,2017-3,"{{20170330T101545.846+0000}}Rouble's rise eases pain for foreign carmakers in Russia* Stronger rouble reduces costs, supports dollar earnings"
Ford Motor,2017-3,"MOSCOW, March 30 (Reuters) - Foreign carmakers in Russia are benefiting from a stronger, more stable rouble, which is reducing their costs and supporting earnings in dollar terms at a time when the once-booming local market is expected to return to growth after four tough years."
Ford Motor,2017-3,"The companies, including German car group Volkswagen and Japan's Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T>, were some of the hardest hit by Russia's economic downturn, in which annual car sales more than halved from a 2012 peak of almost 3 million vehicles, and a sharp devaluation of the rouble raised prices for imported parts and sapped profits."
Ford Motor,2017-3,"But Russian car sales are now forecast to grow by 4 percent in 2017, according to the Association of European Businesses lobby group."
Ford Motor,2017-3,"Five of the world's biggest carmakers operating in Russia, which had a combined market share of around 38 percent last year, told Reuters the stronger rouble had improved their position in the country. This will help them to cope in a challenging and volatile market once seen overtaking Germany as Europe's biggest for automobiles."
Ford Motor,2017-3,"""The rouble fluctuation is of course difficult in all directions. When it was shooting up or weakening like hell over the last few years we had difficulties ... we lost a lot of money there,"" Marcus Osegowitsch, head of Volkswagen's Russian business, said."
Ford Motor,2017-3,"""Now of course the rouble is stronger again and we are managing. If it stays somewhere between 65 and 67 to the euro, this is fine for us."""
Ford Motor,2017-3,"The rouble has gained 8 percent against the dollar and 6 percent against the euro so far this year, supported by higher oil prices and Russia's nascent economic recovery. Year on year, the Russian currency is up almost 20 percent against the dollar. [nL5N1FA0YK]"
Ford Motor,2017-3,"General Motors quit Russia in 2015, partly due to the rouble devaluation, but industry analysts say those foreign players who have stuck out the crisis years could soon see their local operations return to profit."
Ford Motor,2017-3,"""Foreign producers who suffered losses over the last two years now have the opportunity to return to profit thanks to the stronger rouble,"" VTB analyst Vladimir Bespalov said. ""This could happen by late 2017 or early 2018."""
Ford Motor,2017-3,"Ford , which is enjoying an unexpected uptick in sales in Russia, has already lowered prices on four models produced by its joint-venture with local partner Sollers due to the rouble strengthening. [nL8N1FY5BD]"
Ford Motor,2017-3,"Competitors will similarly try to keep prices low, Bespalov said, in an effort to win back cautious buyers."
Ford Motor,2017-3,"Representatives for Korean carmaker Kia Motors <000270.KS> and France's Renault , which owns a majority stake in Russia's top automaker Avtovaz along with its alliance partner Nissan <7201.T>, said the rouble's improved performance in 2017 was supporting sales and the market recovery."
Ford Motor,2017-3,"""In the long term, the stronger rouble will positively affect our profitability,"" a Nissan spokesman said."
Ford Motor,2017-3,"Avtovaz's production costs are less exposed to currency fluctuations than those of foreign carmakers, as the majority of its car components are produced domestically."
Ford Motor,2017-3,"""In the last few months, the situation with the rouble rate has become more predictable, which has affected the behaviour of our clients,"" a Toyota spokeswoman said. ""We are seeing a renewed readiness to buy a car."""

Ford Motor,2017-3,"MONTREAL, DETROIT March 29 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co will announce on Thursday production of a new engine in the Canadian province of Ontario, two sources familiar with the matter said, in an investment that would boost Canada's auto industry after years of job losses to Mexico and the United States."
Ford Motor,2017-3,"The sources said the 7X engine, for large pickup trucks, is to be announced with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau at the Ford Essex Engine Plant in Windsor, Ontario, on Thursday morning."
Ford Motor,2017-3,"It is part of the C$700 million ($525.05 million) in new investments secured during a 2016 agreement between Ford and its 7,000 unionized Canadian workers, the sources said. Investments in Windsor's two engine plants are expected to account for about C$600 million ($450.05 million). [nL1N1D41MC]"
Ford Motor,2017-3,"Brian Maxim, a vice president at AutoForecast Solutions, said in a telephone interview that the 7.0-litre, V8 engine would have more torque and be more fuel efficient than the 6.8-litre V10 engine now built in Windsor and used in Ford's super- duty trucks, such as its F-250s."
Ford Motor,2017-3,"Maxim said he expected Ford to produce about 125,000 units of the new engine per year, starting in 2019."
Ford Motor,2017-3,Ford's F-Series pickup trucks have been the best-selling model in the United States since 1982.
Ford Motor,2017-3,New investment in engine production in Canada was seen as vital because the large V8 and V10 motors now built by Ford in Windsor were expected to end production in four years.

Ford Motor,2017-3,"TORONTO, March 29 (Reuters) - Although BlackBerry Ltd has extricated itself from the smartphone handsets that weighed on its recent fortunes, the Canadian firm faces a tough slog to convince skeptics it can return to its glory days through an enlarged software business."
Ford Motor,2017-3,"The company, which will report fourth-quarter and full-year results on Friday, says it has no major gaps in its software portfolio, thanks to the integration of a string of recent acquisitions."
Ford Motor,2017-3,"It concedes, however, that more work is needed to get those offerings into the healthcare and automotive industries and other sectors that it hopes will power future growth."
Ford Motor,2017-3,"""The bottom line is: BlackBerry is a completely different beast than it was a decade ago,"" said Nicholas McQuire, a workplace IT analyst at CCS Insight, a consulting firm. ""However, it still needs to educate enterprises, particularly prospects in markets outside its core regulated footprint on the 'new BlackBerry',"" he said."
Ford Motor,2017-3,"Investors are unsure how to value the company, waiting for guidance from Chief Executive Officer John Chen, who needs a late bump in sales to hit the 30 percent growth in software revenue BlackBerry targeted for its recently completed fiscal year."
Ford Motor,2017-3,"BlackBerry's enterprise-value-to-forward-revenue ratio is 3.14, according to Thomson Reuters data, lower than the roughly 4.5 ratio enjoyed by Oracle Corp and Microsoft Corp , two of its closest peers now that Blackberry focuses on enterprise software."
Ford Motor,2017-3,"The Waterloo, Ontario-based company is expected to barely break even in the fourth quarter and likely notch revenue of less than $1.4 billion in its fiscal year ended Feb. 28, 2017, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S estimates. At its peak, the smartphone pioneer was raking in more than $5.5 billion a quarter."
Ford Motor,2017-3,"Blackberry's Toronto-listed shares were trading down 0.4 percent at C$9.40, while the benchmark Canadian share index <.GSPTSE> was up 0.3 percent."
Ford Motor,2017-3,The redesigned company has gone from selling its own phones with the servers and software that manage them for businesses and governments to securing an array of rival devices and the information that flows to and from them.
Ford Motor,2017-3,It is also targeting the burgeoning but fragmented market to connect sensors and other devices and has invested in other potentially high-growth areas including cyber security consulting and autonomous vehicles.
Ford Motor,2017-3,"""It has pivoted in the right direction with some new and promising areas ahead of it, but these are nascent markets which will take time to materializes in its bottom line,"" McQuire said."
Ford Motor,2017-3,"The company's 2015 purchases of Good Technology and WatchDox helped it secure a leading position in the enterprise mobility market, and its QNX industrial operating system is key to its self-driving vehicle ambitions. However, there is tough competition in these and other areas of interest."
Ford Motor,2017-3,"""We have a no-moat rating for BlackBerry,"" said Ali Mogharabi, an analyst at Morningstar. ""There's still a lot of uncertainty on how well they are going to progress in autonomous driving and other growth markets."""
Ford Motor,2017-3,"The company no longer has any responsibility for making or selling smartphones bearing its brand, after setting up late last year to take a cut on sales from the likes of Chinese smartphone maker TCL Communication, which will begin selling a BlackBerry-branded phone in April."
Ford Motor,2017-3,"But given TCL is going to rely on the BlackBerry name to sell the KeyOne device, which it announced at a major technology conference last month, the separation may yet prove difficult."
Ford Motor,2017-3,"Chen, who took over the helm of BlackBerry in late 2013, said in December the company would likely take another four or five quarters to halt the steady decline in its overall revenue, with software sales growth projected to slow to around 15 percent in the fiscal year that began in March."
Ford Motor,2017-3,"""What would help is if these guys actually standardize the type of guidance and/or the detailed information they provide on their calls,"" Morningstar's Mogharabi said. ""It's pretty tough to get a clear picture of where they are in the turnaround mode and the potential upside or downside going forward."""

Ford Motor,2017-3,"WASHINGTON, March 29 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co , the second largest U.S. automaker, on Wednesday announced two new recalls affecting 440,000 vehicles and expects to spend about $295 million to fix the issues."
Ford Motor,2017-3,"The recalls include 211,000 vehicles in North America to replace potentially faulty side door latches and 230,000 vehicles for under-hood fire risks. Ford said it has reports of 29 fires but no injuries."
Ford Motor,2017-3,Ford said the cost of the recalls were included in its updated earnings guidance issued last week.
Ford Motor,2017-3,"Last week, Ford warned it expects lower earnings per share in the first quarter and lower pretax profit in 2017 due to higher spending on commodities, warranties and investments and a drop in sales volumes especially fleet sales. [nL2N1H00MR]"
Ford Motor,2017-3,"The Dearborn automaker had previously recalled nearly 4 million vehicles for door latch issues in six separate recalls since 2014, including 2.4 million vehicles recalled in late 2016. In September, Ford said it was taking a $640 million charge for its expanded side-door latch recalls."
Ford Motor,2017-3,"The new door latch recall includes 211,000 2014 model year Ford Fiesta, 2013-14 Ford Fusion and 2013-14 Lincoln MKZ vehicles. Ford said it not aware of any crashes or injuries associated with this issue. The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said in 2015 it had 1,102 reports related to the problem and Ford said it had 10,883 warranty claims related to door latch failures. Some owners told NHTSA they used ropes or tape or seatbelts to restrain doors."
Ford Motor,2017-3,"The under-hood fire recall covers 230,000 2013-15 Ford Escape, Ford Fiesta ST, Ford Fusion and Ford Transit Connect vehicles equipped with 1.6-liter GTDI engines in North America."
Ford Motor,2017-3,"Ford said a lack of coolant circulation could cause an engine to overheat, resulting in a crack in the cylinder head, which could result in a pressurized oil leak and raise the risk of a fire."
Ford Motor,2017-3,"In October, NHTSA opened a preliminary investigation into 440,000 Ford 2011-2013 Edge SUVs over door latch warning light issues. The agency said Wednesday it is closing its investigation without seeking a recall."

Ford Motor,2017-3,"DETROIT, March 28 (Reuters) - China's Tencent Holdings Ltd <0700.HK> has bought a 5 percent stake in U.S. electric car maker Tesla Inc for $1.78 billion, the latest investment by a Chinese internet company in the potentially lucrative market for self-driving vehicles and related services."
Ford Motor,2017-3,"Tencent's investment, revealed in a U.S. regulatory filing, provides Tesla with a deep-pocketed ally as it prepares to launch its mass-market Model 3.

Ford Motor,2017-3,"Tencent also could help the U.S. company sell - or even build - cars in China, the world's largest auto market, analysts said."

Ford Motor,2017-3,The midsize Model 3 is due to go on sale later this year in the United States.
Ford Motor,2017-3,"The deal expands Tencent's presence in an emerging investment sector that includes self-driving electric cars, which could enable such new modes of transportation as automated ride-sharing and delivery services, as well as ancillary services ranging from infotainment to e-commerce."
Ford Motor,2017-3,"Those new technologies, and their potential to create new business models and revenue streams in the global transportation sector, have attracted billions in investment from China's three tech giants - Tencent, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd and Baidu Inc ."

Ford Motor,2017-3,"Founded in 1998 by entrepreneur Ma Huateng, Tencent is one of Asia's largest tech companies, best known for its WeChat mobile messaging app. With a market capitalization of about $275 billion, it is roughly six times the size of 14-year-old Tesla, whose $45 billion market cap on Tuesday was only $1 billion shy of 114-year-old Ford."
Ford Motor,2017-3,"Tencent was an early investor in NextEV, a Shanghai-based electric vehicle startup that since has rebranded itself as Nio, with U.S. headquarters in San Jose, not far from Tesla's Palo Alto base. Tencent also has funded at least two other Chinese EV startups, including Future Mobility in Shenzhen."
Ford Motor,2017-3,"In addition, Tencent has invested in Didi Chuxing, the world's second-largest ride services company behind Uber, and in Lyft, Uber's chief U.S. rival."
Ford Motor,2017-3,"Baidu has invested in Nio, as well as in Uber and Velodyne, a California maker of laser-based lidar sensors for self-driving cars. Alibaba's mobility investments include Didi and Lyft."
Ford Motor,2017-3,"As Tesla is doing, many of the start-up companies backed by Tencent, Baidu and Alibaba are developing self-driving systems that eventually could be introduced in commercial ride-sharing fleets in the United States and China after 2020."
Ford Motor,2017-3,"Tencent maintains a U.S. office in Palo Alto, in the heart of California's Silicon Valley. Beijing-based Baidu and Hangzhou-based Alibaba also maintain offices in Silicon Valley."
Ford Motor,2017-3,"To help fund Model 3 production, Tesla raised about $1.2 billion by selling common shares and convertible debt earlier this month. Tencent said its shares were acquired as part of the early March equity sale and on the open market."

Ford Motor,2017-3,"DETROIT/WASHINGTON, March 28 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co on Tuesday said it would invest $1.2 billion in three Michigan facilities and create 130 jobs in projects largely in line with a previous agreement with the United Auto Workers union, hours after U.S. President Donald Trump touted a ""major investment"" by the automaker on Twitter."
Ford Motor,2017-3,"In January, Ford scrapped plans to build a $1.6 billion car factory in Mexico and instead added 700 jobs in Michigan following Trumps criticism that centered on trade and investing in America. [nL1N1ET0V9]"
Ford Motor,2017-3,"Ford said on Tuesday it would spend $850 million on a planned upgrade of a plant in Wayne, Michigan, for the Ford Bronco, an SUV model, and the Ford Ranger - a mid-size pickup truck. The company will also invest $150 million and create 130 or retain jobs at an engine plant in Romeo."
Ford Motor,2017-3,"Both projects were part of 2015 negotiations with the UAW, when Ford said it would invest $9 billion in U.S. plants over four years."
Ford Motor,2017-3,"Ford also said it would invest $200 million in a data center in Flat Rock to support advances in vehicle connectivity and future developments in autonomous vehicles, but it will not result in any new hourly jobs."
Ford Motor,2017-3,The move comes at a time when U.S. new car and truck sales are at an all-time high and investors are watching closely for signs of a possible downturn in the highly-cyclical industry.
Ford Motor,2017-3,"""We're optimistic that we'll continue to see good economic growth for the U.S. in the near term,"" Joe Hinrichs, president of the Americas at Ford, told Reuters. ""We feel very confident about our plan and our products and about investing in Michigan and the U.S."""
Ford Motor,2017-3,"Separately, the Michigan Economic Development Corporation (MEDC) approved nearly $30 million in state incentives for Ford over 15 years at a meeting Tuesday. Ford will use the incentives to partially defray the costs of the improvements."
Ford Motor,2017-3,"The MEDC noted that Ford had considered locating some of the jobs in Mexico, where it is cheaper to employ workers. ""Incentive assistance was necessary to ensure the project moves forward in Michigan,"" the MEDC said."
Ford Motor,2017-3,The announcement by Ford on Tuesday comes less than two weeks after Trump visited Detroit to promise more auto jobs for Michigan and other Midwestern U.S. states. [nL2N1GS1B0]
Ford Motor,2017-3,Trump pounced on Ford's announcement before the company could release its plans on Tuesday.
Ford Motor,2017-3,"""Major investment to be made in three Michigan plants,"" Trump posted on Twitter early Tuesday. ""Car companies coming back to U.S. JOBS! JOBS! JOBS!"""
Ford Motor,2017-3,Trump has at times promoted job announcements at the White House that had been previously planned or announced. Last week he praised an investment decision by Charter Communications Inc that the company announced before he was elected. [nL2N1H1106]
Ford Motor,2017-3,"Steve Rattner, who was an automotive policy adviser under President Barack Obama, remarked on Twitter that Trump was misleading people about jobs, saying ""the big news ended up being only 130 jobs in (Michigan) that were announced back in 2015."""
Ford Motor,2017-3,"Ford said last week it expected higher investments, as well as other spending, to weigh on 2017 earnings. [nL2N1H00MR]"
Ford Motor,2017-3,"U.S. sales of new cars and trucks hit a record high of 17.55 million units in 2016. On Friday, industry consultants J.D. Power and LMC Automotive maintained their 2017 sales forecast of 17.6 million vehicles, an increase of 0.2 percent from 2016. [nL2N1H10FZ]"
Ford Motor,2017-3,"But they said automakers' incentive spending in the United States in the first half of March had hit a record for the month, breaking the previously set mark in March 2009 during the height of the Great Recession."
Ford Motor,2017-3,"On Monday, Moody's Investors service said it expected U.S. new vehicle sales to dip in 2017 and warned of a ""significant credit risk"" for auto lenders as competition for loans intensifies. [nL2N1H30BT]"
Ford Motor,2017-3,"Trump has focused on U.S. automotive jobs, meeting with company executives as well as pressuring - and praising - them on Twitter. Executives have also said they hope his administration will pursue tax and regulatory policies that would benefit U.S. manufacturers. [nL1N1EZ1CP]"
Ford Motor,2017-3,"Trump has repeatedly suggested automakers will build new plants in the United States, but no company has plans to do so."

Ford Motor,2017-3,{{20170323T213756.313+0000}}Trump's auto review may only slow march to better fuel efficiencyBy Nick Carey and Paul Lienert
Ford Motor,2017-3,"DETROIT, March 23 (Reuters) - When U.S. President Donald Trump announced a review last week of tough Obama-era vehicle emissions and fuel-efficiency standards, he proclaimed that the ""assault on the American auto industry is over."""
Ford Motor,2017-3,"But rules set by the Environmental Protection Agency may take a backseat to consumers demanding vehicles that guzzle less gas and automakers having to meet tougher standards if they want to export cars overseas, according to auto industry analysts."
Ford Motor,2017-3,"In the end, U.S. carmakers may just gain a few more years to meet the more stringent targets that former President Barack Obama's administration negotiated with the companies in 2012, analysts said."
Ford Motor,2017-3,"If Europe and China continue to toughen their emissions standards, ""the U.S. might become an outlier,"" American Axle President Mike Simonte told Reuters on Thursday."
Ford Motor,2017-3,"Trump's move was widely seen leading to a rollback or loosening of more stringent targets, which would slash vehicle exhaust emissions while effectively doubling average fuel economy to 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025."
Ford Motor,2017-3,"Automakers have argued the rules for 2022-2025 are too expensive and could cost American jobs, so the Trump administration's review was seen as a win for them. [nL2N1GS1B0]"
Ford Motor,2017-3,"On a conference call Thursday with investors, Bob Shanks, Ford Motor Co's chief financial officer, said, ""We are not seeking a rollback in any way. We just want to have a conversation around the levels we want to achieve."""
Ford Motor,2017-3,"The potential divide with the rest of the country could create a ""two-tiered environment with two sets of regulations,"" said Mark Wakefield, managing director of AlixPartners' automotive practice. This ""could drive costs higher if automakers have to build two versions of the same vehicle to meet the two different standards."""
Ford Motor,2017-3,"The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a trade group that sued to overturn the Obama-era rules on behalf of several big automakers, wrote the White House on Thursday urging talks to begin quickly with California to ensure that national standards remain in place."
Ford Motor,2017-3,"Kristin Dziczek, director of the Center for Automotive Research's labor and industry group, said U.S. automakers could find it hard to export cars to markets such as China and Europe with tougher regulatory regimes if the U.S. targets were rescinded."
Ford Motor,2017-3,"""I don't think we're going to see a rollback,"" she said. ""At most, I think we may see a slowing of the timetable"" for implementing the tougher standards."
Ford Motor,2017-3,"AlixPartners' Wakefield said if China, the world's largest market, continues pushing electric vehicles while America backpedals, it could lead to ""some movement of investment from the U.S. to China, especially as the latter market continues to grow."""
Ford Motor,2017-3,"General Motors Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV referred Reuters to public comments made by the industry's lobbying group, the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers."
Ford Motor,2017-3,"EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, a climate change skeptic, said the Obama administration estimated it would cost $200 billion over 13 years to comply with stricter standards, which he believes will lead to higher prices for consumers and jobs leaving the country."
Ford Motor,2017-3,"Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas said the auto industry expected to miss the 2022-2025 targets regardless of who occupied the White House, but he believes the EPA's recent move may carry relatively little weight."
Ford Motor,2017-3,"""Of all the things that are likely to drive fuel economy, I would rank the EPA a distant third on the list, behind consumer preferences and the direction of technology,"" he said."
Ford Motor,2017-3,"United Auto Workers union President Dennis Williams said while around 60 percent of U.S. auto sales are currently trucks and SUVs, consumers value fuel-economy improvements for those vehicles."
Ford Motor,2017-3,"""The automakers shouldn't make the mistake of sliding backward,"" Williams said. ""We're here to protect our (union) members, but we understand that in doing so we also have to look at the future."""

Ford Motor,2017-3,"BERLIN, March 16 (Reuters) - Carmakers and suppliers gave widely differing timelines for the introduction of self-driving vehicles on Thursday, showing the uncertainties surrounding the technology as well as a split between cautious established players and bullish new entrants."
Ford Motor,2017-3,"Chipmaker Nvidia , facing direct competition with the world's top chipmaker after Intel's $15 billion deal to buy autonomous driving technology firm Mobileye this week, gave the most optimistic predictions."
Ford Motor,2017-3,Chief Executive Jen-Hsun Huang forecast carmakers may speed up their plans in the light of technological advances and that fully self-driving cars could be on the road by 2025.
Ford Motor,2017-3,"""Because of deep learning, because of AI (artificial intelligence) computing, we've really supercharged our roadmap to autonomous vehicles,"" he said in a keynote speech to the Bosch Connected World conference in Berlin."
Ford Motor,2017-3,"Germany's Bosch [ROBG.UL], however, the world's biggest automotive supplier, gave a timetable as much as six years longer to get to the final stage before fully autonomous vehicles, and declined even to forecast when a totally self-driving car might take to the streets."
Ford Motor,2017-3,"Progress is fraught by issues including who is liable when a self-driving car has an accident, bringing down the costs of sensor technology and guarding against hacking."
Ford Motor,2017-3,"""Of course, we still have to prove that an autonomous car does better in driving and has less accidents than a human being,"" Bosch CEO Volkmar Denner told a news conference."
Ford Motor,2017-3,"Nvidia has applied its market-leading expertise in high-end computer graphics to the intense visualisation and simulation needs of autonomous cars, and has been working on artificial intelligence - teaching computers to learn to write their own software code - for a decade."
Ford Motor,2017-3,"""No human could write enough code to capture the vast diversity and complexity that we do so easily, called driving,"" said Huang."
Ford Motor,2017-3,"Together with Bosch executives, Huang presented a prototype AI on-board computer that is expected to go into production by the beginning of the next decade. The computer will use Nvidia's processing power to interpret data gathered by Bosch sensors."
Ford Motor,2017-3,"On the way to fully self-driving cars, levels of autonomy have been defined, with most cars on the road today at level two and Tesla ready to switch from level four to five - full autonomy - as soon as it is permitted to do so."
Ford Motor,2017-3,"Level three means drivers can turn away in well-understood environments such as motorway driving but must be ready to take back control, while level four means the automated system can control the vehicle in most environments."
Ford Motor,2017-3,"Independent technology analyst Richard Windsor wrote in a note this week he doubted automakers would have autonomous vehicles leaving factories by a typical self-imposed deadline of 2020, mainly because the liability issue was unresolved."
Ford Motor,2017-3,"""This is good news for the automotive industry which is notoriously slow to adapt to and implement new technology as it will have more time to defend its position against the new entrants,"" he wrote."
Ford Motor,2017-3,"But Nvidia's Huang said he expected to have chips available for level three automated driving by the end of this year and in customers' cars on the road by the end of 2018, with level four chips following the same pattern a year later."
Ford Motor,2017-3,That is at least a year ahead of the plans of most carmakers that have an autonomous-driving strategy.
Ford Motor,2017-3,"The head of autonomous driving at BMW told the conference the luxury carmaker was on its way to deliver a level three autonomous car in 2021, but could produce level four or five autonomous cars in the same year."
Ford Motor,2017-3,"""We believe we have the chance to make level three, level four and level five doable,"" he said. He told Reuters the decision on which levels to release would depend in part on the market, and that cars with more autonomy might first be produced in small batches for single fleets."
Ford Motor,2017-3,"Bosch said it saw level three vehicles being released with its on-board computer at the end of the decade, and level four driving not before 2025."
Ford Motor,2017-3,"Uber [UBER.UL], Baidu and Google spin-off Waymo are testing self-driving taxis, while carmakers including Volvo, Audi and Ford expect to have level four cars on the road by 2020 or 2021."
Ford Motor,2017-3,"Nvidia's Huang predicted those plans would speed up: ""In the near future, you're going to see these schedules pull in."""

Ford Motor,2017-3,"HANOI, March 16 (Reuters) - Vietnam on Thursday called on all companies doing business there to stop advertising on YouTube, Facebook and other social media until they find a way to halt the publication of ""toxic"" anti-government information."
Ford Motor,2017-3,"At a meeting with the information and communication minister, companies including the local operations of Unilever , Ford and Yamaha Motor <7272.T> all committed to obey the call to suspend YouTube advertising."

Ford Motor,2017-3,"Automakers argue the vehicle emissions rules, which would raise the fleet average fuel efficiency to more than 50 miles per gallon (mpg) by 2025 from 27.5 mpg in 2010, will impose significant costs and are out of step with consumer preferences.

The fuel standards were a central part of Obama's legacy on addressing climate change."

Ford Motor,2017-3,"Despite being launched almost a decade ago, the original XC60 has remained popular among buyers and been the automaker's best-selling model since 2009."

Ford Motor,2017-3,"March 3 (Reuters) - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is expected to announce next week it would reopen a review of 2022-2025 vehicle emissions requirements after automakers urged the Trump administration to reverse a decision under former President Barack Obama, a source said on Friday."
Ford Motor,2017-3,"Last week, trade groups representing General Motors Co , Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T>, Volkswagen AG , Ford Motor Co , Honda Motor Co <7267.T> and others formally asked new EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt to withdraw an Obama administration decision to lock in vehicle emission rules through 2025."
Ford Motor,2017-3,A person briefed on the matter who had seen the draft order restarting the review said it was expected to be unveiled next week. The source was not authorized to discuss contents of the order publicly.
Ford Motor,2017-3,"The EPA notice is expected to say that the agency plans to work in tandem with the U.S. Transportation Department to set consistent standards for corporate average fuel efficiency and emissions limits, the source said."
Ford Motor,2017-3,A White House spokeswoman and an EPA spokesman declined to comment.
Ford Motor,2017-3,"The EPA had until April 2018 to decide whether the 2022-2025 standards were feasible under a ""midterm review"" but in November moved up its decision to Jan. 13, just before Obama left office."

Ford Motor,2017-3,"GM CEO Mary Barra told reporters on Tuesday that automakers were ""looking to actually have the midterm review."" She said the review needs to look ""at all the different dynamics that are occurring."""
Ford Motor,2017-3,Automakers say the rules impose significant costs and are out of step with consumer preferences. Environmentalists say the rules save drivers fuel costs and should not be changed.
Ford Motor,2017-3,"In 2011, Obama announced an agreement with automakers to raise fuel efficiency standards to a fleet average of 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025. This, the administration said, would save motorists $1.7 trillion in fuel costs over the life of the vehicles but cost the auto industry about $200 billion over 13 years."
Ford Motor,2017-3,"In July, EPA said because Americans were buying fewer cars and more SUVs and trucks, it now estimated the fleet will average 50.8 mpg to 52.6 mpg in 2025."
Ford Motor,2017-3,"Earlier Friday, eight environmental organizations urged Pruitt not to reopen the issue. These included the Sierra Club, Union of Concerned Scientists, League of Conservation Voters and Natural Resources Defense Council."

Ford Motor,2017-3,"""With the industry at 10 percent you are in a push market,"" said Mark Wakefield, head of the North American automotive practice for consultancy AlixPartners. ""This is top cycle stuff."" In a push market, manufacturers try to unload vehicles, rather than respond to the pull of consumer demand."
Ford Motor,2017-3,"The challenge now for automakers is to avoid over-producing vehicles or launching a price war that could undermine profits, especially as rising interest rates make it more expensive to subsidize loans and leases, Wakefield said."
Ford Motor,2017-3,"""It's that fine balance,"" he said. ""How much can I push the boundary without prompting a reaction that pulls all of us down?"""
Ford Motor,2017-3,The tension surfaced in another round of sniping on Wednesday between GM and Ford over which one was more dependent on discounts to prop up pickup truck sales.

Ford Motor,2017-3,"NEW YORK, Feb 28 (Reuters) - Late this afternoon, the automakers Honda, Ford, Toyota, Nissan, Mazda and BMW will head to federal court in Miami to argue that a $1 billion plea agreement between the U.S. Justice Department and the airbag maker Takata Corporation should absolve them from liability for installing dangerous Takata airbags in tens of millions of cars sold in the U.S."
Ford Motor,2017-3,"As my colleague Joe White has reported, Takata has agreed to set up an $850 million fund to compensate automakers for the cost of replacing recalled airbags. [nL2N1GC1E1]"
Ford Motor,2017-3,"Owners of the cars, who are suing the automakers for economic damages in consolidated litigation, have a rather different view of the implications of Takata's guilty plea, which was approved Monday by U.S. District Judge George Steeh of Detroit. Their lawyers, led by Peter Prieto of Podhurst Orseck, claim to have plenty of evidence that carmakers were independently aware of problems with Takata's airbags."
Ford Motor,2017-3,"Takata's guilty plea, car owners argued in a status report filed Monday with U.S. District Judge Federico Moreno of Miami, proves nothing at all about what the carmakers themselves knew about flaws in the airbags, which were installed even after car owners began reporting dangerous ruptures."
Ford Motor,2017-3,"""Despite this knowledge, the automotive defendants continued to equip their vehicles with Takata's ticking time bombs and misrepresent to the unsuspecting public that their vehicles were safe,"" car owners said in the status report."
Ford Motor,2017-3,Car owners also claimed in their latest consolidated complaint that they deserve punitive damages from automakers.
Ford Motor,2017-3,The automakers said in their status report to Miami judge Morena that Takata's admissions in its agreement with the Justice Department undermine car owners' claims for economic losses.
Ford Motor,2017-3,"""The plea agreement confirms, among other things, that Takata engaged in a fraudulent scheme to keep the automotive defendants from knowing what Takata knew about the inflators and their potential to rupture,"" the carmakers said in a status report filed last week."
Ford Motor,2017-3,"""Even before Takata's admission of guilt, plaintiffs had no way to prove they suffered actual economic loss, as the automotive defendants are offering, and will continue to offer, free replacements of recalled Takata inflators. In short, Takata's guilty plea makes the theory of plaintiffs' case even more implausible than it already was."""
Ford Motor,2017-3,"Plaintiffs' lawyers said in their retort Monday that Honda and the other carmakers had overstated the impact of the Takata plea deal, which, ""neither excuses the automotive defendants' own reckless, deceptive conduct nor undermines the economic loss claims asserted against them."""
Ford Motor,2017-3,"The filing accused carmakers of opting to use Takata airbags to save time and money. In a response issued late Monday, Honda called the allegation that cost considerations led it to use a dangerous product ""categorically false,"" adding that Takata's airbag components were not even consistently priced lower than those of competitors. (Honda also reiterated that Takata's guilty plea belies car owners' economic loss claims.)"
Ford Motor,2017-3,"Takata and its U.S. subsidiary, TK Holdings, meanwhile, argued in their status report to Judge Moreno that the parent corporation's admissions in its plea deal with the government should have ""limited (if any) impact"" on car owners' economic loss claims in the consolidated civil litigation."
Ford Motor,2017-3,"As part of the plea deal, Takata agreed to establish a $125 million restitution fund for plaintiffs who were injured by defective airbags. Those claims are consolidated on a separate tracks from the economic loss claims."
Ford Motor,2017-3,"Plaintiffs' lawyers in the civil litigation had theorized in a pair of filings Monday before the Detroit judge overseeing the Takata criminal case that the parent corporation would try to use the plea agreement to shield its U.S. subsidiary from liability for car owners' economic losses. Instead, Takata and its subsidiary urged Judge Moreno to dismiss economic loss claims against both of them."
Ford Motor,2017-3,"At the moment, both sides' jockeying over the impact of the plea agreement is just posturing. All of the defendants have moved to dismiss the latest complaint by car owners. Those motions, which preceded the Takata plea deal, are pending before Judge Moreno. It's not clear, in other words, whether the judge will even consider Takata's admissions in deciding whether to keep the economic loss cases alive."
Ford Motor,2017-3,"If plaintiffs survive dismissal motions, the automaker defendants may well ask the judge to grant them summary judgment based on Takata's guilty plea. Lead counsel Prieto seems to be already primed to respond."

Ford Motor,2017-3,"WASHINGTON, Feb 28 (Reuters) - German automakers dominated Consumer Reports' annual ranking of automotive brands released on Tuesday, with Volkswagen AG's Audi leading the pack, while U.S. brands continued to lag despite gains for many."
Ford Motor,2017-3,"Jake Fisher, director of auto testing at the magazine, said German automakers rose largely due to improvements in reliability. ""Building one or two great vehicles is achievable, but making a whole lineup of excellent ones is much more difficult,"" Fisher said."

Ford Motor,2017-3,GM's Chevrolet brand moved up to 17th from 20th and its Cadillac brand moved up to 18th from 24th.
Ford Motor,2017-3,"Toyota Motor Corp's <7203.T> flagship brand fell from eighth to 11th place, falling out of the top 10 for the first time in recent years, after the magazine said its Tacoma pickup had reliability issues. Toyota's luxury Lexus unit fell from third to fourth."
Ford Motor,2017-3,"Fuji Heavy Industries' <7270.T> Subaru unit fell from second to fifth, while Korean auto brand Kia jumped to sixth, up five spots, followed by Mazda Motor Corp <7261.T> in seventh."

Ford Motor,2017-3,"Other top picks included the Honda Ridgeline as best compact pickup, Kia Optima best midsized sedan and Audi Q7 best luxury SUV."
Ford Motor,2017-3,"Nissan Motor Co's <7201.T> luxury Infiniti brand moved up six spots to 16, while its Nissan brand fell one spot to 22."
Ford Motor,2017-3,Some German automakers struggled. The Volkswagen brand fell eight spots to 23rd and Daimler's Mercedes-Benz fell six spots to 20th.
Ford Motor,2017-3,"The Fiat brand remained last again among all brands rated, and FCA's Jeep brand remained second-lowest overall. Consumer Reports does not recommend any Fiat Chrysler vehicles, while it recommends all Porsche, Mazda and BMW vehicles."
Ford Motor,2017-3,"Fisher said Fiat Chrysler models suffered from serious reliability problems and are ""not competitive"" in most segments. The non-profit magazine has more than 8 million subscribers and surveys hundreds of thousands of car owners. Many shoppers consult the ratings, and automakers routinely tout favorable ratings in advertising."
