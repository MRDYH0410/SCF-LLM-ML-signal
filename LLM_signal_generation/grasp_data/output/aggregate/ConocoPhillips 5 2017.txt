ConocoPhillips,2017-5,{{20170602T011530.236+0000}}Trump withdrawal from climate deal gets mixed response from U.S. companiesBy Emily Flitter and Valerie Volcovici
ConocoPhillips,2017-5,"NEW YORK/WASHINGTON, June 1 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday withdrawing the country from the Paris climate accord would stave off an economic crisis and protect American jobs - but many American companies seemed to disagree."
ConocoPhillips,2017-5,"Criticism of his decision rolled in from blue-chip companies like Facebook Inc , Apple Inc , Ford Motor Co and Microsoft Corp , while the response from fossil fuel groups with the most to gain from a relaxation of U.S. carbon emissions standards was muted."
ConocoPhillips,2017-5,Tesla Inc Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk and Walt Disney Co CEO Robert Iger said they would leave White House advisory councils over Trump's decision. [nL3N1IY5QF]
ConocoPhillips,2017-5,"In an interview on Thursday, the president of the World Coal Association, Benjamin Sporton, told Reuters that he had mixed feelings about Trump's announcement, adding he was eager to see a U.S. policy that actively promotes a place for coal in the global energy mix."
ConocoPhillips,2017-5,"""What we really need to see, if the president wants to re-enter the deal, is that he can change the agreement to recognize the role of all sources of energy, including coal,"" Sporton said, adding his group had described to administration officials the benefits of remaining in the agreement."
ConocoPhillips,2017-5,"The American Petroleum Institute, the oil and gas industry's biggest trade group, meanwhile, issued a statement saying it had never taken an official position on the Paris accord."
ConocoPhillips,2017-5,"A number of its members, including Exxon Mobil Corp and ConocoPhillips , had publicly supported the deal."
ConocoPhillips,2017-5,"""For us, our position on the Paris agreement... we need a framework like that to address the risks of climate change,"" Exxon Mobil CEO Darren Woods told reporters on the sidelines of the company's annual general meeting on Wednesday. [nL1N1IX15V]"
ConocoPhillips,2017-5,"Some other groups expressed measured support for Trump's decision, saying it provided an opportunity to fix problems with the deal."
ConocoPhillips,2017-5,"""Manufacturers support the spirit of the Paris Agreement and the effort to address climate change through a fair international agreement. But as the president has acknowledged, certain elements of this deal were not equitable for U.S. manufacturers,"" said Ross Eisenberg, vice president for energy and resources policy at the National Association of Manufacturers, in a statement to Reuters."
ConocoPhillips,2017-5,"A spokesman for Peabody Energy Corp , America's largest publicly traded coal miner, had said on Wednesday that the company would support a decision by Trump to withdraw from the Paris deal because the ""accord is flawed on a number of levels."""
ConocoPhillips,2017-5,"Trump vowed during his campaign to pull the United States out of the Paris deal, arguing the pact would cost the United States trillions of dollars, kill jobs, and stymie economic growth without providing tangible benefit."
ConocoPhillips,2017-5,"His critics have argued, however, that the risks of climate change require action, and that a shift to a low-carbon energy economy can create more jobs than it eliminates."
ConocoPhillips,2017-5,"Spokespeople for other extractive oil and mining groups, like the National Mining Association and the American Fuel & Petrochemicals Manufacturers, declined to comment on Trump's decision to withdraw from the Paris accord."
ConocoPhillips,2017-5,But a number of other business leaders derided it in forceful terms.
ConocoPhillips,2017-5,"""Today's decision is a setback for the environment and for the U.S.'s leadership position in the world,"" said Goldman Sachs Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein in his first-ever tweet. [nL1N1IY2CK]"
ConocoPhillips,2017-5,"""Disappointed with today's decision on the Paris Agreement. Climate change is real. Industry must now lead and not depend on government,"" tweeted General Electric Co's Jeff Immelt."
ConocoPhillips,2017-5,"Apple's CEO Tim Cook, meanwhile, posted to Twitter: ""Decision to withdraw from the #ParisAgreeement was wrong for our planet"" and ""Apple is committed to fight climate change and we will never waver""."
ConocoPhillips,2017-5,"""Withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement is bad for the environment, bad for the economy, and it puts our children's future at risk,"" wrote Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg in a Facebook post."

ConocoPhillips,2017-5,{{20170511T040101.518+0000}}Company climate risk disclosure would distort markets -IHS MarkitBy Nina Chestney
ConocoPhillips,2017-5,"LONDON, May 11 (Reuters) - Proposals by a G20-backed task force for companies to disclose how they manage climate risks would mislead investors and distort markets, according to research by analytics and data provider IHS Markit on Thursday."
ConocoPhillips,2017-5,"Last year, the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosure (TCFD), set up by the G20's Financial Stability Board, proposed that companies disclose in their public financial findings how they identify and manage risks to their business from climate change. [nL5N1E94RG]"
ConocoPhillips,2017-5,"Although the measures are voluntary, some of the task force's members argue they should become mandatory."
ConocoPhillips,2017-5,The TCFD was set up due to growing concerns among the financial community that assets are being mispriced because the full extent of climate risk is not being factored in and increased calls for company transparency.
ConocoPhillips,2017-5,IHS Markit said some of the TCFD's proposals could help investors better understand how firms manage potential climate risks but others would actually undermine the aim of improving capital allocation decisions and financial market functioning.
ConocoPhillips,2017-5,"Climate risk disclosure could lead to unintended consequences, such as investors downgrading other risks which might have similar financial impacts but do not have to be disclosed in the same way, the research said."
ConocoPhillips,2017-5,"""The task force's proposals are useful in terms of heightening the discussion around climate risk but eight decades of understanding of the materiality concept would be changed by this initiative,"" Daniel Yergin, IHS Markit vice chairman and co-author of the report, told Reuters."
ConocoPhillips,2017-5,"""The use of scenarios and metrics is misleading; there are issues around confidentiality and why should we single out just one risk?"""
ConocoPhillips,2017-5,"IHS Markit said its report was financed by oil firms BP , Chevron , ConocoPhillips and Total , which are in one of the sectors most exposed to climate-related financial impacts, but its conclusions were its own."
ConocoPhillips,2017-5,"Proposals for disclosing the financial impact of long-term scenarios and using metrics to quantify climate risk could be misleading, the report said."
ConocoPhillips,2017-5,"Not only are scenarios based on a large number of assumptions, the assumptions will vary according to different companies and sources and are not comparable, IHS Markit added."
ConocoPhillips,2017-5,A TCFD recommendation that oil and gas firms disclose information related to the cost of supply for current and future projects could undermine their competitive positions. Such costs change constantly due to market and technology changes.
ConocoPhillips,2017-5,"Companies could also face potential litigation if their future costs do not match the projected costs in their disclosures, the report said."
ConocoPhillips,2017-5,"After a public consultation, the TCFD is expected to bring its final recommendations to the G20 at its meeting in Germany in July. The TCFD has 32 members from large banks, insurance companies, asset management companies, pension funds, credit rating agencies and accounting and consulting firms."

ConocoPhillips,2017-5,"{{20170505T074000.881+0000}}BHP Billiton under pressure to sell shale, even as oil prices fallBy Sonali Paul"
ConocoPhillips,2017-5,"MELBOURNE, May 5 (Reuters) - BHP Billiton is facing pressure from two activist shareholders over its $20 billion splurge on U.S. shale oil and gas fields, but may resist calls to dump the business just as oil prices are sliding."
ConocoPhillips,2017-5,"Investors grumble that while BHP Billiton is a good operator in deepwater oil and gas, its shale business, first acquired in 2011, has been a capital drain and shareholders would be better off with a sale. But now may not be the right time."
ConocoPhillips,2017-5,"BHP says it sees petroleum as a core business, including most of the shale operations."
ConocoPhillips,2017-5,"""The risk is doing it for the wrong reasons - because people are telling you do it - and getting out quickly. We're at $40 oil. It's not necessarily the greatest time to be contemplating that,"" said Brenton Saunders, an analyst at BT Investment Management, which owns BHP shares."
ConocoPhillips,2017-5,"Australian boutique manager Tribeca Partners estimated BHP could fetch $10 billion for its shale assets, based on recent deals done in the Permian and Eagle Ford shale regions that implied prices of $30,000 to $40,000 per net acre."
ConocoPhillips,2017-5,"However BHP has said it wants to hold on to its Permian acreage, where it has been consolidating its position by picking up high grade acreage and is looking to trade acreage or work with companies with adjoining acreage to boost production."
ConocoPhillips,2017-5,It has also highlighted its success in slashing costs by 64 percent in the Black Hawk region over the past four years.
ConocoPhillips,2017-5,"""On many measures we're one of, if not the, lowest-cost operator,"" BHP CEO Andrew Mackenzie told investors in April, defending its rejection of a proposal by fund manager Elliott Management for the company to spin off its U.S. oil and gas assets."
ConocoPhillips,2017-5,"BHP can take comfort in kudos from energy consultants Wood Mackenzie, which said the company has among the lowest breakeven costs among shale operators in one of the richest parts of the Permian Basin, $30.20 a barrel."
ConocoPhillips,2017-5,"""BHP is active in the swap market, and we expect its operational success to open doors with swap and strategic partners,"" Wood Mackenzie said in a report, referring to the market for trading acreage with other operators."
ConocoPhillips,2017-5,"Its less attractive Fayetteville acreage, valued at $919 million on its books at the end of 2016, is back up for sale. [nL4N1HY1CF]"
ConocoPhillips,2017-5,"BT's Saunders said one way BHP could divest shale while retaining exposure to a potential recovery in oil prices would be to vend the shale assets to a well-regarded shale operator in return for an equity stake in that company, which it could sell down the track."
ConocoPhillips,2017-5,"Other operators active in areas where BHP holds acreage include ConocoPhillips , EOG Resources Inc , Anadarko Petroleum , and Marathon Oil Corp ."

ConocoPhillips,2017-5,"CALGARY, Alberta, May 4 (Reuters) - ConocoPhillips will lay off 300 Canadian workers after selling most local assets to domestic crude producer Cenovus Energy Inc , the Houston-based company said on Thursday."
ConocoPhillips,2017-5,"ConocoPhillips in March agreed to sell oil sands and western natural gas assets to Cenovus for C$17 billion ($12.4 billion), making it the latest international oil major to pull back from a region beset by high costs and low crude prices. [nL2N1H7108]"
ConocoPhillips,2017-5,"Norwegian oil company Statoil ASA , which late last year agreed to sell Canadian oil sands assets to local producer Athabasca Oil Corp , has also shed staff, a spokesman said on Thursday, without disclosing the precise number."
ConocoPhillips,2017-5,"The resulting layoffs will pile on to the high unemployment rate facing oil-producing Alberta province after the two-year crash in commodity prices. The unemployment rate was 8.4 percent in March, slightly down from months earlier, but still at a level not seen in more than 20 years."
ConocoPhillips,2017-5,"The government of Alberta has been publicly firm that the asset sales are good news as buyers have been domestic companies eyeing expansion. But privately, in written advice to Energy Minister Marg McCuaig-Boyd days after the Cenovus deal, a senior civil servant conceded one negative aspect in the ""financial and labour impact"" of the exodus."
ConocoPhillips,2017-5,"""Some energy jobs may be at risk because such mergers and acquisitions yield duplications and redundancies,"" according to the government briefing note, seen by Reuters under freedom-of-information laws."
ConocoPhillips,2017-5,"Asked about the note, Alberta Premier Rachel Notley said job losses are a cost of consolidation, although she does ""not necessarily"" anticipate more layoffs. The province is working hard to seek export markets for its landlocked energy products to ensure the sector's long-term stability, she said."
ConocoPhillips,2017-5,"ConocoPhillips spokesman Rob Evans said the layoffs will be mostly in the Canada's oil capital of Calgary, Alberta, and will occur by mid-May. The company had more than 2,000 staff in Canada as of late 2015."
ConocoPhillips,2017-5,Global energy majors have sold off more than $22.5 billion worth of Canadian oil sands assets so far this year to domestic companies. [nL1N1HZ2GV]
ConocoPhillips,2017-5,"Royal Dutch Shell , which in March agreed to sell most oil sands assets for $8.5 billion to Canadian Natural Resources , said at the time that layoffs among head office employees and technical staff were possible."
ConocoPhillips,2017-5,"Shell spokeswoman Tara Lemay on Thursday declined to provide a precise figure, saying most workers will be kept on and those laid off are eligible to apply for positions within Shell globally."

ConocoPhillips,2017-5,"{{20170505T074000.881+0000}}BHP Billiton under pressure to sell shale, even as oil prices fallBy Sonali Paul"
ConocoPhillips,2017-5,"MELBOURNE, May 5 (Reuters) - BHP Billiton is facing pressure from two activist shareholders over its $20 billion splurge on U.S. shale oil and gas fields, but may resist calls to dump the business just as oil prices are sliding."
ConocoPhillips,2017-5,"Investors grumble that while BHP Billiton is a good operator in deepwater oil and gas, its shale business, first acquired in 2011, has been a capital drain and shareholders would be better off with a sale. But now may not be the right time."
ConocoPhillips,2017-5,"BHP says it sees petroleum as a core business, including most of the shale operations."
ConocoPhillips,2017-5,"""The risk is doing it for the wrong reasons - because people are telling you do it - and getting out quickly. We're at $40 oil. It's not necessarily the greatest time to be contemplating that,"" said Brenton Saunders, an analyst at BT Investment Management, which owns BHP shares."
ConocoPhillips,2017-5,"Australian boutique manager Tribeca Partners estimated BHP could fetch $10 billion for its shale assets, based on recent deals done in the Permian and Eagle Ford shale regions that implied prices of $30,000 to $40,000 per net acre."
ConocoPhillips,2017-5,"However BHP has said it wants to hold on to its Permian acreage, where it has been consolidating its position by picking up high grade acreage and is looking to trade acreage or work with companies with adjoining acreage to boost production."
ConocoPhillips,2017-5,It has also highlighted its success in slashing costs by 64 percent in the Black Hawk region over the past four years.
ConocoPhillips,2017-5,"""On many measures we're one of, if not the, lowest-cost operator,"" BHP CEO Andrew Mackenzie told investors in April, defending its rejection of a proposal by fund manager Elliott Management for the company to spin off its U.S. oil and gas assets."
ConocoPhillips,2017-5,"BHP can take comfort in kudos from energy consultants Wood Mackenzie, which said the company has among the lowest breakeven costs among shale operators in one of the richest parts of the Permian Basin, $30.20 a barrel."
ConocoPhillips,2017-5,"""BHP is active in the swap market, and we expect its operational success to open doors with swap and strategic partners,"" Wood Mackenzie said in a report, referring to the market for trading acreage with other operators."
ConocoPhillips,2017-5,"Its less attractive Fayetteville acreage, valued at $919 million on its books at the end of 2016, is back up for sale. [nL4N1HY1CF]"
ConocoPhillips,2017-5,"BT's Saunders said one way BHP could divest shale while retaining exposure to a potential recovery in oil prices would be to vend the shale assets to a well-regarded shale operator in return for an equity stake in that company, which it could sell down the track."
ConocoPhillips,2017-5,"Other operators active in areas where BHP holds acreage include ConocoPhillips , EOG Resources Inc , Anadarko Petroleum , and Marathon Oil Corp ."

ConocoPhillips,2017-5,"CALGARY, Alberta, May 4 (Reuters) - ConocoPhillips will lay off 300 Canadian workers after selling most local assets to domestic crude producer Cenovus Energy Inc , the Houston-based company said on Thursday."
ConocoPhillips,2017-5,"ConocoPhillips in March agreed to sell oil sands and western natural gas assets to Cenovus for C$17 billion ($12.4 billion), making it the latest international oil major to pull back from a region beset by high costs and low crude prices. [nL2N1H7108]"
ConocoPhillips,2017-5,"Norwegian oil company Statoil ASA , which late last year agreed to sell Canadian oil sands assets to local producer Athabasca Oil Corp , has also shed staff, a spokesman said on Thursday, without disclosing the precise number."
ConocoPhillips,2017-5,"The resulting layoffs will pile on to the high unemployment rate facing oil-producing Alberta province after the two-year crash in commodity prices. The unemployment rate was 8.4 percent in March, slightly down from months earlier, but still at a level not seen in more than 20 years."
ConocoPhillips,2017-5,"The government of Alberta has been publicly firm that the asset sales are good news as buyers have been domestic companies eyeing expansion. But privately, in written advice to Energy Minister Marg McCuaig-Boyd days after the Cenovus deal, a senior civil servant conceded one negative aspect in the ""financial and labour impact"" of the exodus."
ConocoPhillips,2017-5,"""Some energy jobs may be at risk because such mergers and acquisitions yield duplications and redundancies,"" according to the government briefing note, seen by Reuters under freedom-of-information laws."
ConocoPhillips,2017-5,"Asked about the note, Alberta Premier Rachel Notley said job losses are a cost of consolidation, although she does ""not necessarily"" anticipate more layoffs. The province is working hard to seek export markets for its landlocked energy products to ensure the sector's long-term stability, she said."
ConocoPhillips,2017-5,"ConocoPhillips spokesman Rob Evans said the layoffs will be mostly in the Canada's oil capital of Calgary, Alberta, and will occur by mid-May. The company had more than 2,000 staff in Canada as of late 2015."
ConocoPhillips,2017-5,Global energy majors have sold off more than $22.5 billion worth of Canadian oil sands assets so far this year to domestic companies. [nL1N1HZ2GV]
ConocoPhillips,2017-5,"Royal Dutch Shell , which in March agreed to sell most oil sands assets for $8.5 billion to Canadian Natural Resources , said at the time that layoffs among head office employees and technical staff were possible."
ConocoPhillips,2017-5,"Shell spokeswoman Tara Lemay on Thursday declined to provide a precise figure, saying most workers will be kept on and those laid off are eligible to apply for positions within Shell globally."

ConocoPhillips,2017-5,"(New throughout, adds details from conference call; updates stock price, adds byline and HOUSTON dateline)"
ConocoPhillips,2017-5,"HOUSTON, May 2 (Reuters) - ConocoPhillips reported a surprise quarterly loss on Tuesday as operating costs came in higher than expected, sending its shares lower in afternoon trading."
ConocoPhillips,2017-5,"However, the largest U.S. independent oil producer's results reflected a slow but steady improvement across the industry bolstered by improved pricing for its oil and natural gas. Crude prices are up more than 50 percent from a year ago."
ConocoPhillips,2017-5,"Don Wallette Jr., chief financial officer, said the latest quarter included a $200 million loss from a currency hedge tied to the British pound and a benefit of about $100 million from a tax loss carry forward."
ConocoPhillips,2017-5,"The company expects to complete the sale of some Canadian oil sands and natural gas properties this quarter, and will finish a planned $3 billion share buyback by year end, he said in a conference call."
ConocoPhillips,2017-5,"The Houston-based company said its total realized price was $36.18 per barrel of oil equivalent in the first quarter, compared with $22.94 a year earlier. [nL1N1I40L4]"
ConocoPhillips,2017-5,"ConocoPhillips's production, excluding Libya, inched up 2 percent to 1.584 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) in the latest quarter. [nBw9bbtMja]"
ConocoPhillips,2017-5,That was higher than Wall Street expectations of 1.571 million boepd.
ConocoPhillips,2017-5,"""Production was above guidance, but this was outweighed by higher costs,"" Raymond James analyst Pavel Molchanov said."
ConocoPhillips,2017-5,"The company's operating expenses of $1.30 billion were higher than Raymond James' estimate of $1.24 billion, Molchanov said. Exploration expenses of $258 million on a pre-tax basis were also much larger than the $70 million Barclays analysts had estimated."
ConocoPhillips,2017-5,"ConocoPhillips said it expects production of between 1.495 million and 1.535 million boepd for the current quarter, excluding any output from Libya. The estimate does not reflect the impact of recently announced asset sales."
ConocoPhillips,2017-5,The oil producer said last month it would sell natural gas-heavy assets in San Juan basin to privately held Hilcorp Energy Co for about $3 billion and earlier agreed to sell oil sands and western Canadian natural gas assets to Cenovus Energy Inc for C$17.7 billion.
ConocoPhillips,2017-5,"ConocoPhillips has also marked other gas-weighted assets for sale, including some assets in the Anadarko basin, the Barnett shale field, and the Gulf of Mexico."
ConocoPhillips,2017-5,"Net profit was $800 million, or 62 cents per share, in the first quarter ended March 31, compared with a net loss of $1.5 billion, or $1.18 per share, a year earlier."
ConocoPhillips,2017-5,"Excluding a gain on the sale of assets in Canada, the company posted a loss of 2 cents per share. Analysts on average were expecting a profit of 1 cent per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S."

With the next frontier in cancer immunotherapy within reach, investors will be laser focused on the performance of Merck's Keytruda after Bristol-Myers reported strong quarterly growth for rival drug Opdivo last week.

ConocoPhillips,2017-5,"Aetna Inc, the third largest health insurer, reports first-quarter earnings. Investors will watch out for comments about the health insurer's plans on Obamacare market."
ConocoPhillips,2017-5,"HCA Holdings Inc, the largest for-profit hospital operator reports first-quarter results.
