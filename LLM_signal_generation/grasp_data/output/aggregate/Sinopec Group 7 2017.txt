Sinopec Group,2017-7,* To float tender to import 2 mln barrels U.S. crude in August
Sinopec Group,2017-7,"Aug 3 (Reuters) - Indian Oil Corp Ltd said it is in talks with its partners to scout for an alternative, cheaper site for the Pacific Northwest LNG terminal after the recent pullout of the lead developer cast doubt on the future of the Canadian project."
Sinopec Group,2017-7,"Malaysia's state-owned Petroliam Nasional Bhd (Petronas) [PETR.UL], which held a majority 62 percent stake in the proposed C$36 billion ($29 billion) Pacific NorthWest LNG Project in British Columbia, said last week it was abandoning the plan due to weak global prices. [nL1N1KG1CB]"
Sinopec Group,2017-7,"Sanjiv Singh, chairman of Indian Oil, which has a 10 percent stake in the Canadian project, said the company remained interest in going ahead with at least part of the plan."
Sinopec Group,2017-7,"""We are very much positive going ahead with the upstream part of it, which is gas production. Liquefaction and transportation further in the liquid form we are not pursuing, I mean, we don't want to pursue very aggressively as of now,"" he told a news conference."
Sinopec Group,2017-7,"""We are also looking at a different location which might be much less expensive than the earlier one,"" Singh said."
Sinopec Group,2017-7,"Indian Oil's head of business development, G.K. Satish, said consortium partners are talking about alternatives. He declined to comment on write-offs IOC might be taking in the next quarter for investment in the Canadian LNG project."
Sinopec Group,2017-7,Petronas's pullout dealt a blow to the project and its partners which would now have to invest additional capital to complete the project.
Sinopec Group,2017-7,"Indian Oil is the first partner to suggest the project could still go ahead, in modified form."
Sinopec Group,2017-7,"""Cost of liquefaction, transportation and retail outside Canada has gone up. And today we are finding that it may not be very attractive at the present prices,"" Singh said."
Sinopec Group,2017-7,"The other partners in the project are Chinese oil and gas giant Sinopec <600028.SS>, with 15 percent, Japex Montney Ltd, with 10 percent, and Petroleum Brunei, with 3 percent."
Sinopec Group,2017-7,"Petronas may have to write off up to $800 million for work already done on the Canadian project, analysts say. [nL3N1KI3AR]"
Sinopec Group,2017-7,Japan Petroleum Exploration Co (Japex) <1662.T> said on Wednesday it would take a loss of about C$102 million ($82 million) due to the scrapping of the project. [nL3N1KH1DJ]
Sinopec Group,2017-7,Indian Oil Corp planned to lift 1.2 million tonnes of the super-cooled fuel for 20 years from the British Columbia project for its 5 million tonne a year regasification LNG plant at Ennore in eastern India. Indian Oil was expecting deliveries from the western Canadian project to begin in 2020.
Sinopec Group,2017-7,"The company said it also expected a ""slight delay"" from Cameron LNG project in the United States and will see deliveries by the end of 2018."
Sinopec Group,2017-7,"Indian Oil will float a tender to import 2 million barrels of high sulphur U.S. crude in August. It intends to import high sulphur oil from the United States for as long as benchmark WTI prices are depressed, Finance Director A.K. Sharma said."
Sinopec Group,2017-7,"The company's net profit fell 45 percent in its fiscal first quarter of 2017, beating analysts' estimates, although higher inventory losses and lower refining margins weighed on profitability."
Sinopec Group,2017-7,"Analysts on average had expected a net profit of 30.63 billion rupees for the first quarter, Thomson Reuters data showed."
Sinopec Group,2017-7,"India's top refiner suffered an inventory loss - due to sudden changes in oil and refined product prices - of 40.4 billion rupees in the June quarter compared to a gain of 74.8 billion rupees a year ago, Sharma said."
Sinopec Group,2017-7,"The company's quarterly average gross refining margins, or profit earned on each barrel of crude processed, fell to $4.32 per barrel, compared with $9.98 per barrel in the same period last year."

Sinopec Group,2017-7,{{20170711T080001.775+0000}}China sets sights on oil benchmark after years of delaysBy Chen Aizhu and Florence Tan
Sinopec Group,2017-7,"BEIJING/SINGAPORE, July 11 (Reuters) - China has opened more than 6,000 trading accounts for its long-awaited crude futures contract - with three-quarters coming from individual traders - as it pushes ahead with plans to compete with global pricing benchmarks."
Sinopec Group,2017-7,"China's oil majors and about 150 brokerages have also registered, but the strong interest by 'mom-and-pop' investors looks set to mark out China's crude futures from western counterparts, which are dominated by institutional investors."
Sinopec Group,2017-7,"Shanghai International Energy Exchange (INE), which will run China's contract, says it is finalising technical issues. The contract has faced years of delays and there is still no set date, but INE and also trading participants now say a launch this year is almost certain. [nL4N1IE3AJ][nL3N1HF3RR]"
Sinopec Group,2017-7,"""The INE is striving to launch the crude oil futures within this year,"" a spokeswoman said, adding that the exchange has conducted four trials to ensure it is technically ready."
Sinopec Group,2017-7,Oil futures trading volume is small during Asian hours despite the region's role as the world's top consumer. [nL8N1JO05K]
Sinopec Group,2017-7,Shanghai's crude futures are aimed at giving China more clout in pricing crude in Asia and a share of the trillions of dollars in oil futures trade.
Sinopec Group,2017-7,"The INE hopes to attract foreign investors, and locally registered entities of JPMorgan and UBS are among those registered, although international players have raised concerns, including denomination in yuan, that may dampen early take-up."
Sinopec Group,2017-7,"Most oil trades are priced off two crude derivatives, U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) and London's Brent, traded on the Intercontinental Exchange and the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) owned by CME Group ."
Sinopec Group,2017-7,Earlier attempts to establish an Asian derivative crude contract by Singapore and Tokyo foundered. The only liquid crude futures in the region is the Oman contract on the Dubai Mercantile Exchange.
Sinopec Group,2017-7,Successful crude derivatives would be the jewel in the crown in China's push to ramp up futures trading on products from dates to steel to open up markets and offer new avenues for investors. [nL1N1JD07H]
Sinopec Group,2017-7,"While Chinese banks are barred from futures trading, the new market is expected to attract interest from deep-pocketed private equity firms and funds, while state-owned oil majors, like PetroChina <601857.SS> and Sinopec <600028.SS> will provide liquidity."
Sinopec Group,2017-7,"PetroChina is set to register two accounts and Sinopec is setting up a trading outfit in Shanghai dedicated to the contract, said senior company sources."
Sinopec Group,2017-7,"Independent refiners like Shandong Chambroad Group have also joined, while retail interest is strong."
Sinopec Group,2017-7,"Individuals already account for 80 percent of turnover on China's $8 trillion equity markets, and day traders have whipsawed commodities from eggs to iron ore in China over the past year."
Sinopec Group,2017-7,"Jin Changyi, a 40-year-old former hotel owner from eastern China, who began dabbling in Brent crude oil futures last year, has opened a 500,000-yuan ($75,000) account with a Shanghai-based brokerage and plans to act as a mini-broker for friends."
Sinopec Group,2017-7,"""The way it's designed it won't fluctuate wildly. Compared to trading Brent, the risks are more manageable,"" he told Reuters."
Sinopec Group,2017-7,"Executives at international banks and traders who have reviewed the contract rules and specifications warn of concerns including Beijing's clamp-down on capital outflows, unusually small price limits and China's heavy handed intervention in commodity markets last year. [nL5N1F90E1]"
Sinopec Group,2017-7,"""Everybody is staring at everybody else,"" said an official with a western investment bank who declined to be named due to company policy."
Sinopec Group,2017-7,"Reflecting a regulatory aim to stave off price volatility, the Shanghai contract has a 4 percent daily price fluctuation limit, half the limit for Chinese coking coal."
Sinopec Group,2017-7,"China's crude futures also do not have a mechanism to reset limits after a big price move, which means Shanghai trading could freeze while prices still move elsewhere. For WTI, for example, a $10 a barrel move activates circuit breakers to pause trade briefly until a new limit of another $10 is set."
Sinopec Group,2017-7,Industry players also worry about delays in issuing rules over storage and grades for deliveries.
Sinopec Group,2017-7,"The INE has yet to finalize details of warehouse tanks, including locations, rules over fuel blending and price differentials between grades, all key for helping industry participants decide on whether or not to take deliveries."
Sinopec Group,2017-7,"The INE spokeswoman said it is working on approved crude oil delivery points, which are located in the peninsulas of Liaodong and Shandong, Yangtze River Delta and Pearl River Delta."
Sinopec Group,2017-7,"""The contract will initially track Brent and WTI markets,"" said a derivatives trading manager with a Chinese state oil company, who declined to be named because he is not authorised to speak to media."
Sinopec Group,2017-7,"""It won't be an immediate success, but we're hopeful."""
