ConocoPhillips,2017-10,UPDATE 2-Australia's Oil Search buys into promising Alaska oil find - Reuters News
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,{{20171101T064826.194+0000}}UPDATE 2-Australia's Oil Search buys into promising Alaska oil find* Spain's Repsol sees field holding 1.2 bln barrels of oil
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,"MELBOURNE, Nov 1 (Reuters) - Australia's Oil Search Ltd has agreed to buy stakes in a huge oil find in Alaska for $400 million, in a surprise push to diversify from its sweet spot of gas in Papua New Guinea."
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,"Oil Search will pick up stakes in three oil blocks from privately owned U.S. firms Armstrong Energy and GMT Exploration giving it a roughly 26 percent holding in the Nanushuk play, co-owned by Spain's Repsol SA ."
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,"The play includes the Horseshoe block, which hit oil in March in what Repsol called the biggest U.S. onshore find in 30 years. It estimated the field could hold 1.2 billion barrels. [nFWN1GM0QP]"
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,"Oil Search bought in assuming the field holds 500 million barrels, expecting production to begin in 2023, with output to plateau at 80,000 to 120,000 barrels per day."
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,"""With the quality of the assets, the fact that they're tier 1, and the fact that we've gone in very conservatively against what Repsol are saying, I think we can demonstrate to the market that this will be a super deal for Oil Search in the medium term,"" Oil Search Chief Executive Peter Botten told Reuters."
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,"Investors were nervous about the $8 billion company's move into a region where it has no experience and which is dominated by giants like BP and ExxonMobil Corp , sending its shares down 3 percent, especially after it gave up on a push into Kurdistan."
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,Other Australian oil and gas producers rose more than 1 percent on Wednesday.
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,"""Questions will inevitably be asked about Oil Search's competitive advantage to play in Alaska until it proves its operational capability there,"" said Saul Kavonic, an analyst with energy consultants Wood Mackenzie."
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,"RBC analyst Ben Wilson said the move was well-timed near the bottom of the oil price cycle and with some of the appraisal work on the field already done. He said it had ""good prospects"" as the oil was high-grade."
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,"Botten began working on the deal eight months ago when oil prices were about 20 percent lower than now and said Oil Search managed to get the asset despite higher-priced interest from others in nearby fields, whom he declined to name."
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,"The owners of the neighbouring fields are ConocoPhillips , ExxonMobil and Italy's ENI ."
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,Oil Search has the option of doubling its stake in the Alaskan assets for a further $450 million. It plans to fund the deal from its cash reserves.
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,Oil Search will work with oilfield services giant Halliburton Co and Armstrong before taking over as operator of the assets in June 2018.

ConocoPhillips,2017-10,"{{20171026T111143.722+0000}}ConocoPhillips swings to quarterly profit as oil prices riseHOUSTON, Oct 26 (Reuters) - ConocoPhillips , the largest U.S. independent oil producer, said on Thursday it swung to a third-quarter profit helped by rising crude prices and cost cuts."
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,The company also lowered its 2017 capital budget by 10 percent to $4.5 billion.
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,"Conoco posted earnings of $420 million, or 34 cents per share, compared to a loss of $1.04 billion, or 84 cents per share, in the year-ago period. Production fell 23 percent to 1.2 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, due in part to the effects of Hurricane Harvey."

ConocoPhillips,2017-10,"APLNG, run by ConocoPhillips and Origin Energy , is one of three liquefied natural gas exporters on Australia's east coast that has come under fire for leaving the domestic market short of gas when it is badly needed for power plants as back-up for wind and solar energy.

ConocoPhillips,2017-10,"Origin, Australia's biggest energy retailer, has agreed to buy 41 petajoules (PJ) of gas from APLNG over the next 14 months, raising APLNG's sales into the home market to 186 PJ in 2018, meeting 30 percent of eastern Australia's gas demand."

ConocoPhillips,2017-10,{{20171025T194604.301+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-Western oil drillers flirt with OPEC-style dilemma(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are her own.)
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,"DALLAS, Oct 25 (Reuters Breakingviews) - It's a dilemma worthy of the OPEC cartel. U.S.-focused oil producers may be targeting higher returns rather than pumping more crude. Majors like Exxon Mobil and Chevron , reporting third-quarter earnings on Friday, know the trade-off, too. Selling less oil at a higher price is appealing if everyone joins in. But a history of internal tensions at the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries shows how easily self-interest prevails."
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,"Oil companies are better off than 20 months ago when the West Texas Intermediate price hovered around $30 a barrel: it is now above $50. Still, crude is plentiful and Anadarko Petroleum , Hess and ConocoPhillips , three large U.S. producers, cut capital-spending estimates last quarter. The U.S. rig count is falling, and earlier this week Halliburton Chief Executive Jeffrey Miller said his clients were focusing on ""cost-effective"" production."
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,"Some are shifting compensation plans for top executives to include more profit-related metrics like return on capital. Chevron restructured its pay in the spring, Evercore ISI notes, urging others to follow. In theory, if companies avoid drilling in expensive places they'll improve margins, and the reduced supply should in turn push up prices."
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,- ConocoPhillips is set to report third-quarter earnings on Oct. 26. Exxon Mobil and Chevron follow on Oct. 27.
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,"- Anadarko Petroleum and ConocoPhillips cut their capital-spending estimates last quarter, and U.S. rig counts have fallen in 10 of the past 13 weeks, according to Baker Hughes, though the count is still 64 percent higher than its level at the same time last year."
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,"- Halliburton Chief Executive Jeffrey Miller said on Oct. 23 in its third-quarter earnings call with analysts that the company's customers, which include oil producers in the U.S. Permian and Bakken basins, were focused on ""cost-effective"" production. He also said that in North America, a $50 per barrel oil price ""drives significant activity."""
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,"- On Oct. 11, the Energy Information Administration projected U.S. crude production would average 9.2 million barrels per day in 2017 and 9.9 million bpd in 2018, surpassing the previous record of 9.6 million bpd in 1970. The 2017 estimates fell slightly from the previous month, but the forecast for 2018 was slightly higher. Continental Resources Chief Executive Harold Hamm said on Sept. 21 that the EIA's predictions for U.S. oil production were ""flat wrong."""

ConocoPhillips,2017-10,"LAGOS, Oct 24 (Reuters) - Nigerian oil company Oando has obtained a court order to lift the suspension of trading in its shares and halt a forensic audit planned by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), court documents seen by Reuters showed on Tuesday."
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,"Oando's share price was frozen at 5.99 naira on Monday until further notice, the stock exchange said after the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) ordered the audit."
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,"The SEC suspended trading in the stock for 48 hours last week, saying it was investigating complaints about insider trading and discrepancies in its ownership structure.[nL8N1MT32N]"
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,"""The actions taken by the SEC, the suspension of the shares of the company and the initiation of a forensic audit, are prejudicial to the company,"" an Oando spokesman told Reuters."
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,"The Nigerian Stock Exchange said it was reviewing the court processes to provide an appropriate defence against the court order. The SEC declined to comment, saying that it was yet to receive the court order."
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,"By 1236 GMT, only 42,923 shares at the firm's fixed share price of 5.99 had traded. The company recorded no trades on Monday. A regulatory source said the freeze aimed to avoid volatile trading pending the outcome of the audit."
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,"In an SEC letter to Oando dated Oct. 17 the regulator accused Oando of corporate governance abuses and financial mismanagement, basing its allegations on two petitions received from Dahiru Barau Mangal and Ansbury Incorporated."
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,"It added that it would engage accountancy firm Deloitte to lead the audit together with lawyers and stockbrokers, at a cost of 160 million naira, which would be borne by Oando."
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,A company source has said the petitions centred on the ownership of some Oando shares bought through an investment vehicle at the time the company acquired the Nigerian subsidiary of U.S. oil company ConocoPhillips for $1.65 billion in 2014.
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,"Oando has said it was aware that the regulator had received petitions but the allegations were ""unsubstantiated, misleading and defamatory""."
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,"However, it had not received any notification from the regulator querying its compliance until the recent letter, adding that it has been cooperating with the SEC since the start of its investigation in May."
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,In July Oando's share price fell close to a one-month low after the regulator said it was investigating the firm's shareholding structure following the ConocoPhillips acquisition.[nL8N1K827V]
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,"Trading in Oando's shares have also been suspended in Johannesburg , where it has a secondary listing."

ConocoPhillips,2017-10,"Oct 23 (Reuters) - Oilfield services giant Halliburton Co on Monday warned of slower growth at its oil well drilling and evaluation business, reflecting a steady drop in rig counts in the United States."
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,"The outlook suggests Halliburton's current-quarter might not be as strong as its latest quarter, echoing warnings on Friday from its two bigger rivals, Schlumberger NV and Baker Hughes . [nL4N1MV3U5]"

ConocoPhillips,2017-10,"North American revenue from Halliburton's drilling and evaluation business is likely to fall in step with the average U.S. rig count in the fourth quarter, Chief Financial Officer Christopher Weber said on a conference call."
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,The company's drilling and evaluation business posted a 15 percent rise in revenue in the third quarter.
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,"After a strong start to the year, the average rig count in the United States has fallen in 10 of the past 12 weeks, soon after U.S. oil producers, including Anadarko Petroleum Corp and ConocoPhillips , cut their budgets for the year."

ConocoPhillips,2017-10,{{20171023T120848.700+0000}}Nigerian firm Oando's share price frozen pending regulatory auditBy Chijioke Ohuocha
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,"LAGOS, Oct 23 (Reuters) - Shares in Nigerian oil firm Oando Plc have been frozen at 5.99 naira until further notice, the stock exchange said on Monday after the regulator ordered a forensic audit into the company."
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,"The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had suspended trading in the stock for 48 hours last week, saying it was investigating complaints about insider trading and discrepancies in its ownership structure.[nL8N1MT32N]"
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,The regulator said it would freeze the price until further notice. A regulatory source said the freeze aimed to avoid volatile trading pending the outcome of the audit.
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,"By 1114 GMT, no trades at the firm's fixed share price had been reported."
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,"Oando has said it was aware the regulator had received petitions and said the allegations were ""unsubstantiated, misleading and defamatory""."
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,A company source has said the petitions centred around the ownership of some Oando shares bought through an investment vehicle at the time the company bought the Nigerian unit of U.S. firm ConocoPhillips for $1.65 billion in 2014.
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,"In July, Oando shares fell close to a one-month low after the regulator said it was investigating the firm's shareholding structure following the ConocoPhillips unit acquisition.[nL8N1K827V]"
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,"The SEC has said a team of auditors, lawyers, stockbrokers and share registrars would conduct the forensic audit to ensure independence."
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,"Trading in Oando's shares have also been suspended in Johannesburg , where it has a secondary listing."
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,Oando has gained 27 percent this year after a sharp fall last year. It last traded at 5.99 naira.

ConocoPhillips,2017-10,"{{20171020T182039.187+0000}}WRAPUP 3-Top oilfield services firms signal fourth-quarter uncertainty(Adds details on industry, CEO comments; updates share prices)"
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,"Oct 20 (Reuters) - The world's top two oilfield service firms on Friday warned slower producer spending and weakness in offshore exploration may weigh on current-quarter earnings, but said activity could improve in the longer term as the global crude market comes into balance."
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,"The outlook drove shares in both companies lower, with Schlumberger NV hitting a 21-month low and Baker Hughes touching a 16-month low before retracing some losses."
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,"Schlumberger, the world's largest oilfield service company, warned that Wall Street estimates for fourth-quarter earnings may be too high, with customer investments in North American production moderating due to investor pressure for improved shareholder returns."
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,"But global oil supply and demand is becoming more balanced and recent spending cutbacks on U.S. production could eventually boost crude prices, Schlumberger Chief Executive Paal Kibsgaard said."
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,"A current lack of production investments outside North America should benefit producers as inventories fall, Kibsgaard said."
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,"Baker Hughes' CEO Lorenzo Simonelli was more pessimistic, saying the oilfield services industry continues to be volatile and describing the business environment as ""challenging"" with customers pushing out some equipment purchases.[nL4N1MV3K7]"
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,"""We have seen some improvement in activity but we have not seen meaningful increases in customer capital commitments,"" he said."
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,Schlumberger was last down 3.3 percent at $62.33 and Baker Hughes off less than 1 percent at $33.08.
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,"U.S. oil producers are under pressure to boost shareholder returns after ramping up spending earlier this year while oil prices remained flat, knocking share prices back after a sharp run up in 2016."
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,Brent crude prices have barely budged this year and the U.S. crude benchmark has remained mostly below $55 a barrel.
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,"This summer, U.S. producers Anadarko Petroleum Corp , ConocoPhillips and Hess Corp cut second-half capital spending plans, including on oilfield services activities."
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,Crude's sub-$60 prices have also weighed on offshore exploration and driven a fresh round of consolidation among those drillers in a bid to tame excess capacity.
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,"""In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, activity continued to weaken in the third quarter, and the outlook remains bleak for this region based on current customer plans,"" Schlumberger's Kibsgaard said.[nL4N1MV3M9]"
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,"Baker Hughes, in its first report to include GE Co's oil and gas business since their merger, reported a third-quarter profit that missed analysts estimates by a wide margin."
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,"Schlumberger, however, matched analysts' profit estimates and posted a 43 percent jump in business from North America."
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,"Shares in Halliburton Co , due to report third-quarter results on Monday, were little changed."

ConocoPhillips,2017-10,{{20171020T145003.709+0000}}Cash-poor Alaska eyes foreign capital to jump-start energy projects By Rod Nickel
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,"HOUSTON, Oct 20 (Reuters) - Alaska is pursuing foreign investors for its oil and gas industry, hoping to advance recent discoveries while struggling to compete with lower-cost shale projects and reverse a decades-long output decline."
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,"Sovereign wealth funds, banks and state-owned energy companies have met with Alaskan officials, John Hendrix, chief energy adviser to Alaska Governor Bill Walker said in an interview. China Investment Corp (CIC) and state-owned Chinese energy company Sinopec held talks with state officials last month, he said."
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,"Alaskan crude production has fallen by three-quarters since 1988, a decline that has contributed to budget deficits and jeopardized the operation of the Trans-Alaska Oil Pipeline, which runs from the North Slope to the southern port of Valdez. This year, a state budget shortfall led the state to withhold hundreds of millions of dollars owed to small oil explorers."
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,"The nascent investment push is mostly focused on Asian firms, which Alaskan officials believe could take roles in a proposed natural gas pipeline and in individual energy projects, said Hendrix, a former energy executive."
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,But oil companies operating in Alaska say the state should fully fund its explorer-incentive payments that along with crude prices around $50 have put at risk projects on the North Slope and in the National Petroleum Reserve. Chinese capital for energy development also faces federal reviews that could block the state's effort.
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,"""It's a challenging sell,"" Hendrix said, adding that the proximity to Asian markets will boost the projects' appeal to energy importers. ""When you talk about (exporting) to the Far East, we're closer than California."""
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,"CIC and Sinopec expressed interest in an 800-mile proposed natural gas pipeline that would run from Prudhoe Bay to a southern port, as well as oil and gas production projects, he said."
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,"Sinopec is talking with Alaska about a potential investment in the gas pipeline, said a source in China with knowledge of the discussions. Sinopec and CIC declined to comment."
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,"Caelus, which disclosed a 6 billion-barrel North Slope oil discovery a year ago, delayed its drilling plans this summer, in part over the lack of incentive payments."
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,"""It's hard to plan when you don't know the rules,"" Caelus spokesman Casey Sullivan said."
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,"The state previously paid small companies for some costs of exploring and developing oil and gas projects, which are higher than in many other regions. This year, the state gave those companies only a portion, leaving hundreds of millions of dollars unpaid."
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,"Alaska's fiscal uncertainty helps create more risk than in other U.S. regions and could discourage sovereign wealth funds from investing, said Wood Mackenzie analyst Alison Wolters."
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,"The reason small companies are struggling to attract outside capital is the decline in state incentive payments, said Kara Moriarty, CEO of trade group Alaska Oil and Gas Association."
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,Foreign investment can be reviewed by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States to ensure that it does not pose national security risks.
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,"CFIUS reviews have halted energy deals involving foreign investment and the Trump administration appears skeptical of Chinese investment, said two CFIUS experts who spoke on condition of anonymity to protect business relationships."
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,"""I think it's going to be very difficult for Chinese to make significant investments in energy in the United States,"" one expert said."

ConocoPhillips,2017-10,"Oct 19 (Reuters) - Oilfield services giant Schlumberger Ltd sealed a deal to buy oil and gas assets worth $1 billion from Cenovus Energy on Thursday, raising further concerns about its strategy to own more refining and drilling operations directly."
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,"For Calgary, Alberta-based Cenovus, the sale is the latest in its plan to offload assets as it pays down debt, including loans it took up to fund its $13.3 billion purchase of oil sands and natural gas assets from ConocoPhillips . [nL3N1H65JB]"
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,"Cenovus's shares were up about 2 percent in afternoon trading, while Schlumberger's were down about 1.5 percent, along with other energy stocks due to lower crude oil prices."
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,"Schlumberger hopes the strategy will add to its profit, but investors worry it also exposes the company to global oil price swings and big losses if some projects fail."
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,"""The debate is how much (the Cenovus deal) truly diversifies risk as acquiring E&P assets implies taking on additional commodity risk, while international projects incur increased country risk,"" Barclays said."
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,"SPM will be the majority non-operating owner and services provider for the Palliser oil and natural gas assets in southeastern Alberta, which will be operated by Torxen Energy, a private exploration firm led by former Cenovus executive John Brannan. [nGNXOFAMHa]"
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,"The oil-focused development plan includes a multi-year program to drill more than 1,600 oil wells starting in 2018, the companies said, adding the sale will close this quarter."
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,"""Investors have been asking a lot of questions about Schlumberger's SPM strategy, fearing the business adds uncertain risk to the company's earnings,"" analyst Marc Bianchi at Cowen and Co said."
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,"""As a majority non-op owner, it appears Schlumberger is taking commodity risk on this project,"" he said."

ConocoPhillips,2017-10,"LAGOS, Oct 18 (Reuters) - Nigeria's Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said on Wednesday it had ordered the suspension of Oando shares, citing concerns about possible insider trading and the oil company's shareholding structure."
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,The SEC ordered the Nigerian Stock Exchange to implement a 48-hour suspension of Oando's shares after which it would implement a price freeze until further notice.
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,"Oando, which is also listed in Johannesburg , said it had received a communication from regulators on the share suspension, adding that it will state its position as soon as possible. [nL8N1MT5X5]"
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,"Its shares, which have gained 27 percent this year after a sharp fall last year, last traded at 5.99 naira in Lagos."
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,The regulator said it had carried out a comprehensive review of Oando after it received two petitions and found related party transactions were not conducted at arm's length and discrepancies in its ownership structure.
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,A company source said the petitions centred around the ownership of some Oando shares bought through an investment vehicle at the time the company bought ConocoPhillips' Nigerian business for $1.65 billion in 2014.
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,"""The commission notes that the above findings are weighty and therefore needs to be further investigated. After due consideration, the commission believes that it is necessary to conduct a forensic audit into the affairs of Oando Plc,"" the SEC said in a statement."
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,"It said a team of auditors, lawyers, stockbrokers and share registrars would conduct the forensic audit on Oando to ensure independence."
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,Last month Nigeria's lower house of parliament gave the SEC two weeks to disclose the results of its investigation into the oil firm. [nL8N1M84QB]

ConocoPhillips,2017-10,"SINGAPORE, Oct 12 (Reuters) - The appeal of Indonesia's oil and gas sector is improving for some independent producers as the resource-rich nation scrambles to reduce its dependence on imports and fill a gap left by the exit of some producers, the head of GSS Energy told Reuters."
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,"""There could be some assets that will be available that three or five years ago would have been very difficult to gain access to for a relatively small and new player like us,"" said Sydney Yeung, group chief executive at Singapore-listed GSS Energy at the Reuters Global Commodity Summit."
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,"Amid depressed oil prices, international oil companies such as ConocoPhillips and Chevron have reduced their holdings in Indonesia, a former member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. As a result, the country has struggled to attract fresh investment and to develop new fields. [nL4N1F92DN][nL3N1BS0ZN][nJ9N1DH01M]"
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,"The risks that energy investors face in Indonesia are highlighted by recent change to the development plans of the Masela gas field developed by Japan's Inpex <1605.T>. There has also been a long-standing dispute between France's Total and Indonesia's government over the Mahakam block, the country's largest gas-producing field."
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,"The recent departure of the producers, as well as its drive to reduce its dependence on imports, ""can only force the government to move faster"" in implementing more favourable policies and incentives for operators, said Yeung at the Summit held at the Reuters office in Singapore."
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,"Indonesia's crude oil output peaked at around 1.7 million barrels per day (bpd) in the mid-1990s. But with few significant oil discoveries in the past 10 years, production has fallen to roughly half that as old fields have matured and died."
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,"""Indonesia is a net importer of oil not because there's a lack of resources,"" said Yeung, but because ""previous policies that did not encourage or anticipate the demand they needed and did not push as aggressively as they should have."""
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,"With oil demand at about 1.2 million bpd and production at about 800,000 bpd, investors in Indonesia's oil and gas sector will have a big supply gap to fill, said Yeung."
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,"The energy industry is a vital part of the Indonesian economy, but its contribution to state revenue has dropped from around 25 percent in 2006 to an expected 3.4 percent this year, according to data compiled by consulting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers."
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,"""It's very clear to me that Indonesia's number one agenda is to push its economy forward as fast as they can but that would be difficult without greater energy supply,"" said Sydney."

ConocoPhillips,2017-10,"Matt Rogers, meteorologist at Commodity Weather Group, said the rapid speed of the storm could keep it from becoming more than a Category 1 hurricane, producing up to 80 mile per hour (129 kph) winds."
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,"""In our view it is not going to be strong enough to do damage"" to offshore production facilities, he said. ""Usually when storms move this quickly they have troubles developing,"" he said."
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,"The U.S. Coast Guard declared condition ""X-Ray"" at the port of New Orleans ahead of Nate, which means gale force winds could come within 48 hours. Commercial vessels and large barges must report to the Coast Guard to decide whether to depart or remain."
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,"Parts of the Mississippi River, which flows past New Orleans and is a major transit hub for oil and other commodities, have been closed to inbound deep draft vessels."
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,"The region's oil refineries are still recovering from Harvey, which shut production at some plants for weeks. Producers also curtailed some production but quickly resumed output."

ConocoPhillips,2017-10,"Commodity Weather forecast Nate to bring moderate rainfall when it makes landfall somewhere west of Mobile Bay, Alabama, and east of New Orleans, Louisiana. It expects between 4 inches and 6 inches (10-15 centimeters) of rain to fall in the path of the storm."

ConocoPhillips,2017-10,"HOUSTON, Oct 5 (Reuters) - Oil and natural gas operators began evacuating staff and halting production at U.S. Gulf of Mexico platforms on Thursday ahead of Tropical Storm Nate, the second storm in as many months to rattle the Gulf Coast energy corridor."
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,"Nate, which has killed at least 10 people in Costa Rica and Nicaragua and caused intense rainfall, is forecast to scrape Honduras and Mexico, enter the Gulf and strengthen into a hurricane before making landfall this weekend in Louisiana, near several major refineries. [nL2N1MG1B2]"
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,"That path takes it through an area populated by offshore oil and natural gas platforms, which pump more than 1.6 million barrels of crude per day (bpd), about 17 percent of U.S. output, according to government data."
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,"About 14.6 percent of U.S. Gulf oil production equaling 254,607 bpd was offline on Thursday, the U.S. Department of the Interior's Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) said. About 6.4 percent of natural gas output in the area also was shut. [nL2N1MG1XD]"
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,Forecasts for Nate have shifted westward in the past 24 hours. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) had forecast on Wednesday that the storm would make landfall in the Florida panhandle.
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,"BP Plc and Chevron Corp were shutting production at all Gulf platforms, while Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Anadarko Petroleum Corp suspended some production and some drilling activity in the Gulf. [L2N1MG2AB][nFWN1MG0JP][nL2N1MG21E][nL2N1MG234]"
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,"Exxon Mobil Corp , Statoil and other producers have withdrawn personnel from their platforms. [nL2N1MG20Z][nL4N1MG02R][nL2N1MG140][nFWN1MF0G4]"
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,Marathon Oil Corp and ConocoPhillips said they were monitoring Nate's path but have taken no action yet.
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,"Nate, the 14th named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, comes less than two months after Hurricane Harvey tore through the Gulf, denting about a quarter of oil production there, according to government data."
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,"Several Texas ports are still unable to allow large tankers to enter after Harvey as they await dredging. Some large tankers have been rerouted to Louisiana ports, some of which are now in Nate's projected path."
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,"The Louisiana Offshore Oil Port (LOOP), an offshore gathering hub for production platforms and crude imports from tankers, has not suspended operations and vessel activity around it continues as normal, officials said on Thursday."
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,"All Louisiana ports were open as authorities and the U.S. Coast Guard monitored the storm, according to the Port Association of Louisiana."
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,Refiners in Louisiana also have been scrambling ahead of Nate.
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,"Shell was reducing production on Thursday at its 225,800-bpd Norco refinery and Phillips 66 was considering temporarily shutting the 247,000-bpd Alliance refinery or placing it on standby, according to sources. [nL2N1MG1WA][nL2N1MG1XO]"
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,"At least three other refineries were preparing to continue operation through Nate, sources familiar with plant operations said. PBF Energy Inc's Chalmette, Louisiana, refinery planned to remain in operation, sources said. [nL2N1MG0Z9]"
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,PBF declined to discuss operations at the Chalmette refinery. Shell spokesman Ray Fisher said officials at its refining and chemical plants were monitoring the storm.
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,"Chevron said its Pascagoula, Mississippi, refinery was monitoring the storm's progress. Exxon said the same about its refinery and chemical plant in Baton Rouge, Louisiana."

ConocoPhillips,2017-10,"HOUSTON, Oct 5 (Reuters) - Oil and natural gas producers began evacuating staff at U.S. Gulf of Mexico platforms on Thursday ahead of Tropical Storm Nate, the second storm in as many months to threaten Gulf Coast oil and refining facilities."
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,"Nate, which has already killed three people in Costa Rica, according to local authorities, is forecast to scrape past Honduras and Mexico, enter the Gulf and strengthen into a hurricane before making landfall early on Sunday in Louisiana, near several major refineries."
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,"That path takes it through an area populated by offshore oil and natural gas platforms, which pumps more than 1.6 million barrels of crude per day, about 17 percent of U.S. output, according to government data."
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,Forecasts for Nate have shifted in the past 24 hours. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) had forecast on Wednesday that the storm would make landfall in the Florida panhandle.
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,"Chevron Corp , Exxon Mobil Corp , Royal Dutch Shell Plc and others have begun withdrawing personnel from Gulf platforms.[nL4N1MG02R][nL2N1MG140][nFWN1MF0G4]"
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,Marathon Oil Corp and ConocoPhillips said they were monitoring Nate's path but have taken no action yet.
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,"Nate, the 14th named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, comes less than two months after Hurricane Harvey tore through the Gulf, denting more than a quarter of oil production there, according to government data."
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,"Several Texas ports have been unable to allow large tankers to return after Harvey as they wait for dredging of channels. Some large tankers have been re-routed to Louisiana ports, some of which are now in Nate's projected path."
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,"The Louisiana Offshore Oil Port (LOOP), an offshore gathering hub for production platforms and crude imports from tankers, has not suspended operations and vessel activity around it continues as normal, officials said."
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,"All Louisiana ports were open and fully working on Thursday as authorities and the U.S. Coast Guard monitor the storm, according to the Port Association of Louisiana."
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,"""We are used to these type of things, so we have a hurricane plan we have put in place as we continue to monitor the storm,"" said Bill Rase, director of the Lake Charles port, which operated with restrictions after Harvey until Tuesday."
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,"Refiners in Louisiana also have been scrambling ahead of Nate. At least three Louisiana refineries were preparing to continue operation through Nate, sources familiar with plant operations said on Thursday.[nL2N1MG0Z9]"
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,"PBF Energy's Chalmette, Louisiana, refinery and Shell's refineries in Convent and Norco, Louisiana, were preparing for the storm, but planned to remain in operation, the sources said."
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,A PBF spokesman declined to discuss operations at the Chalmette refinery. A Shell spokesman was not available to comment.
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,"Chevron said its Pascagoula, Mississippi, refinery was monitoring the storm's progress. Exxon said the same about its refinery and chemical plant in Baton Rouge, Louisiana."
ConocoPhillips,2017-10,"A Marathon Petroleum Corp spokesman declined to discuss operations at the company's Garyville, Louisiana, refinery."
