Chevron,2017-7,"LAGOS, Aug 3 (Reuters) - Nigeria's state oil company said on Thursday it had signed financing agreements with Chevron and Shell worth at least $780 million to boost crude production and reserves."
Chevron,2017-7,The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) said a joint venture agreement with Chevron Nigeria Limited would see the development of proven and probable reserves of 211 million barrels at the joint Sonam project.
Chevron,2017-7,"""The project is expected to begin to bear fruits in (the) next three and six months,"" NNPC said in a statement, adding it was targeting production of 39,000 barrels per day of liquids and 283 million standard cubic feet of gas per day."
Chevron,2017-7,It also said a joint venture with Shell Petroleum Development Company would lead to the development of a project comprising of 156 development activities across 12 oil mining licences in the Niger Delta oil hub.
Chevron,2017-7,NNPC said the deal with Chevron would provide the $780 million needed to complete the Sonam project on which the U.S. company has already spent $1.5 billion.
Chevron,2017-7,"NNPC said the project with Shell, called Santolina, required third-party funding of $1 billion, without saying whether this was covered by the deal."
Chevron,2017-7,The OPEC producer has struggled to fund its part of joint ventures with foreign partners through so called cash-calls which often got delayed in parliament.
Chevron,2017-7,Nigeria has been since last year holding talks with oil majors over new finance agreements for joint ventures.

Chevron,2017-7,"* Oil firms bring big budgets, offshore tech and risk experience"
Chevron,2017-7,"LONDON, Aug 1 (Reuters) - Some European oil majors have made inroads into the emerging U.S. offshore wind energy market, aiming to leverage their experience of deepwater development and the crowded offshore wind arena at home."
Chevron,2017-7,"Late entrants to the offshore wind game in Europe, which began with a project off Denmark 25 years ago and is now approaching maturity, they are looking across the Atlantic at what they view as a huge and potentially lucrative new market."
Chevron,2017-7,"Norway's Statoil has won a licence to develop a wind farm of the New York coast, is marketing its new floating turbine to California and Hawaii and is retraining some oil and gas staff to work in its wind division."
Chevron,2017-7,"Royal Dutch Shell bid for a lease offshore North Carolina earlier this year while Denmark's DONG Energy, a wind energy pioneer which agreed to sell its oil and gas business in May, is in a Massachusetts-based offshore wind consortium, holds a lease off the New Jersey coast and has opened an office in Boston."
Chevron,2017-7,"Offshore wind generation began in the United States late last year, ironically after the election of President Donald Trump. He is sceptical about climate change, complains about subsidies for renewable energy and battled against an offshore wind farm near his Scottish golf resort."
Chevron,2017-7,"However, a string of federal seabed leases were awarded before Trump took office and more are planned. [L5N1KM40R] The investment needed to get projects going is one of the biggest obstacles."
Chevron,2017-7,"""Undeniably, offshore wind is a big boys' game because it requires large amounts of capital because scale is such an important cost driver,"" said Samuel Leupold chief executive of DONG Energy's offshore wind business."
Chevron,2017-7,"While DONG has shifted decisively towards renewables, Statoil and Shell are still firmly rooted in fossil fuels and other major European oil companies, in common with their U.S. counterparts, have so far steered clear of U.S. offshore wind."
Chevron,2017-7,"Washington estimates its potential at 2,000 gigawatts (GW), many times anticipated capacity in Europe of 25 GW by 2020, but U.S. federal subsidies expire at the end of 2019 and while they may be renewed by Congress, that is no means certain."
Chevron,2017-7,"Costs in Europe have fallen to a level that enabled DONG to place a zero subsidy bid earlier this year, but offshore wind farms are still multi-billion dollar projects. A push into deeper U.S. waters and the bigger turbines needed to compete without subsidies will keep price tags high.[nL8N1JJ2OL]"
Chevron,2017-7,"Trump signed an executive order in March expected to roll back his predecessor Barack Obama's plan requiring states to slash carbon emissions from power plants. There is also no carbon price mechanism across the United States like those in Europe and elsewhere, although there are two regional ones."
Chevron,2017-7,"U.S. oil companies have some investments in solar and onshore wind, but when it comes to offshore wind, many say they are waiting for a time when government support is not needed."
Chevron,2017-7,"""Chevron supports renewables that are scalable and can compete without subsidies,"" said Morgan Krinklaw, a spokesman for Chevron, which owns an onshore wind farm."
Chevron,2017-7,"A report from analysts at Lazard in December pegged the cost of U.S. offshore wind at $118 MWh, around twice as much as onshore wind or combined-cycle gas turbines."
Chevron,2017-7,"Asked to comment on that figure, Statoil, which is building its first floating wind turbine park off the Scottish coast, said costs were coming down and it was working to drive them down further, partly by redeploying existing staff."
Chevron,2017-7,"The company has about 1,000 employees in the U.S. oil industry, said Stephen Bull, senior vice president of the company's wind business. ""There's scope for us to plug into our existing oil and gas supply chain,"" he added, referring to existing contracts with equipment and service suppliers."
Chevron,2017-7,"Statoil spokeswoman Elin Isaksen said she did not expect any of its offshore wind projects in the U.S. to have begun construction by 2019 and that it was too early to quote numbers for the New York project, while acknowledging there was, as yet, no supply chain."
Chevron,2017-7,"In Virginia, where Spanish utility Iberdrola's Avangrid has secured an offshore wind licence, a rich marine engineering heritage is expected to help local companies gain work. Smaller European oil and gas firms are also gaining work."
Chevron,2017-7,"JDR Cable Systems, a British company that has traditionally supplied subsea power lines to oil and gas platforms, earlier this year won a $275 million contract to provide electric cables for the largest U.S. offshore wind farm off the Maryland coast."
Chevron,2017-7,"""We are well placed to develop business in the U.S. because of the existing relationships we have in Europe,"" said John Price, global sales director for renewables at JDR."
Chevron,2017-7,"State level decision-making on electricity procurement, the next stage of getting offshore wind off the ground, is helping."
Chevron,2017-7,"Massachusetts, where DONG has secured a seabed license, last year issued a law requiring its utilities to buy up to 1.6 GW of offshore wind power by June 2027, with a tender to be held later this year."
Chevron,2017-7,"DONG's North America wind power president Thomas Bostrom said it would bid in the Massachusetts power purchase tender in December and would not comment on costs ahead of that. He too, emphasised his company was playing the long game."
Chevron,2017-7,"""As excited as we are for offshore wind in the U.S., we are still in the early days of the industry,"" Bostrom said."
Chevron,2017-7,{{20170731T161855.505+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-U.S. sanctions on Venezuela a double-edged sword (The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are her own.)
Chevron,2017-7,"WASHINGTON, July 31 (Reuters Breakingviews) - President Nicolas Maduro said Sunday's vote for a new Constituent Assembly would bring peace to the country, but the immediate impact is likely to be expanded U.S. sanctions. Fresh trade measures by Washington may embolden opposition to Maduro, including from the military. That offers hope for Venezuelans, but American companies like Phillips 66 and Chevron would share the costs."
Chevron,2017-7,"Members of the new legislative super-body elected on Sunday will have the authority to rewrite the constitution and to override the opposition-controlled National Assembly, strengthening the Socialist president's grip on power. The administration of President Donald Trump, which last week imposed sanctions on 13 of Maduro's closest allies, has threatened to respond by targeting the South American country's oil sector with new restrictions."
Chevron,2017-7,"Venezuela is the third-largest supplier of crude oil to the United States, providing an average of 741,000 barrels a day last year, according to the Energy Information Administration. U.S. companies such as Phillips 66 and Chevron, which respectively took 18.5 percent and 13.1 percent of Venezuelan crude exports in 2016, will feel the impact if Washington interrupts that trade."
Chevron,2017-7,"Even if new sanctions prohibit only exports to Venezuela, U.S. oil companies would have a lot to lose. Venezuela bought 75,000 barrels a day of light crude from the United States in 2016, or nearly 15 percent of American exports. PDVSA mixes that with its heavy crude to make it commercially viable. American refineries that sell to Venezuela would have to find alternative customers."
Chevron,2017-7,"The U.S. oil industry is already facing the costs of government sanctions against Russia and Iran. Economic measures against Venezuela might bring diplomatic success, but it would surely come at an additional price."
Chevron,2017-7,"- Venezuelans on July 30 elected members of a new Constituent Assembly backed by President Nicolas Maduro's ruling Socialist Party that will have authority to rewrite the constitution and override the opposition-led National Assembly. U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley called the vote a ""sham election"" that marked ""another step toward dictatorship."""
Chevron,2017-7,"- President Donald Trump previously threatened ""strong and swift economic actions"" against Maduro if he followed through with the election. His administration has not ruled out any options, including a ban on trade or banking activity between Venezuelan and American companies."
Chevron,2017-7,"- On July 28, the United States imposed sanctions on 13 of Maduro's closest associates, including members of the government, the military and PDVSA, the state oil company. The measure froze the officials' assets in the United States."
Chevron,2017-7,"- The two countries' oil sectors are closely linked. The United States is PDVSA's largest cash-generating export market, and the South American country is the third-largest U.S. crude oil supplier."

Chevron,2017-7,"LONDON, July 21 (Reuters) - After a brief respite at the start of the year, the world's top oil and gas companies are set to double down on cost cutting as a recovery in crude prices after a three-year slump falters."
Chevron,2017-7,"Corporate hopes were raised by a deal between members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other non-OPEC producers to cut production, which lifted oil prices above $58 a barrel in January, after they had slid to as low as $27 in 2016."
Chevron,2017-7,"But Brent crude prices have since slipped back below $50 and banks have lowered price forecasts, amid surging output from the United States and other nations not bound by the global oil pact."
Chevron,2017-7,"Investors are again focussing on the ability of top oil firms such as Exxon Mobil , Royal Dutch Shell and Total to live within their means and eke out profits when oil has failed to recover, as hoped, to $60."
Chevron,2017-7,"The majors, often dubbed Big Oil, have already been through tough spending cuts since a collapse in crude prices since mid-2014 from above $100. They have shed thousands of jobs, scrapped projects, sold assets and squeezed service costs."
Chevron,2017-7,"Net income for Exxon, Chevron , Shell, BP , Total, Eni and Statoil is set to double on average in the quarter ending June 30 from a year earlier, even though oil prices are back as similar levels, according to analyst estimates compiled by Reuters."
Chevron,2017-7,"By early 2017, management teams said their operations in 2017 would cover spending and dividend payouts at $60 a barrel, although for many firms this included using scrip programmes, when investors can opt for dividend payouts in shares not cash."
Chevron,2017-7,"But earlier savings may not now be enough, with Brent crude averaging below $50 in the second quarter and forecasts that the 2017 average will be $54. [O/POLL]"
Chevron,2017-7,"While net income for Q2 may climb year-on-year, the quarter-on-quarter picture is different. Compared to the first three months of the year, the second quarter will see net income fall by about 20 percent, according to analyst estimates."

Chevron,2017-7,"HOUSTON/WASHINGTON, July 21 (Reuters) - The United States is considering financial sanctions on Venezuela that would halt dollar payments for the country's oil, according to a senior White House official and an adviser with direct knowledge of the discussions."
Chevron,2017-7,The move could severely restrict the OPEC nation's crude exports and starve its socialist government of hard currency.
Chevron,2017-7,"Sanctions prohibiting any transaction in U.S. currency by Venezuela's state-run oil firm, PDVSA, are among the toughest of various oil-related measures under discussion at the White House, the two sources told Reuters."
Chevron,2017-7,The administration aims to pressure socialist President Nicolas Maduro into aborting plans for a controversial new congress that critics say would cement him as a dictator.
Chevron,2017-7,"Venezuela's oil-based economy is in the grip of a brutal recession and a local currency crash, and Maduro has faced months of anti-government unrest that has claimed the lives of about 100 people. Sanctions on dollar transactions would make it even harder for Maduro's government to secure cash for debt payments and finance imports of basic goods."
Chevron,2017-7,The White House declined to comment on the sanctions under consideration. PDVSA and Venezuela's Oil Ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Chevron,2017-7,The U.S. measures under discussion are similar to those that were imposed against Iran over its nuclear program - which halved Iran's oil exports and prevented top crude buyers from paying for Iranian oil.
Chevron,2017-7,The measures were seen as among the most effective economic sanctions ever imposed and paved the way for a deal that curbed Tehran's nuclear activity.
Chevron,2017-7,Measures on financial transactions would give President Donald Trump's administration the power to escalate pressure on Venezuela by threatening punishment of any U.S. firm doing business with PDVSA or U.S. banks processing any of its transactions in dollars.

Chevron,2017-7,"The administration is also discussing a ban on U.S. oil imports from Venezuela, but no final decisions have been reached, the official said."
Chevron,2017-7,Sanctions on dollar transactions could be more punitive than an import ban because they would make it much more difficult for any refiner or trader to buy Venezuelan oil - not just customers in the United States.
Chevron,2017-7,"The impact of sanctions on PDVSA would ripple across oil markets, forcing refiners to buy alternative supplies. The U.S. could use crude from its Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) to blunt the impact of any short-term supply shortage, the policy adviser told Reuters."
Chevron,2017-7,"The United States bought 780,000 barrels per day (bpd) of Venezuelan crude and refined products in the first four months of 2017, according to the Energy Information Administration, nearly 8 percent of total imports.

Chevron,2017-7,{{20170722T003216.269+0000}}EXCLUSIVE-U.S. weighs financial sanctions to hit Venezuela's oil revenue - sourcesBy Marianna Parraga and Matt Spetalnick
Chevron,2017-7,"HOUSTON/WASHINGTON, July 21 (Reuters) - The United States is considering financial sanctions on Venezuela that would halt dollar payments for the country's oil, according to a senior White House official and an adviser with direct knowledge of the discussions."
Chevron,2017-7,The move could severely restrict the OPEC nation's crude exports and starve its socialist government of hard currency.
Chevron,2017-7,"Sanctions prohibiting any transaction in U.S. currency by Venezuela's state-run oil firm, PDVSA, are among the toughest of various oil-related measures under discussion at the White House, the two sources told Reuters."
Chevron,2017-7,The administration aims to pressure socialist President Nicolas Maduro into aborting plans for a controversial new congress that critics say would cement him as a dictator.
Chevron,2017-7,"Venezuela's oil-based economy is in the grip of a brutal recession and a local currency crash, and Maduro has faced months of anti-government unrest that has claimed the lives of about 100 people. Sanctions on dollar transactions would make it even harder for Maduro's government to secure cash for debt payments and finance imports of basic goods."
Chevron,2017-7,The White House declined to comment on the sanctions under consideration. PDVSA and Venezuela's Oil Ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Chevron,2017-7,The U.S. measures under discussion are similar to those that were imposed against Iran over its nuclear program - which halved Iran's oil exports and prevented top crude buyers from paying for Iranian oil.
Chevron,2017-7,The measures were seen as among the most effective economic sanctions ever imposed and paved the way for a deal that curbed Tehran's nuclear activity.

Chevron,2017-7,* Profits to drop on quarter after oil price recovery stalls
Chevron,2017-7,"LONDON, July 21 (Reuters) - After a brief respite at the start of the year, the world's top oil and gas companies are set to double down on cost cutting as a recovery in crude prices after a three-year slump falters."
Chevron,2017-7,"Corporate hopes were raised by a deal between members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other non-OPEC producers to cut production, which lifted oil prices above $58 a barrel in January, after they had slid to as low as $27 in 2016."
Chevron,2017-7,"But Brent crude prices have since slipped back below $50 and banks have lowered price forecasts, amid surging output from the United States and other nations not bound by the global oil pact."
Chevron,2017-7,"Investors are again focussing on the ability of top oil firms such as Exxon Mobil , Royal Dutch Shell and Total to live within their means and eke out profits when oil has failed to recover, as hoped, to $60."
Chevron,2017-7,"The majors, often dubbed Big Oil, have already been through tough spending cuts since a collapse in crude prices since mid-2014 from above $100. They have shed thousands of jobs, scrapped projects, sold assets and squeezed service costs."
Chevron,2017-7,"Net income for Exxon, Chevron , Shell, BP , Total, Eni and Statoil is set to double on average in the quarter ending June 30 from a year earlier, even though oil prices are back as similar levels, according to analyst estimates compiled by Reuters."
Chevron,2017-7,"By early 2017, management teams said their operations in 2017 would cover spending and dividend payouts at $60 a barrel, although for many firms this included using scrip programmes, when investors can opt for dividend payouts in shares not cash."
Chevron,2017-7,"But earlier savings may not now be enough, with Brent crude averaging below $50 in the second quarter and forecasts that the 2017 average will be $54. [O/POLL]"
Chevron,2017-7,"While net income for Q2 may climb year-on-year, the quarter-on-quarter picture is different. Compared to the first three months of the year, the second quarter will see net income fall by about 20 percent, according to analyst estimates."
Chevron,2017-7,"""Given where oil prices are, 2017 is still a year of transition for these companies, and that is not necessarily supportive for investment,"" said Jason Kenney, head of pan-European oil and gas equity research at Banco Santander."
Chevron,2017-7,"""The sector needs to continue doing more of the same,"" he said, referring to the ongoing need to reduce costs."
Chevron,2017-7,"Dividend yield, the ratio between a firm's dividend payout and share price, has risen in recent weeks to near recent highs as share prices have slipped, underscoring investor concerns."
Chevron,2017-7,"Shell, Statoil and Total kick off the Q2 earnings reports on Thursday, followed by Exxon and Chevron on Friday. BP reports on Aug. 1."
Chevron,2017-7,"Majors were targetting break even at $55 a barrel and could further cut spending by delaying investments, simplifying offshore and other project designs and selling assets, Kenney said."
Chevron,2017-7,"About two thirds of the industry's capital expenditure went to new projects, with the rest used to maintain existing output, Kenney added."
Chevron,2017-7,Company boards have taken different approaches to deal with the bumpy oil price recovery.
Chevron,2017-7,"Exxon and Chevron have invested in U.S. shale oil in recent months, seeking to benefit from the relatively low development cost and the short time it takes to extract commercial oil."
Chevron,2017-7,"Across the Atlantic, Shell, BP and Total have focussed more heavily on cutting costs of large, deepwater oil and gas projects to compete with the low-cost shale. [nL8N1JG4D4]"
Chevron,2017-7,"Analysts have rewarded some firms for their ongoing savings. Total holds 18 ""strong buy"" or ""buy"" recommendations, while Chevron has 17, among analysts polled by Reuters. Shell has 16."
Chevron,2017-7,"Exxon holds the lowest number of ""buy"" recommendations at 8. Its high share price to earnings (P/E) ratio and a weaker production growth outlook make it less attractive, HSBC said."
Chevron,2017-7,"Exxon shares are trading at a P/E ratio of 16.9, compared with Shell's 11.9 and BP's 10.3."
Chevron,2017-7,"""The fundamental environment is looking quite good because this is an environment where (companies) can cut costs and reduce headcount and they don't have to develop anything,"" said Jonathan Waghorn, co-manager of the energy fund at Guinness Asset Management, which holds shares in Shell, BP, Total and Chevron. ""They are off life support at $55 a barrel."""
Chevron,2017-7,UPDATE 3-Exxon sues U.S. over fine levied for Russia deal under Tillerson - Reuters News
Chevron,2017-7,"{{20170720T230108.805+0000}}UPDATE 3-Exxon sues U.S. over fine levied for Russia deal under Tillerson(Recasts, adds material from lawsuit)"
Chevron,2017-7,"WASHINGTON/HOUSTON, July 20 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp sued the U.S. government on Thursday, blasting as ""unlawful"" and ""capricious"" a $2 million fine levied against it for a three-year-old oil joint venture with Russia's Rosneft ."
Chevron,2017-7,"The U.S. Treasury Department on Thursday morning slapped the world's largest publicly traded oil producer with the fine for ""reckless disregard"" of U.S. sanctions in dealings with Russia in 2014 when Secretary of State Rex Tillerson was Exxon's chief executive."
Chevron,2017-7,"The lawsuit and the Treasury's unusually detailed statement on Exxon's conduct represented an extraordinary confrontation between a major American company and the U.S. government, made all the more striking because Exxon's former CEO is now in President Donald Trump's Cabinet."
Chevron,2017-7,"Exxon took the government to court despite the fact that the fine, the maximum allowed, would have a minor impact on the company, which made $7.84 billion in profit last year."
Chevron,2017-7,"The fine came after a U.S. review of deals Exxon signed with Rosneft, Russia's largest oil producer, weeks after Washington imposed sanctions on Moscow for annexing Ukraine's Crimea region."
Chevron,2017-7,"Between May 14 and May 23, 2014, top U.S.-based Exxon executives signed eight documents with Igor Sechin, the head of state-run Rosneft, the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) said in the statement on its website."
Chevron,2017-7,"The Treasury imposed sanctions on Sechin in April 2014 as part of measures to pressure Russia over its intervention in Ukraine, saying Sechin had shown ""utter loyalty"" to Russian President Vladimir Putin."
Chevron,2017-7,"The sanctions prohibit U.S. citizens or people in the United States from dealing with those on the blacklist, such as Sechin. Rosneft itself is subject to narrower U.S. sanctions that still allow Americans to deal with the company on some transactions."
Chevron,2017-7,"Exxon said in a statement that OFAC's action was ""fundamentally unfair,"" and sued the U.S. government in Texas in an effort to overturn the decision. The company is based in Irving, Texas."
Chevron,2017-7,"In its 21-page complaint, Exxon argued that Sechin ""was subject to sanctions only in his individual capacity"" and that guidance from the Obama administration at the time made clear that the sanctions ""applied only to the 'personal assets' of the sanctioned individuals and emphasized that the sanctions did not restrict business with the companies those individuals managed."""
Chevron,2017-7,"Tillerson left Exxon late last year to become secretary of state after 10 years running the company. He is now responsible for U.S. foreign policy, which includes helping make sanctions decisions."
Chevron,2017-7,The State Department referred questions about the fine to Exxon and the Treasury. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert told reporters on Thursday that the agency was alerted to the fine on Wednesday.
Chevron,2017-7,"A Treasury spokesman said OFAC engaged with Exxon's lawyers only, and ""did not discuss this case with Secretary Tillerson."""
Chevron,2017-7,"Tillerson said in January that he would recuse himself from matters involving Exxon for one year after his December 2016 resignation, unless he is authorized to participate."
Chevron,2017-7,"Though the State Department plays a major part in formulating sanctions policy, former U.S. officials and sanctions experts said it was unlikely the agency had a role in deciding the fine announced on Thursday, because it falls under OFAC's regulatory role."
Chevron,2017-7,"The back-and-forth between the Treasury and Exxon over the 2014 dealings spanned both the Obama and Trump administrations, and started with a subpoena from OFAC to Exxon in July 2014, Exxon said in its complaint."
Chevron,2017-7,"Exxon fully complied with guidance from Democratic former President Barack Obama's administration that ongoing oil and gas business activities with Rosneft were permitted, Exxon spokesman Alan Jeffers said in a statement."
Chevron,2017-7,"The Treasury ""is trying to retroactively enforce a new interpretation of an executive order"" inconsistent with its prior guidance, Jeffers said. ""OFAC's action is fundamentally unfair."""
Chevron,2017-7,Exxon also cited a Treasury Department representative's comments in May 2014 that BP Plc Chief Executive Bob Dudley - an American citizen - could continue to participate in Rosneft board meetings so long as they related only to Rosneft's business.
Chevron,2017-7,"In its statement explaining the fine, OFAC said that the Treasury Department representative's comments did not address Exxon's conduct. BP did not immediately respond to a request for comment."
Chevron,2017-7,"Publicly available guidance on the Treasury's website at the time of Exxon's dealings with Sechin said Americans should ensure they do not enter into contracts signed by sanctioned individuals, OFAC said."
Chevron,2017-7,"And by dealing with Sechin, the company ""caused significant harm"" to U.S. sanctions on Russia, the agency said."
Chevron,2017-7,"Because Rosneft itself is not off-limits to Americans, another company executive could have signed the contract with no sanctions risk to Exxon, said David Mortlock, who was a State Department and White House sanctions official under Obama."

Chevron,2017-7,July 20 (Reuters) - Woodside Petroleum reported a 6.8 percent fall in oil and gas output in the June quarter due to planned and unplanned outages and a previously flagged reduction in its share of pipeline gas from the North West Shelf.
Chevron,2017-7,Australia's biggest independent oil and gas producer said production fell to 20.7 million barrels of oil equivalent (mmboe) in the second quarter from 22.2 mmboe in the same quarter last year.
Chevron,2017-7,"Second-quarter revenue rose to $867 million from $825 million a year earlier, but missed a forecast of $976 million from Royal Bank of Canada. Quarterly sales volumes fell 3.8 percent to 20.3 mmboe."
Chevron,2017-7,"The final commissioning of the Wheatstone LNG Train 1, Woodside's main source of short-term growth, is well advanced and nearing completion, it said. Operator Chevron Corp has said it is due to start producing in the middle of this year."
Chevron,2017-7,"Woodside bought a stake in the $34 billion Wheatstone project in 2015, and it is set to contribute more than 13 mmboe to Woodside's annual output when complete. [nL4N1F85QX]"

Chevron,2017-7,"{{20170714T182206.808+0000}}Behind the scenes, companies fight Trump on US steel tariffsBy Ginger Gibson"
Chevron,2017-7,"WASHINGTON, July 14 (Reuters) - American manufacturers, energy companies and retailers reliant on cheap steel are quietly lobbying against President Donald Trump's desire to impose tariffs on steel imports ahead of possible decision by the U.S. Commerce Department next week."
Chevron,2017-7,"Honoring a promise made in the 2016 election campaign, in April this year Trump initiated a ""Section 232"" review of the steel industry, a provision in the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 allowing for the imposition of tariffs or quotas on imports if they threaten national security. The provision has only been used to review imports twice before."
Chevron,2017-7,"The Commerce Department could issue findings on the matter as early as next week, a decision that three lobbyists say has been delayed due to debate inside the administration."
Chevron,2017-7,"Steel producers in the U.S., like U.S. Steel Corp and AK Steel stand to benefit from protectionist tariffs which would enable them to raise their prices."
Chevron,2017-7,"But U.S. manufacturers and energy companies who use steel want to keep their costs down and say tariffs could costs jobs in their industries, while retailers need cheap steel for many facets of their business including shelving in their stores and warehouses, and to sell to consumers."
Chevron,2017-7,Any U.S. tariffs may also result in damage to unrelated industries if other countries retaliate by also imposing tariffs on American exports in sectors such as agriculture.
Chevron,2017-7,"""Our member companies have quietly had these conversations with both members of the administration but also with the Hill,"" said Hun Quach, the vice president for international trade at the Retail Industry Leaders Association."
Chevron,2017-7,"Those in favor of approving new tariffs include not only steel manufacturers, but some aligned unions. They have allies in Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, a former U.S. Steel lawyer who has promised to recuse himself from decisions regarding the industry."
Chevron,2017-7,"Mario Longhi, who until a few weeks ago was chief executive of U.S. Steel, said earlier this year that curbing cheap steel imports could restore jobs for 10,000 American steel workers."
Chevron,2017-7,"The U.S. steel industry employed about 147,000 people in 2015, according to the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic analysis."
Chevron,2017-7,"But manufacturers that need steel employ about 6.5 million people each year, and the construction industry supports another 6.3 million jobs."
Chevron,2017-7,"Manufacturers argue that pushing up the cost of steel by imposing tariffs on imports ultimately hurts American consumers who will pay more for everyday goods made from steel, such as lawn mowers, washing machines, and microwaves."
Chevron,2017-7,"When former President George W. Bush imposed steel tariffs in 2002, the move was found illegal by the World Trade Organization which permitted other countries to retaliate against American exports and Bush was forced to back down."
Chevron,2017-7,"Studies by the free trade lobby group, the Consuming Industries Trade Action Coalition (CITAC), found that 200,000 workers in U.S. manufacturing lost their jobs as a result of the 2002 steel tariffs."
Chevron,2017-7,"Pushing back against something that was a signature piece of Trump's campaign carries some political risk though and most companies would only elaborate on their lobbying efforts anonymously, saying they were making their case to Trump and lawmakers behind closed doors."
Chevron,2017-7,"They see allies in Gary Cohn, the head of the National Economic Council and Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue."
Chevron,2017-7,"""We've been quite vocal both on the Hill and in the administration,"" said a lobbyist for a large manufacturing company that uses both U.S. steel and imported steel, but who declined to speak on the record over concerns public statements could damage relationships with the White House."
Chevron,2017-7,"Several companies have also been pressing members of Congress to advocate against tariffs with the administration on their behalf, said several lobbyists."
Chevron,2017-7,"Several companies, including National Oilwell Varco Inc. , Ball Corporation , and Electrolux , submitted public comments to the Commerce Department arguing against tariffs."
Chevron,2017-7,"The American Petroleum Industry, which represents the largest oil refiners and chemical companies including ExxonMobil , Shell Oil Company , Chevron and Dow Chemical Company , issued forceful comments against the proposed tariffs, as did the American Automotive Policy Council, which includes Ford Motor Co. and General Motors ."
Chevron,2017-7,"""The auto industry and the U.S. workers that the industry employs would be adversely affected and that this unintended negative impact would exceed the benefit provided to the steel industry,"" the American Automotive Policy Council said in a message echoed in other comments."

Chevron,2017-7,"S&P currently has downgrade warnings - or negative outlooks in rating agency parlance - on ExxonMobil , Chevron Corp and Total , while the other so-called 'majors' include Royal Dutch Shell and BP ."
Chevron,2017-7,"""If oil prices persistently trend below our price assumptions ($50/bbl on average until the end of 2018), downgrade pressure for many ratings would increase without material and sufficient further cost and capex efficiencies, disposals, or other countermeasures against weak credit metrics for a sustained period,"" S&P said in a report."
Chevron,2017-7,"It added that moderately higher oil prices would help credit metrics, but that for most of the big firms -with the exception of Shell- it ""remains to be seen"" whether they could see upgrades without a strong and sustained rebound in crude prices."

Chevron,2017-7,"* Qatar is world's top LNG exporter, but competition is rising"
Chevron,2017-7,"* Producers fight over Asian market, which consumes 70 pct of LNG"
Chevron,2017-7,"SINGAPORE, July 5 (Reuters) - Qatar's plan to boost liquefied natural gas (LNG) output by 30 percent is the opening shot in a price war for customers in Asia pitting the Gulf state against competitors from the United States, Russia and Australia."
Chevron,2017-7,"Qatar, facing regional isolation in a diplomatic dispute with its Gulf neighbours, took energy markets by surprise on Tuesday when it said it would raise its LNG production to 100 million tonnes per year - equivalent to a third of current global supplies - within the next five to seven years."
Chevron,2017-7,"It suggests the wealthy kingdom is preparing for a lengthy battle with Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, who were due to meet on Wednesday to decide whether to continue sanctions they imposed on Qatar over accusations it was aiding terrorism and courting regional rival Iran. [nL8N1JV4H2]"
Chevron,2017-7,Qatar's move will add gas to an already oversupplied market in a thinly disguised challenge to other exporters who are also raising their output.
Chevron,2017-7,"With low production costs and infrastructure already in place, Qatar is well placed to come out on top, analysts say. Flooding the market with more LNG will help defend its place as the world's top exporter, a position challenged by Australia."
Chevron,2017-7,"""Qatar is losing market share, so it could be about becoming number one again in LNG,"" said Neil Beveridge, senior oil and gas analyst at research and brokerage firm Sanford C. Bernstein."
Chevron,2017-7,LNG is super-cooled natural gas that is transported on tankers around the world.
Chevron,2017-7,"Long a niche product, it has become an industry darling as natural gas is a cleaner fossil fuel than oil or coal and is also versatile, with potential uses ranging from power generation to heating and as a transport fuel."
Chevron,2017-7,"U.S. and European oil majors such as Royal Dutch Shell and Chevron have invested huge sums over the last decade - often more than they have spent on oil - in an attempt to dominate the LNG market, especially through mega-projects in Australia such as Chevron's Gorgon or Shell's Prelude. [nL4N1D00MR]"
Chevron,2017-7,"The main battleground for LNG market share is Asia, which consumes 70 percent of the fuel and where it is seen as a key fuel to meet soaring energy demand without the rampant pollution that comes with coal."
Chevron,2017-7,"The world's biggest LNG buyers are utilities, especially from Japan and South Korea. Sources at these utilities said they were surprised by Qatar's move."
Chevron,2017-7,"""We would have to figure out why Qatar is planning to boost its output.. We don't have plans yet to import new LNG cargoes from Qatar,"" said Kim Young-ki, a spokesman at Korea Gas Corp. (KOGAS), one of the world's biggest single LNG buyers."
Chevron,2017-7,Qatar's announcement came just a day after Iran signed its first deal with France's Total and China's state-owned oil company CNPC to produce gas from a field it shares with Qatar. [nL8N1JU2W4]
Chevron,2017-7,"Beveridge, at Sanford C. Bernstein, said Qatar's move to raise output ""could be a response to Total restarting development work"" on Iran's side of the gas reserves."
Chevron,2017-7,"Trying to cement its own market share, Russia's Gazprom the world's biggest single producer of natural gas, said late on Tuesday that it would start pumping gas to China through a new pipeline by late 2019, earlier than many expected. [nL8N1JW045]"
Chevron,2017-7,"China is already the top consumer of most commodities, including oil and coal, and as part of a huge investment programme to expand its LNG and pipeline infrastructure it is also on its way to become a top natural gas user."
Chevron,2017-7,"Australia has invested hundreds of billions of dollars in a bid to overtake Qatar as the world's top LNG exporter by 2019, a challenge Qatar is now rising to."
Chevron,2017-7,"Qatar, whose state-owned Qatar Petroleum has partnered with U.S. oil giant Exxon Mobil to produce its LNG, has a strong interest in defending its position."
Chevron,2017-7,"LNG, as well as exports of condensate, a super-light form of crude oil that's a byproduct of gas extraction, have made Qatar rich despite a 70 percent fall in LNG prices and a more than 50 percent drop in oil prices since 2014."
Chevron,2017-7,"Ramping up LNG exports to 100 million tonnes a year would, at current prices, reap revenues of around $30 billion, with another $6 billion coming from condensate."
Chevron,2017-7,"That equates to $120,000 per person, helping Qatar to become the world's richest nation, according to the World Bank."
Chevron,2017-7,"The main producers challenged by Qatar's move are those who have yet to attract a final investment decision, especially in the United States."
Chevron,2017-7,"So far only Cheniere exports U.S. LNG, but there are proposals with a total capacity of 150 million tonnes per year."
Chevron,2017-7,"Chong Zhi Xin, at energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie, said Qatar's low cost LNG expansion ""is pushing a lot of new projects out of the market""."
Chevron,2017-7,The winners in this aggressive fight for market share are consumers.
Chevron,2017-7,"""Expansion of LNG capacity translates to lower for longer LNG prices,"" said Kerry Anne Shanks, head of Asia gas and LNG research at Wood Mackenzie. ""That's good news for gas buyers."""
Chevron,2017-7,"{{20170703T162004.708+0000}}EXCLUSIVE-Mexico's Pemex sees October selection of refinery coking plant partner -sources (Adds details of selection process, background and names of banks, paragraphs 3-15)"
Chevron,2017-7,"MEXICO CITY, July 3 (Reuters) - Mexican state oil company Pemex plans to choose a partner at the end of October to finish the development and operate a $2 billion coking plant at its Tula refinery, government and Pemex sources told Reuters."
Chevron,2017-7,"Pemex is looking for partners to improve the performance of its state-owned refineries, which currently process about 915,000 bpd of crude, well below their combined capacity of 1.6 million bpd."
Chevron,2017-7,"Pemex had previously planned to select a partner before June but the process has fallen behind schedule ""because of the complexity and the investment needed,"" said a separate industry source with direct knowledge of the project."
Chevron,2017-7,"Since May, Pemex has invited 56 companies to bid but will not launch a tender as planned, a Pemex source said, calling the process ""open, competitive and transparent."""
Chevron,2017-7,Two years of sagging oil prices and mounting debt have forced the Mexican oil firm to seek equity partners to help fund key projects.
Chevron,2017-7,"Asked about the partnership plan, a Pemex spokesman said the details provided by sources were correct."
Chevron,2017-7,"Japan's Mitsui & Co. <8031.T>, Korea's SK Group, Italy's Eni , China's PetroChina <601857.SS> and Sinopec <0386.HK>, British-Dutch Royal Dutch Shell Plc and U.S. oil major Chevron are among the companies interested in the project, sources told Reuters in April."
Chevron,2017-7,"Pemex has hired Bank of America Merrill Lynch to help in the search for a partner, the Pemex source said."
Chevron,2017-7,"Tula, like two other Pemex refineries, lacks coking capacity, which boosts production of higher-value fuels like gasoline from Mexico's increasingly heavy crude production."
Chevron,2017-7,"Interested companies are being asked to present their proposals by the third week of August and Pemex will draw up a shortlist by September, two Pemex sources said."
Chevron,2017-7,"The final selection ""will take place in the last week of October,"" the first Pemex source said."
Chevron,2017-7,"Tula is Pemex's second largest refinery, with a capacity to process 315,000 barrels per day (bpd) but in May processed 228,126 bpd, company data showed."
Chevron,2017-7,"The new plant will be located adjacent to Pemex's existing Tula refinery, in the central state of Hidalgo."
Chevron,2017-7,"In 2015, Pemex said it signed a contract with ICA Fluor for engineering, procurement and construction for an initial phase of projects to boost gasoline and diesel output and reduce fuel oil output by building a coking plant. Reuters was not able to confirm the status of the project with ICA Fluor, a joint venture between construction firm ICA and Fluor Corp."
Chevron,2017-7,"In 2016, the state-owned oil company presented a business plan that included the ""Tolling coker Tula Alliance"" project, as well as partnerships to improve operations and/or reconfigure the Tula, Salamanca and Salina Cruz refineries."
Chevron,2017-7,"{{20170701T032855.821+0000}}UPDATE 3-U.S. warns businesses of hacking campaign against nuclear, energy firms(Adds comments from nuclear power generators)"
Chevron,2017-7,"TORONTO, June 30 (Reuters) - The U.S government warned industrial firms this week about a hacking campaign targeting the nuclear and energy sectors, the latest event to highlight the power industry's vulnerability to cyber attacks."
Chevron,2017-7,"Since at least May, hackers used tainted ""phishing"" emails to ""harvest credentials"" so they could gain access to networks of their targets, according to a joint report from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and Federal Bureau of Investigation."
Chevron,2017-7,"The report provided to the industrial firms was reviewed by Reuters on Friday. While disclosing attacks, and warning that in some cases hackers succeeded in compromising the networks of their targets, it did not identify any specific victims."
Chevron,2017-7,"""Historically, cyber actors have strategically targeted the energy sector with various goals ranging from cyber espionage to the ability to disrupt energy systems in the event of a hostile conflict,"" the report said."
Chevron,2017-7,"Homeland Security and FBI officials could not be reached for comment on the report, which was dated June 28."
Chevron,2017-7,The report was released during a week of heavy hacking activity.
Chevron,2017-7,"A virus dubbed ""NotPetya"" attacked on Tuesday, spreading from initial infections in Ukraine to businesses around the globe. It encrypted data on infected machines, rendering them inoperable and disrupting activity at ports, law firms and factories. [L8N1JP55N]"
Chevron,2017-7,On Tuesday the energy-industry news site E&E News reported that U.S. investigators were looking into cyber intrusions this year at multiple nuclear power generators.
Chevron,2017-7,"Reuters has not confirmed details of the E&E News report, which said there was no evidence safety systems had been compromised at affected plants."
Chevron,2017-7,The activity described in the U.S. government report comes at a time when industrial firms are particularly anxious about threat that hackers pose to their operations.
Chevron,2017-7,"Industrial firms, including power providers and other utilities, have been particularly worried about the potential for destructive cyber attacks since December 2016, when hackers cut electricity in Ukraine."
Chevron,2017-7,"U.S. nuclear power generators PSEG , SCANA Corp and Entergy Corp said they were not impacted by the recent cyber attacks. SCANA's V.C. Summer nuclear plant in South Carolina shut down on Thursday due to a problem with a valve in the non-nuclear portion of the plant, a spokesman said."
Chevron,2017-7,"Another nuclear power generator, Dominion Energy , said it does not comment on cyber security."
Chevron,2017-7,"Two cyber security firms said on June 12 that they had identified the malicious software used in the Ukraine attack, which they dubbed Industroyer, warning that it could be easily modified to attack utilities in the United States and Europe. [L1N1J90J8]"
Chevron,2017-7,Industroyer is only the second piece of malware uncovered to date that is capable of disrupting industrial processes without the need for hackers to manually intervene.
Chevron,2017-7,"The first, Stuxnet, was discovered in 2010 and is widely believed by security researchers to have been used by the United States and Israel to attack Iran's nuclear program."
Chevron,2017-7,"The U.S. government report said attackers conducted reconnaissance to gain information about the individuals whose computers they sought to infect so that they create ""decoy documents"" on topics of interest to their targets."
Chevron,2017-7,"In an analysis, it described 11 files used in the attacks, including malware downloaders and tools that allow the hackers to take remote control of victim's computers and travel across their networks."
Chevron,2017-7,"Chevron Corp , Exxon Mobil Corp and ConocoPhillips , the three largest U.S. oil producers, declined to comment on their network security."
