Exxon,2017-12,Dec 28 (Reuters) - The following are the top stories from selected Canadian newspapers. Reuters has not verified these stories and does not vouch for their accuracy.
Exxon,2017-12,"{{20171228T111351.000+0000}}With new gas deals, Egypt closes in on energy hub goalCAIRO, Dec 28 (Reuters)"
Exxon,2017-12,"CAIRO, Dec 28 (Reuters) - Egypt is set to inaugurate a new wharf for natural gas and petroleum product tankers on the Gulf of Suez in the coming days, another step in its plan to become a regional energy hub."
Exxon,2017-12,"The new 2.5 km wharf is being built by SUMED, which for decades has operated two pipelines from the Red Sea to the Mediterranean."
Exxon,2017-12,"The wharf will have three berths to receive natural gas and petroleum products carriers. It is due to be completed by the end of the month, Al-Masry Al-Youm newspaper quoted SUMED chairman Mohamed Abdel-Hafez as saying. Abdel-Hafez confirmed the remarks in a text message to Reuters."
Exxon,2017-12,The country has been building fuelling depots for ships along the Suez Canal and expanding its refining capacity. It has an extensive pipeline network and two idle gas liquefaction plants ready to export new gas as it arrives.
Exxon,2017-12,"SUMED, owned 50 percent by the Egyptian government and the rest by Arab oil exporters in the Gulf, is spending $415 million to expand its facilities, mainly at the Red Sea end."
Exxon,2017-12,"It is also building nine 300,000 cubic metre petroleum storage tanks and loading and offloading facilities. The tanks are due to be completed by the end of 2018, Abdel-Hafez said."
Exxon,2017-12,"NBK-Egypt provided $300 million in financing for the project, the bank said in May."
Exxon,2017-12,The country believes its strategic location straddling the Suez Canal and the land bridge between Asia and Africa and its well developed infrastructure will help turn it a trading and distribution centre for countries in the region and beyond.
Exxon,2017-12,A slew of announcements of new gas production and the expansion of its infrastructure have helped advance the plan.
Exxon,2017-12,"Italy's Eni this month delivered the first gas from Egypt's giant offshore Zohr field, whose estimated 30 trillion cubic feet (tfc) makes it the biggest gas field in the Mediterranean, and BP delivered the first gas from another offshore field, Atoll, north of Port Said."
Exxon,2017-12,"Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi's government has announced the hub approach part of its energy policy, but still faces logistical and political obstacles to its goal."
Exxon,2017-12,"""By the beginning of 2021, Egypt will be a main regional hub for gas and crude oil,"" Petroleum Minister Tarek El Molla told a press conference last month."
Exxon,2017-12,"Energy analysts say the cheapest way for Egypt's neighbours to send their gas supplies abroad would be through Egypt's two unused liquefaction plants, but this is complicated by legal and logistical problems or by financial constraints."
Exxon,2017-12,"""The lack of a political framework between all these countries is still an obstacle,"" said Riccardo Fabiani, a Middle East and North Africa analyst at Eurasia Group."
Exxon,2017-12,"Sisi on Nov. 20 also visited Cyprus, where he discussed construction of a pipeline to deliver gas to Egypt from Cyprus's Aphrodite field, and a delegation representing Israel's Tamar gas field came to Cairo to discuss possible imports into Egypt."
Exxon,2017-12,Officials from Exxon Mobil have also recently held talks with Egypt to discuss investments in oil and gas.
Exxon,2017-12,One plan now is to reverse the flow on the pipeline to send gas from Israel's 7 trillion cubic feet Tamar field and the roughly 20 tcf Leviathan field to Egyptian liquefaction plants.
Exxon,2017-12,But this has been stymied by a dispute over gas that Egypt failed to deliver after 2012. The late-November visit to Cairo by Tamar field negotiators was their second in as many months.
Exxon,2017-12,"The Israelis may prefer to build a new undersea pipeline that would bypass Sinai to avoid sabotage or use a separate pipeline that Egypt has built to Jordan, Syria and Lebanon, analysts said."
Exxon,2017-12,"The challenge with Cyprus's 4.5 tcf Aphrodite field is mainly economic. At current gas prices, it is not big enough to justify an undersea pipeline to Egypt unless more discoveries are made elsewhere in Cyprus, analysts say."
Exxon,2017-12,"Alternative routes for Egypt's neighbours, such as direct pipelines to Turkey, Greece or Italy, could be prohibitively expensive because of the depth of the seabed."
Exxon,2017-12,"""Egypt is the least bad candidate. And it is also going very fast, which gives it a head start,"" Fabiani said."

Exxon,2017-12,"OSLO, Dec 22 (Reuters) - The Norwegian Supreme Court will hear an appeal from the owners of Gassled, Norway's gas infrastructure network, in a case involving the government's decision to cut pipeline tariffs, Njord Gas Infrastructure said on Friday."
Exxon,2017-12,"In June 2017, a Norwegian appeals court ruled against the owners in a lawsuit that argued the cut in tariffs was unlawful and would cost them a combined 15 billion Norwegian crowns ($1.80 billion) in lost earnings through 2028. [nL5N1LU4M4]"

Exxon,2017-12,(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are her own.)
Exxon,2017-12,"Expensive, longer-term projects will be constrained as a result, while U.S. shale, among the fastest and least costly sources of oil in the world, will fill in the gap. In 2017, U.S. tight oil, as shale is also known, solidified its place as the market's swing producer even as OPEC, the oil world's dominant cartel, cut production. The International Energy Agency says that though the number of active U.S. rigs fell in 2017, output will continue to rise in 2018."
Exxon,2017-12,"Unless new discoveries or technologies upend the energy sector, shale's influence will grow. The IEA says U.S. shale output in the 15 years to 2025 will match the highest sustained period of oil output growth by any single country in the history of the oil markets. By then the United States will be the largest liquefied natural gas exporter and, shortly after, a net exporter of oil. Shale has the power to keep oil prices subdued for a long time yet."
Exxon,2017-12,"- On Nov. 30, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and non-OPEC producers led by Russia agreed to extend oil output cuts until the end of 2018. The cartel also decided to cap the combined output of Nigeria and Libya at 2017 levels of less than 2.8 million barrels a day. Both countries had previously been exempt from production restraints."
Exxon,2017-12,"- By October, commercial inventories in member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development had fallen to a level 140 million barrels above the five-year moving average, draining more than half the previous glut, according to OPEC."

Exxon,2017-12,(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are her own.)
Exxon,2017-12,"DALLAS, Dec 21 (Reuters Breakingviews) - The oil industry is infamous for governance spills, but shareholders are now trying to cap them. Carl Icahn has drummed up investor support against SandRidge Energy's adopting a poison pill after criticism of its $746 million offer for Bonanza Creek. Hess faces another fight with an activist. And Exxon Mobil is only slowly responding to owners' concerns."
Exxon,2017-12,"For decades the industry has been racked by scandals, from the dodgy accounting that took down Enron to the bid rigging that undid Aubrey McClendon, founder of Chesapeake Energy . Plenty of other issues remain."
Exxon,2017-12,It's not as if shareholders have outrageous demands. Compensation structures are one bugbear: these have long rewarded executives for simply increasing assets rather than growing them profitably. Natural-gas producer EQT bowed to this pressure recently.
Exxon,2017-12,"Trouble is, such pressure may at best only bring energy companies' corporate governance up to speed with current basic practice. In effect, that means many in the sector are fighting past battles rather than ensuring their governance is prepared to tackle the uncertain future climate change will bring."
Exxon,2017-12,- On Dec. 20 Guggenheim Partners Investment Management said in a statement that it intends to vote its 12 percent stake in SandRidge Energy against the proposed acquisition of Bonanza Creek Energy.
Exxon,2017-12,- Last month activist investor Carl Icahn disclosed that his funds own more than 13 percent of the company's shares and said he opposed SandRidge's transaction.
Exxon,2017-12,"- SandRidge then adopted a poison pill that would be triggered if the company's shareholders were deemed to be ""acting in concert,"" a measure which Icahn said precluded the shareholders from discussing opposition to the transaction."
Exxon,2017-12,"- On Dec. 14 Elliott Management said it was readying a new fight with oil company Hess because of the company's poor performance. Elliott won an activist campaign against Hess in 2013 allowing it to put three people on the company's board, two of whom still serve as directors. John Hess, son of the founder, is the chief executive of the company and is the top shareholder with 11 percent of the company's shares."

Exxon,2017-12,"WINNIPEG, Manitoba, Dec 20 (Reuters) - Canada's offshore oil industry, a sliver of the country's crude sector, is drawing rising investment interest due to an aggressive push by Newfoundland and Labrador as prices plummet in oil-rich Alberta due to pipeline problems."
Exxon,2017-12,"Offshore interest in the Atlantic province stands in contrast to Western Canada's oil fields, where foreign companies have sold some $23 billion worth of assets this year due to depressed prices."
Exxon,2017-12,"ExxonMobil's Hebron off Newfoundland, Canada's easternmost province, became the country's first new producing offshore oil project in 12 years last month. [nL1N1NY195]"
Exxon,2017-12,"Newfoundland's offshore petroleum board has also issued exploration licences worth nearly C$2 billion ($1.6 billion) in promised spending since 2015, its biggest-ever three-year total."
Exxon,2017-12,"The next round, to be held in autumn, has attracted a record-large 38 nominations for parcels to be made available for exploration in a single region."
Exxon,2017-12,Winning a bid entitles a company to explore the parcel for six years.
Exxon,2017-12,"Offshore interest comes as western Canadian pipeline and rail capacity fills up, driving prices to four-year lows. [nL1N1OF2GB] The volume of crude in storage has hit record levels in western Canada driven by increased supply and a leak on TransCanada Corp's Keystone export pipeline last month."
Exxon,2017-12,Oil flowing from offshore Newfoundland by contrast is priced similar to Brent crude at a rich premium over western Canadian oil.
Exxon,2017-12,"The investment spilling into Canada's icy waters is at least partly due to an aggressive promotional push by Newfoundland's energy corporation, Nalcor, and frustration with western transportation problems, said Paul Barnes, a Newfoundland-based director with Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers."
Exxon,2017-12,"Oil companies ""are likely taking some of that money that may have been earmarked for Alberta and putting it into offshore,"" Barnes said."
Exxon,2017-12,"ExxonMobil is a ""long-term investor"" in Newfoundland, and also pursuing a potential exploration drilling project, spokeswoman Margot Bruce-O'Connell said."
Exxon,2017-12,"Jim Keating, Nalcor's vice president of oil and gas, said he does not see a link between Alberta's pipeline problems and Newfoundland's appeal."
Exxon,2017-12,"Companies that have recently invested offshore, such as BP PLC and Anadarko Petroleum Corp , are different than those most active in the oil sands, he said."
Exxon,2017-12,"To be sure, Eastern Canada produced 213,000 barrels per day in 2016, the amount Western Canada pumps every 90 minutes. But further offshore capacity is already in the works. Husky Energy is expanding its Newfoundland project and expects first oil in 2022."
Exxon,2017-12,"Wood Mackenzie analyst Nathan Nemeth said he does not link offshore interest with Alberta's bottlenecks, noting that Canadian Natural Resources and Suncor Energy have increased oil sands investments while reducing offshore exploration."
Exxon,2017-12,"Newfoundland's appeal includes its relatively shallow water depths, a string of successful exploration wells, and a prospective basin size equivalent to the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, said Mark Oberstoetter, Wood Mackenzie's director of upstream Canada."
Exxon,2017-12,"""Being on tidewater is a huge advantage,"" said Andrew Bell, chairman of Newfoundland and Labrador Oil & Gas Industries Association."
Exxon,2017-12,"Norway's Statoil ASA said in December 2016 that it would sell all of its oil sands assets, even as it works on its Bay du Nord offshore discovery and holds stakes in three producing offshore fields, but there is no connection between the two strategies, spokesman Erik Haaland said.

Exxon,2017-12,"HOUSTON, Dec 20 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp said on Wednesday its board had ended a prohibition on outside directors meeting with shareholders, halting a long-standing policy that rankled big investors and led some to vote against key directors."
Exxon,2017-12,"The decision, which came days after Exxon's board acceded to shareholder calls for an annual review of climate-related risks to its business, reflects a less confrontational tone toward shareholder pressures under Chief Executive Darren Woods. [nL3N1OB5IB]"
Exxon,2017-12,"Exxon, the largest U.S. oil company, said in a statement that its board made the change to allow members to ""engage directly"" with key shareholders and ""to address areas of interest."" In the past, it funneled shareholder communications with its board through a company-run website."
Exxon,2017-12,"John Roe, a managing director and head of analytics at proxy advisor Institutional Shareholder Services, said Exxon was belatedly recognizing that big shareholders were more willing to back activist resolutions since the 2008 financial crisis. He called acceptance of shareholder-director meetings ""quite a normal practice"" at many companies."
Exxon,2017-12,Exxon's board has been under pressure for years from investors unhappy with a policy that effectively barred independent directors from speaking directly with shareholders.
Exxon,2017-12,"Top asset manager BlackRock Inc earlier this year said it voted against two directors at Exxon's annual meeting on May 31, ""In line with our expectations that the lead independent director should be available to shareholders."" A BlackRock spokesman did not immediately reply to a message on Wednesday."
Exxon,2017-12,"A group of investors recently said they were considering a resolution to challenge the policy at Exxon's 2018 shareholder meeting. In a Dec. 5 letter to Exxon's board, Illinois State Treasurer Michael Frerichs and other shareholder representatives had urged an end to the practice of barring direct board interactions with shareholders."
Exxon,2017-12,"On Wednesday, Frerichs called the decision ""a positive step for investors and the environment,"" and called for additional governance changes."
Exxon,2017-12,"""The next step is to revise the director-nominating process, director compensation, and executive pay to ensure that ExxonMobil is well-positioned to address climate-related risks and capitalize on fresh, innovative ideas,"" he said."
Exxon,2017-12,"NEW YORK, Dec 20 (Reuters) - Midstream company Zenith Energy US Logistics Holdings has pulled a US$450m leveraged loan from syndication as investors were reluctant to jump into a credit exposed to unresolved contingencies from an arbitration case and an expiring contract that could adversely impact cash flow, according to three sources familiar with the matter."
Exxon,2017-12,"Barclays, Credit Suisse and HSBC are providing committed financing for the deal, which marks the borrower's debut in the leveraged loan market and includes a US$410m seven-year first-lien loan with a US$40m delayed-draw tranche, accompanied by a US$50m five-year revolving credit facility."
Exxon,2017-12,The delayed-draw loan will ultimately be used to buy out the lease on the company's Portland crude oil terminal in 2018.
Exxon,2017-12,"Zenith's debt-to-Ebitda, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, at closing will be 5.5 times, based on US$410m of funded debt and US$74m of pro forma estimated 2017, according to two additional sources familiar with the matter."
Exxon,2017-12,"""The company has a lot of leverage and it's a complex story with a lot of moving pieces, which makes it difficult to do due diligence,"" an investor said."
Exxon,2017-12,"The arrangers will be on the hook to fund the debt if it is not removed from their balance sheets by the time of the deal's closing, which is expected by December 21, according to an October 30 Arc Logistics filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The merger was approved by Arc Logistics shareholders on December 18, according to a company press release."
Exxon,2017-12,"Barclays plans to relaunch the deal in the New Year, one of the sources said."
Exxon,2017-12,Barclays declined to comment. The company and Warburg Pincus did not respond to inquiries.
Exxon,2017-12,"Gulf LNG is currently in arbitration with Italian oil and gas company Eni's US subsidiary, Eni USA. Eni USA is seeking to unwind its contract with the facility, as it is currently idle given unattractive economics of importing liquid natural gas. While the arbitration hearing was held in January 2017, the ruling has been extended to the end of February 2018. Gulf LNG will represent roughly 25% of projected 2017 Ebitda, the two additional sources said."
Exxon,2017-12,"Given the unpredictability of the arbitration, Warburg Pincus plans to inject up to US$100m of additional equity to limit an increase in leverage, and drop in cash flow, that could result from a negative ruling."
Exxon,2017-12,"Zenith also faces the expiration of its Joliet contract with Exxon in May 2018. While the company expects the contract to be renewed, any unfavorable revisions could present a burden since the majority of the terminal's revenue comes from the contract and the terminal accounts for about 25% of Zenith's Ebitda, according to a December 5 Standard & Poor's report."
Exxon,2017-12,"The term loan was guided in the 525bp-550bp over Libor range, with a 25bp stepdown upon successful completion of the Gulf LNG litigation, subject to a 1% floor. Investors were offered the loan at a 99 discount with six months of soft call protection at 101."
Exxon,2017-12,Moody's and Standard & Poor's rate the company and the loan B2/B+.

Exxon,2017-12,Exxon spokeswoman Charlotte Huffaker declined to comment on the status of units at the refinery.
Exxon,2017-12,"The 65,000 bpd hydrocracker is expected to restart before the 110,000 bpd CDU, the sources said."
Exxon,2017-12,"On Dec. 4, the sources told Reuters the CDU, which is the smaller of two at the refinery, may be shut until late January for repairs from a Nov. 28 fire. [L1N1O41BF]"
Exxon,2017-12,The sources said on Monday the repairs may take until late January to complete. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to speak publicly about the refinery.
Exxon,2017-12,Huffaker said Exxon's investigation determined the opening of a valve set off the blaze on Nov. 28.
Exxon,2017-12,"""The investigation determined that the incident occurred by the opening of a valve that allowed a release of hydrocarbon to the atmosphere,"" she said. ""The hydrocarbon subsequently ignited, which resulted in a fire."""
Exxon,2017-12,"The hydrocracker, which produces diesel, a lucrative export for U.S. Gulf Coast refiners, was shut by a malfunction on Dec. 9. The Beaumont refinery has only one hydrocracker."

Exxon,2017-12,"Dec 18 (Reuters) - ExxonMobil Corp and BHP Billiton Ltd have agreed to end a nearly 50-year-old gas marketing joint venture in Australia, bowing to pressure from the nation's competition watchdog amid concerns about gas supply and soaring prices."
Exxon,2017-12,"The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) and the companies said on Monday they would start marketing their gas from the Gippsland Basin separately, starting in 2019."
Exxon,2017-12,"""The ACCC was concerned that the joint marketing arrangements were likely to have resulted in a substantial lessening of competition in the market for the supply of gas to buyers in the southern states,"" ACCC Chairman Rod Sims said in a statement."
Exxon,2017-12,"The commission raised concern last year about the tight grip the Gippsland Basin joint venture, the biggest producer in the country's southern states, had on the market. The ACCC flagged it might force the firms to sell their gas separately."
Exxon,2017-12,It could have taken ExxonMobil and BHP to court had they not agreed to break up the marketing joint venture.
Exxon,2017-12,"But an analyst at energy consultants Wood Mackenzie said separate marketing of the gas was unlikely to soften domestic gas prices much. Gas prices were effectively being determined by the liquefied natural gas export market, not the ExxonMobil-BHP joint venture, analyst Saul Kavonic said."
Exxon,2017-12,"""However the move will add an administrative burden and potentially complicate and delay expansions to gas supply from the (Gippsland Basin) project in the future,"" Wood Mackenzie's Kavonic said."
Exxon,2017-12,"BHP shares rose 1.5 percent on Monday, roughly in line with other big miners."
Exxon,2017-12,"""BHP has cooperated with the ACCC and strongly believes it has complied with the Competition and Consumer Act at all times,"" the company said in an emailed statement."
Exxon,2017-12,"The companies had long argued that joint marketing actually saved costs. ExxonMobil had warned in April 2016 that any unwinding of joint marketing ""could make it more difficult to invest and bring on new supplies in Gippsland""."
Exxon,2017-12,"""The two companies will cease marketing gas jointly at the end of 2018,"" Esso Australia, the local arm of ExxonMobil, said in an emailed statement on Monday."
Exxon,2017-12,"One of the commission's principal concerns was that big gas buyers, like manufacturing companies, were getting only one or two offers at most from gas suppliers for multi-year deals. Having BHP and ExxonMobil market separately would introduce new offers."
Exxon,2017-12,"Production from the Gippsland Basin venture is forecast to drop to 244 petajoules (PJ) in 2018 from a record 330 PJ this year, as one of its big fields has run out of gas earlier than expected, the commission said in a report last week."

Exxon,2017-12,"ANCHORAGE, Alaska, Dec 15 (Reuters) - The state of Alaska will receive hundreds of millions of dollars in a settlement with oil companies over the value of North Slope crude oil shipped through the Trans-Alaska Pipeline (TAP), officials announced."
Exxon,2017-12,The settlement between Alaska and the companies that own the 800-mile oil artery concerns transportation tariffs charged by the pipeline owners between 2009 and 2015.
Exxon,2017-12,"Alaska claimed that the Alyeska owner companies, including BP, ConocoPhillips, ExxonMobil, Koch Industries and Unocal, overstated the tariffs and improperly devalued the oil delivered by the pipeline, thus reducing state income."
Exxon,2017-12,"""This settlement is a great result for the State,"" Alaska Attorney General Jahna Lindemuth said in statement. ""It creates certainty going forward, avoids future litigation, and will provide additional taxes and royalties -- bringing needed money to the state treasury."""
Exxon,2017-12,"The settlement was filed Friday with the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the Regulatory Commission of Alaska (RCA), said Chief Alaska Attorney General John Ptacin. It is subject to FERC and RCA approval, which state officials hope will happen by next spring, he said."
Exxon,2017-12,"The settlement resolves multiple disputes over the time period. ""There's about 40 rate cases. We're settling all of those cases in this settlement agreement,"" Ptacin said."
Exxon,2017-12,The terms allow the state to retain $224 million in already collected revenues and grant the state an additional $165 million in oil revenues.
Exxon,2017-12,"Other terms require the companies to exclude from any tariff calculations approximately $625 million that the owner companies spent on ""strategic reconfiguration"" for TAPS operator Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. Terms also include a methodology for calculating transportation tariffs through 2021."
Exxon,2017-12,"The settlement resolves complaints the oil companies filed in Washington, D.C. and Alaska courts that challenged past FERC and RCA rulings, Ptacin said."
Exxon,2017-12,"Much of the disagreement stemmed from Alyeska's strategic reconfiguration project, which was aimed at streamlining operations, increasing automation and reducing costs in a time when the pipeline is carrying reduced oil volumes."
Exxon,2017-12,"The state argued that the owner companies botched the project and added costs that should not be used to reduce the value of North Slope crude or the revenues derived from that crude. The state prevailed on that point, Ptacin said."
Exxon,2017-12,"Disputes also concerned property taxes and how they would be treated in the tariff calculations, he said."
Exxon,2017-12,"Also parties to the settlement are Anadarko, Tesoro, Flint Hills and Petro Star Inc., which shipped oil through the pipeline but held no ownership shares. Those companies generally sided with the state in the tariff disputes, Ptacin said."

Exxon,2017-12,"Dec 13 (Reuters) - EQT Corp , the biggest U.S. natural gas producer, said on Wednesday it expects to spend $2.4 billion next year, the majority of which will be to develop more wells in two key shale formations in the Appalachian region."

Exxon,2017-12,"The company said it expects total production sales volume of 1,520-1,560 billion cubic feet equivalent (Bcfe) in 2018 and sales volume to increase 15 percent in 2019. [nBw2Wwh5qa]"

Exxon,2017-12,"BOSTON/HOUSTON, Dec 12 (Reuters) - Climate activists said on Tuesday they would take a tough shareholder resolution off the table at Exxon Mobil Corp after the company agreed to provide new details about how climate change could affect its business."
Exxon,2017-12,But top U.S. oil and gas producers may still face dissension at their springtime shareholder meetings as investors look for more of them to provide additional details on a range of climate topics such as greenhouse gas reduction plans.
Exxon,2017-12,"Exxon had been the focus of attention after a majority of investors in May backed a call for more disclosure about the impact that climate policies could have on its business, capping a wave of support for such resolutions. [nL1N1IX15V]"
Exxon,2017-12,"However, late on Monday the company laid out its intended response, to report on matters like how it is positioned ""for a lower-carbon future."" [nL8N1OB2K8]"
Exxon,2017-12,"In turn, one of the sponsors of the May resolution, New State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli, moved to withdraw a refiled version of the shareholder resolution for Exxon's 2018 meeting, his representatives said Tuesday."
Exxon,2017-12,"Officials there, and at other investment funds, said their efforts were hardly over. Pat Doherty, DiNapoli's director of corporate governance, said the office has filed a new round of climate proposals for the 2018 annual meetings of companies including Chesapeake Energy Corp and Southwestern Energy Co."
Exxon,2017-12,He also said the New York state comptroller's office would monitor Exxon's response and could turn against Exxon directors if its promised report does not provide enough specifics.

Exxon,2017-12,(Updates with INEOS saying outage could last up to 4 weeks)
Exxon,2017-12,"LONDON, Dec 12 (Reuters) - Britain's biggest pipeline from its North Sea oil and gas fields is likely to be shut for several weeks for repairs, its operator said on Tuesday, disrupting gas flows and sending international crude prices to their highest since mid-2015."
Exxon,2017-12,"The closure has struck during a winter freeze in Britain, where snow and ice have driven up demand for heating fuel just as gas flows through the network, which carries a third of Britain's gas produced offshore, were disrupted."
Exxon,2017-12,"""We are working to get the pipeline restored to full operation as quickly as we can safely do so... We have previously indicated a time frame of three to four weeks and we believe it is no less than two,"" operator INEOS said in a email to customers seen by Reuters."
Exxon,2017-12,"The pipeline, which carries about 450,000 barrels per day (bpd) of Forties crude, was shut after cracks were found."
Exxon,2017-12,"It has particular significance to global markets because Forties is the largest out of the five crude oil streams that underpin the dated Brent benchmark, against which other crude prices are broadly based. Benchmark Brent crude prices rose above $65 per barrel for the first time since the middle of 2015 following the closure on Monday. [O/R]"
Exxon,2017-12,INEOS only completed the purchase of the Forties pipeline system from oil major BP in October. A minor leak had caused a partial shutdown on Dec. 7 and a full shutdown on Monday. INEOS said the small crack has not increased over the past 24 hours.
Exxon,2017-12,"Paul Wheelhouse, the Scottish energy minister, said there were no plans to shut the 200,000 bpd Grangemouth refinery, which uses Forties crude. [nL9N1NR00L]"
Exxon,2017-12,"""If it's a lengthy outage, then a recovery period for the fields will be long as well,"" the trading source said."
Exxon,2017-12,"A number of producers including BP , Shell and Chrysaor, said they had closed down oil fields in response."
Exxon,2017-12,"The largest contributor to the Forties stream, the 180,000-bpd Buzzard oil field run by Nexen Petroleum UK Ltd, a subsidiary of China's CNOOC <0883.HK>, had also closed, two trading sources said. [CRU/OUT]"
Exxon,2017-12,"Monthly loading programmes show the supply of Forties is expected to reach 21 cargoes of 600,000 barrels each this month, equal to a daily supply rate of 406,000 bpd. [nL9N1AF03S]"
Exxon,2017-12,"The closure has created havoc with loading schedules in the North Sea, with one trading source saying cargo owners had been offered options to drop cargoes from the loading programme."
Exxon,2017-12,"""At this point we would expect a large deferral list for the Forties loading programme to spill over into January,"" analysts from JBC Energy said in a note."
Exxon,2017-12,"""The timing of the outage could not be much worse as winter weather is just materialising,"" Jefferies bank analysts wrote."
Exxon,2017-12,"Jefferies estimated the closure resulted in production loss for BP of 105,000 bpd, for Total of 55,000 bpd, for Chevron of 45,000 bpd, for Exxon Mobil of 40,000, for Eni of 25,000 bpd, for Shell of 25,000 bpd, for ConocoPhillips of 15,000 bpd."
Exxon,2017-12,"The Paris-based International Energy Agency, which advises Western governments and coordinates the release of oil from strategic stocks in the case of supply disruptions, said it stood ready to take action but it did not believe this was necessary for the time being."

Exxon,2017-12,* Trump has said he plans to take U.S. out of Paris agreement
Exxon,2017-12,"PARIS, Dec 12 (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron delivered a bleak assessment on the global fight against climate change to dozens of world leaders and company executives on Tuesday, telling them: ""We are losing the battle""."
Exxon,2017-12,"""We're not moving quickly enough. We all need to act,"" Macron said, seeking to breathe new life into a collective effort that was weakened this summer when President Donald Trump said he was pulling the United States out of an international accord brokered in the French capital two years ago."
Exxon,2017-12,"Macron, who has worked to establish his role as a global leader since his sweeping election win in May, said modern-day science was revealing with each day the danger that global warming posed to the planet, he said."
Exxon,2017-12,"""We are losing the battle,"" he said, urging a new phase in the fight against global warming."
Exxon,2017-12,"France announced a raft of 12 non-binding commitments, from a $300 million pledge to fight desertification to accelerating the transition towards a decarbonised economy. But there was no headline promise likely to reassure poor nations on the sharp end of climate change that they will be better able to cope."
Exxon,2017-12,Public and private financial institutions pledged to channel more funds to spur the transition to a green economy and investors said they would pressure corporate giants to shift towards more ecologically friendly strategies.
Exxon,2017-12,"Among the commitments, more than 200 institutional investors with $26 trillion in assets under management said on Tuesday they would step up pressure on the world's biggest corporate greenhouse gas emitters to combat climate change [nL8N1OB2K8]."
Exxon,2017-12,"That, they said, would be more effective than threatening to pull the plug on their investments in companies, which include Coal India , Gazprom , Exxon Mobil and China Petroleum & Chemical Corp <600028.SS>."
Exxon,2017-12,"The European Commission, meanwhile, said it was ""looking positively"" at plans to reduce capital requirements for environmentally-friendly investments by banks in a bid to boost the green economy [nL8N1OC1HC]."
Exxon,2017-12,"Climate change is causing more frequent and severe flooding, droughts, storms and heatwaves as average global temperatures rise to new records, sea ice melts in the Arctic and sea levels rise."
Exxon,2017-12,Developing nations say the rich are lagging with a commitment dating back to 2009 to provide $100 billion a year by 2020 - from public and private sources alike - to help them switch from fossil fuels to greener energy sources and adapt to the effects of climate change.
Exxon,2017-12,"On Tuesday, the European Commission announced 9 billion euros worth of investments targeting sustainable cities, sustainable energy and sustainable agriculture for Africa and EU neighbourhood countries."
Exxon,2017-12,Yet the United Nations Environment Programme says the cost of adapting to climate change in developing countries could rise to between $280 billion and $500 billion per year by 2050.
Exxon,2017-12,"""Despite the hype, the One Planet summit is delivering little for the world's people who are the most vulnerable to climate change,"" said Brandon Wu, director of policy and campaigns at ActionAid USA."

Exxon,2017-12,"The world's largest independent, publicly traded oil company said in a filing Monday night that it would comply with a request to improve disclosure surrounding climate change that more than 60 percent of shareholders approved in May. In a follow-up letter to New York's office of the comptroller, Exxon elaborated: New disclosures to investors will include ""energy demand sensitivities, the implications of two degree Celsius scenarios, and its positioning for a lower-carbon future."""
Exxon,2017-12,"It's an important step. Though the May proposal was non-binding, shareholder pressure has ratcheted up recently. Walden Asset Management, an active investor which voted for more disclosure, sent a letter this week reiterating its request. Exxon's board, notoriously secretive, risked another proxy fight if it decided not to comply."
Exxon,2017-12,"Exxon's concession, though, leaves room for creativity. It can base disclosures on its own precarious assumptions. For example, the company run by Darren Woods could predict that the only fossil fuel the world abandons is coal and address this by making changes to carbon-capture and storage. That doesn't take into account how global oil and gas demand might change."
Exxon,2017-12,In fact Exxon could use this opportunity do the opposite of what shareholders want: prove their current strategy is the correct one.
Exxon,2017-12,"- Exxon Mobil has decided to comply with a shareholder request to enhance company disclosures about the effect of climate change in its business, the company said in a regulatory filing on Dec. 11."
Exxon,2017-12,- On May 31 shareholders had approved a non-binding resolution spearheaded by the New York State Common Retirement Fund calling for Exxon to provide more information about the impact on its operations of global warming.
Exxon,2017-12,"- In a letter addressed specifically to Patrick Doherty, the director of corporate governance at New York state's comptroller's office, the company said the enhancements to its disclosure would include ""energy demand sensitivities, implications of two degree Celsius scenarios, and positioning for a lower-carbon future."" The company plans to publish the information in ""the near future."""

Exxon,2017-12,Public and private financial institutions pledged to channel more funds to spur the transition to a green economy and investors said they would pressure corporate giants to shift towards more ecologically friendly strategies.

Exxon,2017-12,{{20171212T004730.959+0000}}Exxon to provide details on climate-change impact to its businessBy Ross Kerber and Gary McWilliams
Exxon,2017-12,Dec 11 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp on Monday said it would publish new details about how climate change could affect its business in a move aimed at appeasing critics and forestalling another proxy fight next year.
Exxon,2017-12,"The largest U.S. oil and gas producer said in a filing to U.S. securities regulators that its board agreed to provide shareholders with information on ""energy demand sensitivities, implications of two degree Celsius scenarios, and positioning for a lower-carbon future."""
Exxon,2017-12,"Exxon's statement, which came three days before the deadline for its 2018 annual meeting resolution submissions, said additional information would be released in the near future, but did not provide details. The company's board originally opposed providing shareholders with a report outlining the potential impact of global warming on Exxon's long-term outlook."
Exxon,2017-12,"Thomas P. DiNapoli, New York state's comptroller, heads one the two lead sponsors of a shareholder resolution calling for Exxon to issue a climate-impact report. He called Monday's decision ""a win for shareholders and for the company's ability to manage risk."""
Exxon,2017-12,"However, another sponsor noted the lack of specificity in the company's statement. ""This is giving no detail,"" said Tim Smith, who leads shareholder engagement efforts at Walden Asset Management, a co-filer of last spring's resolution. He said Exxon's statement ""needs to be expanded to assure shareowners that they're responsive to last year's request."""
Exxon,2017-12,Some 50 shareholder and climate activists earlier this year demanded the company produce an annual report on the risks to its business from extreme climate and government policies seeking to reduce carbon emissions. The resolution was backed by 62 percent of shares voted in Exxon's May annual meeting.
Exxon,2017-12,"Other energy companies already have begun detailing their view of climate-related risks to their businesses. Refiner Marathon Petroleum Corp recently published a report, ""Perspectives on Climate-Related Scenarios,"" meant partly to address suggestions from the global Financial Stability Board about how to measure and respond to such risks."
Exxon,2017-12,Members of the shareholder group had said they were considering refiling had Exxon not agreed to a detailed plan. Big investors including BlackRock Inc and Vanguard Group backed the May resolution and have made climate change a priority in their governance efforts.
Exxon,2017-12,BlackRock and Vanguard representatives last week declined to comment on their outreach to Exxon. [nL1N1IX15V]
Exxon,2017-12,The report will carry weight beyond the company's next shareholder meeting. Exxon faces investigations by the Massachusetts and New York attorneys general into whether it has misled the public and investors by soft-pedaling climate change risks. Exxon has described the probes as politically motivated and intended to force it and others to change their positions on climate change.
Exxon,2017-12,"The big funds would likely cast more critical votes in 2018 if Exxon did not respond adequately to the resolution, Jason Malinowski, chief investment officer for the Seattle City Employees' Retirement System, which has about 115,000 Exxon shares, said on Friday."
Exxon,2017-12,"Malinowski's agency and leaders of two other pension funds separately have asked Exxon director Steven Reinemund to discuss governance reforms, such as changing pay programs and bringing in directors with ""climate-competent"" perspectives."

Exxon,2017-12,(Updates with INEOS saying outage could last up to 4 weeks)
Exxon,2017-12,"LONDON, Dec 12 (Reuters) - Britain's biggest pipeline from its North Sea oil and gas fields is likely to be shut for several weeks for repairs, its operator said on Tuesday, disrupting gas flows and sending international crude prices to their highest since mid-2015."
Exxon,2017-12,"The closure has struck during a winter freeze in Britain, where snow and ice have driven up demand for heating fuel just as gas flows through the network, which carries a third of Britain's gas produced offshore, were disrupted."
Exxon,2017-12,"""We are working to get the pipeline restored to full operation as quickly as we can safely do so... We have previously indicated a time frame of three to four weeks and we believe it is no less than two,"" operator INEOS said in a email to customers seen by Reuters."
Exxon,2017-12,"The pipeline, which carries about 450,000 barrels per day (bpd) of Forties crude, was shut after cracks were found."
Exxon,2017-12,"It has particular significance to global markets because Forties is the largest out of the five crude oil streams that underpin the dated Brent benchmark, against which other crude prices are broadly based. Benchmark Brent crude prices rose above $65 per barrel for the first time since the middle of 2015 following the closure on Monday. [O/R]"
Exxon,2017-12,INEOS only completed the purchase of the Forties pipeline system from oil major BP in October. A minor leak had caused a partial shutdown on Dec. 7 and a full shutdown on Monday. INEOS said the small crack has not increased over the past 24 hours.
Exxon,2017-12,"Paul Wheelhouse, the Scottish energy minister, said there were no plans to shut the 200,000 bpd Grangemouth refinery, which uses Forties crude. [nL9N1NR00L]"
Exxon,2017-12,"""If it's a lengthy outage, then a recovery period for the fields will be long as well,"" the trading source said."
Exxon,2017-12,"A number of producers including BP , Shell and Chrysaor, said they had closed down oil fields in response."
Exxon,2017-12,"The largest contributor to the Forties stream, the 180,000-bpd Buzzard oil field run by Nexen Petroleum UK Ltd, a subsidiary of China's CNOOC <0883.HK>, had also closed, two trading sources said. [CRU/OUT]"
Exxon,2017-12,"Monthly loading programmes show the supply of Forties is expected to reach 21 cargoes of 600,000 barrels each this month, equal to a daily supply rate of 406,000 bpd. [nL9N1AF03S]"
Exxon,2017-12,"The closure has created havoc with loading schedules in the North Sea, with one trading source saying cargo owners had been offered options to drop cargoes from the loading programme."
Exxon,2017-12,"""At this point we would expect a large deferral list for the Forties loading programme to spill over into January,"" analysts from JBC Energy said in a note."
Exxon,2017-12,"""The timing of the outage could not be much worse as winter weather is just materialising,"" Jefferies bank analysts wrote."
Exxon,2017-12,"Jefferies estimated the closure resulted in production loss for BP of 105,000 bpd, for Total of 55,000 bpd, for Chevron of 45,000 bpd, for Exxon Mobil of 40,000, for Eni of 25,000 bpd, for Shell of 25,000 bpd, for ConocoPhillips of 15,000 bpd."
Exxon,2017-12,"The Paris-based International Energy Agency, which advises Western governments and coordinates the release of oil from strategic stocks in the case of supply disruptions, said it stood ready to take action but it did not believe this was necessary for the time being."
Exxon,2017-12,"""The market is amply supplied from other sources and stocks are well above the five-year average,"" the IEA said. [nL8N1OC4HN]"

Exxon,2017-12,"BOSTON, Dec 5 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp urged Massachusetts' top court on Tuesday to block the state's attorney general from obtaining records to investigate whether the company for decades concealed its knowledge of the role fossil fuels have on climate change."
Exxon,2017-12,A lawyer for Exxon told justices on the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court that his arguments were focused only on whether Attorney General Maura Healey had jurisdiction to seek records to probe whether the oil company misled consumers and investors.
Exxon,2017-12,"""We are not asking this court to weigh in on the causes of climate change,"" Justin Anderson, Exxon's lawyer, said."
Exxon,2017-12,But Anderson said Healey was improperly trying to establish jurisdiction in part based on more than 300 Exxon-branded gas stations in Massachusetts operated by franchisees to justify probing the Texas-based company's actions elsewhere.
Exxon,2017-12,"""They can only be held to account here for what they've done here,"" Anderson said."
Exxon,2017-12,"Richard Johnston, Healey's chief legal counsel, countered that Exxon had control over the franchisees' marketing and conducted advertising on their behalf."
Exxon,2017-12,"""We should be able to find out whether they knew about impact of fossil fuels on global warming so they should have said more in those advertisements,"" Johnston said."
Exxon,2017-12,He urged the court to allow Healey to carry on her probe into whether Exxon failed to disclose what it knew to consumers and investors and engaged in a campaign to sow doubts about the science of climate change.
Exxon,2017-12,"Healey, a Democrat, and New York Democratic Attorney General Eric Schneiderman sought records following news reports in 2015 how Exxon's own scientists determined that reducing fossil fuel combustion was needed to mitigate the impact of climate change."
Exxon,2017-12,Those reports by InsideClimate News and the Los Angeles Times were based on documents from the 1970s and 1980s. Exxon contends that the documents were not inconsistent with its public positions.
Exxon,2017-12,"After Healey issued a demand for documents in April 2016, Exxon filed a lawsuit challenging the records request and another case in federal court challenging her and Schneiderman's investigations.[nL2N1H62AZ]"
Exxon,2017-12,Tuesday's hearing came after Exxon appealed a lower-court judge's January ruling denying its request to avoid handing over the documents.[nL1N1F202W]
Exxon,2017-12,"While the six justices gave no indication how they would rule, some expressed skepticism that the 300 stations could not create jurisdiction, even if consumers bought gas from a franchisee."

Exxon,2017-12,{{20171205T184523.491+0000}}U.S. oil industry group launches voluntary program to cut methane By Timothy Gardner
Exxon,2017-12,"WASHINGTON, Dec 5 (Reuters) - The American Petroleum Institute on Tuesday launched a voluntary program to cut emissions of the greenhouse gas methane from oil and gas operations, a move environmentalists said was not strong enough to adequately protect the climate."
Exxon,2017-12,"Under the program, agreed to by 26 companies including Exxon Mobil subsidiary XTO Energy, Shell , and Pioneer Natural Resources , drillers aim to reduce emissions of methane by plugging leaks, reducing venting at aging wells, and replacing or retrofitting equipment called pneumatic controllers."
Exxon,2017-12,"The program, on both existing and new facilities, does not set numerical goals to reduce the emissions."
Exxon,2017-12,"""There's a lot of different ways to look at the data, we could get wrapped around percentages,"" Eric Milito, the head of upstream and industry operations at the API, said about why the program does not set numerical goals. It is a ""surgical approach"" where the industry sees it is targeting the top three areas where technology and methods to reduce emissions exist, he said."
Exxon,2017-12,"The Interior Department's rules on methane waste from drillers on public lands, where about 9 percent of the natural gas and 5 percent of the oil was produced in the United States last fiscal year, went into effect in January. But the administration of President Donald Trump, which is trying to maximize output of fossil fuels, has sought to delay implementation of the rule, a move a federal judge struck down in October."
Exxon,2017-12,"The API said most companies will agree to take action on each of the three areas, but only have to agree to reducing emissions in one of the areas."
Exxon,2017-12,"Companies will implement the agreement in January and submit annual reports on their progress, available to the public."
Exxon,2017-12,"Environmentalists criticized the effort. ""Self-policing and voluntary measures continue the status quo: undocumented pollution, problems left unaddressed, and no industry accountability,"" said Lauren Pagel, a policy director, at Earthworks. Pagel said the program is moving in the opposite direction of robust and enforceable national and state safeguards."
Exxon,2017-12,"The Environmental Protection Agency designated a separate voluntary program called One Future in late 2016 to report methane reductions. But only about 10 companies signed on, out of about 8,000 operating independent producers, as low gas prices made drillers wary to take on new commitments."
Exxon,2017-12,Energy companies say the rule could cost them tens of thousands of dollars per well. The API has said the rule is unnecessary because drillers have made strides in cutting the emissions.

Exxon,2017-12,"BOSTON, Dec 5 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp urged Massachusetts' top court on Tuesday to block the state's attorney general from obtaining records to investigate whether the company for decades concealed its knowledge of the role fossil fuels have on climate change."
Exxon,2017-12,A lawyer for Exxon told justices on the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court that his arguments were focused only on whether Attorney General Maura Healey had jurisdiction to seek records to probe whether the oil company misled consumers and investors.
Exxon,2017-12,"""We are not asking this court to weigh in on the causes of climate change,"" Justin Anderson, Exxon's lawyer, said."
Exxon,2017-12,But Anderson said Healey was improperly trying to establish jurisdiction in part based on more than 300 Exxon-branded gas stations in Massachusetts operated by franchisees to justify probing the Texas-based company's actions elsewhere.
Exxon,2017-12,"""They can only be held to account here for what they've done here,"" Anderson said."
Exxon,2017-12,"Richard Johnston, Healey's chief legal counsel, countered that Exxon had control over the franchisees' marketing and conducted advertising on their behalf."
Exxon,2017-12,"""We should be able to find out whether they knew about impact of fossil fuels on global warming so they should have said more in those advertisements,"" Johnston said."
Exxon,2017-12,He urged the court to allow Healey to carry on her probe into whether Exxon failed to disclose what it knew to consumers and investors and engaged in a campaign to sow doubts about the science of climate change.
Exxon,2017-12,"Healey, a Democrat, and New York Democratic Attorney General Eric Schneiderman sought records following news reports in 2015 how Exxon's own scientists determined that reducing fossil fuel combustion was needed to mitigate the impact of climate change."
Exxon,2017-12,Those reports by InsideClimate News and the Los Angeles Times were based on documents from the 1970s and 1980s. Exxon contends that the documents were not inconsistent with its public positions.
Exxon,2017-12,"After Healey issued a demand for documents in April 2016, Exxon filed a lawsuit challenging the records request and another case in federal court challenging her and Schneiderman's investigations.[nL2N1H62AZ]"
Exxon,2017-12,Tuesday's hearing came after Exxon appealed a lower-court judge's January ruling denying its request to avoid handing over the documents.[nL1N1F202W]
Exxon,2017-12,"While the six justices gave no indication how they would rule, some expressed skepticism that the 300 stations could not create jurisdiction, even if consumers bought gas from a franchisee."
Exxon,2017-12,"""They believe they're buying Exxon gas,"" Justice Elspeth Cypher said. ""The citizens of this state believe that's what they're buying."""

Exxon,2017-12,"WASHINGTON, Dec 5 (Reuters) - The American Petroleum Institute on Tuesday launched a voluntary program to cut emissions of the greenhouse gas methane from oil and gas operations, a move environmentalists said was not strong enough to adequately protect the climate."
Exxon,2017-12,"Under the program, agreed to by 26 companies including Exxon Mobil subsidiary XTO Energy, Shell , and Pioneer Natural Resources , drillers aim to reduce emissions of methane by plugging leaks, reducing venting at aging wells, and replacing or retrofitting equipment called pneumatic controllers."
Exxon,2017-12,"The program, on both existing and new facilities, does not set numerical goals to reduce the emissions."
Exxon,2017-12,"""There's a lot of different ways to look at the data, we could get wrapped around percentages,"" Eric Milito, the head of upstream and industry operations at the API, said about why the program does not set numerical goals. It is a ""surgical approach"" where the industry sees it is targeting the top three areas where technology and methods to reduce emissions exist, he said."
Exxon,2017-12,"The Interior Department's rules on methane waste from drillers on public lands, where about 9 percent of the natural gas and 5 percent of the oil was produced in the United States last fiscal year, went into effect in January. But the administration of President Donald Trump, which is trying to maximize output of fossil fuels, has sought to delay implementation of the rule, a move a federal judge struck down in October."
Exxon,2017-12,"The API said most companies will agree to take action on each of the three areas, but only have to agree to reducing emissions in one of the areas."
Exxon,2017-12,"Companies will implement the agreement in January and submit annual reports on their progress, available to the public."
Exxon,2017-12,"Environmentalists criticized the effort. ""Self-policing and voluntary measures continue the status quo: undocumented pollution, problems left unaddressed, and no industry accountability,"" said Lauren Pagel, a policy director, at Earthworks. Pagel said the program is moving in the opposite direction of robust and enforceable national and state safeguards."
Exxon,2017-12,"The Environmental Protection Agency designated a separate voluntary program called One Future in late 2016 to report methane reductions. But only about 10 companies signed on, out of about 8,000 operating independent producers, as low gas prices made drillers wary to take on new commitments."
Exxon,2017-12,Energy companies say the rule could cost them tens of thousands of dollars per well. The API has said the rule is unnecessary because drillers have made strides in cutting the emissions.

Exxon,2017-12,{{20171204T224822.371+0000}}RPT-Global factors weigh against Bolivia in gas contract negotiations(Repeats earlier story with no changes to text)
Exxon,2017-12,"SANTA CRUZ, Dec 4 (Reuters) - Bolivia's declining natural gas reserves, rising global supplies and more flexible sale terms in the international market all count against South America's top gas exporter as it negotiates contracts with Brazil and Argentina, its two biggest customers."
Exxon,2017-12,At stake in these talks are one of Bolivia's main sources of export revenue and its ability to retain its role as the region's largest gas supplier.
Exxon,2017-12,Brazil and Argentina enter the talks with stronger hands: Both are taking steps toward developing domestic supplies that eventually could make them competitors.
Exxon,2017-12,"The emergence of a global liquefied natural gas (LNG) market with prices increasingly pegged to gas hubs and rising U.S. spot sales are influencing these talks, according to analysts and Bolivian officials."
Exxon,2017-12,"""The golden age of high prices and no competition is now over,"" said Alvaro Rios, Bolivia's former hydrocarbon minister and now a partner at consultancy Gas Energy Latin America. ""There will be a tough negotiation of prices and delivery terms."""
Exxon,2017-12,"Bolivia should remain a major gas supplier to both countries, but Rios believes the new deals will end up with smaller volumes and prices linked to international gas indices, not crude. Bolivia also is facing pressure to lower taxes and transportation costs on the sales, he said."
Exxon,2017-12,"Brazil, whose contract with Bolivia expires in 2019, said earlier this year it wanted to buy less to encourage domestic gas output, which is expected to rise after successful exploration and production auctions this year. Argentina also has lured foreign firms including Exxon Mobil Corp to develop its reserves in the Vaca Muerta formation.[nL2N1LI1RA]"
Exxon,2017-12,The two are either developing deepwater deposits or shale gas fields in part to lessen their reliance on a supplier whose reserves have plunged by 57 percent over the last decade.
Exxon,2017-12,"Bolivia's gas production, which grew until 2014 but fell slightly to 19.7 billion cubic meters last year, is expected to decline at least until 2020, according to analysts. Its number of active drilling rigs declined to 4 in October compared with 10 in the same month of 2013, according to Baker Hughes' rig count data."
Exxon,2017-12,"Bolivia's ""role in the Southern Cone is challenged by three components: pre-salt associated gas in Brazil, Argentina's Vaca Muerta shale gas, and LNG,"" said Wood Mackenzie analyst Mauro Chavez."
Exxon,2017-12,"The first test Bolivia faces is with Brazil. Bolivia's state-run YPFB has started renegotiating an agreement that covered up to 30.1 million cubic meters per day supplied by to Brazil's Petroleo Brasileiro , which has been recently taking much less than its quota."
Exxon,2017-12,"The declining purchases have forced YPFB to conduct negotiations with a half-dozen state-run and private firms in Brazil, instead of having state-run Petrobras strike a single deal for all purchases. [nL1N1JO1OQ] [nL2N1GL13L]"
Exxon,2017-12,"Whatever changes appear in Brazil's supply agreement, said government officials and analysts, likely will crop up in talks with Argentina. Its contract for up to 20 million cubic meters per day expires in 2026, but state-run Enarsa has been trying to get more flexible purchase terms, which could lead to an early renegotiation."
Exxon,2017-12,"Bolivia needs foreign investment to reverse a reserve decline that is now affecting its ability to renew long-term supply contracts. Last month, it unveiled deals with Spain's Repsol , Brazil's Petrobras , Royal Dutch Shell and Pan American Energy that would inject some $1.6 billion into natural gas exploration and production."
Exxon,2017-12,"Analysts expect Bolivia's low production costs and productive gas fields will continue to provide sales advantages over supplies of unconventional gas reserves and LNG from the United States, Peru and Trinidad and Tobago."
Exxon,2017-12,"But the rise of vast new global supplies and greater competition from LNG, primarily from the United States, suggest the terms for future sales will not be as favorable."

Exxon,2017-12,"SANTA CRUZ, Dec 4 (Reuters) - Bolivia's declining natural gas reserves, rising global supplies and more flexible sale terms in the international market all count against South America's top gas exporter as it negotiates contracts with Brazil and Argentina, its two biggest customers."
Exxon,2017-12,At stake in these talks are one of Bolivia's main sources of export revenue and its ability to retain its role as the region's largest gas supplier.

Exxon,2017-12,"{{20171201T233435.646+0000}}UPDATE 2-Exxon merging oil refining and marketing units (Adds other management changes, background on merging of units)"
Exxon,2017-12,"Dec 1 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp is merging its refining and marketing divisions to boost profits from its downstream businesses, the first major restructuring under Chief Executive Darren Woods."
Exxon,2017-12,"Neil Chapman, the head of its global chemicals operations, was named to the company's management committee, a board-elected panel that typically serves as a stepping stone for future chief executives, Exxon said on Friday."
Exxon,2017-12,"Chapman, 55, joins CEO Woods and four other senior vice presidents on the committee, which oversees the company's global operations. The president of ExxonMobil Chemical Co also was promoted to corporate senior vice president."
Exxon,2017-12,"The merger of the world's largest publicly-traded oil producer's refining and marketing operations will take place in the first quarter, the company said."
Exxon,2017-12,"Bryan Milton, 53, president of Exxon's fuels, lubricants & specialties marketing business, was named president of the new ExxonMobil Fuels & Lubricants Co effective Jan. 1."
Exxon,2017-12,"Dennis Wascom, president of Exxon's refining and supply subsidiary, will become vice president of operational excellence, safety, security, health and environment, said Exxon spokesman Scott Silvestri."
Exxon,2017-12,Woods took over the top job in January after former chief Rex Tillerson resigned to become U.S. secretary of state.
Exxon,2017-12,"The merging of refining, lubricants and marketing is the first major move by Woods since replacing Tillerson and is in the company's downstream operations, which he used to lead before taking over as CEO. [nL1N1NX164]"
Exxon,2017-12,"The reorganization aims to squeeze more profits from the fuel and lubricant businesses as the company works to improve its exploration and production operation, which have struggled since 2014 to adjust to lower oil and gas prices."
Exxon,2017-12,The company's downstream sector has grown in prominence since Woods took over leadership of Exxon.
Exxon,2017-12,The changes come as Exxon expands its refining division. The company is investing $20 billion through 2022 to expand its chemical and oil refining plants on the U.S. Gulf Coast.
Exxon,2017-12,"The refining and chemicals arms contributed more than $4.2 billion apiece to 2016 earnings, compared with a $196 million profit from exploration and production. Last year's results were affected by sharply lower crude prices."

Exxon,2017-12,{{20171204T110001.714+0000}}RPT-Global factors weigh against Bolivia in gas contract negotiations(Repeats earlier story with no changes to text)
Exxon,2017-12,"SANTA CRUZ, Dec 4 (Reuters) - Bolivia's declining natural gas reserves, rising global supplies and more flexible sale terms in the international market all count against South America's top gas exporter as it negotiates contracts with Brazil and Argentina, its two biggest customers."
Exxon,2017-12,At stake in these talks are one of Bolivia's main sources of export revenue and its ability to retain its role as the region's largest gas supplier.
Exxon,2017-12,Brazil and Argentina enter the talks with stronger hands: Both are taking steps toward developing domestic supplies that eventually could make them competitors.
Exxon,2017-12,"The emergence of a global liquefied natural gas (LNG) market with prices increasingly pegged to gas hubs and rising U.S. spot sales are influencing these talks, according to analysts and Bolivian officials."
Exxon,2017-12,"""The golden age of high prices and no competition is now over,"" said Alvaro Rios, Bolivia's former hydrocarbon minister and now a partner at consultancy Gas Energy Latin America. ""There will be a tough negotiation of prices and delivery terms."""
Exxon,2017-12,"Bolivia should remain a major gas supplier to both countries, but Rios believes the new deals will end up with smaller volumes and prices linked to international gas indices, not crude. Bolivia also is facing pressure to lower taxes and transportation costs on the sales, he said."
Exxon,2017-12,"Brazil, whose contract with Bolivia expires in 2019, said earlier this year it wanted to buy less to encourage domestic gas output, which is expected to rise after successful exploration and production auctions this year. Argentina also has lured foreign firms including Exxon Mobil Corp to develop its reserves in the Vaca Muerta formation.[nL2N1LI1RA]"
Exxon,2017-12,The two are either developing deepwater deposits or shale gas fields in part to lessen their reliance on a supplier whose reserves have plunged by 57 percent over the last decade.
Exxon,2017-12,"Bolivia's gas production, which grew until 2014 but fell slightly to 19.7 billion cubic meters last year, is expected to decline at least until 2020, according to analysts. Its number of active drilling rigs declined to 4 in October compared with 10 in the same month of 2013, according to Baker Hughes' rig count data."
Exxon,2017-12,"Bolivia's ""role in the Southern Cone is challenged by three components: pre-salt associated gas in Brazil, Argentina's Vaca Muerta shale gas, and LNG,"" said Wood Mackenzie analyst Mauro Chavez."
Exxon,2017-12,"The first test Bolivia faces is with Brazil. Bolivia's state-run YPFB has started renegotiating an agreement that covered up to 30.1 million cubic meters per day supplied by to Brazil's Petroleo Brasileiro , which has been recently taking much less than its quota."
Exxon,2017-12,"The declining purchases have forced YPFB to conduct negotiations with a half-dozen state-run and private firms in Brazil, instead of having state-run Petrobras strike a single deal for all purchases. [nL1N1JO1OQ] [nL2N1GL13L]"
Exxon,2017-12,"Whatever changes appear in Brazil's supply agreement, said government officials and analysts, likely will crop up in talks with Argentina. Its contract for up to 20 million cubic meters per day expires in 2026, but state-run Enarsa has been trying to get more flexible purchase terms, which could lead to an early renegotiation."
Exxon,2017-12,"Bolivia needs foreign investment to reverse a reserve decline that is now affecting its ability to renew long-term supply contracts. Last month, it unveiled deals with Spain's Repsol , Brazil's Petrobras , Royal Dutch Shell and Pan American Energy that would inject some $1.6 billion into natural gas exploration and production."
Exxon,2017-12,"Analysts expect Bolivia's low production costs and productive gas fields will continue to provide sales advantages over supplies of unconventional gas reserves and LNG from the United States, Peru and Trinidad and Tobago."
Exxon,2017-12,"But the rise of vast new global supplies and greater competition from LNG, primarily from the United States, suggest the terms for future sales will not be as favorable."
Exxon,2017-12,"At last month's meeting of the Gas Exporting Countries Forum (GECF) in Santa Cruz, producers forecast a market in oversupply at least until 2025. [nL1N1NS0QR] [nL1N1NU0YU]"
Exxon,2017-12,"""The cost of LNG is slightly higher than the cost of Bolivian natural gas, but on these issues we have to take into account that the most expensive natural gas is the one you don't have,"" said Bernardo Prado, an oil and gas consultant based in La Paz, suggesting that some buyers may opt for more expensive LNG instead of relying on uncertain supplies from Bolivia."

Exxon,2017-12,"LONDON/VIENNA, Dec 4 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil is considering a foray into Egypt offshore oil and gas, seeking to replicate rivals' success in the country and boost its reserves, officials and industry sources said."
Exxon,2017-12,"Officials from the world's largest listed oil producer recently held talks with Egypt's petroleum ministry to discuss investments in oil and gas production, known as upstream operations, Petroleum Minister Tarek El Molla told Reuters."
Exxon,2017-12,"""We have been discussing with them, visiting them. They've visited us... We are exploring all opportunities for having more and further upstreamers in Egypt,"" Molla said on the sidelines of an OPEC meeting in Vienna."
Exxon,2017-12,"""I would be happy to have them with us,"" he said, adding that no decision has been made yet."
Exxon,2017-12,"Exxon declined to comment. The Irving, Texas-based company currently has no upstream operations in Egypt, according to its website."

Exxon,2017-12,"LONDON/VIENNA, Dec 4 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil is considering a foray into Egypt offshore oil and gas, seeking to replicate rivals' success in the country and boost its reserves, officials and industry sources said."
Exxon,2017-12,"Officials from the world's largest listed oil producer recently held talks with Egypt's petroleum ministry to discuss investments in oil and gas production, known as upstream operations, Petroleum Minister Tarek El Molla told Reuters."
Exxon,2017-12,"""We have been discussing with them, visiting them. They've visited us... We are exploring all opportunities for having more and further upstreamers in Egypt,"" Molla said on the sidelines of an OPEC meeting in Vienna."
Exxon,2017-12,"""I would be happy to have them with us,"" he said, adding that no decision has been made yet."
Exxon,2017-12,"Exxon declined to comment. The Irving, Texas-based company currently has no upstream operations in Egypt, according to its website."
Exxon,2017-12,"The company is looking at exploring the eastern Mediterranean offshore basin, according to industry sources."
Exxon,2017-12,"Italy's Eni this month is set to begin producing gas from the Zohr field in the Mediterranean, among the biggest discoveries of the past decade."

Exxon,2017-12,"Exxon is also considering opportunities in the Red Sea, where Cairo is preparing to tender exploration blocks, industry sources briefed on the matter told Reuters."
Exxon,2017-12,"Egypt in 2016 had reserves of 3.5 billion barrels of oil and 1.8 trillion cubic metres of gas, according to BP's Statistical Review of World Energy."
Exxon,2017-12,Egypt has recently ramped up efforts to attract foreign investment in its oil sector to boost its struggling economy.
Exxon,2017-12,"Along with Eni, BP and Royal Dutch Shell also have significant operations in Egypt in offshore gas production, which is consumed domestically although Cairo aims to become a gas exporter."
