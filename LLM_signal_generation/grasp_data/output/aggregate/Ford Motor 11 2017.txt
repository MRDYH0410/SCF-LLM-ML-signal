Ford Motor,2017-11,{{20171129T224312.203+0000}}Fitch sees U.S. auto sales for 2018 at 16.8 mln unitsBy Nick Carey
Ford Motor,2017-11,"DETROIT, Nov 29 (Reuters) - Fitch Ratings said it expects U.S. new vehicle sales to drop slightly in 2018, which ""could weigh a bit"" on General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co because of the importance of their home market on their overall earnings performance."
Ford Motor,2017-11,Fitch expects auto sales to hit 16.8 million units in 2018. Auto consultancy LMC recently raised its 2017 full-year forecast to 17.2 million units from 17.1 million units.
Ford Motor,2017-11,"""Although Fitch's outlook for the U.S. auto sector is stable, downside risks are increasing,"" senior director Stephen Brown wrote in a note."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"Despite the risk for GM and Ford, Brown wrote both automakers should ""perform solidly"" in 2018."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"Near term, Brown wrote that geopolitical risks such as the ongoing renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) ""that could negatively impact the sector are rising."""
Ford Motor,2017-11,"Longer term, new technologies such as electric vehicles and self-driving cars could create new competitors that may ""upend the industry's status quo,"" he added."
Ford Motor,2017-11,U.S. new auto sales rose from the end of the Great Recession through to 2016 when they hit an annual record of 17.55 million units.
Ford Motor,2017-11,"But a saturated market, thanks partly to a glut of nearly new used vehicles, has forced automakers to hike discounts to entice consumers to buy this year and full-year 2017 total sales are expected to decline slightly to a little over 17 million units versus 2016."
Ford Motor,2017-11,LMC expects car sales to dip slightly to 17 million units in 2018 and 16.8 million units in 2019.

Ford Motor,2017-11,"On Wednesday, a group of 10 leading passenger-car and truck manufacturers announced an initiative to jointly identify and address ethical, environmental, human and labour rights issues in raw materials sourcing."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"The partnership dubbed ""Drive Sustainability"" consists of VW, Toyota Motor Europe, Ford , Daimler , BMW , Honda <7267.T>, Jaguar Land Rover , Volvo Cars <0175.HK> and truckmakers Scania and Volvo ."

Ford Motor,2017-11,"DETROIT, Nov 20 (Reuters) - Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd , one of India's oldest vehicle manufacturers, is testing autonomous tractors, trucks and cars, while moving closer to bringing electric vehicles to the United States, Chairman Anand Mahindra said on Monday."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"The company, which opened a new North American headquarters north of Detroit on Monday, is considering when to begin U.S. sales of the vehicles, Anand Mahindra said in an interview."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"It is also weighing whether the vehicles should carry the Mahindra brand or those of its affiliates Pininfarina, the famed Italian design house; and Ssangyong Motor Co <003620.KS>, a Korean manufacturer of utility and crossover vehicles, he added."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"Mahindra & Mahindra bought Ssangyong in 2011 and Pininfarina in 2015. The Indian parent is collaborating with both companies on the development of electric vehicles, including premium models for Pininfarina that likely would compete with Tesla Inc . Anand Mahindra suggested that Ssangyong and Pininfarina electric vehicles might be sold in both the United States and China."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"Earlier this year, Autocar India reported that Pininfarina was developing a family of electric vehicles for China's Hybrid Kinetic Group, as well as its own electric supercar. The magazine also reported that Ssangyong planned to launch an all-electric crossover vehicle in Korea in 2019."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"In early November, Ssangyong said it had received approval to begin testing of autonomous vehicles in Korea, but did not say when it planned to produce them."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"Anand Mahindra said his company, one of the world's largest tractor manufacturers, had been testing self-driving models since it bought a minority stake in Japan's Mitsubishi Agriculture Machinery in 2015. Mahindra & Mahindra operates several U.S. tractor assembly plants."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"While work on the self-driving vehicles is still in the early stages, Mahindra & Mahindra has been building electric vehicles in India since the mid-1990s, when it developed a small fleet battery-powered, three-wheeled rickshaws for use in Delhi, the chairman said."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"Mahindra & Mahindra bought Reva Electric Car Co, a small Bangalore-based manufacturer, in 2010 and transformed it into Mahindra Electric Mobility Ltd, which designs and builds compact electric vehicles for the Indian market."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"In mid-September, the company renewed ties with Ford Motor Co through a new alliance that envisions sharing of technology, product development and parts sourcing, especially on electric vehicles."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"The companies had a short-lived joint venture, Mahindra Ford India Ltd, established in 1995. Ford took control of the venture in 1998 and renamed it Ford India."

Ford Motor,2017-11,"MEXICO CITY, Nov 20 (Reuters) - Canada and Mexico will not make counterproposals to U.S. demands for tougher NAFTA automotive content rules but instead will offer rebuttals and pepper American negotiators with technical questions on Monday, people familiar with the talks said."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"Canada will make a presentation arguing U.S. demands would cause serious damage to U.S. as well as North American automotive manufacturing, a Canadian source with knowledge of the negotiations said."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"The rebuttal is expected to come on Monday as negotiators resume discussions on automotive rules of origin in the fifth round of talks to update the 23-year-old North American Free Trade Agreement between the United States, Canada and Mexico."
Ford Motor,2017-11,The Trump administration last month stunned its NAFTA partners by unveiling demands that half of the value content of all North American-built autos be produced in the United States and that the regional vehicle content requirement be sharply increased to 85 percent from the current 62.5 percent.
Ford Motor,2017-11,The demands are aimed at meeting U.S. President Donald Trump's NAFTA goals of stemming the flow of U.S. carmaking jobs to low-wage Mexico and reversing a $64 billion U.S. trade deficit with its southern neighbor.
Ford Motor,2017-11,"The Canadian negotiating team's presentation will ""provide information about how the U.S. rules of origin proposal for autos would damage the continental industry in general and the United States in particular,"" the Canadian source said."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"""If you move the content requirement to 80 percent, or even to a number lower than that, it will hit the supply chains. You would then have to deal with potentially ill-equipped suppliers that are maybe more expensive,"" the source added."
Ford Motor,2017-11,A spokeswoman for the U.S. Trade Representative's office on Sunday declined to comment on the talks.
Ford Motor,2017-11,"Flavio Volpe, president of Canada's Automotive Parts Manufacturers Association, also said Canada and Mexico would try to convince U.S. officials that the proposals would damage North American competitiveness and lead to fewer auto assembly and parts jobs on the continent."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"Volpe told Reuters that his group has been briefing Canadian negotiators on the effects of the U.S. proposals. Its analysis found that even if some assembly operations are returned to the United States, these job gains will be more than offset by parts production moving to Asia and other low-cost production areas."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"Many car manufacturers and parts makers will simply forego NAFTA free-trade benefits and pay the 2.5 percent U.S. tariff on many components, he added."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"His U.S. counterpart, the Motor and Equipment Manufacturers Association, last month unveiled a study showing that the United States would lose up to 24,000 auto parts manufacturing jobs from higher NAFTA content requirements and up to 50,000 if NAFTA is terminated. [nL2N1MN0G4]"

Ford Motor,2017-11,"MINSK/MOSCOW, Nov 17 (Reuters) - A joint venture between Belarus and Chinese carmaker Geely on Friday unveiled a plant producing Belarussian-made vehicles, targeting the Russian market."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"The investment is a measure of growing political ties between China and Belarus, a country envisaged as a gateway for China to the European Union, part of China's giant investment initiative known as One Belt One Road."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"China is a welcome source of funds for Belarus, which relies heavily on Russian money to keep its Soviet-style economic model afloat and strongman president Alexander Lukashenko in power."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"China is building a new airport in Minsk, energy infrastructure and a commercial park known as Great Stone just outside the capital."
Ford Motor,2017-11,Lukashenko said the plant embodied his dream of having cars produced in Belarus and promised to sign a decree stimulating car sales in the country.
Ford Motor,2017-11,"""Our friends responded to my request and helped to create this beautiful plant,"" said Lukashenko, according to the state agency BelTA."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"The plant, 70 km (44 miles) from Minsk, aims to produce 25,000 and 35,000 cars in 2018 and 2019 respectively and has the capacity to make 60,000 cars per year."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"""Ninety percent of the cars produced will be targeted at the Russian market,"" the company said in a statement."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"The Belarussian authorities have spoken previously of plans to expand the plant to increase production to 120,000 cars."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"But for the first nine months of this year, Geely sold only about 1,700 cars in Russia, and sales volumes fell 55 percent compared to 2016."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"According to Russian analysts, the plant, which will take advantage of Belarus's membership of the Russian-dominated Eurasian Customs Union, will be able to increase sales."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"But even so, analysts downplayed the ability of the Russian market to absorb more Chinese cars."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"""The market is growing, but it depends on prices and the range. In any case they will not be able to sell 30,000 per year,"" said Sergey Udalov, deputy head of consultancy Autostat."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"""I think it is possible to increase sales to 10,000, but I do not think they will be able to sell more."""
Ford Motor,2017-11,"The plant is not Belarus's first attempt to establish its own car production. Previous efforts included investment from Ford and Skoda, but these projects folded."

Ford Motor,2017-11,"Nov 15 (Reuters) - General Motors Co plans to launch a new family of electric vehicles in 2021 that will cost less to build and make a profit for the U.S. No. 1 automaker, Chief Executive Mary Barra told investors on Wednesday."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"Her plans represent a direct challenge to money-losing electric vehicle specialist Tesla Inc , which is struggling to get its more affordable, high-volume Model 3 launched and recently reported its largest-ever quarterly loss. [nL2N1N72DJ]"
Ford Motor,2017-11,"""We are committed to a future electric vehicle portfolio that will be profitable,"" Barra said at the Barclays Global Automotive Conference in New York."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"Electric and autonomous vehicles - known in the industry as EVs and AVs - are widely seen as the keystones of future transport, but Tesla, Ford Motor Co and other manufacturers are still working out how to make money on them."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"GM is looking to break out of that pattern by developing an all-new electric vehicle platform that will accommodate multiple sizes and segments, to be sold by different GM brands in the United States and China, Barra said, adding new details to GM's aggressive electrification strategy."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"In early October, GM said it planned to launch 20 new electric vehicles by 2023, but did not provide specifics. [nL2N1MD1YS]"
Ford Motor,2017-11,"In comparison, rival Ford has said it plans to introduce 13 ""electrified"" vehicles - mostly hybrid gasoline-electric models - by 2022. [nL4N1ME3GX]"
Ford Motor,2017-11,GM's shares were down 0.4 percent at $42.84 in midday trade. Tesla and Ford shares were also down slightly in a broadly lower market.
Ford Motor,2017-11,"Barra said GM aims to be selling 1 million electric vehicles a year by 2026, many of them in China, which has set strict production quotas on such vehicles. On Monday, GM's China chief said the automaker and its joint-venture partners will be able to meet the country's 2019 electric vehicle requirements without purchasing credits from other companies. [nL3N1NJ344]"
Ford Motor,2017-11,GM's cost reduction efforts on electric vehicles center on a new battery system that will be more than 30 percent cheaper than the one that powers the Chevrolet Bolt.
Ford Motor,2017-11,"The company aims to cut the cost of its lithium-ion batteries to less than $100 per kilowatt-hour from $145 per kilowatt-hour by 2021, which would bring the overall cost of electric vehicles much closer to comparable gasoline-engine models."
Ford Motor,2017-11,GM said the new batteries would hold more energy and charge quicker. The company is aiming to boost electric vehicle range to more than 300 miles (483 km) with the new batteries. The current Bolt is rated at 238 miles between charges.
Ford Motor,2017-11,"Barra said GM will have the ability to manufacture high volumes of the new batteries at plants in the United States and China. She said GM projects sales of 1 million electric vehicles a year by 2026. So far, the company has sold about 17,000 Bolts."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"GM's new electric vehicle platform in 2021 will serve as a base for at least nine derivatives, ranging from a compact crossover to a large seven-passenger luxury sports utility vehicle and a large commercial van. It will also provide the underpinning for a shared autonomous vehicle (AV) that GM plans to put into commercial service."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"Before the new platform arrives, GM plans to introduce three new electric vehicles by 2020, including two crossovers, that will share basic components with the Bolt, Barra said. She described GM as ""the only fully integrated developer of AVs with true scale capability."""
Ford Motor,2017-11,"""We are not capital constrained in our EV or AV development,"" she added."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"GM is generating strong profit from selling trucks and sport utility vehicles in the United States, and Barra reaffirmed a promise to investors that GM's core North American vehicle business should achieve 10 percent pre-tax profit margins."

Ford Motor,2017-11,"Under the trade deal, at least 62.5 percent of the material in a car or light truck made in the region must be from North America to be able to enter the marketplace tariff-free."

Ford Motor,2017-11,"DETROIT, Nov 14 (Reuters) - Software startup STRATIM is tracking more than 1 million vehicles in car- or ride-sharing services for around 50 customers in North America, including major automakers, to help them boost usage and keep their vehicle fleets in working order, the company said on Tuesday."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"STRATIM gave its first public update on Tuesday on its software platform for such services, which help manage vehicle fleets, keep cars in good working order, fueled up and generating sufficient revenue."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"San Francisco-based STRATIM's platform is operating in 20 U.S. cities and its clients include General Motors Co's Maven car sharing and rental unit, Ford Motor Co's Chariot shuttle service, Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T> and BMW AG ."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"Major automakers are racing to roll out alternatives to private car ownership including ride sharing amid the rise of Uber and Lyft Inc, as well as to develop commercially viable self-driving cars."
Ford Motor,2017-11,The rush is based on the notion that instead of buying cars - the auto industry's business model for a century - consumers in the future will generate revenue through car usage.
Ford Motor,2017-11,One challenge for automakers is how to monitor or manage fleets of vehicles when their core traditional business is building cars. STRATIM says it may be part of the answer.
Ford Motor,2017-11,"Keeping shared cars in service is key to boosting profit margins as fleet management services can, for instance, provide alerts on when to fuel a car, fix a cracked windshield or replace a flat tire, STRATIM Chief Executive Sean Behr told Reuters."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"""It doesn't matter how great your vehicle or self-driving car is if you can't reliably keep it on the street to pick up customers, the best technology in the world is not going to save you,"" he said."

Ford Motor,2017-11,"Nov 9 (Reuters) - Workers at a Chinese-owned auto glass plant in southwestern Ohio voted heavily against union representation, the United Auto Workers (UAW) said on Thursday, in a major blow for the union's strategy for organizing foreign-owned auto factories."
Ford Motor,2017-11,UAW's defeat comes after a stinging loss it suffered in the U.S. Deep South in August.
Ford Motor,2017-11,"The vote, which began on Wednesday, involved roughly 1,500 workers at the Fuyao Glass Industry Group Co Ltd <600660.SS> plant in Moraine, a Dayton suburb that was once home to a large, unionized General Motors Co assembly plant."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"The union lost by a nearly two-to-one margin, with 868 votes against union representation and 444 votes for."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"""Fuyao workers fighting for a voice in their workplace were unable to win against a barrage of anti-labor tactics and intimidation by management at the Ohio glass plant,"" the UAW said in a statement."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"The UAW needed a win after losing a bitterly contested vote at a Nissan Motor Co Ltd <7201.T> plant in Mississippi in August, which extended a decades-long record of failure to organize a major automaker's plant in the U.S. South. [nL1N1KR04I]"
Ford Motor,2017-11,The vote also came amid an expanding U.S. Justice Department probe into alleged misuse of funds at UAW training centers funded by the Detroit automakers. [nL2N1N8232]

[nL2N1CC2EJ]"
Ford Motor,2017-11,"Though UAW membership has crept up since the end of the Great Recession, it is around half of what it was in 1998 and well below a peak of 1.5 million members in 1979. The Detroit automakers and their suppliers have slashed workforces at UAW-represented factories over the past 30 years as they have automated and lost sales to European and Asian rivals."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"This year could be the first in which North American vehicle production by the unionized Detroit Three automakers falls to less than half of total vehicle output in the region, according to IHS Markit. [nL2N1M81RG]"
Ford Motor,2017-11,"At Fuyao's Ohio factory, the UAW told workers it could help secure better safety and higher pay."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"Rich Rankin, head of the UAW region covering Ohio and Indiana, said workers at the Fuyao plant start at $10 an hour, much less than the $22 an hour they can make at two other unionized automotive glass plants in his region."
Ford Motor,2017-11,He said he grew up hearing about U.S. companies that would go abroad and pay workers low wages in poor conditions.
Ford Motor,2017-11,"""It's amazing to me that this is now happening to U.S. workers in America's manufacturing heartland,"" he said on Tuesday."

Ford Motor,2017-11,"U.S. Senator Sherrod Brown, a Democrat, wrote to Fuyao in October saying its success is ""contingent on creating a safe and supportive working environment""."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"Meanwhile, 15 Ohio Republican state representatives wrote an open letter urging employees to reject ""outside forces"" trying to come into the Chinese supplier's Ohio factory."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"Harley Shaiken, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, specializing in labor and the global economy, said while workers had real grievances at the plant, rules preventing unions from talking to workers inside factories played in Fuyao's favor."

Ford Motor,2017-11,"WAYNE, Mich., Nov 9 (Reuters) - Robots have replaced many U.S. manufacturing workers, but new mechanical exoskeletons being tested by Ford Motor Co may help factory workers to function like bionic people, reducing the physical damage of millions of repetitive tasks over many years."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"The U.S. automaker said on Thursday that workers at two U.S. factories are testing upper-body exoskeletons developed by Richmond, California-based Ekso Bionics Holdings Inc, which are designed to reduce injuries and increase productivity."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"The four EksoVests were paid for by the United Auto Workers union, which represents hourly workers at Ford, and the automaker plans tests for the exoskeleton in other regions including Europe and South America. The cost of the exoskeletons, which were developed as part of a partnership between Ford and Ekso, was undisclosed."
Ford Motor,2017-11,Two workers at each of the company's Wayne and Flat Rock factories have been testing the exoskeletons since May.
Ford Motor,2017-11,"The lightweight vest supports workers while they perform overhead tasks, providing lift assistance of up to 15 pounds (6.8 kg) per arm through a mechanical actuator that uses torque to take the stress off a worker's shoulders."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"If you try one on, if feels like an empty backpack, but it enables you to hold a weight such as a heavy wrench straight out in front of you indefinitely and without strain."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"Ekso began by developing exoskeletons for the military and medical fields, but branched out in manufacturing and construction in 2013."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"Paul ""Woody"" Collins, 51, a worker at Ford's Wayne plant, has been at the automaker for 23 years and has worn an EksoVest since May. He attaches bolts and parts to the undersides of Ford Focus and C-Max models, raising his hands above his head around 1 million times a year."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"Since wearing the vest, he has stopped having to put ice and heat on his neck three or four days a week and finds he has energy after work instead of feeling exhausted."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"Russ Angold, Ekso's chief technology officer, said the aim is to get workers used to the technology before moving eventually into ""powered"" exoskeletons that ""will help with lift and carry"" work."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"""The idea is to demonstrate this isn't science fiction, it's real and it has real value,"" Angold said on Thursday. ""As we prove its value, we will be able to expand into other tasks."""
Ford Motor,2017-11,The No. 2 U.S. automaker has been studying for years how to lower its workers' injury rates and the exoskeleton venture is the latest step in that process.
Ford Motor,2017-11,"From 2005 to 2016, Ford recorded an 83 percent decrease in injuries or incidents that resulted in days away, work restrictions or job transfers, to a rate of 1.55 incidents per 100 full-time employees."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"That is a little over half the rate of 2.9 cases per 100 workers for private employers in 2016, according to U.S. government data."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"""We have made great progress, but shoulders are still our number one injury and they take a lot of time to heal,"" Marty Smets, the Ford ergonomics engineer in charge of testing the exoskeletons, said on Thursday.."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"Collins, the Ford worker in Wayne, was supposed to wear the vest only until August, but has now asked to keep it."

Ford Motor,2017-11,{{20171109T163546.767+0000}}UPDATE 2-NAFTA uncertainty could delay corporate investment - Magna CEO(Recasts with CEO comments)
Ford Motor,2017-11,Nov 9 (Reuters) - Canadian auto parts maker Magna International Inc's chief executive said on Thursday that uncertainty over NAFTA and proposed U.S. corporate tax cuts could prompt companies to suspend investment or pour capital into the United States.
Ford Motor,2017-11,"U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to withdraw from the North American Free Trade Agreement among the United States, Canada and Mexico, which is heavily used by automakers that have production and supply chains spread across the three countries."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"""I think anybody that is contemplating any big investments over the long term is probably either waiting or they are going to be biased to invest more in the U.S. until there's an outcome here,"" CEO Don Walker said on an analysts call, when asked about the impact of NAFTA talks on automakers."
Ford Motor,2017-11,But he said Magna had not changed the way it deploys capital because of NAFTA renegotiations or proposed U.S. corporate tax cuts.
Ford Motor,2017-11,"Trump has proposed changes to the rules of origin for autos, which are used to determine how much of a vehicle is made in a certain place. The proposed rules were viewed as untenable for automakers, as well as Mexico and Canada. [nL2N1MZ1RA]"
Ford Motor,2017-11,"On Thursday, Magna raised its full-year sales forecast for the third time this year on strength from outside North America, but warned that part of its transmission business could soften after 2017."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"Magna Chief Financial Officer Vince Galifi told analysts that the company anticipates ""some softening"" in unconsolidated sales over the next couple of years from its Getrag business, which makes transmissions in locations such as Europe and China."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"The softening ""relates to a market shift from manual transmissions to automatic,"" in addition to certain customer growth plans now being forecast lower than previously expected, he said."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"Magna shares fell 2.1 percent in Thursday trade. On Wednesday, shares in rival auto parts maker Linamar Corp fell more than 13 percent after reporting lower-than-expected earnings. [nL3N1NE5LW]"
Ford Motor,2017-11,"""Regardless of the lower than previously anticipated unconsolidated net sales, we still expect significant growth in Getrag's business over the next few years,"" Galifi said."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"Ontario-headquartered Magna said it now expects 2017 total sales of $38.3 billion to $39.5 billion, compared with its previous forecast of $37.7 billion to $39.4 billion."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"Total third-quarter sales grew 7 percent on an annual basis to $9.50 billion, as stronger demand in Europe and Asia offset a 5 percent decline in North America, where U.S. auto sales are expected to weaken in 2017. For details: [nASB0BSPS]"
Ford Motor,2017-11,"Magna, which also assembles cars under contract from motor vehicle manufacturers, counts General Motors Co , Volkswagen AG , BMW and Ford Motor Co as its biggest customers."

Ford Motor,2017-11,"BEIJING/SHANGHAI, Nov 9 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump can return to the United States claiming to have snagged over $250 billion in deals from his maiden trip to Beijing. Whether those deals live up to the lofty price tag is another question altogether."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"Watched by Trump and China's President Xi Jinping at a signing ceremony in Beijing, U.S. planemaker Boeing Co , General Electric Co and chip giant Qualcomm Inc sealed lucrative multi-billion dollar deals."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"""This is truly a miracle,"" China's Commerce Minister Zhong Shan said at a briefing in Beijing."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"The quarter of a trillion dollar haul underscores how Trump is keen to be seen to address a trade deficit with the world's second-largest economy that he has long railed against and called ""shockingly high"" on Thursday."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"But U.S. businesses still have many long-standing concerns to complain about, including unfettered access to the China market, cybersecurity and the growing presence of China's ruling Communist Party inside foreign firms."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"William Zarit, chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, said the deals pointed to ""a strong, vibrant bilateral economic relationship"" between the two countries."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"""Yet we still need to focus on levelling the playing field, because U.S. companies continue to be disadvantaged doing business in China."""
Ford Motor,2017-11,"U.S. tech companies like Facebook Inc and Google are mostly blocked in China. Automakers Ford Motor Co and General Motors must operate through joint ventures, while Hollywood movies face a strict quota system."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"""(These deals) allow Trump to portray himself as a master dealmaker, while distracting from a lack of progress on structural reforms to the bilateral trade relationship,"" Hugo Brennan, Asia analyst at risk consultancy Verisk Maplecroft, said in a note."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"Some huge deals were announced. Among them is a 20-year $83.7 billion investment by China Energy Investment Corp in shale gas developments and chemical manufacturing projects in West Virginia, a major energy producing state that voted heavily for Trump in the 2016 election. [[nL3N1NF375]"
Ford Motor,2017-11,"""The massive size of this energy undertaking and level of collaboration between our two countries is unprecedented,"" West Virginia Secretary of Commerce H. Wood Thrasher said in a statement."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"It marks the first major overseas investment for the newly founded China Energy, which formed from the merger of China Shenhua Group, the country's largest coal producer and China Guodian Corp, one of China's top five utilities."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"However, as is often the case during state visits, many of the deals were packaged as ""non-binding"" agreements, gave scant details or rolled over existing tie-ups, helping pump up the headline figure."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"""I am somewhat sceptical of such a large number,"" Alex Wolf, senior emerging markets economist at Aberdeen Standard Investments, told the Reuters Global Markets Forum, adding that the overall tone of the visit so far had been ""positive""."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"""I suspect they might be primarily MOUs (memorandum of understandings) instead of actual contracts and the actual contract amount may be substantially less."""
Ford Motor,2017-11,"Qualcomm signed non-binding agreements worth $12 billion with Xiaomi, OPPO and Vivo, three Chinese handset makers that the firm said it had ""longstanding relationships"" with. Qualcomm already earns more than half of its revenues in China."

Ford Motor,2017-11,"Nov 9 (Reuters) - Workers at a Chinese-owned auto glass plant in southwestern Ohio will finish voting on Thursday on whether to join the United Auto Workers, in a test of the union's strategy for organizing foreign-owned auto factories after a stinging loss in the U.S. Deep South in August."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"The vote, which began on Wednesday, involves roughly 1,500 workers at the Fuyao Glass Industry Group Co Ltd <600660.SS> plant in Moraine, a Dayton suburb that was once home to a large, unionized General Motors Co assembly plant."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"The UAW needs a win after losing a bitterly contested vote at a Nissan Motor Co Ltd <7201.T> plant in Mississippi in August, which extended a decades-long record of failure to organize a major automaker's plant in the U.S. South. [nL1N1KR04I]"
Ford Motor,2017-11,The vote also comes amid an expanding U.S. Justice Department probe into alleged misuse of funds at UAW training centers funded by the Detroit automakers. [nL2N1N8232]

[nL2N1CC2EJ]"
Ford Motor,2017-11,"Though UAW membership has crept up since the end of the Great Recession, it is around half of what it was in 1998 and well below a peak of 1.5 million members in 1979.

Ford Motor,2017-11,{{20171108T235132.213+0000}}LPC: Auto parts maker Chassix seeks fix for struggling dividend loanBy Andrew Berlin
Ford Motor,2017-11,"NEW YORK, Nov 8 (Reuters) - US auto parts manufacturer Chassix is exploring revisions to a US$320m leveraged loan backing a dividend to shareholders, following investors' lack of interest amid concerns over declining earnings, according to three sources familiar with the matter."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"Lead arranger JP Morgan is discussing reducing the size of the loan and the dividend payment and juicing pricing to lure buyers, who are wary of piling debt onto a company that has seen earnings drop since emerging from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection two years ago."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"Chassix's Ebitda, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, dropped 4.7% in 2016 and is projected to fall a further 14.3% this year, two additional sources said. The company is still experiencing a run-off of business from its restructuring that will impact revenues, which are tethered to a cyclical end market."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"""The company exited [bankruptcy] in 2015, and performance is still declining as some business rolls off,"" an investor said. ""They seem to have a good book of business, but this can go away if car sales decline, plus price concessions to original equipment manufacturers are always present."""
Ford Motor,2017-11,"The deal marks Chassix's debut in the US$939bn leveraged loan market. It is the company's first trip to the capital markets since emerging in July 2015 from a four-month stint in bankruptcy court in part precipitated by capacity constraints at its manufacturing plant in Bristol, Indiana that drove losses."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"The company, which supplies chassis and powertrain components to auto manufacturers including General Motors, Ford and FCA, emerged from bankruptcy protection owned by its former bondholders including Cerberus Capital Management and Oaktree Capital Management. Platinum Equity, the private equity firm that owned the company prior to the filing, transferred its equity to the funds as part of the restructuring process."
Ford Motor,2017-11,Chassix did not respond to requests for comment. JP Morgan and spokespersons for Cerberus and Oaktree declined to comment.
Ford Motor,2017-11,"Proceeds from the seven-year term loan, as originally proposed, along with balance sheet cash, were earmarked to fund a US$260m cash distribution to the new owners, repay existing debt and cover fees and expenses. The financing includes a US$125m five-year asset-based revolving credit facility that will be undrawn at close. Investors were expected to commit to the original deal by November 2."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"The company is considering downsizing the loan to US$200m-US$225m, and the dividend by a similar amount, the three sources said. It may also hike pricing to as much as 550bp over Libor, from the 475bp-500bp range at launch in mid-October, and further discount the offering price to 98, from 99, the sources added. There will likely be other structural changes."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"The original deal would have put the company's debt-to Ebitda at 2.3 times, based on US$138m of projected 2017 adjusted Ebitda, compared to roughly 0.4 times currently, according to two of the sources. With a loan of around US$215m, debt-to-Ebitda would drop to 1.6 times."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"Chassix was formed in 2013 through the merger of Diversified Machine Inc and SMW Automotive, LLC."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"The company is rated B2/B by Moody's and Standard & Poor's, respectively, while the proposed loan is rated B3/B."

Ford Motor,2017-11,"HOUSTON/LONDON, Nov 8 (Reuters) - Two decades ago, BP set out to transcend oil, adopting a sunburst logo to convey its plans to pour $8 billion over a decade into renewable technologies, even promising to power its gas stations with the sun."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"That transformation - marketed as ""Beyond Petroleum"" - led to manufacturing solar panels in Australia, Spain and the United States and erecting wind farms in the United States and the Netherlands."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"Today, BP might be more aptly branded ""Back to Petroleum"" after exiting or scaling back its renewable energy investments. Lower-cost Chinese components upended its solar panel business, which the firm shed in 2011. A year later, BP tried to sell its U.S. wind power business but couldn't get a buyer."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"""We made very big bets in the past,"" BP Chief Executive Bob Dudley told Reuters in an interview. ""A lot of those didn't work. We're not sure yet what will be commercially acceptable."""
Ford Motor,2017-11,The costly lesson of the biggest foray yet by an oil major into renewable energy was not lost on rival firms.
Ford Motor,2017-11,Even as governments and environmentalists forecast a peak in oil demand within a generation - and China and India say they may eventually ban gasoline and diesel vehicles - leaders of the world's biggest oil firms are not buying the argument that their traditional business faces any imminent threat.
Ford Motor,2017-11,"A Reuters analysis of clean energy investments and forecasts by oil majors, along with exclusive interviews with top oil executives, reveal mostly token investments in alternative energy. Today, renewable power projects get about 3 percent of $100 billion in combined annual spending by the five biggest oil firms, according to energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"BP, Chevron , Exxon Mobil , Royal Dutch Shell and Total are instead milking their drilling and processing assets to finance investor payouts now and bolster balance sheets for the future. They believe they can enter new energy sectors later by acquiring companies or technologies if and when others prove them profitable."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"""There is no sign of peak demand right now,"" said Chevron CEO John Watson, an economist by training, who is retiring in early 2018. ""For the next 10 or 20 years, we expect to see oil demand growth."""
Ford Motor,2017-11,"The International Energy Agency forecasts a 10 percent rise in oil demand through 2040, reflecting the consensus among oil firms. The earliest estimate for peak oil demand from any oil company is late next decade, by Shell CEO Ben van Beurden."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"History shows energy transitions - from wood to coal to oil - take a long time. Coal's contribution to world energy consumption peaked recently at 28 percent and remains above the share from natural gas, though just below oil's one-third."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"Profit, if any, from the majors' decades-long interest in renewable energy ventures is unclear. None of the largest oil companies disclose earnings from their solar, wind or biofuels ventures."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"Investors such as Alasdair McKinnon, portfolio manager at Scottish Investment Trust, believe oil will sustain shareholders far into the future."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"""There isn't a viable alternative to fossil fuels on the horizon,"" he said. ""We're not buying into the long-term demand destruction for oil."""
Ford Motor,2017-11,"The confidence in oil's future relies largely on rising consumption from emerging economies. Exxon forecasts that transportation will require 25 percent more fuel by 2040, propelled by growth in Asia. Chevron's analysis of the India and Nigeria markets, meanwhile, concludes that infrastructure needed for electric cars is unlikely to be built."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"Cars account for about a fifth of oil consumption, BP estimates. So if electric vehicles do eventually capture mass markets, oil firms would still expect growing demand from the air, rail and trucking industries."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"Natural gas - now a smaller business than oil for most majors - can grow to nearly a quarter of all energy used by displacing coal in power generation and through expanded uses in chemicals, these companies forecast. Natural gas can also fuel the power needed for electric cars."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"Although Shell forecasts peak oil demand coming earlier than its rivals, it is preparing for that prospect mostly with massive natural gas investments. The firm last year spent $54 billion acquiring BG Group, which derives half its production from gas. Chevron, Exxon and Shell recently have spent billions of dollars on new liquefied natural gas projects across the globe."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"Critics of oil majors' cautious renewable strategy - including some big investors - say the firms are being short-sighted in their trust that change will come slow, or that one fossil fuel will gradually replace another. Just as cheap natural gas is supplanting coal, even cheaper wind or solar eventually will displace gas, they argue."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"South Australia is soon to become a proving ground for a project could pave the way for renewable power to supplant fossil fuels for peak electricity - a combined wind farm and grid-scale battery storage facility, by electric-car maker Tesla Inc and operator Windlab Ltd."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"Fossil fuel companies need to quickly reorient themselves to the low returns of the solar and wind industries, said Jules Kortenhorst, a former Shell executive who runs the Rocky Mountain Institute, a nonprofit energy research organization."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"""You cannot flip a switch on a Monday morning from being one to another,"" he said. ""Paychecks in the oil and gas industry are based on fundamentally believing that the world cannot see economic growth without fossil fuels."""
Ford Motor,2017-11,"To achieve the same share of the renewables market that the largest publicly-traded oil companies now hold in oil and gas would require an investment of about $350 billion over the next 18 years, estimates Wood Mackenzie. Such spending would cut into the generous dividends that oil firms' shareholders have come to expect."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"""We think it will be a real challenge for these companies to change their business model,"" said Nathan Fabian, director of policy at Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI), a United Nations-backed group."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"PRI has guidelines calling for investment analysis that weighs environmental, social and governance issues. Its principles have been adopted by investors with $70 trillion in assets under management."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"Oil companies have made relatively modest investments a wide range of renewable technologies. Chevron has a smattering of mostly small wind and solar ventures; Shell invests in sugar-cane ethanol in South America, wind farms in the United States and electric-car charging stations in Europe; and BP still owns the U.S. wind farms it once tried to sell."
Ford Motor,2017-11,John Browne - who as BP's CEO two decades ago helped launch the early investments in renewables - said he still believes the renewable power will grow.
Ford Motor,2017-11,"""It will take time,"" he said in an interview with Reuters last month. ""And they have time."""
Ford Motor,2017-11,"Shell pledged to invest up to $1 billion a year by 2020 in what it calls ""new energies."""
Ford Motor,2017-11,"Total said this year it would spend $500 million annually on developing alternatives. But soon after that announcement, it unveiled its $7.5 billion acquisition of Maersk Oil, part of a plan to pump more crude from Norway's North Sea."
Ford Motor,2017-11,Total CEO Patrick Pouyanne in October explained the focus on economics at an October oil conference in London.
Ford Motor,2017-11,"""When you ask our customers what their priority is, either in developed economies or in emerging countries, price comes first,"" he said. A hasty shift to renewables, he said, ""could bring great economic and social damage to our 6 billion customers."""
Ford Motor,2017-11,"Exxon Mobil is backing research into biofuels, joining with gene modification firm Synthetic Genomics to coax algae to produce more lipids, an oil substitute. It hasn't detailed its investment but said the effort remains far from commercialization. By comparison, Exxon this year spent $5.6 billion on U.S. shale oil assets."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"Some of the oil industry's largest customers are planning a shift to renewable alternatives, especially in transportation, which accounts for about a quarter of annual energy consumption."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"Ford Motor Co earlier this fall disclosed it would aim, by 2030, to derive a third of its sales from battery-powered cars and another third from gas-electric hybrids. [nL4N1ME3GX]"
Ford Motor,2017-11,"A startup backed by Boeing Co and JetBlue Airways Corp recently announced plans for a small hybrid jet by 2022, using batteries from Tesla and battery supplier Panasonic Corp <6752.T>. [nL2N1MG1HZ]"
Ford Motor,2017-11,Yet oil firms continue to forecast aggressive growth in liquid fuels. Exxon predicts 90 percent of the transportation industry will rely on petroleum through 2040.
Ford Motor,2017-11,"BP projects the world's auto fleet doubling to 1.8 billion vehicles by 2035, with only 75 million of those powered by electricity."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"""We'll see if (electric cars) can be delivered in a way that doesn't require large subsidies"" from governments, Chevron's Watson told Reuters. ""That's what we're seeing now."""

Ford Motor,2017-11,{{20171108T060002.732+0000}}INSIGHT-Peak oil? Majors aren't buying into the threat from renewablesBy Ernest Scheyder and Ron Bousso
Ford Motor,2017-11,"HOUSTON/LONDON, Nov 8 (Reuters) - Two decades ago, BP set out to transcend oil, adopting a sunburst logo to convey its plans to pour $8 billion over a decade into renewable technologies, even promising to power its gas stations with the sun."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"That transformation - marketed as ""Beyond Petroleum"" - led to manufacturing solar panels in Australia, Spain and the United States and erecting wind farms in the United States and the Netherlands."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"Today, BP might be more aptly branded ""Back to Petroleum"" after exiting or scaling back its renewable energy investments. Lower-cost Chinese components upended its solar panel business, which the firm shed in 2011. A year later, BP tried to sell its U.S. wind power business but couldn't get a buyer."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"""We made very big bets in the past,"" BP Chief Executive Bob Dudley told Reuters in an interview. ""A lot of those didn't work. We're not sure yet what will be commercially acceptable."""
Ford Motor,2017-11,The costly lesson of the biggest foray yet by an oil major into renewable energy was not lost on rival firms.
Ford Motor,2017-11,Even as governments and environmentalists forecast a peak in oil demand within a generation - and China and India say they may eventually ban gasoline and diesel vehicles - leaders of the world's biggest oil firms are not buying the argument that their traditional business faces any imminent threat.
Ford Motor,2017-11,"A Reuters analysis of clean energy investments and forecasts by oil majors, along with exclusive interviews with top oil executives, reveal mostly token investments in alternative energy. Today, renewable power projects get about 3 percent of $100 billion in combined annual spending by the five biggest oil firms, according to energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"BP, Chevron , Exxon Mobil , Royal Dutch Shell and Total are instead milking their drilling and processing assets to finance investor payouts now and bolster balance sheets for the future. They believe they can enter new energy sectors later by acquiring companies or technologies if and when others prove them profitable."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"""There is no sign of peak demand right now,"" said Chevron CEO John Watson, an economist by training, who is retiring in early 2018. ""For the next 10 or 20 years, we expect to see oil demand growth."""
Ford Motor,2017-11,"The International Energy Agency forecasts a 10 percent rise in oil demand through 2040, reflecting the consensus among oil firms. The earliest estimate for peak oil demand from any oil company is late next decade, by Shell CEO Ben van Beurden."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"History shows energy transitions - from wood to coal to oil - take a long time. Coal's contribution to world energy consumption peaked recently at 28 percent and remains above the share from natural gas, though just below oil's one-third."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"Profit, if any, from the majors' decades-long interest in renewable energy ventures is unclear. None of the largest oil companies disclose earnings from their solar, wind or biofuels ventures."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"Investors such as Alasdair McKinnon, portfolio manager at Scottish Investment Trust, believe oil will sustain shareholders far into the future."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"""There isn't a viable alternative to fossil fuels on the horizon,"" he said. ""We're not buying into the long-term demand destruction for oil."""
Ford Motor,2017-11,"The confidence in oil's future relies largely on rising consumption from emerging economies. Exxon forecasts that transportation will require 25 percent more fuel by 2040, propelled by growth in Asia. Chevron's analysis of the India and Nigeria markets, meanwhile, concludes that infrastructure needed for electric cars is unlikely to be built."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"Cars account for about a fifth of oil consumption, BP estimates. So if electric vehicles do eventually capture mass markets, oil firms would still expect growing demand from the air, rail and trucking industries."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"Natural gas - now a smaller business than oil for most majors - can grow to nearly a quarter of all energy used by displacing coal in power generation and through expanded uses in chemicals, these companies forecast. Natural gas can also fuel the power needed for electric cars."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"Although Shell forecasts peak oil demand coming earlier than its rivals, it is preparing for that prospect mostly with massive natural gas investments. The firm last year spent $54 billion acquiring BG Group, which derives half its production from gas. Chevron, Exxon and Shell recently have spent billions of dollars on new liquefied natural gas projects across the globe."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"Critics of oil majors' cautious renewable strategy - including some big investors - say the firms are being short-sighted in their trust that change will come slow, or that one fossil fuel will gradually replace another. Just as cheap natural gas is supplanting coal, even cheaper wind or solar eventually will displace gas, they argue."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"South Australia is soon to become a proving ground for a project could pave the way for renewable power to supplant fossil fuels for peak electricity - a combined wind farm and grid-scale battery storage facility, by electric-car maker Tesla Inc and operator Windlab Ltd."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"Fossil fuel companies need to quickly reorient themselves to the low returns of the solar and wind industries, said Jules Kortenhorst, a former Shell executive who runs the Rocky Mountain Institute, a nonprofit energy research organization."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"""You cannot flip a switch on a Monday morning from being one to another,"" he said. ""Paychecks in the oil and gas industry are based on fundamentally believing that the world cannot see economic growth without fossil fuels."""
Ford Motor,2017-11,"To achieve the same share of the renewables market that the largest publicly-traded oil companies now hold in oil and gas would require an investment of about $350 billion over the next 18 years, estimates consultancy Wood Mackenzie. Such spending would cut into the generous dividends that oil firms' shareholders have come to expect."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"""We think it will be a real challenge for these companies to change their business model,"" said Nathan Fabian, director of policy at Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI), a United Nations-backed group."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"PRI has guidelines calling for investment analysis that weighs environmental, social and governance issues. Its principles have been adopted by investors with $70 trillion in assets under management."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"Oil companies have made relatively modest investments a wide range of renewable technologies. Chevron has a smattering of mostly small wind and solar ventures; Shell invests in sugar-cane ethanol in South America, wind farms in the United States and electric-car charging stations in Europe; and BP still owns the U.S. wind farms it once tried to sell."
Ford Motor,2017-11,John Browne - who as BP's CEO two decades ago helped launch the early investments in renewables - said he still believes the renewable power will grow.
Ford Motor,2017-11,"""It will take time,"" he said in an interview with Reuters last month. ""And they have time."""
Ford Motor,2017-11,"Shell pledged to invest up to $1 billion a year by 2020 in what it calls ""new energies."""
Ford Motor,2017-11,"Total said this year it would spend $500 million annually on developing alternatives. But soon after that announcement, it unveiled its $7.5 billion acquisition of Maersk Oil, part of a plan to pump more crude from Norway's North Sea."
Ford Motor,2017-11,Total CEO Patrick Pouyanne in October explained the focus on economics at an October oil conference in London.
Ford Motor,2017-11,"""When you ask our customers what their priority is, either in developed economies or in emerging countries, price comes first,"" he said. A hasty shift to renewables, he said, ""could bring great economic and social damage to our 6 billion customers."""
Ford Motor,2017-11,"Exxon Mobil is backing research into biofuels, joining with gene modification firm Synthetic Genomics to coax algae to produce more lipids, an oil substitute. It hasn't detailed its investment but said the effort remains far from commercialization. By comparison, Exxon this year spent $5.6 billion on U.S. shale oil assets."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"Some of the oil industry's largest customers are planning a shift to renewable alternatives, especially in transportation, which accounts for about a quarter of annual energy consumption."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"Ford Motor Co earlier this fall disclosed it would aim, by 2030, to derive a third of its sales from battery-powered cars and another third from gas-electric hybrids. [nL4N1ME3GX]"
Ford Motor,2017-11,"A startup backed by Boeing Co and JetBlue Airways Corp recently announced plans for a small hybrid jet by 2022, using batteries from Tesla and battery supplier Panasonic Corp <6752.T>. [nL2N1MG1HZ]"
Ford Motor,2017-11,Yet oil firms continue to forecast aggressive growth in liquid fuels. Exxon predicts 90 percent of the transportation industry will rely on petroleum through 2040.
Ford Motor,2017-11,"BP projects the world's auto fleet doubling to 1.8 billion vehicles by 2035, with only 75 million of those powered by electricity."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"""We'll see if (electric cars) can be delivered in a way that doesn't require large subsidies"" from governments, Chevron's Watson told Reuters. ""That's what we're seeing now."""

Ford Motor,2017-11,{{20171101T193642.833+0000}}Luxury auto brands are scrambling to avoid a Blue U.S. ChristmasBy Nick Carey
Ford Motor,2017-11,"DETROIT, Nov 1 (Reuters) - When financial markets surge to new records, sales of luxury cars usually rise, too. Instead, October U.S. auto sales reports on Wednesday showed that a collapse in sales of luxury sedans is accelerating."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"Consumers have gradually shifted over to luxury sport utility vehicles from sedans in the last decade, but the trend - which has occurred in both the non-luxury and luxury segments of the auto market - was particularly pronounced in October."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"Sales of Daimler AG's Mercedes-Benz S-Class, long a global benchmark for large, premium sedans, plunged 49 percent in October, and are down 24.8 percent for the year to date. General Motors Co's Cadillac brand said it sold just 779 of its CTS sedans in October. Demand for that car, designed to compete with German luxury sedans, is down nearly 33 percent for the year."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"Cadillac's best-selling model this year is the XT5 compact SUV, which has more than doubled sales from a year ago."
Ford Motor,2017-11,The shift within the luxury vehicle market away from sedans toward SUVs of all sizes is forcing some of the most prestigious brands to scramble to add SUV models to their lineups or boost SUV production to meet demand.
Ford Motor,2017-11,"""In the short term, there will be pressure to add (consumer) incentives, cut production or both,"" said Cox Automotive analyst Michelle Krebs. ""And we just don't see an end in sight to this trend."""
Ford Motor,2017-11,"According to Kelley Blue Book data, in 2007 luxury sedans made up 7.6 percent of U.S. new vehicle sales, while luxury SUVs made up 4.2 percent. Through September this year, luxury SUVs made up just over 7 percent of the market, compared with 4.9 percent for luxury sedans."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"In the short term, luxury brands could use holiday season sales promotions to clear slow-selling sedans off dealer lots, analysts said. Toyota Motor Corp's <7203.T> Lexus brand said on Wednesday it will launch its ""December to Remember"" year-end sales promotion for the 18th straight year."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"Longer-term, luxury car makers have to restructure their model lineups, which have for decades reflected conventional thinking that the ""flagship"" of a luxury vehicle brand is a big sedan."
Ford Motor,2017-11,Industry executives and analysts said luxury brands will launch more SUVs. BMW AG and Mercedes-Benz are both expanding their U.S. sport utility vehicle plants.

Ford Motor,2017-11,"The automotive industry has been heralded as a manufacturing success story by the government, with production reaching a 17-year high in 2016 and the sector employing over 800,000 people."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"But the overwhelmingly foreign-owned industry, dominated by Indian's Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) and Japan's Nissan <7201.T>, is worried Brexit will add tariffs and customs checks to its exports, risking the viability of plants."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"BMW's board member for sales Ian Robertson, Aston Martin Chief Financial Officer Mark Wilson, JLR Chief Executive Ralf Speth, McLaren Auomotive Chief Executive Mike Flewitt and Bentley boss Wolfgang Duerheimer were among those invited to meet May at her office on Wednesday."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"""The meeting focused on our members' Brexit priorities - in particular, the urgent need for clarity on the proposed transition agreement as business needs certainty to invest,"" the trade body, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, said in a statement."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"Executives highlighted the importance of frictionless future customs arrangements, the need to maintain a common certification system with the European Union and access to European labour, a source present in the room told Reuters."
Ford Motor,2017-11,The source said May and business minister Greg Clark did not offer guarantees but were aware of the issues at hand.
Ford Motor,2017-11,"""They can't make commitments because the negotiations aren't done,"" the source said when asked about what May said. ""They understood and recognise it."""

Ford Motor,2017-11,"CHICAGO, Nov 1 (Reuters) - U.S. winter wheat acreage for harvest in 2018 could shrink further from 2017's 108-year low as poor returns deterred farmers from planting the crop this autumn and excessive rains disrupted the plans of those that did."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"While the world is awash in wheat, U.S. production fell to a 15-year low in 2017 and the high-quality wheat grown in parts of the country remains vulnerable to shortages. A drought this year in key growing areas sent spring wheat futures soaring."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"Gary Millershaski, who farms in west-central Kansas, is cutting the percentage of his acres devoted to wheat, even though he has added more land."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"""There's just not the money in it,"" Millershaski said. ""Years ago, we used to be straight 50 percent wheat,"" he said, adding that wheat only makes up 38 to 40 percent of his current acreage."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"Kansas is the biggest wheat producer of all the states but its winter wheat acres could fall as much as 10 percent from a year ago, said Justin Gilpin, chief executive officer of the Kansas Wheat Commission."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"Oklahoma, the No. 3 winter wheat producer this year, could see a similar reduction, said Kim Anderson, an agricultural economist at Oklahoma State University."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"""The one thing that would be a welcome surprise is if we had no drop. Generally the consensus is we will have some amount of lower wheat seeding,"" said Dan O'Brien, a Kansas State University agricultural economist."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"In central Kansas, cash prices for wheat are $3.20 to $3.40 per bushel - below the cost of production for some growers, O'Brien said, as plentiful global supplies eat into U.S. exports and keep overall prices under pressure."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"Many farmers in the Plains have shifted acres to more profitable crops such as corn, soybeans and cotton, and that trend is likely to continue in 2018, the economists said."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"In Kansas, farmers planted 5.5 million acres (2.2 million hectares) of corn in 2017, the most since the 1930s, and a record-high 5.15 million acres of soybeans. Wheat plantings fell to 7.6 million acres, the second lowest acreage in U.S. Department of Agriculture records dating back to 1919."
Ford Motor,2017-11,"On top of the poor economics, farmers have had to contend with heavy rains that left fields too muddy to use the heavy equipment used to plant wheat and harvest corn and soy.

Ford Motor,2017-11,"For Millershaski, the heavy rains pushed back planting by about three weeks, until mid-October. Then, worried the wheat would not have time to develop enough before winter, he planted about 60 to 65 pounds (27-30 kg) of seed per acre, compared with his normal rate of about 35 pounds."
