Exxon,2017-11,"{{20171130T082755.000+0000}}UPDATE 9-OPEC, Russia agree oil cut extension to end of 2018VIENNA, Nov 30 (Reuters)"
Exxon,2017-11,"VIENNA, Nov 30 (Reuters) - OPEC and non-OPEC producers led by Russia agreed on Thursday to extend oil output cuts until the end of 2018 as they try to finish clearing a global glut of crude while signalling a possible early exit from the deal if the market overheats."
Exxon,2017-11,"Russia, which this year reduced production significantly with OPEC for the first time, has been pushing for a clear message on how to exit the cuts so the market doesn't flip into a deficit too soon, prices don't rally too fast and rival U.S. shale firms don't boost output further."
Exxon,2017-11,"Russia needs much lower oil prices to balance its budget than OPEC's leader Saudi Arabia, which is preparing a stock market listing for national energy champion Aramco next year and would hence benefit from pricier crude."
Exxon,2017-11,"The producers' current deal, under which they are cutting supply by about 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) in an effort to boost oil prices, expires in March."
Exxon,2017-11,"Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih told reporters the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and non-OPEC allies had agreed to extend the cuts by nine months until the end of 2018, as largely anticipated by the market."
Exxon,2017-11,OPEC also decided to cap the combined output of Nigeria and Libya at 2017 levels below 2.8 million bpd. Both countries have been exempt from cuts due to unrest and lower-than-normal production.
Exxon,2017-11,Falih said it was premature to talk about exiting the cuts at least for a couple of quarters as the world was entering a season of low winter demand. He added that OPEC would examine progress at its next regular meeting in June.
Exxon,2017-11,"""When we get to an exit, we are going to do it very gradually ... to make sure we don't shock the market,"" he said."
Exxon,2017-11,"OPEC and Russia together produce over 40 percent of global oil. Moscow's first real cooperation with OPEC, put together with the help of President Vladimir Putin, has been crucial in roughly halving an excess of global oil stocks since January."
Exxon,2017-11,"With oil prices rising above $60, Russia has expressed concerns that an extension for the whole of 2018 could prompt a spike in crude production in the United States, which is not participating in the deal."
Exxon,2017-11,A joint OPEC and non-OPEC communique said the next meeting in June 2018 would present an opportunity to adjust the agreement based on market conditions.
Exxon,2017-11,"The Iraqi, Iranian and Angolan oil ministers also said before Thursday's meetings that a review of the deal was possible in June in case the market became too tight."
Exxon,2017-11,International benchmark Brent crude rose around 0.5 percent on Thursday to trade above $63 per barrel.
Exxon,2017-11,"Just as OPEC gathered in Vienna, U.S. government data showed that U.S. oil production rose 3 percent in September to 9.48 million bpd. [nEMNHBT0SD] But Falih said OPEC ""won't be quick on the trigger"" to react to short-term U.S. output spikes."
Exxon,2017-11,"U.S. shale oil producers, which effectively triggered the global oil glut of recent years, have been adjusting their message over the past year, switching away from combative language with regard to OPEC actions."
Exxon,2017-11,"""If producers in the U.S. increase their rig count over the next few months due to higher prices then I expect another price collapse by the end of 2018,"" said Scott Sheffield, executive chairman of Pioneer Natural Resources Co , one of the largest producers in the Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico, the largest U.S. oilfield."
Exxon,2017-11,"""I hope that all U.S. shale companies will maintain their current rig counts and use all excess cash flow to increase dividends back to their shareholders,"" he told Reuters."
Exxon,2017-11,"Gary Ross, a veteran OPEC watcher and founder of Pira consultancy, said the market could surprise on the upside with Brent rising to $70 if there were a major supply disruption."
Exxon,2017-11,"""Everywhere you look there is an ever-present risk to supply,"" Ross said."
Exxon,2017-11,"""In Iraq's Kurdistan there is a major risk to oil exports because of tensions with Baghdad, in Libya militias are still fighting, in Nigeria the risks of disruptions are significant, Venezuela is on the verge of default, Iran could again face U.S. financial sanctions and even in Saudi Arabia political risk is on the rise,"" Ross added."
Exxon,2017-11,"The production cuts have been in place since the start of 2017 and helped halve an excess of global oil stocks although those remain at 140 million barrels above the five-year average, according to OPEC."
Exxon,2017-11,"Russia has signalled it wants to understand better how producers will exit from the cuts as it needs to provide guidance to its private and state energy companies. On Thursday, Novak said all companies were on board with the latest limits."

Exxon,2017-11,"VIENNA, Nov 30 (Reuters) - OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers will agree at a meeting on Thursday to extend an output-cutting deal until the end of 2018, four sources familiar with the matter said."
Exxon,2017-11,"The producers' current deal, under which they are cutting supply by about 1.8 million barrels per day in an effort to boost oil prices, expires in March."
Exxon,2017-11,"""They will agree on the nine months,"" an OPEC delegate said, adding that the meeting, due to start around 0900 GMT, was expected to be smooth."
Exxon,2017-11,"A second source said: ""No surprises ... all are for nine months."""
Exxon,2017-11,The 14-member Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and Russia have signalled that they may review any extension of the deal when they meet again in June if the market overheats.
Exxon,2017-11,"With oil prices rallying above $60 per barrel, some are concerned that such an extension could prompt a spike in crude production in the United States, which is not participating in the deal."

Exxon,2017-11,"VIENNA, Nov 29 (Reuters) - OPEC and Russia look set to prolong oil supply cuts until the end of 2018 this week while signalling that they may review the deal when they meet again in June if the market overheats."
Exxon,2017-11,"With oil prices rallying above $60 per barrel, Russia has questioned the wisdom of extending existing cuts of 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) until the end of next year as such a move could prompt a spike in U.S. production."

Exxon,2017-11,"Six ministers from OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers including Saudi Arabia and Russia met in Vienna on Wednesday - one day ahead of a full OPEC gathering - and recommended extending the cuts to the end of 2018. At present, the cuts expire in March."
Exxon,2017-11,"""That's one of the recommendations,"" Kuwait's Oil Minister Essam al-Marzouq told reporters when asked whether the committee had agreed on a nine-month extension, among other matters."
Exxon,2017-11,"Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak was, however, less certain about the duration."
Exxon,2017-11,"""The market has not been fully balanced yet. Joint efforts are needed after April 1. Everybody has recommended that the agreement could be extended and tomorrow such concrete details will be discussed,"" Novak said."
Exxon,2017-11,Several sources familiar with the talks have said Russia had suggested an option of reviewing the deal at the next OPEC meeting in June in case the oil market overheats.
Exxon,2017-11,"""In reality it would be only a three-month true extension with the review in June,"" said Olivier Jakob from Petromatrix consultancy."
Exxon,2017-11,Benchmark Brent and U.S. crude prices fell for a third consecutive session on Wednesday but Brent still traded above $63 per barrel. [O/R]
Exxon,2017-11,Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih told the monitoring meeting on Wednesday that cuts needed to be extended as the rebalancing of oil markets was not yet complete.
Exxon,2017-11,"Iranian oil minister Bijan Zanganeh, who fought Falih on many previous occasions, said he would agree with extending cuts by either six or nine months to help the market rebalance."
Exxon,2017-11,"Novak told reporters after meeting Falih: ""We understand that we need to take further steps to rebalance the market ... We have a common understanding (with Falih)."""
Exxon,2017-11,Amrita Sen from consultancy Energy Aspects said she believed the debate between Saudi Arabia and Russia was about timings rather than substance.
Exxon,2017-11,"""Saudi Arabia believes it is too early to discuss an exit strategy as the market rebalancing job hasn't been done yet. Russia would like to do it sooner ... OPEC has surprised on the upside during its past three meetings and delivered more than the market had expected,"" she said."
Exxon,2017-11,"Two sources familiar with OPEC talks said the group may debate capping Nigerian and Libyan output at 1.8 million bpd and 1 million bpd respectively, having exempted the two countries so far due to unrest and lower-than-normal production volumes."
Exxon,2017-11,"The production cuts have been in place since the start of 2017 and helped halve an excess of global oil stocks although those remain at 140 million barrels above the five-year average, according to OPEC."

Exxon,2017-11,"""It is important ... to work out a strategy which we will follow from April 2018,"" Novak told the monitoring committee."
Exxon,2017-11,Iraqi Oil Minister Jabar al-Luaibi said there had been little discussion so far on any exit strategy.
Exxon,2017-11,"Some Russian producers including Rosneft, run by an ally of President Vladimir Putin, Igor Sechin, have questioned the rationale of prolonging the cuts, saying it will lead to a loss of market share to U.S. firms, which are not reducing output."
Exxon,2017-11,"OPEC, which comprises 14 countries, has traditionally been much less worried about exit strategies as its members have been known for reducing compliance and cheating on their quotas towards the expiry of such deals."
Exxon,2017-11,"""Russia seems to be pushing OPEC to have a concrete plan to phase out the cuts when appropriate ... compared to the typical undisciplined OPEC strategy,"" U.S. bank Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co, which is active in the shale industry, said."

Exxon,2017-11,{{20171129T165326.586+0000}}Exxon nears deal to explore for oil and gas offshore MauritaniaBy Edward McAllister
Exxon,2017-11,"DAKAR, Nov 29 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil is close to signing a deal to explore for oil and gas offshore Mauritania, its first foray into the West African country, Mauritania's oil, energy and mines director said on Wednesday."
Exxon,2017-11,"An Exxon Mobil spokeswoman declined to comment on the deal, but said the Texas-based company does not yet have drilling activities in Mauritania."
Exxon,2017-11,"Interest has surged in oil and gas fields offshore of Mauritania and neighbour Senegal since big discoveries by Cairn Energy and Kosmos Energy , the latter now partnered with BP, in separate projects over the last three years. Both are expected to start production early next decade."
Exxon,2017-11,London-based BP is already developing a major gas project and France's Total has bought into several exploration licences in both countries.
Exxon,2017-11,"""We have agreed on the terms of three blocks,"" Moustapha Bechir, Mauritania's director general of oil, energy and mines told Reuters on the sidelines of an Oil & Gas Council conference in Dakar. He said they and Exxon had yet to formally sign the deal, but would do soon."
Exxon,2017-11,"Experts describe the deep waters there as the next big frontier in energy drilling, though the true size of the deposits is not yet known. BP next year plans to make a final investment decision on a liquefied natural gas (LNG) project that would ship West African gas worldwide."
Exxon,2017-11,"Long overlooked by firms more focused on massive deposits in the Gulf of Guinea further south, Senegal's and Mauritania's oil and gas was discovered by new technology that has given companies a better idea of what lies under the sea bed."
Exxon,2017-11,"Now, specialist firms are trawling the deep waters making seismic tests to determine what is below. Oil service companies such as Baker Hughes, now part of General Electric , Schlumberger, and others are lining up to team up with oil producers to develop the resources."
Exxon,2017-11,"Governments in less developed areas south of Senegal and Mauritania's deposits, including Gambia, Guinea Bissau and Guinea, are also trying to coax oil companies in the hope that they can emulate the interest."
Exxon,2017-11,"Gambia is marketing oil blocks in its thin sliver of territorial water, while Guinea has started to drill offshore."
Exxon,2017-11,"Guinea Bissau plans to drill its first deep offshore well next year, Celedonio Vieira, the director of marketing and business development at state-run PetroGuin, told Reuters."
Exxon,2017-11,"""We are optimistic because of the success in Senegal,"" he said."

Exxon,2017-11,* June review would be perceived as shorter extension of cuts
Exxon,2017-11,"VIENNA, Nov 28 (Reuters) - OPEC and Russia are heading towards prolonging their oil supply cuts for the whole of 2018 but with an option to review the deal in June, OPEC sources said on Tuesday after Moscow expressed concerns the market could overheat."
Exxon,2017-11,"The recommendation was made by a joint committee of OPEC and non-OPEC delegates including Russia but has yet to be approved by the ministers from the committee on Wednesday and then by a full OPEC meeting on Thursday, two OPEC sources said."
Exxon,2017-11,"Oil prices deepened their two-day decline on the news, which the market could perceive as an extension of production cuts by just three months until June 2018 rather than a full year."
Exxon,2017-11,"The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia and nine other producers are cutting crude output by about 1.8 million barrels per day until March 2018, and on Thursday their oil ministers will discuss extending the deal."
Exxon,2017-11,"""It will not be an easy meeting and we always look at various scenarios,"" United Arab Emirates Energy Minister Suhail bin Mohammed al-Mazroui said on Tuesday in Dubai. Upon arrival in Vienna, he said cutting output through the whole of 2018 was still the main scenario but not the only one."
Exxon,2017-11,"The market had largely expected OPEC to prolong the cuts until the end of 2018 to prop up prices and clear an excess of global stocks, but doubts have emerged in the last few days."
Exxon,2017-11,"OPEC's leader, Saudi Arabia, has signalled that it wants oil to trade at about $60 a barrel as the kingdom prepares to list shares in national oil champion Aramco and fights a large fiscal deficit."
Exxon,2017-11,"The Russian government also wants high oil prices ahead of a presidential election in March 2018. But officials in Moscow have voiced worries about pricier oil boosting the rouble, which could undermine the competitiveness of Russia's economy."
Exxon,2017-11,"U.S. producers aggressively hedged their future production as oil recently rallied , raising fears of another spike in shale output in the United States, which is not participating in the global production curbs."
Exxon,2017-11,"""Russia is on board for the extension,"" one of the OPEC sources said following the committee meeting."
Exxon,2017-11,"Goldman Sachs, one of the most active banks in commodity trading and oil producer hedging, said on Tuesday in a note the outcome of the OPEC meeting was uncertain as Brent oil had risen above $63 per barrel."
Exxon,2017-11,"""The push for a nine-month extension, four months before the cuts end and given an accelerating rebalancing further stands in the face of prior comments that the cuts should remain data-dependent to assess their effectiveness,"" the U.S. bank said."
Exxon,2017-11,"Citi, one of Goldman's main rivals, said it expected major producers to end production cuts sooner rather than later."
Exxon,2017-11,"""OPEC and Russia will both realise they are losing market share and they will be better off going back to a more competitive environment,"" the head of commodity research at Citi, Ed Morse, told Reuters."
Exxon,2017-11,Goldman said oil might fall further this week as the market had priced in a nine-month extension.
Exxon,2017-11,"""We continue to expect a gradual ramp up in OPEC and Russian production from April onward,"" Goldman said, adding ""as a result, the announcement of an only six-month extension would still initially appear bullish relative to our expectation""."
Exxon,2017-11,"On Friday, Russia said it was ready to support extending the output-cutting deal but had still to decide on the duration."
Exxon,2017-11,"On Monday, Reuters reported that a major Russian production project led by Exxon Mobil was preparing to ramp up output by a quarter from next year. [nL3N1NX3T4]"
Exxon,2017-11,The project is not subject to the global output-cutting deal but the development would signal an obstacle to Russia's efforts on production curtailment.
Exxon,2017-11,"The Exxon project involves Rosneft, the Kremlin-owned state producer whose boss Igor Sechin, a close ally of President Vladimir Putin, has long been a critic of Moscow's deal with the 14-country OPEC."
Exxon,2017-11,Sources close to talks between OPEC and Russia told Reuters Moscow wanted to fine-tune the language of the deal to include an option to review the agreement if global stocks fell steeply.
Exxon,2017-11,"The supply pact is aimed at reducing oil stocks in industrialised countries to their five-year average. The latest figures suggest OPEC is more than halfway there, with OPEC sources saying the target could be reached after June 2018."

Exxon,2017-11,"Huffaker declined to discuss the status of specific units at the Beaumont refinery, but said Exxon continues to meet its contractual commitments."
Exxon,2017-11,Traders said prices for sweet and sour crude oil grades were unchanged on Tuesday morning following news of the fire.

Exxon,2017-11,"OSLO, Nov 28 (Reuters) - Norway's $1-trillion sovereign wealth fund may take five years to reduce its investments in energy companies even once the policy is adopted, the fund's CEO said on Tuesday."
Exxon,2017-11,"The world's largest sovereign wealth fund this month proposed dropping oil and gas companies from its benchmark equity index, which would mean cutting its investments in such businesses over time. [nL8N1NM4UW]"
Exxon,2017-11,"The aim is to lessen the impact of a permanent drop in oil prices on the Norwegian government's wealth, especially when the fund is increasing its exposure to equities to 70 percent of its value from 60 percent. The news hit energy stocks when announced. [nL8N1NM4UW] [nL8N1NM4HN]."
Exxon,2017-11,"It must first be reviewed by the finance ministry, which has said it would come back with its opinion in autumn 2018. If the ministry backs the proposal, parliament could vote on it only in June 2019 at the earliest. [nO9N1ML02E]"
Exxon,2017-11,"From that point, there will be another few years before the fund completes the process, said fund CEO Yngve Slyngstad."
Exxon,2017-11,"""Typically our transition period will be two, three, five years, depending on the issue,"" he told reporters on Tuesday. ""The fund will be invested in oil stocks for many years."""
Exxon,2017-11,"Still, if it does go ahead, the fund would divest billions of dollars from oil and gas stocks, as defined by the FTSE oil and gas reference index <.TFTAWORLDS0001U>."
Exxon,2017-11,These stocks represent 6 percent - or around $37 billion - of the fund's benchmark equity index.
Exxon,2017-11,"""It will clearly reduce the exposure to the (oil and gas) sector and we will potentially exit the sector,"" said Slyngstad."
Exxon,2017-11,"The fund invests Norway's revenues from oil and gas production for future generations, investing in equities, bonds and real estate abroad. Its size is equivalent to $192,000 for every Norwegian man, woman and child."
Exxon,2017-11,"The fund's analysis shows there is a link between the oil price level and the return from oil and gas stocks, a link that is much more pronounced than for any other sector."
Exxon,2017-11,Slyngstad reiterated on Tuesday the proposal did not reflect a particular view of future movement in oil prices or the profitability or sustainability of the oil and gas sector.
Exxon,2017-11,"It is purely based on financial arguments and as a way to reduce the exposure to oil of the Norwegian state's wealth, which has grown over the past decade, he said."
Exxon,2017-11,Norway has its own separate exposure to the energy market through untapped offshore hydrocarbon reserves as Western Europe's largest oil and gas producer.
Exxon,2017-11,"In addition, Norway holds a 67-percent stake in the national oil company, Statoil ."
Exxon,2017-11,"Slyngstad said there would still be opportunities to invest as companies undergo an ""energy transition"" to less fossil-fuel-intensive models."
Exxon,2017-11,"""Most investors would say we will be in an energy transition for the next 30 years and that energy transition will have opportunities for investors,"" he said."

Exxon,2017-11,"NEW DELHI/SINGAPORE/MOSCOW, Nov 27 (Reuters) - Oil output from Russia's Far Eastern Sakhalin-1 project is set to rise by about a quarter from January, sources with knowledge of the plan said, signalling Moscow may find it hard to comply with output cuts in tandem with OPEC for the whole of next year."
Exxon,2017-11,"Russia and the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries will meet in Vienna on Thursday to discuss an extension of the pact to curb output, possibly by another nine months until the end of 2018. [nL1N1NU1D9][nL8N1NU3GA]"
Exxon,2017-11,"The Sakhalin-1 project, operated by U.S. oil giant Exxon Mobil off the coast of Sakhalin, currently produces about 200,000 bpd. As a production sharing agreement (PSA) with the Russian state, it is excluded from any output curbs."
Exxon,2017-11,"The project also involves the Kremlin state oil major Rosneft , whose boss Igor Sechin, a close ally of President Vladimir Putin, has long been one of the main critics of Moscow's deal with OPEC."
Exxon,2017-11,"""From January, total oil production from Sakhalin-1 and a small stream from Rosneft's separate block will be about 250,000 bpd,"" said one of the sources."
Exxon,2017-11,"A second source said production would increase to 260,000 bpd in the March quarter from about 190,000 bpd in 2017. A third source said output would rise to more than more than 250,000 bpd."
Exxon,2017-11,None of the sources wanted to be identified due to the sensitivity of the issue. Exxon and Rosneft did not reply to a request for comment. Indian partner ONGC Videsh declined to comment.
Exxon,2017-11,"Production at Sakhalin-1 has been fluctuating at below 200,000 bpd for many years before the group began to explore a third deposit, Arkutin Dagi, in 2015."
Exxon,2017-11,"""We are discussing it today with the energy ministry. We have such an option (of output increases), which we didn't have before. It is because of the new deposit,"" Masao Fujita, president of Sodeco, a fourth Japanese partner in the consortium, told Reuters in Moscow."
Exxon,2017-11,"Rosneft and Exxon have long been trying to develop closer ties, including via drilling in the Arctic. But the plan was shelved after the United States imposed sanctions on Rosneft for Russian actions in Ukraine."
Exxon,2017-11,The Sakhalin project is exempt from sanctions because it dates back to the early 1990s.
Exxon,2017-11,"In the meantime, the joint venture has opted to ""front load"" production and may cut it later if government permission is not granted to keep the annual average intact, the third source said."
Exxon,2017-11,"OPEC, Russia and several other major producers have cut their combined output by about 1.8 million barrels per day since January to reduce bloated inventories and boost oil prices."
Exxon,2017-11,Moscow has said it was ready to support extending a deal but has sent mixed signals about the duration of the extension with some ministers arguing the oil rally could lead to an overly strong rouble and undermine the competitiveness of the economy.
Exxon,2017-11,"Russia's oil-dependent economy grew an annual 1.8 percent in the September quarter, slowing from 2.5 percent in the second quarter. [nL8N1NT1VC]"
Exxon,2017-11,"Under the current deal that ends in March, Russia agreed to cut output by 300,000 bpd from its level in October 2016."
Exxon,2017-11,"""Russia may have to cut output from other fields to compensate for a rise in output from Sakhalin-1. It is in Russia's interest to comply with deal to keep oil prices high,"" said Ehsan Ul-Haq, director of crude oil and refined products at consultancy Resource Economist."
Exxon,2017-11,Goldman Sachs said on Tuesday an OPEC supply cut extension by a nine months was far from guaranteed given that some members including Russia were having concerns about the market overheating.
Exxon,2017-11,"""We continue to expect a gradual ramp up in OPEC and Russian production from April onward,"" Goldman said."

Exxon,2017-11,"For the last decade, smaller oil companies have led the way in shale technology, slashing costs by as much as half with breakthroughs such as horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracking that turned the United States into the world's fastest-growing energy exporter."
Exxon,2017-11,"Now, oil majors that were slow to seize on shale are seeking further efficiencies by adapting technologies for highly automated offshore operations to shale and pursuing advances in digitalization that have reshaped industries from auto manufacturing to retail."

Exxon,2017-11,"DUBAI, Nov 28 (Reuters) - Petrochemical producer Saudi Basic Industries Corp (SABIC) plans to spend between $3 and $10 billion on acquisitions over the next five years in specialties and agri-nutrients, chief executive Yousef al-Benyan said on Tuesday."
Exxon,2017-11,"The group was already looking at two producers of speciality plastics with operations in Europe, the Middle East and China - and could reach a decision on them by the second quarter of 2018, Benyan told Reuters in an interview."
Exxon,2017-11,"SABIC <2010.SE>, was also looking for ways to expand its agri-nutrients operations in Africa and South America, he added. The sector produces chemicals used in fertilisers."
Exxon,2017-11,The move to target more lucrative speciality chemicals comes as Saudi Arabia as a whole is looking for ways to diversify its economy and lessen its reliance on oil.
Exxon,2017-11,"""We would like to provide our shareholders a business that has less dependency on oil and energy, to reduce the high level of cyclicality in our petrochemical industry,"" Benyan said."
Exxon,2017-11,"The company had decided it needed to expand its work in specialities and ""this is not going to happen through organic growth this will happen through acquisitions,"" he added."
Exxon,2017-11,"The specialities sector - which produces plastics for car windscreens, mobile phone screens and other goods - currently brings in around $1 billion of the company's annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. That figure would grow to between $2 to $3 billion in the near future, Benyan added."
Exxon,2017-11,The company posted a net profit of 17.9 billion riyals ($4.8 billion) for the full year of 2016.
Exxon,2017-11,"He told Reuters in May the firm was evaluating acquisition opportunities in the range of $3 billion to $6 billion in petrochemicals, speciality chemicals and fertilisers and said it aimed to do the first such deal in the fourth quarter of this year. [nL8N1I442X]"
Exxon,2017-11,"SABIC, currently the world's fourth-biggest petrochemicals company, planned to make a decision on an investment in a cracker in Texas with an affiliate of Exxon Mobil by the end of 2018, he said."
Exxon,2017-11,"""We don't have a decision yet but it is progressing well ... the project is promising and I think it will strengthen our partnership and our strategic position in North America,"" he said."
Exxon,2017-11,"SABIC agreed with Saudi Aramco to build a $20 billion complex on Sunday, converting 45 percent of crude oil directly into chemicals and bypassing refining."
Exxon,2017-11,"The use of crude oil as feedstock to produce olefins and other petrochemicals is economically attractive particularly when it has become harder to get gas, pushing petrochemicals companies for the search of alternative feedstock abroad.[nL8N1HR3QF]"
Exxon,2017-11,"In April, SABIC said it had agreed with Exxon Mobil Chemical to potentially build the petrochemical complex in Texas. The ethane cracker would have a capacity of 1.8 million tonnes per year."

Exxon,2017-11,OPEC's leader Saudi Arabia has signalled that it wants oil to trade at about $60 per barrel as the kingdom prepares to list shares in its national oil champion Aramco and is still fighting a large fiscal deficit.
Exxon,2017-11,"The Russian government also wants high oil prices ahead of a presidential election in March 2018. But officials in Moscow have voiced worries about pricier oil boosting the rouble, which could undermine the competitiveness of Russia's economy."

Exxon,2017-11,Slyngstad reiterated on Tuesday the proposal did not reflect a particular view of future movement in oil prices or the profitability or sustainability of the oil and gas sector.
Exxon,2017-11,"It is purely based on financial arguments and as a way to reduce the exposure to oil of the Norwegian state's wealth, which has grown over the past decade, he said."

Exxon,2017-11,{{20171127T194428.236+0000}}UPDATE 1-Exxon Mobil CEO makes first big changes to refining (Recasts with further Exxon comments)
Exxon,2017-11,"HOUSTON, Nov 27 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp Chief Executive Darren Woods is reorganizing the company's refining operations, part of a push to boost profits amid volatile oil and natural gas prices, the company said on Monday."
Exxon,2017-11,"The changes at the world's largest publicly traded oil producer are the most sweeping to date by Woods, who became chief executive in January after former chief Rex Tillerson resigned to become U.S. secretary of state."
Exxon,2017-11,"Woods has moved first to reshape the parts of the businesses he knows best, according to sources familiar with the matter. Before taking the helm at Exxon, Woods ran Exxon's refining operations."
Exxon,2017-11,"Exxon spokeswoman Charlotte Huffaker confirmed the downstream business overhaul in a statement, adding the company expects it will ""improve decision making and enhance performance in the market."""
Exxon,2017-11,"The parts of the business impacted were refining and marketing divisions, said spokesman Scott Silvestri."
Exxon,2017-11,"Company sources told Reuters Exxon's chemical operation also has been restructured, but Silvestri denied this."
Exxon,2017-11,It was not immediately clear if the changes will involve job cuts or executive departures. Exxon's Huffaker said she could not say if there would be any impact on jobs.
Exxon,2017-11,"The reorganization aims to squeeze more profits from the downstream business as the company works to improve its exploration and production operations, which have struggled since 2014 to adjust to lower oil and gas prices ."
Exxon,2017-11,"The downstream restructuring, disclosed internally last month, will combine the fuels and lubricants division with the supply and refining divisions. Financial responsibility for the merged operation will rest with country and regional chiefs who report to Exxon's Irving, Texas, headquarters rather than divisional bosses as previously, according to people familiar with the matter."
Exxon,2017-11,"The changes are designed to simplify operations and increase accountability for profitability, the sources said."
Exxon,2017-11,"Exxon's refining and chemical operations have grown in stature under Woods, delivering steady earnings compared with its oil and gas production."
Exxon,2017-11,"Exxon operates 22 refineries in 14 countries, processing nearly 5 million barrels of oil per day. The firm builds chemical and refining plants in the same location, allowing managers to shift production between fuels or chemicals based on demand."
Exxon,2017-11,The changes come as Exxon expands the refining division. The company is investing $20 billion through 2022 to expand its chemical and oil refining plants on the U.S. Gulf Coast.
Exxon,2017-11,"The refining and chemicals arms contributed more than $4.2 billion apiece to 2016 earnings, compared with a $196 million profit from exploration and production. Last year's results were affected by sharply lower crude prices."
Exxon,2017-11,"In some quarters, Exxon would not have made any money were it not for its refineries."
Exxon,2017-11,"This year, the company's oil and gas business bounced back to a $5 billion profit during the first nine months on stronger crude prices. Refining earnings were $4.03 billion and chemicals $3.25 billion, respectively, for the first three quarters this year. [nL2N1N20K7]"
Exxon,2017-11,"Some staff members have raised questions as to whether there is any need to alter a system seen as largely successful, said the sources who declined to be identified."
Exxon,2017-11,It was unclear if the changes would impact an internal accounting practice known as general interest principle. That rule permits certain transactions to be loss-making for a local division if they are beneficial for the corporation as a whole.

Exxon,2017-11,"NEW DELHI/SINGAPORE, Nov 27 (Reuters) - Oil output from Russia's Sakhalin-1 project is set to rise by about a quarter to 250,000-260,000 barrels per day (bpd) from January, sources with knowledge of the plan said, signalling Moscow may find it hard to comply with an extended OPEC output cut."

Exxon,2017-11,"The Sakhalin-1 project, operated by ExxonMobil off the coast of Sakhalin island in Russia's Far East, currently produces about 200,000 bpd."
Exxon,2017-11,"""From January, total oil production from Sakhalin-1 and a small stream from Rosneft's separate block will be about 250,000 bpd,"" said one of the sources."
Exxon,2017-11,"A second source said production will increase to 260,000 bpd in the March quarter from about 190,000 bpd in 2017. A third source said output will rise to more than more than 250,000 bpd."
Exxon,2017-11,None of the sources wanted to be identified due to the sensitivity of the issue.

Exxon,2017-11,"""Russia may have to cut output from other fields to compensate for a rise in output from Sakhalin-1. It is in Russia's interest to comply with deal to keep oil prices high,"" said Ehsan Ul-Haq, director of crude oil and refined products at consultancy Resource Economist."

Exxon,2017-11,ONGC Videsh's managing director declined to comment. Exxon was not immediately available to comment.
Exxon,2017-11,"One of the stumbling blocks for extending the OPEC-led deal is a boom in U.S. oil production , which has jumped by 15 percent since mid-2016 to a record 9.66 million bpd."
Exxon,2017-11,"U.S. producers, which scaled back output with the price slump after mid-2014, have ramped up production as oil prices climbed . Higher U.S. output undermines the impact of output cuts and erodes market share for others, like Russia."

Exxon,2017-11,"HOUSTON, Nov 27 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp Chief Executive Darren Woods is reorganizing the company's refining and chemical operations, part of a push to boost profits amid volatile oil and natural gas prices, a spokeswoman said."
Exxon,2017-11,"The changes at the world's largest publicly traded oil producer are the most sweeping to date by Woods, who became chief executive in January after former chief Rex Tillerson resigned to become U.S. secretary of state."
Exxon,2017-11,"Woods has moved first to reshape the businesses he knows best, according to sources familiar with the matter. Before taking the helm at Exxon, Woods ran Exxon's refining operations and earlier in his career was a senior executive in its global chemicals unit."
Exxon,2017-11,"The reorganization aims to squeeze more profits from the fuel and chemicals businesses as the company works to improve its exploration and production operations, which have struggled since 2014 to adjust to lower oil and gas prices."
Exxon,2017-11,"The restructuring, disclosed internally last month, will combine the fuels and lubricants division with the supply and refining divisions. Financial responsibility for the merged operation will rest with country and regional chiefs who report to Exxon's Irving, Texas, headquarters rather than divisional bosses as previously, according to people familiar with the matter."
Exxon,2017-11,"The changes are designed to simplify operations and increase accountability for profitability, the sources said."
Exxon,2017-11,"Exxon spokeswoman Charlotte Huffaker confirmed the overhaul in a statement, adding the company expects it will ""improve decision making and enhance performance in the market."""
Exxon,2017-11,It was not immediately clear if the changes will involve job cuts or executive departures. Huffaker said she could not say if there would be any impact on jobs.
Exxon,2017-11,"Exxon's refining and chemical operations have grown in stature under Woods, delivering steady earnings compared to its oil and gas production."
Exxon,2017-11,"Exxon operates 22 refineries in 14 countries, processing nearly 5 million barrels of oil per day. The firm builds chemical and refining plants in the same location, allowing managers to shift production between fuels or chemicals based on demand."
Exxon,2017-11,The changes come as Exxon expands the refining division. The company is investing $20 billion through 2022 to expand its chemical and oil refining plants on the U.S. Gulf Coast.
Exxon,2017-11,"The refining and chemicals arms contributed more than $4.2 billion apiece to 2016 earnings, compared with a $196 million profit from exploration and production. Last year's results were affected by sharply lower crude prices."
Exxon,2017-11,"In some quarters, Exxon would not have made any money were it not for its refineries."
Exxon,2017-11,"This year, the company's oil and gas business bounced back to a $5 billion profit during the first nine months on stronger crude prices . Refining earnings were $4.03 billion and chemicals $3.25 billion, respectively, for the first three quarters this year."
Exxon,2017-11,"Some staff members have raised questions as to whether there is any need to alter a system seen as largely successful, said the sources who declined to be identified."
Exxon,2017-11,It was unclear if the changes would impact an internal accounting practice known as general interest principle. That rule permits certain transactions to be loss-making for a local division if they are beneficial for the corporation as a whole.

Exxon,2017-11,{{20171127T091028.388+0000}}UPDATE 1-Total sells two Norwegian oilfields to Statoil for $1.45 bln* Total says will focus on non-operated assets
Exxon,2017-11,"PARIS/OSLO, Nov 27 (Reuters) - French oil and gas major Total said on Monday it had agreed to sell its stakes in two Norwegian oilfields to Statoil for $1.45 billion as it reviews its North Sea portfolio after acquiring Denmark's Maersk Oil in August."
Exxon,2017-11,The company said Statoil will take over its 51 percent stake in the Martin Linge field and its 40 percent holding in the Garantiana discovery on the Norwegian Continental Shelf.
Exxon,2017-11,"""The forthcoming acquisition of Maersk Oil... leads us to review our portfolio in this area so as to focus on the assets in which Total will be able to generate synergies and reduce their break-even points,"" Arnaud Breuillac, Total's head of exploration and production, said in a statement."
Exxon,2017-11,"The company said that although Norway remains strategically important as one of the largest contributors to its output, it plans to focus on its non-operated assets such as Ekofisk, Snohvit and Johan Sverdrup fields."
Exxon,2017-11,"Total's decision to scale back its presence in Norway, focusing on non-operated assets, follows a recent trend among foreign oil majors, including BP and Exxon Mobil , to become junior partners in Norwegian fields and concentrate their exploration and field management in less mature regions."
Exxon,2017-11,"Some have gone even further, with U.S. oil company Hess last month announcing the sale of its Norwegian assets altogether and plans to also divest from the Danish parts of the North Sea. [nL8N1MZ0Y4]"
Exxon,2017-11,"Total said there was limited scope for Total to improve operations in the Martin Linge field which was its only operated asset in Norway, while Statoil was in a better position to optimize the asset. The estimated recoverable resources of the field is in excess of 300 million barrels oil equivalent."
Exxon,2017-11,"The Martin Linge development has been plagued by delays and cost overruns, with the latest investment estimate seen at 41.3 billion Norwegian crowns ($5.1 billion), about 42 percent more than originally anticipated. [nL8N1MN24C]"
Exxon,2017-11,"The field is expected to start production in 2019 after a one year delay following a fatal accident in May at a South Korean yard building the platform for the field, raising the cost for the project."
Exxon,2017-11,"Total is also the largest investor in the Garantiana discovery, which is being developed."
Exxon,2017-11,"Total's shares were down 0.5 percent by 0839 GMT, while Statoil was down 0.54 percent."

Exxon,2017-11,"Iraq is to hold a press conference on Monday to announce details of the exploration blocks which are located in the south and east of the country and include one offshore block in the territorial waters, according to the statement."
Exxon,2017-11,"""The ministry is targeting to boost both production and reserves of oil and gas in cooperation with international companies,"" said the ministry statement."
Exxon,2017-11,Iraq has raised output rapidly in recent years with the help of foreign oil companies to become OPEC's second-largest producer behind Saudi Arabia.
Exxon,2017-11,"The blocks on offer are located in the provinces of Basra, Misan, Muthanna, Wasit and the Central Diyala province."
Exxon,2017-11,"The contracts will be different from previous service contracts Iraq signed with foreign firms to develop the country's giant southern fields, said the statement."
Exxon,2017-11,"Under the service contracts used for Baghdad's post-2003 bidding rounds, including those for its southern fields like Rumaila, West Qurna and Majnoon, the ministry pays companies a fixed dollar-denominated fee for every barrel of oil produced."

Exxon,2017-11,{{20171122T132103.713+0000}}EXCLUSIVE-Iraq looks to Kuwait gas pipeline to pay off reparations* Iraq under pressure from World Bank to cut gas flaring
Exxon,2017-11,"DUBAI/TOKYO/LONDON, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Iraq has hired Japan's Toyo Engineering <6330.T> to help build a gas pipeline to Kuwait and a related petrochemical plant as Baghdad looks to reduce flaring and finish paying reparations owed for its 1990 invasion of its neighbour."
Exxon,2017-11,"The project, details of which have not been reported before, would allow Kuwait to diversify its gas imports in the wake a political crisis between Gulf states and major supplier Qatar."
Exxon,2017-11,"It would also deal a blow to Royal Dutch Shell , which aimed to be the dominant gas player in Iraq before relations with Baghdad soured following Shell's exit from large oil projects."
Exxon,2017-11,"""Iraq needs to urgently reduce gas flaring as it trails behind all targets it has promised the World Bank,"" said a senior industry source working on the project but not allowed to discuss it publicly."
Exxon,2017-11,"""The Kuwaiti gas project is a quick fix and an easy way to monetise gas resources."""
Exxon,2017-11,"The World Bank, which has repeatedly made reducing gas flaring a condition of lending to Baghdad, did not respond to a request for immediate comment."
Exxon,2017-11,"Toyo is proposing to construct a gas pipeline and start deliveries after 2019, industry sources said."
Exxon,2017-11,"Toyo's chief financial officer, Kensuke Waki, told Reuters that talks about a pipeline and a petrochemical plant were ongoing but a final investment decision had not yet been made."
Exxon,2017-11,"Kuwait is very keen on the project and has offered a sovereign guarantee for up to 80 percent of the costs, industry sources said. No total cost has been announced."
Exxon,2017-11,Kuwait's oil ministry did not respond to a request for immediate comment. Oil minister Issam Al-Marzouq said last month that talks between Kuwait and Iraq were focused on a proposal to use gas to help pay Baghdad's final $4.6 billion in war compensation payments.
Exxon,2017-11,Iraqi oil ministry spokesman Asim Jihad said talks were focusing on price and confirmed that supplies could be used to help pay off reparations.
Exxon,2017-11,"Industry sources told Reuters the talks have faltered over price, however."
Exxon,2017-11,"They said Kuwait is pushing for a price of less than $3 per mbtu (million British thermal unit), in line with U.S. Henry Hub prices. But that is less than half what Iraq pays in the north when importing gas from neighbouring Iran."
Exxon,2017-11,"""The price of gas remains the key sticking point for now,"" one of the sources said."
Exxon,2017-11,He also said both Iraq and Kuwait were pushing to have the petrochemical plant built on their territory to further capitalise on gas deliveries.
Exxon,2017-11,"Discussions with Iraq are ongoing, a senior Kuwaiti oil industry source with knowledge of the project said, adding that it was not yet clear if gas would come from West Qurna 2 operated by Russia's Lukoil or from Rumaila, operated by BP ."
Exxon,2017-11,Iraq used to supply Kuwait with gas from Rumaila. Volumes reached as much as 400 mcf per day but stopped shortly after the 1990 invasion.
Exxon,2017-11,"More than a million claimants in Kuwait have been paid as part of Baghdad's $52.4 billion reparations bill for the invasion. But Iraq, hurt by the 2014 fall in oil prices and its war with Islamic State militants, requested a delay on the last and largest tranche, which is due this year."
Exxon,2017-11,"Kuwait, although one of OPEC's leading oil producers, has struggled to meet growing domestic gas demand. The shortfall has been estimated at 500 million cubic feet per day and is being covered mainly by LNG imports, including from Qatar."
Exxon,2017-11,"A decade ago Kuwait tried to build a pipeline from Qatar, but the move was blocked by Saudi Arabia. With relations between Riyadh and Doha worsening this year, Kuwait is looking to diversify its gas imports."
Exxon,2017-11,"Last year, Kuwait said it would be ready to buy up to 200 mcf/day of gas from Baghdad."
Exxon,2017-11,Iraqi oil ministry spokesman Jihad said volumes could start at 50 mcf/d rising gradually to 200 mcf/d.
Exxon,2017-11,"Iraq's gas reserves of 3.7 trillion cubic metres rank as 12th largest in the world but represent only a tenth of those of Iran, the world's largest."
Exxon,2017-11,"It extracts large quantities of gas together with oil, however, and that gas is currently being flared."
Exxon,2017-11,"Iraq's gas development plans have long focused on the Basra gas company, a $17 billion, 25-year project in which Iraq has 51 percent, Shell owns 44 percent and Japan's Mitsubishi Corp <8058.T> 5 percent."
Exxon,2017-11,"The project was designed to aggregate gas from fields in the south including West Qurna 1 operated by Exxon Mobil Corp , Zubair operated by Italy's ENI and BP's Rumaila."
Exxon,2017-11,"""Shell's main aim was always to develop an LNG terminal and ultimately a petchem complex in Iraq,"" said a Shell insider who worked on the gas project."
Exxon,2017-11,"With Iraq refusing to agree on a gas price with Shell, the project has hit a major impasse, industry sources said. Talks have also been complicated by Shell pulling out of the Majnoon oil fields earlier this year."
Exxon,2017-11,"""Iraq is furious at Shell and prospects don't look that great for the Basra gas company,"" one Iraqi industry source said."
Exxon,2017-11,"Asked about the negotiations, both Shell and the Iraqi oil ministry said discussions were ongoing and both sides remained committed to the project."

Exxon,2017-11,"State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert, questioned at length by reporters on the issue at her daily briefing, strongly defended Tillerson's decision as valid and in ""technical compliance with the law in the way he read it."""

Exxon,2017-11,"Asked at a photo opportunity with the visiting Peruvian foreign minister about his decision, Tillerson sidestepped any direct response to the dissenting officials' complaint."
Exxon,2017-11,"Reuters reported in June that Tillerson had disregarded internal recommendations on Iraq, Myanmar and Afghanistan.

Exxon,2017-11,"The child soldiers law passed in 2008 states that the U.S. government must be satisfied that no children under the age of 18 ""are recruited, conscripted or otherwise compelled to serve as child soldiers"" for a country to be removed from the list. The statute extends specifically to government militaries and government-supported armed groups like militias."
Exxon,2017-11,"The list currently includes the Democratic Republic of Congo, Nigeria, Somalia, South Sudan, Mali, Sudan, Syria and Yemen."
Exxon,2017-11,Hook made clear that America's top diplomat used what he sees as his discretion to interpret the law.
Exxon,2017-11,"Foreign militaries on the list are prohibited from receiving aid, training and weapons from Washington unless the White House issues a waiver based on U.S. ""national interest."" In 2016, under the Obama administration, both Iraq and Myanmar, as well as others such as Nigeria and Somalia, received waivers."
Exxon,2017-11,"At times, the human rights community chided President Barack Obama for being too willing to issue waivers and exemptions, especially for governments that had security ties with Washington, instead of sanctioning more of those countries. ""Human Rights Watch frequently criticized President Barack Obama for giving too many countries waivers, but the law has made a real difference,"" Jo Becker, advocacy director for the group's children's rights division, wrote in June in a critique of Tillerson's decision."
Exxon,2017-11,"The dissenting U.S. officials stressed that Tillerson's decision to exclude Iraq, Afghanistan and Myanmar went a step further than the Obama administration's waiver policy by contravening the law and effectively easing pressure on the countries to eradicate the use of child soldiers."
Exxon,2017-11,"The officials acknowledged in the documents reviewed by Reuters that those three countries had made progress. But in their reading of the law, they said that was not enough to be kept off a list that has been used to shame governments into completely eradicating the use of child soldiers."
Exxon,2017-11,"Ben Cardin, ranking Democrat on the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, wrote to Tillerson on Friday saying there were ""serious concerns that the State Department may not be complying"" with the law and that the secretary's decision ""sent a powerful message to these countries that they were receiving a pass on their unconscionable actions."""
Exxon,2017-11,The memo was among a series of previously unreported documents sent this month to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the State Department's independent inspector general's office that relate to allegations that Tillerson violated the child soldiers law.
Exxon,2017-11,Legal scholars say that because of the executive branch's latitude in foreign policy there is little legal recourse to counter Tillerson's decision.
Exxon,2017-11,"Herman Schwartz, a constitutional law professor at American University in Washington, said U.S. courts would be unlikely to accept any challenge to Tillerson's interpretation of the child soldiers law as allowing him to remove a country from the list on his own discretion."
Exxon,2017-11,"The signatories to the document were largely senior policy experts with years of involvement in the issues, said an official familiar with the matter. Reuters saw a copy of the document that did not include the names of those who signed it."
Exxon,2017-11,"Tillerson's decision to remove Iraq and Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, from the list and reject a recommendation by U.S. officials to add Afghanistan was announced in the release of the government's annual human trafficking report on June 27."
Exxon,2017-11,"Six days earlier, a previously unreported memo emailed to Tillerson from a range of senior diplomats said the three countries violated the law based on evidence gathered by U.S. officials in 2016 and recommended that he approve them for the new list."
Exxon,2017-11,"It noted that in Iraq, the United Nations and non-governmental organizations ""reported that some Sunni tribal forces ... recruited and used persons younger than the age of 18, including instances of children taking a direct part in hostilities."""
Exxon,2017-11,"Ali Kareem, who heads Iraq's High Committee for Human Rights, denied the country's military or state-backed militias use child soldiers. ""We can say today with full confidence that we have a clean slate on child recruitment issues,"" he said."
Exxon,2017-11,"The memo also said ""two confirmed cases of child recruitment"" by the Myanmar military ""were documented during the reporting period."" Human rights advocates have estimated that dozens of children are still conscripted there."
Exxon,2017-11,"The memo said further there was ""credible evidence"" that a government-supported militia in Afghanistan ""recruited and used a child,"" meeting the minimum threshold of a single confirmed case that the State Department had previously used as the legal basis for putting a country on the list."

Exxon,2017-11,"LONDON, Nov 17 (Reuters) - The Norwegian sovereign wealth fund's proposal to ditch its oil and gas shares, though hugely symbolic in the battle against climate change, is unlikely to cause a rush to the exit by major investors in the sector in the short term. [nL8N1NM4UW]"
Exxon,2017-11,"The move by the $1 trillion fund, the world's largest, rattled stock markets, exposing what is seen as one of the biggest threats to companies such as Royal Dutch Shell, Exxon Mobil and BP as the world shifts towards renewable energy such as wind and solar."
Exxon,2017-11,"But in the meantime, expectations of growing global demand for oil and gas for decades to come mean reliance on these companies is likely to continue."
Exxon,2017-11,"And although the Norwegian initiative will encourage those seeking to hasten the move to a low-carbon economy, the degree to which other investors can follow the fund's example, at least in the short term, is less clear."
Exxon,2017-11,"The European oil and gas index <.SXEP> fell on Friday to its lowest since late September, extending declines following the Norwegian fund's announcement."
Exxon,2017-11,"For some, it was seen as an opening shot in the decline of the 150-year-old sector in the battle to slow global warming and reduce carbon emissions, reminiscent of the demise of coal."
Exxon,2017-11,"""The investor exit from oil and gas as a fuel source will be slower than coal, but the emissions reduction maths is clear and so this inevitable transition has started,"" said Nathan Fabian, director of policy at Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI), a United Nations-backed group that represents asset managers with holdings of over $60 trillion."
Exxon,2017-11,"""I do not see this as the start of a broader trend among major investors,"" said Rohan Murphy, energy analyst at Allianz, which holds shares in several oil majors."
Exxon,2017-11,"""Gas, which is a big part of all the big oil businesses today, is the answer for the medium-term energy transition to gas from coal for power generation,"" Murphy said."

Exxon,2017-11,"But beyond our dependence on oil and gas, the size of the world's top oil companies would make mass divestment a huge challenge. The top five publicly traded companies - Exxon, Chevron, Shell, BP and Total - together have a market value of over $1 trillion."
Exxon,2017-11,"Coal companies, on the other hand, have always been smaller."
Exxon,2017-11,"For now, there is no viable alternative to oil and gas to meet the world's demand, several investors said."
Exxon,2017-11,"""My guess is that after the initial market adjustment ... the move may not damage the sector's long-term performance significantly,"" said Kevin Gardiner, global investment strategist at Rothschild Wealth Management."
Exxon,2017-11,"The Norwegian wealth fund's move, echoing Saudi Arabia's plan to list part of its national oil company, was aimed at making Norway less exposed to volatile oil prices and less reliant on revenue from fossil fuels."
Exxon,2017-11,"If approved, it would most likely take years for the Norwegian fund to unwind its large investments in the sector and find new homes for the money."
Exxon,2017-11,"And while there is also growing demand from retail investors to invest in 'responsible' or 'sustainable' funds, oil and gas companies are not commonly excluded and any change here would be gradual."
Exxon,2017-11,"Dropping oil and gas companies would also mean missing out on a rich source of dividend income, a prized asset at a time of low bond yields."
Exxon,2017-11,"In absolute terms, the number of oil and gas companies in leading stock indices varies, with 14 in the STOXX 600 index of leading European companies, or 2.3 percent; and 26 in the S&P 500 <.SPX>, or 5.2 percent."
Exxon,2017-11,"The size of some of the largest can have a disproportionate impact on returns relative to their index peers. While there are just two companies in Britain's blue-chip FTSE 100 index, for example, they make up 14 percent of the index's value."
Exxon,2017-11,"While the Norwegian fund has long been a trend-setter for issues around socially responsible investing, particularly in Scandinavia, the reason for this decision is relatively unique."
Exxon,2017-11,"Its desire to make treasury receipts less dependent on the oil price is not a challenge faced by most pension funds, which make up a large slice of the money invested globally."
Exxon,2017-11,"Any decision to ditch oil and gas would arguably leave them less diversified, not more, said investors, although charitable endowments may have more flexibility to do so."

Exxon,2017-11,"""Many wish for a quick and revolutionary role reversal between the oil and gas industry, and the renewable and new electric industry. But undue haste and an overly ideological approach could bring great economic and social damage,"" Total CEO Patrick Pouyanne said in a speech last month."
Exxon,2017-11,"Also, demand for oil in transportation and plastics is not expected to decline significantly until 2050, according to many forecasts. [nL1N1ND281]"
Exxon,2017-11,"The Norwegian announcement came as more than 195 nations met in Bonn, Germany, to decide how to comply with climate targets agreed in Paris in 2015 to limit a rise in global temperatures.[nL8N1NL6I4]"
Exxon,2017-11,"But beyond our dependence on oil and gas, the size of the world's top oil companies would make mass divestment a huge challenge. The top five publicly traded companies - Exxon, Chevron, Shell, BP and Total - together have a market value of over $1 trillion."
Exxon,2017-11,"Coal companies, on the other hand, have always been smaller."
Exxon,2017-11,"For now, there is no viable alternative to oil and gas to meet the world's demand, several investors said."
Exxon,2017-11,"""My guess is that after the initial market adjustment ... the move may not damage the sector's long-term performance significantly,"" said Kevin Gardiner, global investment strategist at Rothschild Wealth Management."
Exxon,2017-11,"The Norwegian wealth fund's move, echoing Saudi Arabia's plan to list part of its national oil company, was aimed at making Norway less exposed to volatile oil prices and less reliant on revenue from fossil fuels."
Exxon,2017-11,"If approved, it would most likely take years for the Norwegian fund to unwind its large investments in the sector and find new homes for the money."
Exxon,2017-11,"And while there is also growing demand from retail investors to invest in 'responsible' or 'sustainable' funds, oil and gas companies are not commonly excluded and any change here would be gradual."
Exxon,2017-11,"Dropping oil and gas companies would also mean missing out on a rich source of dividend income, a prized asset at a time of low bond yields."
Exxon,2017-11,"In absolute terms, the number of oil and gas companies in leading stock indices varies, with 14 in the STOXX 600 index of leading European companies, or 2.3 percent; and 26 in the S&P 500 <.SPX>, or 5.2 percent."
Exxon,2017-11,"The size of some of the largest can have a disproportionate impact on returns relative to their index peers. While there are just two companies in Britain's blue-chip FTSE 100 index, for example, they make up 14 percent of the index's value."
Exxon,2017-11,"While the Norwegian fund has long been a trend-setter for issues around socially responsible investing, particularly in Scandinavia, the reason for this decision is relatively unique."
Exxon,2017-11,"Its desire to make treasury receipts less dependent on the oil price is not a challenge faced by most pension funds, which make up a large slice of the money invested globally."
Exxon,2017-11,"Any decision to ditch oil and gas would arguably leave them less diversified, not more, said investors, although charitable endowments may have more flexibility to do so."

Exxon,2017-11,"The South Pacific nation, one of the world's least explored countries but known for corruption and violence, has become a key source of growth for two of the world's biggest energy companies - ExxonMobil Corp and Total SA - looking to expand their liquefied natural gas (LNG) businesses."

Exxon,2017-11,"Santos was in deep trouble just a few years ago, struggling with high debt and low oil and gas prices. But asset sales, debt reduction and cost-cutting have led it back to health."

Exxon,2017-11,"{{20171116T122358.309+0000}}Pakistan LNG import project consortium folds -Hoegh LNGLONDON, Nov 16 (Reuters) - A consortium behind a liquefied natural gas (LNG) import project in Pakistan, including oil giant Exxon Mobil , France's Total and Qatar Petroleum [QATPE.UL], has been dissolved, shipping company Hoegh LNG said on Thursday."
Exxon,2017-11,"Hoegh LNG was due to supply the project's ship-based import terminal, a floating storage and regasification unit (FSRU), where LNG brought in by tanker is converted back to gas to feed into Pakistan's grid."
Exxon,2017-11,The other six members of the consortium were Japan's Mitsubishi <8058.T> and Turkish developer Global Energy Infrastructure (GEI).
Exxon,2017-11,"""The consortium has spent considerable time and resources on finding [the project's] final form and structure. However, by mid-November it has been concluded that no agreement with GEI could be found and the consortium has consequently been dissolved,"" Hoegh LNG said in a results statement."
Exxon,2017-11,Last month Reuters reported that Exxon Mobil pulled out of the project owing to disagreements with GEI and that Total and Mitsubishi could also quit and join a rival scheme. [nL8N1N546H]
Exxon,2017-11,"The project was set to be Pakistan's third and biggest by import capacity, starting in late 2018 or early 2019."
Exxon,2017-11,"Pakistan plans to add its second LNG import terminal by the end of this year, but private companies have proposed building six more, largely around Port Qasim."
Exxon,2017-11,Hoegh LNG did not elaborate on the nature of the disagreement with GEI but industry sources with knowledge of the matter said that part of it related to project costs.
Exxon,2017-11,"""Due to the withdrawal of the LNG sellers from the infrastructure consortium, and the delays to the original start-up date for the GEI project, Hoegh LNG is evaluating its options with respect to the FSRU contract with GEI,"" it said."
Exxon,2017-11,The company said it is also pursuing alternative opportunities in Pakistan as an FSRU provider.
Exxon,2017-11,"A highly developed pipeline grid, extensive industrial demand and the biggest natural gas-powered vehicle fleet in Asia behind China and Iran make Pakistan an easy fit for LNG. Official estimates show that imports could jump fivefold to 30 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) by 2022."
Exxon,2017-11,The consortium's split also leaves in doubt a multibillion-dollar deal Qatar has already struck with GEI for the sale of up to 2.3 million tonnes of LNG annually over 20 years.

Exxon,2017-11,UPDATE 2-Dutch court rejects government's Groningen gas production plan - Reuters News
Exxon,2017-11,{{20171115T142310.972+0000}}UPDATE 2-Dutch court rejects government's Groningen gas production plan(Adds reaction from Economic Affairs Ministry and gas extraction company NAM and more background)
Exxon,2017-11,"THE HAGUE, Nov 15 (Reuters) - The highest Dutch administrative court has rejected the government's plan to cap production at a major gas field that has caused damaging earthquakes, saying it might be possible to cut output further without endangering supplies."
Exxon,2017-11,"The decision adds another chapter to the long fight over gas production in the northern Dutch province of Groningen, where citizens accuse the government of endangering their lives while protecting gas revenues."
Exxon,2017-11,"The government had proposed capping production at the Groningen gas field at 21.6 billion cubic metres (bcm) per year over the next five years, after a 2015 report found production was risking lives. That would be down from 24 bcm in the production year just ended and 39.4 bcm in 2015-16. [nL8N19G55U]"
Exxon,2017-11,"But the Council of State said on Wednesday the government had failed to properly substantiate its decision, describing it as ""unacceptable"" to potentially keep production unchanged for five years when it might be possible to further reduce demand."
Exxon,2017-11,"The Council ordered the government to review its decision within the next 12 months, but production could be maintained at 21.6 bcm for the year through Oct. 1, 2018."
Exxon,2017-11,"The Economic Affairs Ministry called the verdict a ""tough decision"", but accepted it has to come up with a new plan in the coming year."
Exxon,2017-11,"The drafting of a new plan will be the responsibility of Economic Affairs minister Eric Wiebes, whose predecessor Henk Kamp left office when the new government was installed last month. Kamp lowered gas production in Groningen several times in response to earthquakes, but was still seen by residents as neglecting the risks of ongoing production."
Exxon,2017-11,"Wednesday's decision was met with jubilation from Groningen citizens, many of whom have seen their houses damaged by the thousands of small earthquakes triggered by the gas extraction."
Exxon,2017-11,"""We won on all fronts. All lousy excuses the government used to justify production have been tossed out the window,"" said Dirk Kleijer, a spokesman for the Groninger Bodembeweging campaign group."
Exxon,2017-11,"""The minister now needs to put the safety of residents first. He now needs to come up with a good plan: to lower production and to guarantee our safety""."
Exxon,2017-11,"NAM, the Royal Dutch Shell and ExxonMobil joint venture that operates the Groningen field, also found support in the court ruling, saying it affirmed its view that the safe level of production can be determined by using the right models."
Exxon,2017-11,"The NAM had contested the government's new production cap, saying it ignored earlier agreed safety norms."
Exxon,2017-11,Pakistan LNG import project consortium folds -Hoegh LNG - Reuters News
Exxon,2017-11,"{{20171116T122358.309+0000}}Pakistan LNG import project consortium folds -Hoegh LNGLONDON, Nov 16 (Reuters) - A consortium behind a liquefied natural gas (LNG) import project in Pakistan, including oil giant Exxon Mobil , France's Total and Qatar Petroleum [QATPE.UL], has been dissolved, shipping company Hoegh LNG said on Thursday."
Exxon,2017-11,"Hoegh LNG was due to supply the project's ship-based import terminal, a floating storage and regasification unit (FSRU), where LNG brought in by tanker is converted back to gas to feed into Pakistan's grid."
Exxon,2017-11,The other six members of the consortium were Japan's Mitsubishi <8058.T> and Turkish developer Global Energy Infrastructure (GEI).
Exxon,2017-11,"""The consortium has spent considerable time and resources on finding [the project's] final form and structure. However, by mid-November it has been concluded that no agreement with GEI could be found and the consortium has consequently been dissolved,"" Hoegh LNG said in a results statement."
Exxon,2017-11,Last month Reuters reported that Exxon Mobil pulled out of the project owing to disagreements with GEI and that Total and Mitsubishi could also quit and join a rival scheme. [nL8N1N546H]
Exxon,2017-11,"The project was set to be Pakistan's third and biggest by import capacity, starting in late 2018 or early 2019."
Exxon,2017-11,"Pakistan plans to add its second LNG import terminal by the end of this year, but private companies have proposed building six more, largely around Port Qasim."
Exxon,2017-11,Hoegh LNG did not elaborate on the nature of the disagreement with GEI but industry sources with knowledge of the matter said that part of it related to project costs.
Exxon,2017-11,"""Due to the withdrawal of the LNG sellers from the infrastructure consortium, and the delays to the original start-up date for the GEI project, Hoegh LNG is evaluating its options with respect to the FSRU contract with GEI,"" it said."
Exxon,2017-11,The company said it is also pursuing alternative opportunities in Pakistan as an FSRU provider.
Exxon,2017-11,"A highly developed pipeline grid, extensive industrial demand and the biggest natural gas-powered vehicle fleet in Asia behind China and Iran make Pakistan an easy fit for LNG. Official estimates show that imports could jump fivefold to 30 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) by 2022."
Exxon,2017-11,The consortium's split also leaves in doubt a multibillion-dollar deal Qatar has already struck with GEI for the sale of up to 2.3 million tonnes of LNG annually over 20 years.
Exxon,2017-11,"GEI has approached several companies about joining the scheme, including trading house Vitol [VITOLV.UL]."

Exxon,2017-11,UPDATE 2-Dutch court rejects government's Groningen gas production plan - Reuters News
Exxon,2017-11,{{20171115T142310.972+0000}}UPDATE 2-Dutch court rejects government's Groningen gas production plan(Adds reaction from Economic Affairs Ministry and gas extraction company NAM and more background)
Exxon,2017-11,"THE HAGUE, Nov 15 (Reuters) - The highest Dutch administrative court has rejected the government's plan to cap production at a major gas field that has caused damaging earthquakes, saying it might be possible to cut output further without endangering supplies."
Exxon,2017-11,"The decision adds another chapter to the long fight over gas production in the northern Dutch province of Groningen, where citizens accuse the government of endangering their lives while protecting gas revenues."
Exxon,2017-11,"The government had proposed capping production at the Groningen gas field at 21.6 billion cubic metres (bcm) per year over the next five years, after a 2015 report found production was risking lives. That would be down from 24 bcm in the production year just ended and 39.4 bcm in 2015-16. [nL8N19G55U]"
Exxon,2017-11,"But the Council of State said on Wednesday the government had failed to properly substantiate its decision, describing it as ""unacceptable"" to potentially keep production unchanged for five years when it might be possible to further reduce demand."
Exxon,2017-11,"The Council ordered the government to review its decision within the next 12 months, but production could be maintained at 21.6 bcm for the year through Oct. 1, 2018."
Exxon,2017-11,"The Economic Affairs Ministry called the verdict a ""tough decision"", but accepted it has to come up with a new plan in the coming year."
Exxon,2017-11,"The drafting of a new plan will be the responsibility of Economic Affairs minister Eric Wiebes, whose predecessor Henk Kamp left office when the new government was installed last month. Kamp lowered gas production in Groningen several times in response to earthquakes, but was still seen by residents as neglecting the risks of ongoing production."
Exxon,2017-11,"Wednesday's decision was met with jubilation from Groningen citizens, many of whom have seen their houses damaged by the thousands of small earthquakes triggered by the gas extraction."
Exxon,2017-11,"""We won on all fronts. All lousy excuses the government used to justify production have been tossed out the window,"" said Dirk Kleijer, a spokesman for the Groninger Bodembeweging campaign group."
Exxon,2017-11,"""The minister now needs to put the safety of residents first. He now needs to come up with a good plan: to lower production and to guarantee our safety""."
Exxon,2017-11,"NAM, the Royal Dutch Shell and ExxonMobil joint venture that operates the Groningen field, also found support in the court ruling, saying it affirmed its view that the safe level of production can be determined by using the right models."
Exxon,2017-11,"The NAM had contested the government's new production cap, saying it ignored earlier agreed safety norms."
Exxon,2017-11,"WASHINGTON, Nov 14 (Reuters) - The Republican and Democratic leaders of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee blasted the U.S. State Department on Tuesday for cuts in staff and what they described as a failure to have a plan for a proposed reorganization."
Exxon,2017-11,"""I don't think they are anywhere close to having a plan to present relative to the reforms that they want,"" said Senator Bob Corker, the Republican chairman of the committee."
Exxon,2017-11,"Rex Tillerson, Republican President Donald Trump's Secretary of State, has embraced the White House's proposal - rejected by key members of Congress - to cut the State Department budget by about 30 percent. He has imposed a hiring freeze while analyzing the agency's operations and deciding how to reorganize them."
Exxon,2017-11,"Tillerson, a former chief executive at Exxon Mobil Corp who took office on Feb. 1, has offered few specifics to ease concerns, including in Congress, that the plan risks weakening U.S. standing in the world."
Exxon,2017-11,"Senator Ben Cardin, the top Democrat on the Foreign Relations panel, called the staff reductions a risk to national security and a ""high-level decapitation of leadership."""
Exxon,2017-11,"""Folks, this situation is alarming. We put our country in danger,"" Cardin said during a committee business meeting."
Exxon,2017-11,"Corker said the panel had had ""a very unsatisfactory meeting last week with the State Department"" and that concern was bipartisan. ""We need to be much more focused on holding them accountable,"" Corker said."
Exxon,2017-11,"Trump has several times contradicted Tillerson on foreign policy issues. The president said earlier this month that his opinion was the only one that mattered in U.S. foreign policy. ""The one that matters is me,"" Trump said on Fox News. ""I'm the only one that matters because, when it comes to it, that's what the policy is going to be."" [nL2N1N9155]"

Exxon,2017-11,"""The signing of the Block 52 EPSA represents an important milestone in Eni's strategy to reinforce its presence in the Middle East region,"" Eni CEO Claudio Descalzi said."

Exxon,2017-11,{{20171113T205644.817+0000}}UPDATE 1-Ghana opens talks with Exxon on deepwater drilling contract (Adds quotes and context)
Exxon,2017-11,"ACCRA, Nov 13 (Reuters) - Ghana has opened talks with Exxon Mobil Corp to allow the U.S. oil firm to undertake deepwater exploration off its coast, a deputy energy minister said on Monday."
Exxon,2017-11,"""The negotiations are ongoing according to our current laws ... so far so good,"" Mohamed Amin Adam told Reuters on the sidelines of an Africa oil conference in Accra."
Exxon,2017-11,"Adam said the government had opted for direct negotiation with Exxon Mobil without open competitive tendering due to the peculiar nature of the field, and because Ghana has yet to pass regulations to back open competitive tendering."
Exxon,2017-11,A new petroleum law requires that oil contracts should be awarded through open and competitive tender. It also allows direct negotiation when necessary and justifiable.
Exxon,2017-11,"Exxon Mobil signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Ghana in 2015 to assess its Deepwater Cape Three Point (DCTP) region, 150 km (100 miles) off the coast with water depth ranging between 2,000 and 4,000 metres (6,500 and 13,000 feet)."
Exxon,2017-11,The government said two firms had separately opted not to seek to explore the field because of its depth and high risk levels.
Exxon,2017-11,"Adam said the government considered the ExxonMobil bid important, given the firm's experience and capability in deepwater operations. ""Ultra-deepwater exploration is beyond the reach of current technology and we believe operators with strong research and development capability such as ExxonMobil are needed to unlock the potentials,"" Adam said."
Exxon,2017-11,The DCTP interest is the second attempt by Exxon Mobil to acquire oil assets in Ghana after the government blocked its 2009 bid to take over Kosmos' stake in the flagship Jubilee field.
Exxon,2017-11,"Ghana, which also produces cocoa and gold, expects to ramp up oil production to around 250,000 barrels per day by 2019 from four oil fields including Jubilee whose current combined average annual output is around 100,000 bpd."

Exxon,2017-11,"MOSCOW, Nov 13 (Reuters) - Kazakhstan's giant Kashagan oilfield will reach its planned capacity of 370,000 barrels per day later than anticipated, its developer, the North Caspian Operating Company (NCOC), said on Monday."
Exxon,2017-11,"""I expect that we will need year 2018 to fully accomplish this (370,000 bpd) capacity, and we will study options to accelerate this timing,"" NCOC managing director Bruno Jardin said in a statement on Monday."
Exxon,2017-11,"In October, Kashagan's output fell to 182,000 barrels per day (23,000 tonnes per day) from 200,000 barrels per day in September, its highest monthly output figure, sources said."
Exxon,2017-11,"It was the first biggest fall in production since May this year and comes at time when NCOC delayed plans to ramp up output to 370,000 bpd from the end of 2017. [nL8N1N74OD]"
Exxon,2017-11,"""Production is not really stable. It's difficult to forecast anything,"" a source close to one of Kashagan consortium shareholders said."
Exxon,2017-11,"""... with the start of gas re-injection in August this year we have learned a great deal about how the reservoir reacts. Pressure decline, and hence production increase, is going to be more gradual than we originally anticipated,"" Bruno said."
Exxon,2017-11,"Kashagan's output will only rise above 200,000 barrels per day if gas re-injection goes well, industry sources familiar with the oilfield development said."
Exxon,2017-11,"All associated natural gas produced at Kashagan along with crude oil has to be utilised and should not be flared up for environmental and technical reasons. Gas produced has a high mercaptan content, which makes it pungent-smelling."
Exxon,2017-11,"""If they don't find a way to utilise the gas Kashagan will face the gas glut,"" an industry source said."
Exxon,2017-11,"Kashagan tentatively launched production in September 2013, but was forced to suspend it due to gas leaks blamed on faulty pipes. Production was restarted again last year."
Exxon,2017-11,The early development was fraught with delays and cost overruns that have brought total spending on the project to about $55 billion.
Exxon,2017-11,"The Kashagan consortium includes Kazakh state oil firm KazMunayGaz , Eni , ExxonMobil , Royal Dutch Shell , Total , China's CNPC [CNPET.UL] and Japan's Inpex <1605.T>."

Exxon,2017-11,{{20171109T175233.073+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-Even China can't thaw Alaska's LNG ice age(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are her own.)
Exxon,2017-11,"DALLAS, Nov 9 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Alaska's liquefied natural gas projects are in an ice age that even China's riches won't thaw. The U.S. state has been trying to tap its considerable resource since the 1970s. Exxon Mobil and BP walked away from projects last year because the costly endeavor doesn't compute at current prices. China's cheap debt and need for gas alter the equation, but other energy sources still look better than the Last Frontier."
Exxon,2017-11,"While Alaska's lands are resource-rich, they're so remote that infrastructure is hard to build. The Prudhoe Bay region has produced some 17 billion barrels of oil since its discovery, according to the Resource Development Council of Alaska. But much of what was pulled out has been pumped back in because it has nowhere to go."
Exxon,2017-11,"China, seizing the moment of President Donald Trump's trip to Beijing, is now offering to invest in the project which requires new plants along with 800 miles of pipe. It is undeterred by a report by Wood Mackenzie, a consultant for the oil majors, which last year said oil prices would have to be above $70 a barrel before an investor could ink the kind of 12 percent return most global oil producers target."
Exxon,2017-11,"A few things are different for the People's Republic. Even though oil is still below $70, Chinese state oil companies like Sinopec have access to cheap debt, and might accept a lower return in exchange for securing a patch of liquefied natural gas. China's shift from coal means that gas demand is set to rise 8.7 percent per year through 2022, according to the International Energy Agency."
Exxon,2017-11,"- The state of Alaska signed a joint development agreement with China Petrochemical, CIC [CIC.UL] and the Bank of China <601988.SS> to develop the state's liquefied natural gas resources."
Exxon,2017-11,"- The agreement, signed in the presence of U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, would include several processing plants and an 800-mile pipeline."
Exxon,2017-11,"- BP and Exxon walked away from the project last year after Wood Mackenzie, a consultant to the firms, said the project would produce 12 percent returns only if oil prices hit $70 a barrel."

Exxon,2017-11,* Majors seek to show they can make profit in low oil prices
Exxon,2017-11,"LONDON, Nov 9 (Reuters) - The world's top oil and gas companies are under growing pressure to revive share and dividend rewards to investors as profits and oil prices get back on track after a three-year crunch."
Exxon,2017-11,"BP fired the opening shot last week by surprising the market with the resumption of share buybacks after diluting share value for three years through scrip dividends, where investors can opt to receive dividends in shares or cash.[nL8N1N61IG]"
Exxon,2017-11,"The pressure is now on Royal Dutch Shell to make good on commitments made in 2015, following the decision to acquire BG Group for $54 billion, to remove scrip in 2017 and launch a $25 billion share buyback programme from 2017 to 2020."
Exxon,2017-11,"""There is a competition to see who can first remove the scrip, resume the buyback and then maybe, how much can you buy back and compensate for years of share dilution,"" said Jags Walia, asset manager at Dutch pension fund APG, which holds shares in Shell and BP."
Exxon,2017-11,"""I'd like to see them (Shell) announce the turning off of scrip, start talking about the $25 billion buyback - it has been a while since they spoke about that."""
Exxon,2017-11,"Shell did not provide an update on its plans with its third-quarter results, which showed the company generated sufficient cash to cover dividends for the fifth straight quarter, outdoing its larger rival Exxon Mobil . [nL8N1N81KV]"
Exxon,2017-11,"Chief Financial Officer Jessica Uhl said in a call last week that Shell's priorities remain to reduce debt, pay dividends and turn off scrip before turning to share repurchases."
Exxon,2017-11,"Changing the dividend policy will have a significant impact on Shell's balance sheet even with cashflow soaring to $28 billion in the first nine months. Dividend payouts for the Anglo-Dutch company in the 12 months to September amounted to $15 billion, with scrip accounting for around a quarter."
Exxon,2017-11,"Norway's Statoil confirmed in October it would revert to full cash dividends from the fourth quarter, after ending a two-year scrip dividend programme.[nL8N1N10QO]"
Exxon,2017-11,France's Total said it will scrap the discount offered for scrip shares in 2018.
Exxon,2017-11,"Shares of oil companies went through a roller coaster in recent years, tracking the collapse of oil prices in 2014 from over $100 a barrel to as low as $28 a barrel."
Exxon,2017-11,"Deep cost savings, job cuts, asset sales and the recovery in oil prices to above $64 a barrel this month have all helped boost profits and shares back to levels similar to 2014."
Exxon,2017-11,"With the Shell's $30 billion asset disposal programme on track to be completed almost a year ahead of schedule and debt trending towards around 20 percent, removing scrip will be in focus at its investor day at the end of the month."
Exxon,2017-11,"""The pressure is on Shell to draw a line in the sand and commit to end scrip dividend,"" said Brendan Warn, analyst at BMO Capital Markets."
Exxon,2017-11,"Removing scrip, effectively used to preserve cash in hard times, will send the clearest message yet that Shell, as well as other companies, have adapted to a world of lower prices, Warn said."
Exxon,2017-11,"Dividends are a major burden on oil majors' balance sheets, amounting to more than $47 billion in 2017."
Exxon,2017-11,"But none, bar Italy's Eni cut levels throughout the three-year downturn. Shell has repeatedly boasted that it hasn't reduced dividends since the Second World War."
Exxon,2017-11,Scrip and suspending buybacks were still vital for many companies to survive at crude prices of around $50 a barrel in 2017.
Exxon,2017-11,"HSBC estimates that BP's operations will fully cover $8 billion of dividend payments as well as $16 billion in spending at $59 a barrel this year, going down to $53 a barrel in 2018 when excluding payments for the 2010 Deepwater Horizon spill."
Exxon,2017-11,"For Shell, scrip has helped reduce the breakeven price in 2017 from $55 a barrel to $50 a barrel, according to HSBC."
Exxon,2017-11,Exxon slowed down last year its massive share repurchase programme as earnings dropped. It nevertheless kept with its 35-year-old tradition of raising dividends.
Exxon,2017-11,"Chevron held off on a dividend raise for the fourth quarter due to market uncertainty, but in July it said such a move would be its first use of cash."

Exxon,2017-11,{{20171108T120002.956+0000}}RPT-INSIGHT-Peak oil? Majors aren't buying into the threat from renewables(Repeats for additional clients with no changes to text)
Exxon,2017-11,"HOUSTON/LONDON, Nov 8 (Reuters) - Two decades ago, BP set out to transcend oil, adopting a sunburst logo to convey its plans to pour $8 billion over a decade into renewable technologies, even promising to power its gas stations with the sun."
Exxon,2017-11,"That transformation - marketed as ""Beyond Petroleum"" - led to manufacturing solar panels in Australia, Spain and the United States and erecting wind farms in the United States and the Netherlands."
Exxon,2017-11,"Today, BP might be more aptly branded ""Back to Petroleum"" after exiting or scaling back its renewable energy investments. Lower-cost Chinese components upended its solar panel business, which the firm shed in 2011. A year later, BP tried to sell its U.S. wind power business but couldn't get a buyer."
Exxon,2017-11,"""We made very big bets in the past,"" BP Chief Executive Bob Dudley told Reuters in an interview. ""A lot of those didn't work. We're not sure yet what will be commercially acceptable."""
Exxon,2017-11,The costly lesson of the biggest foray yet by an oil major into renewable energy was not lost on rival firms.
Exxon,2017-11,Even as governments and environmentalists forecast a peak in oil demand within a generation - and China and India say they may eventually ban gasoline and diesel vehicles - leaders of the world's biggest oil firms are not buying the argument that their traditional business faces any imminent threat.
Exxon,2017-11,"A Reuters analysis of clean energy investments and forecasts by oil majors, along with exclusive interviews with top oil executives, reveal mostly token investments in alternative energy. Today, renewable power projects get about 3 percent of $100 billion in combined annual spending by the five biggest oil firms, according to energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie."
Exxon,2017-11,"BP, Chevron , Exxon Mobil , Royal Dutch Shell and Total are instead milking their drilling and processing assets to finance investor payouts now and bolster balance sheets for the future. They believe they can enter new energy sectors later by acquiring companies or technologies if and when others prove them profitable."
Exxon,2017-11,"""There is no sign of peak demand right now,"" said Chevron CEO John Watson, an economist by training, who is retiring in early 2018. ""For the next 10 or 20 years, we expect to see oil demand growth."""
Exxon,2017-11,"The International Energy Agency forecasts a 10 percent rise in oil demand through 2040, reflecting the consensus among oil firms. The earliest estimate for peak oil demand from any oil company is late next decade, by Shell CEO Ben van Beurden."
Exxon,2017-11,"History shows energy transitions - from wood to coal to oil - take a long time. Coal's contribution to world energy consumption peaked recently at 28 percent and remains above the share from natural gas, though just below oil's one-third."
Exxon,2017-11,"Profit, if any, from the majors' decades-long interest in renewable energy ventures is unclear. None of the largest oil companies disclose earnings from their solar, wind or biofuels ventures."
Exxon,2017-11,"Investors such as Alasdair McKinnon, portfolio manager at Scottish Investment Trust, believe oil will sustain shareholders far into the future."
Exxon,2017-11,"""There isn't a viable alternative to fossil fuels on the horizon,"" he said. ""We're not buying into the long-term demand destruction for oil."""
Exxon,2017-11,"The confidence in oil's future relies largely on rising consumption from emerging economies. Exxon forecasts that transportation will require 25 percent more fuel by 2040, propelled by growth in Asia. Chevron's analysis of the India and Nigeria markets, meanwhile, concludes that infrastructure needed for electric cars is unlikely to be built."
Exxon,2017-11,"Cars account for about a fifth of oil consumption, BP estimates. So if electric vehicles do eventually capture mass markets, oil firms would still expect growing demand from the air, rail and trucking industries."
Exxon,2017-11,"Natural gas - now a smaller business than oil for most majors - can grow to nearly a quarter of all energy used by displacing coal in power generation and through expanded uses in chemicals, these companies forecast. Natural gas can also fuel the power needed for electric cars."
Exxon,2017-11,"Although Shell forecasts peak oil demand coming earlier than its rivals, it is preparing for that prospect mostly with massive natural gas investments. The firm last year spent $54 billion acquiring BG Group, which derives half its production from gas. Chevron, Exxon and Shell recently have spent billions of dollars on new liquefied natural gas projects across the globe."
Exxon,2017-11,"Critics of oil majors' cautious renewable strategy - including some big investors - say the firms are being short-sighted in their trust that change will come slow, or that one fossil fuel will gradually replace another. Just as cheap natural gas is supplanting coal, even cheaper wind or solar eventually will displace gas, they argue."
Exxon,2017-11,"South Australia is soon to become a proving ground for a project could pave the way for renewable power to supplant fossil fuels for peak electricity - a combined wind farm and grid-scale battery storage facility, by electric-car maker Tesla Inc and operator Windlab Ltd."

Exxon,2017-11,INSIGHT-Peak oil? Majors aren't buying into the threat from renewables - Reuters News
Exxon,2017-11,{{20171108T060002.732+0000}}INSIGHT-Peak oil? Majors aren't buying into the threat from renewablesBy Ernest Scheyder and Ron Bousso
Exxon,2017-11,"HOUSTON/LONDON, Nov 8 (Reuters) - Two decades ago, BP set out to transcend oil, adopting a sunburst logo to convey its plans to pour $8 billion over a decade into renewable technologies, even promising to power its gas stations with the sun."
Exxon,2017-11,"That transformation - marketed as ""Beyond Petroleum"" - led to manufacturing solar panels in Australia, Spain and the United States and erecting wind farms in the United States and the Netherlands."
Exxon,2017-11,"Today, BP might be more aptly branded ""Back to Petroleum"" after exiting or scaling back its renewable energy investments. Lower-cost Chinese components upended its solar panel business, which the firm shed in 2011. A year later, BP tried to sell its U.S. wind power business but couldn't get a buyer."
Exxon,2017-11,"""We made very big bets in the past,"" BP Chief Executive Bob Dudley told Reuters in an interview. ""A lot of those didn't work. We're not sure yet what will be commercially acceptable."""
Exxon,2017-11,The costly lesson of the biggest foray yet by an oil major into renewable energy was not lost on rival firms.
Exxon,2017-11,Even as governments and environmentalists forecast a peak in oil demand within a generation - and China and India say they may eventually ban gasoline and diesel vehicles - leaders of the world's biggest oil firms are not buying the argument that their traditional business faces any imminent threat.
Exxon,2017-11,"A Reuters analysis of clean energy investments and forecasts by oil majors, along with exclusive interviews with top oil executives, reveal mostly token investments in alternative energy. Today, renewable power projects get about 3 percent of $100 billion in combined annual spending by the five biggest oil firms, according to energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie."
Exxon,2017-11,"BP, Chevron , Exxon Mobil , Royal Dutch Shell and Total are instead milking their drilling and processing assets to finance investor payouts now and bolster balance sheets for the future. They believe they can enter new energy sectors later by acquiring companies or technologies if and when others prove them profitable."
Exxon,2017-11,"""There is no sign of peak demand right now,"" said Chevron CEO John Watson, an economist by training, who is retiring in early 2018. ""For the next 10 or 20 years, we expect to see oil demand growth."""
Exxon,2017-11,"The International Energy Agency forecasts a 10 percent rise in oil demand through 2040, reflecting the consensus among oil firms. The earliest estimate for peak oil demand from any oil company is late next decade, by Shell CEO Ben van Beurden."
Exxon,2017-11,"History shows energy transitions - from wood to coal to oil - take a long time. Coal's contribution to world energy consumption peaked recently at 28 percent and remains above the share from natural gas, though just below oil's one-third."
Exxon,2017-11,"Profit, if any, from the majors' decades-long interest in renewable energy ventures is unclear. None of the largest oil companies disclose earnings from their solar, wind or biofuels ventures."
Exxon,2017-11,"Investors such as Alasdair McKinnon, portfolio manager at Scottish Investment Trust, believe oil will sustain shareholders far into the future."
Exxon,2017-11,"""There isn't a viable alternative to fossil fuels on the horizon,"" he said. ""We're not buying into the long-term demand destruction for oil."""
Exxon,2017-11,"The confidence in oil's future relies largely on rising consumption from emerging economies. Exxon forecasts that transportation will require 25 percent more fuel by 2040, propelled by growth in Asia. Chevron's analysis of the India and Nigeria markets, meanwhile, concludes that infrastructure needed for electric cars is unlikely to be built."
Exxon,2017-11,"Cars account for about a fifth of oil consumption, BP estimates. So if electric vehicles do eventually capture mass markets, oil firms would still expect growing demand from the air, rail and trucking industries."
Exxon,2017-11,"Natural gas - now a smaller business than oil for most majors - can grow to nearly a quarter of all energy used by displacing coal in power generation and through expanded uses in chemicals, these companies forecast. Natural gas can also fuel the power needed for electric cars."
Exxon,2017-11,"Although Shell forecasts peak oil demand coming earlier than its rivals, it is preparing for that prospect mostly with massive natural gas investments. The firm last year spent $54 billion acquiring BG Group, which derives half its production from gas. Chevron, Exxon and Shell recently have spent billions of dollars on new liquefied natural gas projects across the globe."
Exxon,2017-11,"Critics of oil majors' cautious renewable strategy - including some big investors - say the firms are being short-sighted in their trust that change will come slow, or that one fossil fuel will gradually replace another. Just as cheap natural gas is supplanting coal, even cheaper wind or solar eventually will displace gas, they argue."
Exxon,2017-11,"South Australia is soon to become a proving ground for a project could pave the way for renewable power to supplant fossil fuels for peak electricity - a combined wind farm and grid-scale battery storage facility, by electric-car maker Tesla Inc and operator Windlab Ltd."
Exxon,2017-11,"Fossil fuel companies need to quickly reorient themselves to the low returns of the solar and wind industries, said Jules Kortenhorst, a former Shell executive who runs the Rocky Mountain Institute, a nonprofit energy research organization."

Exxon,2017-11,"{{20171108T000000.000+0000}}RPT-INSIGHT-Peak oil? Majors aren't buying into the threat from renewablesHOUSTON/LONDON, Nov 8 (Reuters)"
Exxon,2017-11,"HOUSTON/LONDON, Nov 8 (Reuters) - Two decades ago, BP set out to transcend oil, adopting a sunburst logo to convey its plans to pour $8 billion over a decade into renewable technologies, even promising to power its gas stations with the sun."
Exxon,2017-11,"That transformation - marketed as ""Beyond Petroleum"" - led to manufacturing solar panels in Australia, Spain and the United States and erecting wind farms in the United States and the Netherlands."
Exxon,2017-11,"Today, BP might be more aptly branded ""Back to Petroleum"" after exiting or scaling back its renewable energy investments. Lower-cost Chinese components upended its solar panel business, which the firm shed in 2011. A year later, BP tried to sell its U.S. wind power business but couldn't get a buyer."
Exxon,2017-11,"""We made very big bets in the past,"" BP Chief Executive Bob Dudley told Reuters in an interview. ""A lot of those didn't work. We're not sure yet what will be commercially acceptable."""
Exxon,2017-11,The costly lesson of the biggest foray yet by an oil major into renewable energy was not lost on rival firms.
Exxon,2017-11,Even as governments and environmentalists forecast a peak in oil demand within a generation - and China and India say they may eventually ban gasoline and diesel vehicles - leaders of the world's biggest oil firms are not buying the argument that their traditional business faces any imminent threat.
Exxon,2017-11,"A Reuters analysis of clean energy investments and forecasts by oil majors, along with exclusive interviews with top oil executives, reveal mostly token investments in alternative energy. Today, renewable power projects get about 3 percent of $100 billion in combined annual spending by the five biggest oil firms, according to energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie."
Exxon,2017-11,"BP, Chevron , Exxon Mobil , Royal Dutch Shell and Total are instead milking their drilling and processing assets to finance investor payouts now and bolster balance sheets for the future. They believe they can enter new energy sectors later by acquiring companies or technologies if and when others prove them profitable."
Exxon,2017-11,"""There is no sign of peak demand right now,"" said Chevron CEO John Watson, an economist by training, who is retiring in early 2018. ""For the next 10 or 20 years, we expect to see oil demand growth."""
Exxon,2017-11,"The International Energy Agency forecasts a 10 percent rise in oil demand through 2040, reflecting the consensus among oil firms. The earliest estimate for peak oil demand from any oil company is late next decade, by Shell CEO Ben van Beurden."
Exxon,2017-11,"History shows energy transitions - from wood to coal to oil - take a long time. Coal's contribution to world energy consumption peaked recently at 28 percent and remains above the share from natural gas, though just below oil's one-third."
Exxon,2017-11,"Profit, if any, from the majors' decades-long interest in renewable energy ventures is unclear. None of the largest oil companies disclose earnings from their solar, wind or biofuels ventures."
Exxon,2017-11,"Investors such as Alasdair McKinnon, portfolio manager at Scottish Investment Trust, believe oil will sustain shareholders far into the future."
Exxon,2017-11,"""There isn't a viable alternative to fossil fuels on the horizon,"" he said. ""We're not buying into the long-term demand destruction for oil."""
Exxon,2017-11,"The confidence in oil's future relies largely on rising consumption from emerging economies. Exxon forecasts that transportation will require 25 percent more fuel by 2040, propelled by growth in Asia. Chevron's analysis of the India and Nigeria markets, meanwhile, concludes that infrastructure needed for electric cars is unlikely to be built."
Exxon,2017-11,"Cars account for about a fifth of oil consumption, BP estimates. So if electric vehicles do eventually capture mass markets, oil firms would still expect growing demand from the air, rail and trucking industries."
Exxon,2017-11,"Natural gas - now a smaller business than oil for most majors - can grow to nearly a quarter of all energy used by displacing coal in power generation and through expanded uses in chemicals, these companies forecast. Natural gas can also fuel the power needed for electric cars."
Exxon,2017-11,"Although Shell forecasts peak oil demand coming earlier than its rivals, it is preparing for that prospect mostly with massive natural gas investments. The firm last year spent $54 billion acquiring BG Group, which derives half its production from gas. Chevron, Exxon and Shell recently have spent billions of dollars on new liquefied natural gas projects across the globe."
Exxon,2017-11,"Critics of oil majors' cautious renewable strategy - including some big investors - say the firms are being short-sighted in their trust that change will come slow, or that one fossil fuel will gradually replace another. Just as cheap natural gas is supplanting coal, even cheaper wind or solar eventually will displace gas, they argue."
Exxon,2017-11,"South Australia is soon to become a proving ground for a project could pave the way for renewable power to supplant fossil fuels for peak electricity - a combined wind farm and grid-scale battery storage facility, by electric-car maker Tesla Inc and operator Windlab Ltd."
Exxon,2017-11,"Fossil fuel companies need to quickly reorient themselves to the low returns of the solar and wind industries, said Jules Kortenhorst, a former Shell executive who runs the Rocky Mountain Institute, a nonprofit energy research organization."
Exxon,2017-11,"""You cannot flip a switch on a Monday morning from being one to another,"" he said. ""Paychecks in the oil and gas industry are based on fundamentally believing that the world cannot see economic growth without fossil fuels."""
Exxon,2017-11,"To achieve the same share of the renewables market that the largest publicly-traded oil companies now hold in oil and gas would require an investment of about $350 billion over the next 18 years, estimates Wood Mackenzie. Such spending would cut into the generous dividends that oil firms' shareholders have come to expect."
Exxon,2017-11,"""We think it will be a real challenge for these companies to change their business model,"" said Nathan Fabian, director of policy at Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI), a United Nations-backed group."
Exxon,2017-11,"PRI has guidelines calling for investment analysis that weighs environmental, social and governance issues. Its principles have been adopted by investors with $70 trillion in assets under management."
Exxon,2017-11,"Oil companies have made relatively modest investments a wide range of renewable technologies. Chevron has a smattering of mostly small wind and solar ventures; Shell invests in sugar-cane ethanol in South America, wind farms in the United States and electric-car charging stations in Europe; and BP still owns the U.S. wind farms it once tried to sell."
Exxon,2017-11,John Browne - who as BP's CEO two decades ago helped launch the early investments in renewables - said he still believes the renewable power will grow.
Exxon,2017-11,"""It will take time,"" he said in an interview with Reuters last month. ""And they have time."""
Exxon,2017-11,"Shell pledged to invest up to $1 billion a year by 2020 in what it calls ""new energies."""
Exxon,2017-11,"Total said this year it would spend $500 million annually on developing alternatives. But soon after that announcement, it unveiled its $7.5 billion acquisition of Maersk Oil, part of a plan to pump more crude from Norway's North Sea."
Exxon,2017-11,Total CEO Patrick Pouyanne in October explained the focus on economics at an October oil conference in London.
Exxon,2017-11,"""When you ask our customers what their priority is, either in developed economies or in emerging countries, price comes first,"" he said. A hasty shift to renewables, he said, ""could bring great economic and social damage to our 6 billion customers."""
Exxon,2017-11,"Exxon Mobil is backing research into biofuels, joining with gene modification firm Synthetic Genomics to coax algae to produce more lipids, an oil substitute. It hasn't detailed its investment but said the effort remains far from commercialization. By comparison, Exxon this year spent $5.6 billion on U.S. shale oil assets."
Exxon,2017-11,"Some of the oil industry's largest customers are planning a shift to renewable alternatives, especially in transportation, which accounts for about a quarter of annual energy consumption."
Exxon,2017-11,"Ford Motor Co earlier this fall disclosed it would aim, by 2030, to derive a third of its sales from battery-powered cars and another third from gas-electric hybrids. [nL4N1ME3GX]"
Exxon,2017-11,"A startup backed by Boeing Co and JetBlue Airways Corp recently announced plans for a small hybrid jet by 2022, using batteries from Tesla and battery supplier Panasonic Corp <6752.T>. [nL2N1MG1HZ]"
Exxon,2017-11,Yet oil firms continue to forecast aggressive growth in liquid fuels. Exxon predicts 90 percent of the transportation industry will rely on petroleum through 2040.
Exxon,2017-11,"BP projects the world's auto fleet doubling to 1.8 billion vehicles by 2035, with only 75 million of those powered by electricity."
Exxon,2017-11,"""We'll see if (electric cars) can be delivered in a way that doesn't require large subsidies"" from governments, Chevron's Watson told Reuters. ""That's what we're seeing now."""

Exxon,2017-11,"SINGAPORE, Nov 7 (Reuters) - The rising demand for crude oil that can more easily produce transportation fuels when refined has some Australian and Malaysian producers boasting cargoes valued at close to $70 a barrel, a hefty premium to global benchmarks ."
Exxon,2017-11,"Malaysia's state oil company Petronas [PETR.UL] sold last week a December-loading Miri Light cargo at a premium of about $4.50 a barrel to dated Brent, equivalent to about $69 at the latest prices, according to multiple traders that participate in the Asian regional crude market."
Exxon,2017-11,"Australian Barrow Island and Cooper Basin crudes are now close to $70 a barrel currently, based on premiums for grades of about $1.50 a barrel to Malaysian benchmark grade Kimanis, said the traders. Kimanis itself is priced at a premium of about $4.40 a barrel to dated Brent, which was assessed at $64.07 a barrel on Monday by price reporting agency S&P Global Platts."
Exxon,2017-11,"""Prices of domestic Australian grades are even higher than MCO (Malaysian Crude Oil),"" an Asian trader said. ""That would make them the most expensive crudes in the world."""
Exxon,2017-11,"Demand for these grades is rising because of the short distances to Asian refineries, which prize the crude for their low sulphur content and higher yields of more valuable oil products such as diesel, the traders said."
Exxon,2017-11,"Demand for short-haul grades has increased after the Brent oil market structure flipped into backwardation, when prompt prices are more than later prices. That means the value of the crude drops over the course of the voyage."
Exxon,2017-11,"The refiners are willing to pay up for the Australian and Malaysian crudes rather than incur the additional time and cost of shipping Brent supplies from the North Sea, the traders said."
Exxon,2017-11,"Typically, Asia-Pacific grades are sold to refineries in Southeast Asia and Australia or New Zealand that have a preference for low-sulphur oil."
Exxon,2017-11,Values for these grades have risen because of their scarcity.
Exxon,2017-11,"Petronas and its partners Royal Dutch Shell , ConocoPhillips , Murphy Oil Corp , Pertamina [PERTM.UL] sell about 6 million barrels of Kimanis each month."
Exxon,2017-11,But volumes for other Malaysian grades such as Kikeh and Labuan have fallen as output declines at the mature fields.
Exxon,2017-11,"Australia's crude and condensate production has been below 300,000 barrels per day (bpd) since September 2016, data from the country's Department of the Environment and Energy showed. In August it was 279,000 bpd."
Exxon,2017-11,"Santos Ltd produces about 30,000 bpd of Cooper Basin crude in southern Australia, according to its website."
Exxon,2017-11,"Santos and its partners, Chevron Corp and Mobil Australia Resources Co, a unit of Exxon Mobil Corp , produces 5,000 bpd of Barrow Island in western Australia, according to Santos."

Exxon,2017-11,"LONDON/DUBAI, Nov 7 (Reuters) - An audit of Saudi Aramco's [IPO-ARMO.SE] oil reserves is unlikely to be completed before the end of 2017 because of the huge scale of the task, sources familiar with the matter said, a later timeframe than previously indicated."
Exxon,2017-11,"The audit has so far confirmed the reserves figures earlier given by Saudi Arabia, the sources said, an important part of the state oil company's preparatory work for its planned initial public offering next year."
Exxon,2017-11,"Saudi Arabia's reserves of easily recoverable oil have long been considered the world's largest. But there have also been questions about their volume and quality, and the audit seeks to provide internationally recognised figures for investors."
Exxon,2017-11,"""It's a huge task,"" a source familiar with the matter said, commenting on the progress of the reserves audit. ""They are about two-thirds of the way through. It's all going well and smoothly - no surprises."""
Exxon,2017-11,"For nearly 30 years - despite rising production, large swings in oil prices and improved technology - Riyadh has annually reported the same number for reserves of 261 billion barrels, according to BP's statistical review."
Exxon,2017-11,"Dallas-based DeGolyer and MacNaughton, and Gaffney, Cline and Associates, part of Baker Hughes , are involved in the auditing, sources have said. Baker Hughes declined to comment on the progress of the work, while DeGolyer did not respond to a request for comment."
Exxon,2017-11,"Asked to comment, Aramco said: ""We do not comment on rumours and speculation. Investors will receive relevant information in due course in connection with the IPO."""
Exxon,2017-11,"An industry source had told Reuters in March that Aramco aimed to have one of the two reserves auditors wrap up the review this year, long before the planned listing. But this now looks unlikely. [nL5N1GL5AF]"
Exxon,2017-11,"""Aramco wants to make sure the companies are shown full data to avoid sceptical remarks on its reserves later on,"" a second source said. ""It's unlikely the audit will be finished this year."""
Exxon,2017-11,"A third source said auditing work on the major Aramco fields was completed, leaving smaller fields still to be audited."
Exxon,2017-11,A reserves total that is significantly above or below the 261 billion figure is likely to affect Aramco's potential value. Earlier phases of the audit have supported Aramco's statements on the total size of deposits. [nL5N1FH2YM]

Exxon,2017-11,Shell looks beyond road fuels to secure future of refining - Reuters News
Exxon,2017-11,"{{20171106T070002.682+0000}}Shell looks beyond road fuels to secure future of refining* Asphalt, plastics, chemicals to sustain demand, Shell says"
Exxon,2017-11,"LONDON, Nov 6 (Reuters) - While the world braces for the electric-vehicle revolution, Royal Dutch Shell is betting on growing appetite for asphalt and plastics to sustain its century-old oil refining business for the coming decades."
Exxon,2017-11,"Converting crude oil into products ranging from gasoline to industrial chemicals has long faced obstacles due to volatile profits, high costs, safety issues and pollution and more recently, forecasts of peaking demand for oil."
Exxon,2017-11,"But refining, together with trading, marketing and chemicals - known together as downstream - has proved its importance during the oil industry's downturn since 2014, providing the bulk of Shell's profits as the price of crude collapsed."
Exxon,2017-11,"Shell has in recent years transformed its downstream business by selling some plants and upgrading others to have them better resist oil price fluctuations and shifts in demand, delivering double-digit returns on capital employed."
Exxon,2017-11,"""Refining will continue to be part of our portfolio for decades to come,"" said Shell's head of manufacturing Lori Ryerkerk, who is in charge of refining."
Exxon,2017-11,Shell is perhaps the most aggressive in its sector in forecasting that the demand for gasoline could reach an apex by the 2030s as drivers shift to electric vehicles and traditional engines become more efficient.
Exxon,2017-11,"But still, Shell says, the continued expansion of the world's economy, particularly in Asia, means consumption of other refined oil products and petrochemicals is likely to grow."
Exxon,2017-11,"For instance, there are no economically viable substitutes for asphalt, needed to build roads, or for the polymers and chemicals used to produce plastics for cars, toys and clothes, Ryerkerk said."
Exxon,2017-11,"The Anglo-Dutch company plans to double the size of its chemicals business by the middle of the next decade with several new plants including in Louisiana and Pennsylvania that benefit from access to cheap shale gas, said Shell's head of chemicals, Graham van't Hoff."
Exxon,2017-11,It also wants 20 percent of sales from its fuel stations worldwide to come from recharging electric vehicles and low-carbon fuels by 2025. [nL5N1LT4R6]
Exxon,2017-11,The oil sector's outlook for growth in demand for oil and plastics could prove wrong if governments around the world introduce regulations to reduce fossil fuel consumption in their fight against pollution and global warming. A study published last week said a quarter of the world's oil refineries risk closure by 2035 if those targets are met. [nL8N1N60XR]
Exxon,2017-11,"Just as some countries such as China and India contemplate banning gasoline and diesel vehicles, rules to limit consumption of plastics such as bottles and bags could dampen demand, analysts said."
Exxon,2017-11,"""Regulation is one of the biggest risks to the business,"" said Jason Kenney, head of European oil and gas equity research at Banco Santander."
Exxon,2017-11,Overcapacity is another danger as other companies including Exxon Mobil and France's Total also expand into petrochemicals.
Exxon,2017-11,"""Shell currently offers double-digit returns on capital employed from downstream and chemicals. But then you could have a flood of capacity and it will be a difficult sector to remain competitive for decades,"" Kenney said."
Exxon,2017-11,"Even when demand starts to fall, Shell says its refining arm will have an edge over many competitors thanks to the company's access to its own, cheaper crude and complex trading operations that curb its vulnerability to fluctuating oil prices."
Exxon,2017-11,"It has 43,000 petrol stations in 70 countries, making Shell the world's largest fuel retailer. Shell recently introduced battery charging spots at a number of stations in Britain and plans to develop hydrogen fuelling stations in Germany."
Exxon,2017-11,"Shell also supplies 11 percent of the world's lubricants needed in cars, trucks and heavy industrial machinery. It has one of the world's largest aviation fuel businesses, fuelling a plane every 40 seconds."
Exxon,2017-11,"""Downstream is a highly resilient business. It is pretty independent to changes in crude price,"" said John Abbott, head of Shell's downstream business."
Exxon,2017-11,"""We have a competitive edge going into the energy transition,"" Abbott said."
Exxon,2017-11,"Shell has interests in more than 20 refineries and processed around 2.6 million barrels of oil per day in 2016, while its 15 petrochemical plants processed 6.2 million tonnes last year."

Exxon,2017-11,"SINGAPORE, Nov 6 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Singapore's DBS Group has taken a big dose of oil medicine. The $43 billion banking titan lifted net provisions in the latest quarter to a 15-year high. Like its two largest peers, Overseas-Chinese Banking Corp and United Overseas Bank , DBS reckons the worst of the shock in crude prices is over. The offshore industry is still aching, though, leaving both the economy and vessel valuations vulnerable. Local lenders may yet feel more pain."
Exxon,2017-11,"After a rough 18 months of watching Swiber Holdings and other providers of engineering and construction services reel into distress, there is some good news for Singapore's banks. Interest rates are set to gradually rise. The Lion City's property market is recovering, and its broader $300 billion economy is showing signs of improvement. Wealth management and transaction-banking businesses are gaining ground."
Exxon,2017-11,DBS's move on Monday to set aside another S$815 million ($597 million) for troubled loans is an effort to get investors to focus on that momentum. Provisions now cover about half its oil-and-gas services non-performing debt. Singapore's biggest bank also has aggressively written down the value of offshore service vessels used to secure many of the loans to 25 percent.
Exxon,2017-11,"That's a helpful step, especially if the remaining portfolio is as strong as DBS is arguing. It doesn't mean the worst is definitively past, however, despite a 31 percent run-up in its shares this year."
Exxon,2017-11,"After distress first hit roughly two years ago when oil tumbled below $50 a barrel, the industry is now experiencing something of a second wave as big producers and service providers come to terms with lower prices for longer. They make it harder to justify complex projects. Drilling cancellations in the region, such as Exxon Mobil's exit from East Natuna in Indonesia this summer, will persist. Halliburton said last month its clients were focused on ""cost-effective"" production."
Exxon,2017-11,"It's the sort of news that augurs poorly for banks, especially ones that have not pushed down energy-related collateral nearer to liquidation levels as DBS has. More loans also may wind up added to the endangered list. Singapore's three biggest banks are getting closer to the energy reality, but aren't necessarily fully there."
Exxon,2017-11,"- DBS, Singapore's biggest lender, on Nov. 6 reported an 87 percent increase in net provisions, to S$815 million, their highest level in 15 years, ""to remove uncertainty over residual weak oil and gas services exposures""."
Exxon,2017-11,"- At the end of September, DBS had S$3 billion of oil-and-gas support services non-performing assets, for which allowances of S$1.5 billion have been made."
Exxon,2017-11,"- The bank's net profit fell 23 percent to a five-year low of S$822 million, below the average estimate of S$1.13 billion from four analysts compiled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S."

Exxon,2017-11,"KARACHI, Nov 4 (Reuters) - Pakistani conglomerate Engro Corp expects to complete building its second liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal in early 2019, a senior company official said, as Pakistan bets heavily on LNG imports to curb energy shortages."
Exxon,2017-11,"Engro built Pakistan's first LNG terminal in 2015 and is now finalising plans with Royal Dutch Shell , Fatima Group and trading house Gunvor for another terminal with capacity of 4.5 million tonnes per year."
Exxon,2017-11,"Pakistan has become a hot destination for global energy giants, with producers such as Exxon and traders like Vitol seeking partners to build terminals after Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi re-oriented Pakistan's energy policy towards gas."
Exxon,2017-11,"A second terminal is due to come on line later this month, easing gas shortages that have hobbled Pakistan's manufacturing sector and wider economy for more than a decade. Private companies are racing to build several other terminals."
Exxon,2017-11,"Jahangir Piracha, chief executive of Engro's LNG unit, Elengy Terminal Pakistan, said his consortium expects to sign a final investment decision (FID) in the next few months and would then build the terminal in about a year."
Exxon,2017-11,"""The technical studies are all done. We are looking at early 2019 (to complete the project) if everything goes right,"" Piracha told Reuters in Karachi this week."
Exxon,2017-11,"A rival LNG terminal project by a six-member consortium that included ExxonMobil and Qatar Petroleum, appears to be in trouble after the American company pulled out, Pakistani officials said. ExxonMobil, however, remains very keen on Pakistan and is looking at other terminal projects. [nL8N1N546H]"
Exxon,2017-11,"Unlike Pakistan's first two terminals where the government guaranteed to buy all the gas due to be imported, the subsequent terminals are going to be entirely private ventures with no government off-take guarantees."
Exxon,2017-11,Engro's Piracha said the biggest challenge for the Engro consortium is to convince gas buyers such as power plants and factories to sign up before the project is on the ground.
Exxon,2017-11,"""Because there are so many people trying to develop a project, (local buyers) want to bet on the right horse. They don't want to sign up with you to find out that your project didn't come through,"" he said."
Exxon,2017-11,Piracha said this posed a problem for terminal developers who would prefer to have signed-up customers before making a final investment decision.
Exxon,2017-11,"""It's a bit of a chicken and egg story,"" Piracha said. ""My own feeling is that people want to see an investment and then they will sign up."""
Exxon,2017-11,"Piracha said other companies in the Engro group could sign up to be consumers from the terminal, which has the capacity for regasification of up to 600 million cubic feet per day, as could businesses from consortium partner Fatima, another major Pakistani conglomerate."

Exxon,2017-11,{{20171103T190227.262+0000}}U.S. shale producers promise both higher output and returnsBy Ernest Scheyder
Exxon,2017-11,"HOUSTON, Nov 3 (Reuters) - U.S. shale producers are telling investors impatient for better returns that they can keep boosting oil output aggressively and do so while still making money for shareholders."
Exxon,2017-11,"Investors have pushed top U.S. shale companies to focus on returns, rather than higher output, a move that threatened to slow the breakneck growth in supply sparked by the shale revolution in the world's top oil consumer."
Exxon,2017-11,"For the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, slower shale production gains would have been welcome. The cartel this year put caps on its members' production to end a supply glut and boost oil prices, only to find U.S. shale gains and record exports muting the impact of their curbs."
Exxon,2017-11,"But in comments during recent third-quarter earnings calls, shale executives signaled they expect to deliver both higher returns and output."
Exxon,2017-11,"At least seven of the largest U.S. shale companies, including Noble Energy Inc and Devon Energy Corp , forecast 10 percent or better production gains this quarter in the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico, the largest U.S. oilfield."
Exxon,2017-11,"Underpinning the effort: Rising global oil demand and crude prices that are up about 30 percent since June lows. Shale producers are also proving they can drive output higher even after several last summer reported some Permian wells had begun delivering more natural gas, a sign of aging fields."
Exxon,2017-11,"""I'd like to think the industry is changing for the better,"" said Todd Heltman of wealth manager Neuberger Berman, which invests in shale producers. ""Investors are more focused on return metrics."""
Exxon,2017-11,Devon plans to boost oil production this quarter by 20 percent from the Permian and Oklahoma shale plays and spend less on each new well. [nL2N1N5147] [nL4N1N66JY]
Exxon,2017-11,"""We are taking the appropriate steps to become an industry leader with our disciplined approach to capital allocation,"" said Devon Chief Executive Dave Hager."
Exxon,2017-11,"U.S. shale output is expected to hit 6.1 million barrels of oil per day (bpd) this month, up 35 percent from a year earlier, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration."
Exxon,2017-11,"The inventory of drilled-but-uncompleted wells, a backlog for future output, in September reached 7,120, up 42.6 percent from the year-ago period, and an all-time high. While the number of oil drilling rigs in the United States has slid in recent months, each rig's efficiency has jumped sharply in the past year."
Exxon,2017-11,"EOG Resources Inc boosted third-quarter production by 8 percent and swung to a $100 million profit, from a loss in the same period last year, helped in part by rising oil prices. CEO Bill Thomas said the company is aiming for 20 percent increase in U.S. crude output this year over last. Its stock is up nearly 17 percent since August.[nL2N1N821M]"
Exxon,2017-11,"Noble Energy forecast its fourth-quarter shale production will rise 15 percent to at least 102,000 bpd."
Exxon,2017-11,"""If you look at the growth from our Permian Basin drilling operations, you can see very substantial increases in oil production growth of about 15 percent,"" said Tim Dove, CEO of Pioneer Natural Resources Co ."
Exxon,2017-11,"Pioneer, one of the largest Permian oil producers, plans to boost its shale output by at least 16,000 bpd this quarter. The company's shares are up 15.4 percent since early August. [nL2N1N7253]"
Exxon,2017-11,"""We are excited about the trajectory of production growth in the upcoming quarters,"" said Vicki Hollub, CEO of Occidental Petroleum Corp , another top Permian producer. Oxy projects its Texas oil output will rise by more than 80,000 bpd by the end of 2018, to more than 200,000 bpd. [nL2N1N72CF]"

Exxon,2017-11,"Continental Resources Inc and Parsley Energy Inc , two other large U.S. shale producers, are due to report quarterly results next week."
Exxon,2017-11,"U.S. shale increases are keenly watched by OPEC, and likely will be in the spotlight when the group and other major producers meet on Nov. 30 in Vienna."
Exxon,2017-11,"Emmanuel Kachikwu, Nigeria's oil minister, warned at the last OPEC meeting in May that the group would ""sit down again and look at what process it is we need to do"" if U.S. shale output continues to weigh on global markets.[nL1N1IQ0AC]"
Exxon,2017-11,"Adding to the pressures, major oil companies that were late to recognize shale's potential have brought their own resources to bear. Chevron Corp and Exxon Mobil Corp are setting out aggressive plans for U.S. shale production, especially in the Permian.[nL2N1N20S2]"
Exxon,2017-11,"Exxon, which more than doubled its Permian holdings earlier this year, plans to boost the number of drilling rigs there by 50 percent, to 30, by the end of next year. By 2020, Exxon expects its Permian oil production to rise 45 percent.[nL2N1N20K7]"
Exxon,2017-11,"Chevron, which has operated in the Permian since the 1930s, recently added a 15th drilling rig in the Permian, with plans to add five more.[nL2N1N20NT]"
Exxon,2017-11,"""We'll be in a position to grow production for a period of years just from the shale,"" Chevron CEO John Watson said of the company's Permian operations."

Exxon,2017-11,"MEXICO CITY, Nov 2 (Reuters) - Uncertainty about the fate of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and investor protections it guarantees could crimp future investment in Mexico's oil industry, including a high-stakes January deepwater auction."
Exxon,2017-11,"Ahead of a fifth round of NAFTA talks in Mexico City in mid-November, Washington's tough demands that partners Canada and Mexico resist has clouded the future of the 23-year-old pact President Donald Trump has threatened to quit if he cannot get a better deal. [nL2N1MS0XB]"
Exxon,2017-11,"The January deepwater tender of 29 blocks holding some 4.2 billion barrels of prospective reserves, could suffer if concerns about NAFTA's future persuaded oil majors such as Chevron Corp and Exxon Mobil Corp to sit out the auction, oil executives and former government officials say."
Exxon,2017-11,"So far, 17 companies have begun the process of pre-qualifying for the auction."
Exxon,2017-11,"""Future investment without those investment protections of NAFTA will take into account the higher level of risk of any dispute not being settled in a more fair manner,"" Tim Callahan, Mexico country manager for Australia's BHP Billiton , told Reuters."
Exxon,2017-11,"Energy firms worry the end of NAFTA could eliminate the so-called Investor State Dispute Settlement, which allows such conflicts to be settled via international arbitrators, overriding contractual clauses that only reference local courts."
Exxon,2017-11,"Last December, BHP Billiton won a 60 percent stake in the $11 billion Trion field in the Gulf of Mexico, the flagship deepwater project of state-owned oil company Pemex."
Exxon,2017-11,"That same day, eight of 10 blocks were awarded in the deepwater auction, yielding investment commitments worth hundreds of millions of dollars in the first few years of the contracts alone by firms like U.S.-based Chevron and Murphy Oil."
Exxon,2017-11,"The auctions are part of a 2013 energy reform that ended Pemex's monopoly on oil and gas production. So far, the reform has secured investment pledges that will eventually be worth about $80 billion, the government says."
Exxon,2017-11,"Callahan, who heads the Mexican oil producer association's NAFTA committee, pointed to longstanding nationalist sentiment toward oil and a lack of legal precedents during the 75-year Pemex monopoly."
Exxon,2017-11,"""I don't think any of us want to be the first to test in the Mexican courts how they're going to rule on any disputes when it comes to oil,"" he said."
Exxon,2017-11,"Threats to NAFTA may force some U.S. oil firms to opt out of January's tenders, said former deputy energy minister Lourdes Melgar, an architect of the auctions. Some deem the investor dispute mechanism ""essential"" to protect investments, she added."
Exxon,2017-11,"Some of the biggest investments to date were made only after the government assured firms behind closed doors that any expropriation or administrative withdrawal of contracts could be appealed using the NAFTA resolution mechanism, said Carlos Pascual, a former U.S. ambassador to Mexico now at IHS Markit."
Exxon,2017-11,"The assurances were made before Trump's surprise election win and company concerns over investor protections lasted ""up until the last minute"" before bids were submitted, Pascual said."
Exxon,2017-11,"Without NAFTA, investment disputes could fall to Mexican courts, which unsettles some firms concerned that local judges are often susceptible to bribes or intimidation, oil company executives and former officials say."
Exxon,2017-11,"""It's a fight for the oil and gas dollar now, and if the companies aren't treated fairly, then there's lots of other places to go,"" said Craig Steinke, head of Canada-based Renaissance Oil Corp , a company that has won five onshore contracts in Mexico."
Exxon,2017-11,"Even under the oil contracts' administrative withdrawal clause, companies are entitled to an audience to present their case, the participation of an independent expert and there are no one-person decisions, said Juan Carlos Zepeda, head of oil regulator CNH, which is in charge of supervising the contracts."
Exxon,2017-11,"Energy Minister Pedro Joaquin Coldwell told Reuters that even without NAFTA protections, respect for due process was embedded in Mexico's legal system.

Exxon,2017-11,"HOUSTON, Nov 2 (Reuters) - A 78,000 barrel-per-day (bpd) reformer was heavily damaged in a fire at ExxonMobil Corp's 502,500 bpd Baton Rouge, Louisiana, refinery, sources familiar with plant operations said on Thursday. A leak was being repaired on the unit when the fire broke out early on Wednesday, the sources said."
Exxon,2017-11,"There is no timeline for repairing the reformer, which is called the Powerformer."
Exxon,2017-11,An Exxon spokeswoman did not reply to a request for comment.
Exxon,2017-11,"Early on Wednesday morning, the reformer, which converts refining by-products into octane-boosting components of gasoline, was roped off due to the leak when the fire broke out, the sources said."
Exxon,2017-11,"The refinery's 210,000 bpd crude distillation unit (CDU), the largest of four doing the primary refining of crude oil and providing feedstocks for all other units, was taken out of production to stop the flow of feed to the reformer shortly after the fire erupted."

Exxon,2017-11,"NEW YORK, Nov 2 (Reuters) - Valero Energy was buying gasoline cargoes for spot delivery in the U.S. East Coast after an outage at its 270,000 barrels per day (bpd) Pembroke refinery in Wales earlier this week, two trade sources said on Thursday."
Exxon,2017-11,"Valero, the largest U.S. independent refiner, typically sells gasoline barrels from their Pembroke refinery into the New York Harbor market, traders said."
Exxon,2017-11,"Exxon Mobil was also buying prompt gasoline barrels in the New York harbor on Thursday, traders said."
Exxon,2017-11,"The purchases come as supplies in the U.S. East Coast have been squeezed amid lower transatlantic imports and fewer barrels being sent via pipeline from the Gulf Coast refining hub. U.S. Midwest prices have also soared, pulling barrels away from the New York harbor. [nL4N1N16XB]"
Exxon,2017-11,Gasoline prices in the New York Harbor have surged and traded about 6 cents a gallon above benchmark futures for delivery in December on the New York Mercantile Exchange on Thursday.
Exxon,2017-11,"The U.S. gasoline crack spread - a key metric in refining margins - continues to surge above five-year highs seasonally. It rose as much as 7.7 percent to $20.27 a barrel on Thursday, after ending the session at around $19.79."
Exxon,2017-11,"The 90,000 bpd fluid catalytic converter (FCC) at Pembroke was shut unexpectedly earlier this week, three trade sources said. It was not immediately clear what caused the shutdown or when the unit would be restarted."
Exxon,2017-11,"Traders said Valero was also looking to sell vacuum gasoil, the feedstock used to feed the FCC."
Exxon,2017-11,A spokeswoman for the refinery declined to comment on the plant's day to day operations.
Exxon,2017-11,"Valero purchased the prompt barrels at 6 cents per gallon above benchmark futures, one East Coast trader said. Exxon, meanwhile, did not ship barrels over from Europe, prompting the company to buy barrels in the Philadelphia region and move it west since its Joliet plant was down."
Exxon,2017-11,"Exxon said last week planned maintenance is continuing on several units at the 238,600 bpd Joliet, Illinois refinery. [nFWN1N01DR]"

Exxon,2017-11,Quarter of oil refineries risk closure under climate goals -report - Reuters News
Exxon,2017-11,"{{20171102T000101.058+0000}}Quarter of oil refineries risk closure under climate goals -report* Refining profits to shrivel as demand drops, report says"
Exxon,2017-11,"LONDON, Nov 2 (Reuters) - A quarter of the world's oil refineries risk closure by 2035 if governments meet targets to limit fossil fuel burning in the fight against global warming, a report released on Thursday said."
Exxon,2017-11,"A surge in electric vehicle sales and higher efficiency in internal combustion and jet engines are expected to slow demand growth for fuels such as gasoline, diesel and aviation fuel in the coming decades, potentially putting pressure on refining profits."
Exxon,2017-11,"At the same time, governments around the world are set to introduce legislation in the coming years to limit emissions of heat-capturing carbon dioxide into the atmosphere in order to meet targets set at a U.N-backed Paris conference in 2015."
Exxon,2017-11,"As a result, companies such as Chevron , Royal Dutch Shell , France' Total and China's largest refiner Sinopec could see profits from refining drop by 70 percent or more over the period, according to the report co-authored by environment thinktank Carbon Tracker, Swedish investment fund AP7 and Danish pension fund PKA."
Exxon,2017-11,The study is based on the International Energy Agency's 450 Scenario to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius under which oil demand declines by 23 percent between 2020 and 2035.
Exxon,2017-11,"Under this scenario, despite new refinery additions in Asia and the Middle East, only 62 percent of global capacity will be required to meet demand compared with around 80 percent today. Profits from converting crude oil into refined products will also shrink."
Exxon,2017-11,"That in turn means that approximately one quarter of the 2016 refining capacity, the equivalent of some 24.7 million barrels per day of oil demand, will need to be closed, the report said."
Exxon,2017-11,"The closures would likely be more pronounced in developed economies where oil demand is expected to peak earlier than in developing economies. Also, modern, complex refineries that can produce more high quality and cleaner fuels are likely to fare better than older plants."
Exxon,2017-11,"""The consequences of achieving a 2 degree Celsius world are far more detrimental to the refining sector than the upstream sector, as it results in structural over-capacity and associated poor refining margin environment, which can only be addressed by sustained capacity rationalisation,"" said Alan Gelder, vice president for research at Edinburgh-based consultancy Wood Mackenzie which took part in the report."
Exxon,2017-11,Meeting the emission reduction targets however seems distant today. A report published on Tuesday said global emissions are set to be 30 percent higher than the target needed by 2030.[nL8N1N640X]
Exxon,2017-11,"While oil companies including Shell have acknowledged that demand for some fuels such as gasoline could peak by the end of the 2020s, they expect demand for oil to remain strong for decades from heavy transport, aviation and chemical production."
Exxon,2017-11,"The authors of the report estimate that overall earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) for refiners could fall by over 50 percent by 2035 from around $147 billion in 2015."
Exxon,2017-11,"""We consider that prospective investors should be wary of all new refinery investments,"" the report said."
Exxon,2017-11,"""When demand growth stalls and turns negative, new investments will carry the risk of failing to earn an adequate return."""
Exxon,2017-11,Carbon Tracker and a group of investors warned in a report earlier this year that oil giants risk spending trillions by 2025 on oil and gas projects that won't be feasible under the international climate targets. [nL8N1JI1P9]

Exxon,2017-11,This is the second fire on a unit involved in gasoline production in the past year at the refinery.
Exxon,2017-11,"On Nov. 22, 2016, a fire broke out in the alkylation unit when workers disassembled a valve. Four workers were critically injured in the blaze. In May, the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration fined Exxon $165,000 for safety violations."

Exxon,2017-11,{{20171101T064826.194+0000}}UPDATE 2-Australia's Oil Search buys into promising Alaska oil find* Spain's Repsol sees field holding 1.2 bln barrels of oil
Exxon,2017-11,"MELBOURNE, Nov 1 (Reuters) - Australia's Oil Search Ltd has agreed to buy stakes in a huge oil find in Alaska for $400 million, in a surprise push to diversify from its sweet spot of gas in Papua New Guinea."
Exxon,2017-11,"Oil Search will pick up stakes in three oil blocks from privately owned U.S. firms Armstrong Energy and GMT Exploration giving it a roughly 26 percent holding in the Nanushuk play, co-owned by Spain's Repsol SA ."
Exxon,2017-11,"The play includes the Horseshoe block, which hit oil in March in what Repsol called the biggest U.S. onshore find in 30 years. It estimated the field could hold 1.2 billion barrels. [nFWN1GM0QP]"
Exxon,2017-11,"Oil Search bought in assuming the field holds 500 million barrels, expecting production to begin in 2023, with output to plateau at 80,000 to 120,000 barrels per day."
Exxon,2017-11,"""With the quality of the assets, the fact that they're tier 1, and the fact that we've gone in very conservatively against what Repsol are saying, I think we can demonstrate to the market that this will be a super deal for Oil Search in the medium term,"" Oil Search Chief Executive Peter Botten told Reuters."
Exxon,2017-11,"Investors were nervous about the $8 billion company's move into a region where it has no experience and which is dominated by giants like BP and ExxonMobil Corp , sending its shares down 3 percent, especially after it gave up on a push into Kurdistan."
Exxon,2017-11,Other Australian oil and gas producers rose more than 1 percent on Wednesday.
Exxon,2017-11,"""Questions will inevitably be asked about Oil Search's competitive advantage to play in Alaska until it proves its operational capability there,"" said Saul Kavonic, an analyst with energy consultants Wood Mackenzie."
Exxon,2017-11,"RBC analyst Ben Wilson said the move was well-timed near the bottom of the oil price cycle and with some of the appraisal work on the field already done. He said it had ""good prospects"" as the oil was high-grade."
Exxon,2017-11,"Botten began working on the deal eight months ago when oil prices were about 20 percent lower than now and said Oil Search managed to get the asset despite higher-priced interest from others in nearby fields, whom he declined to name."
Exxon,2017-11,"The owners of the neighbouring fields are ConocoPhillips , ExxonMobil and Italy's ENI ."
Exxon,2017-11,Oil Search has the option of doubling its stake in the Alaskan assets for a further $450 million. It plans to fund the deal from its cash reserves.
Exxon,2017-11,Oil Search will work with oilfield services giant Halliburton Co and Armstrong before taking over as operator of the assets in June 2018.

Exxon,2017-11,"ATHENS, Oct 31 (Reuters) - A consortium led by France's Total moved a step closer to exploring for oil and gas off Greece after signing a lease on Tuesday with the government for a block in the Ionian Sea."
Exxon,2017-11,Greece wants to tap into its limited oil reserves to reduce dependence on oil imports and boost public finances.
Exxon,2017-11,"It awarded the contract to the Total consortium, which also includes Greece's biggest oil refiner Hellenic Petroleum and Italy's Edison , in October 2016."
Exxon,2017-11,"""Undoubtedly it is a vote of confidence in the Greek economy,"" Energy Minister George Stathakis said of the agreement on Tuesday."
Exxon,2017-11,"Total will operate the block with a 50 percent stake, while Edison and Hellenic Petroleum will each hold 25 percent. The agreement must be ratified by Greece's parliament before exploration work can begin."
Exxon,2017-11,"Western Greece is a frontier, underexplored area and very little data exists on its hydrocarbon potential."
Exxon,2017-11,"Bernard Clement, a senior Total executive for the Caspian and Southern Europe, said it would maintain ""realistic expectations"" before obtaining data."
Exxon,2017-11,Total has shown interest in the eastern Mediterranean following major gas discoveries off Israel and Egypt. It is currently drilling for oil off Cyprus.
Exxon,2017-11,"Together with Hellenic Petroleum in a consortium led by U.S. oil major Exxon Mobil , Total has also expressed interest in exploration at two sites off Crete, prompting Greece to launch a tender."
Exxon,2017-11,"Greece, like other European countries, relies on Russian gas imports which account for over 60 percent of supplies. Russia covers about a third of Greece's oil needs."
Exxon,2017-11,Athens also wants to attract investment into the oil industry as it tries to emerge from years of economic crisis.
Exxon,2017-11,"During a meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump this month, Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras said Athens wanted U.S. investment in energy too, and it planned to set up a taskforce to overcome red tape."
Exxon,2017-11,"""It helps a lot to keep the bureaucracy moving if you have a clear message from the top that the answer to investors should be 'Yes',"" U.S. ambassador to Greece, Geoffrey Pyatt, told Reuters."
Exxon,2017-11,"Greece has one LNG terminal off Athens, where it imports Algerian gas, but an official at state-run gas firm DEPA said it plans to invite U.S. companies to ship LNG there for the first time."
Exxon,2017-11,"It is also developing a floating storage and regasification unit (FSRU) off Alexandroupolis, a city close to the Turkish and Bulgarian borders near where EU-backed pipelines are being built to cut reliance on Russian gas."
Exxon,2017-11,"""Our vision for Greece (is) as a European energy hub,"" said Pyatt, a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine."
Exxon,2017-11,"The FSRU, with an estimated annual capacity of 6.1 billion cubic metres, will seek to supply gas to southeastern Europe via the Interconnector Greece-Bulgaria (IGB) pipeline, which is due to begin construction next year."
Exxon,2017-11,"The IGB and the FSRU could be connected to the Trans-Adriatic Pipeline which is being built to carry Caspian gas to European markets, which currently depends on Russian oil giant Gazprom for a third of its supply."
Exxon,2017-11,"""You have several American companies that are looking at the FSRU,"" Pyatt said. ""We very much hope to see an American company also become involved."""
