tesla,2017-4,"April 28 (Reuters) - Apple Inc urged California to toughen up its proposed policy on testing self-driving cars, a move that would result in more public data that could help Apple catch up to rivals in the self-driving space by giving it a better window into their strengths and weaknesses."
tesla,2017-4,"In a letter made public on Friday, Apple suggested a series of changes to the draft policy that is under development and said it looks forward to working with California and others ""so that rapid technology development may be realized while ensuring the safety of the traveling public."""
tesla,2017-4,"Waymo, the self-driving car unit of Google parent company Alphabet Inc , Ford Motor Co , Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL], Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T>, Tesla Motors Inc and others also filed comments suggesting changes."
tesla,2017-4,California said on Tuesday it would review comments before deciding whether to make changes to the policy that aims to allow companies to test vehicles without traditional steering wheels and controls or human back-up drivers. [nL1N1HY1XM]
tesla,2017-4,The state is at the forefront of a crowded race to develop self-driving vehicles and the proposed changes from automakers and technology companies help provide insight into current efforts.
tesla,2017-4,"In its letter, Apple said California should revise how companies report self-driving system ""disengagements."" California currently requires companies to report how many times the self-driving system was deactivated and control handed back to humans because of a system failure or a situation tied to traffic, weather or road conditions that required human intervention for safety reasons."
tesla,2017-4,"But Apple wants those rules to extend to humans stepping in to prevent even minor traffic violations. Apple contends the reporting rules as written leave too much wiggle room for car makers and ""caused public confusion and misunderstanding,"" wrote Steve Kenner, Apple's director of product integrity."
tesla,2017-4,Apple also asked regulators to revisit language around the definition of an autonomous vehicle to clarify that permits are required in advanced systems even when a safety driver is present.
tesla,2017-4,The exact wording around when permits are needed became a sticking point between Uber and state officials last year when the California Department of Motor Vehicles ordered Uber to cease its self-driving tests in San Francisco.
tesla,2017-4,"Apple also said the state's rules for development vehicles used only in testing could ""restrict both the design and equipment that can be used in test vehicles."""
tesla,2017-4,"A late entrant to the self-driving race, Apple secured a permit earlier this month to test autonomous vehicles in California. Although it has never openly acknowledged it is looking into building a car, Apple has recruited dozens of auto experts. The company declined to comment on Friday."
tesla,2017-4,"Tesla said California should not bar testing of autonomous vehicles that are 10,000 pounds (4,535 kg) or more, a move that Apple also joined. Tesla said such a move could ""stifle innovation,"" and bar a company from testing a heavy autonomous vehicle that might be used to haul parts on private property rather than on public roads, pushing developers in this sector out of the state."
tesla,2017-4,"Elon Musk, chief executive of Tesla, in 2016 announced plans for new electric vehicles, including a commercial truck called the Tesla Semi and a public transport bus. The electric vehicle pioneer said earlier this month it plans to unveil a commercial truck in September."
tesla,2017-4,"Tesla also said California should not prohibit the sale of non-self-driving vehicles previously used for autonomous vehicle testing. Tesla said that under the proposal, if it loads a vehicle with autonomous testing software and then replaces it with conventional production software it could be barred from selling the vehicle."
tesla,2017-4,"Uber said California should allow paying members of the public to ride in autonomous vehicles with drivers, saying: ""There is no reason to deny those riders an opportunity to travel in an autonomous test vehicle and provide honest feedback."""
tesla,2017-4,"Lyft Inc, a ride-hailing service rival of Uber, asked the state to remove a requirement that it notify local authorities of autonomous vehicle testing."
tesla,2017-4,"Waymo asked California to remove its liability proposal. On Tuesday, General Motors Co had said the state's proposed liability rules could make automakers liable regardless of fault for any crash. GM also said that automakers should be allowed to reuse autonomous vehicles and parts after testing or if the vehicle is scrapped."
tesla,2017-4,Volkswagen AG and Daimler AG submitted joint comments seeking changes to the extent of data required to be retained in crashes involving self-driving cars.
tesla,2017-4,"A number of automakers have said they plan to begin deploying self-driving vehicles, some in commercial fleets, by 2020-21."

tesla,2017-4,"DETROIT, April 28 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc needs to complete fixing its Model S sedan emergency braking system to regain Consumer Reports' top safety rating, the magazine said on Friday, noting that a recent update by the luxury electric car maker was not enough."
tesla,2017-4,"The magazine, which provides an annual rating of vehicles sold in the United States, said on Wednesday the sedan had lost its top ranking in the ultra-luxury car category for failing to install the feature that it had promised to owners as standard equipment. [nL1N1HY0B2]"
tesla,2017-4,The Model S fell to third place in Consumer Reports' ratings behind the Lexus LS made by Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T> and the BMW 7 Series .
tesla,2017-4,"Consumer Reports said both Tesla models previously came with standard automatic emergency braking (AEB), a feature that helps reduce accidents. The software issue affects more recent vehicles built since late October 2016."
tesla,2017-4,"The magazine said Friday that the Model S sedan it owns had received an automatic emergency braking software update Thursday, but the new version only operates up to 28 miles per hour (45 km)."
tesla,2017-4,That is far less than the current 90 mile per hour limit for the prior Tesla AEB system included on vehicles built before late October.
tesla,2017-4,"The magazine cited a statement from Tesla that ""over the next several weeks"" the car maker would increase the speed limit ""until it is the most capable of any vehicle in the world."""

tesla,2017-4,April 28 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc on Friday said that its subsidiary SolarCity will curtail door-to-door sales of rooftop solar installations over the next month as Tesla seeks to absorb the company into its high-end brand.
tesla,2017-4,"The move comes at a time when growth in sales of residential solar systems has slowed in key states, including California, where Tesla is based. Industry watchers say consumers in more mature solar markets have tired of the industry's aggressive sales tactics."
tesla,2017-4,"""We believe this decision reflects what most of our prospective customers prefer, and will result in a better experience for them,"" a Tesla spokesperson said in an emailed statement."
tesla,2017-4,"Tesla has built its luxury electric car brand on exclusivity, whereas SolarCity marketed its systems to a wide range of consumers mainly by promising cost savings."
tesla,2017-4,"As a result, the move marks a major shift for SolarCity, which before its acquisition by Tesla had become the nation's top solar installer by amassing a legion of sales representatives in solar-friendly states across the country. Though most sales are generated through customer referrals, door-to-door sales became a significant means of reaching new customers over the last three years."
tesla,2017-4,"Most affected employees will be reassigned to other sales channels or given the opportunity to interview for other positions, Tesla said. About 1,000 people work in door-to-door sales for the company."
tesla,2017-4,"The company said it plans to expand its retail and online sales of solar systems, including in Tesla stores. It will also continue selling systems through long-standing partnerships with retailers, including Home Depot and Best Buy Co Inc ."
tesla,2017-4,"""We expect the growth of these channels to end up more than offsetting the loss of door-to-door sales,"" Tesla said."
tesla,2017-4,"Tesla, which completed its acquisition of SolarCity in November, has repeatedly said that it would prioritize preserving cash over increasing sales of solar systems. It has also said that it would reduce the cost of acquiring new customers, a metric that has remained stubbornly high across the highly competitive industry."
tesla,2017-4,"In keeping with its move toward more distinctive solar offerings, Tesla has said it plans to roll out a line of solar roof tiles later this year. The solar-powered roof shingles were unveiled last October to showcase the benefits of combining Elon Musk's electric car maker with the solar installer."

But that gain has since shrunk to 17 percent, according to Vincent Deluard, Vice President, Global Macro Strategy at INTL FCStone Financial Inc."
tesla,2017-4,"Investors bet big on steel right out of the gate after Election Day, with the industry seen as a poster child for Trump's focus on ""unfair"" trade deals that hurt U.S. producers. The S&P 1500 steel industry group index <.SPCOMSTEEL> had gained 36 percent by the first week of December."
tesla,2017-4,"The group is down by more than 13 percent since then, however, and even last week's executive order to investigate whether U.S. steel companies need additional trade protections under the auspices of national security delivered only a short-lived rebound.

tesla,2017-4,"The Silicon Valley luxury electric carmaker is counting on Grohmann Engineering's automation and engineering expertise to help it ramp up production to 500,000 cars per year by 2018."

tesla,2017-4,"""I definitely did not depart because I had lost interest in working,"" Grohmann said, without elaborating."

tesla,2017-4,"""Part of Mr Grohmann's decision to work with Tesla was to prepare for his retirement and leave the company in capable hands for the future. Given the change in focus to Tesla projects, we mutually decided that it was the right time for the next generation of management to lead."""

tesla,2017-4,"The management layer below Klaus Grohmann is continuing his work, they told Reuters. But they said parts of the workforce felt insecure about becoming so dependent on one client after the founder's departure."
tesla,2017-4,"Last year, Tesla had said: ""Under the continued leadership of Mr Grohmann, several critical elements of Tesla's automated manufacturing systems will be designed and produced in Pruem, to help make our factories the most advanced in the world."""
tesla,2017-4,"""Our factories are so important that we believe they will ultimately deserve an order of magnitude more attention in engineering than what they produce. At very high production volumes, the factory becomes more of a product than the product itself,"" Tesla said at the time."
tesla,2017-4,"Tesla started out as a client of Grohmann Engineering, a small unlisted company based in Pruem, near the Luxembourg border, that helped companies design highly automated factories, a source familiar with the company told Reuters."
tesla,2017-4,"As pressure grew to increase production volumes at Tesla, Musk decided to buy Grohmann Engineering and make Pruem a base for Tesla Advanced Automation."

tesla,2017-4,"Since the takeover, Tesla has given job guarantees and pay rises to the firm's 700 employees in the small town of Pruem close to the Belgian border, under threat of strike action organised by IG Metall, the powerful labour union which dominates Volkswagen ."
tesla,2017-4,"The union said job guarantees and the offer of employee stock options have significantly reduced the prospect of a strike. Still, IG Metall is demanding a collective wage bargaining contract and improved pay. The union has complained that pay at Grohmann is 25 to 30 percent below an industry-wide collective agreement for the metalworker electric industry."
tesla,2017-4,"The head of Grohmann's works council, Uwe Herzig, said Tesla had offered another 1,000 euro ($1,089) one-off payment after Easter, on top of job guarantees, pay rises and stock options."
tesla,2017-4,"In March Tesla offered employees a pay raise of 150 euros a month. This was followed up just before Easter with an offer of 10,000 euros in stock options for four years, and a pledge to guarantee jobs for five years, Herzig said."
tesla,2017-4,"Herzig said Klaus Grohmann, under whose leadership Tesla had planned to run the business, retired at the end of last month."
tesla,2017-4,"""In November we were told that everything would remain the same, and then on March 31 we were surprised to hear that he will retire,"" Herzig told a news conference, adding Klaus Grohmann had not been seen at the company since then."

tesla,2017-4,"The union wants to see Tesla's management adopt pay agreements and negotiating tactics more in line with what other workers in the metalworking industry are getting. Herzig said Tesla's acquisition of Grohmann made many workers leery that the company would now stop doing work for other customers, making it too dependent on Tesla's fortunes."
tesla,2017-4,"""We want additional guarantees given in more formal ways as an additional assurance to the workforce some parts of which need reassuring given the recent changes,"" Herzig told Reuters."

tesla,2017-4,April 24 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc Chief Executive Elon Musk took many risks with the technology in his company's cars on the way to surpassing Ford Motor Co's market value.
tesla,2017-4,Now Musk is pushing boundaries in the factory that makes them.
tesla,2017-4,"Most automakers test a new model's production line by building vehicles with relatively cheap, prototype tools designed to be scrapped once they deliver doors that fit, body panels with the right shape and dashboards that don't have gaps or seams."
tesla,2017-4,"Tesla, however, is skipping that preliminary step and ordering permanent, more expensive equipment as it races to launch its Model 3 sedan by a self-imposed volume production deadline of September, Musk told investors last month."
tesla,2017-4,"Musk's decision underscores his high-risk tolerance and willingness to forego long-held industry norms that has helped Tesla upend the traditional auto industry. While Tesla is not the first automaker to try to accelerate production on the factory floor, no other rival is putting this much faith in the production strategy succeeding."
tesla,2017-4,"Musk expects the Model 3 rollout to help Telsa deliver five times its current annual sales volume, a key target in the automaker's efforts to stop burning cash."
tesla,2017-4,"""He's pushing the envelope to see how much time and cost he can take out of the process,"" said Ron Harbour, a manufacturing consultant at Oliver Wyman."
tesla,2017-4,"Investors are already counting on Tesla's factory floor success, with shares soaring 39 percent since January as it makes the leap from niche producer to mass producer in far less time than rivals."
tesla,2017-4,"There are caution signs, however. The production equipment designed to produce millions of cars is expensive to fix or replace if it doesn't work, industry experts say. Tesla has encountered quality problems on its existing low-volume cars, and the Model 3 is designed to sell in numbers as high as 500,000 vehicles a year, raising the potential cost of recalls or warranty repairs."
tesla,2017-4,"""It's an experiment, certainly,"" said Consumer Reports' Jake Fisher, who has done extensive testing of Tesla's previous Models S and X. Tesla could possibly fix errors quicker, speeding up the process, ""or it could be they have unsuspected problems they'll have a hard time dealing with."""
tesla,2017-4,Tesla declined to confirm details of the call or comment on its production strategy.
tesla,2017-4,"An Audi executive involved in the Mexican plant launch, Peter Hochholdinger, is now Tesla's vice president of production."
tesla,2017-4,"Typically, automakers test their design with limited production using lower grade equipment that can be modified slightly to address problems. When most of the kinks are worked out, they order the final equipment."
tesla,2017-4,"Tesla's decision to move directly to the final tools is in part because lower grade, disposable equipment known as ""soft tooling"" ended up complicating the debut of the problem-plagued Model X SUV in 2015, according to a person familiar with the decision and Tesla's assembly line planning."
tesla,2017-4,"Working on a tight deadline, Tesla had no time to incorporate lessons learned from soft tooling before having to order the permanent production tooling, making the former's value negligible, the source said."
tesla,2017-4,"""Soft tooling did very little for the program and arguably hurt things,"" said the person."
tesla,2017-4,"In addition, Tesla has learned to better modify final production tools, and its 2015 purchase of a Michigan tooling company means it can make major equipment 30 percent faster than before, and more cheaply as well, the source said."
tesla,2017-4,"Financial pressure is partly driving Tesla's haste. The quicker Tesla can deliver the Model 3 with its estimated $35,000 base price to the 373,000 customers who have put down a $1000 deposit, the closer it can log $13 billion."
tesla,2017-4,"Tesla has labored under financial pressure since it was founded in 2003. The company has yet to turn an annual profit, and earlier this year Musk said the company was ""close to the edge"" as it look toward capital spending of $2-2.5 billion in the first half of 2017."

tesla,2017-4,"Musk has spoken to investors about his vision of an ""alien dreadnought"" factory that uses artificial intelligence and robots to build cars at speeds faster than human assembly workers could manage."
tesla,2017-4,"But there are limits to what technology can do in the heavily regulated car business. For example, Tesla will still have to use real cars in crash tests required by the U.S. government, because federal rules do not allow simulated crash results to substitute for data from a real car."

tesla,2017-4,{{20170421T085603.683+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-How tech pushed finance into a status crisis(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.)
tesla,2017-4,"LONDON, April 21 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Being number one doesn't just matter for individuals. It has profound importance for industries, too. Before the financial crisis, investment banking was the clear career of choice for MBA graduates enticed by the prospect of money, power and prestige. Now they're more likely to start out for Silicon Valley. Banking has lost its alpha-ness."
tesla,2017-4,"Influence, the other classic mark of status, has also passed from finance to tech. True, former bankers like Gary Cohn and Steve Bannon dominate the White House. But SpaceX and Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk is on President Donald Trump's business advisory group, as for a while was Uber Technologies' Travis Kalanick. Influence draws detractors as well as friends. Apple's run-in with Europe's antitrust tsar Margrethe Vestager marked tech out as the regulatory world's new nemesis."
tesla,2017-4,"Tech companies have even adopted that other modern sign of eminence: a belief that rapid growth justifies being mean to workers. Google has been accused by the U.S. Department of Labor for extreme pay discrimination, though the search giant says its analysis gives it confidence that the company has no gender pay gap. A recent internal diversity report by Uber revealed a shortage of women and minorities."
tesla,2017-4,"There is consolation for finance in all of this. Reaching post-status makes companies better places to work. To retain millennials, and prodded into action by the death of a Bank of America Merrill Lynch intern in 2013, the industry has made soothing-sounding concessions, letting staff spend the odd weekend unmolested. No such joy for coders. A biography of Musk quotes him asking rhetorically whether 10 hours a week is sufficient time to spend with a spouse."
tesla,2017-4,"The upshot is that even if banking isn't the career choice it once was, the industry is no worse for it. By stealing its status anxiety, the tech sector has done those who work in finance a favour."
tesla,2017-4,"- Former Google self-driving arm Waymo paid ex-engineer Anthony Levandowski $120 million in incentive payments, according to court filings reported by Reuters on April 3."
tesla,2017-4,"- The payout emerged as part of a lawsuit in which Waymo says that Levandowski stole confidential files when he left the company to found Otto, a subsidiary of ride-hailing firm Uber."

tesla,2017-4,"SHANGHAI, April 19 (Reuters) - It's not due to arrive in China until next year, but already Chinese-funded, smart, connected plug-in car start-ups are scrambling to launch cars to go head-to-head against Tesla Inc's ""mass market"" Model 3 sedan."
tesla,2017-4,"For leading Chinese electric vehicle (EV) start-ups such as Future Mobility, WM Motor and Singulato Motors, the key is that they will produce their cars locally, making them better able to match the Model 3's price."
tesla,2017-4,"Tesla, which has largely enjoyed a monopoly in the premium electric car market, is expected to price its Model 3 from $35,000 in the United States. Buyers in China would expect to add 25 percent to that in import tariffs."
tesla,2017-4,"The founders and CEOs of Future Mobility, WM Motor and Singulato acknowledge the Model 3 is the car to beat."
tesla,2017-4,"The first vehicles they aim to launch in the next couple of years will be priced around 300,000 yuan (roughly $43,500) or below, they told Reuters ahead of the Shanghai auto show, which opens to the public on Friday."
tesla,2017-4,"""Between 200,000 yuan and 300,000 yuan,"" said Singulato's co-founder and CEO Shen Haiyin."
tesla,2017-4,The Chinese-funded firms' strategy is to beat the Model 3 in China by making their cars more premium and yet cheaper than Tesla's mass-market all-electric battery car.
tesla,2017-4,"The three start-ups see California-based Tesla's weakness in its inability to produce cars in China, the world's leading market for plug-in cars."
tesla,2017-4,"Tesla has denied recent talk in China that it was considering manufacturing its cars locally. ""Tesla is deeply committed to the Chinese market, however these rumours are not true,"" the company said."
tesla,2017-4,"To be sure, Tesla will be no pushover. It this month overtook Ford Motor Co in market value as investors embrace CEO Elon Musk's strategy of offering stylish, high performance cars that are continually upgraded with features that rival automakers are still only testing."
tesla,2017-4,"Tesla has to date competed only in premium price classes at relatively low volumes. The Model 3 will need to appeal to more price-sensitive consumers to reach its projected annual sales of 500,000 vehicles."
tesla,2017-4,"Daniel Kirchert, president and co-founder of Future Mobility, says his company plans to launch three models. The first, a premium midsize crossover sport-utility vehicle (SUV), will arrive ""before 2020"", followed within three years by a sedan and a 7-seater multi-purpose vehicle (MPV)."
tesla,2017-4,"All will be based on the same vehicle underpinning architecture and share major components, ""to achieve this very attractive entry price of about 300,000 yuan,"" Kirchert told Reuters in a telephone interview."
tesla,2017-4,"""It's a bit more than $40,000, a very competitive price positioning ... because Tesla customers buying the Model 3 in China would have to shoulder the cost of a 25 percent import tariff on the car"", unless it's produced in China, he said."
tesla,2017-4,"""We will be competitive because we produce the car locally,"" he added."
tesla,2017-4,"As well as making its car in China, at a planned assembly plant in Nanjing, Kirchert said Future Mobility plans to make the SUV bigger than the Model 3 and more luxurious."
tesla,2017-4,"""In the end, it's really about how premium you are. That's the real challenge."""
tesla,2017-4,"Singulato Motors unveiled its first ""mass-production"" car, also a crossover SUV, in Beijing last week, and says it will be priced below 300,000 yuan. It has started taking pre-orders for a limited period from customers willing to put down a deposit of 2,017 yuan."
tesla,2017-4,"WM Motor plans to launch its first car, an electric plug-in crossover SUV, in the second half of 2018, again priced to compete with the Model 3, co-founder Freeman Shen told Reuters."
tesla,2017-4,"The car will be the first of three electric vehicles the Shanghai-based firm plans to launch by 2020, by which time Shen says WM Motor should be selling around 100,000 cars a year."
tesla,2017-4,"WM Motor showed a concept car to reporters on Tuesday in Shanghai, which Shen said hinted at the mass market model. The company aims to get the car to showrooms by September 2018."

tesla,2017-4,"The system, which was installed at two separate Southern California Edison ""peaker"" plants this month, will give the utility increased flexibility as the large amounts of renewable wind and solar power required by state mandates have made energy generation cleaner but far less predictable."

tesla,2017-4,"Southern California Edison's president, Ron Nichols, said at an event to unveil the hybrid electric gas turbine in Norwalk, California that the new system would cut plant startups in half and reduce total run hours by 60 percent."

tesla,2017-4,"California is requiring its utilities to source half of their electricity needs from renewable sources by 2030. At the same time, the state has required procurement of energy storage systems to help integrate those renewables. Southern California Edison has brought several energy storage projects online, including a large Tesla Inc battery earlier this year."

tesla,2017-4,"DETROIT/BOSTON, April 12 (Reuters) - Greenlight Capital nominated three directors to General Motors Co's board on Wednesday and accused the company of misrepresenting to ratings agencies the prominent hedge fund's proposal to split the automaker's common stock into two classes."
tesla,2017-4,Greenlight manager David Einhorn told Reuters on Wednesday the automaker has refused to allow him to present his proposal to credit agencies for a formal review of how the plan would affect the company's credit risk.
tesla,2017-4,"""We think the credit rating process has been unfairly manipulated,"" Einhorn said. ""We call on GM to allow us to work directly with the credit rating agencies."""
tesla,2017-4,"GM fired back that any suggestion the automaker had failed to share Greenlight's proposal in full with the ratings agencies was ""baseless and irresponsible."""
tesla,2017-4,"Einhorn went public with a proposal in late March that the U.S. automaker create one class of stock that pays a dividend and one that does not, but would be tied to GM's potential growth. [nL3N1H54NI]"
tesla,2017-4,"The move would lower the company's cost of capital, improve financial flexibility and boost market capitalization by as much as $38 billion, Einhorn said."
tesla,2017-4,"No other GM shareholder has yet backed Einhorn's proposal, with Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc remaining conspicuously silent."
tesla,2017-4,"GM has rebuffed Einhorn's proposal, saying it would not help the automaker ""sell more cars, drive higher profitability, or generate greater cash flow."" Both Moody's and Standard & Poor's have declared such a structure could hurt its credit rating."
tesla,2017-4,"When asked whether Einhorn's claims on Wednesday changed anything, an S&P Global Ratings spokesman referred Reuters to the agency's previous opinion from late March."
tesla,2017-4,"The views of the rating agencies are a key element in the proxy fight that will play out over the next several weeks, unless GM and Einhorn can reach a settlement."
tesla,2017-4,"In the interview, Einhorn said his plan would also allow GM to preserve more of its cash reserves, at a time when some analysts are concerned the U.S. auto industry is heading into a cyclical slowdown."
tesla,2017-4,"""Our proposal is an elegant way to unlock that kind of value without drawing on the cash resources of the company,"" Einhorn said."
tesla,2017-4,"Greenlight Capital has owned GM shares on and off for five years and now has a 4.9 percent stake, including options."
tesla,2017-4,GM stock has performed poorly versus its peers and compared with the broader market. GM shares traded on Wednesday afternoon at $34 - just a dollar above the IPO price when the company went public in 2010 after a government-led bankruptcy.
tesla,2017-4,"The disagreement became a full-fledged proxy fight on Wednesday as Greenlight said GM's advisers had no interest ""in performing an objective analysis"" of Einhorn's proposal."
tesla,2017-4,"In a regulatory filing, Greenlight said GM had then ""substantially altered"" the term sheet for its proposal before handing it to the ratings agencies and that this different version included ""various misrepresentations"" of the plan."
tesla,2017-4,"GM said in a statement: ""The rating agencies' public statements issued regarding the Greenlight proposal clearly indicate that they understood the idea in all its facets, and would represent a credit negative if implemented. Any suggestion to the contrary is baseless and irresponsible."""
tesla,2017-4,"Greenlight on Wednesday nominated former AT&T Broadband Chief Executive Officer Leo Hindery, longtime Greenlight research director Vinit Sethi and Consol Energy Inc Chairman William Thorndike to the automaker's board of directors."
tesla,2017-4,Sethi was involved in talks with GM on Greenlight's proposal going back to last September.
tesla,2017-4,Einhorn's fund has returned an annualized 16 percent since the firm's launch in 1996 but its gains have been more muted recently with an increase of only 1.5 percent in the first three months of 2017.
tesla,2017-4,"Einhorn's fight with GM marks the first time since taking on Apple Inc in 2013 that the closely watched fund manager has pressed management publicly to make changes, taking a page from the playbooks of so-called activist hedge funds like Jana Partners and Pershing Square Capital Management."
tesla,2017-4,"GM has not yet published a date for its annual shareholder's meeting, but in previous years it has usually been held in the first half of June."
tesla,2017-4,A majority of investors surveyed by Evercore ISI just after Einhorn disclosed his proposal said it would not raise GM's value. [nL2N1H823X]

tesla,2017-4,"DETROIT/BOSTON, April 12 (Reuters) - Greenlight Capital nominated three directors to General Motors Co's board on Wednesday and accused the company of misrepresenting to ratings agencies the prominent hedge fund's proposal to split the automaker's common stock into two classes."
tesla,2017-4,Greenlight manager David Einhorn told Reuters on Wednesday the automaker has refused to allow him to present his proposal to credit agencies for a formal review of how the plan would affect the company's credit risk.
tesla,2017-4,"""We think the credit rating process has been unfairly manipulated,"" Einhorn said. ""We call on GM to allow us to work directly with the credit rating agencies."""
tesla,2017-4,"GM fired back that any suggestion the automaker had failed to share Greenlight's proposal in full with the ratings agencies was ""baseless and irresponsible."""
tesla,2017-4,"Einhorn went public with a proposal in late March that the U.S. automaker create one class of stock that pays a dividend and one that does not, but would be tied to GM's potential growth. [nL3N1H54NI]"

tesla,2017-4,"No other GM shareholder has yet backed Einhorn's proposal, with Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc remaining conspicuously silent."
tesla,2017-4,"GM has rebuffed Einhorn's proposal, saying it would not help the automaker ""sell more cars, drive higher profitability, or generate greater cash flow."" Both Moody's and Standard & Poor's have declared such a structure could hurt its credit rating."
tesla,2017-4,"When asked whether Einhorn's claims on Wednesday changed anything, an S&P Global Ratings spokesman referred Reuters to the agency's previous opinion from late March."
tesla,2017-4,"The views of the rating agencies are a key element in the proxy fight that will play out over the next several weeks, unless GM and Einhorn can reach a settlement."
tesla,2017-4,"In the interview, Einhorn said his plan would also allow GM to preserve more of its cash reserves, at a time when some analysts are concerned the U.S. auto industry is heading into a cyclical slowdown."
tesla,2017-4,"""Our proposal is an elegant way to unlock that kind of value without drawing on the cash resources of the company,"" Einhorn said."
tesla,2017-4,"Greenlight Capital has owned GM shares on and off for five years and now has a 4.9 percent stake, including options."
tesla,2017-4,GM stock has performed poorly versus its peers and compared with the broader market. GM shares traded on Wednesday afternoon at $34 - just a dollar above the IPO price when the company went public in 2010 after a government-led bankruptcy.
tesla,2017-4,"The disagreement became a full-fledged proxy fight on Wednesday as Greenlight said GM's advisers had no interest ""in performing an objective analysis"" of Einhorn's proposal."
tesla,2017-4,"In a regulatory filing, Greenlight said GM had then ""substantially altered"" the term sheet for its proposal before handing it to the ratings agencies and that this different version included ""various misrepresentations"" of the plan."
tesla,2017-4,"GM said in a statement: ""The rating agencies' public statements issued regarding the Greenlight proposal clearly indicate that they understood the idea in all its facets, and would represent a credit negative if implemented. Any suggestion to the contrary is baseless and irresponsible."""

tesla,2017-4,"U.S. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao said at the forum that the administration plans to release a legislative package in May. Investors have become more skeptical that the plan would win approval this year in Congress, which is controlled by Republicans who are traditionally wary of big spending."
tesla,2017-4,"Trump said building a highway can require dozens of approvals and take 10 to 20 years, a process he vowed to speed up. Trump said he would not fund projects that cannot be started within 90 days."
tesla,2017-4,"The administration wants to improve the electrical grid and water systems, rebuild airports, bridges, roads and potentially hospitals for military veterans and broadband."
tesla,2017-4,"National Economic Council director Gary Cohn told executives that privatizing air traffic control, which the administration proposed in its budget outline in March, ""is probably the single most exciting thing we can do."" [nL2N1GS2DS]."

tesla,2017-4,"Cohn said if cities ""sell off"" or privatize infrastructure assets, the administration could provide financial support."
tesla,2017-4,"""We're not on the cutting edge of this,"" Cohn said. ""We've got to get a little more comfortable with public-private partnerships."""
tesla,2017-4,Cohn touted an idea of electric car maker Tesla Inc CEO Elon Musk to use tunnels to speed rail transit on the densely populated east coast and also to cut traffic congestion in Los Angeles. A Tesla spokesman declined comment.

tesla,2017-4,"April 3 (Reuters) - As Tesla Inc's strong quarterly vehicle deliveries sent its stock to a record high on Monday, Chief Executive Elon Musk took a swipe at traders betting the luxury electric car company is on a road to ruin."
tesla,2017-4,"""Stormy weather in Shortville ..."", Musk tweeted after Tesla's better-than-expected quarterly vehicle deliveries announced on Sunday sent its stock surging 5.8 percent.[nL3N1HB4AL]"
tesla,2017-4,"Tesla said it delivered a record 25,418 vehicles in the quarter ended March, a 69-percent increase from last year and edging past Goldman Sachs' forecast of 23,500 vehicles.[nL2N1HA06B]"
tesla,2017-4,The Silicon Valley car maker in the past has missed production targets and its newest figures allayed fears of setbacks ahead of the hotly-awaited launch of its Model 3 sedan later this year.
tesla,2017-4,"""This beat shows that they are managing production better,"" said Ivan Feinseth, an analyst at Tigress Financial Partners."
tesla,2017-4,Monday's surge in Tesla's stock gave it a market capitalization of $48 billion - surpassing Ford Motor's $45 billion value and just below General Motor's value of $51 billion.
tesla,2017-4,"Musk is correct about the misery suffered by those betting against Tesla, a popular trade on Wall Street where skeptics say the company is in danger of being overtaken by older, deep-pocketed manufacturers like GM. Tesla proponents, meanwhile. are betting it will become a carbon-free energy and transportation heavyweight."
tesla,2017-4,"So far in 2017, Tesla short sellers have suffered paper losses of 27 percent, equivalent to $2.25 billion, according to S3 Partners, a financial analytics firm."
tesla,2017-4,"To limit their exposure, short sellers have been trimming their bets against Tesla by buying back some of the shares they shorted. But since the stock has risen quickly, up 38 percent in 2017, their overall exposure to Tesla has grown."
tesla,2017-4,"In the past two weeks, traders have reduced the total number of Tesla shares shorted by around half a million to 30.4 million. But since Tesla's stock has risen, the total value of short bets against Tesla has increased to $8.46 billion from $7.95 billion, increasing traders' overall risk, according to S3 Partners."
tesla,2017-4,"""Shorts are rebalancing their exposure on this thing on a daily or weekly basis because it can pop so quickly,"" said S3 Director Matthew Unterman."
