ConocoPhillips,2017-4,{{20170426T235152.642+0000}}UPDATE 3-Cenovus faces investor displeasure after ConocoPhillips deal(Recasts with results of shareholder vote)
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"CALGARY, Alberta, April 26 (Reuters) - Cenovus Energy Inc won about 87 percent of shareholders' votes for its board of director slate on Wednesday, below previous near-unanimous approvals, as some voters protested the company's C$17 billion ($12.6 billion) purchase of ConocoPhillips assets."
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"The deal, announced in March, effectively doubled the size of the Canadian oil company, but wiped out about a fifth of its market value, with some investors complaining that the price was too high. [nL1N1HX13U]"
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"Even as Cenovus posted better-than-expected first-quarter earnings on Wednesday, questions about the deal and Cenovus' ability to execute it dogged a conference call about the results and the shareholders meeting later that day."
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"A shareholder who wanted to be known only as Bernie told management: ""If you guys are so confident on the deal, why don't shareholders have the opportunity to vote?"""
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"Investors had been ""left out in the cold,"" he said. ""I very much resent that."""
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"Chairman Michael Grandin responded that the ""once-in-a-lifetime"" deal required confidentiality for negotiations that a shareholder vote would deny."
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"Chief Executive Brian Ferguson said the Deep Basin natural gas asset bought from ConocoPhillips, which some investors said was incompatible with Cenovus' oil business, was ""absolutely core"" to the company and could be its ""crown jewel."""
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"Cenovus could reduce spending on Deep Basin to focus on oil sands, and also sell part of that natural gas asset, he added."
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"Ferguson told media after the meeting that the roughly 87 percent vote tally reflected confidence in the deal, which is expected to close in the second quarter."
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"Cenovus plans to fund the deal partly through divestitures, mainly of its Suffield and Pelican Lake conventional oil and gas assets."
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"The company will provide more details on those in the third quarter, Ferguson said earlier on Wednesday."
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"Cenovus reported a C$211 million ($155.54 million) profit in the quarter ended March 31, helped by lower operating costs and higher production. Net profit was 25 Canadian cents per share, compared with a loss of C$118 million, or 14 Canadian cents per share, a year earlier. [nCCN7Z6bqm]"
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"Operating loss was 5 Canadian cents per share, compared with analysts' average estimate of a loss of 8 Canadian cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S."
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"Cenovus said operating costs for its oil sands fell 6 percent to C$8.97 per barrel, while total oil production rose about 19 percent to 234,914 barrels per day. ($1 = 1.3566 Canadian dollars)"

ConocoPhillips,2017-4,{{20170426T235152.642+0000}}UPDATE 3-Cenovus faces investor displeasure after ConocoPhillips deal(Recasts with results of shareholder vote)
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"CALGARY, Alberta, April 26 (Reuters) - Cenovus Energy Inc won about 87 percent of shareholders' votes for its board of director slate on Wednesday, below previous near-unanimous approvals, as some voters protested the company's C$17 billion ($12.6 billion) purchase of ConocoPhillips assets."
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"The deal, announced in March, effectively doubled the size of the Canadian oil company, but wiped out about a fifth of its market value, with some investors complaining that the price was too high. [nL1N1HX13U]"
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"Even as Cenovus posted better-than-expected first-quarter earnings on Wednesday, questions about the deal and Cenovus' ability to execute it dogged a conference call about the results and the shareholders meeting later that day."
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"A shareholder who wanted to be known only as Bernie told management: ""If you guys are so confident on the deal, why don't shareholders have the opportunity to vote?"""
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"Investors had been ""left out in the cold,"" he said. ""I very much resent that."""
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"Chairman Michael Grandin responded that the ""once-in-a-lifetime"" deal required confidentiality for negotiations that a shareholder vote would deny."
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"Chief Executive Brian Ferguson said the Deep Basin natural gas asset bought from ConocoPhillips, which some investors said was incompatible with Cenovus' oil business, was ""absolutely core"" to the company and could be its ""crown jewel."""
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"Cenovus could reduce spending on Deep Basin to focus on oil sands, and also sell part of that natural gas asset, he added."
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"Ferguson told media after the meeting that the roughly 87 percent vote tally reflected confidence in the deal, which is expected to close in the second quarter."
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"Cenovus plans to fund the deal partly through divestitures, mainly of its Suffield and Pelican Lake conventional oil and gas assets."
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"The company will provide more details on those in the third quarter, Ferguson said earlier on Wednesday."
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"Cenovus reported a C$211 million ($155.54 million) profit in the quarter ended March 31, helped by lower operating costs and higher production. Net profit was 25 Canadian cents per share, compared with a loss of C$118 million, or 14 Canadian cents per share, a year earlier. [nCCN7Z6bqm]"
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"Operating loss was 5 Canadian cents per share, compared with analysts' average estimate of a loss of 8 Canadian cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S."
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"Cenovus said operating costs for its oil sands fell 6 percent to C$8.97 per barrel, while total oil production rose about 19 percent to 234,914 barrels per day. ($1 = 1.3566 Canadian dollars)"

ConocoPhillips,2017-4,{{20170424T195118.372+0000}}PREVIEW-Cenovus earnings overshadowed by unpopular ConocoPhillips dealBy Ethan Lou and John Tilak
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"CALGARY, Alberta/TORONTO, April 24 (Reuters) - As Cenovus Energy Inc prepares to release first-quarter earnings this week, investors are looking for answers about a recent C$17 billion ($12.6 billion) acquisition that wiped out about a fifth of its market value."
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,Disgruntled shareholders will grill Cenovus at an annual meeting on Wednesday following results about its purchase of most of ConocoPhillips' Canadian oil and gas assets.
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"The deal ramped up Cenovus debt and pushed it into the largely unknown territory of natural gas, effectively doubling the size of the Canadian oil company.[nL1N1HJ17N]"
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,Some investors have questioned whether Cenovus overpaid for the assets at a time when foreign oil majors are retreating from the high-cost and heavily regulated Canadian oil sands industry.[nL3N1H65JB]
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"""It's very much going to be a show-me story,"" said Mike O'Brien, managing director and head of the Core Canadian Equity team at TD Asset Management, a shareholder. While the deal's long-term logic is sound, it is still a question of whether the company can properly execute its plan, he said."
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"Analysts expect Cenovus to post a loss of C$0.09 per share for the January-March quarter, compared with a C$0.14 per share loss a year ago, according to Thomson Reuters data. The company had higher-than-expected production for the first quarter and benefited from higher oil prices, Royal Bank of Canada analysts said."
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"Apart from the debt taken to fund the ConocoPhillips deal, investors are concerned about Cenovus' move to diversify into natural gas with the purchase of Deep Basin assets and its ability to divest to pay for the assets."
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"Benoit Gervais, portfolio manager at Mackenzie Investments, which owns Cenovus shares, said the company had no history or track record in conventional gas. ""I estimate they've overpaid by about C$5 billion,"" he said."
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,Cenovus shares fell 13.8 percent last month on news of the deal in their biggest ever single-day drop. The stock has since fallen another 5.6 percent.
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"Buying Deep Basin flies in the face of the very identity of Cenovus, which was spun-off from predecessor Encana Corp to focus on crude, said one investor, who spoke on condition of anonymity as the person was not authorized to speak publicly on the issue."
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"Still, the deal has some backers. Canada's oil-rich Alberta province, which holds a position in Cenovus through a government investment firm, said the company remained a good bet."
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"Asked about investor concerns, a Cenovus spokesman referred to Chief Executive Brian Ferguson's comments this month that the company had a ""solid plan"" to finance the transaction and cut debt using increased cash flow and assets sales."
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"Cenovus may sell parts of Deep Basin, RBC analysts said, a move that would please investors who balked at the purchase. [nL1N1HV0HX]"
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"While the transaction itself does not require a vote, some shareholders may use Wednesday's meeting to express opposition to the deal by voting against company nominations for the board of directors."
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"Cenovus reports earnings the same week as other Canadian crude producers including Suncor Energy Inc , Crescent Point Energy Corp and Exxon Mobil Corp-owned Imperial Oil Ltd ."

ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"CALGARY, Alberta, April 24 (Reuters) - Canada's Cenovus Energy Inc has said it may sell parts of the Deep Basin natural gas assets it recently bought from Houston-based ConocoPhillips , Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) analysts wrote in a research note on Sunday."
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"Cenovus Chief Executive Brian Ferguson held a conference call with analysts last Friday, and the oil company ""signaled that it would also be open to potentially monetizing some portion of the Deep Basin midstream assets,"" according to the note."
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"""Cenovus has had seven inbound calls from CEOs of various energy companies looking to ensure the company is aware of their interest in certain Deep Basin assets,"" the analysts wrote."
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,RBC acted as an advisor for Cenovus for the ConocoPhillips deal.
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,The C$17.7-billion ($13.3-billion) acquisition last month of ConocoPhillips oil and gas assets effectively doubles the size of Cenovus. But the deal dents the company's pristine balance sheet and saddles the pure-play crude producer with Deep Basin natural gas assets that some investors and analysts have said it has no business holding.
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"Cenovus shares crashed last month in their biggest single-day drop on news of the deal, which is to be funded through debt and selling shares and what the company deems to be ""non-core"" assets."
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"""Select assets within the Deep Basin could be tagged as non-core,"" according to the RBC note. ""This was new to us and opens up interesting de-leveraging possibilities for Cenovus."""
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"While the company had wanted to raise C$3.6 billion through asset sales, it may end up raising more, according to the note."

ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"TORONTO/CALGARY, April 20 (Reuters) - BP Plc is considering the sale of its stakes in three Canadian oil sands projects, people familiar with the matter told Reuters this week, as part of the British oil company's strategy of retreating from noncore businesses."
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"BP's 50 percent stake in the Sunrise project near Fort McMurray in Alberta, where Husky Energy Inc owns the rest and is the operator, is the most valuable of the three assets. BP'S Sunrise stake is valued at about $810 million, based on recent transactions in the sector."
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"It also owns a 50 percent stake in Pike, operated by Devon Energy Corp , which is still awaiting a final investment decision, and is majority-owner of the Terre de Grace oil sands pilot project."
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,A BP spokesman declined to comment. Sources declined to be named as the information is confidential.
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"BP has discussed with advisers the possibility of selling the stakes, though no final decision has been made, the people added."
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"If the sale proceeds, BP would deploy capital in more attractive regions, such as the Permian basin in the United States, where the rate of return tends to be higher, one of the people said."
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"BP's planned move comes after other global energy majors, including ConocoPhillips and Royal Dutch Shell have cut their exposure to Canada's oil sands operations, which are among the world's most expensive oil plays to develop. [nL5N1GM1VZ]"
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"Faced with a lower oil price environment and challenging economics, which include high cost operations and carbon taxes, global players are increasingly put off by the oil sands."
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"Reuters reported last week that U.S. oil producer Chevron Corp was exploring the sale of its 20 percent stake in Canada's Athabasca Oil Sands project, which could fetch about $2.5 billion. [nL1N1HL0PQ]"
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"BP is focusing its operations in Egypt, Azerbaijan, the Gulf of Mexico, the North Sea and Trinidad in the coming years."
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"Husky said in February that current production at the Sunrise project is about 36,000 barrels of oil per day. It is in the process of ramping up the project to full capacity of 60,000 bpd but progress has been slower than expected and the company is drilling extra wells to try to speed up production. Husky lowered the 2017 production forecast to 40,000-44,000 bpd from 60,000 bpd."
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"While Husky is not keen to increase its exposure to the oil sands, it may consider buying BP's stake if the price is attractive, two sources said."
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,Husky spokesman Mel Duvall declined to comment on whether the company had discussed buying BP's stake in Sunrise.

ConocoPhillips,2017-4,The Houston company projects its daily production of crude and natural gas will fall 26 percent after the latest sales to about 1.16 million barrels of oil equivalent (boe). Barclays expects overall it won't return to production growth on a full-year basis until 2019.
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"""They've sold a very valuable asset,"" said Marc Heilweil, senior portfolio manager at Atlanta-based investment firm Gratus Capital, referring to the oil-sands holdings."
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"The deal will ""make it harder for them to fully replace reserves down the line"" because shale-oil properties have shorter productive lives, he said."
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"To ensure growth, oil producers must continually add reserves to offset production and the natural decline that occurs in oil-and-gas properties."
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"In 2012, ConocoPhillips spun off its refining business, leaving the ranks of the large, integrated companies like Exxon Mobil Corp and Chevron Corp , and putting it among a group of mostly-small U.S. independent exploration and production companies."
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"Lance, who was the company's technology chief, became ConocoPhillips' chairman and CEO upon the spin off. He pledged to boost output by 3 percent to 5 percent annually by tapping its large pool of deep-water, oil-sands and conventional oil-and-gas properties. That goal ended two years later as prices collapsed, forcing it to borrow heavily to cover its spending on production. ConocoPhillips later cut its dividend."
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"Its lack of exposure to refining has helped its shares stand out recently. The company's stock is down 4.3 percent year to date, even after an about 9 percent jump following the March 29 disclosure of a $3 billion addition to its share buy backs. In contrast, Chevron is 11.5 percent lower and Exxon is off about 10.8 percent in the same period."
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"Of analysts with published ratings on the stock, 7 rate it a strong buy, 11 rate it a buy and 6 rate it a hold. That compares to Chevron with 6 strong buy ratings, 12 buy ratings and 3 hold ratings."
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"Last fall, Lance recast ConocoPhillips as an energy company able to offer steady shareholder returns on flat production spending of about $5 billion a year. It shaved its growth target to as much 2 percent, instead of up to 5 percent, and promised 20 percent to 30 percent of operating cash flow would go to holders via dividends and buy backs."
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"He insists the remaining assets can generate substantial cash from operations even if oil falls below $40 a barrel. ConocoPhillips is ramping up output from its Eagle Ford and Bakken shale wells, from another oil-sands property and liquefied natural gas (LNG) from operations in Australia."
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"Meanwhile, rivals have cranked up their production much faster. U.S. shale-focused companies project 15 percent volume growth this year, says consultancy Wood Mackenzie, and the larger oil producers such as Chevron are raising output and delivering fatter dividends."
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"ConocoPhillips will be producing an average 1.25 million boe a day in 2019, estimates Barclays. In contrast, Chevron projects its daily output this year will rise between 103,000 boe and 233,000 boe over 2016's average 2.59 million boe, excluding divestitures. Chevron pays a 4 percent dividend."
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"The risk for ConocoPhillips investors is the growth in production doesn't generate higher free cash flow for share buy backs, and the 2 percent dividend yield, about half that of Chevron, becomes the bigger part of returns."
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"Henry Smith, co-chief investment officer at Haverford Trust, which invests in companies offering revenue growth and dividend gains, sold ConocoPhillips shares ahead of its 2016 dividend cut and has not been tempted back by the new strategy."
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"ConocoPhillips' pledge to deliver steady returns and growth is appealing, said Smith. But, he added: ""Exxon over the years has fit that bill."" Haverford's oil-industry holdings are Exxon Mobil Corp , Chevron and Schlumberger NV , he said."

ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"Henry Smith, co-chief investment officer at Haverford Trust, which invests in companies offering revenue growth and dividend gains, sold ConocoPhillips shares ahead of its 2016 dividend cut and has not been tempted back by the new strategy."
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"ConocoPhillips' pledge to deliver steady returns and growth is appealing, said Smith. But, he added: ""Exxon over the years has fit that bill."" Haverford's oil-industry holdings are Exxon Mobil Corp , Chevron and Schlumberger NV , he said."
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"Tom Bergeron, an equity analyst at Frost Bank, also prefers other oil producers such as Chevron and Occidental Petroleum Corp for what he said is their expected growth and their higher dividend yields."
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"Lance, who worked summers as an oilfield roughneck while studying petroleum engineering in Montana, said he understands investors want proof the company can deliver regular payouts without the asset sales."
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"""It'll probably take performance through a cycle to demonstrate we have the position and the passion to deliver,"" he said, referring to the industry's boom and bust periods."

ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"ConocoPhillips has previously talked only about developing a new gas field for around $10 billion to fill the plant's single production unit, or train, when supply from its current gas source, the Bayu-Undan field, runs out around 2022. [nL4N1G002G]"
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"The U.S. oil major has also previously said an expansion in the current market would be challenging due to low oil and LNG prices, and costs that have risen steeply since Darwin LNG was built more than a decade ago."
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"A $650,000 feasibility study on building a second train is due to be completed this year, the Northern Territory government said on Wednesday, announcing that it would contribute $250,000 towards the study."
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"""The Territory Labor Government is supporting the feasibility study because this is a significant investment towards the business case for potential expansion at Darwin LNG, potentially creating thousands of jobs during construction and operation,"" Northern Territory Chief Minister Michael Gunner said in a statement."
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"Five joint ventures with undeveloped gas resources off the coast of the Northern Territory are backing the study, with stakeholders including Royal Dutch Shell , Malaysia's Petronas [PETR.UL], Italy's ENI SpA , and Australia's Santos and Origin Energy ."

ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"CET - Central European Time (GMT +1 or GMT +2, depending on time of the year)"
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"TORONTO, April 11 (Reuters) - Private equity firm Waterous Energy Fund is seeking investment opportunities in the Canadian oil and gas sector as valuations turn attractive after a prolonged slump in the oil price, making a contrarian bet as global players pull back, its top executive said."
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"Calgary-based Waterous Energy, which invests C$100 million to C$400 million ($75 million to $300 million) per deal in energy assets, is targeting companies in Canada and the United States, and is finding Canada particularly appealing, said Adam Waterous, head of Waterous Energy and a former top investment banker at Bank of Nova Scotia ."
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"Waterous Energy agreed to pay about C$244 million for a 67 percent stake in Canadian energy company Northern Blizzard Resources Inc from U.S. private equity firms Riverstone Holdings LLC and NGP Energy Capital Management LLC. This marks the second deal for Waterous Energy, which already has committed C$650 million since setting up shop earlier this year."
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,The Waterous acquisition is the latest example of Canada-focused firms buying into the country's energy sector and comes as international energy players exit the market.
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"""The macro theme playing out is the 'Canadianization' of the heavy oil business,"" Waterous said in an interview. ""These assets tend to be very capital intensive upfront but once they're onstream they have long reserve life and tend to have high free cash flow. From a Canadian investor's perspective, that's really compelling."""
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"Last month, ConocoPhillips said it would sell oil sands and natural gas assets to Calgary-based Cenovus Energy for C$17.2 billion, while Canadian Natural Resources Ltd is snapping up billions of dollars worth of oil sands assets from Royal Dutch Shell and Marathon Oil Corp . [nL2N1GM20K] [nL3N1H65JB]"
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"Oil prices have lost about 50 percent of their value since June 2014, when the industry slump began. They are almost flat since the start of the year."
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"""The market is saying the sun has set on the oil business,"" Waterous said. ""I'm willing to bet against that."""
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"Waterous said his firm was looking for assets with long reserve lives in top quartile reservoirs, where advanced technology techniques could be used."
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"""I find the environment right now to be very compelling. You've got a pessimistic market, you've got low costs in Calgary and you've got new technology being developed,"" he said."
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"For Waterous Energy, private Canadian energy producer Strath Resources Ltd was its first investment."
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"{{20170411T194817.562+0000}}UPDATE 2-Cenovus CEO seeks backing as bold bet and market jitters test his legacy(New throughout, adds comments from people close to chief executive)"
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"TORONTO, April 11 (Reuters) - Cenovus Energy Inc will do more hedging after its acquisition of ConocoPhillips assets, the Canadian company's Chief Executive Brian Ferguson said on Tuesday as he mounted a charm offensive on investors who balked at the deal."
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"Ferguson is known as a low-key and conservative chief executive in the western Canadian oil patch, and his C$17.7-billion ($13.3-billion) bid last month for the assets of ConocoPhillips, the latest international player to exit the country, had confounded investors and analysts."
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"The deal, which effectively doubles the size of Cenovus while denting its pristine balance sheet and making it more exposed to changes in oil prices, is seen as a test for Ferguson's legacy. The 60-year-old has been with the company and its predecessor for most of his life."
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"""When we close the transaction, we would definitely be adding more hedge volumes,"" Ferguson said at an industry event in Toronto, where he was seeking to sell his ambitious plan. Investors last month sent the company's shares crashing in their biggest single-day drop on news of the deal."
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"Despite a previously strong balance sheet, Cenovus had stayed on the sidelines even as domestic peers eagerly bought assets from retreating foreign oil majors. Eventually, weighed by C$4 billion ($3 billion) cash, Ferguson signed what some analysts and investors said was an uncharacteristic deal."
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"Ferguson said on Tuesday that the ""strategic rationale"" for the deal is well understood by investors, although he noted that some have questioned the company's plan for financing it through selling shares, divestitures and taking on debt."
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"The company has 75 percent of permanent financing in place and has seen strong interest in the assets it is selling, Ferguson said, adding, ""We've had multiple inbound inquiries from various sources - private equity funds, pension plans, smaller companies."""
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,Some who know Ferguson well say he has made the right move at the right time.
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"""When he puts a strategy in place it will be things he sees coming down the road that are perhaps not what other people will see,"" said Greg Stringham, a former executive with industry association the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers who has known Ferguson for 20 years."
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,A person close to Cenovus who has known and worked with Ferguson for over two decades said the deal will determine how Ferguson is remembered in the oil patch.
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"""When you double the size of the company, there will be a jury at some point, whether it is six months from now or six years from now,"" the person said."

ConocoPhillips,2017-4,* Cash crude grades trade at multi-year highs on cuts
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"CALGARY, Alberta/NEW YORK, April 6 (Reuters) - Two oil sands producers in northern Alberta have cut production at their facilities due to a shortage of synthetic crude, market sources said on Thursday, causing Canadian and U.S. crude prices to surge to multi-year highs."
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"Synthetic supplies are scarce following a fire at the 350,000 barrel-per-day (bpd) Syncrude plant in March that damaged the facility and forced the operator to bring forward maintenance and cut production for April to zero. [nL2N1GS10S]"
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"As a result ConocoPhillips reduced output at its 140,000 bpd Surmont project, a joint venture with Total E&P Canada , by 40 percent, two market sources said. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to speak to the media."
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"The company mixes synthetic crude from Syncrude with tarry bitumen from its oil sands reservoir to create a heavy crude blend known as ""synbit"" that can flow through pipelines."
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"CNOOC Ltd <0883.HK> subsidiary Nexen Energy, which likewise uses synthetic crude to dilute its bitumen, cut output from its Long Lake oil sands project this month by 48 percent, said one of the two sources, as well as two separate sources."
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"Long Lake usually produces around 40,000 bpd of undiluted bitumen, one source said."
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"ConocoPhillips spokeswoman Michelle McCullagh, who earlier this week confirmed that the Syncrude outage affected Surmont output, declined to comment on the size of the production cut."
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,Nexen Energy spokeswoman Brittney Price said her company does not publish production or maintenance operations for individual assets.
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"Syncrude, a joint venture majority-owned by Suncor Energy Inc , is expected to return to operations the first week of May but will be running at reduced rates that month, trading sources said on Wednesday. [nL2N1HD227]"
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"The oil sands outages have boosted Canadian heavy crude prices, with the benchmark Western Canada Select blend for May delivery last trading close to a 22-month high of $9.60 a barrel below U.S. crude, according to Shorcan Energy brokers."
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"Meanwhile, Mars Sour traded up to $1.20 a barrel discount to U.S. crude on Thursday, the narrowest discount since September 2015, according to Reuters data. Light Louisiana Sweet traded up to $2.35 a barrel over WTI, the widest premium since March 2016."

ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"TORONTO, April 6 (Reuters) - Royal Bank of Canada , JPMorgan and Bank of Montreal took the top three positions advising on Canadian equity issues in the first quarter, according to Thomson Reuters data released on Thursday."
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"The volume slipped about 13 percent to C$12.9 billion ($9.6 billion) from year-earlier levels, the figures showed. Toronto Dominion and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce finished fourth and fifth, respectively."
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"The five biggest deals of the quarter were in the energy sector, led by Cenovus Energy Inc's C$3 billion offering to help fund its acquisition of oil sands and natural gas assets from ConocoPhillips , followed by AltaGas Ltd's C$2.2 billion issue tied to its purchase of WGL Holdings . [nL3N1H65JB][nL4N1FF5NW]"
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"RBC and JPMorgan were advisors on both those deals, and TD helped advise the AltaGas offering."
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"Initial public offerings rebounded after a lackluster 2016, with Freshii Inc and Canada Goose Holdings Inc listing on the Toronto Stock Exchange. [nL2N1GT0YP]"
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,CIBC and RBC were jointly ranked No. 1 for advising on initial public offerings in the quarter.
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,JPMorgan's No. 2 ranking for overall equity issuance was the best performance by a foreign bank in Canadian equity capital markets since the second quarter of 2013.
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"""It does show you that for certain transactions, having a global bank leading or joint leading an equity offering can provide real value,"" said David Rawlings, head of JPMorgan Canada."
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,Rawlings said JPMorgan has been building its equity capabilities in Canada for the last three or four years.
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"The energy sector represented about 50 percent of new equity issues in the quarter, said Kirby Gavelin, head of equity capital markets at RBC Capital Markets."
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"""Acquisition-related financing was robust across all sectors,"" he added."

ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"TORONTO, April 6 (Reuters) - Canadian mergers and acquisitions got off to their strongest start in 17 years in 2017 as cross-border deal activity picked up pace, with JPMorgan , Goldman Sachs and RBC taking the top three spots in the advisory rankings."
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"Foreign banks further consolidated their position in Canadian deal-making as companies looked beyond borders for growth opportunities. [nL2N1GY0DB] Toronto Dominion and Lazard rounded out the top five positions in the league tables, according to Thomson Reuters data released on Thursday."
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"Deal value in the first quarter of 2017 jumped 12 percent to $75.4 billion, making it the best first quarter only behind the same period in 2000. Sizeable cross-border deals included AltaGas Ltd's planned acquisition of WGL Holdings for C$8.4 billion ($6.25 billion), and MacDonald Dettwiler and Associates Ltd's C$3.1 billion deal buy U.S.-based satellite imagery provider DigitalGlobe Inc ."
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"""The results are reflective of the strong market we have for cross-border deals,"" said David Rawlings, head of JPMorgan Canada."
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"Canadian companies ""certainly want exposure to the United States. Our clients want to diversify outside of Canada,"" he added."
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"Energy sector deals dominated the league tables, with domestic oil companies scooping assets of foreign oil majors. ConocoPhillips agreed to sell its oil sands and natural gas assets to Cenovus Energy Inc for C$17.2 billion, while Royal Dutch Shell offloaded most of its Canadian oil sands assets for $8.5 billion. Canadian Natural Resources Ltd was the main buyer of those assets."
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"""The large energy deals are strategic, chessboard-type transactions,"" said Brian Hanson, chief executive of Lazard's Canadian investment banking division."
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"""We expect more energy activity and more energy consolidation, but it may not be in a straight line, particularly if energy prices are volatile,"" he added."
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"The robust first-quarter performance in Canadian M&A follows an impressive 2016, when deal volume hit a nine-year high. [nL1N1EV00F]. Bankers are betting on more deals."
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"""We remain optimistic that 2017 will be a good year for Canadian M&A,"" said Peter Buzzi, co-head of M&A at RBC Capital Markets."

ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"CALGARY, Alberta, April 4 (Reuters) - A shutdown at the Syncrude oil sands facility in northern Alberta has curbed output from ConocoPhillips' Surmont plant, the U.S. company said on Tuesday, as the shortage helped push heavy Canadian crude prices to the narrowest discount in nearly two years."
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"The 350,000 barrel-per-day Syncrude project cut production for all of April to zero, according to market sources, following a fire last month that damaged the facility and forced the operator to bring forward planned maintenance. [nL2N1HB0WZ]"
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"ConocoPhillips has had to reduce production at its 140,000 bpd Surmont thermal plant because it uses light synthetic crude from Syncrude, one of the largest producers in Canada's oil sands, to dilute tarry bitumen into a heavy blend that can flow through pipelines."
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"""(The) Syncrude outage has had an impact on our output, but we are working with suppliers to understand the timeline as the Syncrude owners work towards a full recovery,"" ConocoPhillips Canada spokeswoman Michelle McCullagh said in an email."
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"She did not specify the reduction in crude volume, but combined with the Syncrude outage, up to 490,000 bpd, or nearly one fifth, of the oil sands' 2.5 million bpd of supply is potentially off the market."
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"On top of that Suncor Energy's 180,000 bpd Firebag thermal plant is also undergoing planned maintenance this quarter, adding to the shortage of heavy crude."
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"Canada produces around 4 million bpd and exports about 3.1 million bpd, almost entirely to the United States."
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,Prices for heavy and synthetic Canadian crude have surged on tight supply and extended gains on Tuesday.
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"Western Canada Select heavy blend crude for May delivery last traded at $10.15 per barrel below the West Texas Intermediate benchmark, according to Shorcan Energy Brokers, the smallest discount since June 2015."
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"Light synthetic crude from the oil sands for May delivery last traded at $5.30 per barrel over WTI, having settled at $4.85 per barrel over the benchmark on Monday."
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"Syncrude is a joint venture majority-owned by Suncor Energy Inc , while Imperial Oil Ltd provides operational, technical and business management support."

ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"""By the mid-2020s, the existing brownfield supply expansion options will be exhausted both in the U.S. and other countries. New greenfield projects will be needed,"" Lance said."

ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"CALGARY, Alberta, April 4 (Reuters) - A shutdown at the Syncrude oil sands facility in northern Alberta has curbed output from ConocoPhillips' Surmont plant, the U.S. company said on Tuesday, as the shortage helped push heavy Canadian crude prices to the narrowest discount in nearly two years."
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"The 350,000 barrel-per-day Syncrude project cut production for all of April to zero, according to market sources, following a fire last month that damaged the facility and forced the operator to bring forward planned maintenance. [nL2N1HB0WZ]"
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"ConocoPhillips has had to reduce production at its 140,000 bpd Surmont thermal plant because it uses light synthetic crude from Syncrude, one of the largest producers in Canada's oil sands, to dilute tarry bitumen into a heavy blend that can flow through pipelines."
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"""(The) Syncrude outage has had an impact on our output, but we are working with suppliers to understand the timeline as the Syncrude owners work towards a full recovery,"" ConocoPhillips Canada spokeswoman Michelle McCullagh said in an email."
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"She did not specify the reduction in crude volume, but combined with the Syncrude outage, up to 490,000 bpd, or nearly one fifth, of the oil sands' 2.5 million bpd of supply is potentially off the market."
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"On top of that Suncor Energy's 180,000 bpd Firebag thermal plant is also undergoing planned maintenance this quarter, adding to the shortage of heavy crude."
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"Canada produces around 4 million bpd and exports about 3.1 million bpd, almost entirely to the United States."
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,Prices for heavy and synthetic Canadian crude have surged on tight supply and extended gains on Tuesday.
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"Western Canada Select heavy blend crude for May delivery last traded at $10.15 per barrel below the West Texas Intermediate benchmark, according to Shorcan Energy Brokers, the smallest discount since June 2015."
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"Light synthetic crude from the oil sands for May delivery last traded at $5.30 per barrel over WTI, having settled at $4.85 per barrel over the benchmark on Monday."
ConocoPhillips,2017-4,"Syncrude is a joint venture majority-owned by Suncor Energy Inc , while Imperial Oil Ltd provides operational, technical and business management support."
