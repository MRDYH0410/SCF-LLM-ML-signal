General Electric,2017-11,{{20171129T165326.586+0000}}Exxon nears deal to explore for oil and gas offshore MauritaniaBy Edward McAllister
General Electric,2017-11,"DAKAR, Nov 29 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil is close to signing a deal to explore for oil and gas offshore Mauritania, its first foray into the West African country, Mauritania's oil, energy and mines director said on Wednesday."
General Electric,2017-11,"An Exxon Mobil spokeswoman declined to comment on the deal, but said the Texas-based company does not yet have drilling activities in Mauritania."
General Electric,2017-11,"Interest has surged in oil and gas fields offshore of Mauritania and neighbour Senegal since big discoveries by Cairn Energy and Kosmos Energy , the latter now partnered with BP, in separate projects over the last three years. Both are expected to start production early next decade."
General Electric,2017-11,London-based BP is already developing a major gas project and France's Total has bought into several exploration licences in both countries.
General Electric,2017-11,"""We have agreed on the terms of three blocks,"" Moustapha Bechir, Mauritania's director general of oil, energy and mines told Reuters on the sidelines of an Oil & Gas Council conference in Dakar. He said they and Exxon had yet to formally sign the deal, but would do soon."
General Electric,2017-11,"Experts describe the deep waters there as the next big frontier in energy drilling, though the true size of the deposits is not yet known. BP next year plans to make a final investment decision on a liquefied natural gas (LNG) project that would ship West African gas worldwide."
General Electric,2017-11,"Long overlooked by firms more focused on massive deposits in the Gulf of Guinea further south, Senegal's and Mauritania's oil and gas was discovered by new technology that has given companies a better idea of what lies under the sea bed."
General Electric,2017-11,"Now, specialist firms are trawling the deep waters making seismic tests to determine what is below. Oil service companies such as Baker Hughes, now part of General Electric , Schlumberger, and others are lining up to team up with oil producers to develop the resources."
General Electric,2017-11,"Governments in less developed areas south of Senegal and Mauritania's deposits, including Gambia, Guinea Bissau and Guinea, are also trying to coax oil companies in the hope that they can emulate the interest."
General Electric,2017-11,"Gambia is marketing oil blocks in its thin sliver of territorial water, while Guinea has started to drill offshore."
General Electric,2017-11,"Guinea Bissau plans to drill its first deep offshore well next year, Celedonio Vieira, the director of marketing and business development at state-run PetroGuin, told Reuters."
General Electric,2017-11,"""We are optimistic because of the success in Senegal,"" he said."

General Electric,2017-11,"{{20171128T205217.222+0000}}Fitch cuts GE rating, outlook negativeNov 28 (Reuters) - Fitch Ratings on Tuesday downgraded General Electric Co and its finance arm, GE Capital, citing deterioration in the industrial conglomerate's operating and financial performance."
General Electric,2017-11,"The credit rating agency lowered the long-term issuer default ratings for GE and GE Capital to ""A+"" from ""AA-"" and their short-term issuer default ratings to ""F1"" from ""F1+"", with a negative outlook."
General Electric,2017-11,Fitch said a slower return to both higher margins and stronger free cash flow than previously anticipated prompted the downgrade.
General Electric,2017-11,"GE's performance was being affected by ""secular"" changes in its power segment's gas turbine business that has reduced long-term prospects for growth, it added."
General Electric,2017-11,"The company is aiming to reduce overhead costs by $2 billion next year, with half of that coming from its troubled power unit, which sells electrical generation equipment."
General Electric,2017-11,The power unit has struggled due to weak demand and excess inventory in the market.
General Electric,2017-11,"Fitch said GE has identified several actions that should improve its operating performance, but the implementation could occur over an extended period and there could be numerous execution risks."
General Electric,2017-11,"""Cash flow available to the industrial business will be reduced through at least 2018 by the suspension of dividends from GE Capital while it reviews its insurance reserves,"" the agency said in a statement."
General Electric,2017-11,"Earlier this month, Moody's downgraded General Electric one notch to ""A2"" from ""A1"" due to what it called ""severe deterioration"" in the financial performance of GE's power segment expected to last through at least 2019. [nL1N1NM159]"

General Electric,2017-11,"HOUSTON, Nov 28 (Reuters) - Shale oil engineer Oscar Portillo spends his days drilling as many as five wells at once - without ever setting foot on a rig."
General Electric,2017-11,"Part of a team working to cut the cost of drilling a new shale well by a third, Portillo works from a Royal Dutch Shell Plc office in suburban Houston, his eyes darting among 13 monitors flashing data on speed, temperature and other metrics as he helps control rigs more than 500 miles (805 km) away in the Permian Basin, the largest U.S. oilfield."
General Electric,2017-11,"For the last decade, smaller oil companies have led the way in shale technology, slashing costs by as much as half with breakthroughs such as horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracking that turned the United States into the world's fastest-growing energy exporter."
General Electric,2017-11,"Now, oil majors that were slow to seize on shale are seeking further efficiencies by adapting technologies for highly automated offshore operations to shale and pursuing advances in digitalization that have reshaped industries from auto manufacturing to retail."
General Electric,2017-11,"If they are successful, the U.S. oil industry's ability to bring more wells to production at lower cost could amp up future output and company profits. The firms could also frustrate the ongoing effort by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to drain a global oil glut."
General Electric,2017-11,"""We're bringing science into the art of drilling wells,"" Portillo said."
General Electric,2017-11,"The technological push comes amid worries that U.S. shale gains are slowing as investors press for higher financial returns. Many investors want producers to restrain spending and focus on generating higher returns, not volume, prompting some to pull back on drilling."

General Electric,2017-11,"Shell, in an initiative called ""iShale,"" has marshaled technology from a dozen oilfield suppliers, including devices from subsea specialist TechnipFMC Plc that separate fracking sand from oil and well-control software from Emerson Electric Co , to bring more automation and data analysis to shale operations."
General Electric,2017-11,"One idea borrowed from deepwater projects is using sensors to automatically adjust well flows and control separators that divvy natural gas, oil and water. Today, these subsea systems are expensive because they are built to operate at the extreme pressures and temperatures found miles under the ocean's surface."
General Electric,2017-11,"Shell's initiative aims to create cheaper versions for onshore production by incorporating low-cost sensors similar to those in Apple Inc's Watch, eliminating the need for workers to visit thousands of shale drilling rigs to read gauges and manually adjust valves. Shell envisions shale wells that predict when parts are near mechanical failure and schedule repairs automatically."
General Electric,2017-11,"By next year, the producer wants to begin remote fracking of wells, putting workers in one place to oversee several projects. It also would add solar panels and more powerful batteries to well sites to reduce electricity and diesel costs."

General Electric,2017-11,{{20171126T135256.145+0000}}EXCLUSIVE-Airbus set to poach Rolls exec to head jetliner sales - sources* Rolls-Royce civil engines boss Schulz tapped to run Airbus sales
General Electric,2017-11,"* Has task of lifting team dispirited by probes, leadership vacuum"
General Electric,2017-11,"PARIS, Nov 26 (Reuters) - Airbus is poised to hire the head of Rolls-Royce's civil engines unit, Eric Schulz, to lead its commercial jetliner sales, after months of uncertainty over the successor to sales kingpin John Leahy, three people familiar with the matter said."
General Electric,2017-11,"Schulz, president of the civil engines division at the British engineering firm, has been recommended for the post to bring in outside blood as the company faces turmoil over the impact of UK and French corruption investigations."
General Electric,2017-11,"Christian Scherer, chief executive of turboprop maker ATR, jointly owned by Airbus and Italian aerospace firm Leonardo , had also been considered for one of aviation's highest profile roles."
General Electric,2017-11,"Scherer, an Airbus veteran of 30 years before joining ATR, was seen by many as a leading candidate and enjoys close ties to Chief Executive Tom Enders. But although Scherer has not been linked to the compliance investigations, industry sources said the board is insisting on a break with the past."
General Electric,2017-11,"A final decision will be taken by the Airbus board based on a panel's decision to put forward one name, that of Schulz."
General Electric,2017-11,Airbus and Rolls-Royce declined to comment. Schulz and Scherer could not immediately be reached for comment.
General Electric,2017-11,"Leahy has been in the post since 1994 and is a dominant figure in the $100 billion-a-year aerospace industry, making his succession one of the sector's most closely watched moves."
General Electric,2017-11,"He is expected to retire around Jan. 25 after deferring his departure for several months when his hand-picked successor, deputy sales chief Kiran Rao, pulled out of the race."
General Electric,2017-11,"Schulz, an affable 54-year-old French engineer, began his career at one of Airbus's founders, France's former state-owned Aerospatiale, before working at aerospace supplier Goodrich via a stint at two French airlines: UTA and Air Liberte."
General Electric,2017-11,He is part of a relatively new management team that pulled Rolls-Royce out of its own compliance scandal and financial problems and has been running civil engines since January 2016.
General Electric,2017-11,"His experience reinforces close ties between Airbus and Rolls-Royce on wide-body jets, mirroring last year's decision by rival Boeing to recruit a top executive from its own top supplier, General Electric , to run its commercial unit."
General Electric,2017-11,"""Rolls-Royce and Airbus are joined at the hip so they must know him well, and he them,"" said Agency Partners analyst Nick Cunningham, adding Schulz came across as ""open and realistic""."
General Electric,2017-11,"But he will inherit a Toulouse sales organisation unsettled by recent defeats against Boeing and widely seen as desperate for stability amid the probes, which centre on a now defunct Paris-based unit of Airbus headquarters. [nL8N1MT68E]"
General Electric,2017-11,"""They have chosen a clean break but that is not without risk,"" a senior industry source said."
General Electric,2017-11,"If, as expected, he is confirmed by the Airbus board, Schulz will need to act quickly to restore staff morale and rebuild bridges with customers following a wobbly Dubai Airshow this month, industry sources said. [nL8N1NN2NC]"
General Electric,2017-11,"But although he has twice worked for firms linked to Airbus, Schulz's independent career path may give him a freer hand to shape a marketing machine urgently needing a fresh spark after prolonged uncertainty over Leahy's succession."
General Electric,2017-11,"""He is very straight; not political,"" said a person who has negotiated with Schulz."
General Electric,2017-11,"Analysts say investors are for now playing down the probes and loss of order momentum because Airbus, like Boeing, is cushioned by record backlogs of jets waiting to be produced."
General Electric,2017-11,But the choice of sales boss is a decision that many say will influence the direction of the aerospace giant for years.
General Electric,2017-11,"Airbus shares have risen 18.5 percent in the past six months, outperforming an almost-flat French CAC40 <.FCHI> index."

General Electric,2017-11,"NEW YORK, Nov 19 (Reuters) - General Electric Co shares stabilized after a brutal slide last week sent the stock near six-year lows, but the worst may not be over."
General Electric,2017-11,"Some investors still do not see enough value to warrant buying the shares, which have lost some of their luster as a blue-chip investment."
General Electric,2017-11,"They are sorting through massive changes announced by GE's new Chief Executive John Flannery last Monday: hugely reduced near-term profit-growth prospects, a halved dividend, and a wave of promised divestitures."
General Electric,2017-11,"""In a sense, the stock is trying to find an investor,"" said Scott Lawson, vice president of Westwood Holdings Group in Dallas, who follows industrial stocks, as the stock was sliding last week. ""That investor is not a growth guy, because they are not growing. It's not a value guy, because they're not cheap on the value metrics."""
General Electric,2017-11,The massive decline for the stock - more than 40 percent this year - suggests that it would pique the interest of value players.
General Electric,2017-11,"GE shares fell to $17.90, their lowest closing price since December 2011, after dropping 12.6 percent over Monday and Tuesday, their biggest two-day decline since the financial crisis. The stock edged back up over the rest of the week and closed Friday at $18.21 amid news that Flannery had bought about $1.1 million worth of the stock. [nL3N1NN42K]"
General Electric,2017-11,But GE shares have not fallen enough for some investors.
General Electric,2017-11,"""What we are looking for is a sufficient margin of safety to reasonable intrinsic value, and at the current stock price, we just don't think the margin of safety is there,"" Michael Kon, portfolio manager with Golub Group in San Mateo, California, said as the stock hovered around $18."
General Electric,2017-11,Kon said he was looking either for the stock to fall further or for better-than-expected improvement in GE's power-turbine division before any investment.
General Electric,2017-11,"Investment advisory firm Alan B. Lancz & Associates bought some GE shares last week as the stock dipped into the $17 range, seeing value in the company's assets, which also include remaining major businesses in jet engines and healthcare, said Alan Lancz, president of the Toledo, Ohio-based firm."
General Electric,2017-11,But Lancz said he sees GE as an investment with a three- to five-year payoff and acknowledged the stock may fall further before that.
General Electric,2017-11,"""We don't see any short-term, intermediate-term catalysts but we think that there is value there,"" Lancz said. ""It's not high on our list of buys, but it is something that, I think for the long-term, it can be accumulated here."""
General Electric,2017-11,One question facing investors is how to assess the company against its rivals.
General Electric,2017-11,"Over the past 20 years, GE on average has traded at 19 times earnings estimates for the next 12 months, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream. That is well above the average of 15.4 times for rival diversified manufacturers Honeywell International Inc and United Technologies Corp over that time."
General Electric,2017-11,"Following the stock's slide this year, including fallout from third-quarter financial results last month that Flannery himself called ""unacceptable,"" GE now trades at a discount to those companies: 16.9 times forward earnings estimates against 17.3 times for United Tech and 19 times for Honeywell."
General Electric,2017-11,"""It is going to take a long time before you can clear the cloud and maybe get GE back to a comparable valuation level with respect to other similar companies,"" said Chip Pettengill, portfolio manager at Bahl & Gaynor Investment Counsel in Cincinnati. Pettengill calls GE a ""tarnished blue-chip stock."""
General Electric,2017-11,"GE's earnings power is stronger than the ""trough,"" or bottom, projected for 2018, said Scott Schermerhorn, chief investment officer at Granite Investment Advisors in Concord, New Hampshire, who sees the shares particularly discounted to other industrial companies based on enterprise value to sales comparisons."
General Electric,2017-11,"His firm has held onto the GE shares purchased earlier this year, and is considering buying more, Schermerhorn said."
General Electric,2017-11,"""The businesses they have are at least as good as a typical industrial, and therefore we think with proper management you're going to see earnings accelerate,"" Schermerhorn said, while cautioning: ""It's not going to be quick."""

General Electric,2017-11,"DUBAI, Nov 19 (Reuters) - A preliminary deal to sell 36 A380s to Emirates blew up in an Airbus hospitality chalet moments before the Gulf carrier was expected to shower $30 billion on the planemaker and its U.S. rival Boeing at the start of last week's Dubai Airshow."
General Electric,2017-11,"Two top Emirates officials broke the news to Airbus CEO Tom Enders and his sales chief John Leahy that the widely expected $16 billion deal would not be signed that day, leaving uncertainty over the future of the world's largest jetliner."
General Electric,2017-11,"The halt came so swiftly that Airbus PR executives who were already in place for a double-signing ceremony a hundred yards away found themselves awkwardly among the audience as Boeing walked away with the sole Emirates order, worth $15 billion."
General Electric,2017-11,"The unusual stumble in slick air show choreography highlights problems over timing and trust that may even now complicate a deal between Airbus and Emirates, people aware of the matter said."
General Electric,2017-11,One of the closest and most successful relations in aviation is looking bruised and throws up new complications for Airbus just as it struggles to maintain business as usual at a time when it faces British and French compliance probes.
General Electric,2017-11,"A day after Airbus's hopes were dashed, airline president Tim Clark publicly delivered a message from Dubai's government saying it wanted a guarantee from Airbus that it would keep producing the A380 for 10 years, before the state-owned carrier would agree to placing a new order.

General Electric,2017-11,Air show delegates said Emirates and Airbus must now resolve problems of visibility if a deal is to be done.
General Electric,2017-11,"Many in the industry say Airbus appears directionless as Leahy is due to retire in January, the guardian of the Emirates relationship, Habib Fekih, did so earlier this year and doubts grow over whether Enders will secure a new CEO mandate in 2019. Meanwhile the probes have badly clogged Airbus decision-making."
General Electric,2017-11,"On the Emirates side, top executive Clark - although full of energy at 67 and dismissing talk of retirement - is likely to hand over the baton at some stage, and it is uncertain how committed other managers are to the A380 flagship."
General Electric,2017-11,"""Nobody knows who is going to be in charge of the other side later, which doesn't help,"" said a person familiar with the matter."
General Electric,2017-11,"The Airbus board will however have to think hard before giving Dubai the guarantee it wants, which would go beyond the scope of a normal contract for specific planes."
General Electric,2017-11,"""It's not something any company can easily do, especially on something dragging down the bottom line,"" the same person said."
General Electric,2017-11,"For Emirates, the problem runs deeper than simply buying an aircraft from Airbus."
General Electric,2017-11,"Airlines deal directly with numerous suppliers, from landing gears to tyres and entertainment systems. Each takes its cue from the planemaker as conductor of a large orchestra."
General Electric,2017-11,"""If you're the only customer your fear is the manufacturer will lose interest and that becomes a signal to suppliers to make support a lower priority,"" a person close to the matter said. ""Then you end up unsure who is supporting what."""
General Electric,2017-11,"In 2015, Britain's Rolls-Royce won its largest-ever order, worth $9 billion, to displace U.S. consortium Engine Alliance to power a batch of 50 four-engined A380s for Emirates."
General Electric,2017-11,"But to win the deal it gave ambitious fuel-consumption targets and Emirates signalled last week the cards could be shuffled again for the potential new order. ""If we ordered more, we might contemplate talking to both sides,"" Clark said."

General Electric,2017-11,"GE is involved in a major rethink of strategy and wants to be more selective about investments, while Pratt & Whitney is absorbed with fixing delays on smaller engines. [nL3N1NJ3GQ]"
General Electric,2017-11,Keeping engine makers on board is all the more challenging because of the lack of an A380 second-hand market.
General Electric,2017-11,Engine makers make money on spares and services over the working life of an engine which is usually 20-25 years.
General Electric,2017-11,"But in another accident of timing, the first A380 to carry passengers, in 2007, was being mothballed in France just as Airbus was trying to cling on to an Emirates deal at last week's show, after just 10 years in service with Singapore Airlines."
General Electric,2017-11,"That sets a worrying precedent for suppliers of Emirates, which usually operates planes for 12 years and around 20 of whose A380s may exit the fleet to make way for new purchases."
General Electric,2017-11,"Faced with the possibility that any new A380 engines may have only half their budgeted life, engine makers may charge more for them up-front or more in hourly service contracts."

General Electric,2017-11,{{20171119T183602.185+0000}}REFILE-ANALYSIS-Airbus faces tricky hurdles over stalled A380 Emirates deal(Removes extraneous words from ninth paragraph)
General Electric,2017-11,* Engine Alliance could re-enter fray but doubts over investment
General Electric,2017-11,"DUBAI, Nov 19 (Reuters) - A preliminary deal to sell 36 A380s to Emirates blew up in an Airbus hospitality chalet moments before the Gulf carrier was expected to shower $30 billion on the planemaker and its U.S. rival Boeing at the start of last week's Dubai Airshow."
General Electric,2017-11,"Two top Emirates officials broke the news to Airbus CEO Tom Enders and his sales chief John Leahy that the widely expected $16 billion deal would not be signed that day, leaving uncertainty over the future of the world's largest jetliner."
General Electric,2017-11,"The halt came so swiftly that Airbus PR executives who were already in place for a double-signing ceremony a hundred yards away found themselves awkwardly among the audience as Boeing walked away with the sole Emirates order, worth $15 billion."
General Electric,2017-11,"The unusual stumble in slick air show choreography highlights problems over timing and trust that may even now complicate a deal between Airbus and Emirates, people aware of the matter said."
General Electric,2017-11,One of the closest and most successful relations in aviation is looking bruised and throws up new complications for Airbus just as it struggles to maintain business as usual at a time when it faces British and French compliance probes.
General Electric,2017-11,"A day after Airbus's hopes were dashed, airline president Tim Clark publicly delivered a message from Dubai's government saying it wanted a guarantee from Airbus that it would keep producing the A380 for 10 years, before the state-owned carrier would agree to placing a new order. [nL8N1NJ5ID]"
General Electric,2017-11,"Enders emailed Clark calling the ultimatum, first reported by Reuters, unhelpful, two people aware of the matter said."
General Electric,2017-11,"""There is a worrying breakdown of the relationship between Airbus and Emirates,"" said a person familiar with the talks."
General Electric,2017-11,"""Airbus was confident of getting a deal,"" a Gulf source added. ""But Dubai does not want to be taken for granted."""
General Electric,2017-11,Air show delegates said Emirates and Airbus must now resolve problems of visibility if a deal is to be done.
General Electric,2017-11,"Many in the industry say Airbus appears directionless as Leahy is due to retire in January, the guardian of the Emirates relationship, Habib Fekih, did so earlier this year and doubts grow over whether Enders will secure a new CEO mandate in 2019. Meanwhile the probes have badly clogged Airbus decision-making."
General Electric,2017-11,"On the Emirates side, top executive Clark - although full of energy at 67 and dismissing talk of retirement - is likely to hand over the baton at some stage, and it is uncertain how committed other managers are to the A380 flagship."
General Electric,2017-11,"""Nobody knows who is going to be in charge of the other side later, which doesn't help,"" said a person familiar with the matter."
General Electric,2017-11,"The Airbus board will however have to think hard before giving Dubai the guarantee it wants, which would go beyond the scope of a normal contract for specific planes."
General Electric,2017-11,"""It's not something any company can easily do, especially on something dragging down the bottom line,"" the same person said."
General Electric,2017-11,"For Emirates, the problem runs deeper than simply buying an aircraft from Airbus."
General Electric,2017-11,"Airlines deal directly with numerous suppliers, from landing gears to tyres and entertainment systems. Each takes its cue from the planemaker as conductor of a large orchestra."
General Electric,2017-11,"""If you're the only customer your fear is the manufacturer will lose interest and that becomes a signal to suppliers to make support a lower priority,"" a person close to the matter said. ""Then you end up unsure who is supporting what."""
General Electric,2017-11,"In 2015, Britain's Rolls-Royce won its largest-ever order, worth $9 billion, to displace U.S. consortium Engine Alliance to power a batch of 50 four-engined A380s for Emirates."
General Electric,2017-11,"But to win the deal it gave ambitious fuel-consumption targets and Emirates signalled last week the cards could be shuffled again for the potential new order. ""If we ordered more, we might contemplate talking to both sides,"" Clark said."
General Electric,2017-11,But Engine Alliance output ends in 2018. Keeping its assembly lines warm would require a fresh commitment from its parents General Electric and Pratt & Whitney .
General Electric,2017-11,"""That's a pretty big ask right now. It all comes down to money,"" a person close to the consortium said."
General Electric,2017-11,"GE is involved in a major rethink of strategy and wants to be more selective about investments, while Pratt & Whitney is absorbed with fixing delays on smaller engines. [nL3N1NJ3GQ]"
General Electric,2017-11,Keeping engine makers on board is all the more challenging because of the lack of an A380 second-hand market.
General Electric,2017-11,Engine makers make money on spares and services over the working life of an engine which is usually 20-25 years.
General Electric,2017-11,"But in another accident of timing, the first A380 to carry passengers, in 2007, was being mothballed in France just as Airbus was trying to cling on to an Emirates deal at last week's show, after just 10 years in service with Singapore Airlines."
General Electric,2017-11,"That sets a worrying precedent for suppliers of Emirates, which usually operates planes for 12 years and around 20 of whose A380s may exit the fleet to make way for new purchases."
General Electric,2017-11,"Faced with the possibility that any new A380 engines may have only half their budgeted life, engine makers may charge more for them up-front or more in hourly service contracts."
General Electric,2017-11,"Still, Emirates believes an Airbus guarantee over the life of the programme could break the logjam and generate new orders."
General Electric,2017-11,"""I would think a revitalisation of the line would bring the big players together and say what can we all do to make this work ... including propulsion,"" Clark said."
General Electric,2017-11,"Pride may yet work in favour of a deal over the A380, which is Airbus's only path into business with Emirates for the time being after the airline placed new orders with Boeing."
General Electric,2017-11,"""This (Airbus) management took the decision to launch the A380 so killing it now would make them look foolish,"" a senior air show delegate said."
General Electric,2017-11,"""They have got to be able to say that when they left, the A380 was still being built."""
General Electric,2017-11,ANALYSIS-Battered GE shares lure some buyers but worst may not be over - Reuters News
General Electric,2017-11,{{20171119T110001.454+0000}}ANALYSIS-Battered GE shares lure some buyers but worst may not be overBy Lewis Krauskopf
General Electric,2017-11,"NEW YORK, Nov 19 (Reuters) - General Electric Co shares stabilized after a brutal slide last week sent the stock near six-year lows, but the worst may not be over."
General Electric,2017-11,"Some investors still do not see enough value to warrant buying the shares, which have lost some of their luster as a blue-chip investment."
General Electric,2017-11,"They are sorting through massive changes announced by GE's new Chief Executive John Flannery last Monday: hugely reduced near-term profit-growth prospects, a halved dividend, and a wave of promised divestitures."
General Electric,2017-11,"""In a sense, the stock is trying to find an investor,"" said Scott Lawson, vice president of Westwood Holdings Group in Dallas, who follows industrial stocks, as the stock was sliding last week. ""That investor is not a growth guy, because they are not growing. It's not a value guy, because they're not cheap on the value metrics."""
General Electric,2017-11,The massive decline for the stock - more than 40 percent this year - suggests that it would pique the interest of value players.
General Electric,2017-11,"GE shares fell to $17.90, their lowest closing price since December 2011, after dropping 12.6 percent over Monday and Tuesday, their biggest two-day decline since the financial crisis. The stock edged back up over the rest of the week and closed Friday at $18.21 amid news that Flannery had bought about $1.1 million worth of the stock. [nL3N1NN42K]"
General Electric,2017-11,But GE shares have not fallen enough for some investors.
General Electric,2017-11,"""What we are looking for is a sufficient margin of safety to reasonable intrinsic value, and at the current stock price, we just don't think the margin of safety is there,"" Michael Kon, portfolio manager with Golub Group in San Mateo, California, said as the stock hovered around $18."
General Electric,2017-11,Kon said he was looking either for the stock to fall further or for better-than-expected improvement in GE's power-turbine division before any investment.
General Electric,2017-11,"Investment advisory firm Alan B. Lancz & Associates bought some GE shares last week as the stock dipped into the $17 range, seeing value in the company's assets, which also include remaining major businesses in jet engines and healthcare, said Alan Lancz, president of the Toledo, Ohio-based firm."
General Electric,2017-11,But Lancz said he sees GE as an investment with a three- to five-year payoff and acknowledged the stock may fall further before that.
General Electric,2017-11,"""We don't see any short-term, intermediate-term catalysts but we think that there is value there,"" Lancz said. ""It's not high on our list of buys, but it is something that, I think for the long-term, it can be accumulated here."""
General Electric,2017-11,One question facing investors is how to assess the company against its rivals.
General Electric,2017-11,"Over the past 20 years, GE on average has traded at 19 times earnings estimates for the next 12 months, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream. That is well above the average of 15.4 times for rival diversified manufacturers Honeywell International Inc and United Technologies Corp over that time."
General Electric,2017-11,"Following the stock's slide this year, including fallout from third-quarter financial results last month that Flannery himself called ""unacceptable,"" GE now trades at a discount to those companies: 16.9 times forward earnings estimates against 17.3 times for United Tech and 19 times for Honeywell."
General Electric,2017-11,"""It is going to take a long time before you can clear the cloud and maybe get GE back to a comparable valuation level with respect to other similar companies,"" said Chip Pettengill, portfolio manager at Bahl & Gaynor Investment Counsel in Cincinnati. Pettengill calls GE a ""tarnished blue-chip stock."""
General Electric,2017-11,"GE's earnings power is stronger than the ""trough,"" or bottom, projected for 2018, said Scott Schermerhorn, chief investment officer at Granite Investment Advisors in Concord, New Hampshire, who sees the shares particularly discounted to other industrial companies based on enterprise value to sales comparisons."
General Electric,2017-11,"His firm has held onto the GE shares purchased earlier this year, and is considering buying more, Schermerhorn said."
General Electric,2017-11,"""The businesses they have are at least as good as a typical industrial, and therefore we think with proper management you're going to see earnings accelerate,"" Schermerhorn said, while cautioning: ""It's not going to be quick."""

General Electric,2017-11,"FRANKFURT, Nov 16 (Reuters) - Siemens will cut about 6,900 jobs, or close to 2 percent of its global workforce, mainly at its power and gas division, which has been hit by the rapid growth of renewables."
General Electric,2017-11,"Most of the cuts, about 6,100, will be made before 2020 at Siemens's Power and Gas division, which once thrived on supplying large gas turbines for electricity generation but has been overtaken by the global surge in solar and wind capacity."

General Electric,2017-11,"""Job cuts of this magnitude are totally unacceptable given the company is in an outstanding overall position,"" said IG Metall board member Juergen Kerner, who also sits on Siemens's supervisory board."
General Electric,2017-11,"German Economy Minister Brigitte Zypries urged Siemens to treat employees fairly. ""The workers are very concerned and uncertain about their future. I hope that Siemens works closely with the unions to find fair solutions for the affected sites."""
General Electric,2017-11,She said particularly sites in structurally weak regions should be preserved.
General Electric,2017-11,"In contrast to arch-rival General Electric , Siemens was able to shield itself from a sharp downturn in demand for large turbines thanks to an 8 billion-euro ($9 billion) order for power generation in Egypt - the largest in its history - which has kept its German factories humming for the past two years."
General Electric,2017-11,"As that order has now been fulfilled, both groups find themselves staring into a future of vast overcapacity, where supply outstrips demand by a ratio of three to one, and prices have dropped 30 percent since 2014."
General Electric,2017-11,"Demand for powerplant sized gas turbines has tumbled and is expected to bottom out at 110 turbines a year, compared with total global manufacturing capacity of around 400 turbines, Siemens said."
General Electric,2017-11,"""The market is burning to the ground,"" Siemens board member Janina Kugel who is in charge of group human resources, told journalists in a call following the announcement."
General Electric,2017-11,"General Electric on Monday announced a halving of both its dividend and its 2018 earnings outlook, largely due to its flailing turbines business, which it acknowledged it had mismanaged as it underestimated the scale of the problem. [nL3N1NJ3GQ]"
General Electric,2017-11,"It was only the third time in the group's 125-year history that GE had lowered its dividend, with previous cuts during the Great Depression of the 1930s and last decade's financial crisis.

General Electric,2017-11,Nov 14 (Reuters) - General Electric Co's shares slumped for a second straight day on Tuesday as investors wondered if a massive overhaul by new Chief Executive John Flannery to save billions and make the conglomerate smaller was enough to revive the 125-year-old Dow component.
General Electric,2017-11,"GE's stock fell as much as 8.2 percent to $17.46. It was last down 5.3 percent in late afternoon trade, adding to its 7.2 percent drop on Monday, which set the shares up for their worst two-day losing streak since the financial crisis in 2009."
General Electric,2017-11,Flannery talked for two days about sweeping changes that will focus on three core businesses but instead it cut about $24 billion off GE's market capitalization.
General Electric,2017-11,"Several brokerages lowered ratings and price targets on the stock, disappointed that GE's plan was not more aggressive."
General Electric,2017-11,"Deutsche Bank analyst John Inch, who has a ""sell"" rating on GE with a price target of $18, said bulls had expected the company to move toward outright dismantlement of its portfolio, but GE stuck to the framework of divesting $20 billion in assets."
General Electric,2017-11,"Inch said it seems unlikely GE can unlock associated value through ""sum of the parts"" as it keeps the bulk of its portfolio intact."
General Electric,2017-11,"Analysts also said GE's move to cut its annual dividend to 48 cents from 96 cents was steeper than expected, putting more pressure on the stock."
General Electric,2017-11,"""With more than 40 percent of GE's common equity owned by retail investors, we believe substantial near term selling pressure on GE could further ensue as retail investors who previously counted on the GE dividend look elsewhere,"" Inch said."
General Electric,2017-11,"RBC Capital Markets analyst Andrew Krill downgraded the stock to ""sector perform"" from ""outperform"" and lowered the price target by $5 to $20."
General Electric,2017-11,"Krill said the market was caught by surprise by the magnitude of the missteps and secular challenges at GE's power business, as well as the systemic cash flow shortfalls."
General Electric,2017-11,"""Particularly damaging, in our view, was the admission that GE had been paying out a dividend above its industrial free cash flow for a number of years, and that GE Capital would not be paying a dividend to the parent in 2018."""
General Electric,2017-11,"J.P.Morgan analyst Stephen Tusa, who has an ""underweight"" rating on the stock with a price target of $17, said cost cut targets were not as ambitious as expected."
General Electric,2017-11,"""Sell-side bulls may be scratching their heads over the lack of self-help options presented (by GE), though we think most are still not comprehending the fundamental challenges at hand,"" he said."
General Electric,2017-11,"GE is aiming to reduce overhead costs by $2 billion next year, with half of that coming from its troubled power unit, which sells electrical generation equipment."

For example, GE cannot spin off the most valuable of the assets it has earmarked for disposal, its 62.5 percent stake in oilfield services company Baker Hughes worth $23 billion, until July 2019, according to the terms of an agreement it has with that company."
General Electric,2017-11,"""We wonder if GE may pursue a transaction similar to Synchrony Financial, where in 2014 GE IPOed about 15 percent of the business and 15 months later offered to exchange the company's remaining interest in Synchrony for GE stock,"" Cowen and Company analysts wrote in a note on Monday."
General Electric,2017-11,"M&A negotiations also have their own challenges. For example, GE clinched a deal for its most recent divestiture, the sale of its industrial solutions business to ABB Ltd for $2.6 billion, in September, after announcing its intention to sell that business 10 months earlier. The deal talks were fraught with tension over price disagreements, sources said at the time. [nL8N1M60F5]"
General Electric,2017-11,"The Baker Hughes stake is excluded from Flannery's $20 billion-plus divestiture target. Among the GE assets that are included in this target, the biggest is its transportation business, which generated revenue of $4.7 billion in 2016 and could be worth between $8 billion and $10 billion. It manufactures freight and passenger trains, marine diesel engines and mining equipment, among other products."
General Electric,2017-11,"That business could be sold to another company or a private equity firm, or be spun off. It could attract interest from major Western industry players such as Siemens AG and Alstom SA , which announced an agreement in September to merge their rail units, or Japanese or Chinese train manufacturers."
General Electric,2017-11,"GE has already put up for sale its healthcare information technology business, which is worth between $2 billion and $3 billion and assists with electronic medical records, healthcare workforce management, and hospital revenue cycle management. Some of its better known brands include API Healthcare, which it acquired in 2014, and Centricity EMR."
General Electric,2017-11,"That business is being marketed to private equity firms, and would likely have to be broken up into separate chunks in the event of a sale, sources have said. [nL2N1N11J1]"
General Electric,2017-11,"UPDATE 12-Shrinking GE rattles investors, shares hit 5-year low  - Reuters News"
General Electric,2017-11,"{{20171113T220113.239+0000}}UPDATE 12-Shrinking GE rattles investors, shares hit 5-year low * GE to focus on aviation, power, healthcare"
General Electric,2017-11,"Nov 13 (Reuters) - General Electric Co's new Chief Executive John Flannery on Monday outlined steps that will turn the biggest U.S. industrial conglomerate into a smaller, more focused company, surprising some investors who sold the company's shares to a five-year low."
General Electric,2017-11,"Flannery's plan to shrink GE's multi-industry array of businesses was a reversal of the deal-driven empire building of his predecessors, Jeff Immelt and Jack Welch, and potentially a milestone in the decline of the conglomerate as a business strategy."
General Electric,2017-11,"Other companies that once emulated the GE model of spreading bets among diverse industries are now unwinding their portfolios as well, something Immelt also did throughout his 16 years as CEO, even as he made acquisitions."
General Electric,2017-11,"Flannery said he will pare GE down to three core businesses: power, aviation and healthcare. He will keep Immelt's strategy of building software to complement GE's machinery, albeit with a narrower focus and reduced budget."
General Electric,2017-11,"For investors, Flannery's decision to cut both the dividend and the 2018 earnings forecast by half added up to a whole that was less than they judged GE be worth last week."
General Electric,2017-11,"GE shares fell to their lowest level in more than five years as investors worried the years-long overhaul would not pare down enough expenses or generate as much cash as they hoped. They closed off the day's lows, down 7.2 percent to $19.02."
General Electric,2017-11,"""They need to cut more cost,"" said Scott Davis, an analyst at Melius Research. ""GE is still a bloated company with duplicate costs up and down the organization."""
General Electric,2017-11,"GE stock has effectively been dead money since September 2001, when Immelt took over, posting a negative total return even after reinvesting its juicy dividends. Once the most valuable U.S. publicly traded company, GE now has a market value of $168 billion, less than a fifth of Apple Inc ."
General Electric,2017-11,"""You have pessimism around its portfolio of businesses mixed with a pretty harsh cut in the dividend,"" said John Augustine, chief investment officer at Huntington Private Bank. ""It took them years to get into this mess and it will take them several years to right the ship and get back into a stronger position."""
General Electric,2017-11,"Flannery, who took over as CEO on Aug. 1, said he was ""looking for the soul of the company again"" and would focus on ""restoring the oxygen of cash and earnings to the company."""
General Electric,2017-11,"He will cut its board to 12 from 18 members, and bring on three new directors early next year."
General Electric,2017-11,"GE said it already has shed 25 percent of its corporate staff, meaning 1,500 jobs around the world, including some at its Boston headquarters. It is aiming to reduce overhead cost by $2 billion next year, half of that at its troubled power unit that sells electrical generation equipment."
General Electric,2017-11,"The transition includes GE getting rid of at least $20 billion of assets through sales, spin-offs or other means. GE will jettison businesses with ""a very dispassionate eye,"" Flannery said, keeping only units that offer growth, a leading market position and a large installed base."
General Electric,2017-11,"GE said it would exit its lighting, transportation, industrial solutions and electrical grid businesses, all of which were widely expected, closing factories around the globe. But it was vague about other disposals."
General Electric,2017-11,"It plans to get rid of its 62.5-percent stake in oilfield services company Baker Hughes , only months after making the multi-billion dollar investment. Baker Hughes shares lost 3.2 percent."
General Electric,2017-11,"Flannery offered no quick fixes for investors. He said power, one of the businesses GE would focus on, was ""challenged,"" but could be turned around in one to two years."
General Electric,2017-11,"GE's Digital unit, on which Immelt bet billions of dollars, would focus on selling apps to customers in its core businesses, Flannery said. He confirmed that the shift meant sales staff were being let go, as Reuters reported last week. [nL1N1NG1DJ]"
General Electric,2017-11,"GE also will cut spending on the digital unit to $1.1 billion in 2018 from $1.5 billion in 2017. GE had previously said it would invest $2.1 billion in its digital unit in 2017, but that tally included money not tied to Predix, GE's industrial-internet platform, GE said."
General Electric,2017-11,"Flannery said there is ""no retreat on the idea"" of GE providing both applications and the Predix platform to connect industrial equipment to computers that can make machines run better. However, getting one of its key applications to run on Predix could take two more years."
General Electric,2017-11,"Flannery added that some of its healthcare IT business, such as software for imaging and hospital staff scheduling, were still critical to the company and not likely to be divested."
General Electric,2017-11,"The dividend cut, to 48 cents from 96 cents next year, is only the third in the company's 125-year history and the first not during a broader financial crisis. It is expected to save about $4 billion in cash annually."
General Electric,2017-11,"""This dividend cut will be a major disappointment to GE's (roughly 40 percent) retail shareholder base,"" said RBC Capital Markets analyst Deane Dray."
General Electric,2017-11,"The cut will be the eighth-biggest dividend cut in history among S&P 500 companies, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst of S&P Dow Jones Indices. GE also had the biggest cut when it slashed its dividend by $8.87 billion in 2009, Silverblatt said."
General Electric,2017-11,"GE forecast 2018 adjusted earnings of $1 to $1.07 a share, compared with its earlier estimate of $2 per share. Wall Street was expecting $1.16, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S."
General Electric,2017-11,"Industrial free cash flow will total just $6 billion to $7 billion next year, up from an estimated $3 billion in 2017, but far below earlier targets of $12 billion for 2017."
General Electric,2017-11,"GE said the weak power business had largely prompted the dividend cut and lowered earnings forecast. Demand for new power plants will remain slow through 2019, Flannery predicted."
General Electric,2017-11,"""We did not manage the (power) business well,"" he said. ""That's a fundamental change we need to make and that's going to take some time. This is not a magic wand."""

General Electric,2017-11,{{20171113T182802.110+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-GE's shaman exorcises ghosts of false expectations(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own. Updates to add details of board changes in fourth paragraph.)
General Electric,2017-11,"That Flannery is asking ""why do we exist?"" is not entirely surprising. He is, after all, a man with many years ahead of him to make some hard decisions, fundamentally reshape the company Thomas Edison founded and rebase its share price for the hard restructuring ahead. By contrast, his predecessor Jeff ""Two Jets"" Immelt was fighting for time, struggling to justify what was already done and had been previously promised during his 16 years running the company."
General Electric,2017-11,"Flannery has already clarified that GE's board is oversized, under-engaged and badly in need of a house cleaning. So perhaps the most encouraging development to be found in Flannery's 57-page slideshow on Monday is a plan to put just 12 directors up for a vote next year, including three new ones. That means it is parting company with half the current lineup. GE will also create a new ""finance and capital allocation committee"" with increased oversight of the company's acquisition and buyback strategy."
General Electric,2017-11,"The composition of the new board will include, among others, a representative of Trian Partners, the activist fund manager led by Nelson Peltz. But he can't be the only director willing to question the strategy, dig through the numbers and, where needed, prod Flannery to shift gears. The era of the all-powerful GE boss, with two jets at his disposal in case one breaks down, is over. That, beyond any numerical pledges, should be the most important statement to emerge on this investor day."
General Electric,2017-11,"- As part of its Nov. 13 investor day, General Electric's new Chairman and Chief Executive John Flannery laid out a strategy that will see the industrial conglomerate's dividend cut in half, its earnings guidance reduced and a reorganization of its portfolio of industrial assets."

General Electric,2017-11,"NEW YORK, Nov 12 (Reuters) - It is hard to imagine the Dow Jones Industrial Average without General Electric Co . The U.S. industrial conglomerate's stock is the lone original component of the venerable blue-chip index that debuted in 1896."
General Electric,2017-11,But GE's dwindling share price and the likelihood that its new chief executive will dramatically slim down its sprawling operations is leading some index-watchers to consider the possibility of the company losing its membership in the elite 30-stock Dow <.DJI>.
General Electric,2017-11,"""Since it is trading at a low share price and has a small weighting in the index, that does put it at an increased risk of getting removed,"" said Alex Bryan, director of passive strategies research at Morningstar in Chicago. ""I don't think it's obvious that it is going to be removed from the index, but it certainly is at risk."""
General Electric,2017-11,"GE's shares last week closed under $20 for the first time in more than five years, its struggles made clear by a disappointing third-quarter earnings report last month. The stock closed at $20.49 on Friday, marking a 35 percent decline in 2017."
General Electric,2017-11,"The stock price is now the lowest among Dow members. Because the Dow is a price-weighted index, unlike the benchmark S&P 500 <.SPX> which is influenced by the market values of its constituents, that means GE has the least impact on the Dow's daily swings."
General Electric,2017-11,"As of Friday, GE's weight stood at only 0.6 percent. By comparison, aircraft maker Boeing Co , whose stock is above $260, has a 7.7 percent weight."
General Electric,2017-11,"Changes to the Dow are made on an as-needed basis and selection is not governed by quantitative rules, according to published methodology for the index."
General Electric,2017-11,A spokesman for S&P Dow Jones Indices said the committee that oversees the Dow index meets regularly and that its discussions are confidential. GE declined to comment.
General Electric,2017-11,"Ivan Cajic, vice president for index and ETF research for ITG, said if the Dow were to make a change in the near future, GE is the likeliest to be removed."
General Electric,2017-11,"""I wouldn't be surprised if the company is safe for the time being and Dow Jones adopts a wait-and-see approach over the next few months to see how both the stock price and what the overall company looks like in the coming months,"" Cajic said."

General Electric,2017-11,"If GE starts selling big parts of its operation, the committee overseeing the Dow ""would give serious thought to whether or not the new GE, (excluding) those businesses, still represents as much a part of the economy as they once had,"" said Dave Nadig, CEO of ETF.com."

""That isn't necessarily the worst thing from a stock perspective, but they may start paring down to the point where the remaining businesses are similar to others that are in the Dow."""
General Electric,2017-11,"For now, GE still holds a major position in industries such as aviation, power and healthcare, and its market value of about $175 billion puts it in the middle of Dow components. Its historic place in the Dow may also be an argument for it to remain."
General Electric,2017-11,"If GE is removed from the Dow, it may not spark much immediate selling of the stock. Only about $20 billion is invested in exchange traded funds tied to the Dow, the vast majority in the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust , much less than the $380 billion in ETFs tied to the S&P 500, according to Lipper data. But the indirect impact of GE losing its blue-chip status could weigh in the longer term."
General Electric,2017-11,"It is not clear what company would replace GE in the Dow if it were kicked out. Three companies missing from the Dow with some of the largest market values - Amazon.com Inc , Google parent Alphabet Inc and Facebook Inc - have strikes against them."
General Electric,2017-11,"Share prices of online retailer Amazon.com and internet company Alphabet exceed $1,000 so they would warp the price-weighted Dow. Social media company Facebook only went public in 2012, which some market-watchers say is too recent to join the Dow."
General Electric,2017-11,"Industrial companies may find their applications denied. The sector represents about 22.5 percent of the Dow, which would be only marginally reduced by GE's departure. That level is more than twice the amount the sector represents in the S&P 500."

General Electric,2017-11,{{20171112T110001.609+0000}}Membership revoked? Veteran GE's spot in exclusive Dow may be shakyBy Lewis Krauskopf
General Electric,2017-11,"NEW YORK, Nov 12 (Reuters) - It is hard to imagine the Dow Jones Industrial Average without General Electric Co . The U.S. industrial conglomerate's stock is the lone original component of the venerable blue-chip index that debuted in 1896."
General Electric,2017-11,But GE's dwindling share price and the likelihood that its new chief executive will dramatically slim down its sprawling operations is leading some index-watchers to consider the possibility of the company losing its membership in the elite 30-stock Dow <.DJI>.
General Electric,2017-11,"""Since it is trading at a low share price and has a small weighting in the index, that does put it at an increased risk of getting removed,"" said Alex Bryan, director of passive strategies research at Morningstar in Chicago. ""I don't think it's obvious that it is going to be removed from the index, but it certainly is at risk."""
General Electric,2017-11,"GE's shares last week closed under $20 for the first time in more than five years, its struggles made clear by a disappointing third-quarter earnings report last month. The stock closed at $20.49 on Friday, marking a 35 percent decline in 2017."
General Electric,2017-11,"The stock price is now the lowest among Dow members. Because the Dow is a price-weighted index, unlike the benchmark S&P 500 <.SPX> which is influenced by the market values of its constituents, that means GE has the least impact on the Dow's daily swings."
General Electric,2017-11,"As of Friday, GE's weight stood at only 0.6 percent. By comparison, aircraft maker Boeing Co , whose stock is above $260, has a 7.7 percent weight."
General Electric,2017-11,"Changes to the Dow are made on an as-needed basis and selection is not governed by quantitative rules, according to published methodology for the index."
General Electric,2017-11,A spokesman for S&P Dow Jones Indices said the committee that oversees the Dow index meets regularly and that its discussions are confidential. GE declined to comment.
General Electric,2017-11,"Ivan Cajic, vice president for index and ETF research for ITG, said if the Dow were to make a change in the near future, GE is the likeliest to be removed."
General Electric,2017-11,"""I wouldn't be surprised if the company is safe for the time being and Dow Jones adopts a wait-and-see approach over the next few months to see how both the stock price and what the overall company looks like in the coming months,"" Cajic said."
General Electric,2017-11,"GE's fate as a Dow component may become clearer on Monday when CEO John Flannery, who took the helm on Aug. 1, is expected to detail the businesses the company plans to exit as it seeks to revive its financial prospects. [nL1N1NE1IM]"
General Electric,2017-11,"If GE starts selling big parts of its operation, the committee overseeing the Dow ""would give serious thought to whether or not the new GE, (excluding) those businesses, still represents as much a part of the economy as they once had,"" said Dave Nadig, CEO of ETF.com."
General Electric,2017-11,"""If they continue to spin off and restructure businesses, they are going to just shrink,"" said Chuck Carlson, contributing editor to Dow Theory Forecasts newsletter. ""That isn't necessarily the worst thing from a stock perspective, but they may start paring down to the point where the remaining businesses are similar to others that are in the Dow."""
General Electric,2017-11,"For now, GE still holds a major position in industries such as aviation, power and healthcare, and its market value of about $175 billion puts it in the middle of Dow components. Its historic place in the Dow may also be an argument for it to remain."
General Electric,2017-11,"If GE is removed from the Dow, it may not spark much immediate selling of the stock. Only about $20 billion is invested in exchange traded funds tied to the Dow, the vast majority in the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust , much less than the $380 billion in ETFs tied to the S&P 500, according to Lipper data. But the indirect impact of GE losing its blue-chip status could weigh in the longer term."
General Electric,2017-11,"It is not clear what company would replace GE in the Dow if it were kicked out. Three companies missing from the Dow with some of the largest market values - Amazon.com Inc , Google parent Alphabet Inc and Facebook Inc - have strikes against them."
General Electric,2017-11,"Share prices of online retailer Amazon.com and internet company Alphabet exceed $1,000 so they would warp the price-weighted Dow. Social media company Facebook only went public in 2012, which some market-watchers say is too recent to join the Dow."
General Electric,2017-11,"Industrial companies may find their applications denied. The sector represents about 22.5 percent of the Dow, which would be only marginally reduced by GE's departure. That level is more than twice the amount the sector represents in the S&P 500."
General Electric,2017-11,"According to its published methodology, the Dow covers all industries except for transportation and utilities, which are covered by other Dow Jones indexes, and that ""maintaining adequate sector representation within the indices is also a consideration in the selection process."""
General Electric,2017-11,"According to Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF and mutual fund research at CFRA: ""There are sectors more under-represented than industrials within the index that could encourage a replacement from another group."""

General Electric,2017-11,"NEW YORK, Nov 10 (Reuters) - General Electric Co is laying off sales staff and other employees in its software division, according to people familiar with the matter, ahead of new Chief Executive John Flannery's expected announcement on Monday of a plan to slash costs and jettison units in an effort to improve the company's profits."
General Electric,2017-11,"The layoffs at GE Digital, based in San Ramon, California, affect about 100 sales people in the Americas, including those who sell GE's Predix industrial-internet software, according to two sources."
General Electric,2017-11,"The software, central to GE's strategy under former Chief Executive Jeff Immelt, has been beset with technical problems, prompting GE to shift strategy. [nL1N1KQ1UU]"
General Electric,2017-11,"The 125-year-old conglomerate is considering job reductions across all of its diverse businesses, the sources said. Struggling units such as GE Power are facing significant staff cuts, while aviation and healthcare businesses could see lesser reductions, the sources said."
General Electric,2017-11,"Reuters reported in August that Flannery intended to reduce corporate staff at its Boston headquarters significantly, reductions that also have begun, according to sources. The company has also slowed construction of its headquarters. [nL2N1LG2NZ] [nL4N1KV5BS]"
General Electric,2017-11,"It is not clear how many more jobs Flannery now plans to cut, or how quickly. With 295,000 employees, even a 10 percent overall reduction would eliminate nearly 30,000 jobs."
General Electric,2017-11,"At the digital business, which has about 13,000 people including legacy information technology staff, GE is not only cutting sales staff. It is also reducing the number of developers who create the software, according to the two sources, speaking on condition of anonymity."
General Electric,2017-11,"GE declined to comment on specific staff reductions, but highlighted its plan to cut $3 billion in costs by the end of 2018. ""Those actions include but are not limited to, employee reductions which have been well underway for many months,"" spokeswoman Jennifer Erickson said."
General Electric,2017-11,"Since becoming CEO on Aug. 1, Flannery has doubled the amount of cost cutting targeted for next year to $2 billion, and is cutting $1 billion this year. He said he has found more than $20 billion in GE assets to sell and is looking at further changes to the portfolio beyond that."
General Electric,2017-11,"A 30-year GE veteran, Flannery is due to present the strategic changes and new financial targets at an investor meeting in New York on Monday. The plans also could include cutting GE's dividend for only the third time since the Great Depression."
General Electric,2017-11,Flannery has come under increasing pressure to boost GE's profit and share price after the company badly missed earnings expectations for the third quarter and lowered its financial outlook last month. [nL4N1MV3IM]

General Electric,2017-11,"SINGAPORE/NEW YORK, Nov 7 (Reuters) - General Electric Co is weighing options for its aircraft leasing operations, including the sale of all or part of the business, as Chief Executive John Flannery searches for new divestitures, according to people familiar with the matter."
General Electric,2017-11,"GE's move on GE Capital Aviation Services (GECAS), the world's second-largest lessor, follows expressions of interest from some of its competitors, the sources said."
General Electric,2017-11,"A spin-off of the business is also a possibility, the sources said, cautioning that GE may decide to keep the business."
General Electric,2017-11,The move comes at a time when a flood of Chinese funding is shaping the $260 billion-strong aircraft leasing industry as a significant new asset class.
General Electric,2017-11,GE declined to comment. The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential.
General Electric,2017-11,"GECAS has a fleet of roughly 1,300 planes worth an estimated $25 billion, ranking behind only U.S.-listed AerCap Holdings NV , which is estimated to have a $30 billion portfolio, according to data from industry consultancy Ascend Flightglobal. AerCap has a market value of $8.3 billion."
General Electric,2017-11,Some 40 percent of the airline industry's aircraft is leased to avoid the fixed costs of owning planes.
General Electric,2017-11,"Both GECAS and AerCap trace their roots to the collapsed (Guinness Peat Aviation) (GPA) leasing empire of Irish leasing baron, Tony Ryan, over two decades ago."
General Electric,2017-11,"Consolidation in the leasing sector has intensified in the last few years, as Asian competitors chip away at the market shares of GECAS and AerCap. GECAS has also been trimming its fleet in the last few years."
General Electric,2017-11,"""I believe that GECAS sees opportunity in the market to sell aircraft with leases attached to new emerging lessors which allows them to generate profit on these specific transactions whilst also managing their asset and customer concentration risk,"" said Rob Morris, global head of consultancy at Ascend Flightglobal."

General Electric,2017-11,"GE is looking to bounce back after what Flannery said last month were horrible results in the third quarter. He has argued that GE's strong businesses are being held back by others that ""drain investment and management resources without the prospect for a substantial reward""."

General Electric,2017-11,"BERLIN/FRANKFURT, Nov 6 (Reuters) - German lighting maker Osram expects further growth in profit and sales next year after posting 2017 results on Monday that matched expectations as it sold more automotive chips."
General Electric,2017-11,"The Munich-based company, which competes with Philips Lighting and General Electric , plans to keep up investments and has teamed up with Continental to develop lighting products for the auto industry next year. [nL5N1NC5PD]"
General Electric,2017-11,"""The strategy is right,"" the Munich-based firm said late on Monday. ""Osram will continue to grow in 2018 despite negative currency effects and investments."""
General Electric,2017-11,"Core earnings (adjusted EBITDA) at Osram rose more than six percent to 695 million euros ($807 million) on sales that rose eight percent to more than 4 billion euros, it said."
General Electric,2017-11,"That gave it an EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) margin of 16.8 percent, adjusted for special items, compared with its forecast for a margin of 16.5 to 17.5 percent."
General Electric,2017-11,"Osram said it is targeting adjusted EBITDA of around 700 million euros next year, forecasting sales to increase between 5.5 and 7.5 percent. It plans a dividend of 1.10 euros per share."
General Electric,2017-11,"Osram had forecast comparable revenue growth of 7-9 percent for its fiscal year to end-September, diluted earnings per share of between 2.70 and 2.90 euros, and free cash flow at break-even level."
General Electric,2017-11,"""We delivered another peak year in 2017 on the back of a strong performance whilst also making good progress on our way to becoming a high-tech company,"" Chief Executive Olaf Berlien said in a statement."

General Electric,2017-11,"Osram makes about 45 percent of its sales from specialty lighting (SL) which is mainly traditional LED, 35 percent from opto semiconductors (OS) which is mainly automotive, and 20 percent from lighting solutions and systems (LS) for buildings and streets."
General Electric,2017-11,"Under Berlien, Osram has undertaken an ambitious project to build a billion-euro LED chip plant in Malaysia, which will cater mainly for the general street and building lighting market when it ramps up next year."
General Electric,2017-11,"The move was controversial with shareholders who had hoped it would focus on the highly profitable automotive niche, and caused a cooling of relations with former parent Siemens until Siemens sold its stake last month."
General Electric,2017-11,Osram makes about half its revenues in U.S. dollars but most of its costs are in other currencies.
General Electric,2017-11,"Philips Lighting, which unlike Osram still has a traditional bulbs business, reported flat core profit and a 4 percent decline in quarterly sales last month."
General Electric,2017-11,"Its LED lights, professional lighting, and home networking divisions all grew on both top and bottom lines although the United States showed some weakness on slow demand from the housing industry and small and medium-sized businesses."
General Electric,2017-11,"GE reported a 16 percent drop in lighting revenues but a turnaround to a small profit in the third quarter, with an operating margin of 4.8 percent, partly due to a running down of its traditional lighting business and a restructuring."
General Electric,2017-11,Lighting is seen as one of the businesses GE could sell after vowing to dispose of billions of dollars' worth of assets after poor quarterly results. ($1 = 0.8611 euros)

General Electric,2017-11,"NEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO, Nov 2 (Reuters) - A U.S. Republican tax bill unveiled on Thursday offers big multinational companies more benefits than minuses, and could free up extra cash for investments, dividends or improving balance sheets."
General Electric,2017-11,"The measure, which faces a long road ahead with final approval by Congress uncertain, would slash the corporate tax rate, a change U.S. companies have been seeking for years."
General Electric,2017-11,But it might hamper some highly leveraged companies' ability to deduct debt interest. It could also strip some tax breaks from sectors such as energy and pharmaceuticals.
General Electric,2017-11,"""This bill would give most companies a lot to cheer about, but we're getting a muted reaction in the market because there will be a lot of pushback"" from companies that could lose some of their tax breaks, said Pete Santoro, a portfolio manager of the $3.8 billion Columbia Dividend Income fund."
General Electric,2017-11,"The 429-page tax bill would be the largest overhaul of the U.S. tax system since the 1980s. It would cut the corporate rate to 20 percent from 35 percent, reduce tax rates on individuals and end certain popular tax breaks, including deductions for state and local taxes and half the interest deduction on new mortgages."
General Electric,2017-11,It would also create a new 10 percent tax on U.S. companies' foreign subsidiaries and impose a 20 percent tax on payments that foreign businesses operating in the United States make from their American operations.
General Electric,2017-11,President Donald Trump told House Republicans he hoped to sign the bill into law by Nov. 23. Such a move would stand as the Trump administration's first major legislative victory.
General Electric,2017-11,"The overall market reaction to the bill was mixed, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average rising 0.3 percent while the broader S&P 500 index was flat."
General Electric,2017-11,"Despite the uncertainty, investors and analysts looked for those companies that would see the largest impact if the bill was approved. Chief among them: companies such as General Electric Co , which has more than $10 billion in foreign assets such as property and equipment that would be subject to a one-time tax of 5 percent, totaling $2.1 billion, according to Morgan Stanley."
General Electric,2017-11,"Shares of General Electric fell nearly 1 percent on Thursday, continuing a nearly 20 percent decline over the last month spurred by analyst downgrades and fears that the company may cut its dividend. GE did not immediately respond to requests for comment."
General Electric,2017-11,"Renewable energy companies and pharmaceutical companies that receive tax credits for clinical testing expenses for certain drugs would also face increased costs if the Republican bill passes, said Brian Jacobsen, chief portfolio strategist at Wells Fargo Funds Management. Yet the removal of those tax breaks makes it less likely the bill will pass, he added."
General Electric,2017-11,"""What makes this tax reform rather than just tax cuts is that they're taking on a lot of provisions that target specific industries. That's why, while taxes are hard, tax reform is harder,"" he said."
General Electric,2017-11,"Among potential winners are technology companies such as Apple Inc , Microsoft Corp and Cisco Systems , which hold more than 10 percent of their market values in cash abroad, said Rob Martin, an economist at UBS."
General Electric,2017-11,"A 12 percent tax bill - versus 35 percent now - on repatriated profits is ""higher than some companies hoped for but low enough that I think they'll be happy,"" he said."
General Electric,2017-11,Investors expect the specifics of the bill to change as corporations lobby to keep or insert favorable tax breaks.
General Electric,2017-11,"""In its current form there is a zero percent chance that this passes,"" said Linda Bakhshian, a co-portfolio manager of the $1.2 billion Federated Equity Income fund ."

General Electric,2017-11,"COPENHAGEN/FRANKFURT, Nov 3 (Reuters) - The world's largest wind turbine makers said a proposed Republican tax bill that would cut support for the industry in the U.S. would put its businesses and future investment at risk, in a rare public criticism on Friday of government proposals."
General Electric,2017-11,"Equipment makers operating in the world's second-largest wind turbine market have relied upon so-called production tax credits (PTC) agreed in 2015.

General Electric,2017-11,"""Siemens Gamesa is disappointed in this step backwards. Our company is committed to this market and continues to invest in factories. A tax policy that has certainty is required for investment,"" the group said in an e-mailed statement."
General Electric,2017-11,"Vestas said the proposal was ""disappointing"". GE said the group was carefully reviewing the details of the bill, which could still face changes as it needs to pass both the House of Representatives and the Senate."
General Electric,2017-11,The tax credit scheme was considered critical to enabling wind projects to compete with fossil fuel plants and the wind energy industry has said the proposed cuts put $50 billion in planned investment at risk.[nL2N1N8251]
General Electric,2017-11,The planned legislative step comes after long-standing industry concerns that Trump might curb support for renewable energy to promote coal and other fossil fuels instead.
General Electric,2017-11,"""Even though Mr. Trump and team are not necessarily known for their adherence to the 'usual', we feel they are unlikely to be unaware of the wide-ranging consequences ... of the government essentially breaking open private contracts,"" Barclays wrote."

General Electric,2017-11,"The brokerage expects another consequence of the proposed PCT cut to be a fall in 2019 core earnings (EBITDA) at Vestas and Nordex of about 18 percent and 10 percent for Siemens Gamesa, whose market share has fallen in recent years. [nL8N1N74B7]"

General Electric,2017-11,"NEW YORK, Nov 2 (Reuters) - Two weeks after General Electric Co's new chief executive vowed to shed $20 billion of assets, a shareholder has sued the company for failing to divulge its problems sooner and posting quarterly results that were ""unacceptable, to say the least."""
General Electric,2017-11,"In a proposed class-action lawsuit filed Wednesday night in the U.S. District Court in Manhattan, Jihad Hachem accused GE of securities fraud for concealing how falling demand, excess inventory and higher costs would cause it fall far short of its 2017 profit forecast, and led to an inflated stock price."
General Electric,2017-11,"GE's market value slid $11 billion in the two trading days after the Boston-based company on Oct. 20 reported a third-quarter profit of 29 cents per share, below the 49 cents expected by analysts, and cut its 2017 profit forecast by one-third. [nL4N1MV3IM]"
General Electric,2017-11,Several analysts shortly thereafter cut their ratings or share price targets for GE.
General Electric,2017-11,"Other defendants include Chief Executive John Flannery, his predecessor Jeffrey Immelt, and former Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey Bornstein, who left that position this week."
General Electric,2017-11,"""The complaint appears to focus on projections conveyed during earnings calls, which by definition, were forward-looking statements,"" GE spokeswoman Jennifer Friedman said in an email. ""We intend to vigorously defend against these claims."""
General Electric,2017-11,"Shareholders have long been frustrated by GE, a maker of power plants, jet engines, medical devices and other industrial equipment and a member of the Dow Jones Industrial Average <.DJI>."
General Electric,2017-11,"Through Wednesday, GE's share price had fallen 51 percent in the 16 years since Jack Welch, who oversaw much of its growth, passed the CEO baton to Immelt. Investors who reinvested dividends suffered a roughly 19 percent negative total return."
General Electric,2017-11,"In contrast, the Standard & Poor's 500 <.SPX> rose about 133 percent over that time period."
General Electric,2017-11,"Though Immelt had shed some units, Flannery said GE must now focus on its more promising businesses, and hold managers accountable for poor performance."
General Electric,2017-11,"Flannery, a 30-year GE veteran who took over on Aug. 1, has made some early, symbolic cuts, including executive perks and the use of corporate jets."
General Electric,2017-11,"In his complaint, Hachem accused the defendants of having from July 21 to Oct. 20, made materially false and misleading statements about its business in public statements and filings, and knew that doing so would mislead investors."
General Electric,2017-11,Hachem is represented by the law firms Glancy Prongay & Murray and Kirby McInerney and is seeking unspecified damages.
General Electric,2017-11,Securities fraud class actions have become more plentiful in federal courts after recent rulings in Delaware state courts dissuaded some plaintiffs from suing there.

General Electric,2017-11,"FRANKFURT/MADRID, Nov 1 (Reuters) - Siemens Gamesa has fallen behind biggest rival Vestas in the race for orders in the United States, hurt by a perceived lack of technology investment and a less centralised supply chain in the world's second-biggest wind turbine market."
General Electric,2017-11,"The U.S. battleground is among the biggest for western turbine manufacturers, with the U.S. Energy Information Administration forecasting the addition of 6 gigawatts (GW) of capacity this year and a further 8 GW in 2018."
General Electric,2017-11,"But things have not gone well for Siemens Gamesa since the merger that brought together Siemens' wind power division with rival Gamesa this year, even though it has described the United States as critical to its success."
General Electric,2017-11,The merger was aimed at giving the combined entity an edge in an increasingly competitive global market amid sector consolidation that saw Germany's Nordex buy the turbine unit of Spain's Acciona and General Electric take over France's Alstom.
General Electric,2017-11,"""Siemens Gamesa has struggled to bring an attractive turbine to North America,"" said one senior industry adviser who declined to be named to protect business relations."
General Electric,2017-11,"There is a view that the company has not done enough to improve its geared turbines, the adviser added."
General Electric,2017-11,"Siemens has mainly sold gearbox-based turbines in the United States, where they are the preferred model, but its market share has dwindled in recent years while that of Vestas has increased steadily."
General Electric,2017-11,"Complementing its portfolio and recouping lost market share in the United States were among the main drivers of the tie-up with Gamesa, which has a broader offering of gearbox-based turbines and is expected to fare better locally."
General Electric,2017-11,Siemens Gamesa will present its new strategy in February and sources close to the group said chances are that the joint venture may use more of Gamesa's turbines in the United States in future.
General Electric,2017-11,"""After the merger the combined company has greater scale in the U.S., which will enable us to increase the wind turbine models and the volumes produced in the country,"" Siemens Gamesa said in an e-mailed statement."
General Electric,2017-11,"Improvement is badly needed after the group announced the closure of its blade production operation in Canada, job cuts at its nacelle manufacturing plant in Kansas and writedowns on the U.S. business that caused a profit warning and management reshuffle. [nL8N1MR1LJ] [nL8N1MV4D9]"
General Electric,2017-11,Siemens Gamesa did end a losing streak this week when it reported U.S. orders for 784 megawatts (MW) of capacity. It has also won an upgrade contract it says is worth 190 MW. [nFWN1N60CD]
General Electric,2017-11,"But that is still less than half of what has been taken in by Vestas. The Danish company's order book is brimming with 2,086 MW in announced U.S. deals, close to a third of its total orders globally."
General Electric,2017-11,Fresh data from the American Wind Energy Association (AWEA) also shows that Vestas is much more successful than Siemens Gamesa in striking deals for projects. The association's latest quarterly market report said Vestas has taken 47 percent of the U.S. wind projects under construction or in advanced development that have announced a supplier.
General Electric,2017-11,"Siemens Gamesa's share stood at 8 percent, or 1,258 MW, at the end of the third quarter."
General Electric,2017-11,"""The need to catch up will keep a lid on stock momentum for at least another couple of quarters,"" Barclays analysts said, forecasting a ""pedestrian"" outlook for 2018, which they expect to be issued along with fourth-quarter results on Nov. 6."
General Electric,2017-11,"Barclays expects next year's sales to be down by more than a fifth from its forecast for 2017 numbers. The analysts are forecasting sales of 8.48 billion euros ($9.88 billion) in 2018, well below the 10.14 billion Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S estimate."
General Electric,2017-11,"In the medium term, the merger is expected to help Siemens Gamesa to gain a stronger foothold in the United States and recover some of this year's 30 percent lost market value -- a far cry from the 25 percent gain for shares in Vestas."
General Electric,2017-11,"Regardless of the actual products, Siemens Gamesa must also find a way to compete with the centralised supply chain that Vestas has built in the United States."
General Electric,2017-11,"Vestas operates four factories making towers, blades and nacelles in the state of Colorado, located in the middle of the windy central plains corridor of the United States, which analysts say is a big advantage."
General Electric,2017-11,"""We think the key is localising the product,"" said Chris Brown, president of Vestas's sales and service division in the United States and Canada."
General Electric,2017-11,"Siemens Gamesa also has a strong presence in the region, with blade and nacelle production in Iowa and Kansas, though it does not identify the local providers from which it sources its towers. In the past it has bought towers from Broadwind Energy , which has production sites in Wisconsin and Texas."

General Electric,2017-11,"{{20171101T163953.000+0000}}Siemens Gamesa needs more wind in its sails as Vestas stretches U.S. leadFRANKFURT/MADRID, Nov 1 (Reuters)"
General Electric,2017-11,"FRANKFURT/MADRID, Nov 1 (Reuters) - Siemens Gamesa has fallen behind biggest rival Vestas in the race for orders in the United States, hurt by a perceived lack of technology investment and a less centralised supply chain in the world's second-biggest wind turbine market."
General Electric,2017-11,"The U.S. battleground is among the biggest for western turbine manufacturers, with the U.S. Energy Information Administration forecasting the addition of 6 gigawatts (GW) of capacity this year and a further 8 GW in 2018."
General Electric,2017-11,"But things have not gone well for Siemens Gamesa since the merger that brought together Siemens' wind power division with rival Gamesa this year, even though it has described the United States as critical to its success."
General Electric,2017-11,The merger was aimed at giving the combined entity an edge in an increasingly competitive global market amid sector consolidation that saw Germany's Nordex buy the turbine unit of Spain's Acciona and General Electric take over France's Alstom.
General Electric,2017-11,"""Siemens Gamesa has struggled to bring an attractive turbine to North America,"" said one senior industry adviser who declined to be named to protect business relations."
General Electric,2017-11,"There is a view that the company has not done enough to improve its geared turbines, the adviser added."
General Electric,2017-11,"Siemens has mainly sold gearbox-based turbines in the United States, where they are the preferred model, but its market share has dwindled in recent years while that of Vestas has increased steadily."
General Electric,2017-11,"Complementing its portfolio and recouping lost market share in the United States were among the main drivers of the tie-up with Gamesa, which has a broader offering of gearbox-based turbines and is expected to fare better locally."
General Electric,2017-11,Siemens Gamesa will present its new strategy in February and sources close to the group said chances are that the joint venture may use more of Gamesa's turbines in the United States in future.
General Electric,2017-11,"""After the merger the combined company has greater scale in the U.S., which will enable us to increase the wind turbine models and the volumes produced in the country,"" Siemens Gamesa said in an e-mailed statement."
General Electric,2017-11,"Improvement is badly needed after the group announced the closure of its blade production operation in Canada, job cuts at its nacelle manufacturing plant in Kansas and writedowns on the U.S. business that caused a profit warning and management reshuffle. [nL8N1MR1LJ] [nL8N1MV4D9]"
General Electric,2017-11,Siemens Gamesa did end a losing streak this week when it reported U.S. orders for 784 megawatts (MW) of capacity. It has also won an upgrade contract it says is worth 190 MW. [nFWN1N60CD]
General Electric,2017-11,"But that is still less than half of what has been taken in by Vestas. The Danish company's order book is brimming with 2,086 MW in announced U.S. deals, close to a third of its total orders globally."
General Electric,2017-11,Fresh data from the American Wind Energy Association (AWEA) also shows that Vestas is much more successful than Siemens Gamesa in striking deals for projects. The association's latest quarterly market report said Vestas has taken 47 percent of the U.S. wind projects under construction or in advanced development that have announced a supplier.
General Electric,2017-11,"Siemens Gamesa's share stood at 8 percent, or 1,258 MW, at the end of the third quarter."

The opinions expressed are her own.) (Refiles to fix punctuation in third, fifth and sixth paragraphs, and to fix mispelling of ""Cheniere Energy"" in third paragraph.)"
General Electric,2017-11,"WASHINGTON, Nov 1 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Finance services firms look sidelined as the White House focuses on finding easy China wins. Energy and industrial companies like General Electric will have a chance to cozy up to Beijing's new leadership during U.S. President Donald Trump's upcoming Asia trip, but Wall Street isn't coming along. The U.S. business delegation's composition reflects Trump's desires to find low-hanging fruit deals to tout domestically, but low expectations for deeper concessions."
General Electric,2017-11,"U.S. corporate delegates include GE, Honeywell , Thermo Fisher and Cheniere Energy . They arrive at an opportune time to meet Chinese leaders, who just wrapped up a major party congress and rolled out new leadership slate at the end of October."
General Electric,2017-11,"However, the United States remains locked in contentious talks over improving market access for American firms in the People's Republic, including financial services. A senior administration official said Tuesday that progress has become more difficult. China is retrenching under President Xi Jinping, who has shown scant respect for market-based principles."
General Electric,2017-11,"While there have been some advances on raising ownership equity caps in financial services, a deal has not been finalized, and the lack of representation by big names like Citi or Goldman Sachs on this trip suggests no major compromise is nigh. William Zarit, chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, said he hoped the one-off deals don't overshadow the need to push for structural changes."
General Electric,2017-11,"Convincing Beijing to expose its domestic financial industry to more foreign competition is a tougher pitch than selling goods. The Trump administration is not indifferent to the financial sector's concerns, but low expectations for photo-op concessions have kept the industry at the back of the line this time around."
General Electric,2017-11,"- U.S. President Donald Trump will begin his 12-day Asia trip on Nov. 3, with scheduled stops in Japan, South Korea, China, Vietnam, and the Philippines. North Korea and economic relations are expected to be the main topics of discussion during the visit."
General Electric,2017-11,"- Among the companies listed as participating in the delegation to China are General Electric, Honeywell, Thermo Fisher and Cherniere Energy. The Trump administration also hopes to announce a 700-mile pipeline deal with China Petroleum & Chemical Corp., known as Sinopec, in Texas and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The firm is expected to partner with Massachusetts-based ArcLight Capital and Connecticut-based Freepoint Commodities."
