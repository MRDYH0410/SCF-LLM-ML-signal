ConocoPhillips,2017-2,{{20170301T163332.078+0000}}UPDATE 2-Eni looks to strong project pipeline to boost growth* Sees operating cash flow of 47 bln euros by 2020
ConocoPhillips,2017-2,"MILAN/LONDON, March 1 (Reuters) - Italy's Eni reported its first quarterly profit in 18 months and said it expects oil and gas production to rise 3 percent per year over the next four years after a string of high profile discoveries."
ConocoPhillips,2017-2,"Eni, the biggest foreign oil major in Africa which accounts for more than 50 percent of its output, has made major gas finds in Mozambique and Egypt, and said on Wednesday it was looking to add up to 3 billion barrels of new resources out to 2020 even as it cut investments by 13 percent."
ConocoPhillips,2017-2,Earlier Eni beat expectations with fourth quarter adjusted net profit of 459 million euros ($484 million) helped by lower spending and higher oil prices.
ConocoPhillips,2017-2,"""We've never had such a strong set of projects in our history,"" Chief Executive Claudio Descalzi said during a conference call with analysts on the group's 2017-2020 plan."
ConocoPhillips,2017-2,State-owned Eni said its organic reserve replacement ratio -- a measure of its ability to find hydrocarbons -- stood at 193 percent in 2016 compared to a 35 percent peer average.
ConocoPhillips,2017-2,"Exxon Mobil Corp , the world's largest publicly traded oil producer, failed to replace 100 percent of its oil and gas reserves with new projects last year while ConocoPhillips Corp revised down proved reserves. [nL1N1G723D]"
ConocoPhillips,2017-2,"Eni, which will reap the benefit of a ramp-up at Kazakhstan's giant Kashagan field, expects output this year to jump by 5 percent as key projects in Angola, Ghana, Indonesia and Egypt come on stream ahead of schedule."
ConocoPhillips,2017-2,"To deal with the gas finds, the company said it aimed to develop its liquefied natural gas (LNG) business."
ConocoPhillips,2017-2,"""We can create a strong portfolio... the aim is to reach 10 million tonnes of LNG per year by 2025,"" Descalzi said."
ConocoPhillips,2017-2,"Since taking over as CEO in 2014, Descalzi has refocused the group on the upstream (E&P) business of finding oil and gas."
ConocoPhillips,2017-2,"The veteran oilman, previously head of Eni's E&P unit, has won plaudits from investors for steering Eni through the oil market slump by discovering prize acreage, cutting costs and selling assets."
ConocoPhillips,2017-2,But his mandate comes up for renewal in the coming weeks and there is some concern his position could be undermined by a corruption probe over a Nigerian oilfield. [nL5N1FT439]
ConocoPhillips,2017-2,"""Upstream growth at Eni is well supported by significant organic resource access and while transformation is still in progress there's lots of value still to unlock,"" said Santander analyst Jason Kenney."
ConocoPhillips,2017-2,"Eni said it would pay a dividend of 0.8 euros per share in 2017, the same as the previous year."
ConocoPhillips,2017-2,"Under its so-called ""dual exploration"" strategy, Eni aims to sell down stakes in oil and gas fields it operates to raise cash to fund future development and support dividends."
ConocoPhillips,2017-2,"The company, which will generate cash flow of 47 billion euros from operations over the next 4 years, said it was targeting asset sales of 5-7 billion euros to 2020."
ConocoPhillips,2017-2,"""Around 60 percent of that will be in 2017-2018 and some 3-4 billion euros will come from diluting our stakes in fields we operate,"" CFO Massimo Mondazzi said."
ConocoPhillips,2017-2,Eni last year sold an overall stake of 40 percent in its giant Zohr field in Egypt to Rosneft and BP for around $2.1 billion. [nL5N1E722C]
ConocoPhillips,2017-2,Sources have said Exxon Mobil has clinched a deal to buy a stake in the group's Area 4 concession in Mozambique but that an announcement would not be made for some time.
ConocoPhillips,2017-2,"Descalzi said a deal to sell a stake in the Mozambique field was ""not far"" away, adding Eni would remain operator of a part of the field."
ConocoPhillips,2017-2,"At 1627 GMT Eni shares were up 2.8 percent, outperforming a 1.6 percent rise in Europe's oil index <.SXEP>. ($1 = 0.9474 euros)"

ConocoPhillips,2017-2,"The U.S. oil major said developed and undeveloped reserves of bitumen - the heavy viscous oil found in northern Alberta's remote oil sands - totalled 1.2 billion barrels at the end of 2016, down from 2.4 billion barrels at the end of 2015."
ConocoPhillips,2017-2,"The oil sands have some of the highest full-cycle breakeven costs in the world, with new thermal projects needing U.S. crude prices around $60 a barrel. Crude futures settled at $54.33 a barrel on Tuesday."
ConocoPhillips,2017-2,"The U.S. Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) document provides a detailed breakdown of the global reserves cut Conoco announced in quarterly results in early February, when it debooked 1.75 billion barrels of oil equivalent of reserves. [nL4N1FN2QL]"
ConocoPhillips,2017-2,"Al Hirshberg, Conoco's executive vice president for production, drilling and projects, told investors on the quarterly call the company expects to rebook the reserves if current prices hold."
ConocoPhillips,2017-2,"Likewise Martin King, an analyst with GMP FirstEnergy in Calgary, said the debooking likely had more to do with SEC rules requiring companies to evaluate economic reserves at year-end."
ConocoPhillips,2017-2,But the fact that the oil sands make up 70 percent of the reduction underlines how much of Canada's resources are uneconomic in a weaker oil environment.
ConocoPhillips,2017-2,"""They (the oil sands) are at the upper end of the cost curve,"" said Judith Dwarkin, chief economist at RS Energy Group in Calgary. ""It may or may not speak to future similar events from other producers."""
ConocoPhillips,2017-2,"Calgary-based Imperial Oil Ltd , which is majority-owned by Exxon Mobil Corp , debooked 2.6 billion barrels of reserves in January."
ConocoPhillips,2017-2,"ConocoPhillips made the reserve reductions at the Surmont, Foster Creek, Christina Lake and Narrow Lakes projects."
ConocoPhillips,2017-2,"Surmont is operated by ConocoPhillips and a joint venture with Total E&P Canada, a unit of Total SA , and the other three are joint ventures run by Cenovus Energy Inc ."
ConocoPhillips,2017-2,"Total also debooked undeveloped reserves at Surmont, according to SEC filings. But Cenovus, which reports to Canadian securities authorities, said its total proved reserves including non-oil sands operations rose 5 percent in 2016 versus a year earlier."
ConocoPhillips,2017-2,Cenovus spokesman Reg Curren said the company assumed different rules relating to reserves reporting in Canada and the United States were behind the difference.

ConocoPhillips,2017-2,"TORONTO/CALGARY, Feb 16 (Reuters) - ConocoPhillips has decided to sell several of its Canadian conventional natural gas assets in a deal that could fetch as much as $2 billion as the biggest U.S. independent oil producer pulls back further from Canada, people familiar with the matter told Reuters."
ConocoPhillips,2017-2,"The company expects the sale to bring down its debt load and rebalance its portfolio, the people said, declining to be identified as the process is confidential."
ConocoPhillips,2017-2,"Several investment banks have made pitches to ConocoPhillips in recent weeks and the Houston-based company is close to hiring a financial adviser to run a formal sale process, the people said."
ConocoPhillips,2017-2,"The company is looking to identify properties, then bundle and sell them as packages, the people said."
ConocoPhillips,2017-2,"When contacted by Reuters, ConocoPhillips spokesman Rob Evans pointed to an announcement last November that said the company could sell up to $8 billion in natural gas assets."
ConocoPhillips,2017-2,"Evans said that disposition program ""largely focused on non-strategic North American gas assets, including select assets in Canada."""
ConocoPhillips,2017-2,"The Houston-based company is expected to sell some of its Western Canadian assets, which include Deep Basin, running from northwestern Alberta to northeastern British Columbia; Clearwater and Kaybob-Edson in west-central Alberta; and Plains, which straddles parts of British Columbia, Alberta and Saskatchewan."
ConocoPhillips,2017-2,"ConocoPhillips does not plan to offload its oil sands properties and assets it owns in the Montney region, the people said. Most of the rest of its Canadian assets could soon be on the block, they added."
ConocoPhillips,2017-2,"Major Canadian energy companies such as Canadian Natural Resources Ltd could be interested in the assets that will be up for sale, the sources said. Canadian Natural has shown increasing interest in natural gas properties and is one of the country's biggest natural gas producers."
ConocoPhillips,2017-2,Canadian Natural did not immediately offer a comment when reached by Reuters.
ConocoPhillips,2017-2,"About two years ago, ConocoPhillips sold certain oil and gas assets in Western Canada, some of which were picked up by Canadian Natural."

ConocoPhillips,2017-2,"{{20170215T013509.858+0000}}UPDATE 1-Origin to take A$1.9 bln charge on LNG, exploration assets(Adds analyst comment, gas assets writedowns)"
ConocoPhillips,2017-2,"MELBOURNE, Feb 15 (Reuters) - Origin Energy tweaked up its earnings forecast but warned on Wednesday it will book a A$1.89 billion ($1.45 billion) charge in its half-year results, mainly on its stake in the Australia Pacific liquefied natural gas (APLNG) project."
ConocoPhillips,2017-2,"Origin raised the bottom end of its forecast range for annual underlying earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) by 3 percent to A$2.45 billion, but kept the top end of the forecast at A$2.62 billion."
ConocoPhillips,2017-2,"It is due to report half-year results on Thursday, the first results under its new chief executive, Frank Calabria, who took the helm in October."
ConocoPhillips,2017-2,"Origin's shares jumped as much as 2.3 percent to a 17-month high following the announcement, but shed those gains to trade flat by midday."
ConocoPhillips,2017-2,"Analysts said the A$1.03 billion impairment charge on its 37.5 percent stake in the APLNG project was not a big surprise in the wake of writedowns taken by rivals, like Santos Ltd , on their LNG projects last year."
ConocoPhillips,2017-2,"""The market is probably just seeing it as clearing the decks for the new CEO,"" said a Sydney-based analyst who declined to be named as he was not authorised to speak to the media."
ConocoPhillips,2017-2,"APLNG, operated by ConocoPhillips , is one of three coal seam gas-to-LNG plants which opened over the past two years in the northeastern state of Queensland amid a sharp slump in global oil and gas prices."
ConocoPhillips,2017-2,APLNG had no immediate comment on the impairment. Origin said it was mostly due to a change in assumptions on U.S. dollar interest rates.
ConocoPhillips,2017-2,"Origin also flagged it would book a A$578 million charge against its Browse Basin assets, which it bought for US$600 million in 2014, as it does not see them being developed anytime soon to supply ConocoPhillips' Darwin LNG plant."
ConocoPhillips,2017-2,"It said it believed another asset in the area, the Caldita-Barossa fields owned by ConocoPhillips, Santos and PetroChina <601857.SS>, was likely to be chosen to supply Darwin LNG when its existing gas source, Bayu-Undan, runs out early in the next decade."
ConocoPhillips,2017-2,"Origin also flagged a A$170 million charge against the exploration assets which it plans to spin off in an initial public offering this year, which had been expected to fetch around A$1 billion. [nL4N1E053X] ($1 = 1.3034 Australian dollars)"

ConocoPhillips,2017-2,Feb 8 (Reuters) - A World Bank panel has ordered Ecuador to pay $380 million in damages to a subsidiary of ConocoPhillips for unlawfully expropriating the company's oil investments.
ConocoPhillips,2017-2,The settlement is related to an ongoing case where the Houston-based energy company had been seeking compensation related to confiscation of assets.
ConocoPhillips,2017-2,"The subsidiary, Burlington Resources, had stakes in two blocks operated by French oil and gas company Perenco that were taken over by Ecuadorean President Rafael Correa's government in 2009."
ConocoPhillips,2017-2,"Ecuador had said that the consortium abandoned the area illegally in a dispute over taxes, whereas the companies argued that the Correa government expropriated the assets."
ConocoPhillips,2017-2,"""The tribunal's decision on damages sends a clear message that governments cannot expropriate investments without fair compensation,"" Janet Carrig, senior vice president of ConocoPhillips's legal and general counsel, said in a statement."
ConocoPhillips,2017-2,"The Ecuadorean attorney general's office, however, said it would seek to have the judgment annulled."
ConocoPhillips,2017-2,It noted that the plaintiff was awarded only a fraction of the $1.515 billion that it had sought.
ConocoPhillips,2017-2,"""Attending to the arguments presented by the defense, (the decision) limited the compensation to 22 percent of what the oil company had initially demanded,"" the attorney general's office said in a statement."
ConocoPhillips,2017-2,"The timing and manner of collecting the amount are yet to be determined, said ConocoPhillips, the world's largest independent exploration and production company."
ConocoPhillips,2017-2,"In a separate decision, the tribunal ruled that Ecuador was entitled to $42 million for limited environmental and infrastructure impacts associated with the operations of the consortium comprising Burlington and Perenco."
