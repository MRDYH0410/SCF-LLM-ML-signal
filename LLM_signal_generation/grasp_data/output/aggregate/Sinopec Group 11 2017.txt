Sinopec Group,2017-11,* Oil producers pact will mean more long-haul U.S. volumes -Frontline
Sinopec Group,2017-11,"SINGAPORE, Dec 1 (Reuters) - Charter rates for very large crude carriers (VLCCs), which fell below break-even levels on routes from the Middle East this week, are expected to remain under pressure as too many ships chase too few cargoes, brokers said."
Sinopec Group,2017-11,"""This is the worst in terms of earnings sentiment for winter. Wake me up when December ends,"" said a Singapore-based supertanker broker on Friday."
Sinopec Group,2017-11,That came as major oil producers agreed on Thursday to extend oil output cuts until the end of 2018 in a move that is expected to open the market to increased crude volumes from the United States and other exporters. [nL8N1O01I9]
Sinopec Group,2017-11,Increased exports from the United States could potentially support VLCC rates because longer voyage distances to Asia would cut the number of vessels available for charter.
Sinopec Group,2017-11,"""The effect (of the output cuts) we have found neutral as the reduction in Middle East export volumes was replaced by increased volumes from Atlantic Basin,"" said Robert Hvide Macleod, chief executive of leading tanker owner Frontline Management."
Sinopec Group,2017-11,"Macleod told Reuters that as a result of the continued cap ""we believe the 'new trades' will develop further - long-term positive for shipping""."
Sinopec Group,2017-11,"Unipec, the trading arm of Asia's largest oil refiner Sinopec <600028.SS>, signalled last week its intention to double the volume of U.S. oil it will import next year from 6 million tonnes this year. [nL3N1NU1SB]"
Sinopec Group,2017-11,"There are around 24-30 VLCC cargoes a month from the U.S.-Caribbean region, brokers said."
Sinopec Group,2017-11,"""With crude from the Caribbean-U.S. Gulf area being heavy sour crude it will only find a home - China and India - which have the refineries that can process them,"" said Ashok Sharma, managing director of Singapore shipbroker BRS Baxi Far East."
Sinopec Group,2017-11,"""There is not going to be an instant reflex in the tanker markets to the oil producers' decision on Thursday. But shale oil producers will increase production,"" Sharma said."
Sinopec Group,2017-11,Brokers estimated there were an average of around 15 fewer VLCC cargoes per month from the Middle East since the cuts were implemented in January.
Sinopec Group,2017-11,"That, together with the delivery of around 52 new VLCCs this year, has increased the number of ships available for charter, putting pressure on freight rates."
Sinopec Group,2017-11,"Supertanker earnings for a voyage from the Middle East to Japan dropped to around $18,200 per day on Thursday, compared with $32,600 per day at the fourth quarter peak on Oct. 17, data on the Reuters Eikon terminal showed."
Sinopec Group,2017-11,"That compared with daily break-even costs of $20,000-$22,000, brokers said."
Sinopec Group,2017-11,"""Rates of under $20,000 a day for December loading have not been seen for a long time,"" Sharma added."
Sinopec Group,2017-11,"VLCC rates on the Middle East-to-Japan route <.BAGJ> dropped to 56.50 on the Worldscale measure on Thursday, the lowest since Sept. 29, from W63.50 last week."

Sinopec Group,2017-11,"(Updating to add Xi comment and West Virginia reference in paras 12, 13)"
Sinopec Group,2017-11,"BEIJING, Nov 9 (Reuters) - China's biggest state oil company Sinopec, one of the country's top banks and its sovereign wealth fund agreed on Thursday to develop a $43 billion natural gas project in Alaska, as the cash-poor U.S. state seeks to revive its dwindling energy industry."
Sinopec Group,2017-11,The deal had been in the works since April and was sealed during U.S. President Donald Trump's state visit to China. It is the second-largest pact among a slew of agreements signed during the trip between the world's top two economies that are worth as much as $250 billion. [nL3N1NF31U]
Sinopec Group,2017-11,"Sinopec <601988.SS>, China Investment Corp [CIC.UL] and the Bank of China <601988.SS> will work over the next year with the state government to hammer out the details of their involvement in the Alaska LNG project, according to a statement from project sponsor Alaska Gasline Development Corp (AGDC)."
Sinopec Group,2017-11,"Alaska LNG is designed to carry natural gas from fields in the North Slope through an 800-mile (1,287 km) pipeline to south central Alaska for in-state use and to a liquefaction plant to produce up to 20 million tons of LNG per year for export. [nL2N1N10A5]"
Sinopec Group,2017-11,"Sinopec will buy some of the LNG and may supply engineering work for the project's construction, Bank of China will provide funding and CIC may take an equity stake, Alaskan Governor Bill Walker said on a call with reporters. AGDC will remain a majority shareholder, he said."
Sinopec Group,2017-11,"Alaska created AGDC in 2010 to build the project to tap the North Slope gas reserves, where production is expected to average about 3.5 billion cubic feet per day, according to Alaska LNG's website."
Sinopec Group,2017-11,"Alaska aims to shore up its oil and gas sector, which has struggled to compete with lower-cost shale projects in states such as Texas. Securing a Chinese customer, lender and investor would help Alaska overcome a multi-billion dollar budget deficit and create jobs. [nL1N1J4019]"
Sinopec Group,2017-11,"""It's been a long courtship with these folks,"" said AGDC President Keith Meyer on the call. ""We're now engaged."""
Sinopec Group,2017-11,The LNG will meet China's growing appetite for cleaner-burning fuels as the government tries to wean the country off coal to reduce air pollution. The Trump administration has touted natural gas exports from the United States as a way to reduce its trade deficits and boost domestic employment. [nL3N1NF2VM]
Sinopec Group,2017-11,"A final investment decision (FID) for Alaska LNG is expected in the first quarter of 2019, with construction starting in the same year and the first cargo expected around 2024 to 2025."
Sinopec Group,2017-11,"Most of the gas from Alaska LNG is expected to go to China, with Sinopec also helping with the marketing, although AGDC is also speaking to Japan, South Korea and Vietnam about potential off take, Meyer said."
Sinopec Group,2017-11,"Another energy-rich state, West Virginia, signed a memorandum of understanding with China Energy Investment Corp, the world's largest power company by asset value. [nL3N1NF375]"

Sinopec Group,2017-11,"LONDON, Nov 2 (Reuters) - A quarter of the world's oil refineries risk closure by 2035 if governments meet targets to limit fossil fuel burning in the fight against global warming, a report released on Thursday said."
Sinopec Group,2017-11,"A surge in electric vehicle sales and higher efficiency in internal combustion and jet engines are expected to slow demand growth for fuels such as gasoline, diesel and aviation fuel in the coming decades, potentially putting pressure on refining profits."
Sinopec Group,2017-11,"At the same time, governments around the world are set to introduce legislation in the coming years to limit emissions of heat-capturing carbon dioxide into the atmosphere in order to meet targets set at a U.N-backed Paris conference in 2015."
Sinopec Group,2017-11,"As a result, companies such as Chevron , Royal Dutch Shell , France' Total and China's largest refiner Sinopec could see profits from refining drop by 70 percent or more over the period, according to the report co-authored by environment thinktank Carbon Tracker, Swedish investment fund AP7 and Danish pension fund PKA."
Sinopec Group,2017-11,The study is based on the International Energy Agency's 450 Scenario to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius under which oil demand declines by 23 percent between 2020 and 2035.
Sinopec Group,2017-11,"Under this scenario, despite new refinery additions in Asia and the Middle East, only 62 percent of global capacity will be required to meet demand compared with around 80 percent today. Profits from converting crude oil into refined products will also shrink."
Sinopec Group,2017-11,"That in turn means that approximately one quarter of the 2016 refining capacity, the equivalent of some 24.7 million barrels per day of oil demand, will need to be closed, the report said."
Sinopec Group,2017-11,"The closures would likely be more pronounced in developed economies where oil demand is expected to peak earlier than in developing economies. Also, modern, complex refineries that can produce more high quality and cleaner fuels are likely to fare better than older plants."
Sinopec Group,2017-11,"""The consequences of achieving a 2 degree Celsius world are far more detrimental to the refining sector than the upstream sector, as it results in structural over-capacity and associated poor refining margin environment, which can only be addressed by sustained capacity rationalisation,"" said Alan Gelder, vice president for research at Edinburgh-based consultancy Wood Mackenzie which took part in the report."
Sinopec Group,2017-11,Meeting the emission reduction targets however seems distant today. A report published on Tuesday said global emissions are set to be 30 percent higher than the target needed by 2030.[nL8N1N640X]
Sinopec Group,2017-11,"While oil companies including Shell have acknowledged that demand for some fuels such as gasoline could peak by the end of the 2020s, they expect demand for oil to remain strong for decades from heavy transport, aviation and chemical production."
Sinopec Group,2017-11,"The authors of the report estimate that overall earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) for refiners could fall by over 50 percent by 2035 from around $147 billion in 2015."

(Refiles to fix punctuation in third, fifth and sixth paragraphs, and to fix mispelling of ""Cheniere Energy"" in third paragraph.)"
Sinopec Group,2017-11,"WASHINGTON, Nov 1 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Finance services firms look sidelined as the White House focuses on finding easy China wins. Energy and industrial companies like General Electric will have a chance to cozy up to Beijing's new leadership during U.S. President Donald Trump's upcoming Asia trip, but Wall Street isn't coming along. The U.S. business delegation's composition reflects Trump's desires to find low-hanging fruit deals to tout domestically, but low expectations for deeper concessions."
Sinopec Group,2017-11,"U.S. corporate delegates include GE, Honeywell , Thermo Fisher and Cheniere Energy . They arrive at an opportune time to meet Chinese leaders, who just wrapped up a major party congress and rolled out new leadership slate at the end of October."
Sinopec Group,2017-11,"However, the United States remains locked in contentious talks over improving market access for American firms in the People's Republic, including financial services. A senior administration official said Tuesday that progress has become more difficult. China is retrenching under President Xi Jinping, who has shown scant respect for market-based principles."
Sinopec Group,2017-11,"While there have been some advances on raising ownership equity caps in financial services, a deal has not been finalized, and the lack of representation by big names like Citi or Goldman Sachs on this trip suggests no major compromise is nigh. William Zarit, chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, said he hoped the one-off deals don't overshadow the need to push for structural changes."
Sinopec Group,2017-11,"Convincing Beijing to expose its domestic financial industry to more foreign competition is a tougher pitch than selling goods. The Trump administration is not indifferent to the financial sector's concerns, but low expectations for photo-op concessions have kept the industry at the back of the line this time around."
Sinopec Group,2017-11,"- U.S. President Donald Trump will begin his 12-day Asia trip on Nov. 3, with scheduled stops in Japan, South Korea, China, Vietnam, and the Philippines. North Korea and economic relations are expected to be the main topics of discussion during the visit."
Sinopec Group,2017-11,"- Among the companies listed as participating in the delegation to China are General Electric, Honeywell, Thermo Fisher and Cherniere Energy. The Trump administration also hopes to announce a 700-mile pipeline deal with China Petroleum & Chemical Corp., known as Sinopec, in Texas and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The firm is expected to partner with Massachusetts-based ArcLight Capital and Connecticut-based Freepoint Commodities."
