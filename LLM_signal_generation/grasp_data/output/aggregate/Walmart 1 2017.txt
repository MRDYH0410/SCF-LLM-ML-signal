walmart,2017-1,"CHICAGO, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc will offer U.S. shoppers free two-day shipping on a minimum order of $35 starting Tuesday, its latest attempt to compete with rival Amazon.com Inc's popular Prime shipping program."
walmart,2017-1,"Free shipping will replace 'Shipping Pass', Wal-Mart's existing two-day shipping program that charges shoppers an annual membership fee of $49. Amazon Prime charges customers $99 a year for two-day shipping that comes with additional features like a streaming video service."
walmart,2017-1,"Marc Lore, head of Wal-Mart's e-commerce operations, said the company's offer will be ""most compelling"" for shoppers looking for low prices, a wide assortment and fast shipping."
walmart,2017-1,"""In today's world of e-commerce, two-day free shipping is table stakes. It no longer makes sense to charge for it,"" Lore said on a conference call. He is the former head of online retailer Jet.com, which Wal-Mart bought for $3.3 billion last year."
walmart,2017-1,"The decision to scrap the membership fee is Lore's boldest move yet to challenge Amazon since he took charge of Wal-Mart's struggling online business. Earlier this month, Lore shuffled Wal-Mart's e-commerce decks. [nL4N1F356F]"
walmart,2017-1,"The move is in line with the broader push by Wal-Mart Chief Executive Doug McMillon to narrow the gap with Amazon and give it an even more dominant position in U.S. e-commerce. The retailer has been investing in e-commerce for the past 15 years, but it still lags far behind its Seattle-based rival."
walmart,2017-1,"Wal-Mart's free shipping offer will be available on over 2 million items. It will include frequently ordered items such as household essentials, baby products, cleaning supplies and food items like cereal and peanut butter."
walmart,2017-1,"Wal-Mart said it will use its new online warehouses around the country to fulfill such orders and expects to ship many such items in just one day. In October, the retailer said it is on track to double the number of giant warehouses dedicated to online sales to 10 by the end of 2016. [nL2N1CC03O]"
walmart,2017-1,Wal-Mart will also fully refund the membership fee for existing Shipping Pass members. The company started experimenting with Shipping Pass in 2015 and was trying to boost demand for the program by offering a free 30-day trial in 2016.
walmart,2017-1,"In a separate blog post, Lore said the retailer remains committed to saving consumers money. ""I've been here for four months and I couldn't be more excited about how fast we are moving. It feels like a startup."""

walmart,2017-1,"SAN FRANCISCO, Jan 27 (Reuters) - Shares of U.S. supermarket operators fell on Friday as President Donald Trump kept up his criticism of Mexico, which is a major supplier of produce and other foods for U.S. consumers."
walmart,2017-1,"A day after the White House suggested that the United States could impose a 20 percent tax on goods from Mexico, shares of Wal-Mart Stores and Kroger Co fell more than 1 percent, while Whole Foods Market dropped 2.8 percent."
walmart,2017-1,"Trump on Friday repeated statements that Mexico, a major exporter of vegetables, fruits and beer, has taken advantage of the United States. Mexico, he said, ""beat us to a pulp,"" deepening worries about a crisis between the two trading partners."

walmart,2017-1,"The index is up about 1.5 percent for the month, on track for its third straight monthly advance and best three-month run since early 2013."
walmart,2017-1,Below is a list of facts about the index on its climb to the historic level:
walmart,2017-1,"** The average was created by Charles Dow and launched in 1896. It was designed to cover all industries, with the exception of transportation and utilities."
walmart,2017-1,"** At its inception, the Dow consisted of only 12 ""smokestack"" companies - suppliers of consumer goods and basic materials such as American Sugar and National Lead. It expanded to 20 components on Oct. 4, 1916. Since Oct. 1, 1928, it has comprised 30 U.S. ""blue-chip"" companies."
walmart,2017-1,"** General Electric Co is the only current component that was one of the original 12 in the index. The industrial conglomerate was removed twice, in 1898 and 1901, but returned to the index each time in subsequent changes."
walmart,2017-1,"** Apple Inc was the most recent addition to the index, replacing AT&T Inc on March 19, 2015."
walmart,2017-1,"** The most expensive stock currently in the price-weighted index is Goldman Sachs Group Inc , which recently traded at $235.21. GE, at $30.30, is the cheapest."
walmart,2017-1,"** Apple is the largest company in the index, with a market capitalization of more than $638 billion. Travelers Cos Inc is the smallest, at about $33 billion."
walmart,2017-1,"** The biggest daily point gain for the index was Oct. 13, 2008 -less than a month after Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy protection - when the Dow rose 936.42 points. The biggest one-day percentage gain was 15.34 percent on March 15, 1933, in the midst of the Great Depression."
walmart,2017-1,"** The biggest point decline for the index was a drop of 777.68 on Sept. 29, 2008. On a percentage basis, the worst day for the Dow was Oct. 19, 1987, also known as ""Black Monday,"" when it fell 22.61 percent."
walmart,2017-1,"** The average daily return for the index through March 31, 2016, was a gain of 0.02537 percent, with an average up day of 0.71 percent and an average down day of 0.74 percent."
walmart,2017-1,"** July is the best-performing month for the Dow, with an average gain of 1.3192 percent as of March 31, 2016. September is the worst-performing month, with an average decline of 1.0586 percent."
walmart,2017-1,"** Saturday is the best-performing day of the week for the index, with an average gain of 0.0683 percent. From 1887 to 1952, shares on the New York Stock Exchange were traded from 10 a.m. until noon. Monday is the worst day of the week for the Dow, with an average decline of 0.0862 percent."
walmart,2017-1,"** The best-performing calendar year has been 1915, with a gain of 81.66 percent, while the worst-performing year was 1931, with a 52.67 percent decline. There have been 78 up years and 43 down years."
walmart,2017-1,"** It has taken only 42 market sessions for the index to climb the next 1,000 points from the first close above 19,000, the second-fastest rise between 1,000-point milestones in the Dow's 120-year history. The quickest pace was the 24 trading days between 10,000 and 11,000 in 1999. The longest stretch between such milestones was the 3,630 days needed for the index to close above the 2,000 barrier on Jan. 8, 1987."
walmart,2017-1,"** Since the index closed above the 19,000 mark, Goldman Sachs has contributed the most points to the index, with roughly 167. Wal-Mart Stores Inc has been the biggest drag, subtracting about 19 points."

walmart,2017-1,"CHICAGO, Jan 20 (Reuters) - U.S. department store chains, hit by slowing sales for more than two years, have used layoffs, store closings and cutbacks to maintain one aspect of stability: profit margins."
walmart,2017-1,"An analysis of two important indicators of retail profitability, gross margins and operating margins, shows retailers like Kohl's Corp , JC Penney Co Inc , Macy's Inc and Target Corp have done a better job at delivering on profitability than maintaining sales growth."

walmart,2017-1,"""Margins have been relatively better compared to sales and they are finally taking important steps like closing unprofitable stores,"" said Charles Sizemore, founder of Sizemore Capital Management LLC, who owns shares of Wal-Mart Stores Inc and other retailers. ""The story right now is bad but we do expect some of these problems to bottom out over time."""
walmart,2017-1,"Gross margins at all four chains have remained steady over the past four years, helped by cost cutting initiatives like store closures. Operating margins have shown recent improvement at some chains like Kohl's and Target, steadily improved for JC Penney, but contracted for others like Macy's."

walmart,2017-1,"WASHINGTON, Jan 17 (Reuters) - General Motors Co on Tuesday confirmed it will invest an additional $1 billion in its U.S. factories in 2017 and will move some parts production from Mexico to the United States that was previously handled by a supplier."
walmart,2017-1,GM and other automakers have been sharply criticized by Republican U.S. President-elect Donald Trump for building vehicles in Mexico that are imported into the United States. Trump will be sworn in on Friday.
walmart,2017-1,"GM said the $1 billion investment will create or retain 1,500 jobs. The Detroit automaker said details of individual projects will be announced throughout the year."
walmart,2017-1,"""Thank you to General Motors and Walmart for starting the big jobs push back into the U.S.,"" Trump tweeted, referring as well to Wal-Mart Stores Inc's announcement that it will hire 10,000 U.S. workers in 2017 as part of a plan previously announced by the discount retailer. [nL4N1F73X6]"
walmart,2017-1,"GM also said it will begin work on bringing axle production for its next generation of full-size pickup trucks, including work previously done in Mexico, to operations in Michigan, creating 450 U.S. jobs."
walmart,2017-1,The part was previously built by American Axle & Manufacturing Holdings Inc . American Axle did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
walmart,2017-1,"GM spokeswoman Joanne Krell said the automaker planned to add 7,000 new U.S. jobs over the next two to three years. Krell said the decisions being announced ""had been in the works for some time"" but she added ""the timing was good for us to share what we are doing."""
walmart,2017-1,"The 7,000 figure includes the 450 jobs on axle production, 1,500 jobs tied to the $1 billion announcement and more than 5,000 new jobs tied to engineering, GM Financial and advanced technology."
walmart,2017-1,GM in 2014 announced it was investing $5 billion in Mexico and doubling production capacity by 2018. GM said last week it had no plans to cancel Mexican investments despite Trump pressure.
walmart,2017-1,"GM said it had added about 6,000 U.S. jobs, consisting of 4,000 hourly and 2,000 salaried positions, since the end of 2015 for a total American workforce of 103,000."
walmart,2017-1,"Since GM's bankruptcy restructuring in 2009, when it had 77,000 U.S. employees, it has added more than 25,000 jobs as it boosted production, acquired an auto finance company and brought information technology work in house."
walmart,2017-1,"The United Auto Workers union said GM's new investments ""have emerged as a result of the 2015"" contract with the union."
walmart,2017-1,"GM shares slightly rose in midday trading, up 0.6 percent, or $0.23 per share, to $37.57."
walmart,2017-1,"Trump, who made bringing back manufacturing to the United States a large part of his successful election campaign, has been touting recent automaker investments in the United States. ""With all of the jobs I am bringing back into the U.S. (even before taking office), with all of the new auto plants coming back into our country and with the massive cost reductions I have negotiated on military purchases and more, I believe the people are seeing ""big stuff,"" Trump said in a pair of tweets."
walmart,2017-1,"Trump has been inaccurate in describing some U.S. auto investments, wrongly saying last week that Fiat Chrysler was planning to build a new factory in the United States. The company announced it is investing $1 billion in two existing plants, adding 2,000 jobs."
walmart,2017-1,"On Jan. 3, Trump threatened to impose a ""big border tax"" on GM for making some of its Chevrolet Cruze compacts in Mexico - and he has extended that threat to German automakers like BMW AG and Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T> over building vehicles abroad. Separately, Hyundai Motor Group said Tuesday in South Korea that it plans to boost U.S. investment by 50 percent to $3.1 billion over five years and may build a new plant in the United States."
walmart,2017-1,"Hyundai Motor Co <005380.KS> and Kia Motors Corp <000270.KS>, which make up the Hyundai Motor Group, have not been directly criticized by Trump but they may have felt vulnerable because among major brands, they have one of the lowest ratios of cars built in the United States to cars sold."
walmart,2017-1,"GM also said an unnamed supplier has committed to make components for GM's next-generation full-size pickup trucks in Michigan, moving 100 supplier jobs from Mexico to the United States."
walmart,2017-1,"But even as GM invests in U.S. plants, it has also been making job cuts. In recent months, the company announced plans to lay off about 3,300 employees at three factories."
walmart,2017-1,"It said in November it would cut about 2,000 jobs when it ends the third shift at its Lordstown, Ohio, and Lansing, Michigan, plants in January. Last month, it said it planned to cancel the second shift and cut nearly 1,300 jobs from its Detroit-Hamtramck assembly plant in March.[nL1N1F701D]"
walmart,2017-1,"GM's ""general plan is to build where we sell, and we're focused on what we're doing in the United States,"" Chief Executive Mary Barra said in an interview with Reuters on Monday."
walmart,2017-1,"Barra, who said she planned to attend Trump's inauguration, said GM wants to work with him, adding, ""I do believe we have more in common than we have areas that we aren't aligned."""

walmart,2017-1,"""Thank you to General Motors and Walmart for starting the big jobs push back into the U.S.!"" Trump said in a tweet on Tuesday reacting to the moves."

walmart,2017-1,"Announcements by Wal-Mart and GM come as both companies are cutting jobs in the country, and their hiring, which was planned for some time, represent a small increase in their total U.S. workforce."

walmart,2017-1,"Some of America's largest companies including General Motors, Lockheed Martin Corp and United Technologies Corp have been publicly rebuked by Trump on Twitter. Many others are worried they may be his next target - especially if they have significant overseas manufacturing, have cut U.S. jobs or raised prices for consumers."
walmart,2017-1,Trump's criticism of Ford Motor Co on Twitter turned to praise after the carmaker scrapped a planned Mexican car factory and added 700 jobs in Michigan earlier this month. [nL1N1ET0V9]

walmart,2017-1,Both Wal-Mart and GM's new U.S. job plans are also part of previously announced investment plans.

walmart,2017-1,"GM's announcements also reflected existing plans, not new decisions, company officials and the United Auto Workers union said on Tuesday. The UAW in a statement said the announcement ""continues GM investments that have emerged as a result of the 2015 national bargaining agreement"" between the union and the automaker."
walmart,2017-1,"Wal-Mart has been letting thousands of U.S. employees go so it can focus more on e-commerce and putting more staff on the sales floor. GM has also announced plans to lay off about 3,300 employees at three factories in recent months."

walmart,2017-1,"NEW YORK, Jan 17 (Reuters Breakingviews) - General Motors is rolling off the factory floor a buzzword custom-designed for Donald Trump. The automaker was recently harangued by the president-elect for building cars in Mexico. Now it's bragging about ""insourcing"" 6,500 jobs to America. Chief Executive Mary Barra isn't the first to use the term, but she is ahead of the curve as more companies try to curry favor with the next commander-in-chief."
walmart,2017-1,"Companies touting how they're investing in their U.S. businesses has quickly become commonplace. Wal-Mart , for example, said on Tuesday that 10,000 jobs will come from an investment plan announced last October."
walmart,2017-1,"GM is taking it one step further. Its announcement on Tuesday contained a flurry of breathless jargon extolling how the $57 billion car producer is investing money and creating new employment opportunities in the United States. It is, for example, ""insourcing"" to Michigan 450 posts that are currently south of the border."
walmart,2017-1,"Keeping tally of the number of jobs, however, is a brain twister that makes GM's safe-harbor statement an easier read by comparison. GM trumpets 7,000 new positions in total, but only a fraction from ""insourcing."" Of the rest, 1,500 are tied to an extra $1 billion the company is investing in its U.S. manufacturing operations, with 5,000 new gigs tied to various other divisions including engineering and its car-loans unit."
walmart,2017-1,"Barra also, though, stares knowingly into the rearview mirror, asserting that GM has already been ""insourcing,"" having brought back 6,000 IT jobs once filled by workers outside the United States."
walmart,2017-1,"- General Motors said on Jan. 17 that it will be ""insourcing"" some 450 jobs from Mexico to Michigan to work on axle production for its next generation of full-size pickup trucks. Chief Executive Mary Barra also said the company had already relocated more than 6,000 IT jobs back to the United States."
walmart,2017-1,"- In addition, GM is investing $1 billion in U.S. manufacturing operations that should create or secure 1,500 U.S. jobs. The company expects to add another 5,000 jobs over the next two to three years."

walmart,2017-1,"MUMBAI/BENGALURU, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Even before he was appointed to run India's biggest e-commerce company, Kalyan Krishnamurthy had signalled a change: as head of sales at Flipkart he focused on profitable ""big ticket"" items, a shift away from the industry's fixation on growth at all costs."
walmart,2017-1,"That helped turn around the group's revenues after a series of valuation writedowns, and secured the top job for the veteran of Flipkart's largest investor, Tiger Global, in a management shakeup this week."

walmart,2017-1,"""The trigger (for the reshuffle)... was repeated mark-downs in its valuation by the fund units of Morgan Stanley and Fidelity,"" said one source familiar with investor discussions."
walmart,2017-1,"The person said investors, led by Tiger, were getting increasingly edgy as the writedowns not only stung early investors who bought in at higher valuations, but made it harder for Flipkart to tap the market and raise fresh capital."
walmart,2017-1,"The company is preparing for an initial public offering, probably in 2018 or 2019."
walmart,2017-1,Flipkart and Tiger Global both declined to comment on the reshuffle and its implications.
walmart,2017-1,Flipkart has seen its lead in the online market in India eaten into by global giant Amazon .
walmart,2017-1,"But some company sources credited Krishnamurthy, who joined Flipkart in June to spearhead some of its core sales efforts, with outmanoeuvering Amazon during the festive sales push from October onwards."
walmart,2017-1,"No official data for the period are available, but several analysts and company sources said Flipkart clocked higher gross merchandise value (GMV)."
walmart,2017-1,A source close to the company said Flipkart's GMV for the peak month of October was more than 50 billion rupees ($735 million).
walmart,2017-1,"Company sources said Krishnamurthy achieved this by offering discounts and other incentives on more expensive items like televisions, handsets and home appliances, helping it achieve better margins than rivals who paid more attention to volume."
walmart,2017-1,"""He focused the discounts on high demand categories like mobile (phones), TV and large items - washing machines, air conditioners,"" said one employee."
walmart,2017-1,Whether Flipkart can outsmart Amazon over the longer term remains to be seen.
walmart,2017-1,"Deep pockets are key to winning market share through aggressive discounting, and the American giant has announced a $5 billion investment plan in India."
walmart,2017-1,"Bank of America Merrill Lynch, in a September 2016 report, said it expected Flipkart's GMV market share to remain largely unchanged at 44 percent by 2019. By comparison, the brokerage expected Amazon's share to grow to 37 percent from 28 percent estimated for 2016."
walmart,2017-1,"A senior Flipkart executive, who like other company sources declined to be named because he was not authorised to speak to the press, said this week's management restructuring was on the cards from the day Krishnamurthy joined Flipkart."
walmart,2017-1,"The source close to Flipkart added that Tiger Global, the U.S. hedge fund that owns about a third of the company, wanted to be more closely involved in Flipkart's operations."
walmart,2017-1,"Launched by two former Amazon employees in 2007, Flipkart has grown to become India's most valuable startup worth $15 billion in 2015."
walmart,2017-1,"But its valuation has since dropped to below $10 billion by late 2016 amid intensifying competition, and it needs fresh funds to stay ahead of Amazon in the battle for supremacy in the world's fastest growing internet services market."
walmart,2017-1,"Talks were held with U.S. retailer Wal-Mart Stores Inc , which is looking to invest between $750 million and $1 billion in Flipkart, Reuters reported in October. [nL3N1C51V8]"
walmart,2017-1,"Binny Bansal told Reuters in October that the company had cash reserves to last up to three years, but the source close to the firm said Flipkart had about two years before its war chest dried up. [nL1N1DJ0FH]"
walmart,2017-1,"The company raised a little over $1 billion in the last two years, but needs to raise more funds in the next six to eight months, according to the same source."
walmart,2017-1,"""Tiger, along with other investors, want to steady the ship and make it IPO-ready as soon as they can,"" said the source familiar with investor discussions."
walmart,2017-1,"Binny Bansal also mentioned ""IPO readiness"" as one of his key objectives as group CEO in an internal memo announcing the reshuffle."
walmart,2017-1,"Flipkart's restructuring takes away control of daily operations from Binny Bansal, who replaced Sachin Bansal a year ago as CEO."
walmart,2017-1,"As group CEO, Binny will oversee the allocation of capital across units while Sachin will be responsible for strategic direction of existing business, Flipkart said in a statement."

walmart,2017-1,"""He focused the discounts on high demand categories like mobile (phones), TV and large items - washing machines, air conditioners,"" said one employee."
walmart,2017-1,Whether Flipkart can outsmart Amazon over the longer term remains to be seen.
walmart,2017-1,"Deep pockets are key to winning market share through aggressive discounting, and the American giant has announced a $5 billion investment plan in India."
walmart,2017-1,"Bank of America Merrill Lynch, in a September 2016 report, said it expected Flipkart's GMV market share to remain largely unchanged at 44 percent by 2019. By comparison, the brokerage expected Amazon's share to grow to 37 percent from 28 percent estimated for 2016."
walmart,2017-1,"A senior Flipkart executive, who like other company sources declined to be named because he was not authorised to speak to the press, said this week's management restructuring was on the cards from the day Krishnamurthy joined Flipkart."
walmart,2017-1,"The source close to Flipkart added that Tiger Global, the U.S. hedge fund that owns about a third of the company, wanted to be more closely involved in Flipkart's operations."
walmart,2017-1,"Launched by two former Amazon employees in 2007, Flipkart has grown to become India's most valuable startup worth $15 billion in 2015."
walmart,2017-1,"But its valuation has since dropped to below $10 billion by late 2016 amid intensifying competition, and it needs fresh funds to stay ahead of Amazon in the battle for supremacy in the world's fastest growing internet services market."
walmart,2017-1,"Talks were held with U.S. retailer Wal-Mart Stores Inc , which is looking to invest between $750 million and $1 billion in Flipkart, Reuters reported in October. [nL3N1C51V8]"
walmart,2017-1,"Binny Bansal told Reuters in October that the company had cash reserves to last up to three years, but the source close to the firm said Flipkart had about two years before its war chest dried up. [nL1N1DJ0FH]"
walmart,2017-1,"The company raised a little over $1 billion in the last two years, but needs to raise more funds in the next six to eight months, according to the same source."
walmart,2017-1,"""Tiger, along with other investors, want to steady the ship and make it IPO-ready as soon as they can,"" said the source familiar with investor discussions."
walmart,2017-1,"Binny Bansal also mentioned ""IPO readiness"" as one of his key objectives as group CEO in an internal memo announcing the reshuffle."
walmart,2017-1,"Flipkart's restructuring takes away control of daily operations from Binny Bansal, who replaced Sachin Bansal a year ago as CEO."
walmart,2017-1,"As group CEO, Binny will oversee the allocation of capital across units while Sachin will be responsible for strategic direction of existing business, Flipkart said in a statement."
walmart,2017-1,"""Investors are happy with the way the founders have stepped aside and given the control to professionals, as it's very rare in India,"" one of the sources said."
walmart,2017-1,"A day after Krishnamurthy took charge, three senior executives including the head of Flipkart's logistics unit and its chief marketing officer quit the company, according to local media. A company spokesman declined to comment."
