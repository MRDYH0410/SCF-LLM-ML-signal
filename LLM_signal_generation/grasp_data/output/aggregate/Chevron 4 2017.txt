Chevron,2017-4,{{20170428T173426.882+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-Oil majors surge into mid-cycle sweet spot(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are her own.)
Chevron,2017-4,"DALLAS, April 28 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Exxon Mobil and Chevron look to be in a mid-cycle sweet spot. The two oil majors surged to sharp first-quarter upswings on Friday thanks to higher oil prices and better margins. It's a turnaround from early 2016. Now, though, the risks go both ways. Crude prices have lost some stuffing in recent days and, given supply, could slump again. Or, if prices hold up, costs will start rising."
Chevron,2017-4,"In the first quarter last year, West Texas Intermediate crude prices dipped below $30 a barrel. Crude prices have since recovered to around $50. Largely as a result, Exxon's profit for the quarter more than doubled to $4 billion. Chevron swung to earnings of $2.7 billion after posting a loss in the first quarter of 2016."
Chevron,2017-4,"Exxon and Chevron, respectively worth around $350 billion and $200 billion in market capitalization, also sold and bought assets in the quarter. That helped position them as drilling heats up again in the United States. Both companies invested in Permian Basin production: Exxon bought $5.6 billion of assets from the Bass family and Chevron's output increased 33 percent."
Chevron,2017-4,"And if oil prices remain where they are or rise, demand for rigs and other oil services will intensify, pushing up the costs of production. Halliburton said on Monday conditions would soon allow it to hike its prices. Sand and transportation companies will charge more too. Chevron finance chief Patricia Yarrington said that the company was working to keep inflationary pressures in check, specifically in the Permian. Even when you're a global oil powerhouse, though, not everything is within your control."
Chevron,2017-4,"- Rising crude prices helped Exxon Mobil and Chevron easily beat Wall Street's profit expectations on April 28, a sign the oil industry has regained its footing after a two-year price spiral."
Chevron,2017-4,"- Exxon said that first-quarter earnings were $4 billion, more than double the $1.8 billion reported in the first quarter of last year, despite a 4 percent decline in production."
Chevron,2017-4,"- Chevron reported first-quarter earnings of $2.7 billion, compared with a loss of $725 million in the first quarter of 2016. Included in the quarter was a gain of approximately $600 million from the sale of an upstream asset."

Chevron,2017-4,"Global producers are bailing on their oil sands investments due to higher development costs, limited export pipeline capacity to get crude to market and concerns about high carbon emissions in the sector. [nL2N1GC0FG]"
Chevron,2017-4,International companies once drawn by the long-life assets that can produce for up to 50 years during the oil sector boom are discovering the economics do not work as well in a low-price environment.
Chevron,2017-4,"But to get out, they have to overcome a simple equation: there are more sellers than buyers for the oil sands."
Chevron,2017-4,"The three biggest domestic producers - Suncor Energy , Canadian Natural Resources Ltd and Cenovus Energy - are digesting multi-billion dollar deals, and have little room for more acquisitions, industry participants say. Global companies like ConocoPhillips and Marathon Oil Corp prefer to pile into cheaper U.S. shale plays such as the Permian basin instead."

Chevron,2017-4,"Statoil booked an impairment charge of $500-$550 million, when it sold its oil sands assets to Athabasca Oil Corp . Similarly, Marathon sold its stake in the Athasbasca Oil Sands Project for $2.5 billion, having paid $6.2 billion to get into the region in 2007."
Chevron,2017-4,"While some Canadian companies have stepped forward to take their place, their resources are limited."
Chevron,2017-4,Cenovus' share price tumbled after it loaded up on debt to buy ConocoPhillips assets. Suncor and Canadian Natural are in better shape financially but may have limited appetite for further deals after major acquisitions in the last 15 months.

Chevron,2017-4,"LONDON, April 21 (Reuters) - Asian spot LNG prices jumped this week, buoyed by hopes Korea Gas Corp's new tender would match past buying sprees and by emerging demand from China and Japan."
Chevron,2017-4,"Spot prices for June delivery rose to $5.70 per million British thermal units (mmBtu), a 20 cent jump over last week, but traders cited sharply divergent views on pricing, saying the disagreements contributed to market inertia."
Chevron,2017-4,"Still, Korea Gas Corp's Thursday tender for June and July supply [nL8N1HS4T5] - set to close on April 26 - immediately stirred up bullish offers, rescuing an otherwise muted trading week."
Chevron,2017-4,"The last time Kogas entered the market to buy two cargoes in December 2016, it ended up awarding up to 11."
Chevron,2017-4,"That was only one of a number of factors contributing to LNG snapping a 15-week losing streak, with Japan's Tohoku Electric seeking a May/June cargo alongside trading giant JERA's limited spot needs, Portugal's EDP seeking a June/July cargo, plus demand from Spain, India and China.[nL8N1HT3EW]"
Chevron,2017-4,But a resumption in production at two Australian LNG export plants -- Chevron's Gorgon and Woodside's North West Shelf -- left the rationale for a price rebound less clear. [nL3N1HQ34S][nL8N1HT2Z5]
Chevron,2017-4,"Demand, even in top-tier buyer Japan, is lacklustre and weather forecasts do not support a dramatic shift any time soon. Nigeria and Russia, meanwhile, have both approached the market with new supply. [nL8N1HT4DM] [nL8N1HT4H2]"
Chevron,2017-4,"""The market in Asia is basically anywhere between $5.50-$5.80, its pretty wide and nobody exactly knows ... there's a lot of inertia,"" one trading source said."
Chevron,2017-4,"So far jitters over Egypt's nascent programme of cargo deferments -- a potentially bearish signal for global markets -- have taken a back seat to more immediate developments, such as Kogas purchases, but Egypt could come to dominate thinking once the scale of its programme becomes clear."
Chevron,2017-4,"Surging production from new gas fields is squeezing out demand for costly foreign imports, leading Egypt to consider deferring as many as 25 shipments this year and many more in 2018, according to various sources."
Chevron,2017-4,Yet only a small portion of deferrals have actually been agreed with Egypt's LNG suppliers so far. Most of these are trading houses but some are state-backed energy companies.
Chevron,2017-4,"Furthermore, one trader said some sellers had hoarded supply for May in anticipation of supply disruptions that never came."
Chevron,2017-4,"""We will see how sellers react in June, given they lost value in May,"" the trader said, implying potential for supply releases."
Chevron,2017-4,"In the Atlantic, demand continued to emerge from utilities in Spain, driven by low hydroelectric reserves, faltering renewables output and nuclear issues."

Chevron,2017-4,The full bench of the Federal Court dismissed the appeal against an earlier ruling that Chevron underpaid taxes by setting up a A$2.5 billion intercompany credit facility with an abnormally high interest rate which effectively lowered its taxable income within Australia.
Chevron,2017-4,"Chevron said it was disappointed by the judgment in the case, which covers the five tax years from 2004 through 2008."
Chevron,2017-4,"""We will review the decision to determine next steps, which may include an appeal to the High Court of Australia,"" a Chevron spokesman said in an emailed statement."
Chevron,2017-4,The case is a first test of how Australia's transfer pricing rules apply to interest paid on a cross-border related-party loan. It is being closely watched by multinational companies as governments around the world clamp down on what they deem elaborate means of reducing tax obligations.

Chevron,2017-4,"BP's 50 percent stake in the Sunrise project near Fort McMurray in Alberta, where Husky Energy Inc owns the rest and is the operator, is the most valuable of the three assets. BP'S Sunrise stake is valued at about $810 million, based on recent transactions in the sector."

Chevron,2017-4,The Houston company projects its daily production of crude and natural gas will fall 26 percent after the latest sales to about 1.16 million barrels of oil equivalent (boe). Barclays expects overall it won't return to production growth on a full-year basis until 2019.
Chevron,2017-4,"""They've sold a very valuable asset,"" said Marc Heilweil, senior portfolio manager at Atlanta-based investment firm Gratus Capital, referring to the oil-sands holdings."
Chevron,2017-4,"The deal will ""make it harder for them to fully replace reserves down the line"" because shale-oil properties have shorter productive lives, he said."
Chevron,2017-4,"To ensure growth, oil producers must continually add reserves to offset production and the natural decline that occurs in oil-and-gas properties."
Chevron,2017-4,"In 2012, ConocoPhillips spun off its refining business, leaving the ranks of the large, integrated companies like Exxon Mobil Corp and Chevron Corp , and putting it among a group of mostly-small U.S. independent exploration and production companies."

He pledged to boost output by 3 percent to 5 percent annually by tapping its large pool of deep-water, oil-sands and conventional oil-and-gas properties. That goal ended two years later as prices collapsed, forcing it to borrow heavily to cover its spending on production. ConocoPhillips later cut its dividend."
Chevron,2017-4,"Its lack of exposure to refining has helped its shares stand out recently. The company's stock is down 4.3 percent year to date, even after an about 9 percent jump following the March 29 disclosure of a $3 billion addition to its share buy backs.

Chevron,2017-4,"He insists the remaining assets can generate substantial cash from operations even if oil falls below $40 a barrel. ConocoPhillips is ramping up output from its Eagle Ford and Bakken shale wells, from another oil-sands property and liquefied natural gas (LNG) from operations in Australia."
Chevron,2017-4,"Meanwhile, rivals have cranked up their production much faster. U.S. shale-focused companies project 15 percent volume growth this year, says consultancy Wood Mackenzie, and the larger oil producers such as Chevron are raising output and delivering fatter dividends."
Chevron,2017-4,"ConocoPhillips will be producing an average 1.25 million boe a day in 2019, estimates Barclays. In contrast, Chevron projects its daily output this year will rise between 103,000 boe and 233,000 boe over 2016's average 2.59 million boe, excluding divestitures. Chevron pays a 4 percent dividend."
Chevron,2017-4,"The risk for ConocoPhillips investors is the growth in production doesn't generate higher free cash flow for share buy backs, and the 2 percent dividend yield, about half that of Chevron, becomes the bigger part of returns."

Chevron,2017-4,"{{20170418T110008.395+0000}}Amid business ties, some fund firms eased proxy pressure -studyBy Ross Kerber"
Chevron,2017-4,"NEW YORK, April 18 (Reuters) - Several big fund firms supported challenges on executive pay or climate disclosures less frequently where they had business ties to energy companies and utilities, according to a new study released on Tuesday."
Chevron,2017-4,The scrutiny of firms including Vanguard Group and Invesco Ltd is the latest research to raise questions about how well they manage potential conflicts of interest when casting proxy votes at the same time they are trying to win work like running corporate retirement plans.
Chevron,2017-4,"""The business relationships seem to have an impact on how the managers are voting,"" said Edward Kamonjoh, executive director of the 50/50 Climate Project. The Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit, which issued the report, looks to help investors and corporations work on issues like climate change."
Chevron,2017-4,"Fund firms often are the largest shareholders of publicly traded U.S. firms, giving their votes outsized influence. Meanwhile climate and other governance matters promise to be hot topics in the shareholder meeting season this spring after Vanguard, BlackRock Inc and others have revised their policies on the area. [nL2N1GN1ML]"
Chevron,2017-4,"For its study 50/50 reviewed how fund firms voted on 27 proxy questions last year at oil and gas companies and utilities, tracking how often they voted against management recommendations."
Chevron,2017-4,"At Vanguard, for instance, 50/50 found the $4 trillion Pennsylvania index fund manager broke from management 22 percent of the time. But at four companies where Vanguard serviced retirement plans, its funds did not support any challenges."
Chevron,2017-4,"The votes could have mattered such as at Chevron Corp where 46 percent of votes cast opposed top executives' pay and Vanguard owned 6 percent of shares. Vanguard funds also opposed a resolution calling for Chevron to disclose the business impact of a rise in global temperatures, which won 41 percent support."
Chevron,2017-4,"Vanguard spokeswoman Arianna Stefanoni Sherlock called the concerns raised by the study ""unfounded"" and said its voting operations are independent of its servicing work."
Chevron,2017-4,"Vanguard changed its voting policies this year to leave itself more room to support environmental measures that create long-term shareholder value. Sherlock said the update was meant to showed the types of proposals it might support, and to eliminate abstentions."
Chevron,2017-4,"Another fund firm, Invesco, broke with management 12 percent of the time, and at none of seven companies where it had business ties."
Chevron,2017-4,Invesco spokeswoman Jeaneen Terrio said where a conflict of interest may exist it will vote by policy or by a committee that excludes marketing and other customer-facing personnel.

Chevron,2017-4,"HOUSTON, April 17 (Reuters) - Investors who took a hit last year when dozens of U.S. shale producers filed for bankruptcy are already making big new bets on the industry's resurgence."
Chevron,2017-4,"In the first quarter, private equity funds raised $19.8 billion for energy ventures - nearly three times the total in the same period last year, according to financial data provider Preqin."
Chevron,2017-4,"The quickening pace of investments from private equity, along with hedge funds and investment banks, comes even as the recovery in oil prices from an 8-year low has stalled at just over $50 per barrel amid a stubborn global supply glut."
Chevron,2017-4,"The shale sector has become increasingly attractive to investors not because of rising oil prices, but rather because producers have achieved startling cost reductions - slashing up to half the cost of pumping a barrel in the past two years. Investors also believe the glut will dissipate as demand for oil steadily rises."
Chevron,2017-4,That gives financiers confidence that they can squeeze increasing returns from shale fields - without price gains - as technology continues to cut costs. So they are backing shale-oil veterans and assembling companies that can quickly start pumping.
Chevron,2017-4,"""Shale funders look at the economics today and see a lot of projects that work in the $40 to $55 range"" per barrel of oil, said Howard Newman, head of private equity fund Pine Brook Road Partners, which last month committed to invest $300 million in startup Admiral Permian Resources LLC to drill in West Texas."
Chevron,2017-4,"Data on investments by hedge funds and other nonpublic investment firms is scant, but the rush of new private equity money indicates broader enthusiasm in shale plays."
Chevron,2017-4,"""Demand for oil has been more robust than anyone imagined three years ago,"" said Mark Papa, chief executive of Centennial Resource Development Inc ."
Chevron,2017-4,"Papa referred to the beginning of an international oil price crash in 2014, which took many firms in the shale sector to the brink of bankruptcy."
Chevron,2017-4,"Centennial is a Permian oil producer backed by private equity fund Riverstone. Papa, a well-known shale industry entrepreneur, built EOG Resources Inc into one of the most profitable U.S. shale producers before he retired in 2013."
Chevron,2017-4,"The chance to further develop the Permian, he said, was enough for him to come out of retirement to deliver one of its bigger recent successes. The value of Riverstone's original $500 million investment has grown nearly four times since Centennial's initial public offering last fall."
Chevron,2017-4,"Riverstone this year copied the Centennial model, putting experienced managers atop a startup charged with acquiring operations or assets. The equity fund hired Jim Hackett - the former head of shale producer Anadarko Petroleum Corp - to run the newly created Silver Run Acquisition Corp II ."

Chevron,2017-4,"Private equity fund NGP Natural Resources XI LP invested $524 million last fall in Luxe Energy LLC, a shale producer formed in 2015 by former Statoil executives."
Chevron,2017-4,NGP's investment was effectively a bet that Luxe could repeat its success of early 2016.

Chevron,2017-4,"""There is a ton of private capital to invest in the U.S. oil industry,"" said Gerrit Nicholas, co-founder of private equity fund Orion Energy Partners."
Chevron,2017-4,Nicholas said he is comfortable lending even if oil prices fall to $40 per barrel.
Chevron,2017-4,"Orion this month helped finance the expansion of a Florida oil-storage terminal, a move predicated in part on growth in U.S. oil exports. Since the U.S. lifted its oil export ban last year, crude exports have climbed to about 746,000 barrels per day, according to U.S. Energy Information Administration data."
Chevron,2017-4,"The oil industry has seen boom-and-bust cycles since the first well was drilled about 160 years ago, and industry and government have sought to tame the volatility for just as long."

Chevron,2017-4,"TORONTO/NEW YORK, April 13 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp , the second-largest U.S.-based oil producer, is exploring the sale of its 20 percent stake in Canada's Athabasca Oil Sands project, which could fetch about $2.5 billion, according to people familiar with the situation."
Chevron,2017-4,"The company has discussed with investment banks the prospect of selling the stake in the western Canadian oil sands project, a source said."
Chevron,2017-4,The possible sale comes after Royal Dutch Shell last month agreed to sell most of its Canadian oil sands assets to Canadian Natural Resources Ltd for $8.5 billion. [nL5N1GM1VZ]
Chevron,2017-4,"Chevron does not find the oil sands business appealing in the current environment, as low oil prices make it more challenging for global producers to generate profits, the people said, declining to be named as the matter is confidential."
Chevron,2017-4,"The California-based company is close to making a decision, taking into account factors such as price, the sources added."
Chevron,2017-4,"Canadian Natural is seen as a logical buyer as it will be the majority owner and operator of the Athabasca Oil Sands project once the Shell deal closes, the people said."
Chevron,2017-4,"The move comes as international players are pulling back from the Canadian energy market, particularly the capital intensive oil sands. A range of factors are contributing to investor apathy toward Canada, including weak oil prices, the higher cost of Canadian operations compared with cheap U.S. shale plays and limited export pipeline capacity out of western Canada."
Chevron,2017-4,"Asked on Thursday about Chevron's possible sale and whether her government would consider tweaking policies to be more business friendly, Alberta Premier Rachel Notley told reporters: ""What's going on frankly in the oil sands is you're seeing a reorganization, you're not seeing people pull back investment per se."""
Chevron,2017-4,"In March, ConocoPhillips , the largest independent oil producer, agreed to sell its oil sands and natural gas assets to Calgary-based Cenovus Energy for about C$17.1 billion ($12.9 billion).[nL2N1GM20K]"

Chevron,2017-4,"The disclosure, required by U.S. regulators, comes as the oil industry grapples with low prices and Chevron, the second-largest U.S.-based oil producer, tries to bounce back after posting an annual loss last year, its first since 1987."
Chevron,2017-4,"Chevron's shareholders will meet May 31 in Midland, Texas, for a nonbinding vote on the executive payouts. They will also consider resolutions related to climate change, lobbying and corporate governance."
Chevron,2017-4,"Much of the executive compensation boost was due to the rise in value of pension plans tied partly to Chevron's stock, which climbed 28 percent last year as oil prices increased 47 percent. Age and other factors can effect actuarial calculations of a pension's value."
Chevron,2017-4,"Watson, CEO since 2010, saw his compensation rise 12 percent to $24.7 million, fueled largely by the pension value increase. The value of stock and stock options awarded to Watson fell, as did the value of perquisites, including personal use of the company jet and home security. Watson's salary stayed nearly flat at $1.9 million."
Chevron,2017-4,"Mike Wirth, head of the company's midstream division who became vice chairman earlier this year, saw his compensation rise 12 percent to $9.1 million. Wirth's salary rose but the value of his stock and stock option awards fell. The value of perquisites he received rose due to air travel."
Chevron,2017-4,"Pat Yarrington, Chevron's chief financial officer, saw her compensation fall 11 percent to $6.5 million as the value of her pension fell, the only top executive to see a drop in pension value. Yarrington's salary rose but the value of her stock and stock option awards fell. The value of perquisites Yarrington received slid as she did not record any personal use of the company jet."
Chevron,2017-4,"Jay Johnson, head of the company's oil and gas exploration division, saw his compensation rise 5 percent due to an increase in salary, stock options and the value of his pension. The value of perquisites Johnson received dropped by nearly 50 percent due to the cost of a home security system in the prior year."
Chevron,2017-4,"Watson, Wirth and Johnson took their spouses on a September 2016 trip to Chevron's liquefied natural gas projects in Australia, costing $2,299, $16,014 and $2,243, respectively."

The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.)
Chevron,2017-4,"LONDON, April 6 (Reuters Breakingviews) - BP's slashed pay package for its chief executive still looks relatively kind. A 40 percent cut to Bob Dudley's total remuneration to $11.6 million in 2016 represents a reasonable way for the British energy giant to balance shareholder appeasement and retaining the American oil man's services. But the new package means he is hardly donning a hair shirt."
Chevron,2017-4,"Dudley's long-term bonus targets don't look excessively taxing, either. True, getting the whole payout means being first out of five compared to BP's main peers on a total shareholder return basis and achieving an 11 percent return on average capital employed. But to start paying out, he merely needs to be third out of five on total return, and hit a 6 percent return on average capital employed."
Chevron,2017-4,"Shareholders will know that some of BP's problems, like a 55 percent drop in the oil price over the last five years, are out of Dudley's control. They also know he has drawn a line under the compensation BP had to pay for the Gulf of Mexico disaster in 2010. But over the last five years the company has underperformed total returns of Total , Chevron and Exxon Mobil in dollar terms, with only Shell being worse. Given that, the hair shirt could have been hairier still."
Chevron,2017-4,- BP said on April 6 it had cut Chief Executive Bob Dudley's pay by 40 percent to $11.6 million in 2016.

Chevron,2017-4,"HOUSTON, April 5 (Reuters) - Nearly a century after Chevron Corp amassed the No. 2 stake in America's largest oilfield, Chief Executive John Watson is hitting the accelerator on developing the company's vast Permian Basin holdings."
Chevron,2017-4,"In an interview, Watson made clear his desire to put the West Texas to New Mexico expanse in the ranks of Chevron's biggest ventures. That is a stark change from just five years ago, when Chevron executives rarely mentioned the shale basin."
Chevron,2017-4,"But with low oil prices , the company is now spending more than it makes to cover its prized dividend and find new reserves. Now, those 2 million Permian acres have emerged as to way to help fund both goals."
Chevron,2017-4,"""Some of the best things we have in our portfolio are the shales,"" Watson said during an interview on the 48th floor of the company's Houston office tower. ""My employees in the Permian know I'm featuring it as something very important."""
Chevron,2017-4,"Gone, for the next few years at least, are plans for any new multi-billion-dollar mega-projects, he said. To survive and grow, San Ramon, California-based Chevron is turning to acreage it has always controlled and that largely is free of royalties to landowners."
Chevron,2017-4,"""We're just in a period now where markets are weak and everyone is focused on controlling costs,"" Watson said."
Chevron,2017-4,"Within a decade, Watson expects Chevron's production in the Permian to grow eightfold to more than 700,000 barrels of oil per day. By the end of next year, nine drilling rigs will join the 11 that Chevron already has poking holes into Permian land."
Chevron,2017-4,"It is all part of Watson's plan to methodically pump Chevron's more than 9 billion barrels of Permian oil, most of it owned outright by the company.

Chevron,2017-4,"HOUSTON, April 5 (Reuters) - Nearly a century after Chevron Corp amassed the No. 2 stake in America's largest oilfield, Chief Executive John Watson is hitting the accelerator on developing the company's vast Permian Basin holdings."
Chevron,2017-4,"In an interview, Watson made clear his desire to put the West Texas to New Mexico expanse in the ranks of Chevron's biggest ventures. That is a stark change from just five years ago, when Chevron executives rarely mentioned the shale basin."

Chevron,2017-4,"""Some of the best things we have in our portfolio are the shales,"" Watson said during an interview on the 48th floor of the company's Houston office tower. ""My employees in the Permian know I'm featuring it as something very important."""

Chevron,2017-4,"CHIBA, Japan, April 4 (Reuters) - The global liquefied natural gas (LNG) industry will face a supply shortfall in about five years because low prices have discouraged investment in new production, major producers said on Tuesday at a gas conference in Chiba, near Tokyo."
Chevron,2017-4,"Without the investments, suppliers may not be able to meet the needs of buyers such as Japan - the world's biggest importer of LNG - at a time when reducing emissions from other dirtier fossil fuels will be crucial to abate global warming, executives with international gas majors said."
Chevron,2017-4,"""We are facing global overcapacity that is putting pressure on prices,"" Total SA Chairman and Chief Executive Office Patrick Pouyanne told the Gastech conference."
Chevron,2017-4,LNG projects typically require billions of dollars of investment over many years of development. The industry has usually relied on long-term contracts linked to oil prices to ensure producers can get financing on favourable terms.
Chevron,2017-4,That has changed in recent years as buyers led by Japan and other Asian countries have been pushing for lower prices and better contract terms. The recent drop in oil prices has also meant some planned projects are not feasible. [nL3N1HC1DF]
Chevron,2017-4,"Chevron Corp Vice Chairman Michael Wirth said earlier at the conference a ""supply gap"" could happen over the next few years if new projects are not approved. [nL3N1HC0W0]"
Chevron,2017-4,"During supply shortfalls - such as when the Fukushima nuclear crisis of 2011 led to the shutdown of Japan's reactor fleet, and imports of LNG and coal spiked to records to replace the lost power generation - price can run up rapidly."
Chevron,2017-4,"Spot LNG prices in Asia were at more than $20 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) in 2014, but with the more recent surplus they are now trading at less than $6 per mmBtu."
Chevron,2017-4,Other executives echoed Pouyanne and Wirth on the need for investments now to avoid a shortfall emerging in the early to mid-2020s.
Chevron,2017-4,"They included Woodside Petroleum CEO Peter Coleman, who said buyers and sellers are starting to align on prices that can get projects going."
Chevron,2017-4,"""Sellers are looking for prices above $7 per mmBtu; somewhere between $7 to $8 would get most projects going, and I think also that's a sustainable level for buyers,"" Coleman told reporters at the conference."
Chevron,2017-4,One seller is willing to gamble at those levels to win the chance to fill the potential supply gap.
Chevron,2017-4,"Tellurian Inc said it will guarantee to deliver LNG to Japan for $8 per mmBtu from 2023 under five-year contracts, including shipping."
Chevron,2017-4,"""I'm going to take the volatility out of the market,"" Tellurian Chairman Charif Souki told Reuters, after announcing his offer from the stage at Gastech."
Chevron,2017-4,"Souki said deliveries would be from the company's planned Driftwood LNG terminal near St Charles in Louisiana, with the company taking care of all costs from gas field, LNG processing and delivery to Japan on an initial 7 million tonnes per annum in the ""first phase""."
Chevron,2017-4,Tellurian said on Monday it had filed an application with the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to build a terminal that would eventually have a capacity of 26 million tonnes a year. [nFWN1HB0HT]

Chevron,2017-4,The comments from Total Chairman and CEO Patrick Pouyanne suggest further slippage in a project that has in recent months been hit by subcontractor disputes. [nL3N1GS1JA]
Chevron,2017-4,"The shipment schedule, however, did not represent more delays in a project that was originally scheduled to start operating by the end of last year, Pouyanne said. [nL3N1GS1JA]"

Chevron,2017-4,"Condensate shipments will start by the end of this year, while ""LNG (cargoes) will be more in the beginning of 2018."""
Chevron,2017-4,This would appear to be a delay from a statement on Inpex's website that says production is now expected to start in the third quarter of 2017. An Inpex spokesman contacted by Reuters said the published schedule is unchanged.
Chevron,2017-4,Pouyanne said the subcontractor disputes were not holding up the start-up and that such issues are common to large projects.

Chevron,2017-4,"Most of the LNG plants being built in Australia, including Chevron's huge Gorgon facility and Royal Dutch Shell's floating Prelude production vessel, are having trouble keeping within budget and on schedule. More delays are expected."

Chevron,2017-4,"SINGAPORE, April 3 (Reuters) - The world's gas industry is descending on Tokyo this week with something other than cherry blossoms on its mind: a trio of Asian LNG buyers testing their collective muscle in a push for more flexible long-term contracts for the fuel."

[nL3N1H02FJ]"
Chevron,2017-4,Developing responses from LNG producers to the group's alliance may also soon start to give clues as to who will win advantage as the fuel surplus puts pressure on suppliers to give buyers greater contractual freedom than they have had since the industry first began to ramp up in the 1970s.

Chevron,2017-4,North Asian LNG buyers - including those agreeing last month to explore joint purchases of supplies - have for decades relied on rigid long-term contracts that prevent cargo resales because the main priority was security of supply as energy demand soared amid double-digit economic growth.
Chevron,2017-4,"But a slowdown in Asian growth over the past few years, especially in top two buyers Japan and South Korea, and impending liberalisation of gas and power markets mean dominant utilities are now often stuck with surplus cargoes they cannot resell amid stagnant or shrinking demand at home.
