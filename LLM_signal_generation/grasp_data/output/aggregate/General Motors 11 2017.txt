General Motors,2017-11,"PARIS, Nov 30 (Reuters) - Peugeot maker PSA Group plans to build Aisin Seiki <7259.T> automatic gearboxes under licence in France after failing to persuade the Toyota-owned <7203.T> supplier to invest in joint production, company sources said."
General Motors,2017-11,"Paris-based PSA has struck a licensing deal with Aisin that is likely to be announced in December, two people with knowledge of the plan told Reuters."
General Motors,2017-11,PSA spokesman Pierre-Olivier Salmon declined to comment on the status or the outcome of talks with Aisin.
General Motors,2017-11,"""We hold discussions with Aisin and all our suppliers with the aim of sourcing parts as close as possible to the end consumer,"" he said. An Aisin spokesman declined to comment."
General Motors,2017-11,"The decision will support or create French jobs at PSA, the sources said. It is likely to be seized upon politically as a welcome victory for local manufacturing over imports."
General Motors,2017-11,"PSA currently buys six- and eight-speed Aisin gearboxes made in Japan and China for its Peugeot, Citroen and DS brands. Assembling them itself would lower costs, reduce currency risk and help fill its Metz or Valenciennes transmission plants."
General Motors,2017-11,"Bringing production in-house also underlines the growing importance of automatic gearboxes in electrified and autonomous motoring, and in improving the fuel-efficiency and carbon emissions of conventional cars."
General Motors,2017-11,"The French carmaker had hoped its recent acquisition of Opel/Vauxhall from General Motors would help to convince Aisin to invest, as it builds up scale. [nL8N1II3CV]"
General Motors,2017-11,"But the Japanese supplier was unwilling to share control of Aisin-branded production, a senior PSA source said."
General Motors,2017-11,"""They said 'No' because they want to maintain absolute quality control over production in their name,"" the source said, adding that the licensed production would not carry Aisin's brand."

General Motors,2017-11,{{20171129T224312.203+0000}}Fitch sees U.S. auto sales for 2018 at 16.8 mln unitsBy Nick Carey
General Motors,2017-11,"DETROIT, Nov 29 (Reuters) - Fitch Ratings said it expects U.S. new vehicle sales to drop slightly in 2018, which ""could weigh a bit"" on General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co because of the importance of their home market on their overall earnings performance."
General Motors,2017-11,Fitch expects auto sales to hit 16.8 million units in 2018. Auto consultancy LMC recently raised its 2017 full-year forecast to 17.2 million units from 17.1 million units.
General Motors,2017-11,"""Although Fitch's outlook for the U.S. auto sector is stable, downside risks are increasing,"" senior director Stephen Brown wrote in a note."
General Motors,2017-11,"Despite the risk for GM and Ford, Brown wrote both automakers should ""perform solidly"" in 2018."
General Motors,2017-11,"Near term, Brown wrote that geopolitical risks such as the ongoing renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) ""that could negatively impact the sector are rising."""
General Motors,2017-11,"Longer term, new technologies such as electric vehicles and self-driving cars could create new competitors that may ""upend the industry's status quo,"" he added."
General Motors,2017-11,U.S. new auto sales rose from the end of the Great Recession through to 2016 when they hit an annual record of 17.55 million units.
General Motors,2017-11,"But a saturated market, thanks partly to a glut of nearly new used vehicles, has forced automakers to hike discounts to entice consumers to buy this year and full-year 2017 total sales are expected to decline slightly to a little over 17 million units versus 2016."
General Motors,2017-11,LMC expects car sales to dip slightly to 17 million units in 2018 and 16.8 million units in 2019.

General Motors,2017-11,"PARIS, Nov 29 (Reuters) - Peugeot maker PSA Group, which paid General Motors 1.3 billion euros for Opel, now wants about half of the money back after discovering the full extent of its CO2 emissions challenges and exposure to European fines, sources told Reuters."
General Motors,2017-11,"PSA , which completed the acquisition in late July, said earlier this month it will need to move Opel models onto its own more fuel-efficient technology faster than planned, in order to cut carbon dioxide emissions before new EU limits are phased in from 2020-21, backed by hefty penalties. [nL8N1NF1MA]"
General Motors,2017-11,"The French carmaker has told GM it believes it is owed more than half a billion euros and intends to pursue a legal claim on the grounds that it was misled about Opel's emissions strategy, two people familiar with the matter said."
General Motors,2017-11,"The companies have discussed the grievances raised by PSA, which has yet to initiate a formal claim, sources close to both manufacturers said."
General Motors,2017-11,"""We are not aware of any claim submitted by PSA regarding future CO2 targets and we cannot speculate on issues that have not been raised with us,"" GM spokesman David Caldwell said. He declined to say whether Opel emissions had been discussed."
General Motors,2017-11,"""PSA undertook a robust due diligence process including their employees and many experts and lawyers,"" Caldwell said. ""We provided them with substantial information."""
General Motors,2017-11,"PSA spokesman Bertrand Blaise declined to comment. The group's shares fell 3.9 percent to close at 17.30 euros, while GM was down 2.1 percent at $43.98 as of 1620 GMT."
General Motors,2017-11,"Carmakers are scrambling to reduce carbon emissions by the 2021 deadline, when their individual EU-imposed limits will fall to an average 95 grammes per kilometre from 130 grammes today. A decline in diesel sales is complicating their task, as consumers switch to less fuel-efficient gasoline cars."
General Motors,2017-11,"The challenge is sparking big investments in smaller engines and new powertrain technologies, from battery-powered cars to rechargeable hybrids. For those who miss their targets, fines of 95 euros per vehicle, per excess gramme of CO2, could add up to hundreds of millions of euros annually."
General Motors,2017-11,PSA believes GM misrepresented Opel's CO2 challenges and emissions trajectory during negotiations and due diligence prior to the March acquisition deal and its formal closing on July 31.
General Motors,2017-11,"""We became aware a few weeks after we finalised the closing that the company was going to the wall on CO2 emissions,"" the PSA boss told reporters on Nov. 9, after presenting a heavily revised turnaround plan at Opel headquarters near Frankfurt. PSA shares have since fallen 14 percent, underperforming peers."
General Motors,2017-11,"""We put our teams to work to completely rebuild the product and technology strategies,"" Tavares said. ""If you fail to comply (with EU rules) the weight of fines you are hit with can threaten the company's existence."""
General Motors,2017-11,"Among the unpleasant surprises was a CO2 compliance plan that relied on significant sales of the Opel Ampera-e electric car, a U.S. import based on GM's Chevrolet Bolt, at a loss approaching 10,000 euros per vehicle, two sources said."
General Motors,2017-11,"""Their technical solution was economically unviable and would have led to enormous losses,"" said one. ""So the first thing you do is drop that (product) line, but then the fleet emissions explode."""
General Motors,2017-11,"Under PSA, Opel has already suspended Norwegian sales of the Ampera-e - which account for most of the model's 1,500 deliveries to date - and increased European pricing by as much as 5,700 euros."
General Motors,2017-11,Paris-based PSA may struggle to convince GM's lawyers - and ultimately an arbitration panel - that it was not already well aware of Opel's weak emissions track record and outlook.
General Motors,2017-11,"Presenting the deal alongside Tavares almost five months before it closed, GM boss Mary Barra cited ""increasing regulatory and compliance costs"" as a key reason to offload Opel and its Vauxhall sister brand. ""The Opel/Vauxhall business model has become more difficult,"" she said."
General Motors,2017-11,"Prior to the sale, Opel was on course to miss its CO2 target by 3.7 grammes, according to a PA Consulting study published in November 2016. Stripping out the Ampera-e, then projected to reach 20,000 annual sales, the overshoot rose to 6 grammes."
General Motors,2017-11,"""We've been reporting for years that Opel/Vauxhall would have significant problems meeting the CO2 targets as GM brands in Europe,"" said Thomas Goettle, the firm's head of automotive."
General Motors,2017-11,"""Opel is five to seven years behind with their engine lineup,"" Goettle said. ""We haven't seen any big GM investments in Opel to develop plug-in hybrids or zero-emissions cars."""
General Motors,2017-11,"But Opel's real situation turned out to be even worse, PSA sources said, with the company on course to miss its CO2 goal by more than 10 grammes - a multiple of the ""slight overshoot"" discussed in deal negotiations. A margin that large would incur EU fines approaching 1 billion euros."
General Motors,2017-11,"The gap partly reflects GM's unrealistically high diesel sales assumptions and reliance on the Ampera-e, they said."
General Motors,2017-11,"""People who had worked on the closing realised quite quickly that there were these big discrepancies,"" said one. ""They had been swept under the rug."""
General Motors,2017-11,"PSA is now rushing out electric or plug-in hybrid versions of Opel's Corsa, Grandland X and Crossland X models that were not part of the original plan it presented in March."
General Motors,2017-11,"The entire Opel lineup will be redeveloped with the French carmaker's vehicle architectures and engines by 2024, three years earlier than initially planned, Tavares said on Nov. 9."
General Motors,2017-11,"""Given comments about the need to accelerate the transition of Opel vehicles to PSA technology, we assume PSA will write down the value of its investment in Opel,"" Jefferies analyst Philippe Houchois said afterwards, predicting more than 1 billion euros in writedowns over the next five years."
General Motors,2017-11,The company paid for Opel with 650 million euros in cash and another 670 million in warrants that later convert to PSA stock. PSA and BNP Paribas also bought Opel's sales financing arm in a separate 900 million-euro transaction.
General Motors,2017-11,"The acquisition deal, published in GM regulatory filings, provides for compensation payments if either party has been misled. Claims not settled by negotiation are referred for arbitration. For tax purposes, a GM payment to PSA would be treated as a deduction from the purchase price."
General Motors,2017-11,"It would also add to a European exit bill already exceeding $6 billion for GM, net of sale proceeds. That reflects a $5.5 billion charge and 3 billion euro contribution to Opel pensions, while excluding billions more in pension liabilities it kept."
General Motors,2017-11,"During the deal negotiations, GM barred Opel staff from talking to PSA and insisted the French carmaker's due diligence requests be handled by its Detroit headquarters, sources said."

General Motors,2017-11,"SAN FRANCISCO, Nov 29 (Reuters) - A self-driving General Motors Co Bolt slowly drove more than two miles through crowded San Francisco streets in its media debut on Tuesday, but double-parked cars and orange traffic cones tripped up the computer driver, and a taco truck stumped the machine."
General Motors,2017-11,"GM's self-driving unit, Cruise Automation, gave reporters rides on Tuesday, the first public roadtrips for non-employees in its cars which have been tested in San Francisco, Phoenix and Detroit."
General Motors,2017-11,"Major automakers as well as technology leaders like Alphabet Inc and Intel Corp have poured billions into autonomous vehicle research, although fully self-driving cars are a work in progress. Robo-taxi service is seen as the main use for most self-driving vehicles, including the Bolt."
General Motors,2017-11,"""Our mission is to bring this technology to commercial deployment at scale, with safety, as soon as we humanly can do that,"" GM President Dan Ammann told reporters. He repeated Chief Executive Mary Barra's promise in October that GM would roll out self-driving cars within ""quarters, not years."""
General Motors,2017-11,"During a roughly 15-minute ride in a busy area of San Francisco over a 2.2 mile (3.5km) trip, the Cruise-enhanced electric Bolt carrying a Reuters journalist encountered 117 people, 4 bikes and 129 cars, according to the car's sensors."
General Motors,2017-11,"The car, never moving more than 20 miles per hour, navigated urban traffic, a tram line, construction zones, pedestrians crossing streets and many double-parked vehicles. Urban environments are as much as 46 times more complex than suburban areas, Cruise CEO Kyle Vogt said."
General Motors,2017-11,"The Bolt reacted more conservatively than a human driver, for example slowing to a near stop after sensing a bike approaching in the opposite lane."
General Motors,2017-11,"""Looking for a clear path"" screens facing the driver and passengers read several times during the trip, when the car stopped next to some traffic cones or behind double-parked vehicles. After pauses, it restarted and passed the obstacles by itself."
General Motors,2017-11,"A taco truck was too much, though. The Bolt's human backup driver disengaged the system and took the wheel after the car waited for more than a minute behind the truck where construction workers ordered lunch."
General Motors,2017-11,"Vogt said those issues would improve over time and that the winner of the self-driving car race would be the one that first launches at ""massive scale"" rather than just being the first to market a model."
General Motors,2017-11,GM over the past several months has regained its status as the largest U.S. automaker by market capitalization over electric luxury car maker Tesla Inc .
General Motors,2017-11,"Some of GM's share surge has come from investors betting on its investments in self-driving and electric cars, although the company's profits are driven entirely by demand for trucks and SUVs in North America, and its growing sales in China.[nL2N1MZ0FE]"

General Motors,2017-11,"MEXICO CITY, Nov 20 (Reuters) - Canada and Mexico will rebuff the United States over its demand for tougher NAFTA automotive content rules, top officials said on Monday as negotiations to renew the treaty bogged down with only a few months to go."
General Motors,2017-11,"U.S. President Donald Trump is threatening to quit NAFTA, which has reshaped the continent's auto sector over the past 23 years, unless major changes can be made to return manufacturing jobs to the United States."
General Motors,2017-11,"Canadian and Mexican negotiators will address the U.S. auto demands on Tuesday, the final day of the fifth round of talks to update the North American Free Trade Agreement, chief Mexican negotiator Ken Smith told reporters."
General Motors,2017-11,"Although the talks are due to wrap up in March 2018 after a seventh and final round, they are deadlocked over a series of hard-line proposals the United States unveiled at the fourth round last month."
General Motors,2017-11,"""It's definitely slowed down from the previous round,"" said a Canadian source with direct knowledge of the talks. ""There has been no progress in the contentious chapters."""
General Motors,2017-11,Canadian and Mexican officials have complained repeatedly about what they see as U.S. inflexibility. A spokeswoman for the U.S. Trade Representative declined to comment.
General Motors,2017-11,Negotiators say they need to finish their work before campaigning for Mexico's presidential election formally begins at the end of March.
General Motors,2017-11,"The campaign team for the leftist former mayor of Mexico City and early front-runner, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, on Monday repeated calls for the NAFTA talks to be postponed until after the July presidential vote. [nL1N1NQ1Y4]"
General Motors,2017-11,The Canadian source said the sixth round would be held in Montreal at the end of January 2018.
General Motors,2017-11,"Mexico and Canada fear Trump will follow through on a promise to pull out of NAFTA, causing disruption and economic damage. The Canadian dollar edged lower against its U.S. counterpart on Monday, in part because of concerns about the negotiations. [nL1N1NQ0O2]"
General Motors,2017-11,Alarmed U.S. politicians and industry groups have started to put concerted pressure on the White House not to take drastic moves they say would cause job losses.
General Motors,2017-11,"""Support for NAFTA from the American private sector, and also members of Congress, and even Republican governors, is starting to get very vocal, which we view very positively,"" said Moises Kalach, head of the international negotiating arm of Mexico's CCE business lobby."
General Motors,2017-11,"Jeff Leal, farm minister for the powerful Canadian province of Ontario, said in an interview he believed the increasingly vocal U.S. protests would help those who wanted to keep NAFTA."
General Motors,2017-11,"Canada and Mexico are particularly unhappy about the U.S. push for tougher autos content. Vehicles and auto parts account for most of the $64 billion U.S. trade deficit with Mexico, a sore spot for Trump."
General Motors,2017-11,The Trump administration wants half of the content of all North American-built autos be produced in the United States and that the regional vehicle content requirement be increased to 85 percent from 62.5 percent.
General Motors,2017-11,"Canada and Mexico dismiss the idea as unworkable and plan to respond with presentations on how such a move would damage the North American auto industry, people briefed on the talks said."
General Motors,2017-11,"A Mexican auto industry representative with knowledge of the talks called the U.S. proposal ""insane"" on Sunday."
General Motors,2017-11,"""There is no product made in North America that meets this rule of origin requirement,"" said Matt Blunt, president of the American Automotive Policy Council, which represents Ford Motor Co , General Motors Co and Fiat Chrysler ."

General Motors,2017-11,"WASHINGTON, Nov 19 (Reuters) - Recreational vehicle retailers from across the country were sipping morning coffee at a convention in Las Vegas earlier this month when word whipped through the hotel's ""dealers' lounge"" that the U.S. Congress was considering tax law changes threatening their businesses."
General Motors,2017-11,"Republicans in the House of Representatives wanted to jettison a part of the tax code that lets dealers of RVs, cars, boats, even farm and construction machinery, write off all the interest expense of keeping inventories of vehicles on their sales lots."
General Motors,2017-11,"The RV dealers jumped on the phones to their representatives in Washington, adding to a wave of calls made by members of the powerful National Automobile Dealers Association (NADA) as well as lobbyists for boat dealers and farm machinery dealers."
General Motors,2017-11,"""It's an eyedropper approach,"" said Phil Ingrassia, head of the RV dealers' trade group who marshaled their effort from the Bally's Hotel. ""Just get heard."""
General Motors,2017-11,"By the end of the day, the crisis had passed, at least temporarily. The House had backed away from repealing the tax deduction for what dealers call floor-plan interest expense, or the financing costs they incur for vehicles on their lots, but they must still convince the Senate."
General Motors,2017-11,"NADA, which represents more than 16,000 dealers nationwide, plans to send a letter on Monday to Senate Republican leaders, saying the group will not support a tax bill lacking the House language."
General Motors,2017-11,"""The Senate business interest provision unfairly puts small businesses with high cost inventory at serious risk of paying higher taxes even when a business does not show a profit. NADA respectfully urges the Senate to include the language of H.R. 1, so that floor plan interest remains fully deductibility,"" said the letter from NADA President Peter Welch reviewed by Reuters."
General Motors,2017-11,"Senate Republicans want to put broad limits on business interest deductibility, including dealer floor plan interest. Auto lobbyists did not convince the Senate Finance Committee to change the proposal before the panel approved it late Thursday, sending it on to the full Senate for consideration."
General Motors,2017-11,"As Congress and President Donald Trump push ahead on what could be the largest tax overhaul since the 1980s, the crush of lobbyists descending on Washington, D.C., is a reminder that no legislation sweeps across American interests quite like a tax bill."
General Motors,2017-11,"Floor plan interest deductibility has been part of the tax code since 1918. The deduction costs the U.S. Treasury about $300 million a decade which is not much relative to the $4 trillion annual federal budget, but Republicans are looking at every source of new federal revenues they can find to offset the costs of deep cuts they want to make in corporate tax rates."
General Motors,2017-11,"Republicans also have raised questions about why interest costs paid by businesses in many forms is tax deductible at all, given it may encourage over-leveraging by business, and given corporations are not permitted a tax deduction for the costs of raising equity capital."
General Motors,2017-11,"For lawmakers, such questions have to be weighed against aggressive lobbying exerted by groups defending their interests, such as the NADA, whose members employ over 1.1 million people selling cars from all major automakers, including General Motors Co , Volkswagen and Toyota <7203.T>."
General Motors,2017-11,Dealers argue that they have no choice but to pay significant interest costs to finance new vehicle inventory and would face higher costs if the provision is not changed.
General Motors,2017-11,"Beyond the floor plan issue, the Electric Drive Transportation Association wants Congress to preserve a $7,500 electric vehicle tax credit."
General Motors,2017-11,"A group of retired military leaders, including a former commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps and a former Navy secretary, sent a letter to Congress last week reviewed by Reuters urging lawmakers to keep the credit, but reform it. They suggest ending the credit in 2023, but lifting the existing 200,000 vehicle cap, a move that could help automakers like Tesla Inc and General Motors."
General Motors,2017-11,"Foreign automakers such as Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T> and Honda Motor Co <7267.T> are focused on a proposal that could increase taxes for foreign automakers that pay royalties, interest or other payments to their parent companies abroad."
General Motors,2017-11,"The National Association of Home Builders wants a homeowners tax credit in the bill, especially if homeowners are only allowed to deduct the first $500,000 of their mortgage interest, as the House proposes. The association last week brought 100 builders from nationwide to fan out across Capitol Hill."

General Motors,2017-11,"WASHINGTON, Nov 19 (Reuters) - Recreational vehicle retailers from across the country were sipping morning coffee at a convention in Las Vegas earlier this month when word whipped through the hotel's ""dealers' lounge"" that the U.S. Congress was considering tax law changes threatening their businesses."
General Motors,2017-11,"Republicans in the House of Representatives wanted to jettison a part of the tax code that lets dealers of RVs, cars, boats, even farm and construction machinery, write off all the interest expense of keeping inventories of vehicles on their sales lots."
General Motors,2017-11,"The RV dealers jumped on the phones to their representatives in Washington, adding to a wave of calls made by members of the powerful National Automobile Dealers Association (NADA) as well lobbyists for boat dealers and farm machinery dealers."
General Motors,2017-11,"""It's an eyedropper approach,"" said Phil Ingrassia, head of the RV dealers' trade group who marshaled their effort from the Bally's Hotel. ""Just get heard."""
General Motors,2017-11,"By the end of the day, the crisis had passed, at least temporarily. The House had backed away from repealing the tax deduction for what dealers call floor-plan interest expense, or the financing costs they incur for vehicles on their lots, but they must still convince the Senate."
General Motors,2017-11,"NADA, which represents more than 16,000 dealers nationwide, plans to send a letter on Monday to Senate Republican leaders, saying the group will not support a tax bill lacking the House language."
General Motors,2017-11,"""The Senate business interest provision unfairly puts small businesses with high cost inventory at serious risk of paying higher taxes even when a business does not show a profit. NADA respectfully urges the Senate to include the language of H.R. 1, so that floor plan interest remains fully deductibility,"" said the letter from NADA President Peter Welch reviewed by Reuters."
General Motors,2017-11,"Senate Republicans want to put broad limits on business interest deductibility, including dealer floor plan interest. Auto lobbyists did not convince the Senate Finance Committee to change the proposal before the panel approved it late Thursday, sending it on to the full Senate for consideration."
General Motors,2017-11,"As Congress and President Donald Trump push ahead on what could be the largest tax overhaul since the 1980s, the crush of lobbyists descending on Washington D.C. is a reminder that no legislation sweeps across American interests quite like a tax bill."
General Motors,2017-11,"Floor plan interest deductibility has been part of the tax code since 1918. The deduction costs the U.S. Treasury about $300 million a decade which is not much relative to the $4 trillion annual federal budget, but Republicans are looking at every source of new federal revenues they can find to offset the costs of deep cuts they want to make in corporate tax rates."
General Motors,2017-11,"Republicans also have raised questions about why interest costs paid by businesses in many forms is tax deductible at all, given it may encourage over-leveraging by business, and given corporations are not permitted a tax deduction for the costs of raising equity capital."
General Motors,2017-11,"For lawmakers, such questions have to be weighed against aggressive lobbying exerted by groups defending their interests, such as the NADA, whose members employ over 1.1 million people selling cars from all major automakers, including General Motors Co , Volkswagen and Toyota <7203.T>."
General Motors,2017-11,Dealers argue that they have no choice but to pay significant interest costs to finance new vehicle inventory and would face higher costs if the provision is not changed.
General Motors,2017-11,"Beyond the floor plan issue, the Electric Drive Transportation Association wants Congress to preserve a $7,500 electric vehicle tax credit."
General Motors,2017-11,"A group of retired military leaders, including a former commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps and a former Navy secretary, sent a letter to Congress last week reviewed by Reuters urging lawmakers to keep the credit, but reform it. They suggest ending the credit in 2023, but lifting the existing 200,000 vehicle cap, a move that could help automakers like Tesla Inc and General Motors."
General Motors,2017-11,"Foreign automakers such as Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T> and Honda Motor Co <7267.T> are focused on a proposal that could increase taxes for foreign automakers that pay royalties, interest or other payments to their parent companies abroad."

General Motors,2017-11,"BERLIN, Nov 16 (Reuters) - Volkswagen launches its new Virtus model on Thursday to tap Brazil's highest-volume segment as part of a recovery plan that analysts said will help it regain ground on rivals General Motors and Fiat in South America's largest car market."
General Motors,2017-11,"Returning to profit in markets such as Brazil, the United States and Russia is vital for Volkswagen as it pushes to revive the core VW brand that accounted for more than half the group's 7.8 million auto sales in the first nine months but only 19 percent of underlying profit."
General Motors,2017-11,"To tap rebounding demand in price-sensitive Brazil, VW will on Thursday unveil the ""Virtus"" compact sedan in Sao Paulo, the carmaker said, after starting deliveries in the country of the redesigned Polo subcompact, one of its all-time bestsellers, and a roomier, bigger Up! minicar."
General Motors,2017-11,The world's biggest automaker last week announced 560 million euros ($660 million) of spending in Argentina to build the first sport-utility vehicle (SUV) in Brazil's neighbour.

General Motors,2017-11,"""Renewing our product portfolio in Brazil is absolutely essential,"" VW brand chief executive Herbert Diess told a conference in Berlin on Nov. 9."
General Motors,2017-11,"VW, which slashed about 7,000 jobs in South America in past years and shrunk its dealer network, wants to reduce the average age of the brand's Brazilian lineup to less than five years by 2020 from eight years in 2015, Diess said."
General Motors,2017-11,"Brazil was one of the world's five biggest auto markets until the 2014-16 downturn and remains a major base of operations for Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV , GM , VW and Ford ."
General Motors,2017-11,Analysts said VW had been slow in the past few years to refresh models in Brazil and commanded slightly higher prices than mainstream peers which overhauled lineups in the passenger-car heavy Brazilian market more quickly.
General Motors,2017-11,"""It's not unrealistic to say that VW had not been refreshing things very quickly,"" said IHS Markit analyst Stephanie Brinley. Price premiums ""are difficult to translate into a (Brazilian) market that doesn't have capacity for a higher price at all."""
General Motors,2017-11,"To cut costs and be able to lower prices, VW fully developed the Virtus in Brazil, giving proof of its post-dieselgate strategy to cede more power from its Wolfsburg headquarters to regions and brands."

General Motors,2017-11,"The new four-door model, to be built at Anchieta, VW's first-ever plant outside Germany, is one of the first cars to be spawned from a new localised version of the MQB modular platform that underpins most of the VW group's small and medium front-wheel-drive models."

General Motors,2017-11,"It did not give details of how much regular investment these state-owned enterprises (SOEs) were planning, or what industries the additional funds would be for."
General Motors,2017-11,China's ruling Communist Party has doubled down on its plans to reform the state sector through a mix of market forces and targeted support in a bid to cut inefficiencies and dominate certain swathes of the economy.
General Motors,2017-11,The latest thrust involves shaking up ownership structures and injecting private capital into the debt-ridden sector.
General Motors,2017-11,"SOEs are also increasingly acquiring stakes in private companies, including firms in what the government regards as strategic sectors."
General Motors,2017-11,"Investment in private companies in sectors such as finance, renewable energy and artificial intelligence is also a means for SOEs to chase higher returns and move away from waning industries such as low-end manufacturing."
General Motors,2017-11,"In Shanghai, a large chunk of the city's $400 billion economy remains in the hands of the state, with firms such as SAIC Motor <600104.SS>, a partner of Volkswagen and General Motors Co , and Bright Food Group Co Ltd [SHMNGA.UL], one of China's biggest food processors."

General Motors,2017-11,"Nov 15 (Reuters) - General Motors Co plans to launch a new family of electric vehicles in 2021 that will cost less to build and make a profit for the U.S. No. 1 automaker, Chief Executive Mary Barra told investors on Wednesday."
General Motors,2017-11,"Her plans represent a direct challenge to money-losing electric vehicle specialist Tesla Inc , which is struggling to get its more affordable, high-volume Model 3 launched and recently reported its largest-ever quarterly loss. [nL2N1N72DJ]"
General Motors,2017-11,"""We are committed to a future electric vehicle portfolio that will be profitable,"" Barra said at the Barclays Global Automotive Conference in New York."
General Motors,2017-11,"Electric and autonomous vehicles - known in the industry as EVs and AVs - are widely seen as the keystones of future transport, but Tesla, Ford Motor Co and other manufacturers are still working out how to make money on them."
General Motors,2017-11,"GM is looking to break out of that pattern by developing an all-new electric vehicle platform that will accommodate multiple sizes and segments, to be sold by different GM brands in the United States and China, Barra said, adding new details to GM's aggressive electrification strategy."
General Motors,2017-11,"In early October, GM said it planned to launch 20 new electric vehicles by 2023, but did not provide specifics. [nL2N1MD1YS]"
General Motors,2017-11,"In comparison, rival Ford has said it plans to introduce 13 ""electrified"" vehicles - mostly hybrid gasoline-electric models - by 2022. [nL4N1ME3GX]"
General Motors,2017-11,GM's shares were down 0.4 percent at $42.84 in midday trade. Tesla and Ford shares were also down slightly in a broadly lower market.
General Motors,2017-11,"Barra said GM aims to be selling 1 million electric vehicles a year by 2026, many of them in China, which has set strict production quotas on such vehicles. On Monday, GM's China chief said the automaker and its joint-venture partners will be able to meet the country's 2019 electric vehicle requirements without purchasing credits from other companies. [nL3N1NJ344]"
General Motors,2017-11,GM's cost reduction efforts on electric vehicles center on a new battery system that will be more than 30 percent cheaper than the one that powers the Chevrolet Bolt.
General Motors,2017-11,"The company aims to cut the cost of its lithium-ion batteries to less than $100 per kilowatt-hour from $145 per kilowatt-hour by 2021, which would bring the overall cost of electric vehicles much closer to comparable gasoline-engine models."
General Motors,2017-11,GM said the new batteries would hold more energy and charge quicker. The company is aiming to boost electric vehicle range to more than 300 miles (483 km) with the new batteries. The current Bolt is rated at 238 miles between charges.
General Motors,2017-11,"Barra said GM will have the ability to manufacture high volumes of the new batteries at plants in the United States and China. She said GM projects sales of 1 million electric vehicles a year by 2026. So far, the company has sold about 17,000 Bolts."
General Motors,2017-11,"GM's new electric vehicle platform in 2021 will serve as a base for at least nine derivatives, ranging from a compact crossover to a large seven-passenger luxury sports utility vehicle and a large commercial van. It will also provide the underpinning for a shared autonomous vehicle (AV) that GM plans to put into commercial service."
General Motors,2017-11,"Before the new platform arrives, GM plans to introduce three new electric vehicles by 2020, including two crossovers, that will share basic components with the Bolt, Barra said. She described GM as ""the only fully integrated developer of AVs with true scale capability."""
General Motors,2017-11,"""We are not capital constrained in our EV or AV development,"" she added."
General Motors,2017-11,"GM is generating strong profit from selling trucks and sport utility vehicles in the United States, and Barra reaffirmed a promise to investors that GM's core North American vehicle business should achieve 10 percent pre-tax profit margins."

General Motors,2017-11,"Under the trade deal, at least 62.5 percent of the material in a car or light truck made in the region must be from North America to be able to enter the marketplace tariff-free."
General Motors,2017-11,The Trump administration has proposed raising the proportion of NAFTA content to 85 percent and securing 50 percent of the total for the United States.
General Motors,2017-11,"The letter added that ""either outcome would adversely affect the U.S. auto industry - reducing sales, production, and exports and harming U.S. workers in the process."""
General Motors,2017-11,"Talks to overhaul NAFTA are to resume on Wednesday in Mexico City and run through Nov. 21. Trump has sharply criticized the almost 24-year-old trade agreement and called for significant changes, including the addition of a ""sunset"" provision. Mexico this week said it was preparing contingency plans in the event the talks did not conclude with an agreement."
General Motors,2017-11,The U.S. demands to reserve the lion's share of automotive manufacturing for the United States helped cast a pall over the talks to revamp the accord underpinning $1.2 trillion in annual trilateral trade.
General Motors,2017-11,"The United States had an autos and auto parts trade deficit of $74 billion with Mexico and $5.6 billion with Canada, both major components of overall U.S. goods trade deficits with its North American neighbors -- deficits that U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer has said could no longer continue."

General Motors,2017-11,"STRATIM gave its first public update on Tuesday on its software platform for such services, which help manage vehicle fleets, keep cars in good working order, fueled up and generating sufficient revenue."
General Motors,2017-11,"San Francisco-based STRATIM's platform is operating in 20 U.S. cities and its clients include General Motors Co's Maven car sharing and rental unit, Ford Motor Co's Chariot shuttle service, Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T> and BMW AG ."
General Motors,2017-11,"Major automakers are racing to roll out alternatives to private car ownership including ride sharing amid the rise of Uber and Lyft Inc, as well as to develop commercially viable self-driving cars."
General Motors,2017-11,The rush is based on the notion that instead of buying cars - the auto industry's business model for a century - consumers in the future will generate revenue through car usage.
General Motors,2017-11,One challenge for automakers is how to monitor or manage fleets of vehicles when their core traditional business is building cars. STRATIM says it may be part of the answer.
General Motors,2017-11,"Keeping shared cars in service is key to boosting profit margins as fleet management services can, for instance, provide alerts on when to fuel a car, fix a cracked windshield or replace a flat tire, STRATIM Chief Executive Sean Behr told Reuters."
General Motors,2017-11,"""It doesn't matter how great your vehicle or self-driving car is if you can't reliably keep it on the street to pick up customers, the best technology in the world is not going to save you,"" he said."

General Motors,2017-11,"China has set stringent production quotas for NEVs which automakers must meet by 2019, a move that is prompting a flurry of electric car deals and new launches of battery electric and plug-in hybrid models as automakers in China race to ensure they do not fall short.

General Motors,2017-11,"GM produces vehicles in China through a joint venture with SAIC <600104.SS>, the country's largest automaker, as well as a three-way tie-up with SAIC and Guangxi Automobile Group, formerly known as Wuling Motors."

General Motors,2017-11,Tsien told reporters on Monday that both joint ventures will try to meet those requirements without having to purchase NEV credits from other automakers with excess credits.
General Motors,2017-11,"""We intend to be able to produce enough products for those joint ventures to be able to meet the NEV quotas on their own,"" Tsien said."
General Motors,2017-11,"""I can't give you any specific (NEV production and sales volume) numbers other than to say that through the complicated formula we will either meet or exceed."""
General Motors,2017-11,"China officially unveiled NEV requirements for automakers in late September. When the green car quotas take effect in 2019, automakers will need to accumulate enough credits by producing and selling enough NEVs to hit a threshold equivalent to 10 percent of annual sales. That level would rise to 12 percent for 2020."
General Motors,2017-11,"Tsien said GM is off to a good start with an electric battery car that it launched in July. The car, called the Baojun E100, is undergoing a feasibility study of a direct-sale method GM devised for it and is currently available only in the south China city of Liuzhou where GM's three-way joint venture produces them."

General Motors,2017-11,"""Sales so far have largely met our expectations, perhaps even slightly above our expectations,"" Tsien said.

General Motors,2017-11,"Nov 9 (Reuters) - Workers at a Chinese-owned auto glass plant in southwestern Ohio voted heavily against union representation, the United Auto Workers (UAW) said on Thursday, in a major blow for the union's strategy for organizing foreign-owned auto factories."
General Motors,2017-11,UAW's defeat comes after a stinging loss it suffered in the U.S. Deep South in August.
General Motors,2017-11,"The vote, which began on Wednesday, involved roughly 1,500 workers at the Fuyao Glass Industry Group Co Ltd <600660.SS> plant in Moraine, a Dayton suburb that was once home to a large, unionized General Motors Co assembly plant."
General Motors,2017-11,"The union lost by a nearly two-to-one margin, with 868 votes against union representation and 444 votes for."
General Motors,2017-11,"""Fuyao workers fighting for a voice in their workplace were unable to win against a barrage of anti-labor tactics and intimidation by management at the Ohio glass plant,"" the UAW said in a statement."

[nL2N1CC2EJ]"
General Motors,2017-11,"Though UAW membership has crept up since the end of the Great Recession, it is around half of what it was in 1998 and well below a peak of 1.5 million members in 1979.

General Motors,2017-11,"""It's amazing to me that this is now happening to U.S. workers in America's manufacturing heartland,"" he said on Tuesday."

General Motors,2017-11,Nov 9 (Reuters) - Canadian auto parts maker Magna International Inc's chief executive said on Thursday that uncertainty over NAFTA and proposed U.S. corporate tax cuts could prompt companies to suspend investment or pour capital into the United States.
General Motors,2017-11,"U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to withdraw from the North American Free Trade Agreement among the United States, Canada and Mexico, which is heavily used by automakers that have production and supply chains spread across the three countries."

General Motors,2017-11,"FRANKFURT/PARIS, Nov 9 (Reuters) - Peugeot maker PSA Group vowed to move Opel models onto its own technology faster than initially planned to improve their emissions performance and secure promised savings from its acquisition of the loss-making German carmaker."
General Motors,2017-11,"Rapid product launches will complete the transition to PSA vehicle architectures by 2024, three years ahead of the previous timetable, Opel said, as it outlined turnaround plans that leave a 1.7 billion euro ($2 billion) synergies goal unchanged."
General Motors,2017-11,"The adjustment suggests PSA and Opel will have to do more, and faster, to achieve savings the French carmaker had promised after agreeing to buy Opel from General Motors in a March deal that valued the business at 2.2 billion euros."
General Motors,2017-11,It also reflects the tougher task of meeting European Union emissions rules with legacy Opel vehicles and engines developed under GM. The EU has just published proposals for a further 30 percent carbon dioxide emissions cut by 2030. [nL5N1NE332]
General Motors,2017-11,"""We quickly came to the conclusion that Opel was not ready to reach the CO2 targets set by the EU for 2020-2021,"" Opel boss Michael Lohscheller told reporters and analysts at the brand's headquarters in Ruesselsheim, near Frankfurt."
General Motors,2017-11,"""The good news is that synergies are validated (at) a detailed level,"" he said."
General Motors,2017-11,"PSA shares fell 2.2 percent to 19.70 euros at 1217 GMT, after Chief Executive Carlos Tavares said Opel's financial health had worsened as plans were being drawn up. ""The situation gets worse by the day,"" he said, without giving details."
General Motors,2017-11,"Yet Opel pledged to avoid factory closures or forced layoffs, instead relying on a doubling of exports by 2020 to fill underused plants as it enters new markets such as Argentina and Saudi Arabia. Weak international development under GM was a frustration in Ruesselsheim."
General Motors,2017-11,"""Opel will go global, finally,"" Lohscheller said, while cautioning the plan will nonetheless require ""reduction of cost in all areas including labour""."
General Motors,2017-11,"Wage costs will be pared from about 15 percent of revenue to an 11 percent benchmark as Opel negotiates voluntary departures, early retirements and shorter hours with its workers - part of a broader effort to cut 700 euros of costs per vehicle."
General Motors,2017-11,"""PSA has taken on a damaged company with weak brands,"" said Bernstein analyst Max Warburton. ""But automotive turnarounds usually surprise, and this one has a good smell about it,"" he added, reiterating an ""outperform"" rating on the group's shares."
General Motors,2017-11,"The renaissance of Opel and its British Vauxhall unit will be based on ""German engineering for all and a perfect match with (the) PSA brands"", Lohscheller said, referring to Peugeot, Citroen and DS."
General Motors,2017-11,"Opel will introduce at least two new cars in 2019 including the Corsa mini, with a larger car and SUV to follow, among nine models or variants promised by the following year."
General Motors,2017-11,"All models will offer electric or plug-in hybrid versions by 2024, and Opel's Ruesselsheim engineering centre will specialise in future technologies such as fuel cells and driving autonomy."
General Motors,2017-11,The product blitz will be more ambitious than previously suggested. PSA had said in March that technology convergence would begin in 2019 and take another eight years to complete.
General Motors,2017-11,"Despite the faster pace, however, PSA maintained both the 1.7 billion euro synergies goal and its 2026 deadline, with 1.1 billion or roughly two-thirds of that amount due by 2021."
General Motors,2017-11,"It also confirmed previously announced profitability targets for Opel that call for a 2 percent operating margin in 2020, rising to 6 percent in 2026."

General Motors,2017-11,"LONDON, Nov 9 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Peugeot has swerved a looming trade-off between the interests of shareholders and employees. Electric vehicles may, however, force the issue."
General Motors,2017-11,"PSA boss Carlos Tavares and Opel's Michael Lohscheller presented a turnaround plan on Thursday, 100 days after closing a deal that saw the Peugeot parent pay 1.3 billion euros for loss-making auto brands previously owned by General Motors. The two men want all the group's passenger cars to use the same basic manufacturing designs by 2024 and target 1.7 billion euros of synergies by 2026."
General Motors,2017-11,"That means the Peugeot-Opel tie-up could be a lot more lucrative if management cut jobs. The joint group operates at 86 percent of potential manned production capacity, according to research group AD Punctum. Changing technology may force Tavares and Lohscheller to address overstaffing."
General Motors,2017-11,"A shift to electric vehicles is likely to mean that auto manufacturers buy batteries from suppliers rather than building whole engines. If so, they could shrink their workforce by nearly a fifth, according to Credit Suisse analysts. While bosses could boost shareholder returns by forcing through job losses, they will face stiff resistance in countries that have powerful unions, such as France and Germany. PSA group has only temporarily dodged this most difficult of balancing acts."
General Motors,2017-11,- Peugeot parent PSA Group said on Nov. 9 that its technology will be used in all Opel-Vauxhall models sooner than initially planned to deliver promised savings from its acquisition of the loss-making German carmaker.
General Motors,2017-11,"- From 2024 onwards, all Opel and Vauxhall passenger car models will be based on joint group ""architectures"", Opel boss Michael Lohscheller said. That is three years ahead of its original plan, Reuters reported."
General Motors,2017-11,"- PSA Group said in March it was buying the Opel and Vauxhall automotive brands from General Motors for 1.3 billion euros. An additional 900 million euros would be paid by the Paris-based carmaker and BNP Paribas for Opel's financing arm, to be owned and operated jointly and consolidated by the French bank."
General Motors,2017-11,"- PSA is aiming for 1.7 billion euros of annual synergies by 2026 and 1.1 billion euros by 2020. It said on Nov. 9 that 80 percent of the savings will come from purchasing, research and development, capital spending, and selling, general and administrative expenses."

General Motors,2017-11,"Nov 9 (Reuters) - Workers at a Chinese-owned auto glass plant in southwestern Ohio will finish voting on Thursday on whether to join the United Auto Workers, in a test of the union's strategy for organizing foreign-owned auto factories after a stinging loss in the U.S. Deep South in August."
General Motors,2017-11,"The vote, which began on Wednesday, involves roughly 1,500 workers at the Fuyao Glass Industry Group Co Ltd <600660.SS> plant in Moraine, a Dayton suburb that was once home to a large, unionized General Motors Co assembly plant."
General Motors,2017-11,"The UAW needs a win after losing a bitterly contested vote at a Nissan Motor Co Ltd <7201.T> plant in Mississippi in August, which extended a decades-long record of failure to organize a major automaker's plant in the U.S. South. [nL1N1KR04I]"
General Motors,2017-11,The vote also comes amid an expanding U.S. Justice Department probe into alleged misuse of funds at UAW training centers funded by the Detroit automakers. [nL2N1N8232]
General Motors,2017-11,"Fuyao, a Chinese automotive glass supplier whose global customers include General Motors Co , Ford Motor Co , Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV , Daimler AG and Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T>, opened the plant in Moraine in 2016 as part of a broader $1 billion expansion in the United States. [nL2N1CC2EJ]"
General Motors,2017-11,"Though UAW membership has crept up since the end of the Great Recession, it is around half of what it was in 1998 and well below a peak of 1.5 million members in 1979. The Detroit automakers and their suppliers have slashed workforces at UAW-represented factories over the past 30 years as they have automated and lost sales to European and Asian rivals."
General Motors,2017-11,"This year could be the first in which North American vehicle production by the unionized Detroit Three automakers falls to less than half of total vehicle output in the region, according to IHS Markit. [nL2N1M81RG]"
General Motors,2017-11,"At Fuyao's Ohio factory, the UAW has told workers it can help them secure better safety and higher pay."
General Motors,2017-11,"Rich Rankin, head of the UAW region covering Ohio and Indiana, said workers at the Fuyao plant start at $10 an hour, much less than the $22 an hour they can make at two other unionized automotive glass plants in his region."

General Motors,2017-11,{{20171108T235132.213+0000}}LPC: Auto parts maker Chassix seeks fix for struggling dividend loanBy Andrew Berlin
General Motors,2017-11,"NEW YORK, Nov 8 (Reuters) - US auto parts manufacturer Chassix is exploring revisions to a US$320m leveraged loan backing a dividend to shareholders, following investors' lack of interest amid concerns over declining earnings, according to three sources familiar with the matter."
General Motors,2017-11,"Lead arranger JP Morgan is discussing reducing the size of the loan and the dividend payment and juicing pricing to lure buyers, who are wary of piling debt onto a company that has seen earnings drop since emerging from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection two years ago."
General Motors,2017-11,"Chassix's Ebitda, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, dropped 4.7% in 2016 and is projected to fall a further 14.3% this year, two additional sources said. The company is still experiencing a run-off of business from its restructuring that will impact revenues, which are tethered to a cyclical end market."
General Motors,2017-11,"""The company exited [bankruptcy] in 2015, and performance is still declining as some business rolls off,"" an investor said. ""They seem to have a good book of business, but this can go away if car sales decline, plus price concessions to original equipment manufacturers are always present."""
General Motors,2017-11,"The deal marks Chassix's debut in the US$939bn leveraged loan market. It is the company's first trip to the capital markets since emerging in July 2015 from a four-month stint in bankruptcy court in part precipitated by capacity constraints at its manufacturing plant in Bristol, Indiana that drove losses."
General Motors,2017-11,"The company, which supplies chassis and powertrain components to auto manufacturers including General Motors, Ford and FCA, emerged from bankruptcy protection owned by its former bondholders including Cerberus Capital Management and Oaktree Capital Management. Platinum Equity, the private equity firm that owned the company prior to the filing, transferred its equity to the funds as part of the restructuring process."
General Motors,2017-11,Chassix did not respond to requests for comment. JP Morgan and spokespersons for Cerberus and Oaktree declined to comment.
General Motors,2017-11,"Proceeds from the seven-year term loan, as originally proposed, along with balance sheet cash, were earmarked to fund a US$260m cash distribution to the new owners, repay existing debt and cover fees and expenses. The financing includes a US$125m five-year asset-based revolving credit facility that will be undrawn at close. Investors were expected to commit to the original deal by November 2."
General Motors,2017-11,"The company is considering downsizing the loan to US$200m-US$225m, and the dividend by a similar amount, the three sources said. It may also hike pricing to as much as 550bp over Libor, from the 475bp-500bp range at launch in mid-October, and further discount the offering price to 98, from 99, the sources added. There will likely be other structural changes."
General Motors,2017-11,"The original deal would have put the company's debt-to Ebitda at 2.3 times, based on US$138m of projected 2017 adjusted Ebitda, compared to roughly 0.4 times currently, according to two of the sources. With a loan of around US$215m, debt-to-Ebitda would drop to 1.6 times."
General Motors,2017-11,"Chassix was formed in 2013 through the merger of Diversified Machine Inc and SMW Automotive, LLC."
General Motors,2017-11,"The company is rated B2/B by Moody's and Standard & Poor's, respectively, while the proposed loan is rated B3/B."

General Motors,2017-11,"WASHINGTON, Nov 8 (Reuters) - A Democratic U.S. Senator from Michigan on Wednesday urged his fellow lawmakers to retain a $7,500 tax credit for people who buy electronic vehicles instead of eliminating it as Republicans have proposed."
General Motors,2017-11,"In a letter seen by Reuters, Senator Gary Peters wrote to Senate leaders that ""a new generation of jobs and families will be supported by electric vehicles. Eliminating important economic incentives for electric vehicles would be a step in the wrong direction."""

General Motors,2017-11,Critics of the credit say electric vehicle buyers tend to be wealthier than average and do not need subsidies.
General Motors,2017-11,Automakers have invested billions in electric vehicles and announced plans to shift significant production to plug-in models.
General Motors,2017-11,"Current law allows automakers to use the credit, which phases out after an automaker hits 200,000 plug-in vehicles sold. Electric vehicles have expensive batteries that make them pricier than gasoline-powered vehicles. GM and Tesla may hit the limit for vehicles that can get the tax credit by 2019."
General Motors,2017-11,"Environmental groups and an auto industry trade group oppose the House proposal, which would kick in at the end of this year. GM vowed to fight, saying the credits are ""an important customer benefit that can help accelerate the acceptance of electric vehicles."" Tesla declined to comment."
General Motors,2017-11,"Former President Barack Obama unsuccessfully proposed hiking the tax credit for electric vehicles to $10,000 and converting it to a point-of-sale rebate."
General Motors,2017-11,Automakers face mandates from California and a dozen other states to produce a rising number of zero-emission vehicles and have said the credits are essential to meeting requirements.

General Motors,2017-11,"It will roll out the service to the wider public at a later date, although it did not say when."
General Motors,2017-11,"The service will be free at first, but Waymo expects at some point to start charging for rides, a potential way to earn revenue to help offset the steep costs involved in developing the technology."
General Motors,2017-11,"The state of Arizona has no restrictions on self-driving cars, unlike California and some other states."
General Motors,2017-11,"""Because we see so much potential in shared mobility, the first way people will get to experience Waymo's fully self-driving technology will be as a driverless service,"" Krafcik said in prepared remarks after announcing the launch in Lisbon."

General Motors,2017-11,"Current law allows automakers to use the credit, which phases out after an automaker hits 200,000 plug-in vehicles sold. Electric vehicles have expensive batteries that make them pricier than gasoline-powered vehicles."
General Motors,2017-11,"Environmental groups and an auto industry trade group blasted the proposal, which would kick in at the end of this year. GM vowed to fight, saying the credits are ""an important customer benefit that can help accelerate the acceptance of electric vehicles."" Tesla declined to comment."
General Motors,2017-11,"Nissan said it supports continuing the tax credit and noted it has ""made significant investments in the development of market-leading electric vehicles."""
General Motors,2017-11,Critics of the credit say electric vehicle buyers tend to be wealthier than average and do not need subsidies.
General Motors,2017-11,"Gloria Bergquist, a spokeswoman for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a trade group representing GM, Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T>, Volkswagen AG and others, said the change could hurt electric vehicle sales."
General Motors,2017-11,"""The potential elimination of the federal electric vehicle tax credit will impact the choices of prospective buyers and make the electric vehicle mandate in 10 states - about a third of the market - even more difficult to meet,"" Bergquist said."
General Motors,2017-11,"""The EV tax credit repeal would cede U.S. leadership in clean vehicles, putting our companies at a competitive disadvantage and threatening jobs while costing drivers more at the pump and increasing pollution,"" said Luke Tonachel, director of the National Resources Defense Council's Clean Vehicles and Fuels Project."

General Motors,2017-11,"DETROIT, Nov 2 (Reuters) - Pure electric vehicles will not begin to gain serious traction in most global markets until after 2025 and will likely account for only 14 percent of total global vehicle production by 2030, according to a study released on Thursday by Boston Consulting Group."
General Motors,2017-11,"By then, the study's authors said, improved battery technology, lower costs and government mandates will drive greater consumer demand for EVs, which this year will account for less than 1 percent of the nearly 100 million vehicles sold worldwide and only 6 percent by 2025."
General Motors,2017-11,"""Eventually, we'll reach a point where we don't need incentives anymore"" to boost EV sales, said Xavier Mosquet, BCG senior partner and lead author of the study. By 2030, Mosquet said, EV demand will be driven by market forces, not regulation."
General Motors,2017-11,"Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives have already proposed eliminating one of the biggest EV incentives, a $7,500 tax credit, which could hurt automakers like General Motors Co , Tesla Inc and Nissan Motor Co <7201.T> that are selling large numbers of those vehicles. [nL2N1N81A8]"
General Motors,2017-11,"BCG expects battery costs to fall rapidly after 2020, to as low as $80 per kilowatt-hour by 2025, compared with about $150 today and more than $650 in 2010."
General Motors,2017-11,"Total operating costs also will drop, BCG said, until the cost of owning and operating an electric vehicle over 10 years will fall below that of a comparable combustion-engine vehicles by 2021."
General Motors,2017-11,"In addition, more stringent environmental targets in many countries will push vehicle manufacturers to add some form of electrification, including hybrid electric-gasoline powertrains, to reduce exhaust emissions after 2020."
General Motors,2017-11,"Even as costs drop and more advanced technology is introduced over the next 12 years, BCG said it expects 86 percent of new vehicles to continue using some form of combustion engine by 2030."
General Motors,2017-11,"Mosquet said a gradual shift to ride sharing in big cities and larger metropolitan areas, especially in the United States, will drive demand for EVs, in large part because the shared vehicles will accumulate miles more rapidly and thus narrow the gap in operating costs with combustion-engine vehicles."
General Motors,2017-11,"Likewise, a shift to self-driving vehicles, particularly in ride-sharing fleets, will boost EV demand after 2025. The cost per mile for a battery-powered self-driving vehicle could drop as low as 74 cents by 2030, making such vehicles less expensive than those with combustion engines, BCG said."

General Motors,2017-11,That news was accompanied by a better-than expected third-quarter profit as AutoNation performed well despite the impact of hurricanes during the quarter.
General Motors,2017-11,"There is fierce competition between large automakers to bring self-driving cars to market first. The pact between Waymo and Ft. Lauderdale, Florida-based AutoNation is the latest in a series of recent partnerships the self-driving unit has formed."
General Motors,2017-11,"Fully self-driving vehicles are expected to hit the market in a limited form by around 2020, in vehicle fleets rather than owned by individuals until the price of the technology involved becomes more affordable for consumers."

General Motors,2017-11,"DETROIT, Nov 1 (Reuters) - Major automakers posted mixed U.S. new vehicle sales in October on Wednesday, though America's love affair with high-margin pickup trucks and SUVs remained in full bloom as larger, pricier vehicles fared better than passenger cars."
General Motors,2017-11,Auto industry publication WardsAuto put the seasonally-adjusted annualized rate (SAAR) for light vehicle sales in October at a robust level of 18 million units.
General Motors,2017-11,"But after a long boom cycle, carmakers are still ill-prepared for the slight decline in sales anticipated for full-year 2017 and have taken too few steps to trim production, said Doug Mehl, a partner in consultancy A.T. Kearney's automotive practice."
General Motors,2017-11,"""When you make a new vehicle you have volume assumptions tagged to it and who wants to be the guy who says 'I'm going to make less of this really cool model'?"" Mehl said. ""But eventually the market is the reality and it's going to force companies one way or other here."""
General Motors,2017-11,"General Motors Co reported a sales drop of 2.2 percent for the month, with consumer sales down 6.6 percent. Sales of high-margin pickup trucks, sport utility vehicles and crossovers all rose."
General Motors,2017-11,"GM also cut its inventory of unsold vehicles - a source of concern for the market - slightly. The automaker has worked to reduce its volume of excess inventory, including through significant production shutdowns in the third quarter. GM had said its inventory would rise in October."
General Motors,2017-11,"""We are heading into the fourth quarter with good momentum, thanks to a strong U.S. economy and very strong pickup and crossover sales,"" said Kurt McNeil, GM vice president for U.S. sales operations."
General Motors,2017-11,"GM slightly reduced consumer discounts as a percentage of average transaction prices to 13.5 percent, from 13.7 percent in the third quarter."

General Motors,2017-11,{{20171101T193642.833+0000}}Luxury auto brands are scrambling to avoid a Blue U.S. ChristmasBy Nick Carey
General Motors,2017-11,"DETROIT, Nov 1 (Reuters) - When financial markets surge to new records, sales of luxury cars usually rise, too. Instead, October U.S. auto sales reports on Wednesday showed that a collapse in sales of luxury sedans is accelerating."
General Motors,2017-11,"Consumers have gradually shifted over to luxury sport utility vehicles from sedans in the last decade, but the trend - which has occurred in both the non-luxury and luxury segments of the auto market - was particularly pronounced in October."
General Motors,2017-11,"Sales of Daimler AG's Mercedes-Benz S-Class, long a global benchmark for large, premium sedans, plunged 49 percent in October, and are down 24.8 percent for the year to date. General Motors Co's Cadillac brand said it sold just 779 of its CTS sedans in October. Demand for that car, designed to compete with German luxury sedans, is down nearly 33 percent for the year."
General Motors,2017-11,"Cadillac's best-selling model this year is the XT5 compact SUV, which has more than doubled sales from a year ago."
General Motors,2017-11,The shift within the luxury vehicle market away from sedans toward SUVs of all sizes is forcing some of the most prestigious brands to scramble to add SUV models to their lineups or boost SUV production to meet demand.
General Motors,2017-11,"""In the short term, there will be pressure to add (consumer) incentives, cut production or both,"" said Cox Automotive analyst Michelle Krebs. ""And we just don't see an end in sight to this trend."""
General Motors,2017-11,"According to Kelley Blue Book data, in 2007 luxury sedans made up 7.6 percent of U.S. new vehicle sales, while luxury SUVs made up 4.2 percent. Through September this year, luxury SUVs made up just over 7 percent of the market, compared with 4.9 percent for luxury sedans."
General Motors,2017-11,"In the short term, luxury brands could use holiday season sales promotions to clear slow-selling sedans off dealer lots, analysts said. Toyota Motor Corp's <7203.T> Lexus brand said on Wednesday it will launch its ""December to Remember"" year-end sales promotion for the 18th straight year."
General Motors,2017-11,"Longer-term, luxury car makers have to restructure their model lineups, which have for decades reflected conventional thinking that the ""flagship"" of a luxury vehicle brand is a big sedan."
General Motors,2017-11,Industry executives and analysts said luxury brands will launch more SUVs. BMW AG and Mercedes-Benz are both expanding their U.S. sport utility vehicle plants.
General Motors,2017-11,"Some luxury sedans will disappear from lineups, but not all. Lexus, for instance, is launching a redesigned version of its flagship LS sedan in the United States in 2018, starting at around $75,000."
General Motors,2017-11,"Established luxury car brands must reckon with the impact of Tesla Inc's electric vehicles, which have redefined the boundaries for advanced technology."
General Motors,2017-11,"Offering a little more horsepower is not enough to draw in many customers, said Scott Keogh, head of Audi's U.S. operations. ""There really isn't a new stimulus"" for owners of current models to trade in their vehicles, he said."
General Motors,2017-11,"""Audi buyers ... want the latest and greatest,"" he said. That is one reason why the brand, owned by Volkswagen AG , plans to launch an electric sport utility in the United States by 2019."
General Motors,2017-11,"Sam Fiorani, vice president of AutoForecast Solutions, said automakers are keen to encourage eager consumers to buy luxury SUVs and crossovers as those models face less stringent fuel regulations and are far more profitable than sedans."
General Motors,2017-11,"""There's still a significant portion of the market that wants a car,"" Fiorani said, ""but I'm sure there were people who preferred a horse to a car at one point."""
General Motors,2017-11,"Randy Parker, U.S. head of Nissan Motor Co Ltd's <7201.T> luxury Infiniti brand, said much depends on the U.S. economy and gasoline prices, but luxury brands ""with a really robust SUV and crossover portfolio will ... win in the next few years."""
General Motors,2017-11,"As investment dollars shift to SUV models, poor performers among luxury sedans will ""fall by the wayside"" said Bill Rinna, senior manager for North American forecasts at consultancy LMC Automotive."
General Motors,2017-11,"""Are some of your stalwarts going away?"" he said. ""I don't believe so."""

General Motors,2017-11,Auto sales typically track macro indicators such as employment and economic growth. Canada's economy posted the fastest growth of the Group of Seven major economies in the first half of 2017.

General Motors,2017-11,"DETROIT, Oct 31 (Reuters) - Renesas Electronics Corp <6723.T> said on Tuesday it will provide semiconductors for self-driving cars that Japanese automaker Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T> plans to bring to market in 2020."
General Motors,2017-11,Automakers are racing to be the first to market with commercially viable self-driving vehicles.
