walmart,2017-8,{{20170831T123852.058+0000}}UPDATE 2-Shares in retailer Carrefour dive after profit warning* Shares fall to 5-year low
walmart,2017-8,"PARIS, Aug 31 (Reuters) - Shares in Carrefour slumped to a five-year low after the world's second-largest retailer issued a profit warning, highlighting the scale of the challenges its new boss faces in the cut-throat French retail market."
walmart,2017-8,"Analysts said they expected Alexandre Bompard, who joined in July, to take tough decisions to turn around a weak business in France, including cutting costs at the struggling hypermarkets while stepping up investment to accelerate online expansion."
walmart,2017-8,"Late on Wednesday, Carrefour, Europe's largest retailer and second in the world only to Wal-Mart by sales, posted a steeper-than-expected fall in first-half earnings. [nL8N1LG5KP]"
walmart,2017-8,Carrefour also warned that its 2017 operating profit could fall by around 12 percent.
walmart,2017-8,"Carrefour shares were down 15 percent at 16.52 euros in mid-session trading, its lowest level in around five years, and with the stock set for its biggest one-day percentage fall on record."
walmart,2017-8,"Barclays analysts, who have an ""equal-weight"" rating on Carrefour, said the poor first-half performance ""illustrates the group's structural challenges, including its strong exposure to the competitive and irrational French food retail market."""
walmart,2017-8,"In France, which accounts for 47 percent of sales and 44 percent of operating profit, Carrefour's struggling hypermarkets still dominate but face fierce price competition from online rivals and from more agile rivals such as the unlisted Leclerc."
walmart,2017-8,"This led Carrefour to engage in a more aggressive commercial strategy in the first half, which weighed on its French margins."
walmart,2017-8,"Deutsche Bank analysts, who retained a ""sell"" rating and cut EPS 2017/18 forecasts by 8 percent, cautioned that further price cuts might be needed in France in a climate which finance chief Pierre-Jean Sivignon described as ""highly competitive""."
walmart,2017-8,"""With its recent price investment, we believe the group repositioned French hypers from a 6 percent price gap with Leclerc to 5 percent, which still might prove too difficult for Carrefour to gain or even stabilise its market shares,"" said the Deutsche Bank team."
walmart,2017-8,"The 44-year-old Bompard joined last month from French retailer Fnac-Darty , with a solid track record as a tough cost-cutter and a digital expert."
walmart,2017-8,"He told investors on Wednesday he would ""re-shape"" the French hypermarkets arm and boost its online expansion as Carrefour needs to catch up in the digitalisation of the industry, with Amazon's $13.7 billion bid to buy Whole Foods Market having shaken up the sector."
walmart,2017-8,"Bernstein analysts said that while Bompard's initial comments were encouraging, there were other, deeper problems."
walmart,2017-8,"""The problem at Carrefour can't simply be prices. Carrefour France has lost touch with want consumers really want,"" they wrote."
walmart,2017-8,"JP Morgan cut its rating on Carrefour to ""neutral"" from ""overweight"". Analysts at Jefferies downgraded the stock to ""hold"" from ""buy"", while HSBC cut it to ""reduce"" from ""hold""."
walmart,2017-8,"""Carrefour lacks momentum, has lost its scale advantage, and already has low profitability. The outlook is challenging,"" HSBC said."
walmart,2017-8,Barclays cut its EPS forecasts by 18 percent for 2017 and its price target to 20 euros from 22 euros.

walmart,2017-8,"LOS ANGELES/CHICAGO, Aug 28 (Reuters) - On its first day as part of Amazon.com , organic grocery chain Whole Foods Market Inc slashed prices on popular items like avocados and apples on Monday by a third as it bid to shake off its ""Whole Paycheck"" reputation for high prices."
walmart,2017-8,"In another sign of changes to come, a display offering Amazon's Echo and smaller Echo Dot hands-free smart speakers for $99.99 and $44.99, respectively, was nestled amid the colorful produce at the Whole Foods in downtown Los Angeles. Those gadgets sell for the same price on Amazon.com."
walmart,2017-8,"The companies signaled last week that they would selectively cut Whole Foods prices starting on Monday, and promised more discounts in the future."
walmart,2017-8,"Major supermarket chains and grocery sellers, including Kroger Co , Sprouts Farmers Market Inc , Supervalu Inc , Costco Wholesale Corp and Wal-Mart Stores Inc , already were grappling with growing pricing pressure when Whole Foods and Amazon announced their $13.7 billion merger deal on June 16."
walmart,2017-8,"And, shares in those food sellers have fallen on worries that Amazon could disrupt the grocery business in the same way it did with books and electronics."
walmart,2017-8,"The price of organic Hass avocados was slashed by 33 percent to $1.99 each, down from $2.99, in the Whole Foods in downtown Los Angeles. Organic Fuji apples sell for $1.99 a pound, from $2.99 previously."
walmart,2017-8,"Boneless rib eye prices dropped to $13.99 per pound from $16.99 in downtown Los Angeles, a reduction of nearly 18 percent, while the price for ""responsibly farmed"" Atlantic salmon filets fell to $9.99 per pound from $13.99, down almost 29 percent."
walmart,2017-8,"Price cuts varied slightly from city to city. For example, a Whole Foods in Chicago's West Loop reduced organic avocado prices by 20 percent, while Bloomberg reported that a Manhattan store chopped the price on organic Fuji apples by 43 percent."
walmart,2017-8,"The downtown Los Angeles Whole Foods prices, in some cases, were lower than those at a nearby Ralphs grocery store owned by Kroger, which competes aggressively on price."
walmart,2017-8,"Ralphs was selling conventional avocados for $1.99, versus $1.49 at Whole Foods. Conventionally grown bananas were also priced higher at Ralphs: 59 cents a pound, against 49 cents at Whole Foods."
walmart,2017-8,Some analysts estimate that Whole Foods would have to cut prices by 10 to 15 percent overall to truly compete with other food sellers.
walmart,2017-8,"Nevertheless, its surgical paring of prices on popular staples could force other retailers to follow. That would only add pressure on those retailers, who already were preparing for another step down in prices as German discounters Aldi and Lidl expand in the United States and intensify the price war historically led by Wal-Mart ."
walmart,2017-8,"Shazneen Gandhi, 41, in Los Angeles said the Amazon-Whole Foods merger is a frequent topic of conversation among her friends and fellow mothers."
walmart,2017-8,"""We're really expecting great things,"" said Gandhi, who closely tracks grocery prices for her business selling prepared organic meals."
walmart,2017-8,"Cynthia Von Weiss, 62, groused about the ""ridiculous"" high price for chicken salad as she shopped at the West Loop Whole Foods and said the store would have to aggressively compete with local grocers to win her loyalty."
walmart,2017-8,"""We'll see what happens ... If I could come in here and spend something comparable to Mariano's or Jewel, or ideally Trader Joe's, then they got a customer for life,"" she said. Mariano's is owned by Kroger and Jewel is owned by Albertsons Cos."
walmart,2017-8,"As part of Amazon's putting its stamp on the grocer, Whole Foods stores displayed promotions for Amazon's Echo speaker in tongue-in-cheek fashion, with signs reading ""Farm Fresh"" and ""Pick of the Season."""
walmart,2017-8,The Echo plays a critical role in Amazon's burgeoning ambitions to popularize and dominate the market for voice-controlled computing.
walmart,2017-8,"Echo speakers are equipped with Amazon's voice-controlled assistant Alexa, which competes with Apple Inc's Siri. Users can direct Alexa to set timers, play music, read recipes, order deliveries, and perform a host of other activities."
walmart,2017-8,Shares of Amazon were up 0.1 percent at $946.01 in afternoon trading.
walmart,2017-8,"Sprouts was the hardest hit of the food sellers. Its shares tumbled 9.8 percent on Monday, compared with the 2.7 percent drop for Supervalu and the less than 1 percent decline for the remainder of the group."

walmart,2017-8,"Aug 24 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc said it will cut prices on a range of popular goods as it completes its acquisition of Whole Foods Market Inc , sending shares of rival grocers tumbling on fears that brutal market share battles will intensify."
walmart,2017-8,"Amazon's $13.7 billion purchase of Whole Foods, which will be completed on Monday, has been hanging over a brick-and-mortar retail sector unsure of how to respond to the world's biggest online retailer."
walmart,2017-8,"Shares of Kroger Co , the biggest U.S. supermarket operator, closed down 8 percent, while Wal-Mart Stores Inc , the biggest U.S. food seller, closed down 2 percent."

walmart,2017-8,The S&P 500 Food Retail index closed down almost 5 percent as more than $10 billion was wiped off the market value of big food sellers.
walmart,2017-8,Amazon said members of its $99-per-year Prime shopping club would eventually be rolled into Whole Foods' customer rewards program and be eligible for special offers and discounts.
walmart,2017-8,"""There was never any doubt that Amazon would lower prices, and even offer further discounts in-store to Prime members,"" said Baird Equity Research analyst Colin Sebastian."

walmart,2017-8,"""It does not look like they will go kamikaze on pricing,"" said Roger Davidson, president of consulting firm Oakton Advisory Group and a former retail executive. ""They will lower prices on consequential items to drive traffic and sales but not do a whole store price reduction which could really damage gross margin and potentially wipe out operating margin."""
walmart,2017-8,"Lowering prices could stem defections by price-sensitive Whole Foods shoppers, and help the grocer shed its ""Whole Paycheck"" reputation for high prices that are generally 15 to 25 percent above rivals. It could also bring in new consumers who can then be urged to shop for food and other products online. ""It's ultimately a nice land grab,"" said Bill Bishop of retail consultancy Brick Meets Click, and a way to get customers ""thinking about buying healthy food from Amazon."""
walmart,2017-8,"The planned price cuts would have been a tough sell to Whole Foods' investors, who had grown used to fat profits from the upscale chain, but are more in line with Amazon's broader strategy of sacrificing short-term profit for long-term market dominance."
walmart,2017-8,"""Amazon is more focused on driving volume and improving service at the expense of profit margins,"" said Sebastian. ""Long-term, this strategy works because the absolute profit dollars can still be significant."""
walmart,2017-8,Amazon's willingness to take lower profit margins ups the ante in the increasingly costly grocery price war.
walmart,2017-8,"""In some cases grocery retailers have had to invest between $500 million to $1 billion in order to reduce prices to a level that retained customers and resulted in a net increase in customers,"" said Brittain Ladd, who until earlier this year was a senior manager working to globally roll out AmazonFresh, Amazon's grocery delivery service."
walmart,2017-8,"Adding Whole Foods benefits should help Amazon attract more shoppers to its successful Prime scheme, which features two-day shipping for eligible purchases and unlimited streaming of movies and TV shows. Amazon has more than 60 million Prime members, according to analyst estimates."

walmart,2017-8,"NEW YORK, Aug 24 (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Thursday dismissed lawsuits by consumers who had sued food manufacturers and retailers over their ""100% grated Parmesan cheese"" labels, alleging they were deceiving buyers because the products actually contained cellulose filling."
walmart,2017-8,"Starting in early 2016, companies such as The Kraft Heinz Co , Target Corporation , Wal-Mart Stores Inc and Supervalu Inc were hit with some 50 lawsuits, which were consolidated in a multidistrict litigation in federal court in Chicago."

walmart,2017-8,"CHICAGO, Aug 24 (Reuters) - Many U.S. Hispanics are venturing out only to buy essential goods and are cutting back on discretionary spending, worried about possible harassment by immigration or law enforcement officials since the election of U.S. President Donald Trump, according to community groups, research firms and retailers."
walmart,2017-8,"This change in consumer behavior by the country's second-fastest-growing ethnic group has recently been cited as a cause for worry by already-struggling consumer companies, from big-box retailers to auto parts makers."
walmart,2017-8,"O'Reilly Automotive Chief Executive Gregory Henslee told analysts earlier this month that many of the company's stores with weak second-quarter sales were in Hispanic-dominant areas of the United States. ""It's not just something that we've seen. It's something that most retailers have seen,"" Henslee said."
walmart,2017-8,"In late July, Target Corp Chief Executive Brian Cornell at a conference referenced a report by retail consultants NPD Group that cited a decline in discretionary spending by Hispanics."
walmart,2017-8,"""They are staying home. They are going out less often, particularly around border towns in the United States,"" Cornell said at a conference in Aspen, Colo."
walmart,2017-8,Trump's surprise election win last November came partly on campaign promises to deport undocumented foreigners en masse and build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. These pledges - along with Trump's claim that Mexico was sending rapists and drug dealers into the United States - sparked outrage within the American Hispanic community.
walmart,2017-8,"""For our own president to call us criminals, thieves and rapists - it's terrible ... we live in fear of doing those simple things like going for groceries,"" said a 19-year-old Chicago college student, Juan F., who did not want his full name used out of concern for family members who are undocumented."
walmart,2017-8,"Juan, a U.S. citizen, said he has been shopping for his household since Trump's presidency began because family members are afraid to leave the house."
walmart,2017-8,"""People are squirreling money away and don't want to leave their houses to go to stores,"" said Eric Rodriguez of Latino advocacy group UnidosUS, which has been critical of Trump's proposals on immigration."
walmart,2017-8,"""They're afraid local law enforcement or immigration officials are going to harass or embarrass them,"" he said in an interview."
walmart,2017-8,"Not all consumer categories, however, are experiencing a significant decline in Hispanic spending. The purchase of essentials such as food and basic household goods is still on the rise, but at a much slower rate than in recent years, according to research firm Nielsen."
walmart,2017-8,"None of the reports specified any changes to first-half online spending by Hispanics, which make up about 18 percent of the U.S. population, according to research firm Nielsen Holdings Plc ."
walmart,2017-8,"The lower spending by Hispanics has been hurting certain retailers since the start of the year, according to reports by brokerage firm Jefferies and analytics firm NPD Group."
walmart,2017-8,"Cornell, citing a more detailed version of the NPD report than one that has been publicly released, said late last month that shopping visits among Latinos were down about 11 percent in November and December. The ""concerning"" trend had been noticed particularly around U.S. border towns, Cornell said."
walmart,2017-8,"""Their buying power is undeniable, as is their influence on everything from fashion and food to music and entertainment,"" Cornell said."
walmart,2017-8,"Big-box retailers have for years invested heavily in courting the Hispanic community's substantial spending power, which reached $1.4 trillion in 2016, according to data by the University of Georgia's Terry College of Business."
walmart,2017-8,"Luis Fitch, founder of Minneapolis-based Hispanic marketing company UNO Branding, whose clients have included Target and Best Buy Co Inc , said several small clients across different cities had posted declining sales since Trump took office, and that this had to be affecting big-box retailers, too."
walmart,2017-8,"""It's very common to have a Mexican married to an American, but if that Mexican is undocumented, he's really afraid of going out and looking for work,"" Fitch said. ""And if only one person is working, obviously their budget is cut in half and that's a problem if they were going to buy a house or car this year."""
walmart,2017-8,"On average, Hispanics are younger than non-Hispanics, have more children, and spend more on each child, according to Jeff Humphreys, director of economic forecasting at the Terry College of Business. Humphreys also said Hispanics tend to spend more on apparel, making their buying choices crucial to many retailers."
walmart,2017-8,"NPD said makers of athletic wear popular with Hispanics, including Nike Inc , Skechers USA Inc and Vans , would take a big hit."

walmart,2017-8,"JOHANNESBURG, Aug 24 (Reuters) - Massmart Holdings Ltd , the South African arm of Wal-Mart , reported a small rise in half-year earnings on Thursday, helped by cost cuts as cash-strapped shoppers spent warily."

walmart,2017-8,"CHICAGO, Aug 23 (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc is teaming up with Alphabet Inc's Google to enter the nascent voice-shopping market, currently dominated by Amazon.com Inc , adding another front to Wal-Mart's battle with the online megastore."
walmart,2017-8,"Google, which makes the Android software used to run most of the world's smartphones, will offer hundreds of thousands of Walmart items on its voice-controlled Google Assistant platform from late September, Walmart's head of e-commerce, Marc Lore, wrote in a blog post on Wednesday."
walmart,2017-8,"Lore, who joined the world's largest retailer after it bought his e-commerce company Jet.com, said Wal-Mart would offer a wider selection than any retailer on the platform."
walmart,2017-8,"Amazon, whose voice-controlled aide Alexa allows users to shop from the retailer, has the lion's share of the U.S. voice-controlled device industry, with its Echo devices accounting for 72.2 percent of the market in 2016, far ahead of the Google Home gadget's 22 percent, according to research firm eMarketer."
walmart,2017-8,Amazon has also dominated Wal-Mart and other brick-and-mortar retailers in online sales.
walmart,2017-8,"Wal-Mart has begun pushing back aggressively, however, offering discounts to customers who buy online and pick up in-store, and free two-day shipping for purchases of $35 or more. The latter move even forced Amazon, which rarely imitates the competition, to lower its threshold for free shipping."
walmart,2017-8,Lore said in the blog post Wal-Mart was also integrating its quick reordering tool into Google's same-day delivery service.

walmart,2017-8,"Customers might be able to use voice shopping to pick up a discounted order in-store or buy fresh groceries across the country, he said."
walmart,2017-8,"But while both Amazon and Google's voice-controlled speakers are gaining in popularity, people still mainly use them for such basic tasks as placing phone calls or playing music."

walmart,2017-8,{{20170818T183440.978+0000}}US dollar stores stand their ground in escalating retail price warBy Sruthi Ramakrishnan
walmart,2017-8,"Aug 18 - U.S. dollar stores have not become collateral damage, as feared, in a price war among big retailers including Wal-Mart Stores Inc and Kroger Co , which has pushed down prices of key items such as eggs and laundry detergent."
walmart,2017-8,"Dollar Tree Inc and Dollar General Corp , which together operate more than 28,000 stores across the United States, have said they don't need to keep cutting prices to stay competitive."
walmart,2017-8,"Both companies lost some sales to Wal-Mart last year, right after the retail giant started slashing prices and gave up margins to grab market share."
walmart,2017-8,"But they have recuperated considerably, though sales growth is expected to remain pressured in the short term as bigger retailers win customers by matching their prices."
walmart,2017-8,"Their popularity with price-conscious shoppers who want to avoid big stores that typically stock large packs of supplies and more expensive national brands, largely shield them from competition, analysts said."
walmart,2017-8,"Well-to-do millennials who faced the recession and have found prudence in curtailing family budgets, are also increasingly shopping from dollar stores, mostly for quick fill-in trips or store-branded toiletries and party supplies."
walmart,2017-8,"""The big advantage that dollar stores have is that, given their store footprint and the real estate they need, they can exist ... in small towns where Wal-Mart or supermarkets are not going to go,"" said Euromonitor analyst Jared Koerten."
walmart,2017-8,"Dollar General forecast net sales to increase by about five percent to seven percent for the year ending Feb. 2, just short of the 7.8 percent average growth it reported over the past two fiscal years."
walmart,2017-8,"Dollar Tree expects net sales for the year ending January to rise 5.9 percent to 7.4 percent. The company reported an average growth rate of 8.6 percent in the past two years, excluding sales from Family Dollar, which it bought in 2015."
walmart,2017-8,"In contrast, Wal-Mart and Kroger expect low single-digit growth."
walmart,2017-8,"Dollar stores, which operate on razor-thin margins, are doing their bit to draw in customers: sprucing up stores, stocking more national brands such as Tide, selling food and fresh produce, and are opening more stores."
walmart,2017-8,"But this also sets them up for more competition with deep-pocketed retailers who continue to offer huge discounts and spend more to revamp stores, pay higher wages and improve their online business to compete against Amazon.com Inc ."
walmart,2017-8,"Dollar General's shares are flat so far this year, while Dollar Tree's shares are down 3.7 percent. The S&P 500 Consumer Discretionary index <.SPCOMD> is up 8.8 percent in the same period."
walmart,2017-8,"Another longer-term concern could be retailers such as Aldi and new entrant Lidl, which are more like dollar stores in size and location of shops and have announced expansion plans, but analysts aren't worried yet."
walmart,2017-8,"""Dollar stores are a convenience play. They are not grocery stores,"" said Moody's analyst Mickey Chadha."
walmart,2017-8,"""They offer a lot of consumables that are not all private label, but also offer home products, seasonal products, electronics, apparel and accessories that are higher margin."""

walmart,2017-8,"CHICAGO, Aug 17 (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc warned on Thursday that this quarter's earnings could miss Wall Street's estimates as the world's biggest retailer struggles with falling margins due to price-cutting and heavy spending on its e-commerce operations."
walmart,2017-8,"The company's shares fell more than 2 percent, with investors shrugging off a higher full-year profit outlook and sales that defied sluggish consumer demand that has hurt many rivals. Wal-Mart has reported three straight years of comparable sales growth as more people shop at its stores and on its websites."
walmart,2017-8,"With a steady rise in the number of people who buy online, e-commerce sales growth has been outstripping brick-and-mortar."
walmart,2017-8,"Like other retailers, Wal-Mart has been aggressively investing in its e-commerce business in the past year. It has begun offering programs like free-two-day shipping and discounts for picking up online purchases at stores, and it acquired several startups, including Jet.com for $3.3 billion last year."
walmart,2017-8,The company's online sales growth outpaced the industry at 60 percent in the second quarter ended on July 31 but decelerated from the 63 percent increase of the previous quarter. Wal-Mart said most of the growth had come from its own online business and not the acquisitions it has made in the past year.
walmart,2017-8,"Wal-Mart has also been cutting grocery prices to remain competitive against discounters like Germany's Aldi Inc, which is rapidly expanding in the United States, and Lidl, another German rival that has recently started opening stores in the country. [nL1N1G91ME]"
walmart,2017-8,"Given Wal-Mart's moves, margins may contract for the rest of the year, UBS said in a note to clients."
walmart,2017-8,"But despite the earnings warning and pressure on margins, most analysts remained bullish on Wal-Mart because of its sales performance."
walmart,2017-8,"""The second-quarter numbers show that Wal-Mart remains firmly on the front foot and is more than holding its own in a challenging and competitive retail market,"" said GlobalData Retail Managing Director Neil Saunders."
walmart,2017-8,"Second-quarter sales at U.S. stores open at least a year rose 1.8 percent, excluding fuel price fluctuations and including e-commerce. That exceeded market expectations for a 1.7 percent increase, according to research firm Consensus Metrix."
walmart,2017-8,"The company cited its grocery and food business, which reported its best performance in five years, and said its online operation added 70 basis points to comparable sales."
walmart,2017-8,"Total revenue increased 2.1 percent to $123.4 billion from a year earlier. It would have been up 2.9 percent without the effects of currency fluctuations, which the company said had diminished from previous quarters."
walmart,2017-8,"Net income attributable to Wal-Mart fell 23 percent to $2.9 billion due to a loss from repurchasing debt after a bond tender offer. Excluding special items, earnings per share of $1.08 exceeded the analysts' average estimate of $1.07, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S."
walmart,2017-8,"Gross margins were down 11 basis points at 25 percent, including a five-basis-point decline in the United States, compared with analysts' expectations of 25.22 percent."
walmart,2017-8,"Operating margins fell to 4.9 percent from 5.1 percent, and U.S. operating expenses rose 3.9 percent."
walmart,2017-8,"The company said it expected third-quarter earnings of 90 cents to 98 cents a share, excluding special items. Analysts on average had forecast 98 cents."
walmart,2017-8,"Wal-Mart raised the low end of its earnings outlook for the full year to $4.30 per share from $4.20, excluding items, while keeping the high end at $4.40."

walmart,2017-8,{{20170817T134523.310+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-Wal-Mart beats Amazon at its own game(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are her own.)
walmart,2017-8,"NEW YORK, Aug 17 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Wal-Mart is beating Amazon at its own game. The $244 billion retailer cranked out its 12th quarter of growing U.S. sales in a row in the three months to the end of July. E-commerce soared 60 percent, sparked in part by food shoppers. That gives Chief Executive Doug McMillon a leg up as the industry waits for Amazon.com to digest its $13.7 billion Whole Foods Market meal."
walmart,2017-8,"The online mega-store run by Jeff Bezos has had an immense impact on the retail sector. Physical stores are closing in droves, a number of companies have gone out of business and shares in those that are left are mostly suffering as results seem to bear out fears that Amazon can crush all-comers."
walmart,2017-8,"Just in the past couple of weeks, shares in Dick's Sporting Goods , Advance Auto Parts , J.C. Penney , Macy's and Kohl's all cratered as they either missed estimates or lowered expectations. Even the larger, more defensible players can get dinged. Home Depot's stock dropped 2.4 percent on Tuesday even though it beat estimates, grew online sales 23 percent and big-ticket purchases by 12 percent."
walmart,2017-8,"Wal-Mart Stores has done more than most to combat the Amazon attack. McMillon splashed out $3.3 billion on Jet.com and snapped up other online retailers including Bonobos, Moosejaw and ShoeBuy. These have helped fuel the company's online-sales expertise. But revenue is rolling in not just from its targets' existing customers: a lot of the growth at Walmart.com is organic, according to the company."
walmart,2017-8,"Granted, the downside to investing in all this growth is a slight drop in Wal-Mart's gross profit margin. That, perhaps, explains why its stock fell more than 2 percent in early trading. But it's a small price to pay to keep Amazon at bay."
walmart,2017-8,"- Wal-Mart Stores on Aug. 17 reported net income attributable to the company of $2.9 billion for its fiscal second quarter of 2018, which ran to the end of July. Excluding a $798 million charge related to the extinguishment of some debt and a gain from selling Suburbia, part of its Mexico business, Wal-Mart earned $1.08 a share. That was at the top of the company's forecast and just beat the consensus estimate of sell-side analysts of $1.07 a share."
walmart,2017-8,"- Revenue rose 2.1 percent from the same period last year to $123.4 billion. At its U.S. stores, Wal-Mart said sales increased 1.8 percent, the 12th consecutive quarter with positive comp sales."

walmart,2017-8,"LONDON, Aug 17 (Reuters) - Asda, the British supermarket arm of Wal-Mart , the world's largest retailer, reported its first underlying sales growth in three years on Thursday and said its back-to-basics turnaround under a new management team was working."
walmart,2017-8,Wal-Mart has said Asda was too slow in responding to that competition and prior to Thursday's update Asda had reported eleven straight quarters of like-for-like sales decline. [nL5N1FS4I4]
walmart,2017-8,"Wal-Mart veteran Sean Clarke, who re-joined Asda as CEO in July last year, and former Sainsbury's executive Roger Burnley, who started as chief operations officer three months later, have focused their turnaround efforts on the retail basics."
walmart,2017-8,"They have re-established Asda's competitiveness by sharpening pricing in key areas such as fresh meat and vegetables, have improved the quality and availability of product ranges and have made its stores more attractive to shoppers."
walmart,2017-8,"Asda said like-for-like sales rose 1.8 percent, excluding petrol, in its fiscal second quarter to June 30. That compares with a 2.8 percent fall in its first quarter. [nL8N1IK3N2]"
walmart,2017-8,"In Asda's second quarter last year sales slumped 7.5 percent, its worst ever quarterly result, meaning comparative numbers were very weak. The outcome also benefited from food price inflation across the industry."
walmart,2017-8,"""Customers are responding to investments in price and store experience by visiting the stores more often and increasing their basket sizes,"" said Wal-Mart President and CEO Doug McMillon, who visited Asda's operations in June."
walmart,2017-8,"""There's still much more to be done, but we're clearly headed in the right direction."""
walmart,2017-8,"Clarke noted 275,000 new customers shopped at Asda in the second quarter, particularly during Easter, but he cautioned that the market remained competitive. [nL5N1KG1JB]"

walmart,2017-8,"Last month the Sunday Times reported that Asda was considering a 4.4 billion pound ($5.7 billion) takeover of British discount retailer B&M European Value Retail . Asda has declined to comment. However, a source with knowledge of the situation said the report was not true. Separately on Thursday Wal-Mart reported a 12th straight quarterly increase in comparable sales, though margins fell, reflecting price cuts and investment in e-commerce. [nL2N1L30B5]"

walmart,2017-8,UPDATE 2-Israel's Teva seeks partners for new drugs to relieve pressure - Reuters News
walmart,2017-8,"JERUSALEM/LONDON/FRANKFURT, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Teva Pharmaceutical Industries is looking to team up with other drugmakers to fund some of its development pipeline as it struggles with debts and expiring patents."
walmart,2017-8,"""We are looking for partners ... a series of partners. It's not to fund the whole pipeline, just some projects in it. A small part of it,"" Teva spokeswoman Denise Bradley told Reuters in an email on Wednesday."
walmart,2017-8,"Israel's Teva needs extra financial firepower to develop new drugs and has few options left other than striking alliances with big pharma players, sources familiar with the company said."
walmart,2017-8,"""Teva will avoid injecting any extra funding in new drugs,"" one of the sources said. ""They will partner with other big pharmas and share the proceeds."""
walmart,2017-8,"Earlier this month the world's largest generics drugmaker, which is facing price erosion in the United States, reported a steeper than expected drop in second-quarter earnings, slashed its dividend by 75 percent and cut its 2017 forecast."
walmart,2017-8,"Teva is saddled with debts amounting to some $35 billion, mostly from financing its $40.5 billion purchase of Actavis -- Allergan's generics business -- last year."
walmart,2017-8,"A loss of confidence in the company's management have led to a nearly 50 percent drop in Teva's shares since Aug. 3, while losses are about 75 percent since the start of 2016."
walmart,2017-8,"Investors say Teva paid too much for Actavis, prompting Chief Executive Erz Vigodman's resignation in February and his temporary replacement by Chairman Yitzhak Peterburg, while Chief Financial Officer Eyal Desheh resigned at the end of June, again with only an interim stand-in. [nL8N1HY60K]"
walmart,2017-8,"""People have lost faith in Teva not for what happened, but we don't see where its going,"" Eldad Tamir, head of the Tamir Fishman Investment House, said."
walmart,2017-8,"In addition to seeking partners, Teva is responding by speeding up plans to divest non-core assets, the sources said, with long-term decisions including a possible break-up into two companies, generics and specialty drugs, only likely to be discussed after it fills its leadership vacuum."
walmart,2017-8,"Morgan Stanley and Bank of America have been asked to find buyers for Teva's women's health business and European oncology and pain unit, respectively."
walmart,2017-8,"Industry players including U.S. generic drugmaker Mylan , German healthcare group Fresenius and Indian drug firm Intas Pharmaceuticals are all carrying out due diligence on the assets, which could be worth about $2 billion combined, the sources said."
walmart,2017-8,"A source familiar with the divestments said that India's Intas, which last year bought the generics business of Actavis in the UK and Ireland from Teva, is now bidding for specific assets within the women's health unit, adding Teva is open to a break-up to speed up the sale."
walmart,2017-8,"This means the business could be sold in two or three chunks with its U.S. and international operations being chopped and some products like contraceptive drugs Plan B and Paragard being carved out and sold separately, the sources said."
walmart,2017-8,"The oncology business could also be broken up as industry players are mainly interested in pure cancer drugs while pain treatment medicine, which is being offered as part of the same deal, is seen as less attractive, the sources said."
walmart,2017-8,"The prospect of a piecemeal deal has drawn interest from private equity funds including Advent and TPG, the sources said."
walmart,2017-8,"Fresenius, Mylan, Advent and TPG declined to comment while Intas was not immediately available for comment."
walmart,2017-8,"Teva is also considering options for its respiratory treatments business as part of a review of its entire portfolio, the sources said."
walmart,2017-8,"It recently decided to part ways with Iceland-based Medis, a supplier of development work to third-party drugmakers, which one source said could fetch about $500 million."
walmart,2017-8,"Some banks have suggested a possible sale of PGT Healthcare, a consumer care products joint venture with Procter & Gamble , but Teva's spokeswoman Bradley said this remains core."
walmart,2017-8,Some shareholders have called on Teva to either split into two or sell off its generics business completely.
walmart,2017-8,"Pressure is mounting on the U.S. generic drug industry because pharmacy groups, including Wal-Mart Stores Inc and Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc , are wielding more leverage when buying such drugs.[nL1N1KP28X]"
walmart,2017-8,"""Teva should get out of generics. It means splitting the company of course, selling the generics in pieces and focusing on specialty drugs,"" Benny Landa, an entrepreneur who in 2014 led an investor bid to shake up Teva's board, said."
walmart,2017-8,"Teva should become more like research-focused Novartis and its generics unit Sandoz, which are run as two separate firms, he added."
walmart,2017-8,But such changes could be slowed by Teva's articles of association. These were designed to prevent a hostile takeover and include provisions that limit the number of board members to be replaced per year to a third of all seats.
walmart,2017-8,"Teva's problems also stem in large part from its specialty business. Its blockbuster multiple sclerosis drug Copaxone had contributed much of Teva's revenue and profit, but its patent has run out and now is facing generic competition."
walmart,2017-8,"Teva had no other drugs to take its place, although it has a pipeline of 21 specialty medicines for migraine, pain, respiratory and neurology in various stages of development, from early stage clinical trials to drugs already registered and awaiting regulatory approval."
walmart,2017-8,"In April, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Teva's drug to treat chorea stemming from Huntington's disease, a fatal degenerative disorder. The drug is expected to produce sales of $850 million by 2023. [nL3N1HB571]"
walmart,2017-8,"And another experimental drug to prevent migraines, called Fremanezumab, had positive results in a Phase III study in June and is now waiting to be cleared by U.S. regulators ahead of a possible launch in the second half of 2018."

walmart,2017-8,"{{20170809T174550.886+0000}}REFILE-In tough retail landscape, Payless emerges as rare bankruptcy survivor(Fixes attorney's name in 8th paragraph)"
walmart,2017-8,"CHICAGO, Aug 9 (Reuters) - Payless ShoeSource is set to emerge from bankruptcy as soon as Wednesday, one of the largest retail chains to do so, and is banking on a strategy focused primarily on bricks-and-mortar sales at a time when e-commerce is casting an ever-growing footprint on retail sales."
walmart,2017-8,Payless' emergence essentially gives the company a do-over after disposing of half of $847 million of debt it had built up under its private-equity ownership.
walmart,2017-8,"With a cleaned-up balance sheet, Payless is seeking to position itself to compete in a tight U.S. market, open more stores across Latin America - a major part of its growth strategy - and develop new franchises in Asia. The company did not respond to requests for comment on whether its chief executive, Paul Jones, will stay on board to lead the turnaround effort."
walmart,2017-8,"Payless' focus on bricks and mortar comes in a year of record U.S. store closings and a string of bankruptcies among retail brands, including The Limited, hhgregg, RadioShack and Gymboree. But it also occurs just weeks after Amazon.com announced plans to purchase Whole Foods Market Inc , a move that has prompted some retailers and analysts to take fresh looks at how conventional retailing can co-exist in the face of e-commerce competition."
walmart,2017-8,"Payless has closed roughly 700 mostly mall-based U.S. stores in bankruptcy, court papers show, but is opening four mega stores here to add to some 3,200 post-bankruptcy locations in the U.S. and abroad. It plans to invest $234 million over five years, including on systems that will adjust inventory quickly in response to customer demand and improve its competitiveness on line, according to court filings and interviews with company representatives."
walmart,2017-8,"But for now, the company believes a strategy heavy on in-store sales can withstand the onslaught of e-commerce. Payless does not disclose what percent of sales it gets online. Designer-brand retailer DSW Inc last year brought in nearly 16 percent of its revenue online, and Caleres Inc, parent of discounter Famous Footwear and other brands, brought in 5.2 percent of its sales online, according to research firm eMarketer."
walmart,2017-8,"The Payless model is built on core loyal customers: budget-conscious mothers who still flock to stores with their children to find a perfect fit for under $30 during four key selling seasons, including Easter dress shoes, summer sandals, back-to-school, and winter boots, court papers show."
walmart,2017-8,"""There's an extremely loyal Payless customer, who is basically a mother, who knows she can go into a store at any time and find a quality product at a reasonable price,"" said Payless' lead restructuring lawyer, Nicole Greenblatt of Kirkland & Ellis."
walmart,2017-8,The emergence from bankruptcy gives Payless a relatively clean balance sheet and better terms on leases and vendor contracts worldwide.
walmart,2017-8,"Retail restructuring expert Christopher Jarvinen of law firm Berger Singerman said the company has a business plan with a future. ""It's the antithesis of what we've seen in other retail bankruptcies,"" he said."
walmart,2017-8,"Landlords reduced rent by an average 30 percent to 50 percent and vendors extended trade credit by 60 to 75 days, according to sources with knowledge of the matter who declined to be named because the individual contracts are confidential."
walmart,2017-8,"The company's Latin America operation potentially can provide cash flow to give Payless room for error. Latin America contributed nearly 40 percent of the company's $95 million in EBITDA in 2016, even though it accounts for less than 10 percent of its global store footprint, and sales in the region are growing."
walmart,2017-8,"Payless, with 400 stores in the region, this year plans to add 22 locations across Peru, the Dominican Republic, Costa Rica, Honduras, and Nicaragua. It plans to open more stores and enter new Latin American countries in 2018, a spokeswoman said."
walmart,2017-8,"""My major concern is whether Latin America can really cover any unforeseen decline in margins in the U.S,"" said consultancy Michel-Shaked Group's managing director Israel Shaked, who was hired by the official unsecured creditors' committee to analyze the company's accounts."
walmart,2017-8,"The company's troubled past and the competitive retail environment still will leave little wiggle room for negative surprises, turnaround specialists said."
walmart,2017-8,"While Payless has halved its debt during bankruptcy, $280 million of new term loans carry yields between 7 percent and 9 percent, broadly in line with other distressed retailers but above average term loan yields of 3.6 percent, according to Thomson Reuters LPC data."
walmart,2017-8,"Payless must find a way to differentiate itself from Wal-Mart Stores Inc , Target Corp and Kohls Corp , all of which also operate in the under $30 footwear category."
walmart,2017-8,"""There aren't that many other specialty shoe stores, but there are dozens of other retail chains that sell shoes, and they have taken much of that business a little at a time,"" said John Yozzo, managing director of FTI Consulting."

walmart,2017-8,Aug 7 (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc has settled a lawsuit by two insurers that sought to avoid covering its multi-million-dollar payout to comedian Tracy Morgan for injuries he suffered in a 2014 crash involving one of the retailer's trucks.
walmart,2017-8,"U.S. District Judge Freda Wolfson in Trenton, New Jersey, on Monday ordered the dismissal of all claims against Wal-Mart by Ohio Casualty Insurance and Liberty Insurance Underwriters, and all counterclaims by Wal-Mart against the insurers."
walmart,2017-8,"Terms of the settlement are confidential, and both sides agreed not to bring their claims again."
walmart,2017-8,"""We are pleased to have resolved this matter,"" Wal-Mart spokesman Randy Hargrove said in an email."
walmart,2017-8,"The accord came 2-1/2 months after the insurers, both affiliated with Liberty Mutual Group, had sought permission to question Morgan and another injured passenger, Ardley Fuqua, to help them determine whether Wal-Mart paid too much."
walmart,2017-8,"Lawyers for the insurers and Boston-based Liberty Mutual did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A lawyer for Morgan and Fuqua referred a reporter to an outside spokesman, who had no immediate comment."
walmart,2017-8,"Morgan, a former star of ""Saturday Night Live"" and ""30 Rock,"" was seriously injured on June 7, 2014 when a Wal-Mart truck crashed into his limousine van on the New Jersey Turnpike."
walmart,2017-8,"His friend, comedian James McNair, was killed in the crash, and other passengers also suffered injuries."
walmart,2017-8,"The truck driver had been awake for more than 24 hours when the crash occurred. He pleaded guilty last November to vehicular homicide under a plea agreement that let him avoid prison time, according to published reports."
walmart,2017-8,"Wal-Mart's payouts to Morgan and Fuqua have not been disclosed, but court documents suggest that the Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer might have paid more than $90 million."
walmart,2017-8,"That was based on a reported $10 million settlement that Wal-Mart reached in early 2015 with McNair's children, and subsequent court papers saying that more than 90 percent of Wal-Mart's total payout were for Morgan's and Fuqua's claims."
walmart,2017-8,"Morgan suffered a broken leg and ribs and what his lawyer has called a ""traumatic brain injury"" in the crash. He has since returned to performing."

walmart,2017-8,"JERUSALEM, Aug 3 (Reuters) - Teva Pharmaceutical Industries said it was facing accelerating price erosion in the United States, hurting he Israeli drugmaker's profits and driving down its U.S. shares more than 20 percent."
walmart,2017-8,The company said its U.S. customers have been consolidating and negotiating lower prices for generic drugs. It said a deal it reached with a group consisting of drug distributor McKesson Corp and Wal-Mart Stores Inc hit its bottom line particularly hard during the second quarter.
walmart,2017-8,"The world's largest generics drugmaker posted a steeper than expected drop in its second-quarter earnings, slashed its dividend by 75 percent and cut its 2017 forecast."
walmart,2017-8,"Teva officials offered little in the way of hope for a turnaround on a conference call with analysts, saying the company expects the fall in U.S. generic drug prices to accelerate in the second half of 2017 and into 2018."
walmart,2017-8,"""The board understands our shareholders' disappointments,"" said Chairman Sol Barer. ""We understand that significant change is required and we all have a sense of urgency."""
walmart,2017-8,"Shares in Teva, which is currently without a permanent chief executive, tumbled 18 percent in Tel Aviv. Its New York stock was equally weak, down 24 percent at $23.86 in afternoon trade - the lowest level since 2004. Shares in other drugmakers, including Mylan and Impax , also fell on fears of a worsening market for generic medicines. [nL4N1KP4DB]"
walmart,2017-8,"""We think it would be unwise for investors to think that buying groups flexed their muscle in 2017 and now are done,"" Wells Fargo analyst David Maris said in a research note. ""We think there have been structural changes in the industry that may make the 25 percent plus operating margins the sector has seen a thing of the past."""
walmart,2017-8,"Barer was asked when Teva would announce a new CEO, Erez Vigodman having stepped down in February after a series of missteps, but did not offer a timetable. He said there would be no rush and the right candidate must have ""significant CEO level experience at major pharmaceutical companies""."
walmart,2017-8,"Teva has had meetings with a number of candidates, Barer noted. ""We have made significant progress and it has been positive so far,"" he said, also deflecting questions from analysts on the prospects of splitting the company into two, comprising generics and specialty drugs."
walmart,2017-8,"Teva's chief financial officer has also stepped down, leaving it up to new management to restore investor confidence."
walmart,2017-8,"AstraZeneca CEO Pascal Soriot had been named by Israeli media as a likely to successor to Vigodman but the boss of the British drugmaker, which faces its own challenges, said last week he was not a ""quitter"". [nL5N1KI1ZJ]"
walmart,2017-8,"Teva said it earned $1.02 per share excluding one-off items in the second quarter, down from $1.25 a share in the same period last year. Revenue rose 13 percent to $5.7 billion on lower prices in the United States and drug launch delays."
walmart,2017-8,"It cut the quarterly dividend payout to $0.085 per ordinary share from $0.34, a move Teva officials said was needed to help pay down $5 billion of debt this year and invest in its business."
walmart,2017-8,"Teva, which bought Allergan's generics business for $40.5 billion in August, was expected by analysts to have earned $1.06 per share on revenue of $5.72 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S Estimates. Synergies and cost cuts from the merger are expected to reach $1.6 billion in 2017, it said."
walmart,2017-8,"""By end of 2017, will have reduced our head count by about 7,000 people since the closing of Actavis (Allergan) generic deal. That's about 2,000 above our initial plan,"" said acting CEO Yitzhak Peterburg, adding that 15 plants will be closed or divested by the end of 2018."
walmart,2017-8,Global sales of Teva's best-selling multiple sclerosis drug Copaxone - down to 18 percent of revenue from 23 percent last year - fell 10 percent in the quarter to $1.02 billion.
walmart,2017-8,"As a result the company has cut its full-year earnings forecast to $4.30-$4.50 a share from $4.90-$5.30 previously on revenues now expected to total $22.8-$23.2 billion, down from its previous forecast of $23.8 billion-$24.5 billion."
walmart,2017-8,"""This adjusted outlook takes into consideration the impact of increased price erosion in our U.S. generics business, which is expected to be in a high single-digits rate through the remainder of the year, and delays in generic launches in the U.S.,"" Teva said."
walmart,2017-8,"It added that the outlook for the business also reflected the continued deterioration in political and economic conditions in Venezuela, but it assumed no generic competition to its Copaxone 40mg version in the United States in 2017."
walmart,2017-8,Teva said that at least one Copaxone 40mg competitor would impact the bottom line by 20 to 25 cents.
walmart,2017-8,Earlier the company also said it would continue to pursue a breach of contract suit against the former owners of its Rimsa plant in Mexico after a New York judge rejected Teva's claim of fraud. [nL5N1KP2YQ]

walmart,2017-8,"{{20170801T231828.008+0000}}UPDATE 4-Apple shares sail to record high on healthy iPhone sales(Adds comments about China, analyst comments)"
walmart,2017-8,"Aug 1 (Reuters) - Apple Inc on Tuesday delivered surprisingly strong fiscal third-quarter earnings and signaled that its upcoming 10th-anniversary phone lineup is on schedule, driving the stock up 6 percent to an all-time high in after-hours trading."
walmart,2017-8,"The stock climbed above its intraday record high to $159.10 after the company reported better-than-expected iPhone sales, revenue and earnings per share. The stock price move was expected to help drive the Dow Jones Industrial Average over the 22,000 mark on Wednesday."
walmart,2017-8,Apple also said it hit a milestone of 1.2 billion iPhones sold.
walmart,2017-8,The April-June quarter is traditionally a soft one for Apple as the market waits for the September launch of new iPhone models. But Tuesday's results show that iPhone buyers may be less inclined than they once were to delay purchases until a new model is out.
walmart,2017-8,"The iPad product lines also showed unexpected strength, service revenue continues to grow at a healthy clip, and even the much-maligned Apple Watch showed a 50 percent sales increase."
walmart,2017-8,"Apple is widely tipped to adopt higher-resolution OLED displays for the latest iPhone, along with better touchscreen technology and wireless charging - which could come with a $1,000 plus price tag."
walmart,2017-8,"The company forecast total revenue of between $49 billion and $52 billion for the current fourth quarter, while analysts on average were expecting $49.21 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S."
walmart,2017-8,Apple's fourth quarter generally includes first-weekend sales of the company's latest devices.
walmart,2017-8,"The forecast ""makes it fairly certain that at least some new iPhone models will be released on the normal schedule,"" said analyst Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research. ""That doesn't necessarily mean all new models will go on sale then, or that they'll all be in abundant supply, but I would think it means that at the very least the successors to the current phones will be available."""
walmart,2017-8,"But Bob O'Donnell, chief analyst at TECHnalysis Research, cautioned that if Apple releases cheaper models before the premium models in its 10th anniversary phone lineup, the cheaper models could dampen sales of more expensive units released closer to the holidays."
walmart,2017-8,"The company said iPhone sales rose 1.6 percent to 41.03 million in the third quarter ended July 1, above analysts' average estimate of 40.7 million units, according to FactSet StreetAccount. Apple sold 40.4 million iPhones a year earlier."
walmart,2017-8,"But a lower average iPhone selling price of $606, well below Wall Street expectations of $621, caused iPhone revenue to come in at $24.8 billion, below expectations of $25.5 billion."
walmart,2017-8,"Apple Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri told Reuters the weak price was partly explained by Apple lowering the flow of inventory by 3.3 million units, which he said were ""entirely at the high end of the range."""
walmart,2017-8,"Apple reports how many phones it sells to retailers, not how many phones it sells to consumers, what is known as a sell-in basis. When factoring how many existing ""high end"" phones the company cleared out of retail inventory, Maestri said average selling prices were higher."
walmart,2017-8,"The company's net income rose to $8.72 billion, or $1.67 per share, from $7.80 billion, or $1.42 per share, a year earlier."
walmart,2017-8,"Revenue rose to $45.41 billion from $42.36 billion in the quarter, typically the company's weakest, beating expectations of $44.89 billion."
walmart,2017-8,"Apple said revenue from emerging markets excluding China grew 18 percent, a bright spot. But sales from the Greater China region fell 9.5 percent to $8 billion in the latest quarter, as consumers switched to newer domestic offerings. [nL4N1KN1G9]"
walmart,2017-8,"The decline was smaller than recent quarters. Apple's Maestri said mainland China revenue was flat, as were iPhone sales in the mainland. Sales of other Apple products rose in mainland China and were also up in Taiwan."
walmart,2017-8,"""The decline from a market standpoint was concentrated in Hong Kong, which is a place that has been really affected by a reduction in tourism because the Hong Kong Dollar is pegged to the U.S. dollar,"" Maestri said."
walmart,2017-8,Apple CEO Tim Cook also directly addressed the company's decision to remove so-called VPN apps from the App Store in China. Those apps help Chinese users circumnavigate government internet restrictions.
walmart,2017-8,"""We would obviously rather not remove the apps, but like we do in other countries we follow the law wherever we do business,"" Cook said. ""We believe in engaging with governments even when we disagree. This particular case, we're hopeful that over time the restrictions we're seeing are lessened, because innovation really requires freedom to collaborate and communicate."""
walmart,2017-8,"Strong iPad sales of $4.9 billion - almost $1 billion above Wall Street expectations - and a 21.6 percent jump in the company's services business that includes the App Store also helped boost revenue. In particular, Apple said that Walmart Stores Inc would buy 19,000 iPads to train as many as 225,000 employees. The company also said it increased production of AirPods, its wireless headphones."
walmart,2017-8,"Apple CEO Tim Cook declined to directly address U.S. President Donald Trump's claims that Apple will build three new factories in the U.S., instead citing the company's job creation efforts and a $1 billion U.S. manufacturing fund."
walmart,2017-8,"Cook also hinted that Apple's experiments with self-driving cars may include ambitions that extend beyond cars. He said the company is making a ""big investment"" in autonomous systems."
walmart,2017-8,"""From our point of view, autonomy is sort of the mother of all AI projects,"" Cook said. ""And the autonomous systems can be used in a variety of ways, and a vehicle is only one, but there are many different areas of it. And I don't want to go any further with that."""
