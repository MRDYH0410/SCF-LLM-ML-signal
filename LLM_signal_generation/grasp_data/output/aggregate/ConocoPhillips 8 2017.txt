ConocoPhillips,2017-8,{{20170829T103015.439+0000}}UPDATE 2-Norway's Arctic oil ambitions suffer setback as most promising well yields none* Korpfjell well yields non-commercial amounts of gas
ConocoPhillips,2017-8,"OSLO, Aug 29 (Reuters) - Norway's hope of discovering a large oilfield in the Barents Sea has suffered a major setback after the far north Arctic's most promising reservoir turned out to contain only small amounts of natural gas."
ConocoPhillips,2017-8,"Statoil , the country's top oil and gas producer, has stepped up drilling in the Barents Sea this year as the government seeks to attract more explorers to its Arctic waters to make up for declining North Sea output."
ConocoPhillips,2017-8,But Statoil said on Tuesday that after drilling the northernmost exploration well in the highly anticipated Korpfjell prospect it had found only non-commercial quantities of gas and no oil.
ConocoPhillips,2017-8,"Korpfjell was the first exploration well drilled in the Norwegian section of a formerly disputed area between Norway and Russia, where Statoil and its partners had hoped to make a major discovery. [nL5N1KT1AC]"
ConocoPhillips,2017-8,"""The results are of course disappointing, but it is too early to draw any conclusions on how this will impact the Barents Sea southeast area,"" Jez Averty, Statoil's head of exploration in Norway and UK, said."
ConocoPhillips,2017-8,"Statoil, which is majority government-owned, had ranked the Korpfjell well as ""high-impact"", meaning that it could contain upwards of 250 million barrels of oil equivalents (boe) gross or 100 million boe for Statoil alone, while its partner Lundin Petroleum had said it could hold more than a billion barrels."
ConocoPhillips,2017-8,"Statoil, however, said that the discovery made at Korfpjell is estimated to contain just 40-75 million boe or 6-12 billion standard cubic metres of gas, not large enough for commercial development."
ConocoPhillips,2017-8,"Averty said Statoil needed to explore the area more, and planned a second Korpfjell well in 2018. Lundin also said it would continue to explore in the area."
ConocoPhillips,2017-8,"The failure to make significant discoveries is also disappointing for Norway's right-wing government, which has sought to expand the petroleum industry in the Arctic region as production from the North Sea's mature areas is set to decline from the mid-2020s."
ConocoPhillips,2017-8,"In April, Norway's oil industry regulator doubled its forecast for potential Barents Sea discoveries."
ConocoPhillips,2017-8,"That alarmed green groups, which oppose Arctic drilling, and Greenpeace activists tried to stop drilling of the Korpfjell well earlier this month.[nL8N1L35W0] [nL8N1HX1QR]"
ConocoPhillips,2017-8,"Korpfjell was the fourth of Statoil's five planned exploration wells in the Barents Sea this summer, and the third that failed to prove commercial volumes."
ConocoPhillips,2017-8,"Statoil's fourth exploration well drilled this year, known as Kayak, made a small oil discovery, which could be potentially tied in to the larger Johan Castberg field development."
ConocoPhillips,2017-8,"News of the disappointing drilling results from Korpfjell sent Statoil shares down 1.9 percent by 0849 GMT, while shares of Lundin Petroleum tumbled 7 percent. Other partners in the Korpfjell license are Chevron , ConocoPhillips and state-owned Petoro."
ConocoPhillips,2017-8,"""Gas is almost impossible to commercialize in these remote areas, and if the eastern Barents Sea is gas prone, it will have limited value potential,"" analysts at brokers DNB said in note. They cut their target for Lundin's share price by 4 crowns to 196 Swedish crowns ($24.76) on Tuesday."
ConocoPhillips,2017-8,"Teodor Sveen-Nilsen, an analyst at Sparebank 1 Markets, said the results so far were slightly disappointing, but not disastrous."
ConocoPhillips,2017-8,"""If more wells to be drilled in 2018 turn to be dry, then it would be really bad,"" he added."

ConocoPhillips,2017-8,"LAUNCESTON, Australia, Aug 28 (Reuters) - Hurricane Harvey may achieve in global crude oil markets in a few days what OPEC and its allies have struggled to achieve in months - a tightening of supplies and a rise in prices."
ConocoPhillips,2017-8,"Harvey, which has been downgraded to a tropical storm, hit the coast of Texas on Friday as the most powerful hurricane to hit the U.S. state in more than 50 years, causing widespread damage and flooding. [nL2N1LD06K]"
ConocoPhillips,2017-8,The region where the storm struck is home to some 2.2 million barrels per day (bpd) of refining capacity as well as being a major shipment point for both imports and exports of crude oil and fuel products.[nL2N1LD0FS]
ConocoPhillips,2017-8,"The refining capacity that has been idled because of the storm is about 11.2 percent of the U.S. total, and the immediate impact is being felt in gasoline prices."
ConocoPhillips,2017-8,Benchmark U.S. gasoline futures jumped as much as 6.8 percent in early trade on Monday in Asia to touch $1.7799 a gallon.
ConocoPhillips,2017-8,"Brent crude , the global oil benchmark, rose as much as 0.8 percent in early Asian trade, reaching as high as $52.84 a barrel."
ConocoPhillips,2017-8,"So far, this would imply the crude market is fairly relaxed about the impact of Harvey, but it's possible the effect of the storm will travel far beyond U.S. gasoline prices, given the United States' status as an emerging power in crude and refined product exports."
ConocoPhillips,2017-8,It has been U.S. shale oil output that has largely frustrated efforts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and their allies to drive crude prices higher this year by restricting their own production.
ConocoPhillips,2017-8,"While much of the offshore crude production in the Gulf of Mexico was shut in ahead of Harvey's passage, the yet to be quantified damage from the storm may lie with the onshore, shale oil output that was in the storm's path."
ConocoPhillips,2017-8,The Eagle Ford shale basin lies in the path of the storm and producers in the region have idled production.
ConocoPhillips,2017-8,"Among those oil companies that have halted operations in the Eagle Ford are ConocoPhillips, which produced 161,000 bpd of oil equivalent at the end of 2016 in the region, BHP Billiton with 99,000 bpd and Murphy Oil with 46,000 bpd, according to a report from S&P Global Platts."
ConocoPhillips,2017-8,"The risk is that this onshore production takes longer to return than the market may expect, given the apparent widespread damage to infrastructure from flooding in the region and the length of time it may take floodwaters to recede."
ConocoPhillips,2017-8,"If this is the case, customers for U.S. crude and product exports may well find themselves scrambling to line up replacement cargoes."
ConocoPhillips,2017-8,The fallout from Harvey won't just be limited to the United States and close neighbours.
ConocoPhillips,2017-8,"China imported about 130,000 bpd from the United States in the first seven months of the year, including some 174,000 bpd in July, making it the 15th biggest supplier to the world's top crude buyer, according to customs data."
ConocoPhillips,2017-8,"The United States has been exporting around 1 million bpd of crude in recent months, and while not all of this will be affected by Harvey, as much as three-quarters of this is shipped from the U.S. Gulf Coast region."
ConocoPhillips,2017-8,"It's not only U.S. exports of crude that will be affected, the region is also a hub for imports."
ConocoPhillips,2017-8,"This means that trade flows will be disrupted, with some cargoes likely to be diverted."
ConocoPhillips,2017-8,"Overall, this makes it more likely that prices will rise in the short term as suppliers of crude to the U.S. Gulf Coast seek new buyers, and buyers of U.S. crude seek new supplies."
ConocoPhillips,2017-8,"It's also likely that the spread between various crude grades will be affected, as the U.S. mainly exports light crude but imports heavier grades."
ConocoPhillips,2017-8,"A loss of U.S. exports of light crude may stoke demand for similar grades from suppliers such as Angola and Nigeria, while shippers of heavier crudes may have to offer discounts if cargoes headed for the United States have to be diverted."
ConocoPhillips,2017-8,"While Harvey may have a short-term impact on global crude and product markets, the question is how quickly U.S. production and exports return to normal."
ConocoPhillips,2017-8,"Even assuming it takes no more than a few weeks, Harvey's impact may be somewhat longer lasting."
ConocoPhillips,2017-8,"In effect the storm has given OPEC and its allies, such as Russia, some breathing space."
ConocoPhillips,2017-8,"It does appear that Saudi Arabia, OPEC's leading producer, is shipping less crude as it works to translate production cuts into lower exports."
ConocoPhillips,2017-8,"If other producers can follow suit in the next couple of months, it's possible that any tightness caused by the impact of the hurricane can simply be extended, leading to a sustained price rally."

ConocoPhillips,2017-8,"LONDON, Aug 22 (Reuters) - French oil major Total has overtaken rival Royal Dutch Shell to become the second-largest producer in the North Sea with its acquisition of Maersk's Norwegian and UK producing assets."
ConocoPhillips,2017-8,"The $7.45 billion deal by Total was welcomed by the market, with analysts saying it helped the French company rebalance its portfolio by adding assets in developed countries after going for projects in riskier places such as Iran and Russia. [nL8N1L70XF]"
ConocoPhillips,2017-8,"The deal boosts the share of eight global oil majors in the North Sea - Statoil, Total, Shell, Exxon Mobil , Conoco , ENI and Chevron - to back above three quarters of total output."
ConocoPhillips,2017-8,Several oil majors have been actively looking to divest fields in the North Sea - one of the most mature global oil provinces where future developments will be complicated by high decommissioning costs of old infrastructure.
ConocoPhillips,2017-8,"Some assets have been bought by private equity firms which have expanded significantly in the region, with companies such as Chrysaor and Siccar acquiring fields from Shell, Austria's OMV and France's Engie. [nL8N1ID244] [nL5N1FL1B4] [nL8N1D976X]"
ConocoPhillips,2017-8,"But despite around $10 billion worth of deals in the North Sea over the past two years, private equity firms remain fairly small players with their total share still below 10 percent."
ConocoPhillips,2017-8,"On Tuesday, UBS analysts upgraded Total to ""Buy"" from ""Neutral"" after the Maersk deal, saying Total bought the assets at an average price of $7.3 per barrel of oil resources, implying a long-term Brent price of $62 per barrel."
ConocoPhillips,2017-8,"""In the context of a global asset market dominated by U.S. unconventional and Canadian oil sands transactions this year, a conventional offshore deal stands out as an anomaly,"" UBS said."
ConocoPhillips,2017-8,It said that opportunities for inorganic growth in the North Sea were beginning to diminish because EU utilities have fully divested of the upstream sector while oil majors have also largely sold out their non-core portfolios.
ConocoPhillips,2017-8,"""The sale of another North Sea focused portfolio that was on the market, combined with Total's clear commitment to the basin, emphasises that competition for assets could remain high in spite of depressed oil prices,"" UBS said."

ConocoPhillips,2017-8,"{{20170817T122922.895+0000}}Conoco to start dismantling historical Norwegian oil platformOSLO, Aug 17 (Reuters) - ConocoPhillips has won permission to prepare for the removal of the first permanent oil platform built off Norway more than 40 years ago, the country's industry regulator said on Thursday."
ConocoPhillips,2017-8,"The U.S. company applied in July to remove Ekofisk 2/4 A, which started producing oil from the North Sea in 1974 and shut permanently in 2013."
ConocoPhillips,2017-8,"Production at the Ekofisk field began in 1971 from the Gulftide jack-up rig, a temporary installation standing on removable legs. Gulftide was replaced with production platforms permanently fixed to the seabed in 1974."
ConocoPhillips,2017-8,"Discovered in 1969, Ekofisk was the first oilfield to begin production off Norway, kickstarting a period of unprecedented wealth for the nation of 5 million inhabitants."
ConocoPhillips,2017-8,"While the field's oldest installations are being removed, new equipment was put in place and production is ongoing, with the field expected to continue pumping oil towards 2050."
ConocoPhillips,2017-8,The Norwegian Petroleum Safety Authority said it had granted consent for ConocoPhillips to prepare for the removal of 2/4 A and three other installations.
ConocoPhillips,2017-8,"With the exception of some smaller parts, the actual removal will depend on a later permit, it added."
ConocoPhillips,2017-8,ConocoPhillips plans to start preparations in the fourth quarter of this year.
ConocoPhillips,2017-8,"The removal plans also include two accommodation platforms, Ekofisk 2/4 H and Ekofisk 2/4 Q, and a riser platform called Ekofisk 2/4 FTP."
ConocoPhillips,2017-8,"Dutch company Heerema was awarded the removal contract, and all four platforms will eventually be taken to AF Decom yard at Vats on Norway's western coast for dismantling and steel recycling, a spokesman for ConocoPhillips said."
ConocoPhillips,2017-8,"Operator ConocoPhillips has a 35 percent stake in Ekofisk, France's Total has almost 40 percent, Italy's Eni has 12.4 percent, Norway's Statoil has 8 percent and Norwegian state-owned Petoro has 5 percent."

ConocoPhillips,2017-8,"{{20170807T150013.979+0000}}After a few disappointments, Statoil to drill biggest Arctic hopeOSLO, Aug 7 (Reuters) - Norway's Statoil will soon start drilling this season's most promising Arctic prospect, Korpfjell, after several disappointing wells in the Barents Sea, the company said on Monday."
ConocoPhillips,2017-8,The majority state-owned company has stepped up drilling in the Barents Sea this year as the government seeks to attract more explorers to its Arctic waters to make up for declining North Sea output. [nO9N1HC00G]
ConocoPhillips,2017-8,"The Norwegian Petroleum Directorate said on Monday Statoil's latest well in the Barents Sea, Gemini North, had found only minor volumes of gas and oil. [nEON161UH4]"
ConocoPhillips,2017-8,"""The well was drilled with the ambition of proving up additional oil resources in the vicinity of the Wisting discovery, but like the previous Blaamann well, we discovered gas,"" said Jez Averty, senior vice president for exploration in Norway and the UK."
ConocoPhillips,2017-8,"The Kayak well drilled in June proved to have between 25 and 50 million barrels of oil, too small for a stand-alone development. [nO9N1CA03I]"
ConocoPhillips,2017-8,"Statoil said on Monday it would next drill the Korpfjell prospect near the Russian border, more than 400 kilometres away from the mainland."
ConocoPhillips,2017-8,"""(Statoil's) drilling campaign wasn't a huge success so far, but Korpfjell is the most important well out of the five planned this year in the Barents Sea,"" Teodor Sveen-Nilsen, an analyst at Sparebank1 Markets, said."
ConocoPhillips,2017-8,"Statoil described Korpfjell as a high-impact well, meaning it could provide a total of more than 250 million barrels of oil equivalent (boe) or 100 million boe net for Statoil."
ConocoPhillips,2017-8,"Sweden's Lundin Petroleum , Statoil's partner in the license, estimates Korpfjell could hold more than 1 billion boe, based on seismic surveys."
