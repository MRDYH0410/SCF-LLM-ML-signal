tesla,2017-5,Tesla responded to the report by saying its accident rate in the first quarter of 2017 was 32 percent better than the industry average.
tesla,2017-5,"""We may have had some challenges in the past as we were learning how to become a car company, but what matters is the future and with the changes we've made, we now have the lowest injury rate in the industry by far,"" said Tesla in a statement."
tesla,2017-5,"One change was adding a third shift, which Tesla said led to a 30 percent drop in recordable incidents in the first quarter of 2017 from a year earlier."
tesla,2017-5,Worksafe said the first-quarter data was preliminary and not enough to show a trend.
tesla,2017-5,"The UAW, which put the report on the front page of its website, declined comment."
tesla,2017-5,"The report comes at a critical time for the Silicon Valley luxury carmaker, which is preparing to launch its Model 3 sedan, hiring and ramping up its factory for a six-fold increase in volume next year. [nL1N1HU0BC]"
tesla,2017-5,Worksafe Executive Director Doug Parker told journalists in a briefing that the group met with Tesla factory workers after being approached by the UAW. Worksafe engages in campaigns with unions and other groups.
tesla,2017-5,"The Worksafe analysis of Tesla injury logs sent to California health and safety regulators showed that the carmaker had 8.8 injuries per 100 workers in 2015, 31 percent higher than the U.S. automotive industry mean of 6.7."
tesla,2017-5,"The figure, called a ""total recordable incidence rate"" (TRIR) fell to 8.1 injuries per 100 workers in 2016, for which industry-wide data is not yet available."
tesla,2017-5,"Worksafe also calculated that the rate of serious injuries known as ""days away, restrictions and transfers"" was double the industry rate in 2015 and fell slightly the next year."

tesla,2017-5,* Policy uncertainty is forcing car makers to delay plans in India
tesla,2017-5,"NEW DELHI, May 24 (Reuters) - India's ambitious plan to push electric vehicles at the expense of other technologies could benefit Chinese car makers seeking to enter the market, but is worrying established automakers in the country who have so far focused on making hybrid models."
tesla,2017-5,"India's most influential government think-tank unveiled a policy blueprint this month aimed at electrifying all vehicles in the country by 2032, in a move that is catching the attention of car makers that are already investing in electric technology in China such as BYD <002594.SZ> <1211.HK> and SAIC <600104.SS>."
tesla,2017-5,"The May 12 report by Niti Aayog, the planning body headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, recommends lower taxes and loan interest rates on electric vehicles while capping sales of petrol and diesel cars, seen as a radical shift in policy. [nL4N1I62IM] [nL4N1IE2AL]"
tesla,2017-5,"India also plans to impose higher taxes on hybrid vehicles compared with electric, under a new unified tax regime set to come into effect from July 1, upsetting car makers like Maruti Suzuki and Toyota Motor <7203.T>. [nL4N1IO46G]"
tesla,2017-5,"The prospect of India aggressively promoting electric vehicles was a ""big opportunity"", a source close to SAIC, China's biggest automaker, told Reuters."
tesla,2017-5,"""For a newcomer, this is a good chance to establish a modern, innovative brand image,"" the source said, although they added the company would need more clarity on policy before deciding whether to launch electric vehicles in India."
tesla,2017-5,Earlier this year SAIC set up a local unit called MG Motor which is finalising plans to buy a car manufacturing plant in western India. A spokesman at SAIC did not comment specifically on the company's India plans.
tesla,2017-5,"Warren Buffett-backed BYD already builds electric buses in the country, while rival Chongqing Changan <000625.SZ> has said it may enter India by 2020. [nL3N16U43O]"
tesla,2017-5,"BYD said in a statement the company would have ""a lot more confidence"" to engage in the Indian market if the government supported the proposed policy. The company said it would look at increasing its investment in India but did not give details on how it would expand its business and market share."
tesla,2017-5,"While the Niti Aayog report has not yet been formally adopted, government sources have said it was likely to form the basis of a new green cars policy."
tesla,2017-5,"If so, India would be following similar moves by China, which has been aggressively pushing clean vehicle technologies. But emulating China's success could be tough."
tesla,2017-5,"Electric vehicles are expensive due to high battery costs, and car makers say a lack of charging stations in India could make the whole proposition unviable."
tesla,2017-5,"The proposed policy focuses on electric vehicles, and is likely to also include plug-in hybrids. But it overlooks conventional hybrid models already sold in India, such as Toyota's Camry sedan, Honda Motor's <7267.T> Accord sedan and so-called mild hybrids built by Maruti Suzuki."
tesla,2017-5,"Hybrids combine fossil fuel and electric power, with mild hybrids making less use of the latter."
tesla,2017-5,"In doubling down on electric power India would be shifting away from its previous policy, announced in 2015, that supported hybrid and electric technology."
tesla,2017-5,"That could delay investments in India, expected to be the world's third-largest passenger car market within the next decade, according to industry executives and analysts."
tesla,2017-5,"""All these policy changes will affect future products and investments,"" said Puneet Gupta, South Asia manager at consultant IHS Markit, adding that most car makers would need to rethink product launches, especially of hybrids."
tesla,2017-5,"Mahindra & Mahindra is the only electric car maker in India but has struggled to ramp up sales, blaming low buyer interest and insufficient infrastructure."
tesla,2017-5,"Pawan Goenka, managing director at Mahindra said the company was working with the government and other private players to set up charging stations in India. Mahindra was also focusing on developing electric fleet cars and taxis, Goenka said."
tesla,2017-5,"The cost of setting up a car charging station in India ranges from $500 to $25,000, depending on the charging speed, according to a 2016 report by online journal IOPscience."
tesla,2017-5,"While the proposed policy suggests setting up battery swapping stations and using tax revenues from sales of petrol and diesel vehicles to set up charging stations, it does not specify the investment needed or whether the government would contribute."
tesla,2017-5,"""For full electric vehicles, the economic gap remains huge and the charging infrastructure needed does not exist,"" said a spokesman at Tata Motors . The company makes electric buses and is working on developing electric and hybrid cars."
tesla,2017-5,"Most automakers have focused on bringing in hybrid models that are seen as a stepping stone to electrification. Toyota recently launched its luxury hybrid brand Prius in India, while Hyundai Motor <005380.KS> plans to debut its Ioniq hybrid sedan next year."
tesla,2017-5,"Maruti's parent Suzuki Motor <7269.T>, along with Toshiba <6502.T> and Denso <6902.T>, plans to invest 20 billion yen ($180 million) to set up a lithium ion battery plant in India which would support Maruti's plan to build more hybrids. [nL3N1HM1YW]"
tesla,2017-5,"But the apparent sharp shift in policymakers' thinking in favour of electrification is forcing automakers like Toyota and Nissan Motor <7201.T> to seek more clarity before finalising future products for India, while Hyundai may delay new launches."
tesla,2017-5,"Toyota, the world's No. 2 carmaker by sales, had planned to have a hybrid variant for all its vehicles in India, but the company's future launches would now depend on the new policy, said Shekar Viswanathan, vice chairman of its Indian subsidiary."
tesla,2017-5,"Nissan, which plans to launch a hybrid SUV later this year, said in a statement it was waiting for more clarity before deciding whether to bring electric cars to India."
tesla,2017-5,"A plan by Hyundai to launch at least three hybrid cars in India in 2019-2020 would likely to be delayed, said a source."
tesla,2017-5,"""If the government will be aggressive on electric vehicles and not support other technologies, companies will need to rethink investments,"" said an executive with an Asian carmaker. ($1 = 64.5600 Indian rupees) ($1 = 111.1700 yen)"

tesla,2017-5,"WASHINGTON/DEARBORN, Mich., May 22 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co abruptly named James Hackett as chief executive on Monday, responding to investors' growing unease about the U.S. automaker's slumping stock price and its ability to counter threats from longtime rivals and Silicon Valley."
tesla,2017-5,"Ford Chairman Bill Ford Jr., whose family effectively controls the U.S. No. 2 automaker, said he wanted Hackett to speed up decision-making and cut costs, but did not offer specifics on how the new CEO should change operations."
tesla,2017-5,"Ford, which announced plans to cut 1,400 white-collar positions last week, is expected to look at further significant cost cuts in the next three to six months, according to company officials, speaking on condition of anonymity as the plans have not been finalized."
tesla,2017-5,"Hackett, 62, known as a turnaround expert who for the past year has led the Ford unit developing self-driving cars and related projects, replaces Mark Fields, 56, who spent less than three years as CEO."
tesla,2017-5,"Fields' abrupt dismissal caught nearly all at Ford by surprise, but concerns about the company's direction have been brewing for some time."
tesla,2017-5,"Ford, once the most financially secure of the 'Big Three' Detroit automakers, and the only one not to take U.S. government money in the U.S. auto industry bailout a decade ago, reported record profit in 2015, but now finds itself under pressure on all sides as overall U.S. auto sales fall."
tesla,2017-5,"Rival General Motors Co is aggressively targeting Ford's share of the lucrative North American truck and sport utility business, the source of 90 percent of Ford's profit."
tesla,2017-5,"Meanwhile, investors see Ford as a laggard in the shift toward electric vehicles, self-driving technology and ride-sharing. Ford's $44 billion market value is below electric car pioneer Tesla Inc's $51 billion."
tesla,2017-5,"Bill Ford and other descendants of company founder Henry Ford effectively control the automaker through a special class of shares, but many investors share his concern that the company is running out of time."
tesla,2017-5,"Ford shares closed up 2.1 percent at $11.10. At Friday's close, they had fallen 37 percent since Fields took over three years ago at the peak of the U.S. auto industry's recovery from the crisis last decade."
tesla,2017-5,"The automaker has tangled with U.S. President Donald Trump, who spent more than a year criticizing the company on the campaign trail for expanding operations in Mexico and exporting U.S. jobs. A Ford spokeswoman said Trump was not a factor in Fields' departure."
tesla,2017-5,"Overall U.S. auto sales are slipping after a long boom. But GM has moved faster than Ford to slash unprofitable operations, and Tesla has been quicker to deploy new technology."
tesla,2017-5,"Bill Ford indicated the company would take more aggressive action to cut costs. ""We have to modernize the business"" and move ""decisively to address underperforming areas,"" he said."
tesla,2017-5,"Hackett, who overhauled furniture maker Steelcase Inc and then turned around the ailing University of Michigan football program, becomes the latest in a line of non-family CEOs brought in with a mandate to change the management culture at one of the auto industry's oldest institutions.

tesla,2017-5,"SHANGHAI, May 22 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Ford Motor's many flubs under Mark Fields were becoming existential for the $43 billion carmaker's founding family. Two weeks ago, a majority of those shareholders not named Ford voted to abolish the family's super-voting stock. The Fords took the hint, and the chief executive is now leaving. But naming a 62-year-old from the furniture trade to replace him hints at how unprepared the family was for a revolt."
tesla,2017-5,"That Fields' job was in jeopardy was no secret. The 36 percent decline in Ford shares since he replaced Alan Mulally nearly three years ago was the mathematical manifestation of investors' discontent in his stewardship. Even General Motors only withstood a 10 percent slide, while Fiat Chrysler and Tesla both increased strongly."
tesla,2017-5,"This sparked a last-ditch move by Fields a week ago to cut white-collar workers, potentially irritating jobs-obsessed President Donald Trump, with whom the company clashed over plans to move production of some small cars to Mexico. It backtracked on that decision, in part because of slack demand for those vehicles."
tesla,2017-5,"- Ford Motor Chief Executive Mark Fields is set to leave the carmaker as part of a shake-up that includes other top executive changes as the company's shares hover near a 52-week low, several media reported on May 22."
tesla,2017-5,"- Forbes and the New York Times reported James Hackett, head of the Ford unit that works on autonomous vehicles, would take the reins. An announcement could come as early as Monday."

tesla,2017-5,"May 18 (Reuters) - German automaker Daimler AG will enter the nascent U.S. market for home batteries through a collaboration with residential rooftop solar installer Vivint Solar Inc , the two companies said on Thursday."
tesla,2017-5,"The exclusive partnership, Vivint's first foray into energy storage, will allow the companies to compete against similar offerings from automaker Tesla Inc , solar installer Sunrun Inc , battery maker LG Chem Ltd <051910.KS> and others."
tesla,2017-5,"The market for energy storage is small, but growing rapidly as the costs of lithium-ion batteries fall. Last year the industry generated $320 million in revenue in the United States, though residential systems made up just 4 percent of the total."
tesla,2017-5,"Home battery systems allow customers to store solar power generated during the day for use after sunset, a time when they might charge an electric vehicle. Eventually, as utilities move to charging higher rates for power used in the evening, when demand is greatest, the batteries could bring customers significant savings. They can also provide backup power."
tesla,2017-5,"Daimler will sell the batteries through its Mercedes-Benz Energy subsidiary established last year, bringing its aspirational car brand to the home energy market in much the same way Tesla has with its Powerwall batteries."

tesla,2017-5,"Mercedes-Benz ""will help us both on the home storage as well as the EV charging stations over time,"" Bywater said."
tesla,2017-5,"The energy storage systems will be made up of 2.5 kWh modular batteries that can be combined to create a system as large as 20 kWh. The largest size would cost about $13,000 fully installed, Bywater said."

tesla,2017-5,"NEW YORK, May 17 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co said on Wednesday it plans to cut 1,400 salaried jobs in North America and Asia through voluntary early retirement and other financial incentives as the No. 2 U.S. automaker looks to boost its sagging stock price."
tesla,2017-5,Ford shares fell as much as 2.5 percent in heavy trading and were headed to their worst close since November 2012 as the broader markets tumbled over the political turmoil in Washington.
tesla,2017-5,"The buyout offers were a fraction of the 20,000 job cuts that some news outlets had reported Ford could announce this week."
tesla,2017-5,"Ford said the cuts would amount to about 10 percent of a group of 15,000 managers and other non-production workers and would reduce labor costs for that segment by 10 percent."
tesla,2017-5,"The company said a large group of salaried workers would not be covered by the planned cuts, including those in product development and in the Ford Credit unit. The cuts will not apply to Ford's Europe or South America units."
tesla,2017-5,About two-thirds of the buyout offers are in North America and the rest in Asia. Ford does not plan to cut hourly workers or production.
tesla,2017-5,"The automaker will offer financial incentives, including generous early retirement offers, to encourage salaried employees to depart voluntarily by the end of September. Ford said it expects it will hit the targets through voluntary offers, spokesman Mike Moran said."

tesla,2017-5,"BERLIN, May 17 (Reuters) - Swedish carmaker Volvo's latest generation of diesel engines could be its last as the cost of reducing emissions of nitrogen oxide is becoming too much, Chief Executive Hakan Samuelsson was quoted as saying on Wednesday."
tesla,2017-5,"""From today's perspective, we will not develop any more new generation diesel engines,"" Samuelsson told German's Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung in an interview."
tesla,2017-5,"However, a Volvo Cars spokesman said on Wednesday Samuelsson had been discussing options rather than a firm plan to stop the further development of diesel engines."
tesla,2017-5,"Samuelsson later said in a statement emailed to Reuters he believed diesel would still play a crucial role in the next few years in helping the company meet targets to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide, being more fuel-efficient than petrol engines."

tesla,2017-5,"And until 2020 he said diesel would be needed to help meet carbon dioxide emission limits set by the European Union, but after that other regulations would come into play, with the costs of making engines compliant with ever higher anti-pollution standards meaning it would no longer be worth it."

tesla,2017-5,"""We have to recognise that Tesla has managed to offer such a car for which people are lining up. In this area, there should also be space for us, with high quality and attractive design,"" Samuelsson said."

tesla,2017-5,"May 10 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc on Wednesday began taking orders for its solar roof tiles, a cornerstone of Elon Musk's strategy to sell a fossil-fuel-free lifestyle under the brand name of its luxury electric vehicles."
tesla,2017-5,"Tesla said the product, which generates solar energy without the need for traditional rooftop panels, will be pricier than a conventional roof but will look better and ultimately pay for itself through reduced electricity costs."
tesla,2017-5,"The solar roof tiles were unveiled in October as Musk sought to convince shareholders of the benefits of combining his electric vehicle maker with SolarCity, the solar installer run by his cousins."
tesla,2017-5,"Tesla acquired SolarCity in November, and has been working to remake a money-losing company that was selling traditional solar systems into a premium energy brand. To date, other companies have had little market success with attempts to incorporate solar technology directly into roof tiles. It remains unclear whether the products will appeal to consumers as much as Tesla's electric vehicles do."
tesla,2017-5,"To get in line for a solar roof, homeowners must put down a $1,000 deposit via Tesla's website. There, they can also calculate the estimated upfront cost of a solar roof."
tesla,2017-5,"A 1700-square-foot roof in Southern California, with half the roof covered in ""active"" solar tiles, would cost about $34,300 after a federal tax credit, according to the calculator. Tesla estimates such a roof could generate $76,700 of electricity over 30 years."
tesla,2017-5,The company said its solar roofs would cost between 10 and 15 percent less than an ordinary new roof plus traditional solar panels.
tesla,2017-5,"But Jim Petersen, chief executive of PetersenDean Inc, which installs about 30,000 new roofs plus solar a year, estimated that a 1700-square-foot roof with new solar panels, including the tax credit, would cost about $22,000, well below the Tesla website's estimate. Costs vary depending on roof type."
tesla,2017-5,"Glass tiles will be available in the United States later this year, beginning with gray smooth glass and black textured glass versions, Tesla said. Slate and Tuscan styles will be introduced in 2018. Overseas markets will receive the products next year."
tesla,2017-5,"Tesla said it expects the product to be popular in locations beyond where its SolarCity subsidiary currently operates, and plans to expand installation crews accordingly."
tesla,2017-5,"Tesla will manufacture the tiles at its solar factory in Buffalo, New York. Production will start ""very slowly,"" Musk told reporters on a conference call, adding he expects robust demand."

tesla,2017-5,"May 10 (Reuters) - Sunlight Financial, a startup that provides loans for home solar systems, on Wednesday said it received a $500 million commitment from Technology Credit Union that will finance about 20,000 new rooftop installations."
tesla,2017-5,"The announcement, Sunlight's largest single funding commitment to date, comes as demand for residential solar is slowing in California, by far the industry's biggest market."
tesla,2017-5,"Homeowners signing up for solar panels are increasingly opting to own, rather than lease their systems. Under leases and power purchase agreements, homeowners pay a monthly fee for their solar energy but their systems are owned by either the installer or an investor."
tesla,2017-5,"Leases and PPAs were a major innovation in the solar industry, contributing to rapid growth in recent years. Recently, however, they have lost market share to loans. For the first time since 2011, ownership is expected to outpace leases this year, according to solar market research firm GTM Research."
tesla,2017-5,"""We're seeing increased demand for our product,"" Sunlight Chief Executive Matt Potere said in an interview. ""Homeowners are increasingly shifting from power purchase agreements and leases to loans."""
tesla,2017-5,"Sunlight provides loans for a range of U.S. installers, including Tesla Inc's SolarCity, which pioneered the solar lease but has said it is focusing on cash sales and loans as it prioritizes projects that generate cash upfront."
tesla,2017-5,"Last week, Tesla said 31 percent of its customers chose to purchase their solar systems rather than lease in the first quarter, up from 9 percent a year ago."
tesla,2017-5,"Sunlight offers loans with terms of 10 to 25 years, and in between. Interest rates range from 2.49 percent to 6.99 percent depending on the customer, according to Potere."

tesla,2017-5,"NEW YORK, May 8 (Reuters) - With the U.S. stock market near record highs, hedge fund managers presented ideas that largely depend on rising property values and corporate mergers for growth at a high-profile investment event in New York on Monday."
tesla,2017-5,"The bullish picks on companies ranging from electric car maker Tesla Inc to the Canadian owner of the ""Teletubbies"" children's television show marked a change from last year, when several managers expected slowing global economic growth."
tesla,2017-5,"A late 2016 equities rally left the average hedge fund's returns lagging the broader market, and speakers this year looked eager to make up lost ground."
tesla,2017-5,"Keith Meister, who runs $5.5 billion hedge fund Corvex, revealed the fund's stake in data communications company CenturyLink Inc , which is merging with Level 3 Communications Inc , sending CenturyLink shares up 5 percent."
tesla,2017-5,"Shares in Toronto-listed DHX Media Ltd , which owns rights to popular children's television shows including ""Bob the Builder"" and ""Teletubbies,"" ended up almost 5 percent after Debra Fine, founder and president of Fine Capital Partners, announced her position in the company and pegged its fair value at between C$20 and C$30 per share, more than three times its current market value."
tesla,2017-5,"And billionaire investor William Ackman, who runs $11 billion Pershing Square Capital Management, underscored his bullishness on Howard Hughes Corp , emphasizing the real estate company's attractive land holdings. His fund has owned stock in the company since 2010 and is its largest investor."
tesla,2017-5,"Ackman, the company's board chairman, noted that Howard Hughes' story is not well known and said it will do more to help investors gain insight. Its shares ended up 3.75 percent."
tesla,2017-5,"Some of the few bearish picks came from two noted short-sellers. Jeffrey Gundlach, head of DoubleLine Capital, said that the U.S. benchmark S&P 500 was overvalued, and recommended borrowing money to short the S&P 500 exchange-traded fund (ETF) and hold the iShares Emerging Markets ETF instead."
tesla,2017-5,"David Einhorn, known for shorting Lehman Brothers before the 2008 financial crisis and the Wall Street firm's bankruptcy, announced a short position in oil and gas services company Core Laboratories NV , a company which he said was far more cyclical than the market realizes. Shares in the company ended down 2.4 percent."
tesla,2017-5,"Hedge funds were caught off guard by the surprise Election Day victory of Donald Trump in November, which helped spark a more-than-12-percent rally in the S&P 500 on the prospect of lower taxes and lighter regulation."
tesla,2017-5,"The average hedge fund returned 7.5 percent from the start of May 2016 through March 2017, according to Hedge Fund Research, approximately half the 14.4 percent gain in the benchmark S&P 500 index over the same time."
tesla,2017-5,"While Gundlach last year predicted that Trump would be elected president, this year the presenters concentrated on the markets and steered clear of politics, barely mentioning the president or his proposed legislation, including tax cuts, which are seen to help hedge funds."
tesla,2017-5,"The hedge fund industry had net outflows of $5.4 billion in the first quarter of 2017, according to HFR. That followed $70.1 billion in outflows in 2016, the largest calendar year loss since 2009, as public pension funds in states including New Jersey, New York, Illinois and Rhode Island pulled money from hedge funds."
tesla,2017-5,"Some of the speakers on Monday poked fun at themselves for getting it wrong in a year of so many surprises. Last year Stanley Druckenmiller, one of the industry's best-known macro investors, had urged investors to buy gold because he felt the stock market was overvalued."
tesla,2017-5,"""I suggested get out of equities and buy gold. That's why I'm introducing this year,"" said Druckenmiller, who used to work for George Soros and is now a private investor."

tesla,2017-5,{{20170508T021859.489+0000}}RPT-Australian push may open more doors for batteries on power grids(Repeats item with no change to text)
tesla,2017-5,"MELBOURNE, May 7 (Reuters) - Battery makers worldwide are watching to see whether Australia's most wind power-dependent state can keep the lights on by installing grid-scale batteries by December, which could help drive the growth of renewable energy across Australia and Asia."
tesla,2017-5,A decade-long political stalemate in Australia over energy and climate policy has effectively led to power and gas shortages and soaring energy prices threatening industry and households.
tesla,2017-5,"If batteries help solve Australia's problems by storing surplus electricity generated by wind and solar power, countries like Indonesia, the Philippines and Chile, could follow suit."
tesla,2017-5,"""I call South Australia the 'perfect storm' opportunity for energy storage,"" said Ismario Gonzalez, global sales director for AES Energy Storage, an arm of U.S. firm AES Corp , which has installed or is working on battery projects in seven countries, including Australia."
tesla,2017-5,"The more dependent the grid is on intermittent sources like wind and solar, the more flexible the back-up sources need to be. That's the appeal of battery storage. It can be switched on and off easily, responding faster than a gas peaking plant."
tesla,2017-5,"The state of South Australia, where wind and rooftop solar make up 44 percent of power sources, urgently needs to install big batteries after suffering blackouts over the past year."
tesla,2017-5,"It has little back-up as coal-fired power plants in the state have shut due to the rapid expansion of renewable energy. That has made it more dependent on power from neighbouring Victoria, its only link to Australia's national electricity market."
tesla,2017-5,"The state government plans to spend A$150 million ($115 million) supporting the installation of 100 megawatt hours of battery capacity this year, which would be the world's second-largest battery system behind one installed by AES for California's San Diego Gas & Electric Co [SDGE.UL] in February."
tesla,2017-5,"South Australia has yet to name a shortlist of bidders, after having received 90 expressions of interest from more than 10 countries. So by the time it signs contracts, the winner or winners will have only six months to meet a December deadline. [factbox: L4N1I51XB]"
tesla,2017-5,"At the same time, the state of Victoria is tendering to support construction of 100 MWh of battery capacity to be delivered in two stages by 2018."
tesla,2017-5,"AES says lessons learned in South Australia could be applied in Victoria, which is facing the loss some coal-fired power, and elsewhere, like Chile, where solar power is growing rapidly and will need to be combined with energy storage to avoid outages."
tesla,2017-5,"Stiff competition for the two state battery projects, with all the big makers like South Korea's Samsung SDI <006400.KS> and LG Chem <051910.KS>, Elon Musk's Tesla Inc and U.S. firm Greensmith Energy in the running, will help drive down prices for energy storage, another factor that should speed the spread of batteries along with wind and utility-scale solar."
tesla,2017-5,"""Combined renewable energy generation and storage solutions are becoming genuine competitors with fossil fuel base load generation. This will be the real game changer,"" said Josh Carmody, head of Australia for Equis Energy."
tesla,2017-5,"Equis Energy, a fund set up by former Macquarie bankers to invest in renewable energy projects around Asia, is building a large-scale solar farm in South Australia and is seeking state funding for batteries at the project."
tesla,2017-5,"Carmody said safety and performance problems as well as cost had limited the use of batteries in the energy supply system to date, but those challenges were being overcome rapidly."
tesla,2017-5,"For battery providers, the money making opportunity will come not only from energy storage but crucial extra services to manage voltage and frequency on grids, several energy storage executives said."

tesla,2017-5,"MELBOURNE, May 7 (Reuters) - Battery makers worldwide are watching to see whether Australia's most wind power-dependent state can keep the lights on by installing grid-scale batteries by December, which could help drive the growth of renewable energy across Australia and Asia."
tesla,2017-5,A decade-long political stalemate in Australia over energy and climate policy has effectively led to power and gas shortages and soaring energy prices threatening industry and households.
tesla,2017-5,"If batteries help solve Australia's problems by storing surplus electricity generated by wind and solar power, countries like Indonesia, the Philippines and Chile, could follow suit."
tesla,2017-5,"""I call South Australia the 'perfect storm' opportunity for energy storage,"" said Ismario Gonzalez, global sales director for AES Energy Storage, an arm of U.S. firm AES Corp , which has installed or is working on battery projects in seven countries, including Australia."
tesla,2017-5,"The more dependent the grid is on intermittent sources like wind and solar, the more flexible the back-up sources need to be. That's the appeal of battery storage. It can be switched on and off easily, responding faster than a gas peaking plant."
tesla,2017-5,"The state of South Australia, where wind and rooftop solar make up 44 percent of power sources, urgently needs to install big batteries after suffering blackouts over the past year."
tesla,2017-5,"It has little back-up as coal-fired power plants in the state have shut due to the rapid expansion of renewable energy. That has made it more dependent on power from neighbouring Victoria, its only link to Australia's national electricity market."
tesla,2017-5,"The state government plans to spend A$150 million ($115 million) supporting the installation of 100 megawatt hours of battery capacity this year, which would be the world's second-largest battery system behind one installed by AES for California's San Diego Gas & Electric Co [SDGE.UL] in February."
tesla,2017-5,"South Australia has yet to name a shortlist of bidders, after having received 90 expressions of interest from more than 10 countries. So by the time it signs contracts, the winner or winners will have only six months to meet a December deadline. [factbox: L4N1I51XB]"
tesla,2017-5,"At the same time, the state of Victoria is tendering to support construction of 100 MWh of battery capacity to be delivered in two stages by 2018."
tesla,2017-5,"AES says lessons learned in South Australia could be applied in Victoria, which is facing the loss some coal-fired power, and elsewhere, like Chile, where solar power is growing rapidly and will need to be combined with energy storage to avoid outages."
tesla,2017-5,"Stiff competition for the two state battery projects, with all the big makers like South Korea's Samsung SDI <006400.KS> and LG Chem <051910.KS>, Elon Musk's Tesla Inc and U.S. firm Greensmith Energy in the running, will help drive down prices for energy storage, another factor that should speed the spread of batteries along with wind and utility-scale solar."
tesla,2017-5,"""Combined renewable energy generation and storage solutions are becoming genuine competitors with fossil fuel base load generation. This will be the real game changer,"" said Josh Carmody, head of Australia for Equis Energy."
tesla,2017-5,"Equis Energy, a fund set up by former Macquarie bankers to invest in renewable energy projects around Asia, is building a large-scale solar farm in South Australia and is seeking state funding for batteries at the project."
tesla,2017-5,"Carmody said safety and performance problems as well as cost had limited the use of batteries in the energy supply system to date, but those challenges were being overcome rapidly."
tesla,2017-5,"For battery providers, the money making opportunity will come not only from energy storage but crucial extra services to manage voltage and frequency on grids, several energy storage executives said."

tesla,2017-5,"MONTERREY, Mexico, May 6 (Reuters) - Engineers from across Mexico streamed into a cramped hotel lobby in the industrial city of Monterrey for a chance of a job with the U.S. electric vehicle maker Tesla Inc , which is looking south of the border for talent in short supply at home."
tesla,2017-5,"The fair was held at a delicate time for American firms hiring abroad as President Donald Trump reviews immigration rules for bringing high-skilled foreign workers to the United States, part of a ""buy American, hire American"" policy."
tesla,2017-5,"Tesla, which prides itself on its ""Made in America"" credentials, had scheduled interviews with an unknown number of Mexican candidates on Friday and was slated to screen other prospective employees over the weekend at the closed-door event."
tesla,2017-5,"The Silicon Valley automaker is recruiting in the United States' neighbor for work on robotics and other automated equipment at its Fremont, California factory, where it aims to build 500,000 cars a year by 2018, a six-fold increase from 2016. The factory will build Tesla's upcoming Model 3."
tesla,2017-5,"Mexico boasts a substantial pool of experienced manufacturing engineers, with 19 automotive plants owned by global automakers including General Motors Co , Ford Motor Co , Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and Volkswagen ."
tesla,2017-5,"A steady tide of hopefuls showed up at the event unannounced and without an appointment, some having traveled hundreds of kilometers, mistakenly thinking it was an open recruiting fair. Several dozen were turned away."
tesla,2017-5,"Tesla gave them a brief explanation about the mix-up, said those being interviewed were often already weeks into their application processes, and directed them to email their resumes, according to more than a dozen mechanical, mechatronic, electrical and chemical engineers that Reuters spoke with outside the event."
tesla,2017-5,Representatives from Tesla headquarters in California and recruiters in Monterrey declined to comment on the event or the company's hiring plans in Mexico. Reporters were escorted off the premises by security.
tesla,2017-5,The call from a top U.S. company to Mexican engineers contrasts with the White House's cooler stance toward both Mexico and high-skilled immigrants.
tesla,2017-5,"In his first days in office, Trump pressured U.S. companies to stop moving manufacturing and jobs to lower cost Mexico. He also wants to overhaul a visa system that he says replaces Americans with workers from other countries, but shortages of engineers make it hard for technology companies to hire only Americans. [nL1N1HQ029]"
tesla,2017-5,Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk is himself an immigrant from South Africa who sits on Trump's business advisory council.
tesla,2017-5,"Tesla has been actively hiring in the past few months for assembly-line jobs at its Fremont plant, but has found that manufacturing engineers are in even shorter supply than software engineers in Silicon Valley.[nL2N1831NS]"
tesla,2017-5,"Despite being turned away at the Monterrey event, most of the engineers, some with 20 years of experience under their belts, other fresh out of college, remained optimistic about their prospects. By evening the lobby of the Grand Fiesta Americana hotel in the northern city was abuzz with prospective candidates cradling beige folders holding their resumes."
tesla,2017-5,"Word spread quickly after a recruiting poster was published on LinkedIn by Tesla's senior technical recruiter, David Johnson, listing 15 types of engineers the company would be seeking at the event in Monterrey. The post was picked up by foreign and Mexican media and also redistributed by local government on social media.[nL1N1I01YM]"
tesla,2017-5,"One mechanical engineer, who boasted of several years of research and development work at a foreign automaker in Mexico, made the 1,000 kilometer journey from near Mexico City, one of many who traveled from afar in the hopes of securing an interview."

tesla,2017-5,"{{20170504T205124.043+0000}}Tesla in talks to resolve issues with legacy Grohmann clientsFRANKFURT, May 4 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc said it is seeking to resolve outstanding issues with legacy customers of its Grohmann engineering unit after a takeover by the Silicon Valley-based carmaker resulted in a shift in management priorities toward Tesla projects."
tesla,2017-5,"Before being bought by Tesla in November, Grohmann helped clients build highly automated and efficient factories, including battery assembly lines for electric cars."
tesla,2017-5,"Grohmann's clients included rival automakers BMW , Volkswagen AG and Mercedes owner Daimler AG , before Tesla boss Elon Musk ordered the company's main management resources to be devoted toward pushing expansion of Tesla's production facilities."
tesla,2017-5,"""We have been in contact with every client for weeks on this issue and are on the way to finding individual solutions with each of them,"" Tesla said in a statement on Thursday."
tesla,2017-5,"The issue of how to deal with Grohmann's existing clients resulted in the departure of Klaus Grohmann, who was ousted at the end of March, only months after selling his company to Tesla. [nL8N1HZ5KL]"
tesla,2017-5,"The electric carmaker is counting on Grohmann Engineering's automation and engineering expertise to help it ramp up production to 500,000 cars per year by 2018 through the design of ultra efficient factories."
tesla,2017-5,"Founder Klaus Grohmann disagreed with Musk's demands to focus management attention on Tesla projects to the detriment of Grohmann Engineering's legacy clients, which included parts maker Bosch Corp , chip maker Intel Corp , and pharmaceutical firms Abbott Laboratories and Roche Holding AG in addition to the German carmakers."
tesla,2017-5,"""We believe that Grohmann will honour its contractual obligations toward us in future,"" BMW said in a statement on Thursday, adding that it had not been formally notified about any changes to the contractual arrangements."
tesla,2017-5,{{20170504T184642.592+0000}}Dip in Tesla's customer deposits triggers worries over ordersMay 4 (Reuters) - A 7 percent drop in Tesla Inc's customer deposits in its latest quarter raised concerns about future sales at the U.S. luxury electric-car maker.
tesla,2017-5,"The company's shares were down nearly 5 percent at $295.55 in afternoon trading on Thursday, on track for their third straight day of decline."
tesla,2017-5,"Customer deposits fell to $616.4 million at the end of the first quarter, from $663.9 million in the preceding quarter."
tesla,2017-5,"Tesla Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk repeatedly emphasized the difference between the Model 3 and the Model S, in an earnings call on Thursday."
tesla,2017-5,"The company had seen orders of the Model S hurt by confusion among customers, who were under the impression that the $35,000 Model 3 was an upgrade from the Model S, Musk said."
tesla,2017-5,The Model S lists at about double the starting price of the Model 3.
tesla,2017-5,"Tesla, which has faced production challenges in the past, is banking on the mass-market Model 3, which could finally allow the company to stem its free-wheeling cash burn and turn a profit."
tesla,2017-5,Pacific Crest Securities analyst Brad Erickson termed Tesla's communication regarding the misconception between the two cars confusing.
tesla,2017-5,"""Either Model S demand is getting hit by a pause in front of the Model 3 (less negative) or the Model 3 reservation list is inflated with orders that will not convert when the true identity of the car is discovered (more negative),"" Erickson wrote in a note."
tesla,2017-5,Some analysts were also worried about the prospect of Tesla hindering the sales of the higher-margin Model S.
tesla,2017-5,"Barclays analyst Brian Johnson said the drop off in customer deposits, along with the commentary around the Model S, might indicate an Osborne Effect in Model S and Model X orders."
tesla,2017-5,"Johnson was referring to the Osborne Computer Corp that went bankrupt in 1985, after the company damaged its own sales by announcing a new computer before it was ready."
tesla,2017-5,"""We continue to be cautious relative to the potential for a slower-than-guided start to Model 3 assembly, and newly believe that the potential for Model 3 pre-orders cancellations may increasingly become a point of investor concern,"" J.P. Morgan Securities analyst Ryan Brinkman said."
tesla,2017-5,"As of Wednesday's close, Tesla was the most valuable U.S. carmaker ahead of Detroit heavyweights General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co ."
tesla,2017-5,"Through Wednesday's close, Tesla's stock had risen more than 45 percent this year."

tesla,2017-5,{{20170504T152009.105+0000}}REFILE-SolarCity performance points to rockier outlook for rooftop solar(Fixes misspelled word in third paragraph)
tesla,2017-5,"May 4 (Reuters) - Tesla's SolarCity reported a drop of nearly 40 percent in solar installations for the first quarter on Wednesday, the latest sign of a reversal in fortunes for the once high-flying residential solar industry."
tesla,2017-5,"In an earnings report this week, Tesla said it deployed 150 megawatts of solar generation in the first quarter of 2017 compared to 245 MW in the first quarter of last year."
tesla,2017-5,"The company, which announced last week it was curtailing door-to-door sales, said it had prioritized higher-margin projects that generate cash up front rather than trying to sell as many installations as possible. But the dramatic drop in sales for a company that had consistently delivered double-digit growth puts it in line with a broad trend affecting the rooftop-solar industry."
tesla,2017-5,"Across the sector, installers report more difficulty finding customers. Subsidies have dwindled or been eliminated in some states, and many of the easiest consumers to sell to - environmentally conscious homeowners with disposable income - have already purchased rooftop systems."
tesla,2017-5,"""The trendsetters are kind of gone,"" Tammy Goad, vice president of corporate development for California-based Valley Energy said at a solar industry conference in San Diego on Tuesday."
tesla,2017-5,"Stiff competition in the industry has pushed some companies out of the market, or forced them to scale back. One of the nation's biggest rooftop solar companies, Sungevity, filed for bankruptcy earlier this year."
tesla,2017-5,"""Two years ago I thought I was a brilliant marketer. Today, I'm looking for answers,"" said Kathi McCalligan, director of marketing for San Diego installer Baker Electric, at the conference. The gathering focused on customer acquisition and was put on by the Solar Energy Industries Association."
tesla,2017-5,"Rooftop solar, a novelty in many neighborhoods just a few years ago, has enjoyed dramatic growth in recent years, including a 66 percent rise in installations between 2014 and 2015, according to SEIA and research firm GTM Research."
tesla,2017-5,"That growth rate slipped to 19 percent last year, and the trend has worsened significantly in 2017. Not only did SolarCity post its worst quarterly solar deployments in nearly two years, residential interconnection requests at California's three investor-owned utilities were down 35 percent in January and February, according to state data. California makes up about half the residential solar market."
tesla,2017-5,"Heavy rains in those months were likely to blame for some of that decline, but industry insiders say installations have not recovered as much as expected this spring."
tesla,2017-5,"At the same time, consumer complaints about high-pressure sales tactics are on the rise, according to government and private agencies. They say that aggressive door-to-door soliciting and telemarketing have soured some consumers on solar, as have online ads promising ""free solar."""
tesla,2017-5,"Solar-related complaints to the Better Business Bureau, a non-profit that promotes ethical business practices, are up 29 percent nationwide so far this year, Greg Dunn, president of the Hawaii BBB, said during a presentation at the conference. Nearly a quarter of those complaints relate to sales practice issues."
tesla,2017-5,"In California, the state's Contractors State License Board said it has received 199 complaints through early April, a level that is on track to exceed the 452 complaints received in 2016."
tesla,2017-5,"The rise in complaints has prompted the introduction of solar consumer protection bills in Florida and California, and SEIA earlier this year launched a campaign aimed at protecting solar consumers."
tesla,2017-5,"On Wednesday, the Wall Street Journal reported that federal regulators are probing whether large installers Sunrun Inc and SolarCity have fully disclosed their contract cancellation rates."
tesla,2017-5,"Other big players in rooftop solar including SunPower Corp , Sunrun and Vivint Solar Inc will report quarterly results next week."

tesla,2017-5,"SAN FRANCISCO, May 3 (Reuters) - Electric-car maker Tesla Inc on Wednesday reported first-quarter revenue that more than doubled, and while saying the upcoming Model 3 was on schedule for July, it downplayed the mass-market vehicle to give a sales pitch for its more expensive Model S."
tesla,2017-5,"Chief Executive Elon Musk's bold approach to cars, space exploration and clean energy has fueled investor enthusiasm for Tesla. But skeptics are waiting to see if Musk can fulfill his promise of producing 500,000 cars per year in 2018, or six times Tesla's 2016 production."
tesla,2017-5,Shares were down about 2 percent in after-hours trade following the results.

tesla,2017-5,"""We have seen some impact of Model S orders as a function of people being confused"" that Model 3 is the upgrade to Model S, Musk said on a conference call."
tesla,2017-5,Tesla said it had $4 billion of cash on hand as it headed into the second quarter and expects year-to-date capital expenditures to be slightly over $2 billion by the time it starts Model 3 production - within its previous targeted range of $2 billion to $2.5 billion.
tesla,2017-5,"That cushion should give the company some near-term breathing room from needing to tap Wall Street for cash, said CFRA Research analyst Efraim Levy. Tesla in March raised $1.2 billion from the markets."
tesla,2017-5,"Record deliveries helped Tesla boost its revenue to $2.7 billion in the quarter, but a net loss net widened to $330.3 million from $282.3 million a year earlier, largely driven by its SolarCity acquisition."
tesla,2017-5,"Tesla has much riding on the Model 3, which could finally make the cash-hemorrhaging automaker profitable. But while much of the company hype has focused on the car due in July, Tesla on Wednesday made a sales pitch for its overshadowed Model S."
tesla,2017-5,"Tesla is anxious that the $35,000 Model 3 - which will likely not be delivered in volume until 2018 - avoids cannibalizing the higher-margin Model S, which lists at about double the starting price."
tesla,2017-5,"In its earnings release, Tesla stated that a key challenge for the company would be to eliminate misperceptions about the differences between the Model S and the Model 3."
tesla,2017-5,"""We want to be super clear that Model 3 is not version three of our car. Model 3 is essentially a smaller, more affordable version of the Model S with fewer features,"" Musk said on a conference call, adding buyers erroneously thought the Model 3 would be more advanced."
tesla,2017-5,"""The Model S will be better than Model 3,"" he added. ""As it should be, as it's a more expensive car."""
tesla,2017-5,"Tesla needs to ramp up for a deluge of Model 3 customers, and the company said it would be adding nearly 100 retail, delivery and service locations worldwide, representing a 30 percent increase. Tesla also said it was also working to improve efficiency, citing vehicle repair times that have fallen by 35 percent due to the use of remote diagnostics."

tesla,2017-5,"NEW YORK, May 3 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Tesla is demonstrating how its electric cars can generate valuation staying power. Chief Executive Elon Musk oversaw a loss that missed Wall Street expectations by a country mile, even as the top line clocked in ahead of forecasts. More importantly, he's vowing that annual Model 3 production alone can meet the company's full target by the end of next year."
tesla,2017-5,"Musk has made a habit of missing goals in the past. Good executives do learn from their mistakes and Tesla has taken several steps to try to bulk up its facilities, including buying automated manufacturing firm Grohmann Engineering six months ago. Deliveries of 25,000 Model S and Model X vehicles in the first three months of the year were 69 percent higher than a year ago."
tesla,2017-5,"Growing from the 76,000 that rolled off the line last year to a run rate of half a million in 2018 would be a big shift, however. There are already signs of internal friction: Klaus Grohmann, who founded the eponymous firm Tesla acquired, was ousted last month after clashing with Musk over strategy, Reuters reported, citing an unnamed source."
tesla,2017-5,"First, the margins on a car with a base price of $35,000 will be much lower than ones on the Models S and X, which fetch at least $80,000 apiece. Even with mass production, Tesla is unlikely to achieve pre-tax margins much better than the 10 percent to 12 percent to which the likes of Daimler and BMW typically aspire."
tesla,2017-5,"At almost 26 times 2020 estimates, Tesla's stock is trading at a level implying Silicon Valley-style margins of 30 percent and near-perpetual vehicle-sales growth. Despite Musk's undeniable kinetic energy, that's simply unjustifiable."
tesla,2017-5,"- Tesla on May 3 reported a first-quarter loss attributable to common shareholders of $215 million, or $1.33 a share, missing the consensus estimate of an 84-cent loss."

tesla,2017-5,"{{20170503T210728.931+0000}}UPDATE 6-Investors cheer Delphi's bet on electric, connected cars(Adds analyst comment, closing share price)"
tesla,2017-5,"DETROIT, May 3 (Reuters) - Automotive supplier Delphi Automotive Plc on Wednesday said it plans to spin off operations tied to internal combustion engines and focus on technology for electrically powered and self-driving vehicles, boosting its share price and highlighting the challenges for legacy auto industry players."
tesla,2017-5,"Vehicles driven by humans and powered with petroleum will dominate roads from Shanghai to San Francisco for years to come, but investors who supply the capital to produce such vehicles are signaling a belief that after a century-long run, internal combustion cars are a sunset industry."
tesla,2017-5,"The most dramatic symbol of this turn is electric luxury car maker Tesla Inc's ascent this year to a higher market capitalization than either Ford Motor Co or General Motors Co . Despite a recent slump in U.S. sales, the Detroit giants are robustly profitable, while Tesla has yet to earn a full year profit. Tesla reports first-quarter results later Wednesday."
tesla,2017-5,"Delphi shares rose as much as 12 percent on Wednesday after the company announced its plan to separate into two entities - one dedicated to internal combustion technology and the other focused on electrification and automation. The shares closed at $87.01, up nearly 11 percent, representing about $2 billion in added market value."
tesla,2017-5,"""There's a whole element of the componentry of the car that Wall Street values at a lower level,"" Delphi Chief Executive Officer Kevin Clark told Reuters in an interview on Wednesday."
tesla,2017-5,Other big auto suppliers are making similar calls. German auto supplier Robert Bosch GmbH [ROBG.UL] earlier this week said it had sold its starters and alternators business to a Chinese mining company. [nL4N1I42Y1]
tesla,2017-5,"Germany's Rheinmetall also tried to float its Kolbenschmidt Pierburg unit, which is specialized in the development, manufacture and aftermarket supply of pistons, engine blocks, and plain bearings back in 2012. However, it was forced to call off the IPO due to a market slump and a lack of investor enthusiasm for a stock with heavy exposure to combustion engine technology, bankers said."
tesla,2017-5,"Combustion engines are taking a hit from regulators, particularly those in Europe and China, who want to slash greenhouse gas and smog forming emissions on a fast timetable. That risk was exacerbated by Volkswagen's diesel emissions scandal. As a result of ""Dieselgate,"" politicians in cities like Stuttgart have discussed banning diesel vehicles from the inner city, leading customers to abandon diesel cars."
tesla,2017-5,"On Wednesday, German car registration figures provided by Germany's KBA federal motor authority, showed that demand for diesel engine vehicles plunged by 19.3 percent in April, to a market share of 41.3 percent of overall registrations.[nL8N1I532M]"
tesla,2017-5,Delphi's Clark said he expects diesel production to decline by about 3 percent a year for the next few years.
tesla,2017-5,China's government has also set aggressive targets for electric vehicles that are forcing carmakers to accelerate electric vehicle plans. [nL3N1GQ4AT]
tesla,2017-5,"U.S. auto supplier Visteon , like Delphi, has shed most of its traditional car parts making operations, and is focused on connected vehicle technology and infotainment."
tesla,2017-5,"Clark said Delphi's powertrain business, which has about $4.5 billion in annual revenues and does not yet have a name, has room to grow. The company will have more freedom to invest in that growth as its managers no longer have to compete for capital with opportunities presented by the increasing computerization of cars, Clark said."
tesla,2017-5,"The powertrain company, which accounted for about 27 percent of Delphi revenues last year, also could seize opportunities to consolidate other players in the legacy market, capitalizing on the continued demand for internal combustion and the regulatory pressure to make them cleaner, a person familiar with Delphi's strategy said."
tesla,2017-5,"Analysts on Wednesday estimated Delphi's powertrain business will be valued at six to seven times earnings before interest and taxes, while the electronic and autonomous technology side of the company will likely command a higher valuation."
tesla,2017-5,"The electronic Delphi - which also could get a new name - will compete in a potential market the company estimates at more than $100 billion a year, nearly twice the size of the internal combustion market. Delphi said its electronic systems units had about $12 billion in revenue last year."
tesla,2017-5,"Delphi ""is best positioned to be the 'picks and shovels' supplier of big data solutions"" to automakers, Barclays analyst Brian Johnson wrote in a note on Wednesday."
tesla,2017-5,"But the market of the future is still largely in the future. Most established car makers, for instance, have not adopted over the air software upgrades on a mass scale, and depend entirely on internal combustion engine cars and sport utilities for profits."
tesla,2017-5,"Clark said over the next three to five years demand will accelerate for high speed in-vehicle data networking systems, autonomous driving technology and over the air software updates. Delphi has acquired a company that enables over the air software updates, as well as a company that develops high speed data networks. Clark said Delphi could make more acquisitions to expand its electronic systems capability, or forge more partnerships."
tesla,2017-5,"Delphi has partnerships through its autonomous vehicle business with Intel Corp and Israeli autonomous vehicle technology firm Mobileye , which is being bought by Intel for $15.3 billion."
tesla,2017-5,"""If we can do more things like that"" the Mobileye-Intel partnership, ""that would be great,"" Clark said."
tesla,2017-5,Delphi is betting that many automakers will ultimately opt to buy a standard system rather than invest in one-of-a-kind systems of their own. Delphi said it expects to launch its turnkey autonomous driving system with a customer in 2019.
tesla,2017-5,"The spinoff will be tax free and is expected to be completed by March 2018, Delphi said."
