tesla,2017-12,(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are her own.)
tesla,2017-12,"HONG KONG, Dec 28 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Samsung Electronics <005930.KS> will soon soup up its engine for the car race of the future. The tech behemoth faces slowing growth in its core smartphone and chips products at the same time as it's distracted by a leadership crisis. Revving up its automotive offering, as strategy chief Young Sohn recently said the company would like to do, could help Samsung jump start new growth engines."
tesla,2017-12,"The cyclical market for memory chips, which account for over 60 percent of Samsung's operating profit, may enter a downturn next year, analysts warn. Meanwhile, the automotive tech market is growing fast and could be worth $645 billion or more by 2030, according to Jefferies. By then 95 percent of new cars on the road could be self-driving, reckon Bernstein analysts."
tesla,2017-12,"The South Korean conglomerate splashed out $8 billion in 2016 for Harman, a parts supplier which provides infotainment systems to Volkswagen , General Motors and other carmakers. So far, though, the company has only dabbled in autonomous vehicles, taking small stakes in startups including Oculii, which makes radar sensors, and car-safety specialist TTTech."
tesla,2017-12,"That pales in comparison to Qualcomm's $47 billion bid for automotive chip maker NXP Semiconductors , or Intel's $15 billion acquisition of Mobileye. Apple , Alphabet and Uber are pouring huge sums into self-driving cars and GM plans to put fleets of robo-taxis on U.S. streets by 2019."
tesla,2017-12,"Samsung's $46 billion or so of net cash gives it the financial power to try and catch up. Investing some of that to beef up Harman's integrated car systems to rival Delphi is one option. Another would involve playing to its natural strengths in semiconductors and taking on the likes of NXP and Nvidia , whose chips power cars from Tesla to Toyota <7203.T>."
tesla,2017-12,"Or it could try expanding into a related field by snagging, for example, a cyber-security specialist. The candidates range from the $3 billion FireEye to $18 billion Symantec ."
tesla,2017-12,"There are a couple of obstacles in its path, though. First, Samsung is engulfed in a leadership crisis: de facto boss Jay Y. Lee was convicted of bribery in August and several top executives have since resigned. Second, organic expansion takes time, yet Samsung has never been a big M&A player: Harman is its largest acquisition."
tesla,2017-12,"That means new executives will need quickly to get comfortable with taking the wheel. With so many players already further down the road, Samsung needs to speed up to compete."
tesla,2017-12,"- Samsung Electronics President and Chief Strategy Officer Young Sohn on Dec. 1 said he was keen for the company to expand in automotive markets, digital health and industrial automation."
tesla,2017-12,"- Speaking to Reuters on the sidelines of the Slush tech startup festival in Helsinki, Sohn said Samsung's $8 billion purchase of automotive and audio company, Harman, in 2016 had given Samsung confidence to chase big deals."
tesla,2017-12,"- By 2030, 106 million new vehicles a year, or 95 percent of all new cars sold, will be fully autonomous, according to analysts at Bernstein."

tesla,2017-12,* NGK Spark Plug joins other suppliers in developing EV parts
tesla,2017-12,"NAGOYA, Japan, Dec 22 (Reuters) - Facing the eventual demise of gasoline engines, the world's biggest maker of spark plugs is turning its focus to a component it believes will be just as vital in the coming era of electric vehicles - next-generation all solid state batteries."
tesla,2017-12,"Japan's NGK Spark Plug Co <5334.T> has for years leveraged its expertise in ceramics technology used in spark plugs to expand into sensors, semiconductors and other products mainly for automobiles."
tesla,2017-12,"Now, it sees a future in all solid-state batteries, which experts believe will be safer and more powerful than the lithium-ion batteries currently used in battery electric vehicles (EVs)."
tesla,2017-12,"After dominating transport for 150 years, the internal combustion engine is facing the end of the road in the coming decades as tightening global emissions regulations force automakers to develop more electric cars."
tesla,2017-12,"""We realised that it was inevitable that the industry would at some point shift from the internal combustion engine to battery EVs, and that ultimately this could make our spark plug and oxygen sensor businesses obsolete,"" Takio Kojima, senior general manager of engineering and R&D at NGK Spark Plug told Reuters in an interview."
tesla,2017-12,"""Our expertise is in advanced ceramics, and so we have decided to pursue all solid-state batteries."""
tesla,2017-12,"Established in 1936 and based in Japan's automaking heartland of Nagoya, NGK Spark Plug's realisation that its main business faced obsolescence came around 2010, Kojima said."
tesla,2017-12,"That was the year Nissan Motor Co <7201.T> rolled out the Leaf, the first mass-production all battery EV, and just after Tesla Inc came out with the Roadster, its first production car."
tesla,2017-12,Other global parts suppliers are also scrambling to overhaul their product portfolios.
tesla,2017-12,"In Japan, Denso Corp <6902.T> has teamed up with Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T> and Mazda Motor Corp <7261.T> to develop battery EVs while transmission maker Aisin Seiki Co <7259.T> is developing hybrid transmission systems and EV-specific, four-wheel-drive units."
tesla,2017-12,"In the United States, powertrain products maker Borg Warner has expanded into hybrid and electric car parts, including transmissions and drive modules for electric cars."
tesla,2017-12,"Industry experts anticipate plug-in hybrid petrol-electric vehicles and all-battery EVs will account for as much as 26 percent of global car sales by 2030, versus just over 1 percent last year, data from the International Energy Agency shows."
tesla,2017-12,"The rise in EV use will require a steep increase in manufacturing capacity for longer-life batteries which are more powerful, lighter and can charge quicker than conventional lithium-ion batteries."
tesla,2017-12,"NGK Spark Plug joins Toyota and other companies developing all solid-state car batteries, which offer more capacity and better safety than conventional lithium-ion batteries by replacing their liquid or gel-like electrolyte with a solid, conductive material."
tesla,2017-12,"Toyota is developing batteries with sulfide-based solid electrolytes, which offer high conductivity and are relatively flexible but can release toxic hydrogen sulfide when exposed to moisture."
tesla,2017-12,"NGK Spark Plug is betting on a different technology with an oxide-based chemistry using ceramics which is highly stable at extreme temperatures, but has less conductivity. In addition, brittle ceramics can be difficult to process."
tesla,2017-12,"Japan's TDK Corp <6762.T> has developed small, ceramic, all solid-state batteries for use mainly in wearable devices like personal fitness monitors, while Murata Manufacturing Co <6981.T> is developing similar products."
tesla,2017-12,"But NGK Spark Plug has bigger plans, developing a larger format necessary for cars."
tesla,2017-12,"""It's relatively easy to work in smaller sizes, but when you get to larger sizes it gets very difficult to assemble each layer because it's difficult to make each layer the same thickness,"" said Hideaki Hikosaka, a member of NGK Spark Plug's solid state battery R&D team."
tesla,2017-12,"The company has spent the past five years developing a solid, oxide-based electrolyte which incorporates an additional material to make it resemble a sulfide-based one."
tesla,2017-12,"This makes the electrolyte easier to process into larger, thin layers which are compressed, making them easier to stack with anodes and cathodes."
tesla,2017-12,"""It's because of the addition of that material that we're able to process layers using compression (rather than sintering) to make a bigger, oxide-based battery cell. At the same time, it doesn't release any gases like sulfides do,"" Hikosaka said."
tesla,2017-12,"As a result, the company has developed a 10 cm by 10 cm battery pouch cell, much bigger than 4.5 mm by 3.2 mm cells developed by TDK."
tesla,2017-12,NGK Spark Plug declined to comment on the material used in its oxide compound and the capabilities of its battery.
tesla,2017-12,"Hikosaka said his team was working to raise the battery's energy density to enable it to match the performance of lithium ion batteries by around 2020, and to develop more powerful, lighter and competitively priced batteries ""in the 2020s""."
tesla,2017-12,"Battery experts believe producing affordable, all solid-state batteries in the 2020s, a target also shared by Toyota, is ambitious given the challenges of achieving a fine balance between numerous performance characteristics."
tesla,2017-12,"Once they do come to market, some experts believe competition between batteries based on oxides, sulfides, and other chemistries would likely heat up, as producers vie to deliver batteries with diverse specifications."
tesla,2017-12,"""If these chemistries can compete and win against lithium-ion and we see a shift to all solid-state, we might see a diversification in the materials used in them, as in lithium-ion batteries,"" said Venkat Srinivasan, director of the Argonne Collaborative Center for Energy Storage Science in Illinois."
tesla,2017-12,"""Some automakers and battery makers might be more interested in conductivity than oxidative stability, for example ... Batteries are all about compromise. You're not going to hit every metric."""

tesla,2017-12,"(Removes attribution to report in headline, corrects which GTM report data comes from in paragraphs 8 and 9)"
tesla,2017-12,"Dec 15 (Reuters) - After years of double-digit growth, home solar installations in the United States are poised to fall for the first time this year, according to a report released on Thursday by GTM Research."
tesla,2017-12,"The reason? An analysis of installation data suggests that most of the slowdown is traceable to a single company: Tesla Inc , which acquired sister company SolarCity about a year ago."
tesla,2017-12,"For years, SolarCity, with early backing from Tesla CEO Elon Musk, was the biggest player in residential solar and the driving force behind that market's supercharged growth."
tesla,2017-12,"When Tesla bought SolarCity last year, Musk called the acquisition a ""no-brainer,"" saying the two companies shared ""the same overarching goal of sustainable energy."""
tesla,2017-12,"But under Tesla's ownership, the company has largely stopped its aggressive marketing campaigns and ambitious expansion."
tesla,2017-12,"As a result, Tesla's rooftop solar installations have fallen sharply each quarter this year compared to last. In the third quarter, installations were off by 42 percent over the previous year."
tesla,2017-12,"Tesla declined to comment for this story, but has previously said that while sales are down, margins are up. The company expects its fourth-quarter solar installation numbers to be higher than those of the third quarter."
tesla,2017-12,"Overall, the residential solar market is expected to fall 13 percent this year, according to GTM's quarterly solar market report, released on Thursday. That compares with a 19 percent rise last year and four straight years before that of increases above 50 percent."
tesla,2017-12,"SolarCity was responsible for an outsized portion of that growth, accounting for a quarter of the national market in 2016 and more than 30 percent the previous two years. By the third quarter of this year, its share had dropped to 14 percent, according to GTM's U.S. PV Leaderboard report."
tesla,2017-12,"""If SolarCity accounted for a 30 percent share of the national market and you cut those installation volumes effectively in half, that's really what we are looking at in terms of the market downturn in 2017,"" said Austin Perea, who tracks the U.S. residential solar market for GTM."
tesla,2017-12,SolarCity's rapid growth was fueled in part by a no-money-down offering that enabled residential customers to pay a monthly fee to go solar. The business generated huge sales volumes but led to investor concern about debt.
tesla,2017-12,In many ways SolarCity's rise helped lift the fortunes of smaller rivals.
tesla,2017-12,"""They spent a lot of money making people aware of what solar can do and all of us little guys have been the beneficiaries of that,"" said Jim Petersen, chief executive of Fremont, California-based PetersenDean, who said his company is forecasting sales growth of 7 to 9 percent this fiscal year."
tesla,2017-12,"Tesla stopped selling installations door-to-door earlier this year, eliminating a major way it reached new customers. It now sells systems in its high-end retail stores, where cars and batteries are also sold."
tesla,2017-12,"SolarCity's fall has benefited some competitors. Sunrun Inc , the largest publicly held standalone residential installer, has gained market share this year, and its installations are expected to rise 15 percent in 2017."

tesla,2017-12,"The government used an existing incentive program to help attract BYD, which recently announced it will open an Ontario factory to assembly 900 electric vehicles over the next five years, Economic Development Minister Brad Duguid said by email."

tesla,2017-12,"The deal gives Europe-focused Unibail, which owns Les 4 Temps and Forum des Halles in Paris and has centres spreading from Helsinki to Valencia, exposure to Britain, the United States and Italy, countries where Westfield operates 35 malls."
tesla,2017-12,"The acquisition is part of Unibail's strategy of increasingly focusing on high-end ""destination"" malls in landmark locations and Westfield would bring shopping centres in big cities like London, New York and San Francisco, which offer customers a wide range of restaurants, bars and entertainment."
tesla,2017-12,"Unibail could replicate some of Westfield's services at its other centres around Europe, including staging events like concerts and hosting pop-up shops, according to a source familiar with the matter."

tesla,2017-12,"As part of its ""destination"" mall push, Unibail has said it plans to sell some regional Westfield shopping centres in the United States to concentrate on malls in central locations of big cities, but has not provided more specific details."
tesla,2017-12,Cuvillier said one of the reasons why many American malls and department stores were struggling was a failure to diversify into offering customers food.

tesla,2017-12,"Dec 14 (Reuters) - U.S. solar installations will fall more than expected this year, according to an industry report released on Thursday, due to weakened demand for residential systems and delays on large projects over concerns that President Donald Trump will impose tariffs on imported panels, increasing costs."
tesla,2017-12,"In a quarterly report, GTM Research said it expected U.S. installations to fall 22 percent to 11.8 gigawatts (GW) this year, down from a prior forecast that called for a decline of 17 percent. GTM conducted the analysis for the Solar Energy Industries Association trade group."
tesla,2017-12,"In the third quarter, market installations fell 51 percent to 2.03 GW. Last year was a particularly strong year for installations as developers raced to capture a federal tax credit that had been scheduled to expire at the end of 2016. The solar market is also expected to fall next year but will resume growth in 2019, GTM said."
tesla,2017-12,"Many utility-scale project developers are delaying projects due to tight solar panel supplies, the report said. Uncertainty regarding a trade case brought by U.S. manufacturer Suniva has raised the price of panels and prompted some developers to buy in advance of their needs, GTM said."

tesla,2017-12,{{20171212T052055.226+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-Tencent's list of impulse buys looks worrying(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are her own.)
tesla,2017-12,"HONG KONG, Dec 12 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Tencent's <0700.HK> shopping spree looks increasingly distracted. The Chinese social media and gaming group is planning a foray into bricks and mortar via a minority stake in a hypermarket chain. Apart from irritating its arch rival, Alibaba , this tie-up makes little strategic sense. Nor do earlier stakes in Tesla , Snap and Spotify."
tesla,2017-12,"Shares of Shanghai-listed Yonghui Superstores <601933.SS> soared by the daily limit of 10 percent last Friday on media reports of the deal. On Monday the hypermarket chain operator confirmed that it is in talks to transfer a 5 percent stake, worth roughly 4.3 billion yuan ($649 million) based on the undisturbed share price, to the Shenzhen-based company. Details are not finalised, but Tencent may also inject new funding into a Yonghui subsidiary in exchange for a 15 percent stake."
tesla,2017-12,"The $493 billion internet goliath is trailing rival Alibaba into traditional retail, where boss Jack Ma has splashed out over $10 billion over the past few years on major stakes in malls and grocery stores. Just last month Alibaba took a 36 percent stake in Sun Art Retail <6808.HK>, a leading Chinese retailer, for $2.9 billion, and is building out a high-tech chain of stores called Hema."
tesla,2017-12,"This might make sense for Alibaba's shopping platforms. But for Tencent, combining its mobile games and chat apps with supermarkets is unlikely to produce synergies. Direct access to Yonghui's customers may help increase users of Tencent's mobile payments arm in the battle against Ma's Alipay. But Tencent already has exposure through its 18 percent stake in e-commerce ally JD.com , which owns a stake in Yonghui and partners with it selling groceries online."
tesla,2017-12,"Tencent can afford to splurge, to be sure. Analysts polled on Eikon forecast it will churn out some $14 billion in operating cash flow this year. But the company's recent dealmaking raises red flags nonetheless. Passive stakes in Tesla and Snap , both publicly traded U.S. companies, look like trophy assets. Ditto for the recent share swap with Swedish music platform Spotify. Executives owe investors a good explanation."
tesla,2017-12,"- Chinese gaming and social media company Tencent plans to buy a 5 percent stake in Shanghai-listed Yonghui Superstores, according to a Yonghui filing on Dec. 11."
tesla,2017-12,"- Tencent may also buy a 15 percent stake in Yonghui's supply chain and logistics subsidiary, the retailer said. Details of the investments, including transaction prices, remain under discussion."

tesla,2017-12,"VANCOUVER, Dec 11 (Reuters) - Canadian developers of cobalt and lithium mines stand to benefit from a round of investments from the makers of electric vehicles and the batteries powering them, a potential game-changer for small miners short on money to develop deposits of these critical battery ingredients."
tesla,2017-12,"Toronto-listed cobalt companies, Ecobalt Solutions and Fortune Minerals , are in talks, ranging from preliminary to more advanced, with more than a dozen groups, including car and battery makers, on financing their projects, their chief executives told Reuters."
tesla,2017-12,The interest in miners from downstream players along the battery supply chain - a new area of investment for most - would provide a life-line to miners at time when equity funding for developers remains relatively tight after a five-year downturn on weak metals prices.
tesla,2017-12,"""We anticipate additional transactions in the coming months and years. It is a function of demand-supply imbalance,"" said John Kanellitsas, President and Vice Chairman of Lithium Americas Corp , which raised nearly $300 million this year for a project in Argentina."
tesla,2017-12,A string of potential financing deals in Canada comes after a handful of predominantly lithium miners in Australia - the world's biggest lithium producer - secured investment from mainly Chinese automakers and battery makers this year looking to lock in future raw material supply.
tesla,2017-12,"Lithium mine developers have been able to secure funding earlier than their cobalt peers as fears of a supply shortage started in late 2015, when cobalt was still in surplus."
tesla,2017-12,"Like lithium, cobalt's price has doubled - but most of that upswing has come this year on concerns of multi-year shortfalls in the next decade as demand from the electric vehicle sector surges. [nL8N1JB4AB]"
tesla,2017-12,"Cobalt's fortunes are more closely tied to batteries than lithium's: about 55 percent of all cobalt goes into battery chemicals compared to about 40 percent for lithium, according to a Dec. 4 BMO Capital Markets report."
tesla,2017-12,"Although there are no guarantees that deals will be struck, the cobalt miners, who have been advancing their projects for more than a decade, are in their strongest position yet to secure funding, said Cormark Securities analyst MacMurray Whale."
tesla,2017-12,"That is because of deficit forecasts due to constrained supply and expected soaring demand from the electric vehicle market. ""All those elements together suggest to me that it can't be better,"" Whale said."
tesla,2017-12,"With more than 1,200 publicly listed mining companies, Canada has long been the global hub for mine developers with projects around the world."
tesla,2017-12,"Vancouver-based Ecobalt's ""path forward"" is to first sign a long-term supply agreement, called an offtake, with one or more customers to provide a portion of the funds it needs to develop its Idaho cobalt project, CEO Paul Farquharson said in an email."
tesla,2017-12,"Once in place, this would significantly lower the risk for the project, making it more attractive for banks to provide debt financing and other investors to fund the balance."
tesla,2017-12,"Ecobalt outlined plans on Dec. 7 to produce for offtake a cobalt concentrate, a less-processed cobalt product than initially planned - a step that could slash as much as $100 million, according to analysts, off its previous project capital cost estimate of $187 million. [nCNW8k2Vwa]"
tesla,2017-12,"Ecobalt, whose Idaho project is the only fully-permitted, primary cobalt deposit in the United States, is the most likely of the Canadian cobalt developers to secure financing, possibly within six months, said Eight Capital analyst David Talbot."
tesla,2017-12,"Canada's Nemaska Lithium and Mason Graphite , which both have projects in Quebec, could also secure funding in coming months, Talbot said."
tesla,2017-12,"Graphite is another battery ingredient but unlike cobalt and lithium, batteries are not graphite's main end-use."
tesla,2017-12,"Ecobalt's Idaho project has unique advantages over other projects including that around 75 percent of its revenue will come from cobalt and that it is located in a safe political jurisdiction, Talbot said."
tesla,2017-12,"Almost all cobalt is produced as a by-product from copper and nickel mines, meaning output increases are dependant on other markets."
tesla,2017-12,"More than half of the world's cobalt comes from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), a country racked by political instability and legal opacity, and where child labor is used in mines - a worry for automakers looking to secure ethically-sourced battery raw materials. [nL8N1NZ1YB]"
tesla,2017-12,"Fortune, which is seeking more than $700 million to develop its Nico cobalt mine and processing plant in Canada, expects to secure finance in 2018 once it releases a feasibility study on an expanded project, CEO Robin Goad said."
tesla,2017-12,"""Our biggest advantage is to be able to market our project as a Canadian source of supply,"" Goad said."

tesla,2017-12,{{20171205T180001.537+0000}}Disrupt This! Innovation ETFs are storming the market(The writer is a Reuters contributor. The opinions expressed are his own.)
tesla,2017-12,"NEW YORK, Dec 5 (Reuters) - Amazon.com is disrupting retail. Airbnb is disrupting hotels. Uber [UBER.UL] is disrupting transportation. Who is going to be disrupted next?"
tesla,2017-12,A growing number of exchange-traded funds are searching for that answer.
tesla,2017-12,"Instead of investing in the traditional companies playing defense, they are buying hefty stakes in the firms shaking up the way business was always done."
tesla,2017-12,Most of the early gains from innovative disruptors went to venture capitalists and private equity.
tesla,2017-12,"Now ETFs - like iShares Exponential Technologies , Ark Invest's ARK Innovation and Knowledge Leaders Developed World - are delivering stakes in cutting-edge innovation, but in a relatively low-cost ETF wrapper."
tesla,2017-12,"The innovation theme is a particularly timely bet. Just think how many capabilities are contained in a single smartphone, for example, and how that compares to 10 years ago. Indeed, many of the biggest companies in the country, such as Facebook , did not even exist not so long ago."
tesla,2017-12,"""We haven't had so many innovative platforms taking shape since the late 1800s,"" says Tom Staudt, ARK Invest's chief operating officer. ""Back then it was things like internal combustion engines, telephones and electricity. These days massive change is being driven by fields like DNA sequencing, robotics and artificial intelligence, battery storage and blockchain."""
tesla,2017-12,"You can argue about the riskiness or long-term viability of the strategy, but it is hard to argue with recent results. This year, ARK Invest's offerings have consistently ranked in the top handful of non-leveraged products across the entire ETF universe. ARKK's annualized gains from 2014 through Dec. 1 are 23.6 percent, according to fund tracker Morningstar. Its year-to-date return is an eye-popping 86.5 percent."
tesla,2017-12,"Take a look under the hood and you understand why the fund has been on such a run. Top holdings include such famed disruptors as Tesla , Amazon.com and Bitcoin Investment Trust, the latter of which now makes up almost 7 percent of the portfolio."
tesla,2017-12,"Most of ARK's products are actively managed, relatively rare in the ETF world, which pushes fees up. ARKK, for instance, clocks in at an expense ratio of 0.75 percent, higher than most of its passively-managed brethren."
tesla,2017-12,"The firm now has $2.7 billion under management and five ETFs on the market. One more, launching just this week: Israel Innovative Technologies , capitalizing on that country's status as an emerging market and tech hotbed."
tesla,2017-12,Take Knowledge Leaders Developed World. The core thesis of this ETF is that companies which invest significantly in R&D end up outperforming the broader market and powerfully so.
tesla,2017-12,But it also seeks out consumers of exponential technologies as well as producers and companies with a proven record of profitability.
tesla,2017-12,"The portfolio ends up with slices of several hundred equally-weighted firms, many of which are from sectors you might not associate with disruptive innovation such as consumer staples, food and beverage, chemicals and industrial machinery."
tesla,2017-12,"""Innovation touches our everyday lives in far more ways than most people realize,"" says Steve Vannelli, CEO of Knowledge Leaders Funds."
tesla,2017-12,"Another unique approach: since the ETF scours globally for R&D spending, that means ""the chips fall where they may,"" says Vannelli."
tesla,2017-12,"The ETF holds a heavy dose of Japan, home to more than a third of total holdings. The fund's year-to-date performance: 26.3 percent, outpacing the S&P 500 by over six percentage points."
tesla,2017-12,"It is not just niche money managers who are capitalizing on the innovation theme either. BlackRock's iShares Exponential Technologies now has over $1.5 billion in assets. Its formation was inspired by money manager Ric Edelman of Edelman Financial, who had pressed for an ETF of next-gen technologies for clients."
tesla,2017-12,"Many of its top holdings are IT plays, such as Micron Technologies and Tencent Holdings <0700.HK>. More than 60 percent of the portfolio is based in the United States, tracking the Morningstar Exponential Technologies Index."
tesla,2017-12,The ETF boasts a one-year return of 37.8 percent and 14 percent annualized since inception in 2015.
tesla,2017-12,"A word of caution for investors, however: don't pile too much into disruptive innovation just to chase those juicy returns."
tesla,2017-12,"""When people are investing in niche or non-traditional asset classes like this, they have to be very careful - how much money do you have, what are you saving for, what is your tolerance,"" says Deborah Fuhr, managing director of London-based consultancy ETFGI. ""This is riskier stuff - and it's definitely not for everyone."""

tesla,2017-12,"Dec 4 (Reuters) - Britain's largest motor insurer Direct Line is offering Tesla Inc drivers in Britain a 5-percent discount for switching on the car's autopilot system, seeking to encourage use of a system it hopes will cut down on accidents."
tesla,2017-12,The move - confirmed by company representatives in response to Reuters' questions - is Tesla's only tie-up in the UK and comes at a time when the company is trying to convince insurers that its internet-connected vehicles are statistically safer.
tesla,2017-12,Direct Line said it was too early to say whether the use of the autopilot system produced a safety record that justified lower premiums. It said it was charging less to encourage use of the system and aid research.
tesla,2017-12,"""At present the driver is firmly in charge so it's just like insuring other cars, but it does offer Direct Line a great opportunity to learn and prepare for the future,"" said Dan Freedman, Head of Motor Development at Direct Line."
tesla,2017-12,Direct Line sells insurance policies to customers introduced to it by Tesla. Tesla then provides information on the features and capabilities of its vehicles to help Direct Line set insurance prices.
tesla,2017-12,"According to Tesla's website, some of the autopilot functions include matching speed to traffic conditions, automatically changing lanes without driver input and even self-parking. The car can also be ""summoned"" to and from a garage."
tesla,2017-12,"""Crash rates across all Tesla models have fallen by 40 percent since the introduction of the autopilot system ... However, when owners seek to insure their Tesla vehicles, this is not reflected in the pricing of premiums,"" Daniel Pearce, Financial Analyst at GlobalData, said."
tesla,2017-12,"""The insurance industry will gradually respond to these developments,"" Pearce added."
tesla,2017-12,"Direct Line, which is enjoying soaring motor insurance prices in Britain, said it sets premiums for Tesla drivers based on the risk they present, including who is driving, their age, driving experience and claim history."
tesla,2017-12,"""We aim to offer competitive premiums and we've welcomed a good number of Tesla drivers in the UK,"" Freedman said."
tesla,2017-12,"Tesla declined to specify how many vehicles with autopilot capabilities currently are on British roads but industry figures pointed to UK data on imports, which suggest the number is more than 4,500."

tesla,2017-12,"LOS ANGELES, Nov 30 (Reuters) - Success in the United States used to come easily for German automaker BMW AG , whose sporty sedans in three sizes would be snapped up by affluent consumers."
tesla,2017-12,"The premium auto business has now become more complicated, as illustrated by the BMW models displayed at this week's Los Angeles auto show, amid a backdrop of heavy spending by luxury auto brands on new models and technology as they make awkward leaps from a predictable past to an uncertain future."
tesla,2017-12,"On one side of BMW's display stood a prototpye of a large X7 sport utility vehicle, a vehicle that was unthinkable in its lineup a few years ago when the top of the line was still defined as a large sedan."
tesla,2017-12,"On the other side, BMW displayed the iVision, a prototype of an electric sedan that will rival Silicon Valley electric luxury car maker Tesla Inc's Model S when the production version, or non-prototype version, launches in 2021."
tesla,2017-12,"""This is the future,"" said Bernhard Kuhnt, the new head of BMW's North American operations, referring to the iVision and electric vehicles in general."
tesla,2017-12,"More immediately, Kuhnt said, the X7 represents BMW's determination to offer more sport utility vehicles, which now account for more than half of luxury vehicle sales in the United States, to reverse a four percent slide in sales this year through October."
tesla,2017-12,"""In October, we sold 60 percent sedans in a market that is 55 percent SUVs,"" he said."
tesla,2017-12,"But next year, as BMW's U.S. dealers get more newly redesigned X3 SUVs, and a new X2 sport utility, the SUV-to-sedan ratio will start to flip, and sales should grow, he said."
tesla,2017-12,BMW's rivals are at different points in their own jumps from the strategies that fueled growth during the past two decades. The type of vehicle that defines the top of the line for German luxury brands shows how the business is changing.
tesla,2017-12,"""The classic definition of the standard bearer as a three-box sedan, that is migrating in three directions,"" said Scott Keogh, head of U.S. operations for Volkswagen AG's Audi brand."
tesla,2017-12,"One direction, he said, is ""electrification as the new prestige,"" a trend driven by Tesla."
tesla,2017-12,Rivals at other established luxury brands agreed during interviews at the LA show that some form of electric power - fully electric or plug-in hybrids - is now necessary in order to compete.
tesla,2017-12,"""The U.S. is a market where customers are asking for electric"" vehicles, Hakan Samuelsson, chief executive of Volvo Cars, said in an interview on the sidelines of the LA auto show Wednesday. ""That's a premium value - to be carbon free."""
tesla,2017-12,Volvo has said it will engineer all its vehicles to rely on full or partial electric power starting in 2019.
tesla,2017-12,German luxury car makers have announced aggressive plans to expand their electric vehicle lineups.[nL5N1LT47Z]
tesla,2017-12,"Another way the market is veering away from sedans is with the rise of the large, luxury SUV, now available in most luxury brands at prices that can easily top $100,000.
