tesla,2017-6,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla., June 27 (Reuters) - SpaceX wants to expand facilities in Florida to refurbish and store its reusable rocket boosters as it increases the pace of launches, documents filed with authorities show."
tesla,2017-6,"The privately owned rocket company, operated by entrepreneur Elon Musk, proposes building a 67,222-square-foot (6,245-square meter) hangar just south of its Cape Canaveral launch sites to prepare recovered Falcon boosters for reflight, according to the documents."
tesla,2017-6,The Port Canaveral Board of Commissioners is scheduled to consider SpaceX's proposed lease on Wednesday.
tesla,2017-6,"Since successfully landing its first Falcon rocket in December 2015, SpaceX has successfully returned boosters 12 more times on drone barges floating in the ocean or on a landing pad on the ground. Two of those boosters were refurbished and relaunched on second satellite-delivery missions."
tesla,2017-6,SpaceX in March took over a spacecraft processing facility at Port Canaveral that once was used to prepare Spacehab science and equipment modules for flight aboard NASA's now-retired space shuttles. The new lease is for 2.2 acres of vacant land adjacent to the Spacehab building.
tesla,2017-6,"The hangar that SpaceX wants to build there will be used for rocket refurbishment and storage, company spokesman John Taylor said. The old Spacehab building will be used for offices, rocket storage and to house equipment currently positioned at the dock where SpaceX's floating landing pad returns from sea, Taylor said."
tesla,2017-6,"""Right now, we have that work dispersed at Kennedy Space Center and Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. This will allow us to consolidate and work more efficiently,"" Taylor said."
tesla,2017-6,"SpaceX operates two launch sites in Florida, though one remains out of service following a September 2016 accident that destroyed a $62 million rocket, a $200 million communications satellite and heavily damaged the launch pad. Repairs are underway and SpaceX expects to resume flights from the pad, located at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, later this year."
tesla,2017-6,"The California-based firm uses the space shuttle's old launch pads at Kennedy Space Center in Florida, just north of the Air Force base. It also has a launch site at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California and is building a launch site near Brownsville, Texas."
tesla,2017-6,"The company is preparing for its 10th flight of the year, and third launch in nine days, on Sunday. SpaceX has a backlog of more than 70 missions, worth more than $10 billion, spokesman Taylor said."

tesla,2017-6,"WASHINGTON, June 27 (Reuters) - Republicans and Democrats in Congress sparred on Tuesday over U.S. states setting rules for testing and deployment of self-driving cars and a proposal to allow automakers and technology companies to bypass existing regulations in introducing autonomous cars."
tesla,2017-6,Democrats on a U.S. House Energy and Commerce subcommittee said that the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) must play a more aggressive role in mandating self-driving car safety.
tesla,2017-6,"A Republican draft package of 14 bills would allow NHTSA to exempt up to 100,000 vehicles per year from federal motor vehicle safety rules, which currently prevent the sale of self-driving vehicles without human controls. It would also bar states from setting self-driving rules and prevent NHTSA from preapproving self-driving car technologies. [nL1N1JC229]"
tesla,2017-6,"""We simply cannot have cars that stop at state lines,"" Representative Robert Latta said at a hearing of the subcommittee. ""This isn't the government saying you have to get in a self-driving car. This is government make sure that industry can innovate."""
tesla,2017-6,Latta said he hoped to win committee approval of a bipartisan legislative package by the end of July.
tesla,2017-6,"General Motors Co , Alphabet Inc , Tesla Inc and others have been lobbying Congress to pre-empt rules under consideration in California and other states that could limit self-driving vehicle deployment."
tesla,2017-6,"Representative Frank Pallone, a Democrat, said that under the Republican proposal, states would be barred from regulating self-driving car safety ""without a guarantee that NHTSA will step in"" to set binding rules. ""We need to be sure that we get this right and that safety is the first priority,"" Pallone said."
tesla,2017-6,"Democrats noted that the administration of President Donald Trump, a Republican, has not nominated a candidate to head NHTSA, which has a number of vacant senior positions. NHTSA did not sent an official to testify."

tesla,2017-6,"PARIS/DETROIT, June 26 (Reuters) - British sports car maker Aston Martin has scaled back production plans for its first electric model after cash-strapped investment partner LeEco pulled out of the project, Chief Executive Andy Palmer told Reuters on Monday."
tesla,2017-6,"The result, though, may be an even more exclusive car, aimed at customers who consider Tesla's top of the range $130,000 Model S to be a little too run of the mill."
tesla,2017-6,"Aston Martin will build only 155 of its RapidE, about a third of the initial plan, and lean more heavily on Formula One engineering specialist Williams after the withdrawal of Chinese TV and smartphone vendor LeEco, Palmer said."
tesla,2017-6,The setback and Aston's response underscore the challenges and risks niche carmakers face as they scramble to address future demand for electrification from consumers and regulators.
tesla,2017-6,"While the privately held Aston Martin brand benefits from the endorsement of fictitious spy James Bond, it lacks the backing of a large automotive parent that many rivals enjoy."
tesla,2017-6,"""We've decided to make this car rare, which will obviously tend to push the price higher,"" Palmer said. ""Aston Martin now plans to proceed independently, funding further development of RapidE by ourselves."""
tesla,2017-6,Palmer agreed to be interviewed after sources told Reuters Aston Martin's partnership with LeEco had unravelled.
tesla,2017-6,"Unveiling the alliance in February last year, LeEco and Aston pledged to launch an all-electric version of the Rapide S sedan in 2018. But the Chinese conglomerate has since slashed its electric car investments, including its U.S. startup Faraday Future's planned $1.3 billion factory in Nevada. [nL1N1FM0P4]"
tesla,2017-6,"Some Faraday suppliers, including seat maker Futuris and media provider Mill Group, have sued the company for non-payment, according to court records. [nL1N1FM0P4]"
tesla,2017-6,Spokesmen for LeEco and Faraday did not respond to requests for comment on the end of the Aston partnership. Aston Martin declined to discuss its partner's business.
tesla,2017-6,"Aston returned to profit in the first quarter, a decade after it was sold by Ford . Now owned by private equity groups Investindustrial and Kuwait's Investment Dar, the company is rolling out a new model each year under a taut recovery plan drawn up by Palmer, who joined from Nissan <7201.T> in 2014."
tesla,2017-6,"Without LeEco's backing, the sports carmaker, based in Gaydon, Warwickshire, is pushing ahead as sole investor in the electric car, after paring down production and pushing back the launch date to 2019. The plan won board approval on June 21."
tesla,2017-6,"Aston will start taking orders next month with 10 percent down payments on the RapidE, priced just shy of 200,000 pounds ($255,000) in its home market before incentives. That's a significant premium on the 150,000 pound entry ticket for its V12 model, whose 5.9-litre engine develops 470 horsepower."
tesla,2017-6,"Batteries will come from a new production facility built by a consortium led by Williams Advanced Engineering, the F1 team's technical division, with matched British government funding."
tesla,2017-6,"Williams, which supplies power packs to the Formula E electric car racing series, also built the RapidE prototype unveiled in 2015."
tesla,2017-6,"Beyond the RapidE, Aston's first full-production battery car will be an electric version of the DBX crossover it is launching in 2019 - hoping for a repeat of the success that greeted its DB11 coupe, with a little help from the latest Bond film."
tesla,2017-6,"""The RapidE project was always about learning in readiness for the DBX derivative,"" Palmer said. ""We can do that through a limited series."" ($1 = 0.7858 pounds)"

tesla,2017-6,"WASHINGTON, June 23 (Reuters) - Automakers are using tiny cameras, sensors to track drooping heads, steering wheel monitors and audible alerts to ensure drivers pay attention when using advanced driver assistance systems, like Tesla's Autopilot, that allow drivers to take their hands off the wheel."
tesla,2017-6,"In a report this week on the May 2016 crash of a Tesla Inc Model S that killed a driver who was using Autopilot, the National Transportation Safety Board demonstrated that users could mostly keep their hands off the wheel for extended periods despite repeated warnings from the vehicle."
tesla,2017-6,"But the crash underscored a vexing problem for automakers that want to gain an edge by launching technology that completely automates driving tasks. Unless a car is capable of driving itself safely in every situation, drivers will still have to remain alert and ready to take control even if the car is piloting itself."
tesla,2017-6,"The NTSB, the federal agency charged with investigating significant transportation accidents, said during a 37-minute section of the 41-minute Tesla trip, the driver kept his hands on the wheel for just 25 seconds, putting his hands on the wheel for one- to- three second increments after getting repeated visual and audible warnings."
tesla,2017-6,General Motors Co delayed introduction of a driver assistance technology called Super Cruise that was initially planned for late last year because it said it was not ready. The technology will go on sale this fall.
tesla,2017-6,"Barry Walkup, chief engineer of Super Cruise, said the company added ""a driver attention function, to insist on driver supervision."""
tesla,2017-6,The system uses a small camera that focuses on the driver and works with infrared lights to track head position to determine where the driver is looking.
tesla,2017-6,"If the system - which uses facial recognition software - detects the driver is not paying attention, it will prompt the driver to return attention to the road. If the driver does not respond, it will escalate alerts, including a steering wheel light bar, visual indicators, tactile alerts in the seat and audible alerts. If the driver does not respond, the vehicle is brought to a controlled stop."
tesla,2017-6,"Volkswagen AG's luxury Audi unit has a system that handles steering and braking at speeds of up to 40 miles. The system requires the driver to check in with the steering wheel every 15 seconds. Audi said the system will beep alerts at the driver, and if the driver does not respond, it will bring the vehicle to a stop."
tesla,2017-6,"The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which is the lead agency for regulating self-driving cars, does not test or preapprove driver assistance systems before automakers install them. Instead, the agency responds to complaints or crashes when it investigates whether a potential defect poses an unreasonable risk to driver safety. The May 2016 Tesla accident has raised concerns about the regulation of self-driving cars. [nL4N19N3TN]"
tesla,2017-6,"The NTSB will issue probable cause findings and may make recommendations to the NHTSA in the Tesla crash but does not plan to hold a public hearing on the incident, spokesman Keith Holloway said."
tesla,2017-6,"In September 2016, Tesla unveiled new restrictions on Autopilot after widespread concerns the system lulled users into a false sense of security through its ""hands-off"" driving capability."
tesla,2017-6,The updated system temporarily prevents drivers from using the system if they do not respond to audible warnings to take back control of the car.
tesla,2017-6,"The car sounds warnings if drivers take their hands off the wheel for more than a minute at speeds above 45 miles per hour (72 kph) when there is no vehicle ahead, Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk told reporters in September. If the driver ignores three audible warnings in an hour, the system temporarily shuts off until it is parked."
tesla,2017-6,"Musk said at the time that autopilot accidents are far more likely for expert users of the system, saying some users got as many as 10 warnings in an hour under the prior system. ""It's not the neophytes, it's the experts. They get very comfortable with it and repeatedly ignore the car's warnings and in effect it becomes like a reflex action,"" Musk said."
tesla,2017-6,"Tesla monitors drivers through their interactions with the steering wheel, turn signal, and speed setting, NHTSA said in a separate report."
tesla,2017-6,"Alphabet Inc's Waymo unit, which is also working on self-driving technology, is taking a different approach, arguing that asking drivers to pay attention while the car drives itself is wrong.

tesla,2017-6,"KINSHASA, June 23 (Reuters) - With Western companies in Democratic Republic of Congo treading carefully in the face of political turbulence and a worsening business climate, Canada's First Cobalt Corp is an unlikely newcomer to the central African nation's mining scene."
tesla,2017-6,"Several of the Toronto-based firm's workers are former employees of First Quantum Minerals , whose prized Kolwezi project was expropriated in 2010 in an episode that underscored the risks of investing in Congo."
tesla,2017-6,"But for First Cobalt CEO Trent Mell, the logic of entering a country responsible for nearly two thirds of global cobalt output as the electric vehicle market booms is simple."
tesla,2017-6,"""The bottom line is: No DRC, no Tesla ,"" he said, referring to the U.S. automaker. ""You can't fill the void when you have 64 percent of production coming out of the DRC."""
tesla,2017-6,"Demand for the metal, a key component in the lithium-ion batteries that power electric cars and mobile phones, is surging. Consultancy CRU Group say electric car and plug-in hybrid vehicle sales could quadruple to 4.4 million in 2021."
tesla,2017-6,"The market is so promising, Mell said, he is ditching the traditional model of treating cobalt as a by-product of metals such as copper or nickel and is basing investment decisions primarily on sites' cobalt potential."
tesla,2017-6,"""We apply the lens of our exploration efforts and strategy around where are we going to find cobalt,"" he said. ""We're able to cross - whether it be cobalt-silver, cobalt-copper, maybe even cobalt-nickel."""
tesla,2017-6,"CRU consultant Edward Spencer said there was only one active primary cobalt mine, in Morocco, and only a handful of others in development. Cobalt concentrations are typically too low compared with copper or nickel to justify prioritising them."
tesla,2017-6,"Last month, First Cobalt signed a letter of intent with Madini Minerals, a private Africa-focused mining firm, for a 70 percent controlling interest in seven prospective copper-cobalt properties in southeastern Congo for about $1.6 million."
tesla,2017-6,"The investments are the first overseas foray by the company, formerly known as Aurgent Resource Corp, after investing this year in a silver and cobalt mine in northern Ontario."
tesla,2017-6,"Mell said preliminary prospecting would begin in two to three months, though production is at least five years off."
tesla,2017-6,"First Cobalt is bucking a trend of western wariness of Congo, now in one of its worst political crises in a generation."

tesla,2017-6,"The southeastern mining zones near Zambia have been spared the fighting so far, though mining companies there have complained of harassment by revenue-starved taxmen. [nL8N1IZ4HZ]"
tesla,2017-6,"Last year, Freeport McMoRan [FCXFM.UL] sold off its majority stake in the Tenke copper mine, one of the world's largest. It cited a desire to reduce debts, though analysts say the operating environment played an important role in the decision."
tesla,2017-6,"Chinese investors, including Zijin Mining <601899.SS> and China Molybdenum <603993.SS> have stepped into the void and now control 43 percent of global refined cobalt material, according to CRU's Spencer."
tesla,2017-6,"Several First Cobalt workers, including its vice-president for exploration, are intimately familiar with operating in Congo from their time with First Quantum."
tesla,2017-6,"In 2010, the government expropriated the company's Kolwezi project, in which it had invested $750 million, after a protracted contract review."
tesla,2017-6,"Mell said that for the former First Quantum staff, their first taste of Congo had only whetted their appetite."
tesla,2017-6,"""I think they thought they had some unfinished work when they were forced to leave the country,"" he said. ""This is truly incredible geology. The opportunity for a game-changing discovery in the DRC is hard to replicate elsewhere."""

tesla,2017-6,"HONG KONG, June 19 (Reuters Breakingviews) - LeEco showcases China's tech hubris up close. Jia Yueting's outfit aimed to be Netflix , Apple and Tesla all in one. But when overconfident founders have a free rein and easy money, the results rarely make comfortable viewing."
tesla,2017-6,"LeEco is known in China for taking on the dominant trio of Baidu , Alibaba and Tencent <0700.HK>. Its flagship business, Shenzhen-listed Leshi Internet <300104.SZ>, operates a popular video-streaming platform that also sells televisions and smartphones. Its big idea was bundling content subscriptions with cheap TVs."
tesla,2017-6,"Borrowing against his shares in the $9 billion Leshi, Jia then partly financed the broader group's expansion into movies, ride-hailing, and electric vehicles. LeEco also sold investment products online to retail investors, and spun out sports and cloud technology arms, bringing in big-name outside investors."
tesla,2017-6,"But Jia overstretched. Now, his cash-strapped outfits have been forced to sell property, scrap a $2 billion acquisition, slash jobs and pull back abroad. Unpaid bills have cost his companies key sports rights and even, local media say, prompted sit-in protests by suppliers."
tesla,2017-6,"LeEco was uniquely ambitious. But its roller-coaster ride speaks volumes about Chinese tech. In fields like e-commerce and gaming, growth is breakneck and fortunes have been made very quickly. Outfits like Huawei [HWT.UL] and BYD <002594.SZ> <1211.HK> have quickly become major players in fields such as handsets and electric vehicles. No wonder investors, keen to back the next big thing, took LeEco so seriously."
tesla,2017-6,"Capital is abundant too. Last year, venture capital, private equity and other investment funds raised 1.4 trillion yuan ($202 billion), up 75 percent from 2015, according to Zero2IPO Research. To make things worse, Chinese tech bosses, like their U.S. counterparts, are rarely held in check by robust governance. It is unlikely that Jia's wild schemes met much pushback."
tesla,2017-6,"Now shareholders are stepping in. In January, developer Sunac <1918.HK> ploughed $2.2 billion into Leshi and two subsidiaries. Jia stepped down as chief executive of the video unit, although he remains chairman. Meanwhile, investors in LeEco's sports unit are forming a committee for daily oversight and financial supervision. For Jia, who wanted to be Reed Hastings, Steve Jobs and Elon Musk all at once, micromanagement will be a difficult adjustment."
tesla,2017-6,"- Leshi Internet Information & Technology, which operates a popular online video platform in China, said on June 8 it had scrapped a plan to issue 2 billion yuan ($294 million) of bonds."
tesla,2017-6,"- Leshi is the listed unit of LeEco, a conglomerate founded by Jia Yueting. The broader group, which has interests spanning electric cars, televisions, smartphones, movie production, and video streaming, has been scaling back on operations in the United States and India amid a cash shortage."
tesla,2017-6,"- On June 6, Chinese advertising agency MIG Unmobi Technology sued Leshi and three other affiliates over advertising contract disputes, according to a company filing. MIG says it is owed 62.9 million yuan."
tesla,2017-6,"- Separately, more than 20 mobile phone component suppliers staged a protest at Leshi's Beijing headquarters demanding to be repaid on June 2, Caixin reported."

tesla,2017-6,"NEW YORK/WASHINGTON, June 15 (Reuters) - Takata Corp <7312.T>, the Japanese company facing billions in liabilities stemming from its defective air bag inflators, is preparing to file for bankruptcy as early as next week as it works toward a deal for financial backing from U.S. auto parts maker Key Safety Systems Inc, sources said on Thursday."
tesla,2017-6,"Takata, one of the world's biggest automotive suppliers, has been working for months to complete a deal with Key Safety."
tesla,2017-6,A person briefed on the matter told Reuters Key was expected to acquire Takata assets as part of a restructuring in bankruptcy.
tesla,2017-6,"The Nikkei business daily reported that a new company created under Key will purchase Takata operations for about 180 billion yen ($1.6 billion) and continue supplying air bags, seat belts and other products, leaving liabilities behind in a separate entity."

tesla,2017-6,Also at stake is $850 million owed by Takata to major global automakers under a settlement agreed to earlier this year stemming from the automotive industry's largest ever safety recall.
tesla,2017-6,"Sources familiar with the matter, who asked for anonymity because they were not authorized to speak with the media, said a final deal with Key may not be reached before Takata files for bankruptcy. The company plans to begin proceedings in both the United States and Japan, the sources said."
tesla,2017-6,Major global car manufacturers have expressed concern about the company filing for bankruptcy without a deal in place because of disruption it could cause to the production of replacement air bag inflators. More than 65 percent of 46.2 million recalled Takata air bag inflators in the United States have not been repaired.

tesla,2017-6,"Last week, state legislators passed the bill, which requires utilities to purchase excess power generated from rooftop solar panels at near the full retail rate [nL1N1J21I0]. Known as net metering, the buy-back policy is critical to making residential solar affordable."
tesla,2017-6,Both Tesla and Sunrun said they would resume sales in Nevada if Sandoval signed the bill. He did so on Thursday during a ceremony held at a Tesla facility in Las Vegas.
tesla,2017-6,"Solar companies cheered the reopening of the Nevada market, which comes as growth of residential solar has slowed in many key states, including top market California."
tesla,2017-6,"In a speech at the signing ceremony, Tesla Chief Technical Officer JB Straubel said the new legislation would ""bring in thousands of jobs and millions of dollars in positive economic benefit"" to Nevada ""over time."" Tesla would resume selling systems immediately, he added."
tesla,2017-6,"Nevada scrapped its previous net metering policy at the end of 2015, prompting Tesla unit SolarCity and Sunrun to abandon what was at the time a major solar market. The move, which led to a 32 percent decline in solar installation jobs in the state last year, was broadly unpopular with Nevada residents."
tesla,2017-6,Opponents of net metering argue that forcing utilities to pay high rates for rooftop solar in effect means that customers who do not have solar panels subsidize those who do.

tesla,2017-6,"NEW YORK, June 8 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Tesla's shareholders have revealed their faith is blind. Even after excluding the 22 percent stake owned by founder and Chief Executive Elon Musk, a proposal forcing all seven board members to stand for election every year was rejected at this week's annual meeting. Authorizing bad corporate governance makes little sense at a company with such a lofty valuation."
tesla,2017-6,"Tesla's argument for the status quo rings hollow. It reckons directors risk being ""distracted by special interests that seek only short-term returns"" if each were to face re-election annually. But the company is losing money and has no cash to spare. Absent a highly unlikely sale, there's not much that a short-term-biased director could do."
tesla,2017-6,"Enough investors were nevertheless persuaded. That's surprising, especially considering recent history. Last year, about three-quarters of unaffiliated shareholders supported a proposal to eliminate the limited supermajority voting rules. That fell to 42 percent after factoring in Musk's block."
tesla,2017-6,"Yet Tesla's board could use a shakeup. Lead director Antonio Gracias, Steve Jurvetson and Musk's brother Kimbal all sit on the board at another Musk company, SpaceX, in which fellow director and venture capitalist Ira Ehrenpreis has invested. Gracias was also a director at SolarCity before Tesla bought it last year and runs a private-equity fund Musk backs, while Brad Buss spent seven years as SolarCity's finance chief."
tesla,2017-6,"That leaves just one member with no other obvious ties to the boss. Musk did, at least, say at Tuesday's meeting that he hopes to add some independent directors soon. Even so, shareholders are too accepting of Tesla's chummy board."
tesla,2017-6,"Of course, the company's stock also has surged over 60 percent over the past year. At a market value of $60 billion, it's worth more than both Ford and General Motors . Tesla also now trades at 30 times consensus earnings for 2020, according to Thomson Reuters data, implying astonishing growth in vehicle sales at eye-popping margins of at least 30 percent. The complete confidence of shareholders is as consistent in the market as it is at the ballot."
tesla,2017-6,"- A majority of Tesla's independent shareholders on June 6 voted against a proposal at the carmaker's annual meeting to force board directors to stand for election each year, the company revealed in a regulatory filing on June 8. Tesla currently allows its seven directors to serve three-year terms."
tesla,2017-6,"- Tesla recommended shareholders vote against the proposal, put forward by the Connecticut Retirement Plans and Trust Fund, arguing it allows directors ""to maximize the interests of the Company and our stockholders over the long-term, without being distracted by special interests that seek only short-term returns."""
tesla,2017-6,"- Holders of 74.7 million shares voted against the proposal, while 32.7 million voted in favor. After stripping out Musk's 36.1 million shares, 38.5 million independent owners rejected the amendment."
tesla,2017-6,"- Tesla stock has increased 62 percent over the past 12 months. The company is worth almost $60 billion, 36 percent more than Ford and 15 percent more than General Motors."

tesla,2017-6,"NEW YORK, June 8 (Reuters) - Addepar, a Silicon Valley-based startup that helps wealth management firms get a more comprehensive view of their clients' assets, has raised $140 million in a round led by Valor Equity Partners, 8VC and investment manager Harald McPike."
tesla,2017-6,The company said on Thursday that it will use the funding on research and development initiatives aimed at enhancing its technology.
tesla,2017-6,Addepar has developed software that helps wealth managers view information on their clients' assets that might be spread out across various accounts.
tesla,2017-6,"Ultra-wealthy clients typically hold their assets in family trusts, limited partnerships or in alternative and illiquid investments spread across several banks and accounts. This means financial advisors will often gather and compile information into one spreadsheet through a protracted process rather than meeting with clients."
tesla,2017-6,"""Wealth managers, especially the ones serving larger and more complex clients, often times have challenges in giving each client an accurate view of everything they own,"" said Eric Poirier, chief executive of Addepar, in an interview. The company's platform allows wealth management firms, with client's permission, to gather information from various accounts in one place, Poirer said."
tesla,2017-6,"Addepar is among the growing group of young technology companies that are seeking to help established financial institutions improve their technology across a wide range of functions, including anti-money laundering checks to client-interface software."
tesla,2017-6,"While the firm has so far focused on wealth management firms, Poirier said it had received inquiries from other buy-side companies such as pension funds."
tesla,2017-6,"Poirier said the firm has been growing rapidly, with its clients managing more than $650 billion through its platform, up from $300 billion 18 months ago. In January Morgan Stanley said it was rolling out Addepar's platform to 20 of its top financial advisory teams."
tesla,2017-6,"Valor Equity Partners founder and managing partner Antonio Gracias, who sits on the Addepar's board of directors, is well known for being an investor and board member in several companies of Tesla Inc founder Elon Musk."

tesla,2017-6,"CINOVEC, Czech Republic, June 7 (Reuters) - Mining for lithium could start in the Czech Republic in two years, exploiting Europe's largest resource of the metal that is used in batteries for electric vehicles and home power storage."
tesla,2017-6,"The deposits lie around Cinovec, a village with a tradition of mining since the 14th century and situated near the border with Germany, the industrial powerhouse at the heart of Europe's bid to build electric cars and develop battery technology."
tesla,2017-6,"The resource, a term used for a deposit whose extent has yet to be proven by exploration, could amount to 1.3 million tonnes, or about 3 percent of the global lithium stock, according to the Czech Geological Survey."
tesla,2017-6,"That would rank the Czech Republic behind Chile, China, Argentina, Australia and other nations with bigger lithium reserves. But surging global demand and hungry European industry are sparking international interest in the Czech deposits."
tesla,2017-6,"Australia's European Metals , which bought exploration rights around Cinovec in 2012 and wants to start mining by 2019, said the resource could yield 20,800 tonnes a year of lithium carbonate, the processed ore that is sold to customers."
tesla,2017-6,"Global demand is expected to rise three-fold to 535,000 tonnes of lithium carbonate equivalent by 2025 from 2015, due to the boom in electric cars and electricity storage that has added to demand from making mobile phone batteries, Deutsche Bank said."
tesla,2017-6,"European Metals has dug exploratory shafts and plans to spend $393 million to develop the site near Cinovec, a village surrounded by forests and meadows and showing scars of surface mining for lignite that once employed many people in the area. The region now has the Czech Republic's highest jobless rate."
tesla,2017-6,"""The permitting process is going along as it should be, everything is happening in an orderly fashion,"" European Metals Managing Director Keith Coughlan told Reuters."
tesla,2017-6,"The company has signed a memorandum on supply of lithium ore to HE3DA, a Czech startup battery producer."
tesla,2017-6,"""HE3DA can be one of the biggest consumers,"" HE3DA chief executive and founder Jan Prochazka told Reuters."
tesla,2017-6,"There are also other potential clients nearby. Daimler , owner of Mercedes-Benz, began construction in May of its second factory for lithium batteries, worth about 500 million euros, in Kamenz, a German town 90 km (56 miles) from Cinovec. [nL8N1II60D]"
tesla,2017-6,"Tesla Motors Inc. has also announced plans to build another ""Gigafactory"" for batteries, possibly in Europe, to match its plant in Nevada, the United States."
tesla,2017-6,"European Metals still has steps to take before it can develop the mining site at Cinovec. It has to apply for permits from the State Mining Administration (SMA), a process that could last more than a year, an SMA spokesman said."
tesla,2017-6,"It also needs approval from the Environment Ministry, which would consider any objections from nearby municipalities, although local communities have indicated they support the plan."
tesla,2017-6,"""It would be a contribution to our town,"" said Mayor Petr Pipal of Dubi, the municipality that includes Cinovec."
tesla,2017-6,"Cinovecka Deponie, a unit of privately-owned Czech investment group RSJ, won permits to extract lithium from tailings left around Cinovec from past tin mining. It did not offer further details when contacted by Reuters."
tesla,2017-6,"Albright Stonebridge Group, co-chaired by former U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, made enquiries to the regional authorities about possible lithium extraction, Czech media reported. The group did not respond to Reuters queries."
tesla,2017-6,"One challenge for miners is that ore around Cinovec contains relatively small amounts of lithium. Jaromir Stary, an expert at the Czech Geological Survey, said it contains four times less lithium in its ore than at the Greenbushes mine in Australia."
tesla,2017-6,"But European Metals is undeterred. Its pre-feasibility study in April estimated costs at $3,483 per tonne of lithium carbonate, a level it said would ensure it could turn a profit."
tesla,2017-6,It said the magnetic-sensitive nature of Cinovec's ore makes processing cheaper than other types.
tesla,2017-6,"Spot battery grade 99.5 percent lithium carbonate in China , where most lithium batteries are manufactured, now trades around 140,000 yuan ($20,575.53) per tonne, after a peak of about 171,000 yuan last year."

tesla,2017-6,"June 8 (Reuters) - U.S. solar installations will fall 16 percent this year, according to a forecast released on Thursday, as utilities slow procurement of projects to meet state mandates and residential systems become harder to sell."
tesla,2017-6,"Following a banner 2016 driven by expectations that a key federal tax credit would expire at the end of that year, the utility-scale market is expected to drop to 8 gigawatts this year from more than 10 GW last year, according to a report by GTM Research and the Solar Energy Industries Association."
tesla,2017-6,"The utility market, which accounts for about half of all solar systems, is expected to resume growth in 2019 as utilities seek to procure projects before the 30 percent federal tax credit for solar projects begins to step down in 2020."
tesla,2017-6,"Prices on solar systems dropped further during the first quarter, falling below $1 per watt for the first time, the report said."
tesla,2017-6,"Residential solar is expected to rise 2 percent for the year, well below the 19 percent growth it logged last year. California is experiencing a major decline in adoption of home installations that contributed to a 17 percent first-quarter drop in the nationwide market. The state accounted for 35 percent of the total U.S. market during the quarter, its lowest share since GTM began tracking the market in 2010."
tesla,2017-6,"Large national installers that make up close to half the market, like Tesla Inc's SolarCity and Vivint Solar Inc , have slowed growth to focus on profitability."
tesla,2017-6,"Residential markets in New York, Massachusetts and Maryland also fell during the quarter as installers found it was taking longer to win over customers beyond the early adopters."
tesla,2017-6,"The market for non-residential solar, which includes commercial and community solar installations, rose 30 percent in the first quarter thanks in part to a robust community solar market in Minnesota and growth in New York."
tesla,2017-6,"GTM would revise its forecasts downward, it warned, if a petition by bankrupt solar manufacturer Suniva to implement a 78-cents-per-watt floor on solar module pricing is approved by the U.S. International Trade Commission. U.S. module prices were around 40 cents a watt in the first quarter."
tesla,2017-6,"Suniva filed a rare Section 201 petition with the ITC last month, seeking new duties on imported solar products to combat a global oversupply of panels that has depressed prices. If successful, the petition would put solar system costs at 2015 levels, according to GTM."

tesla,2017-6,"CINOVEC, Czech Republic, June 7 (Reuters) - Mining for lithium could start in the Czech Republic in two years, exploiting Europe's largest resource of the metal that is used in batteries for electric vehicles and home power storage."
tesla,2017-6,"The deposits lie around Cinovec, a village with a tradition of mining since the 14th century and situated near the border with Germany, the industrial powerhouse at the heart of Europe's bid to build electric cars and develop battery technology."
tesla,2017-6,"The resource, a term used for a deposit whose extent has yet to be proven by exploration, could amount to 1.3 million tonnes, or about 3 percent of the global lithium stock, according to the Czech Geological Survey."
tesla,2017-6,"That would rank the Czech Republic behind Chile, China, Argentina, Australia and other nations with bigger lithium reserves. But surging global demand and hungry European industry are sparking international interest in the Czech deposits."
tesla,2017-6,"Australia's European Metals , which bought exploration rights around Cinovec in 2012 and wants to start mining by 2019, said the resource could yield 20,800 tonnes a year of lithium carbonate, the processed ore that is sold to customers."
tesla,2017-6,"Global demand is expected to rise three-fold to 535,000 tonnes of lithium carbonate equivalent by 2025 from 2015, due to the boom in electric cars and electricity storage that has added to demand from making mobile phone batteries, Deutsche Bank said."
tesla,2017-6,"European Metals has dug exploratory shafts and plans to spend $393 million to develop the site near Cinovec, a village surrounded by forests and meadows and showing scars of surface mining for lignite that once employed many people in the area. The region now has the Czech Republic's highest jobless rate."
tesla,2017-6,"""The permitting process is going along as it should be, everything is happening in an orderly fashion,"" European Metals Managing Director Keith Coughlan told Reuters."
tesla,2017-6,"The company has signed a memorandum on supply of lithium ore to HE3DA, a Czech startup battery producer."

tesla,2017-6,"Tesla Motors Inc. has also announced plans to build another ""Gigafactory"" for batteries, possibly in Europe, to match its plant in Nevada, the United States."
tesla,2017-6,"European Metals still has steps to take before it can develop the mining site at Cinovec. It has to apply for permits from the State Mining Administration (SMA), a process that could last more than a year, an SMA spokesman said."

tesla,2017-6,"Cinovecka Deponie, a unit of privately-owned Czech investment group RSJ, won permits to extract lithium from tailings left around Cinovec from past tin mining. It did not offer further details when contacted by Reuters."
tesla,2017-6,"Albright Stonebridge Group, co-chaired by former U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, made enquiries to the regional authorities about possible lithium extraction, Czech media reported. The group did not respond to Reuters queries."
tesla,2017-6,"One challenge for miners is that ore around Cinovec contains relatively small amounts of lithium. Jaromir Stary, an expert at the Czech Geological Survey, said it contains four times less lithium in its ore than at the Greenbushes mine in Australia."

tesla,2017-6,"Assembly Bill 405, which supporters say they expect Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval to sign in coming days, would require electric utilities to purchase excess power generated from their customers' rooftop solar installations at near the full retail rate.

tesla,2017-6,"WASHINGTON, June 1 (Reuters) - More than 65 percent of 46.2 million recalled Takata Corp <7312.T> airbag inflators in the United States have not been repaired, a U.S. senator said on Thursday, urging automakers to speed up the pace of repairs."
tesla,2017-6,"Senator Bill Nelson of Florida said only 15.8 million inflators out of 46.2 million inflators recalled to date have been repaired through mid-May, though nationwide recalls began in 2015. He was citing answers submitted from a National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) independent monitor."
tesla,2017-6,"About 8.8 million owners had received recall notices, Nelson said, but they were told no replacement parts were currently available."
tesla,2017-6,"The affected Takata inflators can explode with excessive force, unleashing metal shrapnel inside cars and trucks. They have been blamed for at least 16 deaths and more than 180 injuries worldwide."

tesla,2017-6,"Takata spokesman Jared Levy said the company ""has dramatically increased the production of airbag replacement kits."" Takata has shipped over 26 million replacement kits, two-thirds of which include inflators manufactured by other suppliers, Levy said."
tesla,2017-6,"Last month, four automakers involved in the recalls agreed to a $553 million settlement covering owners of nearly 16 million vehicles with Takata airbag inflators, and agreed to take new steps to encourage owners to get recall repairs made. [nL2N1IL1O0]"

tesla,2017-6,"In February, Takata pleaded guilty to U.S. charges of criminal wrongdoing and to pay $1 billion to resolve a federal investigation into its inflators."
tesla,2017-6,"The majority of the air bag-related fatalities and injuries have occurred in the United States, and most of them in Honda vehicles."
tesla,2017-6,"Automakers have recalled 46 million Takata air bag inflators in 29 million U.S. vehicles. By 2019, automakers will recall 64 million to 69 million U.S. inflators in 42 million total vehicles, NHTSA said in December."

tesla,2017-6,"PARIS, June 1 (Reuters) - Three shareholder activist groups have asked the French market regulator to investigate Renault-Nissan <7201.T> boss Carlos Ghosn's potential conflicts of interest and possible breaches of governance by the carmaking alliance."
tesla,2017-6,"Proxinvest, which advises investors how to vote on corporate governance issues, and U.S. activist CtW, put their case for a Renault-Nissan review in a 24-page letter to the French AMF market watchdog."
tesla,2017-6,"The Renault-Nissan move comes at a sensitive time for Ghosn, 63, whose pay package was rejected by shareholders in 2016 and faces a new vote at a June 15 annual general meeting."
tesla,2017-6,"The letter, also signed by RAIR, an association of French pension fund trustees, details claims that Renault failed to inform shareholders adequately about a transfer of decision-making powers to its Renault-Nissan BV (RNBV) joint venture, or to respect the procedure for their renewal in 2012 for 10 years."
tesla,2017-6,"It also points to potential conflicts of interest arising from Ghosn's various roles. He is chairman and chief executive of Renault as well as chairman of both Mitsubishi and Nissan, where he also served as CEO until earlier this year."
