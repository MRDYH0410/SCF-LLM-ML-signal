Sinopec Group,2017-8,"BEIJING, Sept 8 (Reuters) - A group of independent Chinese oil refiners is clubbing together to survive an onslaught by state-owned giants and the rise of private chemical giants, but industry analysts said the new alliance may find it hard to stick."

Sinopec Group,2017-8,"SINGAPORE/JAKARTA, Sept 4 (Reuters) - Indonesia's Pertamina [PERTM.UL] has received a license from the government to export gasoil for the first time, three sources close to the matter said on Monday, although the state oil company is planning to prioritize domestic sales if possible."
Sinopec Group,2017-8,"Pertamina is typically an importer of gasoil, as diesel is called in most Asian markets, but inbound shipments have declined over the years as it ramped up refining output and demand from the mining sector slowed."
Sinopec Group,2017-8,"With other gasoil sellers - such as Royal Dutch Shell , Exxon Mobil Corp and Solaris Prima Energy - crowding into the retail market, and an increased biodiesel mandate in 2016 reducing conventional consumption, Pertamina's supply of the fuel has also outperformed demand, said Toharso, director of refineries at Pertamina, who goes by one name."

Sinopec Group,2017-8,"The company, though, is also taking steps to sell more gasoil into its domestic market by asking the government to grant it a monopoly on diesel imports, which would force the other retailers to buy from Pertamina."

Sinopec Group,2017-8,Pertamina declined to give details on possible export volumes or a timeline of shipments.
Sinopec Group,2017-8,"Pertamina supplies about 70 percent of Indonesia's gasoil needs, while private firms supply the rest, Toharso said."
Sinopec Group,2017-8,"Many of the private firms import their gasoil, but Pertamina is lobbying Jakarta to name it the country's exclusive importer of the fuel, a move that would alleviate the state oil company's surplus and possibly negate its need to export the fuel."
Sinopec Group,2017-8,"""Pertamina is encouraging the Energy Ministry to make other companies not to import gasoil and just buy it from Pertamina,"" said Toharso."
Sinopec Group,2017-8,Indonesia's Energy Ministry did not address a Reuters query asking if it will approve Pertamina's request.
Sinopec Group,2017-8,"Dadan Kusdiana, a spokesman for the ministry said it will ""encourage (retail) companies to purchase from Pertamina first before they import."""
Sinopec Group,2017-8,"""Pertamina has also sent an offer letter to other (retail) companies that need gasoil,"" Kusdiana said."

Sinopec Group,2017-8,"The country's largest refiner reported a first-half net profit attributable to equity shareholders of 27.1 billion yuan ($4.08 billion), up 40.7 percent on a year prior, based on Chinese accounting standards. Revenue for the period rose 32.6 percent to 1.166 trillion yuan."

Sinopec Group,2017-8,{{20170815T042505.620+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-Xi throws a bad Party for Hong Kong investors(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.)
Sinopec Group,2017-8,"HONG KONG, Aug 15 (Reuters Breakingviews) - The Communist Party is tightening its grip on state-owned enterprises listed in Hong Kong. Beijing has usually set the agenda at SOEs anyway. But injecting yet more of President Xi Jinping's muddled market strategy into decision-making could cost investors."
Sinopec Group,2017-8,"This year, numerous state-owned giants of finance, energy, telecoms and infrastructure have edited their articles of association to give an explicit role to internal Party committees. These bodies have traditionally sat within an SOE, monitoring the company's ideological soundness, but their influence had waned until recently. The trend is part of a wider push over several years to re-emphasise such organisations, and insert them into private companies."
Sinopec Group,2017-8,"That Beijing is making Party influence over offshore listed companies more explicit under Xi should come as no surprise. Two years ago, officials swapped the chief executives of China Unicom <0762.HK> and China Telecom <0728.HK> around without explanation. Now that Xi has sidelined his pro-market Premier Li Keqiang, talk about giving markets a ""decisive role"" has also been muffled."
Sinopec Group,2017-8,"It is understandable that Xi might see tighter control over SOEs - infamous squanderers of taxpayer money - as a way to force-feed efficiency upgrades. How the change will play out operationally is unclear, however. The adjustment at oil giant Sinopec <0386.HK>, for example, calls for the board of directors to ""seek advice"" when making decisions on ""significant matters."" The Party will also give input on management candidates."
Sinopec Group,2017-8,"This does not oblige the board to follow those recommendations, and in practice much may depend on personalities and factional alliances. In the past the central government has struggled to leash big SOEs with powerful allies. A weak committee inside a strong SOE will not have much influence."
Sinopec Group,2017-8,"This is nonetheless a backward step in corporate governance. These ideologues hail from the same unaccountable political system that has presided over a massive run-up in corporate debt; that tried and failed to salvage stock markets in 2015; and has a poor record of picking winners. Outsiders will have little visibility into the way cadres interact with management. The committees may revel in their new mandate, but investors are not invited to this Party."
Sinopec Group,2017-8,- Chinese state-owned enterprises listed in Hong Kong have been adding language into their articles of association specifying that Communist Party committees inside companies should be given a voice in decisions.
Sinopec Group,2017-8,- This is part of a wider campaign under President Xi Jinping to increase the presence and importance of party committees inside both state-owned and private companies in China.

Sinopec Group,2017-8,"SINGAPORE/BEIJING, Aug 4 (Reuters) - China is on pace to overtake the United States as the world's biggest oil importer this year, cementing its status as Asia's most pivotal oil market actor that will increasingly dominate the region's fuel trade."
Sinopec Group,2017-8,"For the first time, China imported more crude oil in the first half of the year than the U.S., government statistics showed. China averaged 8.55 million barrels per day (bpd) versus 8.12 million bpd in the U.S., a trend that is expected to last. [nL4N1K41JQ] [nL3N1KG1TT]"
Sinopec Group,2017-8,"The shift highlights the change in the centre of gravity in global oil markets from West to East. Chinese state-run oil trader Unipec is now the world's biggest physical oil trader. By drawing more of the world's oil to its shores, China, the second-biggest oil consumer after the U.S., will play a crucial role in setting the global price of the commodity, especially as the crude futures market in Shanghai develops. [nL3N1H521X][nL3N1JW1HB]"
Sinopec Group,2017-8,"China's import surge is being driven by the expansion of its refinery capacity. But, as the domestic demand has not materialized to soak up the fuel supply, China's exports of gasoline and diesel have climbed to record highs. This flood of products has caused headaches for competitors across Asia and depressed diesel profit margins to multi-year lows in 2016. [nL4N1HV02J] [nL3N1KG1E2] [nB9N1FA00G]"
Sinopec Group,2017-8,"""China is putting a lot of pressure on the traditional export hubs of Taiwan, Korea and Singapore to capture the market share within Southeast Asia and Australia,"" said Joe Willis, senior research analyst, Asia refining, at energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie."
Sinopec Group,2017-8,The trend of more refining capacity and higher exports is set to continue.
Sinopec Group,2017-8,"China plans to add at least 2.5 million bpd of refining capacity by 2020, according to a recent presentation from China Petroleum & Chemical Corp, or Sinopec. Sinopec is Asia's biggest oil refiner and the parent of Unipec."
Sinopec Group,2017-8,"This year, PetroChina Ltd will start a 260,000 bpd refinery in Yunnan in southern China while China National Offshore Oil Corp will start up a 200,000 bpd expansion at its existing Huizhou plant in Guangdong province. The start ups will add 350,000 bpd of new Chinese capacity in 2017 though both plants will not reach full capacity until 2018."
Sinopec Group,2017-8,"Exports of gasoline from China are expected to increase by at least 10,000 barrels per day this year from 2016, driving overseas gasoline sales to between 235,000 bpd and 240,000 bpd this year and about 330,000 bpd in 2018, estimates from consultants FGE and Wood Mackenzie showed."
Sinopec Group,2017-8,"Unipec is leading the way in targeting new overseas markets, moving jet fuel from Singapore to northwest Europe in June for the first time in several years.

Sinopec Group,2017-8,China and India have eclipsed Japan as Asia's biggest oil consumer. Japanese refiners are consolidating capacity because of a falling population and the increasing use of alternative fuels in the power and transportation sector has cut oil consumption. [nL4N1IE2IV]

Sinopec Group,2017-8,A slowdown in Chinese domestic fuel demand as people use more electric vehicles or co-share bicycles and scooters has pushed refiners to export more gasoline.
