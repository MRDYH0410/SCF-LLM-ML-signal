General Motors,2017-3,"NEW YORK, March 30 (Reuters Breakingviews) - The activist's proposal that the automaker split its stock to give some shareholders a perpetual dividend is a risky maneuver. President Trump's plan for skilled-worker visas may make Canada great again. Plus, Republicans face high hurdles to overhaul the U.S. tax code."

General Motors,2017-3,"NEW YORK, March 30 (Reuters) - Hedge fund manager David Einhorn's unusual plan to divide General Motors Co's shares into two classes poses a potential corporate governance minefield for GM board members."
General Motors,2017-3,"The shareholder proposal, quickly rejected by the company this week, is aimed at boosting a lagging stock price, but did not appear to catch fire with other existing or prospective shareholders, who see it as an odd mix of hybrid security schemes."
General Motors,2017-3,"The plan would create one class of stock for investors keen to capture GM's juicy dividend, and a second for those eager to bet on its growth potential."
General Motors,2017-3,"Einhorn, who runs New York-based Greenlight Capital, has pledged to fight for it at the company's annual meeting and plans to nominate a slate of directors ready to advance his idea."
General Motors,2017-3,"One obstacle cited by legal and financial advisers is the probable conflict it presents for GM's directors, who under Delaware law are required to be loyal to all shareholders. That could get tricky under Einhorn's plan as directors would oversee two classes of stock that each have voting powers but competing ambitions for use of company capital."
General Motors,2017-3,"For instance, directors would have to square voting to raise quarterly payouts, which would exclusively benefit the dividend stock holders, versus allocating more toward capital expenditures or stock repurchases, which would benefit the growth stock camp."
General Motors,2017-3,"""It puts the board in an odd position,"" said Charles Elson, a University of Delaware corporate governance professor who also sits on the board of restaurant chain Bob Evans Farms Inc . ""Do you plow money back into the business, or buy back the stock? You end up penalizing at least one of the stock holders. It gets messy."""
General Motors,2017-3,"Dividend holders would get one-tenth of a vote under the Einhorn plan, while the so called ""capital appreciation"" owners would have a full share."
General Motors,2017-3,"While all public company boards encounter tension when evaluating short- and long-term goals, ""separating out dividend-paying shares makes those tensions explicit, pitting actually different stockholders against each other,"" Delaware Law School professor Larry Hamermesh said."
General Motors,2017-3,Hamermesh added that such a structure could become more troublesome in terms of conflicts if the board's stock holdings were concentrated more in one class of stock.
General Motors,2017-3,Investors - even some GM holders frustrated by its persistent underperformance since its shares returned to public markets in 2010 after a wrenching reorganization in bankruptcy - were not immediately lining up in support of Einhorn's idea.
General Motors,2017-3,"""I agree completely that the stock is undervalued, but I'm not sure that splitting it into two classes is going to drive it any higher,"" said Scott Moore, co-portfolio manager of the Buffalo Dividend Focus fund, who owns shares of GM."
General Motors,2017-3,Moore said he doesn't want to have to choose between dividend income and stock price appreciation. He wants both.
General Motors,2017-3,"So far, GM shares have not seen a big response to the Einhorn proposal. The stock gained about 2.5 percent on Tuesday after it was made public but ended little changed on Wednesday. [nL3N1H54NI]"
General Motors,2017-3,"Mark Freeman, chief investment officer of Westwood Holdings Group, who does not own GM, said he would not buy a dividend-focused share class that was not a preferred stock. Preferreds stand between common shares and debt in a company capital structure and offer a greater likelihood that investors will have a claim on assets in the event of a bankruptcy."
General Motors,2017-3,"Einhorn's plan has flavors of several existing hybrid equity security types, such as tracking stocks, perpetual preferred shares and master limited partnerships, but does not exactly replicate any of them."
General Motors,2017-3,"To some degree, it harkens back to independent share trusts called ""primes"" and ""scores,"" equity derivative securities that were popular in the late 1980s and early 1990s."
General Motors,2017-3,"As under the Einhorn plan, investors interested in the stability provided by dividends could own a company's prime trusts, while those willing to take on more risk and bet on its growth could buy the scores."
General Motors,2017-3,"The key difference, however, was that the trusts were established by shareholders, not the companies issuing the underlying stock. Companies themselves had no involvement at all, and their shares were not formally divided into two classes as Einhorn's proposal provides."
General Motors,2017-3,The trusts phased out in the early 90s following a disadvantageous change in tax rules.
General Motors,2017-3,GM itself has had multiple share structures in the past.
General Motors,2017-3,"In the mid-1980s, the automaker made two splashy diversification moves, acquiring Electronic Data Systems Corp, a pioneering computer services company founded by future presidential candidate H. Ross Perot, and later Hughes Aircraft, the defense and satellite company founded by billionaire Howard Hughes."
General Motors,2017-3,"GM then set up tracking stocks for each of the units. GM Class E shares, for EDS, and GM Class H shares, for Hughes, gave holders a dividend based on the profits of each operation, but no ownership stake."
General Motors,2017-3,GM's own history suggests there are ways around the potential conflict posed by dual share classes.
General Motors,2017-3,"In a 2005 case in Delaware Chancery Court, the company acknowledged that the board had an internal policy toward handling different shareholders when GM had a tracking stock."
General Motors,2017-3,"According to a copy of the case obtained by Reuters, ""Recognizing that the interests of ... shareholders may not always coincide, GM created a board committee called the Capital Stock Committee to determine the terms of any material transaction between GM and Hughes and ensure fairness to all shareholders."""

General Motors,2017-3,"MOSCOW, March 30 (Reuters) - Foreign carmakers in Russia are benefiting from a stronger, more stable rouble, which is reducing their costs and supporting earnings in dollar terms at a time when the once-booming local market is expected to return to growth after four tough years."
General Motors,2017-3,"The companies, including German car group Volkswagen and Japan's Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T>, were some of the hardest hit by Russia's economic downturn, in which annual car sales more than halved from a 2012 peak of almost 3 million vehicles, and a sharp devaluation of the rouble raised prices for imported parts and sapped profits."
General Motors,2017-3,"But Russian car sales are now forecast to grow by 4 percent in 2017, according to the Association of European Businesses lobby group."
General Motors,2017-3,"Five of the world's biggest carmakers operating in Russia, which had a combined market share of around 38 percent last year, told Reuters the stronger rouble had improved their position in the country. This will help them to cope in a challenging and volatile market once seen overtaking Germany as Europe's biggest for automobiles."
General Motors,2017-3,"""The rouble fluctuation is of course difficult in all directions. When it was shooting up or weakening like hell over the last few years we had difficulties ... we lost a lot of money there,"" Marcus Osegowitsch, head of Volkswagen's Russian business, said."
General Motors,2017-3,"""Now of course the rouble is stronger again and we are managing. If it stays somewhere between 65 and 67 to the euro, this is fine for us."""
General Motors,2017-3,"The rouble has gained 8 percent against the dollar and 6 percent against the euro so far this year, supported by higher oil prices and Russia's nascent economic recovery. Year on year, the Russian currency is up almost 20 percent against the dollar. [nL5N1FA0YK]"
General Motors,2017-3,"General Motors quit Russia in 2015, partly due to the rouble devaluation, but industry analysts say those foreign players who have stuck out the crisis years could soon see their local operations return to profit."
General Motors,2017-3,"""Foreign producers who suffered losses over the last two years now have the opportunity to return to profit thanks to the stronger rouble,"" VTB analyst Vladimir Bespalov said. ""This could happen by late 2017 or early 2018."""
General Motors,2017-3,"Ford , which is enjoying an unexpected uptick in sales in Russia, has already lowered prices on four models produced by its joint-venture with local partner Sollers due to the rouble strengthening. [nL8N1FY5BD]"
General Motors,2017-3,"Competitors will similarly try to keep prices low, Bespalov said, in an effort to win back cautious buyers."
General Motors,2017-3,"Representatives for Korean carmaker Kia Motors <000270.KS> and France's Renault , which owns a majority stake in Russia's top automaker Avtovaz along with its alliance partner Nissan <7201.T>, said the rouble's improved performance in 2017 was supporting sales and the market recovery."
General Motors,2017-3,"""In the long term, the stronger rouble will positively affect our profitability,"" a Nissan spokesman said."
General Motors,2017-3,"Avtovaz's production costs are less exposed to currency fluctuations than those of foreign carmakers, as the majority of its car components are produced domestically."

General Motors,2017-3,"DETROIT, March 28 (Reuters) - China's Tencent Holdings Ltd <0700.HK> has bought a 5 percent stake in U.S. electric car maker Tesla Inc for $1.78 billion, the latest investment by a Chinese internet company in the potentially lucrative market for self-driving vehicles and related services."
General Motors,2017-3,"Tencent's investment, revealed in a U.S. regulatory filing, provides Tesla with a deep-pocketed ally as it prepares to launch its mass-market Model 3. Tesla's shares rose 2.7 percent to $277.45 on Tuesday, closing in on Ford Motor Co as the second-most-valuable U.S. auto company behind General Motors Co ."
General Motors,2017-3,"Tencent also could help the U.S. company sell - or even build - cars in China, the world's largest auto market, analysts said."
General Motors,2017-3,"""It certainly is a strong chess move for Tesla,"" said Jeff Schuster, senior vice president of forecasting for researcher LMC Automotive, citing the cash infusion and ""help in navigating the Chinese market."""
General Motors,2017-3,"Tesla Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk on Tuesday tweeted: ""Glad to have Tencent as an investor and adviser to Tesla."" Musk did not say what he meant by ""adviser"" but in a separate tweet he noted Tesla had ""very few"" Model 3 orders from China, where the car has not been formally introduced."
General Motors,2017-3,The midsize Model 3 is due to go on sale later this year in the United States.
General Motors,2017-3,"The deal expands Tencent's presence in an emerging investment sector that includes self-driving electric cars, which could enable such new modes of transportation as automated ride-sharing and delivery services, as well as ancillary services ranging from infotainment to e-commerce."
General Motors,2017-3,"Those new technologies, and their potential to create new business models and revenue streams in the global transportation sector, have attracted billions in investment from China's three tech giants - Tencent, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd and Baidu Inc ."
General Motors,2017-3,"In an investor note, Morgan Stanley auto analyst Adam Jonas said on Tuesday that he ""would not be surprised"" to see Tencent and Tesla collaborate in the development and deployment of some of those technologies."
General Motors,2017-3,"The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the Chinese investment in Tesla, but President Donald Trump has been critical of U.S. automakers and of China trade policies."
General Motors,2017-3,"Founded in 1998 by entrepreneur Ma Huateng, Tencent is one of Asia's largest tech companies, best known for its WeChat mobile messaging app. With a market capitalization of about $275 billion, it is roughly six times the size of 14-year-old Tesla, whose $45 billion market cap on Tuesday was only $1 billion shy of 114-year-old Ford."
General Motors,2017-3,"Tencent was an early investor in NextEV, a Shanghai-based electric vehicle startup that since has rebranded itself as Nio, with U.S. headquarters in San Jose, not far from Tesla's Palo Alto base. Tencent also has funded at least two other Chinese EV startups, including Future Mobility in Shenzhen."
General Motors,2017-3,"In addition, Tencent has invested in Didi Chuxing, the world's second-largest ride services company behind Uber, and in Lyft, Uber's chief U.S. rival."
General Motors,2017-3,"Baidu has invested in Nio, as well as in Uber and Velodyne, a California maker of laser-based lidar sensors for self-driving cars. Alibaba's mobility investments include Didi and Lyft."
General Motors,2017-3,"As Tesla is doing, many of the start-up companies backed by Tencent, Baidu and Alibaba are developing self-driving systems that eventually could be introduced in commercial ride-sharing fleets in the United States and China after 2020."
General Motors,2017-3,"Tencent maintains a U.S. office in Palo Alto, in the heart of California's Silicon Valley. Beijing-based Baidu and Hangzhou-based Alibaba also maintain offices in Silicon Valley."
General Motors,2017-3,"To help fund Model 3 production, Tesla raised about $1.2 billion by selling common shares and convertible debt earlier this month. Tencent said its shares were acquired as part of the early March equity sale and on the open market."

General Motors,2017-3,"NEW YORK, March 28 (Reuters Breakingviews) - General Motors looks like it could do with some tinkering. The U.S. automaker has roared back from its 2009 bankruptcy, posting record profit in North America last year. Its shares also have outpaced the S&P 500 over the last year, but trade at just 5.6 times expected 2017 earnings, the lowest valuation in the index. That explains why hedge-fund boss David Einhorn wants to try some financial engineering."
General Motors,2017-3,"His Greenlight Capital claims a proposed stock split would add as much as $38 billion in value at $54 billion GM. Einhorn's plan, which he will push at the annual meeting after months of trying and failing to win over Chief Executive Mary Barra and the board privately, would give investors one share for each they already hold entitling them to the company's annual $1.52 dividend in perpetuity and another that would hand over any additional profit generated from growth."
General Motors,2017-3,"There's also good reason for skepticism, though. The North American recovery is showing some age. Sales of cars and light trucks have been running at a near-record annual rate of around 17.5 million for two years. Outstanding auto loans have increased by 59 percent since the 2010 trough. Once-torrid growth in China has stalled."
General Motors,2017-3,"The technological challenge ahead is at least as daunting as the cyclical one. The market capitalization of Tesla , higher again on the back of an investment from China's Tencent <0700.HK>, already stands at just 85 percent of GM's even though it manufactures fewer than 1 percent as many cars. Elon Musk's electric vehicles and the promise of self-driving ones mean GM will need plenty of capital to keep pace."
General Motors,2017-3,"Greenlight's plan would limit GM's flexibility by forcing it to keep paying dividends even in a downturn, which is what made Moody's skittish. All things considered, shareholders would be wise to steer clear."
General Motors,2017-3,"- Hedge fund Greenlight Capital said on March 28 that it wants General Motors to split its common stock into two classes to boost the automaker's valuation, a proposal the automaker rejected."
General Motors,2017-3,"- The firm run by David Einhorn urged GM to issue new ""dividend shares"" to existing stockholders, who would be entitled to the company's current annual dividend of $1.52 a share. The existing common, which it calls ""capital appreciation shares,"" would be entitled to earnings in excess of the dividend and all of the company's future growth. The fund intends to submit its plan for a vote at the company's annual meeting."
General Motors,2017-3,"- GM's current dividend ""is not respected by the market,"" Greenlight says in its proposal. By creating securities that appeal to income-oriented investors and value- and growth-focused buyers, respectively, the scheme could generate a value of between $43 and $60 for the two shares combined. GM stock was up nearly 3 percent at $35.74 in afternoon trading."
General Motors,2017-3,"- The Detroit-based company said that after considering Einhorn's ideas for some seven months and discussing it with the board, senior executives and credit-rating agencies, it decided that it would create ""unacceptable risks and is not in the best interests of shareholders."" GM has hired Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley to help it fight the proposal."
General Motors,2017-3,"- Moody's said in a statement that the proposal would be ""credit-negative for GM and its subsidiaries"" because it would reduce the company's financial flexibility and increase credit risk."
General Motors,2017-3,- Einhorn also has said he wants to nominate directors to GM's board.

General Motors,2017-3,"Automakers argue the vehicle emissions rules, which would raise the fleet average fuel efficiency to more than 50 miles per gallon (mpg) by 2025 from 27.5 mpg in 2010, will impose significant costs and are out of step with consumer preferences. They argue they need more flexibility to meet the rules amid low gas prices."
General Motors,2017-3,"Environmentalists, who favor the standards, say the rules will reduce fuel costs and greenhouse gases and have vowed to sue if the Trump administration weakens them."
General Motors,2017-3,"Trade groups representing automakers, including General Motors, Volkswagen AG and Toyota, have asked the EPA to withdraw the determination finalizing the rules, which stem from a 2011 deal the industry reached with the U.S. government."
General Motors,2017-3,Changing the 2022-2025 fuel rules will require a lengthy regulatory process and environmentalists and Democratic state attorneys general are likely to sue if the Trump administration significantly weakens the requirements.
General Motors,2017-3,"The Obama administration said in 2011 the changes would boost fuel efficiency to a fleet-wide average of 54.5 mpg, save motorists $1.7 trillion in total fuel costs over the life of the vehicles and cost the auto industry about $200 billion over 13 years. The fuel standards were a central part of Obama's legacy on addressing climate change."

General Motors,2017-3,"WASHINGTON, March 10 (Reuters) - U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions abruptly asked the remaining 46 chief federal prosecutors left over from the Obama administration to resign on Friday, including Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara, who had been asked to stay on in November by then President-elect Donald Trump."
General Motors,2017-3,"Although U.S. attorneys are political appointees, and the request from Trump's Justice Department is part of a routine process, the move came as a surprise to most. Not every new administration replaces all U.S. attorneys at once."
General Motors,2017-3,"A Justice Department spokeswoman confirmed the resignation requests included Bharara, whose office handles some of the most critical business and criminal cases passing through the federal judicial system."
General Motors,2017-3,"Bharara met with Trump in Trump Tower on Nov. 30. After, Bharara told reporters the two had a ""good meeting"" and he had agreed to stay on."
General Motors,2017-3,"On Friday, Bharara was unsure where he stood because he did not know if the person who contacted him about resigning was aware that Trump had asked him to remain in office, according to a source familiar with the matter."
General Motors,2017-3,It was not immediately clear if all resignations would ultimately be accepted.
General Motors,2017-3,"A Justice Department spokesman said on Friday Trump had called Obama-appointee Dana Boente, acting U.S. deputy attorney general, to decline his resignation."
General Motors,2017-3,"Trump also called Maryland U.S. Attorney Rod Rosenstein, his pick to take over as deputy attorney general, to keep him in his post, the spokesman said."
General Motors,2017-3,"Bharara, appointed by Democratic President Barack Obama in 2009, has pursued an aggressive push against corruption in state and city politics and is known for his prosecution of white-collar criminal cases. He also has been overseeing a federal probe into New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio's fundraising."
General Motors,2017-3,"In November, he announced charges against two defendants in connection with what he called a multimillion-dollar fraud and kickback scheme at Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc ."

General Motors,2017-3,"Bharara's priorities have often matched those set by Obama's Justice Department, which potentially puts him at odds with the Trump administration."
General Motors,2017-3,"Amid an increase in civil rights investigations nationally, for example, Bharara's office joined a lawsuit that led to a settlement in 2015 aimed at reducing violence in New York City's Rikers Island jail complex."

General Motors,2017-3,"LONDON, March 10 (Reuters) - Investors hoping for explosive nickel demand growth, in tandem with the electric vehicle revolution, could well be disappointed as any increase is seen as unlikely to change a market dominated by stainless steel producers."
General Motors,2017-3,"Some watching the frenzy of interest in battery materials such as lithium and cobalt say nickel is due its turn in the spotlight given its use in batteries to power EVs, seen as a way of reducing air pollution and meeting emissions targets."
General Motors,2017-3,"However, the amounts used in these batteries at between 7 and 18 kgs are small; by 2025 nickel usage in these batteries is likely to amount to less than 100,000 tonnes, a fraction of global demand."
General Motors,2017-3,"Notably, Glencore Chief Executive Ivan Glasenberg said in December demand for nickel could reach 400,000 tonnes should electric vehicles reach 10 percent of the global fleet, enough to cause a supply deficit."
General Motors,2017-3,"However, out of 89 million cars sold last year roughly one percent or only about 1.1 million were electric or plug-in hybrid vehicles. Consultants expect EV and PHEV sales to rise to more than six million units by 2025, which would amount to around six percent of global car sales."
General Motors,2017-3,"Translated into nickel demand that could amount to an extra 97,000 tonnes, according to Cairn Energy Research Advisors."
General Motors,2017-3,"That number chimes with an estimate from consultants Roskill, which sees nickel demand growth from battery producers for EVs to rise between 12.6 and 19.5 percent a year to between 51,000 and 93,000 tonnes by 2025."
General Motors,2017-3,"""EVs/batteries will become more important for nickel in future, but will not become nickel's dominant use (unlike cobalt or lithium),"" said Robert Baylis, managing director of consultancy Roskill."
General Motors,2017-3,"Roughly two-thirds of global nickel demand, estimated at around two million tonnes this year, is accounted for by stainless steel mills."

General Motors,2017-3,* VW says it has other problems to worry about than M&A
General Motors,2017-3,"* GM says ""even less interested"" in FCA tie-up than before"
General Motors,2017-3,"GENEVA, March 8 (Reuters) - Fiat Chrysler boss Sergio Marchionne's attempts to find a partner were frustrated for a second time in as many days on Wednesday, as Volkswagen (VW) joined General Motors (GM) in dismissing any interest in talks with their smaller rival."
General Motors,2017-3,"Marchionne said on Tuesday that European market leader VW would be hardest hit by PSA Group's purchase of Opel, which will create a stronger European No. 2, and the pressure could prompt VW to sit down with FCA."
General Motors,2017-3,"But VW chief Matthias Mueller was quick to rebuff the overtures, saying his company had enough on its plate already as it battles to recover from a diesel emissions scandal."
General Motors,2017-3,"""We are not ready for talks about anything ... we have other problems,"" he told Reuters on the fringes of the Geneva auto show on Wednesday. ""I haven't seen Marchionne for months."""
General Motors,2017-3,Marchionne has long advocated car industry mergers to share the costs of making cleaner and more technologically advanced vehicles and on Tuesday stressed deals were as vital as ever.
General Motors,2017-3,"""You need to achieve scale or we will end up delivering an incredibly poor return and margins on this business. We need to fix this,"" he said, referring to the wider auto industry."
General Motors,2017-3,"The PSA-Opel deal leaves FCA in an increasingly difficult position in Europe. The indebted group has a European market share of only about 7 percent, its operating margin of 2.5 percent lags most rivals, as does its spending on cleaner and more autonomous cars."
General Motors,2017-3,"Mueller's rejection follows a similar snub from GM , after Marchionne said the U.S. company remained his favourite merger candidate despite its decision to exit Europe by selling Opel and having rebuffed FCA's approaches several times already."
General Motors,2017-3,"""We weren't interested before and we're even less interested now,"" GM President Dan Ammann told reporters in Geneva."
General Motors,2017-3,"A combination of VW and FCA could in theory create a European market leader with a share of around 30 percent, give VW a strong foothold in North America through FCA's Chrysler operations and fix FCA's lack of scale in Asia. But the combination could also mean thousands of job losses that unions and politicians from Italy to Germany would strongly oppose."
General Motors,2017-3,"""In my opinion, size does not matter,"" he said. ""I have always said volume is not our sole goal. We want to be a successful manufacturer in every way."""
General Motors,2017-3,The German company is at the start of a multi-billion-euro transformation to embrace electric cars and automated driving as it struggles to overcome its emissions scandal.
General Motors,2017-3,"While grappling with billions of costs for fines, buy-backs and other charges in the United States, VW is also facing a mounting challenges from consumer groups seeking compensation."
General Motors,2017-3,The group is battling with its powerful labour unions too about cost cuts to fund its new strategy.
General Motors,2017-3,"Since being rejected by GM, Marchionne has focused on eliminating debt and shifting production towards higher-margin vehicles, including SUVs, to become a more attractive merger partner in future. But his options appear to be dwindling."
General Motors,2017-3,"""In western countries we believe that Volkswagen remains the main candidate for M&A, but after dieselgate, which likely stopped everything for a while, the top candidates for an FCA deal moved to the East (Koreans or Chinese), with all the risks on timing and political consequences that they would bring,"" said Angelo Meda, head of equities at Banor SIM."
General Motors,2017-3,"Some analysts also question why anyone would buy FCA now when the price could be set to fall, given the North American market - where it makes most of its profits - may be peaking."

General Motors,2017-3,"WASHINGTON, March 7 (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and 11 other Democrats said on Tuesday it was ""critical"" that the Trump administration leave in place new vehicle fuel efficiency rules, saying the higher standards were achievable."
General Motors,2017-3,"Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, is expected to announce as early as this week the reopening of a review of the rules that were set by the Obama administration for the 2022-2025 period."
General Motors,2017-3,"Automakers say the changes, which would raise the fleet average fuel efficiency to more than 50 miles per gallon by 2025 from 27.5 mpg in 2010, will impose significant costs and are out of step with consumer preferences. They argue they need more flexibility to meet the rules amid low gas prices."
General Motors,2017-3,"Environmentalists, who favor the new standards, say they would reduce fuel costs and greenhouse gases and have vowed to sue if the Trump administration weakens them."
General Motors,2017-3,"""These automobile emissions standards are economically feasible and technologically achievable for the auto industry,"" the Democratic senators, including Edward Markey of Massachusetts and former presidential candidate Bernard Sanders of Vermont, wrote in a letter to Pruitt. ""It is critical that they remain in place."""
General Motors,2017-3,"EPA spokeswoman Cathy Milbourn declined to comment on the letter ""since the agency has not announced how it will proceed on the vehicle emission standards."" The White House also declined to comment."
General Motors,2017-3,"Trade groups representing automakers, including General Motors Co , Ford Motor Co and Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T>, have asked the EPA to withdraw the rules, which stem from a 2011 deal the industry reached with the U.S. government."

General Motors,2017-3,The Obama administration in 2011 said the changes would save motorists $1.7 trillion in fuel costs over the life of the vehicles and cost the auto industry about $200 billion over 13 years.
General Motors,2017-3,"In July, the EPA estimated the fleet would average 50.8-52.6 mpg in 2025 because Americans were buying more SUVs and trucks. It had until April 2018 to decide whether the standards were feasible under a ""midterm review,"" but moved up its decision to a week before President Barack Obama left office."
General Motors,2017-3,"The EPA is also considering taking steps to reverse California's waiver under the Clean Air Act that allows it to set its own vehicle greenhouse gas emissions standards.

General Motors,2017-3,"Industry sources said, however, that GM had no interest in FCA, not least because any merger between the two big U.S. carmakers would lead to major job losses and stiff union opposition."
General Motors,2017-3,"GM and its board have consistently rebuffed Marchionne's overtures, and the company's president did so again on Tuesday."

General Motors,2017-3,"SAO PAULO, March 7 (Reuters) - Automakers in Brazil ramped up production in February, spurred by strong exports and expectations of recovering sales after a brutal four-year downturn in what had been the world's fourth-biggest car market."
General Motors,2017-3,"Automobile production rose 14.7 percent in February from January and surged 39 percent from a year earlier, national automakers' association Anfavea said on Tuesday. Sales slipped 7.8 percent from January and fell 7.6 percent from February 2016."
General Motors,2017-3,"Exports in the first two months of the year rose 73 percent from a year earlier to about 104,000 vehicles, the best start to a year on record. Brazil's auto exports have traditionally been concentrated on neighboring Argentina, but carmakers are pushing to improve access to markets such as Peru and Colombia."
General Motors,2017-3,"Anfavea President Antonio Megale said exports increased across Latin America in January and February, but it was too early to tell if the pace would be sustained for the full year, which would bring Brazilian car exports to a seven-year high."
General Motors,2017-3,"Employment in the auto industry also edged up in the month for the first time in three years, adding a few hundred jobs after shedding some 35,000 since the start of 2014. Auto factories in Brazil are still using less than half of installed capacity, as high unemployment and tight credit pinches demand."
General Motors,2017-3,"Brazil's auto market, which has shrunk to the world's seventh largest according to Anfavea, remains a major base of operations for Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV , Volkswagen AG and General Motors Co ."
General Motors,2017-3,"According to Anfavea data, FCA was Brazil's top seller of new cars and light trucks in February, taking the title back from GM with around 24,700 sales, ahead of its U.S. rival's roughly 23,200 new registrations. VW sold about 17,200 vehicles."

General Motors,2017-3,* Ford says tariff-free Brexit deal key for UK workforce
General Motors,2017-3,"GENEVA, March 7 (Reuters) - The auto industry is facing seismic changes with the rise of electric vehicles, automated driving and car sharing set to eclipse even big mergers such as PSA's purchase of Opel, executives at the Geneva auto show said."
General Motors,2017-3,"Peugeot maker PSA Group said on Monday it had agreed to buy loss-making Opel from General Motors , creating Europe's second-biggest carmaker behind Volkswagen and sparking speculation of more consolidation."
General Motors,2017-3,"However, some auto executives gathering in Geneva said the deal was unlikely to alter the landscape on its own, with changing consumer habits and new rivals in Silicon Valley and China all likely to have a much bigger impact on carmakers."
General Motors,2017-3,"""My feeling is that the industry as a whole and brand positioning will change in the next 10 or 15 years, and that comes in addition to traditional consolidation,"" said Herbert Diess, head of Volkswagen's (VW) passenger car division."
General Motors,2017-3,"""We are really in a transitionary phase for the industry. There are new competitors on the horizon like Tesla or Chinese ventures,"" Diess told reporters, adding that he did not expect a wave of Opel-style mergers."
General Motors,2017-3,"Volkswagen (VW) is investing billions of euros in electric vehicles, automated driving and new mobility services, in part as it tries to recover from a costly emissions test cheating scandal that has hit demand for diesel vehicles."
General Motors,2017-3,"The company, which is also cutting costs, is unveiling a fully self-driving concept car at the Geneva show. [nL5N1GJ4DE]"
General Motors,2017-3,"Karl Schlicht, head of European sales at Japan's Toyota <7203.T>, also played down the impact of the PSA-Opel deal, which brings together carmakers with a heavy focus on diesel and low-margin fleet vehicles."
General Motors,2017-3,"""We ran a counter strategy in Europe which may not look as successful for some past years because our volumes were a bit lower, but in terms of where we want to end up, it's turning out to be a good strategy,"" he said, referring to Toyota's investment in hybrid vehicles."
General Motors,2017-3,Toyota forecasts its European sales will rise 5 percent this year while the market is expected to grow just 1 percent amid uncertainty over German and French elections and Britain's departure from the European Union. [nL5N1GJ44H] [nL5N1FT580]
General Motors,2017-3,"BMW boss Harald Krueger, however, said the cost of investments in new technologies could spur deals among smaller carmakers. [nL5N1GK362]"
General Motors,2017-3,Some industry analysts also say an enlarged PSA could actually ease the pressure on rivals if CEO Carlos Tavares uses similar methods to turn a profit at Opel that worked at PSA.
General Motors,2017-3,"In the three years since Tavares took the helm at PSA, its existing brands - Peugeot, Citroen and DS - have significantly increased pricing relative to benchmarked rivals, sometimes at the expense of sales."
General Motors,2017-3,"A similar approach at Opel, which has been among the region's most aggressive discounters, could give the entire European mass-market car industry some breathing space."
General Motors,2017-3,"""The deal could then ease price pressures, lead to a stabilisation, or even a recovery,"" said Michele Pedroni, fund manager at SYZ Asset Management in Geneva."
General Motors,2017-3,"GM and PSA have shared production of commercial vans and developed common vehicle platforms for years, and the Opel Crossland X and the Citroen C-Aircross concept SUV on show in Geneva are a sign of the new projects and synergies they hope to achieve as one company."
General Motors,2017-3,Stefan Bratzel of the Center of Automotive Management in Germany said the potential improvement in profitability at PSA-Opel posed a bigger challenge to rivals than its sheer size.
General Motors,2017-3,"""There is no survival of the fattest,"" he said. ""Just because you're big, you do not win the game."""
General Motors,2017-3,"Some analysts say Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) , which has less than 7 percent of the European market compared with PSA-Opel's more than 16 percent, could be among the most pressured, with its high debts and costly plants in Italy."
General Motors,2017-3,"""Being a mid-sized player in Europe and not particularly profitable in the region leaves them quite vulnerable,"" said Felipe Munoz, an automotive analyst at JATO. ""They are too expensive to be bought by one of the big guys, and they are not in a position to grow unless they find a partner."""
General Motors,2017-3,"FCA boss Sergio Marchionne has long advocated mergers to share the cost of cleaner and more technologically advanced cars, but his attempt to woo GM was rebuffed and with the U.S. firm now leaving Europe that option seems even less likely."
General Motors,2017-3,"Marchionne said on Tuesday that FCA did not need a merger, but he wouldn't rule one out and said he could approach GM again if it was the right thing to do."
General Motors,2017-3,"He also said the PSA-Opel deal might over time encourage VW to consider a tie-up with his own company, although one industry investment banker told Reuters that was unlikely as VW focuses on its transformation following the dieselgate scandal."
General Motors,2017-3,"Ford , another mid-sized player in Europe, highlighted the importance of keeping costs down."
General Motors,2017-3,"European boss Jim Farley told Reuters it was ""really, really important"" for the future of its more than 14,000 workers in Britain that the country strikes a tariff-free trade deal when it leaves the European Union. [nL5N1GJ5KS]"

General Motors,2017-3,"LONDON, March 6 (Reuters Breakingviews) - The owners of British carmaker Vauxhall will soon speak with a French rather than an American accent. As such, the sale of GM's European operations to Gallic carmaker PSA Group , announced on Monday, has caused fresh concern over its plants in the United Kingdom. Yet this will have little if any impact on job security for the bulk of the company's 4,500 employees in Britain."
General Motors,2017-3,"Tavares' successful restructuring at Peugeot, where he tripled the operating margin since 2014 without closing factories, makes such targets credible. Overcapacities were bigger at Peugeot when Tavares started than they are now at General Motors' ailing European operations. A stronger Peugeot may even have more patience with Vauxhall than GM, which has been loss-making for 16 years in a row despite GM's ongoing attempts to turn things around."
General Motors,2017-3,"The sale does not alter the key risk for automotive jobs in Britain: Brexit. If Britain crashes out of Europe's single market without Prime Minister Theresa May securing a favourable trade deal, exporting British-made vehicles to customers in other European countries may become economically unviable."

General Motors,2017-3,"Tavares has since cut about 3,000 French assembly line jobs each year through voluntary departures to trim the wage bill to 11 percent of revenue from the 15 percent he inherited and which is roughly where Opel's labour costs stand today."

General Motors,2017-3,"LONDON, March 6 (Reuters Breakingviews) - PSA Group's 1.8 billion euro acquisition of General Motors' European operations sets both companies on a path to swift value creation. The French carmaker is paying a price so low it can soon expect a decent return. GM has taken out a sort of insurance against appearing to have sold out cheaply."
General Motors,2017-3,"Opel and Vauxhall, the brands that PSA will now pick up, have been loss-making for 16 years in a row. There was a fairly straightforward reason: with market share of less than 7 percent, GM Europe was too small to be run efficiently. The American parent blocked Opel from selling outside of Europe, fearing competition for its other brands."
General Motors,2017-3,"As a member of PSA Group, Opel will become part of Europe's second-largest carmaker with a market share of around 17 percent. PSA is free to sell future Opel models everywhere in the world. As a larger company, Peugeot will be able to negotiate better deals with suppliers and spread research and development costs over a larger number of vehicles. Peugeot boss Carlos Tavares expects to lift Opel's operating margin from less than zero to 2 percent by 2020."
General Motors,2017-3,"GM boss Mary Barra, meanwhile, has made sure she can't be accused of handing the keys over too easily. More than a third of Peugeot's layout - 650 million euros - will be paid in warrants equivalent to 4.2 percent of the French carmaker's share capital. That also gives Tavares some leeway in case Opel proves less roadworthy than he hopes."
General Motors,2017-3,"- PSA Group will buy General Motors' European brands Opel and Vauxhall for 1.3 billion euros. The French maker of Peugeot and Citroen cars will also pay 460 million euros for a 50 percent stake in its U.S. rival's European financial services activities, with French lender BNP Paribas acquiring the other half of that business."
General Motors,2017-3,"- PSA Chief Executive Carlos Tavares wants to lift Opel and Vauxhall's operating profit margin to 2 percent by 2020 and to 6 percent by 2026. After the integration of the two brands into PSA, which is expected to take almost a decade, Tavares is forecasting annual cost synergies of 1.7 billion euros, he said on March 6."
General Motors,2017-3,- GM will receive a mixture of cash and warrants convertible into a 4.2 percent stake in PSA that can be exercised after five years.
General Motors,2017-3,"- The pension obligations of GM's German operations will be transferred to PSA, along with a 3 billion euro payment to cover their full settlement. GM's remaining unfunded pension obligations of $6.5 billion will remain with the U.S. company."
General Motors,2017-3,- Shares in Peugeot were up 2.4 percent to 19.5 euros by 1000 GMT on March 6.

General Motors,2017-3,"Last week, trade groups representing General Motors Co , Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T>, Volkswagen AG , Ford Motor Co , Honda Motor Co <7267.T> and others formally asked new EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt to withdraw an Obama administration decision to lock in vehicle emission rules through 2025."

General Motors,2017-3,"In 2011, Obama announced an agreement with automakers to raise fuel efficiency standards to a fleet average of 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025.

General Motors,2017-3,"MEXICO CITY, March 2 (Reuters) - Mexico's economy minister will travel to Detroit on Friday to meet with executives from automakers Ford Motor Co and General Motors Co , keeping a frenetic pace of meetings to deter President Donald Trump from punishing Mexican exports."
General Motors,2017-3,"Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo will also meet with auto parts makers that have operations in Detroit and Mexico, the ministry said. He will discuss the state of U.S.-Mexico trade and the future of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)."
General Motors,2017-3,"Trump has vowed to exit NAFTA, the 1994 trade accord that also includes Canada, if he cannot get better terms for the United States. He has also drawn up plans to build a wall on the U.S. southern border and tax Mexican-made goods heading north to pay for it."
General Motors,2017-3,"Wary of Trump's unpredictability, Mexico is not counting on talks with the White House to save it from a possible trade war. Instead, it hopes to build support among companies and U.S. states that most rely on business south of the border to pressure the president not to resort to drastic measures."
General Motors,2017-3,"On Tuesday, Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray said Mexico would only stay in NAFTA if it suited the nation and he rejected the imposition of any tariffs or quotas. The countries have yet to start formal negotiations. [nL2N1GD1WQ]"
General Motors,2017-3,"""Thanks to NAFTA, Mexico and Michigan have built a dynamic trade relationship,"" the ministry said, noting that Mexico was Michigan's second biggest trade partner with more than $12 billion in exports to Mexico last year."
General Motors,2017-3,"The United States sent its top diplomat Rex Tillerson and Department of Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly to Mexico City last week to tend to ties badly bruised by Trump's threats about NAFTA, the border wall and Mexican immigrants."
General Motors,2017-3,"Their efforts were set back when Trump described deportations as ""a military operation,"" forcing Kelly to make a public clarification."
General Motors,2017-3,"One person familiar with the events said news of Trump's comments came just as Kelly and Tillerson were meeting with their counterparts, underscoring what Mexican officials see as the dangers of negotiating with the U.S. administration."

General Motors,2017-3,"Talks are progressing well ahead of a PSA board meeting to be held before the tie-up can be unveiled, people close to the discussions said, adding the deal could be announced as soon as Monday, the eve of the Geneva car show."
General Motors,2017-3,"The talks are not concluded, the people cautioned, and there is still no guarantee a definitive deal can be reached, or that the PSA board will approve it."
General Motors,2017-3,"""Things are advancing as they should,"" said one source close to PSA. ""There's a sense of confidence now."""
General Motors,2017-3,"The two carmakers, which already share some technology and production in an existing European alliance, confirmed last month they were negotiating an outright acquisition of Opel and its British Vauxhall brand by Paris-based PSA, sparking widespread concern over possible job cuts. [nL8N1G0330]"
General Motors,2017-3,"The first models jointly developed under their five year-old partnership will be on display at the Geneva show, which opens to the press on Tuesday."
General Motors,2017-3,"PSA Chief Executive Carlos Tavares said last week a full acquisition of Opel offered an ""opportunity to create a European car champion"" and quickly exceed 5 million annual vehicle sales. The French carmaker also expects savings of up to 2 billion euros ($2.1 billion) from the tie-up, sources have said. [nL8N1G76TV]"
General Motors,2017-3,"Difficulties soon emerged, however, over the future of a near-$10 billion Opel pensions deficit and demands by GM that the brand be barred from competing overseas under PSA ownership against its own Chevrolet lineup."
General Motors,2017-3,"Analysts including Alexis Albert at Barclays put GM's European pensions deficit between $8 billion and $10 billion, with Opel's German operations accounting for the lion's share and the British Vauxhall unit for $1.1 billion."
General Motors,2017-3,"The talks appeared to reach an impasse this week as GM demanded restrictions on Opel sales in China in return for covering part of the pensions hole, people with knowledge of the matter said. GM had also sought to limit its pensions contribution to $1-2 billion, one said."
General Motors,2017-3,"PSA signalled to GM that it could not do a deal in which it shouldered the bulk of the pensions deficit, several sources said. GM boss Mary Barra publicly sounded a circumspect note when asked about an Opel sale on Tuesday."
General Motors,2017-3,"""We've done a lot to improve the business but we're exploring opportunities to see if we can accelerate that even more because scale does matter in this business,"" Barra told reporters. [nL2N1GD1A4]"
General Motors,2017-3,"The carmakers have since narrowed the gap on pensions and the so-called ""non-compete"" agreements sought by GM, the people said, although it remains unclear how or whether they have been resolved. ""We are making progress every day,"" said another Paris-based source."
General Motors,2017-3,"In his public comments on Feb. 23, CEO Tavares said he saw export potential for the Opel brand under PSA ownership. However, much of the existing Opel lineup would remain dependent for years on technology and parts shared with other GM brands."
General Motors,2017-3,"Detroit-based GM has been pressing for a deal barring those legacy Opel models from markets including China, Russia and Latin America, sources have said."

General Motors,2017-3,"TORONTO, March 1 (Reuters) - Automakers broadly notched decent growth in Canadian sales in February, data released by the companies and collated by an industry group showed on Wednesday, as growth in truck sales offset a slowdown in passenger car purchases."
General Motors,2017-3,"The industry sold 123,032 new light vehicles in the month, a 3.2 percent gain from a year ago and a record for overall February sales, according to DesRosiers Automotive Consultants."

General Motors,2017-3,"Truck sales were a particular source of strength for Ford Motor Co , while fleet sales boosted overall numbers for Fiat Chrysler Automobiles , the automakers said in separate statements."
General Motors,2017-3,"General Motors Co said it delivered 16,528 vehicles across its Chevrolet, Buick, GMC and Cadillac brands in the month, a 5 percent increase from a year earlier."
General Motors,2017-3,"Ford said it sold 18,985 vehicles in Canada in the month, its best February performance since 2000 and a 3.2 percent increase from the 18,403 it sold in the same month a year ago."
General Motors,2017-3,"That included 16,800 truck sales, with its popular F-Series notching its best-ever February sales, the company said in a statement."
General Motors,2017-3,"Chrysler said it sold 19,115 vehicles in the month, a 2 percent increase from a year ago, with higher fleet sales helping offset a slip in retail activity."

General Motors,2017-3,"""With the industry at 10 percent you are in a push market,"" said Mark Wakefield, head of the North American automotive practice for consultancy AlixPartners. ""This is top cycle stuff."" In a push market, manufacturers try to unload vehicles, rather than respond to the pull of consumer demand."
General Motors,2017-3,"The challenge now for automakers is to avoid over-producing vehicles or launching a price war that could undermine profits, especially as rising interest rates make it more expensive to subsidize loans and leases, Wakefield said."
General Motors,2017-3,"""It's that fine balance,"" he said. ""How much can I push the boundary without prompting a reaction that pulls all of us down?"""
General Motors,2017-3,The tension surfaced in another round of sniping on Wednesday between GM and Ford over which one was more dependent on discounts to prop up pickup truck sales.
General Motors,2017-3,"On the plus side for automakers, U.S. consumers continued buying more SUVs and pickups, which generate higher profits."
General Motors,2017-3,"Light trucks accounted for 62 percent of light vehicle sales in February. In 2016, that split was 59.5 percent in favor of trucks and SUVs, according to Autodata Corp. Over a full year, that shift would mean roughly two assembly plants' worth of cars had been replaced by SUVs or trucks."
General Motors,2017-3,February sales were mixed for the major automakers. GM beat most analysts' expectations with a 4.2 percent gain in new vehicle sales.
General Motors,2017-3,"Ford sales declined by 4 percent, with its F-Series pickup trucks up 9 percent, SUVs rising 6 percent but cars sliding 24 percent from a year ago, the automaker said."

General Motors,2017-3,GM's Chevrolet brand moved up to 17th from 20th and its Cadillac brand moved up to 18th from 24th.
General Motors,2017-3,"Toyota Motor Corp's <7203.T> flagship brand fell from eighth to 11th place, falling out of the top 10 for the first time in recent years, after the magazine said its Tacoma pickup had reliability issues. Toyota's luxury Lexus unit fell from third to fourth."
General Motors,2017-3,"Fuji Heavy Industries' <7270.T> Subaru unit fell from second to fifth, while Korean auto brand Kia jumped to sixth, up five spots, followed by Mazda Motor Corp <7261.T> in seventh."

General Motors,2017-3,"Nissan Motor Co's <7201.T> luxury Infiniti brand moved up six spots to 16, while its Nissan brand fell one spot to 22."
General Motors,2017-3,Some German automakers struggled. The Volkswagen brand fell eight spots to 23rd and Daimler's Mercedes-Benz fell six spots to 20th.
General Motors,2017-3,"The Fiat brand remained last again among all brands rated, and FCA's Jeep brand remained second-lowest overall. Consumer Reports does not recommend any Fiat Chrysler vehicles, while it recommends all Porsche, Mazda and BMW vehicles."
General Motors,2017-3,"Fisher said Fiat Chrysler models suffered from serious reliability problems and are ""not competitive"" in most segments. The non-profit magazine has more than 8 million subscribers and surveys hundreds of thousands of car owners. Many shoppers consult the ratings, and automakers routinely tout favorable ratings in advertising."
