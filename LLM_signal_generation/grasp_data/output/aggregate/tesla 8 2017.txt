tesla,2017-8,"DETROIT, Aug 30 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co is considering deploying self-driving vehicle technology in larger commercial vehicles and is working with multiple partners to put its autonomous vehicles on the road, a senior Ford executive told Reuters on Tuesday."
tesla,2017-8,"""We've been talking with different partners in different industries"" about potential applications for Ford's first self-driving vehicle in 2021, including ride-sharing and delivery services,"" Sherif Marakby, vice president of autonomous vehicles and electrification at Ford, said in an interview."
tesla,2017-8,"Marakby recently rejoined Ford from ride-services company Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL], where he oversaw development of self-driving vehicles. [nL4N1IR42T]"
tesla,2017-8,"Ford Chief Executive Jim Hackett, who took over in May, is leading a review of the automaker's strategy, including its investments in electric and self-driving vehicles."
tesla,2017-8,"The company is already operating Transit vans in an ""on-demand"" shuttle service called Chariot, which is similar to Uber Technologies Inc's [UBER.UL] ride-hailing service, and eventually could outfit those vehicles with self-driving systems."
tesla,2017-8,"Tesla Inc and some commercial truck makers are trying to develop self-driving trucks. Ford does not make Class 8, long-haul semi trucks, but the company does build light- and medium-duty F-series trucks and Transit vans that commercial customers use to deliver goods. [nL2N1LA0XJ]"
tesla,2017-8,Ford on Tuesday said it is teaming with Domino's Pizza to test Michigan consumers' reactions to having their meals delivered by self-driving vehicles. [nL2N1LE1GS]
tesla,2017-8,"It is working with ""many other companies"" to develop self-driving hardware, while its Pittsburgh-based Argo AI affiliate builds the ""virtual driver"" software, Marakby said."
tesla,2017-8,"Ford still plans to do much of its own systems integration work, he added. Some rival automakers have announced plans to share much of the engineering work and cost. Germany's BMW , for example, has partnered with Intel Corp , Delphi Automotive and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles ."
tesla,2017-8,"""We're developing the technology and the (customer) interfaces to go to market directly with our partners,"" Marakby said. ""We're open to other arrangements in the future."""

tesla,2017-8,"FRANKFURT, Aug 28 (Reuters) - ChargePoint, operator of one of the world's largest charging station networks for electric cars, targets an initial public offering within the next five years, as it expands further into Europe, its chief executive told Reuters."
tesla,2017-8,"Demand for electric cars depends on a network of charging points, which utilities, engineering groups, automakers and start-ups are vying to provide and control before the sector takes off."
tesla,2017-8,"French utility Engie has bought Dutch firm EV-Box, Germany's Innogy is moving into the United States, and ChargePoint, with BMW , Daimler and Siemens among its owners, has entered Europe. [nNDL4CtpKb] [nL8N1JX4B5] [nL8N1IJ5J5]"
tesla,2017-8,"Founded in 2007, Silicon Valley-based ChargePoint operates about 40,000 charging spots in the United States and Mexico. It sells the stations to service providers and hooks them up to its network that can be accessed via a smartphone app."
tesla,2017-8,"It has so far raised nearly $300 million in funds, with Daimler and Siemens becoming investors this year. BMW first supplied funds in 2012, according to Crunchbase data."
tesla,2017-8,"""We will probably look to be public within the next five years,"" Pasquale Romano said in an interview, adding the group was preparing to implement a reporting structure to comply with stock market requirements."
tesla,2017-8,"""We'll be ready. But the conditions have to be right."""
tesla,2017-8,"ChargePoint does not disclose its ownership structure, but Romano said that Daimler, BMW and Siemens together hold a significant stake. Its owners also include venture capital firms Linse Capital, Rho Capital Partners and Braemar Energy Ventures."
tesla,2017-8,"Much of ChargePoint's hopes rest on its expansion in Europe, where the Volkswagen diesel scandal has raised awareness for the need to switch to electric vehicles."
tesla,2017-8,"""Europe is starting with a stronger political mandate,"" Romano said, adding ChargePoint was hiring ""furiously"" in Germany, France, the Netherlands and Britain, where it struck a deal to sell fast chargers in May, its first in Europe."
tesla,2017-8,"ChargePoint, whose board of directors include former General Motors Chief Executive Rick Wagoner, is aiming to spend the $125 million it raised in a recent funding round to expand on the continent."
tesla,2017-8,"Europe, however, is also a highly fragmented market, with differing e-mobility legislation and support schemes across various countries, requiring a specific strategy and business model for almost every market."
tesla,2017-8,"In addition, ChargePoint will face stiff competition on the continent, most notably from Engie's EV-Box, itself boasting more than 48,000 in installed charging points, as well as RWE's Innogy, with 5,800 charging points."
tesla,2017-8,"According to its website, Tesla has 6,372 superchargers worldwide, which are slower than ChargePoint's most modern chargers."
tesla,2017-8,"""The market will consolidate around three to four players and we hope to be one of them. That's how we look at it,"" Romano said, adding it was important to expand aggressively, possibly at the expense of immediate profitability."
tesla,2017-8,One potential business target could be a car consortium - which includes Daimler and BMW - aiming to install 400 super-fast charging stations across Europe. [nL1N1DU18Q]

tesla,2017-8,"{{20170828T111053.949+0000}}Australian leader hints at a clean energy target by year's endSYDNEY, Aug 28 (Reuters) - Australia could adopt a clean energy target by the end of the year, heeding the call of national energy providers and scientists as a means to cut carbon emissions and cap soaring power prices."
tesla,2017-8,"Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said the government was ""carefully considering"" the recommendation by the nation's chief scientist Alan Finkel as a way to ensure affordable, reliable and cleaner power."
tesla,2017-8,"""We're certainly aiming to make a decision by the end of the year,"" Turnbull told Australian Broadcasting Corp."
tesla,2017-8,"Finkel in June led a list of recommendations presented to the government aimed at ending a decade of political warfare over climate policy, meaning coal-fired power generation using carbon-capture technology could potentially be used alongside gas and renewable sources such as wind and solar.[nL3N1J62CP]"
tesla,2017-8,Energy companies argue they need long-term policy certainty to invest in new power generation and bring down electricity bills - and the key to unlocking that was to roll out a national clean energy target.
tesla,2017-8,"The government is awaiting a report from the Australian Energy Market Operator, which Turnbull labeled ""a critical thing"" before moving to decide on a target."
tesla,2017-8,"""First, we need to be satisfied as to what the gap in baseload power is going to be over the next five and 10 years,"" he said."
tesla,2017-8,Finkel's report was commissioned last October after tornadoes triggered a state-wide blackout in South Australia that came as a wake-up call to politicians as it left homes in the dark for up to eight hours and crippled industry for nearly two weeks.
tesla,2017-8,The state has since contracted with Tesla Inc to build the world's biggest grid-scale lithium-ion battery and is also installing a new solar thermal plant to replace coal-fired power.[nL4N1L02X5]

tesla,2017-8,{{20170824T194101.350+0000}}REFILE-EXCLUSIVE-Tesla's 'long-haul' electric truck aims for 200 to 300 miles on a charge(Removes alert from text in first paragraph)
tesla,2017-8,"SAN FRANCISCO, Aug 24 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc next month plans to unveil an electric big-rig truck with a working range of 200 to 300 miles, Reuters has learned, a sign that the electric car maker is targeting regional hauling for its entry into the commercial freight market."
tesla,2017-8,"Chief Executive Elon Musk has promised to release a prototype of its Tesla Semi truck next month in a bid to expand the company's market beyond luxury cars. The entrepreneur has tantalized the trucking industry with the prospect of a battery-powered heavy-duty vehicle that can compete with conventional diesels, which can travel up to 1,000 miles on a single tank of fuel."
tesla,2017-8,"""I'm not going to count them out for having a strategy for longer distances or ranges, but right out of the gate I think that's where they'll start,"" said Perry, who is the chief technology officer and chief procurement officer for Ryder."
tesla,2017-8,"Tesla responded to Reuters questions with an email statement saying, ""Tesla's policy is to always decline to comment on speculation, whether true or untrue, as doing so would be silly. Silly!"""
tesla,2017-8,"Tesla's plan, which could change as the truck is developed, is consistent with what battery researchers say is possible with current technology. Tesla has not said publicly how far its electric truck could travel, what it would cost or how much cargo it could carry. But Musk has acknowledged that Tesla has met privately with potential buyers to discuss their needs."
tesla,2017-8,Reuters reported earlier this month that Tesla is developing self-driving capability for the big rig. [nL1N1KV1X5]
tesla,2017-8,"Musk has expressed hopes for large-scale production of the Tesla Semi within a couple of years. That audacious effort could open a potentially lucrative new market for the Palo Alto, California-based automaker."
tesla,2017-8,"Or it could prove an expensive distraction. Musk in July warned that the company is bracing for ""manufacturing hell"" as it accelerates production of its new Model 3 sedan. Tesla aims to produce 5,000 of the cars per week by the end of this year, and 10,000 per week some time next year."
tesla,2017-8,"Tesla shares are up about 65 percent this year. But skeptics abound. Some doubt Musk's ability to take Tesla from a niche producer to a large-scale automaker. About 22 percent of shares available for trade have been sold ""short"" by investors who expect the stock to fall."
tesla,2017-8,"Musk, a quirky billionaire whose transportation ambitions include colonizing the planet Mars, has long delighted in defying conventional wisdom. At Tesla's annual meeting in June, he repeated his promise of a battery-powered long-haul big rig."
tesla,2017-8,"""A lot of people don't think you can do a heavy-duty, long-range truck that's electric, but we are confident that this can be done,"" he said."
tesla,2017-8,"While the prototype described by Ryder's Perry would fall well short of the capabilities of conventional diesels, Musk may well have found a sweet spot if he can deliver. Roughly 30 percent of U.S. trucking jobs are regional trips of 100 to 200 miles, according to Sandeep Kar, chief strategy officer of Toronto-based Fleet Complete, which tracks and analyzes truck movement."
tesla,2017-8,"A truck with that range would be able to move freight regionally, such as from ports to nearby cities or from warehouses to retail establishments."
tesla,2017-8,"""As long as (Musk) can break 200 miles he can claim his truck is 'long haul' and he will be technically right,"" Kar said."
tesla,2017-8,Interest in electric trucks is high among transportation firms looking to reduce their emissions and operating costs. Electric motors require less maintenance than internal combustion engines. Juice from the grid is cheaper than diesel.
tesla,2017-8,But current technology doesn't pencil when it comes to powering U.S. trucks across the country. Experts say the batteries required would be so large and heavy there would be little room for cargo.
tesla,2017-8,"An average diesel cab costs around $120,000. The cost of the battery alone for a big rig capable of going 200 to 400 miles carrying a typical payload could be more than that, according to battery researchers Shashank Sripad and Venkat Viswanathan of Carnegie Mellon University."
tesla,2017-8,"Battery weight and ability would limit a semi to a range of about 300 miles with an average payload, according to a paper recently published by Viswanathan and Sripad. The paper thanked Tesla for ""helpful comments and suggestions."" Tesla did not endorse the work or comment on the conclusions to Reuters."
tesla,2017-8,"A range of 200 to 300 miles would put Tesla at the edge of what the nascent electric truck industry believes is economically feasible, the researchers and industry insiders said."
tesla,2017-8,"Daimler has been joined by a handful of startups such as Chanje, a Los Angeles-based manufacturer that has a partnership with Ryder to build 100-mile-range electric trucks for package delivery."
tesla,2017-8,"Ryder and its customers believe electric trucks could cost more to buy but may be cheaper to maintain and have more predictable fuel costs. As batteries become cheaper and environmental regulation increases, the case for electric trucks could strengthen."
tesla,2017-8,"""This tech is being seen as a major potential differentiator. Everyone wants to understand how real it is,"" said Perry, the chief technology officer."

tesla,2017-8,"VANCOUVER, Aug 24 (Reuters) - Institutional investors hoping to profit from cobalt, this year's high-flying metal, are buying into companies that are smaller than their usual fare to gain exposure to an industry supplying the burgeoning electric car market."
tesla,2017-8,"Prices for cobalt , a key ingredient in lithium-ion batteries for electric vehicles, have spiked 83 percent this year on forecasts that demand will double in the next decade as consumers switch to less-polluting cars."
tesla,2017-8,"Nearly all cobalt, which prolongs battery life, is mined as a by-product of copper and nickel, making it difficult for investors to get direct exposure."
tesla,2017-8,"Much like the recent boom in lithium, another battery ingredient, cobalt's surge has resulted from heady forecasts for ownership of electric vehicles. UBS in May said it expected them to account for 3.1 percent of global car sales in 2021 and 13.7 percent in 2025, up from 1 percent this year."
tesla,2017-8,"In response, small cobalt-focused companies are mushrooming, mostly in Canada, a long-time hub for mining start-ups, but only one, Cobalt 27 Capital Corp , concentrates entirely on the mineral."
tesla,2017-8,"""To gain exposure to the cobalt theme in any pure way, you almost have to go down the market capitalization spectrum,"" said portfolio manager Ben Cleary of Sydney-based Tribeca Investment Partners."
tesla,2017-8,"Institutions are often wary of small-cap stocks, which can be volatile and difficult to sell because of their small number of investors."
tesla,2017-8,"Tribeca, which manages A$2.5 billion ($2 billion), owns shares of Canada's Ecobalt Solutions Inc , which is building a cobalt mine in Idaho. It also has stock in small Australian miner Cobalt One , which is being acquired by Canada's First Cobalt in a three-way tie up to expand its exploration land in the province of Ontario."
tesla,2017-8,"At the end of July, 110 companies mining or exploring for cobalt were on the Toronto Stock Exchange and TSX Venture Exchange, a market for smaller-capitalization stocks, compared with fewer than 30 in 2015, according to SNL Financial."
tesla,2017-8,"Some of the optimism is already built into cobalt stocks. Cobalt One has surged 30 percent this year, First Cobalt has nearly doubled, and Ecobalt has jumped 144 percent."
tesla,2017-8,"Some junior miners point out that their projects are in more politically stable regions than the Democratic Republic of Congo, where more than half the world's cobalt is produced. Last year Amnesty International said some mines there were using child labor."
tesla,2017-8,"""(Tesla Inc Chief Executive Officer) Elon Musk and others are saying: 'Where do I get my cobalt if I don't want to go to the Congo?'"" said First Cobalt CEO Trent Mell."
tesla,2017-8,"Tesla has said it would like to source raw materials for its ""Gigafactory"" battery plant in North America."
tesla,2017-8,"At least two more cobalt explorers with Ontario projects are planning listings on the Toronto Stock Exchange in coming months, an industry source said, requesting anonymity because the information is not public."
tesla,2017-8,"That would follow the June listing of Cobalt 27, which raised C$200 million ($159.21 million) in the market's biggest mining initial public offering since 2012. [nL8N1JK2OU]"
tesla,2017-8,"BlackRock Inc , the world's largest asset manager, bought Cobalt 27 shares, it said in a June 30 securities filing."
tesla,2017-8,"Cobalt 27, which owns about 2,200 tonnes of cobalt and is not a miner or explorer, was created specifically to give institutions direct access to investing in the metal without the exploration and development risks facing miners, said CEO Anthony Milewski."

tesla,2017-8,The fatal incident raised questions about the safety of systems that can perform driving tasks for long stretches with little or no human intervention but which cannot completely replace human drivers.
tesla,2017-8,"In June, the NTSB said the driver, Joshua Brown, kept his hands off the wheel for extended periods of time despite repeated automated warnings not to do so. Brown was killed near Williston, Florida, when his Model S collided with a truck while it was engaged in the ""Autopilot"" mode."
tesla,2017-8,"Tesla Inc did not immediately comment on Monday but said in 2016 that Autopilot ""does not allow the driver to abdicate responsibility."" A lawyer for Brown's family, Jack Landskroner, declined to comment on Monday on the forthcoming hearing."

tesla,2017-8,"BOSTON, Aug 18 (Reuters) - Top Tesla Inc investors Fidelity Investments and T. Rowe Price cut their holdings in the second quarter and indicated they were taking profits from the electric car maker stock, which is up 65 percent this year."
tesla,2017-8,"Sellers included Fidelity funds like Fidelity OTC Portfolio, which sold 1.62 million shares, or 43 percent of its position during the quarter, as well as funds managed by T. Rowe Price Group , including T. Rowe Price Growth Stock Fund , which sold 1.33 million shares during the quarter or 48 percent of its position, recent securities filings show."
tesla,2017-8,"Both funds remain among the ten largest fund investors in Tesla, according to Thomson Reuters data."
tesla,2017-8,Other big sellers of Tesla during the quarter were Morgan Stanley funds including Morgan Stanley Institutional Growth Portfolio .
tesla,2017-8,"In total, institutional investors held 95.2 million shares of Tesla at the end of June, 10.7 million fewer shares than at the end of March, according to an analysis of filings by edgaronline.com."
tesla,2017-8,"On Aug. 3 alone Tesla shares rose more than 6 percent as its quarterly earnings report fueled expectations its new Model 3 sedan would help turn the Palo Alto, California company into a mainstream carmaker. Tesla is now the highest valued U.S. car maker with a market capitalization of some $60 billion."
tesla,2017-8,"It had $3 billion cash on hand at June 30, reassuring investors who had worried after Chief Executive Elon Musk warned it would face six months of ""manufacturing hell"" in ramping up Model 3 production, and raised $1.8 billion in debt last week."
tesla,2017-8,"A quarterly commentary posted on Fidelity's website for OTC Portfolio called Tesla a ""market darling"" that was the top contributor to the fund's returns but noted some concerns."
tesla,2017-8,"Asked about the stock sales, a spokesman for T. Rowe Price said in an e-mailed statement that ""We're not afraid to trim and take profits on appreciated stocks where appropriate.

tesla,2017-8,* Electric version of Kona SUV planned for first half of 2018
tesla,2017-8,"SEOUL, Aug 17 (Reuters) - Hyundai Motor Co <005380.KS> said on Thursday it was placing electric vehicles at the centre of its product strategy - one that includes plans for a premium long-distance electric car as it seeks to catch up to Tesla and other rivals."
tesla,2017-8,"Like Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T>, Hyundai had initially championed fuel cell technology as the future of eco-friendly vehicles but has found itself shifting electric as Tesla shot to prominence and battery-powered cars have gained government backing in China."
tesla,2017-8,"Toyota is now also working on longer distance, fast-charging electric vehicles, local media have reported.[nL3N1KG1AQ]"
tesla,2017-8,The South Korean automaker is planning to launch an electric sedan under its high-end Genesis brand in 2021 with a range of 500 km (310 miles) per charge. It will also introduce an electric version of its Kona small sport utility vehicle (SUV) with a range of 390 km in the first half of next year.
tesla,2017-8,"""We're strengthening our eco-friendly car strategy, centering on electric vehicles,"" Executive Vice President Lee Kwang-guk told a news conference, calling the technology mainstream and realistic."
tesla,2017-8,"The automaker and affiliate Kia Motors Corp <000270.KS>, which together rank fifth in global vehicle sales, also said they were adding three plug-in vehicles to their plans for eco-friendly cars, bringing the total to 31 models by 2020."
tesla,2017-8,"Underscoring Hyundai's electric shift, those plans include eight battery-powered and two fuel-cell vehicles - a contrast to its 2014 announcement for 22 models, of which only two were slated to be battery-powered."
tesla,2017-8,"Hyundai also confirmed a Reuters report that it is developing its first dedicated electric vehicle platform, which will allow the company to produce multiple models with longer driving ranges. [nL3N1H71GT]"
tesla,2017-8,"Last year, it launched its first mass-market pure electric car IONIQ, but the vehicle's per-charge driving range is much shorter than offerings from Tesla and General Motors ."
tesla,2017-8,"Hyundai unveiled a near production version of its new fuel cell SUV with a driving range of more than 580 km per charge, compared with the 415 km for its current Tucson fuel cell SUV."
tesla,2017-8,"The mid-sized SUV will be launched in Korea early next year, followed by U.S. and European markets."
tesla,2017-8,"A fuel cell electric bus is slated to be unveiled late this year, while a sedan-type fuel cell car is also planned. Even so, analysts noted that gaining traction with fuel cells was going to be a long hard slog partly due to a lack of charging infrastructure."
tesla,2017-8,"""Hyundai will achieve economies of scale for fuel cell cars by 2035 at the earliest,"" said Lee Hang-koo, a senior research fellow at Korea Institute for Industrial Economics & Trade."
tesla,2017-8,"""Before that, Hyundai has no choice but to rely on battery cars,"" he said."
tesla,2017-8,"Hyundai launched the world's first mass-produced fuel cell vehicle in 2013, dubbed the Tucson Fuel Cell, but sales trailed Toyota's rival offering, Mirai."
tesla,2017-8,"Hyundai has sold about 862 of Tucson Fuel Cell vehicles since its 2013 launch, while Toyota sold some 3,700 Mirai Fuel Cell vehicles since its 2014 launch."
tesla,2017-8,"In Korea, there are 10 fuel cell charging stations, only one tenth of 100 in Japan, Hyundai said."

tesla,2017-8,"WASHINGTON, Aug 16 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Markets are showing faith in U.S. institutions, not Donald Trump. The president disbanded his advisory councils after a raft of CEOs quit. They are the latest to abandon a leader who has been defied by Congress, the U.S. courts and the military. These bodies will be crucial in ensuring the nation's stability."
tesla,2017-8,"Ever since his election victory, the president has courted America's chief executives and reveled in rubbing shoulders with them. The bosses were eager to support administration proposals on tax reform and deregulation. Most remained steadfast even as White House dysfunction grew and Disney's Bob Iger and Tesla's Elon Musk resigned over climate-change policy."
tesla,2017-8,"The markets, as is their wont of late, took the news in stride. U.S. stocks dipped slightly after the CEO resignations, but the S&P 500 Index was fractionally higher on the day. The dollar rose about half a cent against the euro and U.S. Treasuries firmed."
tesla,2017-8,"Corporate bosses are following other institutions that have defied Trump and worked to calm the storm. After the president warned Pyongyang of ""fire and fury"" last week, General Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the military's priority was to support diplomatic and economic pressure on North Korea. He also said the military would not implement Trump's ban on transgender enlistees until it received instructions."
tesla,2017-8,U.S. courts have repeatedly blocked Trump's travel ban on citizens of certain Muslim-majority countries. And the Republican-led Congress ignored Trump's pressure and voted down an Obamacare repeal bill. GOP leaders have also criticized Trump's Virginia comments and issued strong condemnations of white supremacists.
tesla,2017-8,U.S. institutions will be relied upon even further as the Justice Department and FBI intensify their probe into potential Trump campaign ties to Russian election meddling. Investors so far appear confident they will help the nation ride out the storm.
tesla,2017-8,- U.S. President Donald Trump announced on Aug. 16 that he was disbanding his two business advisory councils after several executives said they were quitting over the administration's response to a white supremacist rally in Virginia.
tesla,2017-8,"- ""Rather than putting pressure on the businesspeople of the Manufacturing Council & Strategy & Policy Forum, I am ending both,"" the president wrote in a tweet. He made the comment after members of the strategy forum, led by Blackstone CEO Steve Schwarzman, said the group was disbanding. That group includes JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi and BlackRock CEO Larry Fink."
tesla,2017-8,"- Earlier on Aug. 16, three more chief executives announced they were resigning from the manufacturing council. They include 3M's Inge Thulin, Campbell Soup's Denise Morrison and United Technologies' Greg Hayes. They were responding to Trump's comments on Aug. 15, when he again blamed both sides for violence at the Virginia rally that led to the death of one woman. Trump said not all of the participants were members of the Ku Klux Klan or neo-Nazis and some of them were ""very fine people."""

tesla,2017-8,"{{20170816T161037.168+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-Like much else, Amazon can sell debt in a flash(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.)"
tesla,2017-8,"NEW YORK, Aug 16 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Amazon's aggressive salesmanship now extends to its own debt. The e-commerce giant's blowout $16 billion bond sale suggests almost unlimited potential for the retailing juggernaut to consider even more shopping. Yet in nearly tripling its financial obligations to buy brick-and-mortar Whole Foods Market , Jeff Bezos' outfit is starting to look more traditional. The risk is that its stock will too."
tesla,2017-8,Bezos built his online empire by investing cash flow back into the business and eschewing such conventional corporate-finance tools as debt and dividends. The result is a $472 billion goliath - the fifth-largest American enterprise by market capitalization - that has store owners and tech companies quaking over its ambitions.
tesla,2017-8,"The deal will nearly triple Amazon's outstanding debt, to a little over $23 billion. That's about a billion less than the consensus estimate for 2018 EBITDA. Given the company's cash pile, net debt will be even lower at under $10 billion. That leaves the under-leveraged Amazon with enough financial firepower to consider acquisitions that would make Whole Foods look like an appetizer."
tesla,2017-8,"Whether that would be good for the company's stock is less clear. Belief in the Bezos vision has pushed Amazon shares up nearly 31 percent so far this year, and they are trading at 120 times 2018 estimated earnings as calculated by Eikon. Wal-Mart Stores , by contrast, fetches 17.6 times earnings. As Amazon begins to more closely resemble peers both in its physical footprint and its balance sheet, that gap will inevitably narrow."
tesla,2017-8,- Amazon on Aug. 15 sold $16 billion of debt to finance its $13.7 billion acquisition of Whole Foods Market and repay $1 billion of debt coming due later this year.
tesla,2017-8,"- The Seattle-based company offered notes and bonds in seven tranches, with maturities ranging from three years to 40 years. Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan were bookrunners on the deal."

tesla,2017-8,"NEW YORK, Aug 14 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Ken Frazier is standing up to Donald Trump. On Monday, the Merck boss quit the White House manufacturing council to protest the president's dismal response to Saturday's white-supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. National duty, ego and fear of a Twitter rebuke may have kept corporate chieftains in their seats, but they have little to show for staying."
tesla,2017-8,"He's not the first to jump. Disney's Bob Iger and Tesla's Elon Musk resigned from the strategic and policy council in June to protest Trump withdrawing the country from the 2015 Paris climate-change accord. Yet most others think it's still worth having a seat at the table to influence policy, some of the firms have told Breakingviews."
tesla,2017-8,"Deregulation aside, though, the Trump administration has made little progress on issues of most concern to Corporate America. The White House and congressional Republicans have yet to agree on even the broad outlines of tax cuts. Debt-ceiling and budget talks may well push the effort into 2018."
tesla,2017-8,"Sometimes silence isn't an option. For Frazier, an African-American man, it was the president's tardy and pathetic reaction to white supremacists marching through a university town carrying swastikas, Confederate flags and KKK signs. Trump would only condemn ""hatred, bigotry and violence, on all sides."" Morally, standing up against U.S. neo-Nazis should be a no-brainer."
tesla,2017-8,"It can also be a smart business move. Companies need to attract the broadest range of talent to compete. Nor can they afford to alienate their customers, especially consumer-facing companies. PepsiCo , whose boss Indra Nooyi sits on the strategic and policy forum headed by Blackstone's Stephen Schwarzman, faced a social-media backlash recently over a TV ad that seemed to make light of the Black Lives Matter protests."
tesla,2017-8,"A Trump Twitter tongue-lashing has little power, now, too. Merck's stock was up around half a percent in mid-morning trading, better than Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson . Perhaps that's what waverers need to see to realize they can afford to take a principled stand against the president."
tesla,2017-8,"- Merck Chief Executive Kenneth Frazier on Aug. 14 announced he was resigning from President Donald Trump's American Manufacturing Council, citing ""a responsibility to take a stand against intolerance and extremism."""
tesla,2017-8,"- The move followed violent clashes at a rally by white supremacists in Charlottesville, Virginia, on Aug. 12 that left one person dead and 19 injured. In a statement after the event, President Trump condemned ""this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence, on many sides."""
tesla,2017-8,"- In explaining his decision to resign, Frazier, an African-American man, said in a statement, ""America's leaders must honor our fundamental values by clearly rejecting expressions of hatred, bigotry and group supremacy."""
tesla,2017-8,"- The president responded on Twitter, writing, ""Now that Ken Frazier of Merck Pharma has resigned from President's Manufacturing Council, he will have more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES!"""

tesla,2017-8,"WASHINGTON, Aug 11 (Reuters Breakingviews) - The Teamsters are throwing a wrench into the self-driving movement's works. The union has convinced U.S. lawmakers to exempt commercial trucks from a bill allowing more autonomous vehicles on the roads. Granted, 3.5 million jobs are at stake. But as Tesla joins Daimler and others in the big-rig tech race, it'd be smarter to prepare haulers for a career shift."
tesla,2017-8,"Congress is due to tackle the first federal legislation on self-driving vehicles in September after it returns from summer recess. The bipartisan plan raises the cap on permitted vehicles that don't have common features such as a steering wheel, or meet certain safety requirements, to 100,000 a year from the current limit of 2,500."
tesla,2017-8,"The union has opposed other policy pushes, such as states wanting to allow companies to use what is known as platooning technology. This would digitally connect a group of trucks so they drive in a gas-saving formation. It's seen as a precursor to autonomous trucks and Arkansas, Tennessee and South Carolina are among the states considering such a move."
tesla,2017-8,"Fast adoption of such technology is in the industry's and economy's interest, too. Commercial trucking plays a key role in the U.S. economy, delivering about 70 percent of goods. The industry generates more than $700 billion a year in revenue. Yet the average age of truckers is 49, causing a worker shortage that is projected to hit 240,000 drivers by 2022, according to the American Trucking Associations."
tesla,2017-8,"Perhaps the Teamsters are trying to ensure these older workers can reach retirement age without any fear of being dumped by the side of the road. But the advent of masses of autonomous vehicles on the roads of any stripe is at least a decade away. Even then, human drivers may still be in demand for short-haul trips. And younger truckers will need retraining before autonomy fully kicks in. Gearing workers up for this inevitability is a better labor strategy than obfuscation."
tesla,2017-8,- The U.S. House of Representatives plans to vote on the first federal legislation on self-driving vehicles when lawmakers return from recess in September.
tesla,2017-8,"- The bipartisan bill would allow manufacturers to eventually put an industry total of 100,000 vehicles a year on the road that don't have traditional auto features, such as a steering wheel and foot pedals, or meet certain safety requirements."
tesla,2017-8,"- Currently, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration grants 2,500 exemptions a year for vehicles that don't have such standard features or safety requirements."
tesla,2017-8,"- The proposal would require carmakers to submit safety-assessment reports to regulators, but does not mandate pre-market approval of new technology. The bill also prohibits states from setting rules on self-driving performance standards."
tesla,2017-8,"- The measures only apply to vehicles weighing less than 10,000 pounds, which excludes large commercial trucks. That carve-out was sought by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, which represents 1.4 million truck drivers, warehouse employees and other workers."

tesla,2017-8,"LONDON, Aug 11 (Reuters) - A small Canadian miner has set out to lead the way into petrolithium production, combining oil for conventional vehicles with lithium for electric vehicles produced from oilfield waste water."
tesla,2017-8,Shares in MGX Minerals have doubled this year as investors seek exposure to the predicted electric vehicle revolution that many of the conventional resource firms do not provide.
tesla,2017-8,It has acquired acreage that establishes it as Canada's biggest holder of lithium brine assets with around 2 million acres' worth in North America.
tesla,2017-8,"Much of it is in the Paradox Basin in Utah, which could position MGX to provide lithium to Tesla's battery factory in neighbouring Nevada. MGX CEO Jared Lazerson said commercial confidentiality rules meant he could not comment on whether any agreements had been signed."
tesla,2017-8,"""I would love MGX to be the company that brought the oil and gas industry into the lithium space and the EV space, to allow the oil and gas industry to support EV and not be so worried or concerned,"" Lazerson told Reuters in a telephone interview."
tesla,2017-8,"Lithium is not rare and some analysts say high prices will prove a bubble as more production comes online. Processing capacity, however, can be an issue and auto makers are locking in contracts with suppliers. [nL5N1KM2WL]"
tesla,2017-8,Lazerson says MGX's advantage as the car industry wakes up to its need for lithium for battery-powered electric vehicles is that it can bring on production quickly and at a relatively low capital cost using brine wastewater in oilfields. Economics are favourable as lithium production effectively boosts the oil price.
tesla,2017-8,"More than half of the Earth's identified sources of lithium are in the ""lithium triangle"" of high-altitude lakes and salt flats that straddles Chile, Argentina and Bolivia."
tesla,2017-8,"The lithium from there is low cost because it relies on a roughly 18-month process of evaporation using the sun for energy, but bringing on new volumes requires advance planning."
tesla,2017-8,"Alternatively, lithium comes from hard rock, for instance in Australia, but that can involve large amounts of waste rock and be energy-intensive."
tesla,2017-8,"Lazerson says pilot projects using oilfield brine have been successful and the aim is to ramp up to processing 1,200 cubic metres of brine per day around the end of the year. So far it has processed up to 20 cubic metres per day."
tesla,2017-8,MGX seeks to keep capital expenditure low and to maximise what Lazerson says is first-mover advantage by using small nanofiltration units that can be moved to wherever the brine is.
tesla,2017-8,"""I'm sure others will come along. We're trying to be the first out of the gate,"" he said."

tesla,2017-8,"SAN FRANCISCO, Aug 9 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc is developing a long-haul, electric semi-truck that can drive itself and move in ""platoons"" that automatically follow a lead vehicle, and is getting closer to testing a prototype, according to an email discussion of potential road tests between the car company and the Nevada Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV), seen by Reuters."
tesla,2017-8,"Meanwhile, California officials are meeting with Tesla on Wednesday ""to talk about Tesla's efforts with autonomous trucks,"" state DMV spokeswoman Jessica Gonzalez told Reuters."
tesla,2017-8,"The correspondence and meeting show that Tesla is putting self-driving technology into the electric truck it has said it plans to unveil in September, and is advancing toward real-life tests, potentially moving it forward in a highly competitive area of commercial transport also being pursued by Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] and Alphabet Inc's Waymo."
tesla,2017-8,"After announcing intentions a year ago to produce a heavy-duty electric truck, Musk tweeted in April that the semi-truck would be revealed in September, and repeated that commitment at the company's annual shareholder meeting in June, but he has never mentioned any autonomous-driving capabilities."
tesla,2017-8,"Tesla has been a leader in developing self-driving technology for its luxury cars, including the lower-priced Model 3, which it is beginning to manufacture."
tesla,2017-8,"Several Silicon Valley companies developing autonomous driving technology are working on long-haul trucks. They see the industry as a prime early market for the technology, citing the relatively consistent speeds and little cross-traffic trucks face on interstate highways and the benefits of allowing drivers to rest while trucks travel."
tesla,2017-8,"Some companies also are working on technology for ""platooning"", a driving formation where trucks follow one another closely. If trucks at the back of the formation were able to automatically follow a lead vehicle, that could cut the need for drivers."
tesla,2017-8,"Silicon Valley startup Peloton Technology, for example, is working with several truck makers including Volvo on its platooning system, which it sees as a precursor to autonomy."
tesla,2017-8,"Tesla's high-flying shares, up almost 70 percent this year, closed down 0.5 percent at $363.53 on Nasdaq, but rose slightly after hours."
tesla,2017-8,"An email exchange in May and June between Tesla and Nevada DMV representatives included an agenda for a June 16 meeting, along with the Nevada Department of Transportation, to discuss testing of two prototype trucks in Nevada, according to the exchange seen by Reuters."
tesla,2017-8,"""To insure we are on the same page, our primary goal is the ability to operate our prototype test trucks in a continuous manner across the state line and within the States of Nevada and California in a platooning and/or Autonomous mode without having a person in the vehicle,"" Tesla regulatory official Nasser Zamani wrote to Nevada DMV official April Sanborn. He made no reference to any dates for potential road tests."
tesla,2017-8,"No companies yet have tested self-driving trucks in Nevada without a person in the cab. On July 10, Zamani inquired further to the Nevada DMV about terms for a testing license, an email seen by Reuters shows."
tesla,2017-8,California DMV spokeswoman Gonzalez said that Tesla had requested a meeting on Wednesday to introduce new staff and talk about Tesla's efforts with autonomous trucks. She said that the DMV was not aware of the level of autonomy in the trucks.
tesla,2017-8,"Tesla declined to comment on the matter, referring Reuters to the previous statements by Musk, who has discussed the truck in tweets and at the annual shareholder meeting."
tesla,2017-8,Nevada officials confirmed the meeting with Tesla had occurred and said that Tesla had not applied for a license so far. They declined to comment further.
tesla,2017-8,"Musk has said that potential customers are eager to get a Tesla electric long-haul truck, but he faces doubt that the company can deliver."
tesla,2017-8,"While established trucking companies and truck manufacturing startups have poured resources into electrifying local package delivery fleets, battery range limitations have largely kept the industry from making electric trucks that travel across swaths of the country."
tesla,2017-8,Lithium ion battery researcher Venkat Viswanathan of Carnegie Mellon University said electric long-haul trucking is not economically feasible yet.
tesla,2017-8,"""Your cargo essentially becomes the battery,"" Viswanathan said of the massive batteries that would be needed to make range competitive with diesel."
tesla,2017-8,"Diesel trucks used for cross-country hauls by United Parcel Service Inc can travel up to 500 miles (800 km) on a single tank, according to UPS's director of maintenance and engineering, international operations, Scott Phillippi. By comparison, the company's electric local package delivery trucks travel up to 80 miles on a full charge."

tesla,2017-8,"SAN FRANCISCO, Aug 9 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc is developing a long-haul, electric semi-truck that can drive itself and move in ""platoons"" that automatically follow a lead vehicle, and is getting closer to testing a prototype, according to an email discussion of potential road tests between the car company and the Nevada Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV), seen by Reuters."
tesla,2017-8,"Meanwhile, California officials are meeting with Tesla on Wednesday ""to talk about Tesla's efforts with autonomous trucks,"" state DMV spokeswoman Jessica Gonzalez told Reuters."
tesla,2017-8,"The correspondence and meeting show that Tesla is putting self-driving technology into the electric truck it has said it plans to unveil in September, and is advancing towards real-life tests, potentially moving it forward in a highly competitive area of commercial transport also being pursued by Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] and Alphabet Inc's Waymo."
tesla,2017-8,"After announcing intentions a year ago to produce a heavy-duty electric truck a year ago, Musk tweeted in April that the semi-truck would be revealed in September, and repeated that commitment at the company's annual shareholder meeting in June, but has never mentioned any autonomous-driving capabilities."
tesla,2017-8,"Tesla has been a leader in developing autonomous driving capability for its luxury cars, including the lower-priced Model 3, which it is beginning to manufacture."
tesla,2017-8,"Several Silicon Valley companies developing autonomous driving technology are working on long-haul trucks. They see the industry as a prime early market for the technology, citing the relatively consistent speeds and little cross traffic trucks face on interstate highways and the benefits of allowing drivers to rest while trucks travel."
tesla,2017-8,"Some companies also are working on technology for ""platooning"", a driving formation where trucks follow one another closely. If trucks at the back of the formation were able to automatically follow a lead vehicle, that could cut the need for drivers."
tesla,2017-8,"An email exchange in May and June between Tesla and Nevada DMV representatives included an agenda for a June 16 meeting, along with the Nevada Department of Transportation, to discuss testing of two prototype trucks in Nevada, according to the exchange seen by Reuters."
tesla,2017-8,"""To insure we are on the same page, our primary goal is the ability to operate our prototype test trucks in a continuous manner across the state line and within the States of Nevada and California in a platooning and/or Autonomous mode without having a person in the vehicle,"" Tesla regulatory official Nasser Zamani wrote to Nevada DMV official April Sanborn."
tesla,2017-8,"No companies yet have tested self-driving trucks in Nevada without a person in the cab. On July 10, Zamani inquired further to the Nevada DMV about terms for a testing license, an email seen by Reuters shows."
tesla,2017-8,California DMV spokeswoman Gonzalez said that Tesla had requested a meeting on Wednesday to introduce new staff and talk about Tesla's efforts with autonomous trucks. She said that the DMV was not aware of the level of autonomy in the trucks.
tesla,2017-8,"Tesla declined to comment on the matter, referring Reuters to the previous statements by Musk, who has discussed the truck in tweets and at the annual shareholder meeting."
tesla,2017-8,Nevada officials confirmed the meeting with Tesla had occurred and said that Tesla had not applied for a license so far. They declined to comment further.
tesla,2017-8,"Musk has said that potential customers are eager to get a Tesla electric long-haul truck, but he faces doubt that the company can deliver."
tesla,2017-8,"While established trucking companies and truck manufacturing startups have poured resources into electrifying local package delivery fleets, battery range limitations have largely kept the industry from making electric trucks that travel across swaths of the country."
tesla,2017-8,Lithium ion battery researcher Venkat Viswanathan of Carnegie Mellon University said electric long-haul trucking is not economically feasible yet.
tesla,2017-8,"""Your cargo essentially becomes the battery,"" Viswanathan said of the massive batteries that would be needed to make range competitive with diesel."
tesla,2017-8,"Diesel trucks used for cross-country hauls by United Parcel Service Inc can travel up to 500 miles (800 km) on a single tank, according to UPS's director of maintenance and engineering, international operations, Scott Phillippi. By comparison, the company's electric local package delivery trucks travel up to 80 miles on a full charge."

tesla,2017-8,ANALYSIS-Autonomous cars race narrows on doubts about clear path to profit - Reuters News
tesla,2017-8,"{{20170808T093022.247+0000}}ANALYSIS-Autonomous cars race narrows on doubts about clear path to profit* Carmakers look to spread investment burden, risk"
tesla,2017-8,"FRANKFURT/DETROIT, Aug 8 (Reuters) - BMW and Daimler , the world's top luxury carmakers, have announced alliances with suppliers, talking up the virtues of having a bigger pool of engineers to develop a self-driving car."
tesla,2017-8,"But another motive behind these deals, executives and industry experts told Reuters, is a concern that robocars may not live up to the profit expectations that drove an initial investment rush."
tesla,2017-8,Carmakers are increasingly looking to forego outright ownership of future autonomous driving systems in favour of spreading the investment burden and risk.
tesla,2017-8,"The trend represents a clear shift in strategy from little more than a year ago when most automakers were pursuing standalone strategies focussed on tackling the engineering challenge of developing a self-driving car, rather than on the business case."
tesla,2017-8,"""Although it is a substantial market, it may not be worth the scale of investments currently being sunk into it,"" said a board member at one of the German carmakers, who declined to be identified because the matter is confidential."
tesla,2017-8,"Dozens of companies - including carmakers and tech firms like Google and Uber - are vying for a market which, according to consulting firm Frost & Sullivan, will only make up about 10 to 15 percent of vehicles in Europe by 2030. There are sure to be losers."
tesla,2017-8,"""It's impossible for me to believe there will be 50 successful autonomous vehicle software producers,"" said John Hoffecker, global vice chairman of Michigan-based consulting firm AlixPartners."
tesla,2017-8,"In July last year, BMW became the first major carmaker to abandon its solo development of self-driving cars in favour of teaming up with chipmaker Intel and camera and software manufacturer Mobileye to build a platform for autonomous cars technology by 2021."
tesla,2017-8,The decision followed a trip by senior executives to visit startups and suppliers to gauge BMW's competitive position.
tesla,2017-8,"""Sitting at other companies, one rattles off the technological challenges and safety aspects, and you come to realise that many of us are swimming in the same sludge,"" Klaus Buettner, BMW's vice president autonomous driving projects, told Reuters."
tesla,2017-8,"""Everybody is investing billions. Our view was that it makes sense to club together to develop some core systems as a platform."""
tesla,2017-8,"Daimler's Mercedes-Benz has since combined efforts with supplier Bosch [ROBG.UL], three months ago, while Japanese carmaker Honda <7267.T> has said it is open to alliances in the area of autonomous cars. [nL2N1II0L1][nL5N1HC1RX]"
tesla,2017-8,Even deep-pocketed tech companies are teaming up. San Francisco-based transport app operator Lyft and Alphabet Inc's self-driving car unit Waymo pooled their resources in May. [nL2N1IH02T]
tesla,2017-8,"Partial autonomy is already a reality in higher-end cars that keep in lane and adjust their speed in motorway driving. Each of the next stages - ""eyes off"", ""mind off"" and ultimately driverless autonomy - will likely take years to become reality."
tesla,2017-8,"Klaus Froehlich, BMW's board member responsible for development, said the company was likely to lose money with its first fully autonomous vehicles, just like it did with its first-generation electric cars. But developing the technology remains a necessity in order to stay relevant as a carmaker."
tesla,2017-8,"""It is an enabling technology, not a business case,"" he said about BMW's decision to develop autonomous vehicles. ""But if the burden can be shared on a platform, I have nothing against that."""
tesla,2017-8,"One of the most financially promising markets that autonomous technology will open up is driverless on-demand taxis, which may one day come to replace regular cabs and parts of public transport in large cities."
tesla,2017-8,"""Robotaxis"" are expected to drive the wider market for car sharing and ride-hailing, which was worth $53 billion last year and could be worth $2 trillion by 2030, according to a McKinsey study published earlier this year."
tesla,2017-8,"Ford and General Motors are investing at least $2 billion each to develop self-driving vehicles for urban ride-sharing fleets beginning in 2021, competing with incumbents and start-ups."
tesla,2017-8,"The emergence of alliances involving the likes of BMW and Mercedes-Benz comes at a time when regulators are pushing for a creation of standards for the new technology, which has the potential to improve vehicle reflexes and cut accidents by up to 90 percent, according to Boston Consulting Group."
tesla,2017-8,"Industry experts say such standardisation could make it much harder to develop a product which stands out, calling into question the wisdom of high-stakes, go-it-alone strategies."
tesla,2017-8,"In September 2016, the U.S. Department of Transport and the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration released guidance for heavily automated vehicles."
tesla,2017-8,"The regulator urged carmakers to disclose how vehicle reflexes are programmed, particularly when cars are faced with a dilemma, such as choosing between hitting a cyclist or accelerating beyond legal speeds to avoid an accident."
tesla,2017-8,"""It is important to consider whether highly automated vehicles are required to apply particular decision rules in instances of conflicts between safety, mobility, and legality objectives,"" the guidance said."
tesla,2017-8,"""Algorithms for resolving these conflict situations should be developed transparently using input from federal and state regulators, drivers and passengers."""
tesla,2017-8,European regulators too are debating whether to standardise speeds and distances which autonomous cars need to adhere to while weaving in and out of traffic or joining lanes.
tesla,2017-8,"Pressure not to waste development costs is laying the groundwork for alliances and even mergers between the various companies supplying technology for autonomous cars, including makers of vehicles, software, computer chips, radar, camera and laser sensors and high-definition maps."
tesla,2017-8,"BMW, Mercedes and Audi put aside their rivalry and teamed up to buy mapping firm HERE, for example, in order to cut their dependence on Google."
tesla,2017-8,"What starts out as arms-length agreements designed to capture market share, much like code-sharing deals between airlines, may evolve further into takeovers once the next investment round is due, executives and advisers said."
tesla,2017-8,"""Will we see what is happening in aviation be adopted in automotive - where first we see alliances, collaborations and consortiums, and then we see full out market combinations?"" asked Bill Curtin, head of mergers and acquisitions at global law firm Hogan Lovells."

tesla,2017-8,"Aug 7 (Reuters) - U.S. residential solar company Sunrun Inc on Monday reported second-quarter revenue and earnings per share that fell short of Wall Street estimates, sending its shares down nearly 10 percent in extended trading."
tesla,2017-8,"The company exceeded its forecast for rooftop systems deployed by 5 percent and said a board of directors committee investigation had found that questions raised by a Wall Street Journal article about its cancellation policies were ""unfounded."""
tesla,2017-8,"Sunrun is known for its no-money-down financing schemes for residential systems that allow homeowners to pay monthly fees for solar power and avoid tens of thousands of dollars in upfront costs. Unlike rival Tesla Inc , which put the brakes on its rapid solar expansion to preserve cash amid slowing industry growth, Sunrun has kept up a growth rate of about 15 percent and set up shop in several markets this year, including Texas and Florida."
tesla,2017-8,The company is also pursuing ways to use its solar systems and home batteries to help utilities manage their networks.
tesla,2017-8,"""Our product today, which is focused around customer savings, will be evolving where we'll be able to provide value to utilities as well,"" Chief Executive Lynn Jurich said in an interview. ""It opens up a whole other market."""
tesla,2017-8,"Sunrun deployed 76 megawatts of solar systems during the quarter, a 16 percent increase from last year that topped its forecast of 72 MW. It has gained market share this year as rival Tesla has pulled back, executives said."
tesla,2017-8,"Net income available to common shareholders fell 23 percent to $25.1 million, or 23 cents per share, from $32.6 million, or 31 cents per share, a year ago."
tesla,2017-8,Revenue rose more than 12 percent to $137.8 million from $122.5 million last year.

tesla,2017-8,{{20170807T221502.139+0000}}UPDATE 8-Tesla seeks $1.5 bln junk bond issue to fund Model 3 production(Adds comment from bond expert)
tesla,2017-8,"DETROIT, Aug 7 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc said on Monday it would raise about $1.5 billion through its first-ever offering of junk bonds as the U.S. luxury electric car maker seeks fresh sources of cash to ramp up production of its new Model 3 sedan."
tesla,2017-8,The move to issue junk bonds - lower-quality investments that offer higher yields - represents a bet by Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk that bond investors will be as hungry as stock investors to back the company on expectations that its Model 3 will be a hit.
tesla,2017-8,"Tesla shares are up 67 percent this year, pushing the company's market value to about $60 billion, above that of top U.S. automakers General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co , even though Tesla has yet to make an annual profit."
tesla,2017-8,"""Bond investors, who typically don't love companies that don't make money, will be far more forgiving when it comes to Tesla,"" said bond expert Robbie Goffin, managing director of FTI Consulting, citing the company's stellar stock market value."
tesla,2017-8,"Tesla was to start pitching potential investors on Monday, IFR reported, citing lead bankers on the deal. [nL1N1KT0B2]"
tesla,2017-8,"So far, Tesla has been raising money to pay its bills with a combination of equity offerings and convertible bonds, which eventually convert into shares. In March, the company raised $1.4 billion through a convertible debt offering."
tesla,2017-8,"Following the announcement, Standard & Poor's reaffirmed its negative outlook for the automaker and assigned a ""B-"" rating for the bond issue - deep into junk credit territory. S&P also maintained its ""B-"" long-term corporate credit rating on Tesla."
tesla,2017-8,"""We could lower our ratings on Tesla if execution issues related to the Model 3 launch later this year or the ongoing expansion of its Models S and X production lead to significant cost overruns,"" S&P said in a statement on the bonds."
tesla,2017-8,"Moody's assigned a junk ""B3"" rating to the bond issue and said the company's rating outlook was stable."
tesla,2017-8,"The rating agency said the overall company's ""B2"" rating was supported by the fact that if Tesla ends up in serious financial trouble, its brand name, products and physical assets would be of ""considerable value"" to other automakers."
tesla,2017-8,The automaker's debt load increased significantly last year when it bought solar panel maker SolarCity.
tesla,2017-8,"CFRA equity analyst Efraim Levy said the bonds provide Tesla with funds ""at least into mid-2018."""
tesla,2017-8,"""There is a risk they could still run out of money,"" he said. ""Then you'd go back to the equity markets and hope it's not too late"" to raise more money."
tesla,2017-8,"The latest effective yield on single-B rated bonds maturing in seven to eight years, the class for a Tesla issue, is around 5.5 percent, according to Bank of America/Merrill Lynch Fixed Income Index data."
tesla,2017-8,"Tesla's bond will price later this week after several days of meetings with credit investors, who will weigh factors including the absence of a borrowing history, its lack of profit and its high cash-burn rate against its growth potential and its attractiveness as an environmentally friendly ""green"" issuer."
tesla,2017-8,"Ultimately, the depth of investor interest will determine the bond's interest rate."
tesla,2017-8,"Tesla is counting on the Model 3, its least pricey car, to become a profitable, high-volume manufacturer of electric cars. [nL4N1KP58G]"
tesla,2017-8,"Tesla said last week that it had 455,000 net pre-orders for the Model 3, which has a $35,000 base price, and that the sedan was averaging 1,800 reservations per day since it launched late last month."
tesla,2017-8,"At the launch, Musk, however, warned that Tesla would face months of ""manufacturing hell"" as it increases production of the sedan."
tesla,2017-8,"Tesla had over $3 billion in cash on hand at the end of the June quarter, compared with $4 billion on March 31."
tesla,2017-8,"The company has said it expects capital expenditures of $2 billion in the second half of this year to boost production at its Fremont, California assembly plant and a battery plant in Reno, Nevada."
tesla,2017-8,"Tesla's cash burn has prompted short-sellers like Greenlight Capital's David Einhorn to bet against the Palo Alto, California company."
tesla,2017-8,"Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Barclays, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank and RBC are the book-runners on the bond offering, IFR reported."

tesla,2017-8,"Few of these funds are actively buying shares, fund filings show, but instead are letting their stakes balloon as the stock continues to rally. Typically, fund managers prevent any one position from growing beyond 5 percent of assets in order to manage their risk."
tesla,2017-8,"""It's concerning because there's a significant risk in holding that much of any individual stock because you're not getting the benefits of diversification, particularly with a company that is as volatile as Tesla is,"" said Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF and mutual fund research at CFRA in New York."
tesla,2017-8,"At 19.4 percent of assets, the $2.1-billion Baron Partners fund has the largest individual stake in Tesla, with 19.5 percent of assets, while another Baron fund, the $185-million Baron Focused Growth fund, has the second-largest position with 17.3 percent of assets in the company."
tesla,2017-8,"Both funds began buying shares of Tesla in 2014 and are up more than 18 percent for the year, nearly double the 10 percent gain for the broad S&P 500."
tesla,2017-8,"Baron declined to comment. Ron Baron, the fund's manager, said in June that he thinks that Tesla could hit $1,000 per share by 2020, a 181-percent gain from its current price of approximately $356 per share."
tesla,2017-8,"At 10 percent of assets, the $66-million ARK Industrial Innovation ETF has the largest position in Tesla among all exchange-traded funds, according to Morningstar. The actively-managed fund, which aims to buy companies following a theme of disruptive innovation, is up 33.7 percent for the year."
tesla,2017-8,"Sector ETFs are more likely than actively-managed funds to have outsized positions in individual companies, largely because they track market-weighted indexes that themselves are often top-heavy, Rosenbluth said."
tesla,2017-8,"The $12.9-billion Consumer Discretionary Select SPDR ETF , for instance, has 15.1 percent of its assets in shares of Amazon.com Inc, while the $3.8 billion iShares MSCI South Korea Capped ETF holds 22.9 percent of its assets in shares of Samsung Electronics Co Ltd <005930.KS>."
tesla,2017-8,"Investors in ETFs are more likely to accept greater individual company risk as long as the portfolio is representative of a sector, Rosenbluth said."

tesla,2017-8,"DETROIT, Aug 7 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc said on Monday it would raise about $1.5 billion through its first-ever high-yield junk bond offering, as the U.S. luxury electric car maker seeks fresh sources of cash to ramp up production of its new Model 3 sedan."
tesla,2017-8,"The debt offering marks Tesla's debut in the junk-bond market and the company will start road-shows on Monday, IFR reported, citing lead bankers on the deal. [nL1N1KT0B2]"
tesla,2017-8,"Tesla has been riding high on investor expectations that its Model 3 will be a mass-market hit, with shareholders pushing its market value above that of General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co , the top two U.S. automakers that produce millions of cars each annually."
tesla,2017-8,"But Tesla has yet to make an annual profit and its stock is a favorite among short-sellers, who continue to bet Tesla will fall short of its shareholders' high hopes."
tesla,2017-8,"So far, Tesla has been raising money to pay its bills with a combination of equity offerings and convertible bonds, which eventually convert into shares. In March, the company raised $1.4 billion through a convertible debt offering."
tesla,2017-8,"Following the announcement, Standard & Poor's reaffirmed its negative outlook for the automaker and assigned a ""B-"" rating for the bond issue - deep into junk credit territory. S&P also maintained its ""B-"" long-term corporate credit rating on Tesla."
tesla,2017-8,"""We could lower our ratings on Tesla if execution issues related to the Model 3 launch later this year or the ongoing expansion of its Models S and X production lead to significant cost overruns,"" S&P said in a statement on the bonds."
tesla,2017-8,"Moody's assigned a junk ""B3"" rating to the bond issue and said the company's rating outlook was stable."
tesla,2017-8,"The rating agency said the overall company's ""B2"" rating was supported by the fact that if Tesla ends up in serious financial trouble, its brand name, products and physical assets would be of ""considerable value"" to other automakers."
tesla,2017-8,"""The major challenge facing the company during the next twelve months will largely be the considerable execution risks associated with the rapid ramp-up in production of a totally new vehicle,"" Mood's senior vice president Bruce Clark said in a statement."
tesla,2017-8,The automaker's debt load increased significantly last year when it bought solar panel maker SolarCity.
tesla,2017-8,"CFRA equity analyst Efraim Levy said the bonds provide Tesla with funds ""at least into mid-2018."""
tesla,2017-8,"""There is a risk they could still run out of money,"" he said. ""Then you'd go back to the equity markets and hope it's not too late"" to raise more money."
tesla,2017-8,"The latest effective yield on single-B rated bonds maturing in seven to eight years, the class for a Tesla issue, is around 5.5 percent, according to Bank of America/Merrill Lynch Fixed Income Index data."
tesla,2017-8,"Tesla's bond will price later this week after several days of meetings with credit investors, who will weigh factors including the absence of a borrowing history, its lack of profit and its high cash-burn rate against its growth potential and its attractiveness as an environmentally-friendly ""green"" issuer."
tesla,2017-8,"Ultimately, the depth of investor interest will determine the bond's interest rate."

tesla,2017-8,{{20170807T174922.194+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-Musk fine-tunes Tesla with junk-fueled turbo boost(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.)
tesla,2017-8,"NEW YORK, Aug 7 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Elon Musk is an entrepreneur in a bubble. Forced to choose between issuing a bit more of Tesla's turbocharged stock or tapping the overheated junk-bond market to finance the Model 3 ramp-up, the founder opted for the latter. It raises execution risk for the $60 billion electric-car maker, but not by enough to persuade the chief executive to loosen his grip on the wheel."
tesla,2017-8,"Tesla has just over $3 billion in cash, but it's burning through roughly a billion a quarter as it embarks on one of the most daunting gambits in automotive history: taking production of its mass-market vehicle from zero to 400,000 or more a year in just 18 months."
tesla,2017-8,"Fortunately for Musk, investors can't seem to shower his ambitions with too much money. Tesla's stock has risen by 67 percent so far this year. The company is valued at some 27 times 2020 earnings, implying the kind of growth that even the most bullish of analysts don't expect, according to Breakingviews calculations."
tesla,2017-8,"The textbook financing solution would be to issue more of that high-priced paper. Selling 5 million shares at a 15 percent discount to market would raise the same $1.5 billion and dilute Musk's 20.4 percent stake by only 3 percent, assuming he didn't pitch in more himself."
tesla,2017-8,"But he doesn't have to when the high-yield bond market is on a tear. Investors desperate for income have depressed the yield gap between single-B-rated junk bonds and U.S. Treasuries by nearly 2 percentage points over the past year, to 3.59 points, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch. S&P Global Ratings affirmed its B-minus rating on Tesla, saying the boost to liquidity should offset the company's ""significant execution risks."""
tesla,2017-8,"The bond sale will raise debt to a lofty 5.5 times forecast 2017 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. But EBITDA is set to more than double next year to $2.2 billion and then almost treble by 2020, according to Thomson Reuters data. Even if Musk is not as successful as Wall Street estimates, he should sell more than enough cars to make the leverage, and the additional interest bill, easy for bondholders to swallow."
tesla,2017-8,"- Tesla on Aug. 7 said it would offer $1.5 billion of senior notes due 2025. It will use the proceeds to strengthen its balance sheet as it scales up production of the Model 3, the electric-car maker's first mass-market vehicle, which it launched on July 28. It plans to increase output to 5,000 units a week by the end of this year and 10,000 a week by the end of 2018, Chief Executive Elon Musk said on Aug. 2."

tesla,2017-8,Demand for battery-grade lithium compounds is expected to skyrocket in the next decades in tandem with soaring demand for electric cars as governments and individual consumers try to reduce their carbon footprint.
tesla,2017-8,"Although there's plenty of lithium around, the problem is ensuring there is enough capacity to process it."
tesla,2017-8,"Battery makers and other end-users such as car manufacturers will need to sign multi-year deals that encourage large producers to invest more, and faster, industry sources say."
tesla,2017-8,"""We've established the timeline for our own expansion based on the commitments our customers are making with us,"" said Tom Schneberger, global business director at U.S.-listed FMC Lithium , one of the world's top four producers."

tesla,2017-8,"By 2050, 81 percent of 132 million new auto sales will be electric, Morgan Stanley says."
tesla,2017-8,"The lithium-ion batteries needed to power electric cars use lithium carbonate or lithium hydroxide, but the industry typically talks in terms of lithium carbonate equivalent which contains both."
tesla,2017-8,"One is hard rock as found in Australia, for which ready-to- go capacity to produce battery grade lithium can take up to three years. The other is brine, mostly found in Chile and Argentina, which can take seven years or more."

tesla,2017-8,"Demand for lithium hydroxide, preferred over carbonate as it allows greater battery capacity and longer life, is expected to grow at a faster pace. Benchmark predicts the price to average $18,000 a tonne between 2017-2020 against $14,000 in 2015-2016."

tesla,2017-8,"Roskill managing director Robert Baylis estimates FMC, Albemarle, SQM and China's Tianqi Lithium Corporation <002466.SZ> together accounted for 66 percent of the world's lithium carbonate equivalent last year. Wood Mackenzie consultant James Whiteside puts the figure at 78 percent."
tesla,2017-8,"FMC's lithium hydroxide capacity rose 80 percent in 2017 to 18,000 tonnes a year, and it has plans to boost that to 30,000 tonnes by the end of 2019. After that, capacity will be expanded as required by demand, FMC's Schneberger said."

tesla,2017-8,"SQM said in an email it was planning to invest $50 million to expand its lithium carbonate capacity in Chile to 63,000 tonnes by 2018 from 48,000 tonnes currently. It also has joint ventures in Argentina and Australia to develop deposits."

tesla,2017-8,"Demand for lithium hydroxide, preferred over carbonate as it allows greater battery capacity and longer life, is expected to grow at a faster pace. Benchmark predicts the price to average $18,000 a tonne between 2017-2020 against $14,000 in 2015-2016."
tesla,2017-8,Top producers are looking at a bonanza if they can ramp up investment fast enough with end-user commitments in hand.
tesla,2017-8,"""There are four names that dominate and that is likely to be the case for the next five years,"" said Jeremy Kent, a portfolio manager at Allianz Global Investors."
tesla,2017-8,"Roskill managing director Robert Baylis estimates FMC, Albemarle, SQM and China's Tianqi Lithium Corporation <002466.SZ> together accounted for 66 percent of the world's lithium carbonate equivalent last year. Wood Mackenzie consultant James Whiteside puts the figure at 78 percent."
tesla,2017-8,"FMC's lithium hydroxide capacity rose 80 percent in 2017 to 18,000 tonnes a year, and it has plans to boost that to 30,000 tonnes by the end of 2019. After that, capacity will be expanded as required by demand, FMC's Schneberger said."
tesla,2017-8,"Albemarle is planning to expand its lithium carbonate equivalent capacity to 165,000 tonnes by 2021 from 89,000 tonnes this year, a spokesperson said. ""We anticipate spending $700 million and $1 billion over the next 5 years."""
tesla,2017-8,"SQM said in an email it was planning to invest $50 million to expand its lithium carbonate capacity in Chile to 63,000 tonnes by 2018 from 48,000 tonnes currently. It also has joint ventures in Argentina and Australia to develop deposits."
tesla,2017-8,"Another company actively investing is Australia's Orocobre, which planned to produce 17,500 tonnes a year of lithium carbonate at its Olaroz facility in Argentina."
tesla,2017-8,"Whiteside said Orocobre's difficulties were typical of many smaller players, noting that the Olaroz facility was the first new major brine operation started in 20 years."
tesla,2017-8,"""Because the number of brine operations has been so few historically, there are very few technically experienced chemical engineers to assist these junior companies,"" he said."
tesla,2017-8,"""There are people out there promoting brine projects with plans that are not as robust as they should be."""

tesla,2017-8,"{{20170805T130907.281+0000}}Tesla lowers price of Model X, saying margins improvedSAN FRANCISCO, Aug 4 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc on Friday lowered the base price of its Model X SUV to $79,500 and said improving margins were behind the move, which came as the automaker is ramping up production of its new lower-priced Model 3."
tesla,2017-8,"Some analysts have been concerned that the launch of the Model 3, whose base price is $35,000, would steer some potential buyers away from the Model X SUV to that lower-priced sedan."
tesla,2017-8,But Chief Executive Elon Musk said earlier this week that demand had not waned for the luxury electric sport-utility vehicle.
tesla,2017-8,"""When we launched Model X 75D, it had a low gross margin. As we've achieved efficiencies, we are able to lower the price and pass along more value to our customers,"" Tesla in a statement on Friday announcing it had lowered the previous $82,500 starting price of the vehicle by $3,000."
tesla,2017-8,"The most expensive version of the Model X, the P100D, with fastest acceleration and longer range, costs $145,000."
tesla,2017-8,"Musk said on a call with analysts earlier this week that the launch of the Model 3 had not cannibalized Model X sales, and that demand for the Model X as well as the Model S had actually increased with the release of the lower-priced vehicle."
tesla,2017-8,"The Model 3, marketed as a car for the masses, begins at $35,000 before incentives, but a longer-range version is priced at $44,000, to compete with high volume luxury sedans such as the Audi A4, BMW 3-series or Mercedes C-Class. [nL3N1KK05W]"

tesla,2017-8,"{{20170805T130830.379+0000}}VW brand CEO says Tesla has abilities VW lacksFRANKFURT, Aug 4 (Reuters) - Volkswagen the world's largest carmaker by sales, is looking to loss-making startup Tesla for inspiration on how to improve its core business, the VW brand's chief executive Herbert Diess said in an interview published on VW's website."
tesla,2017-8,"Asked who VW's main competitors are, Diess told an internal company publication: ""In the old world it is Toyota, Hyundai, and the French carmakers. In the new world it is Tesla."""
tesla,2017-8,"Tesla, headed by Elon Musk, has shaken up the auto industry with its ambition to build a mass market for electric cars, posing a competitive threat to established carmakers, which remain reliant on producing cars with combustion engines."
tesla,2017-8,"Diess said the Volkswagen brand, which sold 5,987,800 cars last year, is seeking to catch up with and overtake smaller California-based Tesla, which sold 83,922 cars last year."
tesla,2017-8,"""Tesla belongs among the competitors which has abilities that we currently do not have,"" Diess said in the interview with ""Inside"", a publication for VW employees."
tesla,2017-8,"Around half of Tesla's engineers are software experts, while at VW's core brand it is a much lower proportion, Diess said. Tesla has good electric motors, a fast charging network, autonomous driving technology, internet connectivity, and a new approach toward vehicle distribution."

tesla,2017-8,* Toyota to take 5 pct stake in Mazda; Mazda 0.25 pct in Toyota
tesla,2017-8,"TOKYO, Aug 4 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T> said on Friday it planned to take a 5 percent share of smaller Japanese rival Mazda Motor Corp <7261.T>, as part of an alliance that will see the two build a $1.6 billion U.S. assembly plant and work together on electric vehicles."
tesla,2017-8,"The plant was a surprise for investors at a time of cooling U.S. sales, but marked good news for U.S. President Donald Trump who came to office on the back of promises to bring back manufacturing and jobs for U.S. workers. He commented on Twitter that it was a ""great investment in American manufacturing""."
tesla,2017-8,"The plant, whose location is not yet public, will be able to produce 300,000 vehicles a year, with production divided between the two automakers, and employ about 4,000 people. It will start operating in 2021."
tesla,2017-8,"Analysts said the plan was more than a political ploy. The alliance is also an attempt to catch up with rivals in the race for electric car technology, as tighter global emissions rules loom, along with the entry of new players into the market."
tesla,2017-8,"""There will be new rivals appearing - Apple , Google - these are IT companies, we also need to compete with them, too,"" Toyota President Akio Toyoda, grandson of the company's founder, told a news conference in Tokyo."
tesla,2017-8,"He was appointed last year to lead Toyota's newly formed electric car division, flagging the group's commitment to a technology it has been slow to embrace."
tesla,2017-8,"""What's different from the past is that there are no nautical charts for us to follow. It's without precedent,"" he said of the push into alternatives to the internal combustion engine."
tesla,2017-8,"Other traditional automakers such as Daimler and BMW are also weighing how best to work on new, disruptive technology, from electric vehicles to autonomous driving, that require hefty investment and have turned firms like Google and Tesla into rivals."
tesla,2017-8,"Toyota has set a goal for all of its vehicles to be zero emission by 2050. But until recently, it has said it favoured EVs for short-distance commuting, given their limited driving range and lengthy charging time."
tesla,2017-8,"It has been investing heavily in hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles (FCVs), while rivals such as Nissan Motor Co <7201.T>, Volkswagen AG and Tesla have touted pure electric cars as the most viable zero-emission vehicles."
tesla,2017-8,"As part of the agreement, as well as electric car technology, Toyota and Mazda will work together to develop in-car information technologies and automated driving functions."
tesla,2017-8,"Toyota, Japan's biggest auto company, has been forging alliances with smaller rivals for several years, effectively engineering a loose network at the heart of the Japanese auto sector. It already owns a 16.5 percent stake in sixth-ranked Subaru Corp <7270.T> with which it also has a development partnership."
tesla,2017-8,"Toyota is also courting compact car maker Suzuki Motor Corp <7269.T> to cooperate on R&D and parts supply, as Toyota seeks to tap its smaller rival's expertise in emerging Asian markets."
tesla,2017-8,"As part of Friday's plan, Toyota, the world's second-largest automaker by vehicle sales last year, will take a 5 percent share of Mazda, and Mazda will take a 0.25 percent share of Toyota."
tesla,2017-8,"Mazda said it could even expand the alliance, as long as it could stay in control of its own management. ""We will study the possibility of expanding the capital alliance, but the basic premise is that autonomy is assured,"" said Mazda Executive Vice President Akira Marumoto."
tesla,2017-8,"A stake in Mazda may also prevent future incursions by tech companies, one analyst said."
tesla,2017-8,"""For a technology company which lacks the expertise in making cars, Mazda could look like a very interesting acquisition. They're very good, they're not too expensive. Maybe Toyota realises this,"" CLSA managing director Chris Richter said."
tesla,2017-8,"""By buying a 5 percent stake, Toyota takes Mazda off the table rather than having it sit out there like a free agent which could someday be used against them."""
tesla,2017-8,"Mazda, for its part, stands to gain from a deal that gives the small automaker a production foothold in the United States. At the moment, it ships all vehicles sold in the country, its biggest market, from its plants in Japan and Mexico."
tesla,2017-8,"With an R&D budget of around 140 billion yen ($1.27 billion) this year, a fraction of Toyota's 1 trillion yen, Mazda lacks the funds to develop electric cars on its own, a predicament shared by Subaru and Suzuki."
tesla,2017-8,"""Mazda needs electrification technology. In the past, they've pooh-poohed EVs, they've felt they can make internal combustion engines more efficient, but the bottom line is that globally you need to have this technology,"" said Janet Lewis, head of Asia transportation research at Macquarie Securities."
tesla,2017-8,"The automakers plan to produce Toyota Corollas and a new Mazda SUV crossover at the new plant, and the companies said they could eventually build other cars including electric vehicles."
tesla,2017-8,"Toyota initially had been planning to produce Corollas at its new $1 billion plant being built in Mexico, prompting Trump to threaten punitive tariffs."
tesla,2017-8,The company has since said it will instead produce its Tacoma truck model in Mexico.
tesla,2017-8,{{20170805T042237.365+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-Toyota tunes up with Mazda deal(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.)
tesla,2017-8,"Carmaking is an expensive, scale-dependent business, so partnerships abound. Toyota itself recently took over Daihatsu <6023.T>; already owns bits of Subaru <7270.T> and Isuzu <7202.T>; and is talking to Suzuki <7269.T> about collaboration. This particular tie-up was also a long time coming. Talks started in 2015, and the two have already worked together in other ways."
tesla,2017-8,"Toyota has an increasing incentive to do deals. The critical U.S. market has shifted away from cars, where Toyota is traditionally stronger, toward trucks and sports utility vehicles. The advent of electric and self-driving cars has upset the industry, introducing new competitors such as Tesla . President Akio Toyoda recently admitted the automobile business was changing faster than expected."
tesla,2017-8,"Quarterly results on Friday showed operating profit falling 10.6 percent to 574 billion yen ($5.2 billion), even as Toyota cut costs. Currency fluctuations allowed the company to lift its full-year operating-profit forecast to 1.85 trillion yen, but this would still mark a second straight year of decline."
tesla,2017-8,"Toyota apparently never got this memo. Eikon data shows it holds $52 billion of stock in rivals, parts makers, and in other industries: a huge sum, even for a $168 billion outfit. Keeping the core business roadworthy matters more, but one day Toyota ought to hold a garage sale."
tesla,2017-8,"- Japanese carmakers Toyota and Mazda Motor said on Aug. 4 they will build a $1.6 billion U.S. plant, capable of making 300,000 vehicles a year, and take stakes in each other. The duo will also work jointly on producing electric and connected cars."
tesla,2017-8,"- Toyota will acquire new stock worth 50 billion yen ($455 million) in Mazda, giving it 5.1 percent of the enlarged company. Mazda will buy treasury shares in Toyota with an equivalent value, giving it a 0.25 percent stake."
tesla,2017-8,"- Also on Aug. 4, Toyota said it made an operating profit of 574 billion yen ($5.2 billion) in the three months to end-June, on sales of 7 trillion yen. Consolidated vehicle sales for the first quarter were 2.2 million units."

tesla,2017-8,UPDATE 3-Tesla surges as Wall Street bets on Model 3 - Reuters News
tesla,2017-8,"{{20170803T220122.373+0000}}UPDATE 3-Tesla surges as Wall Street bets on Model 3(Adds comments from portfolio managers, analyst )"
tesla,2017-8,"NEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO, Aug 3 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc jumped over 6 percent on Thursday as its quarterly report fueled bets that its new Model 3 sedan would propel the luxury electric carmaker into the mainstream."
tesla,2017-8,"Chief Executive Elon Musk is counting on the Model 3, Tesla's least pricey car, to make the company profitable and establish it as the leading electric carmaker ahead of BMW, General Motors and other long-established players."
tesla,2017-8,"Tesla's stock is up 63 percent in 2017, underscoring Wall Street's confidence in Musk."
tesla,2017-8,"The Palo Alto, California company late on Wednesday reported quarterly results that beat average analyst estimates, and said it received more than 1,800 reservations per day for the Model 3 since its launch last week. [nL1N1KP01U]"
tesla,2017-8,"Tesla had $3 billion in cash on hand at the end of the June quarter, reassuring investors who were worried after Musk warned on Friday that the automaker would face six months of ""manufacturing hell"" in ramping up production of the Model 3."
tesla,2017-8,"Tesla's cash burn, expected to top $2 billion this year, has prompted short-sellers like Greenlight Capital's David Einhorn to bet against the company [L1N1KN1FE], and some analysts expect the carmaker to seek extra funding this year."
tesla,2017-8,"Musk said investors should have ""zero concern"" Tesla would fail to reach its production target of 10,000 vehicles each week by the end of 2018."
tesla,2017-8,Skeptics believe Tesla's aggressive production targets are unrealistic and the company's electric cars will be overtaken by larger automakers.
tesla,2017-8,"Yet at least two brokerages raised their price targets following Tesla's report. RBC Capital Markets upped its target price by $31 to $345, pushing it well ahead of the median target of $322, according to Thomson Reuters data."
tesla,2017-8,"""While we don't have meaningful reason to doubt that Tesla can eventually achieve its targets, doing so in a timely manner without some growing pains could prove challenging,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst Joseph Spak wrote in a research note."
tesla,2017-8,"Portfolio managers who hold shares of Tesla say they saw the most recent quarter as further evidence Musk will deliver on his promise of building a product that consumers want, even if he sometimes misses deadlines."
tesla,2017-8,"""Investors trust Musk because he's made it work. It's not that every one of his predictions have come true on schedule, but they have all come true,"" said Kevin Landis, a portfolio manager at Firsthand Funds who holds shares of the company."
tesla,2017-8,"The $35,000 base-price Model 3 is Tesla's least expensive car. It is designed and priced to compete with high-volume luxury sedans like the Audi A4, BMW 3-series or Mercedes C-Class. Those typically sell for between $40,000 and $50,000, or about half the price of Tesla's previously launched cars, the Model S or Model X."
tesla,2017-8,"David Kudla, chief investment strategist at Mainstay Capital Management, who shorted Tesla in the past but does not have a current position on its shares, said he expected Musk to go back to capital markets before year end to raise extra funding."
tesla,2017-8,"Musk said on an earnings call with analysts Wednesday that while Tesla was not considering an equity raise, ""we are thinking about debt"" issuance."
tesla,2017-8,"The sooner the company does that, the better shape it will be in, Kudla added, saying he expected more delays and slow-downs as the company ramps up Model 3 output."
tesla,2017-8,"""There are so many things that can go wrong,"" he added."
tesla,2017-8,"Yet Scott Goginsky, a portfolio manager at the Biondo Growth fund, said Tesla's rich valuation should allow the company to raise additional capital if necessary without overly-diluting its share price."
tesla,2017-8,"He said he had been trimming his holding in the company not over concern with its fundamentals, but to prevent it from becoming too large a position in his portfolio."
tesla,2017-8,"""People want the car. They will definitely sell it. It's just a matter of whether they can make it fast enough,"" he said."

tesla,2017-8,"NEW YORK, Aug 1 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Elon Musk has tried to rebrand the $50 billion Tesla as an energy company. Last year the founder and chief executive splashed out more than $2 billion on solar-panel installer SolarCity. In February he dropped ""Motors"" from the corporate name. And last month he made a high-profile bet on energy storage in South Australia. Yet Tesla's future still rests on making the newly launched Model 3 sedan into a mass-market success."
tesla,2017-8,"Employees weighed in on Monday. The self-styled Tesla Workers' Organizing Committee sent an open letter to the company's board complaining of an injury rate higher than not just competitors but ""sawmills and slaughter houses"" too. It also suggested shop-floor staff should be given more chance to identify problems and solutions in the production process. That's hardly encouraging."
tesla,2017-8,"Wednesday's second-quarter earnings report will reveal more about Tesla's investment in the Model 3 than the production trajectory: Wall Street expects a $335 million loss. Even at current output levels, though, cars account for more the 90 percent of Tesla's top line. Assuming Musk hits his production target, Tesla's revenue would more than triple from last year's $7 billion to at least $22.5 billion, assuming all vehicles sold were Model 3s at an average price of $45,000."
tesla,2017-8,"That puts anything but electric cars in the shade. Granted, Musk used recent power outages in South Australia to play up Tesla's energy credentials. He won a contract from the state to provide battery storage for unused wind and solar energy in part by offering to swallow the costs if he could not complete the job within 100 days. That puts around $50 million on the line, he reckons."
tesla,2017-8,"In the meantime, however, the SolarCity acquisition looks wobbly. Musk's co-founders and cousins Peter and Lyndon Rive both left in recent months. Unless Musk has something else up his sleeve, Tesla is, now more than ever, a carmaker."
tesla,2017-8,"- Tesla is set to report second-quarter earnings after the U.S. stock market closes at 4 p.m. EDT on Aug. 2. The consensus estimate of sell-side analysts is for a loss of $335 million, or $1.83 a share."
tesla,2017-8,"- On July 28 Tesla officially launched its Model 3 mass-market sedan. Chief Executive Elon Musk said at the launch event that customers had placed more than 500,000 advance reservations. He said the company is ""going to go through at least six months of manufacturing hell"" as it attempts to increase production of all its vehicles to a rate of half a million a year by the end of 2018."
tesla,2017-8,"- Tesla confirmed on July 18 that Peter Rive, co-founder of SolarCity, would be leaving the company. Tesla bought the solar-panel installer last year for $2.6 billion. Rive's brother, co-founder and former Chief Executive Lyndon Rive, left Tesla earlier in the year. Tesla founder and boss Musk is their cousin."

tesla,2017-8,"FRANKFURT/MUNICH, Aug 1 (Reuters) - Infineon will supply parts to Tesla's upcoming mass-market Model 3 electric car, the German chipmaker said on Tuesday, after being beaten out as initial supplier by Franco-Italian rival STMicroelectronics for the coveted deal."
tesla,2017-8,"Infineon, which supplies chips to control the batteries and motors in eight out of 10 of the world's top selling electric vehicles, confirmed its parts would go into the Model 3, which is now ramping up for volume production in 2018."
tesla,2017-8,"""We do not comment on the individual models, but we will also will be present in Model 3,"" Chief Executive Reinhard Ploss told reporters after Infineon reported third-quarter operating profit just ahead of analysts' consensus forecast."
tesla,2017-8,"The German company's products are already in Tesla's Model S sports car, the world's top-selling electric vehicle, but the Model 3 - costing $35,000 in the United States - has the potential to significantly outsell the $60,000 Model S."
tesla,2017-8,"STMicroelectronics was first to market with a new class of highly energy efficient 1,200-volt silicon-carbide chips, which brokerage Liberum said helped it win the initial deal to supply power chips for the Model 3. But it predicted Infineon would become a second source of such chips as volumes ramp next year."
tesla,2017-8,"While its presence in the Model 3 could be a boost, Ploss said most of the demand for Infineon's electric vehicle parts would continue to come from Asia. ""Our success is very much dependent on Asia,"" he said."
tesla,2017-8,"The company reaffirmed its projection for 8-11 percent revenue growth for the year ending in September, and said its annual operating profit margin, excluding certain items, would be unchanged around 17 percent."
