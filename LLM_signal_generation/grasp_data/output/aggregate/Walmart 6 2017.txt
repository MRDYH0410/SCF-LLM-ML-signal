walmart,2017-6,"BEIJING, June 29 (Reuters) - China's top online retailers and U.S. superstore giant Walmart are scrambling to satisfy the voracious appetites of consumers excited about the first American beef to arrive in the world's most populous nation in 14 years."
walmart,2017-6,"""I am a frequent buyer of steak so I can tell the quality by its colour and marbling,"" said one woman on Thursday at a Sams Club store in Beijing owned by Walmart. She selected a 211 yuan ($31.13) pack of newly arrived U.S. steak over her usual choice from Australia."
walmart,2017-6,"""This looks tasty, worth a try,"" she said, declining to be named. Other shoppers at the store said imported beef was superior in quality and worth its hefty price."
walmart,2017-6,"Beef is the fastest-growing meat sector in China, outstripping stagnant demand for more widely eaten pork, with consumers seeking healthier sources of protein and adopting Western eating habits. [nL3N1JH3EL]"
walmart,2017-6,"China's beef imports hit $2.6 billion last year, making it the world's fastest-growing overseas market for the meat. Consumer excitement about the lifting of a 2003 ban due to a scare over mad cow disease looks set to help U.S. beef grab a significant share of that demand."
walmart,2017-6,"U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue is in Beijing to mark the return of U.S. beef to China, and is expected on Friday to meet his Chinese counterpart, Agriculture Minister Han Changfu, as well as Vice Premier Wang Yang."
walmart,2017-6,Some of the millions who buy food online are expected to join the woman in the Sams Club store as some of the first to buy U.S. beef in China in more than a decade. Social media has been buzzing for weeks with those ready to tuck into American steak.
walmart,2017-6,"""American steak is delicious,"" said one user on China's Twitter-like Weibo service. ""It doesn't have the mutton smell of domestic beef."""
walmart,2017-6,"Womai.com, owned by food giant COFCO [CNCOF.UL], said it had received more than 1,605 orders for beef from U.S. meat giant Tyson by late Wednesday. JD.com , one of the country's biggest online retailers, has started pre-sales of U.S. beef ahead of the product's availability from mid-July."
walmart,2017-6,"Online meat is typically around 10 percent cheaper than it is in stores, according to Euromonitor."
walmart,2017-6,"Imported meat accounted for more than 30 percent of JD.com's meat sales last year, with Australian beef the top category and the most searched-for item, the company said."
walmart,2017-6,"Still, food safety fears linger, despite Beijing's stringent import requirements."
walmart,2017-6,"One Sams Club shopper, surnamed Huang, was worried about more than beautiful marbling: ""We should not only stick to foreign beef. They have food safety issues, like growth hormones and GMOs (genetically modified organisms) in the U.S."""

walmart,2017-6,"PARIS, June 29 (Reuters) - Shares in French retailer Carrefour slipped on Thursday as analysts said its planned $1.7 billion initial public offering (IPO) of its Brazilian business broadly met their valuations."
walmart,2017-6,"Carrefour, the world's second-largest retailer behind Wal-Mart , plans to list the Atacadao business on July 20 on the Sao Paulo exchange with a 15-20 percent free float and an indicative price tag of 15 to 19 reais per share. [nL1N1JP1Z8]."
walmart,2017-6,"This would give the Brazilian arm an equity value of 7.9 billion to 10 billion euros, compared to market estimates of around 9 billion euros ($10.3 billion), analysts said."
walmart,2017-6,"Carrefour had already flagged that it was targeting the Brazilian IPO this year to accelerate its expansion in the South American country, its second-largest market after France."
walmart,2017-6,"Carrefour shares initially rose but then lost ground to stand 1.4 percent lower at 22.12 euros by mid-afternoon, with analysts signalling that the valuation of the Brazilian business had only met earlier market forecasts, rather than beating them."
walmart,2017-6,"""We are valuing Carrefour Brazil at 9 billion euros or 8 times EV/EBITDA (enterprise value to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation), so do not see the valuation range as surprising,"" said Deutsche Bank analysts in a note, keeping a ""hold"" rating on Carrefour shares."
walmart,2017-6,"Analysts at Bernstein, who kept a ""market perform"" rating on Carrefour, also said that much of the impact from the Brazilian IPO had already been factored into Carrefour's stock price."
walmart,2017-6,"Bernstein analysts said in an updated note that pricing at the top of the indicative range would add 2.5 euros to its 'Sum Of The Parts' (SOTP) price for Carrefour, while an IPO at the bottom part of that range would add 0.2 euros to that price."
walmart,2017-6,"Deutsche Bank expects the IPO proceeds to strengthen Carrefour Brazil's balance sheet ""by reimbursing gradually between 500 million and 1 billion euros of intercompany debt with Carrefour,"" and help fund possible acquisitions in Brazil."
walmart,2017-6,Morgan Stanley said Carrefour's Brazil business was a strong asset which was likely to attract significant interest from investors.
walmart,2017-6,"""One of the potential risks to Atacadao's equity story, though, is that it might want to rely too aggressively on acquisitions to accelerate its expansion,"" added Morgan Stanley, keeping an ""equal-weight"" rating."
walmart,2017-6,"Carrefour added that because of the Brazilian IPO, it was bringing forward its second-quarter sales figures to July 6 from July 12. It will release first-half earnings on August 30."

walmart,2017-6,"LOS ANGELES, June 21 (Reuters) - Major U.S. corporations such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc and General Motors Co have become some of America's biggest buyers of renewable energy, driving growth in an industry seen as key to helping the United States cut carbon emissions."
walmart,2017-6,"Last year nearly 40 percent of U.S. wind contracts were signed by corporate power users, along with university and military customers. That's up from just 5 percent in 2013, according to the American Wind Energy Association trade group."
walmart,2017-6,"These users also accounted for an unprecedented 10% of the market for large-scale solar projects in 2016, figures from research firm GTM Research show. Just two years earlier there were none."
walmart,2017-6,"Costs for solar and wind are plunging thanks to technological advances and increased global production of panels and turbines. Coupled with tax breaks and other incentives, big energy users such as GM are finding renewables to be competitive with, and often cheaper than, conventional sources of electricity."
walmart,2017-6,"The automaker has struck deals with two Texas wind farms that will soon provide enough energy to power over a dozen GM facilities, including the U.S. sport utility vehicle assembly plant in Arlington, Texas that produces the Chevrolet Tahoe, Cadillac Escalade and GMC Yukon."
walmart,2017-6,"The company is already saving $5 million a year worldwide, according to Rob Threlkeld, GM's global manager of renewable energy, and has committed to obtaining 100% of its power from clean sources by 2050."
walmart,2017-6,"""It's been primarily all driven off economics,"" Threlkeld said. ""Wind and solar costs are coming down so fast that it made it feasible."""
walmart,2017-6,"Growing corporate demand for green energy comes as U.S. President Donald Trump is championing fossil fuels and targeting environmental regulations as job killers. This month he announced the United States will withdraw from the landmark Paris Agreement to fight climate change, a move that was condemned by several prominent U.S. executives, including General Electric Co Chief Executive Jeff Immelt."
walmart,2017-6,"Trump's administration, however, has made no moves to target federal tax incentives for renewable energy projects, thanks mainly to bipartisan support in Congress. Many Republican lawmakers hail from states that are major solar or wind energy producers, among them Texas, Oklahoma and Iowa."
walmart,2017-6,"This year alone, home improvement retailer Home Depot Inc , wireless provider T-Mobile US Inc , banker Goldman Sachs and food producer General Mills announced major purchases of renewable energy."
walmart,2017-6,"Such deals can take many forms, but most are so-called power purchase agreements. Known as PPAs, these are roughly 10-to-20-year contracts in which the owner of a large solar or wind project sells electricity to large customers, often at rates lower than those charged by utilities. These agreements allow energy users to buy renewables at attractive prices with no upfront investment."
walmart,2017-6,These agreements also help companies avoid outages if the sun doesn't shine or the wind doesn't blow. The massive wind farms and solar plants that support these contracts often supply electricity straight to the grid rather than feed it directly to corporate customers' plants and offices. Companies get the benefit of clean energy without cutting themselves off from the security of the grid.
walmart,2017-6,He said Wal-Mart is seeing roughly single-digit percentage savings with its green-power contracts.
walmart,2017-6,"Furniture retailer IKEA is a notable exception to the PPA trend, preferring to own the renewable-energy assets that serve its U.S. business, including rooftop solar systems on most of its buildings and two wind farms in Texas and Illinois. The approach is part of the Swedish company's long-term corporate strategy of owning all of its stores, factories and the land on which they're built."
walmart,2017-6,"Demand from big corporations has benefited a host of wind and solar developers including Pattern Energy , First Solar and NextEra Energy . BNB Renewable Energy Holdings LLC, a privately held New York-based developer, said corporations now make up about half its business."
walmart,2017-6,"""There is a convergence right now where price is low and their sustainability commitments are high,"" said Jos Nicholas, a managing partner with BNB."
walmart,2017-6,"The developers or owners of the projects, meanwhile, get the stability of long-term contracts plus those federal tax breaks. The solar credit is worth up to 30 percent of a project's value. For wind, the most popular tax credit is a maximum of 2.4 cents per kilowatt-hour of electricity produced for a decade."
walmart,2017-6,"Since 2014, nearly 100 large global companies have committed to transitioning to 100% renewables through a partnership with The Climate Group, a nonprofit that's working to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Roughly two corporations a month are joining that effort, according to Amy Davidsen, the organization's executive director for North America."
walmart,2017-6,"In addition to GM, U.S. companies that have made the commitment include Johnson & Johnson , Procter & Gamble Co and Nike Inc ."
walmart,2017-6,"Still, many big firms remain on the sidelines because they lack an overall corporate sustainability mandate, view renewables as having unattractive returns or because the contracts are too long, according to a 2016 PricewaterhouseCoopers survey."
walmart,2017-6,"Many small- and medium-sized businesses have a hard time benefiting too. They don't consume enough energy to negotiate large, lowest-cost PPAs like the big guys. Smaller projects, such as installing rooftop solar panels, tend to depend heavily on state and local incentives that come and go."
walmart,2017-6,The 2020 expiration of the federal tax incentives is another concern. But industry watchers expect U.S. companies will continue their ambitious public commitments to boost renewable energy use even if those breaks aren't renewed.
walmart,2017-6,"General Mills, for instance, sees climate change as a major threat to the agricultural supply chain behind products such as Cheerios cereal and Yoplait yogurt. The company has a goal of reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 28 percent by 2025."
walmart,2017-6,"""If the front end of that business model breaks down -- Mother Nature -- we're in a world of hurt,"" the company's chief sustainability officer, Jerry Lynch, said."

walmart,2017-6,"June 19 (Reuters) - Whole Foods Market Inc shares added to their gains on Monday after Amazon.com Inc announced plans last week to buy the upscale grocer, with investors betting that rivals could step in to create a bidding war."
walmart,2017-6,Amazon shares also rose as Wall Street analysts lauded the proposed $42-per-share deal and bet that the company would prevail in any bidding battle. [nL3N1JD3Z4]
walmart,2017-6,Whole Foods shares rose 1.3 percent on Monday to close at $43.22 - adding to Friday's 29 percent rise and reflecting hopes the company might fetch a higher price. Amazon shares ended up 0.8 percent at $995.17.
walmart,2017-6,"""We thought Amazon was thrifty in its offer,"" said Charles Kantor, managing director at Neuberger Berman Investment Advisers LLC, which owns around 2.7 percent of Whole Foods shares and had pressured the company to take steps to improve its stock price."
walmart,2017-6,Kantor noted that Amazon's market cap gain roughly equaled the amount the company is paying for Whole Foods.
walmart,2017-6,"""I think there's the argument that Amazon acquired Whole Foods for free,"" he said. ""The reaction of shareholders suggests that Amazon has left themselves lots of room to pay more for this strategic asset."""
walmart,2017-6,"""Every grocery store out there now is having a conversation about how much they can afford to spend to keep Amazon out of the space,"" said Brian Culpepper, a portfolio manager at James Advantage funds."
walmart,2017-6,"Culpepper, who owns Kroger Co shares, said Kroger is the company that would be most likely improve Whole Foods' efficiency, but that it would have difficulty matching Amazon's cash offer."
walmart,2017-6,"""Kroger would have to pay in stock, and their stock has been hurting,"" giving them less leverage to get into a protracted bidding war with Amazon, Culpepper said."
walmart,2017-6,"Barclays analyst Karen Short raised her Whole Foods price target to $48 from $38 and upgraded the stock to overweight from equal-weight, citing the possibility of counterbids."
walmart,2017-6,"""Many will do anything to either make this acquisition more costly for Amazon, or prevent the asset from landing in Amazon's lap,"" Short wrote in a note to clients."
walmart,2017-6,"A $48-a-share price tag would be more than reasonable for a fellow retailer that could eliminate overhead at Whole Foods, Short said, while adding that very few companies could outbid Amazon."
walmart,2017-6,"Amazon's offer of $13.7 billion, representing a multiple of 10 times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, could possibly be raised to 11 or 12 times, according to Kevin Dreyer, co-chief investment officer at Gabelli Funds, which holds Whole Foods shares."
walmart,2017-6,"""Fourteen billion is a big number but it's not a number where there's no other buyer,"" said Dreyer. ""Others could certainly look at this and sharpen their pencils."""
walmart,2017-6,"Wal-Mart Stores Inc could have sufficiently deep pockets to make a counter bid and other grocery rivals such as Kroger or Albertsons Cos Inc would have the motivation, he said."
walmart,2017-6,"Any of the big grocery chains that bid on Whole Foods would likely win antitrust approval to buy the premium grocery chain, according to three antitrust experts."
walmart,2017-6,"Any buyer of Whole Foods would likely argue that it was not in the same market, said Alden Abbott, an antitrust expert with the Heritage Foundation."
walmart,2017-6,"""Even if they did compete ... you'd have to look at the presence of (other grocery chains),"" said Abbott, who argued that many Whole Foods stores are in close proximity to other grocery stores, which means antitrust enforcers might be satisfied there was adequate competition."

walmart,2017-6,{{20170619T133041.669+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-Amazon's one-click deal keeps Wal-Mart at bay(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are her own.)
walmart,2017-6,"DALLAS, June 19 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Wal-Mart's market capitalization dropped 5 percent, losing $11 billion, after Amazon.com unveiled its $14 billion deal to buy Whole Foods Market on Friday. Meanwhile, Whole Foods shares closed on Friday nearly 2 percent above the agreed price, implying some investors think a rival bid could emerge. But even for Wal-Mart, that would be a stretch."
walmart,2017-6,"Whole Foods' filing suggests it wasn't shopped around. Amazon only became serious in late April when the company's team signed confidentiality agreements. That means some shareholders, notably Jana Partners, an activist owner of an 8 percent stake, could be receptive to a higher price. A grocery-industry buyer like Wal-Mart could also cut costs, helping to justify paying more than the 27 percent premium Amazon is offering."
walmart,2017-6,"Then there's the defensive value. If investors were right to sell off grocery-chain stocks across the board in the United States and Europe on news of Amazon's plunge into the sector, it could be worth keeping Jeff Bezos' online giant away from Whole Foods."
walmart,2017-6,"Wal-Mart is one of few candidates. Its $230 billion market value dwarfs listed U.S. grocers, including Target , Kroger and Sprouts Farmers Market , as well as private Albertsons. Its balance-sheet cash could in theory finance nearly half the acquisition and, with total debt currently at about 1.5 times EBITDA, it could borrow more."
walmart,2017-6,"Adding an upscale brand might help Wal-Mart attract new customers and boost its grocery business. Yet that would be a change of direction. Its recent strategy has been to improve its e-commerce offering, including with Friday's deal to buy men's clothing e-tailer Bonobos."
walmart,2017-6,"Financially, too, topping Bezos' offer would be tough. Assume Wal-Mart is able to cut Whole Foods' operating costs by a generous 3 percent, or about $450 million a year. Taxed at 35 percent and capitalized on a multiple of 10, those savings are worth just under $3 billion today, roughly the same as Amazon's premium. Wal-Mart would be irrational to pay more, especially since it would also have to cover a $400 million break fee."
walmart,2017-6,"This math applies to any interloper. Likewise, even hefty cost cuts won't make Whole Foods' EBITDA expand enough for the after-tax return on an acquisition to exceed the 8.6 percent weighted-average cost of capital Morningstar attaches to the company. Whatever clicks-to-bricks magic Bezos has in mind, his advisers have done the trick of making his deal hard to beat."
walmart,2017-6,"- Amazon.com said on June 16 it had agreed to buy Whole Foods Market for about $13.7 billion, extending its push into the grocery business with its biggest acquisition ever."
walmart,2017-6,"- Under the terms of the deal, Amazon will pay $42 a share in cash, a premium of about 27 percent to where Whole Foods shares closed on June 15."
walmart,2017-6,- The companies expect the transaction to close in the second half of 2017 after securing approval from regulators and Whole Foods shareholders. Whole Foods co-founder John Mackey will stay on as chief executive.
walmart,2017-6,"- Whole Foods has been under pressure from hedge fund Jana Partners, which owns an 8 percent stake, to sell itself."
walmart,2017-6,"- On June 16, Whole Foods shares closed at $42.68, above the agreed sale price. Under the terms of the agreement, Whole Foods is not allowed to solicit alternative offers, and if the company ends up walking away it must pay Amazon a termination fee of $400 million."

walmart,2017-6,"June 16 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc said on Friday it would buy Whole Foods Market Inc for $13.7 billion, in an embrace of brick-and-mortar stores that could turn the high-end grocer into a mass-market merchant and upend the already struggling U.S. retail industry."
walmart,2017-6,"Amazon used aggressive pricing to become an e-commerce retail juggernaut and has recently been experimenting with brick-and-mortar outlets. It will take over a natural and organic grocer pioneer with 456 stores, a mecca for young, high-end shoppers, that has been struggling to rein in prices and integrate technology."
walmart,2017-6,"The deal represents a dramatic turn in strategy for Amazon, which has offered food delivery through its Fresh service for a decade but has not made a major dent in the $700 billion grocery market."
walmart,2017-6,"Shares of dozens of supermarkets, food producers, payment processors and shopping malls collectively lost at least $35 billion in U.S. market value on Friday as the news reverberated across financial markets. [nL1N1JD13L]"

walmart,2017-6,"Amazon's shares rose 2.4 percent to $987.71, adding $11 billion to its market capitalization, which in one sense makes the acquisition nearly free for Amazon shareholders."
walmart,2017-6,"""Supermarkets will now have to contend with not only competition with each other and non-traditional grocers like Wal-Mart Stores Inc and Target Corp , but with a retailer like Amazon which has the financial capacity to price aggressively,"" said Mickey Chadha, vice president and senior credit officer at Moody's Investors Service."
walmart,2017-6,"Amazon agreed to pay $42 per share in cash for Whole Foods, a 27 percent premium on the Austin, Texas-based grocer's closing share price on Thursday."
walmart,2017-6,"But in a sign that investors believe a rival bid is likely, Whole Foods shares rose above the offer price to close at $42.68."
walmart,2017-6,"A former grocery expert at Amazon predicted that the chain, nicknamed ""Whole Paycheck"", would add a selection of discounted food and build out non-grocery areas within stores, particularly for pharmacy and Amazon devices."
walmart,2017-6,"""There's no value in Amazon keeping the status quo at Whole Foods. Whole Foods was losing market share to Kroger,"" said Brittain Ladd, who until earlier this year was a senior manager working to roll out AmazonFresh globally."
walmart,2017-6,"""It's pharmacy. It's having the ability to put stores that are similar to Apple stores inside Whole Foods,"" he said."
walmart,2017-6,"Amazon has been looking at shop layouts that could allow traditional in-store purchase, online ordering with on-site pickup, and home delivery, using store warehouse space as a distribution point, Ladd said."
walmart,2017-6,"Despite Amazon's reputation for harnessing technology, a prototype store inside its corporate office in Seattle, called Amazon Go, which uses sensors and tech-savvy cameras to detect shoppers' selections and then charge their Amazon accounts, has rolled out more slowly than planned, a person familiar with the matter said."
walmart,2017-6,"And while some analysts expect Amazon to bring vast buying power to Whole Foods, Amazon's heft in the food market is far smaller than in other areas, and high demand for organic products gives farmers unusual bargaining power."
walmart,2017-6,Amazon spokesman Drew Herdener said plans do not include reducing jobs as the result of the deal and that the company does not plan to automate Whole Foods cashiers jobs with Amazon Go technology.
walmart,2017-6,"The deal unfolded after Jeff Bezos, Amazon's chief executive officer, approached Whole Foods CEO John Mackey about a month ago and received an eager response from Mackey, two people familiar with the matter said."
walmart,2017-6,"The grocer will continue to operate stores under the Whole Foods Market brand, and Mackey will remain CEO, the companies said."
walmart,2017-6,Whole Foods has posted seven straight quarterly sales declines at established stores and recently overhauled its board of directors in the face of pressure from activist hedge fund Jana Partners LLC.
walmart,2017-6,"Jana, which disclosed an 8.3 percent stake in Whole Foods in April and is the company's second biggest shareholder, stands to make roughly $300 million from the sale to Amazon. [nL1N1JD1LW]"
walmart,2017-6,"The deal is for $13.4 billion in cash and the remainder in debt. The acquisition price implies a trailing 12-month price-to-earnings multiple for Whole Foods of 31 times, versus a 14.4 average for the S&P 500 Food Retail index <.SPLRCRETF>."
walmart,2017-6,Amazon and Whole Foods expect to close the deal during the second half of 2017.
walmart,2017-6,"Amazon, started in Seattle in 1994 by Bezos, a former hedge fund manager, has grown into the world's biggest diversified online retailer, with a market capitalization of nearly $500 billion. It has expanded from a book seller into a merchant of nearly all consumer products, as well as producing videos."
walmart,2017-6,Both Amazon and Whole Foods cater to younger consumers including millennials as well as the affluent.

walmart,2017-6,{{20170616T152104.633+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-Amazon buys its way to the top of the food chain(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.)
walmart,2017-6,"NEW YORK, June 16 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Amazon.com just bought its way to the top of the food chain. The e-commerce titan is going whole hog for U.S. groceries with the $13.7 billion acquisition of upscale chain Whole Foods Market . Amazon's comfort with low margins and savvy in logistics make it so fearsome a rival that investors in the sector ran for cover."
walmart,2017-6,"A relentless focus on the long-run opportunity of selling practically everything to everyone has been the hallmark of Amazon founder and Chief Executive Jeff Bezos. For most of its history, the nearly half-trillion-dollar company has been run at break-even with its prodigious cash flow plowed back into price reductions, expansion into new areas and investment to ensure faster delivery."
walmart,2017-6,"Groceries are therefore a natural target. Americans spend about $800 billion a year on their Cheerios, kale and ground beef, according to Cowen research. It's also a business whose profitability is notoriously low. Whole Foods, for example, generated a net margin of 3.2 percent last year. That's astronomical by Amazon's standards. Its own margin was 1.7 percent."
walmart,2017-6,"The deal nevertheless marks some seismic shifts. For one thing, it is Amazon's biggest acquisition ever by a considerable sum. While Bezos has been tinkering with rolling out bookshops, Whole Foods vastly increases Amazon's bricks-and-mortar presence with 460 stores. And the deal expands Amazon's workforce by about a quarter."
walmart,2017-6,"In exchange for this strategic deviation, Amazon gets access to a slew of wealthy customers and information about their food-buying habits. Bezos could easily extend the benefits of his company's popular Prime membership into goods and services at grocery stores, thus giving them additional reason to buy even more from Amazon. It also has been trying to shrink shipping costs. Amazon lost $7 billion subsidizing deliveries last year. Having customers pick up their purchases in Whole Foods stores might help."
walmart,2017-6,"- Amazon.com said on June 16 it would buy Whole Foods Market for about $13.7 billion, extending its push into the grocery business with its biggest acquisition ever."
walmart,2017-6,"- Under terms of the deal, Amazon will pay $42 a share, a premium of about 27 percent to where Whole Foods shares closed on June 15."
walmart,2017-6,- The companies expect the transaction to close in the second half of 2017 after securing approval from regulators and Whole Foods shareholders. Whole Foods co-founder John Mackey will stay on as chief executive.
walmart,2017-6,"- Whole Foods has been under pressure from hedge fund Jana Partners, which owns an 8 percent stake, to sell itself."

walmart,2017-6,{{20170615T200549.450+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-Kroger woes augur deep discounts at U.S. grocers (The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.)
walmart,2017-6,"NEW YORK, June 15 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Price cuts in the grocery business are producing even bigger declines in the stock market. A first-quarter earnings fall and reduction in full-year guidance prompted an 18 percent drop in Kroger's share price Thursday, wiping some $5 billion off the company's market value. It's just the latest victim of a competitive war that's sure to intensify as Wal-Mart undercuts rivals and German discounters Aldi and Lidl expand."
walmart,2017-6,The second-largest U.S. supermarket chain is being whipsawed by changes in the industry. Deflating prices of many foods and increased competition are putting pressure on margins while Kroger is raising wages to improve shoppers' in-store experience and investing to expand its online grocery service.
walmart,2017-6,"Those factors combined to slash earnings by more than half in the first quarter, and prompted the company to lower its forecast for the full year. With Wal-Mart testing a new wave of discounts and Chief Executive Rodney McMullen pledging to ""not lose on price,"" that trend is unlikely to reverse any time soon."
walmart,2017-6,"Aldi is poised to spend $3.4 billion on an expansion that stands to make it the third-biggest grocer by store count in the United States. It and rival Lidl, which cut a ribbon on its first U.S. store on Thursday, have developed a winning formula in Europe with bare-bones formats and cheap private-label products. Consultancy Bain & Co predicts deep discounters will grow 8 to 10 percent annually through 2020, five times the rate of traditional grocers."
walmart,2017-6,"The intensifying competition is good news for shoppers. As measured by the food-at-home component of the U.S. consumer price index, grocery-store prices were 1.5 percent lower in the first quarter than the same period in 2016. Investors, on the other hand, can be forgiven for feeling deflated. Consumers' gain is their pain."
walmart,2017-6,"- Supermarket operator Kroger on June 15 reported net earnings attributable to shareholders of $303 million, or 32 cents a share, in the first quarter of 2017, down from $696 million, or 71 cents a share, in the same period a year earlier. The company cut its forecast for adjusted earnings in 2017 to a range of $2 to $2.05 a share, down from $2.21 to $2.25 previously."
walmart,2017-6,"- The company cited competitive pressures in the industry and higher labor costs for the earnings decline. Vowing the company ""will not lose on price,"" Chairman and Chief Executive Rodney McMullen said: ""We are driving our strategy of lowering costs to reinvest in ways that provide the right value to our customers."""
walmart,2017-6,- The company's shares were down 18 percent at $24.83 in midday trading.
walmart,2017-6,"- German grocery chain Aldi announced on June 12 it would invest $3.4 billion to expand its U.S. store base to 2,500 by 2022 from 1,600 today. The expansion would make Aldi the third-largest U.S. grocery chain by number of stores, behind Wal-Mart and Kroger. German rival Lidl opened the first of a planned 100 U.S. stores on June 15."
walmart,2017-6,"- Wal-Mart Stores is testing lower prices in 11 U.S. states and pushing vendors to undercut rivals by 15 percent, according to Reuters."

walmart,2017-6,"June 15 (Reuters) - Dollar Tree Inc's plan to more than quadruple its store count in Canada, as it fights rising competition and slowing sales growth back home, is fraught with risks and will pit it against a formidable rival - market leader Dollarama."
walmart,2017-6,"Chesapeake, Virginia-based Dollar Tree, which operates 226 stores in Canada, said in March it planned to open 1,000 stores in Canada over time. [nFWN1GE0XR]"
walmart,2017-6,"The company is the leading dollar-store operator in the United States, having bought larger rival Family Dollar in 2015. But it is facing growing competition from big-box rival Wal-Mart Stores Inc and upstarts such as Aldi, which have aggressively cut prices and now sell products such as eggs and milk at near dollar-store prices."
walmart,2017-6,"Revenue growth at Dollar Tree has stagnated in the past three quarters since incorporating Family Dollar in its results, with growth ranging from 1 percent to 5 percent. Dollar Tree has nearly 14,500 stores in the United States."
walmart,2017-6,"In contrast, sales at Dollarama Inc , which owns 1,095 stores in Canada - from Halifax in the east to Vancouver in the west - have grown at a clip of at least 10 percent in the same period. It plans to grow to 1,700 stores over the next decade."
walmart,2017-6,"Dollarama has been in business for a quarter of a century, runs an efficient supply chain and its stores have attractive layouts and an established customer base, analysts said."
walmart,2017-6,"""Dollarama operates a unique position in the market, largely thanks to geographic reach, the fact that it moved away from C$1 pricing several years ago, and the fact that it is a well-run organization,"" said Amanda Bourlier, senior research analyst at Euromonitor International."
walmart,2017-6,"Dollarama had an 18 percent share of the $10.47 billion discount retail market in Canada last year. Dollar Tree, which had a 28.1 percent share of the $57.92 billion U.S. market, had a 2.2 percent market share in Canada, according to Euromonitor."
walmart,2017-6,Dollar Tree has said revenue from stores in Canada is not material.
walmart,2017-6,"Dollarama is not the only hurdle Dollar Tree will face in Canada. Operating in the country, for instance, is a challenge in itself."
walmart,2017-6,"The sparsely populated country has a handful of big cities and establishing a supply chain that works seamlessly over large distances is costly, as Target Corp found out when it set up shop in Canada."
walmart,2017-6,The U.S. retailer exited the market in 2015 after less than two years of operation and incurred a $5.4 billion charge.
walmart,2017-6,"""It looks like an enormous opportunity, but there's a much lower ceiling for growth in Canada,"" said Neil Saunders, managing director of retail at GlobalData."
walmart,2017-6,"For dollar stores, which operate on razor-thin margins, the risks are greater than for other retailers."
walmart,2017-6,"Dollar Tree, however, is confident that its plan will work because it has successfully dealt with similar challenges before."
walmart,2017-6,"""I don't know that they become bigger factors or challenges by adding more stores. We've done that in the U.S. and we can do that in Canada as well,"" Dollar Tree spokesman Randy Guiler told Reuters."
walmart,2017-6,Analysts said Dollar Tree could make it work by sticking to its lower price points and targeting a slightly different demographic.
walmart,2017-6,"The company, which entered Canada in 2010 through its acquisition of Dollar Giant's 86 stores, sells goods for C$1.25 or less. Dollarama sells products for less than C$4.00."
walmart,2017-6,"Dollar Tree might be attractive to extremely price-sensitive customers who want to buy everything for around $1, a market Dollarama is no longer focusing on, said Antony Karabus, CEO of retail consultancy firm HRC Retail Advisory. ($1 = 1.3446 Canadian dollars)"

walmart,2017-6,"FAYETTEVILLE, Ark., June 2 (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc executives on Friday reassured workers they remained integral to the company's success as they highlighted investments in online sales and other technology to compete with rivals like Amazon.com Inc ."
walmart,2017-6,Wal-Mart is successfully using e-commerce to boost sales but does not want to alienate workers who have helped drive gains with improved customer service and higher morale following a rise in base pay to $10 an hour.
walmart,2017-6,"""We will compete with technology, but win with people,"" Chief Executive Doug McMillon said at Wal-Mart's annual shareholder meeting where all the company's board member nominations were approved. ""We will be people-led and tech-empowered."""
walmart,2017-6,The nod to store employees and the retail workforce was a departure from past years when the company focused shareholder presentations on the technology it was adopting to close the online gap with Amazon and beat other competitors.
walmart,2017-6,"The shift followed complaints by labor groups that Wal-Mart had to do more for workers, despite the company's $2.7 billion investment in employee training and wages in 2015 and the 2016 wage increase to $10."
walmart,2017-6,McMillon's comments capped a three-day media event during which the company announced initiatives like a test program that allows store workers to deliver packages ordered on the retailer's website and the use of blockchain technology to ensure safety in its food supply chain.
walmart,2017-6,"Wal-Mart's investments in technology helped deliver a 63 percent rise in first quarter online sales, up from 29 percent growth in the fourth quarter and 20 percent in the third quarter. Its results have also outshined rivals like Target Corp , department-store chains and apparel retailers. [nL2N1IK0DA]"

walmart,2017-6,"Wal-Mart's shareholders approved all 11 company-recommended board members and voted in-line with company wishes. None of the four shareholder proposals put forward were approved. One from Making Change at Wal-Mart, part of the United Food and Commercial Workers Union, called for an independent chairman to act in the interests of Wal-Mart's hourly workers."
walmart,2017-6,"""How can any Wal-Mart associate build a better life when they have been with the company for five years or more and they make $9 or $10 an hour,"" said Amy Ritter from the labor group, who presented the proposal."
