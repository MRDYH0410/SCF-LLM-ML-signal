tesla,2017-2,{{20170228T030940.521+0000}}CORRECTED-UPDATE 3-SpaceX to send first paying tourists around moon next year(Corrects SpaceX backlog to $10 billion from $70 billion in paragraph 20)
tesla,2017-2,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla., Feb 27 (Reuters) - SpaceX plans to launch two paying passengers on a tourist trip around the moon next year using a spaceship under development for NASA astronauts and a heavy-lift rocket yet to be flown, the launch company announced on Monday."
tesla,2017-2,"The launch of the first privately funded tourist flight beyond the orbit of the International Space Station is tentatively targeted for late 2018, Space Exploration Technologies Chief Executive Elon Musk told reporters on a conference call."
tesla,2017-2,"Musk declined to identify the customers or say how much they would pay to fly on the weeklong mission, except to say that it is ""nobody from Hollywood."""
tesla,2017-2,"He also said the two prospective space tourists, who know each other, have put down a ""substantial"" deposit and would undergo ""extensive training before going on the mission."""
tesla,2017-2,"""I think there's a market for one or two of these per year,"" he said, estimating that space tourist fares charged by SpaceX could eventually contribute 10 to 20 percent of the company's revenue."
tesla,2017-2,"Plans call for SpaceX's two-person lunar venture to fly some 300,000 to 400,000 miles (480,000 to 640,000 km) from Earth past the moon before Earth's gravity pulls the spacecraft back into the atmosphere for a parachute landing."
tesla,2017-2,That trajectory would be similar to NASA's 1968 Apollo 8 mission beyond the moon and back.
tesla,2017-2,"Musk also said that if NASA decides it wants to be first in line for a lunar flyby mission, the U.S. space agency would take priority."
tesla,2017-2,"At the behest of the Trump administration, NASA is conducting a study to assess safety risks, costs and potential benefits of letting astronauts fly on the debut test flight of its heavy-lift Space Launch System rocket and Orion capsule."
tesla,2017-2,That mission is currently planned to be uncrewed and scheduled to launch in late 2018.
tesla,2017-2,Musk said the privately funded moon expedition would take place after his California-based company begins flying crew to the International Space Station for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
tesla,2017-2,NASA is hoping those crew-ferrying flights begin by late 2018.
tesla,2017-2,"SpaceX's own Falcon Heavy rocket, which Musk wants to use for the lunar tourist mission, is scheduled to make a debut test flight later this year."
tesla,2017-2,"Musk, also CEO of electric carmaker Tesla , said missions around the moon could provide practice for eventual human flights to Mars, the long-term goal of SpaceX."
tesla,2017-2,"Except for needed communications upgrades, the Dragon spaceship in development for NASA astronauts is well suited for lunar flyby missions, Musk added."
tesla,2017-2,The launch would require licensing by the Federal Aviation Administration.
tesla,2017-2,SpaceX joins a growing list of companies developing commercial passenger spaceflight services.
tesla,2017-2,"Virgin Galactic, an offshoot of Richard Branson's London-based Virgin Group, is testing a six-passenger, two-pilot spaceship to carry paying customers about 62 miles (100 km) above Earth, high enough to experience brief microgravity and see Earth's curvature against the blackness of space."
tesla,2017-2,"SpaceX has a $10 billion backlog of about 70 missions for NASA and commercial customers. The firm's backers include Alphabet's Google Inc and Fidelity Investments, which together have contributed $1 billion to Musk's firm."

tesla,2017-2,"SAN FRANCISCO, Feb 27 (Reuters) - Shares of Tesla dropped on Monday after a downgrade by Goldman Sachs, bringing the electric carmaker's decline to 11 percent since its quarterly report last week stoked worries about how much cash it is using to launch its Model 3 sedan."
tesla,2017-2,"Concerns that Tesla's Model 3 production this year might be delayed, as well as expectations the company will sell stock to raise $1.7 billion, led Goldman Sachs analyst David Tamberrino to downgrade Tesla to ""sell"" from ""neutral""."
tesla,2017-2,"That helped push the stock down 4.83 percent to $244.52 in morning trade on Monday. If it closes at that level, it will have been the worst three-day performance for the shares since June last year."
tesla,2017-2,"Even with the recent drop, Tesla has surged more than 30 percent since early December and is up 14 percent in 2017."
tesla,2017-2,"Tesla has traded between $180 and $280 in recent years, and after hitting 2015 highs earlier this month, it may be headed toward the bottom of that range, Tamberrino wrote in a note to clients."

tesla,2017-2,"""You don't want to go to the most difficult parts of London when you start. The system has to be tested,"" he said of the east of the capital where the trials are taking place near the ExCeL exhibition centre and London City Airport."

tesla,2017-2,"WASHINGTON, Feb 26 (Reuters) - U.S. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao said on Sunday she was reviewing self-driving vehicle guidance issued by the Obama administration and urged companies to explain the benefits of automated vehicles to a skeptical public."
tesla,2017-2,"The guidelines, which were issued in September, call on automakers to voluntarily submit details of self-driving vehicle systems to regulators in a 15-point ""safety assessment"" and urge states to defer to the federal government on most vehicle regulations."
tesla,2017-2,"Automakers have raised numerous concerns about the guidance, including that it requires them to turn over significant data, could delay testing by months and lead to states making the voluntary guidelines mandatory."
tesla,2017-2,"In November, major automakers urged the then-incoming Trump administration to re-evaluate the guidelines and some have called for significant changes. Automakers called on Congress earlier this month to make legislative changes to speed self-driving cars to U.S. roads."
tesla,2017-2,"Chao, in her first major public remarks since taking office last month, told the National Governors Association: ""This administration is evaluating this guidance and will consult with you and other stakeholders as we update it and amend it, to ensure that it strikes the right balance."""
tesla,2017-2,"In 2015, 35,092 people died in U.S. traffic crashes, up 7 percent and the highest full-year increase since 1966. In the first nine months of 2016, fatalities were up 8 percent."
tesla,2017-2,"Chao, noting research that 94 percent of traffic crashes were due to human error, said: ""There's a lot at stake in getting this technology right."""
tesla,2017-2,"She said the Trump administration wanted to ensure it ""is a catalyst for safe, efficient technologies, not an impediment. In particular, I want to challenge Silicon Valley, Detroit, and all other auto industry hubs to step up and help educate a skeptical public about the benefits of automated technology."""
tesla,2017-2,"Companies including Alphabet Inc's self-driving car Waymo unit , General Motors Co , Ford Motor Co , Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL], Tesla Inc and other are aggressively pursuing automated vehicle technologies."
tesla,2017-2,"Chao said she was ""very concerned"" about the potential impact of automated vehicles on employment. There are 3.5 million U.S. truck drivers alone and millions of others employed in driving-related occupations."
tesla,2017-2,"She also said she would seek input from states as regulators develops rules on drones. ""We will ask for your input as the (Federal Aviation Administration) develops standards and regulations to ensure that drones can be safely integrated into our country's airspace,"" she said."

tesla,2017-2,"SAN FRANCISCO, Feb 23 (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc's Waymo self-driving car unit sued Uber Technologies [UBER.UL] and its autonomous trucking subsidiary Otto on Thursday over allegations of theft of its confidential and proprietary sensor technology."
tesla,2017-2,"Waymo accused Uber and Otto, acquired by the ride services company in August, with stealing confidential information on Waymo's Lidar sensor technology to help speed its own efforts in autonomous technology."
tesla,2017-2,"""Uber's LiDAR technology is actually Waymo's LiDAR technology,"" said Waymo's complaint in the Northern District of California."
tesla,2017-2,"Uber said it took ""the allegations made against Otto and Uber employees seriously and we will review this matter carefully."""
tesla,2017-2,"Lidar, which uses light pulses reflected off objects to gauge their position on or near the road, is a crucial component of autonomous driving systems. Previous systems have been prohibitively expensive and Waymo sought to design one over 90 percent cheaper, making its Lidar technology among the company's ""most valuable assets,"" Waymo said."
tesla,2017-2,Waymo is seeking an unspecified amount of damages and a court order preventing Uber from using its proprietary information.
tesla,2017-2,"Otto launched with much fanfare in May, due in part to the high profile of one of its co-founders, Anthony Levandowski, who had been an executive on Google's self-driving project. Uber acquired the company in August for what Waymo said in the lawsuit was $680 million."
tesla,2017-2,"Waymo said that before Levandowski's resignation in January 2016 from Google, whose self-driving unit was renamed Waymo in December, he downloaded over 14,000 confidential files, including Lidar circuit board designs, thereby allowing Uber and Otto to fast-track its self-driving technology."
tesla,2017-2,"Waymo accused Levandowski of attempting to ""erase any forensic fingerprints"" via a reformat of his laptop."
tesla,2017-2,"""While Waymo developed its custom LiDAR systems with sustained effort over many years, defendants leveraged stolen information to shortcut the process and purportedly build a comparable LiDAR system in only nine months,"" the complaint said."
tesla,2017-2,"Last month, Tesla Inc electric car company sued the former head of its Autopilot system. It said he tried to recruit Tesla engineers for his new venture with the former head of Google's self-driving program while still working there, and said he stole proprietary data belonging to Tesla. [nL1N1FG292]"
tesla,2017-2,"Waymo's lawsuit said it learned of this use of trade secrets and patent infringement after it was inadvertently copied on an email from a component vendor that included a design of Uber's Lidar circuit board, which bore a ""striking resemblance"" to Waymo's design."
tesla,2017-2,Waymo noted that Google devoted over seven years to self-driving cars and said Uber's forays into the technology through a partnership with Carnegie Mellon University had stalled by early 2016.

tesla,2017-2,"{{20170223T205757.501+0000}}UPDATE 1-Tesla's 'close to the edge' cash foretells capital raise(Adds background, details throughout)"
tesla,2017-2,"SAN FRANCISCO, Feb 23 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc Chief Elon Musk has taken big risks repeatedly since going public in 2010, but investors were spooked on Thursday after he said the electric car company could get ""close to the edge"" as it burns cash ahead of its crucial Model 3 launch."
tesla,2017-2,"Facing yet another cash crunch, Tesla will likely be forced to head to Wall Street for more capital, analysts said. Shares tumbled 5.8 percent on Thursday, their biggest intraday percentage fall in eight months."
tesla,2017-2,"Musk told investors after the company released its fourth-quarter results on Wednesday that the upcoming Model 3 sedan, the $35,000 mass-market vehicle on which the company's future profitability hinges, requires no additional outside funding as it readies for production this year."
tesla,2017-2,"""But we get very close to the edge,"" Musk said. ""So we're considering a number of options but I think it probably makes sense to raise capital to reduce risk."""
tesla,2017-2,"Tesla had $3.39 billion in cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2016, but most of that comes from a May stock offering, cash from its SolarCity acquisition and nearly $1 billion in draws on its credit facilities."
tesla,2017-2,The company spent $448 million in cash on operating activities in the fourth quarter.
tesla,2017-2,"Tesla's warning of an expected $2 billion to $2.5 billion in capital expenditures in the first half of 2017 for the Model 3 leaves potentially less than a $1 billion cushion for Tesla, at a time of ""high levels of execution risk,"" wrote Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas."
tesla,2017-2,Analysts estimated the company will seek $1 billion to $2.5 billion in capital in the near term.
tesla,2017-2,"Tesla, which has had negative cash flow since 2014 and has posted a quarterly profit only twice since going public, has repeatedly gone to Wall Street for fresh capital."
tesla,2017-2,"""The automotive business is an extremely capital intensive business and we keep seeing companies who are thinking of getting into it underestimate that,"" said Autotrader senior analyst Michelle Krebs, citing moves by Apple Inc and Alphabet's Google to back off aggressive forays into the sector."
tesla,2017-2,Individual model launches for established car companies do not carry the same hazards as for Tesla because the risk is less concentrated.
tesla,2017-2,"""No single launch is a 'bet the company' launch"" for established automakers, said Michigan-based auto manufacturing consultant Michael Tracy, citing larger capital reserves. ""If you're Tesla, every time you're stepping up to the plate, financially it's extremely risky."""
tesla,2017-2,"Additionally, Musk's need for speed in getting the Model 3 in the hands of approximately 373,000 reservation holders after volume production begins in September means he ""has to ramp up faster than any other automaker would want to do,"" Tracy said."

tesla,2017-2,"NEW YORK, Feb 22 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Tesla fans are shifting into a new cultish gear. Nothing in the electric-car maker's latest results helps explain the 43 percent rise in its share price over the past three months. More than ever, owning Tesla means revering founder and Chief Executive Elon Musk."
tesla,2017-2,"At some $45 billion, Tesla is now worth more than far larger rival Nissan Motor <7201.T>, which sold 5.5 million vehicles last year. and just $6 billion shy of 114-year-old Ford Motor . With little concrete evidence to justify it, Musk's manufacturer trades at an eye-popping 46 times its expected profit in 2019."
tesla,2017-2,"Musk's achievements are undeniably impressive. Tesla produced almost 83,000 Model S and Model X vehicles last year, 64 percent more than a year earlier. Automotive revenue, meanwhile, increased 70 percent, implying the company is tacking on more bells and whistles per vehicle."
tesla,2017-2,"The half-million mark is dependent on the mass-market Model 3, which is slated to go into production in the second half of 2017. With a starting price of $35,000, however, the margins on the sedan will be far lower than its Models S and X. Overall automotive expenses are growing just 3 percentage points less than revenue. That doesn't give Tesla much wiggle room."
tesla,2017-2,"Moreover, the company plans to invest up to $2.5 billion more to get Model 3 production ready. Based on year-end figures, that would take cash on hand below $1 billion and almost certainly mean the company will have to sell more stock. That possibility should be weighing on the stock, not buoying it."
tesla,2017-2,"And none of it factors in the still-mysterious role of SolarCity, the solar-panel installation company chaired by Musk that Tesla bought last year. Questions persist about its funding needs and when it will be able to turn a profit. These are among the many challenges the Tesla fetishists are finding it all too easy to overlook."
tesla,2017-2,"- Tesla on Feb. 22 reported a fourth-quarter loss of $121.3 million, bigger than analysts were expecting, and said its mass-market Model 3 sedan was on track for volume production by September."
tesla,2017-2,"- The company said it expected to deliver between 47,000 and 50,000 Model S and Model X vehicles combined in the first half of 2017. Tesla added that it planned to invest between $2 billion and $2.5 billion in capital expenditures ahead of the start of Model 3 production."

tesla,2017-2,"DRESDEN, Germany, Feb 22 (Reuters) - Volkswagen wants to build more electric cars in eastern Germany and backs a Tesla -style expansion of charging stations in the city of Dresden, evidence of efforts to reshape its business after a diesel emissions scandal."

tesla,2017-2,VW's glass-walled factory in the eastern city of Dresden embodies the company's post-dieselgate transformation better than any of its 120 plants worldwide.
tesla,2017-2,"Before the scandal broke in September 2015, VW's smallest plant built the 12-cylinder Phaeton saloon, the brand's most expensive model which was dropped last March. Now it will instead produce a version of the all-electric e-Golf from April."

tesla,2017-2,"To further its electric ambitions, VW is partnering with Dresden, the state capital of Saxony and home to around 540,000 people."
tesla,2017-2,The city administration wants to multiply the number of public charging stations and improve parking to boost the number of zero-emission cars on its roads.

tesla,2017-2,"Feb 10 (Reuters) - When Samsung Electronics <005930.KS> remotely disabled the last of its flawed Galaxy Note 7 smartphones last month, it further blurred the lines between who ultimately controls your phone, or computer, car or appliance: you, or the companies that make it work?"
tesla,2017-2,"Industry executives and analysts say companies are exerting greater remote control over their devices - changing how and whether they work, removing or adding software and content, or collecting personal data from them - not always with permission or with the user's best interests at heart."
tesla,2017-2,"""(The Samsung case) is exactly an example of how devices ... are no longer objects we own, but rather services we've subscribed to and which can be revoked at a moment's notice,"" said Stefano Zanero, an Italian computer security expert."
tesla,2017-2,"Mahbubul Alam, chief technology officer at Movimento, a car tech firm now owned by Delphi Automotive , says manufacturers have moved on from just selling a device and hoping there's no recall to a world where they are in touch with users through internet-connected devices that they can ""change, modify, adjust"" as they see fit."
tesla,2017-2,"""With power comes responsibility,"" he adds. ""It's a new power that the device manufacturers and telcos have. How they exercise their responsibility is very important."""
tesla,2017-2,"Samsung said it retrieved 96 percent of the more than three million Note 7s it had sold and activated. That left more than 120,000 unreturned phones that were put out of action by over-the-air software updates or by telecom operators barring them from their networks."
tesla,2017-2,"""We assume the majority of unreturned devices are not actually used,"" said a spokesperson for the South Korean firm."
tesla,2017-2,"In another example, HP Inc last year used a software update to prevent unauthorised cartridges being used with some of its printers. After some users complained, HP offered an optional update. HP did not respond to requests for comment."
tesla,2017-2,"In other cases, manufacturers use so-called firmware updates to stop people using their devices in ways they don't want."
tesla,2017-2,"Apple , for example, routinely upgrades the firmware on iPhones to outwit users' attempts to open up the software to unapproved apps and functions - dubbed jailbreaking - said Bunnie Huang, a hardware entrepreneur."
tesla,2017-2,"Bryan Hale of Resin.io, which distributes software updates to connected devices, says gadget makers increasingly realise that connected products are only as good as the software on them. That means they can't afford not to figure out how to update that software. Hacking attacks on appliances like CCTV and webcams highlight the pitfalls of not keeping devices updated."

tesla,2017-2,"DETROIT/SAN FRANCISCO, Feb 8 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc said on Wednesday it will shut down production at its California assembly plant for a week this month to prepare for production of its high-volume Model 3 sedan, moving the company closer to meeting its target to start production in July."
tesla,2017-2,"Tesla said the ""brief, planned"" pause would allow the company to add capacity to the existing paint shop to prepare it for the Model 3, and other general maintenance."
tesla,2017-2,"""This will allow Tesla to begin Model 3 production later this year as planned and enable us to start the ramp towards 500,000 vehicles annually in 2018,"" said a Tesla spokesman."
tesla,2017-2,"He added that the pause was not expected to have a material impact on first-quarter production or delivery figures, as the company had added production days to compensate."
tesla,2017-2,"Separately, sources told Reuters that the luxury electric carmaker planned to begin test-building the Model 3 on Feb. 20."
tesla,2017-2,"Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk last year told investors and more than 370,000 customers who put deposits down for a Model 3 that he intended to start building the cars in July 2017. At the time, many analysts and suppliers said the timeline was too ambitious and would be difficult to achieve, pointing to Tesla's history of missing aggressive production targets. [nL2N18H03X]"
tesla,2017-2,"If Tesla succeeds in starting pilot production of the sedan at its factory in Fremont, California on Feb. 20, as people familiar with the matter told Reuters, the company would be able to share the news with shareholders two days later when it reports fourth-quarter results and better answer any questions about the Model 3 rollout."
tesla,2017-2,"The sources did not know how many of the highly anticipated vehicles Tesla aimed to build in February, but it would likely be a small number to test the assembly system and the quality of vehicle parts."
tesla,2017-2,"""What better way to stoke the fan base and Wall Street than to wheel out pre-production models"" ahead of the earnings announcement, said one person familiar with Tesla's plans who spoke on condition of anonymity."
tesla,2017-2,The Tesla spokesman declined to comment on the company's production schedule.

tesla,2017-2,"NEW YORK, Feb 7 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Silicon Valley is fighting for its life on immigration. Over 100 tech firms, including Google, Facebook and Apple , have joined the legal battle against President Donald Trump's executive order temporarily barring the entry of nationals from seven predominantly Muslim countries. They argue that the restrictions interfere with hiring and business operations. For an industry dependent on immigrants, that truth is self-evident and worth defending."
tesla,2017-2,"They point out in an amicus brief that immigrants play a disproportionate role in establishing companies, setting up over a quarter of all new U.S. businesses between 2006 and 2010. In medicine, technology and engineering, America remains a beacon for ambitious people from around the world. All six of the United States' 2016 Nobel Prize winners in the sciences and economics are immigrants."
tesla,2017-2,"Silicon Valley amplifies both trends. It's a machine that mixes talented people, drive, ideas and capital and churns out companies. Over half of unicorns - private companies worth over $1 billion - were founded by immigrants, according to the National Foundation for American policy. This isn't a new trend. Google co-founder Sergey Brin, eBay's Pierre Omidyar and Yahoo co-founder Jerry Yang were all immigrants."
tesla,2017-2,"The tech industry also depends on immigrants to keep companies humming. It uses well over half of all H1-B visas, which allow companies to bring specialty workers to this country temporarily. Although some companies undoubtedly use the program to import cheap workers and keep wages low, others rely on it to attract much-needed skills."
tesla,2017-2,"This all explains why tech companies have come out hard against the order. Their brief cites the ban's arbitrary and discriminatory nature, but the real motivation is to defend Silicon Valley's business model. The travel ban is also a personal affront to many of the executives who now call the United States home."
tesla,2017-2,"Moreover, the industry worries this is merely the first shot against immigration. After all, the ban could be extended to other countries, Trump has said he is studying changes to the H1-B program, and Republicans in Congress are drafting bills to restrict other forms of legal immigration. For these reasons, Silicon Valley has no choice but to fight."
tesla,2017-2,"- Over 100 companies have signed an amicus brief in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit against President Donald Trump's executive order that barred for 90 days the entry of nationals from seven predominantly Islamic countries. Composed predominantly of technology firms, the list of signatories includes Apple, Google, Facebook, Intel , Salesforce.com and Tesla . Alphabet , Google's parent company, is providing the funding for the challenge, according to Bloomberg."
tesla,2017-2,- A court in San Francisco issued a stay against the order on Feb. 3 after Washington state's attorney general sued to block the travel ban. The Trump administration is challenging this stay in the Court of Appeals. Both sides are due to argue the case in a telephone hearing before a three-judge appellate panel on Tuesday.
tesla,2017-2,"- The brief says the court should deny the administration's appeal because the order unlawfully discriminates on the basis of nationality, is arbitrary and harms the competitiveness of American companies. ""The Order makes it more difficult and expensive for U.S. companies to recruit, hire, and retain some of the world's best employees,"" it states. ""It disrupts ongoing business operations. And it threatens companies' ability to attract talent, business, and investment to the United States."""

tesla,2017-2,"The new Republican president has said the travel measures are to protect the country against the threat of terrorism. Opponents say the 90-day ban is illegal, barring entry for citizens from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen and imposing a 120-day halt to all refugees."

tesla,2017-2,"Opponents of the ban received far more filings in support of their position than the Justice Department. Washington state's challenge was backed by about a dozen friends-of-the-court briefs submitted by at least 17 state attorneys general, more than 100 companies and about a dozen labor and civil rights groups. About a dozen conservative groups supported the government in three such briefs."

tesla,2017-2,"Trump faces an uphill battle in the San Francisco court, which is dominated by liberal-leaning judges. Appeals courts are generally leery of upending the status quo, which in this case is the lower court's suspension of the ban. [nL1N1FQ0M2]"
tesla,2017-2,The appeals court was focusing on the narrow question of whether the district court had grounds to put the order on hold. The bigger legal fight over whether Trump had authority to issue the order will be addressed later in the litigation.
tesla,2017-2,"Curbing entry to the United States as a national security measure was a central premise of Trump's campaign, originally proposed as a temporary ban on all Muslims."
tesla,2017-2,"U.S. presidents have in the past claimed sweeping powers to fight terrorism, but individuals, states and civil rights groups challenging the ban said his administration had offered no evidence it answered a threat."
tesla,2017-2,"Trump, who took office on Jan. 20, has vented his frustration over the legal challenges with a volley of attacks on the judiciary."

tesla,2017-2,"Faraday, an affiliate of Beijing-based Leshi Internet Information and Technology Corp <300104.SZ>, has also pared its planned product portfolio down from seven to two vehicles, according to two sources with direct knowledge of the company's plans."
tesla,2017-2,"Faraday will build a much smaller auto assembly facility than originally planned in North Las Vegas, Nevada, a city official said late on Tuesday."
tesla,2017-2,"North Las Vegas city manager Qiong Liu said Faraday told the city it will build a 650,000-square-foot (60,390-square-meter) facility, beginning later this year, on the site of a plant originally planned to take up 3 million square feet."
tesla,2017-2,"The downsizing follows an acknowledgment last fall by the company's founder, Chinese tech entrepreneur Jia Yueting, that his global operations were overextended. [nL4N1D83OU] Former Faraday executives have said the company struggled with cash flow issues almost from its inception."
tesla,2017-2,"At least a dozen key U.S. executives have departed Faraday in the last nine months, according to the company and several of those executives."

tesla,2017-2,"""We remain committed to the State of Nevada and are continuing our $1 billion investment in the region over the next few years,"" Faraday said in the statement."
tesla,2017-2,"Faraday announced plans in December 2015 to build its first auto factory in Nevada, with an annual capacity of 150,000 and a planned opening in late 2017. Documents submitted to the state showed a planned investment of $1.3 billion."

tesla,2017-2,"A source familiar with the company's thinking said the smaller Nevada plant likely will be set up to build fewer than 10,000 cars a year and may not open until 2019."
tesla,2017-2,"Faraday's change of plans comes after Jia secured a $2.2 billion infusion for his cash-strapped properties, including Faraday's sister company LeEco, from Sunac China Holdings <1918.HK>. [nL4N1F61OA]"
tesla,2017-2,"Two sources said future production of most Faraday vehicles, and companion models for Chinese sister brand LeSee, likely will be centered in China's Zhejiang province, which has agreed to heavily subsidize construction of a new assembly plant with a 450,000 vehicle capacity that could open in 2019."
tesla,2017-2,Faraday stopped work on the Nevada plant last fall. Nevada's state treasurer Dan Schwartz told Reuters a $75 million performance bond required from Faraday before the state issued bonds for infrastructure development at the factory site has not materialized.
tesla,2017-2,"Several Faraday suppliers, including seat supplier Futuris and media provider Mill Group, have sued the company for non-payment, according to court records."
