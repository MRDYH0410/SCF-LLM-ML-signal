Exxon,2017-4,"CALGARY, Alberta, April 28 (Reuters) - As global oil majors pull out of Canada's oil sands, domestic companies are buying up assets and betting technology and economies of scale will enable them to turn a profit despite low crude prices."
Exxon,2017-4,"Global energy majors have sold off more than $22.5 billion worth of Canadian oil sands assets so far this year, concerned about depressed oil prices, high production costs and carbon emissions and limited pipeline access to market. [nL1N1HS2FZ]"
Exxon,2017-4,"Three of Canada's biggest oil and gas companies reported first-quarter earnings and held annual general meetings this week, in which they talked up opportunities in the region despite global firms pulling back. [nL1N1HS1KC]"
Exxon,2017-4,"""We are transforming our company at a pivotal time in the industry and at the beginning of a technological renaissance,"" Cenovus Energy Inc Chief Executive Officer Brian Ferguson told investors on Wednesday. [nL4N1HY3VY]"
Exxon,2017-4,"Cenovus last month announced a C$17.7 billion ($12.98 billion) deal to buy ConocoPhillips assets, doubling the size of the Canadian company. The market baulked at the ambitious acquisition and Cenovus stock lost a fifth of its value, but Ferguson insists the logic behind the deal is sound."
Exxon,2017-4,"He predicts 2016 to 2020 will be period in which rapid technology development in areas including drilling, solvent-assisted bitumen extraction and automation will result in massive cost savings."
Exxon,2017-4,Suncor Energy Inc CEO Steve Williams said the sector consolidation was very positive for the industry and Canada. [nL1N1HZ227]
Exxon,2017-4,"""The oil sands business needs focused operators with strong balance sheets and deep expertise,"" Williams said on an earnings call. ""We expect the transition to more concentrated oil sands leaders to enable regional synergies and technology development that will drive the sector forward and ensure its global competitiveness for decades to come."""
Exxon,2017-4,"Suncor, Canada's largest energy company, bought a majority-share in the Syncrude mining and upgrading project last year."
Exxon,2017-4,"The facility cut production after a fire in March but Suncor's main oil sands plant nearby has helped manage Syncrude's bitumen inventories during the outage, a move that Williams said was a good example of how to leverage expanded infrastructure. [nL2N1H40MG]"
Exxon,2017-4,"Imperial Oil Ltd , majority-owned by Exxon Mobil Corp , has so far held back from buying up any oil sands assets, but CEO Rich Kruger said Canada's vast bitumen reserves were an incredible resource with improving economic and environmental competitiveness."
Exxon,2017-4,"""Our industry has shown we have an ability to make things better and better over time, so don't bet against the Canadian oil sands,"" he said."

Exxon,2017-4,"DALLAS, April 28 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Exxon Mobil and Chevron look to be in a mid-cycle sweet spot. The two oil majors surged to sharp first-quarter upswings on Friday thanks to higher oil prices and better margins. It's a turnaround from early 2016. Now, though, the risks go both ways. Crude prices have lost some stuffing in recent days and, given supply, could slump again. Or, if prices hold up, costs will start rising."
Exxon,2017-4,"In the first quarter last year, West Texas Intermediate crude prices dipped below $30 a barrel. Crude prices have since recovered to around $50. Largely as a result, Exxon's profit for the quarter more than doubled to $4 billion. Chevron swung to earnings of $2.7 billion after posting a loss in the first quarter of 2016."
Exxon,2017-4,"Exxon and Chevron, respectively worth around $350 billion and $200 billion in market capitalization, also sold and bought assets in the quarter. That helped position them as drilling heats up again in the United States. Both companies invested in Permian Basin production: Exxon bought $5.6 billion of assets from the Bass family and Chevron's output increased 33 percent."
Exxon,2017-4,"And if oil prices remain where they are or rise, demand for rigs and other oil services will intensify, pushing up the costs of production. Halliburton said on Monday conditions would soon allow it to hike its prices. Sand and transportation companies will charge more too. Chevron finance chief Patricia Yarrington said that the company was working to keep inflationary pressures in check, specifically in the Permian. Even when you're a global oil powerhouse, though, not everything is within your control."
Exxon,2017-4,"- Rising crude prices helped Exxon Mobil and Chevron easily beat Wall Street's profit expectations on April 28, a sign the oil industry has regained its footing after a two-year price spiral."
Exxon,2017-4,"- Exxon said that first-quarter earnings were $4 billion, more than double the $1.8 billion reported in the first quarter of last year, despite a 4 percent decline in production."
Exxon,2017-4,"- Chevron reported first-quarter earnings of $2.7 billion, compared with a loss of $725 million in the first quarter of 2016. Included in the quarter was a gain of approximately $600 million from the sale of an upstream asset."

Exxon,2017-4,"Exxon Mobil Corp, the world's largest publicly traded oil producer, is expected to report that its quarterly profit doubled due, in part, to cost cuts. Separately, Chevron Corp, the second-largest U.S. oil producer, is expected to have swung to a profit due to cost cuts and help from its refining division."
Exxon,2017-4,"Federal Reserve Board Governor Lael Brainard is scheduled to speak on Fintech at a conference on ""Fintech and the Future of Finance"" at the Kellogg School of Management-Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois. Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia President Patrick Harker will speak on ""How STEM Can Get You Anywhere"" before the X-STEM Symposium in Washington."
Exxon,2017-4,"Tiremaker Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co is expected to report a drop in first-quarter profit, partly as raw material costs remain high. However, revenue is expected to rise.

Exxon,2017-4,"Refiner Phillips 66 is expected to report a much smaller first-quarter profit, hurt by weak margins. Investors will seek details of the company's outlook for inventories of refined products, and margins."
Exxon,2017-4,"Used-auto retailer Carvana Co is expected to debut on the New York Stock Exchange.

Exxon,2017-4,Canadian uranium producer Cameco Corp is expected to report a small quarterly loss as excess supplies continue to weigh on prices. Investors will be keen to hear of any updates on a dispute with utility TEPCO over a canceled contract and Cameco's plans to sell U.S. mines.
Exxon,2017-4,{{20170427T163041.735+0000}}Republican lawmakers urge Trump to weaken Paris climate pact pledgeBy Timothy Gardner
Exxon,2017-4,"WASHINGTON, April 27 (Reuters) - A group of nine Republican lawmakers urged President Donald Trump to keep the United States in the 2015 Paris climate agreement but to reduce its pledge to cut greenhouse gas emissions, as Trump advisors were set on Thursday to discuss whether to leave the pact."
Exxon,2017-4,"Representative Kevin Cramer of oil-producing North Dakota and eight other members of the House of Representatives sent a letter to Trump urging him to use the country's ""seat at the Paris table to defend and promote our commercial interest, including our manufacturing and fossil fuel sectors."""
Exxon,2017-4,"If the United States is to stay in the 2015 agreement, Washington should present a new emissions cutting pledge that ""does no harm to our economy,"" the letter said."
Exxon,2017-4,"Former president Barack Obama, a Democrat, had pledged a 26 percent to 28 percent cut in U.S. greenhouse gas emissions from 2005 levels, by 2025. Most scientists say the world needs to curb greenhouse gas emissions to limit the effects of climate change including rising seas, deadly heatwaves, and severe storms and droughts."
Exxon,2017-4,White House advisors and Trump administration officials were set to meet on Thursday at 1:30 P.M. EDT (1730 GMT) to hold an initial discussion on whether to stay in the pact. [nL1N1HY1Q7]
Exxon,2017-4,Trump made cancelling the Paris agreement part of his 100-day plan for energy policy. He later said he was open to staying if Washington got better terms.
Exxon,2017-4,"Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, the former head of Exxon Mobil and Energy Secretary Rick Perry have said the country should remain in the agreement. Opponents of the pact in the administration include Scott Pruitt, the Environmental Protection Agency administrator and a former attorney general of oil producing Oklahoma, and Trump adviser Steve Bannon."
Exxon,2017-4,Nearly 200 countries struck the Paris agreement to limit climate change by cutting carbon dioxide emissions and making investments in clean energy.
Exxon,2017-4,Many global companies such as BP and Microsoft have urged the United States to stay in the agreement to protect their competitiveness.
Exxon,2017-4,"The lawmakers also said Washington should retain its seat on the Green Climate Fund, which aims to tackle climate change in poor countries, but not make additional transfers to it. The United States pledged $3 billion to the fund in 2014, and Obama gave $1 billion to it, with the last $500 million payment coming in his last days as president."
Exxon,2017-4,{{20170427T132423.916+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-Cox: Proximity to Trump no blessing for stocks(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.)
Exxon,2017-4,"NEW YORK, April 27 (Reuters Breakingviews) - The first 100 days of Donald Trump's presidency are shaping up as either a bust or huge. That's how politics rolls: success or failure is in the eye of the beholder. The stock market offers a bit more precision. One message from the 65-odd trading days since Trump took office decrying ""American carnage"" is that perceived proximity to the Oval Office is no blessing for companies' stock prices."
Exxon,2017-4,"Since the day before Trump's inauguration, the S&P 500 Index has gained 5 percent and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 6 percent. They've added around 15 percent and 17 percent, respectively, since the day before November's election, reflecting broad optimism about the prospects for lower taxes, deregulation and higher economic growth."
Exxon,2017-4,"Any investor who thought Trump's choice of former Exxon boss Rex Tillerson as secretary of state would quickly benefit the company was mistaken. Last week, the U.S. Treasury denied Exxon's request for a waiver of sanctions to allow it to drill for oil in Russia. The $348 billion oil giant has seen its stock slide almost 6 percent since the inauguration, wiping out $20 billion of market wealth."
Exxon,2017-4,"Exxon's share price dip is at least in line with the performance of other large energy companies. By contrast Goldman Sachs , one of the largest providers of talent to the Trump White House, is alone among big Wall Street firms in losing value under the new administration. Shares in the $91 billion investment bank have lost more than 3 percent since Trump put his hand on a bible. Its arch-rival, Morgan Stanley , has seen its shares bounce by nearly 4 percent, with other rivals doing similarly or better."
Exxon,2017-4,"Goldman executives who have made their way to Pennsylvania Avenue include former President Gary Cohn, now Trump's chief economic adviser. Dina Powell left Goldman for the White House and is now deputy national security adviser. Managing Director Jim Donovan is a nominee for deputy Treasury secretary. Two other former Goldmanites have the president's ear, including Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and chief strategist Stephen Bannon."
Exxon,2017-4,"Conversely Twitter , the president's favorite medium for reaching supporters directly, has suffered. Even after getting a bump from better-than-anticipated user growth on Wednesday, the company's shares are 8 percent less valuable than when Trump planted himself in the White House. Revenue fell 8 percent from the previous year, a sign some advertisers may be worried about promoting their brands and products alongside the oft-divisive content that appears on the messaging service."
Exxon,2017-4,"Nordstrom , the upscale retailer, has weathered the first 100 days of Trump with style despite, or perhaps because of, the president's scorn for its decision to stop selling his daughter Ivanka's line of clothing and accessories. Just a couple of weeks into his presidency, the president tweeted that she had been ""treated so unfairly."" The company's stock is up 8 percent since Jan. 19, while those of its rival department store chain Macy's are flat."
Exxon,2017-4,"Not all companies run by folks Trump likes for one reason or another are doing poorly. Blackstone stock has matched the broader market since Inauguration Day as founder and CEO Steven Schwarzman has emerged as chair of the president's economic advisory council. Shares of Twenty-First Century Fox , whose chairman, Rupert Murdoch, speaks to the president weekly, are flat."
Exxon,2017-4,"That said, one of the biggest dogs of the S&P is led by an entrepreneur who proudly hailed Trump ""as a real asset to this country"" just days into his presidency. The comments by Kevin Plank, Under Armour's founder and chief executive, drew a public rebuke from one of the sportswear maker's sponsored athletes, basketball star Stephen Curry. Under Armour shares are 28 percent poorer in the Trump era."
Exxon,2017-4,"It may all be coincidence. Yet it's tempting to speculate that being a corporate member of what Trump critics call the resistance may prove a market virtue. By the same token, proximity to the Oval Office could, at least for some, turn into a liability."

Exxon,2017-4,"HOUSTON, April 26 (Reuters) - A federal judge ruled on Wednesday that ExxonMobil Corp should pay a $19.95 million penalty for pollution from its Baytown, Texas, refining and chemical plant complex between 2005 and 2013."
Exxon,2017-4,"U.S. District Court Judge David Hittner issued the ruling in a citizen lawsuit brought under the U.S. Clean Air Act by two environmental groups, Environment Texas and the Sierra Club."
Exxon,2017-4,"Environment Texas welcomed the decision in the long-running suit, which was first filed in 2010."
Exxon,2017-4,"""We think it might be the largest citizen suit penalty in U.S. history,"" said Luke Metzger, director of Environment Texas. ""It definitely means it pays not to pollute."""
Exxon,2017-4,Exxon said it would consider its legal options and may appeal the ruling.
Exxon,2017-4,"""We disagree with the court's decision and the award of any penalty,"" Exxon spokesman Todd Spitler said in an emailed statement. ""As the court expressed in its decision, ExxonMobil's full compliance history and good faith efforts to comply weigh against assessing any penalty."""
Exxon,2017-4,"The suit was filed under a provision of the Clean Air Act that allows citizens to sue when regulators have failed to stop pollution. The two groups had contended the penalty could run as high as $573 million, but had only sought $41 million."
Exxon,2017-4,"In a 101-page decision, Hittner ruled there had been 16,386 days of violations and 10 million pounds (4.5 million kg) of pollutants had been released in violation of operating permits issued to Exxon for the Baytown complex."
Exxon,2017-4,"""The court finds given the number of days of violations and the quantitative amount of emissions released as a result, the seriousness factor weighs in favor of the assessment of a penalty,"" he wrote."
Exxon,2017-4,"The decision comes about a year after the Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals determined Hittner had errored in a 2014 ruling assessing Exxon's liability for pollution from the refinery, chemical plant and olefins plant in the Baytown complex in the esatern suburbs of Houston."
Exxon,2017-4,The Fifth Circuit Court sent the case back to Hittner to reassess Exxon's liability.
Exxon,2017-4,"The Baytown complex, which includes the second largest refinery in the United States, is regulated by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ), which had fined Exxon $1.4 million for pollution. Hittner deducted that amount in determining the penalty."
Exxon,2017-4,The penalty will be paid to the federal government. Hittner said Exxon was liable for legal fees incurred by the two environmental groups.

Exxon,2017-4,"Exxon Mobil Corp, the world's largest publicly traded oil producer, is expected to report that its quarterly profit doubled due, in part, to cost cuts. Separately, Chevron Corp, the second-largest U.S. oil producer, is expected to have swung to a profit due to cost cuts and help from its refining division."
Exxon,2017-4,"Federal Reserve Board Governor Lael Brainard is scheduled to speak on Fintech at a conference on ""Fintech and the Future of Finance"" at the Kellogg School of Management-Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois. Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia President Patrick Harker will speak on ""How STEM Can Get You Anywhere"" before the X-STEM Symposium in Washington."
Exxon,2017-4,"Tiremaker Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co is expected to report a drop in first-quarter profit, partly as raw material costs remain high. However, revenue is expected to rise.

Exxon,2017-4,Canadian uranium producer Cameco Corp is expected to report a small quarterly loss as excess supplies continue to weigh on prices. Investors will be keen to hear of any updates on a dispute with utility TEPCO over a canceled contract and Cameco's plans to sell U.S. mines.
Exxon,2017-4,{{20170427T163041.735+0000}}Republican lawmakers urge Trump to weaken Paris climate pact pledgeBy Timothy Gardner
Exxon,2017-4,"WASHINGTON, April 27 (Reuters) - A group of nine Republican lawmakers urged President Donald Trump to keep the United States in the 2015 Paris climate agreement but to reduce its pledge to cut greenhouse gas emissions, as Trump advisors were set on Thursday to discuss whether to leave the pact."
Exxon,2017-4,"Representative Kevin Cramer of oil-producing North Dakota and eight other members of the House of Representatives sent a letter to Trump urging him to use the country's ""seat at the Paris table to defend and promote our commercial interest, including our manufacturing and fossil fuel sectors."""
Exxon,2017-4,"If the United States is to stay in the 2015 agreement, Washington should present a new emissions cutting pledge that ""does no harm to our economy,"" the letter said."
Exxon,2017-4,"Former president Barack Obama, a Democrat, had pledged a 26 percent to 28 percent cut in U.S. greenhouse gas emissions from 2005 levels, by 2025. Most scientists say the world needs to curb greenhouse gas emissions to limit the effects of climate change including rising seas, deadly heatwaves, and severe storms and droughts."
Exxon,2017-4,White House advisors and Trump administration officials were set to meet on Thursday at 1:30 P.M. EDT (1730 GMT) to hold an initial discussion on whether to stay in the pact. [nL1N1HY1Q7]
Exxon,2017-4,Trump made cancelling the Paris agreement part of his 100-day plan for energy policy. He later said he was open to staying if Washington got better terms.
Exxon,2017-4,"Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, the former head of Exxon Mobil and Energy Secretary Rick Perry have said the country should remain in the agreement. Opponents of the pact in the administration include Scott Pruitt, the Environmental Protection Agency administrator and a former attorney general of oil producing Oklahoma, and Trump adviser Steve Bannon."
Exxon,2017-4,Nearly 200 countries struck the Paris agreement to limit climate change by cutting carbon dioxide emissions and making investments in clean energy.
Exxon,2017-4,Many global companies such as BP and Microsoft have urged the United States to stay in the agreement to protect their competitiveness.
Exxon,2017-4,"The lawmakers also said Washington should retain its seat on the Green Climate Fund, which aims to tackle climate change in poor countries, but not make additional transfers to it. The United States pledged $3 billion to the fund in 2014, and Obama gave $1 billion to it, with the last $500 million payment coming in his last days as president."
Exxon,2017-4,{{20170427T132423.916+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-Cox: Proximity to Trump no blessing for stocks(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.)
Exxon,2017-4,"NEW YORK, April 27 (Reuters Breakingviews) - The first 100 days of Donald Trump's presidency are shaping up as either a bust or huge. That's how politics rolls: success or failure is in the eye of the beholder. The stock market offers a bit more precision. One message from the 65-odd trading days since Trump took office decrying ""American carnage"" is that perceived proximity to the Oval Office is no blessing for companies' stock prices."
Exxon,2017-4,"Since the day before Trump's inauguration, the S&P 500 Index has gained 5 percent and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 6 percent. They've added around 15 percent and 17 percent, respectively, since the day before November's election, reflecting broad optimism about the prospects for lower taxes, deregulation and higher economic growth."
Exxon,2017-4,"Any investor who thought Trump's choice of former Exxon boss Rex Tillerson as secretary of state would quickly benefit the company was mistaken. Last week, the U.S. Treasury denied Exxon's request for a waiver of sanctions to allow it to drill for oil in Russia. The $348 billion oil giant has seen its stock slide almost 6 percent since the inauguration, wiping out $20 billion of market wealth."
Exxon,2017-4,"Exxon's share price dip is at least in line with the performance of other large energy companies. By contrast Goldman Sachs , one of the largest providers of talent to the Trump White House, is alone among big Wall Street firms in losing value under the new administration. Shares in the $91 billion investment bank have lost more than 3 percent since Trump put his hand on a bible. Its arch-rival, Morgan Stanley , has seen its shares bounce by nearly 4 percent, with other rivals doing similarly or better."
Exxon,2017-4,"Goldman executives who have made their way to Pennsylvania Avenue include former President Gary Cohn, now Trump's chief economic adviser. Dina Powell left Goldman for the White House and is now deputy national security adviser. Managing Director Jim Donovan is a nominee for deputy Treasury secretary. Two other former Goldmanites have the president's ear, including Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and chief strategist Stephen Bannon."
Exxon,2017-4,"Conversely Twitter , the president's favorite medium for reaching supporters directly, has suffered. Even after getting a bump from better-than-anticipated user growth on Wednesday, the company's shares are 8 percent less valuable than when Trump planted himself in the White House. Revenue fell 8 percent from the previous year, a sign some advertisers may be worried about promoting their brands and products alongside the oft-divisive content that appears on the messaging service."
Exxon,2017-4,"Nordstrom , the upscale retailer, has weathered the first 100 days of Trump with style despite, or perhaps because of, the president's scorn for its decision to stop selling his daughter Ivanka's line of clothing and accessories. Just a couple of weeks into his presidency, the president tweeted that she had been ""treated so unfairly."" The company's stock is up 8 percent since Jan. 19, while those of its rival department store chain Macy's are flat."
Exxon,2017-4,"Not all companies run by folks Trump likes for one reason or another are doing poorly. Blackstone stock has matched the broader market since Inauguration Day as founder and CEO Steven Schwarzman has emerged as chair of the president's economic advisory council. Shares of Twenty-First Century Fox , whose chairman, Rupert Murdoch, speaks to the president weekly, are flat."
Exxon,2017-4,"That said, one of the biggest dogs of the S&P is led by an entrepreneur who proudly hailed Trump ""as a real asset to this country"" just days into his presidency. The comments by Kevin Plank, Under Armour's founder and chief executive, drew a public rebuke from one of the sportswear maker's sponsored athletes, basketball star Stephen Curry. Under Armour shares are 28 percent poorer in the Trump era."
Exxon,2017-4,"It may all be coincidence. Yet it's tempting to speculate that being a corporate member of what Trump critics call the resistance may prove a market virtue. By the same token, proximity to the Oval Office could, at least for some, turn into a liability."

Exxon,2017-4,"HOUSTON, April 26 (Reuters) - A federal judge ruled on Wednesday that ExxonMobil Corp should pay a $19.95 million penalty for pollution from its Baytown, Texas, refining and chemical plant complex between 2005 and 2013."
Exxon,2017-4,"U.S. District Court Judge David Hittner issued the ruling in a citizen lawsuit brought under the U.S. Clean Air Act by two environmental groups, Environment Texas and the Sierra Club."
Exxon,2017-4,"Environment Texas welcomed the decision in the long-running suit, which was first filed in 2010."
Exxon,2017-4,"""We think it might be the largest citizen suit penalty in U.S. history,"" said Luke Metzger, director of Environment Texas. ""It definitely means it pays not to pollute."""
Exxon,2017-4,Exxon said it would consider its legal options and may appeal the ruling.
Exxon,2017-4,"""We disagree with the court's decision and the award of any penalty,"" Exxon spokesman Todd Spitler said in an emailed statement. ""As the court expressed in its decision, ExxonMobil's full compliance history and good faith efforts to comply weigh against assessing any penalty."""
Exxon,2017-4,"The suit was filed under a provision of the Clean Air Act that allows citizens to sue when regulators have failed to stop pollution. The two groups had contended the penalty could run as high as $573 million, but had only sought $41 million."
Exxon,2017-4,"In a 101-page decision, Hittner ruled there had been 16,386 days of violations and 10 million pounds (4.5 million kg) of pollutants had been released in violation of operating permits issued to Exxon for the Baytown complex."
Exxon,2017-4,"""The court finds given the number of days of violations and the quantitative amount of emissions released as a result, the seriousness factor weighs in favor of the assessment of a penalty,"" he wrote."
Exxon,2017-4,"The decision comes about a year after the Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals determined Hittner had errored in a 2014 ruling assessing Exxon's liability for pollution from the refinery, chemical plant and olefins plant in the Baytown complex in the esatern suburbs of Houston."
Exxon,2017-4,The Fifth Circuit Court sent the case back to Hittner to reassess Exxon's liability.
Exxon,2017-4,"The Baytown complex, which includes the second largest refinery in the United States, is regulated by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ), which had fined Exxon $1.4 million for pollution. Hittner deducted that amount in determining the penalty."
Exxon,2017-4,The penalty will be paid to the federal government. Hittner said Exxon was liable for legal fees incurred by the two environmental groups.

Exxon,2017-4,{{20170424T195118.372+0000}}PREVIEW-Cenovus earnings overshadowed by unpopular ConocoPhillips dealBy Ethan Lou and John Tilak
Exxon,2017-4,"CALGARY, Alberta/TORONTO, April 24 (Reuters) - As Cenovus Energy Inc prepares to release first-quarter earnings this week, investors are looking for answers about a recent C$17 billion ($12.6 billion) acquisition that wiped out about a fifth of its market value."
Exxon,2017-4,Disgruntled shareholders will grill Cenovus at an annual meeting on Wednesday following results about its purchase of most of ConocoPhillips' Canadian oil and gas assets.
Exxon,2017-4,"The deal ramped up Cenovus debt and pushed it into the largely unknown territory of natural gas, effectively doubling the size of the Canadian oil company.[nL1N1HJ17N]"
Exxon,2017-4,Some investors have questioned whether Cenovus overpaid for the assets at a time when foreign oil majors are retreating from the high-cost and heavily regulated Canadian oil sands industry.[nL3N1H65JB]
Exxon,2017-4,"""It's very much going to be a show-me story,"" said Mike O'Brien, managing director and head of the Core Canadian Equity team at TD Asset Management, a shareholder. While the deal's long-term logic is sound, it is still a question of whether the company can properly execute its plan, he said."
Exxon,2017-4,"Analysts expect Cenovus to post a loss of C$0.09 per share for the January-March quarter, compared with a C$0.14 per share loss a year ago, according to Thomson Reuters data. The company had higher-than-expected production for the first quarter and benefited from higher oil prices, Royal Bank of Canada analysts said."
Exxon,2017-4,"Apart from the debt taken to fund the ConocoPhillips deal, investors are concerned about Cenovus' move to diversify into natural gas with the purchase of Deep Basin assets and its ability to divest to pay for the assets."
Exxon,2017-4,"Benoit Gervais, portfolio manager at Mackenzie Investments, which owns Cenovus shares, said the company had no history or track record in conventional gas. ""I estimate they've overpaid by about C$5 billion,"" he said."
Exxon,2017-4,Cenovus shares fell 13.8 percent last month on news of the deal in their biggest ever single-day drop. The stock has since fallen another 5.6 percent.
Exxon,2017-4,"Buying Deep Basin flies in the face of the very identity of Cenovus, which was spun-off from predecessor Encana Corp to focus on crude, said one investor, who spoke on condition of anonymity as the person was not authorized to speak publicly on the issue."
Exxon,2017-4,"Still, the deal has some backers. Canada's oil-rich Alberta province, which holds a position in Cenovus through a government investment firm, said the company remained a good bet."
Exxon,2017-4,"Asked about investor concerns, a Cenovus spokesman referred to Chief Executive Brian Ferguson's comments this month that the company had a ""solid plan"" to finance the transaction and cut debt using increased cash flow and assets sales."
Exxon,2017-4,"Cenovus may sell parts of Deep Basin, RBC analysts said, a move that would please investors who balked at the purchase. [nL1N1HV0HX]"
Exxon,2017-4,"While the transaction itself does not require a vote, some shareholders may use Wednesday's meeting to express opposition to the deal by voting against company nominations for the board of directors."
Exxon,2017-4,"Cenovus reports earnings the same week as other Canadian crude producers including Suncor Energy Inc , Crescent Point Energy Corp and Exxon Mobil Corp-owned Imperial Oil Ltd ."

Exxon,2017-4,"NEW YORK, April 21 (Reuters) - Forget about French elections or the flagging Trump trade."
Exxon,2017-4,"Corporate America is set to unleash its biggest profit-reporting fest in at least a decade next week, with more than 190 members of the S&P 500 index <.SPX> delivering quarterly scorecards, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices data."
Exxon,2017-4,"The lineup accounts for around 40 percent of the benchmark index's value, or more than $7.7 trillion, and includes big names like Google's parent Alphabet Inc , Amazon.com Inc , Microsoft Corp and Exxon Mobil Corp ."
Exxon,2017-4,The onslaught could keep U.S. stock investors' focus largely on earnings next week even as the world's attention is likely to be drawn elsewhere.
Exxon,2017-4,"""That would be our hope,"" said Joe Zidle, portfolio strategist at Richard Bernstein Advisors in New York."
Exxon,2017-4,"""A lot of people looked at this market and said it was the result of the Trump bump or the Hillary relief rally,"" while earnings have been rebounding, he said. ""The faster earnings growth is underappreciated by investors."""
Exxon,2017-4,Many strategists have attributed the 10 percent rally in the S&P 500 <.INX> since Donald Trump's victory over Hillary Clinton in the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election to optimism Trump would boost the domestic economy through tax cuts and an infrastructure spending binge.
Exxon,2017-4,"The gains drove market valuations recently to their highest since 2004, even with little progress in Washington on the fiscal policy front. Meanwhile, other anxiety-provoking events have grabbed headlines, including unsettling relations with North Korea and this weekend's election in France, which has a bearing on the country's membership in the European Union and its currency, the euro. [nL1N1HR1BP]"
Exxon,2017-4,"Upbeat earnings from Morgan Stanley and other banks so far this reporting period cushioned those geopolitical worries, helping push the S&P 500 <.SPX> up 0.9 percent this week, its best such performance in two months. Shares of smaller companies did even better, with S&P's benchmark indexes for small <.SPCY> and mid-cap <.IDX> stocks notching their best weeks of 2017, with gains of between 2 percent and 3 percent."
Exxon,2017-4,"Expectations for the quarter's profit growth have risen as well, and the first three months of the year now appear set to mark the strongest quarterly earnings growth in more than five years. In the last week alone, expected S&P 500 first-quarter earnings per share growth rose to 11.2 percent from 10.4 percent, a more than 7 percent jump, according to Thomson Reuters data."
Exxon,2017-4,"""This week definitely has proven that the Street likes earnings - it's controllable, it's U.S.,"" said Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices."
Exxon,2017-4,"The reason for the slew of reports next week is anyone's guess, Silverblatt said, although recent holidays possibly played a role. Passover, Good Friday and Easter all fell in the previous weeks, which may have prompted some companies that typically report earlier to delay a week."
Exxon,2017-4,"Just 76 companies reported this week compared with 134 in the comparable week a year ago, Silverblatt said."
Exxon,2017-4,Next week's rush will represent a 15 percent increase from the 166 S&P constituents that reported in the comparable week last year.
Exxon,2017-4,"Thursday will be the busiest day with nearly 70 reports due, including updates after the closing bell from Alphabet, Amazon, Intel Corp , Microsoft and Starbucks Corp ."
Exxon,2017-4,"That could make for a bang in the market on Friday, Silverblatt said, which is also the final trading day of April."
Exxon,2017-4,"{{20170421T202450.538+0000}}UPDATE 2-U.S. will not give Exxon permission to drill in Russia(Adds Exxon statement, analyst quote, background)"
Exxon,2017-4,"WASHINGTON/SPRING, Tx., April 21 (Reuters) - The United States will not make an exception for American companies, including oil major Exxon Mobil Corp , seeking to drill in areas prohibited by U.S. sanctions on Russia, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Friday."
Exxon,2017-4,The unusually direct statement served to clarify that the United States would maintain a tough stance on sanctions against Moscow.
Exxon,2017-4,"""In consultation with President Donald J. Trump, the Treasury Department will not be issuing waivers to U.S. companies, including Exxon, authorizing drilling prohibited by current Russian sanctions,"" Mnuchin said in a statement."
Exxon,2017-4,"The United States and European Union imposed economic sanctions on Russia over its annexation of the Crimea region in 2014 and its role in the conflict in eastern Ukraine. The sanctions forced Exxon, the world's largest publicly traded oil producer, to wind down drilling in Russia's Arctic in 2014."
Exxon,2017-4,"""We understand the statement today by Secretary Mnuchin in consultation with President Trump,"" Exxon spokesman Alan Jeffers said."
Exxon,2017-4,"Exxon had asked for and received in 2015 and 2016 waivers to operate a joint venture with Russian oil producer Rosneft in Russia. European Union sanctions do not keep European oil companies from operating in Russia, a point of annoyance for Exxon."
Exxon,2017-4,The Wall Street Journal reported this week that Exxon had in recent months applied for a Treasury Department waiver to drill with Rosneft. Jeffers said Exxon had not applied for waivers from Treasury since Trump took office.
Exxon,2017-4,"Any such request would have drawn attention because Exxon's former chief executive, Rex Tillerson, is now U.S. secretary of state. Under his leadership, Exxon lobbied Congress on Russia sanctions, and Tillerson opposed sanctions against Russia in 2014, saying they would be ineffective."
Exxon,2017-4,U.S. lawmakers are investigating possible ties between some Trump campaign aides and Moscow. Republicans in Congress as well as U.S. allies in Europe are anxious about any sign that the Trump administration might ease some of the sanctions imposed on Russia.
Exxon,2017-4,"During his confirmation hearing in January, Tillerson said he never personally lobbied against sanctions and that he was not aware of Exxon Mobil directly doing so, later acknowledging that he spoke to former U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew regarding gaps between American and European sanctions on Russia. [nL1N1F10OH]"
Exxon,2017-4,Tillerson has pledged to recuse himself until the end of this year from any matter involving Exxon Mobil unless he is authorized to participate. He also has until early May to sell his Exxon Mobil stock.
Exxon,2017-4,"U.S. companies frequently file licence applications to the Treasury Department asking permission to undertake activities that would otherwise be barred by sanctions. The U.S. government weighs each application based on national security interests, the law and other factors."
Exxon,2017-4,"The refusal is unlikely to affect Exxon Mobil's bottom line, as it has not been able to operate in Russia for several years, but it does hinder its growth potential."
Exxon,2017-4,"Treasury almost never comments publicly on license applications. Mnuchin's statement will likely serve to clarify the U.S. stance on sanctions against Russia at a time when American allies are looking for clues to U.S. policy, observers said."
Exxon,2017-4,"""It's good from a regulatory perspective as it provides clarity to U.S. companies, but it's also great from a foreign policy perspective,"" Edward Fishman, a fellow at the Atlantic Council think tank and former State Department official during the Obama administration, said of Mnuchin's statement. ""Any uncertainty about the future of sanctions scares our allies and encourages Russia to prolong its aggression in Ukraine."""

Exxon,2017-4,* Pence witnesses signing of $10 bln in agreements with US firms
Exxon,2017-4,"JAKARTA, April 21 (Reuters) - Indonesia and the United States agreed on Friday to find ways to reduce barriers to U.S. companies operating in Southeast Asia's largest economy, visiting U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and Jakarta's investment chief said."
Exxon,2017-4,The Trump administration has put Indonesia on a list of 16 countries whose trade surpluses with the United States will be put under review. A series of disputes between Indonesia and American firms has also ruffled ties.
Exxon,2017-4,"""We will work with President Jokowi to reduce barriers to trade and investments and to create a truly level playing field where all our businesses have equal opportunity and market access,"" Pence said. Jokowi is the nickname of Indonesia's President Joko Widodo."
Exxon,2017-4,"""The president and I spoke about that very candidly and very respectfully,"" Pence told a roundtable discussion with business executives in Jakarta before flying to Australia on the last leg of his 10-day Asia-Pacific tour."
Exxon,2017-4,"Indonesia's investments barriers include a lack of intellectual property protection, insufficient transparency with regulations and requiring local content for manufactured goods sold in the Indonesian market, Pence said."
Exxon,2017-4,"Indonesia's Investment Coordinating Board chief Tom Lembong said Widodo agreed ""we still have too many regulations, too many barriers to trade, and these are bad for local and international industries""."
Exxon,2017-4,"""I'm optimistic because President Jokowi and President Trump are both lifelong business people, and I think they are very focused on the practical issues that hinder business and investment,"" Lembong told Reuters. ""I feel that the Trump administration and the Jokowi administration are on the same wavelength."""
Exxon,2017-4,"Lembong said Indonesia needs both investment and imports from the United States, ""especially productivity-enhancing products and services. You need imports to boost exports."""
Exxon,2017-4,Neither side disclosed any discussions about the disputes Indonesia has had with American companies of late.
Exxon,2017-4,"Over the past six months, Indonesia has wrestled with mining giant Freeport McMoRan , demanding the company divest 51 percent of its shares in its Papua-based gold and copper mine, and has demanded that Google Inc. settle unpaid taxes and fines of more than $400 million. Jakarta also scrubbed JP Morgan from its list of primary bond dealers after what was deemed a negative research report."
Exxon,2017-4,"Pence did, however, witness the signing of more than $10 billion in memoranda of understanding with U.S. companies in Indonesia on Friday."
Exxon,2017-4,"Among the 11 agreements were ones by Exxon Mobil to sell liquefied natural gas to Pertamina, Lockheed Martin to provide upgrades to the Indonesian Air Force's F-16s, and General Electric to develop electrical infrastructure in Indonesia."
Exxon,2017-4,"""We think there are opportunities to clear open the way for American companies to participate more greatly in Indonesia,"" Pence said, adding the agreements would ""draw our nations closer together and benefit both our people."""
Exxon,2017-4,"Pence said in opening remarks to the roundtable that an attack in central Paris is the latest reminder terrorism can strike anywhere at anytime, and the United States would not relent in its efforts to end terrorism."
Exxon,2017-4,"""The people of Indonesia can be confident in the wake of this latest attack: We will not relent in our effort to end terrorism and the threat it presents to both of our peoples,"" Pence said."
Exxon,2017-4,A French policeman was shot dead and two others were wounded in central Paris on Thursday night in an attack carried out days before presidential elections and quickly claimed by the Islamic State militant group.
Exxon,2017-4,"Indonesia, the world's largest Muslim-majority nation, has itself been hit by a series of deadly attacks over the past 15 years, led by militants affiliated with al Qaeda and more recently by Islamic State."
Exxon,2017-4,"Pence said Washington would continue working with Indonesia to combat terrorism. On Thursday, Pence toured the Istiqlal Mosque in Jakarta, Southeast Asia's largest, and said Indonesia's moderate form of Islam should serve as an example to other nations."
Exxon,2017-4,"Indonesia has expressed concern about the Trump administration's proposal to bar entry to citizens of some predominantly Muslim nations. That plan, however, remains stalled in courts."
Exxon,2017-4,Pence on Thursday announced Trump would visit Southeast Asia in November for an annual series of regional summits. They include the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting in Vietnam and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit in the Philippines.

Exxon,2017-4,"NEW YORK, April 20 (Reuters) - A group of 11 Republican state attorneys general are protesting an investigation into whether Exxon Mobil Corp. violated consumer protection laws when selling fossil fuel products, according to a court filing."
Exxon,2017-4,"Top prosecutors for Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Louisiana, Michigan, Nebraska, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Texas, Utah and Wisconsin, all of whom are Republicans, filed a brief in U.S. District Court in Manhattan supporting a lawsuit by Exxon to halt a probe by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman and Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey. [nL2N1H62AZ]"
Exxon,2017-4,"Schneiderman and Healey, both Democrats, are looking at whether the company violated consumer protection laws by selling fossil fuels while failing to reveal information about the effects of burning them on the global climate."
Exxon,2017-4,"In their brief, the attorneys general said Healey and Schneiderman were abusing their power and violating Exxon's rights to free speech by ""using law enforcement authority to resolve a public policy debate"" over whether carbon emissions cause climate change, a debate they claim is not settled."
Exxon,2017-4,"The brief cites a May 17, 2016, article in the conservative magazine the National Review by Scott Pruitt, who at the time was attorney general for Oklahoma and earlier this year was appointed by President Donald Trump to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, claiming ""scientists continue to disagree about the degree and extent of global warming and its connection to the actions of mankind."""
Exxon,2017-4,"An overwhelming majority of scientists believe that carbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels is a major contributor to global climate change, triggering sea level rise, droughts and more frequent violent storms. Pruitt said in a CNBC interview on March 9 that he did not agree carbon dioxide emissions were a ""primary contributor"" to climate change. [nL2N1GM1OH]"
Exxon,2017-4,"""The attorneys general have raised important constitutional and legal issues in support of our position that the investigations by New York and Massachusetts are politically based and in bad faith,"" said Exxon spokesman Scott Silvestri, adding that the probes were ""an attempt to silence political opponents who disagree on the appropriate policies to address climate change."""

Exxon,2017-4,"HOUSTON, April 20 (Reuters) - ConocoPhillips has beaten its 2017 asset sales target less than four months into the year, after shedding $30.8 billion worth of energy assets in six years."
Exxon,2017-4,"But instead of a chorus of cheers on Wall Street, Chief Executive Ryan Lance is facing investor skepticism that the company can deliver growth from remaining oil and gas fields."
Exxon,2017-4,"Lance told Reuters the sales to Cenovus Energy and Hilcorp Energy Co will fulfill promises to reduce long-term debt by 42 percent to $15 billion, fund $6 billion in share purchases and help reshape the company for an era of low and volatile energy prices."
Exxon,2017-4,Drilling in two shale regions should help restore falling U.S. output by the fourth quarter.

Exxon,2017-4,"ConocoPhillips can achieve flat to 2 percent annual production growth on its properties, after adjustments for sales, and deliver shareholder payouts, he said."
Exxon,2017-4,"But interviews with portfolio managers, former employees and industry analysts point to the frequent sales as a short-term fix. They worry ConocoPhillips' plan for modest production growth, flat capital spending and steady shareholder payouts pales in comparison to rivals that have retooled themselves to deliver sharply higher growth rates."
Exxon,2017-4,The danger of its reliance on fewer assets was driven home in recent weeks as a fire at a supplier hurt its ability to ship crude from oil-sands properties.[nL2N1HC1PW]
Exxon,2017-4,"Mike Breard, who tracks energy stocks for Hodges Capital Management, said the strategy lacks appeal."
Exxon,2017-4,"""If I wanted yield, I'd buy something else. If I wanted growth, I buy something else. I just don't see what customers would want to be in that in-between situation,"" Breard said."
Exxon,2017-4,The Houston company projects its daily production of crude and natural gas will fall 26 percent after the latest sales to about 1.16 million barrels of oil equivalent (boe). Barclays expects overall it won't return to production growth on a full-year basis until 2019.
Exxon,2017-4,"""They've sold a very valuable asset,"" said Marc Heilweil, senior portfolio manager at Atlanta-based investment firm Gratus Capital, referring to the oil-sands holdings."
Exxon,2017-4,"The deal will ""make it harder for them to fully replace reserves down the line"" because shale-oil properties have shorter productive lives, he said."
Exxon,2017-4,"To ensure growth, oil producers must continually add reserves to offset production and the natural decline that occurs in oil-and-gas properties."
Exxon,2017-4,"In 2012, ConocoPhillips spun off its refining business, leaving the ranks of the large, integrated companies like Exxon Mobil Corp and Chevron Corp , and putting it among a group of mostly-small U.S. independent exploration and production companies."
Exxon,2017-4,"Lance, who was the company's technology chief, became ConocoPhillips' chairman and CEO upon the spin off. He pledged to boost output by 3 percent to 5 percent annually by tapping its large pool of deep-water, oil-sands and conventional oil-and-gas properties. That goal ended two years later as prices collapsed, forcing it to borrow heavily to cover its spending on production. ConocoPhillips later cut its dividend."
Exxon,2017-4,"Its lack of exposure to refining has helped its shares stand out recently. The company's stock is down 4.3 percent year to date, even after an about 9 percent jump following the March 29 disclosure of a $3 billion addition to its share buy backs. In contrast, Chevron is 11.5 percent lower and Exxon is off about 10.8 percent in the same period."
Exxon,2017-4,"Of analysts with published ratings on the stock, 7 rate it a strong buy, 11 rate it a buy and 6 rate it a hold. That compares to Chevron with 6 strong buy ratings, 12 buy ratings and 3 hold ratings."
Exxon,2017-4,"Last fall, Lance recast ConocoPhillips as an energy company able to offer steady shareholder returns on flat production spending of about $5 billion a year. It shaved its growth target to as much 2 percent, instead of up to 5 percent, and promised 20 percent to 30 percent of operating cash flow would go to holders via dividends and buy backs."
Exxon,2017-4,"He insists the remaining assets can generate substantial cash from operations even if oil falls below $40 a barrel. ConocoPhillips is ramping up output from its Eagle Ford and Bakken shale wells, from another oil-sands property and liquefied natural gas (LNG) from operations in Australia."
Exxon,2017-4,"Meanwhile, rivals have cranked up their production much faster. U.S. shale-focused companies project 15 percent volume growth this year, says consultancy Wood Mackenzie, and the larger oil producers such as Chevron are raising output and delivering fatter dividends."
Exxon,2017-4,"ConocoPhillips will be producing an average 1.25 million boe a day in 2019, estimates Barclays. In contrast, Chevron projects its daily output this year will rise between 103,000 boe and 233,000 boe over 2016's average 2.59 million boe, excluding divestitures. Chevron pays a 4 percent dividend."
Exxon,2017-4,"The risk for ConocoPhillips investors is the growth in production doesn't generate higher free cash flow for share buy backs, and the 2 percent dividend yield, about half that of Chevron, becomes the bigger part of returns."
Exxon,2017-4,"Henry Smith, co-chief investment officer at Haverford Trust, which invests in companies offering revenue growth and dividend gains, sold ConocoPhillips shares ahead of its 2016 dividend cut and has not been tempted back by the new strategy."
Exxon,2017-4,"ConocoPhillips' pledge to deliver steady returns and growth is appealing, said Smith. But, he added: ""Exxon over the years has fit that bill."" Haverford's oil-industry holdings are Exxon Mobil Corp , Chevron and Schlumberger NV , he said."
Exxon,2017-4,"Tom Bergeron, an equity analyst at Frost Bank, also prefers other oil producers such as Chevron and Occidental Petroleum Corp for what he said is their expected growth and their higher dividend yields."
Exxon,2017-4,"Lance, who worked summers as an oilfield roughneck while studying petroleum engineering in Montana, said he understands investors want proof the company can deliver regular payouts without the asset sales."
Exxon,2017-4,"""It'll probably take performance through a cycle to demonstrate we have the position and the passion to deliver,"" he said, referring to the industry's boom and bust periods."

Exxon,2017-4,"AMSTERDAM, April 20 (Reuters) - A Dutch court ordered prosecutors to open an investigation on Thursday into whether a Shell-Exxon joint venture bears any criminal responsibility for earthquakes triggered by production at the country's largest gas field."
Exxon,2017-4,"No physical injuries have been caused by numerous small quakes, which have damaged thousands of buildings and structures across the north-eastern province of Groningen, and prosecutors had previously declined to act, arguing it was a civil matter."

Exxon,2017-4,"NAM, which has accepted civil responsibility for damage caused by the quakes and is paying damages of more than 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion), said in a statement it was surprised by the decision over Groningen, which was discovered in 1959 and is one of the world's largest gas fields."

Exxon,2017-4,"Earlier this week, the Dutch government said it will again cut output at the field to lessen the risk posed by quakes, the fourth such move since the Safety Board's pivotal February 2015 report said authorities had ignored potential risks at Groningen for decades and were putting lives in danger.

Exxon,2017-4,"In 2012, ConocoPhillips spun off its refining business, leaving the ranks of the large, integrated companies like Exxon Mobil Corp and Chevron Corp , and putting it among a group of mostly-small U.S. independent exploration and production companies."
Exxon,2017-4,"Lance, who was the company's technology chief, became ConocoPhillips' chairman and CEO upon the spin off. He pledged to boost output by 3 percent to 5 percent annually by tapping its large pool of deep-water, oil-sands and conventional oil-and-gas properties. That goal ended two years later as prices collapsed, forcing it to borrow heavily to cover its spending on production. ConocoPhillips later cut its dividend."
Exxon,2017-4,"Its lack of exposure to refining has helped its shares stand out recently. The company's stock is down 4.3 percent year to date, even after an about 9 percent jump following the March 29 disclosure of a $3 billion addition to its share buy backs. In contrast, Chevron is 11.5 percent lower and Exxon is off about 10.8 percent in the same period."
Exxon,2017-4,"Of analysts with published ratings on the stock, 7 rate it a strong buy, 11 rate it a buy and 6 rate it a hold. That compares to Chevron with 6 strong buy ratings, 12 buy ratings and 3 hold ratings."
Exxon,2017-4,"Last fall, Lance recast ConocoPhillips as an energy company able to offer steady shareholder returns on flat production spending of about $5 billion a year. It shaved its growth target to as much 2 percent, instead of up to 5 percent, and promised 20 percent to 30 percent of operating cash flow would go to holders via dividends and buy backs."
Exxon,2017-4,"He insists the remaining assets can generate substantial cash from operations even if oil falls below $40 a barrel. ConocoPhillips is ramping up output from its Eagle Ford and Bakken shale wells, from another oil-sands property and liquefied natural gas (LNG) from operations in Australia."
Exxon,2017-4,"Meanwhile, rivals have cranked up their production much faster. U.S. shale-focused companies project 15 percent volume growth this year, says consultancy Wood Mackenzie, and the larger oil producers such as Chevron are raising output and delivering fatter dividends."
Exxon,2017-4,"ConocoPhillips will be producing an average 1.25 million boe a day in 2019, estimates Barclays. In contrast, Chevron projects its daily output this year will rise between 103,000 boe and 233,000 boe over 2016's average 2.59 million boe, excluding divestitures. Chevron pays a 4 percent dividend."
Exxon,2017-4,"The risk for ConocoPhillips investors is the growth in production doesn't generate higher free cash flow for share buy backs, and the 2 percent dividend yield, about half that of Chevron, becomes the bigger part of returns."
Exxon,2017-4,"Henry Smith, co-chief investment officer at Haverford Trust, which invests in companies offering revenue growth and dividend gains, sold ConocoPhillips shares ahead of its 2016 dividend cut and has not been tempted back by the new strategy."
Exxon,2017-4,"ConocoPhillips' pledge to deliver steady returns and growth is appealing, said Smith. But, he added: ""Exxon over the years has fit that bill."" Haverford's oil-industry holdings are Exxon Mobil Corp , Chevron and Schlumberger NV , he said."
Exxon,2017-4,"Tom Bergeron, an equity analyst at Frost Bank, also prefers other oil producers such as Chevron and Occidental Petroleum Corp for what he said is their expected growth and their higher dividend yields."
Exxon,2017-4,"Lance, who worked summers as an oilfield roughneck while studying petroleum engineering in Montana, said he understands investors want proof the company can deliver regular payouts without the asset sales."
Exxon,2017-4,"""It'll probably take performance through a cycle to demonstrate we have the position and the passion to deliver,"" he said, referring to the industry's boom and bust periods."

Exxon,2017-4,"HOUSTON, April 19 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp on Wednesday declined to comment on a media report that it is seeking permission from the U.S. government to drill in several areas of the Black Sea banned by U.S. sanctions on Russia."
Exxon,2017-4,"The Wall Street Journal reported that Exxon had in recent months applied to the U.S. Treasury Department for a waiver to drill with Russian oil producer Rosneft . Any such request is likely to draw attention because Exxon's former chief executive, Rex Tillerson, is now U.S. secretary of state."
Exxon,2017-4,"Exxon spokesman Alan Jeffers said the company does not comment on ongoing discussions with regulators. But he pointed out that it has in the past been granted permission from Treasury to keep intact Exxon's joint venture with Rosneft, despite the sanctions."
Exxon,2017-4,"During at least three occasions in 2015 and 2016, Exxon was granted licenses allowing ""limited administrative actions"" in Russia, according to annual shareholder disclosures."
Exxon,2017-4,The United States and European Union imposed economic sanctions on Russia over its annexation of the Crimea region in 2014 and role in the conflict in eastern Ukraine.
Exxon,2017-4,"Texas-based Exxon, the world's largest publicly traded oil producer, wound down drilling in Russia's Arctic in 2014 after those sanctions were imposed. Exxon was allowed to finish some drilling projects as the sanctions took effect."
Exxon,2017-4,Exxon and Rosneft in 2012 had unveiled an offshore exploration partnership with plans to invest as much as $500 billion in developing Russia's vast energy reserves in the Arctic and Black seas.
Exxon,2017-4,Any request from Exxon to expand its business in Russia is bound to draw scrutiny from U.S. lawmakers investigating possible ties between some campaign aides of U.S. President Donald Trump and Moscow.
Exxon,2017-4,"Some Republicans in Congress, as well as some European allies, are also anxious about any sign that the Trump administration might ease some of the sanctions imposed on Russia."

Exxon,2017-4,The company wound down drilling in Russia's Arctic in 2014 in the face of U.S. sanctions targeting cooperation between Western companies and Moscow's oil sector.

Exxon,2017-4,"April 12 (Reuters) - Billionaire investor Carl Icahn's oil refining company, CVR Energy , made a massive bet in 2016 that prices for U.S. government biofuels credits would fall - just before Icahn started advising President Donald Trump on regulations driving that market."
Exxon,2017-4,The size and specifics of the gamble - involving $186 million worth of biofuels credits the company said it needed at the end of 2016 to satisfy regulatory requirements - have not been previously reported by the media.
Exxon,2017-4,"The credit system is designed to encourage the mixing of renewable fuels, such as ethanol, into gasoline or diesel. The government awards the biofuels credits to firms that produce such blends - and requires firms that don't, such as CVR, to buy the credits from their competitors."
Exxon,2017-4,"Icahn's firm positioned itself to slash those regulatory costs by tens of millions of dollars if biofuels credit prices declined, according to a Reuters review of CVR filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and interviews with two brokers involved in the firm's trading of biofuels credits."
Exxon,2017-4,"That strategy looked prescient, starting in December, as prices for biofuels credits fell in response to a series of political events tied to the election of Trump. These included his appointment of Icahn - a vocal critic of biofuels credit mandates - as an unpaid ""special advisor to the President"" on regulatory issues."
Exxon,2017-4,"In February, biofuels credit prices fell again after the famed activist investor proposed policy changes to the White House that would free certain refiners - including CVR - from their obligation to buy the credits."
Exxon,2017-4,"Icahn, who owns an 82-percent stake in CVR Energy, did not respond to repeated phone calls and emails seeking comment. He has said previously that his advocacy on biofuels regulation is not self-serving because it would benefit a broad swath of the U.S. refining industry, including some of CVR's competitors."
Exxon,2017-4,"Spokespeople for CVR and the Trump administration declined to comment. White House spokeswoman Kelly Love has said previously that Icahn was acting as a private individual in pushing biofuels policy changes and that his ""special advisor"" appointment was not a formal job in the administration."
Exxon,2017-4,"CVR has not publicly disclosed the number of credits it sold to other firms or the prices paid, and Reuters was unable to determine the specific amounts."
Exxon,2017-4,"At year end, after the credit sales, CVR estimated it needed credits worth $186 million to meet its regulatory obligations, according an SEC filing reviewed by Reuters."
Exxon,2017-4,"The credits may end up costing CVR much less, however, because market prices for renewable fuel credits have since dived."
Exxon,2017-4,"Last year, when CVR was unloading credits, they sold for an average of 77 cents - and peaked at more than $1, according to prices compiled by Oil Price Information Service."
Exxon,2017-4,But prices dropped to about 53 cents by March 31. Biofuels credits traded at 55 cents on Tuesday.
Exxon,2017-4,CVR isn't assured of big savings. The amount of money the firm is ultimately forced to spend on biofuels credits depends on their price when it decides to purchase them.
Exxon,2017-4,"But CVR's credit sell-off last year gave the firm two potentially lucrative options: It could have purchased enough new credits - after prices plummeted early this year - to meet government mandates before March 31; or it could have delayed the required purchases for one more year, as allowed by law, in the hopes that credit prices would fall even further."
Exxon,2017-4,CVR declined to comment on which of those options the company chose.
Exxon,2017-4,"Icahn's policy recommendations to Trump, if enacted, would likely further undermine the value of the credits by reducing demand from refiners such as CVR, which do not have the facilities needed to blend ethanol into gasoline, credit brokers and industry experts said."
Exxon,2017-4,Some Democratic lawmakers and biofuels advocates have argued that Icahn's policy recommendations to the Republican administration create a conflict of interest with his investments.
Exxon,2017-4,"Icahn should not be advising Trump on policy changes that move markets in which Icahn is ""speculating deeply,"" said Brooke Coleman, executive director of the Advanced Biofuels Business Council, a trade group that represents producers of renewable fuels and opposes Icahn's policy recommendations."
Exxon,2017-4,"""What he's saying would allow him to make more money,"" Coleman said. ""He's in a position to perpetually put uncertainty out in the marketplace."""
Exxon,2017-4,"Richard Painter - a law professor at the University of Minnesota and the chief White House ethics lawyer for former President George W. Bush from 2005 to 2007 - believes that Icahn's unique access to the White House and influence on policy creates a conflict even though, as an informal advisor, he isn't getting a government paycheck."
Exxon,2017-4,"""We don't give out knighthoods in the United States. If you have a title, that means you have a job,"" Painter said."
Exxon,2017-4,"Some experts, however, argue that Icahn avoided a conflict of interest by not taking a paid government position."
Exxon,2017-4,"""He's free to give his advice. People do that all the time. The rulemaker is free to take their advice or not,"" said Charles Elson, a finance professor at the University of Delaware. ""That's as old as Washington."""
Exxon,2017-4,"The credits were created under the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard, initially enacted in 2005 under the administration of George W. Bush."
Exxon,2017-4,"The law aimed to cut greenhouse gas emissions and reduce dependence on foreign oil, while giving a boost to rural economies that grow corn for ethanol production."
Exxon,2017-4,"Icahn has called the requirement ""absurd"" and ""insane"" because it punishes some refiners for failing to do something that they have no ability to do."
Exxon,2017-4,"Icahn's proposal to the White House would shift the burden of blending ethanol and other biofuels - or buying credits - to a variety of firms with blending facilities, such as integrated oil firms, traders, fuel distributors and retailers."
Exxon,2017-4,The full details of Icahn's proposal have not been made public. White House sources have previously told Reuters that the administration is considering the policy change but is concerned about a potential backlash from the ethanol industry.
Exxon,2017-4,Icahn's policy proposal is one of several political events that drove down prices in the biofuels credit markets.
Exxon,2017-4,"Prices tanked on December 7 after Trump appointed Scott Pruitt - a critic of biofuels regulation - to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, which implements those rules."
Exxon,2017-4,"Credit values declined even faster after December 22, with the naming of Icahn as an advisor on regulation."
Exxon,2017-4,"The next trading day, biofuels credit prices dropped to an intraday low of 30 cents."

Exxon,2017-4,"SINGAPORE, April 10 (Reuters) - Malaysia's Petronas has pitched an estimated $1 billion stake in a prized upstream local gas project to potential bidders including Royal Dutch Shell , ExxonMobil Corp , Thailand's PTT Exploration and Production and Japanese firms, sources familiar with the matter said."
Exxon,2017-4,"If successful, the deal could mark Petronas' biggest upstream stake sale since oil prices started declining more than two years ago. Petronas is targeting lowering operating expenses, job cuts and project rollbacks to help it navigate through the low oil price environment. [nL4N1G51LI]"
Exxon,2017-4,"Citing sources, Reuters reported in February that Petronas was considering selling a stake of as much as 49 percent in the SK316 offshore gas block in Malaysia's Sarawak state. [nL4N1G52FP]"
Exxon,2017-4,"The state-owned oil and gas company has approached about a dozen prospective buyers including global oil majors and Asian firms focused on Southeast Asia, said the sources, who declined to be identified as the talks are private."
Exxon,2017-4,They said Petronas has begun providing financial and operational data to the companies and expects to receive bids over the next few weeks.
Exxon,2017-4,"""It's just what the environment is. Nobody wants to keep all the risk on their books,"" said Vikas Halan, senior credit officer, corporate finance group at Moody's, adding he viewed the move as a rebalancing of Petronas' portfolio."
Exxon,2017-4,"""Petronas is the leader in the oil and gas space, especially on the gas side. The experience of getting or producing LNG and marketing LNG is quite an interesting one and Petronas becomes a logical choice for players,"" he said."
Exxon,2017-4,"In a statement to Reuters, Petronas said that through its subsidiary, Petronas Carigali Sdn Bhd, it is looking for partners who can bring the technology and capabilities to explore, develop and efficiently operate the various fields and opportunities in the SK316 offshore gas block."
Exxon,2017-4,"""We are confident that we will attract the right partners to maximise the potential value of these opportunities to help meet the world's growing oil and gas demand,"" Petronas said."
Exxon,2017-4,It was not immediately known what the individual companies' response to Petronas' approach was.
Exxon,2017-4,"One financial source said a minority stake might not appeal to non-Asian oil majors but a decision to bid would depend on details of the stake being offered, valuations and the potential for long term partnerships with Petronas."
Exxon,2017-4,"ExxonMobil declined to comment, while Shell referred the query to Petronas. A spokeswoman for PTTEP declined to comment on the deal but said the company was keen to invest in Southeast Asia because it had expertise in the region where costs and risks were low. [nL8N1G71WZ]"
Exxon,2017-4,"Gas from the NC3 field in the SK316 block feeds Malaysia's LNG export project, known as LNG 9, Petronas' joint venture with JX Nippon Oil & Energy Corp <5020.T> that began commercial production in January. [nL4N1FD2QM]"
Exxon,2017-4,Petronas could use the funds from the stake sale to develop the Kasawari field in the same block. The field is one of the largest non-associated gas fields in Malaysia and has an estimated recoverable hydrocarbon resource of about three trillion standard cubic feet.
Exxon,2017-4,"""Kasawari will require a significant capital investment to develop due to the high CO2 content,"" said Prasanth Kakaraparthi, senior upstream research analyst at consultancy Wood Mackenzie."

The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.)
Exxon,2017-4,"LONDON, April 6 (Reuters Breakingviews) - BP's slashed pay package for its chief executive still looks relatively kind. A 40 percent cut to Bob Dudley's total remuneration to $11.6 million in 2016 represents a reasonable way for the British energy giant to balance shareholder appeasement and retaining the American oil man's services. But the new package means he is hardly donning a hair shirt."
Exxon,2017-4,"Dudley's long-term bonus targets don't look excessively taxing, either. True, getting the whole payout means being first out of five compared to BP's main peers on a total shareholder return basis and achieving an 11 percent return on average capital employed. But to start paying out, he merely needs to be third out of five on total return, and hit a 6 percent return on average capital employed."
Exxon,2017-4,"Shareholders will know that some of BP's problems, like a 55 percent drop in the oil price over the last five years, are out of Dudley's control. They also know he has drawn a line under the compensation BP had to pay for the Gulf of Mexico disaster in 2010. But over the last five years the company has underperformed total returns of Total , Chevron and Exxon Mobil in dollar terms, with only Shell being worse. Given that, the hair shirt could have been hairier still."
Exxon,2017-4,- BP said on April 6 it had cut Chief Executive Bob Dudley's pay by 40 percent to $11.6 million in 2016.

Exxon,2017-4,"{{20170407T062917.389+0000}}Exxon Mobil markets mid-term Papua New Guinea LNG suppliesCHIBA, Japan, April 7 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp is marketing 1.3 million tonnes per year (mtpa) of mid-term liquefied natural gas volumes from its $19 billion Papua New Guinea LNG (PNG LNG) plant, reflecting overproduction and an increase in gas reserves."
Exxon,2017-4,"The two-train plant with an original nameplate capacity of 6.9 million tonnes a year produced 7.9 million tonnes last year, making it possible to offer the excess for sale, Stephen McCusker, Vice President of PNG Marketing at ExxonMobil Asia Pacific Pte Ltd told Reuters at a gas conference in Japan."
Exxon,2017-4,"The move is also possible as ExxonMobil PNG, operator of the PNG LNG joint venture, said in February that a study showed that the likely technically recoverable natural gas from all PNG LNG fields is 11.5 trillion cubic feet (tcf), up a quarter from an earlier assessment of 9.2 tcf."
Exxon,2017-4,"""Originally we contracted for the base project 6.6 mtpa, and last year we produced close to 7.9 mtpa, so the 1.3 mtpa plus the additional recertification gives us an opportunity to approach the market with the mid-term contracts,"" McCusker told Reuters on Thursday at the Gastech conference in Chiba."
Exxon,2017-4,"PNG LNG's main four long-term customers are top global LNG buyer JERA Co at 1.8 million tonnes a year, Osaka Gas <9532.T> at 1.5 million, Taiwan's CPC with 1.2 million, and China's Sinopec <600028.SS> at 2 million tonnes a year."
Exxon,2017-4,"The PNG project sells the remainder as spot and short-term supplies to those four and other customers, Exxon Mobil said."
Exxon,2017-4,"The U.S. oil and gas major and its joint venture partners are also looking at some upcoming opportunities, McCusker said."
Exxon,2017-4,"""Other fields that we've already discovered within the project, and of course, the other projects that are occurring around us - obviously the Total project - so PNG LNG is looking at those opportunities,"" he said."
Exxon,2017-4,"Exxon Mobil and Total SA , vying to develop new gas fields in Papua New Guinea to tap into an expected market recovery in the next decade, are likely to face tougher terms than Exxon Mobil's PNG LNG project. [nL4N1E00Z2] [nL2N1GE0XV]"
Exxon,2017-4,"Prime Minister O'Neill has said the government had been generous when negotiating Exxon Mobil's PNG LNG project in 2009, as it was looking to secure the country's biggest foreign investment despite the global financial crisis."

Exxon,2017-4,"HOUSTON, April 3 (Reuters) - NAmerico Partners LP is proposing a multibillion-dollar pipeline to ferry natural gas from fast-growing fields in West Texas to the Gulf Coast, the company said on Monday, angling to match plans by rivals such as Kinder Morgan Inc ."
Exxon,2017-4,"The pipeline, one of at least three being considered to ease a looming gas glut in the Permian producing region, would link to existing lines, including those that export gas to Mexico and to a Cheniere Energy Inc liquefied natural gas export facility under construction."
Exxon,2017-4,"The pipeline would be the first major project by NAmerico Partners, founded two years ago in Houston. The company is backed by private equity fund Cresta Energy LP, whose management includes former executives from Regency Energy Partners LP, a large energy infrastructure company that was bought by Energy Transfer Partners in 2015."
Exxon,2017-4,"NAmerico Managing Partner Jeff Welch told Reuters in an interview this week that discussions with prospective shippers were at an advanced stage, and the pipeline would begin operations in 2019 if enough of them committed to supplying gas."
Exxon,2017-4,He declined to identify the shippers but said the company was confident the project would proceed.
Exxon,2017-4,"NAmerico's 468-mile (753-km) pipeline, named the Pecos Trail Pipeline, would transport some 1.85 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas to the major Gulf Coast refining and petrochemical hub in Corpus Christi."
Exxon,2017-4,"Last month, Kinder Morgan, which operates the largest natural gas pipeline network in North America, outlined a plan to build a 430-mile (692-kilometer) pipe traveling a similar route. It would be able to move 1.7 bcf per day of gas."
Exxon,2017-4,"Enterprise Products Partners , another large pipeline operator, has said it may build a gas line to Corpus Christi, Texas, from the Permian."
Exxon,2017-4,"""We've got this gigantic gas supply in West Texas, and big exports southbound and eastbound,"" Rick Smead, managing director of advisory services for consultancy RBN Energy, said in a telephone interview."
Exxon,2017-4,Kinder Morgan has also said its pipeline would begin operations in 2019 if enough shippers commit.
Exxon,2017-4,Analysts said the potential for new supplies could allow multiple projects to proceed.
Exxon,2017-4,"The projects are being planned as big producers including Exxon Mobil , Apache Corp , and Chevron Corp are expected to pour billions of dollars into drilling in the Permian, a vast shale play in West Texas known for its low production costs and massive reserves."
Exxon,2017-4,"Demand for natural gas in south Texas and the Corpus Christi area is expected to soar in the coming years. Cheniere Energy has said it has customers for 8.42 million metric tons a year of LNG from its site, which is expected to begin operations around 2018."
Exxon,2017-4,"Exxon and Saudi Basic Industries Corp <2010.SE>, an arm of Saudi Aramco, the state-owned energy company, also have proposed building a multibillion-dollar chemical and plastics plant outside of Corpus Christi. That plant would use natural gas as a raw material."
Exxon,2017-4,"Natural gas production in West Texas is expected to more than quadruple by the middle of the next decade, Scott Sheffield, chief executive of Pioneer Natural Resources Co , a large Permian producer, said last month."
Exxon,2017-4,"Gas production in the Permian is projected to reach 7.9 Bcf/d in April, up from 5.4 bcf/d the same month in 2014, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration."
Exxon,2017-4,"The number of drilling rigs operating in the region has more than doubled in the last year to 319 as of March 31, according to energy services provider Baker Hughes ."
Exxon,2017-4,"While companies are primarily drilling in the Permian for crude, natural gas comes up along with it. The EIA estimates each new rig in March added in the Permian increases the field's gas production by 1.1 million cubic feet a day."
