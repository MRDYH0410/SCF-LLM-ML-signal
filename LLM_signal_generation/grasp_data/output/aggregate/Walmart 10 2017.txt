walmart,2017-10,{{20171026T203317.018+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-Heavy Amazon investment aims at rivals - and costs(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.)
walmart,2017-10,"Third-quarter revenue rose 34 percent to $43.7 billion. Profit remains a relative afterthought at Amazon. Bezos has long made it clear that the company focuses on the long-run opportunities that come with pleasing customers. That means faster delivery, selling new items, producing TV shows, and using the efficiencies that come with size to cut costs."
walmart,2017-10,"Amazon is pressing its foot to the floor on investment. Free cash flow was $8 billion over the last 12 months, but it used all of this and another $1 billion on capital expenditure and costs associated with leases. The company is adding roughly 1 million square feet of fulfillment centers every week, estimates Jefferies. Efforts to use the newly acquired Whole Foods Market outlets to expand in groceries mean additional specialized warehouses."
walmart,2017-10,"Expansion won't slow soon. The most obvious sign of this is Amazon's plan to build a second headquarters, where it will invest more than $5 billion and create up to 50,000 jobs. Over 200 cities have applied."
walmart,2017-10,"Yet rising costs force Bezos to invest more and more. Amazon lost over $7 billion subsidizing shipping to customers last year. This year's figure will be higher, as volume has increased, shipping companies are raising prices and adding surcharges, and Amazon is offering free shipping more often to compete against the still powerful Wal-Mart . The company is taking over more logistics for itself, running more trucks and planes, and opening warehouses closer to consumers."
walmart,2017-10,"Meanwhile the hugely successful Amazon Web Services cloud business also faces strong competitors, notably Alphabet and Microsoft . Hedge-fund manager and Amazon skeptic David Einhorn observed this week that ""just because Amazon can disrupt somebody else's profit stream, it doesn't mean that Amazon earns that profit stream."""
walmart,2017-10,"Bezos' heavy investment suggests he knows this. The outlay is intended partly to reduce ongoing costs, to keep Amazon profitable as it chomps into competitive markets. That may end up a tougher task than beating his rivals."
walmart,2017-10,"- Amazon on Oct. 26 reported revenue of $43.7 billion for the third quarter, an increase of 34 percent from the same period last year. The company earned 52 cents per diluted share in the quarter, the same as it did a year ago."

walmart,2017-10,"Oct 26 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc's audacious spending on original TV shows and movies, its cloud business and an ever-expanding core retail operations, will be closely watched by investors when the retail giant reports results on Thursday."
walmart,2017-10,Wall Street has often overlooked the company's relatively small profits as Chief Executive Jeff Bezos chases growth.
walmart,2017-10,"Bezos has looked to cement the company's position as a leader in cloud services, become a formidable foe of Netflix Inc , and disrupt the retail industry with its recent purchase of premium grocer Whole Foods."
walmart,2017-10,"This quarter, however, investors will want to see if Amazon's operating income is being pressured as it cuts prices to fight competition from Wal-Mart Stores Inc , which is investing heavily in its own online business."
walmart,2017-10,"""The open question for the fourth quarter is whether they will have to compete on price because Wal-Mart is making such a push into online,"" Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter said in a preview note."
walmart,2017-10,"""If their guidance for operating profit is substantially below a year ago, then that's a signal that they intend to compete on price."""
walmart,2017-10,Amazon closed its $13.7 billion Whole Foods buy on Aug. 28 and immediately slashed prices of some products at the grocer.
walmart,2017-10,"Analysts say the price cuts and investments in other sectors, from cloud computing to video, are likely to raise the company's costs and reduce third-quarter operating income."
walmart,2017-10,Amazon has given a wide forecast range - between operating income of $300 million and an operating loss of $400 million.
walmart,2017-10,"Analysts on average are expecting $144.6 million, according to data and analytics firm FactSet."
walmart,2017-10,"The company said in July it expected third-quarter revenue of $39.25 billion to $41.75 billion. Analysts expect revenue to rise 29 percent $42.14 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S."
walmart,2017-10,Amazon's shares were up 0.6 percent in early trading on Thursday. They have dropped 7 percent since the company reported second-quarter results on July 27.
walmart,2017-10,"Investors acknowledge that Amazon's ambitions to disrupt multiple industries requires constant spending, and lower margins may not be a big concern, Barclays analysts said in their preview note."
walmart,2017-10,The company's operating costs jumped 29 percent to $32.14 billion in the third quarter of 2016.
walmart,2017-10,"Shareholders will also be closely watching Amazon's holiday-quarter forecast, he said, adding that the company might forecast disappointing fourth-quarter operating income."
walmart,2017-10,Amazon reported operating income of $1.11 billion in the fourth quarter of 2016.
walmart,2017-10,"The high level of spending is not going to slow this year either, analysts said."
walmart,2017-10,Video will remain an area where Amazon spends heavily as original shows help it gain and retain subscribers. Rival Netflix Inc commands the online-streaming market by spending billions on original shows.
walmart,2017-10,"""The beauty of Amazon versus Netflix is that Amazon can monetize its video content through retail, Netflix unfortunately doesn't have that luxury,"" said Benchmark Co analyst Daniel Kurnos."

walmart,2017-10,"CHICAGO, Oct 26 (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc is rolling out shelf-scanning robots in more than 50 U.S. stores to replenish inventory faster and save employees time when products run out."
walmart,2017-10,"The approximately 2-foot (0.61-meter) robots come with a tower that is fitted with cameras that scan aisles to check stock and identify missing and misplaced items, incorrect prices and mislabeling. The robots pass that data to store employees, who then stock the shelves and fix errors."
walmart,2017-10,Out-of-stock items are a big problem for retailers since they miss out on sales every time a shopper cannot find a product on store shelves.
walmart,2017-10,"Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer has been testing shelf-scanning robots in a handful of stores in Arkansas, Pennsylvania and California."

walmart,2017-10,The company said the robots would not replace workers or affect employee headcount in stores.
walmart,2017-10,"The robots are 50 percent more productive than their human counterparts and can scan shelves significantly more accurately and three times faster, King said. Store employees only have time to scan shelves about twice a week."
walmart,2017-10,"The idea of installing robots to automate retail is not new. Rival Amazon.com Inc uses small Kiva robots in its warehouses to handle picking and packing, saving almost 20 percent in operating expenses."
walmart,2017-10,"For Wal-Mart, the move is part of a broader effort to digitize its stores to make shopping faster."
walmart,2017-10,"In the past year, it has installed giant ""pickup towers"" that operate like self-service kiosks and where customers can pick up their online orders."
walmart,2017-10,"The company has also speeded up the checkout process by allowing customers to scan their own purchases, and it has digitized operations like pharmacy and financial services in stores."

walmart,2017-10,Oct 20 (Reuters) - U.S. retailers are finding it increasingly difficult to hire employees for stores and for middle and higher management as low pay and a feeling of uncertainty clouds the industry following a spate of bankruptcies and store closures.
walmart,2017-10,"Retailers including Macy's Inc and J.C. Penney have said they will hire the same or fewer seasonal workers for the holidays this year than last, while some, like Wal-Mart Stores Inc , have chosen not to hire temporary workers at all."
walmart,2017-10,"Sector observers have attributed this to brick-and-mortar retailers' retreat under pressure from online players including Amazon , and firms themselves say they have simply taken a staggered approach to hiring this year that fills gaps slowly. Macy's said holiday hiring was ""off to a great start""."
walmart,2017-10,"But staffing companies that hire employees for the industry say the problem is deeper and is putting pressure both on the quality of staff retailers can hire and, sooner or later, wages that potential candidates will demand."
walmart,2017-10,"The staffing firms say it may also create a squeeze on retailers as they seek to hire heavily for Halloween, Thanksgiving and Christmas -- the biggest drivers of retailers' annual profits."
walmart,2017-10,"""Where we have a problem hiring is the lower level, the seasonal or entry-level employees,"" said Melissa Hassett, vice president of client delivery for ManpowerGroup Solutions."
walmart,2017-10,"Her clients include Lowe's Cos Inc , Staples and auto parts firm Pep Boys and she says employees are seeking more flexibility with their schedules, training and pay, which is competitive with other entry-level jobs."
walmart,2017-10,"U.S. unemployment levels have hit their lowest in more than 16 years and recruiters say the rise of the ""gig economy"" and new occupations, such as driving for Uber [UBER.UL] or Deliveroo, is shrinking the youth talent pool."
walmart,2017-10,"The hourly mean wage for entry level sales personnel at retailers, including at clothing, sports goods and department stores, was $11.96 as of May 2016, according to the latest data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics."
walmart,2017-10,"In comparison, an Uber driver earns $14.76 per hour, according to data Glassdoor posted on its site earlier this month."
walmart,2017-10,"The job search and review site listed 829,500 retail job openings as of mid-October, compared with 875,000 at the same time a year ago."
walmart,2017-10,"""There just aren't enough people who are looking for work ... to be put in those positions,"" the site's chief economist, Andrew Chamberlain, said."
walmart,2017-10,"The Bureau of Labor Statistics' JOLTS survey on job openings also shows that more people have quit retail by August this year than in the past decade, with 3.74 million giving up their jobs."
walmart,2017-10,"Recruiters say that reflects the growing stresses of working for companies who have cut costs, closed stores and asked staff to adapt and do more."
walmart,2017-10,"""The jobs have become bigger,"" Manpower Group's Hassett said. ""A manager will do more at the stores, they'll even pick up and join a register, help stocking if they need to."""
walmart,2017-10,Wal-Mart said that it has not hired for the holiday-season in part because they are paying existing employees more.
walmart,2017-10,"""We think it just makes sense to partner with the associates who know the business, are trained in serving customers and the operations of the stores, and who know the customer better than anyone,"" said Erica Jones, Wal-Mart's senior manager of corporate communications."

walmart,2017-10,Walmex's net profit of 8.7 billion pesos fell 13.7 percent from the same quarter last year but exceeded expectations of analysts surveyed by Reuters.

walmart,2017-10,"Even as the Sept. 19 earthquake spurred shopping, Walmex said online sales grew at a lower rate than expected due to call center disruptions and a drop in orders in the quake's aftermath."

walmart,2017-10,"Target said it recorded an average of $300 in sales per square foot across its stores, compared with at least $600 in sales per square foot from its small-format stores."

walmart,2017-10,"Carrefour said on Monday that former Fnac Darty chief financial officer Matthieu Malige, 43, would start with immediate effect, replacing Pierre Jean Sivignon, 60, who is stepping down for personal reasons."
walmart,2017-10,"The French company's shares, which plunged in August after it warned 2017 operating profit could fall by as much as 12 percent, were up 1.8 percent in early trading, the top performer on the CAC-40 <.FCHI> index of French blue-chip stocks."
walmart,2017-10,"""Matthieu Malige and Alexandre Bompard successfully turned Fnac around .... We have been impressed by the complementary nature of this team at Fnac, where Matthieu Malige built a strong track record in managing cost-cutting, working capital, and cash,"" wrote analysts at brokerage Raymond James."
walmart,2017-10,"""We believe, just as at Fnac back in 2011, Carrefour needs to make some progress on these three metrics,"" they added."
walmart,2017-10,"The new Carrefour team faces a challenge to improve the performance of its French hypermarkets, a goal that has eluded several predecessors. Carrefour is up against fierce competition in France, which accounts for nearly half of group sales and 44 percent of operating profit, from online and other rivals."
walmart,2017-10,"A union official said last month that Carrefour's options included closing some hypermarkets, turning some into franchises or introducing Sunday opening for others. [nL5N1LZ1KQ]"
walmart,2017-10,"Malige should know the challenges ahead of him, as he worked at Carrefour between 2003 and 2011, holding several positions including finance chief of Belgium and France."
walmart,2017-10,"His appointment comes at a crucial time as Bompard, who joined from music, books and electricals chain Fnac Darty in July, has yet to unveil his turnaround plan."
walmart,2017-10,"""It's a bit of a surprise, but it confirms the idea that Bompard wants a new team around him. Shareholders will want Malige to review the hypermarkets business, which is losing market share, and to accelerate Carrefour's online strategy,"" said Benoit de Broissia, a fund manager at Paris-based Keren Finance, which owns Carrefour shares."
walmart,2017-10,Bompard has already made other management changes as he looks to revive the company's fortunes. [nL5N1M24MK]
walmart,2017-10,"Carrefour said Sivignon, who had been group finance chief since 2011, would stay on as an adviser to Bompard."
walmart,2017-10,"""The lack of a robust and or effective capital allocation framework is one of the big reasons that Carrefour is in its difficult situation today. As a CFO, Mr. Sivignon stood over that capital allocation framework. Therefore a clean start will help convince investors that things might change for the better at Carrefour,"" said Bernstein analyst Bruno Monteyne."
walmart,2017-10,"Carrefour shares have fallen around 24 percent this year, underperforming the STOXX Europe 600 index <.STOXX> and France's benchmark CAC-40 <.FCHI>, which are both up by roughly 10 percent."

walmart,2017-10,"NEW YORK, Oct 10 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Wal-Mart is finally getting into an e-commerce groove. The $250 billion retailer reckons U.S. online sales will jump next year, it said on Tuesday. Acquisitions like Jet.com help, and it's using its 5,000-plus stores well, too."
walmart,2017-10,"The company led by Doug McMillon used its annual investor day to provide more detail about the state of its online ambitions. In the United States, Wal-Mart expects online sales to hit about $11.5 billion for the fiscal year ending January 2018, and then surge 40 percent the year after. That represents less than 4 percent of Wal-Mart's revenue stateside, which came in at $308 billion for Wal-Mart U.S. last year, so there's room for growth."
walmart,2017-10,"Amazon's $13.7 billion acquisition of Whole Foods suggests founder Jeff Bezos wants to crack that nut too. With global grocers' stocks apt to sag at any mention of his name, it's worth noting that the e-commerce giant's North American net sales last year of $80 billion are equivalent to only about a quarter of Wal-Mart's total haul in the United States. Whole Foods adds just $15 billion more."
walmart,2017-10,"Meanwhile, the Bentonville, Arkansas retailer controlled by the Walton family reported year-on-year e-commerce growth in the first half of this year of more than 60 percent. Amazon's equivalent rate was 25 percent. True, Wal-Mart is starting from a smaller base. But investors may be starting to notice. The company's shares were up more than 5 percent on Tuesday afternoon. Even Amazon might want to watch its back."
walmart,2017-10,- Wal-Mart held its investor day on Oct. 10. The largest U.S. retailer said it expects U.S. e-commerce sales to rise 40 percent in the year to January 2019 compared with the current year.
walmart,2017-10,- The company reaffirmed its fiscal 2018 earnings per share guidance of $4.18 to $4.28 per share and said it expects EPS to grow 5 percent in fiscal 2019. It also authorized a $20 billion share repurchasing program.

walmart,2017-10,"But following Sunday's mass shooting in Las Vegas, the shop fielded several calls from customers asking about the product, apparently out of concern that lawmakers may outlaw it. The store's owner, Kellie Weeks, said several distributors were out of stock when she called them seeking supplies."

walmart,2017-10,"The deal comes at time when global retail giants like Amazon.com Inc , Wal-Mart Stores Inc and CostCo are expanding into Canada while online operators are taking away market share from bricks-and-mortar retailers."
walmart,2017-10,"The deal will allow Metro and Jean Coutu to increase product offerings and outlets and navigate some of those risks, said Barry Schwartz, chief investment officer of Baskin Wealth Management in Toronto."
walmart,2017-10,"That offer price values Jean Coutu at 24 times forward earnings, compared with an industry average of 16, according to Thomson Reuters data."
walmart,2017-10,"""There are... significant risks that don't get solved with the Jean Coutu acquisition but clearly they see some synergies and the ability to get returns on their investment,"" Schwartz said. ""It looks like Metro overpaid right now, but these guys aren't dummies."""

He added that Metro needs to find more than C$100 million in synergies to justify the price."
walmart,2017-10,"The companies expect to realize C$75 million in synergies within three years, they said in a statement on Monday."
walmart,2017-10,Metro shares slipped 1.3 percent to C$42.35. They had surged as much as 10.5 percent on Sept. 27 when the talks were announced. Shares of Jean Coutu rose as much as 2.1 percent to touch a more than two-year high at C$24.81 in Toronto on Monday.

The broad humanitarian crisis highlights the extreme difficulty of getting local or federal disaster relief to a remote U.S. island territory with an already fragile infrastructure and deeply indebted government.
walmart,2017-10,"Even those here with money to spend now cannot often access it or find places open and supplied to spend it as stores are shuttered for lack of electric power, diesel for generators, supplies or employees."
walmart,2017-10,"Jimenez's failed trip to Walmart came after chasing groceries at a store near Yabucoa, near where his grandmother lived. He planned to spend the next day in one of the miles-long gas lines that snake from stations onto highways and up exit ramps."
walmart,2017-10,"At the beginning of many lines were stations already out of gas - but motorists still waited, hoping a fuel supply truck would eventually arrive."
walmart,2017-10,"""We wasted gas getting here and going back,"" Jimenez said as he watched police usher dejected customers away from Walmart's entrance. ""The gas lines are ridiculous. Fifty cars is wonderful. Most are 100-plus cars."""
walmart,2017-10,"Another customer turned away from the Walmart, Daniel Santiago, 51, said he had waited in a gas line for 12 hours one day and 14 hours the next. Neither attempt had been successful, so he, his wife and three daughters had walked three miles to the Fajardo shopping complex, where they waited in line for the Econo grocery."
walmart,2017-10,"""We have to do this every day,"" Santiago said. ""Yesterday, we came down walking. The day before that, we walked up a really big hill to try to get a signal to contact our family."" That had not worked either."
walmart,2017-10,Even before the storm hit and knocked out the island's dilapidated electric grid - an outage expected to persist for months - Puerto Rico was suffering through a growing economic crisis that dates back to 2006. The island has an unemployment rate more than twice the U.S. national average and a 45 percent poverty rate.
walmart,2017-10,The island had earlier this year filed the biggest bankruptcy in U.S. municipal history in the face of a $72 billion debt load and near-insolvent public health and pension systems.
walmart,2017-10,"In an interview with Reuters on Saturday, Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello said relief efforts were still focused almost solely on saving lives; restoring basic necessities to the masses would come later."
walmart,2017-10,"""We're not at the phase where we are focusing on comfort,"" Rossello said. ""Unfortunately, that's the current reality that we're dealing with."""
walmart,2017-10,"His team was still scrambling to open roads to communities blocked by landslides, and to deliver food, water, medicines and generators to remote homes and hospitals."
walmart,2017-10,"The island's battered infrastructure left Manny De La Rosa, 31, to crisscross the island with his pregnant wife, Mayra Melendez, also 31. They were trying to find places to spend the $40 in coins they had extracted from the family piggybank."
walmart,2017-10,"""All of our money is held up in the bank,"" De La Rosa said."
walmart,2017-10,"They live in Luquillo in the northeast, but found an ATM in Humacao on the southeastern coast. Their cell phones vibrated to life for the first time alongside a stretch of highway in Isla Verde, nearly an hour west of their home."
walmart,2017-10,"Now, they were in line in Fajardo, hoping to buy supplies with a credit card to conserve their cash."
walmart,2017-10,"""We see these lines, and we think, 'We're not even going to make it before the money runs out,'"" Melendez said, standing in front of the Walmart."
walmart,2017-10,"In the economically depressed agricultural town of Salinas, an hour-and-a-half drive from Fajardo on the island's southern coast, 93-year-old Lucia Santiago sat outside in a lawn chair and rested her swollen legs."
walmart,2017-10,"Her son, Jose Melero, 67, brought her food that had been delivered by the town's mayor on a golf cart."
walmart,2017-10,"""We have to be out here, because we'd die from the heat in there,"" he said, gesturing toward the house."
walmart,2017-10,"The two had started eating less every day to conserve provisions. That day, they had split a can of ravioli and a piece of bread."
walmart,2017-10,Melero was down to $14 of cash without the means to withdraw more.
walmart,2017-10,"""I have no idea how I'm going to get through the next few days,"" he said. ""We have money, but we just can't get to it."""
walmart,2017-10,"Others in isolated areas struggled to find medicine. U.S. Army veteran Sandalio DeJesus Maldonado, 87, took a 7 a.m. ferry from his home on Culebra, an island off Puerto Rico's eastern coast, to Fajardo, to refill blood pressure and prostate medications."
walmart,2017-10,"In Fajardo, DeJesus waited at an overcrowded Walgreens because he did not have enough gas to drive to the Veterans Affairs hospital where he normally filled his prescriptions."
walmart,2017-10,"As he waited in line late Saturday morning, DeJesus fretted that he would not be able to return to Culebra until after 5 p.m., when the only scheduled ferry was slated to depart."
