Sinopec Group,2017-6,"BEIJING/SINGAPORE, July 11 (Reuters) - China has opened more than 6,000 trading accounts for its long-awaited crude futures contract - with three-quarters coming from individual traders - as it pushes ahead with plans to compete with global pricing benchmarks."
Sinopec Group,2017-6,"China's oil majors and about 150 brokerages have also registered, but the strong interest by 'mom-and-pop' investors looks set to mark out China's crude futures from western counterparts, which are dominated by institutional investors."
Sinopec Group,2017-6,"Shanghai International Energy Exchange (INE), which will run China's contract, says it is finalising technical issues. The contract has faced years of delays and there is still no set date, but INE and also trading participants now say a launch this year is almost certain. [nL4N1IE3AJ][nL3N1HF3RR]"
Sinopec Group,2017-6,"""The INE is striving to launch the crude oil futures within this year,"" a spokeswoman said, adding that the exchange has conducted four trials to ensure it is technically ready."
Sinopec Group,2017-6,Oil futures trading volume is small during Asian hours despite the region's role as the world's top consumer. [nL8N1JO05K]
Sinopec Group,2017-6,Shanghai's crude futures are aimed at giving China more clout in pricing crude in Asia and a share of the trillions of dollars in oil futures trade.
Sinopec Group,2017-6,"The INE hopes to attract foreign investors, and locally registered entities of JPMorgan and UBS are among those registered, although international players have raised concerns, including denomination in yuan, that may dampen early take-up."
Sinopec Group,2017-6,"Most oil trades are priced off two crude derivatives, U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) and London's Brent, traded on the Intercontinental Exchange and the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) owned by CME Group ."
Sinopec Group,2017-6,Earlier attempts to establish an Asian derivative crude contract by Singapore and Tokyo foundered. The only liquid crude futures in the region is the Oman contract on the Dubai Mercantile Exchange.
Sinopec Group,2017-6,Successful crude derivatives would be the jewel in the crown in China's push to ramp up futures trading on products from dates to steel to open up markets and offer new avenues for investors. [nL1N1JD07H]
Sinopec Group,2017-6,"While Chinese banks are barred from futures trading, the new market is expected to attract interest from deep-pocketed private equity firms and funds, while state-owned oil majors, like PetroChina <601857.SS> and Sinopec <600028.SS> will provide liquidity."
Sinopec Group,2017-6,"PetroChina is set to register two accounts and Sinopec is setting up a trading outfit in Shanghai dedicated to the contract, said senior company sources."
Sinopec Group,2017-6,"Independent refiners like Shandong Chambroad Group have also joined, while retail interest is strong."
Sinopec Group,2017-6,"Individuals already account for 80 percent of turnover on China's $8 trillion equity markets, and day traders have whipsawed commodities from eggs to iron ore in China over the past year."
Sinopec Group,2017-6,"Jin Changyi, a 40-year-old former hotel owner from eastern China, who began dabbling in Brent crude oil futures last year, has opened a 500,000-yuan ($75,000) account with a Shanghai-based brokerage and plans to act as a mini-broker for friends."
Sinopec Group,2017-6,"""The way it's designed it won't fluctuate wildly. Compared to trading Brent, the risks are more manageable,"" he told Reuters."
Sinopec Group,2017-6,"Executives at international banks and traders who have reviewed the contract rules and specifications warn of concerns including Beijing's clamp-down on capital outflows, unusually small price limits and China's heavy handed intervention in commodity markets last year. [nL5N1F90E1]"
Sinopec Group,2017-6,"""Everybody is staring at everybody else,"" said an official with a western investment bank who declined to be named due to company policy."
Sinopec Group,2017-6,"Reflecting a regulatory aim to stave off price volatility, the Shanghai contract has a 4 percent daily price fluctuation limit, half the limit for Chinese coking coal."
Sinopec Group,2017-6,"China's crude futures also do not have a mechanism to reset limits after a big price move, which means Shanghai trading could freeze while prices still move elsewhere. For WTI, for example, a $10 a barrel move activates circuit breakers to pause trade briefly until a new limit of another $10 is set."
Sinopec Group,2017-6,Industry players also worry about delays in issuing rules over storage and grades for deliveries.
Sinopec Group,2017-6,"The INE has yet to finalize details of warehouse tanks, including locations, rules over fuel blending and price differentials between grades, all key for helping industry participants decide on whether or not to take deliveries."
Sinopec Group,2017-6,"The INE spokeswoman said it is working on approved crude oil delivery points, which are located in the peninsulas of Liaodong and Shandong, Yangtze River Delta and Pearl River Delta."
Sinopec Group,2017-6,"""The contract will initially track Brent and WTI markets,"" said a derivatives trading manager with a Chinese state oil company, who declined to be named because he is not authorised to speak to media."
Sinopec Group,2017-6,"""It won't be an immediate success, but we're hopeful."""

Sinopec Group,2017-6,"The current round of quotas is 49 percent higher than last year's batch, which were all issued under the processing category, of 6.085 million tonnes. The new quotas increased the total number of processing permits to 24.76 million tonnes granted so far in 2017. [nL4N19Q1Y5]"
Sinopec Group,2017-6,"The quotas will be valid till the end of this year and were assigned to China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC), Sinopec Corp, China National Offshore Oil Corp (CNOOC) and Sinochem Group, the sources said."
Sinopec Group,2017-6,"The government issued 6.29 million tonnes of exports under the separate general trade category in May, taking the total under that scheme to 7.605 million tonnes for the year. [nL4N1IP20F]"
Sinopec Group,2017-6,"Combined by category, China has granted 32.365 million tonnes of fuel export quotas this year, and all to the same four state oil companies."
Sinopec Group,2017-6,"The third round of export quotas rose to accommodate a growing surplus of refined fuel as overall Chinese refinery throughput is set to increase even with possible run cuts by Sinopec, as peak maintenance season ends and new capacity additions are expected later this year, said oil analyst Nevyn Nah of consultancy Energy Aspects."

Sinopec Group,2017-6,China earlier this year barred the country's independent oil plants from exporting fuel.
Sinopec Group,2017-6,"Under the general trade category, refiners get tax refunds after exports are completed or get a tax waiver on fuel exports, a policy that Beijing granted in 2016."
Sinopec Group,2017-6,"Under the processing rules, refiners are exempted from import taxes on crude oil and export taxes for oil products, but have fixed volumes and time slots to export, both under the tight scrutiny of Chinese customs."
