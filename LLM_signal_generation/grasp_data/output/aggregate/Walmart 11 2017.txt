walmart,2017-11,"Nov 27 (Reuters) - Cyber Monday was on track to become the biggest-ever internet shopping day in the United States as people snapped up bargains on toys and electronics, with many more buying from their phones."

walmart,2017-11,"CHICAGO, Nov 28 (Reuters) - More than 174 million U.S. shoppers made purchases over Thanksgiving weekend and Cyber Monday, the National Retail Federation said on Tuesday, beating the industry group's expectations and signaling a strong start to the holiday quarter."
walmart,2017-11,"The NRF, which had estimated about 164 million shoppers, attributed the even stronger turnout to better technology and discounting, low unemployment, rising consumer confidence and good weather across the country."
walmart,2017-11,"""The climate was right, literally and figuratively, for consumers to tackle their holiday shopping lists online and in stores,"" NRF Chief Executive Matthew Shay said on a media call."
walmart,2017-11,The holiday season can represent 20 to 40 percent of annual sales for many retailers.
walmart,2017-11,"The long weekend had set retailers up for a strong finish to the year, Shay said, but they would need to keep inventory tight to deliver similar or deeper discounts that the vast majority of consumers are expecting for the rest of the holidays."
walmart,2017-11,"Shoppers on average spent $335.47 over the five-day period, with older millennials spending the most at $419.52 each, according to the NRF survey of 3,242 consumers on Nov. 25-26."
walmart,2017-11,The figures are not comparable to the average 2016 Thanksgiving weekend spending of $300 because the methodology had changed and the year-ago survey excluded Cyber Monday.
walmart,2017-11,"Online shopping rose sharply this year, with Cyber Monday becoming the largest online sales day in history at $6.6 billion, according to retail analysts and consultants. Sales on Thanksgiving and Black Friday also topped prior years and e-commerce leader Amazon.com Inc said it broke sales records this weekend. [nL1N1NX1HG]"
walmart,2017-11,"Preempting a decline in visits to brick-and-mortar stores, many traditional retailers have invested heavily in their websites, bulking up delivery options, and tightening store inventories to ward off any post-holiday liquidation that would weigh on profits."
walmart,2017-11,"The NRF said retailers' investments in technology had paid off, noting that internet-only shoppers totaled more than 58 million during the 5-day period, over 64 million shopped both online and in stores, and about 51 million spent only in brick-and-mortar stores."
walmart,2017-11,Retail research firm ShopperTrak said on Saturday that store traffic fell 1.6 percent on Thanksgiving and Black Friday compared to last year.
walmart,2017-11,"""The early parts of both days were busy but ongoing store traffic wasn't stellar, and it wasn't consistent from store to store, or mall to mall,"" NPD Group's chief retail analyst Marshal Cohen said, noting that the holiday season had just begun."

walmart,2017-11,"Nov 27 (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc is within striking distance of matching Amazon.com Inc's online prices for the first time, a key milestone in its effort to regain the ""low price leader"" title."
walmart,2017-11,Wal-Mart has aggressively invested in making its prices more competitive against brick-and-mortar rivals since the start of the year.
walmart,2017-11,"Now, the shrinking gap is also becoming noticeable across a broad range of product categories online, according to a price study conducted for Reuters, as well as interviews with pricing experts, retail consultants, vendors and company sources."
walmart,2017-11,"Prices at Walmart.com are now only 0.3 percent more expensive than Amazon on average, according to the study by retail data analytics firm Market Track, which analyzed prices of 213 products in 11 categories over a period of 700 days ending November 7, 2017."
walmart,2017-11,"By comparison, Wal-Mart's online prices were 3 percent higher than Amazon's on average in the first 350 days ending November 7, 2016, according to the study."
walmart,2017-11,"In the popular wearables category, which includes fitness trackers and smart watches, Wal-Mart's prices are 6.4 percent lower than Amazon this year compared to 12.6 percent higher in the same period a year ago. For sports and outdoor products, Wal-Mart is now 1.3 percent lower versus 3.5 percent higher a year ago."
walmart,2017-11,"These findings indicate that Wal-Mart has managed to slash prices online across several product categories consistently, rather than with just temporary discounts."
walmart,2017-11,"Consistent lower pricing is key to boosting sales throughout the year. On Cyber Monday, the busiest day of the year for internet shopping, online deals and temporary promotions will overshadow pricing for both retail giants."
walmart,2017-11,"""We are committed to having online prices that meet or beat prices at other top sites,"" said Wal-Mart spokesman Dan Toporek. He said for some items the retailer now displays two prices online to show shoppers when they can get a lower price by picking up their order in a store, but declined to comment further on the company's pricing strategy."
walmart,2017-11,Amazon spokeswoman Kate Scarpa said nothing has changed in the retailer's approach to delivering low prices to customers.
walmart,2017-11,"""Amazon's prices are as low or lower than any other retailer and we work hard for customers to ensure that's true every day,"" she said, declining to comment further on the retailer's pricing strategy."
walmart,2017-11,"The consistent price cuts are one of several steps Wal-Mart is taking to boost its e-commerce business, including expanding its online offerings, acquiring smaller online retailers such as Jet.com, and offering free-two day shipping."
walmart,2017-11,"Burt Flickinger, managing director of retail consultancy Strategic Resources Group, conducted his own internal pricing study for clients in Texas last month. His data shows Wal-Mart is closing the gap with Amazon this year compared with a year ago when prices for a range of goods were between 5-12 percent higher at Wal-Mart."
walmart,2017-11,"""What we have started seeing recently is Wal-Mart lowering the gap with Amazon to a point where it is a photo finish,"" said Flickinger. ""Consumers can't tell the difference anymore."""
walmart,2017-11,"Wal-Mart invested over a $1 billion last year to make its pricing more competitive, taking a hit on profits in order to offer lower prices online, analysts said."
walmart,2017-11,"So far the strategy is paying off. Online sales at the world's largest retailer grew 50 percent year-over-year in the most recent quarter, helping it post its strongest quarterly U.S. revenue growth in nearly a decade. It now accounts for 3.6 percent of total U.S. online sales in the 12 months to October 2017, up from a 2.8 percent share a year ago, according to digital research firm eMarketer."
walmart,2017-11,"Even with this progress, Wal-Mart has a long way to go. Amazon's share of the U.S. e-commerce market stands at 43.5 percent. About half of U.S. households are estimated to have Amazon Prime subscriptions, Cowen and Co has predicted, making them less likely to comparison-shop."
walmart,2017-11,"But Wal-Mart is also vying for the online business of other brick-and-mortar rivals, from Target Corp to WayFair Inc , which have been targeting shoppers who compare prices on search engine such as Google. Wal-Mart could gain more market share at their expense through its price cuts, analysts say."
walmart,2017-11,"""Wal-Mart's objective here may not be to unseat Amazon as much as it is to convince (Wal-Mart's) loyal store shoppers it is also a low-price leader online,"" said Keith Anderson, senior vice-president of strategy and insights at e-commerce analytics firm Profitero."
walmart,2017-11,Analysts and consultants estimate the retailer will have to fork out around $6 billion over several years to maintain price parity with Amazon online and take on the rest of the retail pack.
walmart,2017-11,These investments have already started to erode Wal-Mart's profitability. Operating margins fell for four straight quarters to 2.8 percent in the three months to Oct. 31.
walmart,2017-11,"However, Wal-Mart has a $6.9 billion cash pile to tap in order to invest in online prices. Investors have so far shown no concern that the cost of online price cuts could weigh on Wal-Mart's announced $20 billion share buyback program; the company's shares are up 1.5 percent since it reported stronger online sales on Nov 16."
walmart,2017-11,"What is more, the retailer said last year and again this October that it would slow down the rollout of new stores and divert that capital expenditure towards becoming more competitive online."

walmart,2017-11,"NEW YORK, Nov 17 (Reuters) - Just in time for the Black Friday kick-off to holiday season shopping, stock market investors have been handed tools to bet on the decline of brick-and-mortar retail."
walmart,2017-11,"As of Friday, these tools were not yet for sale on Amazon."
walmart,2017-11,An exchange-traded fund launched Thursday allows investors to bet on the decline of traditional retail and a second one doubles down by betting at the same time on the rise to supremacy of online sales.
walmart,2017-11,"The Decline of Retail Stores ETF and the Long Online Short Stores ETF are self-explanatory. The main index they track inversely, the equal-weighted Solactive-ProShares Bricks and Mortar Retail Store Index <.SOEMTYPR>, is composed of 64 retailers including Barnes & Noble , Sears , Office Depot , Macy's and Walmart , which have chains of physical stores as well as online presence."
walmart,2017-11,"They are not the only or the first planning for a decimation of the retail sector at the hands of Amazon and other online retailers. Research firm Bespoke introduced its Death by Amazon Index, currently with 54 components, in 2012."
walmart,2017-11,"The trend to online shopping is not new, but with online taking only a fraction of all retail sales, the ETFs expect to capitalize on the long-term trend."
walmart,2017-11,"""Online penetration is about 10 percent right now so there is a long way ahead for the strategy in our opinion,"" said Michael Sapir, CEO of ProShare Advisors in Bethesda, Maryland."
walmart,2017-11,"""A minority of brick and mortar (retailers) will be able to make the transition and it is going to be expensive and painful."""
walmart,2017-11,"So far this year, the S&P 500 retail index <.SPXRT> is up 20 percent but only half of its 29 components have had a positive price return. Amazon , up over 50 percent this year at $1,129.88, has alone added $192 billion in market capitalization in 2017. The full index has gained roughly $230 billion."
walmart,2017-11,"Glen Kacher, whose Light Street Capital Management hedge fund was up 53 percent from January to October, said he is ""shorting almost every retailer,"" betting their share prices will fall."
walmart,2017-11,"Kacher said many big retailers have failed to adapt to changing customer preferences, lagging even some corner delis that now use technology that lets people buy their breakfast sandwiches and coffee in seconds with the tap of a finger."
walmart,2017-11,"""The retailing industry is going to be an apocalypse,"" he said, without identifying which retailers will go down in flames. ""Anyone working in the consumer retailing industry ... should be training for a new job."""
walmart,2017-11,"Reports of the death of brick and mortar retail could be mildly exaggerated, however."
walmart,2017-11,"Retail and food service sales in the United States during the first three quarters of 2017 totaled $4.78 trillion, with the $484.4 billion in September a monthly record high, according to U.S. government data."
walmart,2017-11,"About 164 million Americans plan to shop in the coming Thanksgiving weekend, including on Black Friday and Cyber Monday, according to the National Retail Federation."
walmart,2017-11,"Results from this week show the battle for consumers is far from lost at physical stores. Walmart, for instance, said third-quarter U.S. sales growth online and in-store was the strongest since 2009. [nL1N1NM0OQ]"
walmart,2017-11,A combination of online presence and easy access for consumers known as 'click and mortar' will allow some names to survive by letting their customers browse all their options online while offering the convenience of a quick pickup of the product on their drive home.
walmart,2017-11,"Shares of Walmart touched a record high on Friday, as did those of Home Depot , which earlier in the week raised its full-year profit and sales forecasts. [nL3N1NK4H3]"
walmart,2017-11,"They are one of two kinds of retailers that analysts said would be better able to weather the online retail storm. Size will matter, and with more than 5,000 U.S. stores at Walmart and over 2,200 Home Depots in North America, their distribution network will be a key lifeline."
walmart,2017-11,"""Walmart is transforming itself into a major competitor of Amazon,"" said Chad Morganlander, portfolio manager at Washington Crossing Advisors in Florham Park, New Jersey."
walmart,2017-11,"""Our belief is there will be some winners on brick and many online retailers will start looking more traditional."""
walmart,2017-11,"The other retailers seen surviving are those in search of a small niche that will allow them to keep margins growing, countering the trend of ever-smaller margins online."
walmart,2017-11,"""Unless you know exactly what you're going to order and it is mass market, you don't go to Amazon,"" said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh."

walmart,2017-11,"NEW YORK, Nov 17 (Reuters) - Just in time for the Black Friday kick-off to holiday season shopping, stock market investors have been handed tools to bet on the decline of brick-and-mortar retail."
walmart,2017-11,"As of Friday, these tools were not yet for sale on Amazon."
walmart,2017-11,An exchange-traded fund launched Thursday allows investors to bet on the decline of traditional retail and a second one doubles down by betting at the same time on the rise to supremacy of online sales.
walmart,2017-11,"The Decline of Retail Stores ETF and the Long Online Short Stores ETF are self-explanatory. The main index they track inversely, the equal-weighted Solactive-ProShares Bricks and Mortar Retail Store Index <.SOEMTYPR>, is composed of 64 retailers including Barnes & Noble , Sears , Office Depot , Macy's and Walmart , which have chains of physical stores as well as online presence."
walmart,2017-11,"They are not the only or the first planning for a decimation of the retail sector at the hands of Amazon and other online retailers. Research firm Bespoke introduced its Death by Amazon Index, currently with 54 components, in 2012."
walmart,2017-11,"The trend to online shopping is not new, but with online taking only a fraction of all retail sales, the ETFs expect to capitalize on the long-term trend."
walmart,2017-11,"""Online penetration is about 10 percent right now so there is a long way ahead for the strategy in our opinion,"" said Michael Sapir, CEO of ProShare Advisors in Bethesda, Maryland."
walmart,2017-11,"""A minority of brick and mortar (retailers) will be able to make the transition and it is going to be expensive and painful."""
walmart,2017-11,"So far this year, the S&P 500 retail index <.SPXRT> is up 20 percent but only half of its 29 components have had a positive price return. Amazon , up over 50 percent this year at $1,129.88, has alone added $192 billion in market capitalization in 2017. The full index has gained roughly $230 billion."
walmart,2017-11,"Glen Kacher, whose Light Street Capital Management hedge fund was up 53 percent from January to October, said he is ""shorting almost every retailer,"" betting their share prices will fall."
walmart,2017-11,"Kacher said many big retailers have failed to adapt to changing customer preferences, lagging even some corner delis that now use technology that lets people buy their breakfast sandwiches and coffee in seconds with the tap of a finger."
walmart,2017-11,"""The retailing industry is going to be an apocalypse,"" he said, without identifying which retailers will go down in flames. ""Anyone working in the consumer retailing industry ... should be training for a new job."""
walmart,2017-11,"Reports of the death of brick and mortar retail could be mildly exaggerated, however."
walmart,2017-11,"Retail and food service sales in the United States during the first three quarters of 2017 totaled $4.78 trillion, with the $484.4 billion in September a monthly record high, according to U.S. government data."
walmart,2017-11,"About 164 million Americans plan to shop in the coming Thanksgiving weekend, including on Black Friday and Cyber Monday, according to the National Retail Federation."
walmart,2017-11,"Results from this week show the battle for consumers is far from lost at physical stores. Walmart, for instance, said third-quarter U.S. sales growth online and in-store was the strongest since 2009. [nL1N1NM0OQ]"
walmart,2017-11,A combination of online presence and easy access for consumers known as 'click and mortar' will allow some names to survive by letting their customers browse all their options online while offering the convenience of a quick pickup of the product on their drive home.
walmart,2017-11,"Shares of Walmart touched a record high on Friday, as did those of Home Depot , which earlier in the week raised its full-year profit and sales forecasts. [nL3N1NK4H3]"
walmart,2017-11,"They are one of two kinds of retailers that analysts said would be better able to weather the online retail storm. Size will matter, and with more than 5,000 U.S. stores at Walmart and over 2,200 Home Depots in North America, their distribution network will be a key lifeline."
walmart,2017-11,"""Walmart is transforming itself into a major competitor of Amazon,"" said Chad Morganlander, portfolio manager at Washington Crossing Advisors in Florham Park, New Jersey."
walmart,2017-11,"""Our belief is there will be some winners on brick and many online retailers will start looking more traditional."""
walmart,2017-11,"The other retailers seen surviving are those in search of a small niche that will allow them to keep margins growing, countering the trend of ever-smaller margins online."
walmart,2017-11,"""Unless you know exactly what you're going to order and it is mass market, you don't go to Amazon,"" said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh."
walmart,2017-11,"""Holiday shopping means meaningful gifts. If you're a good retailer you can take advantage of that."""

walmart,2017-11,"{{20171117T213813.904+0000}}UPDATE 4-J.B. Hunt, Wal-Mart climb aboard Tesla's electric truck(Recasts throughout, adds context on regulatory pressure to cut diesel pollution)"
walmart,2017-11,"Nov 17 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc on Friday got high-profile orders from Wal-Mart Stores Inc and fleet operator J.B. Hunt for its future electric truck, but would-be customers indicated they are giving the big rig a try, not buying in volume."
walmart,2017-11,"Most of the customers who announced plans to put down $5,000 deposits for the Tesla Semi indicated they wanted to test a few of the vehicles. Wal-Mart said it plans to order a total of 15 Tesla trucks, five for the United States and ten for Canada. The company operates a fleet of about 6,000 trucks in the United States."
walmart,2017-11,"JB Hunt Transport Inc was the first major U.S. trucking company to announce an order for Tesla's new ""Semi"" electric trucks, saying it had reserved multiple vehicles for use on the U.S. West Coast. [nBw11VJ7Xa]"
walmart,2017-11,Hunt did not say how many of the vehicles it would reserve. Tesla unveiled the Semi on Thursday without specifying prices.[nL1N1NM1N4]
walmart,2017-11,"The early orders reflected the uncertainty about how the market for electric commercial vehicles will develop. About 260,000 Class-8 trucks are produced in North America annually, and that market has a value of about $28.6 billion, said Don Ake, vice president of commercial vehicles at FTR, an industry economics research firm."
walmart,2017-11,"The 500-mile (800 km) range between charges that Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk promised on Thursday for the Tesla Semi is about half the range between fill-ups of a diesel Class 8 truck. Heavy batteries cut payload and add cost, potential deal killers for fleet buyers focused on operating cost per mile. [nL1N1NM1N4]"
walmart,2017-11,"However, Tesla, and incumbent truck makers such as Daimler AG , Navistar International Corp and its partner Volkswagen AG are investing in electric trucks in a bet that the market will shift over the next decade."
walmart,2017-11,"For global truck makers, the biggest market for electric trucks will likely be China, where the government is moving aggressively to convert the transportation system to electrified vehicles."
walmart,2017-11,"Regulators around the world are ratcheting up pressure on the trucking industry to slash emissions of soot and carbon dioxide from diesel trucks. In the United States, the government has estimated that heavy-duty trucks represent 4 percent of vehicles on the road but account for 20 percent of carbon emissions. Under President Barack Obama, the United States required truck makers to boost fuel efficiency through 2027."
walmart,2017-11,"Separately, some cities and ports are discussing banning or heavily taxing diesel vehicles. The Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach in Southern California have a goal of only having zero-emissions trucks by 2035. California is committing $140 million to subsidize low-carbon freight transportation."
walmart,2017-11,"Tesla has been trying to convince the trucking community that it can build an affordable electric big rig with the range and capacity to compete with relatively low-cost, time-tested diesel trucks."
walmart,2017-11,"It was not clear how many orders for Semis Tesla had in hand. Among companies announcing plans to acquire small numbers of Tesla trucks were Michigan retailer Meijer Inc [MEIJR.UL] and Canadian retail chain Loblaw , which has said it wants an entirely electric corporate vehicle fleet by 2030. [nL1N1NN1LM]"
walmart,2017-11,Some big logistics companies stayed on the sidelines. United Parcel Service Inc said the courier had nothing to announce regarding Tesla's vehicles but would always look for options that fit its needs.
walmart,2017-11,"Brad Pinchuk, chief executive of Dubuque, Iowa-based Hirschbach Motor Lines, said his firm was looking to test non-diesel big-rig options but needed longer ranges than Tesla could provide and speedier fuel-up times."
walmart,2017-11,Pinchuk said he plans to buy two hydrogen-powered trucks made by Salt Lake City-based electric Nikola Motor Company when they are available in 2020.

walmart,2017-11,"NEW YORK, Nov 17 (Reuters) - Retail, utilities, restaurants and financial services should all brace for more disruption in the year ahead, according to big-name investors who took part in the Reuters Global Investment 2018 Outlook Summit in New York this week."
walmart,2017-11,"Glen Kacher, whose Light Street Capital hedge fund is one of the best-performing funds for the year to date, said he was shorting most of the retail sector out of concerns that bricks and mortar stores will continue to lose market share as customers shift purchasing to Amazon.com Inc , which is among his top holdings."
walmart,2017-11,"At the same time, large companies such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc are using point of sale technology that processes debit and credit card transactions at slower speeds than coffee shops that use readers from payments company Square Inc , he said."
walmart,2017-11,"""The idea that the deli has better technology than Wal-Mart is stunning,"" he said, adding that the coming year will prove to be an ""apocalypse"" for the sector."
walmart,2017-11,"The SPDR S&P Retail ETF , which tracks companies such as Tailored Brands Inc and Urban Outfitters Inc , is down 5.5 percent for the year to date."
walmart,2017-11,"Not all disruption looks to be a negative for entrenched companies, however."
walmart,2017-11,"Marc Lasry, the billionaire co-founder of Avenue Capital Group, said that his firm is raising $1 billion for a new hedge fund focusing on distressed debt in the utility industry, which is facing increased demand for energy just as new regulations make it increasingly difficult to build new power plants."
walmart,2017-11,"Avenue Capital has invested in Texas-based electric company Dynegy Inc and bought a power plant in California, Lasry said, citing low prices."
walmart,2017-11,"Kera Van Valen, a portfolio manager at $48.6 billion Epoch Investment Partners, said improvements in meter technology is helping utility holdings such as PPL Corp cut its margins by allowing the company to be more efficient in its response to storms or outages."
walmart,2017-11,"Along the same lines, McDonald's Corp is expanding its self-ordering kiosks and digital app to all of its 14,000 U.S. locations, allowing employees to concentrate more on other areas of the restaurant, as well as partnering with UberEats, the food-delivery service run by ride-hailing firm Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL]."
walmart,2017-11,"""When you think about the Millennials and the tendencies that Millennials have, ordering from a kiosk is quite comfortable for them. It also makes McDonald's feel a little more relevant,"" Van Valen said, which should boost the company's growth and its ability to increase its dividends."
walmart,2017-11,"Other disruptions may boost productivity across a sector. Joachim Fels, global economic adviser and a managing director at Pimco, which has more than $1.69 trillion in assets under management, said that blockchain - a shared ledger of transactions maintained by a network of computers on the internet that powers the cyptocurrency bitcoin - could be a disruptive factor for financial services."

walmart,2017-11,"(Recasts throughout, adds context on regulatory pressure to cut diesel pollution)"
walmart,2017-11,"Nov 17 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc on Friday got high-profile orders from Wal-Mart Stores Inc and fleet operator J.B. Hunt for its future electric truck, but would-be customers indicated they are giving the big rig a try, not buying in volume."
walmart,2017-11,"Most of the customers who announced plans to put down $5,000 deposits for the Tesla Semi indicated they wanted to test a few of the vehicles. Wal-Mart said it plans to order a total of 15 Tesla trucks, five for the United States and ten for Canada. The company operates a fleet of about 6,000 trucks in the United States."
walmart,2017-11,"JB Hunt Transport Inc was the first major U.S. trucking company to announce an order for Tesla's new ""Semi"" electric trucks, saying it had reserved multiple vehicles for use on the U.S. West Coast. [nBw11VJ7Xa]"
walmart,2017-11,Hunt did not say how many of the vehicles it would reserve. Tesla unveiled the Semi on Thursday without specifying prices.[nL1N1NM1N4]
walmart,2017-11,"The early orders reflected the uncertainty about how the market for electric commercial vehicles will develop. About 260,000 Class-8 trucks are produced in North America annually, and that market has a value of about $28.6 billion, said Don Ake, vice president of commercial vehicles at FTR, an industry economics research firm."
walmart,2017-11,"The 500-mile (800 km) range between charges that Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk promised on Thursday for the Tesla Semi is about half the range between fill-ups of a diesel Class 8 truck. Heavy batteries cut payload and add cost, potential deal killers for fleet buyers focused on operating cost per mile. [nL1N1NM1N4]"
walmart,2017-11,"However, Tesla, and incumbent truck makers such as Daimler AG , Navistar International Corp and its partner Volkswagen AG are investing in electric trucks in a bet that the market will shift over the next decade."
walmart,2017-11,"For global truck makers, the biggest market for electric trucks will likely be China, where the government is moving aggressively to convert the transportation system to electrified vehicles."
walmart,2017-11,"Regulators around the world are ratcheting up pressure on the trucking industry to slash emissions of soot and carbon dioxide from diesel trucks. In the United States, the government has estimated that heavy-duty trucks represent 4 percent of vehicles on the road but account for 20 percent of carbon emissions. Under President Barack Obama, the United States required truck makers to boost fuel efficiency through 2027."
walmart,2017-11,"Separately, some cities and ports are discussing banning or heavily taxing diesel vehicles. The Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach in Southern California have a goal of only having zero-emissions trucks by 2035. California is committing $140 million to subsidize low-carbon freight transportation."
walmart,2017-11,"Tesla has been trying to convince the trucking community that it can build an affordable electric big rig with the range and capacity to compete with relatively low-cost, time-tested diesel trucks."
walmart,2017-11,"It was not clear how many orders for Semis Tesla had in hand. Among companies announcing plans to acquire small numbers of Tesla trucks were Michigan retailer Meijer Inc [MEIJR.UL] and Canadian retail chain Loblaw , which has said it wants an entirely electric corporate vehicle fleet by 2030. [nL1N1NN1LM]"

walmart,2017-11,"LONDON, Nov 16 (Reuters) - Sales growth at Asda, the British supermarket arm of Walmart , the world's largest retailer, slowed in its latest quarter, showing the tough task facing its new boss to rev-up its recovery in a cut-throat market."
walmart,2017-11,"Last month, Asda said Chief Executive Sean Clarke, a Walmart veteran of 21 years, would step down in January after just 18 months in the job and be replaced by head of operations Roger Burnley, a former Sainsbury's executive. [nL8N1N55E3]"
walmart,2017-11,"Asda and its major rivals -- market leader Tesco , Sainsbury's and Morrisons -- are all grappling with the rapid growth of German discounters Aldi and Lidl."
walmart,2017-11,"They are also having to cope with more expensive food imports due to a weaker pound since Britain voted to leave the European Union, while consumer spending is under pressure from rising inflation, subdued wage growth and economic uncertainty."
walmart,2017-11,Of Britain's major players analysts reckon Asda was hurt the most by the rise of the discounters as its traditional price advantage was eroded.
walmart,2017-11,Walmart said in February it was too slow in starting the repositioning of Asda and had not focused enough on using its leverage as a parent so that its British arm could be more aggressive on price cuts. [nL5N1FS4I4]

walmart,2017-11,Asda's comparative numbers were extremely weak - in the same quarter last year like-for-like sales slumped 5.8 percent. Also Asda would have benefited from food price inflation across the industry - running at 3.4 percent according to the latest industry data. [nL8N1NK3BC]
walmart,2017-11,"That data, published on Tuesday, also showed Asda recorded the lowest rate of sales growth of the big four in the 12 weeks to Nov.5."
walmart,2017-11,"Shares in Tesco, Sainsbury's and Morrisons were up 0.3, 1.1 and 1.6 percent respectively."

The $268 billion retailer increased its third-quarter revenue as more people visited its stores. Online, the firm kicked out impressive growth and even grocery sales improved. The Bentonville, Arkansas giant is worth keeping an eye on in Seattle."

walmart,2017-11,Nov 15 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc said on Wednesday it will offer more discounts and steeper price cuts at Whole Foods Market on many organic foods and groceries popular during the holidays.
walmart,2017-11,The plan was announced just ahead of Thanksgiving and is on the heels of price cuts in August when Amazon completed its $13.7 billion acquisition of Whole Foods. [nL2N1LE12C]
walmart,2017-11,"""Price cuts are permanent,"" Brooke Buchanan, a spokeswoman for Whole Foods, told Reuters in an email."
walmart,2017-11,"Investors have been closely watching for price cuts at Whole Foods, concerned that cheaper prices would further hurt U.S. grocers already struggling to stay competitive with Amazon and Wal-Mart Stores Inc , which are locked in an intense battle for market share."
walmart,2017-11,"""Ever since Amazon bought Whole Foods Market, this is exactly what the other grocery store competitors have been fearing,"" Fort Pitt Capital analyst Kim Forrest told Reuters."
walmart,2017-11,"Shares of rival U.S. grocers Costco , Sprouts Farmers Market and Kroger all fell on Wednesday morning between 1 percent to 2 percent after the news. Target Corp's stock also moved lower. The shares were already pressured after the company forecasted disappointing earnings for the key holiday quarter. [nL3N1NL45J]"
walmart,2017-11,"Amazon, which forayed into brick-and-mortar retailing with Whole Foods, could upend the grocery industry with its deep pockets and large presence, analysts have said."
walmart,2017-11,"Prices at Whole Foods, however, are still higher than most grocery stores because it caters to an up-market clientele."
walmart,2017-11,"""As we saw with Sprouts Farmer and really other grocery reports, the prior cuts haven't had a material impact on leading players,"" said Oppenheimer analyst Rupesh Parikh."

walmart,2017-11,"Nov 15 (Reuters) - Target Corp's holiday-quarter profit forecast fell short of analyst expectations, sending its shares down 10 percent on Wednesday as hopes faded that the retailer would make a shopping season comeback."
walmart,2017-11,"Target has missed Wall Street's fourth-quarter profit expectations for the past two years. It is gearing up for the holidays by cutting prices and introducing delivery options to compete with Wal-Mart Stores Inc and online sellers, moves that can lure customers but crimp margins."
walmart,2017-11,"""It was always unrealistic that Target was going to have a great holiday season in terms of sales or profitability,"" said Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail, noting pressured margins were already expected based on company guidance."
walmart,2017-11,"""This is still a very competitive environment, and Target has no choice but to respond to that.. the problem is that Wall Street don't necessarily understand this,"" he added."
walmart,2017-11,"The big-box chain forecast adjusted earnings of $1.05 to $1.25 per share for the fourth quarter, a range largely below the average analyst estimate of $1.24. It expects same-store sales in the quarter in a range of flat to 2 percent higher."
walmart,2017-11,The holiday season can represent 20 percent to 40 percent of annual sales for many retailers.
walmart,2017-11,"In October, Target said most of its holiday gifts would cost less than $15 and that it would offer customers free shipping beginning in November."
walmart,2017-11,"It also has hired 100,000 temporary holiday workers, up from 70,000 in each of the prior four years, and raised its minimum hourly wage this year by 10 percent."
walmart,2017-11,Target shares have lost about 17 percent since the start of the year and were down 9.2 percent at $54.59 in midday trading.
walmart,2017-11,"Target's third-quarter gross margin slipped to 29.7 percent from 29.8 percent, and Chief Financial Officer Cathy Smith said margin pressure should continue into the holiday quarter."
walmart,2017-11,"Target will try to grab more of the lucrative holiday toy market, following the September bankruptcy and ongoing restructuring of Toys ""R"" Us, the biggest U.S. toy chain."
walmart,2017-11,"""We are playing to win in toys. We think there is opportunity to expand share,"" Chief Executive Brian Cornell said on a media call."
walmart,2017-11,"Third-quarter same-store sales topped estimates, rising 0.9 percent in the quarter as price cuts drove a 24 percent jump in comparable online sales. Analysts expected a 0.4 percent increase, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S."
walmart,2017-11,"In a turnaround announced in February, Cornell vowed to double the number of small-format stores, invest heavily in e-commerce, aggressively promote products and keep grocery prices low to compete with Wal-Mart, Amazon.com Inc and supermarket chain Kroger Co . [nL3N1GD458]"
walmart,2017-11,"Target's Chief Merchandising Officer Mark Tritton said comparable grocery sales rose slightly, helped by demand for produce."
walmart,2017-11,"But pricing pressure on groceries is continuing to intensify. Amazon on Wednesday unveiled more discounts on several products at its Whole Foods Market with Thanksgiving around the corner, sending shares in U.S. grocers lower. [nL3N1NL4S6]"

walmart,2017-11,"Nov 15 (Reuters) - Canadian grocery and pharmacy chain Loblaw Cos Ltd said on Wednesday it is tying up with San Francisco-based Instacart to offer home delivery service in Toronto and Vancouver, as it tries to carve out more market share in a brutal retail sector."
walmart,2017-11,"The company will deliver food and other pantry staples from Loblaw's Real Canadian Superstore and T&T supermarkets to customers in Toronto starting Dec. 6, and in Vancouver starting in January, Loblaw Chief Executive Officer Galen Weston said on a conference call with analysts."
walmart,2017-11,"Home delivery startup Instacart counts Whole Foods , Costco , Target and more than 100 other retailers as customers for grocery deliveries. Instacart charges a delivery fee to bring items to customers."
walmart,2017-11,"Like many other Canadian retailers, Loblaw has lost market share to bigger American rivals, and it will also face cost pressure next year from rising minimum wages in its home province of Ontario. [nL1N1IW0X8]"
walmart,2017-11,"Amazon's recent purchase of Whole Foods - which included Canadian locations - has put retailers against the wall. They have had to revamp their online and delivery services, as well as keep pricing competitive."
walmart,2017-11,"Loblaw's Weston said he still expects ""2018 will be a very difficult year."""
walmart,2017-11,"Earlier on Wednesday, Loblaw, which also operates Shoppers Drug Mart, said it would shut 22 unprofitable stores."
walmart,2017-11,"The company beat analysts' expectations for third-quarter profit and revenue thanks largely to a rise in same-store sales at its Shoppers Drug Mart outlets, which rose 3.3 percent in the quarter, up from 2.8 percent growth a year ago."
walmart,2017-11,"Same-store sales growth at its Loblaw groceries was flat at 1.4 percent in the quarter ended Oct. 7, compared with the year-earlier period."
walmart,2017-11,Loblaw said the store closures would come across its brands and formats and would largely be completed by the end of the first quarter of 2018.
walmart,2017-11,"It had earlier said it would cut 500 jobs, planning to reinvest the savings in its digital and e-commerce businesses."
walmart,2017-11,"The Brampton, Ontario-based retailer expects to record charges for the layoffs and store closures of about C$135 million, most of which will be factored into the fourth quarter."
walmart,2017-11,It expects annualized savings of about C$85 million from the changes.
walmart,2017-11,"Excluding items, the company earned C$1.39 per share, beating analysts' average estimate of C$1.30 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S."
walmart,2017-11,"Revenue was flat at C$14.19 billion, but beat analysts' estimate of C$14.10 billion."

walmart,2017-11,{{20171113T152424.352+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-Hasbro Mattel bid would put Barbie in the corner(Refiles to correct Hasbro stock symbol in first paragraph. The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.)
walmart,2017-11,"The two companies operate differently, but that may mean there's scope for cost savings. Mattel, for instance, makes around half of its own toys, according to UBS. That saddles it with a workforce six times the size of Hasbro's, which outsources manufacturing. Mattel's American Girl has its own retail stores, too. The relatively asset-heavy strategy isn't working. Mattel's share price has halved in a year."
walmart,2017-11,"Boss Margo Giorgiadis, imported earlier this year from Google, has a plan to slash costs equivalent to 10 percent of the company's sales. Say Hasbro, which has much higher operating margins, can squeeze out half as much again, or an extra $250 million a year. Tax and capitalise that additional profit, and the roughly $3.4 billion in value creation easily covers a 30 percent premium to Mattel's $4.8 billion undisturbed stock-market value, with a little left over."
walmart,2017-11,"Feuds in the toybox are the big obstacle. Hasbro previously snatched brands like Sesame Street and Disney Princess from Mattel. Some franchises have gone the other way, too. The likes of Marvel and DC, which license Mattel to make toys using their characters, might squawk. Nonetheless, the bankruptcy of toy-store chain Toys R Us shows meaner enemies are close by. Faced with tech disruption and playground bullies like Amazon and Wal-Mart , childish squabbles are best left behind."
walmart,2017-11,"- Hasbro has made an approach to acquire rival toymaker Mattel, Reuters reported on Nov. 10, citing sources familiar with the matter."
walmart,2017-11,"- Mattel had a market capitalisation of $5 billion at its closing share price on Nov. 10, roughly half what it was a year earlier. Hasbro's equity value was $11.4 billion, up nearly 10 percent."
walmart,2017-11,"- Mattel's brands include Barbie and Fisher-Price, while Hasbro makes Star Wars toys, Play-Doh and Monopoly. Hasbro also has the Disney Princess franchise, which it started developing in 2016 after winning a contract with Disney that ended a partnership with Mattel."
walmart,2017-11,"- The two companies have discussed merging on several occasions in the past. In 1996, Hasbro rejected an all-share offer from Mattel, saying it would fail for antitrust reasons."
walmart,2017-11,"- Mattel reported earnings of $0.09 per share adjusted for one-off factors on Oct. 26, missing analyst estimates of $0.56, and suspended its quarterly dividend."

walmart,2017-11,"HONG KONG, Nov 13 (Reuters Breakingviews) - China's fiercest e-commerce rivalry is entering a new, potentially volatile phase. A jump in third-quarter sales and a surprise net profit for the period show the $57 billion JD.com is reining in costs while keeping up with Alibaba , its much larger e-commerce rival. But Jack Ma's $477 billion behemoth is muscling in on key domains like logistics and food. That's a threat for JD's already thin margins."
walmart,2017-11,"- Chinese online retailer JD.com on Nov. 13 reported revenue of 83.7 billion yuan ($12.6 billion) in the three months to the end of September, an increase of 39 percent from the same period last year."
walmart,2017-11,"- The company reported a net profit attributable to ordinary shareholders of 1 billion yuan for the quarter, compared with a net loss of 467 million yuan from continuing operations a year earlier. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters were expecting a mean net loss of 213 million yuan."
walmart,2017-11,"- On Nov. 12, JD.com announced that the value of all goods and services transacted on its shopping sites reached $19.1 billion during the Singles Day Shopping Festival, which ran from Nov. 1 to Nov. 11."
walmart,2017-11,"- Separately, Alibaba said transactions on its platforms topped $25.6 billion during one day, Nov. 11, also known as China's Singles Day. Alibaba's one-day sales figure was up 39 percent from a year earlier."

walmart,2017-11,"Keith Noreika, a top U.S. banking regulator, stirred disquiet among community bankers with his call for a review of the current regulations. The proposal by the acting Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) was made at a banking conference in New York and comes as technology companies such as Amazon and Apple Inc have already broken into the financial arena with payment services and different types of lending.

walmart,2017-11,"WASHINGTON/NEW YORK, Nov 8 (Reuters) - U.S. regulations that bar companies such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc from providing banking services should be reviewed as they reduce competition and concentrate more risk among a smaller number of banks, a U.S. banking regulator said on Wednesday."
walmart,2017-11,"At a banking conference in New York, acting Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) Keith Noreika urged resumption of debate over whether to allow other types of businesses to engage in traditional banking."
walmart,2017-11,"Noreika's comments could stoke tensions between his agency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp (FDIC), which insures customer deposits at traditional banks and has put the brakes on moves by Wal-Mart and others to get into banking."
walmart,2017-11,"Taking questions after his speech, Noreika said his office was working on tweaks to its enforcement of current regulations, for instance being more flexible in scoring bank managements for compliance."

walmart,2017-11,"TORONTO, Nov 7 (Reuters) - Canadian retailers are struggling to fortify their defenses against aggressively expanding U.S. e-commerce operators in an effort to stave off further loss of market share and erosion of profit margins in a brutal retail market."
walmart,2017-11,"Moves over the past year include Hudson's Bay Co's C$60 million ($47 million) investment in robotic technology at a Toronto distribution centre, and second-largest grocery chain Metro Inc's C$400 million investment to automate its warehouses. [nL4N1MD3UO]"
walmart,2017-11,"Four of the top five firms in Canadian e-commerce are from the United States, led by Amazon.com Inc and Wal-Mart Stores , according to a 2017 ranking of 45 retailers that operate in Canada done by digital analytics company Chasm."
walmart,2017-11,"In contrast, four of the bottom five are Canadian, including Empire Company's Sobeys, grocery operator Loblaw Co Ltd and its pharmacy chain Shoppers Drug Mart."
walmart,2017-11,"Metro declined to comment, while Empire did not respond to a request for comment."
walmart,2017-11,"Canadian retailers risk missing out on strong consumer demand at a time of economic prosperity, and ending up with a fate similar to Sears Canada, T Eaton Co and Zellers Inc, all of whom collapsed after failing to adapt to customer needs, analysts say. [nL2N1MO16U]"
walmart,2017-11,"Analysts point to corporate cultures that are reluctant to expand digital capabilities, fear that online operations could cannibalize in-store sales, and the scale already built up by U.S. players that makes them hard to dislodge."
walmart,2017-11,"""Most of the Canadian companies are fundamentally the same types of businesses they've always been, while the world around them is changing,"" said Ashish Anand, chief executive at Vancouver-based Chasm, which specialises in the retail sector."

walmart,2017-11,"Amazon, eBay Inc , Apple Inc , Wal-Mart Stores , Costco Wholesale Corp and Home Depot Inc account for about 40 percent of annual Canadian e-commerce revenues of almost $20 billion, according to Boston Consulting Group (BCG), which predicts more than 35 percent of all Canadian retail sales growth will come from online in the coming decade."
walmart,2017-11,"Retailers who do not move aggressively risk further erosion in operating profit margins, already below 5 percent, analysts said."
walmart,2017-11,"Canadian consumers research and make online purchases as frequently as U.S. shoppers, said Dan Bodley, principal, and Matt MacKenzie, partner, at BCG."
walmart,2017-11,"Even so, their eventual purchase baskets are about half the size of their U.S. counterparts, likely due to the smaller selection available online in Canada, they said."

walmart,2017-11,"Nov 6 (Reuters) - U.S. drug distributor Cardinal Health Inc's quarterly revenue fell short of analysts' forecasts, as prices for generic drugs remained stubbornly low, sending the company's shares down to a four-year low on Monday."
walmart,2017-11,"Cardinal also named Chief Financial Officer Mike Kaufmann as its next CEO, replacing George Barrett, who will step down after eight years at the helm."
walmart,2017-11,"The executive shuffle comes at a time when Cardinal, like drugmakers and other drug wholesalers, battles low prices for generic drugs amid a push by U.S. health regulators to approve these drugs at a faster rate than before."
walmart,2017-11,"However, some drug distributors have partnered with big U.S. retailers, helping blunt some of the impact of lower prices."
walmart,2017-11,"Cardinal's rival McKesson Corp reported strong results last week as it was able to buy generic drugs at cheaper prices, thanks to a sourcing agreement with Wal-Mart ."
walmart,2017-11,"For Cardinal, however, the benefit from its joint venture with CVS Health Corp did not offset the price slump, and profits at its pharmaceutical business fell 13 percent in the quarter ended Sept. 30."
walmart,2017-11,"The pharmaceutical business, which distributes branded and generic medicines, contributes nearly 90 percent to Cardinal's overall revenue."
walmart,2017-11,"But generic drug prices were falling as expected, and the decline was ""less dramatic"" compared with last year, Barrett said on a call with analysts."
walmart,2017-11,Cardinal had in August forecast a mid-single digit percentage decline in generics prices for the year ending June 2018.
walmart,2017-11,"Barrett's remarks echoed those of Cardinal's peers, suggesting that prices may soon stabilize."

walmart,2017-11,"""We never dismiss any competitor, or potential competitor. It's something that we take seriously,"" said Barrett, who will remain CEO until Jan. 1."
walmart,2017-11,"Dublin, Ohio-based Cardinal Health's revenue rose 2 percent to $32.64 billion in the latest quarter, but lagged analysts' estimates of $33.48 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S."
