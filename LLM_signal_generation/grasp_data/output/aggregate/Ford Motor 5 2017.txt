Ford Motor,2017-5,{{20170526T191938.011+0000}}Acquisitions accelerate as tech giants seek to build AI smartsBy Julia Love
Ford Motor,2017-5,"SAN FRANCISCO, May 26 (Reuters) - A total of 34 artificial intelligence startups were acquired in the first quarter of this year, more than twice the amount of activity in the year-ago quarter, according to the research firm CB Insights."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"Tech giants seeking to reinforce their leads in artificial intelligence or make up for lost ground have been the most aggressive buyers. Alphabet Inc's Google has acquired 11 AI startups since 2012, the most of any firm, followed by Apple Inc , Facebook Inc and Intel Corp , respectively, according to CB Insights."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"The companies declined to comment on their acquisition strategies. A spokesman for Apple did confirm the company's recent purchase of Lattice Data, a startup that specializes in working with unstructured data."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"The first quarter also saw one of the largest deals to date as Ford Motor Co invested $1 billion in Argo AI, founded by former executives on self-driving teams at Google and Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL]. [nL1N1FV1FS] [nL1N1FY0O6]"
Ford Motor,2017-5,"Startups are looking to go deep on applications of artificial intelligence to specific fields, such as health and retail, industry observers say, rather than compete directly with established companies."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"""What you will see is very big players will build platform services, and startup communities will migrate more to applied intelligent apps,"" said Matt McIlwain, managing director of Madrona Venture Group."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"Healthcare startup Forward, for example, is using artificial intelligence to crunch data that can inform doctors' recommendations."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"""For people who really want to focus on core AI problems, it makes a lot of sense to be in bigger companies,"" said Forward Chief Executive Officer Adrian Aoun, who previously worked at Google. ""But for folks who really want to prove a new field, a new area, it makes more sense to be separate."""
Ford Motor,2017-5,"Artificial intelligence companies that do remain independent field a steady stream of suitors: Matthew Zeiler, chief executive of Clarifai, which specializes in image and video recognition, said he has been approached about a dozen times by prospective acquirers since starting the company in late 2013."
Ford Motor,2017-5,Clarifai's pitch to customers such as consumer goods company Unilever Plc and hotel search firm Trivago is bolstered by its narrow focus on artificial intelligence.
Ford Motor,2017-5,"""(Google) literally competes with almost every company on the planet,"" Zeiler said. ""Are you going to trust them with being your partner for AI?"""
Ford Motor,2017-5,"Tech giants have been locked in a bidding war for academics specializing in artificial intelligence. Startups rarely have the capital to compete, but a company with a specialized mission can win over recruits, said Vic Gundotra, chief executive of AliveCor, which makes an AI-driven portable heart monitor."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"""They say, 'I want to come here and work on a project that might save my mother's life,'"" Gundotra said."

Ford Motor,2017-5,"BENGALURU/DETROIT, May 25 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co on Thursday reshuffled senior management and brought back a former executive from Uber Technologies Inc, signaling its new chief executive officer will rely on tested company veterans to turn Ford around rather than outside talent."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"James Hackett, named CEO on Monday, has said he wants to streamline Ford's hierarchy and speed up decision-making, as the No. 2 U.S. automaker faces threats from Silicon Valley's self-driving technology and resurgent rival General Motors Co in its traditional markets. [nL1N1IQ14I]"
Ford Motor,2017-5,"Ford said it hired Sherif Marakby as its new vice president in charge of its autonomous and electric vehicle efforts. Marakby had been hired away from ride-hailing company Uber [UBER.UL], where he was vice president of global vehicle programs. Prior to joining Uber last year, Marakby was at Ford for more than 25 years and worked on hybrid and electric vehicles."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"The automaker said it will also combine its purchasing and product development operations under Hau Thai-Tang, previously head of global purchasing. Thai-Tang, 50, will have the task of simultaneously accelerating vehicle development and reining in costs as rival GM unleashes a volley of models aimed at the heart of Ford's product lineup."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"Raj Nair, currently Ford's executive vice president of product development and chief technical officer, will take over as president, North America, effective June 1, the company said. He will be responsible for operations that generate about 90 percent of Ford's global profits."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"In other moves, Ford named Steven Armstrong as head of Europe, Middle East and Africa and Peter Fleet as chief of Asia Pacific and China."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"Armstrong is currently chief operating officer for Ford of Europe, while Fleet is in charge of sales and marketing for the Asia-Pacific region."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"Last week, the company announced plans to cut 1,400 white-collar positions and is expected to make significant cost cuts in the coming months."

Ford Motor,2017-5,{{20170525T131002.015+0000}}RPT-ANALYSIS-Lack of new launches leaves Ford playing catchup with GM(Repeats story published earlier on Thursday)
Ford Motor,2017-5,"DETROIT, May 25 (Reuters) - James Hackett spent the last year plotting Ford Motor Co's long-term self-driving car strategy. In his first week as chief executive, he has more immediate concerns: stopping a skid in North American sales and fending off a market share grab by resurgent archrival General Motors Co ."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"The U.S. No. 2 automaker is stuck in a product drought that shows no signs of easing until 2019, according to two sources who track Detroit's launch plans. Given the auto industry's long product cycles, it is not clear what Hackett can do immediately to get Ford out of its predicament, which can be traced back to decisions by former CEOs."
Ford Motor,2017-5,Hackett was tapped to run the company's autonomous car and ride-sharing unit a year ago. On Monday he unexpectedly found himself at the helm of the whole company as Ford axed CEO Mark Fields. [nL4N1IO2J0]
Ford Motor,2017-5,"He now has to face up to a void of new vehicles, partly caused by former CEO Alan Mulally, who focused much of the company's resources on an expensive 2014 redesign of Ford's crown jewel, the F-Series pickup."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"That safeguarded America's longtime best-selling vehicle, but it prevented Ford from developing other hits. Given that it typically takes three to four years for a new or redesigned vehicle to get into production, the full effect of Mulally's narrow focus is now being felt."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"Mulally also gambled heavily on making an expensive shift to aluminum from steel to lighten up trucks and make them more fuel efficient, a bet that looks questionable in retrospect, as gas prices have remained far lower than anyone expected."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"If Fields had immediately started pulling forward product launches when he took over from Mulally in July 2014, the first of those would likely reach the market in the autumn of 2018 at the earliest. As it is, Ford must wait until early 2019 for its first big slug of new models to hit showrooms."
Ford Motor,2017-5,There is not much Hackett can do about that. Any product moves he makes today would not likely show up in the market before 2021.
Ford Motor,2017-5,"""Ford needs to move faster,"" said RBC auto analyst Joseph Spak."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"Hackett, only three days into his new job, has not yet laid out his plans for Ford publicly."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"Ford spokesman Michael Levine side-stepped questions of a short-term product drought. ""We're bullish on our strong pipeline of all-new cars, trucks and SUVs coming in the next five years,"" he told Reuters. ""What's more, the vehicles that we are launching ... will continue to deliver high transaction prices and good business."""
Ford Motor,2017-5,"For much of the past decade, Ford has benefited from management and marketing problems at GM, including GM's 2009 bankruptcy and a safety scandal that hobbled the company in 2014."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"Now, however, Ford confronts a crosstown rival largely free of debt and focused on grabbing market share from Ford, particularly in the truck and SUV segments which account for most of both companies' profits."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"GM, the No. 1 U.S. automaker, is in the midst of a prolific four-year patch of new vehicle launches, many approved by Mary Barra, the company's former head of global product development who was named CEO in January 2014."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"In hindsight, GM benefited from its bankruptcy, as it emerged essentially debt-free and able to spend more on new products. Ford did not seek bankruptcy during last decade's auto industry crisis, and instead borrowed heavily to survive it, leaving it short on cash to invest in new vehicles."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"That result of that disparity is now becoming evident. A Reuters analysis shows that over the past two years GM has surpassed Ford in pretax profit per vehicle in North America. In 2016, Ford made $2,981 per vehicle, calculated by dividing pretax earnings by the number of vehicles sold, compared with $3,044 for GM. And GM plans to solidify that lead by rolling out a volley of new models aimed at the heart of Ford's lineup."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"GM has invested billions of dollars over the past three years to overhaul many of its best-selling truck and SUV models, including the full-size Chevrolet Suburban and Cadillac Escalade SUVs that dominate their sector and typically boast pretax margins of $20,000 or more."
Ford Motor,2017-5,GM also has boosted its share of the U.S. truck market with the 2014 launch of the mid-size Chevrolet Colorado and GMC Canyon pickups. Ford's rival to the Colorado - an all-new Ranger pickup - is not expected to debut until early 2019.
Ford Motor,2017-5,"Over the past five years, both companies have spent roughly the same - about 8 percent to 10 percent of revenue - on capital equipment, engineering, and research and development, Reuters analysis shows. But GM has brought far more new and redesigned vehicles to market in the United States in the past three years."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"""GM seems to be getting more for its money and realizing the results sooner,"" said Joe Langley, an analyst with IHS Markit."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"To see a comparison of Ford and GM's expected new and redesigned vehicles over the next four years, click on [nL1N1IQ12D]"
Ford Motor,2017-5,"Earlier this month, Ford's U.S. sales and marketing chief Mark LaNeve acknowledged the company had missed an opportunity by ""not participating in"" the mid-size truck and compact crossover segments where GM is well positioned."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"Ford also has lagged in redesigning its eight-year-old Expedition and Navigator SUVs, which go up against GM's Suburban and Escalade, and finally will be overhauled this fall."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"One of the biggest challenges for Ford will come next year, when its market-leading F-150 truck will be challenged by GM's redesigned Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickups."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"A year after that, GM is expected to launch new heavy-duty editions of the Silverado and Sierra to challenge Ford's F-Series Super Duty, which is one of the industry's most profitable vehicles."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"Altogether, GM plans five launches in 2018 and eight in 2019, according to industry sources familiar with the company's plans. In comparison, Ford expects to unveil only two redesigned vehicles in 2018 and will only reach some kind of parity with six launches in 2019."

Ford Motor,2017-5,"GM has invested billions of dollars over the past three years to overhaul many of its best-selling truck and SUV models, including the full-size Chevrolet Suburban and Cadillac Escalade SUVs that dominate their sector and typically boast pretax margins of $20,000 or more."
Ford Motor,2017-5,GM also has boosted its share of the U.S. truck market with the 2014 launch of the mid-size Chevrolet Colorado and GMC Canyon pickups. Ford's rival to the Colorado - an all-new Ranger pickup - is not expected to debut until early 2019.
Ford Motor,2017-5,"Over the past five years, both companies have spent roughly the same - about 8 percent to 10 percent of revenue - on capital equipment, engineering, and research and development, Reuters analysis shows. But GM has brought far more new and redesigned vehicles to market in the United States in the past three years."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"""GM seems to be getting more for its money and realizing the results sooner,"" said Joe Langley, an analyst with IHS Markit."

Ford Motor,2017-5,"Earlier this month, Ford's U.S. sales and marketing chief Mark LaNeve acknowledged the company had missed an opportunity by ""not participating in"" the mid-size truck and compact crossover segments where GM is well positioned."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"Ford also has lagged in redesigning its eight-year-old Expedition and Navigator SUVs, which go up against GM's Suburban and Escalade, and finally will be overhauled this fall."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"One of the biggest challenges for Ford will come next year, when its market-leading F-150 truck will be challenged by GM's redesigned Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickups."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"A year after that, GM is expected to launch new heavy-duty editions of the Silverado and Sierra to challenge Ford's F-Series Super Duty, which is one of the industry's most profitable vehicles."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"Altogether, GM plans five launches in 2018 and eight in 2019, according to industry sources familiar with the company's plans. In comparison, Ford expects to unveil only two redesigned vehicles in 2018 and will only reach some kind of parity with six launches in 2019."

Ford Motor,2017-5,"TORONTO, May 23 (Reuters) - BlackBerry Ltd shares surged to a four-year high in Toronto on Tuesday, extending a two-month rally spurred on by expectations for strong growth in the fast-expanding cyber security and automotive software markets."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"The Canadian shares climbed as much as 9.4 percent to C$15.34. As of early afternoon, volume was at about 3 million shares, nearly triple the full-day three-month average."
Ford Motor,2017-5,The rally followed an announcement by Ford Motor Co on Friday that the automaker planned to start updating software on its vehicles using a wireless system to enhance security based on BlackBerry technology.

Ford Motor,2017-5,"McQuire and other analysts also cited this month's global ""ransomware"" attack, dubbed WannaCry, with helping to raise BlackBerry's profile."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"BlackBerry shares have climbed more than 60 percent since they reported stronger-than-expected earnings on March 31, which reinforced expectations that the company is succeeding in re-inventing itself after the collapse of a smartphone business that was once the market leader."

Ford Motor,2017-5,"""This chunk of change from Qualcomm has really changed investor sentiment on BlackBerry,"" said Canaccord Genuity analyst Michael Walkley."

Ford Motor,2017-5,"Ford's new chief executive, James Hackett, who had been overseeing its division focused on self-driving cars, has a reputation as a turnaround artist for guiding changes at furniture maker Steelcase Inc that helped it regain its market leading position, though those reforms did not always benefit shareholders."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"Over the 18 years that Hackett oversaw Steelcase as a public company, the stock fell by more than 55 percent and delivered a total return, including reinvested dividends of negative 22.3 percent, or an annualized total return under his tenure of negative 1.54 percent. By contrast, the S&P 500 generated an annualized total return over the same run of 5.62 percent."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"Notably, on both a price and total return basis, Steelcase underperformed its main competitors like Herman Miller Inc and HNI Corp by substantial margins on a cumulative basis."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"Other management changes at the company could be coming as Hackett attempts to reposition the company for a new era of electric vehicles and autonomous driving, said Adam Jonas, an analyst at Morgan Stanley.

Ford Motor,2017-5,"SHANGHAI, May 22 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Ford Motor's many flubs under Mark Fields were becoming existential for the $43 billion carmaker's founding family. Two weeks ago, a majority of those shareholders not named Ford voted to abolish the family's super-voting stock. The Fords took the hint, and the chief executive is now leaving. But naming a 62-year-old from the furniture trade to replace him hints at how unprepared the family was for a revolt."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"That Fields' job was in jeopardy was no secret. The 36 percent decline in Ford shares since he replaced Alan Mulally nearly three years ago was the mathematical manifestation of investors' discontent in his stewardship. Even General Motors only withstood a 10 percent slide, while Fiat Chrysler and Tesla both increased strongly."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"This sparked a last-ditch move by Fields a week ago to cut white-collar workers, potentially irritating jobs-obsessed President Donald Trump, with whom the company clashed over plans to move production of some small cars to Mexico. It backtracked on that decision, in part because of slack demand for those vehicles."

Ford Motor,2017-5,"""This is a settlement between us and our customers,"" said a Tokyo-based spokeswoman for Mazda."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"Lawsuits against Honda Motor Co <7267.T>, Ford Motor Co and Nissan Motor Co <7201.T> have not been settled, lawyers said."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"The four automakers who settled said in a joint statement they agreed to the deal ""given the size, scope and severity of the Takata recall,"" but did not admit fault or liability. The automakers said the settlements, if approved by a Florida judge, will be overseen by a court-appointed administrator."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"The settlement includes an outreach program to contact owners; compensation for economic losses including out-of-pocket expenses; a possible residual distribution payment of up to $500; rental cars for some owners; and a customer support program for repairs and adjustments, including an extended warranty."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"In January, Takata agreed to plead guilty to U.S. charges of criminal wrongdoing and to pay $1 billion to resolve a federal investigation into its inflators. The majority of the air bag-related fatalities and injuries have occurred in the United States."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"Automakers have recalled 46 million Takata air bag inflators in 29 million U.S. vehicles. By 2019, automakers will recall 64 million to 69 million U.S. inflators in 42 million vehicles, regulators said in December. Most inflators have not been fixed."

Ford Motor,2017-5,"BEIJING, May 18 (Reuters) - General Motors Co will stop selling cars in India from the end of this year, drawing a line under two decades of battling in one of the world's most competitive markets where it has less than a one percent share of passenger car sales."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"The decision was announced as part of a series of restructuring actions from the Detroit automaker on Thursday, and marks a significant blow to India's strategy of encouraging domestic manufacturing. [nL2N1IJ11Q]"
Ford Motor,2017-5,GM says it would no longer market its Chevrolet brand - its only brand of cars marketed in India - despite India's promise as a market set to overtake Japan as the world's third largest in the next decade.
Ford Motor,2017-5,"""We are not giving up benefits India offers as a local cost manufacturing hub with an excellent supplier base which is extremely competitive,"" Stefan Jacoby, GM's chief of international operations, said in an interview."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"GM's exports from India, mainly to Mexico and Latin America, nearly doubled to 70,969 vehicles in the fiscal year than ended on March 31. The Talegaon plant has a capacity of 130,000 vehicles a year."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"Jacoby said the move to turn the Talegaon assembly into an export-only plant will not impact GM Korea and its position as an export hub. India will export vehicles mostly to Mexico and South America, among other destinations, while GM Korea will ship Korean-made cars to North America, Southeast Asia, Australia and Pakistan."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"Dan Ammann, GM's global president, said the restructuring actions for India announced on Thursday in essence cancels ""most"" of the plan GM unveiled in 2015 to invest $1 billion in India to deploy newly-designed vehicle architecture as part of a Global Emerging Market vehicle programme or GEM for short, and build a new line of low-cost vehicles in India."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"The decisions to significantly scale down GM's operations in India are results of months of analysis over ""where we are going to place our bets (globally) as a company,"" Ammann said in an interview."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"The move is the latest blow to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ""Make in India initiative,"" aimed at making the country a global manufacturing powerhouse."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"Last year, Ford Motor Co shelved plans to produce a new compact car family designed mainly for emerging markets. India and China had been slated to be the main manufacturing hubs for the new range that was set to begin production in 2018. [nL8N1BH1K5]"
Ford Motor,2017-5,"The auto sector is a major employment generator accounting for about 29 million direct and indirect jobs in India. Moreover, the $93 billion industry contributes 7.1 percent to the nation's gross domestic product and almost 50 percent of India's manufacturing output."
Ford Motor,2017-5,Ammann said GM looked at many options but determined that the investment originally planned for India would not deliver the kind of return other global opportunities offered.
Ford Motor,2017-5,"GM plans to continue to work on the $5 billion GEM programme, which GM is developing with SAIC Motor. Ammann said the programme remains on track, even without India now, to account for about 2 million vehicles a year in global sales volume, mainly in Latin America, Mexico and China."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"Despite being an early entrant, GM has struggled to boost its sales and market share in India in part because it has failed to launch low-cost yet feature-rich vehicles that Indian buyers prefer, according to analysts. Many of them also blame the high cost of maintaining and servicing Chevy cars for deterring cost-conscious buyers in India."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"GM said in 2015 it aimed to double its India market share to around 3 percent or more by 2020. But its market share fell to below 1 percent in the year ended March 31 from 1.17 percent the previous year - even as India's market grew 9 percent to climb above the 3 million vehicle level. GM's volume in India fell by a fifth to 25,823 vehicles in the year ended March 31."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"The GEM vehicle architecture, which is being engineered as an emerging-market platform technology for markets such as China, Brazil, Mexico and India, was envisioned to help GM come up with more cost-competitive cars. But for India, GEM was still too pricey a technology since it has been designed under GM's global vehicle safety, performance and other standards."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"To be successful in India, Jacoby said one option for GM was to ""give up on implementing global platform and vehicle standards"". The other was to team up with a local partner to run full operations as an automaker designing products and manufacturing and marketing products locally."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"""We have made the decision that these two options are not for us,"" Jacoby said."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"{{20170518T073004.846+0000}}GM will cut operations in India, South AfricaBy Joseph White"
Ford Motor,2017-5,"DETROIT, May 18 (Reuters) - General Motors Co plans to quit selling vehicles in India by the end of this year and will sell operations in South Africa, the latest steps in a strategy of focusing cash and engineering effort on fewer, more profitable markets."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"The Detroit automaker said on Thursday it will take a $500 million charge in the second quarter to restructure operations in India, Africa and Singapore. It will cancel most of a planned $1 billion investment to build a new line of low-cost vehicles in India."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"About $200 million of the charge will be a cash expense, GM said. The moves are expected to save $100 million a year in a sector of GM's global business that last year lost about $800 million, the company said."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"GM President Dan Ammann told Reuters in an interview that the latest restructuring moves - and a series of earlier decisions to quit unprofitable markets - allow GM to focus more money, engineering effort and senior management time on expanding where the company is strong, including China and the North American pickup and SUV business, where GM has a ""product onslaught coming."""
Ford Motor,2017-5,GM also has said it is investing about $600 million a year in efforts to develop autonomous vehicles and transportation services.
Ford Motor,2017-5,"GM, like its Detroit rival Ford Motor Co, has found it increasingly expensive to compete in emerging markets outside of China. GM sold just 49,000 vehicles in India and South Africa combined last year."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"Chief Executive Mary Barra traveled to New Delhi in 2015 to announce a plan to invest $1 billion there to build a new line of Chevrolet models developed as part of a Global Emerging Market vehicle program - GEM for short. Since then, auto sales overall in India have slumped, and GM has failed to gain traction against incumbents such as Maruti Suzuki India Ltd."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"Now, GM plans to stop selling Chevrolet brand vehicles by the end of the year and will produce vehicles only for export at its remaining factory in Talegaon. The company currently employs about 2,500 workers there."
Ford Motor,2017-5,GM said it would continue work at its design and engineering center near Bangalore.
Ford Motor,2017-5,"The $5 billion GEM program, which GM is developing with its Chinese partner Shanghai Automotive Industries Corp, remains on track to account for about 2 million vehicles a year in global sales volume, mainly in Latin America, Mexico and China, Ammann said."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"""The market opportunity for GEM has continued to grow,"" he said."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"In a separate move, GM plans to stop building Chevrolet vehicles in South Africa and sell its South African factory to Japan's Isuzu Motors Ltd <7202.T>, along with the 30 percent stake the U.S. automaker owns in a truck venture with Isuzu Motors <7202.T>. Isuzu agreed in February to buy out GM's 57.7 percent stake in a joint venture in Kenya."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"GM also will cut an undisclosed number of staff at its GM International Operations headquarters in Singapore. About 200 people work in that operation, the company said."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"Since Barra took over GM in 2014, the one-time largest automaker in the world has taken aggressive steps to narrow its focus to China, the highly-profitable North American light truck and sport utility market, Latin America, vehicle financing and transportation services that ultimately could use autonomous vehicles. [nL2N1GJ0H3]"
Ford Motor,2017-5,"Despite the restructuring moves, including Barra's decision in March to sell loss-making European operations to French rival Peugeot SA , GM's share price has been stuck in a range close around $33 where it went public in 2010 following a government-funded bankruptcy. GM shares closed on Wednesday at $32.42."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"Barra and GM's directors are under pressure from David Einhorn's Greenlight Capital, which wants GM to split its common stock into two classes, one that pays dividends and a second that would be valued to reflect the company's potential growth. Greenlight also has put forward a slate of three new directors. GM's management and incumbent board have rejected Greenlight's proposals. [nL4N1I6482] The hedge fund holds 54.8 million GM shares, or about 3.5 percent of the total."

China's ambitious Silk Road project could leave its people holding the bag. Plus: job cuts at Ford."

Ford Motor,2017-5,"NEW YORK, May 17 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co said on Wednesday it plans to cut 1,400 salaried jobs in North America and Asia through voluntary early retirement and other financial incentives as the No. 2 U.S. automaker looks to boost its sagging stock price."
Ford Motor,2017-5,Ford shares fell as much as 2.5 percent in heavy trading and were headed to their worst close since November 2012 as the broader markets tumbled over the political turmoil in Washington.
Ford Motor,2017-5,"The buyout offers were a fraction of the 20,000 job cuts that some news outlets had reported Ford could announce this week."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"Ford said the cuts would amount to about 10 percent of a group of 15,000 managers and other non-production workers and would reduce labor costs for that segment by 10 percent."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"The company said a large group of salaried workers would not be covered by the planned cuts, including those in product development and in the Ford Credit unit. The cuts will not apply to Ford's Europe or South America units."
Ford Motor,2017-5,About two-thirds of the buyout offers are in North America and the rest in Asia. Ford does not plan to cut hourly workers or production.
Ford Motor,2017-5,"The automaker will offer financial incentives, including generous early retirement offers, to encourage salaried employees to depart voluntarily by the end of September. Ford said it expects it will hit the targets through voluntary offers, spokesman Mike Moran said."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"""Reducing costs and becoming as lean and efficient as possible also remain part of that work,"" Moran said."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"The voluntary incentives offers will go to about 9,600 of 30,000 U.S. salaried workers, the company said."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"In 2016, Ford cut hundreds of white-collar jobs in Europe, reducing costs by $200 million annually."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"Ford continues to churn out strong profits, reporting a record $10.4 billion in pretax earnings in 2016, and expects to earn around $9 billion this year."
Ford Motor,2017-5,But investors are worried about slowing sales and an industry that could be dominated by autonomous vehicles and car sharing in the future.
Ford Motor,2017-5,"The Detroit automakers have been under pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump to add jobs in the United States, but declining U.S. sales and stalled share values are exerting a stronger force."
Ford Motor,2017-5,Ford said in January it was cancelling a planned Mexico plant and adding 700 jobs in Michigan.
Ford Motor,2017-5,Last month it announced plans to cut costs by $3 billion in 2017. Automakers are trimming expenditures as they brace for slowing auto sales.
Ford Motor,2017-5,"General Motors Co (GM.N) has cut more than 4,000 U.S. jobs since November, and moved to conserve capital by shedding its European operations and closing unprofitable operations in Asia."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"Ford's market capitalization has been surpassed by Tesla Inc , which has sold just a fraction of Ford vehicles."

But for India, GEM was still too pricey a technology since it has been designed under GM's global vehicle safety, performance and other standards."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"To be successful in India, Jacoby said one option for GM was to ""give up on implementing global platform and vehicle standards"". The other was to team up with a local partner to run full operations as an automaker designing products and manufacturing and marketing products locally."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"""We have made the decision that these two options are not for us,"" Jacoby said."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"{{20170518T073004.846+0000}}GM will cut operations in India, South AfricaBy Joseph White"
Ford Motor,2017-5,"DETROIT, May 18 (Reuters) - General Motors Co plans to quit selling vehicles in India by the end of this year and will sell operations in South Africa, the latest steps in a strategy of focusing cash and engineering effort on fewer, more profitable markets."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"The Detroit automaker said on Thursday it will take a $500 million charge in the second quarter to restructure operations in India, Africa and Singapore. It will cancel most of a planned $1 billion investment to build a new line of low-cost vehicles in India."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"About $200 million of the charge will be a cash expense, GM said. The moves are expected to save $100 million a year in a sector of GM's global business that last year lost about $800 million, the company said."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"GM President Dan Ammann told Reuters in an interview that the latest restructuring moves - and a series of earlier decisions to quit unprofitable markets - allow GM to focus more money, engineering effort and senior management time on expanding where the company is strong, including China and the North American pickup and SUV business, where GM has a ""product onslaught coming."""
Ford Motor,2017-5,GM also has said it is investing about $600 million a year in efforts to develop autonomous vehicles and transportation services.
Ford Motor,2017-5,"GM, like its Detroit rival Ford Motor Co, has found it increasingly expensive to compete in emerging markets outside of China. GM sold just 49,000 vehicles in India and South Africa combined last year."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"Chief Executive Mary Barra traveled to New Delhi in 2015 to announce a plan to invest $1 billion there to build a new line of Chevrolet models developed as part of a Global Emerging Market vehicle program - GEM for short. Since then, auto sales overall in India have slumped, and GM has failed to gain traction against incumbents such as Maruti Suzuki India Ltd."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"Now, GM plans to stop selling Chevrolet brand vehicles by the end of the year and will produce vehicles only for export at its remaining factory in Talegaon. The company currently employs about 2,500 workers there."
Ford Motor,2017-5,GM said it would continue work at its design and engineering center near Bangalore.
Ford Motor,2017-5,"The $5 billion GEM program, which GM is developing with its Chinese partner Shanghai Automotive Industries Corp, remains on track to account for about 2 million vehicles a year in global sales volume, mainly in Latin America, Mexico and China, Ammann said."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"""The market opportunity for GEM has continued to grow,"" he said."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"In a separate move, GM plans to stop building Chevrolet vehicles in South Africa and sell its South African factory to Japan's Isuzu Motors Ltd <7202.T>, along with the 30 percent stake the U.S. automaker owns in a truck venture with Isuzu Motors <7202.T>. Isuzu agreed in February to buy out GM's 57.7 percent stake in a joint venture in Kenya."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"GM also will cut an undisclosed number of staff at its GM International Operations headquarters in Singapore. About 200 people work in that operation, the company said."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"Since Barra took over GM in 2014, the one-time largest automaker in the world has taken aggressive steps to narrow its focus to China, the highly-profitable North American light truck and sport utility market, Latin America, vehicle financing and transportation services that ultimately could use autonomous vehicles. [nL2N1GJ0H3]"
Ford Motor,2017-5,"Despite the restructuring moves, including Barra's decision in March to sell loss-making European operations to French rival Peugeot SA , GM's share price has been stuck in a range close around $33 where it went public in 2010 following a government-funded bankruptcy. GM shares closed on Wednesday at $32.42."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"Barra and GM's directors are under pressure from David Einhorn's Greenlight Capital, which wants GM to split its common stock into two classes, one that pays dividends and a second that would be valued to reflect the company's potential growth. Greenlight also has put forward a slate of three new directors. GM's management and incumbent board have rejected Greenlight's proposals. [nL4N1I6482] The hedge fund holds 54.8 million GM shares, or about 3.5 percent of the total."

Ford Motor,2017-5,"NEW YORK, May 17 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co said on Wednesday it plans to cut 1,400 salaried jobs in North America and Asia through voluntary early retirement and other financial incentives as the No. 2 U.S. automaker looks to boost its sagging stock price."
Ford Motor,2017-5,Ford shares fell as much as 2.5 percent in heavy trading and were headed to their worst close since November 2012 as the broader markets tumbled over the political turmoil in Washington.
Ford Motor,2017-5,"The buyout offers were a fraction of the 20,000 job cuts that some news outlets had reported Ford could announce this week."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"Ford said the cuts would amount to about 10 percent of a group of 15,000 managers and other non-production workers and would reduce labor costs for that segment by 10 percent."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"The company said a large group of salaried workers would not be covered by the planned cuts, including those in product development and in the Ford Credit unit. The cuts will not apply to Ford's Europe or South America units."
Ford Motor,2017-5,About two-thirds of the buyout offers are in North America and the rest in Asia. Ford does not plan to cut hourly workers or production.
Ford Motor,2017-5,"The automaker will offer financial incentives, including generous early retirement offers, to encourage salaried employees to depart voluntarily by the end of September. Ford said it expects it will hit the targets through voluntary offers, spokesman Mike Moran said."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"""Reducing costs and becoming as lean and efficient as possible also remain part of that work,"" Moran said."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"The voluntary incentives offers will go to about 9,600 of 30,000 U.S. salaried workers, the company said."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"In 2016, Ford cut hundreds of white-collar jobs in Europe, reducing costs by $200 million annually."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"Ford continues to churn out strong profits, reporting a record $10.4 billion in pretax earnings in 2016, and expects to earn around $9 billion this year."
Ford Motor,2017-5,But investors are worried about slowing sales and an industry that could be dominated by autonomous vehicles and car sharing in the future.
Ford Motor,2017-5,"The Detroit automakers have been under pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump to add jobs in the United States, but declining U.S. sales and stalled share values are exerting a stronger force."
Ford Motor,2017-5,Ford said in January it was cancelling a planned Mexico plant and adding 700 jobs in Michigan.
Ford Motor,2017-5,Last month it announced plans to cut costs by $3 billion in 2017. Automakers are trimming expenditures as they brace for slowing auto sales.
Ford Motor,2017-5,"General Motors Co (GM.N) has cut more than 4,000 U.S. jobs since November, and moved to conserve capital by shedding its European operations and closing unprofitable operations in Asia."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"Ford's market capitalization has been surpassed by Tesla Inc , which has sold just a fraction of Ford vehicles."

Ford Motor,2017-5,"In December a meeting was held between the firm and junior Brexit minister David Jones, according to a log posted on the government's website, but in response to a freedom of information request from Reuters the department said it was not in the public interest to release any of the correspondence."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"""Part of the negotiation and exit process requires the UK to be able to effectively pursue and protect our interests abroad. Prematurely publicising information will prejudice our ability to successfully conduct that business,"" it said."

Ford Motor,2017-5,"Business minister Greg Clark declined to publish a copy of a letter sent to the carmaker, telling lawmakers in December they would only release it once commercial confidentialities no longer apply."
Ford Motor,2017-5,Clark's department took over four months to respond to a freedom of information request made by Reuters requesting correspondence between Nissan and the government. The standard response period is up to 20 working days.

Ford Motor,2017-5,{{20170512T180453.770+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-Ford shareholders in confused tizzy over strategy(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.)
Ford Motor,2017-5,"NEW YORK, May 12 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Ford Motor shareholders are in a confused tizzy over the company's strategy. There are good reasons to question executives about their plans - not least the stock's 37 percent drop since Mark Fields took over as boss almost three years ago. Railing against the Ford family's supervoting stock, as many did at Thursday's annual meeting, feels good but won't fix the automaker's immediate issues."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"More than 35 percent of shareholders supported scrapping the dual-class share structure that gifts the descendants of Henry Ford two-fifths of the vote with less than 2 percent of outstanding stock. That's one of the highest percentages in over a decade of the resolution being on the proxy. Stripping out the family's votes, at least 58.5 percent of investors favor moving to one share, one vote."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"In any event, the beef about Ford's plummeting market value misses a key point: Ford's stock had raced ahead of General Motors and Fiat Chrysler as the company was further along in its turnaround plan. Its local rivals have been catching up since then, but at around 5.5 times next year's estimated earnings both still trade at a discount to Ford's 6.7 times multiple."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"- Some 35.5 percent of Ford shareholders voted to scrap the car company's supervoting stock, the highest percentage in over a decade of the resolution being in the annual proxy."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"- B shares give the Ford family 40 percent of the vote even though the structure gives it an economic interest of just 1.78 percent. After stripping out their stake, 58.5 percent of shareholders would have voted to get rid of the dual-class shares, had all of them cast a vote."

Ford Motor,2017-5,"PARIS, May 12 (Reuters) - Marine Le Pen must quickly resolve her far-right party's stance on the euro, top officials in France's National Front said on Friday, as a row over the issue heated up following her presidential election defeat to centrist Emmanuel Macron."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"In a party where dissent is rarely expressed publicly, officials and allies have become uncharacteristically vocal since Le Pen's May 7 defeat to Macron on whether to abandon plans to ditch the euro, which some blame for the loss."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"""It is clear that Marine will have to decide very quickly,"" Jean-Richard Sulzer, one of Le Pen's economic advisers, told Reuters. ""This cannot wait for the congress,"" he said, referring to a crucial party meeting scheduled for end 2017 or early 2018."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"The party's position on the euro may be a factor in parliamentary elections due in June, although the issue is unlikely to be resolved by then."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"Gilbert Collard, one of only four National Front (FN) lawmakers, has said the party must scrap its plans to ditch the currency, while Le Pen's deputy Florian Philippot, who has had a major influence on her policy, said he would quit if that happened. [nL8N1ID5FC]"
Ford Motor,2017-5,"""In this very centralised, very autocratic party, we find ourselves at the moment where the pressure cooker is about to explode because there has been too tight a lid on internal dissent for too long,"" said Nice university researcher Gilles Ivaldi, a specialist of the FN."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"Some top FN officials privately acknowledge that the anti-euro policy, which Le Pen tried to soften in the last days of the campaign, likely played a key role in her bigger-than-expected defeat."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"But they disagree on whether that was because the plan was watered down, with a longer timetable and plans to keep some form of monetary cooperation, or because it was too radical."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"""Everybody knows the euro is dead,"" said Bernard Monot, an FN economist who is also EU lawmaker and was part of Le Pen's campaign committee. ""But there have been too many shortcuts on communication and people thought we wanted a brutal, radical euro exit. This scares people,"" he told Reuters, adding that the FN must ""draw the necessary conclusions from this."""
Ford Motor,2017-5,"At stake for the FN, after it gathered more votes than ever in the presidential election but nevertheless did less well than it hoped, is whether it can become France's main opposition party, as it has billed itself."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"Referring to the mid-June election of lower house of parliament representatives, which will be key both to Macron's capacity to enact his reforms and to the future of the FN, Monot said: ""The parliamentary elections will take place first, and then we will meet to discuss this (the euro policy)."""
Ford Motor,2017-5,"While a large majority of FN supporters back ditching the euro, opinion polls indicate three-quarters of French voters want to keep Europe's single currency."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"""We must work on making ourselves better understood on this,"" said Jean Messiha, who was in charge of coordinating Le Pen's presidential election manifesto and is a candidate in the June ballot."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"Unlike Collard but like Philippot, Messiha insists the party must stick to its trademark policy of a return to a national currency. ""Otherwise we would lose our soul,"" he told Reuters, criticising what he called ""pressure from the politico-mediatic establishment to abandon some of the crucial points of our program."""
Ford Motor,2017-5,"With the question of the euro and of who is to blame for Le Pen's defeat also simmering on pro-FN websites, some grassroots activists worried about the divisions."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"""We must all be in it together,"" said Aymeric Durox, 31, a history teacher in Fontainebleau near Paris and a candidate there in the parliamentary elections. As far as he's concerned, the FN ""should not completely give up on its euro policy."""

Ford Motor,2017-5,"LONDON, May 4 (Reuters) - British new car registrations slumped by 20 percent in April, the biggest year-on-year drop for over six years after record demand in March, when customers brought forward purchases to avoid a tax increase, an industry body said on Thursday."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"Sales fell 19.8 percent to 152,076 vehicles last month, traditionally a period when fewer vehicles are sold after a new licence plate series is issued in March, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said."
Ford Motor,2017-5,Demand in March was at a record high as individuals and businesses in Europe's second biggest autos market sought to avoid paying an increase in excise duty that came into force from April 1 for the most polluting vehicles.
Ford Motor,2017-5,"Registrations so far this year are up 1.1 percent, despite forecasts that demand would fall by at least 5 percent this year due to the uncertainties around Brexit and after consecutive record performances."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"Following an 8.4 percent rise in March and a slump in April, also hit by fewer selling days due to Easter, the SMMT said it foresaw less erratic swings in the months ahead."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"""We ... expect demand to stabilise over the year as the turbulence created by these tax changes decreases,"" SMMT Chief Executive Mike Hawes said."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"But the industry faces a number of challenges ahead including new levies and tighter rules on the most polluting vehicles, which appear to be already dampening demand for diesel vehicles. [nL5N1HC1HL]"
Ford Motor,2017-5,"Demand for diesel fell 27 percent last month, which compared with a fall of 13 percent for gasoline-powered vehicles, as the government prepares plans to tackle air pollution which could be announced as soon as Friday."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"Britain's Financial Conduct Authority also said last month it would be launching a review into finance packages offered to customers buying cars due to concerns that there might be ""irresponsible lending in the motor finance industry."""
Ford Motor,2017-5,"Cheap finance has been key to the success of the sector in recent years with up to 90 percent of cars sold using personal contract plans, whereby customers effectively rent a new car for two to three years by making monthly payments before often trading in for a new model."

Ford Motor,2017-5,"SAN FRANCISCO, May 3 (Reuters) - Electric-car maker Tesla Inc on Wednesday reported first-quarter revenue that more than doubled, and while saying the upcoming Model 3 was on schedule for July, it downplayed the mass-market vehicle to give a sales pitch for its more expensive Model S."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"Chief Executive Elon Musk's bold approach to cars, space exploration and clean energy has fueled investor enthusiasm for Tesla. But skeptics are waiting to see if Musk can fulfill his promise of producing 500,000 cars per year in 2018, or six times Tesla's 2016 production."
Ford Motor,2017-5,Shares were down about 2 percent in after-hours trade following the results.
Ford Motor,2017-5,The automaker's comments underscored the additional challenge of keeping up demand for its older models.
Ford Motor,2017-5,"""We have seen some impact of Model S orders as a function of people being confused"" that Model 3 is the upgrade to Model S, Musk said on a conference call."
Ford Motor,2017-5,Tesla said it had $4 billion of cash on hand as it headed into the second quarter and expects year-to-date capital expenditures to be slightly over $2 billion by the time it starts Model 3 production - within its previous targeted range of $2 billion to $2.5 billion.
Ford Motor,2017-5,"That cushion should give the company some near-term breathing room from needing to tap Wall Street for cash, said CFRA Research analyst Efraim Levy. Tesla in March raised $1.2 billion from the markets."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"Record deliveries helped Tesla boost its revenue to $2.7 billion in the quarter, but a net loss net widened to $330.3 million from $282.3 million a year earlier, largely driven by its SolarCity acquisition."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"Tesla has much riding on the Model 3, which could finally make the cash-hemorrhaging automaker profitable. But while much of the company hype has focused on the car due in July, Tesla on Wednesday made a sales pitch for its overshadowed Model S."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"Tesla is anxious that the $35,000 Model 3 - which will likely not be delivered in volume until 2018 - avoids cannibalizing the higher-margin Model S, which lists at about double the starting price."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"In its earnings release, Tesla stated that a key challenge for the company would be to eliminate misperceptions about the differences between the Model S and the Model 3."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"""We want to be super clear that Model 3 is not version three of our car. Model 3 is essentially a smaller, more affordable version of the Model S with fewer features,"" Musk said on a conference call, adding buyers erroneously thought the Model 3 would be more advanced."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"""The Model S will be better than Model 3,"" he added. ""As it should be, as it's a more expensive car."""
Ford Motor,2017-5,"Tesla needs to ramp up for a deluge of Model 3 customers, and the company said it would be adding nearly 100 retail, delivery and service locations worldwide, representing a 30 percent increase. Tesla also said it was also working to improve efficiency, citing vehicle repair times that have fallen by 35 percent due to the use of remote diagnostics."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"The company reiterated its forecast of delivering 47,000-50,000 Model S and Model X cars in the first half of 2017, a target it announced earlier this year."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"Still, customer deposits fell 7 percent in the quarter, which could suggest interest in Tesla's current product line, the Model S and Model X, is decreasing."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"On a per-share basis, Tesla's net loss narrowed to $2.04 from $2.13."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"Excluding items, the company lost $1.33 per share. Analysts on average had expected a loss of 81 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S."

Ford Motor,2017-5,"{{20170503T210728.931+0000}}UPDATE 6-Investors cheer Delphi's bet on electric, connected cars(Adds analyst comment, closing share price)"
Ford Motor,2017-5,"DETROIT, May 3 (Reuters) - Automotive supplier Delphi Automotive Plc on Wednesday said it plans to spin off operations tied to internal combustion engines and focus on technology for electrically powered and self-driving vehicles, boosting its share price and highlighting the challenges for legacy auto industry players."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"Vehicles driven by humans and powered with petroleum will dominate roads from Shanghai to San Francisco for years to come, but investors who supply the capital to produce such vehicles are signaling a belief that after a century-long run, internal combustion cars are a sunset industry."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"The most dramatic symbol of this turn is electric luxury car maker Tesla Inc's ascent this year to a higher market capitalization than either Ford Motor Co or General Motors Co . Despite a recent slump in U.S. sales, the Detroit giants are robustly profitable, while Tesla has yet to earn a full year profit. Tesla reports first-quarter results later Wednesday."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"Delphi shares rose as much as 12 percent on Wednesday after the company announced its plan to separate into two entities - one dedicated to internal combustion technology and the other focused on electrification and automation. The shares closed at $87.01, up nearly 11 percent, representing about $2 billion in added market value."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"""There's a whole element of the componentry of the car that Wall Street values at a lower level,"" Delphi Chief Executive Officer Kevin Clark told Reuters in an interview on Wednesday."
Ford Motor,2017-5,Other big auto suppliers are making similar calls. German auto supplier Robert Bosch GmbH [ROBG.UL] earlier this week said it had sold its starters and alternators business to a Chinese mining company. [nL4N1I42Y1]
Ford Motor,2017-5,"Germany's Rheinmetall also tried to float its Kolbenschmidt Pierburg unit, which is specialized in the development, manufacture and aftermarket supply of pistons, engine blocks, and plain bearings back in 2012. However, it was forced to call off the IPO due to a market slump and a lack of investor enthusiasm for a stock with heavy exposure to combustion engine technology, bankers said."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"Combustion engines are taking a hit from regulators, particularly those in Europe and China, who want to slash greenhouse gas and smog forming emissions on a fast timetable. That risk was exacerbated by Volkswagen's diesel emissions scandal. As a result of ""Dieselgate,"" politicians in cities like Stuttgart have discussed banning diesel vehicles from the inner city, leading customers to abandon diesel cars."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"On Wednesday, German car registration figures provided by Germany's KBA federal motor authority, showed that demand for diesel engine vehicles plunged by 19.3 percent in April, to a market share of 41.3 percent of overall registrations.[nL8N1I532M]"
Ford Motor,2017-5,Delphi's Clark said he expects diesel production to decline by about 3 percent a year for the next few years.
Ford Motor,2017-5,China's government has also set aggressive targets for electric vehicles that are forcing carmakers to accelerate electric vehicle plans. [nL3N1GQ4AT]
Ford Motor,2017-5,"U.S. auto supplier Visteon , like Delphi, has shed most of its traditional car parts making operations, and is focused on connected vehicle technology and infotainment."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"Clark said Delphi's powertrain business, which has about $4.5 billion in annual revenues and does not yet have a name, has room to grow. The company will have more freedom to invest in that growth as its managers no longer have to compete for capital with opportunities presented by the increasing computerization of cars, Clark said."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"The powertrain company, which accounted for about 27 percent of Delphi revenues last year, also could seize opportunities to consolidate other players in the legacy market, capitalizing on the continued demand for internal combustion and the regulatory pressure to make them cleaner, a person familiar with Delphi's strategy said."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"Analysts on Wednesday estimated Delphi's powertrain business will be valued at six to seven times earnings before interest and taxes, while the electronic and autonomous technology side of the company will likely command a higher valuation."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"The electronic Delphi - which also could get a new name - will compete in a potential market the company estimates at more than $100 billion a year, nearly twice the size of the internal combustion market. Delphi said its electronic systems units had about $12 billion in revenue last year."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"Delphi ""is best positioned to be the 'picks and shovels' supplier of big data solutions"" to automakers, Barclays analyst Brian Johnson wrote in a note on Wednesday."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"But the market of the future is still largely in the future. Most established car makers, for instance, have not adopted over the air software upgrades on a mass scale, and depend entirely on internal combustion engine cars and sport utilities for profits."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"Clark said over the next three to five years demand will accelerate for high speed in-vehicle data networking systems, autonomous driving technology and over the air software updates. Delphi has acquired a company that enables over the air software updates, as well as a company that develops high speed data networks. Clark said Delphi could make more acquisitions to expand its electronic systems capability, or forge more partnerships."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"Delphi has partnerships through its autonomous vehicle business with Intel Corp and Israeli autonomous vehicle technology firm Mobileye , which is being bought by Intel for $15.3 billion."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"""If we can do more things like that"" the Mobileye-Intel partnership, ""that would be great,"" Clark said."
Ford Motor,2017-5,Delphi is betting that many automakers will ultimately opt to buy a standard system rather than invest in one-of-a-kind systems of their own. Delphi said it expects to launch its turnkey autonomous driving system with a customer in 2019.
Ford Motor,2017-5,"The spinoff will be tax free and is expected to be completed by March 2018, Delphi said."

Ford Motor,2017-5,"NEW YORK, May 3 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Delphi is going where carmakers can only dream of driving. The $23 billion parts maker is spinning off its powertrain unit to focus on connected and autonomous vehicle technology. These fast-growing, higher-margin businesses will sport a top-tier multiple even if car sales slow. The likes of Ford and General Motors don't have the luxury of following Delphi's lead."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"Like other suppliers, Delphi Automotive already trades at a premium to its customers. Before announcing its breakup plan on Wednesday, the company, headquartered in Gillingham, England, commanded a multiple of 12 times this year's estimated earnings. Only Toyota <7203.T> of the major carmakers makes it into double digits, but still falls shy."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"The lofty valuation is a consequence of running businesses with better margins. Ford and GM, for example, are hitting the ball out of the park if their pre-tax margin reaches 7 percent. Delphi's was 9.4 percent in the first quarter and may exceed 12.5 percent for the rest of the year, according to analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"In outlining the split on Wednesday, Delphi boss Kevin Clark played up the increased focus each of the two new management teams would have as separate companies more than the immediate benefit to shareholders. Even so, investors added nearly a tenth to Delphi's value, raising its multiple above 13 times earnings."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"- Delphi Automotive on May 3 said it is planning to spin off its powertrain business. The move will leave the parent company with two businesses focused on advanced connectivity, autonomy and mobility: electrical/electronic architecture; and electronics and safety."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"- The business to be spun off to shareholders, which will be named Powertrain, accounted for $4.5 billion of the company's revenue in 2016 and sported an adjusted operating margin of 11.5 percent and an adjusted EBITDA margin of 15.7 percent."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"- The top line for the advanced connectivity, autonomy and mobility businesses last year was $12 billion, with an adjusted operating margin of 13.6 percent and an adjusted EBITDA margin of 17.6 percent."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"- Delphi also on May 3 reported first-quarter net income from continuing operations of $335 million. Excluding one-off items, earnings per share of $1.59 beat the consensus estimate of sell-side analysts of $1.46 a share."

Ford Motor,2017-5,"DETROIT, May 2 (Reuters) - Major automakers on Tuesday posted declines in U.S. new vehicle sales for April in a sign the long boom cycle that lifted the American auto industry to record sales last year is losing steam, sending carmaker stocks down."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"The drop in sales versus April 2016 came on the heels of a disappointing March, which automakers had shrugged off as just a bad month.

Ford Motor,2017-5,"May 2 (Reuters) - General Motors Co said on Tuesday it would take a charge of up to $100 million after a judge ordered the seizure of its plant in Valencia last month, a move that prompted the halting of its operations in Venezuela."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"The largest U.S. automaker said it was deconsolidating its business in the country following the seizure of its Valencia plant on April 18 by judicial authorities, which led GM to fire 2,700 workers. [nL1N1HS221] The plant had not produced a car since the beginning of 2016 because of parts shortages and strict currency controls."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"GM, the market leader in Venezuela for 35 years, said executives have expressed a willingness ""to talk with government officials and union leaders about the circumstances under which it could be possible to start production and employ some number of workers with a new, viable business model."""
Ford Motor,2017-5,"Total auto production in Venezuela fell to a historic low of 2,849 cars in 2016, about 75 percent less than the year before, according to Venezuela's automotive industry group."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"In the first two months of 2017, total Venezuelan auto production was just 240 vehicles, down 50 percent over the same period last year."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"Declining auto production comes amid rising protests. On Tuesday, Venezuela's opposition was blocking streets to decry unpopular leftist President Nicolas Maduro's decision to create a new super-body known as a ""constituent assembly,"" a move they say is a veiled attempt to cling to power by avoiding elections."
Ford Motor,2017-5,Venezuela's car industry has been hit by a lack of raw materials stemming from complex currency controls.
Ford Motor,2017-5,"Nearly all vehicles built in Venezuela in the first two months this year were assembled by Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T>, which said last month its plant was operating normally. But the company said it was ""only producing based on orders that come in."""
Ford Motor,2017-5,"In early 2015, Ford Motor Co wrote off its investment in Venezuela when it took an $800 million pretax writedown. The company does not currently produce vehicles in Venezuela."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"The South American nation's economic crisis has hurt many other U.S. companies, including food makers and pharmaceutical firms. A growing number of them, like GM, have removed their Venezuelan operations from their consolidated accounts."

Ford Motor,2017-5,"DETROIT, May 2 (Reuters) - General Motors Co, Ford Motor Co and Toyota Motor Corp, the top three automakers in the United States, on Tuesday all posted lower new vehicle sales in April in a fresh sign the long boom cycle for the auto industry is losing steam."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"No. 1 U.S. automaker GM reported a 6 percent decline in April sales to 244,406 vehicles, but said the month continued to see strong growth for crossovers and trucks."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"Over the past couple of years, U.S. consumers have increasingly shunned cars in favor of larger crossovers, SUVs and trucks."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"New vehicle sales have risen ever since the end of the Great Recession, hitting a record of 17.55 million units in 2016. But as consumer appetite for new cars has waned, automakers have raised discounts to get vehicles off dealer lots."
Ford Motor,2017-5,GM said the average transaction price for its vehicles rose in the first quarter and that its consumer discounts were equivalent to 11.7 percent of the transaction price. The automaker also said its inventory level had risen to 100 days of supply at the end of April versus around 70 days at the end of 2016.
Ford Motor,2017-5,"GM has said it will bring inventories down by the end of 2017, but the most recent level has created concern among analysts."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"Ford, the No. 2 U.S. automaker, said sales were down 7.2 percent in April, with sales to consumers down 10.5 percent. Car sales dropped 21 percent and trucks declined 4.2 percent, while SUV sales rose 1.2 percent."
Ford Motor,2017-5,"Toyota <7203.T> said sales fell 4.4 percent in April, with its luxury Lexus brand posting an 11.1 percent drop. U.S. car sales at the Japanese automaker were down 10.4 percent, while truck sales were up 2.1 percent."
