Ford Motor,2017-9,"Oct 2 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co has formed a team to accelerate global development of electric vehicles, whose mission will be to ""think big"" and ""make quicker decisions,"" an executive of the company said on Monday."
Ford Motor,2017-9,"One aim of Ford's ""Team Edison"" is to identify and develop electric-vehicle partnerships with other companies, including suppliers, in some markets, according to Sherif Marakby, vice president of autonomous vehicles and electrification."
Ford Motor,2017-9,"Global demand for electric vehicles has ""a significant potential to increase"" as governments implement EV mandates and quotas, Marakby said in an interview."
Ford Motor,2017-9,He said the group will be based in the Detroit area and work with regional Ford vehicle electrification teams in China and Europe.
Ford Motor,2017-9,"China, India, France and the United Kingdom all have announced plans to phase out vehicles powered by combustion engines and fossil fuels between 2030 and 2040."
Ford Motor,2017-9,"Marakby said Team Edison ""will look holistically at the electric vehicle market."""
Ford Motor,2017-9,"""The idea is to think big, move fast and make quicker decisions"" on EV production as demand increases and technology advances, he added."

Ford Motor,2017-9,"{{20170928T014642.911+0000}}UPDATE 1-U.S. senators announce deal on self-driving car legislation(Adds joint statement, details of House bill, background)"
Ford Motor,2017-9,"WASHINGTON, Sept 27 (Reuters) - Two U.S. senators said late on Wednesday that they had reached a bipartisan deal on legislation aimed at easing hurdles to getting self-driving cars to drivers."
Ford Motor,2017-9,"U.S. Senator John Thune, a Republican who chairs the Commerce Committee, and Senator Gary Peters, a Michigan Democrat, said they had reached a deal on the legislation that would be voted on by the committee on Oct. 4."
Ford Motor,2017-9,They said they planned to release the text on Thursday.
Ford Motor,2017-9,"General Motors Co , Alphabet Inc , Ford Motor Co and others have lobbied for the legislation to speed deployment of self-driving cars without human controls by allowing federal regulators to approve their use if they deem them safe and barring states from blocking autonomous vehicles."
Ford Motor,2017-9,Two sources briefed on the matter said the bill would not include larger commercial trucks.
Ford Motor,2017-9,"""We expect adoption of self-driving vehicle technologies will save lives, improve mobility for people with disabilities, and create new jobs,"" Thune and Peters said in a joint statement."
Ford Motor,2017-9,"A similar bill that unanimously passed the U.S. House earlier this month also excluded vehicles above 10,000 pounds."
Ford Motor,2017-9,Senate aides have been negotiating for weeks over trucks and language in the bill that could preempt some state court lawsuits over the safety of self-driving vehicles.
Ford Motor,2017-9,"The House measure, the first significant federal legislation aimed at speeding self-driving cars to market, would allow automakers get approval to sell up to 25,000 vehicles in the first year, rising to 100,000 by year three, as long as they could demonstrate the vehicles are at least as safe as current vehicles with human controls."
Ford Motor,2017-9,"States could still set rules on registration, licensing, liability, insurance and safety inspections, but not performance standards."
Ford Motor,2017-9,"Automakers would have to submit safety assessment reports to regulators, but the bill would not require pre-market approval of advanced vehicle technologies."
Ford Motor,2017-9,"Automakers and some technology companies hope to begin deploying driverless vehicles around 2020. They have been pushing for new federal rules making it easier to deploy self-driving technology, but some consumer groups have sought additional safeguards."
Ford Motor,2017-9,"States have issued a variety of rules in the absence of clear federal guidance, and automakers have complained that California's rules are too restrictive."
Ford Motor,2017-9,"Advocates hope self-driving cars will reduce U.S. road deaths, which rose 7.7 percent in 2015, the highest annual increase since 1966. A 2014 study found U.S. traffic crashes cost society $836 billion annually, with human error behind 94 percent of crashes."

Ford Motor,2017-9,{{20170927T181323.337+0000}}Detroit Three's to lose dominance of North American auto output in 2017-IHSBy Joseph White
Ford Motor,2017-9,"DETROIT, Sept 27 (Reuters) - North American vehicle production by the unionized Detroit Three automakers will fall behind the combined North American output of Tesla Inc and automakers from Europe and Asia for the first time this year, IHS Markit forecast on Wednesday."
Ford Motor,2017-9,"In 2017, the Detroit Three could build 8.6 million vehicles in North America, while Tesla and foreign automakers build 8.7 million, IHS Markit analyst Joe Langley said on Wednesday."
Ford Motor,2017-9,"By 2024, the gap will widen, with Asian and European automakers and Tesla combining to build about 9.8 million vehicles in North America. General Motors Co , Ford Motor Co and the North American operations of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV will combine to build 8.1 million vehicles, down 6 percent from this year."
Ford Motor,2017-9,"Mexico is on track to increase its share of North American vehicle production, Langley said, moving to 4.5 million vehicles a year by 2024 from about 4 million vehicles currently."
Ford Motor,2017-9,The milestone for the growth of Tesla and foreign automakers in North America comes as the Trump administration is pushing to limit imports of vehicles from Mexico in negotiations to overhaul the North American Free Trade Agreement.
Ford Motor,2017-9,The declining share of North American vehicle production for the Detroit automakers also challenges U.S. and Canadian unions that represent their workers.
Ford Motor,2017-9,Canadian workers are on strike at a GM factory in Ontario to protest the automaker's decision to cut jobs and move to Mexico some production of sport utility models built there.
Ford Motor,2017-9,"Foreign automakers over the past year have announced plans for a wave of new or expanded plants in North America, while Tesla is ramping up to build as many as 500,000 cars a year at its plant in Fremont, Calif. Often referred to as ""transplants,"" the foreign-owned factories are poised to become the mainstream of the North American auto industry. [nL2N1M21EG]"
Ford Motor,2017-9,"Automakers are increasingly using factories in China or Mexico to build vehicles that used to be assembled solely in the United States, Langley said. He cited as an example Ford's decision to shift production of the Focus small car for North America to a Chinese assembly plant."

Ford Motor,2017-9,UPDATE 2-UK inventor James Dyson aims for electric car launch by 2020 - Reuters News
Ford Motor,2017-9,{{20170926T192103.321+0000}}UPDATE 2-UK inventor James Dyson aims for electric car launch by 2020* Vacuum cleaner maker investing 2 bln stg in electric car
Ford Motor,2017-9,"LONDON, Sept 26 (Reuters) - James Dyson, the billionaire British inventor of the bagless vacuum cleaner, said on Tuesday his company was working on developing an electric car to be launched by 2020."
Ford Motor,2017-9,Dyson said he was spending 2 billion pounds ($2.7 billion) to exploit his namesake company's expertise in solid-state battery technology and electric motors to be found in his innovative vacuum cleaners and other products like bladeless fans and air purifiers.
Ford Motor,2017-9,"""Battery technology is very important to Dyson, electric motors are very important to Dyson, environmental control is very important to us,"" Dyson, aged 71, said at his company's flagship shop on London's Oxford Street."
Ford Motor,2017-9,"""I have been developing these technologies consistently because I could see that one day we could do a car."""
Ford Motor,2017-9,"Dyson said a 400-strong team of engineers had already spent 2-1/2 years working on the hitherto secret car project in Malmesbury, Wiltshire. However, the car itself still has to be designed and the choice of battery to be finalised."
Ford Motor,2017-9,"The company was backing solid-state rather than the lithium ion technology used in existing electric vehicles because it was safer, the batteries would not overheat, were quicker to charge and potentially more powerful, he said."
Ford Motor,2017-9,Dyson said his ambition to go it alone was driven by the car industry's dismissal of an idea he had of applying his cyclonic technology that revolutionised vacuum cleaners to handle diesel emissions in car exhaust systems in the 1990s.
Ford Motor,2017-9,"""We are not a johnny-come-lately onto the scene of electric cars,"" he said. ""It has been my ambition since 1998 when I was rejected by the industry, which has happily gone on making polluting diesel engines, and governments have gone on allowing it."""
Ford Motor,2017-9,There had already been clues that Dyson was working on a car.
Ford Motor,2017-9,"His company has been hiring executives from Aston Martin and last year the government said in a report it was helping to fund development work on an electric vehicle at the firm, although the entry was quickly changed."
Ford Motor,2017-9,"Dyson said he was coming clean now because it was becoming harder to talk to subcontractors, government and potential new employees."
Ford Motor,2017-9,"But the car does not yet have a design nor a chassis, he said, and the company had not yet decided where it will be made, beyond ruling out working with the big car companies."
Ford Motor,2017-9,"""Wherever we make the battery, we'll make the car, that's logical,"" he said. ""So we want to be near our suppliers, we want to be in a place that welcomes us and is friendly to us, and where it is logistically most sensible."
Ford Motor,2017-9,"""And we see a very large market for this car in the Far East."""
Ford Motor,2017-9,"Dyson gave no details of the concept for the vehicle, beyond saying it would not be like anything else already on the market."
Ford Motor,2017-9,"""There's no point in doing one that looks like everyone else's,"" he said, adding that it would not be a sports car and it would not be ""a very cheap"" car."
Ford Motor,2017-9,"Dyson, who was a prominent backer of the campaign for Britain to leave the European Union, has been able to fund the project through the profits of his holding company."
Ford Motor,2017-9,"The Weybourne Group reported a 55 percent rise in pretax profit to 473 million pounds in 2016 on revenue of 2.53 billion pounds, according to accounts filed earlier this month. On Tuesday Dyson told his workforce, which includes more than 1,000 engineers, that the company finally had the opportunity to bring all its technologies together into a single product."
Ford Motor,2017-9,"""Competition for new technology in the automotive industry is fierce and we must do everything we can to keep the specifics of our vehicle confidential,"" he said in an email."

Ford Motor,2017-9,"HOUSTON, Sept 22 (Reuters) - Corporate donations for Hurricanes Harvey and Irma relief funds totaled nearly $225 million by Friday and pledges continued to be made, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation said."
Ford Motor,2017-9,"Automakers and energy companies, some of them affected by the most powerful storm to hit Texas' Gulf Coast in 50 years, are among the prominent corporate donors. Texas, the biggest oil-producing state, was pummeled by Harvey when it made landfall as a powerful Category 4 hurricane and proceeded to dump more than 50 inches of rain on the Houston region."
Ford Motor,2017-9,"In all, around 90 businesses have donated at least $1 million each, Bailey Jacobs, a spokeswoman for the Chamber of Commerce Foundation."
Ford Motor,2017-9,"Phillips 66 donated $4 million, an amount divided among the American Red Cross, Rebuild Texas Fund and United Way of Greater Houston, the company said in a statement. Mining and energy company BHP Billiton PLC's foundation donated $1.25 million to the American Red Cross, said James Ensor, BHP Billiton Foundation executive officer and president."
Ford Motor,2017-9,"Some companies have donated to Rebuild Texas Fund, started by computer magnate Michael Dell in collaboration with OneStar Foundation. It received pledges for $68.6 million as of Friday, according to its website. The fund aims to raise $100 million to rebuild communities in Texas affected by Harvey. [nL2N1LB077]"
Ford Motor,2017-9,"BP donated 200,000 gallons of fuel to the city of Houston and Harris County's emergency management office to help with clean-up efforts and donated $750,000 for food, water, shelter and health services for flood victims, a spokesman said in a statement."
Ford Motor,2017-9,"Automaker Ford Motor Co and its dealers donated more than $3.5 million in disaster relief and $500,000 to the Red Cross, a spokesman said in a statement. Chevrolet, a division of General Motors Co , donated $1 million to Habitat for Humanity, said spokesman James Cain. Ford, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles , GM and Hyundai Motor Co <005380.KS> offered discounts for customers needing to replace flooded vehicles, the companies said in separate releases."
Ford Motor,2017-9,Donations also are being funneled to storm-hit areas of Florida and the Caribbean.

Ford Motor,2017-9,"MILAN, Sept 21 (Reuters) - Volvo Cars showed off its first compact SUV on Thursday with the launch of its XC40 model, the latest in a sweeping overhaul of the carmaker's line-up under Chinese ownership."
Ford Motor,2017-9,"Volvo will seek to emulate the success of its larger XC90 and best-selling XC60 SUVs, which have put it on course for a fourth straight year of record sales."
Ford Motor,2017-9,"The XC40, which will first be produced at Volvo's plant in Belgium and later also in China, is a direct competitor to the Audi Q3, BMW X1, Mercedes GLA and the Jaguar E-PACE."
Ford Motor,2017-9,"Deliveries in Europe will start in the middle of the first quarter of 2018, in the United States by the end of March and in China by early May. In Germany the model will have a starting price of 31,350 euros ($37,354)."
Ford Motor,2017-9,"The XC40 will also launch Volvo's new subscription service, under which customers can pay a flat fee per month - in Europe of 699 euros ($833) - and get a new car every 24 months, just like with a mobile phone."
Ford Motor,2017-9,"Since it was bought from Ford by Zhejiang Geely Holding Group [GEELY.UL] in 2010, Volvo has taken on larger rivals such as BMW and Daimler's Mercedes-Benz with new, more upmarket models."

Ford Motor,2017-9,"{{20170919T202602.061+0000}}UPDATE 1-Ford to cut production at five North American vehicle plants(Adds inventory data, employees affected)"
Ford Motor,2017-9,"DETROIT, Sept 19 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co said on Tuesday it plans to idle five North American vehicle assembly plants for a total of 10 weeks to reduce inventories of slow-selling models."
Ford Motor,2017-9,"The plants affected include three assembly plants in the United States and two in Mexico, the company said in a statement. The vehicle models include the Ford Fusion and Lincoln MKZ midsize sedans, the Ford Focus compact car, the Lincoln Continental and Ford Mustang, Ford Fiesta and the Ford Transit van."
Ford Motor,2017-9,"Ford said the Cuautitlan assembly plant that builds the Fiesta would be idled for three weeks. The Hermosillo, Mexico plant that builds the Fusion and MKZ and the Flat Rock, Michigan, factory that assembles Continentals and Mustangs will be idled for two weeks each. The Michigan Assembly plant that builds the Focus will be idled for one week and the Kansas City assembly line that builds Transit vans will be down for two weeks. Ford did not give dates for the temporary shutdowns."
Ford Motor,2017-9,"The factories involved employ more than 15,000 people, according to Ford's website. The company did not say how many of those workers would face temporary layoffs."
Ford Motor,2017-9,"As of Sept. 1, Ford had 111 days' worth of unsold Mustangs, 87 days' supply of Fusions, and a 103 days' supply of Transit vans, according to Automotive News. Dealers had enough unsold Lincoln Continentals to last 162 days. Automakers aim for 65 to 70 days of inventory of most models."
Ford Motor,2017-9,"Ford and rival General Motors Co have wrestled most of this year to rein in high inventories of passenger cars as consumers have shifted to buying pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles. Production cuts slice into revenue, but also could help the automakers avoid deeper price cuts on vehicles they can sell."

Ford Motor,2017-9,"MUMBAI/DETROIT, Sept 18 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co and Indian vehicle maker Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd said on Monday they will launch a strategic alliance to counter challenges posed by fast-changing technology and global competition."
Ford Motor,2017-9,"The agreement, which builds on a former alliance that was unwound in 2005, is another sign that Ford's Chief Executive Jim Hackett, who took over in May, has begun to steer the automaker in a different direction."
Ford Motor,2017-9,Ford and other global automakers are under pressure as policymakers demand they shift their product lines entirely to electric vehicles over the next two to three decades. One potential benefit to Ford of a partnership with Mahindra is access to lower cost electric vehicle designs and local suppliers it needs to compete in markets such as India.
Ford Motor,2017-9,"Ford has less than a 3 percent market share in India, although its exports from India are expanding rapidly. Near term, Mahindra could help Ford lower its distribution costs or send production work to Ford's Indian plants."
Ford Motor,2017-9,"At the same time, regional automakers such as Mahindra with ambitions to grow need access to technology, strong brands and global distribution networks that established companies like Ford can offer."
Ford Motor,2017-9,"Hackett's decision to no longer go it alone in India follows a move to hire an outsider to run Ford's operations in China, and shift production of the Ford Focus for the U.S. market to China, instead of Mexico as previously planned. Hackett has also launched reviews of the company's luxury brand strategy and self-driving car development. [nL1N1KG0XO]"
Ford Motor,2017-9,Ford and Mahindra said in a joint announcement they would seek ways to collaborate on a wide range of projects for up to three years. Financial terms were not disclosed. Ford shares rose 0.9 percent Monday.
Ford Motor,2017-9,"Ford president of global markets, Jim Farley, and Ford's head of Asia Pacific operations, Peter Fleet, told Reuters on Monday that teams from the companies will start meeting next week to discuss ways to benefit in the short and medium term."
Ford Motor,2017-9,"""We are focused on the now and near with this initiative. We want to work on the opportunities that are right in front of us,"" Farley said."
Ford Motor,2017-9,"In the shorter term, Ford and Mahindra suggested they could benefit from collaborating on distribution of vehicles in India, pooling purchasing and collaborating on forays into ride services."
Ford Motor,2017-9,Ford and Mahindra had a partnership during the 1990s and early 2000s that involved cross share-holdings.
Ford Motor,2017-9,"Ford does not break out results from India, but the company reported a pre-tax loss for the second quarter in Asian and Pacific markets outside of China."
Ford Motor,2017-9,"Longer-term projects could include sharing technology or development efforts for electric vehicles, the companies said. For Ford, the Mahindra deal points to a new strategy for dealing with demands from policymakers in many major markets to phase out petroleum-fueled vehicles in favor of electric cars and trucks."
Ford Motor,2017-9,"Ford, like global rivals, faces a challenge because electric vehicles engineered for the United States or Europe are too expensive for Indian or Chinese customers. Policymakers in China and India, as well as some European countries, have signaled they want the industry to phase out diesel and gasoline vehicles over the next two to three decades. [nL2N1LT08K]"
Ford Motor,2017-9,"By allying with Mahindra, Ford can work with the leader in the emerging low-cost electric vehicle market in India. In China, Ford said last month it would pursue a joint venture with Chinese low-cost electric vehicle maker Zotye."
Ford Motor,2017-9,"""We will certainly be introducing the companies,"" Ford's Fleet said."
Ford Motor,2017-9,"India is one of the world's fastest-growing car markets. Getting more companies to manufacture in India - both for its own market and for export - is critical for Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government, which needs to create millions of new jobs each year as the workforce expands."
Ford Motor,2017-9,"However, global car makers like Fiat Chrysler , Volkswagen and General Motors have struggled in India, where nimbler rivals such as Maruti Suzuki and Hyundai Motor <005380.KS> have cornered roughly two-thirds of the market."
Ford Motor,2017-9,"Turbulence in the Indian economy, and shifts in government policy on vehicle taxes and regulation have further complicated the situation for global automakers. Earlier in September, for example, India's cabinet approved an increase in the maximum levy on luxury cars and sport utility vehicles to as much as 25 percent - less than two months after deciding on a lower rate of 15 percent as part of the new nationwide goods and services tax. [nL4N1LG3HG]"
Ford Motor,2017-9,"In May, General Motors said it would stop selling cars in India at the end of this year. [nL4N1IK1ZS]"
Ford Motor,2017-9,Mahindra and Ford said their prospective alliance would give Ford access to Mahindra's distribution network in India while Mahindra would benefit from Ford's market reach in other developing economies.
Ford Motor,2017-9,"The U.S. company has already invested more than $2 billion in India and plans to spend more to set up a global engineering center in the southern city of Chennai to help adapt products for the local market and changing consumer trends.

Ford Motor,2017-9,{{20170915T151424.693+0000}}ANALYSIS-U.S. push for self-driving law exposes regulatory divideBy Tina Bellon
Ford Motor,2017-9,"NEW YORK, Sept 15 (Reuters) - As the U.S. Congress moves quickly to pass the first federal law governing self-driving cars, some state and city officials are pushing back over fears that the measure will limit their ability to regulate vehicle safety at the local level."
Ford Motor,2017-9,"The debate highlights the challenges of rolling out a new technology that does not fit neatly into an existing regulatory framework. States traditionally regulate the driver while the federal government regulates the car, but that division of labor may be hard to maintain when cars have no drivers."
Ford Motor,2017-9,"Industry officials say a single, nationwide set of standards would speed the development of self-driving vehicle technology, ultimately lead to fewer highway deaths, and keep the United States in the forefront of automotive technology."
Ford Motor,2017-9,"The U.S. House of Representatives unanimously approved the sweeping bill last week, and U.S. Senator John Thune said on Wednesday he wanted to move the bill out of committee by early October. [nL2N1LN1G5]"
Ford Motor,2017-9,"The federal bill bars states and cities from implementing ""unreasonable restrictions"" on the rollout of self-driving cars. Critics say the vague language could lead the industry to sue states over any regulations they consider overly burdensome."
Ford Motor,2017-9,"""If Congress preempts state and local governments from enacting smart safety protections, the adoption of this amazing technology could be unnecessarily delayed by court challenges and state legislative action,"" said Leah Treat, director of the transportation bureau in Portland, Oregon, which is set to enact its own self-driving regulations by the end of the year."
Ford Motor,2017-9,"In a Sept. 5 letter to U.S. congressional leaders, the National Governors Association, the National Conference of State Legislators and other groups said the federal rules encroached on state authority and urged federal lawmakers to change the bill's language."
Ford Motor,2017-9,"The new measure authorizes manufacturers to put 25,000 self-driving cars on the road in the next year for testing. Those numbers would gradually increase, with a total of 275,000 vehicles permitted by 2021."
Ford Motor,2017-9,Critics of the federal bill said they generally support the development of self-driving technology but felt neglected and overruled by federal legislators.
Ford Motor,2017-9,"""California, for example, has higher emission standards,"" said Jennifer Cohen, government affairs director for the Los Angeles Department of Transportation. ""Does the federal preemption preclude us from enforcing these? Can we still protect our school zones?"""
Ford Motor,2017-9,"Though fully-autonomous cars are still years away from widespread adoption, 25 states have already passed legislation or issued executive orders related to autonomous vehicles, according to the National Conference of State Legislators."
Ford Motor,2017-9,"New York, for example, has taken a strict approach to testing, requiring self-driving cars to follow an approved route with a police escort.

Ford Motor,2017-9,"DETROIT, Sept 7 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co's premium Lincoln brand plans to offer hybrid gasoline-electric versions of all its U.S. models by 2022, according to three sources familiar with the plans."
Ford Motor,2017-9,"Details could be announced as early as Oct. 3, when Ford Chief Executive Officer Jim Hackett plans to update investors on the automaker's strategy."
Ford Motor,2017-9,"Company officials are also considering whether to introduce one or more all-electric Lincoln models, one source said. The proposed electrification scheme could be critical to Lincoln's future in China, which will require automakers to make electric vehicles an increasing percentage of their total sales."
Ford Motor,2017-9,"The Lincoln hybrids are part of a broader Ford program to offer at least 18 new electric and hybrid models over the next five years, the sources said."

Ford Motor,2017-9,"The plan to offer a portfolio of Lincoln hybrid models was crafted before Hackett took over in May, the sources said."
Ford Motor,2017-9,"Ford said in January 2016 it would spend $4.5 billion to electrify a portion of its U.S. fleet, including hybrid versions of the Mustang and the F-150, and at least 11 other models.

Ford Motor,2017-9,"DETROIT, Sept 1 (Reuters) - Shares of the Big Three Detroit automakers rose on Friday despite lackluster August sales, with investors focusing on a likely surge in demand as residents of the U.S. Gulf Coast replace flood-damaged cars and trucks."
Ford Motor,2017-9,"Overall U.S. car and light truck sales fell in August to a seasonally adjusted annual selling pace of 16.03 million vehicles, according to WardsAuto, down from a 17.13 million vehicle pace a year ago. U.S. auto sales have been slowing for much of the year."
Ford Motor,2017-9,"Still, analysts focused on the potential for Detroit automakers to cut inventories and stabilize used vehicle prices as Gulf Coast residents must replace tens of thousands of vehicles ruined by flood damage. Hurricane Harvey slammed into Texas last week and the storm caused historic flooding in Houston, the fourth largest city in the United States."
Ford Motor,2017-9,"Ford sales fell 2.1 percent in August. Mark LaNeve, Ford Motor Co's U.S. sales chief, told analysts that following Hurricane Katrina in 2005 ""we saw a very dramatic snapback"" in demand."
Ford Motor,2017-9,"It was not clear how many vehicles in the Houston area will be scrapped, LaNeve said, saying he had seen estimates ranging from 200,000 to 400,000 to 1 million. Ford's Houston dealers may have lost fewer than 5,000 vehicles, he said."
Ford Motor,2017-9,"Ford is the No. 1 automaker in the Houston market with 18 percent share, according to IHS Markit. The company plans to ship used vehicles to Houston dealers, and has ""every indication we would have to add some production"" of new vehicles to meet demand, LaNeve said."
Ford Motor,2017-9,"Investor concerns about inventories of unsold vehicles and falling used car prices have weighed on Detroit automakers' shares most of this year. Now, automakers can anticipate a jolt of demand from a big market that is a stronghold for Detroit brand trucks and SUVs."
Ford Motor,2017-9,"""It's got to be a positive for the industry,"" LaNeve said."
Ford Motor,2017-9,"GM got a lift from robust sales of crossovers across its four brands. The largest U.S. automaker by sales plans to move used vehicles into Houston, and expressed confidence it can reduce inventories to 850,000 or fewer vehicles by year end."
Ford Motor,2017-9,Big auto dealership chains also intend to move vehicles to Houston from other markets as residents get insurance checks for drowned cars. [nL2N1LH1HH]
Ford Motor,2017-9,"""Hurricane Harvey did have an adverse effect on deliveries during the last week of August for every automaker but the key U.S. economic fundamentals remain supportive of strong vehicle sales,"" GM Chief Economist Mustafa Mohatarem said in a statement."

Ford Motor,2017-9,"DETROIT, Aug 31 (Reuters) - Houston area car retailers and automakers are rushing to reopen dealerships and beef up inventory to replace many thousands of vehicles damaged in flooding from Hurricane Harvey."
Ford Motor,2017-9,"Pete DeLongchamps, vice president for manufacturer relations at Group 1 Automotive Inc , the third-largest U.S. auto dealer group, said the company prepared for the storm with a plan designed after Hurricane Katrina in 2005. This included moving moved inventory to higher ground and cleaning roof drains to avoid cave-ins."
Ford Motor,2017-9,"Group 1 thus lost a ""relatively small percentage"" of inventory and reopened its roughly 25 dealerships in the Houston and Beaumont area by Thursday."
Ford Motor,2017-9,"""Things have been moving fast and furious with a large number of tow-ins already,"" DeLongchamps said. ""Our customers have lost a lot of vehicles we need to help them replace."""

Ford Motor,2017-9,"The company plans to move 500 to 1,000 used cars to an AutoNation USA used car store and stage a sale Sept 21-23, when many would-be buyers should have insurance checks to replace destroyed vehicles, Cannon said."
Ford Motor,2017-9,"AutoNation is still assessing how many vehicles it lost, but it too moved vehicles to higher ground ahead of the storm."
Ford Motor,2017-9,"General Motors Co spokesman Jim Cain said the number of damaged vehicles at dealerships ""is relatively modest."""
Ford Motor,2017-9,"""But there are still several dealerships that are inaccessible, so the number will increase,"" he said. GM will move new and used vehicles to Houston, ""but it won't be done until the infrastructure and our dealers are ready."""
Ford Motor,2017-9,"Ford Motor Co is still assessing damage and inventory needs, a spokeswoman said."
