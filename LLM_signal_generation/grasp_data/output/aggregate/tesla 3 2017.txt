tesla,2017-3,"BERLIN, March 29 (Reuters) - Labour leaders at Volkswagen's luxury Audi brand have asked top management to assign production of an all-electric model to the carmaker's main plant in Germany, concerned they might lose out as electric cars gain in importance."
tesla,2017-3,"Audi will next year start building its first mass-produced electric model, the e-tron quattro sport-utility vehicle, at a plant in Brussels, together with batteries that will also be used in other VW group electric vehicles (EVs)."
tesla,2017-3,Volkswagen's (VW) main profit contributor plans to launch three all-electric models by 2020 and workers at Audi's main plant in Ingolstadt don't want to be left behind in the race for production.
tesla,2017-3,"""Our core factory must be prepared further for the future,"" Audi's top labour representative, Peter Mosch, told a gathering of 7,000 workers on Wednesday at the Ingolstadt plant which employs about 43,000 people."
tesla,2017-3,"""None of our colleagues must fall off the conveyer belt as we move into the future,"" deputy works council chief Max Waecker said."
tesla,2017-3,"Chief Executive Rupert Stadler has previously said Audi's smaller German plant in Neckarsulm where 16,000 workers assemble the higher-end A6, A7 and A8 models, will start making battery-only vehicles from about 2020."
tesla,2017-3,"Mosch, who sits on parent VW's supervisory board, asked top management to provide specific information as to how the growing shift to electric cars and digital services will affect employment at Audi, which has 88,000 workers globally."
tesla,2017-3,"Audi has previously been reluctant to embrace all-electric drive technology but the success of Tesla and arch rival BMW's ""i"" series of electric cars has convinced Audi there is a market for electric luxury vehicles after all."
tesla,2017-3,Daimler on Wednesday also said it was accelerating its electric car programme. [nL5N1H622Z]
tesla,2017-3,"Audi's e-tron quattro, powered by three electric engines, is expected to run for over 500 km (311 miles) per charge based on a 95 kWh battery pack that can be fully recharged in about 50 minutes."
tesla,2017-3,{{20170329T063920.261+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-Tencent drifts off course with Tesla(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are her own.)
tesla,2017-3,"HONG KONG, March 29 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Tencent <0700.HK> is drifting off course with Tesla. The $276 billion tech behemoth can easily afford a $1.8 billion stake in the Palo Alto-based group, run by entrepreneur Elon Musk. But Musk's electric cars are not a great fit with the Chinese group's cash-cow businesses, social media and mobile games. Making a huge, venture capital-style bet like this is a worrying sign of indiscipline."
tesla,2017-3,"This is a manageable amount for Tencent: it had $2.6 billion of net cash as of December and generated roughly the same amount in free cash flow in the fourth quarter. Like arch-rivals Alibaba and Baidu , Tencent has poured big sums into chasing future sources of growth, like cloud computing and payments. And this follows earlier VC-like deals in related areas, including electric vehicle startups, artificial intelligence and into ride-hailing giant Didi Chuxing."
tesla,2017-3,But backing smaller startups at home is one thing. Those investments give Tencent an early look at potential future competitors - and an advantage should it ever need to buy those businesses out. It is another thing to splash out billions on a passive stake in a publicly traded U.S. stock. Shareholders could buy Tesla stock themselves if they wanted.
tesla,2017-3,"Tesla's bid to reshape the auto industry is also considerably bolder and riskier than mobile gaming or selling advertising on social networks, two businesses that generate large sums of cash from the get-go. This looks like a bit of reckless driving."
tesla,2017-3,"- Chinese social media and gaming group Tencent bought a 5 percent stake in U.S. electric car maker Tesla for $1.8 billion, according to a filing on March 28."
tesla,2017-3,"- Hong Kong-listed Tencent, which owns 8.2 million shares in Tesla, is now the car maker's fifth-largest shareholder, behind Tesla Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk, and investment companies Fidelity, Baillie Gifford and T. Rowe Price."
tesla,2017-3,- Tesla's U.S-listed shares rose 2.7 percent to $277.45 on March 28. Tencent's shares stood 1.0 percent higher at HK$228.20 in early trading in Hong Kong on March 29.

tesla,2017-3,"DETROIT, March 28 (Reuters) - China's Tencent Holdings Ltd <0700.HK> has bought a 5 percent stake in U.S. electric car maker Tesla Inc for $1.78 billion, the latest investment by a Chinese internet company in the potentially lucrative market for self-driving vehicles and related services."
tesla,2017-3,"Tencent's investment, revealed in a U.S. regulatory filing, provides Tesla with a deep-pocketed ally as it prepares to launch its mass-market Model 3. Tesla's shares rose 2.7 percent to $277.45 on Tuesday, closing in on Ford Motor Co as the second-most-valuable U.S. auto company behind General Motors Co ."
tesla,2017-3,"Tencent also could help the U.S. company sell - or even build - cars in China, the world's largest auto market, analysts said."
tesla,2017-3,"""It certainly is a strong chess move for Tesla,"" said Jeff Schuster, senior vice president of forecasting for researcher LMC Automotive, citing the cash infusion and ""help in navigating the Chinese market."""
tesla,2017-3,"Tesla Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk on Tuesday tweeted: ""Glad to have Tencent as an investor and adviser to Tesla."" Musk did not say what he meant by ""adviser"" but in a separate tweet he noted Tesla had ""very few"" Model 3 orders from China, where the car has not been formally introduced."
tesla,2017-3,The midsize Model 3 is due to go on sale later this year in the United States.
tesla,2017-3,"The deal expands Tencent's presence in an emerging investment sector that includes self-driving electric cars, which could enable such new modes of transportation as automated ride-sharing and delivery services, as well as ancillary services ranging from infotainment to e-commerce."
tesla,2017-3,"Those new technologies, and their potential to create new business models and revenue streams in the global transportation sector, have attracted billions in investment from China's three tech giants - Tencent, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd and Baidu Inc ."
tesla,2017-3,"In an investor note, Morgan Stanley auto analyst Adam Jonas said on Tuesday that he ""would not be surprised"" to see Tencent and Tesla collaborate in the development and deployment of some of those technologies."
tesla,2017-3,"The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the Chinese investment in Tesla, but President Donald Trump has been critical of U.S. automakers and of China trade policies."
tesla,2017-3,"Founded in 1998 by entrepreneur Ma Huateng, Tencent is one of Asia's largest tech companies, best known for its WeChat mobile messaging app. With a market capitalization of about $275 billion, it is roughly six times the size of 14-year-old Tesla, whose $45 billion market cap on Tuesday was only $1 billion shy of 114-year-old Ford."
tesla,2017-3,"Tencent was an early investor in NextEV, a Shanghai-based electric vehicle startup that since has rebranded itself as Nio, with U.S. headquarters in San Jose, not far from Tesla's Palo Alto base. Tencent also has funded at least two other Chinese EV startups, including Future Mobility in Shenzhen."
tesla,2017-3,"In addition, Tencent has invested in Didi Chuxing, the world's second-largest ride services company behind Uber, and in Lyft, Uber's chief U.S. rival."
tesla,2017-3,"Baidu has invested in Nio, as well as in Uber and Velodyne, a California maker of laser-based lidar sensors for self-driving cars. Alibaba's mobility investments include Didi and Lyft."
tesla,2017-3,"As Tesla is doing, many of the start-up companies backed by Tencent, Baidu and Alibaba are developing self-driving systems that eventually could be introduced in commercial ride-sharing fleets in the United States and China after 2020."
tesla,2017-3,"Tencent maintains a U.S. office in Palo Alto, in the heart of California's Silicon Valley. Beijing-based Baidu and Hangzhou-based Alibaba also maintain offices in Silicon Valley."
tesla,2017-3,"To help fund Model 3 production, Tesla raised about $1.2 billion by selling common shares and convertible debt earlier this month. Tencent said its shares were acquired as part of the early March equity sale and on the open market."

The Dow Jones Industrial Average snapped an eight-day losing streak, which had been its longest run of losses since 2011."
tesla,2017-3,"U.S. consumer confidence surged to a more than 16-year high in March amid growing labor market optimism, while the trade deficit in goods narrowed sharply in February. The economy's strengthening fundamentals were bolstered by other data showing further increases in house prices in January. [nL2N1H50QO]"
tesla,2017-3,"The data ""underscore what has been going on really in this whole rally, and that is that confidence is pretty high and optimism is high and that has kind of been underpinning the resiliency of the equity markets,"" said Jim Davis, regional investment manager at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Springfield, Illinois."
tesla,2017-3,"The Dow Jones Industrial Average <.DJI> rose 150.52 points, or 0.73 percent, to 20,701.5, the S&P 500 <.SPX> gained 16.98 points, or 0.73 percent, to 2,358.57 and the Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> added 34.77 points, or 0.6 percent, to 5,875.14."
tesla,2017-3,Tuesday's gains follow declines last week as investors fretted over Trump's ability to enact his agenda after his fellow Republicans failed to pass their healthcare bill.
tesla,2017-3,"However, investors appear to have shrugged off the setback, choosing instead to focus on Trump's promise of reforming the U.S. tax code, which has been a key driver in the post-election record rally."
tesla,2017-3,"""You have got maybe some rethinking of the political calculus related to the demise of healthcare, but what that may mean for a quicker focus on tax reform,"" said Chuck Carlson, chief executive officer at Horizon Investment Services in Hammond, Indiana."

tesla,2017-3,"March 28 (Reuters) - A black production worker at Tesla Inc has filed a lawsuit claiming his job quickly turned from ""a dream come true"" to a nightmare when he was subjected to racial epithets and threats of violence from coworkers."
tesla,2017-3,"DeWitt Lambert says Tesla supervisors at the Fremont, California, factory where he has worked building electric cars since 2015 ignored his complaints about the harassment, even after he showed them a video his coworkers made on his phone in which they threatened to cut him up and send the pieces to his family members. The lawsuit was filed on Monday in California state court."
tesla,2017-3,"Lambert, 44, said other production workers routinely made racist and sexually charged comments to him, and when he complained, they falsely accused him of various infractions. He also claims he was passed over for promotions because of his race."
tesla,2017-3,The races of Lambert's coworkers were not clear from the complaint.
tesla,2017-3,"A Tesla spokesman, in a statement, said several employees were fired after the company investigated Lambert's complaints and that he is currently suspended with pay. But the company also said Lambert was friendly with the coworkers he claims harassed him before a falling out, and that he also used racial epithets and made threats."
tesla,2017-3,"The spokesman said Lambert was promoted last year and did not receive a second promotion because he posted a picture taken inside the plant on Facebook, in violation of company policy."
tesla,2017-3,"""The lawsuit has been timed to coincide with a carefully planned media blitz in an attempt to create a disingenuous narrative that is at odds with the facts,"" said the spokesman, who requested anonymity, citing company policy."
tesla,2017-3,"In his lawsuit, Lambert says other Tesla workers were not disciplined after posting photos taken inside the plant on social media. He claims Tesla violated California labor laws prohibiting racial discrimination, harassment and retaliation, and is seeking unspecified damages."
tesla,2017-3,"The complaint comes one month after a female Tesla engineer filed a lawsuit in California state court claiming she was sexually harassed, paid less than her male colleagues and passed over for promotions because of her sex."
tesla,2017-3,"In October, a 69-year-old former Tesla engineer filed an age discrimination lawsuit in federal court in San Francisco saying he was unfairly criticized by younger supervisors and coworkers, and ultimately fired, because of his age."

tesla,2017-3,"Kushner, who is married to Trump's daughter Ivanka Trump, will lead a White House Office of American Innovation to leverage business ideas and potentially privatize some government functions as the White House pushes to shrink government, cut federal employees and eliminate regulations."
tesla,2017-3,"""This office will bring together the best ideas from government, the private sector, and other thought leaders to ensure that America is ready to solve today's most intractable problems,"" Trump said in a memorandum creating the office that includes about a dozen White House officials."
tesla,2017-3,"Trump, who campaigned on a pledge to ""drain the swamp,"" has enacted a hiring freeze for most civilian federal jobs and proposed massive cuts in U.S. domestic agencies that could shrink the size of government by thousands of workers"
tesla,2017-3,The Republican president has also proposed sweeping cuts in government regulations and plans to sign an order on Tuesday rolling back some energy regulations.
tesla,2017-3,"""We have a lot more coming,"" he said on Monday at a ceremony signing bills to repeal four regulations, vowing to eliminate every ""job-killing regulation that we can find."""
tesla,2017-3,"A number of recent presidents including Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama had mixed success with their own initiatives to reinvent or streamline government using suggestions from the private sector."
tesla,2017-3,Kushner has been a regular presence at his father-in-law's side and was earlier cleared by the Justice Department to serve as a White House senior adviser even as Democrats raised concerns about potential conflicts of interest. [nL2N1GL1UF]
tesla,2017-3,"He has been given a wide range of domestic and foreign policy responsibilities, including working on a Middle East peace deal. He will continue to serve in the other roles even as he takes up the new duties, the White House said."

tesla,2017-3,"Among past efforts to overhaul the way Washington works, Clinton in 1993 called for ""reinventing government."" His reforms led to a slower pace of federal hiring, reducing the federal workforce by 240,000 jobs and closing small offices. Congress did not agree to some of the more aggressive cuts."
tesla,2017-3,"Bush proposed government management reforms, but ended up focusing largely on restructuring national security agencies after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, folding many agencies into the new Department of Homeland Security."

tesla,2017-3,"In 2015 the Obama administration announced a ""conditional commitment"" to loan Alcoa Corp the $259 million to expand production of lightweight materials for vehicles at its plant in Alcoa, Tennessee."
tesla,2017-3,The loan was to be made under the $25 billion Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing (ATVM) program.
tesla,2017-3,"Arconic , which builds aerospace and automotive parts, split from Alcoa last year."
tesla,2017-3,"""After thorough review, we decided not to proceed with the ATVM loan as it no longer fit the needs of the company,"" the company said in a statement on Friday."

tesla,2017-3,"SAN FRANCISCO, March 17 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc's $1.2 billion share and convertible debt offering on Friday demonstrates once again the unflagging ability by the luxury electric carmaker and its high-profile head, Elon Musk, to tap Wall Street for sorely needed cash."
tesla,2017-3,"In its second such capital raise in the past 12 months, the Silicon Valley company offered stock and convertible notes, roughly 20 percent more than it planned but less than what investors had generally been expecting, ahead of the launch of its crucial Model 3 sedan,"
tesla,2017-3,Tesla's stock was up slightly to $262.42 in afternoon trade on the Nasdaq.
tesla,2017-3,"The capital raise removed ""an overhang on the stock,"" in the eyes of investors, wrote analyst Jamie Albertine of Consumer Edge Research, given uncertainty over how Tesla would meet its robust spending needs, from the Model 3 to its massive battery factory in Nevada."
tesla,2017-3,"More broadly, the successful offering underscores the ability of Musk to convince Wall Street over and over of his long-term vision - that Tesla will someday become a carbon-free energy and transportation heavyweight."
tesla,2017-3,"Despite facing major financial hurdles, and the dilutive nature of stock sales, the triumphant offering confounds Tesla skeptics, who point to the loss-marking company's $42.37 billion market capitalization - greater than that of Nissan Motor Co Ltd <7201.T>, which reported a profit of $4.7 billion last year."
tesla,2017-3,Tesla's plan to spend $2 billion-$2.5 billion in the first half of 2017 in capital expenditures ahead of the July Model 3 launch left little cushion with $3.39 billion on the books in cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2016.

tesla,2017-3,"NEW YORK, March 16 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Tesla's capital raise is dangerously underpowered. The electric-car company run by Elon Musk will sell stock and notes worth a bit over $1 billion. Tesla is burning cash, and investing heavily to gear up for production of its upcoming Model 3. Unexpectedly small dilution pleases investors, but may miss the more important goal of capital sufficiency."
tesla,2017-3,"Tesla has shown it can make beautiful cars and build a rabid fan base, but it has lost money three years in a row. The firm hopes production of its first mass-market vehicle, due to begin in July, will turn things around. At a cost of $35,000 before subsidies, the new model promises to kick-start demand. Tesla plans to produce 5,000 of the cars a week by year-end, and double that in 2018."
tesla,2017-3,"Yet Tesla has a habit of missing its goals. It will come as little surprise if the production timetable slips, the ramp-up in output proceeds more slowly and the vehicle ends up costing more than expected. There's also no assurance volume will result in a gusher of - or any - black ink."
tesla,2017-3,"- Tesla said on March 15 it will sell about 1 million shares and $750 million of convertible notes. If underwriters exercise their option to buy an additional 15 percent of each offering, the amount raised would be about $1.2 billion.

tesla,2017-3,"BERLIN, March 16 (Reuters) - Carmakers and suppliers gave widely differing timelines for the introduction of self-driving vehicles on Thursday, showing the uncertainties surrounding the technology as well as a split between cautious established players and bullish new entrants."
tesla,2017-3,"Chipmaker Nvidia , facing direct competition with the world's top chipmaker after Intel's $15 billion deal to buy autonomous driving technology firm Mobileye this week, gave the most optimistic predictions."
tesla,2017-3,Chief Executive Jen-Hsun Huang forecast carmakers may speed up their plans in the light of technological advances and that fully self-driving cars could be on the road by 2025.
tesla,2017-3,"""Because of deep learning, because of AI (artificial intelligence) computing, we've really supercharged our roadmap to autonomous vehicles,"" he said in a keynote speech to the Bosch Connected World conference in Berlin."
tesla,2017-3,"Germany's Bosch [ROBG.UL], however, the world's biggest automotive supplier, gave a timetable as much as six years longer to get to the final stage before fully autonomous vehicles, and declined even to forecast when a totally self-driving car might take to the streets."
tesla,2017-3,"Progress is fraught by issues including who is liable when a self-driving car has an accident, bringing down the costs of sensor technology and guarding against hacking."
tesla,2017-3,"""Of course, we still have to prove that an autonomous car does better in driving and has less accidents than a human being,"" Bosch CEO Volkmar Denner told a news conference."
tesla,2017-3,"Nvidia has applied its market-leading expertise in high-end computer graphics to the intense visualisation and simulation needs of autonomous cars, and has been working on artificial intelligence - teaching computers to learn to write their own software code - for a decade."
tesla,2017-3,"""No human could write enough code to capture the vast diversity and complexity that we do so easily, called driving,"" said Huang."
tesla,2017-3,"Together with Bosch executives, Huang presented a prototype AI on-board computer that is expected to go into production by the beginning of the next decade. The computer will use Nvidia's processing power to interpret data gathered by Bosch sensors."
tesla,2017-3,"On the way to fully self-driving cars, levels of autonomy have been defined, with most cars on the road today at level two and Tesla ready to switch from level four to five - full autonomy - as soon as it is permitted to do so."
tesla,2017-3,"Level three means drivers can turn away in well-understood environments such as motorway driving but must be ready to take back control, while level four means the automated system can control the vehicle in most environments."
tesla,2017-3,"Independent technology analyst Richard Windsor wrote in a note this week he doubted automakers would have autonomous vehicles leaving factories by a typical self-imposed deadline of 2020, mainly because the liability issue was unresolved."
tesla,2017-3,"""This is good news for the automotive industry which is notoriously slow to adapt to and implement new technology as it will have more time to defend its position against the new entrants,"" he wrote."
tesla,2017-3,"But Nvidia's Huang said he expected to have chips available for level three automated driving by the end of this year and in customers' cars on the road by the end of 2018, with level four chips following the same pattern a year later."

tesla,2017-3,{{20170315T020300.569+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-Tesla's surprise surge lights up China policy risk(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are her own.)
tesla,2017-3,"HONG KONG, March 15 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Tesla's recent China success puts the spotlight on fast-changing green car policies. The $42 billion electric carmaker unexpectedly tripled revenue last year in the People's Republic. The company has given no explanation for the sudden turnaround, but favourable policies in key cities may be a key factor."
tesla,2017-3,"Earlier this month, the Palo Alto-based group revealed that its 2016 sales in China topped $1.1 billion, accounting for 15 percent of the total. Tesla doesn't break out units by country, but JL Warren Capital estimates the automaker shipped almost 12,000 cars into the People's Republic last year, nearly five times the previous year."
tesla,2017-3,"In 2014, Chief Executive Elon Musk entered China with grand designs. The billionaire expected sales of his slick Model S sedans, which boasted superior battery technology over cheaper local models, would match those in the United States. But tepid sales, executive departures, and a slow ramp-up of retail stores and charging stations upset his aggressive plans for the world's largest car market."
tesla,2017-3,"China's pollution problem is helping to turn things around. In congested cities like Beijing and Shanghai, drivers pay steep prices and go through a lottery or competitive auction for a new licence plate. Green cars are exempt in certain areas. In the country's capital, 150,000 new plates were up for grabs last year; Beijing allocated 60,000 to ""new energy cars"" for free, double the amount in 2015. Five other cities have similar policies in place."
tesla,2017-3,"The risk is that Tesla's fortunes change as quickly as China's electric car policies. The government is phasing out generous subsidies and incentives for local carmakers from the Warren Buffet-backed BYD <002594.SZ> to the lesser-known Zotye. Likewise, cities could always choose to disqualify imported cars from its preferential licence plate treatment. Since Tesla makes all of its cars outside the People's Republic, such a move could see sales fall as quickly as they have risen."
tesla,2017-3,"Tesla's unique selling point in China is its premium brand. At over $100,000, the Model S has few direct peers in the electric vehicle market. As a luxury item, some customers will buy a Tesla whatever happens -- but it looks like many might just be there for the free licence plate ride."
tesla,2017-3,"- Tesla disclosed on March 1 in its annual report that revenue from China was $1.1 billion in 2016, up from $319 million the year before. China is now the company's second largest market by revenue, after the United States."
tesla,2017-3,"- Electric vehicle sales of both battery and plug-in hybrid cars in China hit 337,000 units in 2016, roughly 45 percent of the global total, according to data from Bernstein."

tesla,2017-3,"LAUNCESTON, Australia, March 14 (Reuters) - Australia is becoming an interesting microcosm on how to, or how not to, transition an economy from being predominantly powered by coal to more climate-friendly alternatives."
tesla,2017-3,"The dramatic intervention by Tesla Inc Chief Executive Elon Musk last week is just the latest twist in an ongoing saga that pits business, government, farmers, government and environmentalists against each other."
tesla,2017-3,"Musk, in an exchange of tweets with software billionaire Mike Cannon-Brookes, chief executive of Atlassian Corp, offered to fix the electricity supply problems of South Australia state within 100 days of signing a contract."
tesla,2017-3,"Musk's plan is to install 100 megawatts (MW) of grid-connected battery storage, which would be available to meet peak demand and would be charged with surplus electricity from other generating sources in periods of low demand."
tesla,2017-3,"It's a bold offer and would most likely provide a quick fix to Australia's fourth-largest state, which suffered a blackout last November and has been dealing with power shortages over the peak summer period."
tesla,2017-3,"Businesses like BHP Billiton , which operates the giant Olympic Dam copper mine in the state, have been pushing for the government and other stakeholders to ensure stable electricity supply, saying the cost of blackouts runs into millions of dollars in lost output."
tesla,2017-3,"Musk, whose Tesla Corp is ramping up output of its battery storage packs at its Gigafactory in Nevada, held talks with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull at the weekend, as well as with South Australian Premier Jay Weatherill."
tesla,2017-3,"The politicians will no doubt be tempted to Musk's offer to install batteries, especially since the electric car pioneer said if he didn't meet his 100 day deadline, he wouldn't charge anything."
tesla,2017-3,"But while Musk's offer, if taken up, would provide a quick fix, it would not do enough to mend the underlying problems at the heart of Australia's electricity woes."
tesla,2017-3,It's worth looking at how Australia got itself to the point where virtually all players can agree that the nation is facing something approaching an energy crisis.
tesla,2017-3,"After all, the country is not short of fossil fuels such as coal and natural gas, and its climate and low population density outside the major cities are ideal for renewables such as solar and wind power."
tesla,2017-3,"The country is heavily reliant on an ageing fleet of coal-fired power stations, which makes Australia one of the highest polluters per capita."
tesla,2017-3,"These coal power stations are starting to close down, with one shutting in South Australia last year and another planned to close in Victoria state at the end of this month."
tesla,2017-3,"The problem is that the coal-fired power stations' role as providers of base load electricity cannot be taken over by wind and solar, and the role is falling to natural gas."
tesla,2017-3,"But natural gas is also the most expensive method of generating electricity in Australia, so utilities are reluctant to run their gas-fired plants until prices are high enough to justify the cost."
tesla,2017-3,"South Australia has a gas-fired plant that was mothballed until last year's power supply crisis, but even with the higher prices for electricity, the operator is struggling to make the plant profitable."
tesla,2017-3,"The state moved on Tuesday to try and address its energy security issues, announcing it would build a 250 MW gas-fired plant and help the private sector build a 100 MW battery, at a total cost of A$510 million ($385 million). [nL3N1GQ32M]"
tesla,2017-3,"Natural gas supply is becoming a problem in Australia, which may seem ironic given the country is on the verge of becoming the world's largest exporter of liquefied natural gas (LNG) as the last of eight new plants come closer to completion."
tesla,2017-3,"In fact, the new LNG plants are copping some of the blame for the tightening natural gas market, especially the three in eastern Queensland state based on using coal-seam gas as the feedstock."
tesla,2017-3,These are being blamed for sucking domestic natural gas out of the market and into the export LNG industry.
tesla,2017-3,What hasn't helped is that some of Australia's state and territory governments are also pursuing policies that will restrict future natural gas supplies.
tesla,2017-3,"Victoria state has banned hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, as well as shale and coal-seam gas exploration, while the Northern Territory, New South Wales and Tasmania have various moratoriums on fracking."
tesla,2017-3,"This leaves Western Australia, Queensland and South Australia as the remaining states where onshore natural gas supplies can be developed, and they are now in the cross-hairs of the environmental lobby, which is opposed to any and all new natural gas wells."
tesla,2017-3,"Politicians across the traditional Labor-Liberal divide are increasingly giving in to demands to restrict natural gas exploration, while pretending that this won't have a negative impact on energy security and electricity prices."
tesla,2017-3,"But the costs are starting to become apparent, with spot electricity prices surging over the Australian summer and natural gas suppliers warning that they will be unable to meet the needs of industrial customers without action being taken."
tesla,2017-3,"It's often the case politicians only take action when the point of crisis is reached, and this appears to be the case in Australia."
tesla,2017-3,What's needed is a holistic approach to energy supply as Australia transitions away from coal-fired power.
tesla,2017-3,"This means ensuring enough natural gas is available to provide base load generation, while scaling up renewables such as solar, wind, pumped hydro and battery storage."
tesla,2017-3,"Forging enough common ground with the various stakeholders will be the main obstacle, but more than anything else, Australia is showing how difficult it is to end the age of coal."

tesla,2017-3,"JERUSALEM/DETROIT, March 13 (Reuters) - Intel Corp agreed to buy Israeli autonomous vehicle technology firm Mobileye for $15.3 billion on Monday in a deal that could thrust the U.S. chipmaker into direct competition with rivals Nvidia Corp and Qualcomm Inc to develop driverless systems for global automakers."
tesla,2017-3,The pricey acquisition of Mobileye could propel the world's largest computer chipmaker into the front ranks of automotive suppliers at a time when Intel has been reaching for market beyond its core computer semiconductor business.
tesla,2017-3,"It also promises to escalate the arms race among the world's carmakers and suppliers to acquire autonomous vehicle technology, and could fuel already-overheated valuations of self-driving start-ups."
tesla,2017-3,"The stakes are enormous. Last year, Goldman Sachs projected the market for advanced driver assistance systems and autonomous vehicles would grow from about $3 billion in 2015 to $96 billion in 2025 and $290 billion in 2035."
tesla,2017-3,"Skeptics have questioned whether auto companies and suppliers will be able to deploy fully self-driving cars safely in the next four years, as several have promised. Investment analysts on Monday raised concerns about the potential synergies between Intel and Mobileye, as well as the acquisition's price."
tesla,2017-3,"Intel has not been a significant player in the sector, although it has invested in at least half a dozen start-up companies developing different components for self-driving systems, from robotics to sensors."
tesla,2017-3,"Mobileye brings a broad portfolio that includes cameras, sensor chips, in-car networking, roadway mapping, machine learning, cloud software and data fusion and management."
tesla,2017-3,"""This is a tremendous opportunity for them to get into a market that has significant growth opportunities,"" said Betsy Van Hees, an analyst at Loop Capital Markets. ""Mobileye's technology is very critical... The price seems fair,"" she added."
tesla,2017-3,"Still, the industry newsletter Semiconductor Advisors on Monday wrote that Intel's acquisition of Mobileye indicates a strategic move ""very far outside its core business franchise."""
tesla,2017-3,"The price is about 21 times expected 2017 revenue, making it more than six times more expensive than the semiconductor industry's three-year deal average, said B. Riley analyst Craig Ellis. He said the ""very expensive transaction"" improved Intel's position in the automated driver assistance market, but left Nvidia the leader on the highest end."
tesla,2017-3,"Intel is paying a premium of 60 times Mobileye's earnings, about four times the premium that Qualcomm is paying to acquire the Netherlands' NXP."
tesla,2017-3,"The $63.54-per-share cash deal represents a premium of about 33 percent to Mobileye's closing price of $47 on Friday, but below its all-time high closing price of $64.14 in August 2015."
tesla,2017-3,"Mobileye's shares rose 28.2 percent to close at $60.62, while Intel's shares were down 2.1 percent."
tesla,2017-3,"The market for self-driving technology is becoming crowded, including mapping company Here, as well as technology companies ranging from Alphabet Inc's Waymo to Chinese Internet giant Baidu Inc ."
tesla,2017-3,"Shares of systems integrator Delphi Automotive PLC , which has partnerships with Intel and Mobileye, rose 4.0 percent. Delphi said in a statement that it expected the deal would let it accelerate adoption of new technologies."

tesla,2017-3,"LONDON, March 10 (Reuters) - Investors hoping for explosive nickel demand growth, in tandem with the electric vehicle revolution, could well be disappointed as any increase is seen as unlikely to change a market dominated by stainless steel producers."
tesla,2017-3,"Some watching the frenzy of interest in battery materials such as lithium and cobalt say nickel is due its turn in the spotlight given its use in batteries to power EVs, seen as a way of reducing air pollution and meeting emissions targets."
tesla,2017-3,"However, the amounts used in these batteries at between 7 and 18 kgs are small; by 2025 nickel usage in these batteries is likely to amount to less than 100,000 tonnes, a fraction of global demand."
tesla,2017-3,"Notably, Glencore Chief Executive Ivan Glasenberg said in December demand for nickel could reach 400,000 tonnes should electric vehicles reach 10 percent of the global fleet, enough to cause a supply deficit."
tesla,2017-3,"However, out of 89 million cars sold last year roughly one percent or only about 1.1 million were electric or plug-in hybrid vehicles. Consultants expect EV and PHEV sales to rise to more than six million units by 2025, which would amount to around six percent of global car sales."
tesla,2017-3,"Translated into nickel demand that could amount to an extra 97,000 tonnes, according to Cairn Energy Research Advisors."
tesla,2017-3,"That number chimes with an estimate from consultants Roskill, which sees nickel demand growth from battery producers for EVs to rise between 12.6 and 19.5 percent a year to between 51,000 and 93,000 tonnes by 2025."
tesla,2017-3,"""EVs/batteries will become more important for nickel in future, but will not become nickel's dominant use (unlike cobalt or lithium),"" said Robert Baylis, managing director of consultancy Roskill."

tesla,2017-3,"LOS ANGELES, March 9 (Reuters) - New U.S. solar installations nearly doubled last year, but slowing demand for both residential and large-scale systems, falling panel prices and concerns about looming federal tax reform are still dampening investor appetite for the sector."
tesla,2017-3,"Solar installations soared 97 percent to 14.8 gigawatts in 2016, according to a report released on Thursday by Wood Mackenzie and the Solar Energy Industries Association. The technology is cheaper than ever, with panel prices dropping 40 percent last year, and many utilities procuring solar on the basis of cost alone."
tesla,2017-3,"But the dramatic drop in panel prices has hampered solar manufacturers' profits and ramped up competition for utility-scale contracts among developers, companies said in recent weeks while reporting fourth-quarter results. Add in a slowdown in the residential market, tax reform pushed by U.S. President Donald Trump, climbing interest rates and falling oil prices, and stock market investors remain skittish about solar."
tesla,2017-3,"Credit Suisse analyst Andrew Hughes said in a client note on Thursday that the key risk to his ""outperform"" rating on shares of residential solar player Sunrun was ""investor sentiment, which in a rising interest rate and falling oil price market obscured by tax policy uncertainty remains tepid."""

tesla,2017-3,"Indeed, the solar industry report released on Thursday forecasts a slowdown in the market this year after last year's boom. Utility systems accounted for more than 10.5 GW of the total in 2016, but are not expected to exeed 10 GW again until 2021, the report said."
tesla,2017-3,"The 2016 boom was largely due to a rush by developers to claim a federal tax credit for solar systems that had been expected to expire at the end of the year. The five-year extension of that credit, however, has allowed projects to be pushed into this year and beyond."
tesla,2017-3,"Though Trump has not called for ending tax credits for solar and other renewable energy, he has expressed doubts about the role of clean power sources.[nL8N1DO4YB]"
tesla,2017-3,"On the solar residential side, installations grew 19 percent to 2.6 GW last year, down from 66 percent growth in 2015. Growth has slowed in major markets like California, where many of the households most interested in solar have already put up panels."
tesla,2017-3,"Tesla Inc , which acquired residential market leader SolarCity late last year, said last month that it deployed 201 megawatts of solar in the fourth quarter, a more than 20 percent drop from the same period a year earlier."
tesla,2017-3,"SolarCity rival Sunrun reported a quarterly profit that topped Wall Street estimates due to cost cuts, but said growth would be subtantially slower in 2016. System deployments rose 40 percent in 2016, but are expected to rise just 15 percent this year, Sunrun said."

tesla,2017-3,"WASHINGTON, March 8 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump met with business leaders on Wednesday including Tesla Inc Chief Executive Elon Musk and real estate developers, as the administration seeks partnerships with the private sector to boost infrastructure spending."
tesla,2017-3,"During his presidential campaign, Trump said he would push for a $1 trillion infrastructure program to rebuild roads, bridges, airports and other public works projects, but he has not presented a specific plan. [nL1N1G2120]"
tesla,2017-3,"White House spokesman Sean Spicer said ""strong public-private partnerships"" would be key to rebuilding the nation's roads, bridges and airports."
tesla,2017-3,"""Infrastructure used to be a point of American pride, but now an overbearing, ineffective regulatory system can keep projects in limbo for years,"" Spicer said. ""The government has wasted too much of the taxpayers' money on inefficient and misguided projects."""
tesla,2017-3,"The White House sees infrastructure as a potential large job creator but officials have said the federal government cannot shoulder the entire burden. The administration is looking at toll roads, tax credits and other ways to spur private investment."
tesla,2017-3,"Major real estate and private equity executives attended the meeting, including developer Richard LeFrak, Vornado Realty Trust Chief Executive Officer Steve Roth, and Apollo Global Management co-founder Josh Harris, the White House said."
tesla,2017-3,"LeFrak and Roth have been tapped to lead an infrastructure council that Trump plans to create, a spokesman for LeFrak had previously said."
tesla,2017-3,The lunch with the CEOs follows his meeting on Tuesday with AFL-CIO union President Rich Trumka to talk infrastructure and other issues. The White House held a meeting of 15 federal agencies last Thursday to begin work on the administration's infrastructure plan.
tesla,2017-3,"Last month, Trump touted the infrastructure plan in an address to Congress."
tesla,2017-3,"""To launch our national rebuilding,"" he said, ""I will be asking Congress to approve legislation that produces a $1 trillion investment in infrastructure of the United States - financed through both public and private capital - creating millions of new jobs."" [nL2N1GE0B5]"
tesla,2017-3,"Edward Mortimer, a transportation expert at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, told a Senate panel on Wednesday that without action, the federal highway trust fund would face a serious shortfall starting in 2020, and policymakers would need to come up with $150 billion over six years to maintain current spending."
tesla,2017-3,"""This shortfall will likely result in significant uncertainty, with states possibly delaying major transportation projects,"" he said."
tesla,2017-3,"Wednesday's meeting included Vice President Mike Pence, Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, Energy Secretary Rick Perry and Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt, as well as General Atlantic CEO Bill Ford, McKinsey & Co partner Tyler Duvall and Nature Conservancy Managing Director Lynn Scarlett, the White House said."
tesla,2017-3,"Scarlett said in a statement that any infrastructure package should include ""natural"" solutions such as reefs, dunes and wetlands. Other participants in the meeting did not comment or respond to requests for comment."
tesla,2017-3,The American Society of Civil Engineers has graded U.S. infrastructure at D+ and estimated the country needs to invest $3.6 trillion by 2020.
tesla,2017-3,"In January, Trump signed an executive order aimed at expediting environmental reviews and approvals for all infrastructure projects, especially high-priority projects such as improving the U.S. electric grid and telecommunications systems and repairing and upgrading ""critical"" port facilities, airports, pipelines, bridges, and highways."

tesla,2017-3,{{20170307T164455.883+0000}}Ex-Tesla manager seeks $4 bln for Europe's biggest battery plant* Demand for electric car batteries seen surging
tesla,2017-3,"STOCKHOLM, March 7 (Reuters) - A former Tesla executive is trying to raise at least $4 billion to build Europe's biggest battery factory in Sweden to meet an expected surge in demand as the region's automakers switch to electric vehicles."
tesla,2017-3,"Peter Carlsson, who managed Tesla's supply chain before returning to his native country, believes European carmakers' push into electric propulsion implies demand for batteries that far exceeds anything now planned."
tesla,2017-3,"Some carmakers want to ramp up battery production in-house, wary of the dominance of Asian players such as Panasonic Corp <6752.T>, LG Chem <051910.KS, and China's CATL."
tesla,2017-3,"German company BMZ opened the first section of a battery plant last year while LG Chem is investing $339 million in a factory in Poland, both of which include the manufacture of the battery cells. [nL5N1CB1A2]"
tesla,2017-3,"Samsung SDI <006400.KS> has said it will start production of batteries for electric vehicles in Hungary in 2018, establishing an integrated production system ranging from battery cells to packs. [nL3N1BB2LY]"
tesla,2017-3,Carlsson's company Northvolt is looking to rival the scale of Elon Musk's Gigafactory in the Nevada desert - targeting annual cell production equivalent to 32 gigawatt hours when the plant hits full gear in 2023.
tesla,2017-3,"Production would be largely automated but the factory could potentially employ 2,500 to 3,000 skilled people. The site would use cheap renewable energy and could source some key battery ingredients such as nickel, cobalt and lithium from within the Nordic region."
tesla,2017-3,"While the Tesla Gigafactory began mass production this year in partnership with Japan's Panasonic [nL4N1EU41W], Northvolt has yet to identify a site for its project which would require investment of at least 4 billion euros ($4.2 billion) over six years."
tesla,2017-3,"""I am very optimistic that we can attract both industrial investors as well as institutional investors,"" Northvolt Chief Executive Peter Carlsson, a former head of supply chain at Tesla, said on the sidelines of a presentation."
tesla,2017-3,"""We hope to close the major investment in just over a year, but we have already begun talking to companies and institutions that could be leading players in the process."""
tesla,2017-3,So far a small group of investors including utility Vattenfall and Sweden's energy and innovation agencies have contributed funds allowing the firm to set up offices in central Stockholm and begin recruiting staff for the project.
tesla,2017-3,"Electrification has become a buzzword among automakers in recent years amid global concerns about climate change. Consultants CRU Group have said electric car and plug-in hybrid vehicle sales could hit 4.4 million in 2021 and more than six million by 2025, from 1.1 million last year. [nL5N1FO4KX]"
tesla,2017-3,"Apart from servicing the automotive sector, Northvolt also sees business in areas such as energy storage and heavy industrial machinery."
tesla,2017-3,"""We are not going to fill the plant only with automotive. Not because we don't think it is possible, but we don't think it is a good idea to depend heavily on one vertical, and only one,"" said Northvolt Chief Operating Officer Paolo Cerruti, who also worked for Tesla in the past."
tesla,2017-3,Carlsson said Northvolt had begun selecting a location for the plant and would start raising 50 million euros to fund a smaller-scale pilot line in the coming months.
tesla,2017-3,"Asked how Tesla chief Elon Musk viewed Northvolt's plans, Carlsson said: ""We are not competing with Tesla because they are not going to sell batteries, but we do share a very strong vision which is that it is hugely important to accelerate our society away from its addiction to fossil fuels."""

tesla,2017-3,"Global demand for gasoline, which accounts for more than a quarter of the world's oil consumption, is set to peak as early as 2021 even in the face of relentless growth in the vehicle fleet, according to the Edinburgh-based consultancy."
tesla,2017-3,"A rise in the number of hybrid and electric cars such as the Nissan <7201.T> Leaf, Toyota <7203.T> Prius and Tesla as well as tighter fuel standards in Europe and the United States will contribute to a historic shift in consumption."
tesla,2017-3,"The United States saw spectacular growth in gasoline demand following the collapse in oil prices in 2014 and as its economy recovered from the 2008 financial crisis, reaching a record high of 9.326 million barrels per day last year. [nL2N1GD1E1]"
tesla,2017-3,"""We expect gasoline engine efficiency to continue to improve through better deployment of batteries in hybrid vehicles,"" WoodMac analyst Alan Gelder said."

tesla,2017-3,"The decline in U.S. and European gasoline consumption will mask a steady expansion in demand in Asia, where most of the global increase in the vehicle fleet will take place."

tesla,2017-3,"""We still see global oil demand growing but the role of transportation shrinks,"" Gelder said."

tesla,2017-3,{{20170301T235213.431+0000}}Solar companies agree on deal with Arizona's biggest utilityMarch 1 (Reuters) - Solar installation companies and Arizona's largest utility said on Wednesday that they had reached a long-sought deal under which new rooftop solar systems would be compensated at a lower rate for the energy they send to the grid.
tesla,2017-3,"The settlement agreement between Arizona Public Service, a division of Pinnacle West Capital Corp , and solar installers including Sunrun Inc , must be approved by state utility regulator the Arizona Corporation Commission."
tesla,2017-3,"Sunrun said the deal would enable it to continue to do business in the state, but said it should not be a model for other states."
tesla,2017-3,"""We still think that the settlement doesn't fully value solar,"" Sunrun vice president of public policy Alex McDonough said in an interview."
tesla,2017-3,"Under the deal, new solar systems will receive 12.9 cents per kilowatt-hour for the excess electricity sent back to the utility. Previously, they had received the full retail rate, which in Arizona ranges from 13 cents to 14 cents, according to Sunrun. The bill credit for excess energy, a policy known as net metering, is key to making an investment in solar panels work financially."
tesla,2017-3,"Last year, Nevada scrapped its net metering policy, prompting solar installers including Sunrun and Tesla's SolarCity to abandon doing business in the state."
tesla,2017-3,"APS customers will also be able to choose between a rate structure that varies depending on the time of day, or on a traditional structure that includes a charge calculated based on a household's electricity demand. The solar industry had fought a mandatory ""demand charge"" for customers."
tesla,2017-3,"Broadly speaking, incentives for rooftop solar have become less generous as the cost of solar panels has declined, ushering in dramatic industry growth."
tesla,2017-3,"Utilities have argued that as more customers go solar, it leaves the burden of maintaining their systems on a smaller number of customers. Solar advocates, however, have said that increased levels of rooftop solar allow utilities to avoid making major new investments in their distribution systems that would cause rates to rise."

tesla,2017-3,"The contraction in its workforce marked a sharp reversal from the company's explosive growth in previous years. In 2015, the number of SolarCity employees swelled by 68.7 percent."
tesla,2017-3,"SolarCity, founded by the first cousins of Tesla founder Elon Musk, rose rapidly to become the nation's top rooftop solar installer thanks to innovative no-money-down financing schemes and a vast sales operation. The company at one time had bold ambitions of having 1 million customers by 2018, but began scaling back its plans at the end of 2015 as costs for funding that growth mounted and demand began to slow."
tesla,2017-3,"By the middle of 2016, SolarCity had agreed to be acquired by Tesla, which said last month it was cutting spending on solar advertising in part by preparing to sell rooftop systems in Tesla's network of retail stores."
tesla,2017-3,The company is also shifting to more cash sales of systems instead of leases in order to generate cash and deliver the cost savings it promised investors would come from the acquisition.
tesla,2017-3,"Also in the annual filing, SolarCity said sales and marketing expenses fell 3 percent in 2016, in part due to staff cuts and efforts to boost sales efficiency."

tesla,2017-3,"DETROIT, Feb 28 (Reuters) - California-based Starsky Robotics said on Tuesday it has a solution to on- and off-highway deliveries by self-driving trucks, including the ""last mile"" issue for how a driverless vehicle will deliver cargo at its final destination."
tesla,2017-3,"In an interview, Starsky founder and Chief Executive Stefan Seltz-Axmacher said the company's goal is to employ robotics, sensors and software to ""make trucks completely driverless."""
tesla,2017-3,"The trucking industry is keenly following efforts to automate various aspects of big trucks, in part to address highway safety concerns as well as the growing shortage of skilled drivers. As with self-driving cars, federal and state regulators have not finalized new rules covering self-driving trucks."
tesla,2017-3,"Other startups, while developing similar self-driving systems, have said they plan to keep a ""safety"" driver in the vehicle, even when in autonomous driving mode."
tesla,2017-3,"""Our remote drivers will pilot trucks from the door of the distribution center to the highway, then remotely engage the autonomous system,"" Seltz-Axmacher said. ""When the truck gets close to the off-ramp, another remote driver will take control of the vehicle"" to its final destination."
tesla,2017-3,"Seltz-Axmacher said Starsky already has begun testing its system and expects to ""remove human drivers from certain vehicles by the end of the year."""
tesla,2017-3,"Both Starsky and Embark Technologies -- the former Varden Labs which came out of stealth last Friday -- are funded mainly by venture capital firms, many of them based in Silicon Valley."
tesla,2017-3,"Starsky and Embark follow Peloton Technology, another Silicon Valley startup focused on self-driving trucks. Founded in 2011 and based in Mountain View, Peloton is funded in part by Swedish heavy truck maker Volvo AB and logistics giant United Parcel Service ."
tesla,2017-3,"Those startups could wind up competing with Tesla Inc , whose Chief Executive Elon Musk has said he plans to expand Tesla's product range to include self-driving trucks and buses. [nL4N1A64D7]"
tesla,2017-3,"Last week, another self-driving truck startup was at the center of a lawsuit filed by Google parent Alphabet Inc , whose Waymo self-driving car unit accused ride services startup Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] and its autonomous trucking subsidiary Otto of trade theft. [nL1N1G82FO]"
tesla,2017-3,"Uber acquired Otto, founded by two former Google executives, last summer."
tesla,2017-3,"WASHINGTON, Feb 28 (Reuters) - German automakers dominated Consumer Reports' annual ranking of automotive brands released on Tuesday, with Volkswagen AG's Audi leading the pack, while U.S. brands continued to lag despite gains for many."
tesla,2017-3,"Jake Fisher, director of auto testing at the magazine, said German automakers rose largely due to improvements in reliability. ""Building one or two great vehicles is achievable, but making a whole lineup of excellent ones is much more difficult,"" Fisher said."
tesla,2017-3,"Volkswagen's Porsche unit and rival BMW AG came in second and third. General Motors Co's Buick brand was the highest-ranked U.S. brand in 10th, down from seventh in 2016, while Ford Motor Co's Lincoln brand was 15th, up from 17th. The Ford brand fell from 16th to 21th."
tesla,2017-3,GM's Chevrolet brand moved up to 17th from 20th and its Cadillac brand moved up to 18th from 24th.
tesla,2017-3,"Toyota Motor Corp's <7203.T> flagship brand fell from eighth to 11th place, falling out of the top 10 for the first time in recent years, after the magazine said its Tacoma pickup had reliability issues. Toyota's luxury Lexus unit fell from third to fourth."
tesla,2017-3,"Fuji Heavy Industries' <7270.T> Subaru unit fell from second to fifth, while Korean auto brand Kia jumped to sixth, up five spots, followed by Mazda Motor Corp <7261.T> in seventh."
tesla,2017-3,Tesla Inc was ranked eighth among auto brands after previously not having enough models to be ranked. The California automaker was followed by Honda Motor Co's <7267.T> namesake brand in ninth.
tesla,2017-3,"GM's Chevrolet Cruze was named best compact car, while its Impala won best large sedan."
tesla,2017-3,"Other top picks included the Honda Ridgeline as best compact pickup, Kia Optima best midsized sedan and Audi Q7 best luxury SUV."
tesla,2017-3,"Nissan Motor Co's <7201.T> luxury Infiniti brand moved up six spots to 16, while its Nissan brand fell one spot to 22."
tesla,2017-3,Some German automakers struggled. The Volkswagen brand fell eight spots to 23rd and Daimler's Mercedes-Benz fell six spots to 20th.
tesla,2017-3,"The Fiat brand remained last again among all brands rated, and FCA's Jeep brand remained second-lowest overall. Consumer Reports does not recommend any Fiat Chrysler vehicles, while it recommends all Porsche, Mazda and BMW vehicles."
tesla,2017-3,"Fisher said Fiat Chrysler models suffered from serious reliability problems and are ""not competitive"" in most segments. The non-profit magazine has more than 8 million subscribers and surveys hundreds of thousands of car owners. Many shoppers consult the ratings, and automakers routinely tout favorable ratings in advertising."
