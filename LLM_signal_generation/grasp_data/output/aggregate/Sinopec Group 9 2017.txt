Sinopec Group,2017-9,* Glencore looking to bring in partner for the stake - source
Sinopec Group,2017-9,"LONDON, Oct 6 (Reuters) - Commodities trader and miner Glencore has swooped in to replace China's Sinopec as the buyer of Chevron's South African and Botswana assets after reaching a deal with local investors."
Sinopec Group,2017-9,"The assets include a 100,000 barrel-per-day oil refinery in Cape Town, a lubricants plant in Durban as well as 820 petrol stations and other oil storage facilities. It also includes 220 convenience stores across South Africa and Botswana."
Sinopec Group,2017-9,"In its statement on Friday, Glencore said it had agreed to buy Chevron's 75 percent stake in its South African subsidiary and its Botswana interests for a combined $973 million. The remaining 25 percent stake will stay with a consortium of Black Economic Empowerment shareholders and an employee trust."
Sinopec Group,2017-9,An industry source familiar with Glencore's mergers and acquisitions activities said the company was looking to bring in a partner.
Sinopec Group,2017-9,A spokesman for Chevron said the company does not comment on commercial matters. Sinopec did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Sinopec Group,2017-9,Glencore stepped in after local shareholders exercised pre-emption rights following delays to the Sinopec deal.
Sinopec Group,2017-9,"In March, Chevron announced that it had agreed the sale of its assets to China's largest refiner Sinopec <600028.SS>, <0386.HK> for nearly $1 billion. As of May, the deal had been under review by South Africa's Economic Development ministry. [nL3N1GZ3PH][nL8N1IR3QG]"
Sinopec Group,2017-9,Glencore was among the bidders for the stake last year along with oil major Total and rival trading house Gunvor. [nL8N1CU16Z]
Sinopec Group,2017-9,The stake was of keen interest to many oil traders as the retail network is one of the biggest in South Africa and it provides access to strategic storage in Saldanha Bay on the southwestern coast.
Sinopec Group,2017-9,Chevron along with other oil majors have announced a flurry of downstream sales in the last few years to trim costs after global oil prices slumped in 2014.
Sinopec Group,2017-9,"Chevron, which has had a presence in South Africa for more than a century, announced the sale in January 2016."
Sinopec Group,2017-9,Nimbler oil trading firms have snapped up the unwanted oil refineries and retail stations particularly in industrialising nations such as South Africa where young populations and a fast-growing middle class are expected to boost fuel demand. [nL5N1GN28P]
Sinopec Group,2017-9,Glencore has shifted in the last year from shedding interests during the 2015-2016 commodities downturn to asset-buying since the rebound in prices. [nL5N1KM2XJ]
Sinopec Group,2017-9,"The deal, which will include Glencore retaining Chevron's local management team and workforce, will be funded using existing cash resources and is expected to close in mid-2018."
Sinopec Group,2017-9,"""Glencore intends to manage its overall oil asset portfolio to ensure that, including this transaction, net additional capital investment is limited to less than $500 million over the next 12 months,"" it said."
Sinopec Group,2017-9,"If the deal closes, this would be Glencore's first refining asset. It began expanding into downstream oil in May after setting up a retail franchise in Mexico. [nL8N1IK1R8]"

Sinopec Group,2017-9,"SINGAPORE/JAKARTA, Sept 4 (Reuters) - Indonesia's Pertamina [PERTM.UL] has received a license from the government to export gasoil for the first time, three sources close to the matter said on Monday, although the state oil company is planning to prioritize domestic sales if possible."
Sinopec Group,2017-9,"Pertamina is typically an importer of gasoil, as diesel is called in most Asian markets, but inbound shipments have declined over the years as it ramped up refining output and demand from the mining sector slowed."
Sinopec Group,2017-9,"With other gasoil sellers - such as Royal Dutch Shell , Exxon Mobil Corp and Solaris Prima Energy - crowding into the retail market, and an increased biodiesel mandate in 2016 reducing conventional consumption, Pertamina's supply of the fuel has also outperformed demand, said Toharso, director of refineries at Pertamina, who goes by one name."
Sinopec Group,2017-9,"If Pertamina exports its surplus fuel, it would help ease supply tightness in Asia caused by Tropical Storm Harvey, which drove up the Asian gasoil margins to a one-and-a-half month high, traders said. [nL4N1LG30C] [nL8N1LH44K]"
Sinopec Group,2017-9,"The company, though, is also taking steps to sell more gasoil into its domestic market by asking the government to grant it a monopoly on diesel imports, which would force the other retailers to buy from Pertamina."
Sinopec Group,2017-9,"The state oil company received the gasoil export license two to three weeks ago, and it is developing a standard operating procedure on how to export the cargoes, the sources said."
Sinopec Group,2017-9,"Still, ""we will try our best to sell in the domestic market,"" Toto Nugroho, senior vice president at Pertamina for integrated supply chain, told Reuters."
Sinopec Group,2017-9,"But if market competition means storage inventories build up, ""the last resort is to export,"" he said."
Sinopec Group,2017-9,Pertamina declined to give details on possible export volumes or a timeline of shipments.
Sinopec Group,2017-9,"Pertamina supplies about 70 percent of Indonesia's gasoil needs, while private firms supply the rest, Toharso said."
Sinopec Group,2017-9,"Many of the private firms import their gasoil, but Pertamina is lobbying Jakarta to name it the country's exclusive importer of the fuel, a move that would alleviate the state oil company's surplus and possibly negate its need to export the fuel."

Sinopec Group,2017-9,"SINGAPORE/JAKARTA, Sept 4 (Reuters) - Indonesia's Pertamina [PERTM.UL] has received a license from the government to export gasoil for the first time, three sources close to the matter said on Monday, although the state oil company is planning to prioritize domestic sales if possible."
Sinopec Group,2017-9,"Pertamina is typically an importer of gasoil, as diesel is called in most Asian markets, but inbound shipments have declined over the years as it ramped up refining output and demand from the mining sector slowed."
Sinopec Group,2017-9,"With other gasoil sellers - such as Royal Dutch Shell , Exxon Mobil Corp and Solaris Prima Energy - crowding into the retail market, and an increased biodiesel mandate in 2016 reducing conventional consumption, Pertamina's supply of the fuel has also outperformed demand, said Toharso, director of refineries at Pertamina, who goes by one name."
Sinopec Group,2017-9,"If Pertamina exports its surplus fuel, it would help ease supply tightness in Asia caused by Tropical Storm Harvey, which drove up the Asian gasoil margins to a one-and-a-half month high, traders said. [nL4N1LG30C] [nL8N1LH44K]"
Sinopec Group,2017-9,"The company, though, is also taking steps to sell more gasoil into its domestic market by asking the government to grant it a monopoly on diesel imports, which would force the other retailers to buy from Pertamina."
Sinopec Group,2017-9,"The state oil company received the gasoil export license two to three weeks ago, and it is developing a standard operating procedure on how to export the cargoes, the sources said."
Sinopec Group,2017-9,"Still, ""we will try our best to sell in the domestic market,"" Toto Nugroho, senior vice president at Pertamina for integrated supply chain, told Reuters."
Sinopec Group,2017-9,"But if market competition means storage inventories build up, ""the last resort is to export,"" he said."
Sinopec Group,2017-9,Pertamina declined to give details on possible export volumes or a timeline of shipments.
