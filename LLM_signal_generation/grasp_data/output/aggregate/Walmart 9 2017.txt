walmart,2017-9,"WASHINGTON, Sept 27 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump proposed on Wednesday the biggest U.S. tax overhaul in three decades, calling for tax cuts for most Americans, but prompting criticism that the plan favors business and the rich and could add trillions of dollars to the deficit."
walmart,2017-9,"The proposal drew a swift, skeptical response from Senator Bob Corker, a leading Republican ""fiscal hawk,"" who vowed not to vote for any federal tax package financed with borrowed money."
walmart,2017-9,"""What I can tell you is that I'm not about to vote for any bill that increases our deficit, period,"" Corker, who said on Tuesday he would not seek re-election in 2018, told reporters."
walmart,2017-9,"Trump said his tax plan was aimed at helping working people, creating jobs and making the tax code simpler and fairer. But it faces an uphill battle in the U.S. Congress with Trump's own Republican Party divided over it and Democrats hostile."
walmart,2017-9,"The plan would lower corporate and small-business income tax rates, reduce the top income tax rate for high-earning American individuals and scrap some popular tax breaks, including one that benefits people in high-tax states dominated by Democrats."
walmart,2017-9,"Forged during months of talks among Trump's aides and top congressional Republicans, the plan contained few details on how to pay for the tax cuts without expanding the budget deficit and adding to the nation's $20 trillion national debt."
walmart,2017-9,"The plan still must be turned into legislation, which was not expected until after Congress makes progress on the fiscal 2018 budget, perhaps in October. It must then be debated by the Republican-led congressional tax-writing committees."
walmart,2017-9,"Analysts were skeptical that Congress could approve a tax bill this year, but that is what Republicans hope to achieve so they can enter next year's congressional election campaigns with at least one legislative achievement to show for 2017."

walmart,2017-9,"At an event in Indianapolis, Trump called the plan the largest tax cut in U.S. history. ""We want tax reform that is pro-growth, pro-jobs, pro-worker, pro-family and, yes, tax reform that is pro-American,"" he said."
walmart,2017-9,"The real estate mogul-turned-politician, who promised big tax cuts as a candidate, told reporters he personally would not gain financially from the proposal."
walmart,2017-9,"""I think there's very little benefit for people of wealth,"" said Trump, who unlike many of his White House predecessors, has refused to make public his own tax returns."
walmart,2017-9,"Republicans have produced no major legislative successes since Trump took office in January, even though they control the White House and both chambers of Congress. Their top legislative priority, overhauling the U.S. healthcare system, collapsed again in the Senate on Tuesday."
walmart,2017-9,A comprehensive rewrite of the U.S. tax code has eluded previous presidents and Congress for decades. The last one was passed in 1986 under Republican President Ronald Reagan.
walmart,2017-9,"Trump's plan falls short of the sweeping, bipartisan package crafted by Reagan and congressional Democrats, analysts said."
walmart,2017-9,"The White House said that, under the proposal, typical middle-class families would have less income subject to federal tax. Trump said the first $12,000 earned by an individual and the first $24,000 by a married couple would be tax-free."
walmart,2017-9,"The plan would lower the top individual tax rate, paid by the nation's top earners, to 35 percent from 39.6 percent."
walmart,2017-9,"It would lower the top corporate income tax rate to 20 percent from the current 35 percent. The existing rate is high globally, but many U.S.-based multinationals pay much less than the headline rate because of abundant loopholes and tax breaks."

walmart,2017-9,Republicans hold a thin 52-48 Senate majority and may need some Democratic support to win passage. But Democrats said the plan would expand the federal deficit in order to deliver tax cuts to wealthy Americans rather than the middle-class families that Trump and Republicans say they are trying to help.

walmart,2017-9,"Republican Kevin Brady, chairman of the tax-writing House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee, said he expected tax legislation to be passed by the end of this year."
walmart,2017-9,"The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a Washington-based policy group, estimated on Wednesday the plan contained about $5.8 trillion of total tax cuts over a decade and would have a net cost of $2.2 trillion through 2027."
walmart,2017-9,Analysts have warned huge tax cuts would balloon the deficit if economic growth projected by Republicans to offset the costs fails to materialize amid rising interest rates.
walmart,2017-9,"The plan would set a new 25 percent tax rate for ""pass-through"" businesses, which are usually small, private enterprises, such as partnerships and sole proprietorships. They represent about 95 percent of all U.S. businesses."
walmart,2017-9,"Under current law, the profits of those companies ""pass through"" directly to their owners and are taxed as personal income, often at the top 39.6 percent individual income rate."

walmart,2017-9,"The rise of privately-owned budget chains Aldi [ALDIEI.UL] and Lidl [LIDUK.UL] has transformed the competitive landscape of UK food retailing over the last decade, driving down the returns of Britain's big four players - market leader Tesco , Sainsbury's , Asda and Morrisons ."
walmart,2017-9,"The big four have been fighting back by cutting their own prices, reducing multi-buy promotions and improving service."
walmart,2017-9,"For 2016, Aldi UK and Ireland reported a 13.5 percent rise in sales to a record 8.74 billion pounds ($11.8 billion)."

walmart,2017-9,"In the latest sign of distress that has ripped through traditional brick-and-mortar retailers, sources said late on Friday that Toys ""R"" Us was working to put together a loan to fund its operations in a potential Chapter 11 filing. [nL2N1LX015]"

walmart,2017-9,"{{20170914T153146.912+0000}}UPDATE 4-Slower sales growth dents Morrisons shares despite profit rise* Turnaround remains on track, says CEO"
walmart,2017-9,"LONDON, Sept 14 (Reuters) - Slowing sales growth at Morrisons sent its shares down as much as 7 percent on Thursday, despite rising profit and its chief executive saying the British supermarket chain's turnaround is on track."
walmart,2017-9,CEO David Potts said Morrisons was making progress in its supermarkets and beyond as results showed a seventh straight quarter of underlying sales growth.
walmart,2017-9,"Morrisons, based in Bradford, northern England, is turning around its more than 500 UK stores while also pursuing online and wholesale markets."
walmart,2017-9,"That plan had driven a 27 percent rise in its shares over the past year, making Morrisons one of the most expensive stocks in the sector on a price/earnings (PE) basis."
walmart,2017-9,"But the shares were down 5.3 percent to 232 pence by 15.22 GMT, with some analysts disappointed that like-for-like sales had risen only 2.6 percent in the second quarter after a rise of 3.4 percent in the first. Others had hoped for a full-year profit upgrade or hints of future special dividends."
walmart,2017-9,"""We don't read anything into it,"" Potts said of the slowdown, pointing out shopper numbers were up 3.9 percent, while finance chief Trevor Strain said it was a strong performance given the market context."
walmart,2017-9,"Potts, a former executive at market leader Tesco , joined Morrisons in 2015 to lead a recovery after it was hurt by the rise of German discounters Aldi and Lidl in its northern heartland and mis-steps by previous management."
walmart,2017-9,"He has overseen a steady improvement in trading, with more competitive prices, improved product ranges and availability as well as better customer service in refurbished stores."
walmart,2017-9,"Potts has also overhauled the company's online strategy through a renegotiated agreement with distributor Ocado and struck wholesale supply deals with Amazon , Rontec petrol forecourts and the McColl's convenience chain."
walmart,2017-9,"""We're holding our own as we fix our supermarket business and then look ahead to growing into bigger markets,"" Potts said."
walmart,2017-9,"Morrisons, which trails Tesco, Sainsbury's and Wal-Mart's Asda in annual sales, made an underlying pretax profit of 177 million pounds ($234 million) in the six months to July 30, in line with analysts' expectations and up nearly 13 percent from the same period last year."
walmart,2017-9,"Prior to Thursday's update, analysts' average forecast for 2017/18 pretax profit was 371 million pounds, up 10 percent from the previous year's result but still a long way from the heady 935 million pound profit achieved in 2011/12."
walmart,2017-9,"Morrisons increased its ""medium term"" target for incremental profit from wholesale, services and online operations to between 75 million pounds and 125 million pounds, from 50-100 million pounds previously."
walmart,2017-9,"The group forecast total wholesale sales to all its partners would exceed 700 million pounds by the end of 2018 and more than 1 billion pounds ""in due course""."
walmart,2017-9,"Potts said that Morrisons is ""learning to manage"" inflation as imported food prices are driven higher by a weaker pound and he expected it to start to ""taper down"" beyond this year."
walmart,2017-9,Morrisons also cut net debt to 932 million pounds -- below its 1 billion pound year-end target -- and raised its interim dividend 5.1 percent to 1.66 pence. ($1 = 0.7576 pounds)

walmart,2017-9,"MEXICO CITY, Sept 13 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc is preparing to open a 1 million square-foot warehouse near Mexico City, sources familiar with the project said, part of an effort to boost its presence in Mexico's nascent e-commerce industry."
walmart,2017-9,"The new warehouse is slated to be built in the Tepotzotlan municipality about 25 miles (40 km) north of the Mexican capital, according to four Mexico City real estate professionals familiar with the plans. Expected to be completed next year, the facility would triple Amazon's distribution space in Mexico, home to around 120 million potential customers."

walmart,2017-9,"Amazon is a relative newcomer to Mexico; it opened its Kindle e-books site to Mexican customers in 2013 and expanded into sales of physical goods just two years ago. But it is growing much faster than rivals such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc , and is already the nation's third-largest online retailer. Amazon posted $253 million in sales in Mexico last year, more than double the year before, according to market research firm Euromonitor International."
walmart,2017-9,"Sharing a nearly 2,000-mile long border with the United States, Mexico would seem a logical place for Amazon to expand. But duplicating the company's U.S.-style success could prove tougher."
walmart,2017-9,Online shopping comprises nearly 3 percent of all retail sales in Mexico compared with over 10 percent in the United States. Some Mexican shoppers are wary of online fraud and many do not have credit cards.
walmart,2017-9,Some analysts believe Amazon is willing to take the risk as it races to bulk up in foreign markets to compete with fast-moving global competitors such as China's Alibaba Group Holding Ltd .
walmart,2017-9,"""Amazon is not afraid to plow into a new market in a very big way, take a big hit, but say, 10 years down the line, this is going to be big and profitable,"" said Neil Saunders, managing director at the GlobalData Retail research firm."

He said the company's Mexican unit is aiming to expand its product offerings, offer faster deliveries and make the purchasing process as smooth and secure as possible to inspire consumer confidence."
walmart,2017-9,"Amazon's stock climbed more than 1 percent on Wednesday, reaching $994.10 a share by early afternoon."
walmart,2017-9,"Amazon currently operates two distribution centers in Mexico totaling more than 500,000 square feet (46,452 sq m), Gil said. Both are in Cuautitlan Izcalli in the state of Mexico, adjacent to the autonomous district of Mexico City, whose metro area is home to more than 20 million people."
walmart,2017-9,"The new warehouse will be constructed about 7 miles (11 km) from the existing facilities. All are located along the so-called ""NAFTA"" highway, an industrial belt that runs through Mexico's factory regions to the U.S. border."
walmart,2017-9,"The new facility is being built by U.S.-based industrial developer Prologis, which owns 45.9 percent of Fibra Prologis, a Mexico-based real estate investment trust that owns 34.2 million square feet (3.2 million sq m) of manufacturing and logistics space across Mexico. Fibra Prologis typically acquires properties from Prologis once they are completed. Prologis declined to comment on Amazon's tenancy, while Fibra Prologis declined interview requests."
walmart,2017-9,"At 1 million square feet, the new facility would be able to distribute bulky products such as furniture, as well as small items like books and microwaves, a set-up Amazon uses in other foreign countries, said Marc Wulfraat, president of the logistics consultancy firm MWPVL International."
walmart,2017-9,"The location could also serve as a distribution point for products going north to the United States, added Saunders from GlobalData."
walmart,2017-9,"""Amazon is very fluid with its logistics,"" he said. ""As long as that border is reasonably open, Amazon is very agnostic."""
walmart,2017-9,"Amazon's global operations stretch across 14 countries including Latin America's most populous nations, Brazil and Mexico. That footprint fueled $11.5 billion in net international sales in the second quarter, just over half the size of Amazon's North American sales."

walmart,2017-9,"Sept 13 (Reuters) - Target Corp said on Wednesday it would hire 100,000 workers for the holiday season, up 43 percent from last year, as the retailer pulls out all the stops to build on its recent uptick in sales."
walmart,2017-9,"The company's shares rose 3.4 percent as the move, coming off four years of flat seasonal hiring, cheered investors in a gloomy retail landscape where companies are shutting hundreds of stores and cutting jobs."
walmart,2017-9,"Target posted its first increase in comparable-store sales in five quarters last month, raising expectations that its turnaround plans were taking hold heading into the all-important holiday season."
walmart,2017-9,"""I think (Target) sees an opportunity to take market share in an environment where we have so many store closures in the specialty apparel and department store space,"" said Retail Metrics analyst Ken Perkins."
walmart,2017-9,Retailers including Sears Holdings Inc and Macy's Inc have announced plans to close hundreds of stores as they struggle with increasing competition from Amazon.com and fast-fashion retailers such as Forever 21.
walmart,2017-9,"Target's increased store staffing looks to be aimed at preventing loss of sales from customers walking out because of busy checkout lanes or lack of assistance while making purchases, Moody's analyst Charlie O'Shea said."
walmart,2017-9,"Moreover, Target last week lowered prices on thousands of items, a move that could bring in more traffic."
walmart,2017-9,"""I think they have the potential to have a (better) holiday season than any of their competitors,"" Perkins said."
walmart,2017-9,"Seasonal hiring plans give a glimpse into retailers' holiday sales expectations as the companies make nearly a third of their annual sales during the period, which starts a day after Thanksgiving and continues into early January."
walmart,2017-9,"With other major holiday season employers such as Amazon, Macy's and Kohl's Corp yet to announce hiring plans, analysts were divided on whether these companies would emulate Target's hiring spree."
walmart,2017-9,"""I would be stunned if we see other retailers increasing their seasonal hiring by 43 percent for the holiday season,"" Perkins said."
walmart,2017-9,"Wal-Mart has been spending more on paying higher wages and acquiring online retailers and so is unlikely to boost seasonal hiring to the same extent as Target, he said."
walmart,2017-9,Other major seasonal employers such as Macy's and Kohl's have focused on cutting costs.
walmart,2017-9,"Moody's O'Shea, however, said he expects retailers looking to cut costs to hire more temporary workers during the holiday season."
walmart,2017-9,"""There's a lot of flexibility in the workforce when you (hire temporary workers)... Hiring seasonal employees is a way to test what you really need."""
walmart,2017-9,"Retailers could also boost in-store staffing this year as they are now tasking workers with more activities such as manning shipping and pickup from stores, said Brendan Witcher, principal analyst at Forrester Research."
walmart,2017-9,"Target also said it would hire 4,500 people for the holiday season at its distribution and fulfillment centers, which supply products to its 1,816 stores and fulfill online orders. [nBw3GQvFTa]"

walmart,2017-9,"""There are still hundreds and thousands of companies that are sourcing from overseas that don't have the wherewithal or the resources or people or money to chase after these issues,"" Wulfraat said."
walmart,2017-9,"Textiles were North Korea's second-biggest export after coal and other minerals in 2016, totaling $752 million, according to data from the Korea Trade-Investment Promotion Agency. Nearly 80 percent went to China."
walmart,2017-9,"Enforcement of the textile ban along North Korea's 1,400-km (870-mile) border with China - where goods are sometimes smuggled across, often on boats at night - could be challenging, North Korea experts say."
walmart,2017-9,"""In the past, we have seen shows of quite convincing enforcement in the major centers, such as at Dandong,"" said Chris Green, a North Korea expert at Leiden University in the Netherlands, referring to the largest trading hub on the China-North Korea border.

walmart,2017-9,"""We're aware of the accusations and have clear guidelines and standards in place for our vendors and suppliers,"" said spokeswoman Jenna Rack. ""We don't source any products from North Korea or any apparel products from Dandong."""
walmart,2017-9,"North Korea does not release statistics on the number of people involved in the textiles industry, but experts estimate at least 100,000 people are employed at North Korean textiles factories, producing goods both for export and the domestic market."
walmart,2017-9,"Cheng Xiaohe, a North Korea specialist at Beijing's Renmin University, estimates the figure may be as high as 200,000 people."
walmart,2017-9,"Wages at textiles factories grew tenfold around 2010 when North Korea was experimenting with economic reforms, according to Green, so people suddenly went from earning 30 North Korean won to 300 won. ""They were suddenly getting a reasonable wage,"" said Green."
walmart,2017-9,"Supply chain consultant Tjia said North Korea textile workers will be hit by the trade ban. ""If the goal of the sanctions is to create difficulties for ordinary workers and their ability to make a livelihood, then a ban on textiles will work,"" he said."

walmart,2017-9,"Sept 8 (Reuters) - Target Corp said on Friday that it lowered prices on thousands of items, from cereal to baby formula, further hurting retail stocks already pressured by Kroger Co's disappointing quarterly results spurred by price cuts."
walmart,2017-9,"Target, which vowed earlier in the year to aggressively clamp down on prices to compete with rivals Wal-Mart Stores Inc and Amazon.com , said it had spent months reassessing the prices of everyday items such as milk, eggs, razors and bath tissue."
walmart,2017-9,"The retailer, which said it would continue to offer discounts on some products in addition to the price-cuts, added that it had also eliminated more than two-thirds of its price and offer call-outs."
walmart,2017-9,"The retailer's shares were down as much as 4.7 percent in midday trading on Friday, in-line with a slump among retail stocks after Kroger reported price cuts hurting its bottom line."
walmart,2017-9,"Target wants to make it easier for customers to spot lower prices by removing the guesswork that comes with temporary deals, Mark Tritton, Target's chief merchandising officer, said in a blog post."
walmart,2017-9,"A-Line Partners analyst Gabriella Santaniello said the move might initially cost Target in margins, but that lower prices and fewer temporary price cuts may also drive sales volumes that could eventually offset eroding margins."
walmart,2017-9,"""At the end of the day people just want everyday lower prices and that is what Target is aiming to do."""
walmart,2017-9,"When Target first announced in February that it would cut prices and miss full-year profit estimates, its shares plunged to a 2-1/2-year low. [nL3N1GD458]"
walmart,2017-9,"Like Target, Kroger, the biggest U.S. supermarket company, has slashed prices on staples such as milk and eggs to fend off competition from Wal-Mart, discounters Lidl and Aldi, and the newly merged Amazon and Whole Foods Market. [nL4N1LP40W]"
walmart,2017-9,"Amazon.com's $13.7 billion purchase of Whole Foods has the grocery industry on edge, worried that the online retail giant could upend the fresh food business in the way it did with books and electronics."
walmart,2017-9,Amazon last month lowered prices on some Whole Foods groceries including avocados and beef.
walmart,2017-9,"""I don't think this came out of nowhere. (Target) were clearly picking up on the signals and the consumer's response to Amazon and it is clear to me Amazon encroaching on their space,"" A-Line Partners analyst Gabriella Santaniello said."
walmart,2017-9,"Shares in Amazon were down 0.7 percent, while Wal-Mart was down about 2 percent and Kroger's stock tumbled nearly 10 percent, hitting a 3-1/2 year low."

walmart,2017-9,"CHICAGO, Sept 6 (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc has begun its holiday layaway program as it hopes to cash-in early on demand for gifts like toys, which saw slower sales growth industry-wide last December and has struggled to pick up so far this year."
walmart,2017-9,"The world's largest retailer started the layaway program on Sept. 1, a day before it did last year where customers can pay as little as $10 to hold items worth a minimum of $50."
walmart,2017-9,"Layaway programs, which have made a comeback since the 2008 financial crisis as customers avoided using credit cards to make purchases, allow shoppers to put aside holiday merchandise like electronics and toys and make payments in installments until the full price has been paid."
walmart,2017-9,"Sales are also off to a slower start in 2017, the NPD group said in a note in July."
walmart,2017-9,"Toy sales have been under pressure as they compete with videogames and YouTube videos. Toymakers like Lego A/S and Mattel Inc , who are seeing sales decline, have been attempting to modernize toys for the digital age."
walmart,2017-9,"For the holiday season, Wal-Mart said it will have 300 toys exclusively available at its stores and on its website from 400 toys last year. It includes Frozen Sleigh and Monster Jam Grave Digger along with collectible items like Fingerlings, L.O.L. Surprise Fizz Factory and littleBits Star Wars Droid Inventor Kit, Kehoe said."
