General Electric,2017-2,{{20170301T064620.182+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-Harry Potter conjures Japanese growth for Comcast(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.)
General Electric,2017-2,"HONG KONG, March 1 (Reuters Breakingviews) - With Harry Potter's help, Comcast can conjure up growth in sleepy Japan. The biggest U.S. cable operator is paying 255 billion yen ($2.3 billion) to buy out Goldman Sachs and other partners in Universal Studios Japan. The Osaka theme park's success, thanks partly to the boy wizard, highlights a part of the economy where domestic consumption growth is no illusion."
General Electric,2017-2,"USJ was briefly listed, but faltered during the financial crisis. It was taken private in a 2009 management buyout backed by Goldman, private equity firm MBK, and Owl Creek, a hedge fund. That gave USJ an enterprise value of just $1.4 billion."
General Electric,2017-2,"Growth at USJ has raced ahead since, in a manner more befitting the Hogwarts Express than the wider Japanese economy. In dollar terms, sales have roughly doubled since 2008-2009. Visitor numbers are up more than 70 percent - and about nine-tenths of those visitors are Japanese. The latest deal values USJ at $7.5 billion including debt."
General Electric,2017-2,"Such growth bucks the stereotype of penny-pinching local consumers. Despite Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's efforts to rejuvenate the economy, household consumption fell 1.5 percent in real terms last year, excluding spending on houses, cars, and cash gifts."
General Electric,2017-2,"The new deal consummates a process initiated in late 2015, when Comcast bought 51 percent of USJ for $1.5 billion. That multi-year approach to acquisitions is unusual but will be familiar to Comcast investors, since the company used a similar two-stage deal to buy NBCUniversal from General Electric ."
General Electric,2017-2,- Comcast NBCUniversal said on Feb. 28 it would buy the 49 percent of Universal Studios Japan that it does not already own for 255 billion yen ($2.3 billion). The Osaka theme park includes a Harry Potter area and rides based on Spiderman and Jurassic Park.
General Electric,2017-2,"- The biggest U.S. cable operator said the deal valued USJ at 840 billion yen including debt. The sellers include Goldman Sachs, former USJ Chief Executive Glenn Gumpel, Asian private equity firm MBK Partners, and U.S. hedge fund Owl Creek Asset Management."
General Electric,2017-2,- Comcast agreed to buy 51 percent of USJ in September 2015 for $1.5 billion. This earlier deal gave USJ an enterprise value of 750 billion yen.
General Electric,2017-2,"- USJ reported sales of 68.5 billion yen in the year ended March 31, 2009, which was then equivalent to about $694 million. For the year ended Dec. 31, 2016, Comcast reported $1.4 billion of consolidated revenue from USJ."

General Electric,2017-2,"PARIS, Feb 23 (Reuters) - French waste and water treatment group Suez Environnement is considering making a bid for General Electric's industrial water treatment business, a Suez spokeswoman said on Thursday, confirming media reports."
General Electric,2017-2,"French newspaper Le Figaro said on Wednesday that Suez was among a handful of other companies, mostly private equity firms which were left in the running after a second round of bidding for GE Water & Process Technologies."
General Electric,2017-2,"GE Water earns $250-$300 million a year before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization."
General Electric,2017-2,"""GE Water is indeed a business that we are looking at because its activities are in line with our strategy of boosting our industrial market,"" the spokeswoman said."
General Electric,2017-2,GE put the unit on the block when it announced it was merging its power business with oil services group Baker Hughes on Oct. 31.
General Electric,2017-2,"BFM Business reported that Suez was set to make a firm offer for GE Water in the coming days and that GE would chose a buyer mid-March, with the price of the unit estimated at somewhere betweed 2 and 3 billion euros ($2-3 billion)."
General Electric,2017-2,BFM said that Suez's cheif executive Jean-Louis Chaussade had the unanimous support of his board for the acquisition and was considering financing it with a mix of debt and new capital.
General Electric,2017-2,Bigger French rival Veolia's chief executive Antoine Frerot said on Thursday he had also looked at buying the GE Water business but decided not to make a bid.
General Electric,2017-2,Veolia and Suez are both looking to expand in the industrial market as their traditional European municipal water markets are stagnating. ($1 = 0.9484 euros)
General Electric,2017-2,"{{20170223T102416.233+0000}}UPDATE 2-Veolia warns on profits, shares slide 7 pct* Lowers profit outlook"
General Electric,2017-2,"PARIS, Feb 23 (Reuters) - Veolia on Thursday warned it would take a year longer than expected to achieve its core earnings target, sending shares in the French water and waste firm 7 percent lower."
General Electric,2017-2,CEO Antoine Frerot said challenges this year would include low inflation in Europe capping water tariff increases and the threat of municipal customers returning to public water services or considering doing so.
General Electric,2017-2,"The city of Vilnius, Lithuania is set to end its contract with Veolia this year, while Sheffield in Britain is also considering taking back public control, he said."
General Electric,2017-2,"A bigger threat could be the loss of the contract with the Ile de France region around Paris, under which Veolia provides water for about 4.5 million people in some 150 municipalities. It will be up for renegotiation in four years."
General Electric,2017-2,"Paris itself has ended its outsourcing contracts with Veolia and Suez and in 2010 started running its own water service, setting an example for other places to either make water management public again or put pressure on their suppliers."
General Electric,2017-2,"Veolia lowered its outlook for earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) to a range of 3.3 billion to 3.5 billion euros ($3.69 billion) in 2019."
General Electric,2017-2,It had earlier forecast hitting 3.5 billion euros in EBITDA by 2018.
General Electric,2017-2,"For 2016, it reported EBITDA up 2 percent to 3.06 billion euros on revenue down 2.3 percent to 24.39 billion euros."
General Electric,2017-2,"""Cost cuts were the main driver of the earnings improvement and compensate the headwinds linked to the lack of inflation and the tensions on our tariffs in certain markets,"" Chief Financial Officer Philippe Capron told analysts."
General Electric,2017-2,Veolia said it would raise cost cuts to bring the 2016-18 total to 800 million euros from 600 million.
General Electric,2017-2,It proposed lifting its dividend to 80 cents per share from 73 cents but did not repeat its forecast for 10 percent dividend growth in 2016-18.
General Electric,2017-2,Frerot said dividend in coming years would move in line with core earnings.
General Electric,2017-2,"He said 2017 earnings growth would be driven mainly by Asia, North and South America, while in Europe growth would be moderate and in France it would be flat to slightly lower."
General Electric,2017-2,"Asked about a possible merger with its main competitor Suez, Frerot said there were no plans for an alliance."
General Electric,2017-2,"Frerot told analysts that he had looked at assets put up for sale by U.S. industrial conglomerate General Electric , but had decided not to make an offer."
General Electric,2017-2,"French daily Le Figaro reported on Wednesday that Suez is in the running to buy the water business GE has put up for sale and that the firm is among a handful of other companies, mostly private equity firms, left in the running after a second round of bidding for GE Water & Process Technologies."
General Electric,2017-2,Frerot also said an audit into conflicts of interest at its French water unit had been completed and would be made public in coming weeks. [nL8N1DU2IC]

General Electric,2017-2,"WASHINGTON, Feb 22 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump, who has vowed to stop U.S. manufacturing from disappearing overseas, will seek job-creation advice on Thursday from at least five companies that are laying off thousands of workers as they shift production abroad."
General Electric,2017-2,"Caterpillar Inc , United Technologies Corp , Dana Inc , 3M Co and General Electric Co , are offshoring work to Mexico, China, India and other countries, according to a Reuters review of U.S. Labor Department records."
General Electric,2017-2,"Executives from the five companies are among a group of business leaders due to meet with Trump on Thursday to discuss how to help the president deliver on his promise to increase factory employment, according to the White House."
General Electric,2017-2,"About 2,300 U.S. workers at these five companies stand to lose their jobs within the next two years as a result of offshoring, according to the Labor Department's Trade Adjustment Assistance Program, which provides retraining benefits to workers displaced by global trade. Reuters obtained the information through a Freedom of Information Act request."
General Electric,2017-2,"The companies confirmed the planned job cuts to Reuters. It is not clear whether the other 19 executives due to meet with Trump on Thursday are currently offshoring work, as the TAA program does not cover all workers who lose their jobs due to global trade."
General Electric,2017-2,"The lost jobs amount to a small fraction of the hundreds of thousands of U.S. workers employed by those involved in the meeting. General Electric, for example, employs 125,000 U.S. workers, financial filings show."
General Electric,2017-2,"On the campaign trail and in the White House, Trump has painted globalization as a zero-sum game that has enriched low-wage countries while leaving the United States littered with abandoned factories and underemployed workers, and he has threatened to tax companies that offshore U.S. jobs."
General Electric,2017-2,"The experience of companies on Trump's task force, however, shows the reality is more complex in a world where they are serving customers across the globe. Several said they were creating many new U.S. factory jobs even as they move work to other countries."
General Electric,2017-2,It's not clear whether Trump will opt for the carrot or the stick.
General Electric,2017-2,"Trump plans to meet business leaders to hear their reasons for ""why they're going offshore,"" said a White House aide who spoke on condition of anonymity."
General Electric,2017-2,Blue-collar workers who share Trump's skepticism of global trade say they will be watching closely to see if he will try to save their jobs.
General Electric,2017-2,"""I don't think he's a typical politician, so there is hope alive for middle-class families that he will do something,"" said Scott Schmidt, one of 222 workers at a GE engine plant in Waukesha, Wisconsin who are due to lose their jobs later this year when the company shifts production to Canada."
General Electric,2017-2,General Electric CEO Jeffrey Immelt is among those due to meet with Trump on Thursday.
General Electric,2017-2,"GE says it is closing its Waukesha plant because Congress has hobbled the U.S. Export-Import Bank's ability to finance large export orders while most other industrialized nations still offer such financial support. The company says it laid off 225 workers last year at a Houston factory for the same reason, shifting production to France, the United Kingdom and Hungary."
General Electric,2017-2,GE says it is also closing an Ohio factory and laying off 180 workers because consumers are buying fewer of the florescent and incandescent light bulbs they make there. What production remains will be handled by a factory in Hungary.
General Electric,2017-2,"The U.S. economy lost 6 million manufacturing jobs from 2000 to 2010, roughly one-third of its total, in part due to offshoring, but the sector has added 900,000 jobs since then, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics."
General Electric,2017-2,"Multinational companies say labor costs now are only one factor they consider when deciding where to manufacture. An auto maker, for example, may decide to build a particular model in the country where sales are strongest, prompting parts suppliers to set up there as well so they can turn around orders quickly."
General Electric,2017-2,The offshoring picture is also more complex than official statistics indicate as a shuttered factory in the United States does not always mean a new factory abroad.
General Electric,2017-2,"When auto-parts maker Dana Corp closes a factory later this year in Glasgow, Kentucky that is operating at 20 percent of capacity, one of its plants in Ohio will pick up the work, along with other factories in Mexico, India and China. Dana CEO James Kamsickas is among those scheduled to meet with Trump on Thursday."
General Electric,2017-2,"The company plans to hire nearly 700 U.S. workers over the next three years as it expands factories in four U.S. states, spokesman Jeff Cole said."
General Electric,2017-2,That is little comfort to the 223 people in Kentucky who will lose their jobs.
General Electric,2017-2,"""It seems like all these CEOs and companies have turned their backs on the American worker,"" said Dana employee Tim Wells, one of those who will be laid off."
General Electric,2017-2,"The group also includes United Technologies CEO Gregory Hayes, who took heat from Trump last year for planning to move jobs from Indianapolis to Mexico. The company struck a deal with the incoming president in November to preserve roughly 700 jobs in exchange for $7 million in tax breaks."
General Electric,2017-2,"United Technologies says it still plans to lay off 786 workers at a separate Indiana plant and move production to Mexico this year. The company is also moving work from a facility in Arden Hills, Minnesota, resulting in a loss of 72 jobs. Most of that work is staying in the United States but some is moving to Poland, spokeswoman Bethany Sherman said, and some of the affected workers will be offered positions elsewhere."
General Electric,2017-2,"The company is adding more than 1,000 new jobs in the United States, Sherman said."
General Electric,2017-2,"Other participants include Caterpillar Chairman Doug Oberhelman, who oversees a company that is laying off 712 workers in the American South and Midwest and moving the work to China, Mexico, Italy, France and Germany as it weathers the largest sales slump in its history. A Caterpillar spokesman said it is simultaneously creating 1,300 new manufacturing jobs elsewhere in the United States."
General Electric,2017-2,"Also due to participate is Inge Thulin, CEO of 3M, which is eliminating 130 jobs in suburban Cincinnati and moving production to Mexico. The company says it has added more than 2,000 U.S. manufacturing jobs over the last five years."

General Electric,2017-2,"Companies expect a growing market for such systems as cities seek better data to plan and run their operations. San Diego is a test of ""internet of things"" technology that GE Current provides for commercial buildings and industrial sites."
General Electric,2017-2,"""This is a brand new market,"" Maryrose Sylvester, chief executive officer of GE Current, said in an interview. A 2014 estimate by Frost & Sullivan predicted the market for cities could be valued at $1.5 trillion by 2020, she said."
General Electric,2017-2,"""San Diego is a very early adopter. While it's a smallish deal in dollars it's the biggest deal of this kind yet."""
General Electric,2017-2,"GE's CityIQ nodes will be rolled out starting in July and data will be available in the fall, Jen Lebron, spokeswoman for San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer, said. The system is included in a $30 million GE LED lighting upgrade to 14,000 of San Diego's 60,100 street lights, which is expected to save the city $2.4 million a year."
General Electric,2017-2,"San Diego's city council approved the lighting in December, without discussion of potential privacy issues raised by the surveillance system, and no objections arose during a pilot that began in 2014 in downtown San Diego, Lebron said."
General Electric,2017-2,"""It's anonymous data with no personal identifiers,"" she said. Video is not as detailed as security camera footage."
General Electric,2017-2,"The San Diego Police Department already uses ShotSpotter, a gunfire detection system, to help solve crimes, Lebron said. San Francisco, Chicago and more than 40 other cities use ShotSpotter, according to the company's website."
General Electric,2017-2,"GE hopes cities will make the data available to businesses. Current's data and open software platform should allow programmers to develop applications, said John Gordon, chief digital officer at GE Current: ""Everything from traffic and parking problems to finding the quietest way to walk home and have a cell phone conversation."""

General Electric,2017-2,"NOGALES, Arizona, Feb 16 (Reuters) - For up to 16 hours a day, tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers and mangoes grown in Mexico flow north through a border checkpoint into Nogales, Arizona, helping to ensure a year-round supply of fresh produce across the United States."
General Electric,2017-2,"Each year, some 330,000 trucks and 75,000 train cars carrying $17 billion worth of goods move through Nogales, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Economists estimate trade supports nearly one in three jobs here, ranging from workers who inspect the goods to forklift operators who unload them in distribution centers."
General Electric,2017-2,"In many ways, Nogales represents the flip side of free trade deals that have battered industrial cities in the Midwest, where jobs have been outsourced and manufacturing plants shut down. The cities where Donald Trump's promise to throttle what he calls unfair competition resonated most profoundly during the presidential campaign."
General Electric,2017-2,"It also represents potential risks that new trade barriers could pose for businesses and residents along the border.

General Electric,2017-2,"Now in office, Trump is considering a 20 percent tax on imports from Mexico, one of several ideas under review in Washington, and is promising to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement."
General Electric,2017-2,"More than a dozen city officials, employers and workers interviewed here said a border tax, if enacted, could choke the flow of imports from Mexico.

General Electric,2017-2,"Food, autos and electronics go both ways across the border checkpoint, sometimes more than once. Mexican mangoes and melons come north while California almonds and apples from Washington state go south. U.S. car parts sent to Mexican factories are imported back as finished vehicles."
General Electric,2017-2,"""There are hundreds of products that come back and forth through the port of entry in Nogales,"" Doyle said."

General Electric,2017-2,"{{20170210T120825.094+0000}}UPDATE 1-Vestas leaps to top spot in U.S. wind market(Adds comments, detail)"
General Electric,2017-2,"COPENHAGEN, Feb 10 (Reuters) - Danish wind turbine maker Vestas Wind Systems has leapt to the top of the U.S. wind market, overtaking General Electric in new capacity installed last year, although slower demand growth and doubts over political support could threaten its position."
General Electric,2017-2,"Vestas came back from the brink of bankruptcy just four years ago. Now the wind industry is entering a new phase with slower growth and more steady demand for turbines, prompting producers to turn to servicing and replacement of older turbines to grow revenue."
General Electric,2017-2,"Vestas, the world's biggest wind turbine maker, supplied 43 percent of the 8.2 GW of wind power capacity connected to the U.S. power grid last year, the American Wind Energy Association said in a quarterly report. That was up from 33 percent in 2015 and just 12 percent in 2014."
General Electric,2017-2,"By contrast, General Electric's market share stood at 42 percent in 2016, down from well over half in 2014, the association said, although GE remains the market leader in terms of overall installed capacity in the United States."
General Electric,2017-2,"""It is definitely our ambition to at least keep our market share,"" Vestas Chief Executive Anders Runevad said in an interview."
General Electric,2017-2,"Wind energy has surpassed hydropower as the biggest source of renewable electricity in the United States, according to the association, helped by tax credits under Barack Obama's administration. [nL1N1FU118]"
General Electric,2017-2,"Vestas reported record global revenues for 2016 on Wednesday but warned of lower orders in the United States this year, saying rapid growth in demand in the industry generally could be coming to an end as the wind market matures. [nL5N1FT24W]"
General Electric,2017-2,The Danish company is set to lose its status as the world's top wind turbine maker after Germany's Siemens and Spain's Gamesa agreed to combine their assets in the sector.
General Electric,2017-2,"Both GE and Siemens depend on orders from a few large customers such as NextEra Energy , while Vestas supplies a broader range."
General Electric,2017-2,"""They've been very aggressive and maintained a diverse order book,"" said Luke Lewandowski, research manager at MAKE, a consultancy."
General Electric,2017-2,"Numbers from MAKE, which include grid-connected turbines from wind farm projects that are not yet fully completed, show that GE held 42 percent of the market last year with Vestas second at 41 percent."
General Electric,2017-2,"In June, Vestas secured a significant order for 1,000 wind turbines from MidAmerican Energy, a Berkshire Hathaway subsidiary which had until then been a Siemens client. [nFWN19903Y]"
General Electric,2017-2,"""Vestas has been really flexible in thinking and adapting themselves to the wishes of the clients in terms of location, type of turbines and the services around it,"" said Danny van Doesburg, senior portfolio manager at APG Asset Management, the seventh biggest shareholder in Vestas."
General Electric,2017-2,"""We have widened the customer base quite substantially in the United States,"" Runevad said. ""We have managed to penetrate further into the big U.S.-based utilities."""
General Electric,2017-2,"Still, risks remain for the the world's biggest wind turbine maker, which supplies the U.S. market from four factories in Colorado."
General Electric,2017-2,"Vestas was one of the hardest hit European stocks, plunging as much as 10 percent, after Trump's election pointed to an uncertain future for the U.S. wind market, the company's largest. [nL8N1DA2S8]"
General Electric,2017-2,"After a record year in 2016, Vestas warned on Wednesday of lower order intake in the United States this year and said rapid growth in demand could be coming to an end, noting ""signs of increased maturity of the wind market."" [nL5N1FT24W]"
General Electric,2017-2,"Vestas said that the Production Tax Credit (PTC), which was extended for five years in December 2015, could hit its U.S. business in the near term as it gives investors more time to build their wind farm projects, reducing pressure to get projects built next year."
General Electric,2017-2,"Tax credits that are already awarded seem safe, but there is now more uncertainty about future government support."
General Electric,2017-2,"""How (the U.S. market) will pan out over the years is still very hard to predict,"" Runevad said. He seeks to position Vestas for high growth in the service segment, which grew by 15 percent last year, helped by the acquisition of two service providers."
General Electric,2017-2,"As the industry matures, more turbines need servicing, upgrading and eventually replacement. MAKE forecasts the global service segment to grow by 9 to 10 percent per year on average over the next ten years."
General Electric,2017-2,"""The whole service element of the wind industry can be a potential trigger for the investment case,"" said APG's van Doesburg."

General Electric,2017-2,"FRANKFURT, Feb 10 (Reuters) - Europe's top utilities are planning to invest tens of billions of euros over the next three years to catch up with the green energy revolution, driving a flurry of takeovers by tech and engineering firms of niche, smart-energy innovators."
General Electric,2017-2,"Upgrading power and gas networks used to be a hardware-based affair as long as steady baseload energy sources, such as coal and gas, accounted for most power generation."
General Electric,2017-2,But the rise of solar and wind power increased the need for intelligent IT systems that can balance out demand and supply swings while meeting energy and carbon emissions targets.
General Electric,2017-2,This has led industrial conglomerates and technology companies to seek out small targets to complement their offering to utility clients in the wake of Google's landmark purchase of smart thermostat maker Nest Labs in 2014.

General Electric,2017-2,Airlines typically get discounts on jet orders and Rubel estimated the deal's net value closer to $6.5 billion or about a tenth of the U.S. planemaker's annual volume.
General Electric,2017-2,"""While the deal may have been highly competitive, it is business in part of the market that strengthens Boeing's positioning,"" he said."
General Electric,2017-2,"The agreement, however, leaves a question mark over Airbus proposals to develop a larger 400-seat version of its A350 passenger jet to compete with the 406-seat Boeing 777-9."
General Electric,2017-2,"Singapore's flagship carrier had been seen as a key potential launch customer for the proposed jet, but the European planemaker last year postponed a decision on whether to launch the new project amid pressure on demand for wide-body jets."
General Electric,2017-2,"The fact Airbus was not yet ready to make a definitive offer to supply the new plane, relying instead on the 366-seat A350-1000, may have been a handicap in the contest for Singapore's business, an industry source said."
General Electric,2017-2,"""Our priority is to certify and assure entry to service of the A350-1000,"" an Airbus spokesman said, adding the two main existing models represented a ""good platform"" for airline needs."
General Electric,2017-2,"SIA's significant orders and recent moves to extend some of its fuel-hedging contracts to as long as five years show it is positioning itself for the next phase of growth, said Shukor Yusof, analyst at Malaysian aviation consultancy Endau Analytics."
General Electric,2017-2,"""What's working for them is that they have very deep pockets and they are putting some of that money to replace fleet and also looking at new destinations,"" Yusof said."
General Electric,2017-2,SIA has been under pressure as demand weakens for long-haul travel amid tough competition from Middle East network carriers.
General Electric,2017-2,"SIA said this would be the airline's first order for the newest 777 variant that is currently under development. SIA is already the launch customer for the 787-10, which is also currently in development, having placed an initial order in 2013 for 30 aircraft for delivery from the 2018/19 financial year."
General Electric,2017-2,"The airline operates a varied fleet with more than 50 current-generation 777s in service, while subsidiaries SilkAir, Scoot and SIA Cargo also operate other Boeing planes. Thursday's preliminary order was SIA's biggest Boeing deal by value."
General Electric,2017-2,"It also operates other Airbus aircraft including the smaller A350-900 model and the four-engined A380, the world's largest airliner, some of which could be replaced by 777-9s."
General Electric,2017-2,"The growth of the big twinjet is driven by advances in the largest engines, sparking a parallel battle between Boeing ally General Electric and Airbus supplier Rolls-Royce ."
General Electric,2017-2,GE is the sole supplier of engines on the 777 and Rolls-Royce won the $1.7 billion order from SIA to power the 19 Boeing Dreamliner aircraft.

General Electric,2017-2,"FRANKFURT, Feb 10 (Reuters) - Europe's top utilities are planning to invest tens of billions of euros over the next three years to catch up with the green energy revolution, driving a flurry of takeovers by tech and engineering firms of niche, smart-energy innovators."
General Electric,2017-2,"Upgrading power and gas networks used to be a hardware-based affair as long as steady baseload energy sources, such as coal and gas, accounted for most power generation."
General Electric,2017-2,But the rise of solar and wind power increased the need for intelligent IT systems that can balance out demand and supply swings while meeting energy and carbon emissions targets.
General Electric,2017-2,This has led industrial conglomerates and technology companies to seek out small targets to complement their offering to utility clients in the wake of Google's landmark purchase of smart thermostat maker Nest Labs in 2014.
General Electric,2017-2,"""Everywhere in the supply chain of power there is disruption going on,"" said Bruce Jenkyn-Jones, co-head of listed equities at Impax Asset Management , which focuses on investments in environmental markets and resource efficiency."
General Electric,2017-2,"M&A activity is well under way in storage and smart meters, which are key in securing access to customers and, more importantly, their data, to help the utilities tailor their power purchases and save costs."

General Electric,2017-2,"Together, major European utilities will spend at least 40 billion euros by 2020 to upgrade their networks, according to ongoing investment plans, including replacing old cables, buying new smart meters and putting new IT in place."
General Electric,2017-2,"The spending spree follows a decade of crisis, during which rival renewable capacity pushed many of their coal- and gas-fired power plants out of the market."

General Electric,2017-2,{{20170201T112742.048+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-Siemens beats activist investors at their own game(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.)
General Electric,2017-2,"LONDON, Feb 1 (Reuters Breakingviews) - If you can't beat them, join them. This is in a nutshell how Siemens boss Joe Kaeser has avoided coming into the crosshairs of militant shareholders, unlike peers GE and ABB . Since ousting his hapless predecessor Peter Loescher in a 2013 boardroom battle, Kaeser has taken his cues from the textbooks of investor activism by carving out businesses, cutting red tape and lifting payouts to investors."
General Electric,2017-2,"The Munich-based group's impressive performance in the quarter to December vindicates the approach. The industrial businesses' profit margin rose by a quarter to 13 percent. For the full year, profitability may rise close to levels that Loescher promised but never achieved. Nor is this at the expense of growth. Analysts expect revenue to increase 5.5 percent this year - the biggest rise in five years."
General Electric,2017-2,"Granted, Kaeser hasn't got everything right. His biggest blunder was the acquisition of U.S. oil kit maker Dresser-Rand for $7.8 billion in 2014, just before oil prices collapsed. But overall, his home-made version of activism has paid off nicely for shareholders. Since August 2013, Siemens has generated an average total shareholder return of 14.9 percent per year, compared with 7.3 percent at Swiss rival ABB and 9.3 percent at GE, which have both faced activist investor pressure."
General Electric,2017-2,"Even after presiding over a 48 percent rise in Siemens' share price, Kaeser's success has yet to be fully reflected in the group's valuation. The stock is trading at around 15 times the next 12 months earnings, Thomson Reuters data show. That's a discount of a fifth to ABB and 15 percent below GE. If Kaeser keeps up his DIY brand of activism, this gap will close."
General Electric,2017-2,"- German engineering group Siemens on Jan. 31 raised its earnings forecasts for the current fiscal year ending in September. The trains-to-turbines company is now expecting a profit margin of 11 to 12 percent for its industrial business, compared with a previous guidance of 10.5 to 11.5 percent. It also increased its earnings-per-share forecast to between 7.2 and 7.7 euros from 6.8 to 7.2 euros, after net profit jumped 25 percent to 1.9 billion euros in the quarter up to December 2016."
General Electric,2017-2,"- At 2.5 billion euros, industrial profit was 26 percent higher than a year earlier and well above the average estimate of 2.2 billion euros in a Reuters poll."

General Electric,2017-2,{{20170131T214754.028+0000}}UPDATE 2-Siemens raises outlook after Q1 profit beats forecasts * Now expects FY industrial margin of 11-12 pct vs 10.5-11.5 pct
General Electric,2017-2,"MUNICH, Germany, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Top European engineering group Siemens raised its earnings forecasts on Tuesday after its industrial business profit jumped in the fiscal first quarter, lifted by its factory automation unit."
General Electric,2017-2,"The German trains-to-turbines company said it now expected an industrial profit margin of 11-12 percent for the year to end-September, versus its previous forecast for 10.5-11.5 percent. It made 13 percent in the first quarter."
General Electric,2017-2,"Siemens' core industrial software division, Digital Factory, reported a 60 percent profit jump in profit and a margin of 26.1 percent, boosted by a one-off portfolio gain but also a 4 percent rise in sales driven by China."
General Electric,2017-2,"That lifted group industrial profit 26 percent to 2.51 billion euros, well above the average estimate of 2.14 billion euros in a Reuters poll, even excluding the 172 million-euro gain. [nL5N1FG6OW]"
General Electric,2017-2,"Siemens did not say in its statement whether sales had also risen in the United States, as they did in the quarter for U.S. rival Rockwell Automation , whose stock has risen about 19 percent since Donald Trump was elected president on Nov. 8."
General Electric,2017-2,"""We will continue to rigorously execute our strategy programme,"" said Chief Executive and former finance chief Joe Kaeser, under whose stewardship Siemens' past execution blunders and related large one-off charges have largely disappeared."
General Electric,2017-2,"Siemens said it was ahead of schedule with an 8 billion-euro ($8.6 billion) electricity contract in Egypt, its largest single order to date, which is designed to boost the north African nation's power-generation capacity by 45 percent. [nFWN1FL0V1]"
General Electric,2017-2,"But first-quarter orders fell by a greater-than-expected 14 percent, partly reflecting the lack of a similar large contract this year but also a sharp drop in power and gas orders from Europe and the Middle East and a big decline in the Americas."
General Electric,2017-2,"U.S. rival General Electric's orders in power-related equipment including gas turbines, where it competes with Siemens, fell 28 percent in the quarter, compared with a 40 percent drop for Siemens."
General Electric,2017-2,"Siemens' first-quarter sales rose by a weaker-than-expected 3 percent on a comparable basis to 19.1 billion euros ($20.6 billion). The company stuck to its forecasts for ""moderate"" full-year sales growth and orders higher than sales."
General Electric,2017-2,"It raised its earnings-per-share forecast to 7.20 to 7.70 euros from a previous 6.80 to 7.20 euros, after net profit jumped 25 percent to 1.94 billion euros."
General Electric,2017-2,"Siemens gave no further details on plans for its healthcare division Healthineers, which it plans to list while keeping a majority stake, ahead of a press conference and annual shareholder meeting on Wednesday. ($1 = 0.9265 euros)"
