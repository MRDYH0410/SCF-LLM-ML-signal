General Electric,2017-4,"FRANKFURT, May 2 (Reuters) - Grid operator Tennet and solar battery maker Sonnen GmbH have launched a pilot project that will tap home photovoltaic (PV) systems to help iron out imbalances on Germany's power network."
General Electric,2017-4,"TenneT and Sonnen's e-Services subsidiary aim to sign up 6,000 household PV producers equipped with storage batteries by the end of May."
General Electric,2017-4,"The project will be supported by blockchain technology from IBM , which works as an inexpensive transaction-processing system for tracking and recording encrypted information. [nL5N1GG2JT]"
General Electric,2017-4,"It holds potential to link up small energy ""prosumers"" and make them independent of centralised power providers."
General Electric,2017-4,"""A home storage unit for solar power on its own is less valuable than one that can be used collectively,"" said Philipp Schroeder, director of sales and marketing at Bavaria-based Sonnen. [nL5N1FF2U9]"
General Electric,2017-4,"""We will be able to create a big virtual power line. That is revolutionary."""
General Electric,2017-4,The two partners aim to initially pool 24 megawatts (MW) of power capacity for TenneT to use as a buffer for variable wind power.
General Electric,2017-4,"""Balancing"" power is so far handled mainly by traditional power plants while surplus wind power is often dealt with by curbing turbine output or throwing output away."
General Electric,2017-4,"""We want to find out how we can reduce the waste of wind power by storing it in Sonnen batteries that we can access in the North while releasing power from solar energy stored at Sonnen batteries in southern Germany,"" said Urban Keussen, board chairman of the board at TenneT's German unit."
General Electric,2017-4,"Germany currently subsidises renewable power producers with billions of euros a year, regardless of demand."
General Electric,2017-4,"Because network development lags far behind, a lot of power is wasted because the north houses most of Germany's wind turbines whose output cannot reach industrial users in the south."
General Electric,2017-4,"New transport lines, funded via grid fees charged to consumers, will take years to build. [nL8N18Z1SF]"
General Electric,2017-4,"Schroeder said he saw big potential for solar pv ""communities"" filling gaps in the meantime."
General Electric,2017-4,"Germany has 15 million detached houses and 1.7 million photovoltaic units, but only 50,000 home storage units."
General Electric,2017-4,"Should 10 percent of all households use solar plus storage in 10 years, that would create capacity of some 6 gigawatts of power, he said, equivalent to six nuclear plants."

General Electric,2017-4,"SAN FRANCISCO, April 28 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc's ventures far beyond online retail, from cloud computing to movie making, are raising questions among corporate strategy experts about its focus."
General Electric,2017-4,"The Seattle-based company wowed Wall Street again this week with a 23 percent jump in sales, pushing its shares to an all-time high. But there are concerns that if blockbuster growth stops, investors may come to regard the company more like a conglomerate stock - worth less than the sum of its pieces."
General Electric,2017-4,"""High growth covers a lot of sins,"" said Harry Kraemer, a partner at private equity firm Madison Dearborn Partners and a professor at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management."
General Electric,2017-4,"""Picture yourself running the company where one minute we're talking about how we're going to operate air cargo, and the next minute we're going to talk about artificial intelligence,"" he said. ""I don't think it's sustainable."""
General Electric,2017-4,"So far, analysts have balked at the idea of calling Amazon a conglomerate because its businesses, although varied, all relate in some way to retail. Warehouses, trucks and planes bring packages to shoppers' doorsteps. Amazon Web Services sells the very cloud-computing services to enterprises that were built to meet the technology needs of Amazon.com."
General Electric,2017-4,"""It's not like General Electric Co having financial services and making aircraft engines,"" Baird Equity Research analyst Colin Sebastian said."
General Electric,2017-4,"Some initiatives, though, such as a television studio in Hollywood, seem further afield. Amazon says the video foray has allowed it to stream unique programming to members of its Prime shopping club, thereby increasing sign-ups for a program that encourages people to buy more goods, more often."
General Electric,2017-4,"The financial success of the investment is difficult to assess. Revenue from Prime membership fees and other media subscriptions rose 49 percent in the first quarter to $1.9 billion, the company reported on Thursday. It does not disclose the costs of content for its Prime Video service, but they were estimated by an analyst to be more than $3 billion in 2016."
General Electric,2017-4,"These days, conglomerates like GE are out of fashion in the corporate world. By a standard method of valuation - comparing a company's share price to its earnings per share - Amazon is worth about 10 times more than storied conglomerates Berkshire Hathaway Inc and United Technologies Corp ."
General Electric,2017-4,"Investors discount conglomerate stocks partly because diverse businesses are tough to manage, and partly because they believe the market allots money across industries better than a company can."
General Electric,2017-4,"Indeed, a 2012 report by McKinsey & Co consultants found that conglomerates' revenue on average grew by 6.3 percent per year from 2002 to 2010, while ""focused"" companies grew by 9.2 percent."
General Electric,2017-4,"Amazon has acknowledged its pursuits point in many directions, but stresses they are for the long-term, not for quick gains."
General Electric,2017-4,"Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky rattled off a lengthy list of investments from retail in India to drones and artificial intelligence on the company's earnings conference call on Thursday, in an attempt to explain why its operating profit margin had thinned in North America."
General Electric,2017-4,"""I know I'm drifting a bit from North America, but it's all part of the same theme,"" he told analysts."
General Electric,2017-4,"For now at least, Amazon is being treated as a special case in part from the halo effect around its billionaire founder Jeff Bezos, the second-richest person alive. Many view Bezos as an entrepreneurial genius; he's already extended his reach beyond Amazon to start a space exploration company and purchase the Washington Post."
General Electric,2017-4,"""Bezos gets a longer leash to wander around than the typical CEO,"" said Erik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business. But he was not convinced it was entirely justified."
General Electric,2017-4,"""You hesitate to bet on this being the singular team that can do something that history has shown - over and over again - is really hard to do,"" said Gordon."
General Electric,2017-4,"Referring to Walt Disney Co's CEO, he said: ""Leave the movie making to Bob Iger."""

General Electric,2017-4,"The widely watched deliveries, which as of Monday totalled 9 so far in April, include the first aircraft for Icelandic budget carrier WOW air, which said on Tuesday it had taken the jet, powered by new LEAP engines from CFM International, under a leasing deal with Air Lease Corp ."
General Electric,2017-4,"Airbus aims to deliver some 200 of the A320neo jets, the latest version of Airbus's best-selling jet programme, this year. It is equipped with new fuel-saving engines from either CFM, jointly owned by General Electric and France's Safran , or U.S. rival Pratt & Whitney."
General Electric,2017-4,But deliveries have been hampered partly by problems with Pratt & Whitney's new Geared Turbofan engines.
General Electric,2017-4,"Since A320neo deliveries began in 2016, Airbus has delivered 53 aircraft with Pratt & Whitney engines and 50 powered by CFM."
General Electric,2017-4,Pratt & Whitney parent United Technologies on Tuesday reaffirmed plans to deliver 350 to 400 Geared Turbofan engines to planemakers this year. [nL1N1HY0QP]

General Electric,2017-4,"PARIS, April 25 (Reuters) - French engine maker Safran reported higher-than-expected first-quarter revenue on Tuesday, buoyed by aerospace services, and told investors it was pushing ahead with plans to increase production of its LEAP civil jet engine."
General Electric,2017-4,Safran confirmed its 2017 outlook and said its adjusted revenue rose 5.5 percent to 3.982 billion euros ($4.36 billion).
General Electric,2017-4,"It also said it continued to hold merger talks with French seats maker Zodiac Aerospace, after outlining an agreed offer in January, but declined to discuss how they were going or how it might go ahead with the two-pronged bid and merger plan."
General Electric,2017-4,"Zodiac said on April 14 it would delay publication of its half-year results by a week from April 20, saying it had too much on its plate due to the talks. [nL8N1HM1AQ]"
General Electric,2017-4,Reuters reported this month that Safran is exploring plans to lower its $9 billion bid for Zodiac Aerospace and may simplify its structure amid continued turmoil at the seats maker and pressure from its own shareholders. [nL8N1HM1I7]
General Electric,2017-4,"British hedge fund TCI renewed criticism of the deal on Tuesday, saying Safran should suspend the talks pending an audit."
General Electric,2017-4,"Safran Chief Executive Philippe Petitcolin said the company was ""not distracted by this or that investor which chooses to express itself publicly""."
General Electric,2017-4,"Despite doubts raised by some investors over its plans to buy Zodiac, Safran shares have risen since the talks began."
General Electric,2017-4,"Jefferies analyst Sandy Morris said this may be explained by a relatively trouble-free launch so far of the LEAP engine, co-produced with General Electric in the CFM International venture, as well as mishaps affecting rival engine maker Pratt & Whitney."
General Electric,2017-4,"CFM still faces a major hurdle in executing plans for LEAP engine deliveries this year but there have been few problems so far and the first Boeing 737 MAX is on time, he wrote in a note."
General Electric,2017-4,"Deliveries of Pratt & Whitney's engines, which compete with LEAP on the Airbus A320neo, have been slowed by various snags."
General Electric,2017-4,One expert said as many as 72 Pratt engines have been taken off wing for inspection or repairs since entering service.
General Electric,2017-4,"As of mid-April, industry sources say Airbus had delivered a total of 100 A320neo aircraft since the fuel-efficient plane entered service in January 2016, including 53 fitted with Pratt & Whitney engines and the rest with CFM's LEAP engines."
General Electric,2017-4,CFM's shareholders have said they could deliver 450 to 500 LEAP engines this year instead of 500 stated earlier. [nL3N1HT3QI]

General Electric,2017-4,"SANTIAGO, April 25 (Reuters) - General Electric Co is in talks with an independent energy producer to make a significant move into wind power in Chile, two people with knowledge of the process told Reuters, as the conglomerate expands its global renewable footprint."
General Electric,2017-4,"GE is in talks to provide turbines for wind farms to be developed by Ireland's Mainstream Renewable Power throughout Chile, according to the sources, who requested anonymity as the matter is private."
General Electric,2017-4,"The U.S. company would likely take an equity stake in the projects, which would be financed with a mixture of equity and debt, according to one source."
General Electric,2017-4,"The sources did not say what percentage of the project would be funded by each party. The wind farms being set up would require a total investment of up to $1.6 billion, Mainstream has said."
General Electric,2017-4,"Mainstream declined to comment, and GE said it did not comment on rumors or speculation as a matter of company policy."
General Electric,2017-4,"Renewable energy is booming in Chile, which has a tiny hydrocarbon industry but abundant wind and sun. Last year, European renewables firms, including Mainstream, won big in a large auction to supply Chile with power for two decades, beginning in 2021.[nL1N1AY18D]"
General Electric,2017-4,"There have been setbacks, such as delays in the construction of transmission lines and flagging demand from Chile's copper mines. Many of the auction winners are seeking deep-pocketed partners as they embark on project construction."
General Electric,2017-4,"A partnership in Chile would mark the second such deal between Mainstream and GE. Last year, the two said they were teaming up for over $2 billion of investments in wind power in Vietnam, where GE would provide technology and a portion of the funding. [nL4N1D825C]"
General Electric,2017-4,"It would also come during a broader wind power push by GE. In October, the company said it will buy LM Wind Power, a maker of rotor blades used in wind turbines, for $1.65 billion.[nL4N1CH3LD]"
General Electric,2017-4,"Mainstream will build seven utility-scale wind farms to provide some 986 megawatts of power at a relatively low price of around $40 per megawatt-hour, according to the terms of the purchase agreement in last year's auction."
General Electric,2017-4,The sources did not specify if the GE partnership would apply to all seven wind farms.
General Electric,2017-4,"The deal would mark the first significant move into Chilean renewables by GE. The company has long provided services to power generators in Chile, and in April 2016, GE bought into traditional energy in the nation by acquiring 75 percent of a gas-fired power plant."

General Electric,2017-4,* Q1 loss of 24 cents per share vs est. loss of 21 cents
General Electric,2017-4,"April 25 (Reuters) - Baker Hughes Inc said on Tuesday it expects revenue from North America to rise in the current quarter from the first as oil producers drill more onshore wells, helping the oilfield service provider make up for a fall in demand in the Gulf of Mexico."

General Electric,2017-4,"Shares of Baker Hughes, which reported a bigger-than-expected loss on Tuesday, fell as much as 4.3 percent to $56.15, before paring losses to trade down marginally."
General Electric,2017-4,"The company, which is being acquired by General Electric Co , said quarterly revenue fell 15.3 percent to $2.26 billion in the first quarter ended March 31."
General Electric,2017-4,"Analysts' on average had expected revenue of $2.27 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S."
General Electric,2017-4,"In contrast, Schlumberger's first quarter revenue rose 5.7 percent and Halliburton's 1.9 percent."
General Electric,2017-4,"Baker Hughes is much more exposed than Halliburton to international markets, where activity and pricing for oilfield services has remained persistently low."
General Electric,2017-4,"About 31 percent of Baker Hughes' total revenue comes from North America, with operations in the Gulf of Mexico account for 15 percent of its revenue from the region."
General Electric,2017-4,"Net loss attributable to Baker Hughes narrowed to $129 million, or 30 cents per share, in the first quarter ended March 31, from $981 million, or $2.22 per share, a year earlier. [nBw7hQ3Xya]"

General Electric,2017-4,"PARIS, April 25 (Reuters) - Boeing is nearing a decision to launch a larger version of its 737 workhorse jet within two months to counter strong sales of the Airbus A321neo, after a breakthrough on the design for one of its parts, industry sources said."
General Electric,2017-4,"The 737 MAX 10 would narrow the gap between the 178-220 seat 737-9, which first flew this month, and the 185-240 seat A321neo, which dominates the top end of a market for narrowbody jets worth $2 trillion over 20 years. [nL3N1HL2YZ]"

General Electric,2017-4,But it has produced a puzzle so tricky that Boeing has asked for help from its combat jet experts to design a space-saving gear for the 737-10.
General Electric,2017-4,A solution is needed because the 737-10 will be longer than the 737-9 to make room for about 12 extra seats. The landing gear must become taller too or the tail could scrape the runway.
General Electric,2017-4,"Anxious to avoid costly changes to the rest of the plane and stay on schedule, Boeing aims to make the gear longer only when needed, but small enough to fit in the 737's existing wheel bay."
General Electric,2017-4,It has not made final decisions but is testing an advanced proposal to allow the 737 to effectively sit back on its heels as it leaves the runway.
General Electric,2017-4,"This is what aerospace engineers call a ""semi-levered"" design and is a nod to two bigger jets: the 777 and 787-10."
General Electric,2017-4,"In a further twist, the gear would lengthen telescopically for the 737-10 to charge down the runway. Afterwards, it would shrink again to retract into the same space."
General Electric,2017-4,Drawing-board decisions like these feed directly into the battle for jet sales.
General Electric,2017-4,"A longer gear allows pilots to use the same take-off angle rather than easing off to avoid striking the runway with the tail of the longer jet. Shallower take-offs need more runway, limiting the number of airports served and restricting sales."
General Electric,2017-4,"Airbus, which declined comment, will try to persuade potential 737-10 buyers that it is little different from the slow-selling 737-9. It is meanwhile said to be working on its own improvements to the A320 family codenamed A320neo-plus."
General Electric,2017-4,"Market sources say Boeing is offering 5 percent lower costs per seat than the A321neo for the 737-10. Some experts are more cautious on operating costs, leaving jetmakers to slug it out over two other important drivers: range and performance."
General Electric,2017-4,Boeing decided against using a bigger engine to boost those features and is gambling that some airlines will prefer extra seats and fly the 737-10 mainly on short routes.
General Electric,2017-4,"Although reports have focused on the clash between the A321neo and 737-9/10, industry sources say it's not just the top end of the narrowbody market that drives the new design."
General Electric,2017-4,"Because most carriers stick to one jet family, they say Boeing seems worried the A321neo's success could prompt fleet decisions that weaken the smaller 737 MAX 8. The 737-10 would thus be an extra rampart to defend Boeing's biggest cash cow."

General Electric,2017-4,"PARIS, April 25 (Reuters) - Boeing is nearing a decision to launch a larger version of its 737 workhorse jet within two months to counter strong sales of the Airbus A321neo, after a breakthrough on the design for one of its parts, industry sources said."
General Electric,2017-4,"The 737 MAX 10 would narrow the gap between the 178-220 seat 737-9, which first flew this month, and the 185-240 seat A321neo, which dominates the top end of the market for narrowbody jets. [nL3N1HL2YZ]"
General Electric,2017-4,"Boeing has been studying how to solve a tricky problem with the design of the plane's landing gear, without adding cost or delaying a 2020 target for first deliveries."
General Electric,2017-4,The sources said a two-part technical solution is being tested and that Boeing is negotiating with airlines with the aim of launching the 737-10 at the Paris Airshow in June.
General Electric,2017-4,"""Boeing is actively engaged in discussions with customers about the 737 MAX 10X,"" a spokesman said."
General Electric,2017-4,"""No decision has been made on the airplane and any discussion on timing of a possible launch would be speculative."""
General Electric,2017-4,"Reuters reported last year that the 737-10 marks a quick tactical response to the A321neo, while Boeing works on pivotal plans for a 220-260-seat twin-aisle, mid-market jet. [nL8N18Q0PX]"
General Electric,2017-4,But it has produced a puzzle so tricky that Boeing has asked for help from its combat jet experts to design a space-saving gear for the 737-10.
General Electric,2017-4,A solution is needed because the 737-10 will be longer than the 737-9 to make room for about 12 extra seats. The landing gear must become taller too or the tail could scrape the runway.
General Electric,2017-4,"Anxious to avoid costly changes to the rest of the plane and stay on schedule, Boeing aims to make the gear longer only when needed, but small enough to fit in the 737's existing wheel bay."
General Electric,2017-4,It has not made final decisions but is testing an advanced proposal to allow the 737 to effectively sit back on its heels as it leaves the runway.
General Electric,2017-4,"This is what aerospace engineers call a ""semi-levered"" design and is a nod to two bigger jets: the 777 and 787-10."
General Electric,2017-4,"In a further twist, the gear would lengthen telescopically for the 737-10 to charge down the runway. Afterwards, it would shrink again to retract into the same space."

General Electric,2017-4,"SHANGHAI/PARIS, April 25 (Reuters) - When China unveiled an historic order for its first large commercial jetliner at a national air show in 2010, Western journalists were kept away, and only local media were allowed to witness a major turning point in China's aviation ambitions."
General Electric,2017-4,"The COMAC C919 jet is expected to stage its maiden flight in the coming weeks, and foreign media and potential buyers will be invited in force - illustrating how Beijing is adjusting to competition for a slice of global jet sales worth $2 trillion over the next 20 years."
General Electric,2017-4,"But after three years of delays and almost a decade in development, China's answer to the Boeing 737 and its state-owned designers face a daunting phase: selling the jet abroad in a market dominated by Boeing and Airbus ."
General Electric,2017-4,"""They will be trying to compete on price against people who are building aircraft at a much faster pace and with more experience, so there's a risk of getting bled dry,"" said Richard Aboulafia, aerospace analyst at Virginia-based Teal Group."
General Electric,2017-4,"Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC) has some cards to play: its plane has Western engines and avionics coupled with a new design; it's rolling out a pilot training programme, expanding international staff and has strong, behind-the-scenes backing from Beijing, industry executives say."
General Electric,2017-4,"And though still unproven, COMAC could be the single biggest threat over the coming decades to the dominance of Boeing and Airbus, both in China's own huge aviation market and, longer-term, overseas. The C919 is the first step to this."
General Electric,2017-4,"Beijing's backing for the single-aisle plane gives COMAC a springboard in the world's fastest-growing domestic market, even though the company acknowledges much bigger hurdles abroad."
General Electric,2017-4,"""You can't compare us to Boeing or Airbus, they're in a different strategic stage... We took half a century to solve the first strategic issue (of plane development), it will also take many years to solve the second (market) problem,"" said Jeff Cheng, a spokesman for COMAC. ""After the first flight, we have to focus and research on how to improve the plane's and COMAC's market competitiveness."""
General Electric,2017-4,"Eric Chen, president of Airbus Commercial Aircraft China, welcomed the competition from COMAC, and a China-based spokesman for Boeing congratulated the company on developing the C919."
General Electric,2017-4,"The C919 has chalked up 570 firm orders and commitments from 23 customers, mainly Chinese state-backed airlines and leasing companies, but says it is not able to give a breakdown."
General Electric,2017-4,"In comparison, the latest version of the Boeing 737 had more than 3,000 firm orders before it flew last January."
General Electric,2017-4,"Those types of numbers from the two big global planemakers come after decades of trimming costs and honing marketing pitches. The two have global support networks able to respond whenever a jet breaks down just about anywhere, and the number of jets flying makes it easier for airlines to raise loans to buy them."
General Electric,2017-4,"While Chinese financiers have muscled into the global aviation arena, COMAC has a relatively low-key presence at international air shows and has said the C919 will initially be aimed at the domestic market. But there are signs it's adopting a more outward-facing approach."
General Electric,2017-4,"While operating manuals for COMAC's smaller ARJ21 regional jet, which took its first flight in 2007, were written in Mandarin, the C919's will be in English to support sales."
General Electric,2017-4,"COMAC's sales and support networks - it has at least 50 people in its sales and marketing departments, says Cheng - are, however, a fraction of those at Boeing and Airbus."
General Electric,2017-4,"Still, COMAC's home advantage is significant as Chinese airlines are likely to drive airplane demand over the next two decades, buying nearly 7,000 planes - mostly from Boeing and Airbus."
General Electric,2017-4,"""Their sales person is the government,"" said a Chinese airline executive, who didn't want to be named for risk of damaging business relationships. ""As long as the government tells the state airlines to purchase planes, that will happen."""
General Electric,2017-4,"Airline executives say the first flight is when COMAC can realistically start discussing deposits and firming up customers, even if the plane still faces years of testing."
General Electric,2017-4,"""We haven't placed a deposit; at the moment it's intentions,"" said Che Shanglun, chairman of Xiamen Airlines, a subsidiary of China Southern Airlines <600029.SS><1055.HK>, which has committed to buying up to 50 of the 158-seat C919s."
General Electric,2017-4,"""We signed for 50, but we actually want to buy 30. We have to see if they're able to produce it... They (COMAC) are very enthusiastic, they meet us every month and send us updates."""
General Electric,2017-4,"Executives at two Chinese airlines which have not placed orders for the aircraft said they wanted to see the C919's safety record, as well as the creation of a global support team."
General Electric,2017-4,"The safety certification of the new plane - which state media says will have a catalogue price tag of around $50 million, less than half that of a Boeing 737 or Airbus A320 - could be among the biggest issues for the C919 internationally."
General Electric,2017-4,"Having a plane certified to fly commercially is tough enough even for Western jetmakers as aircraft become more complex and supply chains expand. There is still uncertainty over approvals needed for the C919 to secure a foothold beyond China, with the United States and European Union having the most influence."
General Electric,2017-4,"Although the EU has agreed to recognise some of the checks carried out by China, it is expected to insist on some of its own tests before issuing a safety certificate and is trying to understand where discrepancies between the two systems lie."
General Electric,2017-4,"""We are just at the start of the process,"" said Patrick Ky, executive director of the European Aviation Safety Agency."
General Electric,2017-4,The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
General Electric,2017-4,"Without Western approvals, China would only be able to sell to countries that accept its certification standards. Zimbabwe, Bolivia and Tajikistan have previously bought Chinese planes."
General Electric,2017-4,"Without Western certification, ""sales of the aircraft in developed economies and many developing economies will be difficult to impossible,"" said Bradley Perrett, a veteran China watcher at Aviation Week."
General Electric,2017-4,"The C919's only real foreign buyer so far is leasing firm GE Capital Aviation Services, whose parent General Electric co-built the plane's engine with France's Safran ."

General Electric,2017-4,"NEW YORK, April 21 (Reuters) - General Electric Co reported quarterly sales and adjusted earnings results that beat analysts estimates on Friday, but its shares fell on concerns about some of its industrial businesses and its cash outflow."
General Electric,2017-4,"The maker of jet engines, power plants and other industrial equipment also reported a negative $1.6 billion in cash flow from industrial operating activities compared with a negative $600 million it expected for the quarter due to a $1.3 billion increase in working capital and the timing of bills to customers."
General Electric,2017-4,"Investors have been watching cash flow as an indicator of GE's operating performance, and GE said it still expects to hit its cash target of $12 billion to $14 billion for the full year."
General Electric,2017-4,"Shares were down 2.3 percent at $29.57 in afternoon trading, making it the second-biggest decliner on the Dow Jones Industrial Average."
General Electric,2017-4,"""There was immediate disappointment that cash came in low,"" said Deane Dray, analyst at RBC Capital markets. Analysts asked numerous questions about it on the conference call and ""it gave investors a reason not to feel good about the quarter."""
General Electric,2017-4,"The company also raised concern by giving itself wiggle room to deliver fewer LEAP aircraft engines this year, a key risk for the company. It said the range for the year was 450 to 500 engines, instead of nearly 500 it stated earlier."
General Electric,2017-4,"""It is notable that GE is taking a more cautious slant by backing away from a firm target of ""500,"" Vertical Research Partners analyst Rob Stallard said."
General Electric,2017-4,But GE Chief Financial Officer Jeff Bornstein said in an interview there was no change in the LEAP forecast.
General Electric,2017-4,"""We're not changing our view on our ability to deliver the LEAP engine this year for Boeing and Airbus,"" Bornstein said."
General Electric,2017-4,"GE shipped 81 engines in the first quarter and expects to ship 100 in the second quarter, he said, adding: ""There's no delays to customers whatsoever."""
General Electric,2017-4,"GE beat analysts estimates for adjusted earnings and revenue, even though revenue fell 1 percent to $27.66 billion, due to lower sales in its oil-and-gas and lighting businesses. Analysts expected $26.26 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S."
General Electric,2017-4,"Adjusted earnings of 21 cents a share were unchanged from a year ago and beat analyst estimates of 17 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S."
General Electric,2017-4,"GE said industrial organic revenue, which is from continuing businesses, grew 7 percent in the quarter, a strong showing according to analysts. Industrial operating profit margins rose by 1.3 percent points, also more than analysts expected, and ahead of the 1 percentage point forecast for the year."
General Electric,2017-4,"Chief Executive Officer Jeff Immelt noted a 10 percent rise in quarterly orders and said the world economy was ""an attractive environment for GE."""

General Electric,2017-4,* Pence witnesses signing of $10 bln in agreements with US firms
General Electric,2017-4,"JAKARTA, April 21 (Reuters) - Indonesia and the United States agreed on Friday to find ways to reduce barriers to U.S. companies operating in Southeast Asia's largest economy, visiting U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and Jakarta's investment chief said."
General Electric,2017-4,The Trump administration has put Indonesia on a list of 16 countries whose trade surpluses with the United States will be put under review. A series of disputes between Indonesia and American firms has also ruffled ties.
General Electric,2017-4,"""We will work with President Jokowi to reduce barriers to trade and investments and to create a truly level playing field where all our businesses have equal opportunity and market access,"" Pence said. Jokowi is the nickname of Indonesia's President Joko Widodo."
General Electric,2017-4,"""The president and I spoke about that very candidly and very respectfully,"" Pence told a roundtable discussion with business executives in Jakarta before flying to Australia on the last leg of his 10-day Asia-Pacific tour."
General Electric,2017-4,"Indonesia's investments barriers include a lack of intellectual property protection, insufficient transparency with regulations and requiring local content for manufactured goods sold in the Indonesian market, Pence said."
General Electric,2017-4,"Indonesia's Investment Coordinating Board chief Tom Lembong said Widodo agreed ""we still have too many regulations, too many barriers to trade, and these are bad for local and international industries""."
General Electric,2017-4,"""I'm optimistic because President Jokowi and President Trump are both lifelong business people, and I think they are very focused on the practical issues that hinder business and investment,"" Lembong told Reuters. ""I feel that the Trump administration and the Jokowi administration are on the same wavelength."""
General Electric,2017-4,"Lembong said Indonesia needs both investment and imports from the United States, ""especially productivity-enhancing products and services. You need imports to boost exports."""
General Electric,2017-4,Neither side disclosed any discussions about the disputes Indonesia has had with American companies of late.
General Electric,2017-4,"Over the past six months, Indonesia has wrestled with mining giant Freeport McMoRan , demanding the company divest 51 percent of its shares in its Papua-based gold and copper mine, and has demanded that Google Inc. settle unpaid taxes and fines of more than $400 million. Jakarta also scrubbed JP Morgan from its list of primary bond dealers after what was deemed a negative research report."
General Electric,2017-4,"Pence did, however, witness the signing of more than $10 billion in memoranda of understanding with U.S. companies in Indonesia on Friday."
General Electric,2017-4,"Among the 11 agreements were ones by Exxon Mobil to sell liquefied natural gas to Pertamina, Lockheed Martin to provide upgrades to the Indonesian Air Force's F-16s, and General Electric to develop electrical infrastructure in Indonesia."
General Electric,2017-4,"""We think there are opportunities to clear open the way for American companies to participate more greatly in Indonesia,"" Pence said, adding the agreements would ""draw our nations closer together and benefit both our people."""
General Electric,2017-4,"Pence said in opening remarks to the roundtable that an attack in central Paris is the latest reminder terrorism can strike anywhere at anytime, and the United States would not relent in its efforts to end terrorism."
General Electric,2017-4,"""The people of Indonesia can be confident in the wake of this latest attack: We will not relent in our effort to end terrorism and the threat it presents to both of our peoples,"" Pence said."
General Electric,2017-4,A French policeman was shot dead and two others were wounded in central Paris on Thursday night in an attack carried out days before presidential elections and quickly claimed by the Islamic State militant group.
General Electric,2017-4,"Indonesia, the world's largest Muslim-majority nation, has itself been hit by a series of deadly attacks over the past 15 years, led by militants affiliated with al Qaeda and more recently by Islamic State."
General Electric,2017-4,"Pence said Washington would continue working with Indonesia to combat terrorism. On Thursday, Pence toured the Istiqlal Mosque in Jakarta, Southeast Asia's largest, and said Indonesia's moderate form of Islam should serve as an example to other nations."
General Electric,2017-4,"Indonesia has expressed concern about the Trump administration's proposal to bar entry to citizens of some predominantly Muslim nations. That plan, however, remains stalled in courts."
General Electric,2017-4,Pence on Thursday announced Trump would visit Southeast Asia in November for an annual series of regional summits. They include the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting in Vietnam and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit in the Philippines.

General Electric,2017-4,"RIYADH, April 17 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia aims to produce 10 percent of its power from renewable sources in the next six years as it pushes ahead with a multi-billion-dollar plan to diversify its energy mix and free up more crude oil for export."
General Electric,2017-4,The drive by the world's top oil exporter will see the kingdom developing 30 solar and wind projects by 2023 to boost its electricity generation and reduce crude oil burning.
General Electric,2017-4,Saudi Arabia is targeting 9.5 gigawatt (GW) of renewable energy by 2023. The renewables initiative involves investment estimated between $30 billion and $50 billion.
General Electric,2017-4,"Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih kicked off the massive renewable programme in Riyadh on Monday by announcing the beginning of the bidding process for a 300 megawatt (MW) solar power project, which is expected to come online by 2018-2019."
General Electric,2017-4,"""The energy mix to produce electricity will change, today the kingdom uses large quantities of oil liquids, including crude, fuel oil and diesel,"" Falih said."
General Electric,2017-4,"""So the percentage of renewable energy by 2023 (will be) 10 percent of total installed capacity in the kingdom."""
General Electric,2017-4,"Under an economic reform programme launched last year, known as Vision 2030, Saudi Arabia is seeking to use non-oil means to generate much of its additional future energy needs to avoid running down oil resources and diversify its economy."
General Electric,2017-4,The kingdom is restructuring its energy sector as part of Vision 2030 and a focus on renewable projects is a pillar of this transformation as it would help develop the private sector and create thousands of jobs.
General Electric,2017-4,"""Since the restructuring of the energy sector ... one of our key priorities is to engage with the private sector,"" Falih said, adding he was confident the programme would be delivered."
General Electric,2017-4,"Saudi Arabia has short-listed 27 companies for its solar power project and 24 firms for its wind project, the energy ministry said last week. [nL8N1HI3KK]"
General Electric,2017-4,"France's EDF Energies Nouvelles , Japanese companies Marubeni Corp <8002.T> and Mitsui & Co <8031.T> and Saudi Acwa Power are among the firms which have qualified to bid for the 300 MW solar PV project in Sakaka, the al-Jouf Province in the north of the kingdom."
General Electric,2017-4,"Abu Dhabi Future Energy Company (Masdar), GE , Marubeni Corporation, Mitsui & Co., JGC Corp <1963.T>, SNC Lavalin Arabia and Iberdrola Renovables Energia are among those qualified to bid for the 400 MW wind farm project in Midyan in the northwest."
General Electric,2017-4,"The kingdom also plans to launch a second bidding round for 400 MW of wind power at a project in Domat al-Jandal in al-Jouf Province by the fourth quarter of this year, which will be followed by 620 MW of solar power, Turki Shehri, head of the renewable energy project development office at the energy ministry told reporters on Monday."
General Electric,2017-4,"""This will come in stages. It (wind power project) will come in the fourth quarter of this year with Domat al-Jandal, and then the 620 MW (solar) will come immediately after that in phases,"" he said."
General Electric,2017-4,"The projects will be tendered on a build, operate and own basis, meaning the companies which win the projects will retain ownership for 20 years for the solar plants and 25 years for the wind, Shehri said."
General Electric,2017-4,"State oil giant Saudi Aramco would be interested in investing in the second bidding round for renewable projects as it aims to play a major role in the sector, Abdulaziz al-Judaimi, senior vice president for downstream at Aramco said."
General Electric,2017-4,"Aramco, which is preparing to list up to 5 percent of its shares by next year, has created a department for renewables within the company to develop wind and solar projects."
General Electric,2017-4,"The kingdom has a long-term goal of increasing the use of gas for domestic power generation, thus reducing oil burning at home and freeing up more crude for export."
General Electric,2017-4,This could help increase Aramco's valuation as it generates more revenue from exports than selling oil at lower domestic prices - Saudi Arabia is the world's fifth-biggest oil consumer despite being only the 20th biggest economy.
General Electric,2017-4,"The OPEC heavyweight burned an average of 700,000 bpd of oil for electricity to keep the population cool in the hottest months from May to August."
General Electric,2017-4,"The expansion into renewables will help the kingdom to save 18 million barrels of oil equivalent being consumed for electricity generation by 2020, Shehri said."

General Electric,2017-4,* Pence witnesses signing of $10 bln in agreements with US firms
General Electric,2017-4,"JAKARTA, April 21 (Reuters) - Indonesia and the United States agreed on Friday to find ways to reduce barriers to U.S. companies operating in Southeast Asia's largest economy, visiting U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and Jakarta's investment chief said."
General Electric,2017-4,The Trump administration has put Indonesia on a list of 16 countries whose trade surpluses with the United States will be put under review. A series of disputes between Indonesia and American firms has also ruffled ties.
General Electric,2017-4,"""We will work with President Jokowi to reduce barriers to trade and investments and to create a truly level playing field where all our businesses have equal opportunity and market access,"" Pence said. Jokowi is the nickname of Indonesia's President Joko Widodo."
General Electric,2017-4,"""The president and I spoke about that very candidly and very respectfully,"" Pence told a roundtable discussion with business executives in Jakarta before flying to Australia on the last leg of his 10-day Asia-Pacific tour."
General Electric,2017-4,"Indonesia's investments barriers include a lack of intellectual property protection, insufficient transparency with regulations and requiring local content for manufactured goods sold in the Indonesian market, Pence said."
General Electric,2017-4,"Indonesia's Investment Coordinating Board chief Tom Lembong said Widodo agreed ""we still have too many regulations, too many barriers to trade, and these are bad for local and international industries""."
General Electric,2017-4,"""I'm optimistic because President Jokowi and President Trump are both lifelong business people, and I think they are very focused on the practical issues that hinder business and investment,"" Lembong told Reuters. ""I feel that the Trump administration and the Jokowi administration are on the same wavelength."""
General Electric,2017-4,"Lembong said Indonesia needs both investment and imports from the United States, ""especially productivity-enhancing products and services. You need imports to boost exports."""
General Electric,2017-4,Neither side disclosed any discussions about the disputes Indonesia has had with American companies of late.
General Electric,2017-4,"Over the past six months, Indonesia has wrestled with mining giant Freeport McMoRan , demanding the company divest 51 percent of its shares in its Papua-based gold and copper mine, and has demanded that Google Inc. settle unpaid taxes and fines of more than $400 million. Jakarta also scrubbed JP Morgan from its list of primary bond dealers after what was deemed a negative research report."
General Electric,2017-4,"Pence did, however, witness the signing of more than $10 billion in memoranda of understanding with U.S. companies in Indonesia on Friday."
General Electric,2017-4,"Among the 11 agreements were ones by Exxon Mobil to sell liquefied natural gas to Pertamina, Lockheed Martin to provide upgrades to the Indonesian Air Force's F-16s, and General Electric to develop electrical infrastructure in Indonesia."
General Electric,2017-4,"""We think there are opportunities to clear open the way for American companies to participate more greatly in Indonesia,"" Pence said, adding the agreements would ""draw our nations closer together and benefit both our people."""
General Electric,2017-4,"Pence said in opening remarks to the roundtable that an attack in central Paris is the latest reminder terrorism can strike anywhere at anytime, and the United States would not relent in its efforts to end terrorism."
General Electric,2017-4,"""The people of Indonesia can be confident in the wake of this latest attack: We will not relent in our effort to end terrorism and the threat it presents to both of our peoples,"" Pence said."
General Electric,2017-4,A French policeman was shot dead and two others were wounded in central Paris on Thursday night in an attack carried out days before presidential elections and quickly claimed by the Islamic State militant group.
General Electric,2017-4,"Indonesia, the world's largest Muslim-majority nation, has itself been hit by a series of deadly attacks over the past 15 years, led by militants affiliated with al Qaeda and more recently by Islamic State."
General Electric,2017-4,"Pence said Washington would continue working with Indonesia to combat terrorism. On Thursday, Pence toured the Istiqlal Mosque in Jakarta, Southeast Asia's largest, and said Indonesia's moderate form of Islam should serve as an example to other nations."
General Electric,2017-4,"Indonesia has expressed concern about the Trump administration's proposal to bar entry to citizens of some predominantly Muslim nations. That plan, however, remains stalled in courts."
General Electric,2017-4,Pence on Thursday announced Trump would visit Southeast Asia in November for an annual series of regional summits. They include the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting in Vietnam and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit in the Philippines.

General Electric,2017-4,"RIYADH, April 17 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia aims to produce 10 percent of its power from renewable sources in the next six years as it pushes ahead with a multi-billion-dollar plan to diversify its energy mix and free up more crude oil for export."
General Electric,2017-4,The drive by the world's top oil exporter will see the kingdom developing 30 solar and wind projects by 2023 to boost its electricity generation and reduce crude oil burning.
General Electric,2017-4,Saudi Arabia is targeting 9.5 gigawatt (GW) of renewable energy by 2023. The renewables initiative involves investment estimated between $30 billion and $50 billion.
General Electric,2017-4,"Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih kicked off the massive renewable programme in Riyadh on Monday by announcing the beginning of the bidding process for a 300 megawatt (MW) solar power project, which is expected to come online by 2018-2019."
General Electric,2017-4,"""The energy mix to produce electricity will change, today the kingdom uses large quantities of oil liquids, including crude, fuel oil and diesel,"" Falih said."
General Electric,2017-4,"""So the percentage of renewable energy by 2023 (will be) 10 percent of total installed capacity in the kingdom."""
General Electric,2017-4,"Under an economic reform programme launched last year, known as Vision 2030, Saudi Arabia is seeking to use non-oil means to generate much of its additional future energy needs to avoid running down oil resources and diversify its economy."
General Electric,2017-4,The kingdom is restructuring its energy sector as part of Vision 2030 and a focus on renewable projects is a pillar of this transformation as it would help develop the private sector and create thousands of jobs.
General Electric,2017-4,"""Since the restructuring of the energy sector ... one of our key priorities is to engage with the private sector,"" Falih said, adding he was confident the programme would be delivered."
General Electric,2017-4,"Saudi Arabia has short-listed 27 companies for its solar power project and 24 firms for its wind project, the energy ministry said last week. [nL8N1HI3KK]"
General Electric,2017-4,"France's EDF Energies Nouvelles , Japanese companies Marubeni Corp <8002.T> and Mitsui & Co <8031.T> and Saudi Acwa Power are among the firms which have qualified to bid for the 300 MW solar PV project in Sakaka, the al-Jouf Province in the north of the kingdom."
General Electric,2017-4,"Abu Dhabi Future Energy Company (Masdar), GE , Marubeni Corporation, Mitsui & Co., JGC Corp <1963.T>, SNC Lavalin Arabia and Iberdrola Renovables Energia are among those qualified to bid for the 400 MW wind farm project in Midyan in the northwest."
General Electric,2017-4,"The kingdom also plans to launch a second bidding round for 400 MW of wind power at a project in Domat al-Jandal in al-Jouf Province by the fourth quarter of this year, which will be followed by 620 MW of solar power, Turki Shehri, head of the renewable energy project development office at the energy ministry told reporters on Monday."
General Electric,2017-4,"""This will come in stages. It (wind power project) will come in the fourth quarter of this year with Domat al-Jandal, and then the 620 MW (solar) will come immediately after that in phases,"" he said."
General Electric,2017-4,"The projects will be tendered on a build, operate and own basis, meaning the companies which win the projects will retain ownership for 20 years for the solar plants and 25 years for the wind, Shehri said."
General Electric,2017-4,"State oil giant Saudi Aramco would be interested in investing in the second bidding round for renewable projects as it aims to play a major role in the sector, Abdulaziz al-Judaimi, senior vice president for downstream at Aramco said."
General Electric,2017-4,"Aramco, which is preparing to list up to 5 percent of its shares by next year, has created a department for renewables within the company to develop wind and solar projects."
General Electric,2017-4,"The kingdom has a long-term goal of increasing the use of gas for domestic power generation, thus reducing oil burning at home and freeing up more crude for export."
General Electric,2017-4,This could help increase Aramco's valuation as it generates more revenue from exports than selling oil at lower domestic prices - Saudi Arabia is the world's fifth-biggest oil consumer despite being only the 20th biggest economy.
General Electric,2017-4,"The OPEC heavyweight burned an average of 700,000 bpd of oil for electricity to keep the population cool in the hottest months from May to August."
General Electric,2017-4,"The expansion into renewables will help the kingdom to save 18 million barrels of oil equivalent being consumed for electricity generation by 2020, Shehri said."

General Electric,2017-4,"WASHINGTON, April 11 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump told a group of chief executives on Tuesday that his administration was revamping the Wall Street reform law known as Dodd-Frank and might eliminate the rules and replace them with ""something else."""
General Electric,2017-4,"At the beginning of his administration, Trump ordered reviews of the major banking rules put in place after the 2008 financial crisis, and last week he said officials were planning a ""major haircut"" for them."
General Electric,2017-4,"""For the bankers in the room, they'll be very happy because we're really doing a major streamlining and, perhaps, elimination, and replacing it with something else,"" Trump said on Tuesday."
General Electric,2017-4,"""That will be the minimum. But we're doing a major elimination of the horrendous Dodd-Frank regulations, keeping some obviously, but getting rid of many,"" he said."
General Electric,2017-4,"The White House is not unilaterally able to upend Dodd-Frank's rules, almost all of which are implemented by independent regulatory agencies like the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Reserve."
General Electric,2017-4,"A sweeping change to the law would require congressional action, though in some cases regulators may also have wiggle room to make changes through a formal rule-making process."
General Electric,2017-4,"In February, Trump issued an executive order requiring Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin to consult with U.S. regulators and submit a report outlining a proposal for possible regulatory and legislative changes that would help fuel economic growth and promote American business interests."
General Electric,2017-4,"That report, due to be released in June, will likely serve as a blueprint for possible changes down the road."
General Electric,2017-4,"Congressional action on a Wall Street bill is not expected in the near term, as Congress focuses primarily on healthcare and tax reform."
General Electric,2017-4,"On Tuesday, House of Representatives Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling announced that he was planning to introduce a new draft by month's end of sweeping legislation known as the ""Financial CHOICE Act"" that would give Dodd-Frank a major overhaul."
General Electric,2017-4,The new draft of the bill would largely defang the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's supervisory powers and make the director removable at will.
General Electric,2017-4,It would also revamp bank stress-testing rules and loosen securities regulations to help companies raise cash.
General Electric,2017-4,"The bill is likely to face an uphill battle in the Senate, where Democrats are expected to be resistant and a 60-vote threshold is needed to pass legislation."
General Electric,2017-4,"Participants in Tuesday's meeting included Rich Lesser, chief executive of Boston Consulting Group; Doug McMillon, chief executive of Wal-Mart Stores Inc ; Indra Nooyi, chief executive of PepsiCo ; Jim McNerney, former chief executive of Boeing Co ; Ginni Rometty, chief executive of IBM ; and Jack Welch, former chairman of General Electric Co ."

General Electric,2017-4,"WASHINGTON, April 7 (Reuters) - An internal White House conflict over the future of the U.S. Export-Import Bank is keeping the government trade lender hobbled in the face of China's massive state export finance offensive, EXIM's acting chairman said."
General Electric,2017-4,"Charles ""CJ"" Hall told Reuters in an interview late on Thursday that Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross supports restoring the bank's full lending powers as part of President Donald Trump's push to boost U.S. exports and manufacturing jobs."
General Electric,2017-4,"He said there also were statements from several lawmakers that Trump himself supports EXIM's mission, [nL2N1HE1LC] but the same conservative Republican ""ideologues"" who tried to close the bank in 2015 are standing in the way of nominating new board members."
General Electric,2017-4,"""There is a debate in the administration between differing views on EXIM Bank. I would characterize that debate in its simplest form as between pragmatists and ideologues,"" Hall said."
General Electric,2017-4,"Conservative Republicans, including House Speaker Paul Ryan, have fought for years to revoke EXIM's charter, charging that it provides unnecessary ""corporate welfare"" to giant corporations such as Boeing Co , General Electric Co and Caterpillar Inc ."
General Electric,2017-4,"Its charter was allowed to expire in 2015, but was restored five months later after a bitter fight in Congress. But with only two of five board seats filled and Obama nominees blocked last year, its loans and guarantees are capped at $10 million, preventing it from financing large exports such as commercial aircraft and power turbines."
General Electric,2017-4,"Hall, an Obama administration appointee who was asked to stay on for six months as Trump took office in January, was unusually candid about the split for an executive agency chief."
General Electric,2017-4,"""Secretary Ross is one of the pragmatists"" who supports restoring EXIM's full powers, Hall said."
General Electric,2017-4,"""In terms of identifying the others, I would say it's more the Heritage Foundation point of view. And we know there are a lot of people from the Heritage Foundation who are salted around the Executive Office of the President, both in the White House and the Office of Management and Budget."""
General Electric,2017-4,"Dan Holler, a spokesman for the foundation's political arm, Heritage Action for America, said that EXIM too often helps foreign competitors, citing Mexico's state oil company Pemex, which benefited from $7 billion in EXIM financing for U.S. exports between 2007 and 2013."
General Electric,2017-4,"""Unless Secretary Ross can demonstrate the bank actually creates jobs in America, there is really no argument for moving forward,"" Holler said."
General Electric,2017-4,"Hall said the bank fits into Trump's trade ""sweet-spot"" to boost U.S. exports and compete more effectively with China."
General Electric,2017-4,"In 2015, China's three export credit agencies provided $576 billion in total financing and guarantees, while a curtailed EXIM did only $10.6 billion. Hall noted that in 2014 and 2015, the Chinese agencies provided more financing than EXIM has in its entire 83-year history."

General Electric,2017-4,"SEATTLE, April 5 (Reuters) - Boeing Co said on Wednesday it had launched a venture capital arm and invested in two tech startups, a fresh sign of the importance big companies see in keeping up with rapidly evolving technology for designing and making products."
General Electric,2017-4,"Boeing's new division, known as HorizonX, invested in Upskill, a Washington, D.C.-based software company that uses Google Glass-type eye wear to help assembly workers with complex tasks such as creating wiring bundles for Boeing jetliners."
General Electric,2017-4,"It also invested in Zunum Aero, a Seattle-area company that is working on electric-hybrid aircraft aimed at bringing down the cost of flying to regional airports. Zunum also received funding from JetBlue Technology Ventures, a unit of the New York-based JetBlue Airways Corp ."
General Electric,2017-4,"Boeing and JetBlue are not alone in taking stakes in promising technology companies. General Electric Co's venture arm invested in an earlier Upskill funding round, and Airbus has had a venture fund since 2014."
General Electric,2017-4,"Boeing is not aiming to profit from the ventures directly but instead to access technology used in autonomous vehicles, machine learning, additive manufacturing and wearable devices, said Steve Nordlund, a Boeing vice president who heads HorizonX."
General Electric,2017-4,"""These are all starting to converge and have the potential to fundamentally change how we operate inside and outside of companies,"" he said."
General Electric,2017-4,"Upskill's software platform for example, brings data typically stored in books into workers' tools. The system can be used in manufacturing, field service and shipping and warehouse logistics, and the company's revenue growth is in triple digits annually, Chief Executive Officer Brian Ballard told Reuters."
General Electric,2017-4,"""Imagine working on a car and not having to flip through the paper manual,"" Ballard said. Typical systems pay back in a few months. Upskill has been working with Boeing for two years and has moved beyond pilot tests into production."
General Electric,2017-4,"Boeing declined to specify investment amounts, ""but this initiative represents a multi-year commitment by Boeing to spend tens of millions of dollars a year to advance innovation and to supplement our research and development efforts,"" spokesman Chaz Bickers said."
General Electric,2017-4,"Nordlund was formerly vice president of strategy for Boeing's defense, space and security business and was involved in launching drone-maker Insitu Inc, which Boeing acquired in 2008.

General Electric,2017-4,"WASHINGTON, April 11 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump told a group of chief executives on Tuesday that his administration was revamping the Wall Street reform law known as Dodd-Frank and might eliminate the rules and replace them with ""something else."""
General Electric,2017-4,"At the beginning of his administration, Trump ordered reviews of the major banking rules put in place after the 2008 financial crisis, and last week he said officials were planning a ""major haircut"" for them."
General Electric,2017-4,"""For the bankers in the room, they'll be very happy because we're really doing a major streamlining and, perhaps, elimination, and replacing it with something else,"" Trump said on Tuesday."
General Electric,2017-4,"""That will be the minimum. But we're doing a major elimination of the horrendous Dodd-Frank regulations, keeping some obviously, but getting rid of many,"" he said."
General Electric,2017-4,"The White House is not unilaterally able to upend Dodd-Frank's rules, almost all of which are implemented by independent regulatory agencies like the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Reserve."
General Electric,2017-4,"A sweeping change to the law would require congressional action, though in some cases regulators may also have wiggle room to make changes through a formal rule-making process."
General Electric,2017-4,"In February, Trump issued an executive order requiring Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin to consult with U.S. regulators and submit a report outlining a proposal for possible regulatory and legislative changes that would help fuel economic growth and promote American business interests."
General Electric,2017-4,"That report, due to be released in June, will likely serve as a blueprint for possible changes down the road."
General Electric,2017-4,"Congressional action on a Wall Street bill is not expected in the near term, as Congress focuses primarily on healthcare and tax reform."
General Electric,2017-4,"On Tuesday, House of Representatives Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling announced that he was planning to introduce a new draft by month's end of sweeping legislation known as the ""Financial CHOICE Act"" that would give Dodd-Frank a major overhaul."
General Electric,2017-4,The new draft of the bill would largely defang the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's supervisory powers and make the director removable at will.
General Electric,2017-4,It would also revamp bank stress-testing rules and loosen securities regulations to help companies raise cash.
General Electric,2017-4,"The bill is likely to face an uphill battle in the Senate, where Democrats are expected to be resistant and a 60-vote threshold is needed to pass legislation."
General Electric,2017-4,"Participants in Tuesday's meeting included Rich Lesser, chief executive of Boston Consulting Group; Doug McMillon, chief executive of Wal-Mart Stores Inc ; Indra Nooyi, chief executive of PepsiCo ; Jim McNerney, former chief executive of Boeing Co ; Ginni Rometty, chief executive of IBM ; and Jack Welch, former chairman of General Electric Co ."
General Electric,2017-4,"The business leaders are part of Trump's ""Strategy and Policy Forum"" that last met with him in February."
General Electric,2017-4,"Trump also reiterated his criticism of the North Atlantic Free Trade Agreement between the United States, Canada and Mexico."
General Electric,2017-4,"""NAFTA is a disaster. It's been a disaster from the day it was devised. And we're going to have some very pleasant surprises for you on NAFTA, that I can tell you,"" he said."

General Electric,2017-4,"WASHINGTON, April 7 (Reuters) - An internal White House conflict over the future of the U.S. Export-Import Bank is keeping the government trade lender hobbled in the face of China's massive state export finance offensive, EXIM's acting chairman said."
General Electric,2017-4,"Charles ""CJ"" Hall told Reuters in an interview late on Thursday that Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross supports restoring the bank's full lending powers as part of President Donald Trump's push to boost U.S. exports and manufacturing jobs."
General Electric,2017-4,"He said there also were statements from several lawmakers that Trump himself supports EXIM's mission, [nL2N1HE1LC] but the same conservative Republican ""ideologues"" who tried to close the bank in 2015 are standing in the way of nominating new board members."
General Electric,2017-4,"""There is a debate in the administration between differing views on EXIM Bank. I would characterize that debate in its simplest form as between pragmatists and ideologues,"" Hall said."
General Electric,2017-4,"Conservative Republicans, including House Speaker Paul Ryan, have fought for years to revoke EXIM's charter, charging that it provides unnecessary ""corporate welfare"" to giant corporations such as Boeing Co , General Electric Co and Caterpillar Inc ."
General Electric,2017-4,"Its charter was allowed to expire in 2015, but was restored five months later after a bitter fight in Congress. But with only two of five board seats filled and Obama nominees blocked last year, its loans and guarantees are capped at $10 million, preventing it from financing large exports such as commercial aircraft and power turbines."
General Electric,2017-4,"Hall, an Obama administration appointee who was asked to stay on for six months as Trump took office in January, was unusually candid about the split for an executive agency chief."
General Electric,2017-4,"""Secretary Ross is one of the pragmatists"" who supports restoring EXIM's full powers, Hall said."
General Electric,2017-4,"""In terms of identifying the others, I would say it's more the Heritage Foundation point of view. And we know there are a lot of people from the Heritage Foundation who are salted around the Executive Office of the President, both in the White House and the Office of Management and Budget."""
General Electric,2017-4,"Dan Holler, a spokesman for the foundation's political arm, Heritage Action for America, said that EXIM too often helps foreign competitors, citing Mexico's state oil company Pemex, which benefited from $7 billion in EXIM financing for U.S. exports between 2007 and 2013."
General Electric,2017-4,"""Unless Secretary Ross can demonstrate the bank actually creates jobs in America, there is really no argument for moving forward,"" Holler said."
General Electric,2017-4,"Hall said the bank fits into Trump's trade ""sweet-spot"" to boost U.S. exports and compete more effectively with China."
General Electric,2017-4,"In 2015, China's three export credit agencies provided $576 billion in total financing and guarantees, while a curtailed EXIM did only $10.6 billion. Hall noted that in 2014 and 2015, the Chinese agencies provided more financing than EXIM has in its entire 83-year history."

General Electric,2017-4,"SEATTLE, April 5 (Reuters) - Boeing Co said on Wednesday it had launched a venture capital arm and invested in two tech startups, a fresh sign of the importance big companies see in keeping up with rapidly evolving technology for designing and making products."
General Electric,2017-4,"Boeing's new division, known as HorizonX, invested in Upskill, a Washington, D.C.-based software company that uses Google Glass-type eye wear to help assembly workers with complex tasks such as creating wiring bundles for Boeing jetliners."
General Electric,2017-4,"It also invested in Zunum Aero, a Seattle-area company that is working on electric-hybrid aircraft aimed at bringing down the cost of flying to regional airports. Zunum also received funding from JetBlue Technology Ventures, a unit of the New York-based JetBlue Airways Corp ."
General Electric,2017-4,"Boeing and JetBlue are not alone in taking stakes in promising technology companies. General Electric Co's venture arm invested in an earlier Upskill funding round, and Airbus has had a venture fund since 2014."
General Electric,2017-4,"Boeing is not aiming to profit from the ventures directly but instead to access technology used in autonomous vehicles, machine learning, additive manufacturing and wearable devices, said Steve Nordlund, a Boeing vice president who heads HorizonX."
General Electric,2017-4,"""These are all starting to converge and have the potential to fundamentally change how we operate inside and outside of companies,"" he said."
General Electric,2017-4,"Upskill's software platform for example, brings data typically stored in books into workers' tools. The system can be used in manufacturing, field service and shipping and warehouse logistics, and the company's revenue growth is in triple digits annually, Chief Executive Officer Brian Ballard told Reuters."
General Electric,2017-4,"""Imagine working on a car and not having to flip through the paper manual,"" Ballard said. Typical systems pay back in a few months. Upskill has been working with Boeing for two years and has moved beyond pilot tests into production."
General Electric,2017-4,"Boeing declined to specify investment amounts, ""but this initiative represents a multi-year commitment by Boeing to spend tens of millions of dollars a year to advance innovation and to supplement our research and development efforts,"" spokesman Chaz Bickers said."
General Electric,2017-4,"Nordlund was formerly vice president of strategy for Boeing's defense, space and security business and was involved in launching drone-maker Insitu Inc, which Boeing acquired in 2008. He also has worked in sales at IBM and was chief information officer at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University."
General Electric,2017-4,{{20170403T032200.217+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-Empire-building sets HNA on a risky trajectory(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.)
General Electric,2017-4,"HONG KONG, April 3 (Reuters Breakingviews) - HNA Group's empire-building puts it on a risky trajectory. The Chinese travel outfit has spent tens of billions of dollars abroad on everything from land and hotels to high finance. These are just opening gambits as HNA seeks to amass trillions of dollars in assets."
General Electric,2017-4,"There is some logic in expanding across transport, tourism and aviation. Diversifying out of airlines, a famously value-destructive industry, makes sense. So does reducing overall exposure to China's economy and currency; given question marks about both, it is rational for Chinese firms to borrow cheaply and buy foreign assets."
General Electric,2017-4,"But HNA's thesis that business lines that move people, things, and money around should naturally fit together doesn't seem convincing. Understanding Chinese travellers does not help when it comes to valuing a Western investment bank or a hedge-fund platform, nor are there obvious concrete benefits from shared ownership."
General Electric,2017-4,"In the end, this looks like old-school empire-building. While Western outfits like General Electric have tightened up considerably, giant conglomerates never went out of fashion in China. Bosses often want companies to be as big as possible, rather than maximising profit and efficiency."
General Electric,2017-4,"Does HNA have other, hidden motives for its buying spree? Probably not. Like any big Chinese outfit, HNA is not entirely separate from party or state. Chen attends high-powered Communist Party gatherings. State banks are big supporters. And HNA matters hugely to its local government in Hainan."
General Electric,2017-4,"But that does not mean HNA is doing Beijing's bidding. Unlike other areas where China is expanding, from movies to nuclear power, little of what HNA does looks strategically significant. Even the attempt to buy SkyBridge, the hedge-fund firm run by Donald Trump supporter Anthony Scaramucci, seems more naive than malign in retrospect, given the inevitable resulting controversy."
General Electric,2017-4,"The better question is whether HNA is heading for trouble, and what would happen if it blew up. There is no suggestion that HNA today is in anything other than fine financial health. A hands-off approach to acquisitions should in theory mean it gets the benefit of skilled local management."
General Electric,2017-4,"But history is littered with M&A machines that over-paid and over-reached: from ITT, the 1960s uber-conglomerate, to dotcom-darling WorldCom and drug industry consolidator Valeant. The wider an empire's territory, the harder it is to govern. The more debt deployed, the greater the financial risk."
General Electric,2017-4,"Beijing hates a mess. It seems doubtful the government would allow a collapse of a big Chinese company, at least if it could avoid it. Officials would do their best to avoid contagion, job losses and national embarrassment."
General Electric,2017-4,- Companies backed by China's HNA Group have spent tens of billions of dollars on overseas mergers and acquisitions in the last two years. The biggest deal was the $10.1 billion purchase of an aircraft-leasing business from CIT. Other major deals include the $6.5 billion purchase of 25 percent of Hilton Worldwide; the $6.3 billion takeover of U.S. computer wholesaler Ingram Micro; and the $2.8 billion acquisition of cargo-handling firm Swissport International.
General Electric,2017-4,"- In real estate, a unit of HNA agreed to buy 245 Park Avenue in Manhattan for $2.2 billion, Reuters reported on March 21, citing a source familiar with the transaction. It has also spent HK$27.2 billion ($3.5 billion) since November buying four plots of land in Hong Kong's Kai Tak area, where it plans to build a ""world-class integrated residential complex""."
General Electric,2017-4,"- In finance, HNA has amassed a 4.76 percent stake in Deutsche Bank in two stages since February. The stake was worth about $1.1 billion as of March 31's close, Eikon data shows. On March 26, it agreed to buy 24.95 percent of Old Mutual's U.S. subsidiary, Old Mutual Asset Management, in a two-part deal worth $446 million."
General Electric,2017-4,"- HNA is in talks to buy a controlling stake in the owner of the publisher of Forbes magazine, in a deal worth at least $400 million, Reuters reported on March 28, citing two sources with knowledge of the matter. Hong Kong-based Integrated Whale Media Investments, which holds 95 percent of Forbes Media, is also in talks with another Chinese entity, and is scouting for more potential buyers, Reuters added."
