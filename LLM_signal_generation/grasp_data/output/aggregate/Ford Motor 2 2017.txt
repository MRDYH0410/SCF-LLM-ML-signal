Ford Motor,2017-2,"{{20170301T100634.567+0000}}UK union fears for jobs at Ford's Welsh engine plant LONDON, March 1 (Reuters) - Britain's biggest trade union fears that more than 1,000 jobs could be lost at Ford's engine plant in Wales despite reassurances from the U.S. carmaker that similar levels of employment will be needed in the coming years."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"Ford, Britain's biggest engine builder, said last year it was scaling back investment due to lower than anticipated demand for one of its petrol engines, prompting the Unite union to call on the firm to provide a plan for how it would maintain output."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"""It is our belief that... there is no future business plan for the plant, that our concerns are going to be realised, that two thirds of the plant, that's at least 1,160 jobs will be at risk,"" Andy Richards, Unite's Welsh Secretary told the BBC."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"A spokesman at Ford told Reuters that the firm, which made around one third of Britain's total output of 2.4 million engines at Bridgend in 2015, was not planning significant cuts."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"""The anticipated production volume of engines from Bridgend remains healthy in the upcoming years, with associated labour requirements expected to be similar to today's level,"" he said."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"A meeting is due to take place on Wednesday between Ford and the unions, Richards told the BBC."

Ford Motor,2017-2,"NEW YORK, Feb 28 (Reuters) - Late this afternoon, the automakers Honda, Ford, Toyota, Nissan, Mazda and BMW will head to federal court in Miami to argue that a $1 billion plea agreement between the U.S. Justice Department and the airbag maker Takata Corporation should absolve them from liability for installing dangerous Takata airbags in tens of millions of cars sold in the U.S."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"As my colleague Joe White has reported, Takata has agreed to set up an $850 million fund to compensate automakers for the cost of replacing recalled airbags. [nL2N1GC1E1]"
Ford Motor,2017-2,"Owners of the cars, who are suing the automakers for economic damages in consolidated litigation, have a rather different view of the implications of Takata's guilty plea, which was approved Monday by U.S. District Judge George Steeh of Detroit. Their lawyers, led by Peter Prieto of Podhurst Orseck, claim to have plenty of evidence that carmakers were independently aware of problems with Takata's airbags."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"Takata's guilty plea, car owners argued in a status report filed Monday with U.S. District Judge Federico Moreno of Miami, proves nothing at all about what the carmakers themselves knew about flaws in the airbags, which were installed even after car owners began reporting dangerous ruptures."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"""Despite this knowledge, the automotive defendants continued to equip their vehicles with Takata's ticking time bombs and misrepresent to the unsuspecting public that their vehicles were safe,"" car owners said in the status report."
Ford Motor,2017-2,Car owners also claimed in their latest consolidated complaint that they deserve punitive damages from automakers.
Ford Motor,2017-2,The automakers said in their status report to Miami judge Morena that Takata's admissions in its agreement with the Justice Department undermine car owners' claims for economic losses.
Ford Motor,2017-2,"""The plea agreement confirms, among other things, that Takata engaged in a fraudulent scheme to keep the automotive defendants from knowing what Takata knew about the inflators and their potential to rupture,"" the carmakers said in a status report filed last week."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"""Even before Takata's admission of guilt, plaintiffs had no way to prove they suffered actual economic loss, as the automotive defendants are offering, and will continue to offer, free replacements of recalled Takata inflators. In short, Takata's guilty plea makes the theory of plaintiffs' case even more implausible than it already was."""
Ford Motor,2017-2,"Plaintiffs' lawyers said in their retort Monday that Honda and the other carmakers had overstated the impact of the Takata plea deal, which, ""neither excuses the automotive defendants' own reckless, deceptive conduct nor undermines the economic loss claims asserted against them."""
Ford Motor,2017-2,"The filing accused carmakers of opting to use Takata airbags to save time and money. In a response issued late Monday, Honda called the allegation that cost considerations led it to use a dangerous product ""categorically false,"" adding that Takata's airbag components were not even consistently priced lower than those of competitors. (Honda also reiterated that Takata's guilty plea belies car owners' economic loss claims.)"
Ford Motor,2017-2,"Takata and its U.S. subsidiary, TK Holdings, meanwhile, argued in their status report to Judge Moreno that the parent corporation's admissions in its plea deal with the government should have ""limited (if any) impact"" on car owners' economic loss claims in the consolidated civil litigation."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"As part of the plea deal, Takata agreed to establish a $125 million restitution fund for plaintiffs who were injured by defective airbags. Those claims are consolidated on a separate tracks from the economic loss claims."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"Plaintiffs' lawyers in the civil litigation had theorized in a pair of filings Monday before the Detroit judge overseeing the Takata criminal case that the parent corporation would try to use the plea agreement to shield its U.S. subsidiary from liability for car owners' economic losses. Instead, Takata and its subsidiary urged Judge Moreno to dismiss economic loss claims against both of them."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"At the moment, both sides' jockeying over the impact of the plea agreement is just posturing. All of the defendants have moved to dismiss the latest complaint by car owners. Those motions, which preceded the Takata plea deal, are pending before Judge Moreno. It's not clear, in other words, whether the judge will even consider Takata's admissions in deciding whether to keep the economic loss cases alive."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"If plaintiffs survive dismissal motions, the automaker defendants may well ask the judge to grant them summary judgment based on Takata's guilty plea. Lead counsel Prieto seems to be already primed to respond."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"""What the automakers knew and when they knew it is an issue of fact,"" he told me. ""It's for the jury to decide."""
Ford Motor,2017-2,"WASHINGTON, Feb 28 (Reuters) - German automakers dominated Consumer Reports' annual ranking of automotive brands released on Tuesday, with Volkswagen AG's Audi leading the pack, while U.S. brands continued to lag despite gains for many."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"Jake Fisher, director of auto testing at the magazine, said German automakers rose largely due to improvements in reliability. ""Building one or two great vehicles is achievable, but making a whole lineup of excellent ones is much more difficult,"" Fisher said."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"Volkswagen's Porsche unit and rival BMW AG came in second and third. General Motors Co's Buick brand was the highest-ranked U.S. brand in 10th, down from seventh in 2016, while Ford Motor Co's Lincoln brand was 15th, up from 17th. The Ford brand fell from 16th to 21th."
Ford Motor,2017-2,GM's Chevrolet brand moved up to 17th from 20th and its Cadillac brand moved up to 18th from 24th.
Ford Motor,2017-2,"Toyota Motor Corp's <7203.T> flagship brand fell from eighth to 11th place, falling out of the top 10 for the first time in recent years, after the magazine said its Tacoma pickup had reliability issues. Toyota's luxury Lexus unit fell from third to fourth."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"Fuji Heavy Industries' <7270.T> Subaru unit fell from second to fifth, while Korean auto brand Kia jumped to sixth, up five spots, followed by Mazda Motor Corp <7261.T> in seventh."
Ford Motor,2017-2,Tesla Inc was ranked eighth among auto brands after previously not having enough models to be ranked. The California automaker was followed by Honda Motor Co's <7267.T> namesake brand in ninth.
Ford Motor,2017-2,"GM's Chevrolet Cruze was named best compact car, while its Impala won best large sedan."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"Other top picks included the Honda Ridgeline as best compact pickup, Kia Optima best midsized sedan and Audi Q7 best luxury SUV."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"Nissan Motor Co's <7201.T> luxury Infiniti brand moved up six spots to 16, while its Nissan brand fell one spot to 22."
Ford Motor,2017-2,Some German automakers struggled. The Volkswagen brand fell eight spots to 23rd and Daimler's Mercedes-Benz fell six spots to 20th.
Ford Motor,2017-2,"The Fiat brand remained last again among all brands rated, and FCA's Jeep brand remained second-lowest overall. Consumer Reports does not recommend any Fiat Chrysler vehicles, while it recommends all Porsche, Mazda and BMW vehicles."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"Fisher said Fiat Chrysler models suffered from serious reliability problems and are ""not competitive"" in most segments. The non-profit magazine has more than 8 million subscribers and surveys hundreds of thousands of car owners. Many shoppers consult the ratings, and automakers routinely tout favorable ratings in advertising."

Ford Motor,2017-2,"WASHINGTON, Feb 21 (Reuters) - A trade association representing General Motors Co , Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T>, Volkswagen AG and nine other automakers on Tuesday asked new Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt to withdraw an Obama administration decision to lock in vehicle emission rules through 2025."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"On Jan. 13, then-EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy finalized a determination that landmark fuel efficiency rules instituted by President Barack Obama should be finalized through 2025, a bid to maintain a key part of his administration's climate legacy."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"Mitch Bainwol, president and chief executive of the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, said in a letter to Pruitt the decision was ""the product of egregious procedural and substantive defects"" and is ""riddled with indefensible assumptions, inadequate analysis and a failure to engage with contrary evidence."""
Ford Motor,2017-2,Automakers have argued that the rules could result in the loss of up to 1 million jobs because consumers could be less willing to buy the more fuel efficient vehicles since their engineering will result in higher price tags.
Ford Motor,2017-2,"The EPA had until April 2018 to decide whether the 2025 standards were feasible but in November moved up its decision to Jan. 13, just before Obama left office."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"Separately, the Association of Global Automakers, a trade group representing Honda Motor Co <7267.T>, Nissan Motor Co Ltd <7201.T>, Hyundai Motor Co <005380.KS> and others, said late Tuesday it had formally petitioned the EPA to withdraw the determination. The group argued in a separate letter to Pruitt Tuesday reviewed by Reuters that ""EPA opted for political expediency"" and ""jammed through a final determination in the waning days of the lame-duck administration."""
Ford Motor,2017-2,EPA spokeswoman Julia Valentine said the agency is reviewing the letter and declined to comment further. Pruitt told a Senate panel earlier he will review the Obama administration's decision.
Ford Motor,2017-2,"The auto group requests follow a separate letter to President Donald Trump earlier this month from the chief executives of GM, Ford Motor Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV, along with the top North American executives at Toyota, VW, Honda, Hyundai, Nissan and others urging Trump to revisit the decision."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"Automakers say the rules impose significant costs and are out of step with consumer preferences. Environmentalists say the rules are working, saving drivers thousands in fuel costs and should not be changed."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"In 2011, Obama announced an agreement with automakers to raise fuel efficiency standards to 54.5 miles per gallon. This, the administration said, would save motorists $1.7 trillion in fuel costs over the life of the vehicles but cost the auto industry about $200 billion over 13 years."

Ford Motor,2017-2,"MOSCOW/FRANKFURT, Feb 21 (Reuters) - German automaker Daimler will open a plant near Moscow to make Mercedes-Benz cars, it announced on Tuesday, the first new investment by a major Western automaker since sanctions were imposed on Russia three years ago."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"The plant will be Daimler's first to produce passenger vehicles in Russia. The firm said it would invest more than 250 million euros ($260 million) in the facility, and the first cars will leave the assembly line in 2019. [nR4N1G1016]"
Ford Motor,2017-2,"Daimler's investment follows the emergence of tentative signs of a recovery in the Russian car market, with Ford the first major foreign carmaker to see sales in Russia grow following three lean years. [ID:nL8N1G53HB]"
Ford Motor,2017-2,"Russia's Trade and Industry Ministry said in a statement that the Daimler plant will produce more than 20,000 Mercedes-Benz passenger cars and SUVS per year under an agreement that will run for nine years."
Ford Motor,2017-2,Russia had long been seen by major global automakers as a growth prospect that was once tipped to overtake Germany as Europe's biggest auto market.
Ford Motor,2017-2,"However, new projects were put on hold in 2014, when the conflict in Ukraine and resulting international sanctions coincided with a sharp slump in the Russian economy."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"Sanctions did not forbid investments in the auto sector, but caused a general chill in investor sentiment, and also threw up practical complications because financial transactions had to be restructured to avoid banks subject to sanctions."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"General Motors pulled out of Russia two years ago. Auto sales overall have more than halved from a 2012 peak of almost 3 million a year. Mercedes last year sold 36,888 passenger vehicles, a drop of 11 percent year on year, according to the Association of European Business (AEB), a lobby group which tracks sales."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"However, a slide in the value of Russia's rouble currency has also reduced automakers' local production costs, and in the past few months some producers have seen the decline in their sales slow as consumers start visiting showrooms again."

Ford Motor,2017-2,"MOSCOW, Feb 19 (Reuters) - Ford has become the first major foreign carmaker in Russia to see sales grow after three bad years, potentially vindicating its decision to double down on a notoriously volatile market when rivals decided to cut and run."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"Sales of cars in Russia have fallen by more than half since a 2012 peak of 2.9 million vehicles, due to an economic crisis brought on by low oil prices and Western sanctions. The market fell by 11 percent last year, and was down a further 5 percent in January from a year earlier."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"Ford's big U.S. rival General Motors pulled out of Russia two years ago. But Ford chose not only to stay, but to keep investing, launching new models with modifications designed to suit the country's harsh driving conditions."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"Since 2011, its joint venture with Sollers , a Russian partner, has ploughed $1.5 billion into making cars locally to local specifications."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"Now Ford's sales have turned a corner and rose 10 percent last year, an achievement the company says is proof its strategy is at last paying off."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"The 40,000 Fords sold in Russia last year are still barely more than a fifth of the almost 190,000 vehicles the company sold in 2008, before the global financial crisis brought the first of two collapses in the Russian car industry in less than a decade."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"During the latest crisis, Ford's share of the market for foreign cars fell at the expense of Korean competitors Kia <000270.KS> and Hyundai <005380.KS>, which chose to shore up market share through aggressive pricing. But now their sales are still falling, while Ford's are on the rise."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"The Russian market is ""starting to turn"", Ford CEO Mark Fields told Reuters last week, promising to stand by the company's investments in Russia. ""Our intent is to build on that."""
Ford Motor,2017-2,The Association of European Businesses lobby group forecasts the Russian car market to finally stabilise this year and grow by 4 percent. But it will still be years before a full rebound.
Ford Motor,2017-2,"""Despite the economic turbulence, we didn't cut investments and delivered the initial plan to launch seven new vehicles with a significant level of localisation,"" Mark Ovenden, CEO of the Ford Sollers joint venture, told Reuters."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"He noted that the company opened a $275 million engine plant in 2015, a year in which Ford's Russia sales nosedived 41 percent. The joint venture now operates four plants in Russia."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"New models, such as the Fiesta hatchback and EcoSport SUV, have been adapted for Russian conditions of bad roads and extreme cold, with higher ground clearance, anti-corrosion finishes and engines adapted for lower grade fuel, Ovenden said."

Ford Motor,2017-2,"MOSCOW, Feb 19 (Reuters) - Ford has become the first major foreign carmaker in Russia to see sales grow after three bad years, potentially vindicating its decision to double down on a notoriously volatile market when rivals decided to cut and run."

Ford Motor,2017-2,"DETROIT, Feb 17 (Reuters) - General Motors Co plans to deploy thousands of self-driving electric cars in test fleets in partnership with ride-sharing affiliate Lyft Inc, beginning in 2018, two sources familiar with the automaker's plans said this week."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"It is expected to be the largest such test of fully autonomous vehicles by any major automaker before 2020, when several companies have said they plan to begin building and deploying such vehicles in higher volumes. Alphabet Inc's Waymo subsidiary, in comparison, is currently testing about 60 self-driving prototypes in four states."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"Most of the specially equipped versions of the Chevrolet Bolt electric vehicle will be used by San Francisco-based Lyft, which will test them in its ride-sharing fleet in several states, one of the sources said. GM has no immediate plans to sell the Bolt AV to individual customers, according to the source."
Ford Motor,2017-2,The sources spoke only on condition of anonymity because GM has not announced its plans yet.
Ford Motor,2017-2,"GM executives have said in interviews and investor presentations during the past year they intend to mass-produce autonomous vehicles and deploy them in ride services fleets. However, GM officials have not revealed details of the scale of production, or the timing of the deployment of those vehicles."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"In a statement on Friday, GM said: ""We do not provide specific details on potential future products or technology rollout plans. We have said that our AV technology will appear in an on-demand ride sharing network application sooner than you might think."""
Ford Motor,2017-2,"GM's crosstown rival Ford Motor Co has said it plans to begin building its first self-driving vehicles at a suburban Detroit plant in late 2020, for deployment in on-demand ride sharing fleets in 2021. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles is providing a small number of Chrysler Pacifica minivans to Waymo, which is converting them for self-driving tests."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"GM's Maven car sharing operation likely will be involved with Lyft in developing a commercial ride sharing business around self-driving vehicles such as the Bolt AV, GM executive Mike Ableson told Reuters in a November interview."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"""If you assume the cost of these autonomous vehicles, the very early ones, will be six figures, there aren't very many retail customers that are willing to go out and spend that kind of money,"" Ableson said. ""But even at that sort of cost, with a ride sharing platform, you can build a business."""
Ford Motor,2017-2,Chief Executive Mary Barra in mid-December said GM would begin building a fully autonomous version of the Bolt EV in early 2017 at its Orion Township plant north of Detroit.
Ford Motor,2017-2,"GM is testing about 40 Bolt AVs in San Francisco and Scottsdale, Arizona, and plans to extend testing this year to Detroit, the automaker said in December. [nL1N1E81IU]"
Ford Motor,2017-2,"A year ago, GM paid $500 million for a minority stake in Lyft, the second-largest U.S. ride sharing firm after Uber. [nL3N14O3VA]"

Ford Motor,2017-2,"GM in early 2016 acquired Cruise Automation, a San Francisco startup, to help it accelerate development of self-driving cars. [nL1N16J0ZN] GM also launched a car sharing business, Maven, which has provided vehicles to Lyft."

Ford Motor,2017-2,"BEIJING, Feb 15 (Reuters) - ""Reciprocity"" has become the new buzzword in the U.S. business community in China, with some industry leaders saying they would welcome a tougher approach from the Trump administration in opening up the markets of the world's second-largest economy."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"It's a striking shift within the American community here, which had long lobbied Washington against taking more aggressive policies, fearing they could draw retribution from China's leaders."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"President Donald Trump's picks for Commerce Secretary and Trade Representative, Wilbur Ross and Robert Lighthizer, have in the past backed the reciprocity principle when it comes to China: that Beijing should provide the same access and benefits to American business in China that Washington gives the Chinese in the United States."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"""Our membership has moved to some extent in that direction as well, in advocating a firmer posture with respect to China,"" said Lester Ross, chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China's policy committee."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"He made the remarks in January after the group issued a report that found over 60 percent of the chamber's members had ""little or no confidence that the Chinese government is committed to opening markets further in the next three years"". [nL4N1F82ZV]"
Ford Motor,2017-2,Many sectors of China's economy are either off limits or severely restricted to foreign investors.
Ford Motor,2017-2,"Foreign banks in China, for example, account for less than 2 percent of total assets, according to the China Banking Regulatory Commission."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"A 50-percent ownership cap for foreign life insurers, despite China's 2001 World Trade Organization commitments to lift it, has helped limit their market share to about 6 percent."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"China's Anbang Insurance Group , on the other hand, has spent more than $8 billion acquiring U.S. assets, including the Waldorf Astoria Hotel and Strategic Hotels & Resorts. It is still waiting for regulatory approval to buy U.S. life insurer Fidelity & Guaranty Life for $1.6 billion. [nL4N1DM1FU] [nL1N1FS247]"
Ford Motor,2017-2,"The same imbalances can be seen in sectors such as automotives, payment cards and technology."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"China's Geely Holding Group [GEELY.UL] bought Volvo from Ford Motor Co. in 2010, but foreign companies are required to set up joint ventures to assemble vehicles in China, often transferring technology in the process."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"While China's UnionPay has grown to become the world's largest payment card, according to the number of cards issued, U.S. credit card operators Visa and MasterCard have yet to be independently licensed to clear transactions in China, despite a 2012 WTO ruling mandating that Beijing open the sector."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"Foreign technology hardware and service providers are bristling at requirements to meet the restrictive terms of newly minted cyber security regulations. Beijing's ""Made in China 2025"" plan also calls for a progressive increase in domestic parts used in priority sectors, such as advanced information technology and robotics to 70 percent by 2025."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"James McGregor, Chairman of APCO Worldwide, Greater China, said the idea of some form of reciprocity is gaining traction, particularly in combating ""techno-nationalism""."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"""You've got Chinese companies that have protected markets and make loads of money and then they are going out and doing international acquisitions that could destroy other companies,"" McGregor said. ""Now China has overreached so much they have alienated much of the business community."""
Ford Motor,2017-2,"McGregor said U.S. policy makers had to figure out how to use America's openness and rule of law to deal with China, instead of allowing them to become vulnerabilities."
Ford Motor,2017-2,The question is how to craft a reciprocity policy without destabilising bilateral relations or triggering a retaliatory backlash against U.S. businesses in China.
Ford Motor,2017-2,Chinese state media has warned that U.S. businesses could be targets in any trade war that Trump may unleash - he has threatened to label China a currency manipulator and slap heavy tariffs on Chinese goods.
Ford Motor,2017-2,China's Ministry of Commerce did not respond to a request for comment on the issue of reciprocity.
Ford Motor,2017-2,"But Tu Xinquan, a trade expert at Beijing's University of International Business and Economics, said Trump's options would be limited by his promises to create jobs."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"""If you close the door to Chinese investments, that's not good for American employment,"" Tu said."
Ford Motor,2017-2,One way to achieve reciprocity would be to use the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) security review process to wall off industries where U.S. businesses face discrimination in China. But most experts see that as straying too far from the free market orthodoxy that has drawn investment and jobs to the United States for decades.
Ford Motor,2017-2,"James Zimmerman, a Beijing-based lawyer with Sheppard Mullin and a former chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, said strict reciprocity would be bad policy and against the U.S. system of open investment."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"""We need to be very careful what we ask for,"" Zimmerman said."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"Proponents argue reciprocity does not violate free market principles, but is a needed intervention due to a market failure, much as the government uses antitrust policy to crack down on cartels."

Ford Motor,2017-2,"Most of the specially equipped versions of the Chevrolet Bolt electric vehicle will be used by San Francisco-based Lyft, which will test them in its ride-sharing fleet in several states, one of the sources said. GM has no immediate plans to sell the Bolt AV to individual customers, according to the source."
Ford Motor,2017-2,The sources spoke only on condition of anonymity because GM has not announced its plans yet.
Ford Motor,2017-2,"GM executives have said in interviews and investor presentations during the past year they intend to mass-produce autonomous vehicles and deploy them in ride services fleets. However, GM officials have not revealed details of the scale of production, or the timing of the deployment of those vehicles."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"In a statement on Friday, GM said: ""We do not provide specific details on potential future products or technology rollout plans. We have said that our AV technology will appear in an on-demand ride sharing network application sooner than you might think."""
Ford Motor,2017-2,"GM's crosstown rival Ford Motor Co has said it plans to begin building its first self-driving vehicles at a suburban Detroit plant in late 2020, for deployment in on-demand ride sharing fleets in 2021. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles is providing a small number of Chrysler Pacifica minivans to Waymo, which is converting them for self-driving tests."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"GM's Maven car sharing operation likely will be involved with Lyft in developing a commercial ride sharing business around self-driving vehicles such as the Bolt AV, GM executive Mike Ableson told Reuters in a November interview."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"""If you assume the cost of these autonomous vehicles, the very early ones, will be six figures, there aren't very many retail customers that are willing to go out and spend that kind of money,"" Ableson said. ""But even at that sort of cost, with a ride sharing platform, you can build a business."""
Ford Motor,2017-2,Chief Executive Mary Barra in mid-December said GM would begin building a fully autonomous version of the Bolt EV in early 2017 at its Orion Township plant north of Detroit.
Ford Motor,2017-2,"GM is testing about 40 Bolt AVs in San Francisco and Scottsdale, Arizona, and plans to extend testing this year to Detroit, the automaker said in December. [nL1N1E81IU]"
Ford Motor,2017-2,"A year ago, GM paid $500 million for a minority stake in Lyft, the second-largest U.S. ride sharing firm after Uber. [nL3N14O3VA]"
Ford Motor,2017-2,"Before it closed the deal, Ableson said he and GM President Dan Ammann discussed with Lyft founders Logan Green and John Zimmer the prospect of jointly developing a ride sharing business with self-driving cars."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"""We walked in not wanting so much to talk about the business today, but how do we work together to develop this idea of autonomous, on-demand networks in cities,"" Ableson said of the initial discussions with Lyft."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"To make that business successful, Ableson said, requires the ability to engineer autonomous systems, to build self-driving vehicles in volume and to deploy them in a ride sharing fleet."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"""If you take those three things, no one company has all three,"" Ableson said."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"GM in early 2016 acquired Cruise Automation, a San Francisco startup, to help it accelerate development of self-driving cars. [nL1N16J0ZN] GM also launched a car sharing business, Maven, which has provided vehicles to Lyft."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"""Cruise, Lyft, Maven are all bringing different parts of this singular solution around autonomous on-demand networks in urban environments,"" Ableson said."

Ford Motor,2017-2,"NEW YORK, Feb 16 (Reuters) - More Americans fell behind on their car loan payments in the fourth quarter, bringing auto delinquencies to their highest since the height of the financial crisis, Federal Reserve Bank of New York data released on Thursday showed."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"Car loans delinquent by 30 days or more grew to $23.27 billion, the most since $23.46 billion in the third quarter of 2008. They were up from $22.98 billion in the prior quarter."

Ford Motor,2017-2,"Last month, Ford Motor Co's finance arm said it expected a pickup in loan losses from historically low levels following a rise in delinquencies and car possessions."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"""Credit losses have been at historically low levels for quite some time, and we continue to see credit losses increase toward more normal levels,"" Ford Credit said in a presentation of its fourth-quarter results and 2017 outlook."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"The increase in late loan payments coincided with drivers loading up on debt to buy the latest car, trunk and SUV models, fueling expectations for record auto sales in 2017. [nL1N1FH0SC]"
Ford Motor,2017-2,"In the fourth quarter, $142 billion in car loans were generated, giving 2016 the most auto loan originations in the 18-year history of the data, the New York Fed said."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"Auto debt hit $1.16 trillion, with a $93 billion rise over the year."

Ford Motor,2017-2,"Total debt was up $460 billion from a year ago and was just 0.8 percent below an all-time peak of $12.68 trillion in the third quarter of 2008, before the worst of the financial crisis and deep recession, the data showed."
Ford Motor,2017-2,Some 4.8 percent of all debt was in some stage of delinquency.

Ford Motor,2017-2,"Conversely, Volkswagen (VW) group, nearly a year and a half after its emissions scandal came to light, racked up 10 percent growth last month, as did Renault, according to Brussels-based ACEA."

Ford Motor,2017-2,"BEIJING, Feb 15 (Reuters) - ""Reciprocity"" has become the new buzzword in the U.S. business community in China, with some industry leaders saying they would welcome a tougher approach from the Trump administration in opening up the markets of the world's second-largest economy."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"It's a striking shift within the American community here, which had long lobbied Washington against taking more aggressive policies, fearing they could draw retribution from China's leaders."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"President Donald Trump's picks for Commerce Secretary and Trade Representative, Wilbur Ross and Robert Lighthizer, have in the past backed the reciprocity principle when it comes to China: that Beijing should provide the same access and benefits to American business in China that Washington gives the Chinese in the United States."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"""Our membership has moved to some extent in that direction as well, in advocating a firmer posture with respect to China,"" said Lester Ross, chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China's policy committee."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"He made the remarks in January after the group issued a report that found over 60 percent of the chamber's members had ""little or no confidence that the Chinese government is committed to opening markets further in the next three years"". [nL4N1F82ZV]"
Ford Motor,2017-2,Many sectors of China's economy are either off limits or severely restricted to foreign investors.
Ford Motor,2017-2,"Foreign banks in China, for example, account for less than 2 percent of total assets, according to the China Banking Regulatory Commission."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"A 50-percent ownership cap for foreign life insurers, despite China's 2001 World Trade Organization commitments to lift it, has helped limit their market share to about 6 percent."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"China's Anbang Insurance Group , on the other hand, has spent more than $8 billion acquiring U.S. assets, including the Waldorf Astoria Hotel and Strategic Hotels & Resorts. It is still waiting for regulatory approval to buy U.S. life insurer Fidelity & Guaranty Life for $1.6 billion. [nL4N1DM1FU] [nL1N1FS247]"
Ford Motor,2017-2,"The same imbalances can be seen in sectors such as automotives, payment cards and technology."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"China's Geely Holding Group [GEELY.UL] bought Volvo from Ford Motor Co. in 2010, but foreign companies are required to set up joint ventures to assemble vehicles in China, often transferring technology in the process."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"While China's UnionPay has grown to become the world's largest payment card, according to the number of cards issued, U.S. credit card operators Visa and MasterCard have yet to be independently licensed to clear transactions in China, despite a 2012 WTO ruling mandating that Beijing open the sector."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"Foreign technology hardware and service providers are bristling at requirements to meet the restrictive terms of newly minted cyber security regulations. Beijing's ""Made in China 2025"" plan also calls for a progressive increase in domestic parts used in priority sectors, such as advanced information technology and robotics to 70 percent by 2025."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"James McGregor, Chairman of APCO Worldwide, Greater China, said the idea of some form of reciprocity is gaining traction, particularly in combating ""techno-nationalism""."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"""You've got Chinese companies that have protected markets and make loads of money and then they are going out and doing international acquisitions that could destroy other companies,"" McGregor said. ""Now China has overreached so much they have alienated much of the business community."""
Ford Motor,2017-2,"McGregor said U.S. policy makers had to figure out how to use America's openness and rule of law to deal with China, instead of allowing them to become vulnerabilities."
Ford Motor,2017-2,The question is how to craft a reciprocity policy without destabilising bilateral relations or triggering a retaliatory backlash against U.S. businesses in China.
Ford Motor,2017-2,Chinese state media has warned that U.S. businesses could be targets in any trade war that Trump may unleash - he has threatened to label China a currency manipulator and slap heavy tariffs on Chinese goods.
Ford Motor,2017-2,China's Ministry of Commerce did not respond to a request for comment on the issue of reciprocity.
Ford Motor,2017-2,"But Tu Xinquan, a trade expert at Beijing's University of International Business and Economics, said Trump's options would be limited by his promises to create jobs."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"""If you close the door to Chinese investments, that's not good for American employment,"" Tu said."
Ford Motor,2017-2,One way to achieve reciprocity would be to use the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) security review process to wall off industries where U.S. businesses face discrimination in China. But most experts see that as straying too far from the free market orthodoxy that has drawn investment and jobs to the United States for decades.
Ford Motor,2017-2,"James Zimmerman, a Beijing-based lawyer with Sheppard Mullin and a former chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, said strict reciprocity would be bad policy and against the U.S. system of open investment."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"""We need to be very careful what we ask for,"" Zimmerman said."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"Proponents argue reciprocity does not violate free market principles, but is a needed intervention due to a market failure, much as the government uses antitrust policy to crack down on cartels."

Ford Motor,2017-2,"Managing such clashing cultures is likely to be Ford's greatest challenge, and one that can't be put on autopilot."
Ford Motor,2017-2,- Ford on Feb. 10 said it had agreed to invest $1 billion over the next five years in a new artificial-intelligence startup called Argo AI to boost its development of autonomous vehicles.

Ford Motor,2017-2,{{20170213T145524.095+0000}}Auto CEOs want Trump to order review of 2025 fuel rulesBy David Shepardson
Ford Motor,2017-2,"WASHINGTON, Feb 12 (Reuters) - The chief executives of 18 major automakers and their U.S. units urged President Donald Trump to revisit a decision by the Obama administration to lock in vehicle fuel efficiency rules through 2025."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"In a letter sent late Friday and viewed by Reuters, the chief executives of General Motors Co , Ford Motor Co, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV, along with the top North American executives at Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T>, Volkswagen AG , Honda Motor Co <7267.T>, Hyundai Motor Co <005380.KS>, Nissan Motor Co <7201.T> and others urged Trump to reverse the decision, warning thousands of jobs could be at risk."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"On Jan. 13, the head of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency finalized a determination that the landmark fuel efficiency rules instituted by then President Barack Obama should be locked in through 2025, a bid to maintain a key part of his administration's climate legacy."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"As part of a 2012 regulation, EPA had to decide by April 2018 whether to modify the 2022-2025 model year vehicle emission rules requiring average fleet-wide efficiency of more than 50 miles per gallon through a ""midterm review."" The agency in November moved up the timetable for proposing automakers could meet the 2025 standards."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"The auto CEO letter asked Trump to reopen the midterm review ""without prejudging the outcome"" and praised Trump's ""personal focus on steps to strengthen the economy in the United States and your commitment to jobs in our sector."""
Ford Motor,2017-2,"Days after Trump was elected, automakers quickly appealed to Trump to review the rules, saying they impose significant costs and are out of step with consumer preferences."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"Gloria Bergquist, a spokeswoman for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, said Sunday, automakers are ""seeking a restoration of the process -- that's all. This is a reset."""
Ford Motor,2017-2,"The chief executives of Ford, GM and Fiat Chrysler also raised the issue in a White House meeting with Trump last month."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"The letter warned the rules could ""threaten future production levels, putting hundreds of thousands and perhaps as many as a million jobs at risk."""
Ford Motor,2017-2,"Environmentalists say the rules are working, saving drivers thousands in fuel costs and shouldn't be changed. Luke Tonachel of the Natural Resources Defense Council, said lowering the standards would ""cost consumers more, increase our dependence on oil and put Americans at greater risk from a changing climate."""
Ford Motor,2017-2,Trump EPA nominee Scott Pruitt told a Senate panel he will review the Obama administration's decision.
Ford Motor,2017-2,"In 2011, Obama announced an agreement with automakers to raise fuel efficiency standards to 54.5 miles per gallon. This, the administration said, would save motorists $1.7 trillion in fuel costs over the life of the vehicles, but cost the auto industry about $200 billion over 13 years."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"The EPA said in July that because Americans were buying fewer cars and more SUVs and trucks, it estimated the fleet will average 50.8 mpg to 52.6 mpg in 2025."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"{{20170210T000520.080+0000}}ANALYSIS-Japan's love of tiny cars sore spot as Trump, Abe meetBy Naomi Tajitsu, Norihiko Shirouzu and Bernie Woodall"
Ford Motor,2017-2,"TOKYO/DETROIT, Feb 9 (Reuters) - When Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe meets on Friday with U.S. President Donald Trump, Japan's bulging automotive trade surplus will be a sore spot, but the path to balancing auto exports and imports will be no easier than it was in the 1980s."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"Trump may press Abe to do more to level the trade imbalance with Japan during a White House visit or a round of golf, [nL4N1FT2IA] [nL4N1FT2MC]. But the two leaders are unlikely to change the fact that the big cars and trucks that America makes do not sell in Japan."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"Many Japanese consumers, faced with congested cities, favor tiny domestically-made vehicles, called kei cars, which make up more than a third of the market. Priced from around 1.1 million yen, or about $9,800, these cars have engines most Americans would consider inadequate for a motorcycle."
Ford Motor,2017-2,Even Japan's Toyota Motor Corp <7201.T> and Honda Motor Co <7267.T> cannot convince Japanese consumers to buy models that are popular in the United States. Small sport utility vehicles such as the Toyota RAV4 and Honda's CR-V are seen by Japanese consumers as too big.
Ford Motor,2017-2,"Only about 13,000 vehicles from U.S. automakers sold in Japan in both 2016 and 2015, and of that about three-fourths were Jeep SUVs made by Fiat Chrysler Automobiles . Ford Motor Co announced last month that it is pulling out of the Japanese market entirely, after selling just 2,400 vehicles there in 2016. [nL3N15931P]"
Ford Motor,2017-2,"The Japanese auto market has shrunk not only in terms of vehicle size, but in sales volume. As a result, global automakers, including Japan's, are focused on boosting sales in China, the United States and growing emerging markets."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"""It would take a painstaking fine-tuning of vehicle specs to suit American cars to those driving and other conditions and develop a strong distribution network to be able to gain traction in Japan. It is nothing short of a 20-year effort,"" said a Toyota executive who spoke on condition he not be named."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"Jaguar Land Rover Japan Ltd Chief Executive Magnus Hansson said the low sales of U.S. cars in Japan did not mean it was a closed market, but rather reflected ""a total and absolute lack of effort over 50 years"" by Detroit."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"Still, Japan remains an export hub for the big Japanese automakers. The U.S. Commerce Department this week reported that the U.S. trade deficit with Japan in 2016 was $68.9 billion, and of that total surplus, some $52.6 billion was in vehicles and automotive parts."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"Japan's automakers have more than 90 percent of the Japanese market. Last year U.S. automakers controlled only 45 percent of their home market, the world's second-biggest after China."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"A bigger factor than imports in the Detroit automakers' loss of U.S. market share since 1980 is the surge in investment by Japan's automakers in U.S. factories. Last year, 56 percent of the vehicles Toyota sold in the United States were made in America, the company said. Toyota said it employs more than 34,000 in the United States."
Ford Motor,2017-2,For years the growth of Japanese-owned auto factories in the U.S. heartland has helped cool trade tensions.
Ford Motor,2017-2,"But Trump, a Republican, has turned up the heat by complaining about the trade surplus and accusing Japan of manipulating the value of the yen to disadvantage American-made goods."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"On Thursday, a bipartisan group of senators from auto manufacturing states called on the new president ""to address currency manipulation and auto-related non-tariff barriers."""
Ford Motor,2017-2,They are not alone in urging changes to help bolster U.S. business.
Ford Motor,2017-2,"""(Trump) must bring Abe up short on any cheery notion that business will continue as usual,"" said Kevin L. Kearns, head of the U.S. Business and Industry Council."

Ford Motor,2017-2,"China's central government raised the purchase tax on cars with engines of 1.6 litres or less to 7.5 percent this year from a special rate of 5 percent last year, a policy originally instituted to shore up sales in a weakening economy.

Ford Motor,2017-2,"PARIS/MILAN, Feb 7 (Reuters) - Fiat Chrysler vehicles were allowed to skip key tests for illegal engine software during Italy's main emissions-cheating investigation in the wake of the Volkswagen scandal, according to the transport ministry's own report."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"The report, presented to a European parliamentary committee in October but never officially published, will be seized upon by environmental groups pressing MEPs to vote on Thursday for tougher EU oversight of vehicle testing by national authorities."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"""It's imperative that we break this cosy relationship between national testing authorities and their domestic carmakers,"" said Julia Poliscanova, a vehicle emissions specialist at Brussels-based campaign group Transport & Environment. ""This problem is at the heart of Dieselgate."""
Ford Motor,2017-2,"The Italian report may raise questions for Fiat Chrysler (FCA) as it faces a U.S. criminal investigation for alleged emissions manipulation and German accusations that it, like VW , used ""defeat devices"" to confound nitrogen oxide (NOx) tests."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"FCA on Monday became the third carmaker after VW and Renault to be referred to French prosecutors over the scandal. The Italian-American company denies breaking any laws, a spokesman reiterated, declining further comment. [nL5N1FR61Q]"
Ford Motor,2017-2,"The ministry findings, which have been circulated by some Italian opposition politicians and examined by Reuters, include complete sets of data for eight diesel cars made by BMW , Ford , Mercedes , Volkswagen and GM's Opel."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"But for three of the seven FCA models also investigated - a Jeep Cherokee 2.0, Alfa Romeo Giulietta 1.6 and Lancia Ypsilon 1.3 - results are missing from an on-road measurement phase and a reversed version of the EU's standard ""NEDC"" lab test."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"All seven FCA models also lack data for an ""Artemis"" test that adjusts the EU lab regime to reflect urban driving styles. The three skipped protocols are typically used to help unmask defeat devices by preventing them from detecting the test."
Ford Motor,2017-2,No explanation for the missing FCA results was offered in the document.
Ford Motor,2017-2,"But transport ministry spokeswoman Luisa Gabbi told Reuters a ""new definitive version"" had been drafted to include more data for FCA models following further tests, and would be published in coming weeks."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"""No key test has been omitted for FCA,"" she said."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"Following VW's exposure in 2015 for U.S. diesel test-cheating, several European countries launched their own investigative test programmes."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"Their results revealed on-road NOx emissions as high as 15 times the regulatory limits, as well as the widespread use of defeat devices that reduce exhaust treatment in some conditions."
Ford Motor,2017-2,FCA is among carmakers including Renault and GM that have broadly invoked an EU legal loophole designed to allow such software only when it is necessary for safety or engine protection. All deny breaking the law.
Ford Motor,2017-2,"In German and French testing, a Jeep Cherokee 2.0-litre similar to the model overlooked by Italian engineers emitted between 5.3 and 9.9 times the legal NOx limit under modified EU test cycles conducted in the lab or on the road."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"Independent road testing of a Fiat 500L with the same 1.6-litre engine as the omitted Alfa Giulietta measured NOx levels more than 5.6 times the statutory 180 miligrammes per kilometre for Euro 5 engines, according to UK-based Emissions Analytics."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"According to the Italian report, the FCA models were all analysed in Fiat's own labs under the supervision of ministry officials, while all other models were tested at an independent Istituto Motori facility."
Ford Motor,2017-2,The draft regulation before MEPs would bolster EU oversight of government testing authorities to address perceived conflicts of interest when they inspect and certify the cars of their own national manufacturing champions.
Ford Motor,2017-2,"Brussels would get powers to carry out vehicle spot-checks and allow national authorities to peer-review one another's decisions. Under current rules, a vehicle certification is valid EU-wide but can be revoked only by the country that issued it."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"Lawmakers on the European Parliament's internal market committee are expected to approve the draft with only minor amendments on Thursday, setting the stage for a plenary vote."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"The European Commission, which drew up the proposals last year, is mediating in a related dispute after Germany accused Italian regulators of failing to act on evidence that FCA models including the Fiat 500X use banned defeat devices."
Ford Motor,2017-2,A spokeswoman for the EU executive declined to comment on the Italian diesel report but emphasized the need for change.

Ford Motor,2017-2,Takata has been seeking financial backers through the selection process to help it deal with billions of dollars in costs related to the recall of millions of potentially defective airbag inflators that have been linked to at least 16 deaths globally.
Ford Motor,2017-2,"Previously, Reuters and other media had reported that autoparts suppliers including Sweden's Autoliv Inc had been in the running to bid for Takata."

Ford Motor,2017-2,"California requires auto companies and suppliers who test their self-driving vehicles on public roads to provide an annual compilation of miles traveled in autonomous mode and the number of ""disengagements,"" or times the self-driving system was deactivated and control handed back to humans because of a system failure or a traffic, weather or road situation that required human intervention."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk has said the company plans to install new hardware and software to enable fully autonomous driving in Tesla vehicles before the end of the year. Tesla's four self-driving test vehicles compiled 550 miles, with a disengagement every 3.5 miles."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"Waymo, the former Google auto unit that was renamed last fall, operated a fleet of 60 autonomous vehicles last year on California roads. While increasing miles traveled by 50 percent, it said the number of self-driving disengagements fell by 75 percent to 124, an average of one every 5,000 miles."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"Automakers are testing autonomous vehicles in several states and on private tracks - activity that would not be covered by the California reporting requirement. Autonomous driving systems, like other artificial intelligence programs, become more reliable and accurate by accumulating data either from simulations or real world testing."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"General Motors Co and its Cruise Automation affiliate logged nearly 10,000 miles in self-driving vehicles on California roads, many of them Chevrolet Bolts."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"GM's Cruise tested a fleet of electric vehicles, including 20 Bolts and five Nissan Leafs, equipped with self-driving systems, noting the number of disengagements fell as miles traveled increased in the latter half of the year. GM/Cruise averaged a disengagement every 50 miles."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"Nissan Motor Co <7267.T> tested a fleet that included three Leafs and two Infiniti Q50 sedans, logging 4,000 miles with a disengagement every 150 miles."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"Ford Motor Co and Daimler AG's Mercedes-Benz said their self-driving vehicles logged fewer than 1,000 miles each last year in California, while Honda Motor Co <7267.T> and Volkswagen AG said they did not test self-driving vehicles on public roads in the state."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"Besides California, three other states allow operation of self-driving vehicles on public roads and several others are considering similar legislation."

Ford Motor,2017-2,"DETROIT, Feb 1 (Reuters) - Automakers on Wednesday are likely to report a 3 percent decline in U.S. auto sales for January after a surprisingly strong December stole some thunder from the start of the new year, industry analysts and economists said."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"Still, with December's good showing pulling sales from January, normally the weakest month of the year in terms of sales volume, some analysts cautioned against putting too much emphasis on the month's annualized selling rate."
Ford Motor,2017-2,The 11 analysts polled by Reuters in Detroit showed expectations of an annualized selling rate of 17.4 million vehicles. A wider poll of 40 economists by Thomson Reuters showed estimates of 17.55 million vehicles on the annualized basis.
Ford Motor,2017-2,"The overall U.S. auto market remained on a roll, with rising sales for the past seven years, and record highs for the past two, they said. Each month, auto sales are an early indicator of U.S. consumer spending."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"Last year ended surprisingly strong. December U.S. sales were 18.43 million on a seasonally adjusted annualized basis, far outpacing expectations of 17.7 million vehicles."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"A Reuters poll of industry analysts showed expectations that General Motors Co sales fell about 2 percent, and guesses ranged from down 9 percent to up 3 percent."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"At Ford Motor Co , analysts expected, on average, that January sales dropped 3 percent, with estimates ranging from down 7 percent to up 2 percent."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"Fiat Chrysler Automobiles sales were seen dropping 16 percent, and analysts forecast stretched from between 14 percent and 18 percent."

Ford Motor,2017-2,"FRANKFURT/LONDON, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Germany's auto industry is losing hope that trade tariffs with Britain can be avoided, several executives have told Reuters, despite warnings from British Prime Minister Theresa May that an overly tough stance on post-Brexit commerce would seriously harm the country's EU partners."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"""Merkel may force us to walk away from UK profits for the sake of preventing further EU fragmentation,"" said a senior executive at a German luxury carmaker."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"The executive, who asked not to be identified because of the subject's sensitivity, said Brexit looks increasingly likely to be ""a disaster"" for trade and for German manufacturers."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"BMW , along with the Germany-based European arms of GM and Ford , which all have UK plants, know trade barriers would bring large, currently incalculable costs."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"Under World Trade Organization (WTO) rules, British exports of complete vehicles could be subject to tariffs of up to 10 percent."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"Ford, Britain's biggest engine maker, warned of 2.7 percent duties on engines ahead of last June's Brexit referendum."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"Duties on components such as gear boxes and brakes shipped from Britain would likely vary around the 3.7 percent average currently levied by the EU on similar imports from third countries, according to the WTO, unless a preferential deal is struck."
Ford Motor,2017-2,May recently vowed to take Britain out of the EU single market that allows tariff-free trade in order to gain more control over immigration.
Ford Motor,2017-2,"At the same time May argued for the ""greatest possible"" market access. But German Chancellor Angela Merkel responded that London should not get an attractive Brexit deal that might encourage other departures. [nB4N1DJ017]"
Ford Motor,2017-2,"Much is at stake for carmakers in general, and the Germans in particular. About every other car built in Britain is destined for another EU market. German-owned brands claim more than one-third of UK car sales."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"Think tank Civitas estimates that if Britain leaves the EU without a trade deal, German automotive exporters would pay 1.8 billion pounds ($2.3 billion) in tariffs, nearly half the total 3.9 billion pounds faced by EU-based firms."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"UK-built vehicles and parts, on the other hand, would be hit by tariffs of around 1.3 billion pounds, according to the group."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"But German car bosses are unwilling to undermine Merkel's position. Merkel recently reiterated that EU governments would not negotiate Brexit terms until London had triggered the irreversible ""article 50"" leaving process, before adding pointedly that business leaders should show similar restraint."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"That sentiment was quickly echoed by Matthias Wissmann, head of Germany's influential auto industry lobby, the VDA."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"""Everything must be done to allow the unfettered flow of goods and services,"" he told reporters. ""But there is one clear priority: we must stand together among the 27 EU member states."""
Ford Motor,2017-2,"Wissmann's counterpart at Britain's SMMT car industry group also warned UK lawmakers that BMW, Daimler and VW may not push too hard for free trade."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"German carmakers see ""Europe as more important than the UK market"", SMMT chief Mike Hawes told a parliamentary committee in January. ""They will align with what is best for Germany."""
Ford Motor,2017-2,"BMW employs in the region of 8,000 workers in Britain, including at its plants which export roughly 2.4 billion pounds of vehicles and engines, most notably a large majority of the Mini and Rolls-Royce cars assembled there."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"Ford, which has warned against tariffs, builds engines in Dagenham and Bridgend for vehicles assembled in mainland Europe. GM builds Opel/Vauxhall Astras on Britain's west coast and expects Brexit to have wiped $400 million from 2016 earnings."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"""We are worried,"" said a director at the German unit of a major global carmaker. ""I don't expect there will be special deals for any industry."""
Ford Motor,2017-2,"Trade duties on components, which can cross the Channel several times before a vehicle is assembled, would require costly supply-chain upheaval to avoid a compounding of duties."
Ford Motor,2017-2,Raw castings from mainland Europe are machined into engine blocks at BMW's Hams Hall plant near Birmingham. Many are then shipped to Germany and fitted into cars destined for the UK.
Ford Motor,2017-2,"In all, UK car plants purchase 59 percent of their components overseas, and two-thirds of those from the EU, the SMMT says. Even where cross-Channel supply chains stayed viable, border formalities would hurt delivery timings, raising warehousing costs and ultimately consumer prices."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"Locally made components would become more attractive for British-built cars, but the UK assembly plants could find it harder to win new vehicle programmes in the first place."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"Investing in an assembly line for the British market alone - rather than export - becomes viable only above an annual output of about 150,000 vehicles, industry experts explain."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"For many models, Exane BNP analyst Dominic O'Brien said, ""the UK market is not necessarily big enough to sustain its own dedicated plant."" Again, consumer choice and prices suffer."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"Some German carmakers have been more vocal in urging Britain to give ground, stressing attachment to their EU workers' freedom of movement."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"""Not only free trade but also cross-border employment opportunities ... are of proven benefit to business,"" BMW said."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"Still, huge unknowns remain, including French and German elections this year that could change the direction of Brexit."
Ford Motor,2017-2,Already there are some signs of dissent within the governing coalition between Merkel's conservative CDU and its Social Democrat SPD junior partner.
Ford Motor,2017-2,"Brexit should be used to spur EU reform, not deter would-be leavers, SPD Economy Minister Sigmar Gabriel said last week."
Ford Motor,2017-2,"""We should not purely focus on Brexit as a threat,"" he said. ""Should we reach a good result in negotiations with the UK, it could serve as an example for a Europe of different speeds."" ($1 = 0.8011 pounds)"
