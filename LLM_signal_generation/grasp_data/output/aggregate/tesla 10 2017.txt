tesla,2017-10,"DETROIT/SAN FRANCISCO, Oct 27 (Reuters) - Lei Xu and Justin Song once worked at electric carmaker Tesla Inc , one of the hottest companies in Silicon Valley. But with interest and investments in autonomous vehicles mounting, they left to pursue what they see as the next big thing."
tesla,2017-10,"Their company, Nullmax, is one of more than 240 startups worldwide, including 75 in Silicon Valley, attempting to design software, hardware components and systems for future self-driving cars, according to a Reuters analysis."
tesla,2017-10,"Xu and Song are bankrolled by corporate money, but unlike many of their fellow entrepreneurs, they skipped funding from Silicon Valley venture capitalists. Founded in August 2016, Nullmax got $10 million from a Chinese firm, Xinmao Science and Technology Co <000836.SZ>."
tesla,2017-10,"By seeking corporate backing in China, the Nullmax founders managed to sidestep an issue facing other startups in the sector: While big automotive and technology companies are pouring billions into the autonomous vehicle space, Silicon Valley investors so far have been fairly restrained in increasing their bets."
tesla,2017-10,"Headlines have been dominated by old-line players such as General Motors Co , which jolted the industry last year when it bought a tiny San Francisco software company called Cruise Automation for a reported $1 billion. Just this week, top-tier supplier Delphi Automotive PLC acquired Boston-based software startup nuTonomy for $450 million. [nL2N1MZ0VE]"
tesla,2017-10,"Now, ""every startup thinks they will get a billion dollars"" in valuation, said Evangelos Simoudis, a Silicon Valley venture investor and an advisor on corporate innovation."
tesla,2017-10,"However, investment in untested startup companies remains relatively modest despite all the buzz and lofty expectations. Total funding of self-driving startups from both corporate and private investors has barely topped $5 billion, the Reuters analysis of publicly available data shows."
tesla,2017-10,"With the notable exceptions of Andreessen Horowitz and New Enterprise Associates, few of the big Valley venture capital firms are heavily invested in the sector. Overall, only seven of the top 30 self-driving startups have received later-stage funding, the Reuters analysis shows, an indication that some venture capitalists are ambivalent about the industry's potential."
tesla,2017-10,Skeptics note that few of the startups are making money. And established auto and parts companies have not demonstrated a clear path to revenue and profitability in autonomous vehicles despite their big bets in the space.
tesla,2017-10,"Another sticking point: While the initial wave of self-driving vehicles is expected to begin commercial service in 2019-2020, experts expect the transition from human-driven to automated cars could take a decade or more to roll out."
tesla,2017-10,"Cautions Sergio Marchionne, chief executive officer of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles : ""You can destroy a lot of value by chasing your tail in autonomous driving."""
tesla,2017-10,"All told, U.S. automotive and technology firms likely have invested some $40 billion to $50 billion in self-driving technology in recent years, mainly through acquisitions and partnerships. The full extent is hard to know because big players such as Alphabet Inc , whose Waymo subsidiary is considered among the front-runners in the arena, have not revealed the full scope of their investments, although it is believed to be in the billions."
tesla,2017-10,"Among the top corporate investors in the sector are Samsung Group [SAGR.UL], Intel Corp , Qualcomm Inc , Delphi and Robert Bosch GmbH [ROBG.UL]. Corporate investors also have backed five of the six self-driving startups with valuations of $1 billion or more."
tesla,2017-10,"Whether the industry is poised to produce more such unicorns is now a topic of much debate. Two former investors in Cruise Automation, for example, are poles apart in their views of self-driving vehicles and technology."
tesla,2017-10,"Veronica Wu, managing partner in Palo Alto-based Hone Capital, said her company continues to invest in ""quite a number"" of self-driving startups, while acknowledging that the technology will take time to deploy."
tesla,2017-10,"""It's a matter of when, not if,"" she said. ""We're fairly optimistic."""
tesla,2017-10,"In contrast, Sunny Dhillon of Signia Venture Partners, another Cruise investor, said his firm does not see any attractive investments in the sector right now."
tesla,2017-10,"The hefty price paid by GM for Cruise, he said, ""made the space very frothy, with every computer vision and robotics PhD student seemingly emerging with a new self-driving car startup."""
tesla,2017-10,"In addition, he said many established players ""already have made their big investments (and) acquisitions"" in the sector. That could limit investors' potential returns and entrepreneurs' payoffs down the road."
tesla,2017-10,"Quin Garcia, a partner in San Francisco-based AutoTech Ventures, concurs that the space is crowded and valuations are inflated. There may still be ""a select few IPOs, but there will be many failures of autonomous vehicle startups"" by 2021, he said."
tesla,2017-10,"Those odds haven't deterred Nullmax founders Xu and Song, who are looking to differentiate themselves."
tesla,2017-10,"With many self-driving startups looking to supply U.S. and European automakers, the Chinese-born entrepreneurs, whose specialties are camera-based vision systems and artificial intelligence, are focused on China. They expect to deliver the first partially automated systems to Chinese automakers by 2020."
tesla,2017-10,"The U.S.-educated entrepreneurs, both 35, now work out of a small shop in Fremont, Calif., not far from Tesla's sprawling home factory. Xu once worked at Tesla as a senior engineer while Song specialized in supply chain and quality engineering. Tesla declined to confirm their prior employment."
tesla,2017-10,"Xu said the company employs about 50 people, most of them in a larger office in Shanghai. He said the company wants to keep a foot in California, which is a hub of U.S. tech talent, and where regulators have smoothed the way for testing of self-driving vehicles."
tesla,2017-10,"As for how Nullmax plans to cash out, Xu navigated around that question."
tesla,2017-10,"""We're pretty busy,"" he said. ""We don't much time to think about an IPO right now."""

tesla,2017-10,* Tesla is industry outlier with Model 3 seats assembled in-house
tesla,2017-10,"The seats on Tesla Inc's new Model X SUV were a mess. An outside contractor was having trouble executing the complicated design, spurring frustration and finger-pointing between Tesla and its supplier."
tesla,2017-10,"How would Tesla ever pull off mass production of the upcoming Model 3, the car intended to catapult the niche automaker into the big leagues, if it could not deliver on something as fundamental as a seat?"
tesla,2017-10,"Tesla's demanding chief executive vowed years ago to shake up the automotive industry with his line of electric vehicles and a futuristic manufacturing facility in Fremont, Calif. But industry experts say Musk's insistence on performing much of the work in-house is among the reasons Tesla is nowhere close to its stated goal of building 500,000 vehicles annually by next year, most of them Model 3s."
tesla,2017-10,"The automaker this month revealed it built just 260 of the vehicles between July and September, badly missing its target of 1,500 Model 3s in the third quarter. In a statement, Tesla blamed manufacturing ""bottlenecks."" It declined to elaborate, but assured investors ""there are no fundamental issues with the Model 3 production or supply chain."""
tesla,2017-10,Tesla has demonstrated a commitment to vertical integration not seen in the auto industry for decades.
tesla,2017-10,"The company has so far sunk $2 billion into a sprawling Nevada factory to manufacture its vehicles' batteries. In-house programmers design the bulk of the complex software that runs the Model 3, which Musk has described as a ""computer on wheels"". Tesla controls its own retail chain, selling its cars directly to customers and bypassing dealers."
tesla,2017-10,"But it is Tesla's 2015 decision to build its own seats that has some industry veterans scratching their heads. Seat making is a low-margin, labor-intensive enterprise that big automakers generally farm out to specialists. Tesla is operating its own seat assembly line inside its factory, and it is hiring engineers and technicians to figure out a way to fully automate the process."
tesla,2017-10,"""Is that really the core competency of an auto company? It is not,"" said analyst Maryann Keller, who has been tracking the car industry since the early 1970s. ""Why would you want to do that?"""
tesla,2017-10,"Tesla declined requests from Reuters to discuss its seat assembly efforts. The company is expected to reveal more about its production issues on Nov. 1, when it announces third-quarter results. There is no indication that the ""bottlenecks"" mentioned previously by the company are associated with seat production."
tesla,2017-10,"Tesla has never turned an annual profit and it is burning through cash. Yet investors are betting big on its future. It is now the second most valuable U.S. automaker, behind only General Motors Co . Tesla shares on Wednesday closed at $325.84, down 3.4 percent."
tesla,2017-10,"Musk has defended Tesla's hands-on approach as the way to ensure reliability, as well as an opportunity to rethink industry norms."
tesla,2017-10,It is also a reflection of the entrepreneur's obsession with detail.
tesla,2017-10,"""One of the hardest things to design is a good seat,"" Musk said at the September 2015 launch of the Model X in Fremont."
tesla,2017-10,"Problems first surfaced with the flagship Model S sedan in 2012. Musk complained that the seats made by its contract manufacturer, Australia-based Futuris Group, were not comfortable nor of the quality expected for a car whose price tag started at around $57,400, according to a former Tesla executive who described Musk's thinking to Reuters."
tesla,2017-10,"Troubles accelerated with the Model X, leading Tesla to wrest assembly from Futuris just after the vehicle's release in late 2015. If seats could be entirely redesigned from the ground up, Musk reasoned, maybe their assembly could be automated in preparation for the high volumes anticipated for the Model 3."
tesla,2017-10,"""He saw the opportunity to do it differently and better,"" the former Tesla executive said. ""The short term was a stop gap, but the long-term idea was to rethink the design of how a seat works to include how a seat is built."""
tesla,2017-10,"Futuris did not respond to requests for comment. It continues to supply seat parts to Tesla. Detroit-based seating supplier Adient PLC acquired Futuris for $360 million last month. Meanwhile, Tesla's seat woes continue. In all, the automaker has issued four seating-related recalls since 2013. The latest came this month with the recall of 11,000 Model Xs manufactured between Oct. 28, 2016 and Aug. 16, 2017. [nL4N1MN5KU]"
tesla,2017-10,"Making car seats is a complex business. Choosing materials, dying and cutting, shaping foam and metal frames, and adding heaters, recliners and other gadgets can involve nearly a dozen suppliers for top models. Final assembly requires lots of labor."
tesla,2017-10,"That's why most automakers opted decades ago to outsource seats for their lower-cost models to specialty seatmakers whose market is expected to reach $79 billion by 2022, according to market researcher Lucintel."
tesla,2017-10,"Although Musk's philosophy has always been ""build it right and then figure out how to get the cost down"" later, according to the ex-Tesla executive, observers say Tesla can ill afford more production headaches."
tesla,2017-10,"Philippe Houchois, an auto analyst with the investment bank Jefferies, wrote in a September note to clients that ""scalability"" was now the main challenge at Tesla, whose manufacturing prowess is still unproven when it comes to building large numbers of vehicles."
tesla,2017-10,"""We don't think Tesla's vertically integrated business model can be scaled up as profitably and quickly as consensus thinks,"" Houchois wrote."
tesla,2017-10,"Despite Tesla's previous battles with Futuris, seat suppliers smell opportunity. ZF Friedrichshafen and Faurecia have opened Silicon Valley labs, in part to woo Tesla."

tesla,2017-10,"DETROIT, Oct 24 (Reuters) - General Motors Co posted stronger-than-expected pre-tax profit for the third quarter on Tuesday, helped by cost-cutting and a shift to higher-margin trucks and sport utility vehicles, and its shares jumped to a record high."
tesla,2017-10,"GM reported a net loss due to charges related to the sale of its European operations, but the automaker's operating results beat Wall Street expectations and the company reaffirmed a forecast that 2017 financial results would be in line with last year's record performance."
tesla,2017-10,The automaker also assured investors it was on track to cut stocks of unsold vehicles in the U.S. to a manageable 70-days' supply by the end of the year.
tesla,2017-10,"GM, rival Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV , and heavy machinery maker Caterpillar Inc all are benefiting from a strong U.S. economy, continued growth in China and a recovery in demand from Latin America."
tesla,2017-10,"In the case of the automakers, U.S. car and light truck sales have so far defied predictions of a significant slump. September sales hit the fastest pace in 12 years as residents of Texas and Florida rushed to replace cars damaged by storms. [nL2N1ME0OD] [nL8N1MZ44E]"
tesla,2017-10,"The latest results sent GM shares up 2.3 percent to the highest levels since its initial public offering in 2010, amid a broad rally by U.S. manufacturing stocks. [nL2N1MZ0QZ]"
tesla,2017-10,GM over the past several months has regained its status as the largest U.S. automaker by market capitalization over electric luxury car maker Tesla Inc .
tesla,2017-10,"Some of GM's share price surge has come from investors betting on its investments in self-driving and electric cars. The company's profits, however, are driven entirely by demand for its petrol-fueled trucks and SUVs in North America, and its growing sales in China."
tesla,2017-10,"The No. 1 U.S. automaker said it expects U.S. vehicle sales to remain stable at an annual pace of about 17 million light vehicles in 2017, ""and we expect that in 2018 as well,"" GM Chief Financial Officer Chuck Stevens told reporters on Tuesday."
tesla,2017-10,"The U.S. auto industry has been coming off a strong run of sales that culminated in a record 17.55 million units in 2016. Industry analysts have predicted a slight decline for U.S. new car sales in 2017, driven in part by a flood of nearly-new, low-mileage off-lease vehicles into the market."
tesla,2017-10,"GM's share price has risen nearly 30 percent this year, in part as the company has highlighted efforts to put self-driving cars on the road. However, spending on autonomous vehicles and ride services amounted to just $150 million in the latest quarter, the company indicated in its financial report."
tesla,2017-10,"GM posted lower revenue for the quarter as it shuttered plants in North America to reduce production and tackle bloated inventory levels, especially of unpopular sedan models as consumers move increasingly to pickup trucks, SUVs and crossovers."
tesla,2017-10,"GM had 76 days' supply of unsold vehicles at the end of September, down from 88 days a month earlier and over 100 in the summer. The company's wholesale volumes were down 26 percent versus the same quarter in 2016."
tesla,2017-10,"GM is taming its inventory problem in the United States in part by laying off about 3,100 temporary and full-time hourly workers, mainly at factories that build compact and midsize sedans. The rapid shift by U.S. consumers to SUVs and pickup trucks in response to low, stable gasoline prices has left GM with too many North American factories tooled to produce low-profit sedans, analysts said. [nL4N1MN4NU]"
tesla,2017-10,GM showed a pre-tax profit in North America despite the steep production cuts and heavy discounts. Stevens credited cost-cutting and a shift to higher-profit trucks and sport utility vehicles. The company cut North American production costs by $2 billion during the first nine months of 2017.
tesla,2017-10,GM posted a quarterly net loss on Tuesday due to charges stemming from the sale of its Opel unit in Europe to France's Peugeot SA .
tesla,2017-10,"Detroit-based GM posted a third-quarter net loss of $2.98 billion, or $2.03 per share, compared with a profit of $2.77 billion, or $1.71 per share a year earlier. Excluding discontinued operations, GM posted a net profit of 8 cents per share."
tesla,2017-10,"But excluding one-time charges, the company earned $1.32 a share, above analyst expectations of $1.14."
tesla,2017-10,Revenue in the quarter fell to $33.6 billion from $38.9 billion a year earlier. Analysts had expected revenue of $32.72 billion.

tesla,2017-10,{{20171023T020718.326+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-Tesla could hit second gear with Shanghai factory(The authors are Reuters Breakingviews columnists. The opinions expressed are their own.)
tesla,2017-10,"NEW YORK/WASHINGTON, Oct 23 (Reuters Breakingviews) - A factory in Shanghai could help Tesla shift into second gear. It would give Elon Musk's $58 billion electric-car company a better shot at catching up to or keeping pace with rivals in the fast-growing market. Any deal, though, is apt to have some roadblocks."
tesla,2017-10,"China presents a large but perplexing opportunity for all foreign automakers. The country is now the biggest market for passenger cars. Though growth has been slowing, sales increased 3.3 percent in September from a year ago. Worsening air quality, however, has prompted Beijing to consider a possible ban on gasoline-only cars."
tesla,2017-10,"Many customers for now prefer gas-guzzling SUVs. And there are plenty of domestic competitors developing battery technology, such as Anhui Zotye Automobile <000980.SZ>, which recently struck an alliance with Ford . Tesla, for all its U.S. hype, has just around a 3 percent share of China's electric-vehicle market. It faces competition from Volvo , which is scrapping petrol-only vehicles from 2019, Daimler and General Motors ."
tesla,2017-10,"There are nagging problems at home, too. Tesla produced just 260 of its new Model 3s in the third quarter, far short of the more than 1,500 that were targeted. Musk talked of ""production hell"" on the road to building half a million vehicles next year, or roughly five times as many as the company is likely to manage in 2017. A factory in China should in theory alleviate some of the strain, while reducing costs and customer wait times."
tesla,2017-10,"The manufacturing facility deal reported by the Wall Street Journal on Sunday would not alleviate a core problem, however. Cars produced in a factory wholly owned and located within Shanghai's free trade zone probably will be subject to the country's 25 percent import tax."
tesla,2017-10,"The only way to evade the levy would be a joint venture with a Chinese partner. Tesla, an unprofitable enterprise currently valued at 30 times expected EBITDA for the next year, so far has been reluctant to tie such a knot because of legitimate concerns about technology transfer. And yet it's hard to imagine how its mass-market models can be competitive in China with the tariff included. As useful as a local factory would be, it may give Tesla limited acceleration."
tesla,2017-10,"- Tesla has reached an agreement with Shanghai officials to set up a manufacturing facility in the city's free trade zone, according a Wall Street Journal report published on Oct. 22, citing unnamed sources."
tesla,2017-10,"- The electric-car company said in June that it would ""clearly define"" its production plans in China by the end of the year. According to the news report, Tesla would likely still face 25 percent import duties on its factory-produced cars sold in China."

tesla,2017-10,"Consumer Reports said its rating was based on 2,000 consumer survey response about Tesla models. It also noted that its survey listed Tesla's Model S sedan as the magazine's top rated car with ""above average reliability for the first time ever."""

tesla,2017-10,The decision on a site for the battery plant was the latest step toward realising Northvolt's ambitious plans though it still has billions of euros in financing to secure.
tesla,2017-10,"South Korea's LG Chem <051910.KS> said last week it will open Europe's largest lithium-ion battery factory in Poland next year, employing 2,500 workers to produce up to 100,000 electric vehicle batteries per year. [nL8N1MN20I]"
tesla,2017-10,"Northvolt Chief Executive Peter Carlsson said while the plant would be located in Skelleftea and would eventually employ 2,000-2,500 people, the main research and development operations would be set up in Vasteras, due west of Stockholm."
tesla,2017-10,"""If environmental processes and other permitting moves as planned, we will be able to put the shovel in the earth during the later part of 2018 to build the first eight gigawatt hours,"" Carlsson told a news conference."
tesla,2017-10,The location in the far north would leave the plant near Sweden's main cluster of mines and mineral resources in a region that is home to a large body of workers in industries such as metal-working and has ample energy capacity.
tesla,2017-10,"Northvolt said rail connections already serving other industries in the northern region, as well as Skelleftea's deep-sea port, meant it did not expect transport costs to be prohibitive due the plant's location."
tesla,2017-10,"Carlsson said Northvolt was in talks with several companies about sourcing of key battery ingredients such as nickel, cobalt and lithium but declined to set a deadline for when deals needed to be in place."
tesla,2017-10,"Former Tesla executive Carlsson's Northvolt wants the Swedish plant to rival the scale of the U.S. electric carmaker's Gigafactory in the Nevada desert, targeting annual cell production equivalent to 32 gigawatt-hours by 2023, which would make it far larger than LG Chem's Polish plant."
tesla,2017-10,Northvolt needs at least 4 billion euros ($4.7 billion) in investments to realise its battery factory plans and is currently seeking to raise between 80 million and 100 million euros to fund a pre-production line.
tesla,2017-10,"""We are involved in a number of (financing) processes that we will be able to show the results of going forward,"" Carlsson said. ""So it is not something that keeps me up at night."""

tesla,2017-10,China has set strict quotas for electric and hybrid vehicles that carmakers need to hit by 2019 and has begun looking at an eventual ban on the production and sale of cars using fossil fuels.
tesla,2017-10,"Samuelsson said China's aggressive push towards electric vehicles was positive, though he disagreed with the prescriptive nature of the quota system. He added the government would need to work cooperatively with carmakers to make the shift work."

tesla,2017-10,But Europe lacks big-scale battery cell production facilities so those components are mostly imported from China and South Korea.
tesla,2017-10,"Calls are now growing for the region to develop its own battery industry to preserve jobs and profits, though Asian producers have a huge head start in development and scale."
tesla,2017-10,"LG Chem plans to spend 5.9 billion zlotys ($1.63 billion) on the factory near the southwestern city of Wroclaw, according to Polish state industry agency ARP."
tesla,2017-10,"Wroclaw is 190 kilometres (118 miles) from the border with Germany, home of VW Group which plans to invest more than 20 billion euros ($24 billion) in zero-emission vehicles by 2030 and make 3 million electric vehicles (EVs) a year by 2025."
tesla,2017-10,"LG Chem expects to produce up to 100,000 EV batteries in Poland annually from next year, it said on Thursday in a statement."
tesla,2017-10,"The factory will employ 2,500 people. LG Chem, a subsidiary of Korea's LG Corp <003550.KS>, did not name the likely customers but said they would include top car companies."
tesla,2017-10,"""The company has chosen Poland as the most competitive location for production to satisfy the needs of European and global car producers,"" said Chang-Beom Kang, vice president at LG Chem."
tesla,2017-10,"It was not immediately clear if the factory would produce all the basic battery cells from scratch or import some components, but the statement said the site would include a research and development centre employing ""about 400 engineers from various specialisations: automation, electronics, chemistry and IT""."
tesla,2017-10,"Asked about the source of lithium and other raw materials, a representative of LG Chem's local arm said they would first be imported from the parent company in Korea and then hopefully from Polish suppliers."
tesla,2017-10,The factory's planned capacity is just a fraction of expected future demand.
tesla,2017-10,"Based on the typical capacity of a mid-market compact car like Nissan Leaf, 100,000 car batteries are equivalent to 4 GWh per year. This means the factory's capacity could be slightly more than 10 percent of the production capacity that Tesla's U.S. based ""Gigafactory"" is to reach in 2018."
tesla,2017-10,"Battery costs have been prohibitive but are falling rapidly. Average battery costs have come down from over $1,000 per kilowatt hour in 2010, to around $227 in 2016, according to analysts at Barclays."
tesla,2017-10,"In 2016, only 0.2 percent of new passenger cars sold in Europe were fully electric."
tesla,2017-10,"But Britain and France say they will ban the sale of new petrol and diesel cars from 2040 in an attempt to reduce air pollution, ending use of the fossil fuel-guzzling internal combustion engine."
tesla,2017-10,LG's Polish plant may not remain Europe's largest car battery plant for long.
tesla,2017-10,"In September, Swiss engineering group ABB said it had joined a project to build Europe's largest lithium-ion battery factory in Sweden targeting annual cell production equivalent to 32 gigawatt-hours by 2023, over 90 percent of Tesla's Gigafactory target."
tesla,2017-10,"That project, named Northvolt, is led by a former manager at Tesla, which also plans to build a Gigafactory in Europe, though it has not said where. ($1 = 0.8428 euros) ($1 = 3.6117 zlotys)"

tesla,2017-10,"OSLO, Oct 12 (Reuters) - Norway plans to trim lavish tax breaks for Tesla and other electric cars that have given it the world's highest rate of battery-vehicle ownership, the right-wing government proposed on Thursday [nL5N1M23R5]."
tesla,2017-10,"The draft 2018 budget would mainly affect large cars weighing more than two tonnes, it said. Norwegian media dubbed the changes a ""Tesla Tax"", intended to cut down on sales of luxury models such as Tesla's Model X sport utility vehicle."
tesla,2017-10,"The proposal would change an exemption from motor vehicle registration tax and discounts in taxation of company cars. Norwegian media estimated it could push up the price of a Tesla Model X by 70,000 Norwegian crowns ($8,850)."
tesla,2017-10,"""Electric cars will still be accorded significant advantages in comparison with cars running on fossil fuels,"" the proposal said. It keeps in place breaks from value-added tax and benefits for zero carbon pollution."
tesla,2017-10,"Twenty-nine percent of all new car registrations in Norway were fully electric or plug-in hybrids last year, according to the International Energy Agency, far ahead of the second-place Netherlands, with 6.4 percent, and Sweden in third, on 3.4."
tesla,2017-10,"""Norway is gambling with the electric car market,"" Petter Haugneland of the Norwegian Electric Vehicle Association told Reuters."
tesla,2017-10,"Sales of Teslas rose almost 90 percent to 4,717 cars in the first nine months of the year from 2,500 in the same period of 2016, according to official sales statistics. Other carmakers, from Nissan <7201.T> to Volkswagen , have also had rising sales."
tesla,2017-10,"Environment Minister Vidar Helgesen has said that large electric cars wear out the roads just as much as normal cars. And electric car subsidies in Norway were originally introduced to encourage small, domestically produced electric cars, rather than luxury imports for the rich."
tesla,2017-10,The minority government will need backing from other parties for its proposal.

tesla,2017-10,"NEW YORK, Oct 5 (Reuters) - A Seattle-area startup, backed by the venture capital arms of Boeing Co and JetBlue Airways Corp announced plans on Thursday to bring a small hybrid-electric commuter aircraft to market by 2022."
tesla,2017-10,"The small airliner is the first of several planes planned by Zunum Aero, which said it would seat up to 12 passengers and be powered by two electric motors, dramatically reducing the travel time and cost of trips under 1,000 miles (1,600 km)."
tesla,2017-10,Zunum's plans and timetable underscore a rush to develop small electric aircraft based on rapidly evolving battery technology and artificial intelligence systems that avoid obstacles on a road or in the sky.

tesla,2017-10,"Zunum does not expect to be the first to certify an electric-powered aircraft with regulators. Rather, it is aiming to fill a market gap for regional travel by airlines, where private jets and commercial jetliners are too costly for many to use."
tesla,2017-10,Zunum's planes would fly from thousands of small airports around big cities to cut regional travel times and costs.
tesla,2017-10,"""Airlines are very keen to know how to fly a shorter distance and make money on it,"" Matt Knapp, co-founder and chief aeronautic engineer of the Kirkland, Washington-based company, said in an interview."
tesla,2017-10,"A flight from Silicon Valley to Los Angeles, for instance, would leave from Palo Alto, San Carlos, Hayward or Reid Hillview airports and arrive in Santa Monica, Burbank, Hawthorne or San Gabriel Valley airports. The cost would be about $120 one way, the company said."
tesla,2017-10,"The travel time of over four hours would be cut in half by avoiding the crowds and security lines at big hubs that are required for larger planes. About 96 percent of U.S. air traffic travels through 1 percent of its airports, leaving thousands of small airports virtually untapped, Knapp said."
tesla,2017-10,"Electric-vehicle batteries, such as those made by Tesla Inc and Panasonic Corp <6752.T>, would power Zunum's motors, although Zunum has no commitment with either company. A supplemental jet-fuel engine and electrical generator would be used to give the plane a range of 700 miles and ensure it stays aloft after the batteries are exhausted, Knapp said"
tesla,2017-10,"Zunum plans to make a larger plane seating up to 50 passengers at the end of the next decade, and the range of both would increase to about 1,000 miles as battery technology improves, Knapp said."
tesla,2017-10,"The planes eventually would fly solely on battery power, and are being designed to fly with one pilot and to eventually be remotely piloted, he added."
tesla,2017-10,"Recent advances in battery technology, lightweight electric motors and carbon composite airframes would cut the cost of flying Zunum's aircraft to about eight cents per seat-mile, about one-fifth that of a small jet or turboprop plane, Knapp said."
tesla,2017-10,"""We're getting airline pricing down on a small plane and doing it for short distances,"" Knapp said. ""That kind of aircraft doesn't currently exist."""
tesla,2017-10,"Zunum first announced its plans for hybrid-electric aircraft in April, and revealed that Boeing HorizonX and JetBlue Technology Ventures had invested in its initial round of venture funding. On Thursday it disclosed specifications and a timetable for the vehicle entering service."
tesla,2017-10,"Zunum says the plane would cruise at about 340 miles an hour and at altitudes of about 25,000 feet (7,600 meters) - slower and lower than conventional jets."
tesla,2017-10,"The motor, which Zunum is designing, will drive a fan similar to the bypass fan on a jet engine, but without a jet's combustion. Zunum has started talks with plane makers about building the airframe, and it is building non-flying prototypes of the powertrain to test batteries, the electrical system, software and other components, Knapp said."
tesla,2017-10,Current battery technology can only power the plane for about 100 miles so a gas-powered engine would be used to generate electricity to power the motors for additional range.

tesla,2017-10,"WASHINGTON, Oct 4 (Reuters) - A U.S. Senate panel on Wednesday unanimously gave the green light to a bill aimed at speeding the use of self-driving cars without human controls, a measure that also bars states from imposing regulatory road blocks."
tesla,2017-10,"The bill still must clear a Senate vote, but it appears on track to passage. This should rev up profits for automakers, technology companies and ride service providers, hastening the day when their robot cars can carry passengers on the same U.S. roads as cars driven by people."
tesla,2017-10,"General Motors Co , Alphabet Inc , Ford Motor Co and others have lobbied for the landmark legislation, while auto safety groups urged more safeguards and have pledged to keep fighting for changes."
tesla,2017-10,"However the measure will not speed the process for self-driving commercial trucks, which remain in a slower lane despite support from several Republican senators."
tesla,2017-10,"The Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee approved the bill, and the U.S. House of Representatives unanimously passed a similar measure last month. Automakers would be able to win exemptions from safety rules that require human controls. States could set rules on registration, licensing, liability, insurance and safety inspections, but not performance standards."
tesla,2017-10,"Senator John Thune, the Republican who chairs the Commerce Committee, said the bill ""underscores the bipartisan desire to move ahead with self-driving vehicle technology.... The safety and economic benefits of self-driving vehicles are too critical to delay."""
tesla,2017-10,"Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat, sought to amend the bill to require human controls in case of emergency, but dropped that proposal. Some senators argued it would be more dangerous to allow human drivers to seek to take over driverless cars."
tesla,2017-10,"Even with the legislative victory, developers of self-driving technology face technical challenges. There are also the complications of driverless vehicles sharing the road with human drivers. GM told California its self-driving cars were involved in six crashes in September.

tesla,2017-10,"Neither the House nor the Senate bill would speed approval of self-driving technology for vehicles over 10,000 pounds, a step pushed by trucking organizations. Labor unions raised safety and employment concerns, and Democrats resisted that part of the proposal."
tesla,2017-10,"Teamsters President Jim Hoffa said the ""safe development of advanced heavy trucking technology must encapsulate the life-and-death issues that are specific to that industry, not consider such consequences as an inconvenient after-thought."" He said Congress should also consider U.S. jobs."
tesla,2017-10,"Tesla Inc , Alphabet, Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] and others have said they are working on self-driving trucks."
tesla,2017-10,"After lengthy negotiations, congressional aides added language to the bill aimed at preserving legal rights to sue over defective vehicles. This resolved a dispute that threatened to derail the bill."
tesla,2017-10,"Within three years, the bill would allow automakers to each sell up to 80,000 self-driving vehicles annually if they could demonstrate they are as safe as current vehicles. Auto safety advocates complained it lacked sufficient safeguards."
tesla,2017-10,"The phase-in schedule was revised to initially allow 15,000 per manufacturer in the first year and up to 80,000 after three years, down from 50,000 to start and up to 100,000 in three years. It would eliminate the cap after four years."
tesla,2017-10,The bill grants the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) authority to exempt vehicles from federal safety requirements and the agency would have to make a determination within six months of getting a request.
tesla,2017-10,"The Self-Driving Coalition, a group of automakers, tech firms and advocates for the disabled, said the legislation ""will help ensure that the United States leads the world in self-driving innovation."""
tesla,2017-10,"Under the measure, NHTSA must write permanent rules on self-driving cars within a decade and regulators must study how to encourage U.S. production of self-driving equipment and also look at the impact of self-driving vehicles on infrastructure, traffic congestion and fuel consumption."

tesla,2017-10,"Skoda's main union warned that a production shift could cost as many as 2,000 jobs. VW's works council declined to comment."
tesla,2017-10,VW brand Chief Executive Herbert Diess is leading a parallel management effort to shield future VW models from direct competition with cheaper Skodas.
tesla,2017-10,"At a recent group executive committee meeting, Diess called for greater differentiation between VW and Skoda target markets and clientele, particularly for future electric models, three managers with knowledge of the matter said."
tesla,2017-10,"""The future positioning of brands is being looked at, but discussions are still ongoing,"" a VW group spokesman said, declining further comment."
tesla,2017-10,Tension is expected to rise ahead of a Nov. 17 supervisory board session due to approve annual investment budgets across the world's biggest carmaker.
tesla,2017-10,"Skoda's operating profit more than doubled over three years to 1.2 billion euros ($1.4 billion) in 2016, lifting its profit margin to 8.7 percent - second only to Porsche within the Volkswagen stable."
tesla,2017-10,"The VW brand, whose margin dipped to 1.8 percent after earnings fell by a third, still outsells Skoda globally but is growing more slowly in Europe."
tesla,2017-10,"Skoda's healthy profits partly reflect the shared car platform's economies of scale. Designed by VW engineers in Germany, MQB has been rolled out progressively since 2012."
tesla,2017-10,"But Skoda gets a further boost from cheaper labour. Manufacturing wages average 10.10 euros per hour in the Czech Republic, where most of its European cars are assembled, compared with 38.70 euros in German industry, according to Berlin's official statistics office."
tesla,2017-10,"How VW group CEO Matthias Mueller might resolve the dispute remains unclear. The clout of the German unions, which hold half of the company's 20 board seats, means Skoda's success may be viewed more as a problem than a model to emulate."
tesla,2017-10,"The German state of Lower Saxony, which occupies another two board seats, is also preoccupied with preserving VW jobs."
tesla,2017-10,Unease at VW's Wolfsburg headquarters has been compounded by car reviews in which its models have sometimes lost face to cheaper Skoda cousins sharing the MQB platform.
tesla,2017-10,"The new Skoda Kodiaq sports-utility vehicle (SUV) is priced 1,500 euros ($1,765) below the VW Tiguan yet trumped the German brand in a quality survey by Auto Motor und Sport magazine. Skoda's Superb also drew favourable comparisons with the Passat."
tesla,2017-10,"""We mainly attract customers from outside the VW group and that is also our mission,"" brand CEO Bernhard Maier told Reuters in a interview."
tesla,2017-10,"Competition for resources among VW brands is nothing new. Unions lobbied for VW to lead development of emerging-market cars, but Skoda was allowed to take charge."
tesla,2017-10,"Now the group's 20 billion euro push to launch 50 electric cars by 2025 has brought tensions to a head as VW managers fear their battery-powered models may also be undercut, people with knowledge of the discussions said."
tesla,2017-10,"""The electric vehicle market is a new ball game where you cannot simply maintain the brands' positioning,"" said one. ""Customers need to see that you are making changes."""
tesla,2017-10,VW and Skoda both plan to introduce coupe-styled electric SUVs in 2020 boasting the same 500 km (300 mile) range.
tesla,2017-10,Any renegotiation of platform cost-sharing could also affect each brand's contribution to the new MEB platform being developed for electric cars.
tesla,2017-10,"In public, however, VW has played down the rivalry. With a combined lineup approaching 100 vehicles, brand CEO Diess said, there is always some risk of stepping on toes."
tesla,2017-10,"""There will always be some substitution,"" he told Reuters. ""But some internal competition is also helpful."" ($1 = 0.8491 euros)"

tesla,2017-10,"There are two ways to make battery-driven vehicles: use a clean-sheet design like Tesla , or a traditional vehicle platform that can use all types of motor: combustion, electric or a hybrid of the two."
tesla,2017-10,"Electric motors are smaller than petrol or diesel engines, so electric vehicles designed from scratch can benefit from better interior packaging which allows a bigger passenger space. The problem: their unique design requires a dedicated production line and expensive new factories."
tesla,2017-10,"BMW learned this the hard way after pouring billions into bespoke carbon-fibre based electric cars, the i3 and i8, which failed to sell in large numbers."
tesla,2017-10,"""It is easy to build an electric car. It is difficult to earn money with it,"" said BMW research and development chief Klaus Froehlich."
tesla,2017-10,"Since BMW started selling the i3 in 2013, vehicle battery performance has improved by 40 percent, allowing carmakers to make electric cars with the same heavy underpinnings used by petrol cars and still get a range of 500 km from one charge."

tesla,2017-10,"BERLIN, Oct 4 (Reuters) - Volkswagen managers and unions are seeking to curb competition from lower-cost stablemate Skoda, move some of its production to Germany and make the Czech brand pay more for shared technology, company sources told Reuters."
tesla,2017-10,"As VW struggles to cut jobs and spending at German factories and turn the page on dieselgate, Skoda's superior car reviews and profitability have intensified the brands' rivalry within the Volkswagen empire."
tesla,2017-10,"VW now wants to curb what it sees as Skoda's unfair advantages - combining German technology with cheaper labour - and reaffirm the top-selling brand's primacy ahead of a wave of new electric car launches, the sources said."

tesla,2017-10,"Once the butt of jokes, Skoda has blossomed under 26 years of VW group ownership into a successful mid-market carmaker, steadily winning business from rivals - including VW - and surpassing even Audi's operating profit margin last year."
tesla,2017-10,"At the same time, VW is facing thousands of job cuts as management moves to trim excess capacity at German factories. Its powerful domestic unions see Skoda's success as both a threat and a potential lifeline. [nL8N1DJ0NS]"
tesla,2017-10,"VW workers' representatives are now demanding the transfer of some Skoda production to their underused German plants, a source close to the supervisory board told Reuters. The proposal aims to offset declining output of the VW Passat and ageing Golf that could otherwise threaten more jobs."
tesla,2017-10,They are also making the case that Skoda should pay higher royalties to use VW's main common vehicle platform. The so-called MQB architecture also underpins mid-sized models from the group's Audi and SEAT brands.
tesla,2017-10,VW brand Chief Executive Herbert Diess is leading a parallel management effort to shield future VW models from direct competition with cheaper Skodas.
tesla,2017-10,"At a recent group executive committee meeting, Diess called for greater differentiation between VW and Skoda target markets and clientele, particularly for future electric models, three managers with knowledge of the matter said."
tesla,2017-10,"""The future positioning of brands is being looked at, but discussions are still ongoing,"" a VW group spokesman said, declining further comment."
tesla,2017-10,Tension is expected to rise ahead of a Nov. 17 supervisory board session due to approve annual investment budgets across the world's biggest carmaker.
tesla,2017-10,"Skoda's operating profit more than doubled over three years to 1.2 billion euros ($1.4 billion) in 2016, lifting its profit margin to 8.7 percent - second only to Porsche within the Volkswagen stable."
tesla,2017-10,"The VW brand, whose margin dipped to 1.8 percent after earnings fell by a third, still outsells Skoda globally but is growing more slowly in Europe."
tesla,2017-10,"Skoda's healthy profits partly reflect the shared car platform's economies of scale. Designed by VW engineers in Germany, MQB has been rolled out progressively since 2012."
tesla,2017-10,"But Skoda gets a further boost from cheaper labour. Manufacturing wages average 10.10 euros per hour in the Czech Republic, where most of its European cars are assembled, compared with 38.70 euros in German industry, according to Berlin's official statistics office."
tesla,2017-10,"How VW group CEO Matthias Mueller might resolve the dispute remains unclear. The clout of the German unions, which hold half of the company's 20 board seats, means Skoda's success may be viewed more as a problem than a model to emulate."
tesla,2017-10,"The German state of Lower Saxony, which occupies another two board seats, is also preoccupied with preserving VW jobs."
tesla,2017-10,Unease at VW's Wolfsburg headquarters has been compounded by car reviews in which its models have sometimes lost face to cheaper Skoda cousins sharing the MQB platform.
tesla,2017-10,"The new Skoda Kodiaq sports-utility vehicle (SUV) is priced 1,500 euros ($1,765) below the VW Tiguan yet trumped the German brand in a quality survey by Auto Motor und Sport magazine. Skoda's Superb also drew favourable comparisons with the Passat."
tesla,2017-10,"""We mainly attract customers from outside the VW group and that is also our mission,"" brand CEO Bernhard Maier told Reuters in a interview."
tesla,2017-10,"Competition for resources among VW brands is nothing new. Unions lobbied for VW to lead development of emerging-market cars, but Skoda was allowed to take charge."
tesla,2017-10,"Now the group's 20 billion euro push to launch 50 electric cars by 2025 has brought tensions to a head as VW managers fear their battery-powered models may also be undercut, people with knowledge of the discussions said."
tesla,2017-10,"""The electric vehicle market is a new ball game where you cannot simply maintain the brands' positioning,"" said one. ""Customers need to see that you are making changes."""
tesla,2017-10,VW and Skoda both plan to introduce coupe-styled electric SUVs in 2020 boasting the same 500 km (300 mile) range.
tesla,2017-10,Any renegotiation of platform cost-sharing could also affect each brand's contribution to the new MEB platform being developed for electric cars.
tesla,2017-10,"In public, however, VW has played down the rivalry. With a combined lineup approaching 100 vehicles, brand CEO Diess said, there is always some risk of stepping on toes."
tesla,2017-10,"""There will always be some substitution,"" he told Reuters. ""But some internal competition is also helpful."" ($1 = 0.8491 euros)"

tesla,2017-10,{{20171003T150427.448+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-Ford is playing catch-up with General Motors(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.)
tesla,2017-10,"At 7.8 times next year's earnings, Ford trades at a premium to GM's 7.1 times, even after its stock tanked by more than a third under former Chief Executive Mark Fields. Skepticism about GM's post-bankruptcy turnaround offset Ford's missed earnings targets, declining profitability and confusion about its plans for a connected, self-driving future."
tesla,2017-10,"New boss Jim Hackett's big fix has gotten off to a poor start. On Monday, Ford announced it was setting up a new unit, Team Edison, to ""think big,"" ""make quicker decisions"" and ""think holistically"" about electric cars. Within hours, GM bested that, saying it would have 20 electric and hybrid vehicles on the road by 2023."
tesla,2017-10,"Autonomous and electric vehicles may not hit the roads en masse or be profitable for years. And whatever Hackett cooks up, Ford is unlikely to get near the valuation multiple of Tesla , even after the latter's third-quarter production of its Model 3 came in at less than a fifth of its target."
tesla,2017-10,"Nonetheless, the stakes are high. Automakers need to show they know roughly where they're going without squandering capital. GM, with its shares hitting a record high, gets the joke. If Hackett cannot show Ford does, too, its premium to GM is under imminent threat."
tesla,2017-10,- Ford Motor will unveil new Chief Executive Jim Hackett's strategy for the automaker after stock markets close on Oct. 3.
tesla,2017-10,"- Ford has formed a team to speed up development of electric cars, with a brief to ""think big,"" ""make quicker decisions"" and ""look holistically"" at the market, Sherif Marakby, vice president of autonomous vehicles and electrification, said on Oct. 2."
tesla,2017-10,- General Motors the same day outlined plans to put 20 electric-battery and fuel-cell vehicles on the roads by 2023. These would include most if not all of the at least 10 hybrid or electric cars Chief Executive Mary Barra has pledged to introduce to the Chinese market by 2020.
tesla,2017-10,"- GM's shares closed at a record high $42.15 on Oct. 2, driven higher by a Deutsche Bank research note saying the automaker plans to have autonomous ride-sharing service in operation by 2020."
tesla,2017-10,"- Tesla delivered 26,150 cars in the third quarter, the electric-car maker reported on Oct. 2. Of these, 220 were the new Model 3. A total of 260 Model 3s were built in the quarter, well below the target of 1,500."
