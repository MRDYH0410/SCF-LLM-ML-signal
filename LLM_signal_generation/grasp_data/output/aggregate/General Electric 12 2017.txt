General Electric,2017-12,"Dec 29 (Reuters) - The U.S. oil rig count rose by about 42 percent by end-2017 compared to the corresponding period last year, as energy companies boosted spending amid a recovery in crude prices."
General Electric,2017-12,"Drillers held the number of oil rigs steady for a second straight week at 747 in the week to Dec. 29. That was 222 more than the 525 rigs at the end of 2016, General Electric Co's Baker Hughes Inc energy services firm said on Friday."
General Electric,2017-12,"The oil rig count, an early indicator of future output, remained unchanged in December after rising by 10 in November. It declined by 3 in the fourth quarter after falling by 6 in the third quarter."
General Electric,2017-12,"U.S. oil prices closed above $60 a barrel for the first time since mid-2015 on the final trading day of the year, ending 2017 with a 12 percent gain spurred by strong demand and declining global inventories. [O/R]"
General Electric,2017-12,"Oil prices had been boosted by signs the global crude glut that has dogged the market since 2014 is shrinking, as a year of production cuts led by Middle East-dominated Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and Russia helped tighten the market."
General Electric,2017-12,OPEC cuts kicked off last January and are scheduled to continue throughout 2018.
General Electric,2017-12,"In 2017, U.S. crude futures have averaged about $51 a barrel, easily topping last year's $43.47 average."
General Electric,2017-12,"Looking ahead, futures were trading at about $59 for the balance of 2018 and $56 for calendar 2019 ."
General Electric,2017-12,"In anticipation of higher prices in coming years, U.S. financial services firm Cowen & Co said 21 of the roughly 65 E&Ps they track have already provided capital expenditure guidance for 2018 indicating a 13 percent increase in planned spending over 2017."
General Electric,2017-12,"Cowen, which has its own U.S. rig count, said it expects a gradual decline in the count in 2018."
General Electric,2017-12,"There were 929 oil and natural gas rigs active on Dec. 29, up 41 percent from the 658 at the end of 2016."
General Electric,2017-12,The average number of rigs in service in 2017 was 876. That compares with 509 in 2016 and 978 in 2015. Most rigs produce both oil and gas.
General Electric,2017-12,"U.S. crude oil production in October hit the highest in more than 46 years, rising by 167,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 9.64 million bpd, U.S. Energy Information Administration's monthly production report on Friday. [nL1N1OT0SZ]"
General Electric,2017-12,"If the figure is not revised next month, it would be the highest monthly level since May 1971."

General Electric,2017-12,"{{20171228T065949.858+0000}}INSIGHT-In Pakistan, questions raised over GE's flagship power turbinesISLAMABAD/SINGAPORE, Dec 28 (Reuters)"
General Electric,2017-12,"ISLAMABAD/SINGAPORE, Dec 28 (Reuters) - General Electric's flagship gas turbines ran into problems in Pakistan earlier this year, leading to delays and lengthy outages at three newly built power stations, according to several senior Pakistani officials and power executives."
General Electric,2017-12,"GE has said they were teething problems. But the questions over one of its most important products suggest another setback for the company in a year in which its shares have plunged and third-quarter results were called ""horrible"" by new Chief Executive John Flannery. GE is now undergoing major restructuring.[nL1N1NC1OM]"
General Electric,2017-12,There is no evidence that GE's 9HA-Class turbines have fundamental design flaws.
General Electric,2017-12,"Data from Pakistan's Central Power Purchasing Agency, seen by Reuters, showed the Bhikki, Haveli and Balloki plants jointly generated only a half of their current maximum capacity in August."
General Electric,2017-12,A month later all three plants showed improved output but remained well below capacity. Reuters was unable to review more recent data.
General Electric,2017-12,"""It had terrible consequences because we lost a lot of power which would have come to the grid during the peak summer,"" Yousaf Naseem Khokhar, the top civil servant in the Energy Ministry's power division, told Reuters."
General Electric,2017-12,"""It is now up to General Electric to rise to the challenge and to take care of these issues... before next summer starts,"" he said."
General Electric,2017-12,"In a statement sent to Reuters, GE said ""every commercial HA site today is demonstrating exceptional performance levels for both output and efficiency""."
General Electric,2017-12,"On the issues in Pakistan, GE said: ""We've encountered and communicated openly about launch challenges and readily resolved issues during this time. It's important to note that challenges are common with power plants of this size and complexity during the commissioning and early operations phase."""
General Electric,2017-12,"GE also said in a separate statement that the three plants are expected to deliver enough power to supply the equivalent of 7.3 million Pakistani homes over their 30-plus-year life cycle, and that will make a ""meaningful difference in the everyday lives of the people of Pakistan."""
General Electric,2017-12,"Due to its large and fast-growing population and economy and well developed gas infrastructure, Pakistan is seen as a key growth market for power turbine makers, with all major turbine makers actively looking for business."
General Electric,2017-12,"""Pakistan is seen as one of the fastest growing markets ... and there has been a plethora of contracting activity from Pakistan over the last couple years,"" said Saul Kavonic of energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie. Pakistan still needed ""additional investment in energy infrastructure,"" he added."
General Electric,2017-12,"The 9HA-class gas turbines, the GE power division's newest and most prestigious product, entered the Guinness World Records last year for efficiency, based on the amount of electricity generated from natural gas at the power plant in Bouchain, France, where it was first put into commercial operation in June last year."
General Electric,2017-12,"Both the 9HA and the 7HA turbines - the A stands for air-cooled - are in tough competition with similar products made by Germany's Siemens , Japan's Mitsubishi Hitachi Power Systems - a joint venture between Mitsubishi Heavy Industries <7011.T> and Hitachi <6501.T> - and Italy's state-controlled Ansaldo Energia."
General Electric,2017-12,"Flannery said in a GE investor presentation in November that ""resolving initial launch issues"" with HA class gas turbines would be a future priority."
General Electric,2017-12,"GE's shares have fallen 45 percent this year, hitting $17.31 on Wednesday, their lowest level since December 2011."
General Electric,2017-12,"The 125-year-old company announced this month it was cutting 12,000 jobs in its power division, about a fifth of the workforce, to cut costs. [nL1N1O713Q]"
General Electric,2017-12,"Operating profit of the power division, once the strongest part of GE's operations, fell 51 percent in the third quarter against the year-ago period. Flannery said the division, which brought in 28 percent of GE's revenue last year, was ""challenged"" but could be turned around in one or two years."
General Electric,2017-12,"Pakistan, desperate for additional electricity to avoid crippling blackouts, teamed up with GE to build the power stations at Bhikki, Haveli and Balloki, all in the most populous province Punjab, at breakneck speed."
General Electric,2017-12,"GE won the contracts to supply Pakistan with six turbines for the three power plants in 2015, based on the lowest priced deal per megawatt of capacity."
General Electric,2017-12,"The first problem was the deliveries were delayed by up to three months and missed some of the summer months this year, several Pakistani officials said. They said they were told the delays happened because a part of the turbine needed further testing."
General Electric,2017-12,"The plan was to fire up the turbines in simple cycle mode - delivering around 800 MW per power plant - in the spring of 2017 and then to upgrade to 1,200 MW combined cycle output after the summer."
General Electric,2017-12,"The delays infuriated Islamabad, because getting additional power during the summer was a crucial factor ahead of 2018 parliamentary elections."
General Electric,2017-12,"One of the two turbines at the Bhikki power plant was delayed by about a month. At the Balloki and Haveli plants, the turbines were delayed by about three months, two senior Pakistani officials aware of the situation said."
General Electric,2017-12,"Then, in early May, a combustion seal leak was detected at one of the turbines at the Bhikki plant."
General Electric,2017-12,"To fix this, and to apply the same remedy to the five other turbines, GE airlifted parts of the units to France for repairs."
General Electric,2017-12,"Pakistan's Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi, who was then the petroleum minister, told Reuters in July that GE spared no expense to fix the problems."
General Electric,2017-12,"But that meant one Bhikki turbine was offline for about 40 days and the other for about 50 days. The other two plants had not begun operations at the time, but came online in July and August."
General Electric,2017-12,"In a third setback, one of the turbines at the Haveli plant was badly damaged during a power outage three weeks after it was inaugurated in July, the Pakistani officials said."
General Electric,2017-12,"At such times, batteries and a generator act as back-ups to ensure a pump continues to push lube oil into the turbine."
General Electric,2017-12,"""Both didn't work,"" said one of the Pakistani officials, adding the diesel generator had no fuel. The turbine crashed, with damage estimated at $33 million, and although it was refitted with a new rotor by GE, it is still to resume operations."
General Electric,2017-12,The power station is being built by China's SEPCOIII Electric Power Construction Corporation. SEPCOIII did not return queries for comment.
General Electric,2017-12,"""GE and SEPCOIII are working together to determine the cause behind the loss of functionality of the planned backup power system,"" GE said in a statement."
General Electric,2017-12,A senior Pakistani official in Islamabad said the delays and outages had cast GE in a bad light.
General Electric,2017-12,"""Frankly speaking, they have lost a lot of credibility here in the government because of these plants,"" the official said."
General Electric,2017-12,"In September, Pakistan awarded its most recent power contract to Siemens, after bidding by several companies, including GE."
General Electric,2017-12,"Stephen Tusa, an analyst at JPMorgan in New York, wrote in a recent note that although GE has assured investors that the Pakistan problems have been resolved, they could re-emerge in other plants around the world."
General Electric,2017-12,"""The risk is that if these issues are not remedied, GE has already 'sold' another around 30 units (around 10 plus of which are in operation), some of which are at higher output ratings,"" he wrote."
General Electric,2017-12,"""Remedies would have to be applied up the curve, something we view as a challenge, especially as senior management tries to cut costs aggressively. Stay tuned."""
General Electric,2017-12,"In France, the Bouchain plant suffered 26 forced outages in the 15 months ending November, according to data published by operator Electricite de France (EDF) ."
General Electric,2017-12,"Despite these unplanned outages, GE and operator EDF, with whom GE has a long-standing alliance, say they are satisfied."
General Electric,2017-12,"""The cause of these events varies, and in certain cases a single event has been interpreted as multiple events. It would not be accurate to link this number to HA technology as fewer than 10 of these events were related to the gas turbine,"" GE and EDF said in a joint statement."
General Electric,2017-12,"In a another joint statement, the two said ""the Bouchain facility is an example of our HA technology at its very best""."
General Electric,2017-12,"They added: ""During the commissioning and early operations phase, we encountered minor issues that are very typical of what you'd expect with a project of this size, but we worked together to quickly resolve them."""
General Electric,2017-12,"Dec 27 (Reuters) - U.S. industrial conglomerate General Electric Co said on Wednesday it would keep its plant running in Rochester, New York, retaining all employees at the facility for now."
General Electric,2017-12,"Boston-based GE in August was reportedly planning to close the plant by June 2018, and move the work to China. The plant, part of GE's troubled power business, assembles electronic boards and employs about 100 people."
General Electric,2017-12,"As part of an ""exhaustive review"" of GE Power's operations ""we have determined that, at this time, we are best able to serve our customers by keeping manufacturing and assembly operations for our industrial communications product line in Rochester,"" GE said in an emailed statement on Wednesday."
General Electric,2017-12,GE added that it was not offered any incentives by the state government to stay in Rochester.
General Electric,2017-12,"Earlier this month, GE said it would axe 12,000 jobs at its power business, which sells electrical generation equipment. [nL1N1O713Q]"

General Electric,2017-12,"{{20171227T181924.000+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-GE exits 3D-printing fight only slightly bruisedNEW YORK, Dec 27 (Reuters Breakingviews)"
General Electric,2017-12,(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.)
General Electric,2017-12,"NEW YORK, Dec 27 (Reuters Breakingviews) - John Flannery risks gaining a reputation as a pushover for activists. Two months after giving a board seat to Nelson Peltz's Trian Partners, the General Electric chief executive ended a 15-month tussle for ownership of Sweden's Arcam by buying hedge fund Elliott Management's stake at a modest premium. GE should benefit from having full control of a technology critical to its aviation business, even if it nets Elliott's Paul Singer a handsome profit."
General Electric,2017-12,"In September 2016, the U.S. conglomerate made offers worth a combined $1.4 billion for Arcam and Germany's SLM Solutions . Both companies make equipment for additive manufacturing, the technical name for 3D printing, on which GE increasingly relies. Elliott claimed they were low-ball bids and quickly snapped up an effective blocking stake of 20 percent of SLM and a smaller holding in Arcam."
General Electric,2017-12,"GE walked away from the German deal, causing SLM's stock to plunge by more than 20 percent in October 2016, but it bumped up its Arcam bid and succeeded in acquiring a roughly 75 percent stake. It also bought a private German 3D-printing outfit, Concept Laser."
General Electric,2017-12,"The total $720 million bill for Arcan's stock is a speck for the $151 billion GE. But it's a decent win for Elliott and fellow activist Polygon, who have secured a price about 25 percent higher than when they acquired their stakes. Even SLM's shares have recovered to put Singer in the black. Flannery, meanwhile, has again shown willingness to negotiate with activists. As precedents go, that's both commendable and risky."
General Electric,2017-12,"- General Electric said on Dec. 27 it had agreed to acquire minority stakes in Arcam from activist hedge funds Elliott Management and Polygon Investment, leaving it with roughly 95 percent of the Swedish 3D-printing company from 77 percent previously."
General Electric,2017-12,- GE said it would acquire the remaining shares in a compulsory buyout procedure and delist Arcam's shares from the Nasdaq Stockholm exchange.
General Electric,2017-12,"- The U.S. industrial group will pay 345 crowns a share, or $41.67, for the stakes held by the two hedge funds. According to Eikon data, Elliott owned an 8.5 percent stake according to its most recent regulatory filing while Tetragon Financial, the owner of Polygon, owned 5.3 percent. Those stakes would be worth $87 million and $54 million, respectively, at the purchase price."
General Electric,2017-12,- GE acquired a majority stake in Arcam in November 2016 with an agreed offer of 300 crowns a share.

General Electric,2017-12,* Loss-making A380 has lost out to new twin-engined jets
General Electric,2017-12,"PARIS, Dec 27 (Reuters) - Airbus is drawing up contingency plans to phase out production of the world's largest jetliner, the A380 superjumbo, if it fails to win a key order from Dubai's Emirates, three people familiar with the matter said."
General Electric,2017-12,"The moment of truth for the slow-selling airliner looms after just 10 years in service and leaves one of Europe's most visible international symbols hanging by a thread, despite a major airline investment in new cabins unveiled this month."
General Electric,2017-12,"""If there is no Emirates deal, Airbus will start the process of ending A380 production,"" a person briefed on the plans said. A supplier added such a move was logical due to weak demand."
General Electric,2017-12,Airbus and Emirates declined to comment. Airbus also declined to say how many people work on the project.
General Electric,2017-12,"Any shutdown is expected to be gradual, allowing Airbus to produce orders it has in hand, mainly from Emirates."
General Electric,2017-12,"It has enough orders to last until early next decade at current production rates, according to a Reuters analysis."
General Electric,2017-12,The A380 was developed at a cost of 11 billion euros to carry some 500 people and challenge the reign of the Boeing 747.
General Electric,2017-12,"But demand for these four-engined goliaths has fallen as airlines choose smaller twin-engined models, which are easier to fill and cheaper to maintain."
General Electric,2017-12,"Emirates, however, has been a strong believer in the A380 and is easily the largest customer with total orders of 142 aircraft, of which it has taken just over 100."
General Electric,2017-12,"Talks between Airbus and Emirates over a new order for 36 superjumbos worth $16 billion broke down at the Dubai Airshow last month. Negotiations are said to have resumed, but there are no visible signs that a deal is imminent. [nL8N1NI07Z]"
General Electric,2017-12,"Although airlines such as British Airways have expressed interest in the A380, Airbus is reluctant to keep factories open without the certainty that a bulk Emirates order would provide."
General Electric,2017-12,"Emirates, for its part, wants a guarantee that Airbus will keep production going for a decade to protect its investment."
General Electric,2017-12,"A decision to cancel would mark a rupture between Airbus and one of its largest customers and tie Emirates' future growth to recent Boeing orders. European sources say that reflects growing American influence in the Gulf under President Donald Trump, but U.S. and UAE industry sources deny politics are involved."
General Electric,2017-12,There are also potential hurdles to a deal over engine choices and after-sales support. [nL8N1NN2NC]
General Electric,2017-12,"Yet if talks succeed, European sources say there is a glimmer of hope for the double-deck jet, which Airbus says will become more popular with airlines due to congestion."
General Electric,2017-12,"Singapore Airlines, which first introduced the A380 to passengers in 2007, showcased an $850 million cabin re-design this month and expressed confidence in the model's future."
General Electric,2017-12,"Airbus hopes to use an Emirates order to stabilise output and establish a safety net from which to attract A380 sales to other carriers, but has ruled out trying to do this the other way round, industry sources said."
General Electric,2017-12,"As of the end of November, Airbus had won orders for 317 A380s and delivered 221, leaving 96 unfilled orders."
General Electric,2017-12,"But based on airlines' intentions or finances, 47 of those are unlikely to be delivered, according to industry sources, which halves the number of jets in play."
General Electric,2017-12,Airbus needs to sell at least another 30 to keep lines open for 10 years and possibly more to justify the price concessions likely to be demanded by any new buyers.
General Electric,2017-12,"To bridge the gap, Airbus plans to cut output to six a year beyond 2019, from 12 in 2018 and 8 in 2019, even if it means producing at a loss, Reuters recently reported. [nL8N1OB4H2]"
General Electric,2017-12,Chief Operating Officer Fabrice Bregier confirmed this month Airbus was looking at cutting output to 6-7 a year. [nS7N1NM00C]
General Electric,2017-12,"If Airbus does decide to wind down production, some believe Emirates will ask Airbus to deliver the remaining 41 it has on order and then keep most A380s in service as long as possible."
General Electric,2017-12,"Even so, some A380s are likely to be heading for scrap."

General Electric,2017-12,"ISLAMABAD/SINGAPORE, Dec 27 (Reuters) - General Electric's flagship gas turbines ran into problems in Pakistan earlier this year, leading to delays and lengthy outages at three newly built power stations, according to several senior Pakistani officials and power executives."
General Electric,2017-12,"GE has said they were teething problems. But the questions over one of its most important products suggest another setback for the company in a year in which its shares have plunged and third-quarter results were called ""horrible"" by new Chief Executive John Flannery. GE is now undergoing major restructuring.[nL1N1NC1OM]"
General Electric,2017-12,There is no evidence that GE's 9HA-Class turbines have fundamental design flaws.
General Electric,2017-12,"Data from Pakistan's Central Power Purchasing Agency, seen by Reuters, showed the Bhikki, Haveli and Balloki plants jointly generated only a half of their current maximum capacity in August."
General Electric,2017-12,A month later all three plants showed improved output but remained well below capacity. Reuters was unable to review more recent data.
General Electric,2017-12,"""It had terrible consequences because we lost a lot of power which would have come to the grid during the peak summer,"" Yousaf Naseem Khokhar, the top civil servant in the Energy Ministry's power division, told Reuters."
General Electric,2017-12,"""It is now up to General Electric to rise to the challenge and to take care of these issues... before next summer starts,"" he said."
General Electric,2017-12,"In a statement sent to Reuters, GE said ""every commercial HA site today is demonstrating exceptional performance levels for both output and efficiency""."
General Electric,2017-12,"On the issues in Pakistan, GE said: ""We've encountered and communicated openly about launch challenges and readily resolved issues during this time. It's important to note that challenges are common with power plants of this size and complexity during the commissioning and early operations phase."""
General Electric,2017-12,"GE also said in a separate statement that the three plants are expected to deliver enough power to supply the equivalent of 7.3 million Pakistani homes over their 30-plus-year life cycle, and that will make a ""meaningful difference in the everyday lives of the people of Pakistan."""
General Electric,2017-12,"The 9HA-class gas turbines, the GE power division's newest and most prestigious product, entered the Guinness World Records last year for efficiency, based on the amount of electricity generated from natural gas at the power plant in Bouchain, France, where it was first put into commercial operation in June last year."
General Electric,2017-12,"Both the 9HA and the 7HA turbines - the A stands for air-cooled - are in tough competition with similar products made by Germany's Siemens , Japan's Mitsubishi Hitachi Power Systems - a joint venture between Mitsubishi Heavy Industries <7011.T> and Hitachi <6501.T> - and Italy's state-controlled Ansaldo Energia."
General Electric,2017-12,"Flannery said in a GE investor presentation in November that ""resolving initial launch issues"" with HA class gas turbines would be a future priority."
General Electric,2017-12,"GE's shares have fallen more than 40 percent this year, and the 125-year-old company announced this month it was cutting 12,000 jobs in its power division, about a fifth of the workforce, to cut costs. [nL1N1O713Q]"
General Electric,2017-12,"Operating profit of the power division, once the strongest part of GE's operations, fell 51 percent in the third quarter against the year-ago period. Flannery said the division, which brought in 28 percent of GE's revenue last year, was ""challenged"" but could be turned around in one or two years."
General Electric,2017-12,"Pakistan, desperate for additional electricity to avoid crippling blackouts, teamed up with GE to build the power stations at Bhikki, Haveli and Balloki, all in the most populous province Punjab, at breakneck speed."
General Electric,2017-12,"GE won the contracts to supply Pakistan with six turbines for the three power plants in 2015, based on the lowest priced deal per megawatt of capacity."
General Electric,2017-12,"The first problem was the deliveries were delayed by up to three months and missed some of the summer months this year, several Pakistani officials said. They said they were told the delays happened because a part of the turbine needed further testing."
General Electric,2017-12,"The plan was to fire up the turbines in simple cycle mode - delivering around 800 MW per power plant - in the spring of 2017 and then to upgrade to 1,200 MW combined cycle output after the summer."
General Electric,2017-12,"The delays infuriated Islamabad, because getting additional power during the summer was a crucial factor ahead of 2018 parliamentary elections."
General Electric,2017-12,"One of the two turbines at the Bhikki power plant was delayed by about a month. At the Balloki and Haveli plants, the turbines were delayed by about three months, two senior Pakistani officials aware of the situation said."
General Electric,2017-12,"Then, in early May, a combustion seal leak was detected at one of the turbines at the Bhikki plant."
General Electric,2017-12,"To fix this, and to apply the same remedy to the five other turbines, GE airlifted parts of the units to France for repairs."
General Electric,2017-12,"Pakistan's Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi, who was then the petroleum minister, told Reuters in July that GE spared no expense to fix the problems."
General Electric,2017-12,"But that meant one Bhikki turbine was offline for about 40 days and the other for about 50 days. The other two plants had not begun operations at the time, but came online in July and August."
General Electric,2017-12,"In a third setback, one of the turbines at the Haveli plant was badly damaged during a power outage three weeks after it was inaugurated in July, the Pakistani officials said."
General Electric,2017-12,"At such times, batteries and a generator act as back-ups to ensure a pump continues to push lube oil into the turbine."
General Electric,2017-12,"""Both didn't work,"" said one of the Pakistani officials, adding the diesel generator had no fuel. The turbine crashed, with damage estimated at $33 million, and although it was refitted with a new rotor by GE, it is still to resume operations."
General Electric,2017-12,The power station is being built by China's SEPCOIII Electric Power Construction Corporation. SEPCOIII did not return queries for comment.
General Electric,2017-12,"""GE and SEPCOIII are working together to determine the cause behind the loss of functionality of the planned backup power system,"" GE said in a statement."

General Electric,2017-12,"Dec 22 (Reuters) - U.S. energy companies kept the oil rig count unchanged this week, General Electric Co's Baker Hughes energy services firm said on Friday, even though crude prices hovered near their highest level since the summer of 2015."
General Electric,2017-12,"The rig count , an early indicator of future output, held at 747 in the week to Dec. 22, still much higher than a year ago when only 523 rigs were active after energy companies boosted spending plans for 2017 as crude started recovering from a two-year price crash."
General Electric,2017-12,"The increase in U.S. drilling lasted 14 months before stalling in August, September and October as some producers trimmed their 2017 spending plans after prices turned softer over the summer. Energy firms started adding rigs again in November as crude prices rose."
General Electric,2017-12,"So far in 2017, U.S. crude futures have averaged about $51 a barrel, easily topping last year's $43.47 average. This week, futures traded at about $58 a barrel, putting them close to their highest since June 2015."
General Electric,2017-12,"Looking ahead, futures were trading at $58 for the balance of 2018 and $55 for calendar 2019 ."
General Electric,2017-12,"In anticipation of higher prices in coming years, U.S. financial services firm Cowen & Co said 21 of the roughly 65 E&Ps they track have already provided capital expenditure guidance for 2018 indicating a 13 percent increase in planned spending over 2017."
General Electric,2017-12,"Cowen said the E&Ps it tracks said they would spend about $66.1 billion on drilling and completions in the lower 48 U.S. states in 2017, about 53 percent over what they planned to spend in 2016."
General Electric,2017-12,"Cowen, which has its own U.S. rig count, said it expects a gradual decline in the count in the fourth quarter of 2017 and in 2018."
General Electric,2017-12,"Analysts at Simmons & Co, energy specialists at U.S. investment bank Piper Jaffray, this week slightly reduced their forecast for the total oil and natural gas rig count to an average of 876 in 2017, 999 in 2018 and 1,127 in 2019. Two weeks ago, it forecast 876 in 2017, 1,001 in 2018 and 1,128 in 2019."
General Electric,2017-12,There were 931 oil and natural gas rigs active on Dec. 22. The average number of rigs in service so far in 2017 was 875. That compares with 509 in 2016 and 978 in 2015. Most rigs produce both oil and gas.

General Electric,2017-12,"TORONTO, Dec 22 (Reuters) - Canadian National Railway Co will buy 200 locomotives in the next three years from General Electric Co , Canada's biggest railway operator said on Friday, to support expected growth and drive efficiencies."
General Electric,2017-12,"CN, Canada biggest railway operator, is extending a major hiring spree into 2018 as it scrambles to keep pace with demand and fill vacancies, aiming to add at least 2,000 more workers to the 3,500 it hired in 2017. [nL1N1NN1W4]"
General Electric,2017-12,"Montreal-based CN has been doing brisk business in western Canada, hauling bumper crops and intermodal containers to port, and has seen soaring volume of sand shipped for use in fracking shale rock to produce oil and gas."

General Electric,2017-12,"Dec 22 (Reuters) - Canadian National Railway Co said on Friday it will buy 200 locomotives in the next three years from General Electric Co , betting on higher demand for crude oil transportation."
General Electric,2017-12,The move comes as oil and gas producers in Canada's energy-rich Alberta province clamor to get their barrels to market via rail amid supply disruptions resulting from a leak in TransCanada Corp's Keystone pipeline.
General Electric,2017-12,Crude-by-rail shipments are also expected to rise next year as supply from new projects increases and outpaces current pipeline capacity.
General Electric,2017-12,"""We are bullish on the North American economy and on our ability to compete and win new business with our superior service model,"" CN Chief Executive Luc Jobin said in a statement. [nPn6rNfL9a]"

General Electric,2017-12,"MUNICH, Dec 15 (Reuters) - Germany's Siemens sees its broad industrial base and respect for customers' data privacy as giving it the edge in a race to attract businesses to its factory software platform, rather than those of rivals."
General Electric,2017-12,"The trains-to-turbines group is betting the future of its core industrial automation business on its MindSphere platform, which competes with General Electric's Predix and a host of others to help customers cut costs and improve productivity."
General Electric,2017-12,"The race is still wide open, and being first to gather a critical mass of software developers and system integrators is crucial to winning customers, much as Apple's large developer community made its app store the most attractive."
General Electric,2017-12,"""One thing is clear: Size matters,"" Jan Mrosik, chief executive of Siemens' 11.5 billion-euro Digital Factory division, told Reuters in an interview on Friday."
General Electric,2017-12,"Siemens said it was targeting 1.25 million connected devices and systems by the end of its fiscal year in September, up from 1 million currently, as it expands its offering - previously focused on autos and aerospace - to cover all sectors."

General Electric,2017-12,"NEW YORK, Dec 14 (Reuters) - Delta Air Lines said on Thursday it will place a firm order for 100 Airbus A321neo jets and an optional order for 100 of the aircraft."
General Electric,2017-12,"Delta, the No. 2 U.S. airline by passenger traffic, said in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that it expects deliveries to begin in the first quarter of 2020, with new aircraft arriving through 2023."
General Electric,2017-12,"CNN and Reuters reported yesterday that Airbus had beaten out rival Boeing Co for the order, boosting Airbus' leading share of the market for narrowbody models, while highlighting the increasingly fraught relationship between Delta and Chicago-based Boeing."
General Electric,2017-12,The two U.S. companies' relationship began to fray in October when Boeing successfully lobbied the U.S. Commerce Department to propose trade duties of nearly 300 percent on Delta's order of CSeries jets from Canada's Bombardier Inc . [nL2N1MH1AQ]
General Electric,2017-12,The carrier declined to say whether the disagreement between the two planemakers had any effect on its decision to go with Airbus.
General Electric,2017-12,"""This is the right transaction at the right time for our customers, our employees and our shareholders,"" Chief Executive Ed Bastian said in a statement."
General Electric,2017-12,"Delta's decision also gives lift to United Technologies subsidiary Pratt & Whitney, which the carrier said had won the contract for the engines that will power the A321neo aircraft."
General Electric,2017-12,"In the same SEC filing, Delta also said it now expects operating margin of 11 percent for the fourth quarter, compared with the 11 percent to 13 percent it had previously forecast"
General Electric,2017-12,Delta Air Lines' shares were up 2.9 percent at $55.21 in afternoon trading.
General Electric,2017-12,"European industry officials hailed the jet order as an endorsement of Airbus's presence in the United States, where it opened an assembly plant in Mobile, Alabama, in 2015, in the hopes of further penetrating the U.S. market."
General Electric,2017-12,"That plant is at the center of the Boeing-Bombardier trade dispute since it is where the Canadian company plans to assemble jets for Delta under the CSeries airliner program, which has since been acquired by Airbus. [nL2N1MS02E]"
General Electric,2017-12,"Delta's order is expected to involve discounts of well over 50 percent from the $12.7 billion catalog value, an aircraft market source said."

General Electric,2017-12,"NEW YORK, Dec 8 (Reuters) - Stocks that have been lackluster so far in 2017 are unlikely to see their fortunes reversed in the final month of the year, as investors engage in tax-harvesting practices before the new year."
General Electric,2017-12,"Investors often exercise tax-loss selling strategies, dumping stocks that have performed poorly in order to reduce or eliminate capital gains taxes, as the year draws to a close."
General Electric,2017-12,"""This is something we do every December, we take losses for clients who we've created gains for,"" said Jake Dollarhide, chief executive officer of Longbow Asset Management in Tulsa, Oklahoma."
General Electric,2017-12,"""Your clients want their cake and they want to eat it too - so they want to see an 8 to 12 percent return in any given year and they'd like to also not have to pay capital gains taxes."""
General Electric,2017-12,"Tax overhaul negotiations in Washington have also added a potential wrinkle this year, as investors may wait until a clearer picture emerges. An investor seeking to divest a stock from their portfolio may hold off until January to delay paying taxes until the following year."
General Electric,2017-12,"""There are a lot of people waiting on tax reform to make those decisions,"" said Ken Polcari, director of the NYSE floor division at O'Neil Securities in New York."
General Electric,2017-12,Stocks that were among the worst performing on the benchmark S&P 500 index in 2016 saw losses mount in the final month of that year. TripAdvisor fell 4 percent in December before closing the year with a loss of nearly 46 percent. Vertex Pharmaceuticals dropped nearly 10 percent for the month to close out the year with a decline of 41.5 percent.
General Electric,2017-12,"That selling has often led to what is referred to by market participants as the ""January effect,"" when stocks, particularly smallcap names, that may have been sold in December for tax harvesting, experience a rebound the following month."
General Electric,2017-12,"Investors are prevented from selling shares for tax harvesting purposes and buying them, or shares in a similar stock, within 30 days by an Internal Revenue Service regulation against what is known as a ""wash sale."" That wait period helps create a lag before the beaten-down stocks rebound."
General Electric,2017-12,"However, identifying stocks that may be potential buying opportunities because of tax harvesting strategies has become more difficult."
General Electric,2017-12,"Many mutual funds share a fiscal year-end date at the conclusion of October and may start to sell for tax purposes in September. In addition, investors have become attuned to the practice and no longer limit the selling to December."
General Electric,2017-12,"""Tax loss selling is like holiday shopping, it happens earlier and earlier every year,"" said Nicholas Colas, co-founder at DataTrek Research in New York."
General Electric,2017-12,"At the start of 2017, TripAdvisor bounced back with a 14.1 percent rally for January, and Vertex surged 16.6 percent compared with the 1.8 percent S&P 500 <.SPX> gain for the month."
General Electric,2017-12,"Among smallcap names, Mirati Therapeutics tumbled 11.2 percent in December 2016 en route to a drop of about 85 percent for the year. The stock rebounded sharply at the start of 2017, with a jump of over 7 percent in January."
General Electric,2017-12,"Among the worst performers for the year on the S&P 500, Under Armour and Range Resources have slumped more than 50 percent, while Signet Jewelers and General Electric have lost more than 40 percent. On a sector basis, energy has struggled across the market cap spectrum for the year."
General Electric,2017-12,Further complicating matters this year was the strong performance registered by equities in September and October.
General Electric,2017-12,"While those two months are historically a difficult time for the stock market, the S&P 500 rose roughly 2 percent in September and October, while the smallcap Russell 2000 index <.RUT> jumped 6 percent in September and tacked on another 0.8 percent in October."
General Electric,2017-12,"""This year, we had pretty good performance in September and October,"" said Steve DeSanctis, equity strategist at Jefferies in New York. ""Now it is up to other things like tax that is going to be more of a driver."""

General Electric,2017-12,"ZURICH/LAS VEGAS, Dec 7 (Reuters) - General Electric Co said Thursday it is axing 12,000 jobs at its global power business, the struggling industrial conglomerate's latest effort to shrink itself into a more focused company."
General Electric,2017-12,"The U.S. company launched the cuts to save $1 billion in 2018 at its Power business, saying it expects dwindling demand for fossil fuel power plants to continue. GE's cuts follow a decision by rival Siemens AG to slash 6,900 jobs in the face of a global shift by electric utilities away from fossil fuels to renewable sources of energy such as wind and solar. [nL8N1NM5IN]"
General Electric,2017-12,"GE did not give a breakdown of the job cuts, which represent about 4 percent of its overall workforce of 295,000, saying only that they would be primarily outside the United States. The cuts represent about 18 percent of GE's Power business, GE said."
General Electric,2017-12,The announcement cast a spotlight on GE's decision to spend 9.7 billion euros ($10.7 billion when the deal closed in 2015) on the energy business of France's Alstom . The deal rounded out GE Power's portfolio by adding steam and nuclear capabilities to its mainly natural gas turbine power business.
General Electric,2017-12,"But the purchase came just as demand for new power plants was slowing, in part due to competition from wind and solar systems."
General Electric,2017-12,"""Traditional power markets including gas and coal have softened,"" GE said on Thursday, explaining the decision for the job cuts."
General Electric,2017-12,"Rumors of sweeping job cuts were confirmed by labor union sources on Wednesday, with staff in Switzerland, Germany and Britain among those badly hit. [nL8N1O63PO]"
General Electric,2017-12,"Unite, the largest trade union in Britain and Ireland, said the announcement put 1,100 jobs at risk and it vowed to fight against any compulsory layoffs in the UK."
General Electric,2017-12,"GE risks ""cutting too far, too fast,"" to deal with the changing power market."
General Electric,2017-12,"But GE said the cuts were essential, since sales of new power plants are falling. Industry estimates expect sales of about 110 to 120 new gas-powered turbines a year, but capacity at GE and other major suppliers is about four times that."
General Electric,2017-12,"""This decision was painful but necessary for GE Power to respond to the disruption in the power market, which is driving significantly lower volumes in products and services,"" said Russell Stokes, head of GE Power."

General Electric,2017-12,"{{20171206T191303.806+0000}}UPDATE 2-General Electric to cut 4,500 jobs in Europe -source(Adds context on GE's Alstom purchase, updates share price)"
General Electric,2017-12,"Dec 6 (Reuters) - General Electric Co plans to cut as many as 4,500 jobs in Europe as the U.S. industrial conglomerate shrinks its troubled power generation business, a labor union source said on Tuesday."
General Electric,2017-12,"The cuts, which are linked to businesses GE bought from France's Alstom in 2015, will affect employees in Switzerland, Germany and Britain, said French newspaper Les Echos, which first reported the news on Tuesday."
General Electric,2017-12,The union source confirmed the layoff numbers to Reuters on Wednesday and said an official announcement was expected as early as Thursday.
General Electric,2017-12,"GE did not confirm the numbers but said it was ""reviewing its operations to ensure the business is best positioned to respond to our market realities and for long-term success."" The company had presented a proposal to the European body representing legacy Alstom employees, it added."
General Electric,2017-12,"Last month, GE Power Chief Executive Russell Stokes said the company could reduce its global footprint by 30 percent."
General Electric,2017-12,GE shares were down less than 1 percent on Wednesday afternoon. The stock has fallen about 44 percent since the start of the year and is the year's worst performer on the Dow Jones Industrial Average <.DJI>.
General Electric,2017-12,"GE acquired about 65,000 Alstom employees, $20 billion in annual revenue and dozens of field offices and manufacturing sites around the world when it bought the power assets of the French company in 2015, according to regulatory filings and presentations at the time."
General Electric,2017-12,"The acquisition rounded out GE's Power portfolio by adding steam turbine capabilities, adding to GE's mostly natural gas turbine power business. It also gave GE a larger installed base of plants to service. But the deal came just as demand for new power plants was slowing, in part due to competition from cost-competitive wind and solar systems."
General Electric,2017-12,"Last month, General Electric CEO John Flannery outlined plans to cut back GE's power business to respond to a sharp fall in demand for fossil fuel power equipment. GE did not specify how many jobs would be cut or where."
General Electric,2017-12,"The reported layoffs are part of GE Power's plan to integrate GE's energy connections and power businesses, seeking to save $1 billion in costs next year and another $500 million in 2019, William Blair analyst Nicholas Heymann said."
General Electric,2017-12,"""Renewables will not have any reductions because the world is rapidly shifting from fossil to renewables as the cost of temporarily storing power becomes more affordable at $100/Kw for power packs,"" Heymann added, referring to GE's renewable energy business."
General Electric,2017-12,"Due to the weakness in its power business, GE last month lowered its earnings forecast and slashed its dividend by half, expecting to save about $4 billion in cash annually. [nL3N1NJ3GQ]"
General Electric,2017-12,"GE aims to reduce overhead costs by $1 billion this year and $2 billion in 2018 as Flannery, who took the top job in August, prepares to refocus the 125-year-old conglomerate toward aviation, healthcare and power."
General Electric,2017-12,"GE has already shed 25 percent of its corporate staff or some 1,500 jobs around the world."
General Electric,2017-12,"Flannery's plans include hiving off at least $20 billion of assets through sales, spin-offs or other means and retaining only business that offer growth, a leading market position and a large installed base."

General Electric,2017-12,"LONDON, Dec 5 (Reuters) - Shares reacted much more violently than usual to surprises in company results in the latest quarterly reporting season as investors put a laser-like focus on earnings, generously rewarding winners but mercilessly punishing laggards."
General Electric,2017-12,"It's a phenomenon that runs counter to the generally depressed levels of volatility at the stock index level, and presents opportunities for investors in derivatives trading as well as in traditional stock-picking."
General Electric,2017-12,"Stock markets around the world have surged to a succession of record highs this year, but, far from a rising tide lifting all boats, the gap between winners and losers is widening."
General Electric,2017-12,"Earnings day price moves have been the most extreme on record, Goldman Sachs strategists said, with stocks notching up 3.6 times the average daily move after results."
General Electric,2017-12,The sharp swings show investors are focusing strongly on individual company performance and underline the crucial importance of strong earnings.
General Electric,2017-12,"""We have something like record low index volatility, but individual stock volatility is not low at all and we have seen a spike up in individual stock vol(atility),"" Luke Ellis, CEO of Man Group, told Reuters at an investment summit."
General Electric,2017-12,"The stock market's verdict on individual companies differed sharply, providing a ""fantastic opportunity"" for stock pickers to beat the index, he said."
General Electric,2017-12,"This results season has seen blue-chip companies like General Electric in the United States sink 13 percent, while European investors punished both EDF and Burberry to the tune of one-tenth of their market value and Nokia by 18 percent on earnings day."
General Electric,2017-12,"Companies with strong earnings have also been rewarded more than usual, correcting the negative skew seen last quarter where earnings misses were punished more severely than beats were celebrated."
General Electric,2017-12,"""If the big move is coming from earnings then it's telling you there's a lot of exuberance about earnings growing,"" said Amit Khanna, head of equity research at QuantInsight."
General Electric,2017-12,"""And if that's not the case and a company misses, you will have a lot of disappointment."""
General Electric,2017-12,"As Eric Moore, income fund manager at Miton Group put it: ""When companies disappoint they're getting properly spanked. The market is in an unforgiving mood."""
General Electric,2017-12,Part of investors' heightened sensitivity is because earnings have been the driving force behind stock markets' stellar gains this year - and are expected to drive risk appetite through 2018.
General Electric,2017-12,"""2018 is going to be a perfectly decent year for risk assets, on the assumption we get another decent year of profit growth,"" Standard Life's head of global strategy, Andrew Milligan, told Reuters last week. ""Profits are still the be-all and end-all for the coming year."""
General Electric,2017-12,"The majority of returns in equities this year have been driven by earnings rather than by the value of a company growing through improved performance, Credit Suisse figures showed."
General Electric,2017-12,"In Europe year-to-date, gains have been almost entirely earnings-led - with 85 percent of returns driven by growth in earnings per share. In emerging markets that figure is 70 percent while the United States owes 50 percent of its returns to earnings, the Credit Suisse figures show."
General Electric,2017-12,"Knowing that returns are so highly dependent on companies' bottom line, investors have been ruthless. While the shares of tantalisingly fast-growing companies have skyrocketed this year, investors' patience with mediocre results has run thin."
General Electric,2017-12,"Global investors' allocation to equities rose to a net 49 percent overweight in November, the highest since April 2015, Bank of America Merrill Lynch's (BAML) fund manager survey showed."
General Electric,2017-12,"Higher stock volatility has not translated into greater average index volatility, partly because the large earnings-day moves were often corrected the following day."
General Electric,2017-12,"""Investors have been very, very quick to buy the dip and that's equivalent to fading the volatility spikes, which therefore have not been very long-lived,"" said Abhinandan Deb, EMEA head of equity derivatives at BAML."
General Electric,2017-12,Confidence in the underlying economic growth driving the market put the brakes on any drawn-out sell-offs in stocks.
General Electric,2017-12,"All of this adds up to a perfect environment for stock-picking, a boon for active managers fighting to win back flows which have been pouring into exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and other passive vehicles this year."
General Electric,2017-12,"""The opportunity set for making money from stock-picking is higher than it's been before,"" said Deb."
General Electric,2017-12,"Goldman Sachs strategists, who observed this pattern in Europe and the United States, said skittishness in stocks on earnings days, combined with generally calmer moves outside of results, was a sign of increased uncertainty under the surface."
General Electric,2017-12,Data from the bank's U.S. strategists shows a rise in single stock volatility is generally associated with a decline in equity returns.
General Electric,2017-12,"""While they do not believe this is a reason to sell the market (or buy VIX (the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index)) it is certainly a trend to be monitoring closely,"" Goldman strategists wrote."
General Electric,2017-12,"Rather than worrying about volatility affecting returns, some investors have taken advantage of the phenomenon to reap returns in derivatives markets."
General Electric,2017-12,"Investors piled into a ""dispersion trade"" this year, buying stock volatility and selling index volatility. This relative trade bets on stock correlations falling while hedging against the possibility that volatility might remain low."
General Electric,2017-12,"""This strategy has been very popular this year, with strong volumes traded on the EuroSTOXX 50 and the S&P 500 by hedge funds and asset managers,"" said Kokou Agbo-Bloua, global head of flow strategy at Societe Generale."
General Electric,2017-12,"It is also a less costly strategy than being outright long volatility, Agbo-Bloua added."
General Electric,2017-12,"As market volatility starts to show signs of life, investment vehicles tracking lower volatility stocks have also been performing better. Fidelity's low volatility factor ETF made its strongest gains in nine months in November."
General Electric,2017-12,"""In a rising volatility environment, there is likely to be demand for low volatility assets (which become scarcer),"" Goldman strategists said."

General Electric,2017-12,"NEW YORK, Dec 1 (Reuters) - General Electric Co said on Friday it was laying off workers at its power division in Schenectady, New York, as it tries to reduce costs after a steep profit drop at the division."
General Electric,2017-12,"A report by local ABC TV affiliate News10, citing sources inside GE's Schenectady plant, said about 75 people had been notified that they are being let go."
General Electric,2017-12,"So far this year, GE has laid off at least 75 other workers in New York state, according to state records."
General Electric,2017-12,"GE Chief Executive John Flannery, who took over in August, has promised to cut $1 billion in company spending this year and $2 billion in 2018, as the company grapples with its weak financial results and declining share price. GE's profit fell about 9 percent in the third quarter. [nL4N1MV3IM]"
General Electric,2017-12,"GE has grounded corporate jets, eliminated company cars for hundreds of executives, delayed part of its Boston headquarters and reduced employment in many locations."
General Electric,2017-12,"The company has also changed a number of top executives, including installing a new CFO, and plans to exit more than $20 billion in business in the next two years."
General Electric,2017-12,"""GE has previously announced a plan to reduce $3 billion in cost by the end of 2018,"" the company said in a statement. ""Those actions include, but are not limited to, employee reductions, which have been under way for many months."""
General Electric,2017-12,"GE said ""a significant decline in orders"" at GE Power prompted the layoffs in Schenectady. Workers will receive severance and help finding new jobs, GE said."
General Electric,2017-12,"GE's downsizing is not limited to its power division. In July, the company disclosed plans to lay off 575 workers at a railroad locomotive plant in Erie, Pennsylvania. An August report commissioned by the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America Local 506, which represents the workers, estimated they earn about $108,000 a year in pay and benefits."
