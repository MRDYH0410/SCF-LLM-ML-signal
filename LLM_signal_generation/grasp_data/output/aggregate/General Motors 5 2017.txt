General Motors,2017-5,"SEOUL/BEIJING, May 28 (Reuters) - Bruised by anti-Korean sentiment in its biggest market and losing ground to local automakers, Hyundai Motor <005380.KS> will open its first Chinese brand store, and may locally assemble its premium Genesis cars and accelerate the launch of a sport-utility vehicle (SUV), people familiar with the plans said."
General Motors,2017-5,"The measures are aimed at rebooting the South Korean firm's branding in China, where many see Hyundai as a lower-end maker of city taxis."
General Motors,2017-5,"Hyundai and its affiliate Kia Motors <000270.KS> were not long ago ranked third among foreign car brands in China, but recent sales have been hit by a consumer backlash over South Korea's deployment of a U.S. anti-missile defence system which Beijing opposes. [nL4N1I62L0]"
General Motors,2017-5,Analysts say the diplomatic row masks broader problems for Hyundai/Kia in China: poor brand recognition and a model line-up struggling against local brands' cheaper SUVs.
General Motors,2017-5,"""Hyundai has an in-between brand that doesn't have a clear identity in China, and there's the backdrop of poor China-Korea relations,"" said James Chao, Shanghai-based Asia-Pacific chief of consulting firm IHS Markit Automotive."
General Motors,2017-5,"""Newly introduced SUVs should help, but they are late to the game."""
General Motors,2017-5,"Even before the missile systems row, Hyundai/Kia's China market share tumbled to 8.1 percent last year, the lowest in eight years. This year, it has slid further to 5 percent."
General Motors,2017-5,"To help its identity crisis, Hyundai will in September open a brand experience centre in Beijing's 798 Art District, a trendy hub of refurbished factory buildings. Hyundai has three similar centres in Seoul and one in Moscow."
General Motors,2017-5,"""We're not going to show a real car. This space is only for focusing on brand building,"" Xu Jing, the Hyundai executive in charge of the project, told Reuters."
General Motors,2017-5,"The centre was planned before the recent political tensions, but its completion is now a key plank in Hyundai's efforts to regain a lost position in China as local automakers and European brands gain ground. Volvo-owner Geely <0175.HK> and Great Wall Motor <601633.SS> are also looking to move upmarket."
General Motors,2017-5,"The branding store ventures into territory traditionally held by premium names such as Daimler's ""Mercedes me"" stores and BMW's brand centres, already in China."
General Motors,2017-5,Hyundai is also considering using complete knock-down (CKD) kits shipped from South Korea to assemble Genesis cars in China - more than halving import tariffs to 10 percent - two people familiar with the matter said.
General Motors,2017-5,"Building Genesis cars from kits in China would also prevent technology leaking to its local joint venture partner, BAIC <1958.HK>, one of the people added."
General Motors,2017-5,"The kits are a first step, said one Hyundai insider. ""We are agonizing over how to source local parts and secure enough sales to build the Genesis cars."""
General Motors,2017-5,"Hyundai launched its Genesis luxury sedan in 2008, and two years ago spun it off with the larger Equus sedan into a standalone premium brand. Brand chief Manfred Fitzgerald said last year Genesis would launch in China within 2-3 years. [nL3N1BP3R9]"
General Motors,2017-5,"Hyundai has not decided which Genesis model it will build in China first, but plans to have six models including a sports sedan and two SUVs under the premium marque by 2020."
General Motors,2017-5,"""While the Genesis brand is reviewing a variety of strategies for the China market, no specific decisions have been made yet,"" Hyundai said in a statement."
General Motors,2017-5,"Hyundai sold 74 Genesis sedans in China last year, down from 1,016 in 2015. It sold a single Equus, down from 10 the previous year, according to export data seen by Reuters."
General Motors,2017-5,"Hyundai may also bring forward by a month, to November, the launch of a small SUV, codenamed NU, to be built at its fourth factory in China, one of the people told Reuters."
General Motors,2017-5,"And Kia is considering launching the Stinger, its first sports sedan, in China, people with direct knowledge of the matter said, though there are no plans to build the model there."
General Motors,2017-5,"Hyundai said it also plans to apply new, cutting-edge technologies such as connectivity and advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) to many products from the second half of this year, and soon introduce six new-energy vehicles."
General Motors,2017-5,"Since starting to make cars in China in 2002, Hyundai has aggressively chased sales and market share by selling both older and new versions of models including the Elantra and Sonata sedans and Tucson SUV."
General Motors,2017-5,"Among foreign car brands, Hyundai's China sales lag only those of General Motors and Volkswagen , but it's generally seen as more lower-end than American, German and Japanese rivals. Beijing Hyundai has supplied around a fifth of the capital's taxis."
General Motors,2017-5,"The volume sales model ""did wonders for sales growth, but dented the Hyundai image in the minds of Chinese buyers,"" said Michael Dunne, president of consultancy Dunne Automotive."
General Motors,2017-5,"""(Having a) weaker brand ... than Japanese automakers, I think it might take more time to restore the brand and sales,"" said Han Sang-yun, director at S&P, noting Japanese car makers took a year to bounce back in China after a 2012 consumer backlash over a territorial dispute between Beijing and Tokyo."

General Motors,2017-5,"May 25 (Reuters) - General Motors Co was accused in a lawsuit on Thursday of rigging hundreds of thousands of diesel trucks with devices similar to those used by Volkswagen AG , to ensure they pass emissions tests."
General Motors,2017-5,"The proposed class-action lawsuit covers people who own or lease more than 705,000 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickups fitted with ""Duramax"" engines from the 2011 to 2016 model years."
General Motors,2017-5,"It said GM used at least three ""defeat devices"" to ensure that the trucks met federal and state emission standards, even if they generated more pollution in real-world driving. The complaint was filed in the federal court in Detroit."
General Motors,2017-5,"""These claims are baseless and we will vigorously defend ourselves,"" GM spokesman Dan Flores said."
General Motors,2017-5,He added that the trucks comply with U.S. Environmental Protection Agency emissions standards and California's own tough emissions standards.
General Motors,2017-5,"The lawsuit alleges violations of racketeering and consumer protection laws, and seeks remedies including possible refunds, restitution for lost resale value, and punitive damages."
General Motors,2017-5,"It adds to legal problems for Detroit-based GM, which has already paid about $2.5 billion in penalties and settlements over faulty ignition switches linked to 124 deaths. [nL1N1HW0HC]"
General Motors,2017-5,"GM joins VW, which has admitted to cheating, and at least four other automakers whose diesel emissions have been scrutinized by regulators or consumers."
General Motors,2017-5,"They include Mercedes-Benz parent Daimler AG , Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV , Peugeot SA and Renault SA [nL8N1HX295]"
General Motors,2017-5,"GM shares were down 74 cents, or 2.2 percent, at $32.46 in afternoon trading, after earlier falling as much as 3.8 percent."
General Motors,2017-5,"RBC Capital Markets analyst Joseph Spak estimated that one-eighth of GM's full-sized pickups have diesel engines, and said ""negative publicity"" from the lawsuit could steer prospective buyers to Ford Motor Co or Fiat Chrysler's Ram division."
General Motors,2017-5,"According to the lawsuit, ""on-road"" emissions testing conducted for the plaintiffs found that Duramax-engined trucks produced nitrogen oxide pollutants two to five times higher than allowed, and ""many times"" higher than gasoline-engined trucks."
General Motors,2017-5,"Modifying the engines to meet emissions standards would reduce performance, horsepower and fuel economy, the 184-page complaint said."
General Motors,2017-5,"Germany's Robert Bosch GmbH [ROBG.UL] was also named as a defendant for having allegedly helped develop the defeat devices, in an ""unusually close"" collaboration with GM."
General Motors,2017-5,Bosch spokeswoman Alissa Cleland said that company will not discuss matters being investigated or litigated.
General Motors,2017-5,"The named plaintiffs are Andrei Fenner of Mountain View, California and Joshua Herman of Sulphur, Louisiana."
General Motors,2017-5,"They said they would not have bought, or would have paid less for, their respective 2011 Sierra and 2016 Silverado trucks had they known about the alleged rigging."
General Motors,2017-5,"Their law firms include Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro, which helped reach multibillion-dollar settlements for VW owners and dealers and has brought similar claims over GM's diesel-equipped Chevrolet Cruze."
General Motors,2017-5,"Hilliard Munoz Gonzales, which handles many GM ignition switch lawsuits, also represents the plaintiffs."
General Motors,2017-5,"On Tuesday, the U.S. Department of Justice filed a civil lawsuit accusing Fiat Chrysler of using software on 104,000 diesel vehicles sold since 2014 to evade emission standards."

General Motors,2017-5,"BENGALURU/DETROIT, May 25 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co on Thursday reshuffled senior management and brought back a former executive from Uber Technologies Inc, signaling its new chief executive officer will rely on tested company veterans to turn Ford around rather than outside talent."
General Motors,2017-5,"James Hackett, named CEO on Monday, has said he wants to streamline Ford's hierarchy and speed up decision-making, as the No. 2 U.S. automaker faces threats from Silicon Valley's self-driving technology and resurgent rival General Motors Co in its traditional markets. [nL1N1IQ14I]"
General Motors,2017-5,"Ford said it hired Sherif Marakby as its new vice president in charge of its autonomous and electric vehicle efforts. Marakby had been hired away from ride-hailing company Uber [UBER.UL], where he was vice president of global vehicle programs. Prior to joining Uber last year, Marakby was at Ford for more than 25 years and worked on hybrid and electric vehicles."
General Motors,2017-5,"The automaker said it will also combine its purchasing and product development operations under Hau Thai-Tang, previously head of global purchasing. Thai-Tang, 50, will have the task of simultaneously accelerating vehicle development and reining in costs as rival GM unleashes a volley of models aimed at the heart of Ford's product lineup."
General Motors,2017-5,"Raj Nair, currently Ford's executive vice president of product development and chief technical officer, will take over as president, North America, effective June 1, the company said. He will be responsible for operations that generate about 90 percent of Ford's global profits."
General Motors,2017-5,"In other moves, Ford named Steven Armstrong as head of Europe, Middle East and Africa and Peter Fleet as chief of Asia Pacific and China."
General Motors,2017-5,"Armstrong is currently chief operating officer for Ford of Europe, while Fleet is in charge of sales and marketing for the Asia-Pacific region."
General Motors,2017-5,"Last week, the company announced plans to cut 1,400 white-collar positions and is expected to make significant cost cuts in the coming months."

General Motors,2017-5,"DETROIT, May 25 (Reuters) - James Hackett spent the last year plotting Ford Motor Co's long-term self-driving car strategy. In his first week as chief executive, he has more immediate concerns: stopping a skid in North American sales and fending off a market share grab by resurgent archrival General Motors Co ."
General Motors,2017-5,"The U.S. No. 2 automaker is stuck in a product drought that shows no signs of easing until 2019, according to two sources who track Detroit's launch plans. Given the auto industry's long product cycles, it is not clear what Hackett can do immediately to get Ford out of its predicament, which can be traced back to decisions by former CEOs."
General Motors,2017-5,Hackett was tapped to run the company's autonomous car and ride-sharing unit a year ago. On Monday he unexpectedly found himself at the helm of the whole company as Ford axed CEO Mark Fields. [nL4N1IO2J0]
General Motors,2017-5,"He now has to face up to a void of new vehicles, partly caused by former CEO Alan Mulally, who focused much of the company's resources on an expensive 2014 redesign of Ford's crown jewel, the F-Series pickup."
General Motors,2017-5,"That safeguarded America's longtime best-selling vehicle, but it prevented Ford from developing other hits. Given that it typically takes three to four years for a new or redesigned vehicle to get into production, the full effect of Mulally's narrow focus is now being felt."
General Motors,2017-5,"Mulally also gambled heavily on making an expensive shift to aluminum from steel to lighten up trucks and make them more fuel efficient, a bet that looks questionable in retrospect, as gas prices have remained far lower than anyone expected."
General Motors,2017-5,"If Fields had immediately started pulling forward product launches when he took over from Mulally in July 2014, the first of those would likely reach the market in the autumn of 2018 at the earliest. As it is, Ford must wait until early 2019 for its first big slug of new models to hit showrooms."
General Motors,2017-5,There is not much Hackett can do about that. Any product moves he makes today would not likely show up in the market before 2021.
General Motors,2017-5,"""Ford needs to move faster,"" said RBC auto analyst Joseph Spak."
General Motors,2017-5,"Hackett, only three days into his new job, has not yet laid out his plans for Ford publicly."
General Motors,2017-5,"Ford spokesman Michael Levine side-stepped questions of a short-term product drought. ""We're bullish on our strong pipeline of all-new cars, trucks and SUVs coming in the next five years,"" he told Reuters. ""What's more, the vehicles that we are launching ... will continue to deliver high transaction prices and good business."""
General Motors,2017-5,"For much of the past decade, Ford has benefited from management and marketing problems at GM, including GM's 2009 bankruptcy and a safety scandal that hobbled the company in 2014."
General Motors,2017-5,"Now, however, Ford confronts a crosstown rival largely free of debt and focused on grabbing market share from Ford, particularly in the truck and SUV segments which account for most of both companies' profits."
General Motors,2017-5,"GM, the No. 1 U.S. automaker, is in the midst of a prolific four-year patch of new vehicle launches, many approved by Mary Barra, the company's former head of global product development who was named CEO in January 2014."
General Motors,2017-5,"In hindsight, GM benefited from its bankruptcy, as it emerged essentially debt-free and able to spend more on new products. Ford did not seek bankruptcy during last decade's auto industry crisis, and instead borrowed heavily to survive it, leaving it short on cash to invest in new vehicles."
General Motors,2017-5,"That result of that disparity is now becoming evident. A Reuters analysis shows that over the past two years GM has surpassed Ford in pretax profit per vehicle in North America. In 2016, Ford made $2,981 per vehicle, calculated by dividing pretax earnings by the number of vehicles sold, compared with $3,044 for GM. And GM plans to solidify that lead by rolling out a volley of new models aimed at the heart of Ford's lineup."
General Motors,2017-5,"GM has invested billions of dollars over the past three years to overhaul many of its best-selling truck and SUV models, including the full-size Chevrolet Suburban and Cadillac Escalade SUVs that dominate their sector and typically boast pretax margins of $20,000 or more."
General Motors,2017-5,GM also has boosted its share of the U.S. truck market with the 2014 launch of the mid-size Chevrolet Colorado and GMC Canyon pickups. Ford's rival to the Colorado - an all-new Ranger pickup - is not expected to debut until early 2019.
General Motors,2017-5,"Over the past five years, both companies have spent roughly the same - about 8 percent to 10 percent of revenue - on capital equipment, engineering, and research and development, Reuters analysis shows.

General Motors,2017-5,* But small firms worry proposed labour reforms will hurt more
General Motors,2017-5,"SEOUL, May 25 (Reuters) - Small businesses in South Korea their fear profits could be cut to the bone and some could be forced to close if the country's new president pushes ahead with plans to raise minimum wages, restrict contract staff numbers and reduce working hours."
General Motors,2017-5,"Since his election earlier this month, President Moon Jae-in has made boosting job prospects for young South Koreans a signature policy, while also protecting workers' rights."
General Motors,2017-5,"With that in mind, he has also targeted reform of South Korea's giant family-run conglomerates, or chaebol, to make them less dominant and help smaller firms become engines of growth in Asia's fourth-largest economy."
General Motors,2017-5,"Just last week, Moon's nominee to head the country's anti-trust regulator noted that South Korea's ten largest conglomerates - including household names like Samsung and Hyundai Motor Group - employ only 1 million of South Korea's 19 million actively employed workforce."
General Motors,2017-5,"""The ultimate goal of chaebol reform is to protect small companies and self-employed business owners so they can create many more new jobs,"" said Kim Sang-jo, the president's choice to head the Korea Fair Trade Commission."
General Motors,2017-5,"But many businessmen fear that instead of generating jobs, smaller businesses will be crippled by the higher cost of hiring and paying workers if Moon's labour reforms are implemented."
General Motors,2017-5,"Take for example, Sam Heung Heat Treatment, a company employing around 50 workers at a factory supplying components to automakers like Hyundai <005380.KS> and General Motors Co ."
General Motors,2017-5,Chairman Joo Bo-won told Reuters his firm could fold because of policies he says would both double the wage bill and double the number of full time workers needed to make up for the shorter working week.
General Motors,2017-5,"Asked what would happen if Moon's proposals became law, Joo gave a stark response."
General Motors,2017-5,"""It's simple: you can just shut down the factory,"" he said."
General Motors,2017-5,"Moon has pledged to raise the minimum wage by 55 percent to 10,000 won ($8.94) per hour by the end of his five-year term."
General Motors,2017-5,"At the same time, he wants to lower the maximum working week to 52 hours, bringing it down from the current cap of 68 hours, in a move that he says would help create 500,000 private sector jobs."
General Motors,2017-5,"Small businessmen, however, say Moon has got it wrong, and there will be less work as profit margins suffer."
General Motors,2017-5,"Kim Moon-sik, the president of an association of gasoline filling station owners, is a member of the labour ministry's key minimum wage committee."
General Motors,2017-5,"He warned that the proposals, as they stand, would backfire if they are applied to firms regardless of size."
General Motors,2017-5,"Kim said filling stations' profit margins average less than 0.5 percent, and if the hourly pay rate is increased so sharply it would probably force owners to run their businesses for shorter hours each day."
General Motors,2017-5,"""Instead of creating jobs, the changes could make it harder to maintain the jobs that exist now,"" said Kim, president of the Korea Oil Station Association."
General Motors,2017-5,"To try to coax the private sector to hire more, Moon has pledged the government will pay for the salary of every third youth employee hired by small companies for three years."

General Motors,2017-5,"Electric vehicles are expensive due to high battery costs, and car makers say a lack of charging stations in India could make the whole proposition unviable."
General Motors,2017-5,"The proposed policy focuses on electric vehicles, and is likely to also include plug-in hybrids. But it overlooks conventional hybrid models already sold in India, such as Toyota's Camry sedan, Honda Motor's <7267.T> Accord sedan and so-called mild hybrids built by Maruti Suzuki."
General Motors,2017-5,"Hybrids combine fossil fuel and electric power, with mild hybrids making less use of the latter."
General Motors,2017-5,"In doubling down on electric power India would be shifting away from its previous policy, announced in 2015, that supported hybrid and electric technology."
General Motors,2017-5,"That could delay investments in India, expected to be the world's third-largest passenger car market within the next decade, according to industry executives and analysts."
General Motors,2017-5,"""All these policy changes will affect future products and investments,"" said Puneet Gupta, South Asia manager at consultant IHS Markit, adding that most car makers would need to rethink product launches, especially of hybrids."
General Motors,2017-5,"Mahindra & Mahindra is the only electric car maker in India but has struggled to ramp up sales, blaming low buyer interest and insufficient infrastructure."
General Motors,2017-5,"Pawan Goenka, managing director at Mahindra said the company was working with the government and other private players to set up charging stations in India. Mahindra was also focusing on developing electric fleet cars and taxis, Goenka said."
General Motors,2017-5,"The cost of setting up a car charging station in India ranges from $500 to $25,000, depending on the charging speed, according to a 2016 report by online journal IOPscience."
General Motors,2017-5,"While the proposed policy suggests setting up battery swapping stations and using tax revenues from sales of petrol and diesel vehicles to set up charging stations, it does not specify the investment needed or whether the government would contribute."
General Motors,2017-5,"""For full electric vehicles, the economic gap remains huge and the charging infrastructure needed does not exist,"" said a spokesman at Tata Motors . The company makes electric buses and is working on developing electric and hybrid cars."
General Motors,2017-5,"Most automakers have focused on bringing in hybrid models that are seen as a stepping stone to electrification. Toyota recently launched its luxury hybrid brand Prius in India, while Hyundai Motor <005380.KS> plans to debut its Ioniq hybrid sedan next year."
General Motors,2017-5,"Maruti's parent Suzuki Motor <7269.T>, along with Toshiba <6502.T> and Denso <6902.T>, plans to invest 20 billion yen ($180 million) to set up a lithium ion battery plant in India which would support Maruti's plan to build more hybrids. [nL3N1HM1YW]"
General Motors,2017-5,"But the apparent sharp shift in policymakers' thinking in favour of electrification is forcing automakers like Toyota and Nissan Motor <7201.T> to seek more clarity before finalising future products for India, while Hyundai may delay new launches."
General Motors,2017-5,"Toyota, the world's No. 2 carmaker by sales, had planned to have a hybrid variant for all its vehicles in India, but the company's future launches would now depend on the new policy, said Shekar Viswanathan, vice chairman of its Indian subsidiary."

General Motors,2017-5,"Zhejiang Geely Holding Group, which controls Hong Kong-based Geely Automobile and Sweden's Volvo Car Group, will acquire 49 percent of Proton, the sources said. Proton also controls British sports car maker Lotus."

General Motors,2017-5,"Proton re-badges cars from foreign manufacturers to sell in the local market, but its quality has declined in recent years. The company has two Malaysian plants with an annual capacity of 400,000 cars, currently running far below maximum output."
General Motors,2017-5,An earlier attempt in 2007 to woo new partners for Proton foundered on the Malaysian government's refusal to allow foreign bidders to acquire control.

General Motors,2017-5,"NEW YORK, May 22 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Bill Ford deserves some of the blame for the eponymous carmaker's pain. The great-grandson of Model T creator Henry, he won plaudits for stepping down as chief executive in 2006 and handing the wheel to outsider Alan Mulally. But as executive chairman, he was on hand for everything that led to Monday's ouster of Mark Fields, Mulally's successor."
General Motors,2017-5,"Fields' replacement, Jim Hackett, appears only to have come into the picture on Friday, suggesting neither Bill Ford nor the board he heads had done enough succession planning. Fields, after all, had only been in the job for three years, less time than it usually takes to develop and launch a new vehicle."
General Motors,2017-5,"Part of the problem is Ford's relative dearth of the vehicles that are currently most popular in the United States. Its F-150 truck has been a best seller for decades, but the company has a more limited line-up of medium-size SUVs and trucks than GM. Sales of these are rising and come with high margins."
General Motors,2017-5,"During Mulally's time, though, Ford invested in smaller cars. That was in part to hit state and federal emissions targets and in part because they became more popular during and after the 2008 recession. Getting more trucks and SUVs back into the mix, as Fields was trying to do, takes time."
General Motors,2017-5,"Moreover, the priorities Bill Ford has set for Hackett sound like an indictment of the recent past: to sharpen execution, modernize the business, and transform the company for a future of connected and autonomous driving. If that has all been neglected, the hands-on chairman, not only the CEO, must have taken his eye off the ball."
General Motors,2017-5,"- Ford Motor on May 22 said it was replacing Chief Executive Mark Fields with Jim Hackett, the former CEO of Steelcase who has run Ford Smart Mobility since March 2016. Hackett will have three priorities: to sharpen operational execution, modernize Ford's businesses and transform the company to meet future challenges."
General Motors,2017-5,"- Shares in Ford had fallen 37 percent since Fields took over from Alan Mulally on July 1, 2014. Fields, 56, had spent 28 years at the company."

General Motors,2017-5,"Instead, VW will aim to sign players with a stronger commitment to the club and nurture youngsters, the manager said, adding that longer-term organic growth mattered more than instant success on the pitch."
General Motors,2017-5,"The new approach is backed by VW chief executive Matthias Mueller who, unlike predecessor Martin Winterkorn, is no die-hard soccer fan. Under Winterkorn, VW extended direct sponsoring and support via dealers, brands and production sites to about a dozen of Germany's 18 Bundesliga clubs."
General Motors,2017-5,"Buoyed by profit-boosting expansion of premium models, VW's Audi division took a 9 percent stake in Bayern Munich in 2011 and 19.9 percent of FC Ingolstadt, another club to be relegated to the second division.

General Motors,2017-5,"SHANGHAI, May 22 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Ford Motor's many flubs under Mark Fields were becoming existential for the $43 billion carmaker's founding family. Two weeks ago, a majority of those shareholders not named Ford voted to abolish the family's super-voting stock. The Fords took the hint, and the chief executive is now leaving. But naming a 62-year-old from the furniture trade to replace him hints at how unprepared the family was for a revolt."
General Motors,2017-5,"That Fields' job was in jeopardy was no secret. The 36 percent decline in Ford shares since he replaced Alan Mulally nearly three years ago was the mathematical manifestation of investors' discontent in his stewardship. Even General Motors only withstood a 10 percent slide, while Fiat Chrysler and Tesla both increased strongly."
General Motors,2017-5,"This sparked a last-ditch move by Fields a week ago to cut white-collar workers, potentially irritating jobs-obsessed President Donald Trump, with whom the company clashed over plans to move production of some small cars to Mexico. It backtracked on that decision, in part because of slack demand for those vehicles."
General Motors,2017-5,"- Ford Motor Chief Executive Mark Fields is set to leave the carmaker as part of a shake-up that includes other top executive changes as the company's shares hover near a 52-week low, several media reported on May 22."
General Motors,2017-5,"- Forbes and the New York Times reported James Hackett, head of the Ford unit that works on autonomous vehicles, would take the reins. An announcement could come as early as Monday."

General Motors,2017-5,* Deal smoothes way for Audi in world's No. 1 car market
General Motors,2017-5,"BEIJING, May 20 (Reuters) - Audi , a unit of Volkswagen , said on Saturday it had struck a deal with its dealers in China, effectively resolving a dispute that could have disrupted the luxury carmaker's business in the world's biggest auto market."
General Motors,2017-5,"The dispute stemmed from Audi's partnership with SAIC Motor Corp <600104.SS>, China's largest automaker, for a long-term collaboration that could include the production and distribution of Audi models in the future. [nL4N1DF2SH]"
General Motors,2017-5,"The tie-up riled Audi store operators in China, who currently sell Audi cars imported from Germany as well as Chinese-made vehicles as part of Audi's existing joint venture with China's FAW Corp [SASACJ.UL]."
General Motors,2017-5,"They said the partnership would cause current dealers to lose out to SAIC on access to key future products, hurting their sales and profitability."
General Motors,2017-5,"Audi, however, said on Saturday it had signed an agreement with China's FAW, the FAW-Volkswagen joint venture and the Audi dealer council based on ""a common understanding of how the planned cooperation between SAIC and Audi will meet the interests of all parties involved."""
General Motors,2017-5,"Under the accord, Audi models from a potential partnership with SAIC will be distributed through the carmaker's existing sales network in China."
General Motors,2017-5,"Based on a 10-year growth plan of Audi, FAW and FAW-Volkswagen, Audi will expand its portfolio of locally made and imported models in China, the statement added."
General Motors,2017-5,"A source told Reuters earlier on Saturday about the deal, which Audi board member Dietmar Voggenreiter said was a ""very constructive agreement"" and ""a strategic milestone for Audi's business in China."""
General Motors,2017-5,"""It paves the way for our two partner strategy and will allow us to further strengthen our commitment to China,"" Voggenreiter added in a statement."

General Motors,2017-5,"BEIJING, May 18 (Reuters) - General Motors Co will stop selling cars in India from the end of this year, drawing a line under two decades of battling in one of the world's most competitive markets where it has less than a one percent share of passenger car sales."
General Motors,2017-5,"The decision was announced as part of a series of restructuring actions from the Detroit automaker on Thursday, and marks a significant blow to India's strategy of encouraging domestic manufacturing. [nL2N1IJ11Q]"
General Motors,2017-5,GM says it would no longer market its Chevrolet brand - its only brand of cars marketed in India - despite India's promise as a market set to overtake Japan as the world's third largest in the next decade.
General Motors,2017-5,"""We are not giving up benefits India offers as a local cost manufacturing hub with an excellent supplier base which is extremely competitive,"" Stefan Jacoby, GM's chief of international operations, said in an interview."
General Motors,2017-5,"GM's exports from India, mainly to Mexico and Latin America, nearly doubled to 70,969 vehicles in the fiscal year than ended on March 31. The Talegaon plant has a capacity of 130,000 vehicles a year."
General Motors,2017-5,"Jacoby said the move to turn the Talegaon assembly into an export-only plant will not impact GM Korea and its position as an export hub. India will export vehicles mostly to Mexico and South America, among other destinations, while GM Korea will ship Korean-made cars to North America, Southeast Asia, Australia and Pakistan."
General Motors,2017-5,"Dan Ammann, GM's global president, said the restructuring actions for India announced on Thursday in essence cancels ""most"" of the plan GM unveiled in 2015 to invest $1 billion in India to deploy newly-designed vehicle architecture as part of a Global Emerging Market vehicle programme or GEM for short, and build a new line of low-cost vehicles in India."
General Motors,2017-5,"The decisions to significantly scale down GM's operations in India are results of months of analysis over ""where we are going to place our bets (globally) as a company,"" Ammann said in an interview."
General Motors,2017-5,"The move is the latest blow to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ""Make in India initiative,"" aimed at making the country a global manufacturing powerhouse."
General Motors,2017-5,"Last year, Ford Motor Co shelved plans to produce a new compact car family designed mainly for emerging markets. India and China had been slated to be the main manufacturing hubs for the new range that was set to begin production in 2018. [nL8N1BH1K5]"
General Motors,2017-5,"The auto sector is a major employment generator accounting for about 29 million direct and indirect jobs in India. Moreover, the $93 billion industry contributes 7.1 percent to the nation's gross domestic product and almost 50 percent of India's manufacturing output."
General Motors,2017-5,Ammann said GM looked at many options but determined that the investment originally planned for India would not deliver the kind of return other global opportunities offered.
General Motors,2017-5,"GM plans to continue to work on the $5 billion GEM programme, which GM is developing with SAIC Motor. Ammann said the programme remains on track, even without India now, to account for about 2 million vehicles a year in global sales volume, mainly in Latin America, Mexico and China."
General Motors,2017-5,"Despite being an early entrant, GM has struggled to boost its sales and market share in India in part because it has failed to launch low-cost yet feature-rich vehicles that Indian buyers prefer, according to analysts. Many of them also blame the high cost of maintaining and servicing Chevy cars for deterring cost-conscious buyers in India."
General Motors,2017-5,"GM said in 2015 it aimed to double its India market share to around 3 percent or more by 2020. But its market share fell to below 1 percent in the year ended March 31 from 1.17 percent the previous year - even as India's market grew 9 percent to climb above the 3 million vehicle level. GM's volume in India fell by a fifth to 25,823 vehicles in the year ended March 31."
General Motors,2017-5,"The GEM vehicle architecture, which is being engineered as an emerging-market platform technology for markets such as China, Brazil, Mexico and India, was envisioned to help GM come up with more cost-competitive cars. But for India, GEM was still too pricey a technology since it has been designed under GM's global vehicle safety, performance and other standards."
General Motors,2017-5,"To be successful in India, Jacoby said one option for GM was to ""give up on implementing global platform and vehicle standards"". The other was to team up with a local partner to run full operations as an automaker designing products and manufacturing and marketing products locally."
General Motors,2017-5,"""We have made the decision that these two options are not for us,"" Jacoby said."

General Motors,2017-5,"DETROIT, May 18 (Reuters) - General Motors Co plans to quit selling vehicles in India by the end of this year and will sell operations in South Africa, the latest steps in a strategy of focusing cash and engineering effort on fewer, more profitable markets."
General Motors,2017-5,"The Detroit automaker said on Thursday it will take a $500 million charge in the second quarter to restructure operations in India, Africa and Singapore. It will cancel most of a planned $1 billion investment to build a new line of low-cost vehicles in India."
General Motors,2017-5,"About $200 million of the charge will be a cash expense, GM said. The moves are expected to save $100 million a year in a sector of GM's global business that last year lost about $800 million, the company said."
General Motors,2017-5,"GM President Dan Ammann told Reuters in an interview that the latest restructuring moves - and a series of earlier decisions to quit unprofitable markets - allow GM to focus more money, engineering effort and senior management time on expanding where the company is strong, including China and the North American pickup and SUV business, where GM has a ""product onslaught coming."""
General Motors,2017-5,GM also has said it is investing about $600 million a year in efforts to develop autonomous vehicles and transportation services.
General Motors,2017-5,"GM, like its Detroit rival Ford Motor Co, has found it increasingly expensive to compete in emerging markets outside of China. GM sold just 49,000 vehicles in India and South Africa combined last year."
General Motors,2017-5,"Chief Executive Mary Barra traveled to New Delhi in 2015 to announce a plan to invest $1 billion there to build a new line of Chevrolet models developed as part of a Global Emerging Market vehicle program - GEM for short. Since then, auto sales overall in India have slumped, and GM has failed to gain traction against incumbents such as Maruti Suzuki India Ltd."
General Motors,2017-5,"Now, GM plans to stop selling Chevrolet brand vehicles by the end of the year and will produce vehicles only for export at its remaining factory in Talegaon. The company currently employs about 2,500 workers there."
General Motors,2017-5,GM said it would continue work at its design and engineering center near Bangalore.
General Motors,2017-5,"The $5 billion GEM program, which GM is developing with its Chinese partner Shanghai Automotive Industries Corp, remains on track to account for about 2 million vehicles a year in global sales volume, mainly in Latin America, Mexico and China, Ammann said."
General Motors,2017-5,"""The market opportunity for GEM has continued to grow,"" he said."
General Motors,2017-5,"In a separate move, GM plans to stop building Chevrolet vehicles in South Africa and sell its South African factory to Japan's Isuzu Motors Ltd <7202.T>, along with the 30 percent stake the U.S. automaker owns in a truck venture with Isuzu Motors <7202.T>. Isuzu agreed in February to buy out GM's 57.7 percent stake in a joint venture in Kenya."
General Motors,2017-5,"GM also will cut an undisclosed number of staff at its GM International Operations headquarters in Singapore. About 200 people work in that operation, the company said."
General Motors,2017-5,"Since Barra took over GM in 2014, the one-time largest automaker in the world has taken aggressive steps to narrow its focus to China, the highly-profitable North American light truck and sport utility market, Latin America, vehicle financing and transportation services that ultimately could use autonomous vehicles. [nL2N1GJ0H3]"
General Motors,2017-5,"Despite the restructuring moves, including Barra's decision in March to sell loss-making European operations to French rival Peugeot SA , GM's share price has been stuck in a range close around $33 where it went public in 2010 following a government-funded bankruptcy. GM shares closed on Wednesday at $32.42."
General Motors,2017-5,"Barra and GM's directors are under pressure from David Einhorn's Greenlight Capital, which wants GM to split its common stock into two classes, one that pays dividends and a second that would be valued to reflect the company's potential growth. Greenlight also has put forward a slate of three new directors. GM's management and incumbent board have rejected Greenlight's proposals. [nL4N1I6482] The hedge fund holds 54.8 million GM shares, or about 3.5 percent of the total."

General Motors,2017-5,"MEXICO CITY, May 17 (Reuters) - Companies no longer fear the North American Trade Agreement (NAFTA) will collapse and top U.S. multinationals in Mexico are committed to investing in the country going forward, the head of a global business lobby said on Wednesday."
General Motors,2017-5,"Frederic Garcia, President of Mexico's Executive Council of Global Companies (CEEG), said preparations to renegotiate NAFTA and growing awareness of the accord's economic benefits had all but put an end to fears that the deal would be scrapped."
General Motors,2017-5,"""There was a moment where the probability, or the perception that NAFTA would end, was very strong,"" Garcia said in an interview in Mexico City. ""But today I think there's an awareness that it will continue. The big worry that the deal could come to an end is an issue that's behind us."""
General Motors,2017-5,"The CEEG represents a host of multinationals in Mexico including AT&T Inc , Coca-Cola Co , General Motors Co , Microsoft Corp , Exxon Mobil Corp , Nestle, HSBC, Siemens and IBM Corp , which it says account for around 40 percent of total foreign direct investment."
General Motors,2017-5,"It and other business associations have been active in extolling the benefits of NAFTA to Americans to counter threats by U.S. President Donald Trump to dump the 23 year-old accord that binds the United States, Mexico and Canada."
General Motors,2017-5,"Mexico's Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo said on Tuesday he expected the U.S. government to notify Congress early next week of plans to rework the accord, yielding talks by late August. [nL2N1II1AT]"
General Motors,2017-5,"It was not yet clear how NAFTA would be revamped, but if Mexico's efforts to update its free trade deal with the European Union proved instructive, it could include provisions to boost corporate compliance and adherence to the law, Garcia said."
General Motors,2017-5,"Trump said last month he was ready to renegotiate NAFTA with Mexico and Canada, though since taking the presidency in January he also has maintained that the United States could withdraw from the agreement if talks did not work in favor of his homeland. [nL1N1I0047]"
General Motors,2017-5,"Arguing the accord has destroyed U.S. jobs, Trump has menaced multinationals manufacturing in Mexico with punitive tariffs, and his threats to quit NAFTA. This sent the peso to a record low in January."
General Motors,2017-5,"Earlier that month Ford abruptly canceled a $1.6 billion plant in central Mexico following verbal attacks by Trump. But as the rhetoric from the White House began to moderate, the peso has recovered somewhat, and fears for NAFTA's future have eased."
General Motors,2017-5,"Last week, a Mexican business lobby said it expected investment to drop slightly this year due to uncertainty over Trump, but Garcia said the CEEG would make no forecasts over projected outlays to avoid drawing attention to the matter."
General Motors,2017-5,"""As far as the U.S. firms in the CEEG go, from the first day of the new U.S. administration they've stated their great interest to continue operating in Mexico (and) their great interest to continue investing in Mexico,"" he said."

General Motors,2017-5,"NEW YORK, May 17 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co said on Wednesday it plans to cut 1,400 salaried jobs in North America and Asia through voluntary early retirement and other financial incentives as the No. 2 U.S. automaker looks to boost its sagging stock price."
General Motors,2017-5,Ford shares fell as much as 2.5 percent in heavy trading and were headed to their worst close since November 2012 as the broader markets tumbled over the political turmoil in Washington.
General Motors,2017-5,"The buyout offers were a fraction of the 20,000 job cuts that some news outlets had reported Ford could announce this week."
General Motors,2017-5,"Ford said the cuts would amount to about 10 percent of a group of 15,000 managers and other non-production workers and would reduce labor costs for that segment by 10 percent."
General Motors,2017-5,"The company said a large group of salaried workers would not be covered by the planned cuts, including those in product development and in the Ford Credit unit. The cuts will not apply to Ford's Europe or South America units."
General Motors,2017-5,About two-thirds of the buyout offers are in North America and the rest in Asia. Ford does not plan to cut hourly workers or production.
General Motors,2017-5,"The automaker will offer financial incentives, including generous early retirement offers, to encourage salaried employees to depart voluntarily by the end of September. Ford said it expects it will hit the targets through voluntary offers, spokesman Mike Moran said."
General Motors,2017-5,"""Reducing costs and becoming as lean and efficient as possible also remain part of that work,"" Moran said."
General Motors,2017-5,"The voluntary incentives offers will go to about 9,600 of 30,000 U.S. salaried workers, the company said."
General Motors,2017-5,"In 2016, Ford cut hundreds of white-collar jobs in Europe, reducing costs by $200 million annually."
General Motors,2017-5,"Ford continues to churn out strong profits, reporting a record $10.4 billion in pretax earnings in 2016, and expects to earn around $9 billion this year."
General Motors,2017-5,But investors are worried about slowing sales and an industry that could be dominated by autonomous vehicles and car sharing in the future.
General Motors,2017-5,"The Detroit automakers have been under pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump to add jobs in the United States, but declining U.S. sales and stalled share values are exerting a stronger force."
General Motors,2017-5,Ford said in January it was cancelling a planned Mexico plant and adding 700 jobs in Michigan.
General Motors,2017-5,Last month it announced plans to cut costs by $3 billion in 2017. Automakers are trimming expenditures as they brace for slowing auto sales.
General Motors,2017-5,"General Motors Co (GM.N) has cut more than 4,000 U.S. jobs since November, and moved to conserve capital by shedding its European operations and closing unprofitable operations in Asia."

General Motors,2017-5,"The combined scale of PSA and Opel has added impetus to negotiations with Aisin, the three sources said, helping to overcome the Japanese company's reservations."
General Motors,2017-5,"The Opel acquisition announced in March, which valued the General Motors business at 2.2 billion euros ($2.44 billion), brings ""a larger sales volume and therefore more profitability for an investment"", one source said."
General Motors,2017-5,"PSA currently buys six- and eight-speed Aisin gearboxes made in Japan and China for its Peugeot, Citroen and DS brands. Assembling the six-speed in France would secure a competitive supply, reduce currency risk and help fill its own plants."
General Motors,2017-5,"For Aisin, 34 percent-owned by Toyota and affiliates, it would establish a first European production base amid growing demand for automatic gearboxes, which currently equip about one in five PSA cars sold."
General Motors,2017-5,"Automatics are less popular in Europe than in the United States, but their growth is set to accelerate with tighter emissions rules and demand for electric, hybrid and increasingly automated cars, to which manual gearboxes are unsuited."
General Motors,2017-5,"PSA and Aisin both declined to comment, but Aisin has previously signalled an openness to partnerships."
General Motors,2017-5,"""We're absolutely not averse to joint programmes with non-Toyota companies,"" President Yasumori Ihara said in January, the same month that PSA Chief Executive Carlos Tavares told workers at his company's Metz transmissions plant that an unspecified production deal was under consideration."
General Motors,2017-5,"But the proposal had made little headway until the tie-up with Opel, the sources said. An agreement could now be finalised within months, subject to successful closing of the Opel acquisition later in the year, and PSA managers may discuss the plans with unions in works council meetings next month."
General Motors,2017-5,PSA plans to redevelop future Opels with its own technology - as three models already have been under an earlier partnership - boosting purchasing clout and economies of scale. [nL5N1GJ0LA]

General Motors,2017-5,"WASHINGTON/DETROIT, May 16 (Reuters) - Investors on Tuesday shrugged off media reports that Ford Motor Co will announce plans to cut thousands of white-collar workers, highlighting the challenges facing Chief Executive Mark Fields."
General Motors,2017-5,"Fields, whose nearly three years at the helm have been marked by a languishing share price, is expected to announce as early as this week Ford plans to cut about 10 percent of its salaried workforce in North America and Asia. Ford does not plan any cuts to its hourly workforce or production capacity, people familiar with the company's plan said."
General Motors,2017-5,"Ford plans to offer financial incentives to convince salaried employees to depart voluntarily, including generous early retirement offers, a person briefed on the plan said."
General Motors,2017-5,"In 2016, Ford cut hundreds of white-collar jobs in Europe to cut costs by $200 million annually."
General Motors,2017-5,"Ford shares were down 0.13 percent in late afternoon trading, and are down nearly 40 percent since Fields took over as CEO in July 2014."
General Motors,2017-5,"The focus of the cost-cutting effort is on North America and Asia, people familiar with the plans said. Ford has about 30,000 salaried U.S. employees, a company spokesman said."
General Motors,2017-5,"Ford declined to confirm or deny the planned cuts, but said it was working toward ""reducing costs and becoming as lean and efficient as possible... We have not announced any new people efficiency actions."""
General Motors,2017-5,"The Detroit automakers are under pressure from President Donald Trump to add jobs in the United States, but declining U.S. sales and stalled share values are exerting a stronger force. [nL2N1II0UZ]"
General Motors,2017-5,Ford said in January it was cancelling a planned Mexico plant and adding 700 jobs in Michigan.
General Motors,2017-5,"Ford said last month it plans to cut costs by $3 billion in 2017, despite commodity prices rising by $1 billion."
General Motors,2017-5,"On Friday, Fields held an investor lunch in Boston. UBS analyst Colin Langan said in a research note that it remains ""bullish"" on Ford, noting its stock is priced at seven times earnings per share, lower than the long term average of 9 times earnings."
General Motors,2017-5,"""Fields was extremely candid about the market challenges including slowing U.S. sales, pricing pressure and rising commodities,"" UBS said in a research note Monday."
General Motors,2017-5,U.S. automakers are trimming costs as they brace for slowing auto sales.

General Motors,2017-5,"General Motors and Toyota <7203.T> have already been on the receiving end of Trump's micromanagement of companies by bullying them on Twitter , as have employers in other industries. Ford, meanwhile, was a punching bag during the election campaign. All three came under fire for producing cars in Mexico to be sold in the United States."
General Motors,2017-5,"Fields' latest move, assuming job cuts happen, risks reawakening Trump's campaign ire. But it's logical. First, it's part of a broader plan to trim $3 billion of annual costs. With the profitable U.S. market starting to slow, acting now rather than waiting for a more painful downturn makes sense. And second, Ford's shareholders have endured a drop of more than third in the stock since Fields took over almost three years ago, so they are looking for action that boosts profitability."
General Motors,2017-5,"Whacking Fields alone for the share price decline would be unfair. At 6.7 times next year's estimated earnings, Ford trades at a decent premium to the roughly 5.5 times earnings sported by local rivals General Motors and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles . Still, the CEO needs to be seen to be driving Ford forward. Trump's tweets can stir up a bad publicity for a few days, but shareholders deserve a longer-term perspective."
General Motors,2017-5,"- Ford Motor is planning to cut its salaried workforce in North America and Asia by around 10 percent, Reuters reported on May 15 citing a person familiar with the matter. The company plans to offer generous early retirement incentives to persuade people to leave by Oct. 1 but has no plans to lay off any of its hourly workforce or reduce vehicle production."

General Motors,2017-5,"ORWELL, Ohio, May 12 (Reuters) - Three years ago if a customer walked onto Dan Reel's used car lot seeking a late-model off-lease Ford Escape, his answer was short: tough luck."
General Motors,2017-5,The supply of lightly-used cars and trucks was tight because automakers had drastically cut back on bargain leases during and after the Great Recession.
General Motors,2017-5,"Recently, though, a computer search for available used vehicles within 150 miles of Reel revealed an eye-popping figure: 668 Escapes. That's enough to put more than 40 percent of the inhabitants of this small northeastern Ohio town, population 1,600, into the popular crossover."
General Motors,2017-5,"""The automakers have flooded the market,"" said Reel, owner of Reel's Auto in Orwell, Ohio, about 40 miles east of Cleveland."
General Motors,2017-5,"That deluge is good news for used-car dealers, auto auction houses and car buyers, who stand to benefit from a bountiful supply of high quality, off-lease vehicles rolling into the U.S. market."
General Motors,2017-5,"By the end of 2019, an estimated 12 million low-mileage vehicles are coming off leases inked during a 2014-2016 spurt in new auto sales, according to estimates by Atlanta-based auto auction firm Manheim and Reuters."
General Motors,2017-5,"That's helping independent dealers such as Reel, who can turn a quick profit on vehicles bought cheaply from auction companies."
General Motors,2017-5,Big players like AutoNation also aim to benefit from selling late-model vehicles at a discount versus brand new cars.
General Motors,2017-5,"Chief Executive Mike Jackson said rising off-lease car numbers means ""a higher supply of pre-owned vehicles at a more attractive price."""
General Motors,2017-5,"Consumers seeking great deals are in luck. Used-vehicle prices at auction fell about 3 percent last year, according to Carmel, Indiana-based KAR Auction Services Inc , which facilitated the sale of 5.1 million used and salvaged vehicles in 2016. Used prices should drop around 3 percent annually for the next couple of years, according to KAR's chief economist Tom Kontos."
General Motors,2017-5,"General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co say prices for its used vehicles, which consist largely of nearly-new ones coming off lease to consumers, fell 7 percent in the first quarter versus the same period in 2016. GM says it expects a 7 percent decline for 2017 compared to last year."
General Motors,2017-5,"While many used-car dealers and their customers are spoiled for choice, the glut bodes ill for GM, Ford and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV and is one reason the Detroit Three's share prices are stuck in neutral."
General Motors,2017-5,"Demand for new vehicles is slowing after seven consecutive years of rising sales.[nL1N1I40OF] Meanwhile, carmakers' discounts on new vehicles have surpassed record levels set during the Great Recession. Those discounts have been averaging over 10 percent of a new vehicle's average selling price, according to industry consultants J.D. Power and LMC Automotive."
General Motors,2017-5,"Slumping prices also hurt automakers' in-house lenders. They price leases using a car's ""residual value"" - an estimate of the vehicle's worth after its lease ends. If that value is lower than expected when the vehicle is resold, profits suffer."
General Motors,2017-5,"That risk was highlighted last November when Ford lowered its financial service arm's pretax profit forecast by $300 million, citing falling resale values for off-lease vehicles. [nL1N1DI1K5]"
General Motors,2017-5,"Still, carmakers show no sign of abandoning leasing. In the first quarter, leases made up 31.06 percent of sales to consumers, just below the record set in the second quarter of 2016 of 31.44 percent, according to data from Experian."
General Motors,2017-5,"Wall Street is worried carmakers are repeating past mistakes. Shares of GM and Ford barely budged last month after their earnings both beat analyst expectations. [nL1NI00IG]But when the companies reported disappointing April sales last week, GM's shares fell 3 percent and Ford's 4 percent. [nL1N1I40OF]"
General Motors,2017-5,"In late April, GM chief financial officer Chuck Stevens said off-lease vehicles were ""an issue,"" but insisted that ""overall the used-car market is absorbing that supply."""
General Motors,2017-5,KAR CEO Jim Hallett said there's now an oversupply of off-lease vehicles.
General Motors,2017-5,"""The flood of lease cars puts a lot of pressure on automakers and their dealers to get new cars sold,"" he said."
General Motors,2017-5,"In a market teeming with product, attention is now on auction sites, a critical link in the used-car food chain. The U.S. trade is dominated by Manheim and Adesa, a unit of KAR. These companies re-sell cars and trucks returned to automakers from rental car companies and consumer leases."
General Motors,2017-5,Franchise dealerships get first dibs on inventory. The leftovers are available to independent dealers through online and live auctions.
General Motors,2017-5,"KAR's Hallett says the company makes money on the volume of cars sold, so rising supply boosts business. Manufacturers are also using more of KAR's ancillary repair and finishing services to make vehicles look as good as possible for sale, he said."
General Motors,2017-5,Supply is currently so swollen Adesa now offers used dealers a guarantee: they can return any car they buy online within 30 days if it doesn't sell and only end up $50 out of pocket.
General Motors,2017-5,"Used-car dealers are also tweaking their strategies for a glutted market. Reel, the Ohio dealer, hunts for unique vehicles that can command a slight premium."
General Motors,2017-5,"Joe Mok, general manager of Gmotorcars in Chicago, doesn't care about unicorns. His strategy is to sell cheap. He recently bought 15 virtually identical 2015 Ford Fiestas for $6,900 and sold them for $7,600."
General Motors,2017-5,"""What's going to make somebody come to my store if we all have the same color Toyota Camry with the same miles?"" said Mok, who owns two dealerships. ""They'll come to me because of the price."""
General Motors,2017-5,"With used-car prices falling, the pressure is on dealers to sell vehicles fast before they lose value."
General Motors,2017-5,"Rather than keep too much inventory on his lot, Reel entices customers with the prospect of almost unlimited choice on the auction sites."

General Motors,2017-5,"That's helping independent dealers such as Reel, who can turn a quick profit on vehicles bought cheaply from auction companies."
General Motors,2017-5,Big players like AutoNation also aim to benefit from selling late-model vehicles at a discount versus brand new cars.
General Motors,2017-5,"Chief Executive Mike Jackson said rising off-lease car numbers means ""a higher supply of pre-owned vehicles at a more attractive price."""
General Motors,2017-5,"Consumers seeking great deals are in luck. Used-vehicle prices at auction fell about 3 percent last year, according to Carmel, Indiana-based KAR Auction Services Inc , which facilitated the sale of 5.1 million used and salvaged vehicles in 2016. Used prices should drop around 3 percent annually for the next couple of years, according to KAR's chief economist Tom Kontos."
General Motors,2017-5,"General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co say prices for its used vehicles, which consist largely of nearly-new ones coming off lease to consumers, fell 7 percent in the first quarter versus the same period in 2016. GM says it expects a 7 percent decline for 2017 compared to last year."
General Motors,2017-5,"While many used-car dealers and their customers are spoiled for choice, the glut bodes ill for GM, Ford and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV and is one reason the Detroit Three's share prices are stuck in neutral."
General Motors,2017-5,"Demand for new vehicles is slowing after seven consecutive years of rising sales.[nL1N1I40OF] Meanwhile, carmakers' discounts on new vehicles have surpassed record levels set during the Great Recession. Those discounts have been averaging over 10 percent of a new vehicle's average selling price, according to industry consultants J.D. Power and LMC Automotive."
General Motors,2017-5,"Slumping prices also hurt automakers' in-house lenders. They price leases using a car's ""residual value"" - an estimate of the vehicle's worth after its lease ends. If that value is lower than expected when the vehicle is resold, profits suffer."
General Motors,2017-5,"That risk was highlighted last November when Ford lowered its financial service arm's pretax profit forecast by $300 million, citing falling resale values for off-lease vehicles. [nL1N1DI1K5]"
General Motors,2017-5,"Still, carmakers show no sign of abandoning leasing. In the first quarter, leases made up 31.06 percent of sales to consumers, just below the record set in the second quarter of 2016 of 31.44 percent, according to data from Experian."
General Motors,2017-5,"Wall Street is worried carmakers are repeating past mistakes. Shares of GM and Ford barely budged last month after their earnings both beat analyst expectations. [nL1NI00IG]But when the companies reported disappointing April sales last week, GM's shares fell 3 percent and Ford's 4 percent. [nL1N1I40OF]"
General Motors,2017-5,"In late April, GM chief financial officer Chuck Stevens said off-lease vehicles were ""an issue,"" but insisted that ""overall the used-car market is absorbing that supply."""
General Motors,2017-5,KAR CEO Jim Hallett said there's now an oversupply of off-lease vehicles.
General Motors,2017-5,"""The flood of lease cars puts a lot of pressure on automakers and their dealers to get new cars sold,"" he said."
General Motors,2017-5,"In a market teeming with product, attention is now on auction sites, a critical link in the used-car food chain. The U.S. trade is dominated by Manheim and Adesa, a unit of KAR. These companies re-sell cars and trucks returned to automakers from rental car companies and consumer leases."
General Motors,2017-5,Franchise dealerships get first dibs on inventory. The leftovers are available to independent dealers through online and live auctions.
General Motors,2017-5,"KAR's Hallett says the company makes money on the volume of cars sold, so rising supply boosts business. Manufacturers are also using more of KAR's ancillary repair and finishing services to make vehicles look as good as possible for sale, he said."
General Motors,2017-5,Supply is currently so swollen Adesa now offers used dealers a guarantee: they can return any car they buy online within 30 days if it doesn't sell and only end up $50 out of pocket.
General Motors,2017-5,"Used-car dealers are also tweaking their strategies for a glutted market. Reel, the Ohio dealer, hunts for unique vehicles that can command a slight premium."
General Motors,2017-5,"Joe Mok, general manager of Gmotorcars in Chicago, doesn't care about unicorns. His strategy is to sell cheap. He recently bought 15 virtually identical 2015 Ford Fiestas for $6,900 and sold them for $7,600."
General Motors,2017-5,"""What's going to make somebody come to my store if we all have the same color Toyota Camry with the same miles?"" said Mok, who owns two dealerships. ""They'll come to me because of the price."""
General Motors,2017-5,"With used-car prices falling, the pressure is on dealers to sell vehicles fast before they lose value."
General Motors,2017-5,"Rather than keep too much inventory on his lot, Reel entices customers with the prospect of almost unlimited choice on the auction sites."
General Motors,2017-5,"""I can get almost any off-lease car a customer wants within 48 hours,"" he said. ""The only question is: 'What color do you want?'"""

General Motors,2017-5,"NEW DELHI, May 8 (Reuters) - India's most influential government think-tank has recommended lowering taxes and interest rates for loans on electric vehicles, while capping sales of conventional cars, signalling a dramatic shift in policy in one of the world's fastest growing auto markets."

General Motors,2017-5,"May 4 (Reuters) - Greenlight Capital escalated its battle against General Motors Co on Thursday, posting credit ratings documents that it said the automaker inappropriately changed to undermine the hedge fund's proposal to create two classes of GM stock."
General Motors,2017-5,"Greenlight, which owns 3.6 percent of GM shares, has said its dual share plan would boost GM's value by creating a dividend class and a regular stock class known as capital appreciation shares."
General Motors,2017-5,"In its proxy statement last month, Greenlight said GM substantially altered the plan's term sheet before it was presented to credit rating agencies, a move the hedge fund said was meant to turn the agencies against the structure."
General Motors,2017-5,"""Our plan does not have cumulative dividends,"" Greenlight said in one of the annotations - pointing out a key sticking point in the debate over the plan. In another annotation, Greenlight highlighted a change from the original and said GM invented a term to misrepresent its plan."
General Motors,2017-5,"Greenlight, run by David Einhorn, argued that the dividend shares function as common equity and should not be treated as debt."
General Motors,2017-5,"GM has said that because Greenlight's plan calls for the dividends on the dividend shares to be received ahead of capital appreciation share distributions, the structure is cumulative by definition. According to GM's interpretation, that means any dividends that accumulate in periods where there is no payout must be paid ahead of any distributions, including share repurchases."
General Motors,2017-5,"Ratings agencies have sided with the company in ruling that the dividend class functions like a debt security, which could affect GM's credit rating. [nL3N1H54NI]"

General Motors,2017-5,"LONDON, May 4 (Reuters) - British new car registrations slumped by 20 percent in April, the biggest year-on-year drop for over six years after record demand in March, when customers brought forward purchases to avoid a tax increase, an industry body said on Thursday."
General Motors,2017-5,"Sales fell 19.8 percent to 152,076 vehicles last month, traditionally a period when fewer vehicles are sold after a new licence plate series is issued in March, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said."
General Motors,2017-5,Demand in March was at a record high as individuals and businesses in Europe's second biggest autos market sought to avoid paying an increase in excise duty that came into force from April 1 for the most polluting vehicles.
General Motors,2017-5,"Registrations so far this year are up 1.1 percent, despite forecasts that demand would fall by at least 5 percent this year due to the uncertainties around Brexit and after consecutive record performances."
General Motors,2017-5,"Following an 8.4 percent rise in March and a slump in April, also hit by fewer selling days due to Easter, the SMMT said it foresaw less erratic swings in the months ahead."
General Motors,2017-5,"""We ... expect demand to stabilise over the year as the turbulence created by these tax changes decreases,"" SMMT Chief Executive Mike Hawes said."
General Motors,2017-5,"But the industry faces a number of challenges ahead including new levies and tighter rules on the most polluting vehicles, which appear to be already dampening demand for diesel vehicles. [nL5N1HC1HL]"

General Motors,2017-5,"SAN FRANCISCO, May 3 (Reuters) - Electric-car maker Tesla Inc on Wednesday reported first-quarter revenue that more than doubled, and while saying the upcoming Model 3 was on schedule for July, it downplayed the mass-market vehicle to give a sales pitch for its more expensive Model S."
General Motors,2017-5,"Chief Executive Elon Musk's bold approach to cars, space exploration and clean energy has fueled investor enthusiasm for Tesla. But skeptics are waiting to see if Musk can fulfill his promise of producing 500,000 cars per year in 2018, or six times Tesla's 2016 production."
General Motors,2017-5,Shares were down about 2 percent in after-hours trade following the results.
General Motors,2017-5,The automaker's comments underscored the additional challenge of keeping up demand for its older models.
General Motors,2017-5,"""We have seen some impact of Model S orders as a function of people being confused"" that Model 3 is the upgrade to Model S, Musk said on a conference call."
General Motors,2017-5,Tesla said it had $4 billion of cash on hand as it headed into the second quarter and expects year-to-date capital expenditures to be slightly over $2 billion by the time it starts Model 3 production - within its previous targeted range of $2 billion to $2.5 billion.
General Motors,2017-5,"That cushion should give the company some near-term breathing room from needing to tap Wall Street for cash, said CFRA Research analyst Efraim Levy. Tesla in March raised $1.2 billion from the markets."
General Motors,2017-5,"Record deliveries helped Tesla boost its revenue to $2.7 billion in the quarter, but a net loss net widened to $330.3 million from $282.3 million a year earlier, largely driven by its SolarCity acquisition."
General Motors,2017-5,"Tesla has much riding on the Model 3, which could finally make the cash-hemorrhaging automaker profitable. But while much of the company hype has focused on the car due in July, Tesla on Wednesday made a sales pitch for its overshadowed Model S."
General Motors,2017-5,"Tesla is anxious that the $35,000 Model 3 - which will likely not be delivered in volume until 2018 - avoids cannibalizing the higher-margin Model S, which lists at about double the starting price."
General Motors,2017-5,"In its earnings release, Tesla stated that a key challenge for the company would be to eliminate misperceptions about the differences between the Model S and the Model 3."
General Motors,2017-5,"""We want to be super clear that Model 3 is not version three of our car. Model 3 is essentially a smaller, more affordable version of the Model S with fewer features,"" Musk said on a conference call, adding buyers erroneously thought the Model 3 would be more advanced."
General Motors,2017-5,"""The Model S will be better than Model 3,"" he added. ""As it should be, as it's a more expensive car."""
General Motors,2017-5,"Tesla needs to ramp up for a deluge of Model 3 customers, and the company said it would be adding nearly 100 retail, delivery and service locations worldwide, representing a 30 percent increase. Tesla also said it was also working to improve efficiency, citing vehicle repair times that have fallen by 35 percent due to the use of remote diagnostics."
General Motors,2017-5,"The company reiterated its forecast of delivering 47,000-50,000 Model S and Model X cars in the first half of 2017, a target it announced earlier this year."
General Motors,2017-5,"Still, customer deposits fell 7 percent in the quarter, which could suggest interest in Tesla's current product line, the Model S and Model X, is decreasing."
General Motors,2017-5,"On a per-share basis, Tesla's net loss narrowed to $2.04 from $2.13."

General Motors,2017-5,"DETROIT, May 3 (Reuters) - Automotive supplier Delphi Automotive Plc on Wednesday said it plans to spin off operations tied to internal combustion engines and focus on technology for electrically powered and self-driving vehicles, boosting its share price and highlighting the challenges for legacy auto industry players."
General Motors,2017-5,"Vehicles driven by humans and powered with petroleum will dominate roads from Shanghai to San Francisco for years to come, but investors who supply the capital to produce such vehicles are signaling a belief that after a century-long run, internal combustion cars are a sunset industry."
General Motors,2017-5,"The most dramatic symbol of this turn is electric luxury car maker Tesla Inc's ascent this year to a higher market capitalization than either Ford Motor Co or General Motors Co . Despite a recent slump in U.S. sales, the Detroit giants are robustly profitable, while Tesla has yet to earn a full year profit. Tesla reports first-quarter results later Wednesday."
General Motors,2017-5,"Delphi shares rose as much as 12 percent on Wednesday after the company announced its plan to separate into two entities - one dedicated to internal combustion technology and the other focused on electrification and automation. The shares closed at $87.01, up nearly 11 percent, representing about $2 billion in added market value."
General Motors,2017-5,"""There's a whole element of the componentry of the car that Wall Street values at a lower level,"" Delphi Chief Executive Officer Kevin Clark told Reuters in an interview on Wednesday."
General Motors,2017-5,Other big auto suppliers are making similar calls. German auto supplier Robert Bosch GmbH [ROBG.UL] earlier this week said it had sold its starters and alternators business to a Chinese mining company. [nL4N1I42Y1]
General Motors,2017-5,"Germany's Rheinmetall also tried to float its Kolbenschmidt Pierburg unit, which is specialized in the development, manufacture and aftermarket supply of pistons, engine blocks, and plain bearings back in 2012. However, it was forced to call off the IPO due to a market slump and a lack of investor enthusiasm for a stock with heavy exposure to combustion engine technology, bankers said."
General Motors,2017-5,"Combustion engines are taking a hit from regulators, particularly those in Europe and China, who want to slash greenhouse gas and smog forming emissions on a fast timetable. That risk was exacerbated by Volkswagen's diesel emissions scandal. As a result of ""Dieselgate,"" politicians in cities like Stuttgart have discussed banning diesel vehicles from the inner city, leading customers to abandon diesel cars."
General Motors,2017-5,"On Wednesday, German car registration figures provided by Germany's KBA federal motor authority, showed that demand for diesel engine vehicles plunged by 19.3 percent in April, to a market share of 41.3 percent of overall registrations.[nL8N1I532M]"
General Motors,2017-5,Delphi's Clark said he expects diesel production to decline by about 3 percent a year for the next few years.
General Motors,2017-5,China's government has also set aggressive targets for electric vehicles that are forcing carmakers to accelerate electric vehicle plans. [nL3N1GQ4AT]
General Motors,2017-5,"U.S. auto supplier Visteon , like Delphi, has shed most of its traditional car parts making operations, and is focused on connected vehicle technology and infotainment."
General Motors,2017-5,"Clark said Delphi's powertrain business, which has about $4.5 billion in annual revenues and does not yet have a name, has room to grow. The company will have more freedom to invest in that growth as its managers no longer have to compete for capital with opportunities presented by the increasing computerization of cars, Clark said."
General Motors,2017-5,"The powertrain company, which accounted for about 27 percent of Delphi revenues last year, also could seize opportunities to consolidate other players in the legacy market, capitalizing on the continued demand for internal combustion and the regulatory pressure to make them cleaner, a person familiar with Delphi's strategy said."
General Motors,2017-5,"Analysts on Wednesday estimated Delphi's powertrain business will be valued at six to seven times earnings before interest and taxes, while the electronic and autonomous technology side of the company will likely command a higher valuation."
General Motors,2017-5,"The electronic Delphi - which also could get a new name - will compete in a potential market the company estimates at more than $100 billion a year, nearly twice the size of the internal combustion market. Delphi said its electronic systems units had about $12 billion in revenue last year."
General Motors,2017-5,"Delphi ""is best positioned to be the 'picks and shovels' supplier of big data solutions"" to automakers, Barclays analyst Brian Johnson wrote in a note on Wednesday."
General Motors,2017-5,"But the market of the future is still largely in the future. Most established car makers, for instance, have not adopted over the air software upgrades on a mass scale, and depend entirely on internal combustion engine cars and sport utilities for profits."
General Motors,2017-5,"Clark said over the next three to five years demand will accelerate for high speed in-vehicle data networking systems, autonomous driving technology and over the air software updates. Delphi has acquired a company that enables over the air software updates, as well as a company that develops high speed data networks. Clark said Delphi could make more acquisitions to expand its electronic systems capability, or forge more partnerships."
General Motors,2017-5,"Delphi has partnerships through its autonomous vehicle business with Intel Corp and Israeli autonomous vehicle technology firm Mobileye , which is being bought by Intel for $15.3 billion."
General Motors,2017-5,"""If we can do more things like that"" the Mobileye-Intel partnership, ""that would be great,"" Clark said."
General Motors,2017-5,Delphi is betting that many automakers will ultimately opt to buy a standard system rather than invest in one-of-a-kind systems of their own. Delphi said it expects to launch its turnkey autonomous driving system with a customer in 2019.
General Motors,2017-5,"The spinoff will be tax free and is expected to be completed by March 2018, Delphi said."

General Motors,2017-5,"NEW YORK, May 3 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Delphi is going where carmakers can only dream of driving. The $23 billion parts maker is spinning off its powertrain unit to focus on connected and autonomous vehicle technology. These fast-growing, higher-margin businesses will sport a top-tier multiple even if car sales slow. The likes of Ford and General Motors don't have the luxury of following Delphi's lead."
General Motors,2017-5,"Like other suppliers, Delphi Automotive already trades at a premium to its customers. Before announcing its breakup plan on Wednesday, the company, headquartered in Gillingham, England, commanded a multiple of 12 times this year's estimated earnings. Only Toyota <7203.T> of the major carmakers makes it into double digits, but still falls shy."
General Motors,2017-5,"The lofty valuation is a consequence of running businesses with better margins. Ford and GM, for example, are hitting the ball out of the park if their pre-tax margin reaches 7 percent. Delphi's was 9.4 percent in the first quarter and may exceed 12.5 percent for the rest of the year, according to analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters."
General Motors,2017-5,"In outlining the split on Wednesday, Delphi boss Kevin Clark played up the increased focus each of the two new management teams would have as separate companies more than the immediate benefit to shareholders. Even so, investors added nearly a tenth to Delphi's value, raising its multiple above 13 times earnings."
General Motors,2017-5,"- Delphi Automotive on May 3 said it is planning to spin off its powertrain business. The move will leave the parent company with two businesses focused on advanced connectivity, autonomy and mobility: electrical/electronic architecture; and electronics and safety."
General Motors,2017-5,"- The business to be spun off to shareholders, which will be named Powertrain, accounted for $4.5 billion of the company's revenue in 2016 and sported an adjusted operating margin of 11.5 percent and an adjusted EBITDA margin of 15.7 percent."
General Motors,2017-5,"- The top line for the advanced connectivity, autonomy and mobility businesses last year was $12 billion, with an adjusted operating margin of 13.6 percent and an adjusted EBITDA margin of 17.6 percent."
