Ford Motor,2017-12,"BEIJING/SHANGHAI, Dec 27 (Reuters) - China will extend a tax rebate on purchases of so-called new-energy vehicles (NEV) until the end of 2020, a boost for hybrid and electric car makers amid a shift by policy-makers away from the traditional internal combustion engine."
Ford Motor,2017-12,"The finance ministry said in a statement on Wednesday the tax exemption, which was set to expire at the end of this year, will run from Jan. 1, 2018 until Dec. 31, 2020 for electric, plug-in petrol-electric hybrid and fuel-cell powered vehicles."
Ford Motor,2017-12,The extension comes as automakers in China brace to meet strict NEV quotas starting in 2019 that are sparking a flurry of electric car deals and new launches of electric and hybrid models.
Ford Motor,2017-12,"Amid the shift, some global automakers have called on China to maintain financial support for the market, citing concerns consumer demand alone will not be sufficient to drive sales without state-backed incentive schemes to lure buyers."
Ford Motor,2017-12,"The Ministry of Finance said the extension would help ""increase support for innovation and development in new energy vehicles"", an area where China is hoping it can catch up - and even overtake - more established global automaker rivals."

Ford Motor,2017-12,"WASHINGTON, Dec 15 (Reuters) - A compromise Republican tax bill released late Friday does not eliminate a $7,500 electric vehicle tax credit as Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives had previously proposed."
Ford Motor,2017-12,"The measure follows the lead of the Senate version approved last month that did not eliminate the credit. Killing the credit could have hurt automakers like General Motors Co , Volkswagen AG , Tesla Inc and Nissan Motor Co <7201.T>."
Ford Motor,2017-12,"Consumers under current law are eligible for a $7,500 tax credit to defray the cost of plug-in electric vehicles.

Ford Motor,2017-12,"Consumers are currently allowed to take the credit on vehicles until the manufacturer hits 200,000 plug-in vehicles sold. Electric vehicles have expensive batteries that make them pricier than gasoline-powered vehicles."
Ford Motor,2017-12,"The Electric Drive Transportation Association said in a statement late Friday it was pleased the credit would remain in law. ""The credit supports innovation and job creation while helping drivers access advanced vehicle technology,"" the group said."

Ford Motor,2017-12,"BEIJING, Dec 6 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co is expected to sign as early as Thursday a deal with Alibaba Group Holding Ltd which may allow the U.S. automaker to test selling cars to consumers in China through Alibaba's online retail arm Tmall, as well as via a new ""auto vending machine"" store concept, according to a Ford source familiar with the matter."
Ford Motor,2017-12,"Representatives of Ford and Alibaba, including Ford Executive Chairman Bill Ford Jr. and Ford CEO Jim Hackett, are expected to be in Hangzhou on Thursday to sign a letter of intent that outlines the scope of the new partnership."
Ford Motor,2017-12,"According to the source, who did not want to be named because he is not authorized to speak with reporters, the deal is intended to position the Dearborn, Michigan, automaker for an emerging Chinese marketplace where more cars could be sold online."
Ford Motor,2017-12,The partnership would be part of Ford's effort to overhaul its China strategy to revive the growth momentum it has lost in recent months.
Ford Motor,2017-12,"Ford's global chief spokesman Mark Truby said the company is expected to make an announcement on Thursday in Hangzhou, where Alibaba is based, but declined to comment in advance."
Ford Motor,2017-12,The source said the proposal could mean that cars purchased online are delivered to buyers by franchised Ford retail stores and would be maintained and repaired by them.
Ford Motor,2017-12,"According to Alibaba, consumers can use their phones to browse through the cars garaged in the store and choose to either immediately buy one or test drive it. The vehicle would be delivered to them on the ground floor."
Ford Motor,2017-12,"The model allows shoppers with good credit to purchase their new ride with a 10 percent down payment and then make monthly payments for the car purchase through Alibaba's affiliate Alipay, according to Alibaba."
Ford Motor,2017-12,"Ford believes dealers would likely agree to this direct retailing model because they still get to service cars sold through Tmall, the Ford source said."
Ford Motor,2017-12,"The move, though, could be potentially problematic for dealers, some industry experts said."
Ford Motor,2017-12,"""When online sales and direct sales volume was small that's one thing. But if this format gained steam, it would definitely impact dealers,"" according to Yale Zhang, head of Shanghai-based consultancy Automotive Foresight. ""Retail innovation is great, but it is by its nature disruptive and can't keep everybody happy."""
Ford Motor,2017-12,The danger is that the dealers lose out not only on a lot of car sales but also the potentially lucrative auto financing aspect of their traditional business.
Ford Motor,2017-12,"Direct selling by auto brands is not always possible in many markets around the world. In the United States, for example, because of franchise auto dealer operators' political clout, except for a small number of states, direct selling is largely not possible."
Ford Motor,2017-12,"The source said Ford is ""behind in using big data"" to monitor sales trends and effectively market its cars and the move to online sales as well as the access to Tmall's massive database of information on consumers would help it to catch up."
Ford Motor,2017-12,"Online auto sales volumes are currently limited in China because car buyers want to be able to see, touch and drive cars before buying them, said Zhang. The ability to test drive a car ordered online could change that."
Ford Motor,2017-12,"Ford's China sales have been sluggish in recent months in part because it has failed to catch on to rapidly changing trends in the marketplace, including the rise of entry-level cars popular in smaller and less-well-known cities, where demand is booming."
Ford Motor,2017-12,"Ford's sales in the first 10 months of this year were 938,570, a decline of 5 percent from the same period in 2016, against a 2.2 percent gains to 3.13 million for hometown rival General Motors ."

General Motors Co was at 12.9 percent and Ford Motor Co was at 14.6 percent."
Ford Motor,2017-12,Nissan was well above the rest with an average discount of 18.6 percent.

Ford Motor,2017-12,"GM's Marketplace technology, developed in collaboration with International Business Machines will be uploaded automatically to about 1.9 million model-year 2017 and later vehicles starting immediately, with about 4 million vehicles across the Chevrolet, Buick, GMC and Cadillac brands equipped with the capability in the United States by the end of 2018, GM said."
