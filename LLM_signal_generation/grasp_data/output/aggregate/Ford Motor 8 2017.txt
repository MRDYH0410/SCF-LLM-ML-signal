Ford Motor,2017-8,ANALYSIS-Mining's new normal: Tackling growth in the shadow of austerity - Reuters News
Ford Motor,2017-8,"{{20170831T104713.191+0000}}ANALYSIS-Mining's new normal: Tackling growth in the shadow of austerity* BHP, Rio Tinto, Glencore back from commodities crash"
Ford Motor,2017-8,"* But investors eye payouts, debt cuts, safety - all at once"
Ford Motor,2017-8,"SYDNEY/LONDON, Aug 31 (Reuters) - Global mining heads may have thought they'd seen it all in the last five years, navigating a recovery after a commodities boom turned to bust. As the cycle turns, it brings a new challenge: tackling growth in an industry still scarred by its excesses."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"It comes just in time for Ken MacKenzie, who starts as chairman of BHP , the world's biggest miner, on Sept. 1. Like peers Rio Tinto and Glencore , BHP has just racked up its best profit and cash flow in years on rising global demand for staples likes iron ore and coal. [nL4N1L75D4]"
Ford Motor,2017-8,"But this time, amid the cash piles, investors are reminding miners of messy mega-deals that cost previous executives their jobs. With activists like Elliott Management in their ranks, those investors want miners to balance investment in new and existing deposits with decent dividends, and a pledge to keep debt under control."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"""Greater returns are warranted to some degree, and it's what everyone ultimately wants,"" said Bennelong Australian Equity Partners manager Julian Beaumont, who manages shares in BHP. ""But at the same time there has to be discipline with enough capital available to grow and control debt."""
Ford Motor,2017-8,"Sober investment may be familiar territory for MacKenzie, a 53-year-old Canadian veteran of the packaging industry, who was hired in June to succeed former Ford Motor Co head Jac Nasser."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"But close scrutiny of how he, BHP Chief Executive Andrew Mackenzie (no relation) and their peers at Rio and Glencore spend profits will be a test in mining's brave - lean - new world."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"BHP, Rio and Glencore declined Reuters' requests for comment for this story."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"Just a few years ago, with China's economy surging, miners went on a buying spree: the high water mark was Rio's acquisition of aluminium producer Alcan for $38 billion. About the same time, former BHP CEO Marius Kloppers was lining up an $80 billion spending budget."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"Now, investors want cleaner balance sheets. Big projects are necessary - reserves must be replenished and are ever tougher to find. But ambitious ones like BHP's Jansen potash mine in Canada need to be tackled with partners - hence efforts to sell a $2 billion stake. [nL2N1LB15T]"
Ford Motor,2017-8,"""Commodities prices have helped with cash and we're seeing dividends, but things can turn very quickly, so I'd expect to see some prudence on their part,"" said Jason Beddow, chief executive at Argo Investments, which holds BHP and Rio shares. ""I'd like to see them focus on paying down debt."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"BHP's MacKenzie held around 100 meetings with shareholders, including Elliott, to sound out concerns before his official start as chairman, BHP has said."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"In August Elliott became the second-biggest investor in BHP's London-listed arm, giving the fund the power to propose resolutions seeking board changes. Pressure from activists to shake up boardrooms cost the scalps of two BHP directors last week, both with long careers in oil and gas. [nL4N1L91QA]"
Ford Motor,2017-8,"The first in deep trouble when things went sour, Rio was also the quickest to recover."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"Of the big three, Rio's shares are performing closest to benchmark indices and it now has the strongest balance sheet of the majors - something CEO Jean-Sebastien Jacques, appointed in July 2016, insists he will nurture with conservative targets on capital expenditure."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"A number of fund managers contacted by Reuters for this article said Glencore had taken the hardest line in resisting richer payouts for investors. Glencore declared a flat first-half dividend, despite generating $2.5 billion in profits from higher coal, copper and other commodity prices."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"Unlike the other mining bosses, Glencore's CEO Ivan Glasenberg is a major shareholder - but also one of the few remaining executives with a track record of opportunistic deals. For now, Glasenberg says his priority is keeping an investment grade rating by limiting debt and boosting returns. [nL5N1KM2XJ]"
Ford Motor,2017-8,"A key indicator for how miners handle the new investor ambience will be how BHP deals with its $20 billion foray into shale deposits in the United States, an asset bought a half-decade ago in a world of high oil prices. BHP is alone among the big three with assets in this field."
Ford Motor,2017-8,Widely diverging views on how BHP should handle this show how tough it may be to keep investors happy.
Ford Motor,2017-8,"At the prodding of investors triggered by Elliott, BHP said in August the business was now under review and may be sold, at the right price. But with oil trading below $50 a barrel, sector consultants Rystad Energy estimated the division is worth only $5.1 billion."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"""BHP wants to sell shale at the bottom of the cycle,"" said Ben Clark, a fund manager for TMS Capital who manages Rio shares, adding shareholders would see returns battered."

Ford Motor,2017-8,"{{20170830T140051.281+0000}}UPDATE 2-India cabinet approves raising levy on luxury cars, SUVs* Maximum levy to be hiked to 25 pct from 15 pct"
Ford Motor,2017-8,(Adds comments from car makers Audi and Jaguar Land Rover)
Ford Motor,2017-8,"NEW DELHI, Aug 30 (Reuters) - India's cabinet on Wednesday approved raising the maximum levy on luxury cars and sports utility vehicles (SUVs), drawing criticism from several car makers."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"Rahil Ansari, India head of German luxury car maker Audi , said the move could lead to a double-digit dip in sales and force the company to rethink its plans for the country."
Ford Motor,2017-8,The levy is part of a nationwide goods and services tax (GST) launched last month to replace a multitude of provincial and national levies in the biggest tax reform in 70 years.
Ford Motor,2017-8,"Under the new sales tax, vehicles are taxed at 18 percent or 28 percent with an additional levy of 15 percent on some types of cars."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"The cabinet passed an executive order, or ordinance, to raise the maximum levy to 25 percent from 15 percent, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"""The ordinance is only an enabling law. This does not mean the cess (levy) will automatically increase,"" Jaitley said, adding that a panel of federal and state finance chiefs that form the GST council will decide on the timing and amount of increase."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"Raising the levy will make luxury cars and SUVs more expensive and could hurt sales of companies like Mercedes-Benz, BMW , Volvo and Jaguar Land Rover, owned by Tata Motors . [nL4N1KT4B4]"
Ford Motor,2017-8,"Audi's Ansari said the move will be ""detrimental"", and force the company to raise prices and redraw its India plans."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"""This is bound to adversely impact sales by possibly a double-digit reduction and will consequently reduce revenues for the company, dealers and perhaps also tax revenues for the government,"" Ansari said, adding that any increase should be postponed by 6 to 12 months."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"Rohit Suri, managing director for Jaguar Land Rover in India said that since the implementation of GST, demand for luxury cars has been on the rise and a continuation of this would create jobs and enable more investments in local manufacturing."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"""We earnestly hope the government and GST council will give due consideration to this matter and desist from raising the cess,"" Suri said."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"Sales of auto makers such as Toyota Motor <7203.T>, Mahindra & Mahindra and Maruti Suzuki that sell SUVs in India could also be affected."

Ford Motor,2017-8,"DETROIT, Aug 29 (Reuters) - Tropical Storm Harvey is likely to briefly depress already slowing U.S. auto sales, but could eventually help boost demand as damaged cars are replaced, analysts said on Tuesday."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"The catastrophic flooding in Houston, the fourth-largest U.S. city, could mean 2 percent fewer vehicles will be sold in August than previously expected, according to Edmunds.com."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"""In subsequent months we'll likely see a slight localized bump in sales as the recovery takes hold and people are able to buy replacement vehicles,"" said Jessica Caldwell, executive director of industry analysis at Edmunds, in a statement."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"Before the storm, industry consultants JD Power and LMC had forecast sales for the month at a seasonally adjusted annualized rate of 16.6 million units, down nearly 3.5 percent from August 2016."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"Auto loan applications in the Houston market have dropped roughly 80 percent since the storm came ashore on Friday, according to Cox Automotive's Dealertrack."
Ford Motor,2017-8,Cox Automotive said it had lowered its U.S. auto industry August sales forecast to a seasonally adjusted annualized rate of 16.3 million units from 16.6 million units.
Ford Motor,2017-8,"After Superstorm Sandy caused widespread flooding in the New York metropolitan area in 2012, ""we saw all of those lost sales made up in the subsequent few months and then some because of replacements for vehicles destroyed and damaged,"" Cox Automotive analyst Michelle Krebs said."

Ford Motor,2017-8,"It will not be the first experiment with advanced pizza delivery technology. Australia-based Domino's Pizza Enterprises , the Ann Arbor-based company's largest independent franchisee, has tested delivery to customers in New Zealand via drone and self-driving robot."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"In a blog post last week, Sherif Marakby, head of Ford's autonomous and electric vehicles, signaled the automaker's broader ambitions, saying Ford planned to cooperate ""with multiple partners"" in deploying self-driving vehicles ""designed to improve the movement of people and goods."""

Ford Motor,2017-8,{{20170828T132758.020+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-Water woes may leave green-car hopes high and dry(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.)
Ford Motor,2017-8,"NEW YORK, Aug 28 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Water problems could leave the burgeoning market for green cars high and dry. Ford is the latest to ramp up its electrification efforts with a planned joint venture with China's Anhui <000980.SZ>. Trouble is, the industry relies heavily on the Democratic Republic of Congo for cobalt to make electric vehicles' lithium-ion batteries."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"Doing business in the DRC is challenging to begin with. In 2016 fresh violence erupted in parts of the country, displacing nearly a million people and raising fears of a revival of the civil war that raged for seven years at the turn of the century. Water woes add an extra level of difficulty."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"Players like BHP Billiton need secure water supplies for their cobalt-mining operations. They also are big consumers of electricity, which is produced mostly by hydropower. With the Congo River running near 100-year lows after two years of drought, blackouts are a big risk."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"Miscalculating water issues can be costly. Barrick Gold spent $5 billion on its Pascua Lama gold mine, which is still mothballed four years after a Chilean court forced its closure, citing pollution problems. BHP Billiton had to spend almost $2 billion on a desalination plant to ensure it had enough water for its operation in that country."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"Electric vehicles will have to play a big role if governments and companies are to carry out the Paris climate-change accord and keep the globe's temperature increase below 2 degrees Celsius. The International Energy Agency estimates there will have to be 1.2 billion electric cars on the world's roads in 2060, up from just 2 million at the end of 2016."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"Meeting that demand will require, by 2050, an almost 12-fold increase in the 121 million tonnes of cobalt mined last year, according to the World Bank. The DRC provided just over half that and holds almost 50 percent of global reserves of the metal, the World Bank estimates."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"Cranking up production can generate billions of additional revenue for the impoverished country and help protect the global environment. Without adequate water, though, those opportunities will shrivel."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"- World Water Week got underway in Stockholm on Aug. 27.

Ford Motor,2017-8,"Aug 27 (Reuters) - Days before Hurricane Harvey barreled into the Texas coast on Friday, home improvement retailers were preparing truckloads of lumber, shingles and other materials that property owners in the storm-raked communities will need to rebuild."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"The deliveries will have to wait, however, as 56 stores between Home Depot and Lowe's in southeast Texas remained closed as of Sunday amid widespread flooding. Once they reopen, the chains could be among the biggest beneficiaries of the post-storm recovery."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"Lowe's has sent ""500 truckloads"" of supplies to the storm zone, said spokeswoman Sarah Lively. ""We are reopening those stores as quickly as possible."""
Ford Motor,2017-8,"For the moment, the biggest storm to hit Texas in 50 years is posing a major disruption to one of the most important economic crossroads in the United States and the heart of its oil industry. Ports, railways and highways are closed or clogged, potentially blocking movement of key parts of the U.S. manufacturing supply chain."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"Catastrophic flooding triggered by now Tropical Storm Harvey inundated Houston on Sunday, forcing residents of the fourth most populous U.S. city to flee their homes in anticipation of more days of ""unprecedented"" rainfall. [nL2N1LD06K]"
Ford Motor,2017-8,"The home improvement retailers, well versed in the business of disaster, are likely steps ahead of most companies."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"At Home Depot, spokesman Matt Harrigan said preparations began ""as soon as the storm was on the radar."""
Ford Motor,2017-8,"Both Home Depot and Lowe's said they have set up command centers to manage the response. Both companies also said they will freeze prices for lumber, roofing and other rebuilding materials for a time in the affected zone."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"Other U.S. companies, including automakers, railroads and insurers, will likely be trying to send investors similar reassuring messages as trading starts on Monday."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"Texas is a significant vehicle market, particularly for highly profitable pickup trucks built by the big three Detroit automakers."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"In the short term, the storm will hamper operations at dealers and could dampen August sales. But longer term, ""it seems there has been enough flooding to damage thousands of light vehicles that will need replacing,"" said Nick Colas, an independent analyst based in New York City."

Ford Motor,2017-8,It was not clear on Sunday how the storm would affect supply chains for automakers and other manufacturers that depend on goods flowing to and from northern Mexico.
Ford Motor,2017-8,"Ford Motor Co , General Motors Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV said on Sunday they had thus far not seen any impact or issues with getting parts across the storm zone but were monitoring the storm closely.

Ford Motor,2017-8,"Home improvement companies Lowe's and Home Depot have temporarily frozen prices for lumber and roofing materials at stores in the area affected by Tropical Storm Harvey, even as flooding has forced the chains to close dozens of stores, the companies said on Sunday."
Ford Motor,2017-8,Home Depot has so far announced the closure of 42 stores while Lowe's has closed 14 stores in Houston and the surrounding area.
Ford Motor,2017-8,"""Right now we have to play it by ear just to see what the conditions are going to be in those areas,"" said Sarah Lively, a spokeswoman for Lowe's. ""We are reopening those stores as quickly as possible."""

Ford Motor,2017-8,"The U.S. automaker hopes Luo, the first executive from mainland China to hold its top job there, will reprise his work at KSS, where he engineered a significant surge in China revenue."

Ford Motor,2017-8,"Foreign automakers in China are battling fierce competition from a swathe of local rivals, who are aggressively launching new models to grab market share. The market is also skewed by heavy government support for electric vehicles, prompting Ford to seek partners and expand local production."

Ford Motor,2017-8,BREAKINGVIEWS-Jeep sale would leave Marchionne nowhere to hide - Reuters Breakingviews
Ford Motor,2017-8,{{20170822T173656.818+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-Jeep sale would leave Marchionne nowhere to hide(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.)
Ford Motor,2017-8,"NEW YORK, Aug 22 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Selling Jeep would leave Sergio Marchionne nowhere to hide. The Fiat Chrysler Automobiles chief executive advocates using M&A to stop carmakers wasting precious capital. Offloading the company's top brand to China's Great Wall Motor <601633.SS>, whose president has indicated interest, could raise billions. But it would leave an emaciated rump."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"Great Wall's interest may stall in any event. With a market value of some $15 billion, it may struggle to secure financing or Beijing's approval for a deal larger than itself. Even if it succeeded, the Trump administration and the U.S. Congress are likely to balk at allowing such a large and iconic U.S. brand to end up in Chinese hands."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"Fiat Chrysler, though, does need to do something. It is already the earnings straggler among the major automakers. Its pre-tax margin last year, at 2.8 percent, was the lowest of the group; Ford Motor and General Motors both cranked out just over 7 percent."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"Things are improving as Marchionne shrugs off more of the debt that resulted in part from taking over Chrysler after the U.S. government-backed bankruptcy exit in 2009. But Fiat Chrysler is the only one of the top 12 that sell-side analysts reckon will fail to earn more than a 6 percent pre-tax margin in each of the next three years, according to Thomson Reuters data."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"The $23 billion a Jeep sale might bring, according to Morgan Stanley, could be tempting, whether Great Wall or another carmaker ends up the buyer. It would clean up the balance sheet. Deep-pocketed players like Google , Apple and Intel are new rivals in the race towards autonomous driving. Lacking investment firepower, Marchionne has stayed largely on the technological sidelines, though last week he took his company into the Intel-Mobileye-BMW alliance ."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"Yet handing the keys to Jeep to a new owner would combust even the modest earnings that are currently anticipated. The brand may account for almost three-quarters of EBITDA next year, reckons Morgan Stanley. Ram trucks, Maserati and three captive parts makers are still profitable, but Alfa Romeo, Dodge and Chrysler are in the red. On top of that, the company still has more than $5 billion of both net debt and unfunded pensions."
Ford Motor,2017-8,Marchionne is due to step down next year to concentrate on running Ferrari. A radical move like selling Jeep would certainly leave a mark. But it would set up his last lap at what remained of Fiat Chrysler to be a dismal one.
Ford Motor,2017-8,"- Chinese carmaker Great Wall Motor on Aug. 22 reiterated its potential interest in acquiring part or all of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, Reuters reported, echoing a public statement by Great Wall a day earlier. As yet China's largest maker of sport-utility vehicles has not held talks or signed any deal with executives at the Italian-American maker of Alfa Romeos, Ram trucks and Jeeps, according to the report."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"- Automotive News had initially reported the news, quoting Great Wall President Wang Fengying as saying she planned to contact FCA to discuss a deal for the Jeep brand."

Ford Motor,2017-8,"VIENNA, Aug 22 (Reuters) - Austria's Transport Minister Joerg Leichtfried said on Tuesday he had agreed with carmakers to update the software of 600,000 diesel cars to reduce pollution following a similar deal struck in Germany after a large-scale emissions scandal."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"Leichtfried said the deal also included extra payments to buyers of more environmentally friendly cars. He said that for potential buyers of electric cars all available financial help could add up to around 10,000 euros ($11,750) per vehicle."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"The exact amount of incentives, which will come in addition to existing government sweeteners for e-car buyers, will be decided and paid by the carmakers depending on the model of the vehicle exchanged for an old car, the spokesman of Austrian car importers association Guenther Kerle said."

Ford Motor,2017-8,"However, environmentalists said the plan - almost two years after Volkswagen admitted to cheating U.S. diesel emissions tests - was too little, too late."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"The Austrian software update, which would take until spring next year and which carmakers say can reduce toxic nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions by 25-30 percent, is the same as in Germany, Kerle said."
Ford Motor,2017-8,Critics of the German plan have said software updates would only result in a cut of about 2-3 percent of emissions.

Ford Motor,2017-8,"{{20170822T075419.766+0000}}Ford becomes latest carmaker to launch UK scrappage schemeLONDON, Aug 22 (Reuters) - Ford on Tuesday became the latest carmaker to launch a car scrappage scheme in Britain, joining the likes of BMW and Mercedes-Benz , after months of procrastination from the government over whether to begin a national programme."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"The U.S. automaker is offering customers a 2,000 pound ($2,580) discount off a range of many Ford models when they trade in their vehicles registered until the end of 2009."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Vauxhall, the British version of the Opel brand sold on the continent, have all launched similar schemes in recent weeks to incentivise motorists to reduce emissions by replacing their gas-guzzling models with greener cars."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"The plans come after Britain once again delayed in July a decision over whether to introduce a nationwide or targeted vehicle scrappage scheme, with a consultation due to take place later this year, despite worries over emissions levels. [nL5N1KH21I]"
Ford Motor,2017-8,"""Ford shares society's concerns over air quality,"" its managing director in Britain Andy Barratt said on Tuesday."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"""Removing generations of the most polluting vehicles will have the most immediate positive effect on air quality."""
Ford Motor,2017-8,"Ford, BMW, Vauxhall and Mercedes sell around 1 million cars in Britain, more than a third of all new car registrations."
Ford Motor,2017-8,The scrappage schemes will help support sales at a time when demand for new cars is beginning to slide substantially for the first time in around six years.
Ford Motor,2017-8,"In July, new car registrations fell for the fourth consecutive month in a row, hit by a number of factors including uncertainty over Brexit and lack of clarity over future government plans around new levies on diesel models."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"Britain's last government-backed scrappage scheme came in the wake of the financial crisis and ran for nearly a year from mid-2009, helping to support the car sector, which had been hit by nose-diving sales."

Ford Motor,2017-8,{{20170818T174741.201+0000}}BlackBerry rally derailed as investors lose patience on turnaroundBy Alastair Sharp
Ford Motor,2017-8,"TORONTO, Aug 18 (Reuters) - BlackBerry Ltd shares have been plunging from their more than two-year high hit in June after lackluster earnings and competitive threats have raised doubts about prospects for a turnaround at the business software maker."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"At Friday's price of about $8.70, BlackBerry's U.S.-traded shares have lost a quarter of their value since reaching a high of $11.74 on June 1."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"The stock had rallied from a low of $6.65 in early March on hopes for the company's QNX industrial operating system for self-driving cars, but investors have started to reassess the yearslong effort by BlackBerry to move beyond the smartphones that made its name a household word."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"""It's been a turnaround story now for about five years,"" said Joel Kulina, a technology-sector market maker for Wedbush Securities. ""People don't have the patience."""
Ford Motor,2017-8,Chief Executive Officer John Chen has spent years remaking BlackBerry as a software company focused on selling to automakers and other industrial businesses.
Ford Motor,2017-8,"Revenue, which peaked at about $20 billion when BlackBerry was dominating the smartphone market, has fallen sharply. Analysts expect it to drop below $1 billion this year for the first time since 2004 and decline again in the following fiscal year."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"""We're not going to jump in before we see some signs of turning the corner and establishing meaningful profitability,"" said wealth manager Chris Zaccarelli, whose Cornerstone Financial Partners in Huntersville, North Carolina, advises on $1.2 billion of assets."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"In late June, BlackBerry reported quarterly earnings that missed analysts' forecasts due to an unexpected sales decline, ramping up pressure on the company to meet its goal of boosting software and services revenue by 10 percent to 15 percent this year."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"BlackBerry declined to comment on the stock price, but QNX manager Grant Courville said it expected to sign deals with at least three major companies to get QNX into self-driving vehicles."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"Last year BlackBerry announced a deal for Ford Motor Co to expand use of QNX, which is used mostly in car information and entertainment systems. The companies have provided few details on the arrangement."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"QNX, which is already in most automobile ""infotainment"" systems, is one product that BlackBerry bulls talked up as the stock rallied earlier this year, saying the plans to expand its use in other parts of vehicles could generate significant revenue."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"Yet investors ""are figuring out that it isn't a straight path to a pot of gold"" for QNX, said CIBC Markets analyst Todd Coupland."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"Intel Corp poses one threat to QNX. The world's No. 1 chipmaker owns a rival operating system and this year paid $15.3 billion to buy Mobileye, a maker of sensors and cameras for self-driving vehicles."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"Luxury carmaker Audi is using Intel's system in the safety-related electronic control unit for its 2018 A8 sedan, which will be one of the most advanced self-driving cars on the road."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T> last week joined a self-driving technology alliance whose members include Intel, Ericsson and Denso Corp <6902.T> but not BlackBerry."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"BlackBerry's Courville discounted the threat from Intel. He said QNX was being used in at least six automotive programs based on Intel chips, some for self-driving vehicles."

Ford Motor,2017-8,"{{20170817T213601.417+0000}}Auto groups side with Canada, Mexico on NAFTA origin rulesBy David Lawder and Anthony Esposito"
Ford Motor,2017-8,"WASHINGTON, Aug 17 (Reuters) - Auto industry groups from Canada, Mexico and the United States are pushing back against the Trump administration's demand for higher U.S. automotive content in a modernized North American Free Trade Agreement."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"At talks underway this week in Washington, automaker and parts groups from all three countries were urging negotiators against tighter rules of origin, said Eduardo Solis, president of the Mexican Automotive Industry Association."
Ford Motor,2017-8,But U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer confirmed the industry's fears that the administration of President Donald Trump was seeking major changes to these rules to try to reduce the U.S. trade deficit with Mexico.
Ford Motor,2017-8,"""Rules of origin, particularly on autos and auto parts, must require higher NAFTA content and substantial U.S. content. Country of origin should be verified, not 'deemed,'"" Lighthizer said on Wednesday in opening remarks."
Ford Motor,2017-8,Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo and Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland both said they were not in favor of specific national rules of origin within NAFTA - a position that the industry agrees with.
Ford Motor,2017-8,"""We certainly think a U.S.-specific requirement would greatly complicate the ability of companies, particularly small- and medium-size enterprises, to take advantage of the benefits of NAFTA,"" said Matt Blunt, president of the American Automotive Policy Council. The trade group represents Detroit automakers General Motors Co Ford Motor Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles ."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"His comments were echoed by Flavio Volpe, president of Canada's Automotive Parts Manufacturers Association."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"""Anytime you say this list or a part of this list has to come from one specific country you're going to hurt all three countries,"" he said."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"The United States had an autos and auto parts trade deficits of $74 billion with Mexico and $5.6 billion with Canada, both major components of overall U.S. goods trade deficits with its North American neighbors -- deficits that Lighthizer said could no longer continue."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"Lighthizer's mention of tightening verification requirements is a reference to expanding the parts tracing list, which is used to determine whether companies meet the 62.5 percent North American content requirement for autos and 60 percent for components."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"Devised in the early 1990s, the tracing list covers almost none of the sophisticated electronics found in today's cars and trucks, most of which come from Asia. Putting these on the tracing list could force suppliers to source these components from North America or pay tariffs on them. [nL1N1KW22J]"
Ford Motor,2017-8,Volpe said any changes to this must also capture the North American system design work and software content for these components that is not currently included.
Ford Motor,2017-8,"""A car today probably has 25 to 30 percent advanced electronics, software content in it. In 1994, it had zero or 1 percent,"" Volpe said. ""Could you address the tracing to help you get to NAFTA compliance level by capturing some of the work that's being done in Silicon Valley or Waterloo, Canada? Yes."""
Ford Motor,2017-8,"John Bozzella CEO of the Association of Global Automakers, which represents international-brand carmakers, said NAFTA has allowed a major expansion of auto exports, with more than 1 million more vehicles built annually in the United States than in 1993."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"""Negotiators should be mindful of this success as they work to modernize the agreement,"" Bozzella said, whose organization represents international brand carmakers with U.S. plants, including Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T>, Honda Motor Co Ltd <7267.T> and BMW ."

Ford Motor,2017-8,UPDATE 2-Carmakers win brief reprieve from lawsuits over faulty Takata air bags - Reuters News
Ford Motor,2017-8,"{{20170816T190244.196+0000}}UPDATE 2-Carmakers win brief reprieve from lawsuits over faulty Takata air bags(Adds details on the stay, background)"
Ford Motor,2017-8,Aug 16 (Reuters) - Automakers on Wednesday won a temporary reprieve from lawsuits filed by victims of defective air bags made by bankrupt Takata Corp <7312.T> that led to the largest-ever auto safety recall and at least 18 deaths.
Ford Motor,2017-8,The decision gives the Japanese auto supplier breathing room to work through its bankruptcy reorganization.
Ford Motor,2017-8,"U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Brendan Shannon in Wilmington, Delaware, granted a 90-day halt on lawsuits brought by Hawaii, New Mexico, the U.S. Virgin Islands as well as individuals. He did not extend the shield to 48 federal cases that extend across several districts, saying the lawsuits had already advanced."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"Takata <7312.T> argued for a six-month freeze on hundreds of lawsuits so management could complete a $1.6 billion sale of its viable operations, crucial to its reorganization, and replace air bag inflators that are subject to the biggest recall in automotive history."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"Shannon said he was ""extremely sensitive"" to the plaintiffs' cases but believed a ""breathing spell"" for Takata was appropriate. The stay expires on Nov. 15."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"At least 18 deaths and 180 injuries worldwide have been tied to a defect that causes Takata inflators to explode with excessive force, unleashing metal shrapnel inside vehicles. [nL1N1KI22B]"
Ford Motor,2017-8,"Major automakers including BMW AG , Ford Motor Co , Honda Motor Co Ltd <7267.T> and Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T>, argued in favor of the pause."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"Takata and TK Holdings Inc, its U.S. unit, said they faced tens of billions of dollars in liabilities when they filed for bankruptcy protection in June, including claims from automakers that used its airbags and individuals who filed class-action lawsuits. [nL3N1JN07F]"
Ford Motor,2017-8,"Bankruptcy automatically stayed hundreds of lawsuits against TK Holdings for wrongful death, injuries, economic loss and breach of consumer protection laws stemming from the faulty airbags."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"In July, the company asked the court to suspend lawsuits against automakers brought by airbag victims, and last week Takata separately filed for U.S. bankruptcy protection, or Chapter 15, in an effort to pause U.S. lawsuits against the parent. [nL1N1KV1JG]"
Ford Motor,2017-8,"The official bankruptcy committee that represents injured drivers said in court papers the injunction would have ""human consequences"" and prevent people from pursuing compensation."
Ford Motor,2017-8,The committee cited a 23-year-old New Jersey woman who became quadriplegic from brain injuries that a government investigator said were caused by a faulty Takata air bag.
Ford Motor,2017-8,"The woman's lawyers estimated her economic loss would be $18 million, not including potential damages for pain and suffering."
Ford Motor,2017-8,The defective air bags have been linked to at least 18 deaths and 180 injuries worldwide.
Ford Motor,2017-8,"The recall, the largest in automotive history, will eventually cover 125 million inflators, many of which still need to be replaced."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"In January, Takata entered a settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice, setting aside $125 million to compensate consumers and $850 million in restitution for automakers. [nL1N1F3140]"

Ford Motor,2017-8,{{20170816T071951.696+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-Geely drives bumpy road toward global fame(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.)
Ford Motor,2017-8,"HONG KONG, Aug 16 (Reuters Breakingviews) - China's Zhejiang Geely looks a prime candidate to become China's first truly international carmaker. That hope, plus surging domestic sales, has sent shares in Geely's Hong Kong-listed arm, Geely Automobile <0175.HK>, up more than 230 percent in a year. But the lure of overseas glory could distract. This company needs to keep winning at home."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"On Wednesday, Geely Auto said first-half profit more than doubled to $649 million. Sales volume rose 89 percent to hit 621,731 units from January to July, thanks to popular new designs selling like hot cakes in China, even as the wider market grew just 2 percent."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"It's impressive that Geely brands are so popular at home. This is a competitive arena with dozens of players. But momentum could quickly fade, and overseas sales cannot yet take up the slack. The company's vehicle exports make up less than 1 percent of total volume; they actually fell 64 percent in the first half."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"Even so, growing overseas will be critical in the long term. To that end, Geely is developing a brand called Lynk & Co, a joint venture with Volvo whose cars will include a built-in ride-sharing button and other innovations. Geely is wisely pushing this ""disruptive"" brand at home first, where drivers love dashboard gee-gaws, then testing offshore markets."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"Overly aggressive offshore expansion is a major risk; developing new auto brands is harder than generating headlines. Still, many industry-watchers doubted Li could make much of Volvo when he bought the Swedish brand from Ford for $1.8 billion in 2010, and at first cooperation was minimal. And yet Li's cautious approach to integration not only sustained the Swedes but has begun to benefit the parent. If he can keep within the speed limit, Geely could go all the way to global stardom."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"- Hong Kong-listed Geely Automobile Holdings said on Aug. 16 first-half net profit hit 4.3 billion yuan ($649 million), up 128 percent year on year. Total revenue rose to 39.4 billion yuan from 18.1 billion."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"- Exports fell 64 percent to 3,848 units, making up just 0.7 percent of total sales."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"- On Aug. 7, Geely said unaudited vehicle sales hit 621,731 units in the first seven months of 2017, up 89 percent from the previous year. The company lifted its annual volume target 10 percent to 1.1 million units."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"- Geely is consistently among the top 10 most actively traded shares through the southbound channels of the Shanghai and Shanghai Stock Connect programmes, which allow mainland investors to invest in Hong Kong stocks."

Ford Motor,2017-8,"More than any other industry, autos have been the focus of U.S. President Donald Trump's anger over the North American Free Trade Agreement, which he blames for taking car factories and jobs away from the United States to low-wage Mexico."

Ford Motor,2017-8,The industry is opposed to such a carve-out or to increasing the percentage of a vehicle's value that must come from the region above the current 62.5 percent - already the highest of any global trade bloc.

Ford Motor,2017-8,"The issue is also sensitive in Canada, another major NAFTA auto producing center. Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland on Monday said she was prepared to discuss ""some strengthening of the rules of origin"" but made no commitments."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"""We are also extremely mindful of the possibility that any changes... could have unintended consequences,"" she told reporters in Ottawa.[nL2N1L000M]"
Ford Motor,2017-8,"If U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross gets his way, it would be harder to reach the 62.5 percent content threshold because the ""tracing list"" of parts that count toward that goal would be modernized.

Ford Motor,2017-8,"Parts that did not exist when the 300-plus-page list was devised in the early 1990s - largely electronics sourced from Asia such as console touch screens or hybrid-drive controllers - do not count against reaching the threshold.

Ford Motor,2017-8,"Among the other contentious NAFTA issues that U.S., Canadian and Mexican negotiators will tackle starting on Wednesday in Washington is the future of a mechanism for resolving trade disputes."

Ford Motor,2017-8,"This new financing trend has made it easier for consumers to pile on debt, further extending already over-leveraged households."

Ford Motor,2017-8,"Whether they sell construction equipment, semiconductors or coffee, many major U.S. companies have reported stronger second-quarter earnings and revenue from their Chinese operations in recent weeks."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"They are benefiting from a Chinese economy that is growing at almost 7 percent, several times the rate of U.S. expansion, a Chinese housing boom, and a slide in the U.S. dollar, which makes American exports more competitive and increases dollar earnings once they are translated from foreign currencies."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"Caterpillar Inc , a bellwether for industrial demand in China and beyond, reported its sales in Asia-Pacific rose 25 percent in the second quarter - thanks to China. Shipments of large excavators to Chinese customers more than doubled in the first half of the year."

Ford Motor,2017-8,"""China's grown pretty well relative to the U.S. over this period and the currency's relationship has changed in favor of the U.S. companies,"" said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at the Leuthold Group in Minneapolis."

For example, Chinese auto manufacturer Geely Automobile Holdings <0175.HK> announcing last week that its July sales climbed 89 percent from the year-earlier-month. Geely and many other major Chinese companies report their results in the next few weeks."
Ford Motor,2017-8,American companies in China have been collectively reporting better prospects even as they complain that the Chinese authorities are not allowing them enough access to parts of the Chinese market and discriminating against them as they seek to compete against Chinese rivals.
Ford Motor,2017-8,U.S. President Donald Trump's administration has been considering punitive tariffs against a range of Chinese goods but it has held off on taking action after Beijing backed tougher United Nations Security Council sanctions against North Korea earlier this month.
Ford Motor,2017-8,"However, senior U.S. officials said over the weekend that Trump on Monday will order his top trade adviser to determine whether to investigate Chinese trade practices that force U.S. firms operating in China to turn over intellectual property. The move could eventually lead to steep tariffs on Chinese goods."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"And despite some negatives in the Sino-U.S. relationship, a July report by the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai showed that 82 percent of U.S. companies in China expect revenues to increase this year, up from 76 percent a year ago."

Ford Motor,2017-8,"In the chip industry, Skywork Solutions , which gets around two thirds of its revenue from China, said last month that China remained a strong growth story for the company."

Ford Motor,2017-8,"""We see the fast-growing upper middle class driving strong consumption growth for our upmarket cognac brands,"" the company's Chief Financial Officer Luca Marotta said last month."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"Closer to home, Kweichow Moutai <600519.SS>, the Chinese maker of the liquor baijiu and the world's largest alcohol firm by value, saw first half profits gain 27.8 percent."
Ford Motor,2017-8,Chinese stock market gains this year have in turn helped confidence among retail investors.
Ford Motor,2017-8,"""I feel the wider economy is improving,"" said Ding Mingwei, 26, a manager at an education technology company in Shanghai."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"Ding, who says his own investments are up this year, now plans to spend more on hotels, dining out and funding hobbies such as playing the guitar."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"For some companies, China growth helped to offset problems elsewhere. Starbucks U.S. growth cooled in the third quarter but same-store sales for the coffee chain in China surged 7 percent."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"Among the Japanese companies to benefit, Sony's <6758.T> sales in China were up just under 50 percent in the three months to June, making it the electronic group's fastest-growing geographic segment."
Ford Motor,2017-8,There are some sectors that are proving a tougher slog for foreign companies.
Ford Motor,2017-8,"Major international automakers, even those reporting increased revenues, have pointed to squeezed margins in one of the world's most competitive markets. U.S. automaker General Motors , for example, saw a strong April-June quarter, but said it faced ""pricing challenges""."

Ford Motor,2017-8,The industry is opposed to such a carve-out or to increasing the percentage of a vehicle's value that must come from the region above the current 62.5 percent - already the highest of any global trade bloc.
Ford Motor,2017-8,They say this would raise costs and disrupt a complex supply chain that sees parts crisscrossing NAFTA borders and has made North American car production competitive with Asia and Europe.
Ford Motor,2017-8,"""Our members feel very strongly that rules of origin are not the tools to use to reshore jobs into the U.S.,"" said Ann Wilson, senior vice president of government affairs for the Motor and Equipment Manufacturers Association, a trade group representing auto parts makers."
Ford Motor,2017-8,Wilson and other industry advocates say a better way to boost U.S. manufacturing jobs is through policies aimed at expanding vehicle exports.
Ford Motor,2017-8,"But if U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross gets his way, it would be harder to reach the 62.5 percent content threshold because the ""tracing list"" of parts that count towards that goal would be modernized. He argues the current rules are too loose and allow a tariff-free ""back door"" for Chinese auto parts."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"Parts that did not exist when the 300-plus page list was devised in the early 1990s, largely electronics sourced from Asia such as console touch screens or hybrid-drive controllers, do not count against reaching the threshold. If they are put on the list, companies would have to source them from North America or pay tariffs on them."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"If the content requirements become too onerous, automakers will simply skip compliance ""and they'll just end up paying the duty,"" said Charles Uthus, vice president for international policy at the American Automotive Policy Council, a lobbying group for Ford Motor Co. , General Motors and Fiat Chrysler ."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"Foregoing all NAFTA tariff-free access benefits - something that could happen if Trump is dissatisfied with the negotiations and decides to scrap the trade pact - would raise costs by about $4 billion-5 billion a year, Ulthus added. Ford plans about $7 billion in total capital spending this year."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"Among the other contentious NAFTA issues that U.S., Canadian and Mexican negotiators will tackle starting on Wednesday in Washington is the future of a mechanism for resolving trade disputes."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"The United States wants to eliminate a so-called ""Chapter 19"" provision, arguing that it fails to combat unfair subsidies of some Mexican and Canadian goods. Mexico and Canada have vowed to keep the provision."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"Negotiators are expected to pursue new NAFTA chapters governing digital trade, and tightening environmental and labor standards, changes previously agreed by the three countries as part of the now-defunct 12-country Trans-Pacific Partnership."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"U.S. negotiators will also seek a provision to deter currency manipulation, aiming to set a precedent for future trade negotiations, such as a revised U.S.-North Korean deal or a bilateral pact with Japan."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"The negotiations face an extremely tight timeline, with officials saying they want to complete negotiations by early next year to avoid ratification difficulties posed by elections in Mexico in July 2018 and in the U.S. in November 2018."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"Freund, a trade economist for more than a decade at the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, said the negotiators should focus on a few key areas."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"""If you really want to do a full-blown modernization of NAFTA, it's going to take a lot more than six months,"" she said. ""Ultimately I think they're going to get bogged down in all these details and pick two to three things and have a smaller agenda."""

Ford Motor,2017-8,{{20170813T230001.975+0000}}ANALYSIS-China a sweet spot for U.S. companies' earnings in 2nd quarterBy Adam Jourdan
Ford Motor,2017-8,"SHANGHAI, Aug 14 (Reuters) - Trade tensions between Washington and Beijing may be running high but Corporate America is finding China to be a reliable source of profit growth this year."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"Whether they sell construction equipment, semiconductors or coffee, many major U.S. companies have reported stronger second-quarter earnings and revenue from their Chinese operations in recent weeks."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"They are benefiting from a Chinese economy that is growing at almost 7 percent, several times the rate of U.S. expansion, a Chinese housing boom, and a slide in the U.S. dollar, which makes American exports more competitive and increases dollar earnings once they are translated from foreign currencies."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"Caterpillar Inc , a bellwether for industrial demand in China and beyond, reported its sales in Asia-Pacific rose 25 percent in the second quarter - thanks to China. Shipments of large excavators to Chinese customers more than doubled in the first half of the year."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"""We now expect demand in China to remain strong through the rest of the year,"" Brad Halverson, Caterpillar's group president and chief financial officer, told investors."
Ford Motor,2017-8,Caterpillar's Japanese rivals Komatsu <6301.T> and Hitachi Construction Machinery Co <6305.T> reported similar strength in demand for heavy machinery. Komatsu's China sales almost doubled in the firm's April-June quarter. [nL3N1KJ2EP]
Ford Motor,2017-8,"""China's grown pretty well relative to the U.S. over this period and the currency's relationship has changed in favor of the U.S. companies,"" said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at the Leuthold Group in Minneapolis."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"Chinese companies are also benefiting from the robust domestic economy. For example, Chinese auto manufacturer Geely Automobile Holdings <0175.HK> announcing last week that its July sales climbed 89 percent from the year-earlier-month. Geely and many other major Chinese companies report their results in the next few weeks."
Ford Motor,2017-8,American companies in China have been collectively reporting better prospects even as they complain that the Chinese authorities are not allowing them enough access to parts of the Chinese market and discriminating against them as they seek to compete against Chinese rivals.
Ford Motor,2017-8,The Trump administration has been considering punitive tariffs against a range of Chinese goods but it has held off on taking action after Beijing backed tougher United Nations Security Council sanctions against North Korea earlier this month.
Ford Motor,2017-8,"And despite some negatives in the Sino-U.S. relationship, a July report by the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai showed that 82 percent of U.S. companies in China expect revenues to increase this year, up from 76 percent a year ago."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"""In general China is still a growth market for lots of US goods and services... the Chinese consumer is driving more and more the growth in China itself - that's a very positive shift in compositional growth for a lot of U.S. companies that do provide goods and services for consumers, as opposed to building skyscrapers,"" said Joe Quinlan, head of thematic investing at Bank of America, U.S. Trust."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"In the chip industry, Skywork Solutions , which gets around two thirds of its revenue from China, said last month that China remained a strong growth story for the company."
Ford Motor,2017-8,And many other foreign companies are also doing well. The European liquor industry is benefiting from a resurgence in Chinese consumer demand.
Ford Motor,2017-8,"""We see the fast-growing upper middle class driving strong consumption growth for our upmarket cognac brands,"" the company's Chief Financial Officer Luca Marotta said last month."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"Closer to home, Kweichow Moutai <600519.SS>, the Chinese maker of the liquor baijiu and the world's largest alcohol firm by value, saw first half profits gain 27.8 percent."
Ford Motor,2017-8,Chinese stock market gains this year have in turn helped confidence among retail investors.
Ford Motor,2017-8,"""I feel the wider economy is improving,"" said Ding Mingwei, 26, a manager at an education technology company in Shanghai."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"Ding, who says his own investments are up this year, now plans to spend more on hotels, dining out and funding hobbies such as playing the guitar."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"For some companies, China growth helped to offset problems elsewhere. Starbucks U.S. growth cooled in the third quarter but same-store sales for the coffee chain in China surged 7 percent."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"Among the Japanese companies to benefit, Sony's <6758.T> sales in China were up just under 50 percent in the three months to June, making it the electronic group's fastest-growing geographic segment."
Ford Motor,2017-8,There are some sectors that are proving a tougher slog for foreign companies.
Ford Motor,2017-8,"Major international automakers, even those reporting increased revenues, have pointed to squeezed margins in one of the world's most competitive markets. U.S. automaker General Motors , for example, saw a strong April-June quarter, but said it faced ""pricing challenges""."
Ford Motor,2017-8,And some economists warn that it is unclear how long the Chinese economy and the markets can keep their buzz.
Ford Motor,2017-8,"""The strong rebound is largely being driven by the property market and export growth, which both seem unsustainable,"" said Nomura Chief China Economist Yang Zhao in Hong Kong. He said he expects China's economic growth to cool by the fourth quarter."

Ford Motor,2017-8,"MONTREAL, Aug 11 (Reuters) - Canadians are making smaller payments more frequently on auto term loans as new financing offers lure buyers away from the typical monthly billing cycle, a trend public advocacy groups say could push consumers to purchase more expensive vehicles that they simply cannot afford."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"""Because long-term car loans tend to involve lower monthly or bi-weekly payments, extended terms can encourage consumers to buy more car than they may be able to afford,"" said Kathryn Dunn, a spokeswoman for the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada"
Ford Motor,2017-8,"This new financing trend has made it easier for consumers to pile on debt, further extending already over-leveraged households."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"According to Statistics Canada, households have amassed huge debt, with the ratio of debt to disposable income at a near record of 166.9 percent during the first quarter of 2017."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"The increase comes at a time when the Bank of Canada is likely to raise interest rates again this year, after the first interest rate hike in seven years in July. [nL1N1K508A]"
Ford Motor,2017-8,"More than half of Canadians who borrow to buy new vehicles look to make payments every two weeks, with the arrival of their paychecks, said Robert Karwel, a senior manager for J.D. Power in Canada."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"Some borrowers are opting to pay even more frequently with four percent making payments each week during the first half of 2017, up from 3.4 percent in 2015, the J.D. Power data show. ""These terms don't allow you to pay off the car any faster, so it's questionable why it is being taken-up by customers,"" Karwel said. ""We feel it has to do with the amount of stress the family budget is under."""
Ford Motor,2017-8,"Still, delinquency rates on Canada's C$120 billion ($94.7 billion) in auto loans remained low at 1.7 percent during the first quarter of 2017, relatively flat from the same period a year ago, according to June data from credit information company TransUnion."

Ford Motor,2017-8,"BERLIN, Aug 11 (Reuters) - Germany believes the European Commission will propose quotas for electric cars in its next review of measures to cut emissions, a spokesman for the German environment ministry said on Friday."
Ford Motor,2017-8,The Commission said on Monday it had no plans to introduce quotas for electric cars for an automobile sector seeking to recover from the Volkswagen diesel scandal.
Ford Motor,2017-8,"A spokeswoman for the German environment ministry, which is run by the Social Democrats (SPD) - the junior partner in Chancellor Angela Merkel's ruling coalition - said without quotas for electric cars the European Union could miss its carbon dioxide emissions targets."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"The SPD, Merkel's main rival in September's election, wants a European-wide quota to accelerate the shift towards electric cars, the SPD's general secretary said on Friday."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"""There must be ambitious targets, otherwise we won't make any headway,"" Hubertus Heil told Reuters."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"He added that he was not, however, in favour of setting a specific date to take diesel motors out of service."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"The SPD, which is lagging far behind Merkel's conservatives in opinion polls, is in favour of tax incentives to accelerate the switch to electric cars."
Ford Motor,2017-8,A plan laid out by SPD leader Martin Schulz said an obligatory minimum number of electric cars for Germany and Europe would give car markers incentives to develop new technologies. He did not suggest specific numbers.
Ford Motor,2017-8,The Stuttgarter Zeitung newspaper cited several members of Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU) as criticising the SPD's suggestions of a quota.
Ford Motor,2017-8,"""Set quotas remind me of a planned economy and that has never been successful,"" Norbert Barthle, deputy transport minister and CDU member, was quoted as saying."
Ford Motor,2017-8,Britain said last month it would ban the sale of new petrol and diesel cars from 2040 in an attempt to reduce air pollution. The global auto industry debate could one day herald the end of more than a century of reliance on the combustion engine. [nL9N1GF06X]

Ford Motor,2017-8,"BERLIN, Aug 10 (Reuters) - Ford said German motor authorities were investigating a diesel-engined model of its mid-sized Mondeo car, adding that none of its cars was equipped with illegal emissions cheating software."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"Ford Germany said in an emailed statement on Thursday that all its vehicles and engines, including those with its latest diesel engines, complied with current emissions guidelines and did not contain illegal software devices."
Ford Motor,2017-8,The carmaker said it had been contacted by Germany's KBA vehicle certification authority about its Mondeo 2.0 TCDi model and had pledged to cooperate with the German authority.

Ford Motor,2017-8,"Aug 10 (Reuters) - German ministers, regional politicians and car executives have agreed a package of measures aimed at cutting inner-city air pollution and averting bans on diesel cars. [nL5N1KO14A]"
Ford Motor,2017-8,Following are some of the key points of the agreement:
Ford Motor,2017-8,"As a way to take older, polluting cars off the road, carmakers have agreed to offer trade-in deals for older diesel cars if customers then switch to newer, cleaner models."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"Ford announced it will pay owners of vehicles with Euro-1, Euro-2 or Euro-3 emission-standard engines a bonus of between 2,000 and 8,000 euros ($2,348 to $9,394) if they trade in their old cars by end of 2017."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"Mercedes-Benz said it would offer customers in Europe up to 2,000 euros for trading in older diesels equipped with engines built to meet the Euro-1 to Euro-4 emissions standards in exchange for a newer Mercedes. A trade-in discount of 1,000 euros will be offered to customers buying an electric Smart car."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"Volkswagen said it would offer trade-in discounts of between 2,000 and 10,000 euros for its own-brand cars, depending on the vehicle. For older diesel versions of the VW Golf, a 5,000 euro incentive is being offered."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"VW's premium devision Audi said it would offer between 3,000 and 10,000 euros to trade in cars with Euro-4 engines for newer cars, while sister brand Porsche said it would offer up to 5,000 euros."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"VW's Seat brand will offer trade-in discounts of between 1,750 euros and 8,000 euros depending on the model."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"Opel said it would offer customers between 1,750 and 7,000 euros for trade-ins of cars with Euro-1 to Euro-4 engines, for a newer Opel."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"German carmakers have committed to updating engine management software to make emissions filtering systems operate more effectively. Carmakers had previously made liberal use of a ""thermal window"" loophole which allowed carmakers to throttle back exhaust emissions management systems in cold weather conditions."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"The move will affect 5.3 million cars at a cost of around 500 million euros, with the measures to be funded solely by industry. That includes 2.5 million VW cars that have already been recalled for software updates. The government said the software changes would cut the nitrogen oxide emissions of the affected cars by 30 percent by the end of 2018."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"However, environmental group DUH and a Stuttgart regional court have dismissed software updates as being inadequate solutions for tackling pollution. DUH has called the agreement ""a grandiose failure"", and said it would reduce nitrogen oxide missions by only 2 to 3 percent overall, since it affected less than 20 percent of Germany's 15 million diesel cars. The group said it would continue lawsuits in 16 cities."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"Environment minister Barbara Hendricks, from the centre-left SPD, said voluntary software updates can only be a first step, with a more thorough technical update of cars needed to avoid bans in the longer run. [nL5N1KJ2XB]"
Ford Motor,2017-8,The government will continue discussions with carmakers on the possible need for more fundamental retrofits - including the addition of extra exhaust-cleaning systems. Such measures are much more expensive than software updates - with the potential costs estimated by analysts as high as 10 billion euros.
Ford Motor,2017-8,"Germany's KBA vehicle certification authority, which has faced criticism it is not sufficiently independent, will tighten controls of emissions, introducing spot tests of vehicles that have already been approved. The measures were announced when the transport ministry published a report on VW last month."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"The agreement does not include a proposal to divide control of certification and emissions testing on the streets, which had been sought by the environment minister."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"The auto sector and the government will each contribute half to a 500 million euro fund aimed at helping local governments reduce pollution, including introducing systems to improve traffic flows and improve public transport. [nFWN1KI106]"
Ford Motor,2017-8,"Support for electric buses increased to 100 million euros a year, plus extra backing for hybrid and natural gas buses. Financial incentives to help municipalities and taxi operators fund a switch to electric vehicles are being put in place."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"Goal for next legislative period is to create a nationwide network of 50,000 charging points for electric vehicles as well as changes planned to property law to make it easier to install charging points in private buildings."
Ford Motor,2017-8,Support will be provided for trains powered by hydrogen and fuel cells as well as more cash for cycle paths. ($1 = 0.8516 euros)

Ford Motor,2017-8,"Without the injunction, Takata said the litigation would distract management from completing the sale of the company's viable operations to Key Safety Systems for $1.6 billion and could threaten the supply of air bag inflators to replace recalled ones."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"Plaintiffs' lawyers called the requested injunction ""an abuse of the bankruptcy laws for the benefit of all of the world's largest automobile manufacturers."" They said Takata's request would delay consideration of plaintiff's lawsuits for six months or more, which would be a very long time for the plaintiffs."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"The official bankruptcy committee that represents injured drivers said in court papers the injunction would have ""human consequences"" and prevent people from pursuing compensation."

Ford Motor,2017-8,"Without the injunction, Takata said the litigation would distract management from completing the sale of the company's viable operations to Key Safety Systems for $1.6 billion and could threaten the supply of air bag inflators to replace recalled ones."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"Plaintiffs' lawyers called the requested injunction ""an abuse of the bankruptcy laws for the benefit of all of the world's largest automobile manufacturers."" They said Takata's request would delay consideration of plaintiff's lawsuits for six months or more, which would be a very long time for the plaintiffs."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"The official bankruptcy committee that represents injured drivers said in court papers the injunction would have ""human consequences"" and prevent people from pursuing compensation."

Ford Motor,2017-8,"BERLIN, Aug 8 (Reuters) - Volkswagen is offering buyers trading in an older diesel car up to 10,000 euros ($11,810) off the price of a cleaner model, joining other automakers on Tuesday in a push to cut pollution."
Ford Motor,2017-8,Carmakers pledged such incentives last week in a deal with German officials to overhaul software in more than 5 million diesel cars to try to avert a ban on diesel fuelled vehicles after the emissions cheating scandal. [nL5N1KO14A]
Ford Motor,2017-8,"Rebates announced on Tuesday across the VW group range from 2,000 to 10,000 euros at the core VW brand, 3,000 euros to 10,000 euros at its luxury division Audi and 5,000 euros at sportscar maker Porsche."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"BMW , Daimler and Ford have also offered incentives to switch to newer, cleaner cars."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"The VW incentives are valid to the end of the year and its customers can gain additional discounts of 1,000 to 2,380 euros for buying alternative energy cars including electric, hybrid and natural gas-powered vehicles, VW said."
Ford Motor,2017-8,VW's emissions test cheating - exposed by U.S. regulators almost two years ago - led to wider revelations that diesel vehicles from most manufacturers release far more toxic nitrogen oxides (NOx) on the road than in laboratory tests.

Ford Motor,2017-8,"{{20170808T153025.209+0000}}FACTBOX-Germany, carmakers agree steps to cut diesel pollutionAug 8 (Reuters) - German ministers, regional politicians and car executives have agreed a package of measures aimed at cutting inner-city air pollution and averting bans on diesel cars. [nL5N1KO14A]"
Ford Motor,2017-8,Following are some of the key points of the agreement:
Ford Motor,2017-8,"As a way to take older, polluting cars off the road, carmakers have agreed to offer trade-in deals for older diesel cars if customers then switch to newer, cleaner models."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"Ford announced it will pay owners of vehicles with Euro-1, Euro-2 or Euro-3 emission-standard engines a bonus of between 2,000 and 8,000 euros ($2,348 to $9,394) if they trade in their old cars by end of 2017."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"Mercedes-Benz said it would offer customers in Europe up to 2,000 euros for trading in older diesels equipped with engines built to meet the Euro-1 to Euro-4 emissions standards in exchange for a newer Mercedes. A trade-in discount of 1,000 euros will be offered to customers buying an electric Smart car."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"Volkswagen said it would offer trade-in discounts of between 2,000 and 10,000 euros for its own-brand cars, depending on the vehicle. For older diesel versions of the VW Golf, a 5,000 euro incentive is being offered."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"VW's premium devision Audi said it would offer between 3,000 and 10,000 euros to trade in cars with Euro-4 engines for newer cars, while sister brand Porsche said it would offer up to 5,000 euros."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"VW's Seat brand will offer trade-in discounts of between 1,750 euros and 8,000 euros depending on the model."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"German carmakers have committed to updating engine management software to make emissions filtering systems operate more effectively. Carmakers had previously made liberal use of a ""thermal window"" loophole which allowed carmakers to throttle back exhaust emissions management systems in cold weather conditions."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"The move will affect 5.3 million cars at a cost of around 500 million euros, with the measures to be funded solely by industry. That includes 2.5 million VW cars that have already been recalled for software updates. The government said the software changes would cut the nitrogen oxide emissions of the affected cars by 30 percent by the end of 2018."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"However, environmental group DUH and a Stuttgart regional court have dismissed software updates as being inadequate solutions for tackling pollution. DUH has called the agreement ""a grandiose failure"", and said it would reduce nitrogen oxide missions by only 2 to 3 percent overall, since it affected less than 20 percent of Germany's 15 million diesel cars. The group said it would continue lawsuits in 16 cities."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"Environment minister Barbara Hendricks, from the centre-left SPD, said voluntary software updates can only be a first step, with a more thorough technical update of cars needed to avoid bans in the longer run. [nL5N1KJ2XB]"
Ford Motor,2017-8,The government will continue discussions with carmakers on the possible need for more fundamental retrofits - including the addition of extra exhaust-cleaning systems. Such measures are much more expensive than software updates - with the potential costs estimated by analysts as high as 10 billion euros.
Ford Motor,2017-8,"Germany's KBA vehicle certification authority, which has faced criticism it is not sufficiently independent, will tighten controls of emissions, introducing spot tests of vehicles that have already been approved. The measures were announced when the transport ministry published a report on VW last month."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"The agreement does not include a proposal to divide control of certification and emissions testing on the streets, which had been sought by the environment minister."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"The auto sector and the government will each contribute half to a 500 million euro fund aimed at helping local governments reduce pollution, including introducing systems to improve traffic flows and improve public transport. [nFWN1KI106]"
Ford Motor,2017-8,"Support for electric buses increased to 100 million euros a year, plus extra backing for hybrid and natural gas buses. Financial incentives to help municipalities and taxi operators fund a switch to electric vehicles are being put in place."

Ford Motor,2017-8,"{{20170808T093022.247+0000}}ANALYSIS-Autonomous cars race narrows on doubts about clear path to profit* Carmakers look to spread investment burden, risk"
Ford Motor,2017-8,"FRANKFURT/DETROIT, Aug 8 (Reuters) - BMW and Daimler , the world's top luxury carmakers, have announced alliances with suppliers, talking up the virtues of having a bigger pool of engineers to develop a self-driving car."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"But another motive behind these deals, executives and industry experts told Reuters, is a concern that robocars may not live up to the profit expectations that drove an initial investment rush."
Ford Motor,2017-8,Carmakers are increasingly looking to forego outright ownership of future autonomous driving systems in favour of spreading the investment burden and risk.
Ford Motor,2017-8,"The trend represents a clear shift in strategy from little more than a year ago when most automakers were pursuing standalone strategies focussed on tackling the engineering challenge of developing a self-driving car, rather than on the business case."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"""Although it is a substantial market, it may not be worth the scale of investments currently being sunk into it,"" said a board member at one of the German carmakers, who declined to be identified because the matter is confidential."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"Dozens of companies - including carmakers and tech firms like Google and Uber - are vying for a market which, according to consulting firm Frost & Sullivan, will only make up about 10 to 15 percent of vehicles in Europe by 2030. There are sure to be losers."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"""It's impossible for me to believe there will be 50 successful autonomous vehicle software producers,"" said John Hoffecker, global vice chairman of Michigan-based consulting firm AlixPartners."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"In July last year, BMW became the first major carmaker to abandon its solo development of self-driving cars in favour of teaming up with chipmaker Intel and camera and software manufacturer Mobileye to build a platform for autonomous cars technology by 2021."
Ford Motor,2017-8,The decision followed a trip by senior executives to visit startups and suppliers to gauge BMW's competitive position.
Ford Motor,2017-8,"""Sitting at other companies, one rattles off the technological challenges and safety aspects, and you come to realise that many of us are swimming in the same sludge,"" Klaus Buettner, BMW's vice president autonomous driving projects, told Reuters."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"""Everybody is investing billions. Our view was that it makes sense to club together to develop some core systems as a platform."""

Ford Motor,2017-8,Even deep-pocketed tech companies are teaming up. San Francisco-based transport app operator Lyft and Alphabet Inc's self-driving car unit Waymo pooled their resources in May. [nL2N1IH02T]
Ford Motor,2017-8,"Partial autonomy is already a reality in higher-end cars that keep in lane and adjust their speed in motorway driving. Each of the next stages - ""eyes off"", ""mind off"" and ultimately driverless autonomy - will likely take years to become reality."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"Klaus Froehlich, BMW's board member responsible for development, said the company was likely to lose money with its first fully autonomous vehicles, just like it did with its first-generation electric cars. But developing the technology remains a necessity in order to stay relevant as a carmaker."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"""It is an enabling technology, not a business case,"" he said about BMW's decision to develop autonomous vehicles. ""But if the burden can be shared on a platform, I have nothing against that."""
Ford Motor,2017-8,"One of the most financially promising markets that autonomous technology will open up is driverless on-demand taxis, which may one day come to replace regular cabs and parts of public transport in large cities."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"""Robotaxis"" are expected to drive the wider market for car sharing and ride-hailing, which was worth $53 billion last year and could be worth $2 trillion by 2030, according to a McKinsey study published earlier this year."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"Ford and General Motors are investing at least $2 billion each to develop self-driving vehicles for urban ride-sharing fleets beginning in 2021, competing with incumbents and start-ups."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"The emergence of alliances involving the likes of BMW and Mercedes-Benz comes at a time when regulators are pushing for a creation of standards for the new technology, which has the potential to improve vehicle reflexes and cut accidents by up to 90 percent, according to Boston Consulting Group."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"Industry experts say such standardisation could make it much harder to develop a product which stands out, calling into question the wisdom of high-stakes, go-it-alone strategies."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"In September 2016, the U.S. Department of Transport and the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration released guidance for heavily automated vehicles."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"The regulator urged carmakers to disclose how vehicle reflexes are programmed, particularly when cars are faced with a dilemma, such as choosing between hitting a cyclist or accelerating beyond legal speeds to avoid an accident."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"""It is important to consider whether highly automated vehicles are required to apply particular decision rules in instances of conflicts between safety, mobility, and legality objectives,"" the guidance said."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"""Algorithms for resolving these conflict situations should be developed transparently using input from federal and state regulators, drivers and passengers."""
Ford Motor,2017-8,European regulators too are debating whether to standardise speeds and distances which autonomous cars need to adhere to while weaving in and out of traffic or joining lanes.
Ford Motor,2017-8,"Pressure not to waste development costs is laying the groundwork for alliances and even mergers between the various companies supplying technology for autonomous cars, including makers of vehicles, software, computer chips, radar, camera and laser sensors and high-definition maps."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"BMW, Mercedes and Audi put aside their rivalry and teamed up to buy mapping firm HERE, for example, in order to cut their dependence on Google."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"What starts out as arms-length agreements designed to capture market share, much like code-sharing deals between airlines, may evolve further into takeovers once the next investment round is due, executives and advisers said."

Ford Motor,2017-8,"NEW YORK, Aug 3 (Reuters) - The number of planned layoffs at U.S. companies dropped in July to its lowest since November while job-opening announcements notched up, a sign that businesses are confident that the economy will continue to expand, a report released Thursday showed."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"U.S. companies announced 28,307 planned job cuts in July, a 9 percent decline from 31,105 in June and the lowest since November, according to outplacement consultancy Challenger, Gray & Christmas Inc."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"Overall, July's job cuts were down 37.6 percent from 45,346 a year earlier."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"Meanwhile, employers made plans to hire 88,000 workers, the highest July total on record and the third-highest total of the year, according to the report."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"""Maybe some of these hiring announcements are just some of the exuberance that comes late in an expansion,"" Challenger, Gray & Christmas Chief Executive Officer John Challenger said in an interview. ""But it may also be that some of the decision makers who decide whether to build a new plant or launch a new product or hire new people are becoming more comfortable that the recession is not imminent."""
Ford Motor,2017-8,"Despite low unemployment, there is slack in the system, leaving ample opportunity for employers to pick up skilled workers, Challenger said."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"The so-called U6 unemployment rate, which measures the share of discouraged, part-time or underemployed workers in the economy, is at 8.6 percent, higher than the unemployment rate of 4.3 percent."

Ford Motor,2017-8,"However, environmentalists said the plan - almost two years after Volkswagen admitted to cheating U.S. diesel emissions tests - was too little, too late, and vowed to press ahead with legal action aimed at banning polluting vehicles."
Ford Motor,2017-8,Chancellor Angela Merkel's government has come under mounting pressure for not doing enough to crack down on vehicle pollution and for being too close to powerful carmakers.
Ford Motor,2017-8,"The issue has become a central campaign topic ahead of next month's national election, prompting the government to summon car bosses to try to avert moves in some cities to force bans on diesel vehicles. [nL5N1KJ2XB]"
Ford Motor,2017-8,"Justice Minister Heiko Maas said the agreement was only a first step, warning that bans on diesel vehicles could not be ruled out and urging car makers to focus more on consumers."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"""The legal requirements for clean air remain in effect,"" he told Thursday editions of Germany's daily newspaper Bild."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"Ministers have been wary of angering the owners of 15 million diesel vehicles and damaging an industry that is the country's biggest exporter and provides about 800,000 jobs."
Ford Motor,2017-8,Politicians stopped short of demanding costly mechanical modifications to engine and exhaust systems and said they had agreed for now on software updates for 5.3 million cars.
Ford Motor,2017-8,"""We expect a new culture of responsibility from carmakers,"" Environment Minister Barbara Hendricks, from the centre-left Social Democrats, told a news conference, also adding the software updates were just a first step in cutting emissions."

Ford Motor,2017-8,"Hendricks criticised the VDA automakers lobby for putting out a statement proclaiming a deal two hours before ministers spoke to the media. She added the VDA's comment that the deal was ""unique in Europe and the world"" lacked humility."

Ford Motor,2017-8,"Meanwhile, top German manufacturers BMW , Daimler , Audi , Porsche and VW are being investigated by European regulators for alleged anti-competitive collusion."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"The DUH environmental group said the initiative had failed as software updates would only result in a cut of about 2-3 percent of emissions of toxic nitrogen oxides (NOx), adding it would pursue court cases for diesel bans in 16 cities."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"""Today's summit is bad news for hundred of thousands of people who will get sick and 10,600 who will die prematurely due to NOx each year,"" DUH head Juergen Resch said in a statement."

Ford Motor,2017-8,"""The car industry knows it has lost a lot of trust. We must and will work on winning back that trust,"" VDA president Matthias Wissmann said."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt said a refusal by foreign carmakers to participate in the plan was ""completely unacceptable""."
Ford Motor,2017-8,Carmakers also agreed to fund incentives aimed at encouraging consumers to trade in older diesel cars that cannot be helped with software updates.

Ford Motor,2017-8,{{20170802T174218.433+0000}}Auto workers' union rolls the dice at Nissan's Mississippi plantBy Nick Carey
Ford Motor,2017-8,"CANTON, Miss., Aug 2 (Reuters) - For nearly a decade, the United Auto Workers union has tried to organize workers at Nissan Motor Co Ltd's <7201.T> assembly plant here, challenging the company's wages, safety record and commitment to treating African-American workers fairly."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"Starting Thursday, the roughly 4,000 workers at one of Mississippi's largest industrial employers will cast their votes, affecting not only their own futures but the union's as well."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"Another failure to organize a southern auto factory would leave the UAW weakened ahead of contract negotiations with the Detroit Three automakers in 2019, when many analysts forecast U.S. auto sales will be in a cyclical slump."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"The organizing vote, which the UAW called for last month, has divided workers at the Canton plant, which builds Nissan Murano sport utility vehicles, commercial vans and Titan and Frontier pickup trucks."
Ford Motor,2017-8,Pro-union workers said the plant has a record of poor safety and complain that the company moved to a 401(k) defined contribution plan from a traditional plan.
Ford Motor,2017-8,"""This is not about wages, I'm concerned about safety issues at the plant and about my pension,"" says Patricia Ruffian, 51. ""They say if we vote for the union we're going to have nothing, we have to start from scratch, and that's not true."""
Ford Motor,2017-8,"The UAW also claims Nissan has illegally threatened workers that if they vote for the union, the plant will close. Based on those claims, the U.S. National Labor Relations Board has issued a number of complaints that Nissan has made that threat a number of times in recent years. The automaker denies the allegations. The outcome of the election could be contested, leading to a test of how the Trump-era NLRB will handle contentious labor issues."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"Rodney Francis, director of Human Resources at Nissan's Canton plant, said, ""Labor rights are about the right to organize, or not to organize. All we've been doing is providing employees with the facts so they can make an informed decision and at the end of the day this is about what they choose."""
Ford Motor,2017-8,"Nissan has strong supporters on the factory floor, who point to the history of problems at Detroit's unionized automakers and reject the UAW's arguments that black workers are not treated fairly."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"""Black people are doing much better here since Nissan came,"" said Tony Jacobson, 52, who is black. He has worked at the plant since it opened in 2003 and makes $28 per hour - comparable to the top rate for unionized workers at General Motors Co or Ford Motor Co . ""I'm trying to save our livelihoods, I don't want Canton to be like Detroit."""
Ford Motor,2017-8,"The UAW, like other large industrial unions, has struggled to expand membership as manufacturers have moved jobs overseas or to states like Mississippi that allow workers to shun union membership even in union shops."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"The union has organized smaller auto suppliers in the U.S. south, but has failed for decades to organize all the workers at a major southern auto-assembly plant. Politicians in the region have used low unionization as a selling point to attract more manufacturing investment."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"""If the union wins, it will encourage other in the South to unionize,"" Vanderbilt University labor analyst Daniel Cornfield said. ""If the company wins, it will make it more difficult for the UAW to organize elsewhere in the South."""
Ford Motor,2017-8,"Scott Waller, president of the Mississippi Economic Council (MEC), the state's chamber of commerce, says Nissan has ""changed the landscape"" in Mississippi. Nissan was the first automaker to locate a major assembly plant in the state, but since Mississippi won the contest for the factory in 2000, it has secured significant investments by other automotive giants like Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T> and Continental AG ."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"The number of auto workers in the state rose to 18,000 in 2016, from 11,000 in 2010. Government statistics show the average Mississippi auto worker earned $50,510 in 2016, 34 percent above the state average."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"A vote for union representation at Nissan's Canton plant ""could affect that plant's ability to compete and Mississippi's ability to compete in the realm of economic development,"" Waller said."
Ford Motor,2017-8,The union has connected the pay issue to its argument that Nissan is undermining progress on civil rights.
Ford Motor,2017-8,"""There's a huge race issue there, there's an issue of civil rights and the history of Mississippi plays into that narrative,"" UAW Secretary-Treasurer Gary Casteel said in an interview."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"Dolphus Weary, co-chair of community organization Move Mississippi Forward and a long-term black campaigner for racial unity, said he doesn't see it that way. He recounts visiting a manufacturing plant in the 1960s where the only black workers were janitors."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"When he visited Nissan's Canton plant, Weary says ""my antenna were up looking for the same situation"" but instead he found a plant where 46 percent of the managers were black."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"""This is the new Mississippi,"" Weary says of the plant. ""I don't think old arguments from 50 years ago will help move us forward."""
Ford Motor,2017-8,"But Reverend Isiac Jackson, pastor of the Liberty Missionary Baptist Church in Canton, said management at Nissan's plant has worked to prevent employees from voting on union representation, which is reminiscent of the time when Mississippi's leaders tried to prevent black citizens from voting."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"""Now just let everybody vote,"" he said. ""And if they vote against a union then everybody will go about their business."""

Ford Motor,2017-8,Grundler had a leading role in crafting the Obama administration rule requiring automakers to roughly double new- vehicle fuel efficiency - and cut greenhouse gas emissions - in stages between 2012 and 2025.
Ford Motor,2017-8,"In March, President Donald Trump ordered a review of U.S. vehicle fuel-efficiency standards from 2022 to 2025 put in place under former President Barack Obama, saying they were too tough on the auto industry. The review must be finalized by April 2018."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"In 2011, officials said the rules would save motorists $1.7 trillion in fuel costs over the life of the vehicles but cost the auto industry about $200 billion over 13 years."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"The U.S. Transportation Department said last week it may revise fuel-efficiency requirements starting with the 2021 model year, a year earlier than previously disclosed, and was studying the impact of freezing standards through 2025. The White House has held meetings with automakers to discuss the 2025 review. [nL1N1KG0JS]"
Ford Motor,2017-8,"Under current rules, fleetwide average fuel economy is expected to be around 41 miles per gallon in 2021, compared with an average of nearly 50 miles per gallon in 2025."
Ford Motor,2017-8,California opposes weakening the rules and threatened to pursue tougher standards unilaterally. Other states have also pledged court fights. Automakers want a national standard that will allow them to plan investments in new vehicles and technology.
Ford Motor,2017-8,"Mitch Bainwol, chief executive of the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a trade group representing General Motors Co , Volkswagen AG and others, said the only issue was how much requirements should rise."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"""We all want to get to a compromise deal,"" Bainwol said. ""We're not talking about a monumental shift in regulatory policy or outcomes."""
Ford Motor,2017-8,"Annette Hebert, a senior official with the California Air Resource Board, said her agency did not plan to relax its 2025 standards. California wants to hold talks with automakers on standards that reach beyond 2025."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"""We need to have a sense of urgency about this,"" said John Bozzella, president of Global Automakers, a trade group representing foreign automakers including Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T> and Hyundai Motor Co <005380.KS> at the forum."

Ford Motor,2017-8,"DETROIT, Aug 1 (Reuters) - U.S. carmakers said on Tuesday they continued to slash low-margin sales to daily rental fleets in July as the overall pace of U.S. car and light truck sales fell for the fifth straight month."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"The annualized pace of U.S. car and light truck sales in July fell to 16.73 million vehicles, down from 17.8 million vehicles a year earlier, according to Autodata Corp, which tracks industry sales."
Ford Motor,2017-8,Investors sold shares in the Detroit Three automakers on Tuesday. General Motors Co fell about 3.5 percent and Ford Motor Co slid about 2.5 percent.
Ford Motor,2017-8,"Several major automakers, including GM, Ford, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles , Nissan Motor Co <7201.T> and Hyundai Motor Co<005380.KS> said they sharply reduced rental car sales in July, and they portrayed the decisions as putting profit ahead of sales volume."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"Automakers have used low-margin sales to rental fleets to avoid factory shutdowns. With more flexible labor agreements, the Detroit automakers have shifted course. They are quicker to idle factories to reduce supply, and they are demanding higher prices, industry officials said. Fiat Chrysler has killed several models it once sold to fleets."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"Big U.S. rental car companies such as Hertz Global Holdings Inc and Avis Budget Car Rental [CARXXB.UL] at the same time are restructuring their fleets as values decline for rental cars they resell, and as ride services such as Uber Technologies [UBER.UL] bite into their business. [nL1N1JN1E4]"
Ford Motor,2017-8,"In a more troubling sign for Detroit, combined sales of large pickups fell 4 percent, and sales of large sport utility vehicles declined by 20 percent. Only the Ford F-series, up 6 percent, improved on year-ago results among major truck models."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"Declining sales could leave the Detroit Three with too many plants in North America, Jeff Schuster, a forecaster with LMC Automotive, said on Tuesday at an industry conference in Traverse City, Mich. The decline in July's annual sales pace from a year ago equates to the output of four assembly plants."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"GM gained little ground in its effort to reduce inventories of unsold vehicles. The automaker had 104 days of supply at the end of July, down from 105 days at the end of June. GM has promised investors to reduce inventories to 70 days by year-end. [nL1N1KG0CT]"
Ford Motor,2017-8,"Ford said July sales fell 7.5 percent, but inventory fell to 77 days from 79 the previous month. Fiat Chrysler said sales dropped 10 percent."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"Among the top Japanese companies, only Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T> reported a year-to-year gain, with sales up 4 percent. Honda Motor Co <7267.T> sales fell 1 percent, and Nissan sales fell 3 percent."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"GM, Ford and Fiat Chrysler have said second-half financial results likely will be lower than first-half results, in part reflecting production cuts in North America and pricing pressures. [nL1N1KH12N]"

Ford Motor,2017-8,{{20170801T155756.109+0000}}CORRECTED-UPDATE 8-Kremlin orders Washington to slash embassy staff in Russia(Corrects paragraph 17 to show ambassador said local staff need to have served 15 years to be eligible to apply for special visas)
Ford Motor,2017-8,"MOSCOW, July 31 (Reuters) - The Kremlin has ordered the United States to cut about 60 percent of its diplomatic staff in Russia but many of those let go will be Russian citizens, softening the impact of a measure adopted in retaliation for new U.S. sanctions."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"The ultimatum issued by Russian President Vladimir Putin is a display to voters at home that he is prepared to stand up to Washington, but is also carefully calibrated to avoid directly affecting the U.S. investment he needs, or burning his bridges with his U.S. opposite number Donald Trump."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"Putin said on Sunday Russia had ordered the United States to cut 755 of its 1,200 embassy and consulate staff by September, and was seizing two diplomatic properties."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"The cuts will affect embassy and consular operations, but allowing the United States to choose who leaves means a smaller impact than expelling U.S. diplomats from Russia."
Ford Motor,2017-8,The measures were announced after the U.S. Congress overwhelmingly approved new sanctions to respond to Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and to punish Russia further for its 2014 annexation of Crimea from Ukraine. [nL5N1KJ35N] The White House said on Friday that Trump would sign the sanctions bill.
Ford Motor,2017-8,"Speaking to troops in Tallinn, Estonia, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence called Russia's actions ""drastic"" but said Washington would continue with its sanctions until Moscow stopped its ""destabilizing activities in Ukraine and elsewhere."""
Ford Motor,2017-8,"Trump did not comment on the expulsions on Monday. ""Right now, we're reviewing our options, and when we have something to say, we'll let you know,"" his spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told reporters."
Ford Motor,2017-8,Staff at the U.S. embassy in Moscow were on Monday summoned to an all-hands meeting where Ambassador John F. Tefft briefed employees on the Russian decision - the toughest diplomatic demarche between the two countries since the Cold War.
Ford Motor,2017-8,"""The atmosphere was like a funeral,"" said one person present, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he is not authorised to talk to the media."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"Forcing the United States to scale back its diplomatic presence will reinforce Putin's reputation at home as a resolute defender of Russia's interests. That will help burnish his image before next year's presidential election, when he is expected to seek another term."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"Putin said on Sunday he saw no sign of better relations with the United States, and held out the possibility of more measures to come."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"The consequences of the Russian retaliation are not so stark that it would permanently alienate Trump, according to Alexander Baunov, a senior fellow at the Moscow Carnegie Center, a think tank."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"By announcing his counter-measures before Trump signed the sanctions legislation into law, ""Putin is sending a message that he is punishing Congress's America, and not Trump's America,"" Baunov wrote in a Facebook post."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"""(Putin) has taken Trump out of the direct line of fire and spared his ego."""
Ford Motor,2017-8,"Absent from the Russian retaliation were any measures that directly target U.S. investment in Russia. U.S. bluechip companies such as Ford, Citi and Boeing have projects in the country, bringing the kind of investment the Kremlin needs to lift a sluggish economic recovery."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"Embassy employees in Moscow on Monday anxiously waited to hear if they would keep their jobs. Tefft described the Russian decision as unfair, but provided no details about the cuts, a person at the meeting told Reuters."
Ford Motor,2017-8,The ambassador said Russian staff who were let go and had served at least 15 years could apply for a special immigration visa to the United States.
Ford Motor,2017-8,"""People asked what Russian staff should do now, since a lot of Russian people working for the embassy are blacklisted and cannot find a job in Russian companies,"" said the person present."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"One area likely to be cut is the office that issues visas to Russian citizens seeking to travel to the United States, according to a former U.S. ambassador to Moscow, Michael McFaul."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"""If these cuts are real, Russians should expect to wait weeks if not months to get visas to come to U.S.,"" McFaul wrote in a Twitter post on Sunday."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"Moscow's response included a vow to seize a U.S. warehouse in southern Moscow and a country villa, or dacha, on the outskirts of the city used by embassy staff on the weekends."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"On Monday, a Reuters journalist saw five vehicles with diplomatic license plates, including a cargo truck, arrive at the dacha. The convoy was refused access."

Ford Motor,2017-8,"BERLIN, Aug 1 (Reuters) - The German government will not force the car industry to make costly changes to engines to cut diesel emissions but will settle for software updates for around 2 million vehicles, industry and government sources said on Tuesday."
Ford Motor,2017-8,The sources were speaking before a summit of politicians and car executives scheduled for Wednesday to discuss ways to cut inner-city pollution to try to head off bans on diesel cars -- a sensitive issue ahead of national elections next month.
Ford Motor,2017-8,The summit must also start to restore the reputation of one of Germany's major industries which has been badly tarnished since the Volkswagen emissions scandal broke in September 2015. [nL5N1KM2R7]
Ford Motor,2017-8,"The auto industry has agreed to software updates for around 2 million cars that will cost around 300 million euros ($354 million), a government source said. An industry source said foreign car makers had not agreed to participate for now."
Ford Motor,2017-8,The deal suggests the industry has headed off demands for hardware upgrades that would cut more pollution but would also be much more expensive - with the potential costs as high as 10 billion euros.
Ford Motor,2017-8,"The deal also foresees a range of other measures to reduce emissions, the sources said, such as subsidies for electric buses, taxis and other municipal vehicles, as well as a commitment to increase the number of charging stations."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"The sector and the government will each contribute half to a 500 million euro fund aimed at helping local governments reduce pollution, blamed for causing respiratory diseases."
Ford Motor,2017-8,The compromise might not cut emissions enough to stop bans of diesel cars in German cities - like the one in Stuttgart confirmed by a regional court last week. [nL5N1KJ2XB]
Ford Motor,2017-8,"DUH, the environmental lobby group that brought the Stuttgart case, has said it wants moves to go beyond voluntary software updates or it will take further legal action."
Ford Motor,2017-8,Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives have come under fire from consumer and environmental groups as well as opposition lawmakers for their close links to carmakers.
Ford Motor,2017-8,"""The car industry can always rely on the support of the government when things get difficult,"" said Timo Lange, a campaigner with LobbyControl, a non-profit group."
Ford Motor,2017-8,Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt rejected suggestions on Tuesday that he is too closely tied to the industry. [nL5N1KN231]
Ford Motor,2017-8,The Environment Ministry has already made clear that software improvements can only be a first step as they reduce nitrogen oxide emissions by about 25 percent on average.
Ford Motor,2017-8,"The government is also demanding that auto makers finance their own schemes to encourage drivers to switch to newer, cleaner models, an implicit rejection of calls by some politicians for state subsidies."
Ford Motor,2017-8,"On Tuesday, Ford announced it will pay owners of older vehicles designed to meet the Euro-1, Euro-2 or Euro-3 emission standards a bonus between 2,000 euros and 8,000 euros if they trade in their old cars and buy a new model by the end of 2017. ($1 = 0.8466 euros)"
