Exxon,2017-2,"LONDON, Feb 28 (Reuters) - Iraq's Kurdistan has agreed new deals to borrow $3 billion from trading houses and Russian state oil firm Rosneft that will be guaranteed by future oil sales to strengthen its fiscal position as the semi-autonomous region fights Islamic State."
Exxon,2017-2,Kurdistan's natural sources minister Ashti Hawrami told Reuters the new deals had been concluded in recent weeks. The region also negotiated grace periods of between 3 and 5 years for repaying the debt.
Exxon,2017-2,Trading houses have been pre-financing Kurdish oil exports for the past two years after the government in Erbil decided to start independent oil exports via Turkey's Mediterranean terminals. Rosneft said last week it would join them. [nR4N1G100S].
Exxon,2017-2,Kurdistan says it needs to export oil independently as Baghdad has not paid Erbil its budget share just as the region needs money to fight Islamic State and host Syrian refugees.
Exxon,2017-2,"Baghdad has said it would sue buyers of Kurdish oil, arguing that the central government was the only legal exporter. The new Baghdad government has softened its stance, however, as it cooperated with Erbil against Islamic State in Mosul."
Exxon,2017-2,"""This helps our economic independence although it is important to understand that this cannot be achieved just by oil revenues and higher oil prices. We also need to press on with our economic reforms,"" Hawrami said in an interview in London."
Exxon,2017-2,"He declined to name the trading houses but market sources have previously identified Vitol, Petraco, Glencore and Trafigura as buyers of Kurdish barrels. Last week, Glencore confirmed it had concluded deals for Kurdish oil. The other trading houses do not comment on their dealings with Kurdistan and Rosneft did not give any details on the size of the deal."
Exxon,2017-2,Hawrami said the deals would serve as a hedge against an oil price slide for several years. Previous deals with trading houses have usually lasted 6-12 months.
Exxon,2017-2,"""It is also positive for the traders as they don't have to renegotiate their contracts every six months,"" said Hawrami."
Exxon,2017-2,"""It strengthens our fiscal situation. It means we can pay more regularly to the international oil companies working in Kurdistan and we can invest some money in expanding our oil infrastructure,"" he said."
Exxon,2017-2,"Kurdistan's finances suffered badly during the oil price slump of 2015-2016 and it has accumulated several months of arrears to producers such as Genel , DNO and Gulf Keystone due to tight revenues and supply glitches."
Exxon,2017-2,"""This year we want to avoid repeating this. I'm confident we will do better. We know the producers' needs and plans. We are prioritizing not to fall behind again,"" Hawrami said."
Exxon,2017-2,Hawrami said the arrival of Rosneft in addition to trading houses to the marketing of Kurdish barrels was good news for the region as it gave Erbil its first big end-user and opened up new markets - Rosneft has refineries in Germany and India.
Exxon,2017-2,"""We hope Rosneft's deal will become a ground breaker for other majors,"" he said adding Rosneft was also looking at exploration blocks in Kurdistan."
Exxon,2017-2,"""We didn't hear any negative comments from them after the deal with Rosneft. They know we are selling our oil. And actually if we help each other rather than hindering progress, we can both achieve better prices as buyers will not be able to seek unreasonable discounts."""
Exxon,2017-2,He also said the fact that Erbil was now selling some barrels for Baghdad from the northern Kirkuk field was evidence of improving relations.
Exxon,2017-2,"""In reality, Baghdad has given us some share of oil to export. So we have an arrangement that we both honour. We have real cooperation and we hope to build on that,"" he said."
Exxon,2017-2,"Kurdistan's existing pipelines can handle just over 650,000 barrels per day of exports and more investments are needed to bring that capacity to 1 million bpd, including upgrading of pumping stations, said Hawrami."
Exxon,2017-2,He said pipeline capacity should be expanded by the year-end but production would not start rising until next year.
Exxon,2017-2,"""We have to be mindful about supply and demand. You tell me what the oil price is going to be and I will tell you when we could reach 1 million bpd of output. Investments have dried up in the last two years because of the oil price crash and attacks by ISIS,"" he said."
Exxon,2017-2,"Kurdistan is planning to offer some 20 blocks of land for exploration to investors. The region took some blocks back from investors after discovering they did little exploration, said Hawrami without naming the companies."
Exxon,2017-2,"Some operators relinquished blocks as they were disappointed with what they found, including U.S. oil giant Exxon Mobil which has given back three blocks out of six over the past year."
Exxon,2017-2,Hawrami said he did not see this as a set back.
Exxon,2017-2,"""Exxon has concluded that they will continue working on 3 blocks while on another three the potential reserves were simply not big enough for them. Those blocks could suit other firms. We are now looking to farm them out,"" he said."

Exxon,2017-2,"Feb 23 (Reuters) - Oil and gas producer Apache Corp said it would spend 63.2 percent more in 2017 than it did last year, joining a growing list of U.S. shale producers who are ramping up spending to take advantage of a recovery in oil prices."

Exxon,2017-2,"CALGARY, Alberta, Feb 24 (Reuters) - Canada's energy sector has fallen out of favor with international oil majors, who are scaling back ambitions and walking away from reserves in the ground there to focus on lower-cost and higher-margin opportunities elsewhere."
Exxon,2017-2,"Billion-dollar bets on Canada's oil sands went sour this week for Exxon Mobil Corp and Conoco Phillips . Between them, the two companies erased from their books nearly 5 billion barrels of bitumen, the heavy, viscous oil found under Alberta's boreal forest. This has wiped about $250 billion worth of oil from their reserves. [nL1N1G61S7] [nL1N1G723D]"
Exxon,2017-2,Conoco has put $2 billion of Canadian natural gas assets on the block. [nL1N1G1140]
Exxon,2017-2,The companies joined the list of foreign players to take a hit in a Canadian energy patch where a two-year slump in global oil prices has discouraged the high investments needed to get projects off the ground.
Exxon,2017-2,"While crude prices have recovered to above $50 a barrel from a low of $26 a year ago, that is not enough to make Canada's oil sands profitable. Even some of Canada's conventional energy plays are expensive at current crude prices."
Exxon,2017-2,"Canadian producer Husky Energy Inc , owned by Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing, is weighing the sale of some Eastern Canadian offshore crude assets, people familiar with the matter told Reuters. [nL1N1G916U]"
Exxon,2017-2,The oil sands have caused energy companies the most pain.
Exxon,2017-2,"Devon Energy Corp Chief Executive Officer Dave Hager summed up the problem this month when discussing the Pike oil sands project, which awaits a company decision later this year."
Exxon,2017-2,"""We like the project a lot, but ... it's a little bit lower return than our well-oriented programs here in the U.S.,"" Hager told analysts on an earnings call."
Exxon,2017-2,"Hager cited capital costs and uncertain future prices as factors behind the wariness of sinking funds into projects that take four years to build. Shale plays need less investment, produce cheaper oil and often provide a fatter return within months."
Exxon,2017-2,"President Donald Trump is also expected to loosen U.S. regulations for oil and gas companies, while the Canadian government has been planning a carbon tax."
Exxon,2017-2,"Statoil ASA sold its oil sands project and leases to Calgary-based Athabasca Oil Corp . CNOOC-owned <0883.HK> Nexen shut down its oil sands upgrader. Royal Dutch Shell abandoned its 80,000 barrel per day Carmon Creek project, taking a $2 billion write-down."
Exxon,2017-2,"""The oil sands are not as sexy as they used to be,"" said GMP FirstEnergy analyst Martin King. ""The focus is on the United States - there are more immediate returns and lower drilling costs."""
Exxon,2017-2,"In the days of $100 a barrel crude, and before the U.S. shale revolution, the oil sands were a red-hot play for investors, offering huge reserves, low decline rates and a stable political climate."
Exxon,2017-2,"Between 2005 and 2015 foreign direct investment in Canada's oil industry more than doubled to C$130 billion ($99.19 billion) from C$50 billion, according to Statistics Canada data. That slowed in 2015 as the crude price rout deepened."
Exxon,2017-2,"""You would assume it's still slowing down based on lower prices,"" said economist Carlos Murillo of the Conference Board of Canada."
Exxon,2017-2,"RS Energy Group analyst Rob Bedin noted that Suncor Energy's Fort Hills, the last of the oil sands mega-projects, needs U.S. crude prices around $100 a barrel to break even, compared with $40-$45 a barrel for shale plays in the Midland Basin, Texas."
Exxon,2017-2,"While oil sands growth is expected to slow dramatically, production is not expected to drop. Projects there, once built, are viewed as a useful addition to companies' portfolios. Day-to-day operating costs are reasonably low and they produce for decades."
Exxon,2017-2,"Two years ago, producer forecasts of 2026 oil sands production totalled 6 million bpd, according to RS Energy research, up from 2.5 million bpd currently."
Exxon,2017-2,"Last year producers dropped that 2026 forecast to 5 million bpd, but RS Energy analysis suggests 3.5 billion bpd is more realistic once company finances are taken into account."
Exxon,2017-2,"The fate of growth in the oil sands is primarily in the hands of the domestic Canadian producers like Suncor Energy and MEG Energy , which are still intent on developing their back-yard crude resource through improved technology and carefully planned small-scale expansions."
Exxon,2017-2,"Canadian reserve reporting rules, which allow the use of price forecasts from reserve evaluation firms, help domestic oil sands producers maintain a more positive outlook. The United States requires producers to report reserves based on last year's prices."
Exxon,2017-2,"Still, there are concerns even for oil sands specialists. These include low crude prices, environmental opposition to building new pipelines and government carbon emissions caps."
Exxon,2017-2,"Lack of pipeline capacity has in the past left crude bottlenecked in Alberta, but now that three major projects are finally moving forward there are doubts about whether there will be enough volume to fill them."
Exxon,2017-2,"Enbridge Inc CEO Al Monaco said two pipelines should suffice based on the current supply outlook, and the latest cuts in reserves may make it harder for projects like TransCanada Corp's Keystone XL to find enough shippers."
Exxon,2017-2,"""One pipeline is within (oil sands) projects already under construction,"" said University of Alberta energy economist Andrew Leach. ""Where it gets more speculative is if you get beyond one pipeline then your case starts to depend on some incremental growth into the next decade, which is not sanctioned and would not be on anyone's reserve books at this point.""

Exxon,2017-2,"ALGIERS, Feb 26 (Reuters) - Algeria's Sonatrach wants to start offshore oil drilling and has begun discussions with U.S. operators Exxon Mobil Corp and Anadarko as well as Italy's Eni , a source at the state energy company told Reuters on Sunday."
Exxon,2017-2,The North African OPEC member nation has struggled to attract oil investment in recent years because of tough terms that have made foreign companies wary.
Exxon,2017-2,Sonatrach last year began a more flexible approach to bilateral talks with foreign partners.
Exxon,2017-2,"Low oil prices have also pressured Sonatrach, prompting it to focus on developing production at more mature fields in the southern Sahara and bringing online delayed gas projects. Offshore drilling could offer another area for growth."
Exxon,2017-2,"""Seismic operations carried out by Sonatrach have shown an interesting potential in the areas including Bejaia and Oran,"" said the source, who asked not to be identified. Bejaia is an eastern port and Oran is a port city in western Algeria."
Exxon,2017-2,"Algeria needs the know-how and expertise of major international firms to launch offshore drilling, the source said."
Exxon,2017-2,"""Foreign partners, including Anadarko, Exxon Mobil and Eni were invited by Sonatrach to provide technical assistance given the experience they acquired in the Gulf of Mexico and deep water in Mozambique,"" the Sonatrach source said."
Exxon,2017-2,"""The offshore is complementary to our operations in the south. It will also contribute to boosting our output,"" the source said."
Exxon,2017-2,The source did not give any information on the timing or scale of any offshore projects.
Exxon,2017-2,"Such details, including when the drilling will start, are expected to be announced soon by Sonatrach's leadership, the source said."
Exxon,2017-2,Algeria's earnings from oil and gas fell to $27.5 billion in 2016 from $35.7 billion in 2015 and more than $60 billion in 2014.
Exxon,2017-2,"Algeria's oil output was previously estimated at 1.1 million barrels per day (bpd) but it has cut production by 50,000 bpd under an agreement between OPEC and non-OPEC producers aimed at raising crude prices."

Exxon,2017-2,"CALGARY, Alberta, Feb 24 (Reuters) - Canada's energy sector has fallen out of favor with international oil majors, who are scaling back ambitions and walking away from reserves in the ground there to focus on lower-cost and higher-margin opportunities elsewhere."
Exxon,2017-2,"Billion-dollar bets on Canada's oil sands went sour this week for Exxon Mobil Corp and Conoco Phillips . Between them, the two companies erased from their books nearly 5 billion barrels of bitumen, the heavy, viscous oil found under Alberta's boreal forest. This has wiped about $250 billion worth of oil from their reserves. [nL1N1G61S7] [nL1N1G723D]"
Exxon,2017-2,Conoco has put $2 billion of Canadian natural gas assets on the block. [nL1N1G1140]
Exxon,2017-2,The companies joined the list of foreign players to take a hit in a Canadian energy patch where a two-year slump in global oil prices has discouraged the high investments needed to get projects off the ground.
Exxon,2017-2,"While crude prices have recovered to above $50 a barrel from a low of $26 a year ago, that is not enough to make Canada's oil sands profitable. Even some of Canada's conventional energy plays are expensive at current crude prices."
Exxon,2017-2,"Canadian producer Husky Energy Inc , owned by Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing, is weighing the sale of some Eastern Canadian offshore crude assets, people familiar with the matter told Reuters. [nL1N1G916U]"
Exxon,2017-2,The oil sands have caused energy companies the most pain.
Exxon,2017-2,"Devon Energy Corp Chief Executive Officer Dave Hager summed up the problem this month when discussing the Pike oil sands project, which awaits a company decision later this year."
Exxon,2017-2,"""We like the project a lot, but ... it's a little bit lower return than our well-oriented programs here in the U.S.,"" Hager told analysts on an earnings call."
Exxon,2017-2,"Hager cited capital costs and uncertain future prices as factors behind the wariness of sinking funds into projects that take four years to build. Shale plays need less investment, produce cheaper oil and often provide a fatter return within months."
Exxon,2017-2,"President Donald Trump is also expected to loosen U.S. regulations for oil and gas companies, while the Canadian government has been planning a carbon tax."
Exxon,2017-2,"Statoil ASA sold its oil sands project and leases to Calgary-based Athabasca Oil Corp . CNOOC-owned <0883.HK> Nexen shut down its oil sands upgrader. Royal Dutch Shell abandoned its 80,000 barrel per day Carmon Creek project, taking a $2 billion write-down."
Exxon,2017-2,"""The oil sands are not as sexy as they used to be,"" said GMP FirstEnergy analyst Martin King. ""The focus is on the United States - there are more immediate returns and lower drilling costs."""
Exxon,2017-2,"In the days of $100 a barrel crude, and before the U.S. shale revolution, the oil sands were a red-hot play for investors, offering huge reserves, low decline rates and a stable political climate."
Exxon,2017-2,"Between 2005 and 2015 foreign direct investment in Canada's oil industry more than doubled to C$130 billion ($99.19 billion) from C$50 billion, according to Statistics Canada data. That slowed in 2015 as the crude price rout deepened."
Exxon,2017-2,"""You would assume it's still slowing down based on lower prices,"" said economist Carlos Murillo of the Conference Board of Canada."
Exxon,2017-2,"RS Energy Group analyst Rob Bedin noted that Suncor Energy's Fort Hills, the last of the oil sands mega-projects, needs U.S. crude prices around $100 a barrel to break even, compared with $40-$45 a barrel for shale plays in the Midland Basin, Texas."
Exxon,2017-2,"While oil sands growth is expected to slow dramatically, production is not expected to drop. Projects there, once built, are viewed as a useful addition to companies' portfolios. Day-to-day operating costs are reasonably low and they produce for decades."
Exxon,2017-2,"Two years ago, producer forecasts of 2026 oil sands production totalled 6 million bpd, according to RS Energy research, up from 2.5 million bpd currently."
Exxon,2017-2,"Last year producers dropped that 2026 forecast to 5 million bpd, but RS Energy analysis suggests 3.5 billion bpd is more realistic once company finances are taken into account."
Exxon,2017-2,"The fate of growth in the oil sands is primarily in the hands of the domestic Canadian producers like Suncor Energy and MEG Energy , which are still intent on developing their back-yard crude resource through improved technology and carefully planned small-scale expansions."
Exxon,2017-2,"Canadian reserve reporting rules, which allow the use of price forecasts from reserve evaluation firms, help domestic oil sands producers maintain a more positive outlook. The United States requires producers to report reserves based on last year's prices."
Exxon,2017-2,"Still, there are concerns even for oil sands specialists. These include low crude prices, environmental opposition to building new pipelines and government carbon emissions caps."
Exxon,2017-2,"Lack of pipeline capacity has in the past left crude bottlenecked in Alberta, but now that three major projects are finally moving forward there are doubts about whether there will be enough volume to fill them."
Exxon,2017-2,"Enbridge Inc CEO Al Monaco said two pipelines should suffice based on the current supply outlook, and the latest cuts in reserves may make it harder for projects like TransCanada Corp's Keystone XL to find enough shippers."
Exxon,2017-2,"""One pipeline is within (oil sands) projects already under construction,"" said University of Alberta energy economist Andrew Leach. ""Where it gets more speculative is if you get beyond one pipeline then your case starts to depend on some incremental growth into the next decade, which is not sanctioned and would not be on anyone's reserve books at this point.""

Exxon,2017-2,"Feb 21 (Reuters) - Wall Street is pushing back against a proposed rule to force U.S. banks like Goldman Sachs Group Inc to hold more capital against investments in commodities, placing what some see as an overly restrictive limit on banks' ties to the sector."
Exxon,2017-2,"In a comment letter filed late on Friday and not yet made public, the industry argues the proposed rule would hurt the economy, and that fears about environmental risks from physical commodities activities are overblown."
Exxon,2017-2,"The U.S. Federal Reserve handed down the proposal in September, after a public backlash stemming from the belief that big banks' involvement in commodities markets hurt consumers by driving up prices."
Exxon,2017-2,"The comment letter, filed by the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association and the Institution of International Bankers and seen by Reuters, comes as big banks face an uncertain future in Washington. Even though President Donald Trump has said he favors deregulation and has hired several Wall Street executives as advisers, it is unclear how he or the new Congress will approach various rules."
Exxon,2017-2,"Apart from Goldman Sachs, few banks have large exposure to physical commodities any longer. At one time, it was a big and lucrative business for both Goldman and Morgan Stanley , due to a quirk in their regulatory structure. Other banks, including JPMorgan Chase & Co , eventually plunged into the business as well, but exited as global capital requirements got more onerous, making such investments too costly to maintain."
Exxon,2017-2,"The Fed's proposed rule would formalize and increase those standards, imposing what it has called a 1,250 percent risk weighting on banks that own, trade and move physical commodities. Among other measures, $1 in capital would need to be held for every $1 investment, the regulator's highest charge for the riskiest investments."
Exxon,2017-2,"The rule could potentially force banks to withdraw from the commodities business altogether, because such capital charges would severely depress returns."
Exxon,2017-2,"In its proposal, the Fed said new measures would shield banks and the broader financial system from a costly mishap like the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. Advocates say the rule is also needed to help mitigate commodity price fluctuations and social conflicts that arise from commodity-related activities."
Exxon,2017-2,"In the letter filed on Friday, the bank-affiliated groups said the rule would hurt ""competition, end users, the liquidity of commodities markets ... and thus the real economy."" A number of utility and power companies, including Calpine Corp , have also cited liquidity and price concerns."
Exxon,2017-2,"Big banks have been using similar arguments in lobbying to roll back existing rules, including the Volcker rule limiting risky, speculative trading and the Durbin rule, which caps the fees they can charge retailers for processing debit card transactions. [nIFR8tqrNf] [nL1N1FT1R2]"
Exxon,2017-2,Industry sources say the fight against the Fed's proposal is more about regaining a competitive edge than protecting an existing source of revenue.
Exxon,2017-2,"Between 2007 and 2009, commodities trading accounted for as much as one-fifth of revenue for Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs."
Exxon,2017-2,"But over the past five years, Morgan Stanley has decreased its physical commodity assets to $179 million from $9.7 billion. Goldman Sachs has shed much of its energy infrastructure as well, though it is still a major trader of fossil fuels, trading more natural gas than both Chevron Corp and ExxonMobil Corp in certain quarters, according to Natural Gas Intelligence."

Exxon,2017-2,"""It is the first time in the history of Singapore that a budget has placed such a high emphasis on green initiatives linked to tax revenues,"" said Isabella Loh, chairman of the Singapore Environment Council, an independent non-profit body."
Exxon,2017-2,"""The announcement clearly underpins the priority of a future-ready and greener economy."""
Exxon,2017-2,"Countries around the world have been under increasing pressure to crack down on carbon emissions, with Singapore part of the historic Paris climate accord that went into force late last year."
Exxon,2017-2,"In parts of Europe and countries such as Australia, the introduction of carbon taxes or carbon trading schemes has often driven a decline in established refining industries and a parallel surge in investment in clean energy technology."
Exxon,2017-2,"""The proposed carbon tax on emitters would prove a significant drag on industry profit-margins,"" said Peter Lee, oil and gas analyst at BMI Research in Singapore."
Exxon,2017-2,"The government said the carbon tax would probably cover 30 to 40 ""large direct emitters"" including power stations, petrochemical facilities and semiconductor makers."
Exxon,2017-2,"But it is Singapore's three refineries, run by ExxonMobil , Royal Dutch Shell and Singapore Refining Company, that would probably need to brace for the hardest blow."
Exxon,2017-2,"The tax proposal comes as those refineries, with a combined fuel generation capacity of around 1.38 million barrels per day (bpd), grapple with rising competition from China, India and the Middle East ."
Exxon,2017-2,"Shell said in a statement it supported a strong and stable government-led carbon price, but that any policy ""must ensure companies can compete effectively with others in the region who are not subject to the same levels of carbon dioxide costs""."
Exxon,2017-2,"Exxon said ""effective policies are those that promote global participation (and) let market prices drive the selection of solutions""."
Exxon,2017-2,"Looking at a carbon tax rate of S$10 to $20 ($7 to $14) per tonne, the government estimated that would add around $3.50 to $7 to the cost of processing a barrel of crude into fuels like diesel or gasoline."
Exxon,2017-2,"Benchmark crude prices stood around $56 per barrel on Tuesday, translating to a daily surplus cost of $4.8 million to $9.7 million for the three Singapore refineries."
Exxon,2017-2,"On the flip side, the tax would help fire growth in Singapore's nascent renewable energy industries."
Exxon,2017-2,"""Existing green projects, such as solar, will enjoy the much needed premium (as they are not taxed),"" said Andrew Koscharsky, energy director at RCMA Group, which trades wholesale power and retail electricity in Singapore."

Exxon,2017-2,Feb 17 (Reuters) - U.S. shale producers are facing their first production cost increase in five years in 2017 as industry activity picks up and energy service providers hike fees to take a bigger share of the profits generated by higher oil prices.
Exxon,2017-2,Drilling innovations over the past decade have generated a dizzying reduction in the cost of pumping oil from shale formations across the United States - the world's largest energy consumer - triggering an energy revolution and a production boom.
Exxon,2017-2,"When that boom ended with the onset of a two-year global price war in 2014, shale producers responded with even deeper cost cuts. Technological breakthroughs allowed producers to wring more oil from the rock and halved the per-barrel price needed to turn a profit."
Exxon,2017-2,"But for the first time since 2012, shale producers will see a rise in break-even production costs this year, according to data from Rystad Energy, which surveys producers. The per-barrel costs will rise an average of $1.60 across the shale patch to $36.50."
Exxon,2017-2,"The drive to lower costs has run its course for now, and service firms are leveraging power in the more crowded oilfields, such as the Permian basin in West Texas, to eke out higher payments from producers."
Exxon,2017-2,"Firms that supply rigs, crews, technological expertise are clamoring to take back discounts they extended during the slump, in some cases asking for between 10 percent and 15 percent more as the number of rigs and crews deployed in the fields rises."
Exxon,2017-2,"""In the Permian, activity has picked up, and going forward we would expect to see some pressure,"" Chevron Corp's Chief Executive John Watson said on an earnings call last month."
Exxon,2017-2,"Oil service providers acknowledge, however, that their price hikes may not stick until drillers generate enough demand to burn through the remaining spare capacity in the oil service sector."
Exxon,2017-2,"In a securities filing on Feb. 8, service provider Baker Hughes Inc cautioned that drilling ""activity needs to increase meaningfully before excess service capacity can be substantially absorbed and meaningful pricing recovery takes place."""
Exxon,2017-2,"Service inflation represents only a fraction of the expected rise in international crude prices this year. A Reuters poll of 31 analysts and economists forecast benchmark U.S. oil prices will average $56.08 per barrel in 2017, up from $43.47 last year."
Exxon,2017-2,"Between half and two-thirds of the cost savings achieved during the oil price slump are likely to become permanent even if oil prices tick higher, according to industry experts and company estimates."
Exxon,2017-2,"Shale companies deployed more rigs than they have done in sixteen months last week [nL1N1FT11T], and have steadily increased the number in the field to take advantage of crude prices that have mostly held at more than $50 per barrel since the world's top oil exporters, both OPEC and non-OPEC, agreed to cut supplies in late November."
Exxon,2017-2,"A further rise in the oil price could quickly stir drilling activity across the United States, which would in turn accelerate service fee and labor cost inflation. That is a worrying development for an industry that has lately gotten used to costs heading only down."
Exxon,2017-2,"There were 207 hydraulic fracturing fleets at work in January across the U.S., up 20 percent from last June, according to data from Houston-based Primary Vision, which tracks oilfield service equipment usage."
Exxon,2017-2,"Pioneer Natural Resources Co has its own fracturing crews, which it hopes will help offset rising service costs elsewhere."
Exxon,2017-2,"""I believe we will be able to keep our inflation numbers down to more like approximately 5 percent, but the internal plan is to make sure that cost inflation is offset by our efficiency gains,"" Pioneer Natural Chief Executive Tim Dove said on a post-earnings call earlier this month."
Exxon,2017-2,"Other companies have locked in contracts to insulate themselves from the rise in service and labor costs. WPX Energy, a leading shale oil producer in North Dakota and Texas, has sought to protect against price inflation through contracts for sand, stimulant, equipment and services, said CEO Rick Muncrief in an interview."
Exxon,2017-2,Other companies including Hess Corp hope to beat the inflation forecasts with yet more efficiency gains.
Exxon,2017-2,"Hess hopes to wring more barrels out of each well with new techniques that allow it to conduct hydraulic fracturing at 60 spots along a well, up from the usual 50, president Greg Hill said on a conference call last month."
Exxon,2017-2,"In addition, using more sand and other proppants - used to keep fissures in shale rock open - in the wells should help boost production, Hill said."
Exxon,2017-2,"But the possibility of more deep cost reductions are, for the most part, gone."
Exxon,2017-2,"A number of companies saw break-even costs at the wellhead - the price required to profit from oil at a new well - stagnate between the third and fourth quarters, data from Rystad Energy showed."
Exxon,2017-2,"""To certain producers, there's a little bit of opportunity to lower costs more,"" said Bill Costello, a portfolio manager at Westwood Holdings Group. ""But those are few and far between."""

Exxon,2017-2,"But for the first time since 2012, shale producers will see a rise in break-even production costs this year, according to data from Rystad Energy, which surveys producers. The per-barrel costs will rise an average of $1.60 across the shale patch to $36.50."
Exxon,2017-2,"The drive to lower costs has run its course for now, and service firms are leveraging power in the more crowded oilfields, such as the Permian basin in West Texas, to eke out higher payments from producers."
Exxon,2017-2,"Firms that supply rigs, crews, technological expertise are clamoring to take back discounts they extended during the slump, in some cases asking for between 10 percent and 15 percent more as the number of rigs and crews deployed in the fields rises."
Exxon,2017-2,"""In the Permian, activity has picked up, and going forward we would expect to see some pressure,"" Chevron Corp's Chief Executive John Watson said on an earnings call last month."
Exxon,2017-2,"Oil service providers acknowledge, however, that their price hikes may not stick until drillers generate enough demand to burn through the remaining spare capacity in the oil service sector."
Exxon,2017-2,"In a securities filing on Feb. 8, service provider Baker Hughes Inc cautioned that drilling ""activity needs to increase meaningfully before excess service capacity can be substantially absorbed and meaningful pricing recovery takes place."""
Exxon,2017-2,"Service inflation represents only a fraction of the expected rise in international crude prices this year. A Reuters poll of 31 analysts and economists forecast benchmark U.S. oil prices will average $56.08 per barrel in 2017, up from $43.47 last year."
Exxon,2017-2,"Between half and two-thirds of the cost savings achieved during the oil price slump are likely to become permanent even if oil prices tick higher, according to industry experts and company estimates."
Exxon,2017-2,"Shale companies deployed more rigs than they have done in sixteen months last week [nL1N1FT11T], and have steadily increased the number in the field to take advantage of crude prices that have mostly held at more than $50 per barrel since the world's top oil exporters, both OPEC and non-OPEC, agreed to cut supplies in late November."
Exxon,2017-2,"A further rise in the oil price could quickly stir drilling activity across the United States, which would in turn accelerate service fee and labor cost inflation. That is a worrying development for an industry that has lately gotten used to costs heading only down."
Exxon,2017-2,"There were 207 hydraulic fracturing fleets at work in January across the U.S., up 20 percent from last June, according to data from Houston-based Primary Vision, which tracks oilfield service equipment usage."
Exxon,2017-2,"Pioneer Natural Resources Co has its own fracturing crews, which it hopes will help offset rising service costs elsewhere."
Exxon,2017-2,"""I believe we will be able to keep our inflation numbers down to more like approximately 5 percent, but the internal plan is to make sure that cost inflation is offset by our efficiency gains,"" Pioneer Natural Chief Executive Tim Dove said on a post-earnings call earlier this month."
Exxon,2017-2,"Other companies have locked in contracts to insulate themselves from the rise in service and labor costs. WPX Energy, a leading shale oil producer in North Dakota and Texas, has sought to protect against price inflation through contracts for sand, stimulant, equipment and services, said CEO Rick Muncrief in an interview."
Exxon,2017-2,Other companies including Hess Corp hope to beat the inflation forecasts with yet more efficiency gains.
Exxon,2017-2,"Hess hopes to wring more barrels out of each well with new techniques that allow it to conduct hydraulic fracturing at 60 spots along a well, up from the usual 50, president Greg Hill said on a conference call last month."
Exxon,2017-2,"In addition, using more sand and other proppants - used to keep fissures in shale rock open - in the wells should help boost production, Hill said."
Exxon,2017-2,"But the possibility of more deep cost reductions are, for the most part, gone."
Exxon,2017-2,"A number of companies saw break-even costs at the wellhead - the price required to profit from oil at a new well - stagnate between the third and fourth quarters, data from Rystad Energy showed."
Exxon,2017-2,"""To certain producers, there's a little bit of opportunity to lower costs more,"" said Bill Costello, a portfolio manager at Westwood Holdings Group. ""But those are few and far between."""

Exxon,2017-2,"PORT HARCOURT, Nigeria, Feb 14 (Reuters) - Nigeria needs to offer work to people who make a living from illegally refining oil in the Niger Delta to achieve peace there, Vice President Yemi Osinbajo said on Tuesday."

Exxon,2017-2,"PARIS, Feb 9 (Reuters) - French oil company Total is on the hunt to buy assets from struggling rivals, it said on Thursday, as it reported some of the biggest profits in the industry for last year and raised its dividend."
Exxon,2017-2,"Chief Executive Patrick Pouyanne said Total was reaping the benefit of cutting costs more quickly than competitors following the start of an oil price rout in 2014, and of focusing on projects with lower production costs."
Exxon,2017-2,"""We have the second-best net adjusted profit in the year among oil majors although we don't have the same size of production compared with some of them - we are fifth largest in terms of production,"" he told reporters."
Exxon,2017-2,"Total said it made an adjusted net profit of $8.2 billion in 2016 and that on a comparable basis Shell made $7.2 billion, BP $2.6 billion and Chevron $1.8 billion. Only Exxon Mobil made more, with $8.9 billion, Total said."
Exxon,2017-2,"In the fourth quarter, the French company's net profit rose 16 percent to $2.4 billion, beating analysts' average forecast of $2.3 billion, while the dividend was set at 0.62 euros per share, up from 0.61 euros in the previous three quarters."
Exxon,2017-2,"""Another resilient set of results from Total, with earnings robust across all segments,"" Jefferies analysts said in a note."
Exxon,2017-2,"They have a ""hold"" rating on the stock, which was up 1.2 percent to 47.4 euros at 1430 GMT."
Exxon,2017-2,"""We reacted faster than our peers on cutting our costs and we succeeded,"" Pouyanne said. ""We deliberately made the choice to go for projects with very low production costs."""
Exxon,2017-2,"""We did a lot of cost savings. The most spectacular was the average cost of production in exploration and production which was reduced to $5.9 per barrel of oil equivalent (boe), compared with $9.9/boe in 2014 and was the principal reason of our resilience,"" he said."
Exxon,2017-2,"Total said it made $2.8 billion of savings in 2016, beating its target of $2.4 billion. It aims to make a further $3.5 billion of savings in 2017 and cut production costs to $5.5/boe."
Exxon,2017-2,"Pouyanne said the company's downstream business also contributed to the strong performance, with a return on capital employed of over 30 percent, which he said was ahead of the 16-17 percent at peers."
Exxon,2017-2,"Total's solid balance sheet meant it could look for opportunities to pick up assets, the CEO said, adding the company planned to make final investment decisions on about 10 projects within the next 18 months."
Exxon,2017-2,"""We are in a field of opportunities,"" Pouyanne said. ""After two years of very low prices, there are companies around the world that have good assets but are struggling."""
Exxon,2017-2,"Total expects to invest $16-$17 billion in 2017, including resource acquisitions, compared with $18.3 billion in 2016."
Exxon,2017-2,"Production is forecast to grow by more than 4 percent, supporting the company's goal to increase output on average by 5 percent per year from 2014 to 2020."
Exxon,2017-2,Pouyanne said the global oil market had not yet rebalanced and inventories were about 10 percent above normal. He added oil prices were likely to remain volatile.

Exxon,2017-2,"WASHINGTON, Feb 3 (Reuters) - U.S. Republicans on Friday repealed a securities disclosure rule aimed at curbing corruption at energy and mining companies and voted to ax emissions limits on drilling operations, part of a push to remove Obama-era regulations on extractive industries."
Exxon,2017-2,"In a 52-47 vote, the Republican-controlled Senate approved a resolution to eradicate a rule requiring companies such as Exxon Mobil and Chevron Corp to publicly state taxes and other fees paid to foreign governments like Russia."
Exxon,2017-2,"The House of Representatives already passed the measure. President Donald Trump is expected to sign it within days. On Thursday, the Senate repealed a rule that would have limited coal companies from dumping waste into streams. [nL1N1FN1RD]"
Exxon,2017-2,"After a number of legal battles, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in June 2016 completed the regulation, which supporters said could help expose questionable financial ties U.S. companies may have with foreign governments."
Exxon,2017-2,"Senate Democrats raised concerns that Exxon's chief executive during those legal fights was Rex Tillerson, who was recently confirmed as U.S. secretary of state and has worked extensively in Russia."
Exxon,2017-2,"""It should be lost on no one that in less than 48 hours, the Republican-controlled Senate has confirmed the former head of ExxonMobil to serve as our secretary of state, and repealed a key anti-corruption rule that Exxon Mobil and the American Petroleum Institute have erroneously fought for years,"" Senator Ben Cardin of Maryland said, referring to the oil industry's trade group."
Exxon,2017-2,"Exxon and other major energy corporations fought for years to block the rule, required by the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law."
Exxon,2017-2,"Cardin, the senior Democrat on the foreign relations committee, wrote the Dodd-Frank section on the payments to foreign governments with Richard Lugar, a former Republican senator."
Exxon,2017-2,"Critics of the rule said it duplicated existing regulations, was too costly and burdensome for companies to implement and that it put U.S. companies at a competitive disadvantage with state-owned companies in other countries that do not have to divulge such information."
Exxon,2017-2,The change could give American companies an edge over Canadian and European companies that face some of the toughest transparency rules in the world. [nL1N1FO0K6]
Exxon,2017-2,"Republicans have taken advantage of a seldom-used law known as the Congressional Review Act to overturn recently enacted rules with simple majorities in both chambers, denying senators the opportunity to filibuster and stall a vote. [nL1N1FN1RD]"
Exxon,2017-2,Democrats said Republicans were using the review act to help companies not the public.
Exxon,2017-2,"""When it comes to giving public resources to private interests and gutting our nation's health, environmental and financial standards, the Republicans can't seem to act fast enough,"" said Representative Raul Grijalva. ""Whoever they're doing this for, it isn't the American public."""
Exxon,2017-2,"The Congressional Review Act also bars agencies from revisiting overturned rules, which could pose a legal conundrum for the SEC, which is required by law to enact a payments regulation."
Exxon,2017-2,"The Senate will next consider repealing a rule limiting venting and leaking of the powerful greenhouse gas methane by oil and gas drillers on federal and tribal lands, mostly in the U.S. West. The repeal was passed by the Republican-controlled House on Friday."
Exxon,2017-2,The Interior Department finalized the methane rule in November. The oil industry has argued that it would add to costs for new and existing wells. Environmentalists have said the rule would protect human health and return more than $800 million in royalties to taxpayers over 10 years.

Exxon,2017-2,"HOUSTON/CALGARY, Feb 3 (Reuters) - A reversal of U.S. transparency requirements for the natural resources industry could give American oil companies an edge over Canadian and European rivals who face some of the toughest rules in the world, according to company executives, legal experts and trade groups."
Exxon,2017-2,"The U.S. Senate passed a resolution early on Friday to overturn the ""resource extraction rule,"" an Obama administration regulation that required companies to disclose taxes and other payments to foreign governments."
Exxon,2017-2,"President Donald Trump is expected to soon sign the resolution killing the rule, which had been aimed at discouraging shady dealing in far-flung nations. [nL1N1FO0JM]"
Exxon,2017-2,The rule was among a handful of regulations ushered in during the final months of Barack Obama's presidency that the Republican-controlled Congress has targeted as overly burdensome for the U.S. economy.
Exxon,2017-2,Overturning the regulation leaves Canadian and European natural resource companies with far more stringent reporting standards for payments to foreign governments than U.S. behemoths like Exxon Mobil Corp and Chevron Corp .
Exxon,2017-2,"Certain details of contract negotiations and terms of bids to access reserves must be divulged under the Canadian and European rules. That could provide American companies a glimpse of their rivals' negotiating tactics around the globe, without having to tip their hands in return."
Exxon,2017-2,"""It definitely could put Canada at a disadvantage because we are fairly stringent on our rules, both domestically and internationally, on how our companies operate,"" said Mark Salkeld, chief executive officer of the Petroleum Services Association of Canada, an industry trade group."
Exxon,2017-2,"European oil company Royal Dutch Shell Plc , meanwhile, pointed out that a U.S. reversal of the transparency requirements would go against the broader global trend in the notoriously murky industry."
Exxon,2017-2,"""The trend that we have, with access to information, with bringing distant countries into our space all the time, we will have to live with that.

Exxon,2017-2,"Exxon and other major energy corporations fought for years to block the rule, required by the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law."

Exxon,2017-2,The rule was among a handful of regulations ushered in during the final months of Barack Obama's presidency that the Republican-controlled Congress has targeted as overly burdensome for the U.S. economy.

Exxon,2017-2,"SINGAPORE, Feb 2 (Reuters) - OPEC and non-OPEC producer Russia are shielding Asia from supply cuts agreed in a landmark deal last year as they fight to protect their share of the world's biggest and fastest growing oil market."
Exxon,2017-2,"Instead, they have reduced deliveries to Europe and the Americas as they implement a coordinated agreement to cut supply by about 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd), seeking to reduce a global supply glut and lift oil prices."
Exxon,2017-2,"The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries' (OPEC) oil supplies to Asia rose by 7 percent between November and January, to 17 million bpd, meeting two-thirds of the region's oil consumption, data from Thomson Reuters Eikon showed."
Exxon,2017-2,"Under a deal agreed last November, OPEC pledged to cut production by around 1.2 million bpd in the first half of 2017. Other producers, including Russia, pledged to cut another 600,000 bpd."

Exxon,2017-2,"While the OPEC and Russian cuts should eventually rebalance the market after a three-year glut, it will be slower in Asia unless regional demand picks up."
Exxon,2017-2,"In a sign of ongoing Asian oversupply, Eikon data shows that around 30 chartered supertankers, known as Very Large Crude Carriers (VLCC), are sitting in the waters outside Asia's oil trading hub of Singapore and southern Malaysia, carrying about 55 million barrels of oil, enough to meet almost five days of Chinese demand."
Exxon,2017-2,Asia has been the main source of global oil demand growth for the past two decades as consumption in economically developed nations has stagnated.
Exxon,2017-2,"Therefore, OPEC has raised its supply to Asia, and Russia has also re-routed a great chunk of its rising production towards China and the Asia-Pacific over the past decade. Russia surpassed Saudi Arabia as China's biggest supplier last year, exporting 1.05 million bpd of crude versus Saudi Arabia's 1.02 million. [nB9N1FA005]"

Exxon,2017-2,"LONDON, Feb 2 (Reuters) - The falling cost of electric vehicle and solar technology will halt demand growth for oil and coal from 2020, according to research published on Thursday, posing a threat to fossil fuel companies unprepared for the transition."
Exxon,2017-2,"The Grantham Institute at Imperial College London and independent think tank Carbon Tracker Initiative analysed cost forecasts for electric vehicle (EV) and solar photovoltaic (PV) technology, government policies and the impact on road transport and power markets, which account for half of global fossil fuel consumption."
Exxon,2017-2,"""Fossil fuels may lose 10 percent of market share to PV and EVs within a single decade. This may not sound much but it can be the beginning of the end once demand starts to decline,"" Carbon Tracker said in a statement."
Exxon,2017-2,"A 10 percent loss of market share caused the collapse of the U.S. coal mining industry and Europe's five biggest utilities lost more than 100 billion euros ($108 billion) in value from 2008-2013 because they were unprepared for renewable energy growth, it added."
Exxon,2017-2,"The report said that electric vehicles could make up a third of the world's road transport market by 2035 and that solar PV could supply 23 percent of global power generation by 2040, entirely phasing out coal and leaving natural gas with only a 1 percent market share."
Exxon,2017-2,"Growth in the number of electric vehicles could lead to 2 million barrels per day (bpd) of oil demand being displaced by 2025, the report estimates."
Exxon,2017-2,"That would be similar to the volume of oversupply that led to the 2014/15 collapse in oil prices. By 2040, 16 million bpd could be displaced, rising to 25 million bpd by 2050, it said."
Exxon,2017-2,The International Energy Agency has said that 2 million bpd of oil could be displaced by electric vehicles by 2040. Bloomberg New Energy Finance has forecast that such displacement could occur as early as 2028.
Exxon,2017-2,"""Coal demand could peak in 2020 and fall to half of 2012 levels by 2050. Oil demand could be flat from 2020 to 2030 then fall steadily to 2050,"" Thursday's report said."
Exxon,2017-2,"By contrast, the International Energy Agency said this week it does not expect oil demand to peak any time soon. [nL5N1FK1B0]"
Exxon,2017-2,"Last week BP said that it expects global oil demand to continue growing into the 2040s, citing increased plastics consumption, while U.S. peer ExxonMobil has said that it sees fossil fuels meeting almost 80 percent of global energy needs by 2040.[nL5N1FF4HH]"
Exxon,2017-2,"""Oil majors already do scenario analysis but, as Exxon previously indicated, they do not assign sufficient probability to a rapid (low-carbon) transition,"" said James Leaton, head of research at Carbon Tracker Initiative."
Exxon,2017-2,"""There appears to be a desire to justify business-as-usual at some companies, which does not constitute sound risk management."""

Exxon,2017-2,"The vote, mostly along party lines, was by far the closest in at least half a century."

Exxon,2017-2,"ODESSA, Texas, Feb 1 (Reuters) - In most U.S. shale oil regions, energy firms are making strategic but cautious bets as the price of oil holds above $50 a barrel."
Exxon,2017-2,"Here in the Permian Basin of West Texas, the largest U.S. oil patch, the industry poured more than $28 billion into land acquisitions last year - more than triple what they spent in 2015."
Exxon,2017-2,Those deals set the stage for much larger investments needed to extract the oil from the ground - and they illustrate how the Permian Basin has become the epicenter for the U.S. shale resurgence after a historic oil price crash.
Exxon,2017-2,"""We could easily see an extra 100 rigs out here in the Permian by June,"" said Josh Clawson of Gesco, a Midland, Texas, electrical contractor for oil drilling rigs."
Exxon,2017-2,That doesn't necessarily mean the investment blitz will extend to other U.S. oil regions. The industry's focus on the Permian reflects the simple math of profitability and a complex set of geographic advantages and technological advances that make it cheaper to drill here than in other major U.S. oil regions.
Exxon,2017-2,"Permian Basin producers make money at the current crude price of about $53 per barrel because of the region's sprawling pipeline network, abundant labor and supplies, and warm winters that allow year-round work."
Exxon,2017-2,Most of America's shale industry needs prices above $60 a barrel to justify new projects and expansion. Oil has not hit that price since June 2015.
Exxon,2017-2,"So at least for now, the Permian accounts for a disproportionate share of the industry's recovery. The amount spent on Permian land purchases and leases last year represented 39 percent of all deals nationally and tripled the activity seen in any other major U.S. oil region."
Exxon,2017-2,"Acquisitions in North Dakota's Bakken shale fields, by comparison, accounted for 3 percent of all deals."
Exxon,2017-2,Judging by the confident flow of capital into West Texas - a swagger bred in part by aggressive cost-cutting and innovation through the downturn - U.S. oil companies have retained their appetite for risk.
Exxon,2017-2,"What remains to be seen, should per-barrel prices rise further, is whether companies continue to expand operations in the Permian as projects start to make more economic sense in other oil states including North Dakota, Colorado and Wyoming."
Exxon,2017-2,"Oil companies started the new year with announcements of about $9 billion more in Permian land deals, including a $6.6 billion Exxon Mobil Corp buy that doubled its acreage in the basin.[nL4N1F74E1]"
Exxon,2017-2,"Occidental Petroleum Corp , WPX Energy , Noble Energy Inc and RSP Permian Inc have also made major commitments to the region."
Exxon,2017-2,"The companies that have sold or leased their holdings have typically been smaller, privately-held firms aiming to take advantage of the high land prices rather than invest the millions of dollars needed to pump the oil."
Exxon,2017-2,"The demand for West Texas acreage has sent land prices soaring in the last two years. One deal in December 2016 priced out at more than $63,000 an acre, double the price paid in similar deal earlier that year."
Exxon,2017-2,Double Eagle Energy Permian LLC and its predecessor companies have made a fortune buying and selling Permian acreage starting in 2009.
Exxon,2017-2,"But Double Eagle's founders, who have snapped up 65,000 acres in the past two years, now plan to start drilling their holdings in addition to speculating on land values. The firm is preparing for an initial public offering with an expected valuation of $3 billion, according to a half dozen bankers who have examined its value.[nL1N1CI1LI]"
Exxon,2017-2,"""Activity breeds activity,"" said John Sellers, co-founder of Double Eagle, of the surge here. ""The Permian is a really great basin to be in."""
Exxon,2017-2,"While land prices have risen fast, the cost of acreage still represents a small part of the profit equation. Most of the expense is tied to drilling and getting the oil to market."
Exxon,2017-2,Buyers of Permian acreage are moving quickly to tap their holdings. The number of rigs across the basin is up more than 28 percent in the past year; oil job postings here have more than doubled from lows of last March; and sales tax receipts for the region starting rising in November after falling for two years.
Exxon,2017-2,"Oil firms are pumping 2.2 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude from the Permian, about a quarter of U.S. output of 8.9 million bpd."
Exxon,2017-2,"In Midland and nearby Odessa, centers for the West Texas industry, the buzz of economic growth has replaced the desolation of 2015 and early 2016."
Exxon,2017-2,Many storage yards are only half full - meaning more equipment is in the field.
Exxon,2017-2,"Chevron Corp , which controls more than 1 million acres of Permian land, last year opened a new regional office in Midland. EOG Resources Inc and Occidental Petroleum Corp have office expansion plans of their own."
Exxon,2017-2,"Concho Resources Inc , which is headquartered in Midland, has been renovating and expanding its downtown Midland offices and funding community projects, including a $400,000 makeover of a downtown park."
Exxon,2017-2,"Permits for new home construction jumped 50 percent in November, the latest period for which data are available. And dinner at Midland's Texas Roadhouse Inc now requires a half-hour wait."
Exxon,2017-2,"""Everyone I know here is hiring,"" said J. Ross Lacy, a Midland councilman."
Exxon,2017-2,"The resurgence gained momentum last summer when industry veteran Mark Papa's Silver Run Acquisition Corp bought Centennial Resource Development Inc , which controls premium acreage across the Permian.[nL1N1A51D0]"
Exxon,2017-2,"Papa is considered one of the preeminent oil executives of his generation, and his move from retirement back into the oil patch was seen as a sign by many that the Permian was heating up again.[nL1N1A51D0]"
Exxon,2017-2,"Two months later, Apache Corp said it had accumulated over 300,000 acres of Permian land over two years for less than $1,300 an acre."
Exxon,2017-2,"""The Permian Basin represents the foundation of Apache's North American growth strategy,"" said Gary Clark, vice president of investor relations at Houston-based Apache."
Exxon,2017-2,"Apache estimated the land had more than 3 billion barrels of oil, sparking speculation that the Permian holds far more oil than anyone had expected in a previously overlooked part of the basin.[nL3N1BJ3XA]"
Exxon,2017-2,"Anadarko Petroleum Corp sold acreage in east Texas earlier this month for $2.3 billion as it looked to raise cash to develop the 600,000 acres of Permian land it controls.[nL1N1F22LS]"
Exxon,2017-2,"The firm is relocating 200 employees and their families to Midland, a sign of faith in the region's long-term prospects."
Exxon,2017-2,"Many of recent Permian deals were paid for with cash from secondary stock offerings, an unusual step that investors typically dislike because it dilutes their stakes in companies. But in the Permian, it seems, investors see the payoff."
Exxon,2017-2,Companies turned to stock offerings for cash because debt markets were largely closed to oil producers during the two-year price downturn.[nL2N1800XD]
Exxon,2017-2,Diamondback Energy Inc paid more than $3 billion last year for Permian land in two separate transactions - deals financed through stock offerings. Diamondback executives said the deals were immediately profitable and should provide years of growth.
Exxon,2017-2,"Executives at SM Energy Co and RSP Permian made similar comments in announcing their own deals late last year for $1.6 billion and $2.4 billion, respectively.[nL4N1CO3MW][nL4N1CJ552]"
Exxon,2017-2,"While shares of top Permian producers have risen in recent weeks, Wall Street's appetite for stock is unsated."
Exxon,2017-2,"West Texas oil giant Endeavor Energy Resources LP[EERL.UL], one of the biggest private oil producers in the Permian, is considering taking advantage of that with an initial public offering to expand and pump more from the field, Chief Executive Chuck Moloy told Reuters. [L1N1FM1FJ]"
Exxon,2017-2,"Of the 44 analysts covering Pioneer Natural Resources Co - considered by many investors to be the top Permian producer - forty recommend buying it, according to Thomson Reuters data."
Exxon,2017-2,Investors are seeing the same unique advantages that drew oil companies to wide-open spaces of West Texas.
Exxon,2017-2,"""The industry is learning where the value really is,"" said Chuck Meloy, chief executive of Endeavor."

Exxon,2017-2,"ODESSA, Texas, Feb 1 (Reuters) - In most U.S. shale oil regions, energy firms are making strategic but cautious bets as the price of oil holds above $50 a barrel."
Exxon,2017-2,"Here in the Permian Basin of West Texas, the largest U.S. oil patch, the industry poured more than $28 billion into land acquisitions last year - more than triple what they spent in 2015."
Exxon,2017-2,Those deals set the stage for much larger investments needed to extract the oil from the ground - and they illustrate how the Permian Basin has become the epicenter for the U.S. shale resurgence after a historic oil price crash.
Exxon,2017-2,"""We could easily see an extra 100 rigs out here in the Permian by June,"" said Josh Clawson of Gesco, a Midland, Texas, electrical contractor for oil drilling rigs."
Exxon,2017-2,That doesn't necessarily mean the investment blitz will extend to other U.S. oil regions. The industry's focus on the Permian reflects the simple math of profitability and a complex set of geographic advantages and technological advances that make it cheaper to drill here than in other major U.S. oil regions.
Exxon,2017-2,"Permian Basin producers make money at the current crude price of about $53 per barrel because of the region's sprawling pipeline network, abundant labor and supplies, and warm winters that allow year-round work."
Exxon,2017-2,Most of America's shale industry needs prices above $60 a barrel to justify new projects and expansion. Oil has not hit that price since June 2015.
Exxon,2017-2,"So at least for now, the Permian accounts for a disproportionate share of the industry's recovery. The amount spent on Permian land purchases and leases last year represented 39 percent of all deals nationally and tripled the activity seen in any other major U.S. oil region."
Exxon,2017-2,"Acquisitions in North Dakota's Bakken shale fields, by comparison, accounted for 3 percent of all deals."
Exxon,2017-2,Judging by the confident flow of capital into West Texas - a swagger bred in part by aggressive cost-cutting and innovation through the downturn - U.S. oil companies have retained their appetite for risk.
Exxon,2017-2,"What remains to be seen, should per-barrel prices rise further, is whether companies continue to expand operations in the Permian as projects start to make more economic sense in other oil states including North Dakota, Colorado and Wyoming."
Exxon,2017-2,"Oil companies started the new year with announcements of about $9 billion more in Permian land deals, including a $6.6 billion Exxon Mobil Corp buy that doubled its acreage in the basin.[nL4N1F74E1]"
Exxon,2017-2,"Occidental Petroleum Corp , WPX Energy , Noble Energy Inc and RSP Permian Inc have also made major commitments to the region."
Exxon,2017-2,"The companies that have sold or leased their holdings have typically been smaller, privately-held firms aiming to take advantage of the high land prices rather than invest the millions of dollars needed to pump the oil."

Exxon,2017-2,"{{20170201T060003.066+0000}}INSIGHT-As oil recovers, U.S. firms descend on the Permian Basin in West TexasBy Ernest Scheyder"
Exxon,2017-2,"ODESSA, Texas, Feb 1 (Reuters) - In most U.S. shale oil regions, energy firms are making strategic but cautious bets as the price of oil holds above $50 a barrel."
Exxon,2017-2,"Here in the Permian Basin of West Texas, the largest U.S. oil patch, the industry poured more than $28 billion into land acquisitions last year - more than triple what they spent in 2015."
Exxon,2017-2,Those deals set the stage for much larger investments needed to extract the oil from the ground - and they illustrate how the Permian Basin has become the epicenter for the U.S. shale resurgence after a historic oil price crash.
Exxon,2017-2,"""We could easily see an extra 100 rigs out here in the Permian by June,"" said Josh Clawson of Gesco, a Midland, Texas, electrical contractor for oil drilling rigs."
Exxon,2017-2,That doesn't necessarily mean the investment blitz will extend to other U.S. oil regions. The industry's focus on the Permian reflects the simple math of profitability and a complex set of geographic advantages and technological advances that make it cheaper to drill here than in other major U.S. oil regions.
Exxon,2017-2,"Permian Basin producers make money at the current crude price of about $53 per barrel because of the region's sprawling pipeline network, abundant labor and supplies, and warm winters that allow year-round work."
Exxon,2017-2,Most of America's shale industry needs prices above $60 a barrel to justify new projects and expansion. Oil has not hit that price since June 2015.
Exxon,2017-2,"So at least for now, the Permian accounts for a disproportionate share of the industry's recovery. The amount spent on Permian land purchases and leases last year represented 39 percent of all deals nationally and tripled the activity seen in any other major U.S. oil region."
Exxon,2017-2,"Acquisitions in North Dakota's Bakken shale fields, by comparison, accounted for 3 percent of all deals."
Exxon,2017-2,Judging by the confident flow of capital into West Texas - a swagger bred in part by aggressive cost-cutting and innovation through the downturn - U.S. oil companies have retained their appetite for risk.
Exxon,2017-2,"What remains to be seen, should per-barrel prices rise further, is whether companies continue to expand operations in the Permian as projects start to make more economic sense in other oil states including North Dakota, Colorado and Wyoming."
Exxon,2017-2,"Oil companies started the new year with announcements of about $9 billion more in Permian land deals, including a $6.6 billion Exxon Mobil Corp buy that doubled its acreage in the basin.[nL4N1F74E1]"
Exxon,2017-2,"Occidental Petroleum Corp , WPX Energy , Noble Energy Inc and RSP Permian Inc have also made major commitments to the region."
Exxon,2017-2,"The companies that have sold or leased their holdings have typically been smaller, privately-held firms aiming to take advantage of the high land prices rather than invest the millions of dollars needed to pump the oil."

Exxon,2017-2,"Oil prices have gradually recovered since January 2016, when they sank to a 13-year low of $27 a barrel, forcing companies to slash spending and shelve deals on oil and gas fields."
Exxon,2017-2,"Deal activity in North America rose to $76 billion in 2016 from $43 billion in 2015, driven primarily by the shale oil Permian basin, with its low operating costs and high reservoirs, which spurred a record number of transactions, according to the EY report."

Exxon,2017-2,"HOUSTON, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp boosted its 2017 capital budget on Tuesday on a bet that oil prices have stabilized, but posted its lowest quarterly profit since 1999 as it took a $2 billion charge against the value of natural gas reserves from its buyout of XTO Energy."
Exxon,2017-2,"The world's largest publicly traded oil producer wrote down the book value of part of its North American natural gas and crude reserves, some of which were acquired in 2009's all-stock buyout of XTO Energy, a deal worth roughly $30 billion at the time."

Exxon,2017-2,"NEW YORK, Jan 31 (Reuters Breakingviews) - It's not that running Exxon Mobil is easy, but the energy titan is a well-oiled machine compared to the new U.S. administration. New Chief Executive Darren Woods delivered a solid first set of quarterly earnings. Ex-boss Rex Tillerson, meanwhile, awaits a Senate nod to lead President Donald Trump's State Department."
Exxon,2017-2,"Exxon generated profit of $1.7 billion in the fourth quarter of 2016, down 40 percent from a year earlier, after a $2 billion writedown on a gas field. Unlike most of the industry, the $350 billion company traditionally has avoided such impairments. Though a prolonged commodity slump has taken its toll, Exxon also managed not to take a hit on oil sands that it had earlier warned was a possibility."
Exxon,2017-2,"The one blemish aside, earnings handily exceeded what analysts were expecting. It helped that crude prices ratcheted up last year, with the Brent benchmark averaging $49.46 a barrel in the fourth quarter by Exxon's figures, up from $33.89 in the first quarter. The company also kept a lid on costs, even as total production declined slightly."
Exxon,2017-2,"Exxon wouldn't be drawn meaningfully during Tuesday's call on such matters or on Trump's chaotic temporary ban on entry into the United States for citizens of seven mainly Muslim countries including Iran and Iraq. That particular edict is surely more alarming for Tillerson than Woods. After all, it has made much harder his job of maintaining America's diplomatic relationships before he has even started."
Exxon,2017-2,"Woods benefited from a far smoother transition. A post-election lift in Exxon's share price has since faded, but at least the new CEO can rely on a focused organization to help him do his job. Given what's in store, Tillerson could be forgiven nostalgia for his old corner office."
Exxon,2017-2,"- Exxon Mobil on Jan. 31 posted a better-than-expected fourth-quarter profit, helped by rising crude-oil prices and lower costs."
Exxon,2017-2,"- The world's largest publicly traded energy group took a $2 billion writedown on Rocky Mountain natural gas assets, a rare move for the company."
