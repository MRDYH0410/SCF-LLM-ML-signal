Exxon,2017-6,"TORONTO, June 30 (Reuters) - The U.S government warned industrial firms this week about a hacking campaign targeting the nuclear and energy sectors, the latest event to highlight the power industry's vulnerability to cyber attacks."
Exxon,2017-6,"Since at least May, hackers used tainted ""phishing"" emails to ""harvest credentials"" so they could gain access to networks of their targets, according to a joint report from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and Federal Bureau of Investigation."
Exxon,2017-6,"The report provided to the industrial firms was reviewed by Reuters on Friday. While disclosing attacks, and warning that in some cases hackers succeeded in compromising the networks of their targets, it did not identify any specific victims."
Exxon,2017-6,"""Historically, cyber actors have strategically targeted the energy sector with various goals ranging from cyber espionage to the ability to disrupt energy systems in the event of a hostile conflict,"" the report said."
Exxon,2017-6,"Homeland Security and FBI officials could not be reached for comment on the report, which was dated June 28."
Exxon,2017-6,The report was released during a week of heavy hacking activity.
Exxon,2017-6,"A virus dubbed ""NotPetya"" attacked on Tuesday, spreading from initial infections in Ukraine to businesses around the globe. It encrypted data on infected machines, rendering them inoperable and disrupting activity at ports, law firms and factories. [L8N1JP55N]"
Exxon,2017-6,On Tuesday the energy-industry news site E&E News reported that U.S. investigators were looking into cyber intrusions this year at multiple nuclear power generators.
Exxon,2017-6,"Reuters has not confirmed details of the E&E News report, which said there was no evidence safety systems had been compromised at affected plants."
Exxon,2017-6,The activity described in the U.S. government report comes at a time when industrial firms are particularly anxious about threat that hackers pose to their operations.
Exxon,2017-6,"Industrial firms, including power providers and other utilities, have been particularly worried about the potential for destructive cyber attacks since December 2016, when hackers cut electricity in Ukraine."
Exxon,2017-6,"U.S. nuclear power generators PSEG , SCANA Corp and Entergy Corp said they were not impacted by the recent cyber attacks. SCANA's V.C. Summer nuclear plant in South Carolina shut down on Thursday due to a problem with a valve in the non-nuclear portion of the plant, a spokesman said."
Exxon,2017-6,"Another nuclear power generator, Dominion Energy , said it does not comment on cyber security."
Exxon,2017-6,"Two cyber security firms said on June 12 that they had identified the malicious software used in the Ukraine attack, which they dubbed Industroyer, warning that it could be easily modified to attack utilities in the United States and Europe. [L1N1J90J8]"
Exxon,2017-6,Industroyer is only the second piece of malware uncovered to date that is capable of disrupting industrial processes without the need for hackers to manually intervene.
Exxon,2017-6,"The first, Stuxnet, was discovered in 2010 and is widely believed by security researchers to have been used by the United States and Israel to attack Iran's nuclear program."
Exxon,2017-6,"The U.S. government report said attackers conducted reconnaissance to gain information about the individuals whose computers they sought to infect so that they create ""decoy documents"" on topics of interest to their targets."
Exxon,2017-6,"In an analysis, it described 11 files used in the attacks, including malware downloaders and tools that allow the hackers to take remote control of victim's computers and travel across their networks."
Exxon,2017-6,"Chevron Corp , Exxon Mobil Corp and ConocoPhillips , the three largest U.S. oil producers, declined to comment on their network security."

Exxon,2017-6,* Draft report says no case for EU-wide rules on smoke
Exxon,2017-6,"LONDON/BRUSSELS, June 29 (Reuters) - EU policymakers are unlikely to agree to Europe-wide rules on toxic smoke from burning building materials despite years of lobbying from fire fighters and safety experts, according to a draft report ordered by the region's executive seen by Reuters."
Exxon,2017-6,"The debate has been going on in Brussels for at least four years, but this month's deadly fire at the Grenfell Tower apartment block in London has highlighted a lack of fire safety regulations across the 28-member bloc."
Exxon,2017-6,"Officials at the European Commission, the European Union's executive, were already studying the draft version of a report on whether new smoke regulations for construction materials are needed before the June 14 blaze that killed at least 80 people."
Exxon,2017-6,"The draft, dated May, was based on around 50 interviews with regulators, industry groups and fire services, led by BRE, a British-based organisation that carries out research and testing in the building sector."
Exxon,2017-6,"It found that there ""would be limited benefits from regulating for the toxicity of smoke from construction products"" and that member states should continue to decide individually whether specific rules are necessary."
Exxon,2017-6,"It also concluded that ""regulation would increase barriers to trade, increase product costs and potentially remove some products from the market""."
Exxon,2017-6,"A final version should be ready by July 17, the draft said, although the Commission said it could not confirm that date."
Exxon,2017-6,The Commission had asked for the report to help resolve an argument between fire safety campaigners and the plastics industry.
Exxon,2017-6,"""Member States are free to set their own requirements for building design and safety,"" a Commission spokeswoman said, when asked about the report and the possibility of new regulation."
Exxon,2017-6,Trade body Plastics Europe says there is no evidence new rules on the toxicity of smoke from building materials would save lives. But firefighters and other safety campaigners say labelling products according to their toxicity when burned is one simple way to address a lack of clear fire safety regulations for builders in the EU.
Exxon,2017-6,"EU officials, fire safety and industry representatives debated the draft report in Brussels on May 16."
Exxon,2017-6,"Among those present was Richard Hull, a professor of fire science at the University of Central Lancashire in England."
Exxon,2017-6,"""If I go to my laboratory and I develop a new insulation material which is excellent in many respects but is lethally toxic when it burns, there's no restriction on me selling that as a building product,"" he said."
Exxon,2017-6,"Plastics Europe, which represents companies such as ExxonMobil , Total and BASF , said new regulations would not be useful because there are multiple factors to consider when assessing the safety of a building."
Exxon,2017-6,"""A smoke toxicity criterion for construction products will not per se guarantee more safety in the eventuality of a fire,"" Plastics Europe said."
Exxon,2017-6,"Presently, the EU only sets standards to ensure construction materials can be shipped across borders within the bloc, although EU sources said the Commission had decided long before the Grenfell fire to draw up new rules to harmonise fire-safety tests for building facades."
Exxon,2017-6,Police investigating the cause of London's most deadly fire since World War Two have said it started in a faulty fridge and spread rapidly because of external cladding on the 24-storey building. The cladding used has since failed safety checks and prompted a review of the materials used on British buildings ranging from hospitals to hotels to apartment blocks. [nL8N1JL04P][nL8N1JP35L]
Exxon,2017-6,"Hull said the use of more synthetic materials in construction has made smoke more toxic, with insulation products such as polyisocyanurate (PIR) producing high yields of hydrogen cyanide and carbon monoxide when burned."
Exxon,2017-6,"Pressure group Fire Safe Europe says around 40 percent of deaths in fires are caused directly by smoke, while a further 20 percent are caused by a combination of severe burns and smoke."
Exxon,2017-6,"The body brings together fire fighters, representatives of the concrete and cable industries, and equipment and insulation companies including Danish-listed Rockwool and Germany's Knauf Insulation."
Exxon,2017-6,"""Smoke is playing a crucial role in modern fire behaviour. said Brussels firefighter Pieter Maes, who attended the May meeting. ""We need to take it into account in our testing of materials, to understand how smoke production from a certain material can influence how fire spreads."""
Exxon,2017-6,Czech Member of the European Parliament Pavel Poc told Reuters his Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats group would push the Commission for specific rules on smoke.
Exxon,2017-6,"""Testing and labelling could give the consumers the chance to choose between more or less toxic materials,"" he said."

Exxon,2017-6,"AMSTERDAM, June 28 (Reuters) - A joint venture between Royal Dutch Shell and Exxon Mobil said on Wednesday it would appeal against a Dutch government plan to lower a production cap at the Groningen natural gas field by a further 10 percent."
Exxon,2017-6,The Dutch government has lowered production at Groningen several times over the past three years due to small earthquakes triggered by work there.
Exxon,2017-6,"The latest cap, announced in May, would lower production to 21.6 billion cubic metres (bcm) per year from October. It was 53.9 bcm in 2013."
Exxon,2017-6,"The 50-50 Exxon-Shell joint venture, known as NAM, said it had been left in an impossible position by being told it could continue production - vital to supply homes with gas - but without guarantees it is meeting safety standards."
Exxon,2017-6,"NAM cited one paragraph of the government's May production decision in particular as troubling: ""There is no model that can predict at which level of production the seismic risks align with the safety norms."""
Exxon,2017-6,"""We need to know the rules of the game,"" NAM director Gerald Schotman told reporters. ""Models based on independent research have been shoved aside."""
Exxon,2017-6,"Schotman said last year's production plan used estimates of scenarios put together by a panel of scientists and then subjected to independent review by peers - the way the Dutch government determines acceptable levels of risk in other areas, such as the safety of its dikes and flood defenses."
Exxon,2017-6,"NAM's appeal will be heard starting July 13 at the Council of State, along with appeals by environmentalists who think the latest cap did not go far enough."

Exxon,2017-6,"TCO previously only sent LPG in transit through Ukraine to the Black Sea port of Odessa and via land border crossings to Poland and other eastern European countries, the sources said. Talks on LPG supplies to Ukraine, which became a more high-reward market in 2016 compared to traditional routes, have been held for around a year."
Exxon,2017-6,"""(They) signed a spot contract, more likely, for a month. Talks are being held about a term (long-term) contract,"" a source familiar with the negotiations told Reuters."
Exxon,2017-6,"He also said that LPG will be delivered to SOCAR Ukraine, a Ukrainian subsidiary of Azerbaijan's state oil company SOCAR."
Exxon,2017-6,"An export-parity price for LPG supplies from Russia to Ukraine was on average $105-$115 per tonne higher than to Poland in 2016 and $70-80 per tonne higher than via Black Sea ports, Reuters calculations showed."
Exxon,2017-6,"TCO's test 300-400 tonne spot railway cargo for SOCAR Ukraine will be loaded in July via the Solovey-Topoli border crossing with a premium on technical propane butane mixture on DAP Ukraine basis (Russian-Ukrainian border), traders said."
Exxon,2017-6,"The size of the premium hasn't been disclosed, but Reuters monitoring showed that the difference between average spot prices of technical propane butane mixture at the Russia-Ukraine border and those on DAP Brest basis was $8 per tonne in favour of the Ukrainian market in the first half of the year."
Exxon,2017-6,"Another confirmation that TCO will start LPG supplies to Ukraine are shippers' monthly nominations, which Thomson Reuters Eikon publishes weekly. A total of 410 tonnes of liquefied gas, including 180 tonnes of butane and 230 tonnes of propane, will be shipped from the Kulsary station in Kazakhstan to the Ukrainian station of Spartak in the first ten days of July, according to the nominations."
Exxon,2017-6,"Market participants said SOCAR Ukraine has an agreement to store liquefied gas at the Makarovskaya LPG dispensing station (Spartak station), which is managed by UPK Group, a big player on the Ukrainian wholesale and retail LPG market."
Exxon,2017-6,"TCO's LPG production rose to 595,237 tonnes in January-May this year, up 6.7 percent from a year earlier."
Exxon,2017-6,"The company also ramped up LPG exports by nine percent to 549,177 tonnes in the first five months of the year compared to the same period last year."
Exxon,2017-6,"The main export routes for TCO's LPG in the western direction in January-May 2017 are to the port of Odessa (169,079 tonnes), Poland (128,410 tonnes), the Russian port of Taman (101,940 tonnes) and Hungary (59,986)."
Exxon,2017-6,"TCO also supplies liquefied gas to China with exports reaching 44,272 tonnes in the first five months of the year."
Exxon,2017-6,"Last October the world's largest independent oil trader Vitol started exports of TCO's LPG, which it received under an advance contract with one of the company's shareholders, Kazakhstan's state oil and gas company KazMunaiGas, which is looking for new profitable export routes because of the economic downturn."
Exxon,2017-6,"Shareholders in Tengizchevroil are U.S. Chevron (50 percent) and ExxonMobil (25 percent), KazMunaiGas (20 percent) and Lukarco, a subsidiary of Russia's Lukoil , (5 percent)."

Exxon,2017-6,"The 50-50 Exxon-Shell joint venture, known as NAM, said it has been left in an impossible position by being told it may continue production -- vital to supply homes with gas -- without guarantees it is meeting safety standards. It also opposes the latest, lowered production cap."
Exxon,2017-6,The Dutch government has capped production at Groningen due to small earthquakes triggered by work there.
Exxon,2017-6,"The latest cap announced in May would lower production to 21.6 billion cubic metres (bcm) per year from October, down from 53.9 bcm in 2013."
Exxon,2017-6,"NAM's appeal will be heard starting July 13 at the Council of State, along with appeals by environmentalists who think the latest cap did not go far enough."

Exxon,2017-6,Richard Sears - who served as chief scientist on the National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling - said such projects can be managed safely at low oil prices.
Exxon,2017-6,"The causes of the BP disaster had more to do with poor decision-making and slipshod safety systems than cost-cutting, said Sears, who previously managed production projects at Shell."
Exxon,2017-6,"BP said it has bolstered safety operations globally since the spill, introducing a safety and operational risk staff with 800 positions and an internal global wells organization to standardize drilling practices, among other measures.

Exxon,2017-6,"BP's growing deepwater investments irk some environmentalists, who say the company has fought paying what it owes to restore shorelines and communities damaged by its massive spill."
Exxon,2017-6,"""They never really fulfilled those promises, and people are very skeptical about them expanding drilling,"" said Raleigh Hoke, campaign director at Gulf Restoration Network in New Orleans."
Exxon,2017-6,Richard Sears - who served as chief scientist on the National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling - said such projects can be managed safely at low oil prices.
Exxon,2017-6,"The causes of the BP disaster had more to do with poor decision-making and slipshod safety systems than cost-cutting, said Sears, who previously managed production projects at Shell."
Exxon,2017-6,"BP said it has bolstered safety operations globally since the spill, introducing a safety and operational risk staff with 800 positions and an internal global wells organization to standardize drilling practices, among other measures. The company says it cannot precisely estimate new spending on safety since the spill because its efforts are integrated into many parts of the company."
Exxon,2017-6,"In a glassed-in drilling shack on the Thunder Horse platform, operators stay connected to a new onshore command center in Houston that BP designed to monitor data from offshore wells."
Exxon,2017-6,"On the deck below sits a blowout preventer, a room-sized piece of equipment that would soon be fitted on the wellhead of a drilling site, two miles under water."
Exxon,2017-6,"But first it would need a safety inspection - unlike the blowout preventer that infamously failed to contain the 2010 spill, which federal regulators have said had not been inspected in years."

Exxon,2017-6,"ExxonMobil bought 100,000 tonnes of Urals, which was loaded in Primorsk on May 21 for delivery to its Esso refinery in Sri Racha in July. The shipment was possible due to low freight rates for the 15-year-old ice tanker's last voyage."
Exxon,2017-6,"An ExxonMobil spokesman said it was not company practice to discuss operational details. Exxon's Sri Racha refinery has processed Russian sweet ESPO Blend - traded in Asia-Pacific - but it will take Urals for the first time. Urals is not typically sold to Thailand because of the long distance, which makes shipping too expensive."
Exxon,2017-6,"Although Urals arbitrage to Asia has become more common this year due to a low Brent-Dubai spread and a shortage of sour crude in the region due to OPEC output cuts, it is unlikely Urals would be viable for deliveries to Thailand, traders said. ""Baltic Urals to Thailand on Aframax is just impossible if you want to make any money,"" a Urals market trader said. ""Above all Tempera is a 1A Super ice class tanker which would make the delivery even pricier."""
Exxon,2017-6,"Traders said if Exxon had sealed a big discount for the shipment it would be viable. The freight rate for Tempera's last voyage was not available. Neste Oil currently operates two other ice class tankers - Mastera, built a year after Tempera, and Stena Arctica."

Exxon,2017-6,"LONDON, June 21 (Reuters) - Energy giants including Exxon Mobil and Royal Dutch Shell risk wasting more than a third of their budgets on projects that will not be needed if climate targets are to be met, a thinktank report shows."
Exxon,2017-6,"More than $2 trillion of planned investment in oil and gas projects by 2025 could be redundant if governments stick to targets to lower carbon emissions to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius, according to a report by the Carbon Tracker thinktank and institutional investors."
Exxon,2017-6,"It compared the carbon intensity of oil and gas projects planned by 69 companies with requirements needed to meet the warming target set by the 2015 Paris agreement, which will require curbing fossil fuel consumption."
Exxon,2017-6,"It found Exxon, the world's top publicly-traded oil and gas company, risks wasting up to half its budget on new fields that will not be needed."
Exxon,2017-6,Shell and France's Total would see up to 40 percent of their budgets misspent.

Exxon,2017-6,"June 20 (Reuters) - Communities and oil refining and production facilities from Texas to Florida braced on Tuesday for potential disruptions as Tropical Storm Cindy strengthened over the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, threatening to bring flash floods across parts of the northern Gulf Coast."
Exxon,2017-6,"Cindy was located about 230 miles (365 km) south of Morgan City, Louisiana late Tuesday with maximum sustained winds of 60 miles (95 km) per hour, the National Hurricane Center said."
Exxon,2017-6,"The storm was moving toward the northwest near seven miles (11 km) per hour, and this motion was expected to continue through Wednesday."
Exxon,2017-6,"On the forecast track, the center of Cindy will approach the coast of southwest Louisiana and southeast Texas late Wednesday, and move inland over southeastern Texas on Thursday, the Miami-based weather forecaster said."
Exxon,2017-6,"A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for San Luis Pass, Texas to the Alabama-Florida border, Metropolitan New Orleans and Lake Pontchartrain."
Exxon,2017-6,"""The winds aren't looking to get much stronger than they are now,"" but some areas east of Houston and toward Florida could see as much as 12 inches of rain, said Stephen Strum, vice president of extended forecast services at Weather Decision Technologies in Tulsa, Oklahoma."

Exxon,2017-6,"Heavy rains and wind could disrupt oil supplies at the massive refining and production centers along the U.S. Gulf Coast, which could drive up prices for consumers.

Exxon,2017-6,"Exxon Mobil Corp , Phillips 66 , and Motiva Enterprises said the storm had not affected their refining operations."
Exxon,2017-6,"Cindy was expected to produce six to nine inches (15-23 cm) of rain with isolated maximum amounts of 12 inches over southeastern Louisiana, southern Mississippi, southern Alabama, and the Florida Panhandle through Thursday, the NHC said."
Exxon,2017-6,"Alabama Governor Kay Ivey declared a state of emergency. Officials in Houston, New Orleans and other cities along the Gulf Coast said they were monitoring developments. Florida Governor Rick Scott warned residents in the northwest part of his state to stay alert for flooding and heavy rain."
Exxon,2017-6,"The storm could cause a surge of one to three feet along the coast and possibly spawn tornados from southern Louisiana to the Florida Panhandle, the NHC said."

Exxon,2017-6,"{{20170620T144044.425+0000}}Exxon, BP support Republican elders' climate proposalBOSTON, June 20 (Reuters) - Major oil companies like Exxon Mobil and BP Plc have thrown their support behind a carbon tax plan proposed by a group of elder Republican statesmen, according to an advertisement published in the Wall Street Journal on Tuesday."
Exxon,2017-6,"The corporate support for the plan, which would impose a $40 tax on each ton of carbon dioxide produced, follows a decision by President Donald Trump to pull the United States out of the Paris Climate Agreement, a global pact that fights climate change by slashing emissions from burning fossil fuels."
Exxon,2017-6,"""This plan would achieve significantly greater emissions reductions than all current and prior climate regulations, while helping America's businesses and workers get ahead,"" according to the advertisement from the Climate Leadership Council."
Exxon,2017-6,"The ad bore the corporate symbols of companies such as Exxon, BP, Shell , Total , GM , Johnson & Johnson , and PepsiCo ."
Exxon,2017-6,"The Climate Leadership Council proposal was co-authored by James Baker, secretary of state during the administration of George H. W. Bush, and George Shultz, secretary of state under Ronald Reagan. The proposed $40 per ton tax on carbon would rise in price over time, and revenues would be paid into the Social Security Administration."
Exxon,2017-6,"While the plan echoes past attempts by parts of the Republican Party to address climate change, it could be a non-starter. Trump has expressed doubt over the existence of climate change and has said efforts to fight it put the United States at a competitive disadvantage."
Exxon,2017-6,A White House official did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The administration has previously said a carbon tax is not under consideration.
Exxon,2017-6,"An overwhelming majority of scientists believe that burning fossil fuels drives global climate change, has raised sea levels and triggered more frequent and powerful storms."
Exxon,2017-6,"Oil giants like Exxon and BP have been criticized for their roles in contributing to climate change through the production and marketing of fossil fuels. Still, in recent years, they have supported government efforts to regulate emissions, including through the Paris climate deal agreed by nearly 200 nations in 2015."
Exxon,2017-6,"Exxon Chief Executive Darren Woods had repeatedly urged Trump to keep the United States in the Paris deal, saying the country's abundant reserves of low-carbon natural gas made it well-placed to perform within the agreement."

Exxon,2017-6,"{{20170620T142925.064+0000}}Snam in exclusive talks to buy LNG terminal stake from Edison -sourcesMILAN, June 19 (Reuters) - Italian gas group Snam is in exclusive talks with EDF's Italian unit Edison to buy a stake in a liquefied natural gas terminal in northern Italy as part of plans to develop its LNG business, two sources said."
Exxon,2017-6,"Snam, controlled by state lender Cassa Depositi e Prestiti, is looking to buy Edison's 7.3 percent stake in Terminale LNG Adriatico and the gas pipeline that connects it to Italy's gas transmission backbone, the sources said."
Exxon,2017-6,"Adriatic LNG, which has a capacity of 8 billion cubic metres per year, is 70.7 percent owned by ExxonMobil and 22 percent by Qatar Petroleum. Exxon and Qatar have a pre-emption right on Edison's stake."
Exxon,2017-6,Edison said in June talks were under way to sell the stake and pipeline as well as two offices in Milan hosting its headquarters.
Exxon,2017-6,"""The idea is to wrap up the sale in the first half of July, though some slippage can't be ruled out,"" one of the sources said, adding Banca IMI was advising Edison on the deal."
Exxon,2017-6,"Snam, which makes most of its money from gas transmission, is looking to play a leading role in integrating Europe's grids and making Italy a European gas hub."
Exxon,2017-6,In its March business plan it said it would be looking at opportunities to grow its LNG infrastructure business.
Exxon,2017-6,"According to Italian newspaper Il Sole 24 Ore, Edison's stake in the Adriatic LNG platform has a book value of 159 million euros ($177 million) while the pipeline has a book value of 32 million euros."
Exxon,2017-6,It was not possible to confirm these values but one of the sources said if a deal went through it would be for a higher price.

Exxon,2017-6,"CALGARY, Alberta/HOUSTON, June 19 (Reuters) - In the boreal forests and on the remote prairies of Alberta, a handful of firms are running pilot projects they hope will end a two-decade drought in innovation and stem the exodus of top global energy firms from Canada's oil sands."
Exxon,2017-6,They are searching for a breakthrough that will cut the cost of pumping the tar-like oil from the country's vast underground bitumen reservoirs and better compete with the booming shale industry in the United States.
Exxon,2017-6,"If they fail, a bigger chunk of the world's third-largest oil reserves will stay in the ground. Canada's oil sands sector has become one of the biggest victims of the global oil price crash that began in 2014 when top OPEC producer Saudi Arabia flooded the market with cheap crude to drive out high cost competitors."
Exxon,2017-6,"This year alone, oil majors have sold over $22.5 billion of assets in Canada's energy industry, and been lured south to invest in the higher returns of U.S. shale."
Exxon,2017-6,"Joseph Kuhach is among the entrepreneurs in Canada hoping they can turn the tide. He runs a small Calgary-based firm, Nsolv, that is testing the use of solvents to liquefy the bitumen buried in the sands and make it flow as oil."
Exxon,2017-6,Kuhach says using solvents can cut 20 to 40 percent from the cost of producing the oil. The technique currently used is to use steam to heat the sands underground to extract the oil.
Exxon,2017-6,"It's a hard sell, he said, to Canadian producers struggling with low oil prices. They are reluctant to invest in a multi-million dollar technology that is unproven on a commercial scale, he said."
Exxon,2017-6,"""The comment I hear so often when I am talking to companies is, 'We want to be the very first in line to be second',"" said Kuhach. ""It's easier to go after incremental improvements that they can back away from with no great cost and no great risk."""
Exxon,2017-6,"Nsolv is winding down a three-year pilot project with Canada's second-largest energy producer Suncor Energy at its Dover oil sands lease in northern Alberta. Suncor is evaluating the results, the firm's spokeswoman Erin Rees said."
Exxon,2017-6,"Fourth-largest producer Imperial Oil , controlled by ExxonMobil Corp , is also developing solvent technology and has had an ongoing C$100-million pilot project since 2013, the company said."
Exxon,2017-6,"The caution of oil sands producers stems in part from the unique challenges of operating here, where projects take years to build and require billions of dollars in upfront capital."
Exxon,2017-6,"The development of the technique using steam two decades ago made Canada's sands the new frontier for the oil industry, and majors were among the firms that flocked to buy in."
Exxon,2017-6,"Since then, innovation has stalled. That failure, energy-industry entrepreneurs and venture capitalists told Reuters, is rooted in a risk-averse culture that has left oil sands years behind U.S. shale."
Exxon,2017-6,"The exodus of international oil firms such as Royal Dutch Shell and Statoil ASA from oil sands has made innovation tougher because there are fewer potential customers who might adopt new technology, said Joe Gasca, chairman of Fractal Systems Inc. His firm processes bitumen into higher-quality crude at the wellhead."
Exxon,2017-6,"Fractal is running a 1,000 barrel-per-day (bpd) test plant in eastern Alberta for third-largest producer Cenovus Energy , which has yet to make a decision on whether to proceed commercially."
Exxon,2017-6,"The shale sector moved fast to innovate and cut costs to survive the oil price crash. In 2014, producing oil from most shale fields cost more than the average $60 a barrel needed for a new Canadian oil sands project to make money. Now, there are some shale patches that can make a profit at $15 a barrel. [nL1N1DU2DQ]"
Exxon,2017-6,It takes months of pumping steam into underground reservoirs before bitumen starts to flow from the oil sands. That makes engineers reluctant to experiment with the delicate balance of heat and pressure.
Exxon,2017-6,"Shale, by contrast, provides comparatively fertile ground for innovation. The initial investment is a fraction of what the cost of an oil sands project. Relatively easy access encourages competition as the many firms involved look for an edge. Wells can be drilled quickly. The stakes are lower and the scale is smaller if experiments fail."
Exxon,2017-6,"Drilling longer wells and being better able to pinpoint where in those wells to fracture the rock, among other techniques, have supercharged U.S. shale output in the past two years. That has boosted firms including Noble Energy and Devon Energy and drawn billions of dollars in new private equity investment.[nL1N1HF0L2]"
Exxon,2017-6,"Canadian producers have fewer projects to experiment with and are unwilling to risk their massive upfront investments, said Steve Fisher, chief executive of Calgary-based startup Veerum."
Exxon,2017-6,"""Shale is like going on a date, the oil sands is like getting married,"" he said. ""The risk for capital is high in the oil sands, you have massive assets that need to complete on time and operate for 40 years to make money."""
Exxon,2017-6,"Veerum's technology cuts capital costs by tracking how accurately a new project sticks to design specifications during construction, reducing the need for costly fixes later."
Exxon,2017-6,"The company is supported by GE's Zone Startups Calgary, an incubator for new firms in the energy capital of Canada."
Exxon,2017-6,"Another hurdle to innovation is the lack of sales and marketing expertise in the city's oil industry to carry ideas through to commercial execution, said Marty Reed, chief executive of clean-tech fund Evok Innovations."
Exxon,2017-6,"""At $100 a barrel it didn't take a sales and marketing genius to sell the product,"" Reed said. ""But if you are a new company trying to get Suncor to adopt a new widget those skills are crucial."""
Exxon,2017-6,Evok was launched last year with a C$100 million investment from Cenovus and Suncor over 10 years to accelerate development of technologies to cut oil sands costs and emissions.
Exxon,2017-6,"Since oil prices began falling in 2014, the long-term forecast for oil sands output in 2030 has fallen to 3.7 million bpd, down from 5.2 million bpd, according to the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers. Current output is around 2.4 million bpd."
Exxon,2017-6,"Expansion will mostly come from adding units at existing projects, given new projects are unprofitable at current international oil prices of around $45 a barrel."
Exxon,2017-6,"Canadian oil sands producers recognize that innovation is crucial for their survival, and some firms are spending more."
Exxon,2017-6,"The country's top energy producer Canadian Natural Resources Ltd allocated C$549 million ($406.97 million) or 14 percent of its 2016 C$3.8 billion capital budget on research and development (R&D), up 4 percent from C$527 million in 2015, when capital spending was higher."
Exxon,2017-6,"""It's mostly about incremental gains, but we do have some big stuff that could change things,"" Canadian Natural President Steve Laut told reporters last month, declining to elaborate."
Exxon,2017-6,"Suncor and Imperial both held R&D spending steady from the previous year while reducing overall capital budgets. Suncor spent C$150 million, or 3 percent of its budget in 2016 on what it calls ""step-change technologies"", while Imperial spent C$195 million, roughly 17 percent of its budget, company filings showed."
Exxon,2017-6,The firms all said they were working on ways to reduce costs and environmental impact. Producers also said new technology is often developed in the field during normal operations and does not necessarily show up in R&D budgets.
Exxon,2017-6,"A number of producers, including Cenovus and Suncor are looking at ways to add solvents to steam in their commercial operations."
Exxon,2017-6,"Unlike the solvent-only technique being pitched by Nsolv, this would allow firms to adapt existing thermal plants rather than build new ones, Kuhach said."
Exxon,2017-6,"Even if pilot steam-and-solvent projects are successful, it would take another three to five years for the technology to spread across the industry, said Dan Wicklum, chief executive of the Canadian Oil Sands Innovation Alliance."
Exxon,2017-6,"Vancouver-based Chrysalix Venture Capital has become more cautious about new oil sands investments since the oil majors pulled out, Chief Executive Wal van Lierop said, but is investing in technologies that may prove valuable to the sector."
Exxon,2017-6,"""I am really hoping we can get breakthrough technologies, but I don't see them yet,"" he said."
Exxon,2017-6,"""Mediocracy will not help. It will be go big or go home."""

Exxon,2017-6,{{20170619T225237.423+0000}}UPDATE 4-EQT to create biggest U.S. natgas producer with $6.7 bln Rice deal* Deal would create biggest U.S. natural gas producer
Exxon,2017-6,June 19 (Reuters) - EQT Corp was set to leapfrog Exxon Mobil as the largest U.S. natural gas producer after saying on Monday it agreed to a deal to buy fellow Appalachian gas and oil firm Rice Energy for $6.7 billion.
Exxon,2017-6,"The tie-up would join two of the largest players in the Marcellus and Utica Shale formations, which stretch across much of Pennsylvania and Ohio and are ideally situated to supply gas throughout the U.S. Northeast."
Exxon,2017-6,"Rice Energy also provides technological expertise to EQT, which has operated in the Marcellus since 2009."
Exxon,2017-6,"""EQT is a decade behind in fracking technology used by industry leaders in the Marcellus/Utica,"" said Dallas Salazar, CEO of energy consulting firm Atlas Consulting. ""EQT needs a lot, and Rice offers a lot of what it needs."""
Exxon,2017-6,"Technology improvements allow companies to drill sideways over a longer distance, making adjacent land with gas deposits more attractive. On average, the acquisition will increase EQT's sideways drilling capacity by 50 percent in two Pennsylvania counties."
Exxon,2017-6,Controlling production costs is important when U.S. natural gas prices remain low due to abundant supply. The Henry Hub U.S. benchmark's average price of $3.02 per million British thermal units so far in 2017 is well below the 10-year average of $4.42.
Exxon,2017-6,"EQT has identified $2.5 billion of cost savings from the proposed merger, as well as benefits from moving some of Rice's midstream assets into its pipeline business, EQT Midstream Partners . Analysts at Mizuho have estimated those assets to be worth $1.3 billion."
Exxon,2017-6,"The proposed transaction, scheduled to close in the fourth quarter, would be the biggest ever for EQT, increasing its 2017 average sales volume by 1.3 billion cubic feet equivalent per day (bcfe/d) and core acres in the Marcellus field by 187,000 to 670,000."
Exxon,2017-6,"It is offering Rice Energy shareholders $5.30 per share in cash and 0.37 EQT shares for each share held, equivalent to $27.04 per Rice Energy share. Reuters calculations show that represents a 37.3 percent premium to Friday's closing price."
Exxon,2017-6,Rice Energy's shares surged 24.8 percent to $24.57. EQT's shares slid 9 percent.
Exxon,2017-6,"In a later filing, EQT said Citigroup, its financial adviser, had commited to back the deal with bridge loans worth $1.4 billion. Should the deal collapse, Rice would pay a termination fee of up to $255 million."
Exxon,2017-6,"EQT will issue debt to cover the cash component and $5.4 billion of equity, and will assume or refinance $1.5 billion of net debt and preferred equity belonging to Rice Energy, according to a company presentation."
Exxon,2017-6,"Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz were EQT's legal advisers. Barclays Capital was Rice Energy's financial adviser and Vinson & Elkins its legal adviser."

Exxon,2017-6,"The development comes as Exxon, the world's largest publicly traded oil producer, fights accusations by environmentalists and others that it misled investors and the public for years about the risks of climate change from fossil fuels.[nL1N1J61IZ]"
Exxon,2017-6,"In the past decade, Exxon has boosted investment in fuel cells, biodiesel, algae and other alternative energy technologies, in collaboration with private partners. The company also has invested in television advertisements to tout its renewable energy investments, including during last summer's Olympic Games.[nL1N1AY0UK]"
Exxon,2017-6,"""Algae can be a viable, renewable source for volumes of oil at scale,"" said Vijay Swarup, Exxon's vice president for research and development."
Exxon,2017-6,"""We like algae because it's fast-growing, doesn't compete for food and water and can grow in all sorts of climates and brackish water."""
Exxon,2017-6,Exxon and Synthetic cautioned that they are far from being able to run the process at commercial scale.
Exxon,2017-6,"The oil company's ultimate goal is to make an oil from algae that can be processed by existing refineries, though that goal remains elusive."
Exxon,2017-6,"Exxon began working with California-based Synthetic on algae research in 2009. The lab work is conducted at Synthetic facilities and funded by Exxon, which declined to disclose its financial investment."
Exxon,2017-6,"Scientists studied the way that algae cells partition carbon - typically from carbon dioxide - and produce lipids, a kind of hydrocarbon. Algae converts carbon dioxide into lipids much in the same way the human body converts sugar into fat."
Exxon,2017-6,"The scientists were able to genetically modify algae to convert 40 percent of CO2 into lipids, up from a prior 15 percent."
Exxon,2017-6,"""This was not an overnight breakthrough. This was a lot of sweat and toil,"" said Craig Venter, chairman of Synthetic Genomics."
Exxon,2017-6,"Up next, scientists will need to unlock how to speed up the process and strengthen the algae cells."
Exxon,2017-6,"""This just gives us hope and optimism that we're on the right track,"" said Swarup."

Exxon,2017-6,"CALGARY, Alberta/HOUSTON, June 19 (Reuters) - In the boreal forests and on the remote prairies of Alberta, a handful of firms are running pilot projects they hope will end a two-decade drought in innovation and stem the exodus of top global energy firms from Canada's oil sands."
Exxon,2017-6,They are searching for a breakthrough that will cut the cost of pumping the tar-like oil from the country's vast underground bitumen reservoirs and better compete with the booming shale industry in the United States.
Exxon,2017-6,"If they fail, a bigger chunk of the world's third-largest oil reserves will stay in the ground. Canada's oil sands sector has become one of the biggest victims of the global oil price crash that began in 2014 when top OPEC producer Saudi Arabia flooded the market with cheap crude to drive out high cost competitors."
Exxon,2017-6,"This year alone, oil majors have sold over $22.5 billion of assets in Canada's energy industry, and been lured south to invest in the higher returns of U.S. shale."
Exxon,2017-6,"Joseph Kuhach is among the entrepreneurs in Canada hoping they can turn the tide. He runs a small Calgary-based firm, Nsolv, that is testing the use of solvents to liquefy the bitumen buried in the sands and make it flow as oil."
Exxon,2017-6,Kuhach says using solvents can cut 20 to 40 percent from the cost of producing the oil. The technique currently used is to use steam to heat the sands underground to extract the oil.
Exxon,2017-6,"It's a hard sell, he said, to Canadian producers struggling with low oil prices. They are reluctant to invest in a multi-million dollar technology that is unproven on a commercial scale, he said."
Exxon,2017-6,"""The comment I hear so often when I am talking to companies is, 'We want to be the very first in line to be second',"" said Kuhach. ""It's easier to go after incremental improvements that they can back away from with no great cost and no great risk."""
Exxon,2017-6,"Nsolv is winding down a three-year pilot project with Canada's second-largest energy producer Suncor Energy at its Dover oil sands lease in northern Alberta. Suncor is evaluating the results, the firm's spokeswoman Erin Rees said."
Exxon,2017-6,"Fourth-largest producer Imperial Oil , controlled by ExxonMobil Corp , is also developing solvent technology and has had an ongoing C$100-million pilot project since 2013, the company said."
Exxon,2017-6,"The caution of oil sands producers stems in part from the unique challenges of operating here, where projects take years to build and require billions of dollars in upfront capital."
Exxon,2017-6,"The development of the technique using steam two decades ago made Canada's sands the new frontier for the oil industry, and majors were among the firms that flocked to buy in."
Exxon,2017-6,"Since then, innovation has stalled. That failure, energy-industry entrepreneurs and venture capitalists told Reuters, is rooted in a risk-averse culture that has left oil sands years behind U.S. shale."
Exxon,2017-6,"The exodus of international oil firms such as Royal Dutch Shell and Statoil ASA from oil sands has made innovation tougher because there are fewer potential customers who might adopt new technology, said Joe Gasca, chairman of Fractal Systems Inc. His firm processes bitumen into higher-quality crude at the wellhead."
Exxon,2017-6,"Fractal is running a 1,000 barrel-per-day (bpd) test plant in eastern Alberta for third-largest producer Cenovus Energy , which has yet to make a decision on whether to proceed commercially."
Exxon,2017-6,"The shale sector moved fast to innovate and cut costs to survive the oil price crash. In 2014, producing oil from most shale fields cost more than the average $60 a barrel needed for a new Canadian oil sands project to make money. Now, there are some shale patches that can make a profit at $15 a barrel. [nL1N1DU2DQ]"
Exxon,2017-6,It takes months of pumping steam into underground reservoirs before bitumen starts to flow from the oil sands. That makes engineers reluctant to experiment with the delicate balance of heat and pressure.
Exxon,2017-6,"Shale, by contrast, provides comparatively fertile ground for innovation. The initial investment is a fraction of what the cost of an oil sands project. Relatively easy access encourages competition as the many firms involved look for an edge. Wells can be drilled quickly. The stakes are lower and the scale is smaller if experiments fail."
Exxon,2017-6,"Drilling longer wells and being better able to pinpoint where in those wells to fracture the rock, among other techniques, have supercharged U.S. shale output in the past two years. That has boosted firms including Noble Energy and Devon Energy and drawn billions of dollars in new private equity investment.[nL1N1HF0L2]"
Exxon,2017-6,"Canadian producers have fewer projects to experiment with and are unwilling to risk their massive upfront investments, said Steve Fisher, chief executive of Calgary-based startup Veerum."
Exxon,2017-6,"""Shale is like going on a date, the oil sands is like getting married,"" he said. ""The risk for capital is high in the oil sands, you have massive assets that need to complete on time and operate for 40 years to make money."""
Exxon,2017-6,"Veerum's technology cuts capital costs by tracking how accurately a new project sticks to design specifications during construction, reducing the need for costly fixes later."
Exxon,2017-6,"The company is supported by GE's Zone Startups Calgary, an incubator for new firms in the energy capital of Canada."
Exxon,2017-6,"Another hurdle to innovation is the lack of sales and marketing expertise in the city's oil industry to carry ideas through to commercial execution, said Marty Reed, chief executive of clean-tech fund Evok Innovations."
Exxon,2017-6,"""At $100 a barrel it didn't take a sales and marketing genius to sell the product,"" Reed said. ""But if you are a new company trying to get Suncor to adopt a new widget those skills are crucial."""
Exxon,2017-6,Evok was launched last year with a C$100 million investment from Cenovus and Suncor over 10 years to accelerate development of technologies to cut oil sands costs and emissions.
Exxon,2017-6,"Since oil prices began falling in 2014, the long-term forecast for oil sands output in 2030 has fallen to 3.7 million bpd, down from 5.2 million bpd, according to the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers. Current output is around 2.4 million bpd."
Exxon,2017-6,"Expansion will mostly come from adding units at existing projects, given new projects are unprofitable at current international oil prices of around $45 a barrel."
Exxon,2017-6,"Canadian oil sands producers recognize that innovation is crucial for their survival, and some firms are spending more."
Exxon,2017-6,"The country's top energy producer Canadian Natural Resources Ltd allocated C$549 million ($406.97 million) or 14 percent of its 2016 C$3.8 billion capital budget on research and development (R&D), up 4 percent from C$527 million in 2015, when capital spending was higher."
Exxon,2017-6,"""It's mostly about incremental gains, but we do have some big stuff that could change things,"" Canadian Natural President Steve Laut told reporters last month, declining to elaborate."
Exxon,2017-6,"Suncor and Imperial both held R&D spending steady from the previous year while reducing overall capital budgets. Suncor spent C$150 million, or 3 percent of its budget in 2016 on what it calls ""step-change technologies"", while Imperial spent C$195 million, roughly 17 percent of its budget, company filings showed."
Exxon,2017-6,The firms all said they were working on ways to reduce costs and environmental impact. Producers also said new technology is often developed in the field during normal operations and does not necessarily show up in R&D budgets.
Exxon,2017-6,"A number of producers, including Cenovus and Suncor are looking at ways to add solvents to steam in their commercial operations."
Exxon,2017-6,"Unlike the solvent-only technique being pitched by Nsolv, this would allow firms to adapt existing thermal plants rather than build new ones, Kuhach said."
Exxon,2017-6,"Even if pilot steam-and-solvent projects are successful, it would take another three to five years for the technology to spread across the industry, said Dan Wicklum, chief executive of the Canadian Oil Sands Innovation Alliance."
Exxon,2017-6,"Vancouver-based Chrysalix Venture Capital has become more cautious about new oil sands investments since the oil majors pulled out, Chief Executive Wal van Lierop said, but is investing in technologies that may prove valuable to the sector."
Exxon,2017-6,"""I am really hoping we can get breakthrough technologies, but I don't see them yet,"" he said."
Exxon,2017-6,"""Mediocracy will not help. It will be go big or go home."""

Exxon,2017-6,"LULIANG, China, June 19 (Reuters) - Chinese state oil giants Sinopec and PetroChina are waging war at the nation's gas pumps, slashing prices at unprecedented rates in an effort to reclaim sales lost to private local and foreign rivals in the $440 billion retail fuel market."
Exxon,2017-6,"The rare price war kicked off in late March as Sinopec <0386.HK> reported first quarter retail sales had slid to a three-year low. Spurred by a glut of fuel, Sinopec started offering hefty discounts in response to ad-hoc but frequent promotions by independent petrol station operators."
Exxon,2017-6,"PetroChina <0857.HK> swiftly joined in, triggering a ferocious battle against independents and international firms including Shell and BP , said three state oil sources involved in retail fuel marketing."
Exxon,2017-6,"The heavy discounting is now spreading from the most heavily oversupplied provinces in China's north, squeezing fat retail profit margins in the world's No. 2 fuel market."
Exxon,2017-6,"In the gritty northern coal town of Luliang, taxi and delivery drivers were queued up at a Sinopec outlet after it slashed pump prices by 1.4 yuan ($0.21) per litre, or nearly a quarter, one recent weekend."
Exxon,2017-6,"""We all know Sinopec has higher gas quality but it was so expensive, so before I went to independent stations to fill my vehicle,"" one driver surnamed Zhang told Reuters as he waited to gas up his dusty, grey 7-seat van. ""Now I switch to Sinopec and will keep visiting here as long as Sinopec offers discounts like this."""
Exxon,2017-6,"Nearby gas stations run by PetroChina and local private operator Taihua each offered the same discount, promoting the bargain prices with eye-catching red banners, free car washes, and credits in pre-paid petrol cards."
Exxon,2017-6,"Sinopec spokesman Lu Dapeng said price cutting was ""the most common approach in market competition"". He didn't elaborate."
Exxon,2017-6,"Such basement prices are rare for Sinopec, officially known as China Petroleum & Chemical Corp <600028.SS>, and PetroChina, the listed subsidiary of China National Petroleum Corporation."
Exxon,2017-6,"In late March, both were selling high grade fuel at a discount of just 0.20-0.40 yuan per litre."
Exxon,2017-6,"""As the independents deepened discounts to unbearable levels, Sinopec responded by launching targeted attacks to reclaim lost sales,"" said a state oil marketing official."
Exxon,2017-6,"Price battles were rare before 2013 as rigid government price controls capped margins. As recently as 2010, gas stations rationed diesel fuel as shortage hit."
Exxon,2017-6,"But the plunge in global oil prices since 2014 and the sudden rise of independent refineries known as teapots transformed the market by flooding the country's 90,000 petrol stations with cheaper fuels."
Exxon,2017-6,"Short of retail infrastructure and barred from exports, teapots sell oil mostly to the country's 40,000-plus private petrol stations, many run by families or independent fuel dealers"
Exxon,2017-6,"""The huge surplus the teapot oil plants have created is eroding the 80-percent market share the two oil giants used to hold several years ago,"" said Yan Kefeng, veteran oil researcher with IHS Markit."
Exxon,2017-6,"Sinopec and PetroChina now control around two-thirds of retail sales and independents about a quarter, according to Yu Chang, a former retail director with Shell China and the founder of AutoGo, a fuel retailing e-platform."
Exxon,2017-6,"The battle has also drawn in global players such as BP, Shell, Total and Exxon . Foreign firms now own and operate nearly 4,000 stations accounting for about 8 percent of sales, mostly in joint-ventures with Sinopec or PetroChina."
Exxon,2017-6,"""There has been price volatility in the fuel retailing market with seasonal demand and supply changes,"" Shell wrote in an email. Shell has rapidly boosted its retail network in China and now has a total of 1,200 sites."
Exxon,2017-6,"While margins have taken a hit, Sinopec and PetroChina are far from losing money in their retail businesses, thanks to their market dominance in key consuming regions in the south and east where there is little need for discounts and wealthier motorists are less sensitive to price cuts."
Exxon,2017-6,"Compared to 5.24 yuan a litre in Luliang, Beijing motorists pay around 6.66 yuan for 95-octane, euro-5 quality gasoline. Beijing prices are some 12 percent above the premium gasoline in California, but about half that of Singapore prices."
Exxon,2017-6,Sources at rivals say Sinopec may also be leading the charge as it aims to stem falling retail fuel sales and bolster its retail business ahead of a planned multi-billion-dollar IPO.
Exxon,2017-6,"Even with the hit in sales, Sinopec's network of 30,000 fuel stations and more than 23,000 convenience stores is considered a jewel in the crown. The division is estimated by analysts to be worth as much as $58 billion. [nL4N1EU1X6] ($1 = 6.7973 Chinese yuan renminbi)"

Exxon,2017-6,"WASHINGTON, June 16 (Reuters Breakingviews) - The U.S. Senate's decision to punch back against Russia has landed a presidential double whammy. Lawmakers in the upper chamber voted overwhelmingly, by 98 to two, to back sanctions on the old enemy as payback for the Kremlin's election meddling. They also took the unusual step of restricting the White House's ability to roll them back."
Exxon,2017-6,"Russia was already grappling with a series of sanctions the Obama administration imposed after Putin annexed Crimea in 2014. The measures targeted Russian oil firms like Rosneft , Gazprom and Lukoil and prevented the Bank of Moscow , VEB and other financial institutions from securing longer-term U.S. dollar-denominated debt. Foreign firms, meanwhile, had to put projects on hold, like Exxon Mobil's $3.2 billion Arctic oil-exploration deal with Rosneft."
Exxon,2017-6,"It's up to the Treasury Department to target firms and individuals, but the Senate bill mentions Gazprom's Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline to Europe. Shares in firms financing the $10 billion project, including Shell , Engie and Wintershall, fell on Thursday."
Exxon,2017-6,"The bill contains more worrying details for Putin. First, senators have given the go-ahead for Treasury to target Russia's railways, shipping, metals and mining sectors. Second, it wants the department to review the potential effects of imposing sanctions on Russia's sovereign debt."
Exxon,2017-6,"It's bad timing for Russia. Its economy only recently started pulling out of a recession that started in 2014. GDP may only grow by 1.4 percent by 2018, reckons the World Bank. New sanctions could wipe that out."
Exxon,2017-6,"Putin and his government are not the Senate's only target, though. The bill also prohibits President Donald Trump from softening or removing any of the sanctions without congressional approval. That smacks of an admonishment to a president and an administration whose ties to Russia and Putin have become deeply unsettling."
Exxon,2017-6,"Convincing 98 senators to curb his sanctions power is a remarkable feat, and only likely to be repeated when the bill hits the House. The legislative branch's assertion of its power suggests Trump may face more obstacles pushing his agenda."
Exxon,2017-6,- The U.S. Senate on June 15 voted 98 to two in favor of legislation that would allow the government to impose new sanctions on Russia and require President Donald Trump to get congressional approval before rolling back any existing sanctions.
Exxon,2017-6,"- The bill, if also passed by the House of Representatives and signed by Trump, would codify into law penalties outlined in several executive orders on Russian sanctions signed by former President Barack Obama starting in 2014. The proposal also permits the U.S. Treasury to impose new sanctions, if it sees fit, on Russian mining, metals, shipping and railways companies, as well as on Russians involved in cyber attacks or providing weapons to the Syrian government."
Exxon,2017-6,"- The Senate bill is intended to punish Russia for meddling in the 2016 U.S. election, its annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region and for backing the Syrian government in the country's civil war. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on June 16 that the Russian government takes an extremely negative view of the sanctions, which could harm other countries that have to adhere to the proposed rules."

Exxon,2017-6,{{20170614T060002.756+0000}}INSIGHT-Secret rebates send European plastics benchmark above true cost* Ethylene benchmark written into purchase contracts for plastics
Exxon,2017-6,* Benchmark provider says not its job to factor in discounts
Exxon,2017-6,"LONDON, June 14 (Reuters) - An unregulated benchmark used to set the price of plastics in Europe has veered above the true cost in recent years, because of secret rebates chemical companies give each other that disguise the price of the main precursor, four sources familiar with the industry say."
Exxon,2017-6,"Ethylene, a flammable gas, is the main feedstock used to synthesise the most commonly used plastics, found in the vast majority of all manufactured goods. It is produced in refineries from natural gas or crude oil, as one of the main products of the $400 billion global petrochemicals industry."
Exxon,2017-6,"When manufacturers buy and sell plastic, a benchmark of the ethylene price is often written into their purchase contracts, to reflect the raw material cost."
Exxon,2017-6,"But the European index is unregulated and, the sources said, has overstated the actual price for the past four years because it does not take into account the now common practice of firms negotiating rebates."
Exxon,2017-6,The sources include one person at a petrochemical company and three people who research the industry.
Exxon,2017-6,"The actual price companies charge each other for the chemical is secret, and companies tend to offer big clients discounts from the benchmark to reflect economies of scale, local market conditions, or other factors. But those discounts have grown, making the benchmark a less accurate reflection of the real costs."
Exxon,2017-6,"Companies do not have to pass the rebates on to their customers further down the supply chain, who are contractually obliged to pay prices based on the higher benchmark."
Exxon,2017-6,"Reuters was unable to assess the degree to which the practice has hurt manufacturers of goods made from plastics. More than 10 companies that buy or sell ethylene, contacted by Reuters, declined to discuss their pricing, including any rebates they offer or receive."
Exxon,2017-6,"Most of the sources that spoke to Reuters said they did not believe rebates had made the market unfair. But they say the lack of transparency, and the divergence between the published benchmark and the true price, could create the potential for suppliers to overcharge customers who may be unaware of the practice."
Exxon,2017-6,"""There's an understanding that this is not a perfect process,"" said Matthew Thoelke, senior director of olefins and derivatives at analysis firm IHS."
Exxon,2017-6,"The sources said the petrochemical companies that participate in setting the ethylene contract price while giving or receiving rebates include Europe's biggest, such as BASF, Royal Dutch Shell, Total and LyondellBasell. BASF, Shell and Total declined to comment on their pricing. LyondellBasell did not respond to Reuters request for comment."
Exxon,2017-6,"The benchmark for the price of ethylene used in nearly all European contracts is produced by the Independent Chemical Information Service, or ICIS, which has published its ""ethylene contract price"" since 1980."
Exxon,2017-6,"ICIS is now a unit of Reed Business Information. Thomson Reuters, parent company of Reuters, competes with Reed as a supplier of benchmark prices for other commodities but does not publish a rival index price for ethylene."
Exxon,2017-6,"ICIS senior editor Nel Weddle said the benchmark, published after confirming agreements with at least four companies who buy and sell ethylene, allows everyone to start on a ""level playing field"" with knowledge of prices."
Exxon,2017-6,"However, the figures it uses to compile the index do not include rebates off the benchmark price. ICIS said it is not responsible for collecting information about such rebates, which it called ""a common part of any supply or purchase contract""."
Exxon,2017-6,"Although ICIS is the most widely used benchmark in Europe, it is not the only one. A competitor, Argus, publishes a rival index, which also does not take rebates into account. It declined to comment."
Exxon,2017-6,"Another competitor, Platts, has launched a new rival index which it says will better reflect the true market price by taking into account the rebates."
Exxon,2017-6,"The sources familiar with the practice said refineries began offering substantial rebates in 2013 to clear their stocks during a period of oversupply of ethylene. But instead of being a temporary measure to deal with local market conditions, the rebates grew after oil and gas prices tumbled in 2014, and have continued to widen since."
Exxon,2017-6,"The contract price of ethylene has hovered around 850-1,050 euros per tonne over the past year, down from a range of 1,200-1,300 euros before oil and gas prices fell in 2014. Rebates now run at more than 100 euros a tonne, the sources said."
Exxon,2017-6,"One of the sources, at a major research consultancy, said his firm's staff use their own contacts at chemical companies to get a sense of the secret rebates. The rebates are now a key to understanding the profitability of businesses in the sector, which is therefore harder to forecast solely from public data."
Exxon,2017-6,Weddle of ICIS said the company was not aware of complaints from users of its benchmark about its omission of the rebates.
Exxon,2017-6,"However, last year ICIS conducted a review of its methodology and posted feedback online from some users of the index. One of three respondents whose views ICIS posted wrote that the published prices should begin to reflect rebates."
Exxon,2017-6,"""Otherwise, the reported contract prices do not reflect the real market situation and especially smaller suppliers and consumers are left in the dark,"" the respondent wrote. ICIS confirmed that the response was genuine but declined to identify who had written it."
Exxon,2017-6,"Some in the industry who spoke to Reuters sought to play down the significance of the disparity between the index and the price after rebates, saying the market is competitive enough to prevent customers who rely on the benchmark being overcharged."
Exxon,2017-6,"While Europe's benchmarks have their problems, ""the situation in general is fair"", said Jose Manuel Martinez, the chief executive of the Spanish oil company Cepsa's petrochemicals business."
Exxon,2017-6,"Unlike benchmarks for crude oil or the major refined fuel products like diesel and gasoline, the ICIS benchmark for ethylene is not formally scrutinised by regulators, as ethylene contracts are not typically traded on securities exchanges."
Exxon,2017-6,"In the marketing materials for the rival Platts benchmark intended to address the problem by adjusting for rebates, Platts includes a graph comparing the contract price to what it says is its own assessment of the true price, based on the cost of raw materials, economic conditions and other fundamentals."
Exxon,2017-6,"The graph shows the ICIS contract price consistently higher than Platts' estimate from 2013 on, with the gap growing wider last year, when Platts estimates the true cost of ethylene bottomed out as low as 650 euros a tonne."
Exxon,2017-6,Platts says the early indications from its new index have shown large buyers typically receiving rebates of 14-18 percent.
Exxon,2017-6,"The issue appears mostly confined to Europe, rather than the United States or Asia, which have more liquid markets with higher volumes of spot trade of ethylene, making prices relatively transparent."
Exxon,2017-6,"""As long as a market is liquid, the players know how to behave,"" said Cepsa's Martinez."

Exxon,2017-6,{{20170613T184654.261+0000}}UPDATE 1-Qatar closes helium plants amid rift with Arab powers* Early sign of possible impact on global commodities markets
Exxon,2017-6,"DUBAI/DOHA, June 13 (Reuters) - Qatar, the world's second largest helium producer, has closed its two helium production plants because of the economic boycott imposed by other Arab states, industry sources told Reuters on Tuesday."
Exxon,2017-6,"The helium plants operated by RasGas, a subsidiary of state-owned Qatar Petroleum [QATPE.UL] (QP), were shut after Saudi Arabia closed its border with Qatar, blocking overland exports of the gas, a QP official told Reuters. RasGas is 70 percent owned by QP and U.S. giant Exxon Mobil has 30 percent."
Exxon,2017-6,"The official declined to be named under briefing rules. Phil Kornbluth, head of U.S.-based industry consultancy Kornbluth Helium Consulting, said his sources had confirmed the closure."
Exxon,2017-6,"The closure of the plants is a sign of how the rift between Qatar and Arab powers could affect commodities markets. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Bahrain cut diplomatic and transport ties last week, accusing Qatar of supporting terrorism, a charge Doha denies."
Exxon,2017-6,Qatar's exports of liquefied natural gas at Ras Laffan have been unaffected by the boycott.
Exxon,2017-6,"The impact on the global helium market was expected to be delayed, as consumers use up existing stocks and work out alternative supply options. Shipping by sea directly from Doha or through Oman would add complexity, risk and cost."
Exxon,2017-6,"But if the diplomatic dispute lasts a month or more, Kornbluth predicted there would be a global shortage and the last time that happened, prices doubled."
Exxon,2017-6,"""Helium is the single commodity that is affected most by this blockade because it's probably the only thing where Qatar is a major world producer and the supply has been completely cut off,"" he said."
Exxon,2017-6,"Among its uses, helium is used to cool superconducting magnets in medical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanners, as a lifting gas in balloons and airships, as a gas to breathe in deep-sea diving and to keep satellite instruments cool. It is derived from natural gas during processing."
Exxon,2017-6,"The two plants shut by Qatar have a combined annual production capacity of approximately 2 billion standard cubic feet of liquid helium and can meet about 25 percent of total world demand for the gas, according to RasGas' website."
Exxon,2017-6,Kornbluth said the helium plants had shut down after filling all available shipping containers and storage tanks. He forecast the closure was costing RasGas revenue.
Exxon,2017-6,"Helium, best known as a gas for filling party balloons and making the voice squeaky, is difficult to capture and store. The United States is the biggest producer in what is a $4.7 billion industry, according to Mordor Intelligence."
Exxon,2017-6,"Demand for the gas, driven particularly by Asia's booming manufacturing industry, is on the rise."
Exxon,2017-6,"U.S. reserves meanwhile are dwindling due to the lack of helium production from its oil and gas fields, and the country has already had to start importing helium from Qatar. Other helium-producing countries include Algeria, Russia, Canada and China, according to the U.S. Geological Survey."
Exxon,2017-6,"A Dubai-based vendor servicing the local market said on Tuesday it had not received new shipments from Qatar since last week, forcing it to dip into its stocks."
Exxon,2017-6,"Japan's Iwatani <8088.T>, which supplies helium to China and Southeast Asia, said it had a month's supply in stock. A spokesman told Reuters it was considering exporting on ships from a Qatari port, or sourcing from the United States."
Exxon,2017-6,"German industrial gases company Linde said it was working on meeting customers' requirements via helium sources in Australia, Algeria and the United States."
Exxon,2017-6,"Air Water <4088.T>, which imports from Qatar and sells in Japan, has shifted its helium supply automatically to the United States, a spokesman said."
Exxon,2017-6,"A source with direct knowledge of the matter said South Korea's importers, which source a third of their helium from Qatar, could suffer heavily."
Exxon,2017-6,"""We might have an indirect impact if U.S. helium prices go up,"" the source said."

Exxon,2017-6,"June 9 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp asked a New York court on Friday to reject another subpoena request from Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, arguing the prosecutor's recent claim to have found evidence Exxon misled investors was false and that he was abusing his investigative powers."
Exxon,2017-6,"The company said Schneiderman's allegation it had neglected to estimate the impact of future environmental regulation on new deals was ""frivolous"" and that no ""legitimate law enforcement need"" would be served by giving his office more documents."
Exxon,2017-6,"""For a prosecutor proceeding in good faith, the absence of any evidence of wrongdoing is grounds for closing an investigation, not expanding it,"" Exxon wrote in its filing with the court."

He is examining whether Exxon misled the public about its understanding of the effects of greenhouse gas emissions on the earth's climate. [nL1N1IZ0N6]
Exxon,2017-6,"The probe has already revealed Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who until December was chief executive of Exxon, used a separate email address and an alias, ""Wayne Tracker,"" to discuss climate change-related issues while at the company. [nL2N1GQ1T7]"
Exxon,2017-6,"Testimony Schneiderman made public on June 2 offered more details about how the company handled the ""Wayne Tracker"" account, which was first created in 2007. Exxon employee Connie Feinstein, an information technology manager for the oil company, told prosecutors changes in the email program Exxon used, along with an automatic process that deleted internal emails after 13 months, may have erased years' worth of ""Wayne Tracker"" emails."

Exxon,2017-6,"MOSCOW, June 8 (Reuters) - One of the world's fastest growing crude streams, Kazakhstan's CPC, is battling to find new buyers in a market saturated with light grades and with core European customers reluctant to buy more of the pungent oil blend even as its value has plunged."
Exxon,2017-6,"It is a familiar picture for oil producers which have struggled with oversupply in the past three years, sending oil prices from above $100 a barrel to less than $50 a now."
Exxon,2017-6,"But it is proving a particular challenge for Kazakhstan, which has joined the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other non-OPEC nations in a pact to reduce output."
Exxon,2017-6,"Under the deal, Astana pledged to keep overall production at 1.7 million barrels per day (bpd). At the same time, it needs to reward investors in its giant Kashagan oil project that produces CPC but which started up last year five years behind schedule."
Exxon,2017-6,"So Astana is letting oil firms hike output from Kashagan in the Caspian Sea, which means it must cut from elsewhere. But the extra flows are piling pressure on CPC's already falling value."
Exxon,2017-6,"In 2013, light CPC crude traded at an average annual premium of $0.15 a barrel to dated Brent, then during 2014-2016 it slid to a discount of $0.11-$0.18. In the first five months of 2017, the discount had widened further to as much as $1.23."
Exxon,2017-6,"""Now it is more expensive to delay Kashagan again rather than sell discounted CPC Blend. Shareholders need the project to work now,"" said one trader."
Exxon,2017-6,"Kashagan oil field has been developed by a consortium of China National Petroleum Corp [CNPET.UL], Exxon Mobil , Eni , Royal Dutch Shell , Total , Inpex <1605.T> and KazMunaiGas . Phase one cost $55 billion."
Exxon,2017-6,Rising output from Kashagan has pushed up oil flows through the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC) pipeline to the Black Sea port of Novorossiisk.
Exxon,2017-6,"The pipeline, which also transports oil from other parts of Kazakhstan and Russia, pumped an average of 700,000 bpd in the past decade. But after Kashagan production began at the end of 2016, volumes rose to 900,000 bpd last year."
Exxon,2017-6,"That figure could rise this year to 1.2 million-1.3 million bpd, according to Caspian pipeline consortium which manages the pipeline. [nL8N1IE3HB]"
Exxon,2017-6,"""The CPC Blend market is tough,"" said one trader in the Mediterranean, traditionally the biggest market for the crude. ""What's frightening is that we will have about 10 million tonnes extra of the grade to handle soon."""
Exxon,2017-6,"Selling any light crude has been made tough due to cuts by OPEC, whose members have tended to reduce output of heavier oil preferred by some refiners, leaving the market awash with lighter grades. But CPC has characteristics that add to the challenge."
Exxon,2017-6,"Unlike Russia's main Urals export blend, CPC is a more difficult fit for refiners because it has a high level of mercaptans, a group of pungent gases."
Exxon,2017-6,"""In some Mediterranean refineries, CPC Blend processing is simply restricted due to the smell and harmful emissions, while it is also corrosive, so you can only process it if you have anti-corrosive coat on refinery units,"" another trader said."
Exxon,2017-6,"In addition, more larger Suezmax crude carriers are being used to ship CPC as exports from Novorossiisk increase while the number of loading time slots remains limited. Some European ports will only take smaller Aframax vessels, traders said."
Exxon,2017-6,"""Mediterranean refiners are not very keen on CPC, so the grade is now flowing worldwide, from Poland to Japan,"" a source with a big European refiner said."
Exxon,2017-6,"Reuters Eikon data shows CPC Blend supplies to Asia increased sharply since the start of 2017, heading to markets where bigger Suezmax vessels help reduce transport costs."
Exxon,2017-6,"South Korea, India and Japan bought 800,000 tonnes, 700,000 tonnes and 600,000 tonnes of CPC respectively in January-May 2017. In the whole of 2016, those three countries bought 400,000 tonnes, 500,000 tonnes and 600,000 tonnes respectively."
Exxon,2017-6,"Elsewhere in Europe, Poland's PKN Orlen bought 700,000 tonnes of CPC this year for its Polish and Lithuanian refineries for the first time. [nL5N1GK53P]"
Exxon,2017-6,"But rising CPC shipments beyond its core Mediterranean market have not been enough to support its value. The grade that formerly balanced between premium and discount to BFOE has been traded far below dated Brent crude for six months, the longest period in its history, Reuters Eikon data showed."
Exxon,2017-6,"""I don't think CPC Blend differentials will bounce back to a premium to Brent anytime soon. Not in the current market,"" one trader in the Mediterranean market said."

Exxon,2017-6,"HOUSTON, June 1 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp investors will push to meet with oil company officials this summer to hash out elements of a climate-impact analysis following a shareholder vote calling for studies of technology and climate-related risks to its business."
Exxon,2017-6,"Exxon has said that it will reconsider its opposition to the request, not that it would begin discussions or initiate new studies. The shareholder proposal, filed by 54 groups including financial, religious and corporate governance activists, won the support on Wednesday of 62 percent of Exxon holders. [nL1N1IX15V]"
Exxon,2017-6,"""I anticipate we'll be having a meeting this summer,"" said Tracey Rembert, assistant director of Catholic Responsible Investing at Christian Brothers Investment Services, one of the 54 co-filers."
Exxon,2017-6,"The White House's decision on Thursday to withdraw from the Paris agreement on climate change has no bearing on the proposal. ""We expect the scenario assessment will start to be done quickly at Exxon,"" Rembert said. [nL1N1IY0MV]"
Exxon,2017-6,"The investors behind the proposal routinely met in past years with Exxon between December and February to discuss annual meeting proposals, she said. Earlier discussions because of the majority vote are in order."
Exxon,2017-6,"Rembert said the group will ask for Exxon to conduct scenario planning exercises that would look at risks from disruptive technology, climate or government policies. ""What are the black swan events that can take place beyond low oil prices, aggressive policies or shifting consumer preferences?"" she said."
Exxon,2017-6,The reconsideration at Exxon comes as Devon Energy and Hess Corp owners on Wednesday will weigh climate-impact resolutions.
Exxon,2017-6,"Ballot initiatives press for greater studies of the risk that government carbon-reduction efforts in the future make oil and gas reserves uneconomic to tap, leading to investment losses. Study proposals this year received at least 40 percent approval at Duke Energy , Marathon Petroleum and Southern Co , according to a tally by Ceres, a non-profit group that tracks environmental records of public companies."

Exxon,2017-6,"Addressing delegates at an African oil and gas conference earlier, Obiang Lima said he saw scope for adding another two FLNG terminals by year-end, as demand for LNG grew particularly on the continent."
Exxon,2017-6,"He said the latest OPEC member, who joined the oil producing cartel in May, has entered into a binding agreement with OneLNG SA to explore the liquefaction and commercialisation of natural gas in offshore Blocks O and I."
Exxon,2017-6,OneLNG is a joint venture between Golar LNG and Schlumberger to rapidly develop gas reserves into LNG.

Exxon,2017-6,"SINGAPORE/LONDON, June 5 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia and key allies on Monday cut ties with Qatar, the world's top seller of liquefied natural gas (LNG), stoking concern over any supply disruptions to neighbouring countries spilling over into global gas markets."
Exxon,2017-6,"Saudi Arabia, along with the United Arab Emirates and Egypt - both highly reliant on Qatari gas via pipeline and LNG - and Bahrain said they would sever all ties including transport links with Qatar, an escalation on past diplomatic spats. [nL3N1J21X4]"
Exxon,2017-6,"They accuse Qatar, which supplies roughly a third of global LNG - natural gas that has been converted to liquid form for export - of supporting extremism."
Exxon,2017-6,"U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who accompanied President Donald Trump on his trip to Saudi Arabia last month, was CEO of Exxon Mobil - Qatar's key Western partner in building its giant LNG export plants."
Exxon,2017-6,"As the rift lifted oil prices, LNG traders took a wait-and-see approach, alert to potential disruption of regional energy flows but erring on the assumption that any trade shocks could be contained given well supplied global markets."
Exxon,2017-6,Qatar's top clients in Japan and India quickly received reassurances that supplies would continue as usual. [nL3N1J21XS] [nT9N1EB00Q]
Exxon,2017-6,"Within hours of the diplomatic break, the UAE barred all vessels coming to or from Qatar using its popular anchorage point off Fujairah. [nL8N1J22XN]"
Exxon,2017-6,"The ban impacts about six LNG vessels linked to Qatar now anchored in the Fujairah zone which may need to be moved out, according to shipping data on Thomson Reuters."
Exxon,2017-6,But there was little sign yet of LNG supply being hit.
Exxon,2017-6,"""I cannot see this impacting exports of Qatari LNG outside the Arab world at all and it won't likely impact LNG and gas pipeline exports within the Arab world either,"" Morten Frisch, an independent LNG and gas industry consultant, said."
Exxon,2017-6,"Still, traders startled by the development began to plan for all eventualities, especially any upsets to piped gas supplies from Qatar to the UAE."
Exxon,2017-6,"The UAE consumes 1.8 billion cubic feet/day of Qatari gas via the Dolphin pipeline, and has LNG purchase agreements with its neighbour, leaving it doubly exposed to tit-for-tat measures, industry sources and traders said."
Exxon,2017-6,So far flows through Dolphin are unaffected but traders say even a partial shutdown would ripple through global gas markets by forcing the UAE to seek replacement LNG supply just as its domestic demand peaks.
Exxon,2017-6,"With LNG markets in bearish mood and demand weak, the UAE could cope with Qatar suspending its two to three monthly LNG deliveries by calling on international markets, but Dolphin piped flows are too large to fully replace."
Exxon,2017-6,"""A drop off in Dolphin deliveries would have a huge impact on LNG markets,"" one trader monitoring developments said."
Exxon,2017-6,"Egypt, while relying heavily on Qatari LNG brought in by Swiss commodity trade houses, is less vulnerable than the UAE because it has no direct deals with Qatar, domestic gas output is squeezing out the need for imports, and traders would be liable for any moves by Qatar to restrict exports."
Exxon,2017-6,"""Trafigura, Glencore and Vitol frequently take LNG from Qatar and deliver it to Egypt but they take ownership of the cargoes at the Qatari port and don't use Qatari ships, meaning technically that Qatar shouldn't have sway,"" one trade source said."
Exxon,2017-6,"In reality though, Qatar can block exports to certain countries by issuing so-called destination restrictions."
Exxon,2017-6,"""It's not clear yet,"" another LNG trader said of potential impacts to deliveries from Qatar to Egypt."
Exxon,2017-6,"Egypt is halfway through its annual LNG cargo delivery programme for the year, with 50 shipments left to arrive, of which at least 10 are of Qatari origin, a Cairo-based energy source said."
Exxon,2017-6,Retaliatory measures such as suspending LNG supply deals would leave Qatar free to push more volumes into Europe where it has access to several import terminals.
Exxon,2017-6,"Under that scenario, trade houses with supply commitments to Egypt could turn to the United States, Algeria and Nigeria for replacement cargoes, traders and industry sources said."
Exxon,2017-6,"The deterioration in ties between Qatar and Egypt contrasts with 2013 when the producer gifted five LNG cargoes to Egypt - when Mohamed Mursi, leader of the Muslim Brotherhood, served as president."

Exxon,2017-6,* Carbon credit hike could insulate more U.S. oil from future busts
Exxon,2017-6,"HOBBS, New Mexico, June 5 (Reuters) - Amid the frenetic activity of American shale oilfields recovering from a two-year recession sit a handful of oil towns that seemed impervious as many producers went into bankruptcy and the economy around them sank."
Exxon,2017-6,"Occidental Petroleum Corp and a few other oil producers with wells near this town on New Mexico's border with Texas steadily pumped low-cost oil through the downturn, using a technique that has been heralded worldwide as a way to reduce carbon emissions and boost oil output."
Exxon,2017-6,"""When everyone else in the oil industry was going down, Oxy kept working,"" said Joshua Grassham, vice president of Lea County State Bank and a Hobbs Chamber of Commerce board member. The city of 35,000 rests on the Permian oilfield, the largest oilfield in the United States."
Exxon,2017-6,"This way of drilling brings with it a sweetener for the oil industry to keep crude flowing: a tax credit that helps insulate these wells in a downturn, and could triple in size if Congress approves a new measure this summer."
Exxon,2017-6,"Such a move could extend by decades the producing life of hundreds more wells, increasing oil supply which would be a drag on prices. To date, the technique has been employed only at conventional oilfields, rather than on shale deposits. Some firms are studying how to put the technique to work in shale drilling, too."
Exxon,2017-6,"The drilling method harnesses the carbon dioxide produced during the extraction of oil or from power plants, and forces it back into the fields. That boosts the pressure underground and drives more oil to the surface."
Exxon,2017-6,"Their success could be replicated in oilfields across the United States if Congress approves the measure, which already enjoys broad bipartisan support. While the Trump administration has yet to say whether it supports the tax credit increase, the measure could also be a boon to the coal industry, which Trump wants to revitalize."
Exxon,2017-6,"The technique, one of several so-called enhanced oil recovery (EOR) strategies used to prolong the productive lifespan of oilfields and increase output, underpins around five percent of U.S. oil output, or about 450,000 barrels per day, according to energy consultancy Advanced Resources International."
Exxon,2017-6,"EOR can help firms to produce between 30 percent and 60 percent of all the oil held in a reservoir. That's far more than the 10 percent usually recovered from initial traditional drilling, according to the Department of Energy."
Exxon,2017-6,"The existing credit has provided a financial lift for Occidental, Denbury Resources Inc and oil producers with ready access to the gas. Exxon Mobil Corp and Chevron Corp also use the technique on some of their oil fields. None detail their tax savings from the credit, but since the it was first offered in 2008, companies have collected at least $350 million in the credits, according to Internal Revenue Service figures."
Exxon,2017-6,"In Hobbs, Occidental not only kept a 200-person workforce intact during the oil-price downturn - when tens of thousands of workers were laid off in the shale patch - it also invested $250 million to expand operations during that period, according to its public filings."
Exxon,2017-6,"That meant Hobbs and nearby Seminole, Texas, where Hess Corp has its own carbon dioxide injection facility, didn't suffer the extreme financial pain felt by shale towns, such as Williston, North Dakota, and other shale producing communities in 2015 and 2016.[nL2N17Z0ZS]"
Exxon,2017-6,"""Oxy's investment in the carbon project was a huge economic boost to our area,"" Grassham said."
Exxon,2017-6,"Some of the carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, comes from naturally occurring reservoirs that are a low-cost source for Occidental. Others get the gas piped from power plants that burn coal. Power companies hope the technique can help them avoid higher carbon emissions."
Exxon,2017-6,"The company spends about $18 to $25 per barrel to collect oil from its enhanced oil recovery operations. In contrast, its shale-focused well costs are lower - $16 to $19 per barrel. But because EOR wells pump consistently for decades, their value to the company over time exceeds shale wells, whose production quickly tapers off."
Exxon,2017-6,"Across Texas and New Mexico, Occidental runs one of the world's largest fleet of enhanced oil recovery projects, injecting 2 billion cubic feet of carbon dioxide each day into wells that first produced oil nearly a century ago."
Exxon,2017-6,"""We had a very large, stable carbon dioxide EOR business in our portfolio during the downturn,"" said Jody Elliott, president of Occidental's American operations. ""That helped."""
Exxon,2017-6,"Partly because of its carbon facilities, Occidental was able to raise its dividend during the downturn. Today, executives are using the profits from the carbon business to grow its shale business across the Permian, the largest acreage holding in the region."
Exxon,2017-6,"""These two businesses play very well off of each other,"" Elliott said."
Exxon,2017-6,"Congress is expected this summer to debate extending an existing tax credit that could pave way for wider use. The proposed Carbon Capture Utilization and Storage Act would boost the credit to $35 per metric ton of carbon dioxide, up from $10 per ton today."
Exxon,2017-6,"The legislation failed to move forward during last year's heated presidential campaign, but supporters say it will be reintroduced soon. ""We want to make sure that we show a strong commitment so we continue to develop these technologies,"" said North Dakota Senator Heidi Heitkamp, a Democrat and the bill's lead sponsor."
Exxon,2017-6,"Electricity generator NRG Energy Inc earlier this year opened a $1.04 billion carbon capture facility at a Texas coal-fired power plant, using its carbon dioxide emissions to extract crude from a 1930s-era oilfield.[nL1N1EZ1Q4]"
Exxon,2017-6,"Expanding the credit could, supporters hope, encourage more coal-fired power plants to follow NRG's lead by capturing and selling carbon to oil producers. Most oilfields are not located near carbon dioxide supplies, so the tax credit also could spur the build-out of carbon pipelines."
Exxon,2017-6,"Environmentalists, including the Sierra Club, like the process because it traps carbon underground, preventing it from contributing to greenhouse gas emissions."

Exxon,2017-6,"HOBBS, New Mexico, June 5 (Reuters) - Amid the frenetic activity of American shale oilfields recovering from a two-year recession sit a handful of oil towns that seemed impervious as many producers went into bankruptcy and the economy around them sank."
Exxon,2017-6,"Occidental Petroleum Corp and a few other oil producers with wells near this town on New Mexico's border with Texas steadily pumped low-cost oil through the downturn, using a technique that has been heralded worldwide as a way to reduce carbon emissions and boost oil output."
Exxon,2017-6,"""When everyone else in the oil industry was going down, Oxy kept working,"" said Joshua Grassham, vice president of Lea County State Bank and a Hobbs Chamber of Commerce board member. The city of 35,000 rests on the Permian oilfield, the largest oilfield in the United States."
Exxon,2017-6,"This way of drilling brings with it a sweetener for the oil industry to keep crude flowing: a tax credit that helps insulate these wells in a downturn, and could triple in size if Congress approves a new measure this summer."
Exxon,2017-6,"Such a move could extend by decades the producing life of hundreds more wells, increasing oil supply which would be a drag on prices. To date, the technique has been employed only at conventional oilfields, rather than on shale deposits. Some firms are studying how to put the technique to work in shale drilling, too."
Exxon,2017-6,"The drilling method harnesses the carbon dioxide produced during the extraction of oil or from power plants, and forces it back into the fields. That boosts the pressure underground and drives more oil to the surface."
Exxon,2017-6,"Their success could be replicated in oilfields across the United States if Congress approves the measure, which already enjoys broad bipartisan support. While the Trump administration has yet to say whether it supports the tax credit increase, the measure could also be a boon to the coal industry, which Trump wants to revitalize."
Exxon,2017-6,"The technique, one of several so-called enhanced oil recovery (EOR) strategies used to prolong the productive lifespan of oilfields and increase output, underpins around five percent of U.S. oil output, or about 450,000 barrels per day, according to energy consultancy Advanced Resources International."
Exxon,2017-6,"EOR can help firms to produce between 30 percent and 60 percent of all the oil held in a reservoir. That's far more than the 10 percent usually recovered from initial traditional drilling, according to the Department of Energy."
Exxon,2017-6,"The existing credit has provided a financial lift for Occidental, Denbury Resources Inc and oil producers with ready access to the gas. Exxon Mobil Corp and Chevron Corp also use the technique on some of their oil fields. None detail their tax savings from the credit, but since the it was first offered in 2008, companies have collected at least $350 million in the credits, according to Internal Revenue Service figures."
Exxon,2017-6,"In Hobbs, Occidental not only kept a 200-person workforce intact during the oil-price downturn - when tens of thousands of workers were laid off in the shale patch - it also invested $250 million to expand operations during that period, according to its public filings."
Exxon,2017-6,"That meant Hobbs and nearby Seminole, Texas, where Hess Corp has its own carbon dioxide injection facility, didn't suffer the extreme financial pain felt by shale towns, such as Williston, North Dakota, and other shale producing communities in 2015 and 2016.[nL2N17Z0ZS]"
Exxon,2017-6,"""Oxy's investment in the carbon project was a huge economic boost to our area,"" Grassham said."
Exxon,2017-6,"Some of the carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, comes from naturally occurring reservoirs that are a low-cost source for Occidental. Others get the gas piped from power plants that burn coal. Power companies hope the technique can help them avoid higher carbon emissions."
Exxon,2017-6,"The company spends about $18 to $25 per barrel to collect oil from its enhanced oil recovery operations. In contrast, its shale-focused well costs are lower - $16 to $19 per barrel. But because EOR wells pump consistently for decades, their value to the company over time exceeds shale wells, whose production quickly tapers off."
Exxon,2017-6,"Across Texas and New Mexico, Occidental runs one of the world's largest fleet of enhanced oil recovery projects, injecting 2 billion cubic feet of carbon dioxide each day into wells that first produced oil nearly a century ago."
Exxon,2017-6,"""We had a very large, stable carbon dioxide EOR business in our portfolio during the downturn,"" said Jody Elliott, president of Occidental's American operations. ""That helped."""
Exxon,2017-6,"Partly because of its carbon facilities, Occidental was able to raise its dividend during the downturn. Today, executives are using the profits from the carbon business to grow its shale business across the Permian, the largest acreage holding in the region."
Exxon,2017-6,"""These two businesses play very well off of each other,"" Elliott said."
Exxon,2017-6,"Congress is expected this summer to debate extending an existing tax credit that could pave way for wider use. The proposed Carbon Capture Utilization and Storage Act would boost the credit to $35 per metric ton of carbon dioxide, up from $10 per ton today."
Exxon,2017-6,"The legislation failed to move forward during last year's heated presidential campaign, but supporters say it will be reintroduced soon.

Exxon,2017-6,"ST PETERSBURG, Russia/WASHINGTON, June 2 (Reuters) - For three years after Russia annexed Crimea, Washington officials quietly cautioned major U.S. firms about attending the annual St Petersburg forum, where investors mingle with President Vladimir Putin and his lieutenants."
Exxon,2017-6,"This year, the first forum since Donald Trump became U.S. president, such cautions were not issued, according to four people familiar with preparations for U.S. companies to attend."
Exxon,2017-6,"Washington's policy toward Russia is essentially unchanged under Trump, with the United States committed to maintaining sanctions on Moscow unless it complies with international demands about Ukraine."
Exxon,2017-6,"But its approach this year to the St Petersburg event - often described as Russia's version of the Davos forum in Switzerland - reveals a change in tone, according to some people who follow U.S.-Russia trade relations."
Exxon,2017-6,"Daniel Russell, the head of the U.S.-Russia business council, when asked if U.S. companies were feeling less pressure from the administration to stay away, said: ""I think that's right."
Exxon,2017-6,"""Some of the companies, particularly in 2015, received calls from the U.S. government not to attend and I think that attitude has certainly changed."""
Exxon,2017-6,The change in tone fits with promises Trump made during his election campaign to pursue friendlier ties with Russia.
Exxon,2017-6,"Any sign of warming toward the Kremlin is highly sensitive for the White House, since Congress and the FBI are conducting inquiries into whether members of the Trump team had improper contacts with Russian officials before Trump's inauguration. Trump has denied doing anything wrong."
Exxon,2017-6,"Asked about contacts with companies planning to attend the forum, a State Department spokesperson said: ""We have an open dialogue with the business community, and ultimately companies are free to make their own decisions, in line with applicable laws and regulations."""
Exxon,2017-6,The forum in St Petersburg was in its second day on Friday and there were signs of a more substantial U.S. presence than in previous years since the March 2014 annexation of Crimea.
Exxon,2017-6,"U.S. ambassador to Russia John Tefft was at the forum, though he did not have a speaking slot. No U.S. ambassador attended in 2014, 2015 or 2016."
Exxon,2017-6,A spokeswoman for the U.S. embassy in Moscow said his attendance was a routine part of his ambassadorial duties.
Exxon,2017-6,"Major U.S. companies who sent senior executives - including oil major Exxon, Boeing, Chevron and JPMorgan - were represented at a similar level to last year, but several delegates at the forum said they estimated the U.S. presence to be numerically bigger than in previous years."
Exxon,2017-6,"""We see a much larger number of people from the U.S., Canada,"" said Kirill Dmitriev, chief executive of the Russian Direct Investment Fund, a state body that works with foreign investors."
Exxon,2017-6,"""There is a better understanding (among foreign investors) that sanctions really did not work, the Russian economy continues to grow, Russia represents an attractive market and people should work with Russia,"" he told Reuters."
Exxon,2017-6,"Several U.S. delegates said that, politics aside, they were drawn to the forum by the fact the Russian economy had returned to growth after a slowdown."
Exxon,2017-6,"The forum is a prestige project for Putin, a native of St Petersburg. Foreign executives typically use their presence to signal to the Kremlin their enthusiasm for investing in Russia."
Exxon,2017-6,"In 2014, when the Ukraine crisis first started, U.S. cabinet officials including Secretary of State John Kerry made personal calls to chief executives of U.S. firms asking them not to attend, said a former U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity."
Exxon,2017-6,"The next year, senior U.S. officials below cabinet level were charged with persuading American executives not to attend, and in 2016, U.S. officials brought up the issue in a low-level manner, the former official said."
Exxon,2017-6,The account of those conversations was confirmed by a second former official who served in the administration of former U.S. President Barack Obama.
Exxon,2017-6,"The guidance in later years was not necessarily to stay away, but that executives who did attend should keep their presence low-key, said several other people familiar with the discussions."
Exxon,2017-6,"Ian Colebourne, who is CEO for Deloitte in the Commonwealth of Independent States and sits on the U.S.-Russia business council, said he was aware of officials giving guidance to executives in previous years, but added: ""I haven't heard anything this year."""

Exxon,2017-6,"The U.S. Chamber of Commerce did not receive any guidance from the administration about whether or not to participate in the event, a source with the Chamber said."

Exxon,2017-6,Woods declined to answer questions from Reuters. An Exxon representative said company policy was not to comment on the travel arrangements of its executives.
Exxon,2017-6,"Among other U.S. companies at the forum, JPMorgan Chase & Co., sent Daniel Pinto, Chief Executive Officer of its corporate and investment business, while Boeing sent Bertrand-Marc Allen, president of its international arm."

Exxon,2017-6,"NEW YORK, June 2 (Reuters) - New York's top prosecutor on Friday accused Exxon Mobil of misleading investors about how it accounts for climate change risks, court filings show, offering a rare look inside an ongoing fraud investigation as it pressed the company to turn over more documents."
Exxon,2017-6,"Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said in a court filing he had evidence of ""potential materially false and misleading statements by Exxon"" that could have led investors to think the U.S. oil giant company properly assessed the risks when it actually ignored a formula to estimate the impact of future environmental regulation on new deals."
Exxon,2017-6,"Schneiderman's filing came a day after President Donald Trump announced plans to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate accord, in which nearly 200 countries pledged to lower their greenhouse gas emissions to try to slow global warming. World leaders and many U.S. executives condemned the decision. [nL1N1IY0MV]"
Exxon,2017-6,"""ExxonMobil's external statements have accurately described its use of a proxy cost of carbon, and the documents produced to the Attorney General make this fact unmistakably clear,"" said Exxon spokesman Scott Silvestri. ""We will respond fully to the Attorney General's inaccurate and irresponsible allegations about proxy cost in our court filings."""
Exxon,2017-6,"Schneiderman's filing focused on the method Exxon used to give its investors estimates of the regulatory cost of greenhouse gas emissions on new projects. The company frequently showed investors a number it called a ""proxy cost"" for greenhouse gasses as a way to assure them it was accounting for potential changes to government policy that would make producing and burning fossil fuels more expensive."
Exxon,2017-6,"""The exercise described to investors may be a sham,"" Schneiderman wrote, because Exxon may not have actually applied it when estimating profits and losses on its investments."
Exxon,2017-6,"""Exxon's own documents suggest that if Exxon had applied the proxy cost it promised to shareholders, at least one substantial oil sands project may have projected a financial loss, rather than a profit, over the course of the project's original timeline,"" Schneiderman wrote."
Exxon,2017-6,The New York prosecutor is not the only authority examining Exxon's climate-related statements to investors. Exxon said on Sept. 20 the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating how it valued its oil and gas reserves in the wake of low prices and potential curbs on carbon emissions. [nL3N1BW412]
Exxon,2017-6,"Exxon has been fighting Schneiderman's requests for information about its climate change policies in both state and federal court, claiming it should not have to turn over records because the New York prosecutor's probe is politically motivated and abusive to the company."
Exxon,2017-6,Its resistance has created a highly unusual condition: State and federal prosecutors normally only reveal their findings once they've completed the process and are ready to file charges.
Exxon,2017-6,"But Exxon's attempts to fight Schneiderman's subpoenas - it even sued Schneiderman and Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey, who is also probing the company, in federal court - have led Schneiderman to use evidence he's uncovered so far to argue his case for why Exxon should be forced to hand over more documents."
Exxon,2017-6,"Exxon has already turned over 2 million documents as part of the investigation, leading to the discovery that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who until December was chief executive of Exxon, used a separate email address and an alias, ""Wayne Tracker,"" to discuss climate change-related issues while at the company. [nL2N1GQ1T7]"
Exxon,2017-6,"Schneiderman is seeking records he says Exxon has been withholding, as well the ability to interview Exxon employees who might know about Exxon's internal climate change discussions."
Exxon,2017-6,"On May 23, a New York State appeals court ruled Exxon should turn over records Schneiderman was requesting. [nL1N1IP1TQ]"
Exxon,2017-6,Exxon shares were down 1.5 percent Friday at $79.49. Crude prices fell on worries Trump's decision to withdraw from the global climate accord could ultimately result in an overabundance of oil production. [nL3N1IZ1BK]

The shareholder proposal, filed by 54 groups including financial, religious and corporate governance activists, won the support on Wednesday of 62 percent of Exxon holders. [nL1N1IX15V]"
Exxon,2017-6,"""I anticipate we'll be having a meeting this summer,"" said Tracey Rembert, assistant director of Catholic Responsible Investing at Christian Brothers Investment Services, one of the 54 co-filers."
Exxon,2017-6,"The White House's decision on Thursday to withdraw from the Paris agreement on climate change has no bearing on the proposal. ""We expect the scenario assessment will start to be done quickly at Exxon,"" Rembert said. [nL1N1IY0MV]"
Exxon,2017-6,"The investors behind the proposal routinely met in past years with Exxon between December and February to discuss annual meeting proposals, she said. Earlier discussions because of the majority vote are in order."
Exxon,2017-6,"Rembert said the group will ask for Exxon to conduct scenario planning exercises that would look at risks from disruptive technology, climate or government policies. ""What are the black swan events that can take place beyond low oil prices, aggressive policies or shifting consumer preferences?"" she said."
Exxon,2017-6,The reconsideration at Exxon comes as Devon Energy and Hess Corp owners on Wednesday will weigh climate-impact resolutions.
Exxon,2017-6,"Ballot initiatives press for greater studies of the risk that government carbon-reduction efforts in the future make oil and gas reserves uneconomic to tap, leading to investment losses. Study proposals this year received at least 40 percent approval at Duke Energy , Marathon Oil and Southern Co , according to a tally by Ceres, a non-profit group that tracks environmental records of public companies."
Exxon,2017-6,"""When investors make a very strong statement at a company the size of Exxon Mobil, other competitors in their industry take notice and may reconsider or rethink their investor dialogue on these issues,"" said Bruce Goldfarb, chief executive of proxy solicitor Okapi Partners. [nL1N1IX2E2]"
Exxon,2017-6,"The Exxon shareholder vote will have minor influence because most of the ballots likely were already cast, said Danielle Fugere, president of As You Sow, a shareholder advocacy group seeking a carbon-risk study at Hess. Last year, its proposal was backed by about 23 percent of Hess holders."
Exxon,2017-6,"Hess's vice president of investor relations, Jay Wilson, said the company talks regularly with large shareholders but declined to comment on any discussions since the Exxon vote. Devon didn't respond to requests for comment. Directors at both oil companies oppose the studies. [nL1N1IE20Q]"

Exxon,2017-6,"""It was a policy decision and I think it's important that everyone recognize the United States has a terrific record on reducing our own greenhouse gas emissions,"" Tillerson told reporters at the State Department."

Exxon,2017-6,"NEW YORK, June 2 (Reuters) - New York's top prosecutor on Friday increased pressure on Exxon Mobil to turn over records of internal assessments of the risks global warming poses to its businesses, claiming to already have evidence of ""potential materially false and misleading statements by Exxon,"" court filings show."
Exxon,2017-6,Attorney General Eric Schneiderman has been investigating whether the U.S. oil giant misled investors by publicly stating that it thought the risks of climate change were low while privately admitting they were far higher.
Exxon,2017-6,"In a filing on Friday, Schneiderman focused on the method Exxon used to give its investors estimates of the regulatory cost of greenhouse gas emissions on new projects. The company frequently showed investors a number it called a ""proxy cost"" for greenhouse gasses as a way to assure them it was accounting for potential changes to government policy that would make producing and burning fossil fuels more expensive."
Exxon,2017-6,"""The exercise described to investors may be a sham,"" Schneiderman wrote in the court filing."
Exxon,2017-6,A spokesman for Exxon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Exxon,2017-6,"Exxon has been fighting Schneiderman's requests for information about its climate change policies in both state and federal court, claiming it should not have to turn over records because the New York prosecutor's probe is politically motivated and abusive to the company."
Exxon,2017-6,"Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey is also investigating the company. Both probes are modeled after earlier investigations of tobacco companies, which were shown to admit in great detail internally that smoking was bad for human health while publicly maintaining it was not."
Exxon,2017-6,Friday's filing revealed that Exxon may have actually low-balled the cost of carbon-emissions regulations in its internal calculations compared with what it told investors.
Exxon,2017-6,"""Exxon's own documents suggest that if Exxon had applied the proxy cost it promised to shareholders, at least one substantial oil sands project may have projected a financial loss, rather than a profit, over the course of the project's original timeline,"" Schneiderman wrote."
Exxon,2017-6,"On May 23, a New York State appeals court ruled Exxon should turn over records Schneiderman was requesting, which it had been arguing it should not be compelled to release. [nL1N1IP286]"
Exxon,2017-6,"Friday's filing included a request for even more internal documents, as well the ability to interview Exxon employees who might know about Exxon's internal climate change discussions."

Exxon,2017-6,"LAUNCESTON, Australia, June 2 (Reuters) - It's not hard to imagine Chinese President Xi Jinping having a wry smile at both the decision by Donald Trump to pull the United States out of the Paris climate accord and the global reaction."
Exxon,2017-6,"While President Trump's decision had been expected, it does confirm that world leadership on efforts to limit global climate change will now shift to Asia, and China in particular. [nL1N1IY0MV]"
Exxon,2017-6,"Xi is now free to accept the mantle of global leadership on climate action, which will give him an opportunity to advance China's interests across the world at a time when Trump's actions are likely to cost the United States influence and allies."
Exxon,2017-6,"The best part for Xi is that this hasn't cost him anything, Trump has done the damage to the United States all by himself, and is most likely unaware or uncaring of the likely consequences, which go well beyond the blow to the image of the United States as a global leader."
Exxon,2017-6,"It's been a good past few weeks for Xi, given the successful hosting of a regional summit in Beijing to promote the ""belt and road"" initiative that ended on May 15 with pledges by China to spend as much as $800 billion on projects aimed at boosting trade and development across Asia, Africa and into Europe."
Exxon,2017-6,"China, the world's largest polluter, was also quick to state that it remained committed to the 2015 Paris agreement, which aims to limit the rise in global temperatures to less than 2 degrees centigrade by the end of the century."
Exxon,2017-6,"""China will stand by its responsibilities on climate change,"" Premier Li Keqiang told reporters on Thursday after meeting German Chancellor Angela Merkel and before flying on to Brussels for meetings with European Union officials that will include how to keep the Paris agreement going without U.S. participation. [nL8N1IY1J8]"
Exxon,2017-6,"While China has moved quickly to step into the leadership role vacated by Trump, it's likely that Xi will be looking for more than just increased prestige and prominence in international affairs."
Exxon,2017-6,"China will most likely be seeking to attract more investment into renewable energy technology and manufacturing, building up a sector of its economy that is already experiencing rapid growth."
Exxon,2017-6,"The opportunities for China are immense, as it can step into the U.S. role of providing technology and equipment transfer to developing nations to help them meet their commitments under the Paris agreement."
Exxon,2017-6,"China has committed to plough 2.5 trillion yuan ($361 billion) into renewable power generation by 2020, as the world's largest energy market continues to shift away from dirty coal power towards cleaner fuels."
Exxon,2017-6,"The investment will create over 13 million jobs in the sector, the National Energy Administration said on Jan. 5 in a document that lays out its plan to develop the nation's energy sector during the five-year 2016 to 2020 period."
Exxon,2017-6,"No doubt China will also seek to export renewable energy sources such as solar panels and wind turbines, and this process may well be helped by the country's strong stance in favour of the global climate accord."
Exxon,2017-6,It's also likely that China will join European countries in rejecting Trump's efforts to negotiate a better deal.
Exxon,2017-6,"The countries that remain committed to the 195-nation Paris agreement have little incentive to give a better deal to the United States, the world's second-biggest polluter."
Exxon,2017-6,Rather it's more likely that they may seek to impose carbon-related tariffs on U.S. goods if these are deemed to be enjoying an unfair advantage because they are produced in an economy free of carbon restraints.
Exxon,2017-6,It's difficult to see how Trump's decision to exit the Paris deal is anything other than an own goal.
Exxon,2017-6,"It's highly improbable that this will lead to more manufacturing jobs in the United States, instead it may actually encourage renewable energy pioneers to look at establishing facilities in countries with more progressive views."
Exxon,2017-6,"It's also unlikely to revive the U.S. coal industry, which will remain under pressure from cheaper natural gas and the increasing cost-competitiveness of renewables."
Exxon,2017-6,"It's a massive blow to U.S. prestige, and one that will likely filter down to U.S. companies that do business globally, making it harder for them to win business."
Exxon,2017-6,It also shows that Trump has little regard for his country's international reputation and that he remains under the spell of climate change deniers and nationalists with limited grasp of science or the economic implications.
Exxon,2017-6,"Trump's actions also fly in the face of the wishes of many U.S. companies, including those that are supposed to be beneficiaries of the withdrawal, such as Exxon Mobil ."
Exxon,2017-6,"The maelstrom of criticism Trump is getting for abandoning the global climate pact is unlikely to dissuade him, or convince the section of his support base that fervently believe it is the correct course of action."

Exxon,2017-6,"Developing the Coral South field, discovered in May 2012 and operated by Eni, requires building six subsea wells connected to a floating facility capable of producing about 3.4 million tonnes of liquefied natural gas (LNG) per year, Eni said."
Exxon,2017-6,"The project would cost $8 billion and LNG exports were expected to start in 2022, Eni said."
Exxon,2017-6,"""The Coral South Project will deliver a reliable source of energy while contributing to Mozambique's economic development,"" Eni chief executive Claudio Descalzi said in a statement."
Exxon,2017-6,"The Coral South field contains about 450 billion cubic metres, or 16 trillion cubic feet (tcf) of gas. The field lies in the Rovuma Basin, with estimated reserves of about 85 tcf, enough to supply Germany, Britain, France and Italy for nearly two decades."
Exxon,2017-6,Mozambican authorities approved the project's development plan in February 2016 and in October Eni signed a 20-year deal to supply BP with LNG from the project. [nL5N1CA31B]
Exxon,2017-6,"Mozambique, which lies on Africa's eastern seaboard, is well placed to supply growing Asian economies with gas, analysts say."
Exxon,2017-6,The floating LNG platform will be built in South Korea by a consortium led by Samsung Heavy <010140.KS>. The group includes France's Technip and Japan's JGC <1963.T>. [nL8N1A71YQ]
Exxon,2017-6,"Partners in the field development include China National Petroleum Co (CNPC) [CNPET.UL], Korea Gas Corp (Kogas) <036460.KS> and Mozambique's state-run Empresa Nacional de Hidrocarbonetos (ENH)."
Exxon,2017-6,"U.S. energy major Exxon Mobil Corp agreed this year to pay Eni $2.8 billion for a 25 percent stake in its huge Area 4 concession off the coast of Mozambique, which includes the Coral South field. [nL3N1GM3SO]"
Exxon,2017-6,U.S. firm Anadarko is planning a separate onshore LNG project in northern Mozambique.
Exxon,2017-6,"Eni said project finance would fund 60 percent of the cost of building the floating LNG facility, while the financing agreement has been subscribed by 15 major international banks and guaranteed by five export credit agencies."
Exxon,2017-6,Eni's long-delayed final investment decision will be a relief for the Mozambican government following a high-profile debt scandal that emerged last year.
Exxon,2017-6,"The International Monetary Fund and Western donors cut budget support when $2 billion in hidden loans were exposed, plunging the country into economic crisis."
Exxon,2017-6,LNG exports are seen as the only likely long-term solution to the country's deep financial problems.
Exxon,2017-6,"""This is really good news for the government of Mozambique,"" said Alasdair Reid, Africa expert at energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie. ""It demonstrates that, despite ongoing credit issues, there is still enough belief in the investment climate for partners to raise finance and move projects forward."""

Exxon,2017-6,{{20170601T014821.348+0000}}UPDATE 9-Trump to announce decision on global climate deal on Thursday* Trump says he is listening to people on both sides
Exxon,2017-6,"WASHINGTON, May 31 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump said he would announce on Thursday his decision whether to keep the United States in a global pact to fight climate change, as a source close to the matter said he was preparing to pull out of the Paris accord."
Exxon,2017-6,"Trump said he would make the announcement at 3 p.m. EDT (1900 GMT) in the White House Rose Garden, ending his tweet with ""MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!"""
Exxon,2017-6,"During his 2016 presidential campaign, Trump blasted the accord, and called global warming a hoax aimed at weakening U.S. industry."
Exxon,2017-6,"The Republican vowed at the time to ""cancel"" the Paris deal within 100 days of becoming president on Jan. 20, part of an effort to bolster U.S. oil and coal industries."
Exxon,2017-6,A U.S. withdrawal could deepen a rift with U.S. allies. The United States would join Syria and Nicaragua as the world's only non-participants in the landmark 195-nation accord agreed upon in Paris in 2015.
Exxon,2017-6,"Trump came under pressure on Wednesday from corporate CEOs, U.S. allies, Democrats and some fellow Republicans to keep the United States in the accord."
Exxon,2017-6,"Responding to shouted questions earlier on Wednesday from reporters in the White House Oval Office where he met with Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc, Trump said: ""I'm hearing from a lot of people, both ways."""
Exxon,2017-6,"The source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Trump was working out terms of the planned withdrawal with U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt, an oil industry ally and climate change doubter."
Exxon,2017-6,"The pact was the first legally binding global deal to fight climate change. Virtually every nation voluntarily committed to steps aimed at curbing global emissions of ""greenhouse"" gases. These include carbon dioxide generated from burning of fossil fuels that scientists blame for a warming planet, sea level rise, droughts and more frequent violent storms."
Exxon,2017-6,The United States committed to reduce its emissions by 26 percent to 28 percent from 2005 levels by 2025.
Exxon,2017-6,"Advocates of the climate deal pressured Trump, who has changed his mind on large decisions before even after signaling a move in the opposite direction."
Exxon,2017-6,"The chief executives of dozens of companies have made last-minute appeals to Trump. The CEOs of ExxonMobil Corp , Apple Inc , Dow Chemical Co , Unilever NV and Tesla Inc were among those urging him to remain in the agreement. Tesla's Elon Musk threatened to quit White House advisory councils if the president pulls out."
Exxon,2017-6,"Musk said: ""I've done all I can to advise directly"" to Trump and through others in the White House."
Exxon,2017-6,"Robert Murray, CEO of Murray Energy Corp [MUYEY.UL], an Ohio-based coal company and major Trump campaign donor, urged Trump to withdraw from the deal. But on Wednesday, U.S. coal company shares fell alongside renewable energy stocks following reports that Trump would pull out. [nL1N1IX0YV]"
Exxon,2017-6,"Pulling the United States from the accord could further alienate American allies in Europe already wary of Trump and call into question U.S. leadership and trustworthiness on one of the world's leading issues. It also would be one more step by the Republican president to erase the legacy of his predecessor, Democrat Barack Obama, who helped broker the accord and praised it during a trip to Europe this month."
Exxon,2017-6,"A U.S. pullout could have sweeping implications. The deal relies heavily on reductions in emissions by big polluter nations, and the United States is the world's second-biggest carbon dioxide emitter behind China."
Exxon,2017-6,"At a conference near Los Angeles, Democrat Hillary Clinton, who Trump defeated in the 2016 presidential election, said withdrawing would be a mistake. ""Part of what keeps us going is that America's word is good, and that you stand with your prior administration whether it was of your party or not,"" she said."
Exxon,2017-6,"Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee who Trump considered for secretary of state, said on Twitter that affirmation of the Paris agreement ""is not only about the climate: It is also about America remaining the global leader."""
Exxon,2017-6,"Democratic U.S. Senators Bob Menendez and Jack Reed wrote a letter urging Trump not to withdraw. They said withdrawal would undermine U.S. credibility and its position as a global leader, empowering nations like China to drive the climate agenda and set international standards while also reaping economic benefits from a growing clean energy sector."
Exxon,2017-6,"In Berlin, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker stressed withdrawal would take years, saying: ""The Americans can't just leave the climate protection agreement. Mr. Trump believes that because he doesn't know the details."" [nL8N1IX5X6]"
Exxon,2017-6,"China and the European Union will seek on Friday to buttress the agreement. In a statement backed by all 28 EU states, the European Union and China will commit to full implementation of the accord, EU and Chinese officials said. [nL8N1IX5CW]"
Exxon,2017-6,"Trump has said the accord would cost the U.S. economy trillions of dollars without tangible benefit. For the president, a withdrawal would reflect his ""America First"" approach to policy, unencumbered by international obligations."
Exxon,2017-6,"Trump refused to endorse the accord at a summit of the G7 group of wealthy nations on Saturday in Italy, saying he needed more time to decide. [nL8N1IT044]"

Exxon,2017-6,"DALLAS, May 31 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp's chief executive said on Wednesday the company would reconsider how it communicates the risks its faces from climate change after shareholders approved a measure calling for increased transparency."
Exxon,2017-6,"The non-binding proposal passed with 62 percent of ballots cast in a rare defeat for Exxon's management, which had recommended a vote against the measure. The company argued that it already provides sufficient information on the potential impact of changing technologies and energy demand on its asset portfolio."
Exxon,2017-6,"The results likely reflected a shift in how big shareholders voted on the measure, as the same proposal last year received only 38.1 percent of shares voted."
Exxon,2017-6,"Asset manager BlackRock Inc backed the proposal, according to a source familiar with the matter. BlackRock holds about 6 percent of Exxon shares."
Exxon,2017-6,"In remarks following the shareholder meeting, Exxon Chief Executive Darren Woods said the board would reconsider its climate change-related communications but did not commit to producing the report requested in the proposal."
Exxon,2017-6,"He also said board directors would review a policy designed to bar them from meeting individually with big shareholders, a practice criticized by the climate proposal sponsors."
Exxon,2017-6,"""We take the vote seriously will respond to that feedback and look for opportunities"" to communicate, Woods said. ""That issue along with others is part of dialogue we have with the board."""
Exxon,2017-6,Exxon still faces probes by Massachusetts and New York Attorneys General into whether it misled the public and investors by soft-pedaling climate change risks. Exxon has said suits are politically motivated and intended to force it and others to change their positions on climate change.
Exxon,2017-6,"Protesters, some in skeleton costumes, held up signs saying ""Exxon Lied"" across the street from Wednesday's annual meeting."
Exxon,2017-6,"Approval of Exxon's executive pay meanwhile received 68 percent of ballots cast, down from 89 percent a year ago. Proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services had recommended shareholders reject the executive pay plan. [nL4N1IL1K7]"
Exxon,2017-6,"A proposal calling for a report on Exxon's efforts to reduce emissions of methane, another greenhouse gas, in its operations received support of nearly 39 percent of ballots cast."
Exxon,2017-6,Another proposal calling on the company to increase shareholder payouts in light of climate change-related risks was approved by less than 4 percent of ballots cast. Exxon had opposed both proposals.

Exxon,2017-6,{{20170601T014821.348+0000}}UPDATE 9-Trump to announce decision on global climate deal on Thursday* Trump says he is listening to people on both sides
Exxon,2017-6,"WASHINGTON, May 31 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump said he would announce on Thursday his decision whether to keep the United States in a global pact to fight climate change, as a source close to the matter said he was preparing to pull out of the Paris accord."
Exxon,2017-6,"Trump said he would make the announcement at 3 p.m. EDT (1900 GMT) in the White House Rose Garden, ending his tweet with ""MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!"""
Exxon,2017-6,"During his 2016 presidential campaign, Trump blasted the accord, and called global warming a hoax aimed at weakening U.S. industry."
Exxon,2017-6,"The Republican vowed at the time to ""cancel"" the Paris deal within 100 days of becoming president on Jan. 20, part of an effort to bolster U.S. oil and coal industries."
Exxon,2017-6,A U.S. withdrawal could deepen a rift with U.S. allies. The United States would join Syria and Nicaragua as the world's only non-participants in the landmark 195-nation accord agreed upon in Paris in 2015.
Exxon,2017-6,"Trump came under pressure on Wednesday from corporate CEOs, U.S. allies, Democrats and some fellow Republicans to keep the United States in the accord."
Exxon,2017-6,"Responding to shouted questions earlier on Wednesday from reporters in the White House Oval Office where he met with Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc, Trump said: ""I'm hearing from a lot of people, both ways."""
Exxon,2017-6,"The source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Trump was working out terms of the planned withdrawal with U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt, an oil industry ally and climate change doubter."
Exxon,2017-6,"The pact was the first legally binding global deal to fight climate change. Virtually every nation voluntarily committed to steps aimed at curbing global emissions of ""greenhouse"" gases. These include carbon dioxide generated from burning of fossil fuels that scientists blame for a warming planet, sea level rise, droughts and more frequent violent storms."
Exxon,2017-6,The United States committed to reduce its emissions by 26 percent to 28 percent from 2005 levels by 2025.
Exxon,2017-6,"Advocates of the climate deal pressured Trump, who has changed his mind on large decisions before even after signaling a move in the opposite direction."
Exxon,2017-6,"The chief executives of dozens of companies have made last-minute appeals to Trump. The CEOs of ExxonMobil Corp , Apple Inc , Dow Chemical Co , Unilever NV and Tesla Inc were among those urging him to remain in the agreement. Tesla's Elon Musk threatened to quit White House advisory councils if the president pulls out."
Exxon,2017-6,"Musk said: ""I've done all I can to advise directly"" to Trump and through others in the White House."
Exxon,2017-6,"Robert Murray, CEO of Murray Energy Corp [MUYEY.UL], an Ohio-based coal company and major Trump campaign donor, urged Trump to withdraw from the deal. But on Wednesday, U.S. coal company shares fell alongside renewable energy stocks following reports that Trump would pull out. [nL1N1IX0YV]"
Exxon,2017-6,"Pulling the United States from the accord could further alienate American allies in Europe already wary of Trump and call into question U.S. leadership and trustworthiness on one of the world's leading issues. It also would be one more step by the Republican president to erase the legacy of his predecessor, Democrat Barack Obama, who helped broker the accord and praised it during a trip to Europe this month."
Exxon,2017-6,"A U.S. pullout could have sweeping implications. The deal relies heavily on reductions in emissions by big polluter nations, and the United States is the world's second-biggest carbon dioxide emitter behind China."
Exxon,2017-6,"At a conference near Los Angeles, Democrat Hillary Clinton, who Trump defeated in the 2016 presidential election, said withdrawing would be a mistake. ""Part of what keeps us going is that America's word is good, and that you stand with your prior administration whether it was of your party or not,"" she said."
Exxon,2017-6,"Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee who Trump considered for secretary of state, said on Twitter that affirmation of the Paris agreement ""is not only about the climate: It is also about America remaining the global leader."""
Exxon,2017-6,"Democratic U.S. Senators Bob Menendez and Jack Reed wrote a letter urging Trump not to withdraw. They said withdrawal would undermine U.S. credibility and its position as a global leader, empowering nations like China to drive the climate agenda and set international standards while also reaping economic benefits from a growing clean energy sector."
Exxon,2017-6,"In Berlin, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker stressed withdrawal would take years, saying: ""The Americans can't just leave the climate protection agreement. Mr. Trump believes that because he doesn't know the details."" [nL8N1IX5X6]"
Exxon,2017-6,"China and the European Union will seek on Friday to buttress the agreement. In a statement backed by all 28 EU states, the European Union and China will commit to full implementation of the accord, EU and Chinese officials said. [nL8N1IX5CW]"
Exxon,2017-6,"Trump has said the accord would cost the U.S. economy trillions of dollars without tangible benefit. For the president, a withdrawal would reflect his ""America First"" approach to policy, unencumbered by international obligations."
Exxon,2017-6,"Trump refused to endorse the accord at a summit of the G7 group of wealthy nations on Saturday in Italy, saying he needed more time to decide. [nL8N1IT044]"
Exxon,2017-6,"{{20170531T234939.512+0000}}Exxon Baton Rouge refinery completes coker overhaul -sourcesHOUSTON, May 31 (Reuters) - ExxonMobil Corp completed the overhaul of a coking unit late last week at its 502,500-barrel-per-day (bpd) Baton Rouge, Louisiana, refinery, sources familiar with plant operations said on Wednesday."
Exxon,2017-6,"The 32,000-bpd West Coker was shut in mid-April for the planned overhaul. A coker increases the amount of refinable material taken from a barrel of crude and converts residual crude oil into petroleum coke, a coal substitute."
Exxon,2017-6,{{20170531T231158.536+0000}}UPDATE 3-Exxon shareholders approve climate impact report in win for activists(Adds Breakingviews link)
Exxon,2017-6,"DALLAS, May 31 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp's chief executive said on Wednesday the company would reconsider how it communicates the risks its faces from climate change after shareholders approved a measure calling for increased transparency."
Exxon,2017-6,"The non-binding proposal passed with 62 percent of ballots cast in a rare defeat for Exxon's management, which had recommended a vote against the measure. The company argued that it already provides sufficient information on the potential impact of changing technologies and energy demand on its asset portfolio."
Exxon,2017-6,"The results likely reflected a shift in how big shareholders voted on the measure, as the same proposal last year received only 38.1 percent of shares voted."
Exxon,2017-6,"Asset manager BlackRock Inc backed the proposal, according to a source familiar with the matter. BlackRock holds about 6 percent of Exxon shares."
Exxon,2017-6,"In remarks following the shareholder meeting, Exxon Chief Executive Darren Woods said the board would reconsider its climate change-related communications but did not commit to producing the report requested in the proposal."
Exxon,2017-6,"He also said board directors would review a policy designed to bar them from meeting individually with big shareholders, a practice criticized by the climate proposal sponsors."
Exxon,2017-6,"""We take the vote seriously will respond to that feedback and look for opportunities"" to communicate, Woods said. ""That issue along with others is part of dialogue we have with the board."""
Exxon,2017-6,Exxon still faces probes by Massachusetts and New York Attorneys General into whether it misled the public and investors by soft-pedaling climate change risks. Exxon has said suits are politically motivated and intended to force it and others to change their positions on climate change.
Exxon,2017-6,"Protesters, some in skeleton costumes, held up signs saying ""Exxon Lied"" across the street from Wednesday's annual meeting."
Exxon,2017-6,"Approval of Exxon's executive pay meanwhile received 68 percent of ballots cast, down from 89 percent a year ago. Proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services had recommended shareholders reject the executive pay plan. [nL4N1IL1K7]"
Exxon,2017-6,"A proposal calling for a report on Exxon's efforts to reduce emissions of methane, another greenhouse gas, in its operations received support of nearly 39 percent of ballots cast."
Exxon,2017-6,Another proposal calling on the company to increase shareholder payouts in light of climate change-related risks was approved by less than 4 percent of ballots cast. Exxon had opposed both proposals.
Exxon,2017-6,"Earlier, Exxon's Woods had said the company supported the goals of many of the proposals, but disagreed with the methods."
