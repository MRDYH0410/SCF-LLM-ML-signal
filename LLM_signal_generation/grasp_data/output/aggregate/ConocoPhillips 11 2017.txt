ConocoPhillips,2017-11,"HOUSTON, Dec 4 (Reuters) - ConocoPhillips will receive $337 million from Ecuador under a settlement of an arbitration case that the U.S. energy company brought over a 2009 confiscation of assets in the South American country."
ConocoPhillips,2017-11,"A World Bank panel in February had ordered Ecuador to pay $380 million in damages to the oil and gas producer's subsidiary, Burlington Resources. The subsidiary had stakes in two blocks producing about 22,000 barrels of oil per day that were taken over by the government more than eight years ago. [nL4N1FU00G]"
ConocoPhillips,2017-11,"The settlement includes an offset for a decision awarding Ecuador $42 million on its environmental and infrastructure counterclaims. Burlington is entitled to $24 million through a third-party contribution to the payment, ConocoPhillips said on Monday"
ConocoPhillips,2017-11,ConocoPhillips also said it was pleased to reach a conclusion of the matter. It received $75 million on Dec. 1 from Ecuador and expects to collect another $262 million by April 2018. [nBw24kcCfa]

ConocoPhillips,2017-11,"{{20171121T203429.957+0000}}UPDATE 2-Libya's Waha Oil Co pumping 260,000 bpd, plans hampered by funding shortfall(Adds details)"
ConocoPhillips,2017-11,"TUNIS, Nov 21 (Reuters) - Libya's Waha Oil Co is producing about 260,000 barrels per day (bpd), up more than 100,000 bpd from the company's output levels this summer, but further gains are complicated by a lack of investment, its chairman said on Tuesday."
ConocoPhillips,2017-11,"Ahmed Ammar said Waha was aiming to increase output to 375,000 bpd by the end of next year but was facing major funding shortfalls and challenges in maintaining damaged infrastructure."
ConocoPhillips,2017-11,"Waha is a subsidiary of Libya's National Oil Corporation (NOC) and operates as a joint venture with Hess Corp , Marathon Oil Corp and ConocoPhillips ."
ConocoPhillips,2017-11,"Its oil is exported through Es Sider terminal, which reopened late last year after an armed group that was blockading the port was forced out."
ConocoPhillips,2017-11,"Waha's gains have helped raise Libya's national oil output to around one million bpd, about four times higher than the OPEC member's production in mid-2016."
ConocoPhillips,2017-11,"It remains well below the 1.6 million bpd Libya was producing before a 2011 uprising, and vulnerable to continuing political and economic turmoil."
ConocoPhillips,2017-11,"Plans to increase Waha's production to as high as 600,000 bpd over the next five years, partly through major new projects at the NC-98 and Jalo North fields, have been postponed because of a lack of funding, Ammar told Reuters on the sidelines of a business conference in Tunis."
ConocoPhillips,2017-11,But he said some gains could be made by developing drilling in fields that are already in production and replacing pumps that were damaged after long output stoppages.
ConocoPhillips,2017-11,"""Some of the production will come from existing wells. We need to work them over,"" Ammar said."
ConocoPhillips,2017-11,"Some of Waha's fields and facilities have been badly damaged in militant attacks, fighting and looting."
ConocoPhillips,2017-11,"At Es Sider, 12 out of 19 storage tanks remain out of use. Ammar said this was not hampering exports, but would become a constraint if the company raised its production towards 400,000 bpd."
ConocoPhillips,2017-11,"Waha hopes to rebuild two of the storage tanks next year, adding storage capacity of one million barrels, but Ammar said approval for the project from Libya's Audit Bureau was still pending."
ConocoPhillips,2017-11,"Waha has also suffered repeated leaks in its pipeline network, which was damaged by highly corrosive water. In one pipeline there were 57 leaks in a single month, Ammar said."
ConocoPhillips,2017-11,"The company has been patching up or clamping pipes but needs to replace or upgrade sections of its network, which is much more expensive."
ConocoPhillips,2017-11,"""Our major issue now at Waha in the existing facilities is the pipelines,"" Ammar said. ""They require a lot of funding."""

ConocoPhillips,2017-11,"TUNIS, Nov 21 (Reuters) - Libya's Waha Oil Co is producing about 260,000 barrels per day (bpd), up more than 100,000 bpd from the company's output levels this summer, but further gains are complicated by a lack of investment, its chairman said on Tuesday."
ConocoPhillips,2017-11,"Ahmed Ammar said Waha was aiming to increase output to 375,000 bpd by the end of next year but was facing major funding shortfalls and challenges in maintaining damaged infrastructure."
ConocoPhillips,2017-11,"Waha is a subsidiary of Libya's National Oil Corporation (NOC) and operates as a joint venture with Hess Corp , Marathon Oil Corp and ConocoPhillips ."
ConocoPhillips,2017-11,"Its oil is exported through Es Sider terminal, which reopened late last year after an armed group that was blockading the port was forced out."
ConocoPhillips,2017-11,"Waha's gains have helped raise Libya's national oil output to around one million bpd, about four times higher than the OPEC member's production in mid-2016."
ConocoPhillips,2017-11,"It remains well below the 1.6 million bpd Libya was producing before a 2011 uprising, and vulnerable to continuing political and economic turmoil."
ConocoPhillips,2017-11,"Plans to increase Waha's production to as high as 600,000 bpd over the next five years, partly through major new projects at the NC-98 and Jalo North fields, have been postponed because of a lack of funding, Ammar told Reuters on the sidelines of a business conference in Tunis."
ConocoPhillips,2017-11,But he said some gains could be made by developing drilling in fields that are already in production and replacing pumps that were damaged after long output stoppages.
ConocoPhillips,2017-11,"""Some of the production will come from existing wells. We need to work them over,"" Ammar said."
ConocoPhillips,2017-11,"Some of Waha's fields and facilities have been badly damaged in militant attacks, fighting and looting."
ConocoPhillips,2017-11,"At Es Sider, 12 out of 19 storage tanks remain out of use. Ammar said this was not hampering exports, but would become a constraint if the company raised its production towards 400,000 bpd."
ConocoPhillips,2017-11,"Waha hopes to rebuild two of the storage tanks next year, adding storage capacity of one million barrels, but Ammar said approval for the project from Libya's Audit Bureau was still pending."
ConocoPhillips,2017-11,"Waha has also suffered repeated leaks in its pipeline network, which was damaged by highly corrosive water. In one pipeline there were 57 leaks in a single month, Ammar said."
ConocoPhillips,2017-11,"The company has been patching up or clamping pipes but needs to replace or upgrade sections of its network, which is much more expensive."
ConocoPhillips,2017-11,"""Our major issue now at Waha in the existing facilities is the pipelines,"" Ammar said. ""They require a lot of funding."""

ConocoPhillips,2017-11,"BONN, Germany, Nov 13 (Reuters) - Climate activists will argue in an Oslo court this week that Norway's plans for Arctic oil exploration are unconstitutional, in an emerging branch of law where plaintiffs are trying to enlist a nation's founding principles to limit warming."
ConocoPhillips,2017-11,"The cases, including one in the United States where a group of young people are arguing that global warming threatens their Fifth Amendment right to life, liberty and property, are widening the scope of environmental litigation."
ConocoPhillips,2017-11,Some legal scholars say it is a stretch to invoke the Constitution rather than focus on taxes and regulations to control greenhouse gases. Governments including the U.S. Trump administration and Norway are dismissive.
ConocoPhillips,2017-11,"Still, some cases have succeeded, such as a 2015 case that told the Dutch government to cut greenhouse emissions."
ConocoPhillips,2017-11,"And worldwide, 90 national constitutions have some sort of provisions guaranteeing environmental protection. Article 112 of Norway's constitution speaks of safeguarding a healthy environment for future generations."
ConocoPhillips,2017-11,"""We want the court to recognise that climate change is not some side issue but a fundamental core issue,"" said Jennifer Morgan, executive director of Greenpeace whose lawyers will go to court in Oslo from Tuesday."
ConocoPhillips,2017-11,"""The constitution represents those basic rights,"" she told Reuters in Bonn, Germany, where almost 200 nations are working on ways to bolster the 2015 Paris climate agreement after President Donald Trump decided in June to pull out."
ConocoPhillips,2017-11,"The Norwegian case, brought by Greenpeace and the Nature and Youth group, argues that a 2015 oil licensing round in the Arctic violates the constitution because Norway has agreed to the Paris accord's goals to end the fossil fuel era this century."
ConocoPhillips,2017-11,"Norway's attorney general argues that the oil licences, awarded to Statoil , Chevron , Lukoil, ConocoPhillips and others, have no link to the Constitution. Norway's environmental laws are among the toughest in the world."
ConocoPhillips,2017-11,"The plaintiffs' case is based on ""a distinctly broad, political, and expanded interpretation of the Constitution's article 112,"" the Attorney General's office said in court documents."
ConocoPhillips,2017-11,"Environmentalists say the case is far more than a stunt. Losing could mean having to pay the state's legal fees, meaning a total bill exceeding $500,000."
ConocoPhillips,2017-11,"Worldwide, there are almost 900 lawsuits related to climate change in 25 nations, a U.N. study said in March."
ConocoPhillips,2017-11,"Among them, a Peruvian farmer launched an appeal in Germany on Monday, arguing that greenhouse gas emissions by energy utility RWE are partly to the blame for melting an Andean glacier that is threatening to cause floods."
ConocoPhillips,2017-11,"Cases have risen since the Paris Agreement in 2015. Adding relevance, researchers increasingly say that greenhouse gas emissions have raised the risks of individual extreme events, from heat waves in Europe to downpours in India."

ConocoPhillips,2017-11,"The court case is due to start on Feb. 5, after judges rejected attempts by both the Obama and Trump U.S. administrations to have it dismissed."
ConocoPhillips,2017-11,"And the Dutch government is appealing against a 2015 court ruling that ordered it to slash emissions by 25 percent from 1990 levels by 2020, more deeply than planned, to care for its citizens."

ConocoPhillips,2017-11,UPDATE 4-ConocoPhillips vows financial discipline as it aims to boost output - Reuters News
ConocoPhillips,2017-11,"{{20171108T201533.533+0000}}UPDATE 4-ConocoPhillips vows financial discipline as it aims to boost output(Adds CEO interview, OPEC material, executive pay quotes, updates stock)"
ConocoPhillips,2017-11,"NEW YORK, Nov 8 (Reuters) - ConocoPhillips said on Wednesday it will boost oil and natural gas output for the rest of the decade but vowed it would do so only when it was financially prudent and that it would strictly adhere to shareholder returns."
ConocoPhillips,2017-11,The largest U.S. independent oil and natural gas producer plans to spend an average of $5.5 billion annually for the next three years as long as oil prices stay above $50 per barrel.
ConocoPhillips,2017-11,"""Our value proposition is not built around production growth. It is built around returns,"" Chief Executive Ryan Lance said in an interview on the sidelines of the company's investor day in New York."
ConocoPhillips,2017-11,"The spending forecast, an increase from 2017 and higher than many Wall Street analysts expected, comes as Conoco, like some peers, focuses more on generating profits rather than boosting production at any cost.[nL1N1NE0Z7]"
ConocoPhillips,2017-11,"Much of that discipline is helped by better technology and more efficient processes. The company expects production to grow 5 percent each year for the rest of the decade, helped by output spikes in the Eagle Ford and Permian shales of Texas, two of the largest U.S. oilfields."
ConocoPhillips,2017-11,"That growth will come, Lance said, regardless of what members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries decide this month when they meet in Vienna to debate extending an agreement to curb oil production."
ConocoPhillips,2017-11,"""I don't care what they do,"" Lance said of OPEC's 14 members. ""They're not going to change our plans."""
ConocoPhillips,2017-11,"OPEC and partners, including Russia, are largely expected to extend the agreement, which ends in March.[nL5N1ND6QC]"
ConocoPhillips,2017-11,"U.S. oil prices have risen more than 5 percent in the past month due in part to the success of OPEC's supply cuts. That raises the specter of cost hikes for oilfield services, a situation that would erode margins. But Lance said that Conoco would pull back operations rather than burn cash if that scenario occurred."
ConocoPhillips,2017-11,"""If the returns start to be diluted due to inflationary pressures, we'll pull back and think about fighting another day,"" he said."
ConocoPhillips,2017-11,Lance and his deputies said at an investor presentation on Wednesday morning that they should be able to send more than 30 percent of cash flow back to shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks by 2020.
ConocoPhillips,2017-11,"Shareholder returns are the ""ultimate measure of value creation in our business,"" Lance said."
ConocoPhillips,2017-11,Lance and his deputies were at pains to stress the focus on boosting profits and increasing production only when it makes financial sense.
ConocoPhillips,2017-11,"""It's just not getting big for big's sake,"" Lance said. ""It's about generating high-value earnings and cash flow to boost our returns."""
ConocoPhillips,2017-11,Wall Street has pressured oil producers in the past year to stop rewarding executives for spending billions of dollars on new wells when crude prices are depressed.[nL2N1LZ236]
ConocoPhillips,2017-11,"Lance's 2016 compensation nearly tripled to $19.2 million from 2015 levels, fueling accusations from some investors that the company was not serious about its new focus on shareholder returns.[nFWN1HB0PG]"
ConocoPhillips,2017-11,The pay jump came the same year that Lance slashed Conoco's dividend - the first in 25 years for the company - and the stock price fell.
ConocoPhillips,2017-11,"Lance said on Monday that changes were underway in how the company calculates executive compensation. ""We have identified things that will be addressed"" in compensation discussions, said Lance, who is also chairman of the company's board. ""You can expect more disclosure from us on that front."""
ConocoPhillips,2017-11,Shares of Conoco shares edged up about 0.5 percent to $53.73 in afternoon trading as oil prices edged down by about 0.8 percent.

ConocoPhillips,2017-11,"SINGAPORE, Nov 7 (Reuters) - The rising demand for crude oil that can more easily produce transportation fuels when refined has some Australian and Malaysian producers boasting cargoes valued at close to $70 a barrel, a hefty premium to global benchmarks ."
ConocoPhillips,2017-11,"Malaysia's state oil company Petronas [PETR.UL] sold last week a December-loading Miri Light cargo at a premium of about $4.50 a barrel to dated Brent, equivalent to about $69 at the latest prices, according to multiple traders that participate in the Asian regional crude market."
ConocoPhillips,2017-11,"Australian Barrow Island and Cooper Basin crudes are now close to $70 a barrel currently, based on premiums for grades of about $1.50 a barrel to Malaysian benchmark grade Kimanis, said the traders. Kimanis itself is priced at a premium of about $4.40 a barrel to dated Brent, which was assessed at $64.07 a barrel on Monday by price reporting agency S&P Global Platts."
ConocoPhillips,2017-11,"""Prices of domestic Australian grades are even higher than MCO (Malaysian Crude Oil),"" an Asian trader said. ""That would make them the most expensive crudes in the world."""
ConocoPhillips,2017-11,"Demand for these grades is rising because of the short distances to Asian refineries, which prize the crude for their low sulphur content and higher yields of more valuable oil products such as diesel, the traders said."
ConocoPhillips,2017-11,"Demand for short-haul grades has increased after the Brent oil market structure flipped into backwardation, when prompt prices are more than later prices. That means the value of the crude drops over the course of the voyage."
ConocoPhillips,2017-11,"The refiners are willing to pay up for the Australian and Malaysian crudes rather than incur the additional time and cost of shipping Brent supplies from the North Sea, the traders said."
ConocoPhillips,2017-11,"Typically, Asia-Pacific grades are sold to refineries in Southeast Asia and Australia or New Zealand that have a preference for low-sulphur oil."
ConocoPhillips,2017-11,Values for these grades have risen because of their scarcity.
ConocoPhillips,2017-11,"Petronas and its partners Royal Dutch Shell , ConocoPhillips , Murphy Oil Corp , Pertamina [PERTM.UL] sell about 6 million barrels of Kimanis each month."
ConocoPhillips,2017-11,But volumes for other Malaysian grades such as Kikeh and Labuan have fallen as output declines at the mature fields.
ConocoPhillips,2017-11,"Australia's crude and condensate production has been below 300,000 barrels per day (bpd) since September 2016, data from the country's Department of the Environment and Energy showed. In August it was 279,000 bpd."
ConocoPhillips,2017-11,"Santos Ltd produces about 30,000 bpd of Cooper Basin crude in southern Australia, according to its website."
ConocoPhillips,2017-11,"Santos and its partners, Chevron Corp and Mobil Australia Resources Co, a unit of Exxon Mobil Corp , produces 5,000 bpd of Barrow Island in western Australia, according to Santos."

ConocoPhillips,2017-11,UPDATE 2-Australia's Oil Search buys into promising Alaska oil find - Reuters News
ConocoPhillips,2017-11,{{20171101T064826.194+0000}}UPDATE 2-Australia's Oil Search buys into promising Alaska oil find* Spain's Repsol sees field holding 1.2 bln barrels of oil
ConocoPhillips,2017-11,"MELBOURNE, Nov 1 (Reuters) - Australia's Oil Search Ltd has agreed to buy stakes in a huge oil find in Alaska for $400 million, in a surprise push to diversify from its sweet spot of gas in Papua New Guinea."
ConocoPhillips,2017-11,"Oil Search will pick up stakes in three oil blocks from privately owned U.S. firms Armstrong Energy and GMT Exploration giving it a roughly 26 percent holding in the Nanushuk play, co-owned by Spain's Repsol SA ."
ConocoPhillips,2017-11,"The play includes the Horseshoe block, which hit oil in March in what Repsol called the biggest U.S. onshore find in 30 years. It estimated the field could hold 1.2 billion barrels. [nFWN1GM0QP]"
ConocoPhillips,2017-11,"Oil Search bought in assuming the field holds 500 million barrels, expecting production to begin in 2023, with output to plateau at 80,000 to 120,000 barrels per day."
ConocoPhillips,2017-11,"""With the quality of the assets, the fact that they're tier 1, and the fact that we've gone in very conservatively against what Repsol are saying, I think we can demonstrate to the market that this will be a super deal for Oil Search in the medium term,"" Oil Search Chief Executive Peter Botten told Reuters."
ConocoPhillips,2017-11,"Investors were nervous about the $8 billion company's move into a region where it has no experience and which is dominated by giants like BP and ExxonMobil Corp , sending its shares down 3 percent, especially after it gave up on a push into Kurdistan."
ConocoPhillips,2017-11,Other Australian oil and gas producers rose more than 1 percent on Wednesday.
ConocoPhillips,2017-11,"""Questions will inevitably be asked about Oil Search's competitive advantage to play in Alaska until it proves its operational capability there,"" said Saul Kavonic, an analyst with energy consultants Wood Mackenzie."
ConocoPhillips,2017-11,"RBC analyst Ben Wilson said the move was well-timed near the bottom of the oil price cycle and with some of the appraisal work on the field already done. He said it had ""good prospects"" as the oil was high-grade."
ConocoPhillips,2017-11,"Botten began working on the deal eight months ago when oil prices were about 20 percent lower than now and said Oil Search managed to get the asset despite higher-priced interest from others in nearby fields, whom he declined to name."
ConocoPhillips,2017-11,"The owners of the neighbouring fields are ConocoPhillips , ExxonMobil and Italy's ENI ."
ConocoPhillips,2017-11,Oil Search has the option of doubling its stake in the Alaskan assets for a further $450 million. It plans to fund the deal from its cash reserves.
ConocoPhillips,2017-11,Oil Search will work with oilfield services giant Halliburton Co and Armstrong before taking over as operator of the assets in June 2018.
