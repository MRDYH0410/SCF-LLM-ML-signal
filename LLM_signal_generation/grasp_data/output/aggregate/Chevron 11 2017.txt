Chevron,2017-11,"PDVSA asked its Petropiar joint venture with Chevron Corp to turn over as much as 45 percent of the oil it planned to export in November with no immediate reimbursement, one of the sources said this month."

Chevron,2017-11,* Size of oil majors means hard to find alternative investments
Chevron,2017-11,"LONDON, Nov 17 (Reuters) - The Norwegian sovereign wealth fund's proposal to ditch its oil and gas shares, though hugely symbolic in the battle against climate change, is unlikely to cause a rush to the exit by major investors in the sector in the short term. [nL8N1NM4UW]"
Chevron,2017-11,"The move by the $1 trillion fund, the world's largest, rattled stock markets, exposing what is seen as one of the biggest threats to companies such as Royal Dutch Shell, Exxon Mobil and BP as the world shifts towards renewable energy such as wind and solar."
Chevron,2017-11,"But in the meantime, expectations of growing global demand for oil and gas for decades to come mean reliance on these companies is likely to continue."
Chevron,2017-11,"And although the Norwegian initiative will encourage those seeking to hasten the move to a low-carbon economy, the degree to which other investors can follow the fund's example, at least in the short term, is less clear."
Chevron,2017-11,"The European oil and gas index <.SXEP> fell on Friday to its lowest since late September, extending declines following the Norwegian fund's announcement."
Chevron,2017-11,"For some, it was seen as an opening shot in the decline of the 150-year-old sector in the battle to slow global warming and reduce carbon emissions, reminiscent of the demise of coal."
Chevron,2017-11,"""The investor exit from oil and gas as a fuel source will be slower than coal, but the emissions reduction maths is clear and so this inevitable transition has started,"" said Nathan Fabian, director of policy at Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI), a United Nations-backed group that represents asset managers with holdings of over $60 trillion."
Chevron,2017-11,"""I do not see this as the start of a broader trend among major investors,"" said Rohan Murphy, energy analyst at Allianz, which holds shares in several oil majors."
Chevron,2017-11,"""Gas, which is a big part of all the big oil businesses today, is the answer for the medium-term energy transition to gas from coal for power generation,"" Murphy said."
Chevron,2017-11,Petroleum companies see natural gas as a cleaner alternative to coal for power generation in the effort to wean the world off fossil fuels by the end of the century.
Chevron,2017-11,"""Many wish for a quick and revolutionary role reversal between the oil and gas industry, and the renewable and new electric industry. But undue haste and an overly ideological approach could bring great economic and social damage,"" Total CEO Patrick Pouyanne said in a speech last month."
Chevron,2017-11,"Also, demand for oil in transportation and plastics is not expected to decline significantly until 2050, according to many forecasts. [nL1N1ND281]"
Chevron,2017-11,"The Norwegian announcement came as more than 195 nations met in Bonn, Germany, to decide how to comply with climate targets agreed in Paris in 2015 to limit a rise in global temperatures.[nL8N1NL6I4]"
Chevron,2017-11,"But beyond our dependence on oil and gas, the size of the world's top oil companies would make mass divestment a huge challenge. The top five publicly traded companies - Exxon, Chevron, Shell, BP and Total - together have a market value of over $1 trillion."
Chevron,2017-11,"Coal companies, on the other hand, have always been smaller."
Chevron,2017-11,"For now, there is no viable alternative to oil and gas to meet the world's demand, several investors said."
Chevron,2017-11,"""My guess is that after the initial market adjustment ... the move may not damage the sector's long-term performance significantly,"" said Kevin Gardiner, global investment strategist at Rothschild Wealth Management."
Chevron,2017-11,"The Norwegian wealth fund's move, echoing Saudi Arabia's plan to list part of its national oil company, was aimed at making Norway less exposed to volatile oil prices and less reliant on revenue from fossil fuels."
Chevron,2017-11,"If approved, it would most likely take years for the Norwegian fund to unwind its large investments in the sector and find new homes for the money."
Chevron,2017-11,"And while there is also growing demand from retail investors to invest in 'responsible' or 'sustainable' funds, oil and gas companies are not commonly excluded and any change here would be gradual."
Chevron,2017-11,"Dropping oil and gas companies would also mean missing out on a rich source of dividend income, a prized asset at a time of low bond yields."
Chevron,2017-11,"In absolute terms, the number of oil and gas companies in leading stock indices varies, with 14 in the STOXX 600 index of leading European companies, or 2.3 percent; and 26 in the S&P 500 <.SPX>, or 5.2 percent."
Chevron,2017-11,"The size of some of the largest can have a disproportionate impact on returns relative to their index peers. While there are just two companies in Britain's blue-chip FTSE 100 index, for example, they make up 14 percent of the index's value."
Chevron,2017-11,"While the Norwegian fund has long been a trend-setter for issues around socially responsible investing, particularly in Scandinavia, the reason for this decision is relatively unique."
Chevron,2017-11,"Its desire to make treasury receipts less dependent on the oil price is not a challenge faced by most pension funds, which make up a large slice of the money invested globally."
Chevron,2017-11,"Any decision to ditch oil and gas would arguably leave them less diversified, not more, said investors, although charitable endowments may have more flexibility to do so."

Chevron,2017-11,"The largest recipient of Venezuelan crude in the United States last month was Valero Energy Corp . PDVSA's refining unit, Citgo Petroleum, which recently has struggled to import oil from its parent company because of sanctions and crude availability, was the second largest recipient."
Chevron,2017-11,"Other importers of Venezuelan oil in the United States, including Phillips 66 and Chevron Corp , received smaller supplies than their contracted volumes and typical purchases. Refiner PBF Energy Inc did not buy any cargo directly from PDVSA."

Chevron,2017-11,* But demand for oil and gas to last for decades
Chevron,2017-11,* Size of oil majors means hard to find alternative investments
Chevron,2017-11,"LONDON, Nov 17 (Reuters) - The Norwegian sovereign wealth fund's proposal to ditch its oil and gas shares, though hugely symbolic in the battle against climate change, is unlikely to cause a rush to the exit by major investors in the sector in the short term. [nL8N1NM4UW]"
Chevron,2017-11,"The move by the $1 trillion fund, the world's largest, rattled stock markets, exposing what is seen as one of the biggest threats to companies such as Royal Dutch Shell, Exxon Mobil and BP as the world shifts towards renewable energy such as wind and solar."
Chevron,2017-11,"But in the meantime, expectations of growing global demand for oil and gas for decades to come mean reliance on these companies is likely to continue."
Chevron,2017-11,"And although the Norwegian initiative will encourage those seeking to hasten the move to a low-carbon economy, the degree to which other investors can follow the fund's example, at least in the short term, is less clear."
Chevron,2017-11,"The European oil and gas index <.SXEP> fell on Friday to its lowest since late September, extending declines following the Norwegian fund's announcement."
Chevron,2017-11,"For some, it was seen as an opening shot in the decline of the 150-year-old sector in the battle to slow global warming and reduce carbon emissions, reminiscent of the demise of coal."
Chevron,2017-11,"""The investor exit from oil and gas as a fuel source will be slower than coal, but the emissions reduction maths is clear and so this inevitable transition has started,"" said Nathan Fabian, director of policy at Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI), a United Nations-backed group that represents asset managers with holdings of over $60 trillion."
Chevron,2017-11,"""I do not see this as the start of a broader trend among major investors,"" said Rohan Murphy, energy analyst at Allianz, which holds shares in several oil majors."
Chevron,2017-11,"""Gas, which is a big part of all the big oil businesses today, is the answer for the medium-term energy transition to gas from coal for power generation,"" Murphy said."
Chevron,2017-11,Petroleum companies see natural gas as a cleaner alternative to coal for power generation in the effort to wean the world off fossil fuels by the end of the century.
Chevron,2017-11,"""Many wish for a quick and revolutionary role reversal between the oil and gas industry, and the renewable and new electric industry. But undue haste and an overly ideological approach could bring great economic and social damage,"" Total CEO Patrick Pouyanne said in a speech last month."
Chevron,2017-11,"Also, demand for oil in transportation and plastics is not expected to decline significantly until 2050, according to many forecasts. [nL1N1ND281]"
Chevron,2017-11,"The Norwegian announcement came as more than 195 nations met in Bonn, Germany, to decide how to comply with climate targets agreed in Paris in 2015 to limit a rise in global temperatures.[nL8N1NL6I4]"
Chevron,2017-11,"But beyond our dependence on oil and gas, the size of the world's top oil companies would make mass divestment a huge challenge. The top five publicly traded companies - Exxon, Chevron, Shell, BP and Total - together have a market value of over $1 trillion."
Chevron,2017-11,"Coal companies, on the other hand, have always been smaller."
Chevron,2017-11,"For now, there is no viable alternative to oil and gas to meet the world's demand, several investors said."
Chevron,2017-11,"""My guess is that after the initial market adjustment ... the move may not damage the sector's long-term performance significantly,"" said Kevin Gardiner, global investment strategist at Rothschild Wealth Management."
Chevron,2017-11,"The Norwegian wealth fund's move, echoing Saudi Arabia's plan to list part of its national oil company, was aimed at making Norway less exposed to volatile oil prices and less reliant on revenue from fossil fuels."
Chevron,2017-11,"If approved, it would most likely take years for the Norwegian fund to unwind its large investments in the sector and find new homes for the money."
Chevron,2017-11,"And while there is also growing demand from retail investors to invest in 'responsible' or 'sustainable' funds, oil and gas companies are not commonly excluded and any change here would be gradual."
Chevron,2017-11,"Dropping oil and gas companies would also mean missing out on a rich source of dividend income, a prized asset at a time of low bond yields."
Chevron,2017-11,"In absolute terms, the number of oil and gas companies in leading stock indices varies, with 14 in the STOXX 600 index of leading European companies, or 2.3 percent; and 26 in the S&P 500 <.SPX>, or 5.2 percent."
Chevron,2017-11,"The size of some of the largest can have a disproportionate impact on returns relative to their index peers. While there are just two companies in Britain's blue-chip FTSE 100 index, for example, they make up 14 percent of the index's value."
Chevron,2017-11,"While the Norwegian fund has long been a trend-setter for issues around socially responsible investing, particularly in Scandinavia, the reason for this decision is relatively unique."
Chevron,2017-11,"Its desire to make treasury receipts less dependent on the oil price is not a challenge faced by most pension funds, which make up a large slice of the money invested globally."
Chevron,2017-11,"Any decision to ditch oil and gas would arguably leave them less diversified, not more, said investors, although charitable endowments may have more flexibility to do so."

Chevron,2017-11,"OSLO, Nov 16 (Reuters) - Norway's trillion-dollar sovereign wealth fund is proposing to drop oil and gas companies from its benchmark index, which would mean cutting its investments in those companies, the deputy central bank chief supervising the fund told Reuters, sending energy stocks lower."
Chevron,2017-11,"If adopted by parliament, the fund would over time divest billions of dollars from oil and gas stocks, which now represent 6 percent - or around $37 billion - of the fund's benchmark equity index."
Chevron,2017-11,"The aim is to make the Norwegian government's wealth less vulnerable to a permanent drop in oil prices, at a time when the fund is increasing its exposure to equities to 70 percent of the fund's value from 60 percent earlier."
Chevron,2017-11,Europe's index of oil and gas shares <.SXEP> hit its lowest level since mid-October on the news and was trading down 0.39 percent at 16.41 GMT [nL8N1NM4HN].
Chevron,2017-11,"The proposal came in a letter sent by the central bank to the finance ministry and signed by its governor, Oeystein Olsen, and the chief executive of the fund, Yngve Slyngstad, Deputy Central Bank Governor Egil Matsen said in an interview."
Chevron,2017-11,"""Our advice is to simply remove the oil and gas sector, as it is defined in the FTSE reference index, from the fund's reference index,"" Matsen said."
Chevron,2017-11,"""That would mean all companies that the FTSE has classified with the sector, should be removed from our reference index."""
Chevron,2017-11,"The fund is the world's largest sovereign wealth fund. It invests Norway's revenues from oil and gas production for future generations in stocks, bonds and real estate abroad."
Chevron,2017-11,"It is among the largest investors in a wide range of oil companies, holding stakes at the end of 2016 of 2.3 percent in Royal Dutch Shell , 1.7 percent of BP , 0.9 percent of Chevron and 0.8 percent of Exxon Mobil ."
Chevron,2017-11,"""The risk for the oil sector is how many investment funds will downsize their exposure to extractive industries,"" said Jason Kenney, oil analyst at bank Santander."
Chevron,2017-11,"The fund also held 1.7 percent of Italy's Eni , 1.6 percent of France's Total and 0.9 percent of Sweden's Lundin Petroleum , among others."
Chevron,2017-11,"At the end of the third quarter, Royal Dutch Shell was the fund's third-biggest equity investment overall, worth around $5.34 billion and exceeded only by its ownership in Apple and Nestle ."
Chevron,2017-11,"""This news will be scrutinised very closely by funds around the world who are already looking closely at the climate risks in their portfolios and which sectors and companies will fare best in the low-carbon transition,"" said Stephanie Pfeifer, head of the Institutional Investors Group of Climate Change, which groups 140 investors that work on global warming and represent assets of more than 20 trillion euros."
Chevron,2017-11,"""Investors will look even more carefully at which companies are aligning their business strategies to the transition to a low-carbon energy system and which ones are not. Investors then have a range of options for managing the risks they perceive,"" she told Reuters."
Chevron,2017-11,"The aim of the proposal is to make Norway's wealth less vulnerable to a permanent drop in oil prices, especially at a time when the fund is increasing the proportion of its portfolio it invests in equities to 70 percent from 60 percent previously."
Chevron,2017-11,"""That would mean buying more stocks in the oil and gas sector,"" said Matsen."
Chevron,2017-11,"The fund has grown so large that even though the Norwegian state is taking less than 3 percent of the fund's value every year for its fiscal budget in recent years, oil spending now accounts for one in five crowns spent by the state."
Chevron,2017-11,"In addition to its holdings via the fund, Norway has its own exposure to oil and gas through untapped offshore hydrocarbon reserves, as well as its 67 percent stake in the national oil company, Statoil ."
Chevron,2017-11,"""Oil price exposure of the government's wealth position can be reduced by not having the fund invested in oil and gas stocks,"" said Matsen."
Chevron,2017-11,"The fund could still invest in the sector if other parts of the fund's mandate are fulfilled by having some investments in some of the companies, he said."
Chevron,2017-11,"""But clearly the direction is that ... if the ministry and the politicians think it is good advice and they say yes to it, clearly the investments in the oil and gas sector will decrease over time,"" he added."
Chevron,2017-11,"Initial reactions from Norwegian politicians were positive, with two key centrist opposition parties backing the proposal [nO9N1N7006]. Green campaigners also welcomed the news."
Chevron,2017-11,"""Bravo Norway, and let's hope it gets through because the future of fossil fuel investment is looking shaky indeed,"" said Rachel Kennerley, climate campaigner at Friends of the Earth."
Chevron,2017-11,"Since 2015, the fund no longer invests in companies that derive more than 30 percent of their revenues or activities from coal - one of an early group of investors to do so, which has made the coal sector less attractive to some investors."
Chevron,2017-11,"Oil and gas stocks would be replaced by investments in other companies, Matsen said. ""The straight answer is that all other sectors would be weighted up in proportion ... (under) our current mandate,"" he said."
Chevron,2017-11,"At the end of 2016, the fund's equity investments were split between investments in the financial sector (23.3 percent), industrial companies (14.1 percent), consumer goods (13.7 percent), consumer services (10.3 percent), healthcare (10.2 percent), technology (9,5 percent), oil and gas (6.4 percent), basic materials (5.6 percent), telecoms (3.2 percent) and utilities (3.1 percent)."
Chevron,2017-11,"The proposal has to be reviewed by the Finance Ministry, which in turn needs to decide whether to propose it to parliament. The Finance Ministry said it would conclude with its own view in the autumn of 2018. [nO9N1ML02E]"
Chevron,2017-11,"If it backs the central bank's proposal, Parliament could vote on it in June 2019 at the earliest."

Chevron,2017-11,"LONDON, Nov 9 (Reuters) - The world's top oil and gas companies are under growing pressure to revive share and dividend rewards to investors as profits and oil prices get back on track after a three-year crunch."
Chevron,2017-11,"BP fired the opening shot last week by surprising the market with the resumption of share buybacks after diluting share value for three years through scrip dividends, where investors can opt to receive dividends in shares or cash.[nL8N1N61IG]"
Chevron,2017-11,"The pressure is now on Royal Dutch Shell to make good on commitments made in 2015, following the decision to acquire BG Group for $54 billion, to remove scrip in 2017 and launch a $25 billion share buyback programme from 2017 to 2020."
Chevron,2017-11,"""There is a competition to see who can first remove the scrip, resume the buyback and then maybe, how much can you buy back and compensate for years of share dilution,"" said Jags Walia, asset manager at Dutch pension fund APG, which holds shares in Shell and BP."
Chevron,2017-11,"""I'd like to see them (Shell) announce the turning off of scrip, start talking about the $25 billion buyback - it has been a while since they spoke about that."""
Chevron,2017-11,"Shell did not provide an update on its plans with its third-quarter results, which showed the company generated sufficient cash to cover dividends for the fifth straight quarter, outdoing its larger rival Exxon Mobil . [nL8N1N81KV]"
Chevron,2017-11,"Chief Financial Officer Jessica Uhl said in a call last week that Shell's priorities remain to reduce debt, pay dividends and turn off scrip before turning to share repurchases."
Chevron,2017-11,"Changing the dividend policy will have a significant impact on Shell's balance sheet even with cashflow soaring to $28 billion in the first nine months. Dividend payouts for the Anglo-Dutch company in the 12 months to September amounted to $15 billion, with scrip accounting for around a quarter."
Chevron,2017-11,"Norway's Statoil confirmed in October it would revert to full cash dividends from the fourth quarter, after ending a two-year scrip dividend programme.[nL8N1N10QO]"
Chevron,2017-11,France's Total said it will scrap the discount offered for scrip shares in 2018.
Chevron,2017-11,"Shares of oil companies went through a roller coaster in recent years, tracking the collapse of oil prices in 2014 from over $100 a barrel to as low as $28 a barrel."
Chevron,2017-11,"Deep cost savings, job cuts, asset sales and the recovery in oil prices to above $64 a barrel this month have all helped boost profits and shares back to levels similar to 2014."
Chevron,2017-11,"With the Shell's $30 billion asset disposal programme on track to be completed almost a year ahead of schedule and debt trending towards around 20 percent, removing scrip will be in focus at its investor day at the end of the month."
Chevron,2017-11,"""The pressure is on Shell to draw a line in the sand and commit to end scrip dividend,"" said Brendan Warn, analyst at BMO Capital Markets."
Chevron,2017-11,"Removing scrip, effectively used to preserve cash in hard times, will send the clearest message yet that Shell, as well as other companies, have adapted to a world of lower prices, Warn said."
Chevron,2017-11,"Dividends are a major burden on oil majors' balance sheets, amounting to more than $47 billion in 2017."
Chevron,2017-11,"But none, bar Italy's Eni cut levels throughout the three-year downturn. Shell has repeatedly boasted that it hasn't reduced dividends since the Second World War."

Chevron,2017-11,"HOUSTON/LONDON, Nov 8 (Reuters) - Two decades ago, BP set out to transcend oil, adopting a sunburst logo to convey its plans to pour $8 billion over a decade into renewable technologies, even promising to power its gas stations with the sun."
Chevron,2017-11,"That transformation - marketed as ""Beyond Petroleum"" - led to manufacturing solar panels in Australia, Spain and the United States and erecting wind farms in the United States and the Netherlands."
Chevron,2017-11,"Today, BP might be more aptly branded ""Back to Petroleum"" after exiting or scaling back its renewable energy investments. Lower-cost Chinese components upended its solar panel business, which the firm shed in 2011. A year later, BP tried to sell its U.S. wind power business but couldn't get a buyer."
Chevron,2017-11,"""We made very big bets in the past,"" BP Chief Executive Bob Dudley told Reuters in an interview. ""A lot of those didn't work. We're not sure yet what will be commercially acceptable."""
Chevron,2017-11,The costly lesson of the biggest foray yet by an oil major into renewable energy was not lost on rival firms.
Chevron,2017-11,Even as governments and environmentalists forecast a peak in oil demand within a generation - and China and India say they may eventually ban gasoline and diesel vehicles - leaders of the world's biggest oil firms are not buying the argument that their traditional business faces any imminent threat.
Chevron,2017-11,"A Reuters analysis of clean energy investments and forecasts by oil majors, along with exclusive interviews with top oil executives, reveal mostly token investments in alternative energy. Today, renewable power projects get about 3 percent of $100 billion in combined annual spending by the five biggest oil firms, according to energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie."
Chevron,2017-11,"BP, Chevron , Exxon Mobil , Royal Dutch Shell and Total are instead milking their drilling and processing assets to finance investor payouts now and bolster balance sheets for the future. They believe they can enter new energy sectors later by acquiring companies or technologies if and when others prove them profitable."
Chevron,2017-11,"""There is no sign of peak demand right now,"" said Chevron CEO John Watson, an economist by training, who is retiring in early 2018. ""For the next 10 or 20 years, we expect to see oil demand growth."""
Chevron,2017-11,"The International Energy Agency forecasts a 10 percent rise in oil demand through 2040, reflecting the consensus among oil firms. The earliest estimate for peak oil demand from any oil company is late next decade, by Shell CEO Ben van Beurden."
Chevron,2017-11,"History shows energy transitions - from wood to coal to oil - take a long time. Coal's contribution to world energy consumption peaked recently at 28 percent and remains above the share from natural gas, though just below oil's one-third."
Chevron,2017-11,"Profit, if any, from the majors' decades-long interest in renewable energy ventures is unclear. None of the largest oil companies disclose earnings from their solar, wind or biofuels ventures."
Chevron,2017-11,"Investors such as Alasdair McKinnon, portfolio manager at Scottish Investment Trust, believe oil will sustain shareholders far into the future."
Chevron,2017-11,"""There isn't a viable alternative to fossil fuels on the horizon,"" he said. ""We're not buying into the long-term demand destruction for oil."""
Chevron,2017-11,"The confidence in oil's future relies largely on rising consumption from emerging economies. Exxon forecasts that transportation will require 25 percent more fuel by 2040, propelled by growth in Asia. Chevron's analysis of the India and Nigeria markets, meanwhile, concludes that infrastructure needed for electric cars is unlikely to be built."
Chevron,2017-11,"Cars account for about a fifth of oil consumption, BP estimates. So if electric vehicles do eventually capture mass markets, oil firms would still expect growing demand from the air, rail and trucking industries."
Chevron,2017-11,"Natural gas - now a smaller business than oil for most majors - can grow to nearly a quarter of all energy used by displacing coal in power generation and through expanded uses in chemicals, these companies forecast. Natural gas can also fuel the power needed for electric cars."
Chevron,2017-11,"Although Shell forecasts peak oil demand coming earlier than its rivals, it is preparing for that prospect mostly with massive natural gas investments. The firm last year spent $54 billion acquiring BG Group, which derives half its production from gas. Chevron, Exxon and Shell recently have spent billions of dollars on new liquefied natural gas projects across the globe."
Chevron,2017-11,"Critics of oil majors' cautious renewable strategy - including some big investors - say the firms are being short-sighted in their trust that change will come slow, or that one fossil fuel will gradually replace another. Just as cheap natural gas is supplanting coal, even cheaper wind or solar eventually will displace gas, they argue."
Chevron,2017-11,"South Australia is soon to become a proving ground for a project could pave the way for renewable power to supplant fossil fuels for peak electricity - a combined wind farm and grid-scale battery storage facility, by electric-car maker Tesla Inc and operator Windlab Ltd."
Chevron,2017-11,"Fossil fuel companies need to quickly reorient themselves to the low returns of the solar and wind industries, said Jules Kortenhorst, a former Shell executive who runs the Rocky Mountain Institute, a nonprofit energy research organization."
Chevron,2017-11,"""You cannot flip a switch on a Monday morning from being one to another,"" he said. ""Paychecks in the oil and gas industry are based on fundamentally believing that the world cannot see economic growth without fossil fuels."""
Chevron,2017-11,"To achieve the same share of the renewables market that the largest publicly-traded oil companies now hold in oil and gas would require an investment of about $350 billion over the next 18 years, estimates Wood Mackenzie. Such spending would cut into the generous dividends that oil firms' shareholders have come to expect."
Chevron,2017-11,"""We think it will be a real challenge for these companies to change their business model,"" said Nathan Fabian, director of policy at Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI), a United Nations-backed group."
Chevron,2017-11,"PRI has guidelines calling for investment analysis that weighs environmental, social and governance issues. Its principles have been adopted by investors with $70 trillion in assets under management."
Chevron,2017-11,"Oil companies have made relatively modest investments a wide range of renewable technologies. Chevron has a smattering of mostly small wind and solar ventures; Shell invests in sugar-cane ethanol in South America, wind farms in the United States and electric-car charging stations in Europe; and BP still owns the U.S. wind farms it once tried to sell."
Chevron,2017-11,John Browne - who as BP's CEO two decades ago helped launch the early investments in renewables - said he still believes the renewable power will grow.

Chevron,2017-11,"HOUSTON/LONDON, Nov 8 (Reuters) - Two decades ago, BP set out to transcend oil, adopting a sunburst logo to convey its plans to pour $8 billion over a decade into renewable technologies, even promising to power its gas stations with the sun."
Chevron,2017-11,"That transformation - marketed as ""Beyond Petroleum"" - led to manufacturing solar panels in Australia, Spain and the United States and erecting wind farms in the United States and the Netherlands."
Chevron,2017-11,"Today, BP might be more aptly branded ""Back to Petroleum"" after exiting or scaling back its renewable energy investments. Lower-cost Chinese components upended its solar panel business, which the firm shed in 2011. A year later, BP tried to sell its U.S. wind power business but couldn't get a buyer."
Chevron,2017-11,"""We made very big bets in the past,"" BP Chief Executive Bob Dudley told Reuters in an interview. ""A lot of those didn't work. We're not sure yet what will be commercially acceptable."""
Chevron,2017-11,The costly lesson of the biggest foray yet by an oil major into renewable energy was not lost on rival firms.
Chevron,2017-11,Even as governments and environmentalists forecast a peak in oil demand within a generation - and China and India say they may eventually ban gasoline and diesel vehicles - leaders of the world's biggest oil firms are not buying the argument that their traditional business faces any imminent threat.
Chevron,2017-11,"A Reuters analysis of clean energy investments and forecasts by oil majors, along with exclusive interviews with top oil executives, reveal mostly token investments in alternative energy. Today, renewable power projects get about 3 percent of $100 billion in combined annual spending by the five biggest oil firms, according to energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie."
Chevron,2017-11,"BP, Chevron , Exxon Mobil , Royal Dutch Shell and Total are instead milking their drilling and processing assets to finance investor payouts now and bolster balance sheets for the future. They believe they can enter new energy sectors later by acquiring companies or technologies if and when others prove them profitable."
Chevron,2017-11,"""There is no sign of peak demand right now,"" said Chevron CEO John Watson, an economist by training, who is retiring in early 2018. ""For the next 10 or 20 years, we expect to see oil demand growth."""
Chevron,2017-11,"The International Energy Agency forecasts a 10 percent rise in oil demand through 2040, reflecting the consensus among oil firms. The earliest estimate for peak oil demand from any oil company is late next decade, by Shell CEO Ben van Beurden."
Chevron,2017-11,"History shows energy transitions - from wood to coal to oil - take a long time. Coal's contribution to world energy consumption peaked recently at 28 percent and remains above the share from natural gas, though just below oil's one-third."
Chevron,2017-11,"Profit, if any, from the majors' decades-long interest in renewable energy ventures is unclear. None of the largest oil companies disclose earnings from their solar, wind or biofuels ventures."
Chevron,2017-11,"Investors such as Alasdair McKinnon, portfolio manager at Scottish Investment Trust, believe oil will sustain shareholders far into the future."
Chevron,2017-11,"""There isn't a viable alternative to fossil fuels on the horizon,"" he said. ""We're not buying into the long-term demand destruction for oil."""
Chevron,2017-11,"The confidence in oil's future relies largely on rising consumption from emerging economies. Exxon forecasts that transportation will require 25 percent more fuel by 2040, propelled by growth in Asia. Chevron's analysis of the India and Nigeria markets, meanwhile, concludes that infrastructure needed for electric cars is unlikely to be built."
Chevron,2017-11,"Cars account for about a fifth of oil consumption, BP estimates. So if electric vehicles do eventually capture mass markets, oil firms would still expect growing demand from the air, rail and trucking industries."
Chevron,2017-11,"Natural gas - now a smaller business than oil for most majors - can grow to nearly a quarter of all energy used by displacing coal in power generation and through expanded uses in chemicals, these companies forecast. Natural gas can also fuel the power needed for electric cars."

Chevron,2017-11,"SINGAPORE, Nov 7 (Reuters) - The rising demand for crude oil that can more easily produce transportation fuels when refined has some Australian and Malaysian producers boasting cargoes valued at close to $70 a barrel, a hefty premium to global benchmarks ."
Chevron,2017-11,"Malaysia's state oil company Petronas [PETR.UL] sold last week a December-loading Miri Light cargo at a premium of about $4.50 a barrel to dated Brent, equivalent to about $69 at the latest prices, according to multiple traders that participate in the Asian regional crude market."
Chevron,2017-11,"Australian Barrow Island and Cooper Basin crudes are now close to $70 a barrel currently, based on premiums for grades of about $1.50 a barrel to Malaysian benchmark grade Kimanis, said the traders. Kimanis itself is priced at a premium of about $4.40 a barrel to dated Brent, which was assessed at $64.07 a barrel on Monday by price reporting agency S&P Global Platts."
Chevron,2017-11,"""Prices of domestic Australian grades are even higher than MCO (Malaysian Crude Oil),"" an Asian trader said. ""That would make them the most expensive crudes in the world."""
Chevron,2017-11,"Demand for these grades is rising because of the short distances to Asian refineries, which prize the crude for their low sulphur content and higher yields of more valuable oil products such as diesel, the traders said."
Chevron,2017-11,"Demand for short-haul grades has increased after the Brent oil market structure flipped into backwardation, when prompt prices are more than later prices. That means the value of the crude drops over the course of the voyage."
Chevron,2017-11,"The refiners are willing to pay up for the Australian and Malaysian crudes rather than incur the additional time and cost of shipping Brent supplies from the North Sea, the traders said."
Chevron,2017-11,"Typically, Asia-Pacific grades are sold to refineries in Southeast Asia and Australia or New Zealand that have a preference for low-sulphur oil."
Chevron,2017-11,Values for these grades have risen because of their scarcity.
Chevron,2017-11,"Petronas and its partners Royal Dutch Shell , ConocoPhillips , Murphy Oil Corp , Pertamina [PERTM.UL] sell about 6 million barrels of Kimanis each month."
Chevron,2017-11,But volumes for other Malaysian grades such as Kikeh and Labuan have fallen as output declines at the mature fields.

Chevron,2017-11,"CALGARY, Alberta, Nov 6 (Reuters) - Chevron Canada, a unit of global oil major Chevron Corp , is forging ahead with its first ever Canadian shale play development, targeting the East Kaybob region of central Alberta's Duvernay formation."
Chevron,2017-11,"The decision, announced by the company on Monday, is a rare bright spot for Canada's oil industry, which was hard hit by the global crude price downturn. International energy firms sold off nearly $23 billion in assets this year alone. [nL1N1IY25W]"
Chevron,2017-11,"Chevron will initially develop around 55,000 acres in the Duvernay. That could eventually spur more drilling in other parts of the 330,000 acre portion of the shale formation controlled by Chevron Canada, company spokesman Leif Sollid said."
Chevron,2017-11,"He did not comment on Chevron's expected production or capital spend in the Duvernay, citing corporate disclosure rules, but said it was a major step forward for the company which has spent three years appraising the Kaybob area."
Chevron,2017-11,"""This is a very significant business opportunity for Chevron Canada and our very first foray into development in the liquids-rich Duvernay,"" Sollid told Reuters."
Chevron,2017-11,"""Since we began appraisal drilling we have made significant improvements in costs and cycle times by applying Chevron's learnings in other North American shale plays including the Permian in Texas."""

Chevron,2017-11,"The inventory of drilled-but-uncompleted wells, a backlog for future output, in September reached 7,120, up 42.6 percent from the year-ago period, and an all-time high. While the number of oil drilling rigs in the United States has slid in recent months, each rig's efficiency has jumped sharply in the past year."
Chevron,2017-11,"EOG Resources Inc boosted third-quarter production by 8 percent and swung to a $100 million profit, from a loss in the same period last year, helped in part by rising oil prices. CEO Bill Thomas said the company is aiming for 20 percent increase in U.S. crude output this year over last. Its stock is up nearly 17 percent since August.[nL2N1N821M]"
Chevron,2017-11,"Noble Energy forecast its fourth-quarter shale production will rise 15 percent to at least 102,000 bpd."

Chevron,2017-11,"Continental Resources Inc and Parsley Energy Inc , two other large U.S. shale producers, are due to report quarterly results next week."
Chevron,2017-11,"U.S. shale increases are keenly watched by OPEC, and likely will be in the spotlight when the group and other major producers meet on Nov. 30 in Vienna."
Chevron,2017-11,"Emmanuel Kachikwu, Nigeria's oil minister, warned at the last OPEC meeting in May that the group would ""sit down again and look at what process it is we need to do"" if U.S. shale output continues to weigh on global markets.[nL1N1IQ0AC]"
Chevron,2017-11,"Adding to the pressures, major oil companies that were late to recognize shale's potential have brought their own resources to bear. Chevron Corp and Exxon Mobil Corp are setting out aggressive plans for U.S. shale production, especially in the Permian.[nL2N1N20S2]"
Chevron,2017-11,"Exxon, which more than doubled its Permian holdings earlier this year, plans to boost the number of drilling rigs there by 50 percent, to 30, by the end of next year. By 2020, Exxon expects its Permian oil production to rise 45 percent.[nL2N1N20K7]"

Chevron,2017-11,"MEXICO CITY, Nov 2 (Reuters) - Uncertainty about the fate of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and investor protections it guarantees could crimp future investment in Mexico's oil industry, including a high-stakes January deepwater auction."

Chevron,2017-11,"The January deepwater tender of 29 blocks holding some 4.2 billion barrels of prospective reserves, could suffer if concerns about NAFTA's future persuaded oil majors such as Chevron Corp and Exxon Mobil Corp to sit out the auction, oil executives and former government officials say."

Chevron,2017-11,"""Future investment without those investment protections of NAFTA will take into account the higher level of risk of any dispute not being settled in a more fair manner,"" Tim Callahan, Mexico country manager for Australia's BHP Billiton , told Reuters."
Chevron,2017-11,"Energy firms worry the end of NAFTA could eliminate the so-called Investor State Dispute Settlement, which allows such conflicts to be settled via international arbitrators, overriding contractual clauses that only reference local courts."
Chevron,2017-11,"Last December, BHP Billiton won a 60 percent stake in the $11 billion Trion field in the Gulf of Mexico, the flagship deepwater project of state-owned oil company Pemex."
Chevron,2017-11,"That same day, eight of 10 blocks were awarded in the deepwater auction, yielding investment commitments worth hundreds of millions of dollars in the first few years of the contracts alone by firms like U.S.-based Chevron and Murphy Oil."
Chevron,2017-11,"The auctions are part of a 2013 energy reform that ended Pemex's monopoly on oil and gas production. So far, the reform has secured investment pledges that will eventually be worth about $80 billion, the government says."
Chevron,2017-11,"Callahan, who heads the Mexican oil producer association's NAFTA committee, pointed to longstanding nationalist sentiment toward oil and a lack of legal precedents during the 75-year Pemex monopoly."
Chevron,2017-11,"""I don't think any of us want to be the first to test in the Mexican courts how they're going to rule on any disputes when it comes to oil,"" he said."
Chevron,2017-11,"Threats to NAFTA may force some U.S. oil firms to opt out of January's tenders, said former deputy energy minister Lourdes Melgar, an architect of the auctions. Some deem the investor dispute mechanism ""essential"" to protect investments, she added."
Chevron,2017-11,"Some of the biggest investments to date were made only after the government assured firms behind closed doors that any expropriation or administrative withdrawal of contracts could be appealed using the NAFTA resolution mechanism, said Carlos Pascual, a former U.S. ambassador to Mexico now at IHS Markit."
Chevron,2017-11,"The assurances were made before Trump's surprise election win and company concerns over investor protections lasted ""up until the last minute"" before bids were submitted, Pascual said."
Chevron,2017-11,"Without NAFTA, investment disputes could fall to Mexican courts, which unsettles some firms concerned that local judges are often susceptible to bribes or intimidation, oil company executives and former officials say."

Chevron,2017-11,"Even under the oil contracts' administrative withdrawal clause, companies are entitled to an audience to present their case, the participation of an independent expert and there are no one-person decisions, said Juan Carlos Zepeda, head of oil regulator CNH, which is in charge of supervising the contracts."
Chevron,2017-11,"Energy Minister Pedro Joaquin Coldwell told Reuters that even without NAFTA protections, respect for due process was embedded in Mexico's legal system.

Chevron,2017-11,"CARACAS, Nov 2 (Reuters) - The head of Venezuelan oil company PDVSA's subsidiary Bariven was arrested this week, according to two sources and an internal message seen by Reuters, as a graft investigation in the OPEC member swells."
Chevron,2017-11,"Francisco Jimenez, the head of procurement arm Bariven, was detained on Tuesday afternoon at PDVSA's Caracas headquarters, the internal message read. Another executive, Joaquin Torres, was detained alongside him, according to the message."
Chevron,2017-11,"PDVSA did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the arrests. Chief prosecutor Tarek Saab was due to make an announcement on ""legal advances in the Bariven case"" later on Thursday."
Chevron,2017-11,"About two dozen high-level executives have been arrested in recent weeks, ridding PDVSA of much of its top brass. Last week, Spanish authorities arrested a former Venezuelan deputy minister and three former executives at state companies for alleged links to money laundering and international corruption. [nL2N1N116U] [nL2N1N3008]"
Chevron,2017-11,"Bariven has been in the spotlight since 2015, after U.S. authorities arrested two prominent Venezuelan oil businessmen on charges of violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). Both men have pleaded guilty to bribing PDVSA officials in order to win juicy contracts with Bariven."
Chevron,2017-11,"Socialist-run Venezuela originally slammed the investigations as sabotage by the U.S government, its ideological foe."
Chevron,2017-11,"But in a turnaround, PDVSA said in July last year it was actually a victim of fraud and Bariven then asked a U.S. court to order the two businessmen to compensate it for $600 million in losses."
Chevron,2017-11,"President Nicolas Maduro's government and PDVSA, which is formally known as Petroleos de Venezuela SA, have repeatedly vowed to take steps to combat corruption, which has affected the nation and its oil industry for decades. [nL2N1H61B7]"
Chevron,2017-11,Opposition leaders say PDVSA has been crippled by malfeasance under 18 years of socialist rule. They say sporadic arrests are the result of infighting among rival government factions.
Chevron,2017-11,"Sources close to PDVSA say the arrests owe more to turf wars for control of the company, which is the financial motor of Venezuela's ailing economy, than a wholesale effort to clean up graft. [nL1N1KT1ER]"
Chevron,2017-11,Several oil industry sources have said workers at PDVSA are increasingly nervous about the spreading graft probes.
