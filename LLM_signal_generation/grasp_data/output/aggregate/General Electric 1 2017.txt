General Electric,2017-1,{{20170131T214754.028+0000}}UPDATE 2-Siemens raises outlook after Q1 profit beats forecasts * Now expects FY industrial margin of 11-12 pct vs 10.5-11.5 pct
General Electric,2017-1,"MUNICH, Germany, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Top European engineering group Siemens raised its earnings forecasts on Tuesday after its industrial business profit jumped in the fiscal first quarter, lifted by its factory automation unit."
General Electric,2017-1,"The German trains-to-turbines company said it now expected an industrial profit margin of 11-12 percent for the year to end-September, versus its previous forecast for 10.5-11.5 percent. It made 13 percent in the first quarter."
General Electric,2017-1,"Siemens' core industrial software division, Digital Factory, reported a 60 percent profit jump in profit and a margin of 26.1 percent, boosted by a one-off portfolio gain but also a 4 percent rise in sales driven by China."
General Electric,2017-1,"That lifted group industrial profit 26 percent to 2.51 billion euros, well above the average estimate of 2.14 billion euros in a Reuters poll, even excluding the 172 million-euro gain. [nL5N1FG6OW]"
General Electric,2017-1,"Siemens did not say in its statement whether sales had also risen in the United States, as they did in the quarter for U.S. rival Rockwell Automation , whose stock has risen about 19 percent since Donald Trump was elected president on Nov. 8."
General Electric,2017-1,"""We will continue to rigorously execute our strategy programme,"" said Chief Executive and former finance chief Joe Kaeser, under whose stewardship Siemens' past execution blunders and related large one-off charges have largely disappeared."
General Electric,2017-1,"Siemens said it was ahead of schedule with an 8 billion-euro ($8.6 billion) electricity contract in Egypt, its largest single order to date, which is designed to boost the north African nation's power-generation capacity by 45 percent. [nFWN1FL0V1]"
General Electric,2017-1,"But first-quarter orders fell by a greater-than-expected 14 percent, partly reflecting the lack of a similar large contract this year but also a sharp drop in power and gas orders from Europe and the Middle East and a big decline in the Americas."
General Electric,2017-1,"U.S. rival General Electric's orders in power-related equipment including gas turbines, where it competes with Siemens, fell 28 percent in the quarter, compared with a 40 percent drop for Siemens."
General Electric,2017-1,"Siemens' first-quarter sales rose by a weaker-than-expected 3 percent on a comparable basis to 19.1 billion euros ($20.6 billion). The company stuck to its forecasts for ""moderate"" full-year sales growth and orders higher than sales."
General Electric,2017-1,"It raised its earnings-per-share forecast to 7.20 to 7.70 euros from a previous 6.80 to 7.20 euros, after net profit jumped 25 percent to 1.94 billion euros."
General Electric,2017-1,"Siemens gave no further details on plans for its healthcare division Healthineers, which it plans to list while keeping a majority stake, ahead of a press conference and annual shareholder meeting on Wednesday. ($1 = 0.9265 euros)"

General Electric,2017-1,"Simonelli, who said GE was on track to complete the merger of its oil and gas services with Baker Hughes in mid 2017, expects GE's activity in the sector to slow down this year versus 2016 as the projects pipeline dwindles."
General Electric,2017-1,"""2017 is about rebuilding the backlog as you start seeing projects re-emerge in the second half of 2017,"" Simonelli told Reuters at the GE Oil and Gas annual meeting in Florence."
General Electric,2017-1,"""We're already seeing some of our customers look at offshore, look at deepwater and we anticipate as you go out into 2018-19 the projects will start to happen."""

General Electric,2017-1,{{20170130T180052.076+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-Immigration ban hands U.S. firms dilemma(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.)
General Electric,2017-1,"NEW YORK, Jan 30 (Reuters Breakingviews) - The U.S. immigration ban hands a dilemma to the country's companies. Tech firms, Goldman Sachs , Starbucks and others may become political targets after criticizing a temporary White House block on entry by citizens from seven mostly Muslim states. But silence may alienate customers and future workers."
General Electric,2017-1,Speaking out against an edict that is draped in the flag of national security may increase the level of President Donald Trump's invective on Twitter and elsewhere. That already had corporate America walking on eggshells.
General Electric,2017-1,"There's also the chance companies could lose business from customers who support Trump and his policies. After the November election, PepsiCo faced a boycott after Chief Executive Indra Nooyi said her daughters and some employees were ""in mourning."" Starbucks came in for similar criticism on Monday after its CEO, Howard Schultz, said the company would hire 10,000 refugees."
General Electric,2017-1,"Yet keeping quiet carries risks, too. Angry customers bombarded Uber [UBER.UL] using the social-media hashtag #DeleteUber after the ride-hailing app failed to join a one-hour New York City taxi strike protesting against Trump's order. Boss Travis Kalanick later said Uber was donating $3 million to a legal fund for drivers facing immigration issues. Rival service Lyft had already donated $1 million to the American Civil Liberties Union."
General Electric,2017-1,"Many businesses seeking younger users and customers have spent years trying to appeal to millennials, and the younger generation Z, who expect them to show a social conscience. That's one reason why they have pledged better working conditions and committed to causes like fighting climate change and eradicating poverty, as well as speaking out against Indiana for its anti-gay legislation in 2015, for example."
General Electric,2017-1,"Every company will have to balance its corporate goals with its top bosses' views, the interests of employees, and political concerns. Communications teams and crisis public-relations firms must be working overtime."
General Electric,2017-1,- Over the weekend several Silicon Valley companies spoke out against President Donald Trump's Jan. 27 executive order that temporarily bars U.S. entry to citizens from seven majority-Muslim countries.
General Electric,2017-1,"- Alphabet co-Chief Executive Sergey Brin joined protesters at San Francisco International Airport on Jan. 28. The company has also put on its homepage an image of Fred Korematsu, the American civil-rights lawyer who fought against the internment of Japanese-American citizens during World War Two. Along with Apple and Facebook , Alphabet also emailed employees to denounce the decree."
General Electric,2017-1,"- Lyft donated $1 million to the American Civil Liberties Union. Uber, after causing a backlash by not joining a one-hour New York City taxi strike to protest the edict, donated $3 million to a legal defense fund for drivers affected by immigration issues. Chief Executive Travis Kalanick, along with Tesla CEO Elon Musk, offered to take industry concerns about the ban to Trump's business advisory council, of which they are both members."
General Electric,2017-1,"- Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz in an email to staff on Jan. 29 pledged to hire 10,000 refugees around the world. Goldman Sachs boss Lloyd Blankfein told employees on Jan. 30: ""This is not a policy we support."" GE CEO Jeff Immelt said he shares his employees' ""concern"" about the ban."

General Electric,2017-1,* Says US oil above mid-$50s/bbl to spur N. America spend
General Electric,2017-1,"Jan 26 (Reuters) - Oilfield services provider Baker Hughes Inc , which is being acquired by General Electric Co , said crude oil prices would need to rise by roughly another 15 percent to spur producers to spend more on drilling outside North America."
General Electric,2017-1,"Oil prices in the mid- to upper-$50s-per-barrel range would encourage North American producers, while prices above $65 per barrel would coax international producers to boost spending, Chief Executive Martin Craighead said."
General Electric,2017-1,"U.S. crude oil futures were at nearly $54 per barrel at 1800 GMT on Thursday, while Brent prices were at $56.32."
General Electric,2017-1,"While producers have put more rigs back to work in low-cost North American shale fields, such as the Permian Basin in Texas, due to higher oil prices, they have been reluctant to bet bigger on the expensive deepwater and mature oilfields outside the region."
General Electric,2017-1,"But, Baker Hughes said its revenue from North America would fall again in the current quarter, which coupled with a bigger-than-expected fourth-quarter loss due to a higher tax rate, sent the company's shares down about 1 percent to $62.92."
General Electric,2017-1,Baker Hughes said its current-quarter North America revenue would be hurt by reduced activity in the Gulf of Mexico and the spin off of its pressure pumping business.
General Electric,2017-1,"The company said it expects revenue from the region to rise over the first half of the year as producers ramp up onshore drilling, but said any pricing improvements would be limited as the market stays oversupplied."
General Electric,2017-1,"The company expects its international revenue to fall by ""mid to upper single digits"" in percentage terms this quarter, reinforcing the subdued demand predicted by rivals Halliburton Co and Schlumberger NV ."
General Electric,2017-1,Net loss attributable to Baker Hughes rose to $417 million in the fourth quarter from $1.03 billion a year earlier when it booked a $1.25 billion impairment charge. [nBwsqzt9a]
General Electric,2017-1,"Excluding such items, it loss 30 cents per share, much more than analysts' average estimate of a 11 cents loss, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. At least six analysts said the difference was due to a higher tax rate."
General Electric,2017-1,"Baker Hughes' revenue fell about 29 percent to $2.41 billion, beating analysts' average estimate of $2.37 billion."
General Electric,2017-1,"Revenue from its North America business fell nearly 32 percent, while revenue from other regions dropped nearly 29 percent, the company said."

General Electric,2017-1,{{20170125T174610.048+0000}}General Electric to have logo patch on Boston Celtics jerseysBy Tim Baysinger
General Electric,2017-1,"Jan 25 (Reuters) - The Boston Celtics will wear General Electric Co's corporate logo on their jerseys during basketball games beginning next season, the NBA franchise announced on Wednesday."
General Electric,2017-1,"The National Basketball Association is the first major North American pro sports league to allow advertising on game uniforms as a way to add another revenue stream, a practice that is far more common internationally."
General Electric,2017-1,The sponsorship is part of a three-year trial that will begin with the 2017-2018 season. GE moved its headquarters to Boston in 2016.
General Electric,2017-1,"The Celtics are the third team to sell a jersey sponsorship, joining the Sacramento Kings and Philadelphia 76ers. The 76ers' jersey will be sponsored by online ticket exchange StubHub, while the Kings cut a deal with local agricultural brand, Blue Diamond Growers. All of the patches will appear on the front of the jerseys."
General Electric,2017-1,"The Celtics' deal with GE covers the three years of the pilot program. Neither team has disclosed the value of the sponsorship, but media outlets ESPN and Sports Business Journal have reported the deals are going for roughly $5 million for each season."
General Electric,2017-1,"Teams are responsible for selling their own sponsorship patches, which will be only 2.5 inches by 2.5 inches in size, much smaller than the kind used by European soccer clubs."
General Electric,2017-1,"The sponsorship patch will not appear on the retail versions of the jerseys, though teams are permitted to sell sponsored-patch jerseys in their arena-owned retail outlets."

General Electric,2017-1,{{20170125T163014.493+0000}}UPDATE 1-Siemens to pick banks for blockbuster Healthineers listing - sources* Siemens to invite banks to pitch in April - sources
General Electric,2017-1,"FRANKFURT, Jan 24 (Reuters) - German industrial group Siemens will shortly start picking banks to organise a stock market listing of its healthcare business, which could be valued at up to 37 billion euros ($40 billion) including debt, three people close to the matter said."
General Electric,2017-1,"Siemens will invite investment banks in early April to pitch for roles in the initial public offering (IPO), which could be the biggest since the flotation of German energy group Innogy in October, the people said."
General Electric,2017-1,They said that Goldman Sachs had already been asked to look after some preparatory tasks for the IPO.
General Electric,2017-1,"""Goldman Sachs will very likely emerge as one of the global coordinators of the Healthineers IPO,"" one of the sources said, adding that Healthineers would be listed in late 2017 provided equity markets were favourable."
General Electric,2017-1,"Analysts estimate the business, Siemens's most profitable, has an enterprise value of around 36 to 37 billion euros."
General Electric,2017-1,"Barclays Capital, which rates Siemens ""equal weight"", estimates that that represents around 15 times 2018 earnings before interest, tax and amortisation (EBITA), compared with 10.4 times for the trains-to-turbines group as a whole."
General Electric,2017-1,"""This is quite a high multiple factoring the strong cash generation and stable margin. However, top line growth has been muted and there are some headwinds ahead in both the U.S. and China, in our view,"" Barclays analyst James Stettler said."
General Electric,2017-1,"Comparison with peers is difficult as they are divisions of conglomerates General Electric , Philips and Toshiba <6502.T>."
General Electric,2017-1,"Potential investors in the IPO may compare Healthineers to Baxter , Boston Scientific , Ambu and Dentsply Sirona - which trade at 17 to 30 times their core earnings - when making their decisions on how much they are willing to pay."
General Electric,2017-1,"The IPO of a minority stake in Healthineers would give Siemens a currency for organic or inorganic investment in the business, which is a market leader in diagnostic imaging but needs to adapt fast to boost its exposure to growth segments."
General Electric,2017-1,"These include molecular diagnostics, which involves analysing patients' genetic make-up to help doctors with diagnosis, prognosis and treatment options, as well as advanced therapies and bespoke hospital services."
General Electric,2017-1,"This will not be cheap. U.S. medical technology group Danaher in November bought fast-growing but loss-making Californian molecular diagnostics market leader Cepheid for $4 billion including debt, or just over six times sales, at a premium of 54 percent. [nL3N1BI3DQ]"
General Electric,2017-1,"""This (flotation) is the best option and the logical next step to provide flexible access to the capital markets and further strengthen the Healthineers business in the future,"" Siemens Chief Executive Joe Kaeser told investors on a call in November."
General Electric,2017-1,Analysts say GenMark Diagnostics and Oxford Immunotec Global are future logical takeover targets in the sector.
General Electric,2017-1,"Siemens is now developing a next-generation lab diagnostics system, named Atellica, designed to leapfrog competitors such as Roche and Abbott , but the move is expected to dilute profit margins for around two years."
General Electric,2017-1,"Last month, Siemens announced a $300 million investment and 700 new jobs at its Walpole, Massachusetts laboratory diagnostics manufacturing facility over the next four years to manufacture assays for Atellica. [nFWN1E90D5]"
General Electric,2017-1,Analysts say Healthineers - which accounts for about 30 percent of divisional sales - has underperformed both its peers and expectations since Siemens created it in the last decade.
General Electric,2017-1,"It posted sales of 13.5 billion euros in the fiscal year to end-September, an increase of 5 percent. It had an EBIT margin of 17.2 percent, an improvement on the previous year's 16.9 percent and the highest of any Siemens business."

General Electric,2017-1,{{20170120T084306.506+0000}}INTERVIEW-Production problems were a factor in Zodiac agreeing to takeover-shareholderBy Gilles Guillaume
General Electric,2017-1,"PARIS, Jan 20 (Reuters) - Recent production problems at Zodiac Aerospace partially influenced the French seatmaker's decision to agree to be taken over by aero engines group Safran , a leading Zodiac shareholder said."
General Electric,2017-1,"A cash pile left by Safran's decision last year to sell its security business also facilitated the 9.7 billion-euro ($10.4 billion) deal, reached more than six years after Zodiac's core shareholders spurned a previous approach by Safran. [nL5N1F90RB]"
General Electric,2017-1,"""What has changed (since 2010) is the pursuit of growth by both companies (and) the fact that Safran sold Morpho and had the means to fund an acquisition strategy,"" Robert Peugeot, head of the French carmaking dynasty's holding company, told Reuters."
General Electric,2017-1,"""On the Zodiac side, the industrial difficulties it has faced, and which much of the industry is facing, meant that the idea of adopting an industrial logic based on being part of a larger entity seemed to us like a good idea."""
General Electric,2017-1,"Zodiac is emerging from a production crisis at its seat plants. It is controlled by a group of families including the Peugeot investment vehicle, FFP, which owns 5.2 percent."
General Electric,2017-1,"In a two-part deal announced on Thursday, Safran will make a cash offer valuing Zodiac at 8.5 billion euros."
General Electric,2017-1,That will be followed by a merger in which core family shareholders will tender their shares in exchange for a stake in the enlarged group. Safran shareholders will also receive a special dividend.
General Electric,2017-1,Analysts valued the overall cash and paper transaction at 9.7 billion euros.
General Electric,2017-1,"Peugeot defended the decision, criticised by some analysts, not to seek other bids."
General Electric,2017-1,"""The success of this operation also depends on the capacity of teams to understand each other and work together. There is a proximity between the companies that will certainly facilitate synergies and integration into one company,"" he said."
General Electric,2017-1,"The French government, which owns 14 percent of Safran, was also involved in the merger discussions, Peugeot said. French President Francois Hollande welcomed the deal to create the world's third largest aerospace industry supplier behind United Technologies (UTC) and General Electric ."
General Electric,2017-1,"""It is a French champion in a global sector that is developing and will probably continue to do so for quite a few years,"" Peugeot said."
General Electric,2017-1,"The merger, he said, also reflected a shift towards car industry methods as planemakers gear up for the higher production volumes needed to deliver on a boom in orders."
General Electric,2017-1,"""It is clear that aerospace is moving towards a modus operandi closer to automobiles, where the large manufacturers like to have large suppliers covering the world and capable of efficiently managing their industrial processes."""

General Electric,2017-1,"WASHINGTON/NEW YORK, Jan 19 (Reuters) - David Nason, a General Electric executive and former Treasury Department official, is the front runner to become the Federal Reserve's top Wall Street regulator under President-elect Donald Trump, sources familiar with the screening said on Thursday."
General Electric,2017-1,"Nason leads GE's Energy Financial Services division, which funds worldwide energy development, mostly from thermal and renewable sources."
General Electric,2017-1,"In 2008, Nason was a deputy to Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson as U.S. regulators tried to stabilize Wall Street and prevent an economic meltdown after the housing market collapsed."
General Electric,2017-1,Trump will have a chance to nominate the Fed's vice chair for supervision - a role conceived in the wake of the financial collapse to watchdog Wall Street.
General Electric,2017-1,"If Nason is tapped for the role, he would be the most senior rule-writer for Wall Street with a large say in how leading banks are supervised day to day."
General Electric,2017-1,"In recent weeks, other names have been floated as vice chair candidates who can boast support from Wall Street."
General Electric,2017-1,"Representative French Hill, an Arkansas Republican and former banker, has been favored by some in the banking industry while some Washington lobbyists have favored Paul Atkins, a former commissioner with the Securities and Exchange Commission."
General Electric,2017-1,"While no final decision has been made on who should fill the job, Nason has Paulson's backing and has become the front runner in recent weeks, the sources said."
General Electric,2017-1,"In the last several weeks, Nason has met with Trump's senior economic advisers Gary Cohn and Steve Mnuchin, according to one source familiar with the meetings."
General Electric,2017-1,Trump has named Cohn as head of the White House National Economic Council and nominated Mnuchin as Treasury secretary.
General Electric,2017-1,"Both Cohn and Mnuchin held senior roles at Goldman Sachs , and they have heard directly from Paulson, the company's former chief executive, that Nason is a solid pick, according to another source familiar with the screening."
General Electric,2017-1,Nason did not immediately respond to a call for comment. A spokesman for Paulson declined to comment.
General Electric,2017-1,"In Paulson's memoir, ""On the Brink,"" the former cabinet secretary singles Nason out for praise during the financial crisis."

General Electric,2017-1,"LONDON, Jan 20 (Reuters) - Britain spent 168 million pounds ($207 million) on two failed initiatives to help to fund carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology, a parliamentary watchdog said on Friday."
General Electric,2017-1,"CCS involves the capture of emissions from power plants and industry to allow them to be stored underground and had been viewed by the British government as a vital to help it to meet emissions targets, but two competitions held over the past ten years have failed to produce a commercial-scale project."
General Electric,2017-1,"A report by the National Audit Office (NAO), focusing on the second competition, said that the 100 million pounds spent had not provided value for money."
General Electric,2017-1,"""Taxpayers will be alarmed that disagreement between departments means the taxpayers have little to show for the 100 million pounds the government spent,"" Meg Hillier, Chair of the Committee of Public Accounts, said in statement with the report."
General Electric,2017-1,"The first competition, which cost 68 million pounds, collapsed in 2011 when a consortium including National Grid and Iberdrola's Scottish Power pulled out."
General Electric,2017-1,The second competition's demise came when the government unexpectedly cancelled its funding in 2015. [nL8N13K4AR]
General Electric,2017-1,"The NAO said that the Department for Energy and Climate Change (DECC) -- which has since become part of the new Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) -- began the second CCS competition without agreeing on costs with Britain's finance ministry."
General Electric,2017-1,"The cancellation halted development of the two major projects involved, being developed by companies including SSE , Shell , GE and BOC, part of the Linde Group ."
General Electric,2017-1,"""The government will have to work hard to restore investor confidence in carbon capture and storage, or come up with cost-effective alternatives to meet the UK's decarbonisation target,"" Hillier said."
General Electric,2017-1,In 2015 the DECC said that meeting the country's 2050 carbon dioxide reduction target would cost 30 billion pounds without deployment of CCS in the power sector.
General Electric,2017-1,"""The Department (BEIS) must learn lessons from this experience if it is to stand any chance of ensuring the first CCS plants are built in the near future,"" said Amyas Morse, head of the NAO."
General Electric,2017-1,Britain has a legally binding target to cut emissions by 80 percent from 1990 levels by 2050.

General Electric,2017-1,"The move marks a small step forward in the Australian energy industry's push to expand in renewables, while still depending heavily on coal-fired plants, as the country races to meet its global commitment to cut carbon emissions."
General Electric,2017-1,"Lining up finance for large-scale renewable energy projects has been an obstacle, with banks reluctant to back proposals due to uncertainty over Australia's energy policies and climate-change commitments amid a string of leadership changes in Canberra."

General Electric,2017-1,"Once complete in 2018, the Silverton wind farm will generate about a fifth of the fund's target of 1,000 megawatts of renewable energy, or 4 percent of the energy needed to meet the Australian government's renewables target for 2020, AGL said."
General Electric,2017-1,"It said the facility, which would be Australia's sixth largest wind farm, will effectively cut the company's carbon emissions by 655,000 tonnes a year, the equivalent of taking 192,000 cars off the road."
General Electric,2017-1,"AGL plans to exit coal-fired generation only by 2050, while expanding in wind and solar power, but is quitting the coal-seam gas business as low oil prices and community opposition have hurt the economics of its projects."

General Electric,2017-1,{{20170120T084306.506+0000}}INTERVIEW-Production problems were a factor in Zodiac agreeing to takeover-shareholderBy Gilles Guillaume
General Electric,2017-1,"PARIS, Jan 20 (Reuters) - Recent production problems at Zodiac Aerospace partially influenced the French seatmaker's decision to agree to be taken over by aero engines group Safran , a leading Zodiac shareholder said."
General Electric,2017-1,"A cash pile left by Safran's decision last year to sell its security business also facilitated the 9.7 billion-euro ($10.4 billion) deal, reached more than six years after Zodiac's core shareholders spurned a previous approach by Safran. [nL5N1F90RB]"
General Electric,2017-1,"""What has changed (since 2010) is the pursuit of growth by both companies (and) the fact that Safran sold Morpho and had the means to fund an acquisition strategy,"" Robert Peugeot, head of the French carmaking dynasty's holding company, told Reuters."
General Electric,2017-1,"""On the Zodiac side, the industrial difficulties it has faced, and which much of the industry is facing, meant that the idea of adopting an industrial logic based on being part of a larger entity seemed to us like a good idea."""
General Electric,2017-1,"Zodiac is emerging from a production crisis at its seat plants. It is controlled by a group of families including the Peugeot investment vehicle, FFP, which owns 5.2 percent."
General Electric,2017-1,"In a two-part deal announced on Thursday, Safran will make a cash offer valuing Zodiac at 8.5 billion euros."
General Electric,2017-1,That will be followed by a merger in which core family shareholders will tender their shares in exchange for a stake in the enlarged group. Safran shareholders will also receive a special dividend.
General Electric,2017-1,Analysts valued the overall cash and paper transaction at 9.7 billion euros.
General Electric,2017-1,"Peugeot defended the decision, criticised by some analysts, not to seek other bids."
General Electric,2017-1,"""The success of this operation also depends on the capacity of teams to understand each other and work together. There is a proximity between the companies that will certainly facilitate synergies and integration into one company,"" he said."
General Electric,2017-1,"The French government, which owns 14 percent of Safran, was also involved in the merger discussions, Peugeot said. French President Francois Hollande welcomed the deal to create the world's third largest aerospace industry supplier behind United Technologies (UTC) and General Electric ."
General Electric,2017-1,"""It is a French champion in a global sector that is developing and will probably continue to do so for quite a few years,"" Peugeot said."
General Electric,2017-1,"The merger, he said, also reflected a shift towards car industry methods as planemakers gear up for the higher production volumes needed to deliver on a boom in orders."
General Electric,2017-1,"""It is clear that aerospace is moving towards a modus operandi closer to automobiles, where the large manufacturers like to have large suppliers covering the world and capable of efficiently managing their industrial processes."""

General Electric,2017-1,"{{20170120T022617.132+0000}}Nason, former Treasury official, being vetted for Fed role -sourcesBy Patrick Rucker and Olivia Oran"
General Electric,2017-1,"WASHINGTON/NEW YORK, Jan 19 (Reuters) - David Nason, a General Electric executive and former Treasury Department official, is the front runner to become the Federal Reserve's top Wall Street regulator under President-elect Donald Trump, sources familiar with the screening said on Thursday."
General Electric,2017-1,"Nason leads GE's Energy Financial Services division, which funds worldwide energy development, mostly from thermal and renewable sources."
General Electric,2017-1,"In 2008, Nason was a deputy to Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson as U.S. regulators tried to stabilize Wall Street and prevent an economic meltdown after the housing market collapsed."
General Electric,2017-1,Trump will have a chance to nominate the Fed's vice chair for supervision - a role conceived in the wake of the financial collapse to watchdog Wall Street.
General Electric,2017-1,"If Nason is tapped for the role, he would be the most senior rule-writer for Wall Street with a large say in how leading banks are supervised day to day."
General Electric,2017-1,"In recent weeks, other names have been floated as vice chair candidates who can boast support from Wall Street."
General Electric,2017-1,"Representative French Hill, an Arkansas Republican and former banker, has been favored by some in the banking industry while some Washington lobbyists have favored Paul Atkins, a former commissioner with the Securities and Exchange Commission."
General Electric,2017-1,"While no final decision has been made on who should fill the job, Nason has Paulson's backing and has become the front runner in recent weeks, the sources said."
General Electric,2017-1,"In the last several weeks, Nason has met with Trump's senior economic advisers Gary Cohn and Steve Mnuchin, according to one source familiar with the meetings."
General Electric,2017-1,Trump has named Cohn as head of the White House National Economic Council and nominated Mnuchin as Treasury secretary.
General Electric,2017-1,"Both Cohn and Mnuchin held senior roles at Goldman Sachs , and they have heard directly from Paulson, the company's former chief executive, that Nason is a solid pick, according to another source familiar with the screening."
General Electric,2017-1,Nason did not immediately respond to a call for comment. A spokesman for Paulson declined to comment.
General Electric,2017-1,"In Paulson's memoir, ""On the Brink,"" the former cabinet secretary singles Nason out for praise during the financial crisis."

General Electric,2017-1,{{20170120T000101.394+0000}}UK spent $207 mln on failed carbon capture initiatives -watchdog* CCS technology deemed crucial to meet climate targets
General Electric,2017-1,"LONDON, Jan 20 (Reuters) - Britain spent 168 million pounds ($207 million) on two failed initiatives to help to fund carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology, a parliamentary watchdog said on Friday."
General Electric,2017-1,"CCS involves the capture of emissions from power plants and industry to allow them to be stored underground and had been viewed by the British government as a vital to help it to meet emissions targets, but two competitions held over the past ten years have failed to produce a commercial-scale project."
General Electric,2017-1,"A report by the National Audit Office (NAO), focusing on the second competition, said that the 100 million pounds spent had not provided value for money."
General Electric,2017-1,"""Taxpayers will be alarmed that disagreement between departments means the taxpayers have little to show for the 100 million pounds the government spent,"" Meg Hillier, Chair of the Committee of Public Accounts, said in statement with the report."
General Electric,2017-1,"The first competition, which cost 68 million pounds, collapsed in 2011 when a consortium including National Grid and Iberdrola's Scottish Power pulled out."
General Electric,2017-1,The second competition's demise came when the government unexpectedly cancelled its funding in 2015. [nL8N13K4AR]
General Electric,2017-1,"The NAO said that the Department for Energy and Climate Change (DECC) -- which has since become part of the new Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) -- began the second CCS competition without agreeing on costs with Britain's finance ministry."
General Electric,2017-1,"The cancellation halted development of the two major projects involved, being developed by companies including SSE , Shell , GE and BOC, part of the Linde Group ."
General Electric,2017-1,"""The government will have to work hard to restore investor confidence in carbon capture and storage, or come up with cost-effective alternatives to meet the UK's decarbonisation target,"" Hillier said."
General Electric,2017-1,In 2015 the DECC said that meeting the country's 2050 carbon dioxide reduction target would cost 30 billion pounds without deployment of CCS in the power sector.
General Electric,2017-1,"""The Department (BEIS) must learn lessons from this experience if it is to stand any chance of ensuring the first CCS plants are built in the near future,"" said Amyas Morse, head of the NAO."
General Electric,2017-1,Britain has a legally binding target to cut emissions by 80 percent from 1990 levels by 2050.

General Electric,2017-1,"The move marks a small step forward in the Australian energy industry's push to expand in renewables, while still depending heavily on coal-fired plants, as the country races to meet its global commitment to cut carbon emissions."
General Electric,2017-1,"Lining up finance for large-scale renewable energy projects has been an obstacle, with banks reluctant to back proposals due to uncertainty over Australia's energy policies and climate-change commitments amid a string of leadership changes in Canberra."
General Electric,2017-1,"AGL, the country's biggest carbon emitter, set up the $1 billion Powering Australian Renewables Fund (PARF) last year, with 80 percent of the equity provided by Australia's sovereign wealth fund, the Future Fund, and Queensland state's QIC."

General Electric,2017-1,"PARIS, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Qatar Airways said on Thursday it was seeking guarantees from a potential new engine supplier after delays to Airbus jet deliveries, but said Boeing was ahead of schedule on its latest version of the 777, leaving scope to bring those jets forward."
General Electric,2017-1,The comments from one of the industry's toughest buyers reflect the stakes involved in meeting manufacturing targets for large aerospace industry orders after a series of costly delays.
General Electric,2017-1,"Qatar Airways remains in talks with CFM International about supplying engines for an upgraded order for Airbus Group's A321neo medium-haul jets, which it expects to finalise ""soon"", Chief Executive Akbar Al Baker told Reuters."
General Electric,2017-1,"The carrier has cancelled four A320neo jets powered by delayed engines made by Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies , and plans to swap the overall aircraft order, which originally covered 50 jets, to the larger A321neo."
General Electric,2017-1,"CFM, owned by General Electric and France's Safran , competes with Pratt & Whitney to power Airbus' medium-haul jets."
General Electric,2017-1,"Al Baker acknowledged Qatar had received competitive launch prices when it originally ordered Pratt & Whitney engines, but said a decision on whether to keep those or switch to CFM for the upgraded A321neo order would depend on other guarantees."
General Electric,2017-1,"""It is a factor, but what we decide will be based on what sort of guarantees we get on deliveries and at the same time performance,"" he said in an interview."
General Electric,2017-1,"Qatar plans to take delivery of around 10 Airbus A350s and 6 Boeing 777s this year. It will also receive some Boeing 737s on behalf of Italy's Meridiana, in which it aims to buy 49 percent."
General Electric,2017-1,"Qatar is also one of the launch customers for the newest Boeing long-haul jet, the 777-9, formerly code-named 777-9X."
General Electric,2017-1,"Boeing plans to deliver the 406-seat jet from 2020, but aviation news site FlightGlobal reported last year it could advance deliveries to late 2019 due to spare cushion in the development schedule."
General Electric,2017-1,"""We have already told Boeing that as they are bringing ahead the (777-)9X deliveries, we would be interested. The 777-9X programme is ahead of schedule and we have no problem if they want to bring our deliveries ahead,"" Al Baker said."
General Electric,2017-1,"A Boeing spokesman said: ""Development of the 777X programme is progressing to plan and we will deliver to the schedule we committed to our airline customers."""
General Electric,2017-1,"Al Baker was speaking after opening a 1,000-square-metre lounge at Paris' Charles de Gaulle Airport, the airline's third such facility abroad after London Heathrow and Dubai."
General Electric,2017-1,It is also building lounges in Beirut and Bangkok and negotiating space in seven other airports.
General Electric,2017-1,The expansion comes as Gulf airlines have seen premium yields suffering due to low oil prices and rising capacity.
General Electric,2017-1,"Qatar Airways plans to unveil a new premium cabin in March and is investing an unspecified amount to attract passengers ""with the right yield,"" Al Baker said."
General Electric,2017-1,But he suggested fuel surcharges may soon be back on the agenda.
General Electric,2017-1,"""(Qatar Airways) had to lower (prices in 2016) because oil prices were going down, but now we are starting to put prices up because oil prices are starting to go up,"" he said."
General Electric,2017-1,"""Soon, I think not only Qatar Airways but most of the airlines will re-introduce the fuel surcharges because they budgeted on lower fuel price and prices are now rising rapidly."""

General Electric,2017-1,{{20170112T133943.750+0000}}INTERVIEW-Qatar Airways seeks engine guarantees for revamped Airbus order(Adds details)
General Electric,2017-1,"PARIS, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Qatar Airways is seeking strict guarantees as it talks to CFM International about supplying engines for a revamped order for Airbus narrow-body jets, which it expects to finalise ""soon"", its chief executive said on Thursday."
General Electric,2017-1,"The Gulf airline has cancelled four A320neo jets powered by alternative Pratt & Whitney engines and expects to swap the overall aircraft order, which was originally for 50 jets, to larger A321neo aircraft."
General Electric,2017-1,"CFM, a joint venture of General Electric and France's Safran , is locked in a fierce battle with Pratt & Whitney to supply engines for new Airbus medium-haul jets."
General Electric,2017-1,"CFM exclusively supplies engines for the competing Boeing 737 aircraft, which Qatar Airways has also ordered."
General Electric,2017-1,"Chief Executive Akbar Al Baker acknowledged Qatar Airways had received attractive prices when it originally ordered the new Pratt & Whitney engine, but said a decision on whether to keep those or switch to CFM for the upgraded A321neo order would depend on other guarantees."
General Electric,2017-1,"""It is a factor, but what we decide will be based on what sort of guarantees we get on deliveries and at the same time performance,"" he told Reuters in an interview."
General Electric,2017-1,"Qatar plans to take delivery of around 10 Airbus A350s and 6 Boeing 777s this year. It will also receive some Boeing 737s on behalf of Italy's Meridiana, where it hopes to tie up a deal to take a 49-percent stake around the end of the month."
General Electric,2017-1,"It has told Boeing it is interested in taking earlier delivery of future 777-9 aircraft, because that programme is ahead of schedule, Al Baker added."
General Electric,2017-1,"Asked if Qatar Airways could take on delivery of aircraft for airlines in which it has stakes, like BA owner IAG and Latam, he said ""why not,"" but added he believed those airlines would take their planes as planned."
General Electric,2017-1,"He was speaking after opening a 1,000-square-metre business lounge at Paris' Charles de Gaulle airport, the airline's third premium lounge abroad after London Heathrow and Dubai."
General Electric,2017-1,"It is building further lounges in Beirut and Bangkok and is negotiating lounge space in seven other airports, he said."
General Electric,2017-1,The expansion comes as Gulf airlines have seen premium yields suffering due to low oil prices and rising capacity.
General Electric,2017-1,"Qatar Airways, which also plans to launch a new premium cabin at a trade fair in March, is investing an unspecified amount in new product to attract passengers ""with the right yield"" or average revenues, Al Baker said."
General Electric,2017-1,But he suggested fuel surcharges may soon be back on the agenda because of a recent rebound in oil prices.
General Electric,2017-1,"""(Qatar Airways) had to lower (prices in 2016) because oil prices were going down, but now we are starting to put prices up because oil prices are starting to go up,"" he said."
General Electric,2017-1,"""Soon, I think not only Qatar Airways but most of the airlines will re-introduce the fuel surcharges because they budgeted on lower fuel price and prices are now rising rapidly."""
General Electric,2017-1,Oil prices have risen 20 percent in the last three months.
General Electric,2017-1,Al Baker said the airline had not seen traffic to France fall after recent attacks. It plans to serve Nice five times a week from July and announce a similar service to Lyon soon.
General Electric,2017-1,"It continues to experience double-digit growth in passenger numbers, Al Baker added."

General Electric,2017-1,{{20170110T210140.800+0000}}Alstom beats GE in dispute over $800 mln train signal contractBy Jonathan Stempel
General Electric,2017-1,"NEW YORK, Jan 10 (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Tuesday said Alstom SA may ask an independent accounting firm to resolve a dispute over the French company's $800 million purchase of General Electric Co's train-signaling business, and rejected GE's bid for arbitration."
General Electric,2017-1,"U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman in Manhattan said the ""plain language"" of the November 2014 sales contract justified letting Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu handle the matter first, rather than arbitrators from the International Chamber of Commerce."
General Electric,2017-1,"Furman nonetheless said his decision was not a ""back door"" through which Deloitte could resolve non-accounting matters."
General Electric,2017-1,"He said that while GE conceded that Deloitte should decide some issues, it remained free to argue that other issues should be arbitrated."
General Electric,2017-1,"Alstom had sued GE last May, accusing the Boston-based conglomerate of breach of contract for refusing to let Deloitte decide whether the purchase price should be adjusted up or down to account for working capital and net debt."
General Electric,2017-1,"In court papers GE had accused Alstom of avoiding arbitration in an attempt to ""second-guess"" its business decisions, and obtain an ""after-the-fact discount."""
General Electric,2017-1,"The train-signaling transaction closed in November 2015, on the same day that GE bought Alstom's energy business for an adjusted 9.7 billion euros ($10.2 billion)."
General Electric,2017-1,"GE has been repositioning itself around industrial units such as energy and aviation, while turning away from other businesses including finance and home appliances."

General Electric,2017-1,The Doha-based carrier has refused to take delivery of A320neos since December 2015 over performance issues with the aircraft's engines. [nL5N1E71MK]
General Electric,2017-1,"""We are going to take all A321s, there will be no more A320s,"" Chief Executive Akbar al-Baker told reporters in Doha."
General Electric,2017-1,"The airline is also deciding whether to switch the engine order for the narrow-body jets from Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies Corp , to CFM, a joint venture between General Electric Co and Safran SA of France."
General Electric,2017-1,Qatar Airways has refused to accept A320neos powered by Pratt & Whitney engines because they require additional time to start under certain conditions.
General Electric,2017-1,The airline said in May it was cutting frequencies on more than a dozen routes from its Doha hub because of delays in acquiring new aircraft from Airbus.
General Electric,2017-1,"Airbus successfully completed its first test flight for the A321neo in February 2016. However, in December it delayed delivery of its first A321neo to Hawaiian Holdings Inc by three months. [nL2N15O1JL] [nL1N1EF1PL]"
General Electric,2017-1,"Airbus's delivery schedule saw delays through 2016, in part because of problems with engine and cabin parts suppliers."
General Electric,2017-1,"Qatar Airways is also moving closer to taking a 49 percent stake in Italy's Meridiana, which it originally planned to finalise in October 2016. [nL8N1A03ED]"
General Electric,2017-1,"""By the end of the month we should have put all the loose ends together,"" al-Baker said without providing further details."

General Electric,2017-1,"SEATTLE, Jan 4 (Reuters) - Boeing Co said on Wednesday it had booked firm orders for 80 of its 737 MAX 8 aircraft, valued at $8.8 billion at list prices, upping its 2016 tally but leaving it short of its goal."
General Electric,2017-1,"The orders mean the world's biggest plane maker clinched at least 536 net jetliner sales last year compared with its target of selling as many commercial jets as it delivers, a total it puts between 745 and 750. Through November, Boeing had delivered 681 planes."
General Electric,2017-1,"Boeing's order tally could climb again on Friday, as the company posts its final update for 2016."
General Electric,2017-1,"Investors watch orders closely as a way to gauge future production and revenue, since Boeing earns the bulk of its money when aircraft are delivered."
General Electric,2017-1,"The company has orders equivalent to about seven years of production, but the majority are single-aisle 737 planes, and sales of its more expensive widebodies like the 777 remain sluggish."
General Electric,2017-1,"Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg affirmed the company's overall order target in July. In December, he said Boeing would cut 777 output by 40 percent this year due to slow sales of widebody planes. [nL1N1E71NX]"
General Electric,2017-1,"The orders announced Wednesday include 75 Boeing 737 MAX 8s for General Electric Co Capital Aviation Services (GECAS), valued at $8.25 billion at list prices."
General Electric,2017-1,"GE supplies engines for the 737 MAX through CFM International, a joint venture with Safran SA of France. The latest sale means GECAS now has 170 Boeing 737 MAXs on order, more than any other leasing company, Boeing said."
General Electric,2017-1,"The remaining orders, valued at $550 million, came from Travel Service, the largest airline company in the Czech Republic, which operates as SmartWings, Boeing said."
General Electric,2017-1,"Through December 20, Boeing booked 470 net orders in 2016. Since then, it has announced orders for four 737-800s by Jet2.com. On Dec. 27, Delta Air Lines said it was cancelling an order for 18 Boeing 787 Dreamliners. Northwest Airlines placed the order before it merged with Delta. [nL4N1EM3S4]"
General Electric,2017-1,"Tallying the changes, Boeing's book-to-bill ratio is 0.79, below the target of 1.0."
General Electric,2017-1,"A Boeing spokesman declined to comment, citing a quiet period before fourth-quarter earnings on Jan. 25."
General Electric,2017-1,"Boeing has received over 3,400 orders for the 737 MAX. The first 737 MAX is expected to be delivered in the first half of 2017."
General Electric,2017-1,"Boeing's shares were up about 1 percent at $158.46. Up to Tuesday's close, the stock had risen 11.7 percent in the past 12 months, compared with a 12.2 percent rise in the S&P 500 index <.SPX>."

General Electric,2017-1,{{20170104T150709.206+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-Climate change will unclog water's pipes(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.)
General Electric,2017-1,"NEW YORK, Jan 4 (Reuters Breakingviews) - General Electric picked the wrong time to quit the water business. The H2O sector has been growing slower than hoped despite the rising threat to safe and reliable supplies from drought, flooding, and population growth. But battling climate change will unclog the $1 trillion water industry's pipes in 2017."
General Electric,2017-1,"GE's water struggles are instructive. Chief Executive Jeff Immelt, who took the conglomerate into the sector by spending more than $4 billion on acquisitions over a decade ago, expected revenue to hit $10 billion a year by now. It's only around a fifth of that, GE revealed on Dec. 14, with up to $300 million of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization."
General Electric,2017-1,"Immelt's earlier optimism was hardly unusual. Global water demand is likely to increase by 55 percent by the middle of the century, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, as the planet's population swells, the United Nations predicts, by a third to 9.9 billion."
General Electric,2017-1,"Traditionally, such far-sighted forecasting has been of little use to companies, politicians and investors, though. They tend to base decisions on shorter time frames. But that's slowly changing. Long droughts in California, India, parts of Brazil, swaths of Africa and elsewhere have focused attention on scarcity. And dire predictions are looming closer: three-fifths of the world's inhabitants may face water shortages within the next decade."
General Electric,2017-1,"Rickety water infrastructure in the western world also needs repairing or replacing. The UK loses nearly a third of its water to leaky pipes. In the United States, a lead-poisoning scandal in Flint, Michigan, has exposed the cost of decades of underinvestment in water infrastructure."
General Electric,2017-1,"The money spigot is slowly opening. Investment by U.S water authorities is expected to jump by $116 billion over the next decade, a 28 percent increase over the previous 10 years, according to Bluefield Research. Overall, the country's water infrastructure needs $685 billion of investment over the next two decades, reckons the Environmental Protection Agency."
General Electric,2017-1,"Worldwide, up to $20 trillion of new spending could be needed by 2030, the OECD estimates. China alone has set aside $1.5 trillion to address both inadequate systems and wholesale pollution of its groundwater."
General Electric,2017-1,"Companies may also start spending more as water risks have moved from a fringe concern to a boardroom issue in recent years. Few firms have yet to develop a comprehensive water policy, though, according to CDP, a nonprofit that runs environmental-disclosure programs for institutional investors. Such a plan takes into account not just their own operations and their suppliers, but the concerns and needs of other water users where they operate."
General Electric,2017-1,"The Paris climate accord, which took effect in November, could be the extra jolt the sector needs. While water isn't directly mentioned in the pact, an analysis of corporate climate pledges by CDP found that a quarter of plans to cut greenhouse-gas emissions required a stable supply of good quality water. It takes a lot of energy to move water around, so reducing waste can also cut emissions directly."
General Electric,2017-1,"Sometimes, the reduction can be huge. Energy use is so inefficient at wastewater plants that carbon dioxide emissions could be halved using current technology, according to Xylem. In most cases, operators would even save enough on energy bills to quickly cover the cost of the upgrade."
General Electric,2017-1,"And as water becomes scarcer around the world, the need to reuse it will rise. Currently, Israel is the leader, reusing 70 percent of its wastewater. In North America, the figure is less than 4 percent, while in low-income countries only 8 percent of wastewater is even treated, let alone reused."
General Electric,2017-1,That all suggests the time of the great water-revenue deluge is approaching. GE might soon be inundated with seller's remorse.
General Electric,2017-1,"- Gina McCarthy, administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, on Dec. 6 said $685 billion needs to be invested in the country's water infrastructure over the next 20 years."
General Electric,2017-1,"- Water risks for all companies are growing rapidly, according to the annual Global Water Report published by nonprofit climate-disclosure firm CDP on Nov. 15. The report also outlined how businesses are in general not moving quickly enough to manage water sustainably - but also that those that have are often able to dramatically reduce their carbon emissions."
General Electric,2017-1,"- General Electric is in talks to sell GE Water. The conglomerate put the unit on the block when it announced it was merging its power business with Baker Hughes on Oct. 31. GE Water earns between $250 million and $300 million a year before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, according to the company. Based on multiples paid in previous deals, the division could be worth up to $3.3 billion."
