walmart,2017-12,Dec 27 (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc was sued on Wednesday by a transgender woman who said she was wrongfully fired after complaining about harassment at the Sam's Club warehouse store in North Carolina where she had worked for 11 years.
walmart,2017-12,"Charlene Bost, 46, said co-workers at the Kannapolis store where she had been a member service supervisor called her ""sir,"" ""that thing with an attitude"" and ""shim,"" a slur combining ""she"" and ""him."" She also said her male boss subjected her to unwanted physical advances and referred to her as ""it."""
walmart,2017-12,"The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages and improved training to stop harassment of transgender workers at Bentonville, Arkansas-based Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer. Kannapolis is a suburb of Charlotte."
walmart,2017-12,"""Wal-Mart maintains a strong anti-discrimination policy. We support diversity and inclusion in our workforce and do not tolerate discrimination or retaliation of any kind,"" company spokesman Randy Hargrove said. ""We disagree with the claims raised by Ms. Bost. Her termination was for performance reasons. We will respond as appropriate with the court."""
walmart,2017-12,North Carolina has also been home to a long-running debate over when transgender people may use public bathrooms.
walmart,2017-12,Bost sued in the same court weighing the legality of a North Carolina bathroom access law passed in March that critics consider too vague. [nL1N1KC0FA]
walmart,2017-12,"That law replaced a more controversial ""bathroom bill"" that caused some businesses to pull events from the state."
walmart,2017-12,"According to her complaint, Bost began working in the Kannapolis store in March 2004, and began expressing her female identity there in 2008."
walmart,2017-12,"She said she was fired in March 2015 in retaliation for her complaints, or else the perception that she suffered from ""gender dysphoria,"" or distress with the sex she was assigned at birth. Bost had also filed charges with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission."
walmart,2017-12,"Jillian Weiss, executive director of the Transgender Legal Defense and Education Fund Inc in New York, which filed Bost's lawsuit, said employers such as Wal-Mart need to understand that simply having tough anti-discrimination policies is not enough."
walmart,2017-12,"""The difficulty here is that Wal-Mart has a good policy, but when a person like Ms. Bost came forward to say she was having trouble because of the discrimination she faced, its enforcement mechanisms were insufficient,"" Weiss said in an interview. ""Corporations have to enforce compliance with anti-discrimination policies, not merely cite their existence."""

walmart,2017-12,"SEATTLE, Dec 27 (Reuters) - United Parcel Service Inc is on track to return a record number of packages this holiday shipping season, a sign that e-commerce purchases surged to new heights over the past month."
walmart,2017-12,The world's largest package delivery company and rival FedEx Corp get paid by retailers like Amazon.com Inc and Wal-Mart Stores Inc for handling e-commerce deliveries.
walmart,2017-12,"Both have benefited from booming delivery volumes over the past few years, but also have had to invest billions of dollars to upgrade and expand their networks to cope."
walmart,2017-12,"UPS said on Wednesday it handled more than 1 million returns to retailers daily in December, a pace expected to last into early January. It said returns would likely peak at 1.4 million on Jan. 3, which would be a fifth consecutive annual record, up 8 percent from this year."
walmart,2017-12,"The returns follow what could be the strongest holiday shopping season on record for both brick-and-mortar and online retailers, once stores publish sales data.

walmart,2017-12,"FedEx said on Wednesday it experienced another record-breaking peak shipping season, but declined to provide specifics.

walmart,2017-12,"UPS said record-breaking e-commerce sales during Black Friday and Cyber Monday in late November jolted the returns season, with a larger flood of packages going back to retailers even as many gifts sat under Christmas trees."
walmart,2017-12,UPS has worked for years to increase its ability to forecast customer shipping demands to handle major package volume spikes ahead of the holidays. It has also raised shipping rates and added 2018 peak-season surcharges. [nL2N1N026T]
walmart,2017-12,The returns delivered in 2017 are part of the 750 million packages UPS said it expects to deliver globally during the peak shipping season from the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday through New Year's Eve. That is an increase of nearly 40 million over the previous year.

walmart,2017-12,"The holiday shopping season, a crucial period for retailers that can account for up to 40 percent of annual sales, brought record-breaking online and in-store spending this year of more than $800 billion, according to Mastercard Inc's analytics arm. [nL1N1OQ0QC]"

walmart,2017-12,RetailNext and most other analytics firms and industry groups - including Adobe Analytics and the National Retail Federation - are due to publish holiday sales data in January.
walmart,2017-12,Mastercard Inc said on Tuesday that a late-season rally had driven an 18.1 percent rise in online sales. Department store chain Macy's Inc and Target Corp both noted increased activity during that time.

walmart,2017-12,"(Corrects Sept 28, 2016 story to clarify Christo Wiese did not start Pepkor in paragraph 11)"
walmart,2017-12,"CAPE TOWN, Sept 28 (Reuters) - It would be a ""natural development"" for international retail group Steinhoff to take over Shoprite , Africa's biggest supermarket chain, South African tycoon Christo Wiese told Reuters, sending shares in the grocery group surging 4 percent."
walmart,2017-12,"Wiese is the largest shareholder in both Shoprite and Steinhoff, a lower-end furniture, apparel and household goods retailer. Bringing the two together would allow him to add groceries to his sprawling discount empire."
walmart,2017-12,"The merger, if it happens, would also pull together Wiese's retail assets under one roof following Steinhoff's nearly $6 billion acquisition in 2014 of Wiese's budget clothing retailer Pepkor and create a global giant worth at least 400 billion rand ($30 billion)."
walmart,2017-12,"""People will speculate about that,"" he said in a rare interview on Tuesday at his modest offices overlooking factories in the dusty northern Cape Town industrial suburb of Parow."
walmart,2017-12,"""People know that I am 75 years old, and I fortunately have a son who is in business with me, but as a family we are continually looking at consolidating our business interests. So, it would be, in a way, a natural development."""
walmart,2017-12,"Since Steinhoff's Pepkor acquisition, some analysts have wondered if Wiese, along with Shoprite's chief executive Whitey Basson and Steinhoff's Markus Jooste were working on a tie-up."
walmart,2017-12,"Although grocery retailing would be uncharted territory for Steinhoff, one fund manager said the company's propensity to run a decentralised business model would help it pull off any such deal."
walmart,2017-12,"""It will be quite a big step given that the grocery sector is somewhat different to the rest of Steinhoff. However Wiese, Markus Jooste and Whitey Basson have great experience in their respective areas,"" Lentus Asset Management's Nic Norman Smith said. ""If anyone is going make it work, it's these three."""
walmart,2017-12,"Shares in Shoprite, which have been little changed so far this year, jumped 4.3 percent shortly after Reuters reported Wiese's comments before extending gains to trade 4.6 percent higher at 196.69 rand as of 1453 GMT."
walmart,2017-12,"Johannesburg-listed shares in Steinhoff, which is also listed in Frankfurt, added at least 2 percent to gains notched up earlier on news that it would issue shares to fund deals. The stock was up 6.2 percent at 80.70 rand."
walmart,2017-12,"Wiese, who describes himself as a ""realist, pragmatist"", was one of the early executives of budget clothing retailer Pepkor, which was co-founded by his parents in the 1960s in Upington on the southern edges of the Kalahari desert, after spotting an opportunity to bring cheaper clothes to the poor."
walmart,2017-12,"He then transformed Shoprite from a six-store company in the 1970s to one with hundreds of stores across Africa, from South Africa to the Democratic Republic of Congo, dwarfing rivals including Wal-Mart's South African unit Massmart ."
walmart,2017-12,"His discount strategy, which also now includes investments in clothes retailer New Look, has catapulted him to the cover of Forbes magazine as one of Africa's richest businessmen."
walmart,2017-12,"""Why is it so successful? ... The people who earn a lot of money are a small portion and then at the base is where your mass market is, where people have limited disposable income and we're aiming at that market,"" he said."
walmart,2017-12,"Wiese studied law in Stellenbosch, a close-knit town dominated by Afrikaans-speaking whites, but lives in Clifton, an area of Cape Town overlooking the Atlantic Ocean with some of South Africa's most expensive properties."
walmart,2017-12,"He owns a high-end vineyard near Stellenbosch, an area dotted with executive golf clubs, but said he ""finds playing golf boring."""
walmart,2017-12,"Wiese is also a top shareholder and board member in South African investment heavyweight Brait SE , which last year bought gym chain Virgin Active, a relative outlier in his business model as it targets middle-class consumers."
walmart,2017-12,"More in line with the low-cost theme, was Brait's purchase of no-frills retailer New Look."
walmart,2017-12,"Wiese said Brait's ""most obvious"" growth trajectory was through its existing businesses that also include U.K. supermarket chain Iceland Foods and South African staples foods maker Premier."
walmart,2017-12,"""There is plenty of scope (to grow). It's got a strong management team and the biggest scope lies within the existing businesses. New Look for instance, our clothing retail operation in the UK, has identified China as a major growth area,"" he said."
walmart,2017-12,"Wiese said New Look was looking to open 500 stores within three years in China, where it already runs 90 outlets."
walmart,2017-12,"""China is an enormous market,"" Wiese said, describing the New Look's store expansion plan as a ""drop in the ocean"" given the size of the Chinese population."
walmart,2017-12,"Virgin Active, which has taken top spot market in Italy and its biggest chain is located in South Africa, has identified Asia-Pacific as the next growth market thanks to a growing population of health-conscious consumers, he said."
walmart,2017-12,Wiese was optimistic for the outlook for Europe despite gloomy economic forecasts but was cautious about the idea of snapping up cheaper assets in Britain following its June vote to leave the European Union.
walmart,2017-12,"""Undoubtedly it does offer opportunities but there are greater risks because none of us know how it (Brexit) is going to play out,"" he said. ""There are studies that show that by 2040, Britain will have a bigger economy than Germany and a population of over 80 million people, that's a market you can't ignore."""
walmart,2017-12,"In South Africa, several businessmen, including the outspoken chief executive of gold miner Sibanye has called for President Jacob Zuma to resign after a series of scandals."
walmart,2017-12,"Wiese said as a businessmen rather than a politician, he would like to stay out of politics."
walmart,2017-12,"However, he said that the country's leadership was hurting Africa's most industrialised economy, which is expected to grow below 1 percent this year. ""The top leadership in the government is seen as a problem. It is not helping our economy. That is a fact of life,"" he said."
walmart,2017-12,But Wiese also dismissed suggestions by some analysts that he was looking to preserve his wealth by moving assets abroad during the political turbulence that has also drawn in Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan.
walmart,2017-12,"On the contrary, he said he expected business to continue to expand, including its interests in South Africa, with Virgin Active for example having its head office in London but earning more than 60 percent of its EBITDA, or core profit, in South Africa."
walmart,2017-12,"""There is no bias to disinvest - in fact the very opposite,"" he said."

walmart,2017-12,"In Wallkill, Toys ""R"" Us hired new employees like Nora Hanlon to oversee the store's Play Lab, which is a cordoned off foam mat, scattered with toys and a picnic table nearby where parents can sit. Boxes marked for layaway surround it."
walmart,2017-12,"""I get minimum wage, but it's a really fun job,"" said Hanlon, a high school student and part-time Play Lab Coach, sporting a reindeer headpiece."
walmart,2017-12,"Toys ""R"" Us also plans to hire more skilled workers. About $72 million of the $400 million the retailer will use for its redevelopment will go toward wage increases."
walmart,2017-12,"The chain's efforts to emulate features of independent stores underscores the dramatic reversal of its fortunes. As the chain grew its national footprint, it wiped out mom-and-pop shops decades ago. But its glitzy Fao Schwarz store and flagship Times Square location featuring a Ferris Wheel were too pricey."
walmart,2017-12,"Earlier efforts with experiential stores called ""Geoffrey,"" named after its giraffe mascot, failed. Its $6.6 billion leveraged buyout in 2005 led to expensive interest payments that ate up cash Toys ""R"" Us could have used to improve stores."
walmart,2017-12,"""Can they somehow turn their stores from a warehouse into a play area?"" said retail consultant Howard Davidowitz. ""That is a big jump."""

walmart,2017-12,"CHICAGO/NEW YORK Dec 20 (Reuters) - More U.S. online shoppers plan to give Amazon.com Inc the bulk of their holiday business this year than in previous years, according to a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll, despite costly efforts by traditional retailers to attract customers to their websites."
walmart,2017-12,"The online poll of 2,644 adults, released on Wednesday, found that 60 percent of online shoppers planned to do most of their holiday buying on Amazon.com, up from 50 percent during the same period in 2015. Meanwhile, the proportion of shoppers who said they expected to do most of their shopping at Walmart.com, Target.com and Macys.com declined by about 1 percentage point each in that period."
walmart,2017-12,"Consumers opting increasingly for convenience and speedy delivery have already pushed online sales this holiday season to record highs, making it all the more crucial that retailers get their digital businesses into gear."
walmart,2017-12,"Wal-Mart Stores Inc , Target Corp and Macy's Inc , like many of their peers, have invested in deeper online discounts and free shipping this holiday season, potentially hurting fourth-quarter profit margins to win back customers who have turned increasingly to Amazon.com."
walmart,2017-12,"Retailers have also invested heavily in sprucing up their websites and mobile device apps. They are rolling out more fulfillment options such as curbside pickup, click-and-collect and same-day delivery. The holiday shopping season can account for 20 to 40 percent of annual sales for many retailers."
walmart,2017-12,"Anand Raghuraman, EY's Americas leader for consumer products and retail strategy, said traditional retailers' online sales were growing, but not fast enough to win market share."
walmart,2017-12,"""They're dealing with an 800-pound gorilla that has different metrics around profitability than they do, which is tough to compete with,"" said Raghuraman."
walmart,2017-12,"Earnest Research, which looks at anonymous card transactions made by millions of U.S. shoppers, said data from the two weeks after Thanksgiving showed Amazon's market share of U.S. sales had risen 2.6 percent from the same period last year."
walmart,2017-12,"Meanwhile Walmart's in-store and online market share for the period was down 1.7 percent, while Target had lost 0.6 percent and Macy's was down 0.5 percent, according to Earnest."
walmart,2017-12,"Target expects fourth-quarter digital growth to once again be among the best in the industry, spokesman Joshua Thomas said. Macy's spokeswoman Radina Russell said the department store chain had begun the holiday season well and would continue to offer value online and in stores."
walmart,2017-12,"To be sure, analytics firms and industry groups expect most traditional retailers to report higher holiday sales this year, both online and in stores, driven by discounting, low unemployment, rising consumer confidence and good weather across the country."
walmart,2017-12,Sales on Thanksgiving and Black Friday also topped prior years and Amazon.com said it broke sales records during that holiday weekend.
walmart,2017-12,"According to the Reuters/Ipsos poll, about one in every four adults plan to shop primarily or entirely online this holiday season, up from one in five in 2012. Convenience, delivery and the ability to compare prices easily were the most common reasons people choose to shop online, the poll showed."
walmart,2017-12,"The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted in English throughout the United States from Nov. 27 to Dec. 7. Because it is an online poll, the respondents may be more experienced with computers and online shopping than the general public. The poll has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 2 percentage points."

walmart,2017-12,(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.)
walmart,2017-12,"HONG KONG, Dec 15 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Sometimes the solution to a problem can be right in the mirror. The family behind Li & Fung <0494.HK> is counting on it. The Hong Kong supply-chain conglomerate, which helps retailers like Walmart stock their shelves, is selling its struggling sweaters, furniture and beauty products divisions for $1.1 billion to a group led by the Fung clan itself."
walmart,2017-12,"Li & Fung, which started exporting porcelain and fireworks from Guangzhou to the United States back in 1906, has found its middle-man role under increasing threat from the likes of Alibaba . Consumers nowadays can be connected directly to manufacturers across China and beyond. Part of Li & Fung's response has been to embark on a three-year plan to digitize its business by using predictive analytics and also to make everything faster by 2019."
walmart,2017-12,"The company has been offloading businesses, too. The products whose divestiture was announced on Thursday have weighed the group down. The Li & Fung division that houses them, which accounts for about a fifth of group sales, suffered a 29 percent decline in core operating profit in the first half of the year. The deal will lead to a $610 million loss because of related writedowns, but it will also provide the company with some financial firepower as it implements its strategic plan."
walmart,2017-12,"Nearly half the proceeds have, however, been promised to Li & Fung shareholders as a special dividend. About $170 million of that would wind up back in the pockets of the Fungs, who own a third of the company. That will come in handy as they buy the three product lines. Their investment firms will hold 55 percent of the acquired businesses, for an implied stake value of about $600 million. Buyout shop Hony Capital, owner of Pizza Express and other companies, will have the rest."
walmart,2017-12,"The transaction values the sweaters-to-cosmetics enterprise at nearly 15 times earnings before interest and taxes. That's a healthy multiple for an operation in decline. Li & Fung stock jumped almost 9 percent on the news, suggesting it's not a deal that's too cozy. A majority of non-family shareholders also will be needed to sign off on the sale. That should help leave everyone involved with a warm and fuzzy feeling."
walmart,2017-12,"- Li & Fung, the Hong Kong trading conglomerate, said on Dec. 14 it would sell its furniture, sweaters and beauty products businesses to the company's founding family and a private equity firm for $1.1 billion in cash."
walmart,2017-12,- The board said it plans to use some of the proceeds to pay a special dividend of $520 million.
walmart,2017-12,"- Under terms of the deal, Hony Capital will own 45 percent of the products divested, while Fung Holdings will take a 45 percent stake and Fung Investments will hold the remaining 10 percent."

walmart,2017-12,(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.)
walmart,2017-12,"NEW YORK, Dec 14 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Target will need more than Shipt to fend off Amazon and Walmart . The $34 billion retailer said on Wednesday that it would buy the upstart grocery-delivery platform for $550 million. That's a step in the right direction to leverage its brick-and-mortar shops in an online world. But it will need to do much more to escape the squeeze of the e-commerce juggernauts."
walmart,2017-12,"Alabama-based Shipt manages more than 20,000 ""personal shoppers"" who retrieve groceries from local stores and deliver them to customers' homes. The acquisition should allow Target to compete with Amazon, at least on speed, by turning its retail stores into an ersatz network of warehouses. Shipt might also bring down the retailer's high e-commerce fulfillment costs, which it has flagged as a pressure on profitability."
walmart,2017-12,"Investors greeted the news with enthusiasm: Target's share price rose nearly 2 percent, adding almost $600 million to the company's value. But it comes after a rough year for shareholders. Target's stock is down 13 percent this year, even as Walmart and Amazon have surged 41 percent and 57 percent, respectively."
walmart,2017-12,"Target has lagged its larger bricks-and-mortar rival in moving online. Walmart's U.S. e-commerce sales grew 50 percent in the latest quarter, pushing its overall top-line comparable sales in the United States to 2.7 percent. By contrast, Target's digital-channel sales increased 24 percent in the same period. It expects full-year sales growth to range from flat to 1 percent."
walmart,2017-12,"More broadly, the ""Beast of Bentonville"" and ""Death Star"" (as Liberty Media's John Malone recently dubbed Amazon) are moving fast and breaking things in Target's backyard. Amazon moved into the grocery business this year with its acquisition of Whole Foods, while last year Walmart purchased Jet.com, a direct e-commerce competitor to Amazon. This year it snapped up companies ranging from men's fashion (Bonobos) to shoes (ShoeBuy) and delivery (Parcel)."
walmart,2017-12,"Target's Shipt deal, along with its purchase of the transportation-technology company Grand Junction in August, is small by comparison. It has other initiatives in the works, such as Target Restock, a pilot next-day delivery service for home essentials. But the Minneapolis-based retailer's need to become more aggressive to keep pace in the cutthroat retail market lingers as an investment risk."
walmart,2017-12,"- Target on Dec. 13 said it would acquire Shipt, an online grocery-delivery platform, for $550 million in cash. The e-commerce firm has more than 20,000 ""personal shoppers"" who retrieve items in stores and deliver them to customers, who pay an annual fee of $99 for unlimited deliveries."
walmart,2017-12,"- Target says its acquisition of Shipt will bring same-day delivery services for groceries, essentials, home products, electronics and other items to around half its stores by early 2018. The company says it will offer same-day delivery on all products by the end of 2019."

walmart,2017-12,"LONDON, Dec 12 (Reuters) - Pointy, a Dublin-based firm with Silicon Valley backers, is solving the problem of how to make it easier for people to find products they want close to home, as shopping online gets easier but locating what you want locally remains elusive."
walmart,2017-12,"""Someone could just walk down the street and pick (an item) up, but that information is just frustratingly difficult to find,"" Pointy Co-Founder and Chief Executive Mark Cummins said."
walmart,2017-12,"""Retailers are losing out and those sales are going away to Amazon or they're going away to even a larger brick-and-mortar retailer,"" he said in a video-link interview from Dublin, where Cummins estimates that 14 percent of the city's retailers have adopted the Pointy service."
walmart,2017-12,"Only a handful of the world's largest retailers such as Wal-Mart Stores offer consumers the ability to search local store shelves online, after massive investments in inventory stocking systems to provide this data."
walmart,2017-12,"Pointy's device plugs into barcode scanners at retail checkouts and captures product data when consumers shop, creating a map of what is selling from the store's inventory."
walmart,2017-12,This allows retailers to feature what they have on their shelves in local online search results. Pointy also creates and hosts websites for businesses to feature what they have in stock.
walmart,2017-12,"""Pointy creates the data feed for the store, which the retailer can then use to integrate with other services such as Google Shopping,"" Cummins said."
walmart,2017-12,Three-year-old Pointy has moved into individual stores and small chains across the United States and this month began expanding into Canada from its Dublin base.
walmart,2017-12,"It is also working on greater integration with Google, Cummins said, building on ties he has after the Silicon Valley search giant made its first ever UK acquisition in 2010 by buying his machine vision start-up Plink."
walmart,2017-12,"Pointy aims to help rival national chains, or even the smallest retailers, compete with tools to draw online consumers into their stores."
walmart,2017-12,"In September, the company said it had raised $6 million in funding from tech entrepreneurs including Lars Rasmussen, a co-creator of Google Maps, Matt Mullenweg, who developed WordPress blogging software and Taavet Hinrikus, co-founder of money transfer service Transferwise."
