walmart,2017-7,{{20170726T133004.925+0000}}Wal-Mart proposes policy actions to boost U.S. manufacturing By Nandita Bose
walmart,2017-7,"CHICAGO, July 26 (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc on Wednesday proposed 10 policy actions to boost U.S. manufacturing that the retailer said could help recapture $300 billion of the $650 billion worth of consumer goods that are currently imported."
walmart,2017-7,"Wal-Mart said barriers to manufacturing growth include a lack of available and qualified workers and of co-ordination and financing to support U.S. manufacturers, complex regulations that create high compliance costs and legal risks, and the need for an overhaul of the U.S. tax system and trade deals."
walmart,2017-7,"The world's largest retailer, which committed to sourcing $250 billion worth of U.S.-made goods in 2013, said it identified those challenges as it worked with suppliers over the last four years."
walmart,2017-7,"Wal-Mart's comments come at a time when U.S. President Donald Trump has made boosting domestic manufacturing a key focus of his economic agenda. Earlier this month the White House held its ""Made in America"" week showcasing U.S. goods. [nL1N1K81D1]"
walmart,2017-7,"The company's policy proposals included building vocational training programs, reducing costs for private industry to train workers, rebranding U.S. manufacturing to attract workers and drive demand for domestic products, encouraging component production to close supply chain gaps and promoting manufacturing clusters through public-private cooperation."
walmart,2017-7,"Other proposals included eliminating federal overlap in manufacturing regulations, creating flexible compliance requirements for small businesses, creating a globally competitive tax environment, expanding tax deductions to foster manufacturing investments and overhauling trade agreements."
walmart,2017-7,"Wal-Mart said it discussed these proposals at a meeting with individuals and organizations representing business, government and non-governmental organizations in Washington D.C."
walmart,2017-7,"Citing an analysis by the Boston Consulting Group, Wal-Mart said every $100 billion that is onshored has the potential to create more than 500,000 direct manufacturing jobs which could then create an additional 1.5 million jobs."
walmart,2017-7,July 25 (Reuters) - Shares in Supervalu Inc jumped 13 percent on Tuesday and were headed for their biggest one-day gain in four years after the grocery wholesaler and retailer reported quarterly sales that topped some analyst expectations.
walmart,2017-7,The results boosted other grocery shares that have taken a beating since Amazon.com Inc in June announced plans to buy Whole Foods Market Inc for $13.7 billion.
walmart,2017-7,Wal-Mart Stores Inc Kroger Co and United Natural Foods Inc each rose more than 2 percent.
walmart,2017-7,"""The industry is up in sympathy with Supevalu,"" said Pivotal Research analyst Ajay Jain."
walmart,2017-7,"On top of the competitive threat from Amazon.com, falling food prices have eaten into the grocery store industry's profit margins."
walmart,2017-7,"Supevalu reported fiscal first-quarter net sales of $4 billion, up 6.3 percent and marginally higher than average analyst expectations, according to Thomson Reuters data."
walmart,2017-7,"The company's wholesale net sales rose 12.4 percent in the quarter, an increase that Jain said was better than he expected."
walmart,2017-7,"Supervalu shares were up 42 cents at $3.67 and on track for their largest one-day percentage gain since 2013. The shares were still down 21 percent year to date, however, even with Tuesday's gain."

walmart,2017-7,"LONDON, July 25 (Reuters) - GlaxoSmithKline has appointed former Wal-Mart Stores executive Karenann Terrell to the new senior position of chief digital and technology officer as the drugmaker looks to harness smart tech systems across the group."
walmart,2017-7,"The move reflects a desire by Chief Executive Emma Walmsley, who took over in April, to apply digital platforms in everything from clinical trials to customer interactions. It comes a day before GSK reports quarterly results."
walmart,2017-7,"Major drugmakers are grappling with the impact of technology on their businesses, as digital apps offer patients new ways to monitor their health and online communications with prescribers and consumers become routine."

walmart,2017-7,"Terrell, who left Wal-Mart as chief information officer in February, will join GSK on Sept. 4 and will be a member of the senior corporate executive team in her new role, GSK said."
walmart,2017-7,"Prior to working at Wal-Mart, Terrell was at U.S. healthcare group Baxter International and before that at Daimler Chrysler."
walmart,2017-7,"""The impact of technology on the healthcare industry is accelerating and requires us to rethink our approach,"" Walmsley said in a statement."
walmart,2017-7,"""As a member of the executive team, Karenann will have the scope to think radically about how we can exploit the latest opportunities and ultimately improve our business performance."""
walmart,2017-7,"Walmsley, who previously headed GSK's consumer health unit after 17 years at L'Oreal , is known for her focus on benchmarking business performance and has already flagged her intention to improve returns at GSK."
walmart,2017-7,"Her top priority is expected to be overhauling pharmaceutical research, where the British company has lagged behind rivals in terms of generating multibillion-dollar blockbusters in recent years."
walmart,2017-7,"Walmsley will outline her vision for GSK alongside second-quarter results on Wednesday, when she is likely to detail plans to streamline the drug R&D pipeline and ensure research is more closely aligned to commercial opportunities. [nL5N1KC11Z]"

walmart,2017-7,"LONDON, July 24 (Reuters Breakingviews) - B&M offers an unimaginative punt on Brexit Britain. The discount retailer was named as a potential 4.4 billion pound target for Wal-Mart's Asda in a Sunday Times report. With incomes tightening, UK shoppers will likely trade down to cheaper goods. Yet Asda could as easily soup up its own existing offering, or copy rivals Tesco and J Sainsbury with a more ambitious deal."
walmart,2017-7,"It's not that B&M, which sells everything from cut-price dog food to bedside cabinets, isn't an attractive target. Its like-for-like sales in the UK grew 7.3 percent in the first quarter of the year. Retailers who pile it high and sell it cheap are doing well in a country with stagnant wage growth and moderate inflation. Rival Home Bargains almost tripled its UK market share since the 2008 financial crisis, while Poundstretcher and Poundworld also saw significant gains, according to Euromonitor data."
walmart,2017-7,"Asda though, can do better. For one, a mooted 4.4 billion pound price tag, or 4.8 billion pounds including debt, is no bargain. B&M is forecast by analysts to make 297 million pounds of operating profit in 2020. Asda would have to almost double that to get a decent return on investment of 9 percent."
walmart,2017-7,"Big retailers are getting more creative in their business models, and there's no reason Asda shouldn't too. Its parent Wal-Mart spent $3.3 billion on online retailer Jet.com last year. Tesco is pushing into the wholesale business by buying wholesaler Booker , and Sainsbury's snapped up general retailer Argos to drive footfall in its supermarket stores. But doing more is a poor substitute for doing better."

walmart,2017-7,"LONDON, July 24 (Reuters) - Shares in British discount retailer B&M European Value Retail rose as much as 5.3 percent on Monday after a report that Asda, the UK supermarket arm of Wal-Mart Stores , was considering 4.4 billion pound ($5.7 billion) takeover bid."
walmart,2017-7,"However, the rise indicated a value for B&M much lower than the reported takeover value, indicating that investors were not convinced by the report."

walmart,2017-7,"POLL-Americans want U.S. goods, but not willing to pay more -Reuters/Ipsos  - Reuters News"
walmart,2017-7,"HARRISBURG, Pa., July 18 (Reuters) - Americans say they love U.S.-made goods. They are less enthusiastic, however, about paying a premium for them."
walmart,2017-7,"At the AMES Companies Inc factory here, the wheelbarrows coming off the assembly line once every six seconds cost the company more to make in the United States than abroad, but U.S. retailers generally will not charge more for them because consumers would balk, AMES President Mark Traylor said."
walmart,2017-7,"A Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Tuesday found 70 percent of Americans think it is ""very important"" or ""somewhat important"" to buy U.S.-made products."
walmart,2017-7,"Despite that sentiment, 37 percent said they would refuse to pay more for U.S.-made goods versus imports. Twenty six percent said they would only pay up to 5 percent more to buy American, and 21 percent capped the premium at 10 percent."
walmart,2017-7,"U.S. President Donald Trump rode into office on promises of bringing back manufacturing jobs and boosting economic growth, and has criticized companies that move production overseas."
walmart,2017-7,"Trump has also been quick to promote U.S.-made goods, and on Monday released a state-by-state ""Made in America Product Showcase"" that included AMES wheelbarrows."
walmart,2017-7,"Lower-income Americans were the most enthusiastic about buying U.S. goods, the poll showed, despite being the least able to afford paying extra for them."
walmart,2017-7,"Indeed, the biggest U.S. retailer is well aware of the priority buyers place on price above all else. A spokesman for Wal-Mart Stores Inc said customers are telling them ""that where products are made is most important second only to price."""
walmart,2017-7,The good news for U.S. factories is that Americans like the quality of many domestic goods.
walmart,2017-7,Thirty-one percent in the poll said American-made cars are the best in the world. German cars were voted best by 23 percent of respondents. And thirty-eight percent said U.S.-made clothes were best.
walmart,2017-7,"Still, domestic manufacturers could be in trouble if they fail to capitalize on perceptions about the quality of their products while also keeping a tight lid on costs."
walmart,2017-7,"In order to compete, companies like AMES have to find ways to offset their disadvantage"
walmart,2017-7,"""We don't have to be as cheap as imports,"" says Traylor, who estimated he sells his wheelbarrows to U.S. retailers for about 10 percent more than importers."
walmart,2017-7,Factors like cheaper domestic freight and a desire among retailers to carry lower inventories can help make up some of the cost differential.
walmart,2017-7,"AMES is also better positioned than overseas suppliers to help retailers be agile. When spring comes early, for example, AMES can respond quickly to ship goods to stores, Traylor said, something importers with longer lead times on orders struggle to do."
walmart,2017-7,Traylor said another secret to success for U.S. manufacturers is investing in technology to cut costs.
walmart,2017-7,"AMES, a subsidiary of New York-based Griffon Corp , is pouring $50 million into upgrades at several locations. The Harrisburg factory, built in 1921, is dotted with aged machinery that has been fitted with robotic attachments to reduce reliance on human labor."
walmart,2017-7,"The company said it recently convinced a major retailer, who they did not want to identify, to switch from Mexican-made wheelbarrows to carry their product."
walmart,2017-7,"AMES also said business is so strong that it is hiring 100 employees across its five Pennsylvania locations, including the Harrisburg factory."
walmart,2017-7,Traylor says AMES wants to bring more work back from overseas. But that can be difficult.
walmart,2017-7,And the production of certain components may prove impossible to ever bring back to U.S. soil.
walmart,2017-7,"In late April, Trump marked his 100th day in office with a visit to the AMES plant. With workers chanting ""USA, USA,"" Trump asked if every part of the wheelbarrows was made in America."
walmart,2017-7,"U.S. manufacturers stopped large-scale production of air-filled tires for garden equipment years ago, and the cost of setting up production now would be hard to justify for the low-margin product."
walmart,2017-7,"Some rubber makers still manufacture solid rubber tires in the United States, but the last time AMES bought any they cost nearly twice the roughly $7 they pay for a Chinese tire, a big added cost for a wheelbarrow that often retails for less than $100."
walmart,2017-7,"""Is it feasible to get U.S.-made tires?"" asked Mark D'Agostino, the company's vice president for supply chain. ""We don't know yet."""
walmart,2017-7,"To be sure, some manufacturers can command a big premium for American-made products."
walmart,2017-7,"Klein Tools Inc, a privately held company based outside Chicago with annual sales of $500 million, makes hand tools that are highly sought after by electricians and other workers."
walmart,2017-7,A pair of 9-inch Klein pliers sells for about 30 percent more than a comparable import.
walmart,2017-7,But betting on the allure of American-made goods can be risky.
walmart,2017-7,"In 2012, High Point, North Carolina-based Stanley Furniture Co brought back production of cribs and other baby furniture from China to a U.S. plant, wagering that parents worried about a string of Chinese factory quality scandals would pay $700 for cribs nearly identical to imports selling for $400."
walmart,2017-7,"Customers refused to bite, however, and the High Point factory closed in 2014."
walmart,2017-7,"Still, Stanley Chief Executive Glenn Prillaman said the Trump administration's emphasis on American-made goods is a hopeful sign that resonates with ""people that work for a living,"" because they can see how it impacts their own jobs."
walmart,2017-7,"""The lower-end consumers certainly care, and that's a good thing,"" he said. ""But they're also not in a position to pay the premium."""
walmart,2017-7,"The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online in English throughout the United States from May 24 to May 31. It gathered responses from 2,857 people, including 593 adults who made less than $25,000 per year, 1,283 who said they earned between $25,000 and $74,999, and 805 people who earned more than $75,000."
walmart,2017-7,"The poll has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 2 percentage points for the entire group, 5 points for the low-income respondents, 3 points for the middle-income respondents and 4 points for the high-income respondents."

walmart,2017-7,"SAO PAULO, July 12 (Reuters) - GPA SA, Brazil's No. 1 diversified retailer, said market share at the company's food and staples division increased in the second quarter as turnaround efforts helped drive up sales despite a harsh recession and slowing inflation."
walmart,2017-7,"In a Wednesday securities filing, GPA said net revenue at the GPA Alimentar food and household goods division rose 9 percent to 10.663 billion reais ($3.3 billion) from a year earlier. It will release full quarterly results on July 25."
walmart,2017-7,"Sales at stores open at least a year were slightly higher than expected even as household consumption suffered on the back of Brazil's worst-ever recession and record unemployment. Store and format renovation helped GPA, which said it took market share from rivals."
walmart,2017-7,Carrefour SA and Wal-Mart Stores Inc are GPA's biggest competitors.
walmart,2017-7,"Same-store sales rose 1.2 percent at the multiretail segment and 13.5 percent at the Assai cash-and-carry division. Assai gained about 4 percentage points of market share, while figures for the multiretail segment were not disclosed."
walmart,2017-7,"The data provided a boost to Chief Executive Officer Ronaldo Iabrudi's turnaround strategy. Still, he had said in April that gains from a nascent economic recovery would come slowly and that 2017 would be ""a very tough year.""[nL1N1I018G]"
walmart,2017-7,"In recent months, results from converting the Extra hypermarket format into Assai cash-and-carry stores have been better than expected, according to analysts. The company will accelerate those conversions to offset a margin decline stemming from slowing food inflation."
walmart,2017-7,"Three hypermarkets were converted last quarter, with another 11 stores slated by year-end."
walmart,2017-7,"""Operating turnaround momentum continues,"" said UBS Securities analyst Gustavo Piras Oliveira, who estimated customer visits at Assai rose 11 percent in the quarter."
walmart,2017-7,"Preferred shares , GPA's most widely traded class of stock, gained for the fourth straight day on Wednesday, rising 0.3 percent to 66.60 reais. The stock is up 23 percent this year."

walmart,2017-7,"The explosion at the boiler, located in a tin-roofed shed, partially damaged a nearby three-storey factory building."
walmart,2017-7,"""I heard a big bang when I was having tea outside,"" factory driver Hafiz Mostafa said, as dozens thronged the factory site and firefighters moved rubble in search of missing persons. ""I saw windows, doors, glasses, machinery and a section of the wall of the building go flying."""

walmart,2017-7,"LONDON, July 4 (Reuters) - Sainsbury's , Britain's second biggest supermarket group, saw sales growth accelerate in its latest quarter, as it benefited from revamped food ranges and held down prices of staple goods despite rising inflation."

walmart,2017-7,"Sainsbury's and major rivals - market leader Tesco , Asda and Morrisons - are grappling with the rapid growth of discounters Aldi and Lidl and having to cope with more expensive food imports due to a fall in the value of sterling since Britain voted to leave the European Union."

walmart,2017-7,{{20170630T162140.171+0000}}ANALYSIS-U.S. fund managers seek consumer stocks that Amazon can't conquerBy David Randall
walmart,2017-7,"NEW YORK, June 30 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc's game-changing move to upend the grocery business with a surprise deal to buy Whole Foods Market Inc compounds a problem already vexing fund managers: how to play U.S. consumer spending when the Seattle-based e-commerce giant is threatening to take over retail."
walmart,2017-7,Amazon's relentless growth and destruction of value among traditional retail rivals is forcing active fund managers to look for bets in areas they think Amazon can't or won't reach.
walmart,2017-7,"Emerging options include theme restaurant chains, recreational vehicle makers and sellers of stuff that's just too heavy to ship via Amazon's network. Meanwhile, some fund managers are increasingly convinced the only way to play consumer spending is to move away from brands and retailers and into logistics and supply chain companies, essentially betting e-commerce will render most consumer companies obsolete."
walmart,2017-7,The challenge of investing in consumer companies comes a time when the category would typically shine.
walmart,2017-7,"Low unemployment and a solid housing market boost consumer stocks, yet companies in the category - excluding Amazon - are up just 5.2 percent for the year, or about 3 percentage points below the broad S&P 500 as a whole, according to Thomson Reuters data."
walmart,2017-7,"Amazon now accounts for about 34 percent of all U.S. online sales and should see that number grow to about 50 percent by 2021, according to a Needham research note."
walmart,2017-7,"Amazon's growing dominance is in some ways akin to the rise of Wal-Mart Stores Inc in the early 2000s, when its rapid growth and move to branch out into groceries raised concerns it would put other retailers out of business. Yet Amazon's greater online reach and purchase of a top-shelf grocery store chain makes it far more formidable, said Barbara Miller, a portfolio manager at Federated Kaufmann funds."
walmart,2017-7,"""I've been in this industry for twenty-five years and this is the biggest transformation we've seen in the consumer space,"" she said."
walmart,2017-7,"While Wal-Mart put many small mom-and-pop stores out of business, Amazon is dragging down national competitors like Target and Macy's with its combination of low prices, broad range of inventory, and speed, she said."
walmart,2017-7,"At the same time, Amazon is expanding its e-commerce dominance when more shoppers are online, suggesting more pain ahead for competitors. E-commerce sales grew 14.7 percent in 2016, nearly triple the 5.1-percent growth rate of traditional retailers, according to U.S. Census Bureau data."
walmart,2017-7,"Fund managers say Amazon's growing dominance is forcing them to shift long-held strategies, by either putting less money into consumer stocks overall or by focusing on companies that can compete alongside Amazon or may be attractive buyout targets."
walmart,2017-7,"The company's outsized 15.4-percent weighting, more than double the next-largest stock in the S&P 500 Consumer Discretionary index, is problematic for fund managers who typically will not hold any positions greater than 5 percent of their portfolio in order to manage risk."
walmart,2017-7,"Josh Cummings, a portfolio manager at Janus Henderson funds, is avoiding shares of direct competitors of Amazon, such as Target Corp , Kroger Co , and Wal-Mart, and instead focusing on companies with ""idiosyncratic"" attributes, he said."
walmart,2017-7,"Starbucks Corp , for instance, offers an experience that Amazon would find hard to match, he said, while Servicemaster Global Holdings , parent company of pest control company Terminix, is largely immune from e-commerce competition."
walmart,2017-7,"""Could Amazon decide they want to be in the business of spraying for bugs? It doesn't seem likely,"" he said."
walmart,2017-7,"Miller, the portfolio manager at the Federated Kaufmann funds, said she is moving away from stores that could be found in a mall, focusing instead on companies like Dave & Busters Entertainment Inc and Wingstop Inc that offer food-based experiences. She also owns shares of Camping World Holdings Inc , which sells a mix of goods and services ranging from roadside assistance to accessories to the growing recreational vehicle market."
walmart,2017-7,"""This is a company with a strong membership base that has the sort of scale in its niche to rival Amazon,"" she said."
walmart,2017-7,"Jeff Rottinghaus, portfolio manager of the T. Rowe Price U.S. Large-Cap Core Equity fund, said he owns Home Depot Inc shares because its stores essentially function as warehouses and much of its merchandise is too heavy or bulky to profitably ship quickly online."
walmart,2017-7,"Gary Bradshaw, a portfolio manager at Hodges Capital in Dallas, said he expects that portfolio holding Wal-Mart will become more aggressive in acquiring small, private companies to broaden its online reach."
walmart,2017-7,"The company announced a deal to buy men's wear company Bonobos for $310 million in mid-June, following purchases of outdoor gear retailer Moosejaw and online shoe store ShoeBuy. Wal-Mart acquired online retailer Jet.com in a $3.3 billion deal last August."
walmart,2017-7,"""They're going to do whatever it takes to compete with Amazon. They may be losing the battle at the moment but that doesn't mean that they will back down,"" he said."
walmart,2017-7,Other investors are getting their consumer exposure by focusing on behind-the-scenes companies that power the growth of e-commerce.
walmart,2017-7,"Laird Bieger, a portfolio manager of the Baron Discovery Fund - the top-performing small-cap growth fund year-to-date - said he is focusing on companies like CommerceHub Inc , which works with companies such as J C Penney Co and Best Buy Inc to allow them to sell more products online and ship directly from manufacturers."
walmart,2017-7,"Craig Richard, a co-portfolio manager of the Buffalo Emerging Opportunities fund, said he has been buying Kornit Digital Ltd , which makes textile printers that can produce t-shirt and other apparel designs on demand, helping save inventory costs."
walmart,2017-7,"Amazon is Kornit's largest customer and has warrants to buy up to 2.9 million Kornit shares, about 8 percent of the company, at $13.03 a share over the next five years. Shares of Kornit, up 57 percent this year, traded at $19.95 on Friday."
