walmart,2017-2,Feb 27 (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc on Monday won the dismissal of a U.S. lawsuit accusing the world's largest retailer of defrauding shareholders in its Wal-Mart de Mexico unit by concealing its suspected bribery of public officials in Mexico.
walmart,2017-2,U.S. District Judge Katherine Polk Failla in Manhattan said holders of Wal-Mex's American depository shares (ADRs) cannot pursue claims that Wal-Mex's former Chairman Ernesto Vega and Chief Executive Scot Rank knew or were reckless in not knowing about the bribery allegations.

walmart,2017-2,"Feb 27 (Reuters) - Apple Inc and German software maker SAP SE will release a tool aimed at helping developers build iPhone apps for big businesses, the two companies said on Monday."
walmart,2017-2,"The software tool, to be released on March 30, is designed to let developers easily feed data between SAP's business-oriented software systems and Apple's consumer-oriented iOS mobile platform."
walmart,2017-2,"Currently, most of SAP's systems are used on personal computers rather than on mobile devices. SAP plans to change that by working directly with Apple on software tools that will make it easier to access data on SAP systems from apps on an iPhone or iPad, an effort that began last spring."
walmart,2017-2,"The tool could, for example, let employees log into business apps with fingerprint readers common on iPhones rather than a password, or replace bulky inventory scanning guns used in warehouses with iPhones."
walmart,2017-2,"""The collaboration between our two firms is unparalleled from an engineering standpoint,"" said Rick Knowles, a senior vice president at SAP. ""Every five to six weeks, we've put our developers in the room with Apple's lead engineers to do a code-level review."""
walmart,2017-2,"With growth in iPhone sales losing steam, Apple has increased its efforts to sell to large businesses. In 2014, Apple launched a partnership with IBM Corp to help build custom iOS applications for businesses. In 2016, Apple made a deal with Cisco to make iPhones work better on Cisco's networking gear, and it also partnered with Deloitte & Touche LLP [DLTE.UL] to encourage more businesses to build iOS applications."
walmart,2017-2,"The SAP partnership also gives iOS developers a new way to gain revenue in an era when most of the App Store's growth is driven by downloads in China and by game makers. Apple said earlier this year that developers made $20 billion from the App Store in 2016, an increase of 40 percent from 2015."
walmart,2017-2,"But according to App Annie, an analytics firm that tracks App Store metrics, iOS downloads were up only 12 percent in 2016 to 30 billion apps, and 80 percent of download growth for iOS apps came from China. Moreover, 75 percent of revenue generated in the App Store came from games, App Annie reported."

walmart,2017-2,"Feb 27 (Reuters) - Apple Inc and German software maker SAP SE will release a tool aimed at helping developers build iPhone apps for big businesses, the two companies said on Monday."
walmart,2017-2,"The software tool, to be released on March 30, is designed to let developers easily feed data between SAP's business-oriented software systems and Apple's consumer-oriented iOS mobile platform."
walmart,2017-2,"Currently, most of SAP's systems are used on personal computers rather than on mobile devices. SAP plans to change that by working directly with Apple on software tools that will make it easier to access data on SAP systems from apps on an iPhone or iPad, an effort that began last spring."
walmart,2017-2,"The tool could, for example, let employees log into business apps with fingerprint readers common on iPhones rather than a password, or replace bulky inventory scanning guns used in warehouses with iPhones."
walmart,2017-2,"""The collaboration between our two firms is unparalleled from an engineering standpoint,"" said Rick Knowles, a senior vice president at SAP. ""Every five to six weeks, we've put our developers in the room with Apple's lead engineers to do a code-level review."""
walmart,2017-2,"With growth in iPhone sales losing steam, Apple has increased its efforts to sell to large businesses. In 2014, Apple launched a partnership with IBM Corp to help build custom iOS applications for businesses. In 2016, Apple made a deal with Cisco to make iPhones work better on Cisco's networking gear, and it also partnered with Deloitte & Touche LLP [DLTE.UL] to encourage more businesses to build iOS applications."
walmart,2017-2,"The SAP partnership also gives iOS developers a new way to gain revenue in an era when most of the App Store's growth is driven by downloads in China and by game makers. Apple said earlier this year that developers made $20 billion from the App Store in 2016, an increase of 40 percent from 2015."
walmart,2017-2,"But according to App Annie, an analytics firm that tracks App Store metrics, iOS downloads were up only 12 percent in 2016 to 30 billion apps, and 80 percent of download growth for iOS apps came from China. Moreover, 75 percent of revenue generated in the App Store came from games, App Annie reported."

walmart,2017-2,"But the company managed to produce strong profit growth partly by containing costs and increasing the profitability of its wholesale and discounting divisions, which had been underperforming, analysts said."
walmart,2017-2,"Massmart reported diluted headline earnings per share of 587.6 cents for the 12 months to end-December, compared with 508.8 cents a year earlier, reflecting buoyant food and liquor sales in its home market."

walmart,2017-2,"LONDON, Feb 21 (Reuters) - Asda, the British supermarket arm of Wal-Mart , said it had stemmed the pace of sales decline over the last three months, suggesting new CEO Sean Clarke's focus on pricing and product quality is starting to have an impact."
walmart,2017-2,"Wal-Mart veteran Clarke, who joined Asda in July, and former Sainsbury's executive Roger Burnley, who started as chief operations officer three months later, have focused on making Asda more competitive - sharpening its prices, improving the quality and availability of product ranges and enhancing customer service."
walmart,2017-2,"Of Britain's big four grocers, which also include market leader Tesco , Sainsbury's and Morrisons , Asda has been most exposed to the advance of the German discounters Aldi [ALDIEI.UL] and Lidl [LIDUK.UL]."

walmart,2017-2,"While that represented a 10th straight quarter of falling sales, the outcome was in line with analysts' expectations and was a significant improvement on declines of 5.8 percent and 7.5 percent in the previous two quarters respectively."
walmart,2017-2,Monthly industry data has also indicated that Asda's trading continued to improve through January. [nL5N1FS1RK]

walmart,2017-2,"Wal-Mart's Chief Financial Officer Brett Biggs welcomed Asda's encouraging data but cautioned: ""We have a lot of work to do in this market."""
walmart,2017-2,"Asda is Britain's third largest grocery retailer but has lost over 1 percentage point of UK market share since 2014, according to researcher Kantar Worldpanel. Its share currently stands at 15.6 percent, versus more than 28 percent for Tesco."

walmart,2017-2,"NEW YORK, Feb 17 (Reuters) - U.S. stock investors may look to a host of results from consumer-facing companies including Wal-Mart Stores Inc next week for signs on whether the recent market rally has more room to run."

walmart,2017-2,"The consumer names are among the last major companies of the S&P 500 earnings season to report, but the results will also be watched for a read on spending as well as for commentary from executives on President Donald Trump's proposal to tax imports."

walmart,2017-2,"More than a dozen city officials, employers and workers interviewed here said a border tax, if enacted, could choke the flow of imports from Mexico. They described a chain of events that would harm the economy, threaten local jobs and lead to higher prices for U.S. consumers."
walmart,2017-2,"""President Trump should take a good look at the effects of whatever he does, because he's going to end up with a real problem,"" said Nogales Mayor John Doyle, who joined other lawmakers from Arizona, New Mexico and Texas in denouncing the import tax plan in letters to U.S. lawmakers."
walmart,2017-2,"Food, autos and electronics go both ways across the border checkpoint, sometimes more than once. Mexican mangoes and melons come north while California almonds and apples from Washington state go south. U.S. car parts sent to Mexican factories are imported back as finished vehicles."
walmart,2017-2,"""There are hundreds of products that come back and forth through the port of entry in Nogales,"" Doyle said."
walmart,2017-2,The Trump administration told Reuters that any tax deal would protect U.S. interests.
walmart,2017-2,"""The American people can rest assured that any policy President Trump pursues will be designed to increase wages for American workers, reduce the U.S. trade deficit, and strengthen the economy so that it works for all,"" a White House official said in an email."
walmart,2017-2,"Since the 1994 implementation of NAFTA, trade between Mexico and the United States has risen more than six fold. Each country exported about $40 billion to the other in 1993. Last year the United States imported $294 billion in goods from Mexico and exported $231 billion back, U.S. Census data show."
walmart,2017-2,"Nationwide, nearly 5 million jobs are now tied to trade with Mexico, from importers to jobs dependent on low-cost goods, according to a study by the non-partisan Wilson Center's Mexico Institute."
walmart,2017-2,"In Santa Cruz County, surrounding Nogales, the produce import industry and supporting businesses account for more than 22 percent of jobs, according to a 2013 report by economists at the University of Arizona. Trade and support for factories across the border account for another 10 percent of the workforce."
walmart,2017-2,"The report's lead author, Vera Pavlakovich-Kochi, said a 20 percent border tax would create the strictest barriers to trade in five decades."
walmart,2017-2,"In addition to Trump's proposal of a 20 percent tax on imports from Mexico, Republican lawmakers have put forth a plan that would cut corporate income tax to 20 percent from 35 percent, exclude export revenue from taxable income and impose a 20 percent tax on imports."
walmart,2017-2,"A group of major exporters including Boeing Co , General Electric Co and Pfizer Inc have formed a coalition to support the import tax [nL1N1FN1IA]. At the same time, large retailers, including Target Corp and Best Buy Co Inc , have countered that such a tax would raise consumer prices and hurt their businesses.[L1N1FZ1DP]"
walmart,2017-2,"Seated in his second-floor office in a warehouse nestled in the rolling hills on the outskirts of town, produce trader Jaime Chamberlain said business with Mexico is the lifeblood of Nogales, which brings in more pounds of Mexican produce than any other U.S. border town."
walmart,2017-2,"It's ""one of the largest industries here with the most employment and the most to lose,"" said Chamberlain, a board member of the Fresh Produce Association of the Americas. He voted for Trump and his pro-business, socially conservative agendas, but is lobbying state leaders to oppose the tax."
walmart,2017-2,"Chamberlain's parents began the family business with a $1,000 loan in 1971. He and his sister now own J-C Distributing Inc, which employs about 25 people who handle 120,000 pounds of Mexican tomatoes each week for Taco Bell in addition to orders for major companies such as Kroger Co and Sysco Corp ."
walmart,2017-2,"The company warehouse is among more than six dozen such facilities on Interstate 19, just a few miles north of Nogales' town square. In all, they bring in fruits and vegetables worth $3.3 billion a year, according to the Fresh Produce Association."
walmart,2017-2,"Local officials, residents and economists warn that a tax could reverberate across the local economy. For example, a 20 percent border tax could put some of the $17 million in produce trade-related fees on custom brokerage, freight forwarding and truck permits at risk."
walmart,2017-2,"""There are a lot of unintended consequences with this,"" said Santa Cruz Board of Supervisors Chairman Manuel Ruiz. ""There are domino effects all over. """
walmart,2017-2,"""A 20 percent tax could start a trade war with Mexico. I don't see how we can impose that unilaterally,"" said Ricardo Crisantes, vice president of marketing and sales at Wholesum Harvest, which is part of a Mexico-based company that has offices in Nogales and organic farms on both sides of the border."
walmart,2017-2,"Company representatives said a border tax could drive the company to shift more farming to the United States, but it also could send import demand to other parts of Latin America that would bypass Nogales."
walmart,2017-2,Restaurant and store owners say the tax would make already tough times even worse.
walmart,2017-2,"""It would be huge,"" said Karla Galindo, 35, who owns Rancho Grande restaurant in Nogales with her husband."
walmart,2017-2,"She and other local business owners said sales have already been hurt by the war of words between officials in Mexico and the United States. ""People are afraid to spend their money,"" Galindo said."

walmart,2017-2,"Feb 15 (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc has acquired online outdoor clothing and gear retailer Moosejaw for $51 million in an all-cash deal, the company said on Wednesday, as it works to boost its competitive standing in U.S. e-commerce."
walmart,2017-2,"Moosejaw will be Wal-Mart's third acquisition in just over six months. In August 2016, the world's largest retailer paid more than $3 billion to acquire online startup Jet.com and in late December, Jet.com acquired online footwear retailer ShoeBuy for approximately $70 million."
walmart,2017-2,"In the five years before the Jet.com deal, the retailer acquired more than 15 startups. Wal-Mart has not disclosed what it spent on each of those acquisitions, but said it spent a total of $3.1 billion on e-commerce and digital projects in the four fiscal years to January 2017."
walmart,2017-2,"Moosejaw is a Michigan-based online retailer with 10 brick-and-mortar stores. It sells outdoor gear and apparel from makers including Patagonia and North Face and has ""strong relationships"" with these brands, Wal-Mart said in a statement."

walmart,2017-2,"NEW YORK, Feb 14 (Reuters) - Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc was an aggressive buyer of stocks in last year's fourth quarter, nearly quadrupling its stake in Apple Inc and increasing its stake sevenfold in the four biggest U.S. airlines."
walmart,2017-2,"In a regulatory filing, Berkshire reported owning 57.4 million shares of Apple as of Dec. 31, which would now be worth $7.74 billion, up from just from 15.2 million shares in the iPhone maker three months earlier."
walmart,2017-2,"Berkshire also reported a $9.3 billion airline stake, with investments topping $2.1 billion in each of American Airlines Group Inc , Delta Air Lines Inc , Southwest Airlines Co and United Continental Holdings Inc ."
walmart,2017-2,"It also disclosed new stakes in satellite radio company Sirius XM Holdings Inc and seed company Monsanto Co , which is being bought by Germany's Bayer AG ."
walmart,2017-2,"Though it is unclear who make which investments, the filing appears to reflect much of the $12 billion of stock that Buffett said he had bought between the Nov. 8 Presidential election and the end of January."
walmart,2017-2,"Larger Berkshire investments such as Wells Fargo & Co , Coca-Cola Co and International Business Machines Corp are normally Buffett's, but the 86-year-old billionaire has given his deputies Todd Combs and Ted Weschler more to invest over the years."
walmart,2017-2,"Berkshire's initial investment in Apple got attention last year, given Buffett's usual aversion to technology companies - apart from IBM - which he considers outside his zone of competence."
walmart,2017-2,"The new, larger stake makes Berkshire one of Apple's 10 biggest investors."
walmart,2017-2,"""I'm stunned to see the size of that Apple position,"" said Thomas Russo, who oversees $11 billion of assets, including 12 percent in Berkshire, at Gardner Russo & Gardner in Lancaster, Pennsylvania."
walmart,2017-2,"The Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate also owns roughly 90 companies such as the BNSF railroad, Geico car insurance and Dairy Queen ice cream."
walmart,2017-2,"Its Class A shares closed on Tuesday up $2,078.95 at $250,419, a record high closing price and less than 0.2 percentage points below its all-time high on Dec. 14."
walmart,2017-2,"Shares of Apple closed on Tuesday up $1.73 at $135.02, also a record closing high."
walmart,2017-2,"Assuming Berkshire has not sold its stake, Apple's 16.6 percent gain this year would leave it with a $1.1 billion paper profit in 2017 alone."
walmart,2017-2,It had been widely believed that Berkshire's initial investment came from Combs or Weschler.
walmart,2017-2,"But their decisions have sometimes influenced Buffett, as when Berkshire last year paid $32.1 billion for aircraft parts maker Precision Castparts Corp, once a Combs investment."
walmart,2017-2,"""It's quite possible that Warren woke up and began to understand the virtues of Apple that he had been neglecting or, like with Precision Castparts, Todd or Ted had an affinity for Apple that sparked interest from Warren,"" Russo said."
walmart,2017-2,Combs and Weschler are the leading candidates to eventually succeed Buffett as Berkshire's chief investment officer.
walmart,2017-2,"The airline investments, meanwhile, suggest that Buffett has overcome his two-decade aversion to the sector after an unhappy - though, he has said, profitable - investment in US Air Group."
walmart,2017-2,"Buffett told talk show host Charlie Rose in an interview last month that it was ""in large part"" his decision to dive back into airlines."
walmart,2017-2,"""The industry was once balkanized, but now it is bulking up, and has come to realize that an empty seat is a perishable asset,"" Russo said. ""More planes are traveling more full."""
walmart,2017-2,"Shares of American, Delta, Southwest and United, as well as Apple, Monsanto and Sirius, rose in after-hours trading."
walmart,2017-2,Such increases often occur when investors perceive that Berkshire has given a company its imprimatur.
walmart,2017-2,Monsanto and Sirius did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

walmart,2017-2,"LONDON, Feb 14 (Reuters) - Pernod Ricard would have to pass a proposed U.S. tax on imported goods onto consumers, the chief executive of the French spirits group said on Tuesday."
walmart,2017-2,"""Retailers are saying, and we're fully in line with them, that the border adjustment tax is a consumer tax, a consumption tax,"" Alexandre Ricard told reporters in London."
walmart,2017-2,"Ricard's comments come the same week that the chief executives of some of America's largest retailers, including Target Corp and Best Buy Co Inc head to Washington to try to kill the tax. [nL1N1FZ020]"
walmart,2017-2,"""I don't think it's fair to the American consumer,"" Ricard said of the proposal by Republican lawmakers to impose a 20 percent tax on imports. [nL1N1FM14Z]"
walmart,2017-2,"The U.S. arm of the maker of Absolut vodka, Martell cognac and Mumm champagne has joined ""Americans for Affordable Products"", a group of over 100 businesses opposed to the tax."
walmart,2017-2,"The lobby group, launched earlier this month, includes other distillers Diageo North America and LVMH , as well as retailers including Walmart , Nike and Walgreens Boots Alliance , according to its website."
walmart,2017-2,"Pernod's business relies largely on provenance-based drinks whose production can not be moved, such as cognac and champagne, which must both be made in France."
walmart,2017-2,"But for some products, like blended Scotch, there is flexibility. For example, Ricard said it was possible to blend Scotch in Scotland and ship it to the United States in bulk in inert containers to be bottled locally."
walmart,2017-2,"He said such a move could be more efficient regardless of any border tax, since shipping whisky in bulk is lighter than shipping it in bottles."
walmart,2017-2,"""Maybe, it's something one could consider despite all of that,"" Ricard told Reuters. ""I would say it's something we should do anyway for environmental reasons."""

walmart,2017-2,"CHICAGO, Feb 13 (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc for the first time will combine its own buying for products sold at its stores with purchases it makes for its website, sources said, a significant move to stamp out duplicate efforts as it consolidates buying operations to better fight Amazon.com Inc ."
walmart,2017-2,Vendors contacted by Wal-Mart about the change told Reuters the store and online buying teams of the world's largest retailer currently operate independently.
walmart,2017-2,"Wal-Mart has told some vendors it is seeking to make the buying process more efficient for itself and vendors, and improve coordination between its buying teams. It also wants to apply its bricks-and-mortar expertise in securing the lowest possible prices to its e-commerce business, according to the vendors, who spoke over the last few days. They declined to be identified for fear of disrupting business relations with Wal-Mart."
walmart,2017-2,"The move is part of a broader push by Chief Executive Doug McMillon and new e-commerce chief Marc Lore to narrow the gap with Amazon and boost Wal-Mart's competitive standing in U.S. e-commerce. Lore, who joined Wal-Mart when it purchased the company he founded, Jet.com, last year, has been charged with revitalizing Wal-Mart's online business and has introduced changes such as free-two day shipping. [nL4N1FL01L]"
walmart,2017-2,"The company has told vendors it plans to disclose the change at a meeting with suppliers later this week, the vendor sources said."
walmart,2017-2,"Wal-Mart spokesman Lorenzo Lopez on Monday would say only that the company wants to create ""a more efficient process that accelerates how we bring the full assortment of products in stores to Walmart.com."" He did not elaborate."
walmart,2017-2,"The company expects Walmart.com's buying team to focus on expanding the online assortment, Lopez said."
walmart,2017-2,"Going forward, Wal-Mart's store buying team based at Bentonville, Arkansas, headquarters will place combined store and Web orders with suppliers who sell on both platforms. Under the new system, an item available for sale in the store will also be approved for sale online, the sources added."

walmart,2017-2,"Wal-Mart's buying team in San Bruno, California, will still deal with suppliers that make products that sell only on Walmart.com, the vendors said. Store suppliers who have items they sell exclusively online will also have to go through San Bruno, they added."

walmart,2017-2,"ATHERSTONE, England Feb 10 (Reuters) - Aldi is widening a price gap with rivals in Britain and is still delivering underlying sales growth there, the head of its UK business told Reuters, denying the discount supermarket was suffering the effects of a fightback by bigger chains."
walmart,2017-2,"Britain's four major supermarkets - market leader Tesco , Sainsbury's , Asda and Morrisons - have all raised their game to counter the rapid rise of Aldi and fellow German-owned discounter Lidl [LIDUK.UL], sacrificing profits to fund price cuts and improved service. All have said they have narrowed the price gap with the discounters."
walmart,2017-2,"Not so, says Matthew Barnes, Aldi's [ALDIEI.UL] chief executive for the UK and Ireland."
walmart,2017-2,"""When you look at any price comparisons or our own internal data it shows us that if anything the price differential between Aldi and the big four is growing at the moment,"" he said in an interview at Aldi's headquarters at Atherstone, central England."
walmart,2017-2,"""It hasn't dropped below 20 percent on your average basket of groceries; it's as high as 35 percent against some of the more expensive of the big four. That will continue,"" he pledged."
walmart,2017-2,"Industry data published on Tuesday showed Aldi has overtaken the Co-operative <42TE.L> to become Britain's fifth largest supermarket with a market share of 6.2 percent, having attracted 826,000 more shoppers year-on-year in the past quarter and grown total sales by 12.4 percent, helped by an extensive programme of store openings. [nL5N1FS1RK]"
walmart,2017-2,"""Customers are voting with their feet,"" said Barnes. ""This year has started with a bang, we are growing fantastically. February started extremely strongly,"" he said."
walmart,2017-2,"The CEO was critical of analyst reports and rivals' rhetoric which suggest Aldi's sales at stores open over a year, or like-for-like sales, have flatlined or even turned negative."
walmart,2017-2,"""Our like-for-like sales are still positive, very positive. I'm very happy with our like-for-like sales and they will remain positive for this year,"" he said, while adding like-for-like sales were not regarded internally as a key performance indicator for the business."
walmart,2017-2,"Barnes did not provide any figures. Privately-owned Aldi does not publish regular sales, or like-for-like sales, updates."
walmart,2017-2,"Aldi was deliberately opening stores to take away, or ""cannibalise"", sales from existing ones that were too busy, often with all tills open and the car park full, Barnes said."
walmart,2017-2,"""There is such a thing as good cannibalisation,"" he said, arguing Aldi was increasingly a victim of ""misinformation""."
walmart,2017-2,"""This insistent talk of things slowing down. Where's the evidence of that?"" he asked. ""It's peddled by people with a very strongly vested interest in the big four ... I don't lose a millisecond of sleep on what they say."""
walmart,2017-2,"Barnes said that while Aldi remained committed to being the lowest priced in the market, it was not immune to the sector's inflationary pressures, given the slump in the pound following Britain's vote last year to leave the European Union which has raised import costs."
walmart,2017-2,"""I'm very clear there will be price inflation this year and that will happen throughout the market,"" he said, noting a big move in meat prices last week."
walmart,2017-2,"But he said Aldi was better placed to cope than rivals because 77 percent of its sales come from British sourced products and it could rely on the ""unwavering"" financial support of its huge German owner Aldi Sud."
walmart,2017-2,"""History will show you that in times of inflation shoppers do begin to consider more the value end of the market. They broaden their horizons, that's a huge opportunity for us,"" said Barnes."
walmart,2017-2,"Aldi, which currently trades from nearly 700 UK stores, is targeting 1,000 by 2022, by which time it may have Morrisons, the No. 4 player, in its sights."

walmart,2017-2,* Asda to exploit Wal-Mart's buying power to cut prices
walmart,2017-2,"LONDON, Feb 8 (Reuters) - Wal-Mart is throwing its weight as the world's largest retailer behind its struggling British arm Asda after admitting it was too slow to respond effectively to the threat posed by the discount supermarkets."
walmart,2017-2,Asda thrived for a decade as Britain's cheapest supermarket after it was bought by Wal-Mart in 1999 and remains the third-biggest in the country.
walmart,2017-2,"But German-owned Aldi [ALDIEI.UL] and Lidl [LIDUK.UL] have steadily cut into Asda's market share. The two discounters started opening stores in the UK in 1990 and 1994, respectively, but their big breakthrough came when the economic crisis hit in 2008 and more British shoppers were prepared to give them a go."
walmart,2017-2,"Declining sales show signs of tapering off since Wal-Mart veteran Sean Clarke became Asda's president and chief executive last July, with a focus on improving the look and feel of the stores as well as enhancing product lines."
walmart,2017-2,"Wal-Mart will provide further firepower by ensuring Asda leverages the parent's purchasing strength in everything from refrigerators to own-brand products and real estate to drive down prices and costs, said Scott Price, chief administrative officer of Walmart International."
walmart,2017-2,"""One thing that maybe we would criticise ourselves for is that we didn't start the repositioning of the business sooner, that we didn't focus more on the leverage opportunities so that Asda was able to invest more aggressively in price,"" Price told Reuters in an interview."
walmart,2017-2,"""What Sean is able to do with his global experience at Wal-Mart is to know what levers to pull,"" he said, in a reference to Clarke's time with Wal-Mart in Japan, Canada and most recently as chief executive in China."
walmart,2017-2,"Working more closely with its parent, Asda will be able to market more Wal-Mart brands as its own at a lower price than rivals, Price said."
walmart,2017-2,"""He's able to pull private (Wal-Mart) brands and put an Asda brand on it that is equal to the national brand in the UK in terms of quality and sensory, but at a price that no one else can match,"" he said of Clarke."
walmart,2017-2,"In return, Wal-Mart was looking for more ways to exploit the areas where Asda has excelled, for example with a popular olive oil originally sourced by Asda and now sold across the group, including in the United States and 10 other international markets."
walmart,2017-2,"From its headquarters in Leeds in northern England, Asda claimed to be the first of Britain's major grocers -- which also includes market leader Tesco , No. 2 Sainsbury's and No. 4 Morrisons -- to spot the threat from the discounters."
walmart,2017-2,"With fewer stores in the more affluent southeast of England than its rivals and the vast majority of its business in the large stores that have become less fashionable in recent years, Asda was most exposed."
walmart,2017-2,"After it lost its price advantage and failed to offer other reasons to shop there, performance slumped."
walmart,2017-2,"Wal-Mart added to Asda's problems by diverting key executives from Britain to the United States and focusing too much on cutting costs and maximising short-term profit at the expense of investing to protect market share, analysts said."
walmart,2017-2,"The result has been nine straight quarters of underlying sales decline since the middle of 2014, which translated into a more than 1 percentage point loss in market share, according to researcher Kantar Worldpanel. Its share currently stands at 15.6 percent, versus more than 28 percent for Tesco."
walmart,2017-2,"David Cheesewright, CEO of Walmart International, in June expressed disappointment at Asda's weak performance and said it would shift from protecting profit to protecting market share."
walmart,2017-2,"The data shows signs of improving. In November Asda reported a like-for-like sales decline of 5.8 percent for the third quarter to Sept. 30, compared to the second quarter when it reported a fall of 7.5 percent, its worst drop in quarterly sales."
walmart,2017-2,"A further material improvement is expected when it reports fourth quarter sales on Feb. 21, with analysts forecasting a decline of 2-3 percent. Monthly industry data has also shown a better performance over Christmas and January."
walmart,2017-2,"While sales fell 1.9 percent year-on-year by value in the 12 weeks to Jan. 29, according to Kantar, Asda increased the number of shoppers visiting its stores."
walmart,2017-2,"The improvements reflect the early work of Clarke and former Sainsbury's executive Roger Burnley, who joined as chief operating officer in October, analysts said."
walmart,2017-2,"That includes making Asda stores cleaner and less cluttered, with more staff on the shop floor and better availability of fresh produce and meat -- key ranges that either drive customers into stores or, if you get them wrong, out."
walmart,2017-2,"Clive Black, analyst at Shore Capital, said there are also signs that Asda is stepping up product innovation with, for example, new items in the frozen and chilled areas and in its ""Extra Special"" premium brand."
walmart,2017-2,"At the same time Asda has developed complementary services and partners within its stores, such as with sports retailer Decathlon and butcher McGee's, while more freedom is being given to individual managers when it comes to the layout of their stores."
walmart,2017-2,"It looks likely to be a long road to recovery, however."
walmart,2017-2,"""Things are going a bit better but they're going a bit better from a catastrophic level of performance,"" one senior UK retail industry executive told Reuters, asking not to be named."
walmart,2017-2,"""Everybody thinks you can turn around a business in a year or two and you can't. This is a five-year project,"" he said."
walmart,2017-2,"He questioned whether Wal-Mart would provide the necessary investment. ""Their instinct is to save their way to victory."""
walmart,2017-2,Price said Wal-Mart was committed to Asda and has tasked Clarke with building a sustainable business model.
walmart,2017-2,"While Asda has said it will cut prices equating to 1.5 billion pounds of savings to the customer over five years from November 2013, washing through at about 300 million pounds a year, Price declined to say what additional investment was required in the stores."

walmart,2017-2,"LONDON, Feb 3 (Reuters) - British supermarkets have taken to rationing shoppers to three iceberg lettuces per visit after bad weather hit growing conditions in Spain, leading to a shortage in supplies that is set to continue through to March."
walmart,2017-2,"Tesco , Morrisons and Sainsbury's have all imposed restrictions on bulk purchases after production in Spain was hit by crop damage from flooding late last year followed by unusually cold weather last month."
walmart,2017-2,The limited supply of lettuces follows a continuing shortage of courgettes in Britain. Supplies of broccoli and aubergines have also been limited.
walmart,2017-2,The shortages add to the problems for UK supermarkets who are already facing inflationary pressures as a result of the weaker pound since Britons voted to leave the European Union last year.
