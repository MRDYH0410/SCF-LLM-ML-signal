walmart,2017-4,"NEW YORK, April 25 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Wal-Mart is rerouting the e-commerce race to the last mile. The $220 billion retailer may soon add another online merchant to its growing collection. More significant is the company's wider efforts to discount some web items if customers pick them up in stores."
walmart,2017-4,"Bonobo's, the New York-based men's fashion site, is set to join Wal-Mart's digital hodgepodge, according to Recode. It would go on the rack next to recently acquired women's-wear shop ModCloth and others. They in turn sit alongside Jet.com, which Wal-Mart bought last year for $3.3 billion in part to have the discount site's chief executive, Marc Lore, jumpstart its online presence."
walmart,2017-4,"Doing so may require the Bentonville behemoth to leverage its physical advantage. Wal-Mart isn't alone trying to solve this problem. Target , for example, said it would invest $7 billion over the next three years to get more people to click and then drive to stores to retrieve their purchases."
walmart,2017-4,"The biggest cost of getting a package to a customer's home is the end of the trip. This so-called last mile accounts for 80 percent of the shipping bill, analysts estimate. At Amazon , those expenses are rising quickly. Last year, it shelled out some $7 billion to cover shipping costs, 43 percent more than in 2015. Drones or driverless cars could be the answer someday, but not anytime soon."
walmart,2017-4,"For now, nine out of 10 Americans live within 15 minutes of one of Wal-Mart's 4,700 stores. Delivering to those from warehouses is a cheaper proposition, and Wal-Mart is ready to pass some of the savings on to shoppers. It's also one area where Amazon is trying to play catch-up. According to media reports, it plans to open 2,000 stores over the next decade."
walmart,2017-4,"The question is whether Wal-Mart and its bricks-and-mortar peers can convince enough customers to make the trip themselves. Pick-up savings vary, but for a $111 Coleman cooler, in one example, the discount was 4 percent. Another big challenge will be to make sure the web-to-store process is painless."
walmart,2017-4,"Only 3 percent of Wal-Mart's $500 billion in revenue comes from online purchases. With Amazon's top line on its heels, Wal-Mart may have to pick up the pace on the final part of the supply-chain course."
walmart,2017-4,"- Wal-Mart said that on April 19 it started offering discounts on certain products for customers who order online and pick up the items in its nearly 4,700 U.S. stores."
walmart,2017-4,"- The company also is in advanced discussions to buy online retailer Bonobos, according to an April 14 report in Recode. The Wall Street Journal reported an April 18 that the deal is worth about $300 million."
walmart,2017-4,- Wal-Mart's other e-commerce acquisitions include Jet.com in September 2016 for $3.3 billion; ShoeBuy for $70 million in December 2016; outdoor gear seller Moosejaw for $51 million in February; and women's-wear retailer ModCloth for an undisclosed sum in March.

walmart,2017-4,"CHICAGO, April 21 (Reuters) - Target Corp , Wal-Mart Stores Inc and other retailers are shelving considerations to move supply bases closer to the United States in the face of a possible border tax, banking instead on killing support for the tax idea in Congress."
walmart,2017-4,"President Donald Trump's push to impose a tax on imports, such as the 20 percent levy initiated by House Republicans, could raise U.S. consumer prices by as much as 25 percent, industry officials said.

walmart,2017-4,The decision by retailers to forestall supply chain investment in countries such as Bolivia and Romania to focus on lobbying Congress shows how Trump's ambitious agenda has instilled a new level of risk operating outside U.S. borders.

walmart,2017-4,"But it will be a long ride before it can stamp its products ""Made in USA."""
walmart,2017-4,"The loss of nearly one out four U.S. factories in the last two decades means parts for its bike frames and engines must be purchased in China, where the manufacturing supply chain moved years ago."
walmart,2017-4,"""There's just no way to source parts in America right now,"" said Monster Moto Chief Executive Alex Keechle during a tour of the company's assembly plant. ""But by planting the flag here, we believe suppliers will follow."""
walmart,2017-4,"Monster Moto's experience is an example of the obstacles American companies face as they, along with President Donald Trump, try to rebuild American manufacturing. U.S. automakers and their suppliers, for example, have already invested billions in plants abroad and would face an expensive and time-consuming transition to buy thousands of American-made parts if President Trump's proposed ""border tax"" on imported goods were to become law."
walmart,2017-4,"For now, finding U.S.-based suppliers ""remains one of the top challenges across our supplier base,"" said Cindi Marsiglio, Wal-Mart Stores Inc's vice president for U.S. manufacturing and sourcing. Wal-Mart partnered with Monster Moto and several other U.S. companies in a drive to increase spending on American-made goods by $250 billion by 2023 in response to consumer demand for American-made goods."
walmart,2017-4,"Their experience has shown Americans' patriotic shopping habits have limits, namely when it comes to price."
walmart,2017-4,"Take Monster Moto's bikes, which sell for between $249 to $749. Keechle, the CEO, says he can't raise those prices for fear his price sensitive prospective customers will turn to less expensive rivals made in China."
walmart,2017-4,"""Consumers won't give you a free pass just because you put 'Made in USA' on the box,"" Keechle says. ""You have to remain price competitive."""
walmart,2017-4,"Keeping a sharp eye on labor costs in their factory is one thing these U.S. manufactures can control. They see replacing primarily lower-skilled workers on the assembly line with robots on American factory floors as the only way to produce here in a financially viable, cost-competitive way. It's a trend that runs against the narrative candidate Donald Trump used to win the U.S. Presidency."
walmart,2017-4,"Since taking office, Trump has continued promises to resurrect U.S. manufacturing's bygone glory days and bring back millions of jobs. On March 31, Trump directed his administration to clamp down on countries that abuse trade rules in a bid to end to the ""theft of American prosperity."" [nW1N1GM01Z]"
walmart,2017-4,But it's more complicated on the ground for companies like Monster Moto.

walmart,2017-4,A White House official said that the Trump administration's efforts to encourage manufacturers to reshore production will be focused on cutting regulations and programs to provide new skills to manufacturing workers.

walmart,2017-4,"NEW YORK, April 12 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Eddie Lampert has what sometimes seems an unhealthy obsession with Sears . The top shareholder, chairman and chief executive increased his stake in the struggling $1.4 billion U.S. retailer even as it warned of a risk of bankruptcy last month."
walmart,2017-4,"Sears stands out even among a sorry group of once iconic mall-based department stores. Over the past 10 years, revenue has tumbled nearly 60 percent to $22 billion in the year to Jan. 28. Gross margins have been crushed. The purveyor of Kenmore vacuums and DieHard car batteries hasn't reported an annual profit in six years. Shares are down some 90 percent in a decade to under $14 apiece."
walmart,2017-4,"In its letter to investors reporting on 2015 performance, Fairholme pegged Sears' potential value at an eye-popping $147 per share. The numbers have moved around a bit since then. But Fairholme's thinking still arrives at a value north of $115 a share. That views Sears through the lens of real-estate investment trusts, not retailing. And it's why Berkowitz and his firm together own some 26 percent of the company, second only to Lampert and his ESL Investments' nearly 59 percent combined interest."
walmart,2017-4,"Fairholme is benchmarking Sears against REITs like Simon Property and GGP . Sears still owns or leases over 163 million square feet of retail space in 1,430 properties dotting all 50 U.S. states and Puerto Rico, according to figures in the company's most recent annual report."
walmart,2017-4,The average EV per square foot for Sears and 21 REITs was $260 per square foot at the time of Fairholme's letter.
walmart,2017-4,"One of the group, Seritage Growth Properties , was spun out of Sears in 2015. Seritage, which holds 266 stores and leases most of them back to Sears, is also somewhat tarred with the same brush. Its current enterprise value is about $3 billion. That's a little over $70 for each of its 42 million square feet. Fairholme owns shares in Seritage, too, and Warren Buffett is an investor in the REIT, unusually in a personal capacity rather than through Berkshire Hathaway ."
walmart,2017-4,"Then there's the problem of valuing mall real estate in the first place. The appeal of an individual store depends on many factors. For example, a down-at-heel Sears outlet in Rochester, New York sold for just over $1 million, according to Morningstar, while a profitable store in Hawaii brought in $200 million after GGP bought out the lease to redevelop the mall."
walmart,2017-4,"Moreover, there's simply too much retail space in the United States. Green Street Advisors estimates that 800 department stores would need to close to achieve the sales productivity levels last seen in 2006. Put another way, that's 20 percent of all the space occupied by mall anchor tenants across the nation."
walmart,2017-4,"Macy's has plans to shut 100 stores while J.C. Penney has said it will close up to 142 properties. Even Wal-Mart and Target are reducing their footprints. In a different consumer bracket, Ralph Lauren is ditching its New York City flagship location on Fifth Avenue."
walmart,2017-4,"The popularly floated alternative uses for boxy mall spaces, like laser tag arenas, intuitively can't be relied upon to fill more than a fraction of the empty space, either."
walmart,2017-4,"DOESN'T THAT MEAN MALL OWNERS SHOULD BE IN TROUBLE, TOO?"
walmart,2017-4,"Yes, in theory, though the market has different layers. REITs that own upscale shopping centers are less vulnerable than those in less wealthy areas. Class A malls make up less than 30 percent of malls but account for about 70 percent of sector value, according to a Cowen report."
walmart,2017-4,"Mall specialists have returned negative 15 percent to investors in the past year, according to brokerage BTIG, against a 6 percent positive return for the REIT sector as a whole. As Breakingviews' version of Fairholme's analysis shows, though, their real-estate holdings are still valued much more highly than Sears' own."
walmart,2017-4,Yet there is a head-scratching gap in the two valuations for essentially the same assets. Maybe the mini-surge in Sears' share price in recent days is a hint that investors are starting to find Berkowitz's logic more compelling.
walmart,2017-4,"- Sears warned in its annual report on March 21 that substantial doubt exists in the company's ability to continue as a ""going concern,"" though the U.S. retailer also said it had initiatives under way to mitigate this doubt."
walmart,2017-4,"- According to the company's annual proxy filing on March 31, Chairman and Chief Executive Eddie Lampert, along with related entities including his ESL Investments, owns or has warrants over 58.8 percent of Sears' common stock. Bruce Berkowitz and funds associated with Fairholme Capital Management have a 25.8 percent interest."

walmart,2017-4,"Online orders picked up in store already qualify for no shipping charges since the retailer saves on shipping fees. The latest discounts come on top of that. For example, a Vizio 70-inch 4K Ultra HD television priced at $1,698 for store pick up will qualify for an additional discount of $50."
walmart,2017-4,"Marc Lore, head of Wal-Mart's e-commerce operations, told Reuters in an interview on Tuesday he expects the move to boost transactions online and improve customer traffic in stores."
walmart,2017-4,"""This is a very material change in the value proposition we are offering customers,"" he said. Lore said Wal-Mart is able to offer these discounts as it is able to eliminate delivery costs by leveraging its fleet of more than 6,700 trucks to deliver products from warehouses to stores."
walmart,2017-4,"The decision to offer these discounts is the latest move by Lore to revamp an existing e-commerce offering from Wal-Mart. The change is expected to improve the retailer's competitive advantage by making its 4,700 U.S. stores more relevant to shoppers in a digital age, analysts said."
walmart,2017-4,"Lore has been at the forefront of bold moves Wal-Mart has undertaken to challenge Amazon since he took charge of the retailer's struggling online business in August, after Wal-Mart acquired Jet.com, a company Lore founded, for over $3 billion."
walmart,2017-4,"Since then he has acquired three online retailers, shuffled Wal-Mart's e-commerce decks and made two-day shipping free on all online orders over $35, without any membership fees, to compete with Amazon's popular Prime shipping program."
walmart,2017-4,These moves are in line with the broader push by Wal-Mart's Chief Executive Doug McMillon to give the retailer an even more dominant position in U.S. e-commerce.
walmart,2017-4,"Wal-Mart has been investing in e-commerce for the past 15 years, but it still lags far behind its Seattle-based rival."
walmart,2017-4,"Starting April 19, Wal-Mart will offer pickup discounts on 10,000 items and on more than 1 million products by June."
walmart,2017-4,"In a separate blog post, Mark Ibbotson, executive vice president of central operations, said Wal-Mart is expanding its same-day pick up service and is rolling out a pick-up tower - a giant vending machine that delivers packages ordered online when a customer enters a bar code - to more stores."

walmart,2017-4,"SAN FRANCISCO, April 6 (Reuters) - A sophisticated hacking group that pursues Chinese government interests broke into the website of a private U.S. trade group ahead of Thursday's summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, according to researchers."
walmart,2017-4,"The hackers left a malicious link on web pages where members of the National Foreign Trade Council (NFTC) register for upcoming meetings, according to researchers at Fidelis Cybersecurity and a person familiar with the trade group."
walmart,2017-4,"The nonprofit NFTC is a prominent advocate on international trade policy, with corporate members including Wal-Mart Stores Inc , Johnson & Johnson , Amazon.com Inc , Ford Motor Co and Microsoft Corp ."
walmart,2017-4,"The malicious link deployed a spying tool called Scanbox, which would have recorded the type and versions of software running on the computers of those exposed to it, said Fidelis researcher John Bambenek. Such reconnaissance is typically followed by new attacks using known flaws in the detected software, especially older versions."
walmart,2017-4,"Scanbox has only been used by groups associated with the Chinese government, Fidelis said, and was recently seen on a political site aimed at Uyghurs, an ethnic minority under close government scrutiny in China."
walmart,2017-4,"The breach was detected about five weeks ago by a NFTC director who is a customer of Fidelis, the security company said. Both the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the NFTC were notified and the malicious link removed, and Fidelis said it had no evidence of NFTC members being infected."
walmart,2017-4,The FBI and the NFTC declined to comment. A spokesman for the Chinese foreign ministry did not respond to a request for comment.
walmart,2017-4,"Bambenek said he believed the attack was classic espionage related to international trade talks, rather than a violation of a 2015 agreement between former U.S. President Barack Obama and Xi to end spying for commercial motives."
walmart,2017-4,"The summit starting on Thursday is the first meeting between Xi and Trump, who blamed China on the campaign trail for the loss of many U.S. jobs and vowed to confront the country's leaders on the matters of trade and currency manipulation."
walmart,2017-4,"""I think it's traditional espionage that happens ahead of any summit,"" said Bambenek. ""They would like to know what we, the Americans, really care about and use that for leverage."""
walmart,2017-4,Other security firms agreed that wholesale theft of U.S. intellectual property has not returned.
walmart,2017-4,"Instead, FireEye Inc and BAE Systems Plc said that the hacking group identified by Fidelis, called APT10, has recently attacked government and commercial targets in Europe."
walmart,2017-4,FireEye researcher John Hultquist said heavy industries in Nordic countries have been hacked more often as Beijing switches priorities.
walmart,2017-4,"""They are certainly taking those resources and pushing them to other places where they can still get away with this behavior,"" Hultquist said."

walmart,2017-4,April 5 (Reuters) - Hydrogen fuel cell maker Plug Power Inc said on Wednesday Amazon.com Inc had acquired the right to buy up to 23 percent of the company and that it would supply batteries to power forklifts used by the online retailer in its warehouses.
walmart,2017-4,Plug Power's shares closed 73 percent higher at $2.25 in heavy trading. Amazon shares rose as much as 1.9 percent to a record high of $923.72 before ending 0.3 percent higher at $909.28.
walmart,2017-4,"Latham, New York-based Plug Power was valued at $319 million as of Tuesday's market close. Amazon must spend at least $600 million over the life of its contract with Plug Power for its warrants to fully vest."
walmart,2017-4,"Amazon, the world's largest online retailer, will equip forklifts at 11 warehouses this year with hydrogen fuel cells so they can lift more goods before running out of juice, as well as charge faster, Plug Power's Chief Executive Andy Marsh said in an interview. Amazon will spend $70 million on the deal in 2017 and likely twice that next year, he said."
walmart,2017-4,"""Fulfillment centers are traditionally fairly low tech,"" said Marsh, explaining that labor as well as physical space could be freed up by moving away from batteries requiring lots of attention."
walmart,2017-4,"Amazon's deal with Plug Power could rekindle interest in makers of fuel cell companies, including Ballard Power Systems Inc and Hydrogenics Corp , whose shares were up about 6 percent."
walmart,2017-4,Fuel cell makers had become Wall Street darlings in 2014 as their technology was expected to be widely adopted in electric vehicles and forklifts.
walmart,2017-4,"However, the sector has lost favor with investors as the technology failed to gain traction."
walmart,2017-4,"Plug Power itself has lost more than two-thirds of its market value since the first quarter of 2014, when it was valued at more than $1 billion."
walmart,2017-4,Raymond James analyst Pavel Molchanov described the deal as one of the occasional bright spots that highlighted the potential for growth in the fuel cell industry.
walmart,2017-4,"Plug Power's narrow focus of powering forklifts with fuel cells, essentially makes the company the only player in the market, Molchanov said."
walmart,2017-4,"While only a tiny fraction of forklifts globally are powered by hydrogen fuel, Wal-Mart Stores Inc already uses the company's technology in its warehouses and is a top customer, Plug Power's Marsh said."

walmart,2017-4,"CHICAGO, April 5 (Reuters) - ABC Broadcasting has lost a last-ditch bid before South Dakota's highest court to avoid a trial in a beef producer's $5.7 billion defamation case over reports about a product that critics call ""pink slime."""
walmart,2017-4,The order signed on Monday by state Supreme Court Chief Justice David Gilbertson denied ABC's petition to appeal a recent ruling letting plaintiff Beef Products Inc (BPI) take its case to a jury.
walmart,2017-4,"In February, Judge Cheryle Gering of the Union County Circuit Court in Elk Point, South Dakota, said ABC, a unit of Walt Disney Co , and its reporter Jim Avila must defend against claims that they damaged BPI by referring in a series of reports to BPI's ""lean finely textured beef"" product as ""pink slime."""
walmart,2017-4,"Gering did not rule on the case's merits, nor did the Supreme Court."
walmart,2017-4,ABC declined on Wednesday to comment while BPI said in a statement it looked forward to holding the defendants accountable.
walmart,2017-4,The case is scheduled to go to trial on June 5 and could last eight weeks.
walmart,2017-4,"Lean, finely textured beef is made from beef chunks, including trimmings and exposed to tiny bursts of ammonium hydroxide to kill bacteria."
walmart,2017-4,"At the time of the ABC News broadcasts, few Americans realized the product was a mainstay of fast-food burgers, school lunch tacos and homemade meatloaf."
walmart,2017-4,"BPI said ABC's reports in March and April 2012 implied that the South Dakota-based company's product was not safe, not nutritious and not even meat."
walmart,2017-4,The network has called BPI's lawsuit an attempt to chill media coverage of the industry and inhibit free speech.
walmart,2017-4,"BPI has claimed up to $1.9 billion of damages, which could be tripled to $5.7 billion under South Dakota's Agricultural Food Products Disparagement Act."
walmart,2017-4,"The U.S. Department of Agriculture has called BPI's product safe. But some retailers, including Wal-Mart Stores Inc , stopped selling ground beef containing it after the ABC reports."
