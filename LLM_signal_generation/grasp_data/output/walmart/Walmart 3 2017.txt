walmart,2017-3,"WASHINGTON, March 27 (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday declined to hear a bid by retailers to revive a $7.25 billion antitrust settlement they reached with Visa Inc and Mastercard Inc over claims the card networks improperly fixed credit and debit card fees."
walmart,2017-3,The high court left in place a 2016 lower court decision that threw out the settlement on the basis that it was unfair to retailers that stood to receive no payments and derive no other benefits.
walmart,2017-3,The brief Supreme Court order noted that Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito did not participate in consideration of whether to take up the appeal. No reason was given.
walmart,2017-3,"The settlement had been intended to resolve claims that merchants were overcharged on interchange fees, or ""swipe fees,"" when shoppers used credit or debit cards, and were barred from directing customers toward cheaper means of payment."
walmart,2017-3,"The deal had been the largest all-cash U.S. antitrust settlement, although its value shrank to about $5.7 billion after roughly 8,000 retailers ""opted out."""
walmart,2017-3,"The New York-based 2nd Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals found that the accord was unfair to retailers that stood to receive no payments and, in the court's view, little or no benefit at all. It also decertified the case as a class action."
walmart,2017-3,"The circuit court's decision was a blow to the credit card industry, which hoped the settlement would end a decade of litigation brought on behalf of about 12 million retailers against Visa, MasterCard and banks that issue their cards."
walmart,2017-3,"Companies including Amazon.com Inc , Costco Wholesale Corp and Wal-Mart Stores Inc opposed the settlement and challenged it on appeal. Card issuers American Express Co and Discover Financial Services also objected to the settlement."
walmart,2017-3,"A federal judge in Brooklyn had approved the settlement in 2013, saying it offered significant damages and meaningful protections against future harm."
walmart,2017-3,Many retailers and trade groups objected. Some said the payout should have been higher while others said the settlement would have made it too difficult to sue Visa and MasterCard.
walmart,2017-3,"According to the National Retail Federation trade group, retailers pay roughly $60 billion annually in swipe fees, which typically average around 2 percent."
walmart,2017-3,"Card-issuing banks would have funded much of the settlement. JPMorgan Chase & Co and Bank of America Corp had estimated they were responsible for roughly one-fifth and one-tenth, respectively, of a payout."

walmart,2017-3,"BRASILIA/SAO PAULO, March 22 (Reuters) - A police investigation into alleged unsanitary and corrupt practices has badly damaged the reputation of Brazil's meatpacking industry and could wipe more than 10 percent off its global market share, Agriculture Minister Blairo Maggi said on Wednesday."
walmart,2017-3,"Maggi, a former state governor and a billionaire soy farmer, told a Senate Committee that his main concern was that China and Hong Kong have not yet taken a definitive stance on their bans of meat from Brazil, the world's biggest producer of beef and poultry."
walmart,2017-3,"China and Hong Kong are the top two importers of Brazilian meats, last year buying nearly one-third of the $14 billion worth of meat that Latin America's largest economy exported."
walmart,2017-3,"Maggi, speaking before a joint Senate committee, told lawmakers that if the government does not take quick action to tamp down the scandal, it could take Brazil up to five years to recoup the global market share it would lose."
walmart,2017-3,"The minister added that before the police investigation was made public last week, Brazil typically exported $64 million worth of meat a day, but that figure dropped to $74,000 on Tuesday."
walmart,2017-3,"The two-year investigation dubbed ""Weak Flesh"" has lodged accusations against more than 100 people, mostly health inspectors, for taking bribes and allowing the sale of rancid products, falsifying export documents, or failing to inspect meatpacking plants at all."
walmart,2017-3,"The probe by Brazil's federal police comes amid a sprawling three-year investigation into billions of dollars in political kickbacks paid by construction giants to win contracts with state-controlled firms, especially oil company Petrobras."
walmart,2017-3,"Hong Kong, Japan, Canada, Mexico, Switzerland and South Africa have all announced partial or all-out bans on Brazilian meat imports this week, following measures similar to those taken by China, the European Union, South Korea and Chile."
walmart,2017-3,"The industry took a domestic hit Wednesday, as Walmart Brasil said in a statement that it had suspended the sale of all products from 21 processing plants named so far by police as under investigation."
walmart,2017-3,"The Brazilian government had already banned exports from those 21 plants - but allowed them to continue production and sales to the domestic market, a move that has angered some watchdog groups."
walmart,2017-3,"""Is the health of a Brazilian consumer not worth the same as that of a foreigner?"" said Sonia Amaro, head of institutional relations at the Proteste consumer protection group. ""Brazilian industry has a history of this, of offering inferior or dangerous products to domestic customers while sending better goods overseas."""
walmart,2017-3,Maggi and other government leaders have aggressively tried to assure the public that this is not the case and that the meat supply does not pose any health risks. [nL2N1GW0KJ] [nE6N1G506F]
walmart,2017-3,"They say the problems uncovered by police are isolated events, that those involved will be fired, and that the investigation focuses mostly on corruption, not tainted products. [nL2N1GY0KQ]"
walmart,2017-3,"But Rafael Alcadipani, a professor of organizational studies at the Getulio Vargas Foundation in Sao Paulo, refutes the government's argument."
walmart,2017-3,"He said too little is yet known about the findings of the ongoing investigation, and that corruption is possibly a worse finding than batches of rotten meat. If inspectors were paid to not do their jobs, it is impossible to know if putrid products entered the market, Alcadipani said."
walmart,2017-3,"""Because Brazil has the world's biggest meatpackers, those businesses have huge influence with the government, so the government will go to all lengths to protect them,"" he said."
walmart,2017-3,"""Officials are clearly trying to focus attention away from the central question, which is whether or not there is systematic corruption in the sanitary system. Only allowing the investigation to play out will answer that."""

walmart,2017-3,"Albertsons has responded with consolidation. Cerberus, along with partners, bought 655 struggling Albertsons stores in 2006 and acquired the remaining 877 stores in 2013. Two years later Albertsons paid $9.4 billion for Safeway. The company's U.S. market share has surged to 5.4 percent from just 0.4 percent in 2012, making it the country's third-largest grocery operator behind Wal-Mart and Kroger , according to Euromonitor."
walmart,2017-3,"The Sprouts deal would add another important ingredient: organic specialties. Shopping for fresh, unrefined foods is expected to grow at a double-digit pace through 2021, according to TechSci Research. A deal would enable Albertsons to expand its organic lines and exploit Sprouts' private-label offerings."
walmart,2017-3,"Those benefits won't come cheap, though. Sprouts' stock price has already risen more than 20 percent since March 10. If Cerberus were to offer an additional 10 percent premium, it would be paying more than 17 times trailing operating income, well in excess of the 12 times multiple private-equity firm Apollo Global Management paid to buy another specialty grocer, Fresh Market, just last year."
walmart,2017-3,"The target also offers less alluring growth prospects. Traditional grocery stores have beefed up their organic offerings, making customers less likely to wander into specialty markets like Sprouts. The company's annual revenue growth has slowed to 13 percent last year from 36 percent in 2013."
walmart,2017-3,"Albertsons probably won't be the last grocer to open up its pocketbook. But if supermarkets want to acquire shoppers, they shouldn't be expecting any discounts."
walmart,2017-3,"- Albertsons has held preliminary merger talks with Sprouts Farmers Market, according to a Bloomberg report on March 19 citing people familiar with the situation. The company, which is backed by private-equity firm Cerberus Capital Management, filed for an initial public offering in 2015 but has not listed shares. Cerberus first invested in Albertsons in 2006. In 2015, the company paid $9.4 billion for rival supermarket chain Safeway."

walmart,2017-3,"LONDON, March 16 (Reuters) - Sainsbury's , Britain's second biggest retailer, cautioned that cost price pressures would weigh on its business this year as it reported a small decline in underlying sales over the last three months."
walmart,2017-3,"An almost 18 percent devaluation of the pound versus the U.S. dollar and a 12 percent fall against the euro since last June's Brexit vote, which has driven up import costs, combined with commodity price fluctuations, is making life harder for Britain's supermarkets."
walmart,2017-3,"""When we talk about uncertainty those factors weigh very heavily on underlying cost prices and therefore retail prices,"" Sainsbury's Chief Executive Mike Coupe told reporters on Thursday."
walmart,2017-3,"""We would acknowledge that we've gone from an environment which has been deflationary for two and a half years to being inflationary,"" he said."
walmart,2017-3,"While a return to food price inflation, in moderation, could be welcomed by investors in grocery stocks as it can boost sales and profit margins, the flip side is that rising inflation could begin to squeeze consumers' purchasing power."
walmart,2017-3,"Coupe said Sainsbury's, which last year expanded in areas such as electrical goods when it bought Argos-owner Home Retail for 1.1 billion pounds ($1.4 billion), had done a lot to mitigate cost price pressures within its supply chains and would continue to cut costs to try to limit price rises for shoppers."

walmart,2017-3,* Underlying full-year profit rises for first time in five years
walmart,2017-3,"LONDON, March 9 (Reuters) - Morrisons , Britain's fourth biggest supermarket chain, warned more expensive food imports were creating uncertainties after a new management team delivered a first rise in annual profit in five years."
walmart,2017-3,"Shares in Morrisons, which trails market leader Tesco , Sainsbury's and Asda in annual sales, fell as much as 6 percent after the group also flagged an increase of up to 50 million pounds ($61 million) in depreciation and pension costs in 2017-18. It also faces higher staff costs."
walmart,2017-3,"""There are some uncertainties ahead, especially around the impact on imported food prices if sterling stays at lower levels,"" the company said on Thursday."
walmart,2017-3,Morrisons said all the increased costs were incorporated into its plan and it was confident its turnaround was on track.
walmart,2017-3,"However, the stock was down 12.7 pence at 234 pence at 1110 GMT, the cautious comments taking some of the shine off an improved performance under Chief Executive David Potts."
walmart,2017-3,Former Tesco executive Potts joined Morrisons in 2015 with the job of reviving the group after it was damaged by the rise of discounters Aldi and Lidl in its northern England heartland.
walmart,2017-3,"Potts has delivered a steady improvement in trading, helped by more competitive prices, improved product ranges and availability and better customer service, resulting in a 22 percent rise in the firm's shares over the last year."
walmart,2017-3,All of Britain's supermarket chains are having to deal with higher import costs as the pound has fallen about 11.5 percent against the euro and 19 percent against the U.S. dollar since June's Brexit vote.
walmart,2017-3,"The intensely competitive nature of Britain's food market means it is hard for grocers to pass on those increased costs to consumers. However, industry data published on Tuesday showed food inflation has doubled in a month. [nL5N1GK1TH]"
walmart,2017-3,Potts has also shed peripheral businesses and overhauled Morrisons' online strategy through a renegotiated agreement with distributor Ocado and a wholesale supply deal with Amazon .
walmart,2017-3,"""Overall the results are solid...but we don't see any material new positive surprises,"" said Bernstein analyst Bruno Monteyne."
walmart,2017-3,"Morrisons has recently been setting the pace in terms of UK industry sales. Sales at stores open over a year rose 2.5 percent year-on-year in its fourth quarter, while monthly industry data has indicated a positive start to 2017-18."
walmart,2017-3,Some analysts believe Morrisons is vulnerable to a stronger Tesco and a fightback from Asda in 2017.
walmart,2017-3,"However, Potts was relaxed. ""In the very end a stronger competitor makes for a stronger Morrisons because we learn from competitors but obsess about our customers,"" he told reporters."
walmart,2017-3,"Morrisons reported an 11.6 percent rise in underlying pretax profit to 337 million pounds for the year to Jan. 29, ahead of analysts' average forecasts, on turnover up 1.2 percent to 16.3 billion pounds."

walmart,2017-3,"Shares of the retailer plunged to 2-1/2-year lows in heavy trading. Many of its rivals fell, too, including deep discount chains that will now face tougher competition on prices. For investors, the news was a shocking reminder that U.S. retailing remains a cutthroat business."
walmart,2017-3,"Target vowed aggressive promotions at a meeting with analysts and investors, saying new brands and investments in technology and small stores will allow it to eventually win back market share."
walmart,2017-3,"Although its e-commerce operation is growing, Target reported its third straight quarter of lower sales from existing stores, citing ""unexpected softness"" at its stores."

walmart,2017-3,"The retail industry faces pressure from lackluster U.S. economic growth, intense competition from Amazon.com and other online rivals and concerns about President Donald Trump's planned border tax."
walmart,2017-3,"With Tuesday's announcement, Target's brand identity as a source for ""cheap chic"" fashion and other low-cost stylish goods is giving way to the push for lower prices, analysts said."

walmart,2017-3,{{20170228T162928.328+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-Target's wobbly aim will take time to correct(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are her own.)
walmart,2017-3,"NEW YORK, Feb 28 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Target Chief Executive Brian Cornell is asking for patience. The U.S. retailer reported abysmal quarterly results, missing expectations and wiping out some $5 billion of stock-market value in the process. Pressures from the likes of Wal-Mart and Amazon are clearly taking a toll. A 34 percent jump in online sales is encouraging but Target will continue to struggle with changing shopping habits."
walmart,2017-3,"The now $33 billion retailer known for its bull's-eye red-and-white logo said its adjusted earnings forecast for 2017 will be in the range of $3.80 to $4.20 per share, well below the $5 that analysts had previously forecast. Same-store sales are expected to decline rather than increase slightly, as analysts originally expected."
walmart,2017-3,"Cornell was blunt in his requests during an annual investors' day on Tuesday: Target is taking the long view and margins will take a hit. The firm plans to invest heavily - some $7 billion over three years - buffing up its stores, rolling out new brands, and re-evaluating its footprint of more than 1,800 stores in the United States, especially in urban areas."
walmart,2017-3,"Target is optimistic that it is in a strong financial position to pick up some market share as other retailers shoulder burdensome debt. Moody's reckons that nearly 14 percent of its retail and apparel portfolio, including the owner of J Crew and Gymboree, is now composed of distressed issuers - the largest showing since December 2009. In the meantime, Target is bracing for a wave of price cuts from these struggling peers as well as Wal-Mart, which is further squeezing its suppliers."
walmart,2017-3,"- Target on Feb. 28 forecast a low-single-digit decline in comparable sales for 2017, well below analysts' estimates, which pegged a 0.4 percent increase for the year."
walmart,2017-3,"- During the fourth quarter ending Jan. 28, sales fell 4.3 percent year-over-year to $20.7 billion. Same-store sales dropped 1.5 percent. Net income was $817 million, or $1.45 per share, compared to $1.4 billion, or $2.32 per share. Analysts were expecting $1.51 per share."
walmart,2017-3,"- ""Our fourth-quarter results reflect the impact of rapidly changing consumer behavior, which drove very strong digital growth but unexpected softness in our stores,"" said Brian Cornell, chairman and CEO of Target, in a statement."
