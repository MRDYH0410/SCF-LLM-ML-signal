walmart,2017-5,"May 29 (Reuters) - Even in the age of ""superstar firms,"" the logic of index investing holds."
walmart,2017-5,"New research details how a small number of companies - think Google, Amazon and Apple - have come to dominate their sectors, capturing a growing share of revenues and helping to create an economy featuring high corporate profits but a lower share of the pie for workers."
walmart,2017-5,"Commentators have concentrated on the economic, social and policy implications of superstar firms but the investment ones are also interesting, and not obvious."
walmart,2017-5,"While you might think that the trick to investing in an economy with a few winners and many also-rans is to identify the Amazons and buy them, this, of course, is much more easily done looking backward than looking forward."
walmart,2017-5,"One problem is that the research finds that the concentration rises in industries with faster technological change. While fast technological change seems to bring big winners and concentration - see Facebook, it also brings with it the risk that companies will be supplanted by other technology in the future."
walmart,2017-5,"Indeed, one of the named superstar firms is Wal-Mart, which as a mostly physical retailer is now seeing its own position hollowed out by the likes of Amazon. Or consider IBM, which surely would once have been thought of as a superstar but which now is notable more for its fondness for share buybacks than its strong returns as a stock."
walmart,2017-5,"The reality is that a winner-take-all-society is a risky society, and that applies as much to investors as it does to college graduates or mid-career workers. It simply is not as simple as just figuring out who is 'winning' and climbing on board. A concentrated bet on superstar firms is very likely highly risky, not just in theory, as are all concentrated bets, but also in practice due to the rate of technological change."
walmart,2017-5,"Index investing, in contrast, will allow investors to be exposed to the rising, or persistently high, corporate margins which are a feature of a more highly concentrated economy. In other words, and sadly, the wise bet may not be on Amazon or Facebook, per se, but against labor."
walmart,2017-5,"While rising concentration and falling wages are new, it has long been a fact that the vast majority of the money made on the stock market comes via a tiny number of firms which skyrocket in value."
walmart,2017-5,"Hendrik Bessembinder of Arizona State University calculated in a recent study that just 86 stocks have, over 90 years, accounted for $16 trillion in wealth creation, or about half the total of wealth created by the entire universe of companies over that period."
walmart,2017-5,"The other 26,000 or so stocks created the other $16 trillion of wealth, but even that is a misleading guide to how well an individual stock might do. The top 1,000 stocks, or less than 4 percent of all companies traded over 86 years, account for all wealth creation."
walmart,2017-5,"It is notable too that superstar firms have risen, and wages fallen, during a period with rising globalization and a political and regulatory backdrop which allowed it to happen. It may well be that Google, Amazon and Facebook face new political and regulatory roadblocks to maintaining their position. This certainly is already true in China."
walmart,2017-5,1 - Try to identify some of the 86 superstars in advance. Good luck with that.
walmart,2017-5,2 - Buy stocks you think are among the 86 after they so prove and hope they hold their position. This strategy misses out on all of the gains these few superstar firms make before it dawns on you they've arrived. It also exposes you to huge risks that they are in turn supplanted.
walmart,2017-5,"3 - Buy a broad stock market index, including earlier-stage companies, and slowly build wealth by collecting the equity risk premium and allowing it to compound."
walmart,2017-5,The logic of choice 3 should hold as the balance between profits and labor evolves.

walmart,2017-5,"Sears, which sold its Craftsman tools brand to Stanley Black & Decker in March, said it had cut up to $700 million in costs to date since February as part of a program to reduce costs by $1.25 billion."
walmart,2017-5,"Sears CEO Eddie Lampert said on Thursday the results had ""clearly demonstrated"" the company's commitment to return to solid financial footing."

walmart,2017-5,"Bought into by Wal-Mart seven years ago in a $2.4 billion deal that gave the world's biggest retailer a foothold in several potentially high-growth markets in sub-Saharan Africa, Massmart has struggled with weakening economies and has therefore become more cautious in its expansion policy across the region."
walmart,2017-5,"The company, which sells everything from food to electronic devices and building materials, said comparable store sales for the first 21 weeks of the 2017 fiscal year fell 1.9 percent, with sales in South Africa down 0.4 percent and outside South Africa down by nearly 16 percent."

walmart,2017-5,"Once at the heart of executives' expansion plans, sub-Saharan Africa growth prospects were dealt a blow in mid 2014 with a fall in the prices of oil and other commodities - export mainstays for many local economies - partly due to a slowdown in demand from leading consumer China."

walmart,2017-5,"WASHINGTON, May 23 (Reuters) - The chief executive officers of two major American companies - retailer Target Corp and agribusiness Archer Daniels Midland Co - offered opposing views in a hearing before U.S. lawmakers on Tuesday on a proposed border adjustment tax."
walmart,2017-5,"Target CEO Brian Cornell has been one of the most vocal opponents of the Republican-backed border adjustment tax and testified alongside Juan Luciano, president and CEO of ADM, who spoke in favor of the proposal."
walmart,2017-5,"The border tax would imposes a tax on imports while providing a credit for exports and has been proposed by House Republicans as part of a larger tax code overhaul. Target is a big importer of goods, while ADM exports."
walmart,2017-5,"House Speaker Paul Ryan argues the proposed border tax, which is estimated to garner $1 trillion, will not affect prices and will allow rate cuts for businesses while not creating deficits, but retailers warn that it could raise consumer prices as much as 15 percent."
walmart,2017-5,Cornell and Luciano took staunchly different positions on the tax.
walmart,2017-5,"Luciano, on the other hand, argued that the tax would make American companies more competitive."
walmart,2017-5,"""A competitive tax code will help us continue providing American-made food and feed to our customers in the United States and abroad in the face of robust and, from a tax perspective, ever strengthening competition from abroad,"" he said."

walmart,2017-5,"Several Republican members of the committee expressed concerns about the tax during the hearing that stretched more than three hours, including Republican Representative Jim Renacci who argued the proposal could hurt small businesses that rely on imports."
walmart,2017-5,"Dimming the prospects more, lawmakers and lobbyists have begun to speculate that Congress will be unable to rally support for a sweeping tax code overhaul this year, and are beginning to look instead at cutting tax rates without broad reform."
walmart,2017-5,"The committee heard from two additional supporters of the tax, including William Simon, the former CEO of Wal-Mart Stores Inc , who despite his past with a large retailer that opposes the tax, endorsed the measure."
walmart,2017-5,"""We will see more good middle class jobs, a robust U.S. economy and an era of growth that will be led by a new industrial revolution,"" Simon said."
walmart,2017-5,"Lawrence Lindsey, the former director of the National Economic Council under President George W. Bush, also supported the tax."
walmart,2017-5,"Economist Kimberly Clausing, of Reed College, criticized the proposal, saying she disagrees with the argument by proponents that currency markets would prevent consumer prices from increasing."

walmart,2017-5,"NEW YORK, May 22 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Wal-Mart's online therapy may help revive ailing retailers. The $242 billion giant is starting to reap the benefits of embracing e-commerce while shares in digital laggards like Macy's and J.C. Penney plummeted after poor results. Unless they follow the behemoth's lead, they're likely to hand more market share to Wal-Mart and internet megastore Amazon ."
walmart,2017-5,"After years of fits and starts, Wal-Mart's revenue from online sales jumped by an impressive 63 percent in the first three months of the year, compared to the same period in 2016. What's more, executives attributed the rise largely to existing operations rather than to acquisitions like last year's $3.3 billion Jet.com deal."
walmart,2017-5,"Chief Executive Doug McMillon has achieved this by playing to people's desire to save money. Customers get discounts if they buy online and pick up in a store, for example. And two-day shipping for purchases of $35 or more is free. That even forced Amazon, which rarely imitates the competition, to lower its threshold for free shipping."
walmart,2017-5,"It's a relative bright spot in a troubled industry. Some are filing for bankruptcy, as teen fashion store Rue 21 did last week. Others missed estimates on poor sales, sending their shares into another nosedive after years of flat or falling revenue. Foot Locker , Dick's Sporting Goods , Macy's and J.C. Penney have lost between 16 percent and 24 percent in value over the past month on the back of bad earnings."
walmart,2017-5,"Like Wal-Mart, some have made a lot of noise about buying online stores, but keep mum about how much business they're getting. Macy's would only say that it's increasing by double digits. Chief Financial Officer Karen Hoguet argues that it's ""almost impossible"" to break out digital sales because of all the ""cross-channel activity."""

walmart,2017-5,{{20170519T135140.683+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-Review: Democrats' chief firebrand fumbles message(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are her own.)
walmart,2017-5,"WASHINGTON, May 19 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Elizabeth Warren's latest book reads like a marker for a 2020 White House campaign. In ""This Fight is Our Fight,"" the U.S. senator from Massachusetts blasts familiar targets like lobbyists and Wall Street, plus a new foe: President Donald Trump. Tales of struggling Americans are engagingly woven into the outrage. Still, her rote views limit her appeal."
walmart,2017-5,"In just four years in the Senate, Warren's national profile has risen quickly. Her impassioned speeches criticizing bankers made her a darling among liberals. That vitriol is on stark display in the book. She also lists the mistakes the Democratic Party made in 2016. However, her solutions are more like empty campaign slogans: demand democracy, build opportunity and fight."
walmart,2017-5,"Towards the end of the book, Warren reveals she contemplated running for the presidency in 2016 and discussed it with her husband - a Harvard professor, as she used to be. He warned that a presidential campaign would be ""a lot worse"" than her 2012 Senate race, when she was ridiculed for claiming Native American heritage. ""Talking with Bruce and asking the question out loud had settled it,"" Warren writes. ""I wanted to stay buckled down and keep doing my job."""
walmart,2017-5,"Trump's improbable victory and chaotic first months have added urgency to the search for a candidate capable of challenging him in 2020. The TV tycoon mused in April that Warren might be his next rival. She has what Hillary Clinton lacked: the ability to rally the Democratic base. As she writes, ""I now start every day by reminding myself that Hillary Clinton beat Donald Trump by nearly three million votes."""
walmart,2017-5,"The main lesson Warren appears to have learned from the 2016 campaign is to double down on her anger. She doesn't present any new or unexpected ideas. Indeed, the most surprising disclosure comes on the book's first page, where Warren reveals that she and her husband spent election night watching ""Ballers,"" an HBO comedy starring Dwayne Johnson, the actor and former wrestler known as The Rock."
walmart,2017-5,"The rest of ""This Fight is Our Fight"" is classic Warren, attacking corporations and the rich who fight for tax loopholes and less regulation at the expense of average Americans. She illustrates those struggles with tales of everyday hardship."
walmart,2017-5,"There is Gina, a North Carolina resident who got a business degree and worked as a sales representative while her husband was a roofer. Later on, Gina is working at Wal-Mart while her husband's assignments are spotty. Their income is cut in half. ""What happened?...Nothing. No crisis. No accident. No tale of woe,"" Warren writes. ""Just the grinding wear and tear of an economy that doesn't work any more for families like Gina's."""
walmart,2017-5,"Warren rightly points out that growing GDP and rising stocks don't necessarily mean prosperity for ordinary citizens. But to blame Gina's woes on a bubbly equity market seems disingenuous. It's the kind of zero-sum rationale that Trump has embraced. If China and other countries are doing better, it must be at the expense of the United States."
walmart,2017-5,"Warren criticizes wealthy Republican donors like the Koch brothers, but not Democrat-supporting hedge fund billionaires such as Tom Steyer and George Soros. She also reiterates her ill-advised scorn for former Lazard banker Antonio Weiss, who withdrew from a Senate-confirmed job in President Barack Obama's administration after Warren opposed him. Though the revolving door between Wall Street and Washington has its drawbacks, financial experience is helpful in some government positions."
walmart,2017-5,"Democrats have a chance to recapture the White House in 2020. The popular backlash to the planned repeal of Obama's healthcare reforms could cost Trump votes in many states that backed him last November. Probes into his campaign's links with Russia could delay a promised tax overhaul and infrastructure spending. The president's erratic and questionable actions, like his decision to fire FBI Director James Comey, seem certain to further undermine his approval ratings."
walmart,2017-5,"During the 2016 campaign, Warren proved she could get under Trump's skin with tweet storms that matched the president's own. Her fans love her persistence and tough talk. But to take the White House as a Democrat she will have to win over a broader base of supporters. The broken-record rhetoric in this book will do little to entice them."

walmart,2017-5,"CHICAGO, May 18 (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc on Thursday reported higher-than-expected quarterly sales at established U.S. stores, as investments to bring more customers into the discount retailer paid off and a bigger push into e-commerce boosted online purchases, sending its shares flirting near a 52-week high."
walmart,2017-5,"Wal-Mart and analysts said the company is benefiting from a $2.7 billion investment to increase entry-level wages and enhance the training of its workforce, which has led to better stocked shelves and cleaner stores. It said store visits rose 1.5 percent, the tenth consecutive quarterly increase."
walmart,2017-5,"Earlier in the day, shares of Wal-Mart rose to $77.40 - a 52-week high. They were trading at $77 in mid-day."
walmart,2017-5,"Wal-Mart's efforts to close the gap with rival Amazon.com has started gaining momentum even as other retailers like department store chains struggle. Online sales for the Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer rose 63 percent in the first quarter, which was higher than 29 percent growth in the fourth quarter and 20 percent in the third quarter."
walmart,2017-5,Online sales added 0.8 percentage points to the first quarter comparable sales gain. Growth in the business has been picking up after Wal-Mart said in October it would slow down new store openings to focus on expanding its e-commerce business.
walmart,2017-5,"U.S. e-commerce chief Marc Lore told reporters in a call that online sales growth was boosted by offering free two-day shipping without membership fees, and higher repeat orders. ""We need to scale our e-commerce business further and see some additional strength in our store comps to deliver the results we know we're capable of,"" said Chief Executive Officer Doug McMillon."
walmart,2017-5,"The company said most of the internet sales growth was from existing online operations rather than from acquisitions. Wal-Mart, which acquired Jet.com in 2016, this year alone has snatched up online retail startups Shoebuy, Moosejaw and Modcloth, and is currently in talks with small online clothing retailer Bonobos.

walmart,2017-5,"Wal-Mart said sales at U.S. stores open at least a year rose 1.4 percent, excluding fuel price fluctuations, and was the 11th consecutive quarterly increase. Analysts were expecting a 1.3 percent increase, according to Consensus Metrix."

walmart,2017-5,"Quarterly revenue rose 1.4 percent to $117.5 billion, slightly lower than analysts expectations of $117.7 billion due to a stronger dollar, which reduces the value of overseas sales. Revenue grew 2.8 percent on a currency neutral basis."

walmart,2017-5,{{20170512T154341.753+0000}}LPC: Coach's Kate Spade buy offers retail M&A blueprintBy Lynn Adler and Leela Parker Deo
walmart,2017-5,"NEW YORK, May 12 (Reuters) - Handbag maker Coach Inc's US$2.4bn purchase of designer and smaller luxury handbag and accessories maker Kate Spade & Co, backed by up to US$2.1bn in bank loans, shows that US retailers are opening their purses to buy rivals to boost profits, bankers and analysts said."
walmart,2017-5,"More mergers and acquisitions designed to bolster competitiveness would drive up retail M&A lending, after a 66% drop in 2016 to US$18bn from US$53bn in 2015 as the sector continues to face stiff challenges from online retailers."
walmart,2017-5,"""As more retailers feel pressured to grow revenue and profitability in a very challenging retail environment, equity markets remain robust and access to capital remains fairly cheap, M&A activity will continue and even accelerate,"" said Mickey Chadha, senior credit officer at Moody's Investors Service."
walmart,2017-5,"Coach, which has investment-grade ratings of Baa2 by Moody's, BBB by Fitch and BBB- by S&P, was put on alert for a possible downgrade by Moody's and Fitch, based on the added debt it is taking on for the purchase."
walmart,2017-5,Kate Spade's non-investment grade credit ratings of Ba3 by Moody's and BB- by S&P could be revised upward after the acquisition on an improved financial risk profile.
walmart,2017-5,"Two days after the announcement of Coach's acquisition of Kate Spade, clothing retailer Abercrombie & Fitch Co said it is in preliminary talks with several companies interested in a tie-up."
walmart,2017-5,"PetSmart Inc, operator of more than 1,500 pet stores, agreed to buy online pet retailer Chewy Inc in April, and Wal-Mart Stores Inc purchased e-commerce company Jet.com last August to boost their online business."
walmart,2017-5,"Coach secured a commitment from Bank of America Merrill Lynch for up to US$2.1bn under a 364-day senior unsecured bridge term loan facility to finance its Kate Spade buy. Coach has US$4.5bn of global revenue, according to Moody's."
walmart,2017-5,"Coach plans to put permanent funding in place via an US$800m six-month loan and a US$300m three-year loan as well as US$1bn of senior unsecured notes before the merger closes, which is expected in the third quarter."
walmart,2017-5,"Mergers driven by cost savings make sense even for retailers without immediate financial pressures, amid declining traffic to brick and mortar stores, and heavy sales promotions as well as weak teen spending on apparel, according to Moody's."
walmart,2017-5,"Competition in the sector has pulled median secondary bids for US retail loans lower since the start of the year to 99.1 on May 11 from 99.9 on January 4, according to Thomson Reuters LPC data, and could erode further if bankruptcies accelerate, several bankers said."
walmart,2017-5,"""Payless (ShoeSource) filed for bankruptcy protection in April, J Crew's term loan is trading in the 60s, and there's a lot of concern about mid-level retail stores that are in the malls in particular,"" a senior banker said."
walmart,2017-5,"Retail companies looking to bolster e-commerce and overcome difficult store locations and other issues make strategic corporate marriages increasingly likely, and could encourage more investment-grade retailers to snap up junk-rated rivals following Coach and Kate Spade's example, according to the banker."
walmart,2017-5,"""We'll see a lot of M&A if there is value in the franchise, if the name carries panache and interest by customers,"" he said. ""Kate Spade is one of those."""

walmart,2017-5,"Hart's plan calls for spending $1.6 billion to expand and remodel 1,300 U.S. stores, and open 400 new stores mainly in Florida, Texas and on both coasts by end of 2018. He also pledged Aldi will be willing to change prices more frequently to respond to rivals if needed."

walmart,2017-5,"WHEATON, Ill., May 11 (Reuters) - German grocery chain Aldi Inc is trying to beat the world's biggest retailer at its own game: low prices."
walmart,2017-5,"Already with 1,600 U.S. stores, Aldi has set a minimum target of selling groceries at a 21 percent discount to its U.S. rivals, including Wal-Mart Stores Inc , Chief Executive Jason Hart told Reuters."
walmart,2017-5,"His strategy, previously unreported, centers on adding more private-label goods, which are a retailer's in-house brands, to win over price-sensitive customers, and a massive expansion to further disrupt a U.S. grocery sector that has seen 18 companies go bankrupt since 2014."
walmart,2017-5,"Hart's plan calls for spending $1.6 billion to expand and remodel 1,300 U.S. stores, and open 400 new stores mainly in Florida, Texas and on both coasts by end of 2018. He also pledged Aldi will be willing to change prices more frequently to respond to rivals if needed."
walmart,2017-5,"""We are re-merchandising, remodeling, enhancing our product range and are focused on gaining volume so more customers start their shopping at Aldi and we are able to complete their shopping lists moreso than we have in the past,"" said Hart, who added Aldi's U.S. sales have doubled in five years."
walmart,2017-5,"Though it only accounts for only about 1.5 percent of the U.S. grocery market, Aldi is growing at 15 percent a year, whereas Wal-Mart currently controls about 22 percent of the market and its U.S. sales are estimated to grow about 2 percent this year, according to analysts."
walmart,2017-5,"""We have not seen anything like this in the grocery sector in the United States before,"" said Scott Mushkin, managing director of Wolfe Research and a leading pricing analyst."
walmart,2017-5,Such heated competition risks a dangerous race to the bottom that could result in more retailers shutting their doors.
walmart,2017-5,"""Given Aldi's expansion, Lidl's entry, Wal-Mart's response and Amazon's growing ambitions in this space, it is fair to expect a significant acceleration in the bankruptcy and liquidation cycle in this sector over the next few years,"" said Burt Flickinger, managing director at retail consultancy Strategic Resource Group. For more on Wal-Mart's stock performance vs Amazon, click [L1N1IC270]"
walmart,2017-5,"Aldi, has a simple strategy to win more customers: everyday low pricing, according to Hart."
walmart,2017-5,"""We don't confuse our customers with yo-yo discounts, sales, coupons and loyalty cards that require membership fees,"" he said."
walmart,2017-5,"Four analysts and consultants contacted by Reuters confirmed Aldi now offers the lowest prices in private label consumer products in the states it operates, although they did say Wal-Mart is gaining ground in the states they are conducting price tests."
walmart,2017-5,Hart said Aldi's internal studies show its prices are 21 percent lower than its lowest-priced rivals and the discount retailer intends to keep the advantage at least that strong going forward.
walmart,2017-5,"Depending on the product, Aldi's prices are cheaper than most rivals' private label items and even most branded items, analysts said. Hart said the 21 percent difference in price is calculated by monitoring competition on a basket of groceries."
walmart,2017-5,"Aldi counts on its no-frills shopping experience to help keep costs low, and limits much of its inventory to items that sell in huge volume. But its focus on offering far more private label items than branded products is central to allowing Aldi to adjust pricing whenever it chooses, Hart said."
walmart,2017-5,"Aldi and Wal-Mart do no break out the figures, but analysts including Mushkin and Flickinger say Aldi carries about 1,200 stock keeping units (SKUs) or type of products, 90 percent of which are private label. Wal-Mart stocks about 30,000-40,000 SKU's of products similar to ones Aldi sells, and only 30 percent of that are private labels."
walmart,2017-5,"That different product mix can potentially make it more difficult for Wal-Mart to adjust prices because it often first needs buy-in from suppliers, and many times faces push back from packaged goods makers like Procter & Gamble , Unilever and even smaller brands. Such vendors fear steep discounting can erode the value of their brands, analysts said."
walmart,2017-5,A Wal-Mart spokesman declined comment saying the company would not comment on a competitor's strategy. P&G and Unilever did not respond to Reuters requests seeking comment.
walmart,2017-5,But the explosive growth in private label products is on the radar of Wal-Mart Chief Executive Doug McMillon. Last month he told analysts that private label goods will play an even more important role as the widespread availability of branded products online will compress those products margins over time.
walmart,2017-5,"""Aldi is disrupting the sector the way Wal-Mart did when they started,"" said Strategic Resource Group's Flickinger."
walmart,2017-5,Aldi's aggressive push to remodel its stores will allow it to add new private label merchandise in rapidly growing categories like fresh food.
walmart,2017-5,"""The remodels are aimed at increasing our volumes which means more purchasing power that will help us lower prices further,"" said Scott Patton, Aldi's vice president of corporate buying."
walmart,2017-5,"At a recent visit to an Aldi store in Wheaton, Illinois Reuters found newer-looking shelves, wider aisles and brighter lighting than a typical Aldi store. There was also a bigger assortment of fresh, organic, gluten-free products and antibiotic-free meats versus what it stocked earlier - categories Aldi said is growing the most rapidly at its stores."
walmart,2017-5,"For example, its Simply Nature range of private-label products grew 53 percent to $300 million in 2016 from a year ago."
walmart,2017-5,"Aldi has also opened stores close to Wal-Mart's supercenters to benefit from its budget-conscious shoppers. Its total store count of 2,000 stores by the end of next year will be about 42 percent of Wal-Mart's U.S. store base."

walmart,2017-5,"LONDON, May 5 (Reuters Breakingviews) - It may not just be the clothing designs that need more imagination at Marks & Spencer . The British high street retailer named Archie Norman as its new chairman, days after hiring a new boss for its troubled fashion unit. His retail nous will bolster M&S' turnaround plans. Yet the appointment is the latest in a series of safe choices that underestimate the changes sweeping retail."
walmart,2017-5,"That makes him a valuable sounding-board for Chief Executive Steve Rowe, who is trying to overhaul M&S. A stint as a conservative parliamentarian might help Norman read Brexit's political runes. And the announcement on May 3 that former Halfords Chief Executive Jill McDonald will head up the troubled clothing and homewares business frees up Rowe to tackle fundamental problems such as reducing fixed costs, possibly with further store closures."
walmart,2017-5,"- Marks and Spencer on May 5 announced that it has appointed Archie Norman as the group's new chairman, replacing Robert Swannell who will retire on Sept. 1."
walmart,2017-5,"- Norman was previously chairman of ITV, Lazard London and Hobbycraft and was formerly the chief executive of grocer Asda."
walmart,2017-5,- The company's shares were up 5.4 percent to 377 pence by 1005 BST on May 5.

walmart,2017-5,"NEW YORK, May 3 (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc said on Wednesday it was considering getting certified under a new international program that could help companies defend themselves against isolated cases of corruption or poor business practices."
walmart,2017-5,"The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) developed the so-called anti-corruption compliance program and Wal-Mart is hoping to be the first U.S. company to get certified under it, said Jay Jorgensen, Wal-Mart's executive vice president and global chief ethics and compliance officer."
walmart,2017-5,"""We have begun looking for a company that would certify us,"" Jorgensen told the Thomson Reuters Financial and Risk Summit in New York."
walmart,2017-5,The ISO is the world's largest developer and publisher of international standards.
walmart,2017-5,"Jorgensen added that Wal-Mart was interested in seeing the program develop in the United States, with the government laying out its own anti-corruption compliance framework or adopting ISO standards to help protect companies that follow it and defend themselves if something goes wrong."
walmart,2017-5,"Jorgensen also shared a recent development in which federal agencies have contacted the Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer about compliance programs."
walmart,2017-5,"""Over the past couple of months ... some of the federal agencies have reached out to say 'hey do you have any feedback for us, anything we are doing is unreasonable?,'"" Jorgensen said."
walmart,2017-5,"Wal-Mart has given feedback to federal agencies and will continue doing so and the company would also be open to speaking with state regulators about compliance, he said."
walmart,2017-5,Jorgensen cited an example of how a broken baby shampoo bottle in California is treated as hazardous waste that retailers have to dispose off through an incinerator.
walmart,2017-5,"""We would love it if California would say 'hey we would like some feedback,"" Jorgensen said."
walmart,2017-5,"Jorgensen, who joined Wal-Mart in 2012, has been instrumental in revamping Wal-Mart's compliance systems around the world and building a dedicated ethics and compliance team. That team has a staff of over 2,300, including over 500 in the United States and over 1,800 in international markets."
walmart,2017-5,"Since 2013, Wal-Mart has invested more than $141 million in global ethics and compliance systems, Jorgensen said."
walmart,2017-5,"More recently, Wal-Mart has created licensing teams that monitor the more than 56,000 licenses and permits Wal-Mart needs to operate in global markets using a centralized licensing system that reduces the error of wrongdoing and increases transparency, he said."
walmart,2017-5,"For the last four years, the Wal-Mart board's compensation committee has conditioned a portion of its most senior executives' compensation on making adequate progress toward annual compliance goals. In its latest compliance report, Wal-Mart said it has achieved over 200 of these board-level objectives, including over 60 that relate specifically to its anti-corruption program."
walmart,2017-5,Wal-Mart's ethics and compliance system came into focus after a New York Times report in 2012 found Wal-Mart had engaged in a multi-year bribery campaign to build its Wal-Mart de Mexico business.
walmart,2017-5,"This was followed by an investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice into potential misconduct by Wal-Mart, including violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in some overseas markets including China, Brazil, India and Mexico. In October, Wal-Mart rebuffed a proposal by U.S. prosecutors to pay at least $600 million to settle a corruption probe into the company's practices in markets including Mexico, India and China."
walmart,2017-5,So far Wal-Mart has spent about $800 million on legal fees and an internal investigation into the alleged payments and to revamp its compliance systems around the world.

walmart,2017-5,"LONDON, May 3 (Reuters) - British supermarket Sainsbury's warned a challenging market meant it could take up to five years to deliver sustainable profit growth, despite a robust performance from general retailer Argos which it bought last year."
walmart,2017-5,"Sainsbury's, which trails market leader Tesco in annual sales, reported a third straight fall in annual profit on Wednesday, hurt by price cuts and cost inflation, and confirmed analysts' forecasts for another decline in 2017-18."
walmart,2017-5,"Last year Sainsbury's expanded in areas such as electrical goods when it bought Argos-owner Home Retail for 1.1 billion pounds ($1.42 billion), which it said has gone well so far."
walmart,2017-5,"""Our job is to build a business for the future,"" said Chief Executive Mike Coupe, who outlined his strategy for the business two and a half years ago."
walmart,2017-5,"Shares in Sainsbury's were down 5 percent at 265.5 pence at 1034 GMT, valuing the business at 5.8 billion pounds and taking the year on year decline to nearly 7 percent."
walmart,2017-5,"""The UK grocery industry is one of the most challenging, if not the most challenging, in the world ... (but) we think over a three to five year period we can deliver strong and steady profit growth,"" he told reporters."
walmart,2017-5,Sainsbury's said Argos contributed a better than expected profit of 77 million pounds in the second half and would deliver a 160 million pounds boost to earnings six months early. It also said it would speed up a plan to open 250 Argos Digital stores in its supermarkets.
walmart,2017-5,"Sainsbury's made an underlying pretax profit of 581 million pounds in the year to March 11, down from 587 million pounds made the year before. The average forecast by analysts was 578 million pounds."
walmart,2017-5,"The result reflected intense price competition, driven by German discounters Aldi and Lidl, as well as cost inflation, offset by cost savings of 130 million pounds and the contribution from Argos."
walmart,2017-5,"Group sales rose 12.7 percent to 29.1 billion pounds, but Sainsbury's' own like-for-like sales fell 0.6 percent. [nL5N1GT18G]"
walmart,2017-5,"""Unlike its domestic rivals Tesco and Morrisons , like-for-like sales at Sainsbury' have remained stubbornly negative recently. Lower prices, weaker margins and a falling market share. Not a good combination,"" said George Salmon, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown."
walmart,2017-5,Morrisons and Tesco are both in turnaround mode after going through disastrous periods while Sainsbury's market share has remained broadly stable over the last five years.
walmart,2017-5,"Some analysts believe Sainsbury's is vulnerable to further price cuts by Tesco and a recovering Asda and the supermarket's Chief Financial Officer Kevin O'Byrne said he was comfortable with an average profit forecast of 573 million pounds for 2017-18, meaning a drop for yet another year."
walmart,2017-5,Some analysts also say Argos increases Sainsbury's exposure to the threat of Amazon [AMZN.O] and to higher import costs at a time when pressure on discretionary purchases is building as inflation grows and wage growth is muted. ($1 = 0.7736 pounds)
