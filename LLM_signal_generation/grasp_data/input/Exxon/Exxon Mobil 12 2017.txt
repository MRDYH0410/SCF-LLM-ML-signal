{{20171229T095725.480+0000}}Digitale Konzerne dominieren Börsen-Rangliste - Chinesen auf VormarschMünchen, 29. Dez (Reuters)

* Apple bleibt mit 876 Mrd Dollar teuerstes Unternehmen der Welt

* Tencent und Alibaba brechen in amerikanische Phalanx ein

* SAP als wertvollstes deutsches Unternehmen nur auf Rang 62

München, 29. Dez (Reuters) - Tencent<0700.HK> und Alibaba auf dem Vormarsch: Chinesische Internet-Konzerne sind im zu Ende gehenden Jahr in die amerikanische Phalanx der wertvollsten Unternehmen der Welt eingebrochen. Zwar bleiben Apple, die Google-Muttergesellschaft Alphabet und Microsoft an der Spitze der globalen Börsen-Rangliste (Stand: 27. Dezember), wie die Unternehmensberatung EY (Ernst & Young) errechnet hat. Doch haben sich mit Tencent und Alibaba auf den Plätzen sieben und acht zum ersten Mal überhaupt zwei chinesische Unternehmen in die Top Ten vorgearbeitet. Beide haben ihren Börsenwert 2017 mehr als verdoppelt - auf 484 Milliarden und 444 Milliarden Dollar. Vor zwei Jahren lagen sie noch auf den Rängen 28 und 20. Spitzenreiter Apple 2017 einen Kurssprung von 41 Prozent hingelegt und ist nun 876 Milliarden Dollar wert.

Deutsche und europäische Unternehmen rangieren weiterhin unter ferner liefen. Europas Nummer eins ist der britisch-niederländische Ölkonzern Royal Dutch Shell, der mit einem Börsenwert von 276 Milliarden Dollar auf Rang 17 liegt. Unmittelbar dahinter folgt mit dem Nahrungsmittelkonzern Nestle (264 Milliarden Dollar) das erste schweizerische Unternehmen. Auch die Schweizer Pharmakonzerne Roche (213 Milliarden, Rang 31) und Novartis (195 Milliarden, Rang 37) liegen noch deutlich vor dem deutschen Börsen-Krösus SAP. Er erreicht in der weltweiten Rangliste mit einem Marktwert von 135 Milliarden Dollar Platz 62 und ist damit auch der wertvollste europäische IT-Konzern.

"Der digitale Wandel geht in Europa noch zu langsam voran", schließt EY-Deutschland-Chef Hubert Barth aus der Rangliste. Nur in der IT- und Online-Wirtschaft ließen sich an den Börsen hohe Wertzuwächse erzielen. "In Europa dominieren dagegen noch die traditionellen Industriebranchen." Sieben der zehn teuersten Unternehmen der Welt bauen auf digitale Geschäftsmodelle. Sogar Berkshire Hathaway, die Investmentgesellschaft von Anlage-Guru Warren Buffett, die auf traditionelle Branchen baut, musste Amazon und Facebook vorbeiziehen lassen und wurde zum ersten Mal seit Jahren aus den Top fünf verdrängt. Der US-Ölkonzern Exxon Mobil fiel von Platz fünf auf elf.

SIEMENS-RIVALE GE STÜRZT TIEF

Großer Verlierer im Ranking ist aber General Electric. Der Siemens-Rivale verlor in diesem Jahr fast die Hälfte seines Börsenwerts und stürzte von Platz 10 auf 54 ab. Dabei ist der Wert der 100 wertvollsten Unternehmen der Welt im Schnitt um fast 26 Prozent auf 20,2 Billionen Dollar gestiegen. Mit einem Marktwert von jeweils mehr als 100 Milliarden Dollar haben es sechs deutsche Konzerne in die Top 100 geschafft. Sie erreichten im Schnitt ein Kursplus von 27 Prozent, sind mit 662 Milliarden Dollar zusammen aber gerade einmal so viel wert wie Microsoft allein.

Siemens kommt mit 117 Milliarden Dollar weltweit auf Platz 72, Bayer folgt mit 104 Milliarden Dollar auf Rang 84 und lässt den Rivalen BASF (102 Milliarden, Platz 89) einmal mehr hinter sich. Der einzige deutsche Finanzkonzern von Weltrang ist die Allianz (103 Milliarden, Platz 85). Die deutsche Autoindustrie ist nur mit Volkswagen vertreten. Die Wolfsburger schafften mit einem Börsenwert von 101 Milliarden Dollar (Platz 94) nach dem Diesel-Skandal die Rückkehr in die Elite-Liga.

With new gas deals, Egypt closes in on energy hub goal - 路透新闻

{{20171228T111351.000+0000}}With new gas deals, Egypt closes in on energy hub goalCAIRO, Dec 28 (Reuters)

* Egypt government wants to be major energy hub by 2021

* Well-developed oil, gas infrastructure in place

* ENI, BP making advances in production

By Patrick Werr

CAIRO, Dec 28 (Reuters) - Egypt is set to inaugurate a new wharf for natural gas and petroleum product tankers on the Gulf of Suez in the coming days, another step in its plan to become a regional energy hub.

The new 2.5 km wharf is being built by SUMED, which for decades has operated two pipelines from the Red Sea to the Mediterranean.

The wharf will have three berths to receive natural gas and petroleum products carriers. It is due to be completed by the end of the month, Al-Masry Al-Youm newspaper quoted SUMED chairman Mohamed Abdel-Hafez as saying. Abdel-Hafez confirmed the remarks in a text message to Reuters.

The country has been building fuelling depots for ships along the Suez Canal and expanding its refining capacity. It has an extensive pipeline network and two idle gas liquefaction plants ready to export new gas as it arrives.

SUMED, owned 50 percent by the Egyptian government and the rest by Arab oil exporters in the Gulf, is spending $415 million to expand its facilities, mainly at the Red Sea end.

It is also building nine 300,000 cubic metre petroleum storage tanks and loading and offloading facilities. The tanks are due to be completed by the end of 2018, Abdel-Hafez said.

NBK-Egypt provided $300 million in financing for the project, the bank said in May.

The country believes its strategic location straddling the Suez Canal and the land bridge between Asia and Africa and its well developed infrastructure will help turn it a trading and distribution centre for countries in the region and beyond.

A slew of announcements of new gas production and the expansion of its infrastructure have helped advance the plan.

Italy's Eni this month delivered the first gas from Egypt's giant offshore Zohr field, whose estimated 30 trillion cubic feet (tfc) makes it the biggest gas field in the Mediterranean, and BP delivered the first gas from another offshore field, Atoll, north of Port Said.

Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi's government has announced the hub approach part of its energy policy, but still faces logistical and political obstacles to its goal.

"By the beginning of 2021, Egypt will be a main regional hub for gas and crude oil," Petroleum Minister Tarek El Molla told a press conference last month.

CHEAP SUPPLY ROUTE

Energy analysts say the cheapest way for Egypt's neighbours to send their gas supplies abroad would be through Egypt's two unused liquefaction plants, but this is complicated by legal and logistical problems or by financial constraints.

"The lack of a political framework between all these countries is still an obstacle," said Riccardo Fabiani, a Middle East and North Africa analyst at Eurasia Group.

Sisi on Nov. 20 also visited Cyprus, where he discussed construction of a pipeline to deliver gas to Egypt from Cyprus's Aphrodite field, and a delegation representing Israel's Tamar gas field came to Cairo to discuss possible imports into Egypt.

Officials from Exxon Mobil have also recently held talks with Egypt to discuss investments in oil and gas.

One plan now is to reverse the flow on the pipeline to send gas from Israel's 7 trillion cubic feet Tamar field and the roughly 20 tcf Leviathan field to Egyptian liquefaction plants.

But this has been stymied by a dispute over gas that Egypt failed to deliver after 2012. The late-November visit to Cairo by Tamar field negotiators was their second in as many months.

The Israelis may prefer to build a new undersea pipeline that would bypass Sinai to avoid sabotage or use a separate pipeline that Egypt has built to Jordan, Syria and Lebanon, analysts said.

The challenge with Cyprus's 4.5 tcf Aphrodite field is mainly economic. At current gas prices, it is not big enough to justify an undersea pipeline to Egypt unless more discoveries are made elsewhere in Cyprus, analysts say.

Alternative routes for Egypt's neighbours, such as direct pipelines to Turkey, Greece or Italy, could be prohibitively expensive because of the depth of the seabed.

"Egypt is the least bad candidate. And it is also going very fast, which gives it a head start," Fabiani said.

(Répétition sans changement d'une dépêche transmise vendredi)

NEW YORK, 26 décembre (Reuters) - Les valeurs malmenées à Wall Street cette année, ou qui n'ont pas eu les faveurs des analystes, pourraient retrouver des couleurs alors que l'année touche à sa fin, et les investisseurs tentés de les rejeter seraient bien inspirés d'y réfléchir à deux fois.

Le rally du S&P-500 <.SPX> a propulsé le PER à des niveaux inédits depuis 2002 si bien que les valeurs restées à l'écart pourraient attirer les investisseurs à la recherche des dernières bonnes affaires de 2017.

"Une stratégie anticonformiste consistant à acheter des valeurs malmenées pourrait être la bonne cette année", estime Tim Ghriskey, directeur des investissements chez Solaris Group.

Au cours des derniers mois, Tim Ghriskey a acheté des actions General Electric , dont la valeur a chuté de 45% depuis le début de l'année, en raison notamment des difficultés à opérer une transition du charbon et du gaz vers les énergies renouvelables. Selon Tim Ghriskey, le conglomérat créé il y a 125 ans, va renouer avec la croissance, ou encore être éclaté en plusieurs sociétés.

Quelques-unes des valeurs les moins performantes de 2016, comme Vertex Pharmaceuticals et l'équipementier médical Illumina , ont retrouvé des couleurs en 2017. Ces deux sociétés affichent depuis le début de l'année un gain d'au moins 69%.

Jake Dollarhide, à la tête du fonds Longbow Asset Management, a choisi de rééquilibrer ce mois-ci les portefeuilles de ses clients en investissant davantage dans Kroger et d'autres valeurs de la distribution malmenées par l'annonce en juin de l'acquisition par Amazon.com de Whole Food Markets.

Le titre Kroger a perdu 20% de sa capitalisation boursière depuis le début de l'année et son PER était de 14 contre 27 pour sa moyenne sur cinq ans.

"DOGS OF THE DOW"

La stratégie dite des "Dogs of the Dow" consiste à acheter chaque année les dix valeurs de l'indice l'indice Dow Jones <.DJI> dégageant le meilleur rendement du dividende.

Au bout d'un an, il recommence le même exercice en remplaçant éventuellement quelques titres par d'autres toujours en fonction du même critère.

Verizon Communications , International Business Machines et Exxon Mobil font partie de ces sociétés et proposent toutes des rendements du dividende d'au moins 3,7%.

Ces trois actions étaient aussi des "Dogs of the Dow" au début de l'année mais elles ont sous-performé. Un investisseur qui suit cette stratégie aurait en décembre dernier acheté également Boeing , qui a presque doublé de valeur en 2017, Caterpillar , qui est en hausse de 64% depuis le début de l'année, et Cisco Systems , qui a bondi de 28%.

Nike a subi une perte de 19% en 2016, ce qui en faisait la valeur du Dow la moins performante. Au cours des 12 derniers mois, l'équipementier sportif a cependant rebondi de 25%.

A cause, entre autres choses, de la concurrence accrue de Nike, Under Armour a chuté de 48% depuis le début de l'année, ce qui en fait le troisième titre le moins performant du S&P-500. En janvier dernier, la plupart des analystes recommandaient d'acheter les actions Under Armour et aucun n'était à la vente. A présent, les analystes sont majoritairement "neutres" sur le titre du spécialiste des pantalons de yoga.

Mais les analystes peuvent être faillibles: quatre des 10 actions les moins bien notées du S&P-500 à la fin de l'année dernière sont en passe de terminer 2017 avec des hausses annuelles supérieures au gain de 20% enregistré par l'indice.

Parmi celles-ci, on trouve la société de gestion des noms de domaine internet VeriSign , qui a bondi de 53%, et Emerson Electric , qui a pris 24%, dont une bonne partie le mois dernier après que le fabricant de systèmes d'automation industrielle eut renoncé à son offre sur Rockwell Automation. .

BAGHDAD, Dec 25 (Reuters) - Iraq has not yet reached an agreement with Exxon Mobil on a multibillion-dollar project to boost output from several southern oilfields, Oil Minister Jabar al-Luaibi said on Monday.

If no agreement is reached by February, Luaibi told journalists at a signing ceremony for a separate deal, the project would be offered to other companies.

Luaibi had said in October that Iraq was in final talks with Exxon Mobil on developing the project, which consists of building oil pipelines, storage facilities and a seawater supply project to inject water from the Gulf into reservoirs to improve production. [nL8N1MK523]

UPDATE 1-Chad reshuffles finance, other key ministries - decree - 路透新闻

{{20171224T205013.000+0000}}UPDATE 1-Chad reshuffles finance, other key ministries - decreeN'DJAMENA, Dec 24 (Reuters)

(Adds details, background)

N'DJAMENA, Dec 24 (Reuters) - Chad's President Idriss Deby on Sunday appointed Abdoulaye Sabre Fadoul as minister of finance and also named new economy, foreign affairs, security and justice ministers, a presidential decree showed.

Fadoul has served as interim finance minister since Deby sacked his predecessor, Christian Georges Diguimbaye, last month. The appointment comes amid stalled negotiations with Glencore over more than $1 billion in oil-backed loans Chad owes the commodities trader. [nL8N1NT43J] [nL8N1NL5GO]

Glencore lent the West African country's state oil firm SHT about $1.45 billion in 2014 to be repaid with crude oil. The loan was subsequently syndicated with several banks.

It was restructured in 2015 following the crash in global oil prices but Chad is again struggling to repay the debt. Funds from the International Monetary Fund depend on reaching new terms. [nL8N1NR3X3]

In October, Chad decided to redirect crude previously allocated to Glencore in a marketing agreement to Exxon Mobil instead starting from January, which has made negotiations fraught. [nL8N1N40CY]

Djimet Arabi, an adviser to Deby, was named the new justice minister in the reshuffle while Ahmadaye Abdelkerim Bokit takes over the security ministry.

The new foreign minister is Mahamat Zene Cherif, Chad's former permanent representative to the United Nations.

RPT-Wall St Week Ahead-This year's lumps of coal could be 2018's diamonds - 路透新闻

{{20171222T235435.886+0000}}RPT-Wall St Week Ahead-This year's lumps of coal could be 2018's diamondsSAN FRANCISCO, Dec 22 (Reuters)

(Repeats story with no changes)

By Noel Randewich

SAN FRANCISCO, Dec 22 (Reuters) - Investors saddled in 2017
with the market's worst performers, including Under Armour and
General Electric, may do well to remember as December draws to
an end that lumps of coal sometimes turn into diamonds.

As investment advisors rebalance clients' portfolios in the
final weeks of the year, the instinct to dump stocks that have
been left behind in surging markets - or that fall out of favor
with analysts - can be self-destructive.

With the S&P 500's rally pushing price/earnings multiples to
highs not seen since 2002, laggards overlooked by a rush to own
technology and other high-growth stocks may attract
bargain-hunting investors heading into 2017.

"A contrarian strategy of buying beaten-up names might have
a good year," said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer of
Solaris Group in Bedford Hills, New York.

Ghriskey in recent months bought shares of General Electric
, which has slumped 45 percent this year as it struggles
with a shift from coal and gas to renewable energy. He believes
the 125-year-old conglomerate will claw its way back to growth,
or might be split into multiple companies.

Some of the worst-performing stocks of 2016 roared back to
life in 2017, including Vertex Pharmaceuticals  and
medical device maker Illumina . Those two companies this
year have rebounded 69 percent or more.

As he rebalances clients' portfolios this month, Jake
Dollarhide, head of Longbow Asset Management in Tulsa, Oklahoma,
is investing more in Kroger Co  and other supermarkets
that took a beating after Amazon.com  said in June it
was buying Whole Food Markets.

Kroger has lost 20 percent year to date and it recently
traded at 14 times expected earnings, compared to its five-year
average of 27.

"Grocery is local; it's not an internet play. And Kroger has
the footprint to not even notice that Amazon is around,"
Dollarhide said.

Investors following the Dogs of the Dow investment strategy
each year buy components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average
with the highest dividend yield, betting that those stocks have
been oversold. Currently, those companies include Verizon
Communications , International Business Machines 
and Exxon Mobil , all with dividend yields of 3.7 percent
or more.

Those three stocks were also Dogs of the Dow at the start of
this year, and they have underperformed. But an investor
following that strategy last December also would have bought
Boeing , which has nearly doubled in 2017, Caterpillar
, which is up 64 percent, and Cisco Systems ,
which has risen 28 percent.

Dogs of the Dow
 Company Name                     YTD Total       Dividend

Return          Yield
 Verizon Communications Inc              3.7 pct        4.5 pct

IBM                             -4.3 pct        3.9 pct
 Pfizer Inc                      16.7 pct        3.7 pct
 Exxon Mobil Corp                -4.7 pct        3.7 pct
 Chevron Corp                     6.8 pct        3.6 pct
 Merck & Co Inc                  -1.8 pct        3.4 pct
 Coca-Cola Co                     14.9 pct        3.2 pct
 Procter & Gamble Co              12.3 pct        3.0 pct
 Cisco Systems Inc              32.8 pct        3.0 pct
 General Electric Co             -43.3 pct        2.8 pct
 Source: Thomson Reuters data, Dec 20 closing prices, Total
 Return includes dividends

Nike  in 2016 suffered a 19-percent drop, making it
the worst-performing Dow component. In the past 12 months,
however, it has surged back with a 25 percent rally.

Due partly to increased competition from Nike, Under Armour
 has slumped 48 percent year to date, making it the S&P
500's third-worst-performing stock. Last January, most analysts
recommended buying Under Armour's shares and none recommended
selling. Now, most analysts are neutral on the yoga-pant
pioneer.

Underscoring the fallibility of analysts, four of the 10 S&P
500 worst-rated stocks at the end of last year are on track to
finish 2017 with annual increases above the index's 20-perent
gain.

Among them, domain name registration provider VeriSign
 has surged 53 percent, while Emerson Electric 
has rallied 24 percent, with much of that gain in the past month
after the industrial-automation systems maker abandoned its bid
for Rockwell Automation Inc .

UPDATE 2-Norway's Supreme Court to hear Gassled pipeline case - 路透新闻

{{20171222T163915.699+0000}}UPDATE 2-Norway's Supreme Court to hear Gassled pipeline caseOSLO, Dec 22 (Reuters)

(Adds Njord Gas comment)

OSLO, Dec 22 (Reuters) - The Norwegian Supreme Court will hear an appeal from the owners of Gassled, Norway's gas infrastructure network, in a case involving the government's decision to cut pipeline tariffs, Njord Gas Infrastructure said on Friday.

In June 2017, a Norwegian appeals court ruled against the owners in a lawsuit that argued the cut in tariffs was unlawful and would cost them a combined 15 billion Norwegian crowns ($1.80 billion) in lost earnings through 2028. [nL5N1LU4M4]

The case against the government is pursued by four investment companies, Njord Gas Infrastructure, Solveig Gas, Silex Gas and Infragas, which hold a combined 43.9 percent in Gassled.

"We are absolutely delighted to go on Christmas break with this news," Njord Gas Chief Executive Birte Norheim told Reuters.

"It's an acknowledgement that the case has merit," she said.

While the Supreme Court has not yet set a date for the case, Njord believes it could be resolved by mid-to-late 2018, Norheim added.

The four firms were originally owned by Allianz , UBS , the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, Canada's Public Sector Pension Investment Board, the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and France's Caisse des Depots.

In October 2017, UBS and Caisse des Depots announced they were selling their stakes, but will still remain in line for any potential proceeds from a decision in favour of the Gassled partners, and will help pay the cost of litigation. [nL8N1MY4FE]

Some of the companies involved have said Norway's unexpected decision to lower gas transportation tariffs would hurt the image of Norway as a country to invest in.

The government cut tariffs shortly after the four investors bought their stakes in Gassled in 2011 and 2012 from ExxonMobil , Total , Statoil and Royal Dutch Shell for a total of 32 billion crowns.

A spokesman for Norway's Ministry of Petroleum and Energy declined to comment when contacted by Reuters. The Supreme Court was not immediately available for comment. ($1 = 8.3287 Norwegian crowns)

ATUALIZA 1-Governo publica MP sobre comercialização de petróleo do pré-sal pela PPSA - 路透新闻

{{20171222T161413.754+0000}}ATUALIZA 1-Governo publica MP sobre comercialização de petróleo do pré-sal pela PPSASÃO PAULO, 22 Dez (Reuters)

(Texto atualizado com mais informações e contexto)

SÃO PAULO, 22 Dez (Reuters) - O governo federal publicou nesta sexta-feira medida provisória que dispõe sobre a comercialização de petróleo e gás do pré-sal pela estatal PPSA (Petróleo e Gás Natural S.A. - Pré-Sal Petróleo S.A.).

Nas áreas do pré-sal, as petroleiras que venceram as licitações se comprometeram com o repasse de parte do petróleo produzido à União, o chamado "óleo lucro". É este produto que será comercializado pela PPSA, mas os procedimentos ainda precisavam de regulamentações adicionais.

Com a publicação da MP, a PPSA poderá comercializar a produção do campo de Mero, no bloco de Libra (Bacia de Santos), primeira área no pré-sal que foi licitada e que entrou em operação no mês passado.

A Petrobras, operadora do consórcio de Libra formado também por Shell , Total e as companhias chinesas CNPC e CNOOC, prevê que o primeiro embarque produzido em Mero deverá acontecer no início do próximo mês.

Segundo texto publicado no Diário Oficial, a MP autoriza a PPSA celebrar os contratos, representando a União, com agentes comercializadores ou comercializar diretamente petróleo, gás natural e outros hidrocarbonetos fluidos da União, preferencialmente por leilão.

Os gastos diretamente relacionados à comercialização deverão ser previstos em contrato firmado entre a PPSA e o agente comercializador ou entre a PPSA e o comprador e, na hipótese de licitação, também no edital.

A MP diz ainda que não serão incluídas nas despesas de comercialização a remuneração e os gastos incorridos pela PPSA na execução de suas atividades, tais como despesas de custeio e investimento e o pagamento de tributos incidentes sobre o objeto de sua atividade.

A comercialização pela PPSA observará a política estabelecida pelo Conselho Nacional de Política Energética (CNPE) e o preço de referência fixado pela reguladora ANP, de forma que somente poderá ser realizada por preço inferior ao de referência se não aparecerem interessados na compra, hipótese em que os preços praticados deverão ser compatíveis com os de mercado.

Ainda segundo texto publicado no Diário Oficial da União, o CNPE editará resolução com a nova política de comercialização de petróleo, gás natural e outros hidrocarbonetos fluidos até 31 de dezembro de 2018, e enquanto não for disciplinada a nova política a venda realizada diretamente pela PPSA será regida por ato do Ministro de Estado de Minas e Energia.

BREAKINGVIEWS-Big Oil's discipline reinforces shale's swing role - 路透新闻

{{20171222T145946.000+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-Big Oil's discipline reinforces shale's swing roleDALLAS, Dec 22 (Reuters Breakingviews)

(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are her own.)

By Lauren Silva Laughlin

DALLAS, Dec 22 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Big Oil is going to be disciplined in 2018. That doesn't necessarily mean less production, but it does mean going for cheaper, faster projects first. That only helps U.S. shale – and means more frustration for oil-producing countries that would like to see a higher price.

ConocoPhillips is one U.S. producer that has explicitly discussed a measured approach to future spending. In November, Chief Executive Ryan Lance told Reuters the company would limit production spending to $5.5 billion per year over the next three years, and it wouldn't invest in projects that required oil above $50 a barrel to make a profit. It's a common theme. Exxon Mobil , Occidental Petroleum , Royal Dutch Shell and their peers are all under pressure from shareholders to prove they can make money throughout the cycle.

Expensive, longer-term projects will be constrained as a result, while U.S. shale, among the fastest and least costly sources of oil in the world, will fill in the gap. In 2017, U.S. tight oil, as shale is also known, solidified its place as the market's swing producer even as OPEC, the oil world's dominant cartel, cut production. The International Energy Agency says that though the number of active U.S. rigs fell in 2017, output will continue to rise in 2018.

In the nearer term, OPEC's decision to extend its curbs on production until the end of 2018 will help keep a floor under prices. But shale's contributions will keep a lid on them. The U.S. Energy Information Administration sees oil hovering at $53 a barrel, with the International Monetary Fund's estimate slightly lower. Aiming for profit might keep some disciplined. But analysts expect returns on capital for the most focused tight-oil drillers to shoot up as a result of the higher prices wrought by OPEC. And $50 a barrel is plenty high enough for drillers in the Midland Basin in West Texas, who can cover their operating expenses at half that.

Unless new discoveries or technologies upend the energy sector, shale's influence will grow. The IEA says U.S. shale output in the 15 years to 2025 will match the highest sustained period of oil output growth by any single country in the history of the oil markets. By then the United States will be the largest liquefied natural gas exporter and, shortly after, a net exporter of oil. Shale has the power to keep oil prices subdued for a long time yet.

CONTEXT NEWS

- On Nov. 30, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and non-OPEC producers led by Russia agreed to extend oil output cuts until the end of 2018. The cartel also decided to cap the combined output of Nigeria and Libya at 2017 levels of less than 2.8 million barrels a day. Both countries had previously been exempt from production restraints.

- By October, commercial inventories in member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development had fallen to a level 140 million barrels above the five-year moving average, draining more than half the previous glut, according to OPEC.

À WALL STREET-Les valeurs délaissées en 2017 pourraient rebondir - 路透新闻

{{20171222T115314.285+0000}}À WALL STREET-Les valeurs délaissées en 2017 pourraient rebondirNEW YORK, 22 décembre (Reuters)

par Noel Randewich

NEW YORK, 22 décembre (Reuters) - Les valeurs malmenées à Wall Street cette année, ou qui n'ont pas eu les faveurs des analystes, pourraient retrouver des couleurs alors que l'année touche à sa fin, et les investisseurs tentés de les rejeter seraient bien inspirés d'y réfléchir à deux fois.

Le rally du S&P-500 <.SPX> a propulsé le PER à des niveaux inédits depuis 2002 si bien que les valeurs restées à l'écart pourraient attirer les investisseurs à la recherche des dernières bonnes affaires de 2017.

"Une stratégie anticonformiste consistant à acheter des valeurs malmenées pourrait être la bonne cette année", estime Tim Ghriskey, directeur des investissements chez Solaris Group.

Au cours des derniers mois, Tim Ghriskey a acheté des actions General Electric , dont la valeur a chuté de 45% depuis le début de l'année, en raison notamment des difficultés à opérer une transition du charbon et du gaz vers les énergies renouvelables. Selon Tim Ghriskey, le conglomérat créé il y a 125 ans, va renouer avec la croissance, ou encore être éclaté en plusieurs sociétés.

Quelques-unes des valeurs les moins performantes de 2016, comme Vertex Pharmaceuticals et l'équipementier médical Illumina , ont retrouvé des couleurs en 2017. Ces deux sociétés affichent depuis le début de l'année un gain d'au moins 69%.

Jake Dollarhide, à la tête du fonds Longbow Asset Management, a choisi de rééquilibrer ce mois-ci les portefeuilles de ses clients en investissant davantage dans Kroger et d'autres valeurs de la distribution malmenées par l'annonce en juin de l'acquisition par Amazon.com de Whole Food Markets.

Le titre Kroger a perdu 20% de sa capitalisation boursière depuis le début de l'année et son PER était de 14 contre 27 pour sa moyenne sur cinq ans.

"DOGS OF THE DOW"

La stratégie dite des "Dogs of the Dow" consiste à acheter chaque année les dix valeurs de l'indice l'indice Dow Jones <.DJI> dégageant le meilleur rendement du dividende.

Au bout d'un an, il recommence le même exercice en remplaçant éventuellement quelques titres par d'autres toujours en fonction du même critère.

Verizon Communications , International Business Machines et Exxon Mobil font partie de ces sociétés et proposent toutes des rendements du dividende d'au moins 3,7%.

Ces trois actions étaient aussi des "Dogs of the Dow" au début de l'année mais elles ont sous-performé. Un investisseur qui suit cette stratégie aurait en décembre dernier acheté également Boeing , qui a presque doublé de valeur en 2017, Caterpillar , qui est en hausse de 64% depuis le début de l'année, et Cisco Systems , qui a bondi de 28%.

Nike a subi une perte de 19% en 2016, ce qui en faisait la valeur du Dow la moins performante. Au cours des 12 derniers mois, l'équipementier sportif a cependant rebondi de 25%.

A cause, entre autres choses, de la concurrence accrue de Nike, Under Armour a chuté de 48% depuis le début de l'année, ce qui en fait le troisième titre le moins performant du S&P-500. En janvier dernier, la plupart des analystes recommandaient d'acheter les actions Under Armour et aucun n'était à la vente. A présent, les analystes sont majoritairement "neutres" sur le titre du spécialiste des pantalons de yoga.

Mais les analystes peuvent être faillibles: quatre des 10 actions les moins bien notées du S&P-500 à la fin de l'année dernière sont en passe de terminer 2017 avec des hausses annuelles supérieures au gain de 20% enregistré par l'indice.

Parmi celles-ci, on trouve la société de gestion des noms de domaine internet VeriSign , qui a bondi de 53%, et Emerson Electric , qui a pris 24%, dont une bonne partie le mois dernier après que le fabricant de systèmes d'automation industrielle eut renoncé à son offre sur Rockwell Automation. .

Governo publica MP sobre comercialização de petróleo do pré-sal pela PPSA - 路透新闻

{{20171222T101340.100+0000}}Governo publica MP sobre comercialização de petróleo do pré-sal pela PPSASÃO PAULO, 22 Dez (Reuters)

SÃO PAULO, 22 Dez (Reuters) - O governo federal publicou nesta sexta-feira medida provisória que dispõe sobre a comercialização de petróleo e gás do pré-sal pela estatal PPSA (Petróleo e Gás Natural S.A. - Pré-Sal Petróleo S.A.).

Nas áreas do pré-sal, as petroleiras que venceram as licitações se comprometeram com o repasse de parte do petróleo produzido à União, o chamado "óleo lucro". É este produto que será comercializado pela PPSA, mas os procedimentos ainda precisavam de regulamentações adicionais.

Segundo texto publicado no Diário Oficial, a MP autoriza a PPSA celebrar os contratos, representando a União, com agentes comercializadores ou comercializar diretamente petróleo, gás natural e outros hidrocarbonetos fluidos da União, preferencialmente por leilão.

Os gastos diretamente relacionados à comercialização deverão ser previstos em contrato firmado entre a PPSA e o agente comercializador ou entre a PPSA e o comprador e, na hipótese de licitação, também no edital.

A MP diz ainda que não serão incluídas nas despesas de comercialização a remuneração e os gastos incorridos pela PPSA na execução de suas atividades, tais como despesas de custeio e investimento e o pagamento de tributos incidentes sobre o objeto de sua atividade.

A comercialização pela PPSA observará a política estabelecida pelo Conselho Nacional de Política Energética (CNPE) e o preço de referência fixado pela reguladora ANP, de forma que somente poderá ser realizada por preço inferior ao de referência se não aparecerem interessados na compra, hipótese em que os preços praticados deverão ser compatíveis com os de mercado.

Ainda segundo texto publicado no Diário Oficial da União, o CNPE editará resolução com a nova política de comercialização de petróleo, gás natural e outros hidrocarbonetos fluidos até 31 de dezembro de 2018, e enquanto não for disciplinada a nova política a venda realizada diretamente pela PPSA será regida por ato do Ministro de Estado de Minas e Energia.

Wall St Week Ahead-This year's lumps of coal could be 2018's diamonds - 路透新闻

{{20171222T060000.000+0000}}Wall St Week Ahead-This year's lumps of coal could be 2018's diamondsSAN FRANCISCO, Dec 22 (Reuters)

By Noel Randewich

SAN FRANCISCO, Dec 22 (Reuters) - Investors saddled in 2017
with the market's worst performers, including Under Armour and
General Electric, may do well to remember as December draws to
an end that lumps of coal sometimes turn into diamonds.

As investment advisors rebalance clients' portfolios in the
final weeks of the year, the instinct to dump stocks that have
been left behind in surging markets - or that fall out of favor
with analysts - can be self-destructive.

With the S&P 500's rally pushing price/earnings multiples to
highs not seen since 2002, laggards overlooked by a rush to own
technology and other high-growth stocks may attract
bargain-hunting investors heading into 2017.

"A contrarian strategy of buying beaten-up names might have
a good year," said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer of
Solaris Group in Bedford Hills, New York.

Ghriskey in recent months bought shares of General Electric
, which has slumped 45 percent this year as it struggles
with a shift from coal and gas to renewable energy. He believes
the 125-year-old conglomerate will claw its way back to growth,
or might be split into multiple companies.

Some of the worst-performing stocks of 2016 roared back to
life in 2017, including Vertex Pharmaceuticals  and
medical device maker Illumina . Those two companies this
year have rebounded 69 percent or more.

As he rebalances clients' portfolios this month, Jake
Dollarhide, head of Longbow Asset Management in Tulsa, Oklahoma,
is investing more in Kroger Co  and other supermarkets
that took a beating after Amazon.com  said in June it
was buying Whole Food Markets.

Kroger has lost 20 percent year to date and it recently
traded at 14 times expected earnings, compared to its five-year
average of 27.

"Grocery is local; it's not an internet play. And Kroger has
the footprint to not even notice that Amazon is around,"
Dollarhide said.

Investors following the Dogs of the Dow investment strategy
each year buy components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average
with the highest dividend yield, betting that those stocks have
been oversold. Currently, those companies include Verizon
Communications , International Business Machines 
and Exxon Mobil , all with dividend yields of 3.7 percent
or more.

Those three stocks were also Dogs of the Dow at the start of
this year, and they have underperformed. But an investor
following that strategy last December also would have bought
Boeing , which has nearly doubled in 2017, Caterpillar
, which is up 64 percent, and Cisco Systems ,
which has risen 28 percent.

Dogs of the Dow
 Company Name                     YTD Total       Dividend

Return          Yield
 Verizon Communications Inc              3.7 pct        4.5 pct

IBM                             -4.3 pct        3.9 pct
 Pfizer Inc                      16.7 pct        3.7 pct
 Exxon Mobil Corp                -4.7 pct        3.7 pct
 Chevron Corp                     6.8 pct        3.6 pct
 Merck & Co Inc                  -1.8 pct        3.4 pct
 Coca-Cola Co                     14.9 pct        3.2 pct
 Procter & Gamble Co              12.3 pct        3.0 pct
 Cisco Systems Inc              32.8 pct        3.0 pct
 General Electric Co             -43.3 pct        2.8 pct

 Return includes dividends

Nike  in 2016 suffered a 19-percent drop, making it
the worst-performing Dow component. In the past 12 months,
however, it has surged back with a 25 percent rally.

Due partly to increased competition from Nike, Under Armour
 has slumped 48 percent year to date, making it the S&P
500's third-worst-performing stock. Last January, most analysts
recommended buying Under Armour's shares and none recommended
selling. Now, most analysts are neutral on the yoga-pant
pioneer.

Underscoring the fallibility of analysts, four of the 10 S&P
500 worst-rated stocks at the end of last year are on track to
finish 2017 with annual increases above the index's 20-perent
gain.

Among them, domain name registration provider VeriSign
 has surged 53 percent, while Emerson Electric 
has rallied 24 percent, with much of that gain in the past month
after the industrial-automation systems maker abandoned its bid
for Rockwell Automation Inc .

NEW YORK,21 décembre (Reuters) - La Bourse de New York a fini en hausse jeudi, valeurs de l'énergie et financières en tête, au lendemain du vote par le par le Congrès américain de réductions d'impôts susceptibles de doper les profits des entreprises et d'alimenter des rachats d'actions.

L'indice Dow Jones <.DJI> a gagné 55,64 points, soit 0,23%, à 24.782,29.

Le Standard & Poor's 500 <.SPX>, plus large, a progressé de 0,20% à 2.684,57 et le Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> a pris un modeste 0,06% à 6.965,36, freiné par le recul des technologiques.

La réforme fiscale promise par Donald Trump a été votée mercredi par le Congrès américain. Elle prévoit notamment une forte baisse du taux d'imposition sur les bénéfices des sociétés, ramené de 35% à 21%, une mesure susceptible de doper les profits des entreprises américaines et d'alimenter des rachats d'actions.[nL8N1OK5C1]

Un certain nombre d'entre elles, comme AT&T , Wells Fargo et Boeing , se sont engagées à augmenter les salaires et à investir dans la formation. D'autres ont prévu une hausse des bénéfices.

"L'impact (de la réforme) se fait encore attendre, les réductions d'impôts devraient augmenter les bénéfices. Mais on ignore de quelle manière elles modifieront la politique des entreprises en matière d'investissement, de rachats d'actions et de hausses de salaires", explique Terry Sandven, responsable de la stratégie chez U.S. Bank Wealth Management.

LES PÉTROLIÈRES DOPENT LE DOW

Sept des onze compartiments du S&P-500 ont terminé en hausse.

Le secteur de l'énergie <.SPNY> a réalisé la meilleure performance, avec un gain de 2,08%. Chevron , plus forte hausse du Dow, s'est octroyé 3,25%, après avoir atteint un pic de 124,60 dollars. Le groupe pétrolier a bénéficié d'un relèvement d'objectif du courtier Cowen &Co de près d'un tiers, à 160 dollars, qui anticipe des flux de trésorerie plus élevés. De son côté, Exxon a pris 0,98%.

En deuxième position, les financières ont engrangé <.SPSY> 0,85%. Goldman Sachs a pris 2,28% et JPMorgan 1,59%, soutenant la progression du Dow. Wells Fargo a avancé de 2,44%.

Les valeurs des services aux collectivités <.SPLRCU>, qui figurent parmi les secteurs considérés comme les moins susceptibles de profiter des baisses d'impôts, ont accusé le plus fort repli (-1,19%), devant les technologiques <.SPLRCT> (-0,29%). La santé <.SPXHC> a perdu 0,26%.

Aux valeurs, Boeing a cédé 0,96%. Le constructeur a confirmé discuté rapprochement avec son homologue brésilien Embraer . [nL8N1OL54C]

Nike a annoncé des résultats meilleurs que prévu, dopés par ses activités à l'international, mais la baisse de ses marges brutes témoigne d'une féroce guerre des prix en Amérique du Nord, son plus grand marché.[L8N1OL69P] Le titre du premier fabricant mondial d'articles de sport reculait de 0,3% dans les échanges d'après-Bourse.

Accenture a gagné 1,61% soutenu par des résultats trimestriels supérieurs aux prévisions, après avoir atteint un record de 158,40 dollars.

Plus forte baisse du S&P-500, la compagnie d'électricité PG&E a lâché 12,95%, à un creux de quatre ans, après avoir annoncé une suspension de dividendes évoquant des incertitudes quant à sa responsabilité dans les feux de forêts en Californie au mois d'octobre. RBC est passé à "performance en ligne" sur le titre contre "surperformance".

Quelque 6,08 milliards d'actions ont changé de mains sur les marchés américains jeudi, contre 6,88 milliards en moyenne sur les 20 dernières séances.

LE DOLLAR ÉVOLUE PEU

Les investisseurs ont également pris connaissance d'indicateurs mitigés. Le produit intérieur brut a été revu en légère baisse au troisième trimestre, à +3,2%, et les inscriptions au chômage la semaine dernière ont progressé de manière inattendue. [nL8N1OL3MK] [nL8N1OL3MK].

En revanche, l'indice manufacturier "Philly Fed" a affiché une hausse surprise en décembre. [nZON026R05]

Le dollar, qui a réduit ses gains face à un panier de devises de référence <.DXY>, après l'annonce de la révision du PIB, était quasiment inchangé.

Le rendement des Treasuries à 10 ans s'est lui aussi apaisé lui aussi après être revenu à plus de 2,50% pour la première fois en neuf mois .

BREAKINGVIEWS-Oil shareholders try capping sorry governance well - 路透新闻

{{20171221T211639.985+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-Oil shareholders try capping sorry governance wellDALLAS, Dec 21 (Reuters Breakingviews)

(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are her own.)

By Lauren Silva Laughlin

DALLAS, Dec 21 (Reuters Breakingviews) - The oil industry is infamous for governance spills, but shareholders are now trying to cap them. Carl Icahn has drummed up investor support against SandRidge Energy's adopting a poison pill after criticism of its $746 million offer for Bonanza Creek. Hess faces another fight with an activist. And Exxon Mobil is only slowly responding to owners' concerns.

For decades the industry has been racked by scandals, from the dodgy accounting that took down Enron to the bid rigging that undid Aubrey McClendon, founder of Chesapeake Energy . Plenty of other issues remain.

It's not as if shareholders have outrageous demands. Compensation structures are one bugbear: these have long rewarded executives for simply increasing assets rather than growing them profitably. Natural-gas producer EQT bowed to this pressure recently.

The reaction against the poison pill SandRidge put in place last month is hardly surprising. Such tactics rarely sit well with shareholders in any event. SandRidge, though, built in a lower-than-normal trigger point and included a clause that said shareholders couldn't act in cahoots. The company later appeared to soften its tone, clarifying the provision to say shareholders were allowed to meet – but only after Icahn had blasted the company, saying it "makes a banana republic look good."

Exxon, meanwhile, took some six months to respond to a shareholder vote at its annual meeting that demanded more disclosure on climate-change risks. It is also only now removing barriers that made it hard for its owners to meet with the company's board – whose job is to represent shareholder interests.

And Hess's poor stock performance has prompted Elliott Management to line up another activist campaign – even though two of its nominees from the first round in 2013 are still on the board.

Trouble is, such pressure may at best only bring energy companies' corporate governance up to speed with current basic practice. In effect, that means many in the sector are fighting past battles rather than ensuring their governance is prepared to tackle the uncertain future climate change will bring.

That requires ensuring everything from board composition to executive compensation to transparency about asset risks is aligned to cope with rising temperatures, argues Cornerstone Capital. The recent pushback by shareholders is welcome – but they need to turn up the heat.

CONTEXT NEWS

- On Dec. 20 Guggenheim Partners Investment Management said in a statement that it intends to vote its 12 percent stake in SandRidge Energy against the proposed acquisition of Bonanza Creek Energy.

- Last month activist investor Carl Icahn disclosed that his funds own more than 13 percent of the company's shares and said he opposed SandRidge's transaction.

- SandRidge then adopted a poison pill that would be triggered if the company's shareholders were deemed to be "acting in concert," a measure which Icahn said precluded the shareholders from discussing opposition to the transaction.

- Exxon Mobil has said it will allow shareholders to meet directly with board members, a practice the company previously did not permit, the Financial Times reported on Dec. 19. Shareholders previously met with investor-relations executives, but not board members. In May the company said that it used "in-person meetings, teleconferences, group meetings, and the annual webinar" to speak with investors. Those who wanted to contact board members, though, had to fill out an online form with a 2,000-character limit, the newspaper reported. In a statement, the company said: "The board has recently decided, where appropriate, to engage directly with key shareholders."

- On Dec. 14 Elliott Management said it was readying a new fight with oil company Hess because of the company's poor performance. Elliott won an activist campaign against Hess in 2013 allowing it to put three people on the company's board, two of whom still serve as directors. John Hess, son of the founder, is the chief executive of the company and is the top shareholder with 11 percent of the company's shares.

Canadian offshore oil interest grows as pipeline woes sink Alberta prices - 路透新闻

{{20171221T100552.036+0000}}Canadian offshore oil interest grows as pipeline woes sink Alberta pricesWINNIPEG, Manitoba, Dec 20 (Reuters)

By Rod Nickel

WINNIPEG, Manitoba, Dec 20 (Reuters) - Canada's offshore oil industry, a sliver of the country's crude sector, is drawing rising investment interest due to an aggressive push by Newfoundland and Labrador as prices plummet in oil-rich Alberta due to pipeline problems.

Offshore interest in the Atlantic province stands in contrast to Western Canada's oil fields, where foreign companies have sold some $23 billion worth of assets this year due to depressed prices.

ExxonMobil's Hebron off Newfoundland, Canada's easternmost province, became the country's first new producing offshore oil project in 12 years last month. [nL1N1NY195]

Newfoundland's offshore petroleum board has also issued exploration licences worth nearly C$2 billion ($1.6 billion) in promised spending since 2015, its biggest-ever three-year total.

The next round, to be held in autumn, has attracted a record-large 38 nominations for parcels to be made available for exploration in a single region.

Winning a bid entitles a company to explore the parcel for six years.

Offshore interest comes as western Canadian pipeline and rail capacity fills up, driving prices to four-year lows. [nL1N1OF2GB] The volume of crude in storage has hit record levels in western Canada driven by increased supply and a leak on TransCanada Corp's Keystone export pipeline last month.

Oil flowing from offshore Newfoundland by contrast is priced similar to Brent crude at a rich premium over western Canadian oil.

The investment spilling into Canada's icy waters is at least partly due to an aggressive promotional push by Newfoundland's energy corporation, Nalcor, and frustration with western transportation problems, said Paul Barnes, a Newfoundland-based director with Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers.

Oil companies "are likely taking some of that money that may have been earmarked for Alberta and putting it into offshore," Barnes said.

ExxonMobil is a "long-term investor" in Newfoundland, and also pursuing a potential exploration drilling project, spokeswoman Margot Bruce-O'Connell said.

Jim Keating, Nalcor's vice president of oil and gas, said he does not see a link between Alberta's pipeline problems and Newfoundland's appeal.

Companies that have recently invested offshore, such as BP PLC and Anadarko Petroleum Corp , are different than those most active in the oil sands, he said.

To be sure, Eastern Canada produced 213,000 barrels per day in 2016, the amount Western Canada pumps every 90 minutes. But further offshore capacity is already in the works. Husky Energy is expanding its Newfoundland project and expects first oil in 2022.

Wood Mackenzie analyst Nathan Nemeth said he does not link offshore interest with Alberta's bottlenecks, noting that Canadian Natural Resources and Suncor Energy have increased oil sands investments while reducing offshore exploration.

Newfoundland's appeal includes its relatively shallow water depths, a string of successful exploration wells, and a prospective basin size equivalent to the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, said Mark Oberstoetter, Wood Mackenzie's director of upstream Canada.

"Being on tidewater is a huge advantage," said Andrew Bell, chairman of Newfoundland and Labrador Oil & Gas Industries Association.

Norway's Statoil ASA said in December 2016 that it would sell all of its oil sands assets, even as it works on its Bay du Nord offshore discovery and holds stakes in three producing offshore fields, but there is no connection between the two strategies, spokesman Erik Haaland said.

UPDATE 1-Statoil to extend Snorre oilfield output under $2.3 bln plan - 路透新闻

{{20171221T091211.107+0000}}UPDATE 1-Statoil to extend Snorre oilfield output under $2.3 bln planOSLO, Dec 20 (Reuters)

* To extend production beyond 2040

* Statoil's largest IOR project in Norway

* Adding almost 200 mln barrels of oil

(Adds details)

OSLO, Dec 20 (Reuters) - Norway's Statoil will extend output from its Snorre oilfield in the North Sea by some 25 years under a 19 billion Norwegian crown ($2.26 billion) investment plan announced on Thursday.

The work should increase recovery from the field by almost 200 million barrels and production will start in 2021, Statoil said in a statement.

Statoil also awarded contracts worth some 9 billion crowns to subcontractors, including TechnipFMC , Subsea 7 , Aibel and Transocean .

The plan includes drilling 24 wells, 12 for production and 12 for injection, and building six subsea templates tied to the Snorre A platform.

The field produced 80,000 barrels of oil per day during the first 10 months of 2017, data from the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate shows.

Statoil's partners in the licence are Petoro, Exxon Mobil , Idemitsu <5019.T>, DEA and Point Resources.

The project had been postponed so that Statoil could cut costs and improve profitability. It is still subject to formal approval by Norwegian authorities.

Exxon Mobil to ease restrictions on shareholder talks with directors - 路透新闻

{{20171220T182233.900+0000}}Exxon Mobil to ease restrictions on shareholder talks with directorsHOUSTON, Dec 20 (Reuters)

By Gary McWilliams and Ross Kerber

HOUSTON, Dec 20 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp said on Wednesday its board had ended a prohibition on outside directors meeting with shareholders, halting a long-standing policy that rankled big investors and led some to vote against key directors.

The decision, which came days after Exxon's board acceded to shareholder calls for an annual review of climate-related risks to its business, reflects a less confrontational tone toward shareholder pressures under Chief Executive Darren Woods. [nL3N1OB5IB]

Exxon, the largest U.S. oil company, said in a statement that its board made the change to allow members to "engage directly" with key shareholders and "to address areas of interest." In the past, it funneled shareholder communications with its board through a company-run website.

John Roe, a managing director and head of analytics at proxy advisor Institutional Shareholder Services, said Exxon was belatedly recognizing that big shareholders were more willing to back activist resolutions since the 2008 financial crisis. He called acceptance of shareholder-director meetings "quite a normal practice" at many companies.

Exxon's board has been under pressure for years from investors unhappy with a policy that effectively barred independent directors from speaking directly with shareholders.

Top asset manager BlackRock Inc earlier this year said it voted against two directors at Exxon's annual meeting on May 31, "In line with our expectations that the lead independent director should be available to shareholders." A BlackRock spokesman did not immediately reply to a message on Wednesday.

A group of investors recently said they were considering a resolution to challenge the policy at Exxon's 2018 shareholder meeting. In a Dec. 5 letter to Exxon's board, Illinois State Treasurer Michael Frerichs and other shareholder representatives had urged an end to the practice of barring direct board interactions with shareholders.

On Wednesday, Frerichs called the decision "a positive step for investors and the environment," and called for additional governance changes.

"The next step is to revise the director-nominating process, director compensation, and executive pay to ensure that ExxonMobil is well-positioned to address climate-related risks and capitalize on fresh, innovative ideas," he said.

LPC: Zenith Energy US shelves M&A loan - 路透新闻

{{20171220T164131.594+0000}}LPC: Zenith Energy US shelves M&A loanNEW YORK, Dec 20 (Reuters)

By Andrew Berlin

NEW YORK, Dec 20 (Reuters) - Midstream company Zenith Energy US Logistics Holdings has pulled a US$450m leveraged loan from syndication as investors were reluctant to jump into a credit exposed to unresolved contingencies from an arbitration case and an expiring contract that could adversely impact cash flow, according to three sources familiar with the matter.

Barclays, Credit Suisse and HSBC are providing committed financing for the deal, which marks the borrower's debut in the leveraged loan market and includes a US$410m seven-year first-lien loan with a US$40m delayed-draw tranche, accompanied by a US$50m five-year revolving credit facility.

Commitments were sought on December 15, after a December 6 launch.

Proceeds, along with US$364m of equity from private equity owner Warburg Pincus, are earmarked to fund Zenith's acquisition of publicly traded energy logistics assets operator Arc Logistics Partners and refinance its debt. The funds are also slated to purchase minority interests in Gulf LNG Holdings, a liquid natural gas regasification and storage terminal in Mississippi, and a crude-by-rail terminal and pipeline in Joliet, Illinois connected to US oil and gas company ExxonMobil's Joliet refinery, from Lightfoot Capital.

The delayed-draw loan will ultimately be used to buy out the lease on the company's Portland crude oil terminal in 2018.

Zenith's debt-to-Ebitda, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, at closing will be 5.5 times, based on US$410m of funded debt and US$74m of pro forma estimated 2017, according to two additional sources familiar with the matter.

"The company has a lot of leverage and it's a complex story with a lot of moving pieces, which makes it difficult to do due diligence," an investor said.

The arrangers will be on the hook to fund the debt if it is not removed from their balance sheets by the time of the deal's closing, which is expected by December 21, according to an October 30 Arc Logistics filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The merger was approved by Arc Logistics shareholders on December 18, according to a company press release.

Barclays plans to relaunch the deal in the New Year, one of the sources said.

Barclays declined to comment. The company and Warburg Pincus did not respond to inquiries.

Gulf LNG is currently in arbitration with Italian oil and gas company Eni's US subsidiary, Eni USA. Eni USA is seeking to unwind its contract with the facility, as it is currently idle given unattractive economics of importing liquid natural gas. While the arbitration hearing was held in January 2017, the ruling has been extended to the end of February 2018. Gulf LNG will represent roughly 25% of projected 2017 Ebitda, the two additional sources said.

Given the unpredictability of the arbitration, Warburg Pincus plans to inject up to US$100m of additional equity to limit an increase in leverage, and drop in cash flow, that could result from a negative ruling.

Zenith also faces the expiration of its Joliet contract with Exxon in May 2018. While the company expects the contract to be renewed, any unfavorable revisions could present a burden since the majority of the terminal's revenue comes from the contract and the terminal accounts for about 25% of Zenith's Ebitda, according to a December 5 Standard & Poor's report.

The term loan was guided in the 525bp-550bp over Libor range, with a 25bp stepdown upon successful completion of the Gulf LNG litigation, subject to a 1% floor. Investors were offered the loan at a 99 discount with six months of soft call protection at 101.

Moody's and Standard & Poor's rate the company and the loan B2/B+.

Exxon Joliet refinery production to be cut through 1st qtr 2018 -ENT - 路透新闻

{{20171220T163251.000+0000}}Exxon Joliet refinery production to be cut through 1st qtr 2018 -ENTHOUSTON, Dec 20 (Reuters)

HOUSTON, Dec 20 (Reuters) - Production at ExxonMobil Corp's 238,600-barrel-per-day (bpd) Joliet, Illinois, refinery will be reduced through the first quarter of 2018 because of its malfunctioning crude unit, Energy News Today reported on Wednesday.

Exxon spokeswoman Tricia Simpson declined comment.

Sources have told Reuters production at the Joliet refinery was cut back after a Dec. 13 malfunctioning of the refinery's 230,000-bpd crude distillation unit (CDU), which was expected to operate at a reduced level at least through January. [nL1N1OJ1QK]

ENT also said the CDU would be shut in March for a planned overhaul scheduled to last 30 to 45 days.

Cade aprova aquisição de parte de fatia da Statoil em Carcará pela Exxon - 路透新闻

{{20171219T121910.858+0000}}Cade aprova aquisição de parte de fatia da Statoil em Carcará pela ExxonSÃO PAULO, 19 Dez (Reuters)

SÃO PAULO, 19 Dez (Reuters) - O Conselho Administrativo de Defesa Econômica (Cade) aprovou sem restrições a aquisição pela norte-americana ExxonMobil de uma fatia detida pela norueguesa Statoil no bloco BM-S-8, na Bacia de Santos, onde está situada a descoberta de Carcará, segundo despacho do órgão no Diário Oficial desta terça-feira.

A operação envolve aproximadamente 1,3 bilhões de dólares, e representa a entrada da ExxonMobil no bloco mediante aquisição de 33 por cento da participação da Statoil, enquanto a participação das demais empresas no contrato de concessão permanecerá inalterada.

O negócio entre as companhias foi anunciado no final de outubro, após ExxonMobil, Statoil e Galp vencerem, em um consórcio, o leilão pela área do pré-sal de Norte de Carcará, por um bônus de assinatura de 3 bilhões de reais. [nL2N1N21TJ]

A Statoil disse na ocasião que iria vender 33 por cento de sua fatia de 66 por cento no BM-S-8 para a Exxon.

A Statoil ainda deverá alienar mais 3,5 por cento do bloco para a ExxonMobil e outros 3 por cento para a Galp após concluir a compra de uma fatia de 10 por cento da Queiroz Galvão Exploração e Produção (QGEP) no empreendimento.

A operação com a QGEP foi aprovada pelo Cade, mas ainda não formalizada até o momento, conforme informação das empresas ao órgão antitruste.

O Cade avaliou que a operação entre ExxonMobil e Statoil não levanta preocupações quanto à concorrência porque o bloco BM-S-8 é um ativo pré-operacional e a norte-americana possui "participação restrita a poucos blocos (no Brasil), até o momento, todos eles em fase de exploração".

UPDATE 1-Exxon Beaumont hydrocracker, crude unit down at least a month –sources - 路透新闻

{{20171218T221938.014+0000}}UPDATE 1-Exxon Beaumont hydrocracker, crude unit down at least a month –sourcesHOUSTON, Dec 18 (Reuters)

(Adds details on outage of the two units, company determination of cause of crude unit fire)

HOUSTON, Dec 18 (Reuters) - The hydrocracker and small crude distillation unit (CDU) at ExxonMobil Corp's 362,300 barrel-per-day Beaumont, Texas, refinery are expected to be shut at least a month for repairs, sources familiar with plant operations said on Monday.

Exxon spokeswoman Charlotte Huffaker declined to comment on the status of units at the refinery.

The 65,000 bpd hydrocracker is expected to restart before the 110,000 bpd CDU, the sources said.

On Dec. 4, the sources told Reuters the CDU, which is the smaller of two at the refinery, may be shut until late January for repairs from a Nov. 28 fire. [L1N1O41BF]

The sources said on Monday the repairs may take until late January to complete. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to speak publicly about the refinery.

Huffaker said Exxon's investigation determined the opening of a valve set off the blaze on Nov. 28.

"The investigation determined that the incident occurred by the opening of a valve that allowed a release of hydrocarbon to the atmosphere," she said. "The hydrocarbon subsequently ignited, which resulted in a fire."

The hydrocracker, which produces diesel, a lucrative export for U.S. Gulf Coast refiners, was shut by a malfunction on Dec. 9. The Beaumont refinery has only one hydrocracker.

The refinery's 240,000 bpd CDU continues to operate. CDUs do the primary refining of crude oil and provide hydrocarbon feedstock to all other units.

Sindicato de petróleo da Nigéria suspende greve nacional; pode ser retomada no fim de janeiro - 路透新闻

{{20171218T183847.891+0000}}Sindicato de petróleo da Nigéria suspende greve nacional; pode ser retomada no fim de janeiroLAGOS, 18 Dez (Reuters)

LAGOS, 18 Dez (Reuters) - Um importante sindicato de petroleiros da Nigéria suspendeu uma greve nacional nesta segunda-feira, mesmo dia em que a paralisação teve início, após uma resolução de disputa determinar a reconvocação de funcionários demitidos de uma companhia de petróleo e gás, disse o presidente do sindicato.

"A gerência concordou em reconvocar incondicionalmente os funcionários demitidos e tomar medidas para permitir que seus empregados sejam membros do sindicato", disse Francis Johnson, presidente do Petroleum and Natural Gas Senior Staff Association of Nigeria (Pengassan).

Em declaração durante uma coletiva de imprensa após negociações entre o sindicato, Ministérios do Trabalho e Petróleo e a companhia, Johnson disse que as greves poderiam voltar se as "posturas contrárias aos sindicatos" de outras companhias do país não fossem enfrentadas até a terceira semana de janeiro, levando a uma "crise industrial de grande proporção".

By Alexis Akwagyiram

LAGOS, Dec 18 (Reuters) - A major Nigerian oil union suspended a nationwide strike on Monday, the same day it began, after a dispute resolution ended with a domestic oil and gas company recalling laid off staff, the union's president said.

"Management agreed to unconditionally recall the sacked staff and take steps to allow their employees to be members of the union," Francis Johnson, the president of the Petroleum and Natural Gas Senior Staff Association of Nigeria (PENGASSAN) said.

Speaking at a press conference after talks between the union, labour and oil ministries and the company, Johnson said strikes could resume if the "anti-union postures" of other domestic companies were not addressed by the third week of January, leading to a "full blown industrial crisis".

PENGASSAN, whose members are mostly managers in the upstream oil industry, began industrial action on Monday over layoffs made by a Nigerian oil and gas company. [nL8N1OI0TP]

The agreements will be reviewed after three months to assess whether the company had held up its side of the deal, the president said.

The strike has threatened to hit the country's crude production and dent exports, as was the case in December 2016 during industrial action against Exxon Mobil . But there was no immediate sign that output was affected on Monday.

Nigeria is Africa's largest crude exporter and oil sales make up two-thirds of government revenue. Output has fluctuated in the past two years due to militant attacks, pipeline theft and industrial action. [nL5N1EG560][nL5N1GD4RC]

PENGASSAN had not said how many workers had been involved in Monday's industrial action, which was called after domestic oil and gas companies and marginal field operators laid off members of the union.

Marginal fields refer to discoveries made by oil majors during exploration of larger acreage but which have been left for others to develop.

Other oil industry unions were working as normal.

Lengthy fuel queues were seen in several parts of the country including in the commercial capital Lagos, in the southwest, the northeastern city of Maiduguri and the city of Jos, situated in the middle of the country.

The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) issued a statement telling motorists there was no need to stock up.

"NNPC wishes to state that relevant government agencies are in consultation with industry unions to arrive at an amicable resolution of issues over which there are threats of industrial action," said the state oil company in an emailed statement.

India's GAIL renegotiating LNG deals with U.S. companies- minister - 路透新闻

{{20171218T155041.700+0000}}India's GAIL renegotiating LNG deals with U.S. companies- ministerNEW DELHI, Dec 18 (Reuters)

NEW DELHI, Dec 18 (Reuters) - Indian gas firm GAIL (India) Ltd is renegotiating its liquefied natural gas purchase deals with U.S.-based Cheniere Energy and Dominion Cove Point, Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan told lawmakers on Monday.

GAIL has signed contracts for sourcing up to 5.8 million tonnes of LNG from the United States.

"GAIL has held number of discussions with Cheniere Energy (Sabine Terminal) and Dominion Cove Point LNG LP (DCP Terminal), for re-negotiation of the contracts," Pradhan said, adding the latest discussions took place in November.

India wants to raise the share of natural gas in its energy mix to 15 percent in the next few years from about 6.5 percent now. But price-sensitive customers in the South Asian nation forced renegotiation of the price of two long-term LNG deals.

Pricing of U.S. LNG is linked to a formula but other charges including freight to India add an extra $2-$3 per million British thermal units, leading to GAIL scouting for destination, time and volume swap deals.

India has in the past renegotiated LNG deals with Qatar's RasGas and Exxon Mobil Corp as spot prices have declined substantially amid a supply glut. [nL4N1OF3WJ]

Reuters in June reported that GAIL is looking to renegotiate LNG deals with Cheniere and Dominion Cove. [nL3N1JO3K7]

UPDATE 2-ExxonMobil, BHP end Australia gas sales joint venture - 路透新闻

{{20171217T233346.000+0000}}UPDATE 2-ExxonMobil, BHP end Australia gas sales joint ventureDec 18 (Reuters)

* ExxonMobil, BHP avert court action by regulator

* Gippsland Basin JV output set to drop rapidly

* Prices unlikely to fall much, analyst says

(Recasts, adds ExxonMobil, BHP and analyst comments)

By Sonali Paul

Dec 18 (Reuters) - ExxonMobil Corp and BHP Billiton Ltd have agreed to end a nearly 50-year-old gas marketing joint venture in Australia, bowing to pressure from the nation's competition watchdog amid concerns about gas supply and soaring prices.

The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) and the companies said on Monday they would start marketing their gas from the Gippsland Basin separately, starting in 2019.

"The ACCC was concerned that the joint marketing arrangements were likely to have resulted in a substantial lessening of competition in the market for the supply of gas to buyers in the southern states," ACCC Chairman Rod Sims said in a statement.

The commission raised concern last year about the tight grip the Gippsland Basin joint venture, the biggest producer in the country's southern states, had on the market. The ACCC flagged it might force the firms to sell their gas separately.

It could have taken ExxonMobil and BHP to court had they not agreed to break up the marketing joint venture.

But an analyst at energy consultants Wood Mackenzie said separate marketing of the gas was unlikely to soften domestic gas prices much. Gas prices were effectively being determined by the liquefied natural gas export market, not the ExxonMobil-BHP joint venture, analyst Saul Kavonic said.

"However the move will add an administrative burden and potentially complicate and delay expansions to gas supply from the (Gippsland Basin) project in the future," Wood Mackenzie's Kavonic said.

BHP shares rose 1.5 percent on Monday, roughly in line with other big miners.

"BHP has cooperated with the ACCC and strongly believes it has complied with the Competition and Consumer Act at all times," the company said in an emailed statement.

The companies had long argued that joint marketing actually saved costs. ExxonMobil had warned in April 2016 that any unwinding of joint marketing "could make it more difficult to invest and bring on new supplies in Gippsland".

"The two companies will cease marketing gas jointly at the end of 2018," Esso Australia, the local arm of ExxonMobil, said in an emailed statement on Monday.

One of the commission's principal concerns was that big gas buyers, like manufacturing companies, were getting only one or two offers at most from gas suppliers for multi-year deals. Having BHP and ExxonMobil market separately would introduce new offers.

Production from the Gippsland Basin venture is forecast to drop to 244 petajoules (PJ) in 2018 from a record 330 PJ this year, as one of its big fields has run out of gas earlier than expected, the commission said in a report last week.

Alaska oil companies settle dispute over Trans-Alaska Pipeline tariff charges - 路透新闻

{{20171216T025505.000+0000}}Alaska oil companies settle dispute over Trans-Alaska Pipeline tariff chargesANCHORAGE, Alaska, Dec 15 (Reuters)

ANCHORAGE, Alaska, Dec 15 (Reuters) - The state of Alaska will receive hundreds of millions of dollars in a settlement with oil companies over the value of North Slope crude oil shipped through the Trans-Alaska Pipeline (TAP), officials announced.

The settlement between Alaska and the companies that own the 800-mile oil artery concerns transportation tariffs charged by the pipeline owners between 2009 and 2015.

Alaska claimed that the Alyeska owner companies, including BP, ConocoPhillips, ExxonMobil, Koch Industries and Unocal, overstated the tariffs and improperly devalued the oil delivered by the pipeline, thus reducing state income.

"This settlement is a great result for the State," Alaska Attorney General Jahna Lindemuth said in statement. "It creates certainty going forward, avoids future litigation, and will provide additional taxes and royalties -- bringing needed money to the state treasury."

The settlement was filed Friday with the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the Regulatory Commission of Alaska (RCA), said Chief Alaska Attorney General John Ptacin. It is subject to FERC and RCA approval, which state officials hope will happen by next spring, he said.

The settlement resolves multiple disputes over the time period. "There's about 40 rate cases. We're settling all of those cases in this settlement agreement," Ptacin said.

The terms allow the state to retain $224 million in already collected revenues and grant the state an additional $165 million in oil revenues.

Other terms require the companies to exclude from any tariff calculations approximately $625 million that the owner companies spent on "strategic reconfiguration" for TAPS operator Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. Terms also include a methodology for calculating transportation tariffs through 2021.

The settlement resolves complaints the oil companies filed in Washington, D.C. and Alaska courts that challenged past FERC and RCA rulings, Ptacin said.

Much of the disagreement stemmed from Alyeska's strategic reconfiguration project, which was aimed at streamlining operations, increasing automation and reducing costs in a time when the pipeline is carrying reduced oil volumes.

The state argued that the owner companies botched the project and added costs that should not be used to reduce the value of North Slope crude or the revenues derived from that crude. The state prevailed on that point, Ptacin said.

Disputes also concerned property taxes and how they would be treated in the tariff calculations, he said.

Also parties to the settlement are Anadarko, Tesoro, Flint Hills and Petro Star Inc., which shipped oil through the pipeline but held no ownership shares. Those companies generally sided with the state in the tariff disputes, Ptacin said.

{{20171215T160756.486+0000}}UPDATE 1-Exxon Baytown, Texas refinery restarts hydrocracker -sourcesHOUSTON, Dec 15 (Reuters)

(Adds company no comment; adds details on unit)

HOUSTON, Dec 15 (Reuters) - ExxonMobil Corp was restarting the 25,000 barrel-per-day (bpd) hydrocracking unit (HCU) at its 560,500 bpd Baytown, Texas, refinery on Friday, sources familiar with plant operations said.

Exxon spokeswoman Charlotte Huffaker declined to discuss the status of individual units at the Baytown refinery, but said the company continued to meet its contractual commitments.

The HCU was shut late on Monday due to a malfunction brought on by cold weather, the sources said.

The hydrocracker converts gas oil into motor fuel, primarily diesel, by processing it under high heat and pressure in the presence of hydrogen and a catalyst.

{{20171215T144627.296+0000}}USA-Les valeurs à suivre à Wall Street (actualisé)15 décembre (Reuters)

(Actualisé avec Pfizer, Teva, cours en avant-Bourse)

15 décembre (Reuters) - Principales valeurs à suivre vendredi à Wall Street, où les contrats à terme sur les indices de référence signalent une ouverture en légère hausse :

* ORACLE . L'éditeur de logiciels a publié jeudi des bénéfices et un chiffre d'affaires trimestriels supérieurs aux attentes mais la croissance de son activité d'informatique dématérialisée (cloud) a déçu les analystes. Le titre perd 6,5% dans les échanges en avant-Bourse. RBC a abaissé son conseil à "performance en ligne" contre "surperformance". [nL8N1OE7OS]

* ADOBE SYSTEMS . Le créateur de Photoshop a publié jeudi des résultats trimestriels meilleurs que prévu, avec un chiffre d'affaires qui a pour la première fois dépassé le cap des deux milliards de dollars. Plusieurs intermédiaires ont relevé leur objectif de cours sur la valeur. Le titre, en hausse de quelque 70% depuis le début de l'année, gagne 1,7% à 178 dollars en avant-Bourse. [nL8N1OE83E]

* COSTCO WHOLESALE . Le distributeur a publié jeudi soir des résultats trimestriels en hausse et supérieurs aux attentes, ses investissements dans l'e-commerce commençant à porter leurs fruits avec un bond de 42% des ventes par ce canal. Le titre progresse de 2,4% en avant-Bourse.

* AMAZON - Siemens va s'allier au géant américain de la distribution en ligne pour accélérer le lancement de sa plate-forme logicielle MindSphere prévu en janvier. Par ailleurs, le Luxembourg a déposé un recours auprès du Tribunal de l'Union européenne (UE) contre la décision de la Commission européenne d'ordonner au Grand-Duché de récupérer auprès d'Amazon.com autour de 250 millions d'euros d'arriérés d'impôt. [nL8N1OF2UD]

* PFIZER gagne 0,9% en avant-Bourse. Le groupe a annoncé jeudi soir que la Food and Drug Administration (FDA) avait approuvé deux dosages supplémentaires du Xeljanz, un traitement de l'arthrite psoriasique.

* TEVA - L'action du groupe pharmaceutique est en hausse de 3,4% en avant-Bourse après un bond de 10% jeudi en réaction à l'annonce d'un important plan de restructuration qui prévoit une réduction d'un quart des effectifs. Goldman Sachs a relevé sa recommandation à "acheter" contre "neutre" avec un objectif de cours porté de 15 à 20 dollars.

* HESS . Le fonds activiste Elliott Management, qui détient 6,7% du producteur d'hydrocarbures, espère obtenir l'éviction du PDG, John Hess, ou le pousser à céder tout ou partie du groupe, a rapporté jeudi soir le Wall Street Journal. Les analystes de JPMorgan ont abaissé leur conseil à "sous-pondérer" contre "neutre".

* CSX CORP a fait savoir que son président-directeur général, Hunter Harrison, nommé en mars dernier, prenait un congé maladie pour des raisons qui n'ont pas clairement été expliquées alors que le plan de redressement mis en place pour réduire les coûts et accroître la rentabilité est très critiqué. Le titre chute de 10,3% en avant-Bourse.

* EXXON MOBIL . La compagnie pétrolière a signé jeudi avec son homologue brésilienne Petrobras (Petróleo Brasileiro) une alliance pour développer des projets énergétiques dans le monde.

* UNITED TECHNOLOGIES . Le Pentagone a annoncé jeudi avoir attribué un contrat de 6,7 milliards de dollars au motoriste Pratt & Whitney, filiale d'United Tech.

BUZZ-DJI: Year-end kick can lead to exhaustion - 路透新闻

{{20171215T141440.266+0000}}BUZZ-DJI: Year-end kick can lead to exhaustion** DJI <.DJI> up 24 pct YTD, on track to cross the 2017 finish line with its best yearly gain since 2013

** However, its extended position, and waning short-term momentum, suggest risk it may be tough to maintain its pace

** The blue-chip index has recently been pulling away from the pack; DJI best performing major index QTD and MTD with 9.4 pct and 1 pct gains [nL1N1OE1FM] [nL1N1OE0TN]

** Heading into final weeks of the year, 25 of 30 index constituents are making a positive contribution to its 2017 performance

** Boeing , UnitedHealth and 3M close to 40 pct of the YTD gain [nL1N1OB1A2]; Exxon , IBM and GE biggest drags

** DJI challenging its 26.5 pct rise in 2013; ending the year with gain>26.5 pct would be its best performance since 1995's 33.5 pct thrust

** However, with its recent flurry, DJI extended, now 11.8 pct above its rising 200-DMA; since 2011, at most, has closed 13.6 pct above this key long-term MA [nL1N1O01ME]

** On Oct 20, DJI daily RSI finished just slightly above its Dec 2016 high, making it the most overbought reading since Jul 1955. Chart: http://reut.rs/2jXhCxs

** And since Oct, RSI diverging, momentum waning despite fresh record highs

** Add in Fibo projections (24690.91/24868.41) just ~0.7-1.5 pct above Thurs close, and 1-year resistance parallel (now ~24870) and upside can be limited

** Breaking early Dec low (24101.24) can see pressure mount

RPT-Petrobras anunciará em breve parceria que irá permitir longa produção na Bacia de Campos, diz Parente - 路透新闻

{{20171215T101744.956+0000}}RPT-Petrobras anunciará em breve parceria que irá permitir longa produção na Bacia de Campos, diz ParenteSÃO PAULO, 14 Dez (Reuters)

(Repete texto publicado na noite de quinta-feira, sem alterações)

SÃO PAULO, 14 Dez (Reuters) - A Petrobras vai fechar em breve uma parceria que irá permitir que a Bacia de Campos, que teve a sua primeira extração há 40 anos, continue produzindo por um longo tempo, afirmou nesta quinta-feira o presidente da petroleira estatal, Pedro Parente.

O executivo fez a afirmação durante seu discurso, ao receber o título de Eminente Engenheiro do Ano de 2017, do Instituto de Engenharia, em São Paulo.

"Vamos anunciar, em breve, uma nova parceria que vai deixá-la produzir por mais 40 anos", disse o executivo, ao se referir ao aniversário da Bacia de Campos, a mais importante e madura do Brasil, responsável por metade da produção do país.

A afirmação do executivo ocorreu após a empresa anunciar, nesta quinta-feira, uma aliança com a norte-americana ExxonMobil , que prevê avaliar possíveis negócios em conjunto, no Brasil e no exterior, em diversos setores onde as duas companhias atuam.[nE5N1NF00G]

No entanto, questionado por jornalistas, o executivo negou que os dois assuntos tivessem conexão.

Parente destacou que a Petrobras tem alianças estratégias também fechadas com outras petroleiras, durante sua gestão, como a francesa Total e a chinesa CNPC [CNPET.UL], o que faz parte da estratégia da empresa.

"É um sinal importante de empresas como a Exxon, que é considerada a maior empresa listada de produção de óleo e gás, uma empresa muito bem conceituada, de se associar numa parceria estratégica com a Petrobras", afirmou Parente.

"É um negócio, diria, estratégico e muito prestigioso para a companhia, onde nós vamos ter oportunidade de fazer uma troca grande de conhecimentos, de experiências e avaliar inclusive a possibilidade da empresa se associar à Exxon em ativos fora do país."

14 dic (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp y la petrolera brasileña Petrobras dijeron el jueves que formaron una alianza para desarrollar proyectos de energía en el mundo.

El acuerdo, firmado en Río de Janeiro, permitirá que las compañías estudien maneras de cooperar en proyectos de exploración, producción y petroquímicos dentro y fuera de Brasil.

El pacto se produce dos meses después de que Exxon y Petróleo Brasileiro, empresa operada por el Estado también conocida como Petrobras , obtuvieron seis bloques petroleros en la costa brasileña en una ronda de subastas.

Dec 14 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp and Petróleo Brasileiro SA, Brazil's state-controlled oil producer also known as Petrobras, said on Thursday they had formed an alliance to develop energy projects around the world.

The deal, which was signed in Rio de Janeiro, will have the companies study ways they can cooperate on exploration, production and chemical ventures inside and outside of Brazil.

The deal comes two months after Exxon and Petrobras were jointly awarded six oil-rich blocks in Brazilian coastal waters.[nL2N1M80O5]

UPDATE 3-Natgas producer EQT to spend $2.4 bln in 2018 - 路透新闻

{{20171213T165905.978+0000}}UPDATE 3-Natgas producer EQT to spend $2.4 bln in 2018(Updates price, changes headline)

Dec 13 (Reuters) - EQT Corp , the biggest U.S. natural gas producer, said on Wednesday it expects to spend $2.4 billion next year, the majority of which will be to develop more wells in two key shale formations in the Appalachian region.

EQT's shares were up 2.6 percent at $57.47 in afternoon trading.

The company recently completed its $6.7 billion acquisition of Rice Energy, a deal that combined two of the largest players in the Marcellus and Utica shale formations. [nL3N1JG3TB]

EQT's budget is 60 percent more than its forecast for 2017 as its looks to boost its production of natural gas, which is expected to be the main source of power generation in the United States in 2018. [nL1N1OC1J0]

The Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania-based company has earmarked $2.2 billion of its overall 2018 budget to develop wells – 139 in Marcellus and 25 net wells in Utica.

The company said it expects total production sales volume of 1,520-1,560 billion cubic feet equivalent (Bcfe) in 2018 and sales volume to increase 15 percent in 2019. [nBw2Wwh5qa]

The 2018 sales volume forecast is lower than 1,569 Bcfe RBC Capital Markets analyst Scott Hanold was expecting.

EQT had said in March it expected $1.5 billion in capital expenditure this year. That was two months before it announced the deal to buy Rice Energy.

In July, EQT forecast sales volumes of 825-840 Bcfe for 2017.

Up to Tuesday's close, EQT shares had fallen 4.7 percent since it announced the Rice Energy deal, while the broader S&P 500 energy index <.SPNY> has risen 4.7 percent in that same period.

UPDATE 1-Exxon deal aside, tough proxy season looms at U.S. energy firms - 路透新闻

{{20171213T005321.787+0000}}UPDATE 1-Exxon deal aside, tough proxy season looms at U.S. energy firms(Recasts to focus on shareholder resolutions for 2018)

By Ross Kerber and Gary McWilliams

BOSTON/HOUSTON, Dec 12 (Reuters) - Climate activists said on Tuesday they would take a tough shareholder resolution off the table at Exxon Mobil Corp after the company agreed to provide new details about how climate change could affect its business.

But top U.S. oil and gas producers may still face dissension at their springtime shareholder meetings as investors look for more of them to provide additional details on a range of climate topics such as greenhouse gas reduction plans.

Exxon had been the focus of attention after a majority of investors in May backed a call for more disclosure about the impact that climate policies could have on its business, capping a wave of support for such resolutions. [nL1N1IX15V]

However, late on Monday the company laid out its intended response, to report on matters like how it is positioned "for a lower-carbon future." [nL8N1OB2K8]

In turn, one of the sponsors of the May resolution, New State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli, moved to withdraw a refiled version of the shareholder resolution for Exxon's 2018 meeting, his representatives said Tuesday.

Officials there, and at other investment funds, said their efforts were hardly over. Pat Doherty, DiNapoli's director of corporate governance, said the office has filed a new round of climate proposals for the 2018 annual meetings of companies including Chesapeake Energy Corp and Southwestern Energy Co.

He also said the New York state comptroller's office would monitor Exxon's response and could turn against Exxon directors if its promised report does not provide enough specifics.

"There are any number of tools in our toolbox," Doherty said.

Representatives for Southwestern and Chesapeake declined to comment.

Ceres, a Boston sustainability advocacy group, said it estimates about a dozen resolutions calling for climate impact reports have been filed so far at U.S. energy and utility companies for 2018. According to a count by Ceres of 16 public company votes on similar climate measures last year, most won support from more than 40 percent of shares voted.

The higher-than-usual results reflected how many top investors have come to view climate change as a practical problem even as U.S. President Donald Trump has made plans to quit a climate accord brokered in Paris two years ago.

At another climate conference in Paris, on Tuesday, fund leaders also described a new effort to push large corporations to cut greenhouse gas emissions and to take steps like disclosing more about their planning for a range of climate scenarios.

In all, some 225 investors managing a total of $26.3 trillion have signed up for the campaign, accounting for about a quarter of the investment base of the typical large company where changes would be sought, said Anne Simpson, investment director of sustainability for the California Public Employees' Retirement System.

She noted signatories go beyond public pension funds to include mainstream asset managers such as Pacific Investment Management and Manulife Asset Management.

Climate concerns, Simpson said, have moved "from the sidelines to the mainstream."

UPDATE 4-Broken pipeline cuts British supply during peak energy demand - 路透新闻

{{20171212T202402.949+0000}}UPDATE 4-Broken pipeline cuts British supply during peak energy demand* Oil and gas supplies disrupted during UK cold snap

* Forties is key oil flow for benchmark Brent prices

* Brent jumps above $65 for first time since mid-2015

(Updates with INEOS saying outage could last up to 4 weeks)

By Ron Bousso, Amanda Cooper and Alex Lawler

LONDON, Dec 12 (Reuters) - Britain's biggest pipeline from its North Sea oil and gas fields is likely to be shut for several weeks for repairs, its operator said on Tuesday, disrupting gas flows and sending international crude prices to their highest since mid-2015.

The closure has struck during a winter freeze in Britain, where snow and ice have driven up demand for heating fuel just as gas flows through the network, which carries a third of Britain's gas produced offshore, were disrupted.

"We are working to get the pipeline restored to full operation as quickly as we can safely do so... We have previously indicated a time frame of three to four weeks and we believe it is no less than two," operator INEOS said in a email to customers seen by Reuters.

The pipeline, which carries about 450,000 barrels per day (bpd) of Forties crude, was shut after cracks were found.

It has particular significance to global markets because Forties is the largest out of the five crude oil streams that underpin the dated Brent benchmark, against which other crude prices are broadly based. Benchmark Brent crude prices rose above $65 per barrel for the first time since the middle of 2015 following the closure on Monday. [O/R]

INEOS only completed the purchase of the Forties pipeline system from oil major BP in October. A minor leak had caused a partial shutdown on Dec. 7 and a full shutdown on Monday. INEOS said the small crack has not increased over the past 24 hours.

Paul Wheelhouse, the Scottish energy minister, said there were no plans to shut the 200,000 bpd Grangemouth refinery, which uses Forties crude. [nL9N1NR00L]

"If it's a lengthy outage, then a recovery period for the fields will be long as well," the trading source said.

FIELDS CLOSING

A number of producers including BP , Shell and Chrysaor, said they had closed down oil fields in response.

The largest contributor to the Forties stream, the 180,000-bpd Buzzard oil field run by Nexen Petroleum UK Ltd, a subsidiary of China's CNOOC <0883.HK>, had also closed, two trading sources said. [CRU/OUT]

Monthly loading programmes show the supply of Forties is expected to reach 21 cargoes of 600,000 barrels each this month, equal to a daily supply rate of 406,000 bpd. [nL9N1AF03S]

The closure has created havoc with loading schedules in the North Sea, with one trading source saying cargo owners had been offered options to drop cargoes from the loading programme.

"At this point we would expect a large deferral list for the Forties loading programme to spill over into January," analysts from JBC Energy said in a note.

"The timing of the outage could not be much worse as winter weather is just materialising," Jefferies bank analysts wrote.

Jefferies estimated the closure resulted in production loss for BP of 105,000 bpd, for Total of 55,000 bpd, for Chevron of 45,000 bpd, for Exxon Mobil of 40,000, for Eni of 25,000 bpd, for Shell of 25,000 bpd, for ConocoPhillips of 15,000 bpd.

The Paris-based International Energy Agency, which advises Western governments and coordinates the release of oil from strategic stocks in the case of supply disruptions, said it stood ready to take action but it did not believe this was necessary for the time being.

"The market is amply supplied from other sources and stocks are well above the five-year average," the IEA said. [nL8N1OC4HN]

El mundo está perdiendo la batalla contra el cambio climático, dice Macron - 路透新闻

{{20171212T190616.310+0000}}El mundo está perdiendo la batalla contra el cambio climático, dice MacronPor Richard Lough y Michel Rose

PARÍS, 12 dic (Reuters) - El presidente francés, Emmanuel Macron, presentó el martes una sombría visión de la lucha global contra el cambio climático a decenas de líderes mundiales y ejecutivos de empresas, al afirmar que "estamos perdiendo la batalla".

"No nos estamos moviendo lo suficientemente rápido. Tenemos que actuar todos", dijo Macron, buscando insuflar algo de vida a los esfuerzos para combatir el calentamiento global después de que el presidente estadounidense, Donald Trump, retirara a su país del acuerdo internacional logrado en la capital francesa hace dos años.

Macron, quien ha trabajado para consolidar su rol como líder global luego de su elección en mayo, dijo que la ciencia moderna ha revelado día a día el peligro que el calentamiento global representa para el planeta.

"Estamos perdiendo la batalla", sostuvo, instando a una nueva etapa en la lucha contra el calentamiento global.

Francia anunció 12 compromisos no vinculantes, desde 300 millones de dólares para luchar contra la desertificación a la aceleración del cambio a una economía con una baja huella de carbono. Pero no hubo una promesa que asegure a las naciones pobres que sufren los peores efectos del cambio climático que podrán enfrentarlo de mejor forma.

Instituciones financieras públicas y privadas se comprometieron a destinar más fondos para fomentar la transición a una economía "verde" y los inversores dijeron que presionarían a las grandes empresas para que den un giro hacia estrategias más amistosas con el medio ambiente. [nL1N1OC1N9]

Entre los compromisos, más de 200 inversores institucionales con 26 billones de dólares en activos dijeron el martes que aumentarían la presión sobre las corporaciones que emiten la mayor cantidad de gases de efecto invernadero en el mundo para que combatan el cambio climático. [nL1N1OC0CH]

Según ellos, esto sería más efectivo que amenazar con quitar sus inversiones de estas compañías, entre las que se encuentran Coal India , Gazprom , Exxon Mobil y China Petroleum & Chemical Corp <600028.SS>.

La Comisión Europea, en tanto, dijo que está "mirando positivamente" a los planes para reducir los requisitos de capital para las inversiones de bancos en proyectos amigables con el medioambiente, en un esfuerzo por fomentar la economía "verde".

{{20171212T182601.213+0000}}FOKUS 2-Macron setzt auf neue Impulse bei Klima-Gipfel - ohne Trump* Macron: US-Ausstieg aus Klimaabkommen ist Weckruf

* "Wir sind dabei, die Schlacht zu verlieren"

* Weltbank zieht sich aus der Unterstützung von Ölprojekten zurück

* EU erwägt Förderung von Bank-Geschäften für erneuerbare Energien

(neu: Macrons Appell auf Gipfel, Kalifornien, mehr zu Weltbank, Greenpeace)

- von Richard Lough und Michel Rose

Paris, 12. Dez (Reuters) - Zwei Jahre nach dem Klimagipfel von Paris hat Frankreichs Präsident Emmanuel Macron auf einem Nachfolgetreffen ein düsteres Bild vom Kampf gegen die Erderwärmung gezeichnet. "Wir sind dabei, die Schlacht zu verlieren", sagte Macron am Dienstag vor Dutzenden Staats- und Regierungschefs sowie Vertretern der Wirtschaftswelt. Macron hatte sie in die französische Hauptstadt geladen, um dem Einsatz gegen den Klimawandel nach jüngsten Rückschlägen neuen Schwung zu verleihen. US-Präsident Donald Trump hatte im Sommer den Ausstieg seines Landes aus dem 2015 erzielten Klimaabkommen angekündigt. Er ist in Paris nicht dabei. Das Treffen soll vor allem mehr Geld für den Klimaschutz mobilisieren und den Druck auf jene Konzerne erhöhen, die zu den größten Verursachern von Treibhausgasen gehören.

"Wir bewegen uns nicht schnell genug", warnte Macron. "Wir müssen alle handeln." Anders als vor zwei Jahren werden von dem aktuellen Gipfel allerdings keine verbindlichen Vereinbarungen erwartet. Damals verpflichtete sich die Weltgemeinschaft, die Erderwärmung auf maximal zwei Grad gegenüber der vorindustriellen Zeit zu beschränken. Doch mit dem Regierungswechsel in Washington sind die USA als weltgrößte Volkswirtschaft auf dem Sprung aus den Vereinbarungen. Trump begründet das Vorhaben mit Zweifeln daran, dass der Klimawandel hauptsächlich auf die Verbrennung fossiler Brennstoffe zurückgeht und damit von Menschen verursacht wird.

Offiziell sind die USA bei dem Treffen nur auf Botschaftsebene in Paris vertreten. Doch ungeachtet dessen setzen sich Vertreter der Westküsten-Bundestaaten Kalifornien und Washington für mehr Klimaschutz ein. Zusammen mit anderen Pazifik-Anrainern wie Kanada, Mexiko und Costa Rica verständigten sie sich in Paris darauf, mit höheren Preisen für sogenannte Verschmutzungsrechte den Ausstoß von Kohlendioxid zu verringern. Auch Filmstars wie Leonardo di Caprio und Arnold Schwarzenegger trommeln in der französischen Hauptstadt für mehr Klimaschutz.

Präsident Macron bezeichnete die Ausstiegspläne der Trump-Regierung als Weckruf. "Wenn wir uns nicht bewegen und unsere Art zu produzieren, zu investieren und unser Verhalten nicht ändern, werden wir für Milliarden Opfer verantwortlich sein", warnte der ehemalige Banker bereits im Vorfeld des Gipfels.

INSTITUTIONELLE INVESTOREN WOLLEN DRUCK AUF KONZERNE ERHÖHEN

Mehr als 200 institutionelle Investoren sagten in Paris zu, ihren Druck auf die weltweit größten Verursacher von Treibhausgasen zu erhöhen. Das sei wirkungsvoller, als sich aus Firmen wie Coal India, Gazprom, Exxon oder China Petroleum & Chemical Corp<600028.SS> zurückzuziehen.

Auch die Weltbank reagierte und erklärte, ab 2019 nicht länger in die Förderung von Öl und Gas zu investieren. Davon ausgenommen seien lediglich bestimmte Gas-Projekte in den ärmsten Ländern. Nichtregierungsorganisationen wie Greenpeace lobten die Entscheidung. Unterstützung für den Klimaschutz könnte auch von der EU kommen: Die Kommission prüft derzeit Möglichkeiten, wie sie Investitionen von Banken in erneuerbare Energie fördern kann. Es könnten beispielsweise die Kapitalanforderungen für Institute gesenkt werden, sagte Vizekommissar Valdis Dombrovskis in Paris.

Oleoduto britânico no Mar do Norte deve ficar fechado por semanas, diz operador - 路透新闻

{{20171212T181311.228+0000}}Oleoduto britânico no Mar do Norte deve ficar fechado por semanas, diz operadorPor Amanda Cooper e Alex Lawler

LONDRES, 12 Dez (Reuters) - O maior oleoduto do Reino Unido, proveniente do Mar do Norte, deverá ficar fechado por várias semanas para reparos, disse o operador do sistema nesta terça-feira, interrompendo o fluxo de petróleo e levando as cotações da commodity ao maior nível desde meados de 2015.

O fechamento ocorreu em meio a uma forte nevasca no Reino Unido, que eleva a demanda por combustíveis de aquecimento, acarretando em redução no fornecimento de gás pelo oleoduto que carrega um terço do produto offshore do país.

"Temos ouvido que provavelmente ficará fechado por duas semanas", disse uma fonte da indústria com conhecimento das operações.

O oleoduto, que carrega cerca de 450 mil barris por dia (bpd) de petróleo Forties, foi fechado depois que algumas rachaduras foram encontradas.

O sistema tem um significado importante para os mercados globais, porque o Forties é o maior dos cinco fluxos de petróleo que sustentam o padrão de referência Brent, contra o qual outros preços do petróleo são amplamente baseados.

Nesta quinta-feira, os futuros do Brent subiram acima de 65 dólares por barril pela primeira vez desde meados de 2015 após o fechamento do oleoduto ser anunciado na segunda-feira. [nL1N1OC0EX]

UPDATE 4-World is losing the battle against climate change, Macron says - 路透新闻

{{20171212T180457.587+0000}}UPDATE 4-World is losing the battle against climate change, Macron says* Summit takes place on 2-year anniversary of Paris climate deal

* Macron gives bleak assessment says: "We all need to act"

* Trump has said he plans to take U.S. out of Paris agreement

* Investors say will put more pressure on global companies

(Adds ActionAid USA, details on commitments)

By Richard Lough and Michel Rose

PARIS, Dec 12 (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron delivered a bleak assessment on the global fight against climate change to dozens of world leaders and company executives on Tuesday, telling them: "We are losing the battle".

"We're not moving quickly enough. We all need to act," Macron said, seeking to breathe new life into a collective effort that was weakened this summer when President Donald Trump said he was pulling the United States out of an international accord brokered in the French capital two years ago.

Macron, who has worked to establish his role as a global leader since his sweeping election win in May, said modern-day science was revealing with each day the danger that global warming posed to the planet, he said.

"We are losing the battle," he said, urging a new phase in the fight against global warming.

France announced a raft of 12 non-binding commitments, from a $300 million pledge to fight desertification to accelerating the transition towards a decarbonised economy. But there was no headline promise likely to reassure poor nations on the sharp end of climate change that they will be better able to cope.

Public and private financial institutions pledged to channel more funds to spur the transition to a green economy and investors said they would pressure corporate giants to shift towards more ecologically friendly strategies.

Among the commitments, more than 200 institutional investors with $26 trillion in assets under management said on Tuesday they would step up pressure on the world's biggest corporate greenhouse gas emitters to combat climate change [nL8N1OB2K8].

That, they said, would be more effective than threatening to pull the plug on their investments in companies, which include Coal India , Gazprom , Exxon Mobil and China Petroleum & Chemical Corp <600028.SS>.

The European Commission, meanwhile, said it was "looking positively" at plans to reduce capital requirements for environmentally-friendly investments by banks in a bid to boost the green economy [nL8N1OC1HC].

"LITTLE FOR THE VULNERABLE"

Climate change is causing more frequent and severe flooding, droughts, storms and heatwaves as average global temperatures rise to new records, sea ice melts in the Arctic and sea levels rise.

Developing nations say the rich are lagging with a commitment dating back to 2009 to provide $100 billion a year by 2020 - from public and private sources alike - to help them switch from fossil fuels to greener energy sources and adapt to the effects of climate change.

On Tuesday, the European Commission announced 9 billion euros worth of investments targeting sustainable cities, sustainable energy and sustainable agriculture for Africa and EU neighbourhood countries.

Yet the United Nations Environment Programme says the cost of adapting to climate change in developing countries could rise to between $280 billion and $500 billion per year by 2050.

"Despite the hype, the One Planet summit is delivering little for the world's people who are the most vulnerable to climate change," said Brandon Wu, director of policy and campaigns at ActionAid USA.

"Rich countries continue to pretend that new schemes for businessmen to increase their profits will be the center of the solution for the poor."

Macron used the eve of the summit to award 18 grants to foreign climate scientists, most of whom are currently U.S.-based, to come and work in France [nL8N1OB5JE].

BREAKINGVIEWS-Exxon climate U-turn deserves wary investor cheers - 路透新闻

{{20171212T175631.226+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-Exxon climate U-turn deserves wary investor cheers(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are her own.)

By Lauren Silva Laughlin

DALLAS, Dec 12 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Exxon Mobil's climate-change U-turn deserves some wary investor cheers. The $350 billion oil firm is finally planning to comply with shareholder demands – approved more than six months ago - to disclose how global warming will affect its business. That's to be welcomed. But Exxon's reputation for fobbing off such concerns means investors need to not just trust, but verify.

The world's largest independent, publicly traded oil company said in a filing Monday night that it would comply with a request to improve disclosure surrounding climate change that more than 60 percent of shareholders approved in May. In a follow-up letter to New York's office of the comptroller, Exxon elaborated: New disclosures to investors will include "energy demand sensitivities, the implications of two degree Celsius scenarios, and its positioning for a lower-carbon future."

It's an important step. Though the May proposal was non-binding, shareholder pressure has ratcheted up recently. Walden Asset Management, an active investor which voted for more disclosure, sent a letter this week reiterating its request. Exxon's board, notoriously secretive, risked another proxy fight if it decided not to comply.

Exxon's concession, though, leaves room for creativity. It can base disclosures on its own precarious assumptions. For example, the company run by Darren Woods could predict that the only fossil fuel the world abandons is coal and address this by making changes to carbon-capture and storage. That doesn't take into account how global oil and gas demand might change.

The company is no stranger to being accused of providing self-serving estimates. Earlier this year Greenpeace and Oil Change International published a study saying Exxon's estimates for wind and solar power from 2005 came true nearly two decades early. The study also bashes the company for grossly underestimating how fast electronic vehicles may grow: Exxon reckons just 6 percent of the global car fleet will be powered by batteries by 2040; the Carbon Tracker Initiative estimates more than half of passengers will be traveling in EVs by then.

In fact Exxon could use this opportunity do the opposite of what shareholders want: prove their current strategy is the correct one.

CONTEXT NEWS

- Exxon Mobil has decided to comply with a shareholder request to enhance company disclosures about the effect of climate change in its business, the company said in a regulatory filing on Dec. 11.

- On May 31 shareholders had approved a non-binding resolution spearheaded by the New York State Common Retirement Fund calling for Exxon to provide more information about the impact on its operations of global warming.

- In a letter addressed specifically to Patrick Doherty, the director of corporate governance at New York state's comptroller's office, the company said the enhancements to its disclosure would include "energy demand sensitivities, implications of two degree Celsius scenarios, and positioning for a lower-carbon future." The company plans to publish the information in "the near future."

- The filing came three days before the deadline for shareholders to submit resolutions for the 2018 annual meeting, according to Reuters.

New York comptroller to withdraw Exxon shareholder climate proposal - 路透新闻

DiNapoli, who oversees a state retirement fund, said the resolution will be withdrawn because Exxon said Monday it agreed to conduct a climate change impact analysis. [L3N1OB5IB]

GB-L'oléoduc de Forties fermé au moins deux semaines-source - 路透新闻

{{20171212T142143.053+0000}}GB-L'oléoduc de Forties fermé au moins deux semaines-sourceLONDRES, 12 décembre (Reuters) - Le plus gros oléoduc britannique dans la mer du Nord restera probablement fermé pendant deux semaines pour réparations, a rapporté mardi une source du secteur.

Cette fermeture perturbe également le transport de gaz sur le réseau par lequel transite un tiers de la production gazière britannique offshore. Elle intervient alors que les chutes de neige et les températures glaciales engendrent une forte demande de fuel.

Le cours du Brent est passé au-dessus des 65 dollars le baril pour la première fois depuis mi-2015.

Cet oléoduc est particulièrement surveillé car le pétrole de Forties est le plus grand constituant du standard du Brent.

L'oléoduc de Forties, d'une capacité de 450.000 barils par jour (bpj), a été fermé lundi après la découverte de fissures.

"Nous avons entendu que (l'oléoduc) resterait probablement fermé pendant deux semaines", a dit une source du secteur.

La société pétrochimique Ineos, qui a finalisé en octobre le rachat du système d'oléoducs Forties à BP , a déclaré qu'il était trop tôt pour dire le temps que prendraient les réparations. Mais elle a ajouté que cela se compterait "plutôt en semaines qu'en jours".

L'oléoduc avait été partiellement fermé le 7 décembre.

Jefferies estime que la fermeture entraînera une perte de production d'environ 105.000 bpj pour BP, de 55.000 bpj pour Total , de 45.000 bpj pour Chevron , de 40.000 bpj pour Exxon Mobil , de 25.000 bpj pour Eni et Royal Dutch Shell et de 15.000 bpj pour ConocoPhillips .

Dec 12 (Reuters) - The Dow Jones Industrial Average was set to open higher on Tuesday on gains from oil-related stocks and Boeing, while the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq futures pointed to a flat opening ahead of the Federal Reserve's policy meeting.

The benchmark Brent crude , gained more than 1.65 percent to rise above $65 a barrel for the first time since mid-2015 after an unplanned shutdown of the UK's biggest North Sea oil pipeline.[O/R]

Shares of oil majors Exxon , Chevron and Schlumberger rose by between 0.14 percent and 0.68 percent in premarket trading.

Boeing shares were set to open at a record high after the company said it would raise its quarterly dividend by 20 percent and replace its existing share buyback program with a new $18 billion authorization. [nL3N1OB531]

At 8:31 a.m. ET (1331 GMT), Dow e-minis <1YMc1> were up 52 points, or 0.21 percent, with 11,295 contracts changing hands.

S&P 500 e-minis were up 1.75 points, or 0.07 percent, with 194,263 contracts traded.

Nasdaq 100 e-minis were down 2.5 points, or 0.04 percent, on volume of 16,031 contracts.

The Fed is widely expected to raise its benchmark interest rate for third time this year at the end of the meeting on Wednesday. Traders see an 87.6 percent chance of a 25 basis point rate hike, according to CME Group's Fedwatch tool.

Investors will watch for the central bank's forecast on future rate hikes and the view on the health of the economy.

In Sept, the central bank forecast three rate hikes in 2018, but a sluggish wage growth and inflation that has run below the its forecast has raised doubts about the pace of future rate hikes.

A fairly upbeat November U.S. payrolls report showed strength in job growth, but average hourly earnings rose less-than-expected. [nLNS8NED2N]

"Investors are presented with an interesting economic outlook. They are looking at a positive set of economic data in an improving economy, with some hesitation with regards to Federal Reserve, given the change in leadership," said Andre Bakhos, managing director at Janlyn Capital in Bernardsville, New Jersey. Though the current Fed Chair, Janet Yellen, will continue until February, her final press conference on Wednesday afternoon will set the policy backdrop incoming Chair, Jerome Powell, inherits.

A Labor Department report showed U.S. producer prices rose in November as gasoline prices surged and the cost of other goods increased.

Producer price index for final demand increased 0.4 percent last month, while economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index rising 0.3 percent. [nLNSCNED2U]

Comcast shares rose about 1.74 percent after the company abandoned its bid for most of the assets of Twenty-First Century Fox , leaving Walt Disney as the sole suitor of the $40 billion-plus deal. [nL1N1OB1XQ]

Disney shares rose 0.47 percent.

Grandes inversores presionan a conglomerados para que aumenten acción contra cambio climático - 路透新闻

{{20171212T135530.401+0000}}Grandes inversores presionan a conglomerados para que aumenten acción contra cambio climáticoPor Alister Doyle

OSLO, 12 dic (Reuters) - Más de 200 inversores institucionales que administran 26 billones de dólares en activos se comprometieron el martes a aumentar la presión sobre los emisores corporativos de gases de efecto invernadero más grandes del mundo para que combatan el cambio climático.

Dos años después de que 195 países sellaron el Acuerdo de París, inversores como Pacific Investment Management Co, Amundi, Legal & General Investment Management, Northern Trust y Aegon dijeron que buscarán trabajar con las 100 empresas más contaminantes del mundo para limitar sus emisiones en un plan a cinco años.

Según ellos, esto sería más efectivo que amenazar con quitar sus inversiones de estas compañías, entre las que se encuentran Coal India , Gazprom , Exxon Mobil y China Petroleum & Chemical Corp <600028.SS>.

"Les pediremos a las compañías (...) que limiten y reduzcan las emisiones en línea con los objetivos (del Acuerdo) de París", dijo Anne Simpson, directora de sostenibilidad de las inversiones del Sistema de Retiro de Empleados Públicos de California.

Esto implicaría un recorte de aproximadamente un 80 por ciento en las emisiones de gases de efecto invernadero para el 2050, agregó Simpson en una conferencia telefónica con periodistas.

Los inversores dijeron que además instarán a las empresas a mejorar la difusión de información sobre las emisiones tóxicas, incluidas aquellas por el uso de sus productos, y aumentar la administración de riesgos y oportunidades climáticas.

El presidente de Francia, Emmanuel Macron, liderará el martes una cumbre en París para avanzar sobre el pacto sellado en 2015, que se ha visto debilitado tras la decisión del mandatario Donald Trump de retirar a Estados Unidos y en cambio reforzar la industria de combustibles fósiles de su país.

Bajo el plan anunciado por los inversores, sólo se apelará a la desinversión como último recurso. Si los grandes emisores de gases contaminantes se resisten a cooperar con ellos, los accionistas podrían aumentar la presión mediante comunicados públicos, resoluciones y votaciones.

WALL STREET-Stocks to watch del 12 dicembre - 路透新闻

{{20171212T125058.605+0000}}WALL STREET-Stocks to watch del 12 dicembre12 dicembre (Reuters) - I futures sugli indici azionari statunitensi sono positivi in vista dell'incontro di due giorni della Federal Reserve, che si prevede prosegua nella fase di allentamento dei provvedimenti messi in campo con la crisi finanziaria, aumentando i tassi di interesse per la terza volta in un anno.

Gli investitori guarderanno alle valutazioni della Fed, anche in termini di forza dell'economia.

La banca centrale ha previsto tre aumenti dei tassi nel 2018, ma la crescita contenuta dei salari e un'inflazione al di sotto delle previsioni della Fed hanno portato diversi analisti a pensare che la banca centrale stia agendo troppo rapidamente in termini di aumento dei tassi.

Intorno alle 13,45 italiane il futures e-minis sullo S&P 500 guadagna lo 0,11%, quello sul Nasdaq lo 0,02% e quello sul Dow Jones <1YMc1> lo 0,20%.

Sul mercato obbligazionario il benchmark decennale perde 2/32 e rende il 2,39%, il trentennale 4/32 con un rendimento del 2,78%.

Tra i titoli in evidenza oggi:

** Exxon , Chevron e Schlumberger segnano rialzi compresi tra lo 0,28 e lo 0,65% negli scambi del premarket, sostenuti dal rialzo del greggio, che oggi è tornato sopra quota 65 dollari, per la prima volta da metà 2015.

** Boeing sale dell'1,53%, dopo che la società ha detto che aumenterà il dividendo trimestrale del 20% e rimpiazzerà le attuali autorizzazioni ad acquistare azioni proprie con un piano da 18 miliardi.

** Comcast segna +1,85%, dopo aver rinunciato all'offerta per buona parte degli asset di Twenty-First Century Fox , lasciando Walt Disney , +0,72%, come unico pretendente dell'accordo da 40 miliardi di dollari.

* BHP hires Barclays, Citi, BAML and GS

By Clara Denina and David French

LONDON/NEW YORK, Dec 12 (Reuters) - BHP , the world's largest miner, has asked four investment banks to help it prepare for either a sale or spin-off of its underperforming U.S. shale oil and gas unit, with a view to taking a decision in early 2018, sources said.

BHP said in August it aimed to sell its unconventional onshore shale assets in the Eagle Ford, Permian, Haynesville and Fayetteville basins, which it acquired at the height of the oil boom and could be valued at more than $10 billion.

It has hired Barclays and Bank of America-Merrill Lynch to assess options for the sale of assets, including whether they would be sold together or separately, as they may appeal to different potential buyers, the sources said.

It has also asked Citi and Goldman Sachs to research the potential spin-off of the unit into a new company, the sources added.

BHP, Citi, Bank of America-Merrill Lynch declined to comment. Barclays and Goldman Sachs did not reply to a request for comment.

Although global oil prices have steadied after sinking to multi-year lows of $27 a barrel in 2016, they remain some 40 percent lower than the $112 highs hit in 2014.

The company is now pursuing two potential exits: a sale of the assets or separation into a standalone company, which is usually a tax-free solution for the parent company.

BHP will keep its conventional assets in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, Australia and Trinidad and Tobago. [nL4N1L75D4]

BAD BETS

The miner's entire petroleum division, valued at more than $20 billion, was its second-biggest earner behind iron ore until 2014.[nL4N1II022]

But bad bets on U.S. shale and collapsing oil and gas prices turned it into a big drag from 2015. As a result, U.S. activist investor Elliott Advisors, which has built up a 5 percent stake in BHP's London-listed arm, urged the sale of the whole U.S. petroleum business to help boost shareholder value. [nL4N1L75D4]

Hurt by the oil pain plus the woes from a dam disaster in Brazil in late 2015 at a mine it half owns, the miner's share performance this year so far was the weakest compared to major peers Rio Tinto , Glencore and Anglo American . BHP is the biggest by market capitalization of them all.

"Splitting the business into a standalone company would give shares back to shareholders," one of the sources said.

However, they all pointed out that this could be a problem because BHP's shareholders are mostly mining investors who wouldn't want to be holding oil shares.

The company could consider selling some or all of the shares of the newly formed company to the market via a public listing, with the proceeds of such an offering going to BHP shareholders.

This would be the second demerger in three years for the company, which spun off its aluminum, manganese, nickel, silver and coal assets into South32 in 2015.

The mining company will run the sale of its gas-rich Fayetteville field in Arkansas, for which it hired Barclays back in May, separately, one of the sources said.[nL4N1HY1CF][nL8N1IO305]

Bankers expect companies like Chevron , Occidental Petroleum , Statoil and Exxon Mobil to be interested in the Permian assets, viewed as the highest quality, while Eagle Ford may be less attractive as a single asset and may need to be sold in parts.

Its Hayensville assets will likely attract interest from private equity buyers, sources added.

BHP said in August it aimed to sell its unconventional onshore shale assets in the Eagle Ford, Permian, Haynesville and Fayetteville basins, which it acquired at the height of the oil boom and could be valued at more than $10 billion.

It has hired Barclays and Bank of America-Merrill Lynch to assess options for the sale of assets, including whether they would be sold together or separately, as they may appeal to different potential buyers, the sources said.

It has also asked Citi and Goldman Sachs to research the potential spin-off of the unit into a new company, the sources added.

BHP, Citi, Bank of America-Merrill Lynch declined to comment. Barclays and Goldman Sachs did not reply to a request for comment.

Although global oil prices have steadied after sinking to multi-year lows of $27 a barrel in 2016, they remain some 40 percent lower than the $112 highs hit in 2014.

The company is now pursuing two potential exits: a sale of the assets or separation into a standalone company, which is usually a tax-free solution for the parent company.

BHP will keep its conventional assets in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, Australia and Trinidad and Tobago. [nL4N1L75D4]

BAD BETS

The miner's entire petroleum division, valued at more than $20 billion, was its second-biggest earner behind iron ore until 2014.[nL4N1II022]

But bad bets on U.S. shale and collapsing oil and gas prices turned it into a big drag from 2015. As a result, U.S. activist investor Elliott Advisors, which has built up a 5 percent stake in BHP's London-listed arm, urged the sale of the whole U.S. petroleum business to help boost shareholder value. [nL4N1L75D4]

Hurt by the oil pain plus the woes from a dam disaster in Brazil in late 2015 at a mine it half owns, the miner's share performance this year so far was the weakest compared to major peers Rio Tinto , Glencore and Anglo American . BHP is the biggest by market capitalization of them all.

"Splitting the business into a standalone company would give shares back to shareholders," one of the sources said.

However, they all pointed out that this could be a problem because BHP's shareholders are mostly mining investors who wouldn't want to be holding oil shares.

The company could consider selling some or all of the shares of the newly formed company to the market via a public listing, with the proceeds of such an offering going to BHP shareholders.

This would be the second demerger in three years for the company, which spun off its aluminum, manganese, nickel, silver and coal assets into South32 in 2015.

The mining company will run the sale of its gas-rich Fayetteville field in Arkansas, for which it hired Barclays back in May, separately, one of the sources said.[nL4N1HY1CF][nL8N1IO305]

Bankers expect companies like Chevron , Occidental Petroleum , Statoil and Exxon Mobil to be interested in the Permian assets, viewed as the highest quality, while Eagle Ford may be less attractive as a single asset and may need to be sold in parts.

Its Hayensville assets will likely attract interest from private equity buyers, sources added.

Norway parties inclined to back fund's plan to slash oil exposure -report - 路透新闻

{{20171212T084218.566+0000}}Norway parties inclined to back fund's plan to slash oil exposure -reportOSLO, Dec 12 (Reuters) - Norway's $1 trillion sovereign wealth fund, the world's largest, will probably win backing from parliament for its proposal to cut most oil and gas stocks from its portfolio, business daily Dagens Naeringsliv reported on Tuesday.

If adopted by parliament, the fund would over time divest billions of dollars from oil and gas stocks, which now represent 6 percent - or around $37 billion - of its benchmark equity index.

The fund last month suggested it should cut oil and gas companies from its benchmark index to make the Norwegian government's wealth less vulnerable to low crude prices. [nL8N1NM4UW]

A majority of parties in Norway's parliament, including the top opposition Labour Party and the smaller Centre Party, the Socialist Left and the Christian Democrats, told Dagens Naeringsliv they were inclined to back the proposal.

The Conservative-led minority government has said it will study the suggestion and give its opinion in the autumn of 2018, ahead of a potential decision by parliament in 2019.

While most of the opposition parties said they will take the government's view into account before making a final decision, they have the power to decide the outcome among themselves.

The fund is among the top investors in a wide range of oil companies. At the end of 2016 it held 2.3 percent of Royal Dutch Shell , 1.7 percent of BP , 0.9 percent of Chevron and 0.8 percent of Exxon Mobil .

It also held 1.7 percent of Italy's Eni , 1.6 percent of France's Total and 0.9 percent of Sweden's Lundin Petroleum , among others.

Big investors press major companies to step up climate action - 路透新闻

{{20171212T080101.425+0000}}Big investors press major companies to step up climate actionBy Alister Doyle

OSLO, Dec 12 (Reuters) - More than 200 institutional investors with $26 trillion in assets under management said on Tuesday they would step up pressure on the world's biggest corporate greenhouse gas emitters to combat climate change.

Two years to the day since 195 governments adopted the Paris climate agreement, investors including Pacific Investment Management Co, Amundi, Legal & General Investment Management, Northern Trust and Aegon said they aimed to work with the 100 biggest polluting companies to curb emissions under a five-year plan.

That, they said, would be more effective than threatening to pull the plug on their investments in such companies, which include Coal India , Gazprom , Exxon Mobil and China Petroleum & Chemical Corp <600028.SS>.

"We will be asking companies ... to curb emissions and bring them down in line with the Paris goals," said Anne Simpson, investment director of sustainability at the California Public Employees' Retirement System.

That would mean roughly an 80 percent cut in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, she told reporters on a teleconference, beyond the ambition of most companies.

The investors said they were also calling on companies to improve disclosure of greenhouse gas emissions, including those from the use of their products, and to step up governance of climate risks and opportunities.

French President Emmanuel Macron will hold a summit in Paris on Tuesday to build on the 2015 climate accord, which has been weakened by President Donald Trump's plan to pull the United States out and instead bolster the U.S. fossil fuel industry. [nL8N1O75Z7] [nL1N1IZ1BA]

Under the investors' plan, divestment would only be a last resort. If big emitters refuse to cooperate with them, shareholders could ratchet up pressure with public statements, resolutions and votes.

Such measures can work, they said. In May, for instance, 62 percent of shareholders in Exxon Mobil voted for greater transparency about climate risks of oil and gas despite opposition from the board. [nL1N1IX15V]

"To talk about this as 'if you don't do what we want we're selling' in a way lets the companies off the hook," said Stephanie Maier, director of responsible investment at HSBC Global Asset Management.

She said it was better to cooperate with major emitters because they contributed to droughts, mudslides, heatwaves and rising sea levels that threatened investors' other holdings.

In the past, some big investors have divested from high polluting coal or from companies they judge to be out of line with the Paris agreement's goals.

Stephanie Pfeifer, chief executive of the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change which is among those coordinating the five-year plan, said investors were increasingly looking for ways to align their portfolios with the Paris goals.

"We're two years on from Paris – this is a way to showcase there is momentum," she told Reuters.

Among pension funds with strong green goals, for instance, Denmark's $40 billion PKA aims to raise climate-related investments such as in wind turbines and green bonds to 10 percent of its holdings by 2020 from almost seven now.

UPDATE 4-World is losing the battle against climate change, Macron says - 路透新闻

{{20171212T075444.000+0000}}UPDATE 4-World is losing the battle against climate change, Macron saysPARIS, Dec 12 (Reuters)

* Summit takes place on 2-year anniversary of Paris climate deal

* Macron gives bleak assessment says: "We all need to act"

* Trump has said he plans to take U.S. out of Paris agreement

* Investors say will put more pressure on global companies

(Adds ActionAid USA, details on commitments)

By Richard Lough and Michel Rose

PARIS, Dec 12 (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron delivered a bleak assessment on the global fight against climate change to dozens of world leaders and company executives on Tuesday, telling them: "We are losing the battle".

"We're not moving quickly enough. We all need to act," Macron said, seeking to breathe new life into a collective effort that was weakened this summer when President Donald Trump said he was pulling the United States out of an international accord brokered in the French capital two years ago.

Macron, who has worked to establish his role as a global leader since his sweeping election win in May, said modern-day science was revealing with each day the danger that global warming posed to the planet, he said.

"We are losing the battle," he said, urging a new phase in the fight against global warming.

France announced a raft of 12 non-binding commitments, from a $300 million pledge to fight desertification to accelerating the transition towards a decarbonised economy. But there was no headline promise likely to reassure poor nations on the sharp end of climate change that they will be better able to cope.

Public and private financial institutions pledged to channel more funds to spur the transition to a green economy and investors said they would pressure corporate giants to shift towards more ecologically friendly strategies.

Among the commitments, more than 200 institutional investors with $26 trillion in assets under management said on Tuesday they would step up pressure on the world's biggest corporate greenhouse gas emitters to combat climate change [nL8N1OB2K8].

That, they said, would be more effective than threatening to pull the plug on their investments in companies, which include Coal India , Gazprom , Exxon Mobil and China Petroleum & Chemical Corp <600028.SS>.

The European Commission, meanwhile, said it was "looking positively" at plans to reduce capital requirements for environmentally-friendly investments by banks in a bid to boost the green economy [nL8N1OC1HC].

"LITTLE FOR THE VULNERABLE"

Climate change is causing more frequent and severe flooding, droughts, storms and heatwaves as average global temperatures rise to new records, sea ice melts in the Arctic and sea levels rise.

Developing nations say the rich are lagging with a commitment dating back to 2009 to provide $100 billion a year by 2020 - from public and private sources alike - to help them switch from fossil fuels to greener energy sources and adapt to the effects of climate change.

On Tuesday, the European Commission announced 9 billion euros worth of investments targeting sustainable cities, sustainable energy and sustainable agriculture for Africa and EU neighbourhood countries.

Yet the United Nations Environment Programme says the cost of adapting to climate change in developing countries could rise to between $280 billion and $500 billion per year by 2050.

"Despite the hype, the One Planet summit is delivering little for the world's people who are the most vulnerable to climate change," said Brandon Wu, director of policy and campaigns at ActionAid USA.

"Rich countries continue to pretend that new schemes for businessmen to increase their profits will be the center of the solution for the poor."

Macron used the eve of the summit to award 18 grants to foreign climate scientists, most of whom are currently U.S.-based, to come and work in France [nL8N1OB5JE].

Exxon to provide details on climate-change impact to its business - 路透新闻

{{20171212T004730.959+0000}}Exxon to provide details on climate-change impact to its businessBy Ross Kerber and Gary McWilliams

Dec 11 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp on Monday said it would publish new details about how climate change could affect its business in a move aimed at appeasing critics and forestalling another proxy fight next year.

The largest U.S. oil and gas producer said in a filing to U.S. securities regulators that its board agreed to provide shareholders with information on "energy demand sensitivities, implications of two degree Celsius scenarios, and positioning for a lower-carbon future."

Scientists have warned that world temperatures are likely to rise by more than 2 degrees Celsius (35.6°F) this century, surpassing a "tipping point" that a global climate deal aims to avert.

Exxon's statement, which came three days before the deadline for its 2018 annual meeting resolution submissions, said additional information would be released in the near future, but did not provide details. The company's board originally opposed providing shareholders with a report outlining the potential impact of global warming on Exxon's long-term outlook.

Thomas P. DiNapoli, New York state's comptroller, heads one the two lead sponsors of a shareholder resolution calling for Exxon to issue a climate-impact report. He called Monday's decision "a win for shareholders and for the company's ability to manage risk."

However, another sponsor noted the lack of specificity in the company's statement. "This is giving no detail," said Tim Smith, who leads shareholder engagement efforts at Walden Asset Management, a co-filer of last spring's resolution. He said Exxon's statement "needs to be expanded to assure shareowners that they're responsive to last year's request."

An Exxon spokesman declined to comment beyond the filing.

Some 50 shareholder and climate activists earlier this year demanded the company produce an annual report on the risks to its business from extreme climate and government policies seeking to reduce carbon emissions. The resolution was backed by 62 percent of shares voted in Exxon's May annual meeting.

Other energy companies already have begun detailing their view of climate-related risks to their businesses. Refiner Marathon Petroleum Corp recently published a report, "Perspectives on Climate-Related Scenarios," meant partly to address suggestions from the global Financial Stability Board about how to measure and respond to such risks.

Members of the shareholder group had said they were considering refiling had Exxon not agreed to a detailed plan. Big investors including BlackRock Inc and Vanguard Group backed the May resolution and have made climate change a priority in their governance efforts.

BlackRock and Vanguard representatives last week declined to comment on their outreach to Exxon. [nL1N1IX15V]

The report will carry weight beyond the company's next shareholder meeting. Exxon faces investigations by the Massachusetts and New York attorneys general into whether it has misled the public and investors by soft-pedaling climate change risks. Exxon has described the probes as politically motivated and intended to force it and others to change their positions on climate change.

The big funds would likely cast more critical votes in 2018 if Exxon did not respond adequately to the resolution, Jason Malinowski, chief investment officer for the Seattle City Employees' Retirement System, which has about 115,000 Exxon shares, said on Friday.

Malinowski's agency and leaders of two other pension funds separately have asked Exxon director Steven Reinemund to discuss governance reforms, such as changing pay programs and bringing in directors with "climate-competent" perspectives.

UPDATE 4-Broken pipeline cuts British supply during peak energy demand - 路透新闻

{{20171212T001401.000+0000}}UPDATE 4-Broken pipeline cuts British supply during peak energy demandLONDON, Dec 12 (Reuters)

* Oil and gas supplies disrupted during UK cold snap

* Forties is key oil flow for benchmark Brent prices

* Brent jumps above $65 for first time since mid-2015

(Updates with INEOS saying outage could last up to 4 weeks)

By Ron Bousso, Amanda Cooper and Alex Lawler

LONDON, Dec 12 (Reuters) - Britain's biggest pipeline from its North Sea oil and gas fields is likely to be shut for several weeks for repairs, its operator said on Tuesday, disrupting gas flows and sending international crude prices to their highest since mid-2015.

The closure has struck during a winter freeze in Britain, where snow and ice have driven up demand for heating fuel just as gas flows through the network, which carries a third of Britain's gas produced offshore, were disrupted.

"We are working to get the pipeline restored to full operation as quickly as we can safely do so... We have previously indicated a time frame of three to four weeks and we believe it is no less than two," operator INEOS said in a email to customers seen by Reuters.

The pipeline, which carries about 450,000 barrels per day (bpd) of Forties crude, was shut after cracks were found.

It has particular significance to global markets because Forties is the largest out of the five crude oil streams that underpin the dated Brent benchmark, against which other crude prices are broadly based. Benchmark Brent crude prices rose above $65 per barrel for the first time since the middle of 2015 following the closure on Monday. [O/R]

INEOS only completed the purchase of the Forties pipeline system from oil major BP in October. A minor leak had caused a partial shutdown on Dec. 7 and a full shutdown on Monday. INEOS said the small crack has not increased over the past 24 hours.

Paul Wheelhouse, the Scottish energy minister, said there were no plans to shut the 200,000 bpd Grangemouth refinery, which uses Forties crude. [nL9N1NR00L]

"If it's a lengthy outage, then a recovery period for the fields will be long as well," the trading source said.

FIELDS CLOSING

A number of producers including BP , Shell and Chrysaor, said they had closed down oil fields in response.

The largest contributor to the Forties stream, the 180,000-bpd Buzzard oil field run by Nexen Petroleum UK Ltd, a subsidiary of China's CNOOC <0883.HK>, had also closed, two trading sources said. [CRU/OUT]

Monthly loading programmes show the supply of Forties is expected to reach 21 cargoes of 600,000 barrels each this month, equal to a daily supply rate of 406,000 bpd. [nL9N1AF03S]

The closure has created havoc with loading schedules in the North Sea, with one trading source saying cargo owners had been offered options to drop cargoes from the loading programme.

"At this point we would expect a large deferral list for the Forties loading programme to spill over into January," analysts from JBC Energy said in a note.

"The timing of the outage could not be much worse as winter weather is just materialising," Jefferies bank analysts wrote.

Jefferies estimated the closure resulted in production loss for BP of 105,000 bpd, for Total of 55,000 bpd, for Chevron of 45,000 bpd, for Exxon Mobil of 40,000, for Eni of 25,000 bpd, for Shell of 25,000 bpd, for ConocoPhillips of 15,000 bpd.

The Paris-based International Energy Agency, which advises Western governments and coordinates the release of oil from strategic stocks in the case of supply disruptions, said it stood ready to take action but it did not believe this was necessary for the time being.

"The market is amply supplied from other sources and stocks are well above the five-year average," the IEA said. [nL8N1OC4HN]

UPDATE 1-Exxon Beaumont refinery may restart hydrocracker this week -sources - 路透新闻

{{20171211T154755.455+0000}}UPDATE 1-Exxon Beaumont refinery may restart hydrocracker this week -sources(Adds company no comment; crude unit also shut)

HOUSTON, Dec 11 (Reuters) - ExxonMobil Corp may restart the hydrocracking unit (HCU) at its 362,300 barrel-per-day (bpd) Beaumont, Texas, refinery this week, sources familiar with plant operations said on Monday.

Exxon spokeswoman Charlotte Huffaker declined to discuss operations at the Beaumont refinery, but said it continues to meet its contractual commitments.

The 65,000 bpd hydrocracker was knocked out of production on Saturday by a malfunction, the sources said.

The 110,000 bpd crude distillation unit, the smaller of the two, remains shut at the refinery following a Nov. 28 fire. Sources have said the unit may be shut for repairs until late January. [nL1N1O41BF]

México culpa Brasil por fracasso de leilão de água profunda no país - 路透新闻

{{20171208T194654.266+0000}}México culpa Brasil por fracasso de leilão de água profunda no paísCIDADE DO MÉXICO, 8 Dez (Reuters) - A petroleira estatal mexicana Pemex colocou a culpa do cancelamento de um projeto de águas profundas possivelmente lucrativo no Golfo do México sobre o fraco apetite de investidores devido à concorrência dos recentes leilões no Brasil e baixos preços do petróleo.

O órgão regulador de petróleo do país cancelou na quinta-feira uma licitação para o projeto Nobilis-Maximino, uma joint venture com a Pemex [PEMX.UL], uma vez que o interesse de companhias não foi tão forte quanto o esperado inicialmente.

Nesta sexta-feira, a Pemex citou um leilão de blocos de pré-sal no Brasil realizado no fim de outubro como o culpado por reduzir o interesse em seu projeto. Seis dos oito blocos no Brasil foram conquistados por grandes petroleiras, incluindo a Royal Dutch Shell e ExxonMobil . [nL2N1N21PZ]

"Um fator que afetou o apetite por novos projetos foi o compromisso de investimento assumido recentemente por possíveis ofertantes", disse a Pemex em nota. Companhias que ganharam blocos no Brasil haviam olhado dados do Nobilis-Maximino, acrescentou.

Quase 30 companhias haviam começado o processo de pré-qualificação para o leilão mexicano, segundo dados da Comissão Nacional de Hidrocarbono, incluindo a norte-americana Chevron e a inglesa BP .

O fracasso do projeto é um retrocesso na abertura energética do México após décadas de monopólio da Pemex.

Nobilis-Maximino fica em águas profundas no golfo do México perto da fronteira marítimas com os Estados Unidos no produtivo cinturão de Perdido Fold, e tem estimativas de conter reservas de cerca de 502 milhões de petróleo.

UPDATE 1-Exxon Beaumont refinery may restart hydrocracker this week -sources - 路透新闻

{{20171211T154755.455+0000}}UPDATE 1-Exxon Beaumont refinery may restart hydrocracker this week -sources(Adds company no comment; crude unit also shut)

HOUSTON, Dec 11 (Reuters) - ExxonMobil Corp may restart the hydrocracking unit (HCU) at its 362,300 barrel-per-day (bpd) Beaumont, Texas, refinery this week, sources familiar with plant operations said on Monday.

Exxon spokeswoman Charlotte Huffaker declined to discuss operations at the Beaumont refinery, but said it continues to meet its contractual commitments.

The 65,000 bpd hydrocracker was knocked out of production on Saturday by a malfunction, the sources said.

The 110,000 bpd crude distillation unit, the smaller of the two, remains shut at the refinery following a Nov. 28 fire. Sources have said the unit may be shut for repairs until late January. [nL1N1O41BF]

México culpa Brasil por fracasso de leilão de água profunda no país - 路透新闻

{{20171208T194654.266+0000}}México culpa Brasil por fracasso de leilão de água profunda no paísCIDADE DO MÉXICO, 8 Dez (Reuters) - A petroleira estatal mexicana Pemex colocou a culpa do cancelamento de um projeto de águas profundas possivelmente lucrativo no Golfo do México sobre o fraco apetite de investidores devido à concorrência dos recentes leilões no Brasil e baixos preços do petróleo.

O órgão regulador de petróleo do país cancelou na quinta-feira uma licitação para o projeto Nobilis-Maximino, uma joint venture com a Pemex [PEMX.UL], uma vez que o interesse de companhias não foi tão forte quanto o esperado inicialmente.

Nesta sexta-feira, a Pemex citou um leilão de blocos de pré-sal no Brasil realizado no fim de outubro como o culpado por reduzir o interesse em seu projeto. Seis dos oito blocos no Brasil foram conquistados por grandes petroleiras, incluindo a Royal Dutch Shell e ExxonMobil . [nL2N1N21PZ]

"Um fator que afetou o apetite por novos projetos foi o compromisso de investimento assumido recentemente por possíveis ofertantes", disse a Pemex em nota. Companhias que ganharam blocos no Brasil haviam olhado dados do Nobilis-Maximino, acrescentou.

Quase 30 companhias haviam começado o processo de pré-qualificação para o leilão mexicano, segundo dados da Comissão Nacional de Hidrocarbono, incluindo a norte-americana Chevron e a inglesa BP .

O fracasso do projeto é um retrocesso na abertura energética do México após décadas de monopólio da Pemex.

Nobilis-Maximino fica em águas profundas no golfo do México perto da fronteira marítimas com os Estados Unidos no produtivo cinturão de Perdido Fold, e tem estimativas de conter reservas de cerca de 502 milhões de petróleo.

REFILE-UPDATE 1-Exxon takes climate-change probe fight to Massachusetts top court - 路透新闻

{{20171205T185723.861+0000}}REFILE-UPDATE 1-Exxon takes climate-change probe fight to Massachusetts top court(Adds dropped word "of" in 3rd paragraph, removes extra "if" in 7th paragraph)

By Nate Raymond

BOSTON, Dec 5 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp urged Massachusetts' top court on Tuesday to block the state's attorney general from obtaining records to investigate whether the company for decades concealed its knowledge of the role fossil fuels have on climate change.

A lawyer for Exxon told justices on the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court that his arguments were focused only on whether Attorney General Maura Healey had jurisdiction to seek records to probe whether the oil company misled consumers and investors.

"We are not asking this court to weigh in on the causes of climate change," Justin Anderson, Exxon's lawyer, said.

But Anderson said Healey was improperly trying to establish jurisdiction in part based on more than 300 Exxon-branded gas stations in Massachusetts operated by franchisees to justify probing the Texas-based company's actions elsewhere.

"They can only be held to account here for what they've done here," Anderson said.

Richard Johnston, Healey's chief legal counsel, countered that Exxon had control over the franchisees' marketing and conducted advertising on their behalf.

"We should be able to find out whether they knew about impact of fossil fuels on global warming so they should have said more in those advertisements," Johnston said.

He urged the court to allow Healey to carry on her probe into whether Exxon failed to disclose what it knew to consumers and investors and engaged in a campaign to sow doubts about the science of climate change.

Healey, a Democrat, and New York Democratic Attorney General Eric Schneiderman sought records following news reports in 2015 how Exxon's own scientists determined that reducing fossil fuel combustion was needed to mitigate the impact of climate change.

Those reports by InsideClimate News and the Los Angeles Times were based on documents from the 1970s and 1980s. Exxon contends that the documents were not inconsistent with its public positions.

After Healey issued a demand for documents in April 2016, Exxon filed a lawsuit challenging the records request and another case in federal court challenging her and Schneiderman's investigations.[nL2N1H62AZ]

Tuesday's hearing came after Exxon appealed a lower-court judge's January ruling denying its request to avoid handing over the documents.[nL1N1F202W]

While the six justices gave no indication how they would rule, some expressed skepticism that the 300 stations could not create jurisdiction, even if consumers bought gas from a franchisee.

U.S. oil industry group launches voluntary program to cut methane  - 路透新闻

{{20171205T184523.491+0000}}U.S. oil industry group launches voluntary program to cut methane By Timothy Gardner

WASHINGTON, Dec 5 (Reuters) - The American Petroleum Institute on Tuesday launched a voluntary program to cut emissions of the greenhouse gas methane from oil and gas operations, a move environmentalists said was not strong enough to adequately protect the climate.

Under the program, agreed to by 26 companies including Exxon Mobil subsidiary XTO Energy, Shell , and Pioneer Natural Resources , drillers aim to reduce emissions of methane by plugging leaks, reducing venting at aging wells, and replacing or retrofitting equipment called pneumatic controllers.

The program, on both existing and new facilities, does not set numerical goals to reduce the emissions.

"There's a lot of different ways to look at the data, we could get wrapped around percentages," Eric Milito, the head of upstream and industry operations at the API, said about why the program does not set numerical goals. It is a "surgical approach" where the industry sees it is targeting the top three areas where technology and methods to reduce emissions exist, he said.

The Interior Department's rules on methane waste from drillers on public lands, where about 9 percent of the natural gas and 5 percent of the oil was produced in the United States last fiscal year, went into effect in January. But the administration of President Donald Trump, which is trying to maximize output of fossil fuels, has sought to delay implementation of the rule, a move a federal judge struck down in October.

The API said most companies will agree to take action on each of the three areas, but only have to agree to reducing emissions in one of the areas.

Companies will implement the agreement in January and submit annual reports on their progress, available to the public.

Environmentalists criticized the effort. "Self-policing and voluntary measures continue the status quo: undocumented pollution, problems left unaddressed, and no industry accountability," said Lauren Pagel, a policy director, at Earthworks. Pagel said the program is moving in the opposite direction of robust and enforceable national and state safeguards.

The Environmental Protection Agency designated a separate voluntary program called One Future in late 2016 to report methane reductions. But only about 10 companies signed on, out of about 8,000 operating independent producers, as low gas prices made drillers wary to take on new commitments.

Energy companies say the rule could cost them tens of thousands of dollars per well. The API has said the rule is unnecessary because drillers have made strides in cutting the emissions.

Exxon climate-change probe goes to Massachusetts top court - 路透新闻

{{20171205T110000.949+0000}}Exxon climate-change probe goes to Massachusetts top courtBy Nate Raymond

BOSTON, Dec 5 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp will urge Massachusetts' top court on Tuesday to allow it to avoid handing over records to the state's attorney general amid a probe into whether the oil company misled investors and consumers about its knowledge of climate change.

The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court is scheduled to hear arguments over Exxon's bid to overturn a lower-court ruling that required the company to turn over documents to Attorney General Maura Healey as part of the investigation.

Healey, a Democrat, and New York Democratic Attorney General Eric Schneiderman sought records after news reports in 2015 about how Exxon's own scientists determined that reducing fossil fuel combustion was needed to mitigate the impact of climate change.

Healey's office says those documents from the 1970s and 1980s suggested that Exxon failed to disclose what it knew to consumers and investors and engaged in a campaign to sow doubts about the science of climate change.

Exxon contends that the documents, published by InsideClimate News and the Los Angeles Times, were not inconsistent with its public positions.

After Healey issued a civil investigative demand for documents in April 2016, Exxon filed a lawsuit challenging the records request and another case in federal court challenging her and Schneiderman's investigations. [nL2N1H62AZ]

In January, Suffolk County Superior Court Judge Heidi Brieger denied Exxon's request for an order exempting it from handing over the documents.[nL1N1F202W]

GM va permettre aux automobilistes d'acheter en conduisant - 路透新闻

{{20171205T105052.809+0000}}GM va permettre aux automobilistes d'acheter en conduisantpar Joseph White

DETROIT, 5 décembre (Reuters) - General Motors a annoncé mardi qu'il allait équiper ses voitures d'une technologie embarquée de commerce électronique, permettant aux automobilistes de commander des repas, de trouver du carburant ou de réserver une chambre d'hôtel via des icônes installées sur le tableau de bord, au lieu de se servir de leur smartphone tout en conduisant.

Le logiciel, baptisé Marketplace et développé en collaboration avec International Business Machines (IBM) , sera intégré immédiatement, via une mise à jour automatique, sur environ 1,9 million de véhicules des millésimes 2017 et suivants. Environ quatre millions de véhicules de marques Chevrolet, Buick, GMC et Cadillac, vendus aux Etats-Unis, devraient être équipés d'ici la fin de 2018, a ajouté GM.

Le constructeur percevra une commission, dont le montant n'a pas été divulgué, sur les transactions effectuées sur Marketplace, a déclaré à la presse Santiago Chamorro, vice-président de GM chargé des services connectés. Les clients ne seront pas facturés pour l'utilisation du service ou les données transmises pendant l'opération, a-t-il ajouté.

"Cette plate-forme est financée par les commerçants", a-t-il souligné, ajoutant qu'"il y aura un certain niveau de partage des revenus" en fonction de chaque transaction.

Dans la course au clic et aux revenus associés, le Marketplace de GM sera en concurrence avec les smartphones qui proposent une gamme plus étoffée de services. Le géant du commerce en ligne Amazon s'est associé à des constructeurs automobiles comme Ford Motor pour proposer des services de e-commerce à bord via son assistant personnel Alexa.

Pour son Marketplace, GM a noué pour le moment des partenariats avec Shell et Exxon Mobil pour les stations-service. Le seul restaurant disponible au lancement du service sera la chaîne TGI Fridays. Starbucks , Dunkin' Donuts et Applebee rejoindront la plate-forme par la suite.

"Nous allons ajouter plus de fournisseurs", dont certains au premier trimestre 2018, a promis Santiago Chamorro. Le groupe compte également intégrer dans ses véhicules des services de musique, d'actualité et de renseignements.

REFILE-UPDATE 1-Exxon takes climate-change probe fight to Massachusetts top court - 路透新闻

{{20171205T185723.861+0000}}REFILE-UPDATE 1-Exxon takes climate-change probe fight to Massachusetts top court(Adds dropped word "of" in 3rd paragraph, removes extra "if" in 7th paragraph)

By Nate Raymond

BOSTON, Dec 5 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp urged Massachusetts' top court on Tuesday to block the state's attorney general from obtaining records to investigate whether the company for decades concealed its knowledge of the role fossil fuels have on climate change.

A lawyer for Exxon told justices on the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court that his arguments were focused only on whether Attorney General Maura Healey had jurisdiction to seek records to probe whether the oil company misled consumers and investors.

"We are not asking this court to weigh in on the causes of climate change," Justin Anderson, Exxon's lawyer, said.

But Anderson said Healey was improperly trying to establish jurisdiction in part based on more than 300 Exxon-branded gas stations in Massachusetts operated by franchisees to justify probing the Texas-based company's actions elsewhere.

"They can only be held to account here for what they've done here," Anderson said.

Richard Johnston, Healey's chief legal counsel, countered that Exxon had control over the franchisees' marketing and conducted advertising on their behalf.

"We should be able to find out whether they knew about impact of fossil fuels on global warming so they should have said more in those advertisements," Johnston said.

He urged the court to allow Healey to carry on her probe into whether Exxon failed to disclose what it knew to consumers and investors and engaged in a campaign to sow doubts about the science of climate change.

Healey, a Democrat, and New York Democratic Attorney General Eric Schneiderman sought records following news reports in 2015 how Exxon's own scientists determined that reducing fossil fuel combustion was needed to mitigate the impact of climate change.

Those reports by InsideClimate News and the Los Angeles Times were based on documents from the 1970s and 1980s. Exxon contends that the documents were not inconsistent with its public positions.

After Healey issued a demand for documents in April 2016, Exxon filed a lawsuit challenging the records request and another case in federal court challenging her and Schneiderman's investigations.[nL2N1H62AZ]

Tuesday's hearing came after Exxon appealed a lower-court judge's January ruling denying its request to avoid handing over the documents.[nL1N1F202W]

While the six justices gave no indication how they would rule, some expressed skepticism that the 300 stations could not create jurisdiction, even if consumers bought gas from a franchisee.

"They believe they're buying Exxon gas," Justice Elspeth Cypher said. "The citizens of this state believe that's what they're buying."

U.S. oil industry group launches voluntary program to cut methane  - 路透新闻

{{20171205T184523.491+0000}}U.S. oil industry group launches voluntary program to cut methane By Timothy Gardner

WASHINGTON, Dec 5 (Reuters) - The American Petroleum Institute on Tuesday launched a voluntary program to cut emissions of the greenhouse gas methane from oil and gas operations, a move environmentalists said was not strong enough to adequately protect the climate.

Under the program, agreed to by 26 companies including Exxon Mobil subsidiary XTO Energy, Shell , and Pioneer Natural Resources , drillers aim to reduce emissions of methane by plugging leaks, reducing venting at aging wells, and replacing or retrofitting equipment called pneumatic controllers.

The program, on both existing and new facilities, does not set numerical goals to reduce the emissions.

"There's a lot of different ways to look at the data, we could get wrapped around percentages," Eric Milito, the head of upstream and industry operations at the API, said about why the program does not set numerical goals. It is a "surgical approach" where the industry sees it is targeting the top three areas where technology and methods to reduce emissions exist, he said.

The Interior Department's rules on methane waste from drillers on public lands, where about 9 percent of the natural gas and 5 percent of the oil was produced in the United States last fiscal year, went into effect in January. But the administration of President Donald Trump, which is trying to maximize output of fossil fuels, has sought to delay implementation of the rule, a move a federal judge struck down in October.

The API said most companies will agree to take action on each of the three areas, but only have to agree to reducing emissions in one of the areas.

Companies will implement the agreement in January and submit annual reports on their progress, available to the public.

Environmentalists criticized the effort. "Self-policing and voluntary measures continue the status quo: undocumented pollution, problems left unaddressed, and no industry accountability," said Lauren Pagel, a policy director, at Earthworks. Pagel said the program is moving in the opposite direction of robust and enforceable national and state safeguards.

The Environmental Protection Agency designated a separate voluntary program called One Future in late 2016 to report methane reductions. But only about 10 companies signed on, out of about 8,000 operating independent producers, as low gas prices made drillers wary to take on new commitments.

Energy companies say the rule could cost them tens of thousands of dollars per well. The API has said the rule is unnecessary because drillers have made strides in cutting the emissions.

BOSTON, Dec 5 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp will urge Massachusetts' top court on Tuesday to allow it to avoid handing over records to the state's attorney general amid a probe into whether the oil company misled investors and consumers about its knowledge of climate change.

The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court is scheduled to hear arguments over Exxon's bid to overturn a lower-court ruling that required the company to turn over documents to Attorney General Maura Healey as part of the investigation.

Healey, a Democrat, and New York Democratic Attorney General Eric Schneiderman sought records after news reports in 2015 about how Exxon's own scientists determined that reducing fossil fuel combustion was needed to mitigate the impact of climate change.

Healey's office says those documents from the 1970s and 1980s suggested that Exxon failed to disclose what it knew to consumers and investors and engaged in a campaign to sow doubts about the science of climate change.

Exxon contends that the documents, published by InsideClimate News and the Los Angeles Times, were not inconsistent with its public positions.

In January, Suffolk County Superior Court Judge Heidi Brieger denied Exxon's request for an order exempting it from handing over the documents.[nL1N1F202W]

GM va permettre aux automobilistes d'acheter en conduisant - 路透新闻

{{20171205T105052.809+0000}}GM va permettre aux automobilistes d'acheter en conduisantpar Joseph White

DETROIT, 5 décembre (Reuters) - General Motors a annoncé mardi qu'il allait équiper ses voitures d'une technologie embarquée de commerce électronique, permettant aux automobilistes de commander des repas, de trouver du carburant ou de réserver une chambre d'hôtel via des icônes installées sur le tableau de bord, au lieu de se servir de leur smartphone tout en conduisant.

Le logiciel, baptisé Marketplace et développé en collaboration avec International Business Machines (IBM) , sera intégré immédiatement, via une mise à jour automatique, sur environ 1,9 million de véhicules des millésimes 2017 et suivants. Environ quatre millions de véhicules de marques Chevrolet, Buick, GMC et Cadillac, vendus aux Etats-Unis, devraient être équipés d'ici la fin de 2018, a ajouté GM.

Le constructeur percevra une commission, dont le montant n'a pas été divulgué, sur les transactions effectuées sur Marketplace, a déclaré à la presse Santiago Chamorro, vice-président de GM chargé des services connectés. Les clients ne seront pas facturés pour l'utilisation du service ou les données transmises pendant l'opération, a-t-il ajouté.

"Cette plate-forme est financée par les commerçants", a-t-il souligné, ajoutant qu'"il y aura un certain niveau de partage des revenus" en fonction de chaque transaction.

Dans la course au clic et aux revenus associés, le Marketplace de GM sera en concurrence avec les smartphones qui proposent une gamme plus étoffée de services. Le géant du commerce en ligne Amazon s'est associé à des constructeurs automobiles comme Ford Motor pour proposer des services de e-commerce à bord via son assistant personnel Alexa.

Pour son Marketplace, GM a noué pour le moment des partenariats avec Shell et Exxon Mobil pour les stations-service. Le seul restaurant disponible au lancement du service sera la chaîne TGI Fridays. Starbucks , Dunkin' Donuts et Applebee rejoindront la plate-forme par la suite.

"Nous allons ajouter plus de fournisseurs", dont certains au premier trimestre 2018, a promis Santiago Chamorro. Le groupe compte également intégrer dans ses véhicules des services de musique, d'actualité et de renseignements.

RPT-Global factors weigh against Bolivia in gas contract negotiations - 路透新闻

{{20171204T224822.371+0000}}RPT-Global factors weigh against Bolivia in gas contract negotiations(Repeats earlier story with no changes to text)

By Marianna Parraga and Alexandra Alper

SANTA CRUZ, Dec 4 (Reuters) - Bolivia's declining natural gas reserves, rising global supplies and more flexible sale terms in the international market all count against South America's top gas exporter as it negotiates contracts with Brazil and Argentina, its two biggest customers.

At stake in these talks are one of Bolivia's main sources of export revenue and its ability to retain its role as the region's largest gas supplier.

Brazil and Argentina enter the talks with stronger hands: Both are taking steps toward developing domestic supplies that eventually could make them competitors.

The emergence of a global liquefied natural gas (LNG) market with prices increasingly pegged to gas hubs and rising U.S. spot sales are influencing these talks, according to analysts and Bolivian officials.

"The golden age of high prices and no competition is now over," said Alvaro Rios, Bolivia's former hydrocarbon minister and now a partner at consultancy Gas Energy Latin America. "There will be a tough negotiation of prices and delivery terms."

Bolivia should remain a major gas supplier to both countries, but Rios believes the new deals will end up with smaller volumes and prices linked to international gas indices, not crude. Bolivia also is facing pressure to lower taxes and transportation costs on the sales, he said.

FUTURE COMPETITORS

Brazil, whose contract with Bolivia expires in 2019, said earlier this year it wanted to buy less to encourage domestic gas output, which is expected to rise after successful exploration and production auctions this year. Argentina also has lured foreign firms including Exxon Mobil Corp to develop its reserves in the Vaca Muerta formation.[nL2N1LI1RA]

The two are either developing deepwater deposits or shale gas fields in part to lessen their reliance on a supplier whose reserves have plunged by 57 percent over the last decade.

Bolivia's gas production, which grew until 2014 but fell slightly to 19.7 billion cubic meters last year, is expected to decline at least until 2020, according to analysts. Its number of active drilling rigs declined to 4 in October compared with 10 in the same month of 2013, according to Baker Hughes' rig count data.

Bolivia's "role in the Southern Cone is challenged by three components: pre-salt associated gas in Brazil, Argentina's Vaca Muerta shale gas, and LNG," said Wood Mackenzie analyst Mauro Chavez.

The first test Bolivia faces is with Brazil. Bolivia's state-run YPFB has started renegotiating an agreement that covered up to 30.1 million cubic meters per day supplied by to Brazil's Petroleo Brasileiro , which has been recently taking much less than its quota.

The declining purchases have forced YPFB to conduct negotiations with a half-dozen state-run and private firms in Brazil, instead of having state-run Petrobras strike a single deal for all purchases. [nL1N1JO1OQ] [nL2N1GL13L]

Whatever changes appear in Brazil's supply agreement, said government officials and analysts, likely will crop up in talks with Argentina. Its contract for up to 20 million cubic meters per day expires in 2026, but state-run Enarsa has been trying to get more flexible purchase terms, which could lead to an early renegotiation.

Bolivia needs foreign investment to reverse a reserve decline that is now affecting its ability to renew long-term supply contracts. Last month, it unveiled deals with Spain's Repsol , Brazil's Petrobras , Royal Dutch Shell and Pan American Energy that would inject some $1.6 billion into natural gas exploration and production.

Analysts expect Bolivia's low production costs and productive gas fields will continue to provide sales advantages over supplies of unconventional gas reserves and LNG from the United States, Peru and Trinidad and Tobago.

SANTA CRUZ, Dec 4 (Reuters) - Bolivia's declining natural gas reserves, rising global supplies and more flexible sale terms in the international market all count against South America's top gas exporter as it negotiates contracts with Brazil and Argentina, its two biggest customers.

At stake in these talks are one of Bolivia's main sources of export revenue and its ability to retain its role as the region's largest gas supplier.

Brazil and Argentina enter the talks with stronger hands: Both are taking steps toward developing domestic supplies that eventually could make them competitors.

The emergence of a global liquefied natural gas (LNG) market with prices increasingly pegged to gas hubs and rising U.S. spot sales are influencing these talks, according to analysts and Bolivian officials.

"The golden age of high prices and no competition is now over," said Alvaro Rios, Bolivia's former hydrocarbon minister and now a partner at consultancy Gas Energy Latin America. "There will be a tough negotiation of prices and delivery terms."

Bolivia should remain a major gas supplier to both countries, but Rios believes the new deals will end up with smaller volumes and prices linked to international gas indices, not crude. Bolivia also is facing pressure to lower taxes and transportation costs on the sales, he said.

FUTURE COMPETITORS

Brazil, whose contract with Bolivia expires in 2019, said earlier this year it wanted to buy less to encourage domestic gas output, which is expected to rise after successful exploration and production auctions this year. Argentina also has lured foreign firms including Exxon Mobil Corp to develop its reserves in the Vaca Muerta formation.[nL2N1LI1RA]

The two are either developing deepwater deposits or shale gas fields in part to lessen their reliance on a supplier whose reserves have plunged by 57 percent over the last decade.

Bolivia's gas production, which grew until 2014 but fell slightly to 19.7 billion cubic meters last year, is expected to decline at least until 2020, according to analysts. Its number of active drilling rigs declined to 4 in October compared with 10 in the same month of 2013, according to Baker Hughes' rig count data.

Bolivia's "role in the Southern Cone is challenged by three components: pre-salt associated gas in Brazil, Argentina's Vaca Muerta shale gas, and LNG," said Wood Mackenzie analyst Mauro Chavez.

The first test Bolivia faces is with Brazil. Bolivia's state-run YPFB has started renegotiating an agreement that covered up to 30.1 million cubic meters per day supplied by to Brazil's Petroleo Brasileiro , which has been recently taking much less than its quota.

The declining purchases have forced YPFB to conduct negotiations with a half-dozen state-run and private firms in Brazil, instead of having state-run Petrobras strike a single deal for all purchases. [nL1N1JO1OQ] [nL2N1GL13L]

Whatever changes appear in Brazil's supply agreement, said government officials and analysts, likely will crop up in talks with Argentina. Its contract for up to 20 million cubic meters per day expires in 2026, but state-run Enarsa has been trying to get more flexible purchase terms, which could lead to an early renegotiation.

Bolivia needs foreign investment to reverse a reserve decline that is now affecting its ability to renew long-term supply contracts. Last month, it unveiled deals with Spain's Repsol , Brazil's Petrobras , Royal Dutch Shell and Pan American Energy that would inject some $1.6 billion into natural gas exploration and production.

Analysts expect Bolivia's low production costs and productive gas fields will continue to provide sales advantages over supplies of unconventional gas reserves and LNG from the United States, Peru and Trinidad and Tobago.

But the rise of vast new global supplies and greater competition from LNG, primarily from the United States, suggest the terms for future sales will not be as favorable.

At last month's meeting of the Gas Exporting Countries Forum (GECF) in Santa Cruz, producers forecast a market in oversupply at least until 2025. [nL1N1NS0QR] [nL1N1NU0YU]

SANTA CRUZ, 4 Dez (Reuters) - O declínio das reservas de gás natural da Bolívia, o aumento dos suprimentos globais e os termos de venda mais flexíveis no mercado internacional trabalham contra o principal exportador de gás da América do Sul, enquanto o país negocia contratos com o Brasil e a Argentina, seus dois maiores clientes.

O gás envolvido nessas negociações é uma das principais fontes de receita de exportação da Bolívia, e o sucesso dos acordos testa a capacidade do país de manter seu papel como o maior fornecedor de gás da região.

Brasil e Argentina entram nas discussões com mãos mais fortes: ambos estão tomando medidas para o desenvolvimento de suprimentos domésticos que, eventualmente, poderiam torná-los concorrentes.

O surgimento de um mercado global de gás natural liquefeito (GNL), com preços cada vez mais vinculados a hubs de gás e ao aumento de vendas dos Estados Unidos, está influenciando essas negociações, de acordo com analistas e funcionários bolivianos.

"A idade de ouro dos preços altos e de nenhuma competição já está terminada", disse Álvaro Rios, ex-ministro do petróleo boliviano e agora sócio da consultoria Gas Energy Latin America. "Haverá uma dura negociação de preços e condições de entrega."

A Bolívia deve continuar a ser um importante fornecedor de gás para ambos os países, mas Rios acredita que os novos negócios acabarão com menores volumes e preços ligados aos índices internacionais de gás. A Bolívia também está enfrentando pressão para reduzir taxas e custos de transporte nas vendas, disse ele.

FUTUROS CONCORRENTES

O Brasil, cujo contrato com a Bolívia termina em 2019, disse no início deste ano que queria comprar menos para incentivar a produção doméstica de gás, que tem crescido de forma importante com o avanço da produção do pré-sal. A Argentina também atraiu empresas estrangeiras, incluindo a Exxon Mobil , para desenvolver suas reservas em Vaca Muerta.

Ambos estão desenvolvendo reservas em águas profundas ou campos de gás não convencional, em parte para diminuir a dependência de um fornecedor cujas reservas caíram 57 por cento na última década.

A produção de gás da Bolívia, que cresceu até 2014 mas caiu ligeiramente para 19,7 bilhões de metros cúbicos no ano passado, deverá diminuir pelo menos até 2020, de acordo com analistas. O número de plataformas de perfuração ativas diminuiu para quatro em outubro, em comparação com 10 no mesmo mês de 2013, de acordo com os dados de contagem de plataformas da Baker Hughes.

"(O papel da Bolívia) no Cone Sul é desafiado por três componentes: gás associado ao pré-sal no Brasil, 'shale gas" em Vaca Muerta na Argentina e GNL", disse o analista da Wood Mackenzie, Mauro Chavez.

O primeiro teste que a Bolívia enfrenta é com o Brasil. A estatal boliviana YPFB começou a renegociar um contrato que prevê o fornecimento de até 30,1 milhões de metros cúbicos por dia à Petrobras , que já tem importado um volume muito menor que o previsto.

O declínio das compras forçaram a YPFB a realizar negociações com cerca de seis empresas estatais e privadas no Brasil, no lugar de renegociar apenas com a estatal brasileira.

Quaisquer mudanças que aparecerem no acordo de abastecimento do Brasil, disseram funcionários do governo e analistas, provavelmente surgirão em negociações com a Argentina. Seu contrato de até 20 milhões de metros cúbicos por dia expira em 2026, mas a estatal Enarsa tem tentado obter termos de compra mais flexíveis, o que pode levar a uma renegociação precoce.

A Bolívia precisa de investimentos estrangeiros para reverter o declínio da reserva que agora está afetando sua capacidade de renovar contratos de fornecimento de longo prazo. No mês passado, revelou acordos com Repsol , Petrobras, a Shell e Pan American Energy, que injetariam cerca de 1,6 bilhão de dólares na exploração e produção de gás natural.

HOUSTON, Dec 4 (Reuters) - The small crude distillation unit (CDU), damaged in a fire last week, at ExxonMobil Corp's 362,300 barrel-per-day (bpd) Beaumont, Texas, refinery may remain shut for repairs until late January, sources familiar with plant operations said on Monday.

Exxon spokeswoman Charlotte Huffaker said maintenance activities were continuing at the Beaumont refinery, but declined to discuss the status of individual units.

The 110,000 bpd crude distillation unit was heavily damaged due to the high heat of the fire on Tuesday morning, the sources said. [nL1N1NY0O2]

No injuries were reported due to the blaze, which was extinguished about 40 minutes after it broke out, the sources said. Workers were still inspecting the damage on Monday.

The refinery's 240,000 bpd CDU continues to operate.

The CDUs handle the primary refining of crude oil and provide feedstock to all other units.

EXCLUSIVO-Exxon avalia oportunidades em petróleo e gás offshore no Egito, dizem fontes - 路透新闻

{{20171204T122057.595+0000}}EXCLUSIVO-Exxon avalia oportunidades em petróleo e gás offshore no Egito, dizem fontesPor Ron Bousso e Ernest Scheyder

LONDRES/VIENA, 4 Dez (Reuters) - A Exxon Mobil está considerando entrar no setor de petróleo e gás offshore do Egito, buscando replicar o sucesso de companhias rivais no país africano e aumentar suas reservas, disseram autoridades e fontes da indústria.

Representantes da maior produtora de petróleo listada do mundo recentemente conversaram com o Ministério do Petróleo do Egito sobre investimentos em produção de petróleo e gás, disse à Reuters o chefe da pasta, Tarek El Molla.

"Conversamos com eles, os visitamos. Eles nos visitaram... Estamos explorando todas as oportunidades para ter mais e mais investimentos no Egito", disse Molla no intervalo de uma reunião da Organização dos País Exportadores de Petróleo (Opep) em Viena.

"Ficaria feliz em tê-los conosco", disse ele, acrescentando que nenhuma decisão foi tomada ainda.

A Exxon preferiu não comentar o assunto. Atualmente, a empresa com sede em Irving, no Texas, não tem operações de exploração e produção no Egito, de acordo com seu site.

A empresa está de olho na exploração da bacia offshore no leste do Mediterrâneo, de acordo com fontes da indústria.

A Exxon também está considerando oportunidades no Mar Vermelho, onde o governo egípcio está se preparando para lançar blocos de exploração, informaram as fontes.

O Egito em 2016 tinha reservas de 3,5 bilhões de barris de petróleo e 1,8 trilhão de metros cúbicos de gás, de acordo com a Statistical Review of World Energy da BP.

By Marianna Parraga and Alexandra Alper

SANTA CRUZ, Dec 4 (Reuters) - Bolivia's declining natural gas reserves, rising global supplies and more flexible sale terms in the international market all count against South America's top gas exporter as it negotiates contracts with Brazil and Argentina, its two biggest customers.

At stake in these talks are one of Bolivia's main sources of export revenue and its ability to retain its role as the region's largest gas supplier.

Brazil and Argentina enter the talks with stronger hands: Both are taking steps toward developing domestic supplies that eventually could make them competitors.

The emergence of a global liquefied natural gas (LNG) market with prices increasingly pegged to gas hubs and rising U.S. spot sales are influencing these talks, according to analysts and Bolivian officials.

"The golden age of high prices and no competition is now over," said Alvaro Rios, Bolivia's former hydrocarbon minister and now a partner at consultancy Gas Energy Latin America. "There will be a tough negotiation of prices and delivery terms."

Bolivia should remain a major gas supplier to both countries, but Rios believes the new deals will end up with smaller volumes and prices linked to international gas indices, not crude. Bolivia also is facing pressure to lower taxes and transportation costs on the sales, he said.

FUTURE COMPETITORS

Brazil, whose contract with Bolivia expires in 2019, said earlier this year it wanted to buy less to encourage domestic gas output, which is expected to rise after successful exploration and production auctions this year. Argentina also has lured foreign firms including Exxon Mobil Corp to develop its reserves in the Vaca Muerta formation.[nL2N1LI1RA]

The two are either developing deepwater deposits or shale gas fields in part to lessen their reliance on a supplier whose reserves have plunged by 57 percent over the last decade.

Bolivia's gas production, which grew until 2014 but fell slightly to 19.7 billion cubic meters last year, is expected to decline at least until 2020, according to analysts. Its number of active drilling rigs declined to 4 in October compared with 10 in the same month of 2013, according to Baker Hughes' rig count data.

Bolivia's "role in the Southern Cone is challenged by three components: pre-salt associated gas in Brazil, Argentina's Vaca Muerta shale gas, and LNG," said Wood Mackenzie analyst Mauro Chavez.

The first test Bolivia faces is with Brazil. Bolivia's state-run YPFB has started renegotiating an agreement that covered up to 30.1 million cubic meters per day supplied by to Brazil's Petroleo Brasileiro , which has been recently taking much less than its quota.

The declining purchases have forced YPFB to conduct negotiations with a half-dozen state-run and private firms in Brazil, instead of having state-run Petrobras strike a single deal for all purchases. [nL1N1JO1OQ] [nL2N1GL13L]

Whatever changes appear in Brazil's supply agreement, said government officials and analysts, likely will crop up in talks with Argentina. Its contract for up to 20 million cubic meters per day expires in 2026, but state-run Enarsa has been trying to get more flexible purchase terms, which could lead to an early renegotiation.

Bolivia needs foreign investment to reverse a reserve decline that is now affecting its ability to renew long-term supply contracts. Last month, it unveiled deals with Spain's Repsol , Brazil's Petrobras , Royal Dutch Shell and Pan American Energy that would inject some $1.6 billion into natural gas exploration and production.

Analysts expect Bolivia's low production costs and productive gas fields will continue to provide sales advantages over supplies of unconventional gas reserves and LNG from the United States, Peru and Trinidad and Tobago.

But the rise of vast new global supplies and greater competition from LNG, primarily from the United States, suggest the terms for future sales will not be as favorable.

At last month's meeting of the Gas Exporting Countries Forum (GECF) in Santa Cruz, producers forecast a market in oversupply at least until 2025. [nL1N1NS0QR] [nL1N1NU0YU]

"The cost of LNG is slightly higher than the cost of Bolivian natural gas, but on these issues we have to take into account that the most expensive natural gas is the one you don't have," said Bernardo Prado, an oil and gas consultant based in La Paz, suggesting that some buyers may opt for more expensive LNG instead of relying on uncertain supplies from Bolivia.

SANTA CRUZ, 4 Dez (Reuters) - O declínio das reservas de gás natural da Bolívia, o aumento dos suprimentos globais e os termos de venda mais flexíveis no mercado internacional trabalham contra o principal exportador de gás da América do Sul, enquanto o país negocia contratos com o Brasil e a Argentina, seus dois maiores clientes.

O gás envolvido nessas negociações é uma das principais fontes de receita de exportação da Bolívia, e o sucesso dos acordos testa a capacidade do país de manter seu papel como o maior fornecedor de gás da região.

Brasil e Argentina entram nas discussões com mãos mais fortes: ambos estão tomando medidas para o desenvolvimento de suprimentos domésticos que, eventualmente, poderiam torná-los concorrentes.

O surgimento de um mercado global de gás natural liquefeito (GNL), com preços cada vez mais vinculados a hubs de gás e ao aumento de vendas dos Estados Unidos, está influenciando essas negociações, de acordo com analistas e funcionários bolivianos.

"A idade de ouro dos preços altos e de nenhuma competição já está terminada", disse Álvaro Rios, ex-ministro do petróleo boliviano e agora sócio da consultoria Gas Energy Latin America. "Haverá uma dura negociação de preços e condições de entrega."

A Bolívia deve continuar a ser um importante fornecedor de gás para ambos os países, mas Rios acredita que os novos negócios acabarão com menores volumes e preços ligados aos índices internacionais de gás. A Bolívia também está enfrentando pressão para reduzir taxas e custos de transporte nas vendas, disse ele.

FUTUROS CONCORRENTES

O Brasil, cujo contrato com a Bolívia termina em 2019, disse no início deste ano que queria comprar menos para incentivar a produção doméstica de gás, que tem crescido de forma importante com o avanço da produção do pré-sal. A Argentina também atraiu empresas estrangeiras, incluindo a Exxon Mobil , para desenvolver suas reservas em Vaca Muerta.

Ambos estão desenvolvendo reservas em águas profundas ou campos de gás não convencional, em parte para diminuir a dependência de um fornecedor cujas reservas caíram 57 por cento na última década.

A produção de gás da Bolívia, que cresceu até 2014 mas caiu ligeiramente para 19,7 bilhões de metros cúbicos no ano passado, deverá diminuir pelo menos até 2020, de acordo com analistas. O número de plataformas de perfuração ativas diminuiu para quatro em outubro, em comparação com 10 no mesmo mês de 2013, de acordo com os dados de contagem de plataformas da Baker Hughes.

"(O papel da Bolívia) no Cone Sul é desafiado por três componentes: gás associado ao pré-sal no Brasil, 'shale gas" em Vaca Muerta na Argentina e GNL", disse o analista da Wood Mackenzie, Mauro Chavez.

O primeiro teste que a Bolívia enfrenta é com o Brasil. A estatal boliviana YPFB começou a renegociar um contrato que prevê o fornecimento de até 30,1 milhões de metros cúbicos por dia à Petrobras , que já tem importado um volume muito menor que o previsto.

O declínio das compras forçaram a YPFB a realizar negociações com cerca de seis empresas estatais e privadas no Brasil, no lugar de renegociar apenas com a estatal brasileira.

Quaisquer mudanças que aparecerem no acordo de abastecimento do Brasil, disseram funcionários do governo e analistas, provavelmente surgirão em negociações com a Argentina. Seu contrato de até 20 milhões de metros cúbicos por dia expira em 2026, mas a estatal Enarsa tem tentado obter termos de compra mais flexíveis, o que pode levar a uma renegociação precoce.

A Bolívia precisa de investimentos estrangeiros para reverter o declínio da reserva que agora está afetando sua capacidade de renovar contratos de fornecimento de longo prazo. No mês passado, revelou acordos com Repsol , Petrobras, a Shell e Pan American Energy, que injetariam cerca de 1,6 bilhão de dólares na exploração e produção de gás natural.

HOUSTON, Dec 4 (Reuters) - The small crude distillation unit (CDU), damaged in a fire last week, at ExxonMobil Corp's 362,300 barrel-per-day (bpd) Beaumont, Texas, refinery may remain shut for repairs until late January, sources familiar with plant operations said on Monday.

Exxon spokeswoman Charlotte Huffaker said maintenance activities were continuing at the Beaumont refinery, but declined to discuss the status of individual units.

The 110,000 bpd crude distillation unit was heavily damaged due to the high heat of the fire on Tuesday morning, the sources said. [nL1N1NY0O2]

No injuries were reported due to the blaze, which was extinguished about 40 minutes after it broke out, the sources said. Workers were still inspecting the damage on Monday.

The refinery's 240,000 bpd CDU continues to operate.

The CDUs handle the primary refining of crude oil and provide feedstock to all other units.

EXCLUSIVO-Exxon avalia oportunidades em petróleo e gás offshore no Egito, dizem fontes - 路透新闻

{{20171204T122057.595+0000}}EXCLUSIVO-Exxon avalia oportunidades em petróleo e gás offshore no Egito, dizem fontesPor Ron Bousso e Ernest Scheyder

LONDRES/VIENA, 4 Dez (Reuters) - A Exxon Mobil está considerando entrar no setor de petróleo e gás offshore do Egito, buscando replicar o sucesso de companhias rivais no país africano e aumentar suas reservas, disseram autoridades e fontes da indústria.

Representantes da maior produtora de petróleo listada do mundo recentemente conversaram com o Ministério do Petróleo do Egito sobre investimentos em produção de petróleo e gás, disse à Reuters o chefe da pasta, Tarek El Molla.

"Conversamos com eles, os visitamos. Eles nos visitaram... Estamos explorando todas as oportunidades para ter mais e mais investimentos no Egito", disse Molla no intervalo de uma reunião da Organização dos País Exportadores de Petróleo (Opep) em Viena.

"Ficaria feliz em tê-los conosco", disse ele, acrescentando que nenhuma decisão foi tomada ainda.

A Exxon preferiu não comentar o assunto. Atualmente, a empresa com sede em Irving, no Texas, não tem operações de exploração e produção no Egito, de acordo com seu site.

A empresa está de olho na exploração da bacia offshore no leste do Mediterrâneo, de acordo com fontes da indústria.

A Exxon também está considerando oportunidades no Mar Vermelho, onde o governo egípcio está se preparando para lançar blocos de exploração, informaram as fontes.

O Egito em 2016 tinha reservas de 3,5 bilhões de barris de petróleo e 1,8 trilhão de metros cúbicos de gás, de acordo com a Statistical Review of World Energy da BP.

UPDATE 2-Exxon merging oil refining and marketing units  - Reuters News

{{20171201T233435.646+0000}}UPDATE 2-Exxon merging oil refining and marketing units (Adds other management changes, background on merging of units)

By Erwin Seba

Dec 1 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp is merging its refining and marketing divisions to boost profits from its downstream businesses, the first major restructuring under Chief Executive Darren Woods.

Neil Chapman, the head of its global chemicals operations, was named to the company's management committee, a board-elected panel that typically serves as a stepping stone for future chief executives, Exxon said on Friday.

Chapman, 55, joins CEO Woods and four other senior vice presidents on the committee, which oversees the company's global operations. The president of ExxonMobil Chemical Co also was promoted to corporate senior vice president.

The merger of the world's largest publicly-traded oil producer's refining and marketing operations will take place in the first quarter, the company said.

Bryan Milton, 53, president of Exxon's fuels, lubricants & specialties marketing business, was named president of the new ExxonMobil Fuels & Lubricants Co effective Jan. 1.

Dennis Wascom, president of Exxon's refining and supply subsidiary, will become vice president of operational excellence, safety, security, health and environment, said Exxon spokesman Scott Silvestri.

Woods took over the top job in January after former chief Rex Tillerson resigned to become U.S. secretary of state.

The merging of refining, lubricants and marketing is the first major move by Woods since replacing Tillerson and is in the company's downstream operations, which he used to lead before taking over as CEO. [nL1N1NX164]

The reorganization aims to squeeze more profits from the fuel and lubricant businesses as the company works to improve its exploration and production operation, which have struggled since 2014 to adjust to lower oil and gas prices.

The company's downstream sector has grown in prominence since Woods took over leadership of Exxon.

The changes come as Exxon expands its refining division. The company is investing $20 billion through 2022 to expand its chemical and oil refining plants on the U.S. Gulf Coast.

The refining and chemicals arms contributed more than $4.2 billion apiece to 2016 earnings, compared with a $196 million profit from exploration and production. Last year's results were affected by sharply lower crude prices.

RPT-Global factors weigh against Bolivia in gas contract negotiations - 路透新闻

{{20171204T110001.714+0000}}RPT-Global factors weigh against Bolivia in gas contract negotiations(Repeats earlier story with no changes to text)

By Marianna Parraga and Alexandra Alper

SANTA CRUZ, Dec 4 (Reuters) - Bolivia's declining natural gas reserves, rising global supplies and more flexible sale terms in the international market all count against South America's top gas exporter as it negotiates contracts with Brazil and Argentina, its two biggest customers.

At stake in these talks are one of Bolivia's main sources of export revenue and its ability to retain its role as the region's largest gas supplier.

Brazil and Argentina enter the talks with stronger hands: Both are taking steps toward developing domestic supplies that eventually could make them competitors.

The emergence of a global liquefied natural gas (LNG) market with prices increasingly pegged to gas hubs and rising U.S. spot sales are influencing these talks, according to analysts and Bolivian officials.

"The golden age of high prices and no competition is now over," said Alvaro Rios, Bolivia's former hydrocarbon minister and now a partner at consultancy Gas Energy Latin America. "There will be a tough negotiation of prices and delivery terms."

Bolivia should remain a major gas supplier to both countries, but Rios believes the new deals will end up with smaller volumes and prices linked to international gas indices, not crude. Bolivia also is facing pressure to lower taxes and transportation costs on the sales, he said.

FUTURE COMPETITORS

Brazil, whose contract with Bolivia expires in 2019, said earlier this year it wanted to buy less to encourage domestic gas output, which is expected to rise after successful exploration and production auctions this year. Argentina also has lured foreign firms including Exxon Mobil Corp to develop its reserves in the Vaca Muerta formation.[nL2N1LI1RA]

The two are either developing deepwater deposits or shale gas fields in part to lessen their reliance on a supplier whose reserves have plunged by 57 percent over the last decade.

Bolivia's gas production, which grew until 2014 but fell slightly to 19.7 billion cubic meters last year, is expected to decline at least until 2020, according to analysts. Its number of active drilling rigs declined to 4 in October compared with 10 in the same month of 2013, according to Baker Hughes' rig count data.

Bolivia's "role in the Southern Cone is challenged by three components: pre-salt associated gas in Brazil, Argentina's Vaca Muerta shale gas, and LNG," said Wood Mackenzie analyst Mauro Chavez.

The first test Bolivia faces is with Brazil. Bolivia's state-run YPFB has started renegotiating an agreement that covered up to 30.1 million cubic meters per day supplied by to Brazil's Petroleo Brasileiro , which has been recently taking much less than its quota.

The declining purchases have forced YPFB to conduct negotiations with a half-dozen state-run and private firms in Brazil, instead of having state-run Petrobras strike a single deal for all purchases. [nL1N1JO1OQ] [nL2N1GL13L]

Whatever changes appear in Brazil's supply agreement, said government officials and analysts, likely will crop up in talks with Argentina. Its contract for up to 20 million cubic meters per day expires in 2026, but state-run Enarsa has been trying to get more flexible purchase terms, which could lead to an early renegotiation.

Bolivia needs foreign investment to reverse a reserve decline that is now affecting its ability to renew long-term supply contracts. Last month, it unveiled deals with Spain's Repsol , Brazil's Petrobras , Royal Dutch Shell and Pan American Energy that would inject some $1.6 billion into natural gas exploration and production.

Analysts expect Bolivia's low production costs and productive gas fields will continue to provide sales advantages over supplies of unconventional gas reserves and LNG from the United States, Peru and Trinidad and Tobago.

But the rise of vast new global supplies and greater competition from LNG, primarily from the United States, suggest the terms for future sales will not be as favorable.

At last month's meeting of the Gas Exporting Countries Forum (GECF) in Santa Cruz, producers forecast a market in oversupply at least until 2025. [nL1N1NS0QR] [nL1N1NU0YU]

"The cost of LNG is slightly higher than the cost of Bolivian natural gas, but on these issues we have to take into account that the most expensive natural gas is the one you don't have," said Bernardo Prado, an oil and gas consultant based in La Paz, suggesting that some buyers may opt for more expensive LNG instead of relying on uncertain supplies from Bolivia.

Factores mundiales conspiran contra las negociaciones de los contratos de gas de Bolivia - 路透新闻

{{20171204T110000.650+0000}}Factores mundiales conspiran contra las negociaciones de los contratos de gas de BoliviaPor Marianna Parraga y Alexandra Alper

SANTA CRUZ, 4 dic (Reuters) - Reservas de gas natural de Bolivia que menguan, un aumento de la oferta mundial y condiciones de venta más flexibles en el mercado internacional conspiran contra el mayor exportador de gas de Sudamérica, que tiene que negociar contratos con Brasil y Argentina, sus dos principales clientes.

Lo que está en juego en estas conversaciones es una de las principales fuentes de ingresos de exportación para Bolivia y su capacidad para mantenerse como el mayor proveedor de gas de la región.

Brasil y Argentina entran a las conversaciones con fuertes ventajas: ambos están tomando medidas para desarrollar suministros locales que eventualmente podrían convertirlos en competidores.

El desarrollo de un mercado mundial de gas natural licuado (GNL) con precios cada vez más vinculados a los centros de distribución y un aumento de las ventas al contado de Estados Unidos están pesando sobre en las conversaciones, según analistas y funcionarios bolivianos.

"(...) la época dorada de altos precios y no competencia se ha acabado", dijo Álvaro Ríos, exministro de Hidrocarburos de Bolivia y hoy socio de la consultora Gas Energy Latin America. "Creo que va a haber una dura negociación de precios y condiciones".

Bolivia debería seguir siendo un importante proveedor de gas para ambos países, pero Ríos cree que las nuevos negociaciones terminarán con menores volúmenes y precios vinculados a los índices internacionales del gas, no al petróleo. Bolivia también enfrenta presión para reducir los impuestos y los costos de transporte, dijo.

FUTURA COMPETENCIA

Brasil, cuyo contrato con Bolivia expira en 2019, dijo a principios de este año que quería comprar menos para alentar la producción interna de gas, que se espera que aumente después de las exitosas subastas de exploración y producción de este año.

Argentina también ha atraído a firmas extranjeras, incluida Exxon Mobil Corp , para desarrollar sus reservas en la formación Vaca Muerta.

Los dos están desarrollando yacimientos de aguas profundas o de gas de esquisto en parte para disminuir su dependencia de Bolivia, un proveedor cuyas reservas se han desplomado un 57 por ciento en la última década.

Se espera que la producción de gas de Bolivia, que creció hasta 2014 pero cayó ligeramente a 19.700 millones de metros cúbicos el año pasado, disminuya al menos hasta 2020, según analistas. El número de plataformas de perforación activas bajó a cuatro en octubre en comparación con 10 en el mismo mes de 2013, según datos de Baker Hughes.

"El papel de Bolivia en el Cono Sur está siendo desafiado por tres factores: el gas asociado al subsal en Brasil, el gas de esquisto de Vaca Muerta de Argentina y el GNL", dijo Mauro Chávez, analista de Wood Mackenzie.

La primera prueba que enfrenta Bolivia es con Brasil. La estatal boliviana YPFB comenzó a renegociar un acuerdo que cubría hasta 30,1 millones de metros cúbicos por día para Petrobras , que recientemente ha usado mucho menos que esa cuota.

Las menores compras han llevado a YPFB a entablar negociaciones con media docena de firmas estatales y privadas de Brasil, en lugar de buscar un acuerdo único con Petrobras.

Cualesquiera que sean los cambios en el acuerdo de suministro con Brasil probablemente surjan también en las conversaciones con Argentina, dijeron funcionarios del Gobierno y analistas. El contrato de hasta 20 millones de metros cúbicos por día vence en 2026, pero la estatal Enarsa ha estado tratando de obtener términos de compra más flexibles, lo que podría adelantar una renegociación.

Bolivia necesita inversión extranjera para revertir la caída de sus reservas, que ahora está afectando su capacidad para renovar los contratos de suministro de largo plazo. La Paz dio a conocer el mes pasado acuerdos con la española Repsol , la brasileña Petrobras , Royal Dutch Shell y Pan American Energy que inyectarían unos 1.600 millones de dólares a la exploración y producción de gas natural.

Los analistas esperan que los bajos costos de producción de Bolivia y los campos de gas productivos continúen ofreciendo ventajas frente al suministro de reservas de gas no convencionales y de GNL de Estados Unidos, Perú y Trinidad y Tobago.

Pero el aumento de la oferta mundial y una mayor competencia del GNL, principalmente de Estados Unidos, sugiere que los términos para las futuras ventas no serán tan favorables.

En la reunión del Foro de Países Exportadores de Gas (GECF) en Santa Cruz del mes pasado, los productores pronosticaron un mercado con exceso de oferta al menos hasta 2025.

"Evidentemente, el costo del GNL es ligeramente mas alto que el costo del gas natural boliviano, pero en estos temas hay que tener muy en cuenta que el gas natural más caro es el que no se tiene", dijo Bernardo Prado, un consultor que trabaja en La Paz, quien sugirió que algunos compradores podrían optar por un GNL más caro que por suministros inciertos de Bolivia.

By Ron Bousso and Ernest Scheyder

LONDON/VIENNA, Dec 4 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil is considering a foray into Egypt offshore oil and gas, seeking to replicate rivals' success in the country and boost its reserves, officials and industry sources said.

Officials from the world's largest listed oil producer recently held talks with Egypt's petroleum ministry to discuss investments in oil and gas production, known as upstream operations, Petroleum Minister Tarek El Molla told Reuters.

"We have been discussing with them, visiting them. They've visited us... We are exploring all opportunities for having more and further upstreamers in Egypt," Molla said on the sidelines of an OPEC meeting in Vienna.

"I would be happy to have them with us," he said, adding that no decision has been made yet.

Exxon declined to comment. The Irving, Texas-based company currently has no upstream operations in Egypt, according to its website.

The company is looking at exploring the eastern Mediterranean offshore basin, according to industry sources.

Italy's Eni this month is set to begin producing gas from the Zohr field in the Mediterranean, among the biggest discoveries of the past decade.

"After Zohr there was a reassessment of the portfolio profitability in Egypt" by Exxon, one source said, adding that Exxon was looking for "tier one assets" with significant potential.

Exxon is also considering opportunities in the Red Sea, where Cairo is preparing to tender exploration blocks, industry sources briefed on the matter told Reuters.

Egypt in 2016 had reserves of 3.5 billion barrels of oil and 1.8 trillion cubic metres of gas, according to BP's Statistical Review of World Energy.

RESERVES

Egypt has recently ramped up efforts to attract foreign investment in its oil sector to boost its struggling economy.

Along with Eni, BP and Royal Dutch Shell also have significant operations in Egypt in offshore gas production, which is consumed domestically although Cairo aims to become a gas exporter.

Exxon like many rivals has curbed spending to ride out a sharp fall in oil prices in mid-2014.

With its reserves slipping, Exxon CEO Darren Woods, who took over at the beginning of the year, has gone shopping.

Woods has spent or authorised more than $10 billion in investment in the Permian Basin, the largest U.S. oilfield, and in offshore Guyana. [nL4N1F74E1][nL3N1JD3UC]

In November, Exxon and Japan's Inpex Corp <1605.T> signed an agreement with the Abu Dhabi National Oil Co (ADNOC) to boost the capacity of the Upper Zakum offshore oilfield, the world's fourth largest.

Exxon is also close to signing a deal to explore for oil and gas off Mauritania, its oil, energy and mines director said on Wednesday. [nL1N1NZ11N]

In 2016, Exxon's stockpile of total proved oil reserves fell 4 percent to 7.75 billion barrels. [nL5N1HB4U4]

In addition, the oil in its portfolio is in hard-to-reach or expensive places, including Russia and Canada.

By comparison, rival Chevron Corp has been able to boost its proved oil reserves by about 1 percent since 2014 by expanding in the Permian Basin and Kazakhstan.

Exxon's oil production up to the end of the third quarter stood at 3.9 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, down about 6 percent from the end of 2016.

UPDATE 2-Contract worker dies in accident at Exxon's Beaumont refinery - 路透新闻

{{20171202T002401.238+0000}}UPDATE 2-Contract worker dies in accident at Exxon's Beaumont refinery(Adds no comment from employer)

Dec 1 (Reuters) - A female contract worker was fatally injured on Friday while working on a construction project at ExxonMobil Corp's refinery in Beaumont, Texas, a company spokeswoman said.

ExxonMobil spokeswoman Charlotte Huffaker said the woman was employed by Echo Maintenance LLC, which does construction for refineries and chemical plants.

Sources familiar with plant operations said the worker died when a pipe fell and struck her on the head.

Production was not affected by Friday's accident, the sources said. The refinery is already operating at 110,000 barrels per day (bpd) below its 362,300 bpd capacity because the smaller of two crude distillation units (CDUs) remains shut following a Tuesday fire.

The 110,000 bpd CDU sustained heavy damage in the Tuesday morning blaze that caused no injuries.

A spokeswoman at Echo's Port Arthur, Texas, headquarters said the company had no immediate comment.

The woman was working a project to build a SCANfinig unit, which removes sulfur from gasoline to comply ultra-low sulfur gasoline standards, the sources said. SCAN stands for Selective Cat Naphtha hydrofining.

The worker was 31 years old, according to the sources. She was struck by a 24-inch (61-cm) pipe.

In May 2016, a contract worker was struck in the head by a pipe on a construction project at the Beaumont refinery and died.
