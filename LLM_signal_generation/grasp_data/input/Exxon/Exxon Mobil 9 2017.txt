By Valerie Volcovici and Nichola Groom

WASHINGTON/LOS ANGELES, Sept 28 (Reuters) - In a bid to boost energy development, U.S. President Donald Trump's administration is considering shrinking or eliminating 11 marine sanctuaries designed to protect 425 million acres of coral reefs, marine mammal habitats and pristine beaches.

The review is part of a broader strategy to open new areas to oil and gas drilling and "put the energy needs of American families and businesses first," according to the order Trump signed in April that triggered it.

But interviews with energy industry representatives signal the effort will likely miss its target. Opening up these areas would likely help wind power companies - which Trump has lambasted - more than oil producers, they say. And neither industry is interested because of the high costs of offshore development, comparatively rich opportunities on land and the public relations headaches of developing protected oceanscapes.

The White House did not respond to a request for comment.

The U.S. Commerce Department is scheduled to issue its recommendations on the sanctuaries, located in the Pacific, the Great Lakes, and the Atlantic, next month. Most public comments submitted to Commerce favored preserving existing sanctuaries.

While it is unclear how much oil the sanctuaries contain, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management estimates that the Pacific Offshore Continental Shelf holds 10 billion barrels – enough to last the United States nearly two years. Some of that oil may overlap with marine sanctuaries off California's coast.

But the industry has little interest in drilling there.

"Our members are not currently pursuing this opportunity," said Catherine Reheis-Boyd, the president of the Western States Petroleum Association, referring to four marine sanctuaries off California's coast that are under review.

The WSPA represents major integrated companies including Exxon Mobil , BP , Chevron , and ConocoPhillips , and is focused on the region that would be most affected by the review.

Officials for those companies did not respond to requests for comment.

Other sanctuaries under review include the Thunder Bay Sanctuary in the Great Lakes, the Northeast Canyons and Seamounts in the Atlantic, and sites off Hawaii, American Samoa, and the Northern Mariana Islands.

Government offshore drilling lease data reviewed by Reuters shows the oil industry is bidding on less offshore acreage with less money than it has in years, in part because onshore reserves have become easier to tap with new drilling technology.

The average price drillers have bid for available offshore drilling leases in the Central Gulf of Mexico, for example, declined to about $300 per acre this year, from more than $700 per acre in 2013.

Even so, U.S. oil and gas production has surged because of the onshore boom: Production hit 8.85 million barrels per day in 2016, from 5.09 million a decade earlier, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

"It is clear we don't need to take from every portion of our oceans and coasts to maintain a healthy energy economy," Democratic lawmakers on the House Natural Resources Committee wrote in July in a letter opposing the sanctuary review.

THANKS, BUT NO THANKS

Drillers' groups such as the American Petroleum Institute and the National Ocean Industries Association have expressed support for the review, mainly on the grounds that it sends a strong signal of federal support for the oil industry.

Neal Kirby, a spokesman for the Independent Petroleum Producers of America, said that "it's possible to find the appropriate balance between safety, protecting the environment, and making sure we can move forward with responsible offshore energy development."

Trump had campaigned on a promise to bolster U.S. fossil fuels production by repealing environmental rules he says unnecessarily hinder drilling and mining. So far he has moved to roll back carbon emissions limits, lift curbs on federal energy leasing, and ease permitting requirements.

The Department of the Interior completed a separate but similar review in August of some 27 national monuments across the country, which include vast areas of protected land.

The recommendations from that review have not been announced, but a leaked version obtained by the Washington Post showed Interior will recommend shrinking some of the monuments where energy resources are available or industries like commercial fishing and timber want more access. [nL2N1LZ0JQ]

SOLUTION WITHOUT A PROBLEM

Wind industry representatives say that firms could power more than 16 million homes by erecting wind turbines on California's marine sanctuaries - but they would rather look for growth in places where such development is cheaper and less controversial.

California's waters are deep, requiring costly and unproven floating wind turbine technology. Development there would likely also face onerous state regulatory hurdles and potential public opposition.

"The American Wind Energy Association is not advocating for re-visiting any (marine sanctuary) designations," said Evan Vaughan, spokesman for AWEA. "In general, the designations have not been a barrier to offshore wind development."

Trump has long criticized wind power as unreliable, producing only when weather permits. He has also called the industry's turbines unsightly – at one point fighting a project within view of one of his Scotland golf course.

Michael Conathan, oceans policy director at the Center for American Progress, a progressive policy advocacy group, said the sanctuary review appeared to hold mostly symbolic value given the lack of oil and wind industry demand.

"The reality is it is not going to happen unless something drastic happens with the economics," he said.

Grande aposta da Exxon no petróleo brasileiro sinaliza apetite pelo pré-sal - Reuters (Portuguese, Brazil)

{{20170929T164758.168+0000}}Grande aposta da Exxon no petróleo brasileiro sinaliza apetite pelo pré-salPor Alexandra Alper e Ernest Scheyder

RIO DE JANEIRO/HOUSTON, 29 Set (Reuters) - A grande aposta da Exxon Mobil na Bacia de Campos mostra sua vontade de reconstruir suas reservas e abre caminho para ofertas consideráveis ​nos leilões de outubro, voltados às ricas áreas do pré-sal brasileiro, disseram analistas.

Ao marcar um retorno à exploração de petróleo e gás no Brasil após uma ausência de cinco anos, a Exxon levou oito blocos na cobiçada Bacia de Campos, uma das mais produtivas, durante a 14ª Rodada de Licitação na quarta-feira. Seis foram levados em parceria com a Petrobras . [nL2N1M81MP]

O leilão, que atingiu um bônus recorde, incluiu uma oferta da Exxon e da parceira Petrobras de 2,24 bilhões de reais por um único bloco(C-M-346), a maior oferta da história em rodadas do gênero.

Isso mostrou como as companhias de petróleo que podem pagar valores significativos estão dispostas a desembolsar e desenvolver reservas de alta qualidade em lugares longínquos, apesar de os preços do petróleo terem caído pela metade em relação a 2014.

"Se alguém pode fazê-lo de um jeito que mantém os custos baixos para algo tão grande e complexo como esse, provavelmente esse alguém é a Exxon Mobil", disse Brian Youngberg, analista da Edward Jones.

Youngberg afirmou que também espera que a Exxon participe dos leilões de outubro relativos a blocos na área do pré-sal.

A Exxon não respondeu imediatamente a uma pergunta sobre sua potencial participação nos leilões do próximo mês.

Com um valor de mercado de cerca de 350 bilhões de dólares, a Exxon gastou muito neste ano em projetos de expansão de petróleo e gás natural para reabastecer suas reservas em queda, buscando reverter as preocupações de que estaria ficando para trás de suas concorrentes na exploração e produção.

O arremate no Brasil é um "sinal adicional da urgência da empresa em reabastecer sua base de recursos", disseram os analistas da Tudor, Pickering Holt & Co, na quinta-feira, acrescentando que o negócio da Bacia de Campos foi um sinal positivo para os leilões do pré-sal brasileiro.

A oferta recorde de quarta-feira foi cerca de cinco vezes superior à mais próxima, realizada por Shell e Repsol .

A Petrobras disse que tinha expectativa de que alguns dos blocos de Campos poderiam ter também reservas de pré-sal de alto potencial.[nE6N1L805H]

Antes do leilão, a Exxon estava entre as poucas grandes petroleiras sem uma presença em exploração nos grandes campos offshore recentemente descobertos no Brasil.

"Para a Exxon Mobil, a falta de presença no pré-sal do Brasil foi indiscutivelmente a maior lacuna em seu portfólio, especialmente agora que a Shell ocupa uma posição dominante nesta área prolífica e de baixo 'break-even'", afirmou Horacio Cuenca, pesquisador da Wood Mackenzie, em um nota a clientes.

A Exxon abandonou os esforços de perfuração na Bacia de Santos em 2012, após resultados frustrantes.

Mas uma série de mudanças regulatórias durante o governo de Michel Temer, incluindo uma redução dos requisitos que forçaram as empresas a usarem conteúdo local de equipamentos, provavelmente levará os investidores a retornarem à maior economia da América Latina, disseram os analistas.

RIO DE JANEIRO/HOUSTON, 28 sep (Reuters) - La gran apuesta de Exxon Mobil Corp en la cuenca Campos de Brasil muestra su voluntad de pagar para reponer sus reservas y podría despejar el camino a enormes ofertas en las subastas de octubre de las ricas áreas subsal del país, dijeron analistas.

Exxon , que vuelve a las actividades de exploración en Brasil luego de una ausencia de cinco años, se adjudicó el miércoles en una subasta ocho bloques en la codiciada cuenca costa afuera, una de las más productivas de Brasil. Seis los obtuvo en sociedad con la estatal Petróleo Brasileiro (Petrobras) . [nL2N1M81G0]

La recaudación récord de la subasta incluyó una oferta de 2.240 millones de reales (704 millones de dólares) de Exxon por un bloque, la mayor en la historia de Brasil.

Eso mostró cómo las compañías petroleras que pueden permitirse gastos operativos significativos están dispuestas hacer desembolsos y desarrollar reservas de alta calidad en ubicaciones lejanas, a pesar de que los precios del crudo han caído cerca de un 50 por ciento desde los niveles que alcanzaron en 2014.

"Si alguien puede desarrollar un enfoque de bajo costo para hacer algo tan grande y complejo como eso, esa es probablemente es Exxon Mobil", dijo Brian Youngberg, analista de Edward Jones.

Youngberg dijo que también espera que Exxon esté involucrada en las subastas de bloques de octubre en el área subsal adjunta, donde los hidrocarburos están atrapados bajo capas de sal en lo profundo del lecho marino.

Exxon no respondió inmediatamente a una pregunta sobre su potencial participación en las subastas de octubre.

La empresa, que tiene una valor de mercado de unos 350.000 millones de dólares, ha gastado con fuerza este año en la expansión de proyectos de gas natural y petróleo para reponer sus declinantes reservas y contrarrestar las preocupaciones de que está a la zaga de sus pares en exploración y producción.

Sus inversiones incluyen la Cuenca del Pérmico en Estados Unidos, áreas costa afuera en Guyana, y la formación de esquisto Vaca Muerta en Argentina.

Exxon's big bet on Brazil oil could signal major pre-salt role - Reuters News

{{20170928T234318.618+0000}}Exxon's big bet on Brazil oil could signal major pre-salt roleBy Alexandra Alper and Ernest Scheyder

RIO DE JANEIRO/HOUSTON, Sept 28 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp's big bet on Brazil's offshore Campos basin shows its willingness to pay up to replenish its reserves and may pave the way for hefty bids in October auctions in the country's rich pre-salt areas, analysts said.

Marking a return to Brazilian exploration after a five-year absence, Exxon took eight blocks in the coveted basin, one of Brazil's most productive, at an auction on Wednesday. Six were taken in partnership with state-run Petroleo Brasileiro (Petrobras) . [nL2N1M80O5]

The auction's record take included an Exxon bid of 2.24 billion reais ($704 million) for one block, Brazil's highest-ever such bid.

That showed how oil companies that can afford significant overheads are willing to shell out for and develop high quality reserves in far-flung locations, despite oil prices that have roughly halved since 2014.

"If anyone can bring a low-cost approach to doing something as big and complex as that, it is probably Exxon Mobil," said Brian Youngberg, an analyst at Edward Jones.

Youngberg said he also expects Exxon to be involved in October auctions of blocks in the adjoining pre-salt area, where hydrocarbons are trapped under layers of salt beneath the ocean floor.

Exxon did not immediately respond to a question about its potential participation in the October auctions.

Exxon, with a market value of around $350 billion, has spent heavily this year on oil and natural gas expansion projects to replenish its diminishing reserves, seeking to counteract concerns that it is falling behind peers in exploration and production.

Investments have included the Permian Basin in the United States, offshore Guyana, and Argentina's Vaca Muerta shale play.

The Brazil deal is a "further sign of the company's urgency to replenish its resources base," analysts at Tudor, Pickering Holt & Co said on Thursday, adding that the Campos Basin deal was a bullish sign for Brazil's pre-salt block auctions.

Wednesday's record bid was around 5 times as much as the nearest one from Royal Dutch Shell and Repsol. Petrobras said it had information that some of the Campos blocks had high-potential pre-salt reserves.

Before the auction, Exxon was among the few oil majors without an exploration presence in Brazil's recently discovered large offshore fields.

"For Exxon Mobil, a lack of presence in Brazil's pre-salt has been arguably the biggest gap in its portfolio, especially now that Shell holds a dominant position in this prolific, relatively low-breakeven play," Horacio Cuenca, a researcher at Wood Mackenzie, said in a client statement.

Exxon abandoned drilling efforts in the nearby Santos basin in 2012 following disappointing results.

But a series of policy changes under market-friendly President Michel Temer, including a reduction of requirements that forced foreign businesses to use local partners, will likely tempt investors to return to Latin America's no.1 economy, analysts said.

UPDATE 2-Chevron taps Mike Wirth to be next CEO as Watson retires - Reuters News

{{20170928T192345.707+0000}}UPDATE 2-Chevron taps Mike Wirth to be next CEO as Watson retires(Adds John Watson interview, context)

By Ernest Scheyder

HOUSTON, Sept 28 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp Vice Chairman Mike Wirth will become chief executive next February, replacing the retiring John Watson, the oil and natural gas producer said on Thursday.

The transition brings an executive with experience in the cost-cutting world of refining to Chevron's corner office as the industry emerges from a two-and-a-half year rout in crude prices that has squeezed revenue.[nL2N1L816B]

Reuters reported the change of leadership last month, citing a source close to the matter. [nL2N1L816B]

Wirth, an engineer by training, has worked at Chevron since 1982 and previously ran the company's pipeline and chemicals and refining businesses.

"Mike was chosen for his track record of accomplishment," Watson said in an interview. "He is well known for his time in our downstream portfolio and his work on cost" control.

The move copies rival Exxon Mobil Corp , which this year named refining expert Darren Woods as its CEO, a step seen as prioritizing cash generation to protect payouts to shareholders above pricy exploration projects. [nL4N1E94WG]

The CEOs of rivals Total and Royal Dutch Shell also have experience in refining.

Chevron's board officially voted on Wednesday to give Wirth the CEO post in addition to the role of chairman.

Watson said he told the company's board late in 2016 he was thinking of retiring as large expansion projects near completion in Australia and Kazakhstan and the company taps more of its low-cost shale acreage in the Permian Basin.

"$50 oil is not easy. But we're as well positioned as anyone else," Watson said.

Chevron declined to make Wirth, 56, available for an interview.

Watson, who will not hit the company's mandatory retirement age of 65 for another four years, became CEO in 2010.

The company's growth under him has not been painless. Chevron has struggled with cost overruns at two Australian liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects.

"It's fair to say we've done some things well and there's areas we can improve," he said. "But we've dramatically outperformed our peers."

He pointed out that Gorgon, one of the LNG projects, was already profitable and the other should be as it comes online later this year.

Wirth will also have to contend with growing uncertainty about Chevron's operations in strife-torn Venezuela, where it is the only remaining major U.S. oil producer.

"We have every intention of staying there," Watson said. "Venezuela is among the leaders in (oil) reserves worldwide."

Watson said he had no plans to work for the U.S. government or elsewhere in the oil industry after retirement. He declined to say what he would do next, though said he was considering options.

Last year, Watson earned $24.6 million in pay, share options and bonuses, up from $22 million in 2015. Wirth was paid $9.1 million last year, up from $8.1 million in 2015.

Shares of Chevron were up 0.4 percent at $117.91. The company is set to report quarterly earnings on Oct. 27.

Last year, Watson earned $24.6 million in pay, share options and bonuses, up from $22 million in 2015. Wirth was paid $9.1 million last year, up from $8.1 million in 2015.

Shares of Chevron were up 0.4 percent at $117.91. The company is set to report quarterly earnings on Oct. 27.

BREAKINGVIEWS-Brazilian oil auction gives Temer some validation - Reuters Breakingviews

{{20170928T190857.314+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-Brazilian oil auction gives Temer some validation(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.)

By Martin Langfield

NEW YORK, Sept 28 (Reuters Breakingviews) - At least Michel Temer is getting a nod of approval in one area. The Brazilian president has done his country's economy some good even as his popularity craters over graft charges. Loosening the nationalist energy policies of his predecessor paved the way for a record haul in Wednesday's drilling-rights auction and bodes well for more in October.

Brasilia netted a record 3.8 billion reais, or about $1.2 billion, from its sale of oil exploration and production rights. Exxon Mobil was the big buyer in conjunction mainly with state-controlled oil titan Petroleo Brasileiro . That compares favorably to a paltry 121 million-reais haul from the last such auction in December 2015, when Dilma Rousseff was still in office before being impeached for fudging government accounts.

Among a raft of policy changes aimed at closing the country's fiscal deficit and enticing foreign investment, Temer has eased certain made-in-Brazil mandates for the energy industry. He also has dumped requirements that Petrobras take the leading role, and a hefty minimum stake, in developing the country's much-coveted "pré-sal" or subsalt fields in the Atlantic Ocean. Judging by the latest results, upcoming auctions should attract considerable interest.

Brazilians give Temer little credit for his reforms, which include deeply unpopular proposals to cut pension spending. He faces fresh corruption charges which will require the lower house of Congress to vote on whether he should stand trial or not. A master of legislative maneuvering, Temer is likely to win and finish his term, but more than three-quarters of Brazilians said in a poll released on Thursday that they consider his government bad or terrible. His pledge not to run again at least frees him to push through changes aimed at restoring Latin America's biggest economy to fiscal health.

Mexico, though, may be left fighting harder for validation. It has been carrying out its own oil auctions since liberalizing the sector in 2013, also seeking to attract foreign investment after decades of neglect under state oil monopoly Petroleos Mexicanos [PEMX.UL]. Its next deepwater auction is set for January. With the regional competition now available, overseas bidders may endorse Temer even if his fellow citizens do not.

CONTEXT NEWS

- Exxon Mobil won 10 exploration blocks in Brazil's latest round of bidding for oil drilling and production rights held on Sept. 27, including six in the offshore Campos basin in association with state-controlled oil giant Petroleo Brasileiro.

- The basin lies adjacent to Brazil's coveted "pré-sal" or subsalt area where hydrocarbons are trapped under a layer of salt beneath the ocean floor. Brazil will hold auctions for exploration and production rights in the subsalt area on Oct. 27.

- Brazil garnered a record 3.8 billion reais ($1.2 billion) from the auction round, in which it sold 37 of the 287 onshore and offshore blocks on offer. It had expected to raise around half that amount had it placed all 287 blocks. The last such auction round, in December 2015, raised just 121 million reais. Other successful bidders on Sept. 27 included China's CNOOC <0883.HK> and Repsol of Spain.

- Mexico plans to hold its next round of auctions for deepwater oil and gas areas in the Gulf of Mexico on Jan. 31, 2018.

- Brazilian President Michel Temer's approval rating has sunk further since new corruption charges were brought against him, and 92 percent of Brazilians do not trust him, according to a new poll published on Sept. 28. Pollster Ibope said the number of people who consider Temer's government "bad" or "terrible" rose to 77 percent from 70 percent in July.

ANALYSIS-Energy industry says 'no thanks' to Trump offer of marine sanctuaries - Reuters News

{{20170928T145208.869+0000}}ANALYSIS-Energy industry says 'no thanks' to Trump offer of marine sanctuariesBy Valerie Volcovici and Nichola Groom

WASHINGTON/LOS ANGELES, Sept 28 (Reuters) - In a bid to boost energy development, U.S. President Donald Trump's administration is considering shrinking or eliminating 11 marine sanctuaries designed to protect 425 million acres of coral reefs, marine mammal habitats and pristine beaches.

The review is part of a broader strategy to open new areas to oil and gas drilling and "put the energy needs of American families and businesses first," according to the order Trump signed in April that triggered it.

But interviews with energy industry representatives signal the effort will likely miss its target. Opening up these areas would likely help wind power companies - which Trump has lambasted - more than oil producers, they say. And neither industry is interested because of the high costs of offshore development, comparatively rich opportunities on land and the public relations headaches of developing protected oceanscapes.

The White House did not respond to a request for comment.

The U.S. Commerce Department is scheduled to issue its recommendations on the sanctuaries, located in the Pacific, the Great Lakes, and the Atlantic, next month. Most public comments submitted to Commerce favored preserving existing sanctuaries.

For a graphic on the protected marine areas, see: http://tmsnrt.rs/2y7IWS5

While it is unclear how much oil the sanctuaries contain, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management estimates that the Pacific Offshore Continental Shelf holds 10 billion barrels – enough to last the United States nearly two years. Some of that oil may overlap with marine sanctuaries off California's coast.

But the industry has little interest in drilling there.

"Our members are not currently pursuing this opportunity," said Catherine Reheis-Boyd, the president of the Western States Petroleum Association, referring to four marine sanctuaries off California's coast that are under review.

The WSPA represents major integrated companies including Exxon Mobil , BP , Chevron , and ConocoPhillips , and is focused on the region that would be most affected by the review.

Officials for those companies did not respond to requests for comment.

Other sanctuaries under review include the Thunder Bay Sanctuary in the Great Lakes, the Northeast Canyons and Seamounts in the Atlantic, and sites off Hawaii, American Samoa, and the Northern Mariana Islands.

Government offshore drilling lease data reviewed by Reuters shows the oil industry is bidding on less offshore acreage with less money than it has in years, in part because onshore reserves have become easier to tap with new drilling technology.

The average price drillers have bid for available offshore drilling leases in the Central Gulf of Mexico, for example, declined to about $300 per acre this year, from more than $700 per acre in 2013.

Even so, U.S. oil and gas production has surged because of the onshore boom: Production hit 8.85 million barrels per day in 2016, from 5.09 million a decade earlier, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

"It is clear we don't need to take from every portion of our oceans and coasts to maintain a healthy energy economy," Democratic lawmakers on the House Natural Resources Committee wrote in July in a letter opposing the sanctuary review.

THANKS, BUT NO THANKS

Drillers' groups such as the American Petroleum Institute and the National Ocean Industries Association have expressed support for the review, mainly on the grounds that it sends a strong signal of federal support for the oil industry.

Neal Kirby, a spokesman for the Independent Petroleum Producers of America, said that "it's possible to find the appropriate balance between safety, protecting the environment, and making sure we can move forward with responsible offshore energy development."

Trump had campaigned on a promise to bolster U.S. fossil fuels production by repealing environmental rules he says unnecessarily hinder drilling and mining. So far he has moved to roll back carbon emissions limits, lift curbs on federal energy leasing, and ease permitting requirements.

The Department of the Interior completed a separate but similar review in August of some 27 national monuments across the country, which include vast areas of protected land.

The recommendations from that review have not been announced, but a leaked version obtained by the Washington Post showed Interior will recommend shrinking some of the monuments where energy resources are available or industries like commercial fishing and timber want more access. [nL2N1LZ0JQ]

SOLUTION WITHOUT A PROBLEM

Wind industry representatives say that firms could power more than 16 million homes by erecting wind turbines on California's marine sanctuaries - but they would rather look for growth in places where such development is cheaper and less controversial.

California's waters are deep, requiring costly and unproven floating wind turbine technology. Development there would likely also face onerous state regulatory hurdles and potential public opposition.

"The American Wind Energy Association is not advocating for re-visiting any (marine sanctuary) designations," said Evan Vaughn, spokesman for AWEA. "In general, the designations have not been a barrier to offshore wind development."

Trump has long criticized wind power as unreliable, producing only when weather permits. He has also called the industry's turbines unsightly – at one point fighting a project within view of one of his Scotland golf course.

Michel Conathan, oceans policy director at the Center for American Progress, a progressive policy advocacy group, said the sanctuary review appeared to hold mostly symbolic value given the lack of oil and wind industry demand.

"The reality is it is not going to happen unless something drastic happens with the economics," he said.

UPDATE 4-Exxon Mobil bets on Brazil, buys 10 oil blocks in auction - Reuters News

{{20170927T233120.547+0000}}UPDATE 4-Exxon Mobil bets on Brazil, buys 10 oil blocks in auction(Adds details of additional blocks)

By Alexandra Alper and Rodrigo Viga Gaier

RIO DE JANEIRO, Sept 27 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp vastly expanded its presence in Brazil on Wednesday, winning 10 blocks in the country's 14th round of bidding for oil exploration and production rights, helping the cash-strapped nation fetch a record 3.8 billion reais ($1.19 billion).

Exxon Mobil took six blocks in consortia with state-controlled oil giant Petroleo Brasileiro in the promising offshore Campos basin, after bidding 2.24 billion reais for one block. That was Brazil's highest-ever such bid.

The U.S. company prior to the auction was among the few oil majors without a presence in the exploration of the recently discovered large offshore fields in Brazil.

Exxon Mobil also bought two blocks that it will operate on its own in the Campos basin, which abuts Brazil's pre-salt area where hydrocarbons are trapped under a layer of salt below the ocean floor.

It won a further two blocks in the Sergipe-Alagoas basin that it will develop with Queiroz Galvão Exploração e Produção (QGEP) and Murphy Oil Corp .

The results came as a surprise after Brazil's oil regulator ANP managed to sell just one of 76 blocks on offer in the highly productive Santos basin by late morning.

Analysts had said lackluster oil price performance and dwindling cash for investments might have dented appetite.

But Exxon Mobil, which also made a record bid of 1.2 billion reais with Petrobras for a Campos block on Wednesday, helped Brazil achieve the record take.

Exxon said in a statement that it was looking forward to working with the Brazilian government and other partners in operating the blocks they won.

Asked after the auction why he spent so much on the bids, Petrobras CEO Pedro Parente said he had information suggesting the blocks were part of the pre-salt area, one of the world's largest oil discoveries in recent decades.

The auction was seen as a test of whether market-friendly reforms under President Michel Temer could tempt investors back to a sector struggling after years of state meddling and tarnished by a corruption scandal at Petrobras. [nL2N1M601X]

In the last round, in December 2015, ANP raised just 121 million reais, as tough local content rules under Temer's predecessor Dilma Rousseff discouraged major foreign companies from investing.

Brazil on Wednesday sold just 37 of the areas on offer. Still, the country raised well over the 1.69 billion reais ($529.85 million) it expected had it placed all 287 onshore and offshore exploration blocks.

Officials had said they expected to sell up to 40 percent of the blocks.[nL2N1M71YD]

Environmental activists protested the auction and threatened to invade the Rio de Janeiro hotel where the round was taking place. They were removed after scuffling with hotel security staff.

Other winners included China's CNOOC <0883.HK> and Spain's Repsol which took offshore blocks in the Espírito Santo basin with signing bonuses for 23.55 million reais ($7.38 million) and 23 million reais respectively.

The auction was Brazil's 14th round for blocks outside of the coveted pre-salt area and should gauge appetite for the country's second and third pre-salt rounds next month.

CONSOLIDA-Licitação de blocos de petróleo fecha em recorde de R$3,8 bi puxado por Bacia de Campos - Reuters (Portuguese, Brazil)

{{20170927T194138.143+0000}}CONSOLIDA-Licitação de blocos de petróleo fecha em recorde de R$3,8 bi puxado por Bacia de Campos(Texto reescrito e atualizado com mais informações)

Por Rodrigo Viga Gaier e Pedro Fonseca e Alexandra Alper

RIO DE JANEIRO, 27 Set (Reuters) - A 14ª Rodada de Licitação de blocos de petróleo e gás terminou com um bônus total recorde de 3,84 bilhões de reais, com 95 por cento desse montante sendo arrecadado em lances por blocos na Bacia de Campos, feitos por Petrobras e Exxon Mobil, que voltou a realizar grandes investimentos no Brasil.

Somente os oito blocos arrematados nessa bacia, a última a ser leiloada, resultaram em um bônus de mais de 3,65 bilhões de reais, montante que salvou uma rodada de licitações que vinha registrando pequeno interesse.

Os grandes lances realizados, em uma área em que a Petrobras detém elevado conhecimento, estariam ligados à possibilidade de ali existirem as produtivas reservas do pré-sal, ainda que o leilão desta quarta-feira não tenha tido como foco esse polígono.

"Não pagaríamos o valor que pagamos se não tivéssemos informações de que isso (áreas em Campos) vale", disse o presidente da Petrobras, Pedro Parente, ao ser questionado sobre o assunto.

"(Pré-sal) É uma possibilidade nessas áreas porque está vizinho ao pré-sal, e vamos aprofundar isso no momento da exploração", adicionou ele.

Com um elevado endividamento, o presidente da Petrobras reafirmou que empresa foi "seletiva" em suas ofertas e ressaltou que parcerias como as realizadas com a Exxon são importantes, pois o setor demanda grandes investimentos e há riscos exploratórios.

Nos principais lances, a Petrobras e a Exxon atuaram em parceria. O maior bônus de assinatura do leilão foi de cerca de 2,24 bilhões de reais pelo bloco C-M-346, oferecido pelo consórcio em que cada empresa detém 50 por cento e a estatal brasileira é a operadora.

Mas a Exxon , maior petroleira listada do mundo, entrou sozinha em dois blocos de Campos, com ofertas que superaram 60 milhões de reais, além de ter levado áreas em parceria com Queiroz Galvão e Murphy na Bacia Sergipe-Alagoas. [nE6N1L805D]

Atualmente, a companhia com sede nos EUA detém apenas dois blocos em bacias de menor importância (Potiguar e Ceará).

Em entrevista à Reuters, o ministro de Minas e Energia, Fernando Coelho Filho, afirmou que a entrada mais forte da Exxon no Brasil é uma questão estratégica para a empresa norte-americana. Ele disse acreditar que a petroleira fará também ofertas por áreas do pré-sal, em dois leilões de outubro.

O certame desta quarta-feira ocorreu em meio a protestos de um pequeno grupo de manifestantes contrários à exploração de petróleo, que tentou invadir o local do leilão em um hotel no Rio de Janeiro.

Os manifestantes foram detidos por seguranças e impedidos de entrar. Apesar da tensão, o leilão prosseguiu normalmente e as pessoas que protestavam, algumas vestidas com roupas indígenas, foram retiradas do hotel.

LANCES SALVADORES

Pode-se dizer que os lances bilionários do consórcio formado por Petrobras e Exxon salvaram a rodada em termos de arrecadação para o governo federal, já que contrastaram com os outros arremates "modestos" ocorridos na 14ª Rodada.[nE6N1L8056]

Após o certame, o diretor-geral da reguladora ANP, Décio Oddone, disse que as ofertas na Bacia de Campos "surpreenderam positivamente", com as mudanças regulatórias realizadas pelo governo tornando o ambiente de negócios mais atraente a empresas de diferentes portes.

O número final da 14ª Rodada superou as expectativas do governo, que esperava arrecadar ao menos 1 bilhão de reais.[nL2N1M713K]

Apesar da boa arrecadação com a Bacia de Campos, o total de blocos arrematados na rodada (37) representou quase 13 por cento dos 287 ofertados, um índice baixo frente a rodadas anteriores.

No último leilão do gênero, em 2015, quando a Petrobras não participou em meio ao escândalo de corrupção que atingiu a empresa, apenas 14 por cento dos blocos foram arrematados, ante cerca de 50 por cento das áreas levadas em uma rodada em 2013, após um período de cinco anos sem licitações da ANP.

No leilão desta quarta-feira, participaram ao todo 20 empresas, originárias de oito países. Delas, 17 arremataram blocos, sendo dez nacionais e sete de origem estrangeira.

A 14ª Rodada começou por volta das 9h com a Parnaíba Gás Natural, subsidiária integral da elétrica Eneva levando cinco blocos na Bacia do Parnaíba.

Na Bacia de Santos, onde havia expectativa de maior interesse por parte das companhias, somente um dos 76 blocos foi arrematado pela empresa australiana Karoon.

Quanto à Bacia do Recôncavo, 7 dos 27 blocos foram levados pelas empresas Petroil, Guindaste Brasil, Tek e Great Energy.

Já na Bacia Potiguar apenas um bloco foi arrematado dentre os 62 ofertados, tendo a empresa Geopark Brasil como vencedora, enquanto a Bacia de Pelotas não recebeu ofertas.

A chinesa CNOOC e a espanhola Repsol levaram áreas marítimas na Bacia do Espírito Santo, com bônus de 23,55 milhões e de 23 milhões de reais, respectivamente.

Por fim, na Bacia do Paraná, a Petrobras arrematou um bloco por 1,690 milhão de reais.

Conforme a ANP, a assinatura dos contratos está prevista para ocorrer até o dia 31 de janeiro de 2018. A área total arrematada foi de 25,011 mil quilômetros quadrados.

FACTBOX-Effect of hurricanes Harvey and Irma on key U.S. companies - Reuters News

{{20170926T161318.059+0000}}FACTBOX-Effect of hurricanes Harvey and Irma on key U.S. companies(Adds Chesapeake, Darden Restaurants, FedEx Corp, D.R. Horton)

Sept 26 (Reuters) - Hurricane Harvey, which tore through Corpus Christi in southern Texas on
Aug. 25 and drenched the Houston area with historic rains, killed over 60 people and displaced
more than 1 million people.

The impact knocked out nearly a fifth of U.S. oil-refining capacity. Hundreds of companies,
including airlines, home builders, insurers, oil refiners and retailers were hit, and many of
them are struggling to get back on their feet.

Harvey was the most powerful storm to hit Texas in more than 50 years, causing some $180
billion in damage.

Two weeks later, Hurricane Irma swept through the Florida Keys, submerging about 25 percent
of all dwellings in the region and killing at least 36 people in the United States. Irma caused
about $25 billion in insured losses, including $7 billion in the Caribbean, catastrophe modeler
Karen Clark & Co estimated on Sept. 13. [nL2N1LU0HH]

The following table lists the effects of the two storms on some major U.S. companies:

ENTREVISTA-Governo espera disputas acirradas em leilão de petróleo para levar ao menos R$1 bi - Reuters (Portuguese, Brazil)

{{20170926T152442.427+0000}}ENTREVISTA-Governo espera disputas acirradas em leilão de petróleo para levar ao menos R$1 biPor Rodrigo Viga Gaier

RIO DE JANEIRO, 26 Set (Reuters) - O governo federal espera uma arrecadação de ao menos 1 bilhão de reais com o leilão de áreas marítimas do pós-sal e terrestres na quarta-feira, com a expectativa de que o setor receba novos investidores e também acreditando em uma disputa mais acirrada em blocos próximos ao polígono do pré-sal, disse uma autoridade do Ministério de Minas e Energia.

A 14ª Rodada da Agência Nacional de Petróleo, Gás Natural e Biocombustíveis (ANP), a ser realizada com novas regras pró-investidores, deve ser marcada também por uma atuação mais discreta da Petrobras, cujo foco principal tem sido o pré-sal, disse o secretário de Petróleo, Gás Natural e Combustíveis Renováveis do ministério, Márcio Félix.

O Brasil leiloará 287 blocos de exploração onshore e offshore na quarta-feira, podendo arrecadar pelo menos 1,69 bilhão de reais se todos forem arrematados.[nL2N1M61A5]

"A arrecadação de 1 bi já seria bem significativa e vai estar entre as grandes arrecadações", disse à Reuters o secretário Félix, engenheiro e funcionário de carreira da Petrobras, ao comentar um valor inferior ao total estimado em bônus no caso de todos os blocos serem arrematados sem ágio.

Félix reconhece que nem todos os blocos serão vendidos, mas espera a chegada de novas empresas ao mercado brasileiro e uma disputa intensa por blocos em águas profundas nas bacias de Campos e Espírito Santo.

"O sucesso do leilão não vem só da arrecadação, mas da diversificação do setor com a entrada de novos operadores e empresas, o que vai dar dinamismo para indústria. Quanto mais operadores, maior é o sinal de vitalidade do setor", acrescentou ele.

O secretário destacou que, apesar do maior bônus mínimo ter sido fixado para um bloco na bacia de Sergipe-Alagoas, a grande concorrência deve ocorrer por áreas localizadas na chamada "franja do pré-sal".

"Não esperamos a venda de todas as áreas, há um conjunto grande de áreas que já foi oferecido em outros leilões e tem algumas áreas que vão ter mais atração como Campos, que tem áreas contíguas ao polígono do pré-sal, e a Bacia do Espírito Santo, que são regiões para empresas maiores e onde há volumes acumulados mais expressivos", comentou.

A rodada ainda será um aperitivo para dois outros certames do pré-sal, programados para o mês que vem, com 11 grandes empresas globais habilitadas.[nL2N1M70IX]

Para a 14ª rodada, foram modificadas e simplificadas as normas do regime de concessão para estimular a presença das empresas. Entre as novidades estão a possibilidade de extensão da fase de exploração por razões técnicas; retirada do conteúdo local como critério de oferta na licitação; a adoção de royalties diferenciados para áreas de nova fronteira, entre outras medidas.

Ao todo, 32 empresas, sendo 18 de origem estrangeiras estão habilitadas para o leilão, e a expectativa gira em torno da atuação de gigantes do setor como Exxon, CNOCC, Petrobras, Shell, Total, BP e Repsol, mas empresas médias também despertam expectativa no governo.

"Achamos que a Exxon pode entrar em Campos ou Espírito Santo... as grandes vão mirar nisso e acho que eles também. Há uma área interessante na franja do pré-sal em Campos. No caso do Espírito Santo, há possibilidade de sub-sal parecido com Golfo do México e possibilidades para a produção de gás para atender a o fornecimento elétrico", disse o secretário.

"Os blocos em Santos, em águas mais rasas, achamos que tem mais um perfil de empresas médias", complementou.

PETROBRAS

No passado, o sucesso dos leilões da ANP sempre esteve associado ao desempenho e atuação da estatal brasileira Petrobras.

A petroleira nacional vem focando sua performance no aumento de produção com o atual portfólio, forte redução de custos e diminuição no elevado endividamento, além da execução de um pesado plano de desinvestimento.

Por isso, a atuação da empresa na 14ª rodada tende a ser mais discreta que no passado, segundo Félix.

"Com certeza, será uma atuação mais seletiva, mas a gente espera que faça ofertas, mas em águas profundas", previu ele.

A rodada ocorre em um ambiente de preço do petróleo menos atrativo, na casa dos 50 dólares o barril e um mês antes de leilões de áreas no pré-sal, que prometem chamar a atenção do mundo do petróleo.

Mesmo assim, o Félix acha que esses fatores não inibem o apetite das empresa.

TABLE-Brazil oil regulator clears 11 companies to bid for presalt areas - Reuters News

{{20170926T145031.326+0000}}TABLE-Brazil oil regulator clears 11 companies to bid for presalt areasSAO PAULO, Sept 26 (Reuters) - Brazil's oil regulator ANP
said on Tuesday it has authorized 11 companies to bid in
auctions next month for exploration and production rights in the
presalt region off the Brazilian coast.

Ten of the companies cleared to participate are foreign, and
one is Brazilian, ANP said in a statement.

All already have oil and gas exploration and production
contracts in Brazil, except for Malaysia's Petronas Carigali SDN
BHD, the regulator said.

The government's second and third rounds of bidding for
presalt areas are scheduled for Oct. 27. The first round was in
2013.

In Brazilian petroleum parlance, the term presalt refers to
giant offshore oil deposits. They are located several kilometers
(miles) below the surface of the Atlantic Ocean, making their
exploitation a costly challenge.

ATUALIZA 1-Leilões do pré-sal atraem as maiores petroleiras do mundo, 11 empresas ao todo - Reuters (Portuguese, Brazil)

{{20170926T125412.589+0000}}ATUALIZA 1-Leilões do pré-sal atraem as maiores petroleiras do mundo, 11 empresas ao todo(Texto reescrito e atualizado com mais informações)

SÃO PAULO, 26 Set (Reuters) - Os dois leilões de áreas para exploração de petróleo e gás no pré-sal que o Brasil realizará em 27 de outubro atraíram algumas das maiores petroleiras do mundo, informou nesta terça-feira a Agência Nacional do Petróleo, Gás Natural e Biocombustíveis (ANP), que anunciou que oito empresas foram habilitadas para a para a segunda rodada e 11 para a terceira.

Entre as habilitadas estão a norte-americana ExxonMobil, a brasileira Petrobras, a norueguesa Statoil, a espanhola Repsol e a anglo-holandesa Royal Dutch Shell, entre outras.

Todas as empresas habilitadas para a segunda rodada também estão habilitadas para a terceira. Das aprovadas, dez são de origem estrangeira e apenas uma, a Petronas, ainda não possui contrato para exploração e produção de petróleo e gás natural no Brasil, segundo a ANP.

A segunda rodada vai oferecer aos investidores as áreas unitizáveis adjacentes aos prospectos de Carcará (bloco BM-S-8), Gato do Mato (bloco BM-S-54), Campo de Sapinhoá, na bacia de Santos, e Campo de Tartaruga Verde (jazida compartilhada de Tartaruga Mestiça), na bacia de Campos. Os bônus de assinatura totalizam 3,4 bilhões de reais.

A terceira rodada ofertará as áreas de Pau Brasil, Peroba e Alto de Cabo Frio-Oeste, na Bacia de Santos, e a área de Alto de Cabo Frio-Central, nas Bacias de Santos e Campos. O valor dos bônus de assinatura soma 4,35 bilhões de reais.

No regime de partilha, ganha o leilão o consórcio ou empresa que oferecer o maior percentual de óleo ao governo.

A agência disse, em nota, que havia recebido dez manifestações de interesse para a segunda rodada e 15 para a terceira.

Com restrições de orçamento enquanto busca reduzir seu elevado endividamento, a Petrobras já afirmou que exercerá o direito de preferência em apenas três dos oito prospectos.

A Petrobras estimou em 810 milhões de reais o valor correspondente ao bônus de assinatura a ser pago pela companhia, considerando que os resultados dos leilões confirmem apenas as participações mínimas de 30 por cento indicadas em cada bloco.

Na segunda rodada, a estatal exercerá o seu direito em Sapinhoá, um dos maiores campos do Brasil já em produção, onde a empresa já tem participação, enquanto na terceira a Petrobras exercerá preferência nos prospectos exploratórios de Peroba e Alto de Cabo Frio-Central.[nL1N1IR1FJ]

UPDATE 2-Exxon's Baytown, Texas refinery operations normal  - 路透新闻

HOUSTON, Sept 25 (Reuters) - ExxonMobil Corp said on Monday operations at the company's 560,500 barrel per day (bpd) Baytown, Texas, refinery, the country's second largest, have returned to normal for the first time since Aug. 27.

Sources familiar with plant operations told Reuters earlier on Monday that all production units were back in operation at the Baytown refinery.

The Baytown refinery was shut on Aug. 27 as Tropical Storm Harvey drenched the Houston area. Exxon began restart activities on Sept. 2.

PRÉVIA-Leilão de blocos de petróleo do Brasil medirá apetite do investidor em meio a reformas - Reuters (Portuguese, Brazil)

{{20170925T184937.802+0000}}PRÉVIA-Leilão de blocos de petróleo do Brasil medirá apetite do investidor em meio a reformasPor Alexandra Alper

RIO DE JANEIRO, 25 Set (Reuters) - O leilão de petróleo do Brasil nesta semana testará se a série de reformas favoráveis ao mercado sob o presidente Michel Temer pode atrair investidores de volta a um setor prejudicado por um escândalo de corrupção envolvendo a petroleira estatal Petrobras .

O Brasil leiloará 287 blocos de exploração onshore e offshore na quarta-feira, arrecadando pelo menos 1,69 bilhão de reais se todos forem arrematados.

O leilão de quarta-feira é a 14ª rodada para blocos fora da cobiçada área do pré-sal e deve medir o apetite para as segunda e terceira rodadas do pré-sal no próximo mês.

Trinta e duas companhias irão disputar o certame nesta semana, incluindo a Royal Dutch Shell , Exxon Mobil Corp , Repsol , Total , Rosneft, CNOOC e a estatal brasileira Petrobras.[nL2N1LB1XL]

O leilão será o primeiro do Brasil desde uma rodada fracassada em dezembro de 2015, quando a reguladora ANP vendeu apenas 37 dos 266 blocos ofertados, uma vez que as rígidas regras de conteúdo local sob a ex-presidente Dilma Rousseff desencorajaram o investimento por grandes empresas estrangeiras.

Rousseff e o seu Partido dos Trabalhadores (PT) viram as reservas de petróleo do Brasil como uma oportunidade de desenvolver empresas locais de construção naval e serviços de petróleo, que estavam no centro de uma investigação de corrupção política que prendeu vários de políticos e executivos.

Temer anulou muitas das políticas nacionalistas de sua antecessora em um esforço para atrair mais investimento estrangeiro, enquanto a nova administração da Petrobras está tentando limpar seus processos de contratação.

"O setor do petróleo é um dos mais claros exemplos dessa tentativa de virar a página no passado recente de intervenção estatal", disse João Augusto de Castro Neves, diretor para a América Latina no Eurasia Group. "É o começo de um ciclo muito promissor de rodadas de leilões e investimentos no Brasil."

As denúncias de corrupção contra o presidente Temer têm desacelerado, mas não parado suas reformas, que impulsionaram o índice acionário Bovespa para uma máxima histórica neste mês.

O governo definiu um ambicioso calendário de dez rodadas de licitação até 2019, dando a companhias um maior horizonte para planejamento ao preparar ofertas.

O Brasil também prorrogou por duas décadas um regime aduaneiro preferencial para a indústria de petróleo e gás chamado Repetro, encorajando os investimentos de longo prazo. {nL2N1L41LR].

Uma persistente reclamação da indústria é sobre o processo de licenciamento ambiental exigido, o que significa que muitos vencedores na rodada de licitação de 2015 ainda não começaram a perfurar.

No mês passado, o regulador ambiental Ibama rejeitou o estudo da francesa Total para perfuração na bacia da Foz do Amazonas, ameaçando suspender a aplicação da licença.[nL2N1LH0Q5]

PREVIEW-Brazil oil auction to gauge investor appetite amid reforms - Reuters News

{{20170925T174238.517+0000}}PREVIEW-Brazil oil auction to gauge investor appetite amid reformsBy Alexandra Alper

RIO DE JANEIRO, Sept 25 (Reuters) - Brazil's oil auction this week will test whether a raft of market-friendly reforms under President Michel Temer can tempt investors back to a sector tarnished by a corruption scandal at state-controlled oil firm Petróleo Brasileiro SA .

Brazil will auction 287 onshore and offshore exploration blocks on Wednesday, raking in at least 1.69 billion reais ($537 million) if all are assigned.

Wednesday's auction is Brazil's fourteenth round for blocks outside of the coveted pre-salt area and should gauge appetite for the country's second and third pre-salt rounds next month.

Thirty-two companies will vie for the blocks this weeks, including Royal Dutch Shell Plc , BP Plc , Exxon Mobil Corp , Repsol , Total SA , Rosneft, CNOOC and Brazil's state oil firm, known as Petrobras.

The auction will be Brazil's first since a failed round in December 2015, when oil regulator ANP sold only 37 of 266 blocks on offer, as tough local content rules under former President Dilma Rousseff discouraged investment from major foreign firms.

Rousseff and her leftist Workers Party saw Brazil's oil reserves as an opportunity to develop domestic shipbuilding and oil services firms, which were at the heart of a political bribery probe jailing dozens of politicians and executives.

Temer has rolled back many of his predecessor's nationalist policies in an effort to attract more foreign investment, while new management at Petrobras is striving to clean up its contracting process. [nL1N1KA1AT]

"The oil sector is one of the clearest examples of this attempt to turn the corner on the recent past of state intervention," said João Augusto de Castro Neves, Latin America director at Eurasia Group. "It is the beginning of a very promising cycle of bid rounds and investments in Brazil."

Corruption charges against Temer have slowed but not stopped his free-market reforms, which boosted the benchmark Bovespa stock index <.BVSP> to an all-time high this month. [nL2N1LV25D]

The government has defined an ambitious calendar of 10 bidding rounds through 2019, giving companies a longer horizon for planning as they prepare bids.

Brazil also extended by two decades a preferential customs regime for the oil and gas industry called Repetro, encouraging long-term investments.

A lingering complaint from the industry is the drawn-out environmental licensing process that means many winners in the 2015 bidding round have still not started drilling.

Last month, Brazil's environmental regulator Ibama rejected Total's study for drilling in the Foz do Amazonas basin, threatening to suspend the license application. [nL2N1LF036]

UPDATE 1-Exxon's Beaumont, Texas coker remains shut, other units running -sources - 路透新闻

{{20170925T173932.090+0000}}UPDATE 1-Exxon's Beaumont, Texas coker remains shut, other units running -sources(Adds company comment, background on coker, paragraphs 2, 4)

HOUSTON, Sept 25 (Reuters) - The coking unit remains shut at Exxon Mobil Corp's 362,300 barrel per day (bpd) Beaumont, Texas refinery, sources familiar with plant operations said on Monday.

An Exxon spokeswoman said the refinery was producing fuel, but operating at reduced production levels.

All other major production units have restarted, the sources said. The refinery had been shut Aug. 30 due to flooding from Tropical Storm Harvey.

The 45,000 bpd coker is expected to be the last unit to return to full production at the Beaumont refinery because two of its eight drums are clogged with petroleum coke sludge, sources told Reuters last week. [nL2N1M31Z4]

Exxon aims to curb methane emissions from shale division - Reuters News

{{20170925T152741.144+0000}}Exxon aims to curb methane emissions from shale divisionHOUSTON, Sept 25 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp said on Monday it would launch a program to curb its methane emissions from its U.S. shale facilities by replacing aging equipment and updating dated technology, part of a plan by the company to reduce its environmental footprint.

The program comes as Exxon, the world's largest publicly traded oil producer, fights accusations by environmentalists and others that it misled investors and the public for years about the risks of climate change from fossil fuels.

Exxon declined to outline the cost of the three-year program or the savings it projects by keeping methane from venting. Methane is a component of natural gas and can be sold.

"We do believe this will have a meaningful impact on our methane-emissions reductions," said Sara Ortwein, president of XTO Energy, Exxon's shale-focused subsidiary. "We remain committed to minimizing our environmental impact from our operations."

As part of the three-year program, Exxon will replace outdated natural gas-powered pneumatic pumps, which chronically leak methane into the atmosphere, with compressed air-powered pumps. Such pumps can regulate pressure, temperature and other variables in oilfield equipment.

The company will also boost employee training on methane emissions reduction and begin to study how satellites, drones and other equipment can better be used to detect leaks.

Exxon said it has worked with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration on using drones for methane detection flights.

The program has received praise from some environmental groups, who said Exxon is taking a step to curbing greenhouse gas emissions.

"It sounds like a very robust program," said Matt Watson of the Environmental Defense Fund. "We're eager to get more details."

{{20170924T084749.204+0000}}RPT-FACTBOX-Iraq's Kurds to vote in historic referendum on independence(Repeats SEPT 22 story, no change to text)

By Raya Jalabi and Dmitry Zhdannikov

ERBIL/LONDON, Iraq Sept 22 (Reuters) - About five million people in Kurdish-held areas of northern Iraq will be summoned to take part in a non-binding referendum on independence from Iraq on Monday. [nL5N1M24DX]

They will be asked to tick a yes/no box next to this question: "Do you want the Kurdistan region and the Kurdish areas outside the region's administration to become an independent state?"

HISTORY:

The Kurds are the largest ethnic group left stateless when Britain and France, the colonial powers which won World War One, carved up the Ottoman empire. The region's roughly 30 million ethnic Kurds were left scattered, mainly over four countries: Iraq, Iran, Turkey and Syria. All of them suffered persecution and were often denied the right to speak their language. Those in Iraq were uprooted under Saddam Hussein's regime and suffered an attack using chemical weapons.

WHY THE REFERENDUM?

The autonomous Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) in northern Iraq says the Shi'ite ruled central government in Baghdad has failed to respect autonomy established after the 2003 overthrow of Saddam Hussein in a U.S.-led invasion.

WHY NOW?

The KRG says the vote acknowledges the Kurds' crucial contribution confronting Islamic State after it overwhelmed the the Iraqi army in 2014 amd seized control of a third of Iraq.

WHAT'S THE LIKELY OUTCOME AND WHAT'S THE NEXT MOVE:

The outcome is likely to be a comfortable "yes". The KRG, led by Massoud Barzani, plans to use the vote as a legitimate mandate to press for negotiations with Baghdad and neighboring countries to achieve independence.

WHY IS THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT OPPOSED TO THE VOTE? Baghdad thinks the vote could lead to a messy breakup of Iraq at a time when it is struggling with reconstruction and the return of refugees. It offers talks to resolve disputes over land, energy and power sharing, including the status of the multi-ethnic oil region of Kirkuk.

WHY ARE TURKEY AND IRAN OPPOSED TO THE REFERENDUM?

Iraq's powerful neighbours fear separatist contagion for their own Kurdish populations. Turkey is home to the largest Kurdish minority. It has been fighting Kurdish insurrection in its south-east since 1984. Iran's Kurds are close culturally to Iraq's Kurds and they speak the same Kurdish language. Tehran is also close to the Shi'ite political parties who have been ruling Iraq or holding key security or government positions since 2003.

Syria is embroiled in a civil war in which its own Kurds are pressing for self-administration.

WHO ELSE OPPOSES IT?

About everyone, including the United States and United Nations who fear a destabilization of Iraq while the war with Islamic State is not yet over.

WHY OIL-RICH KIRKUK IS EMERGING AS A FLASHPOINT:

Kirkuk is a multi-ethnic city. It lies outside the recognised Kurdish region and is home to Kurds, Turkmen, Arabs and Assyrian Christians. It sits on susbtantial oil reserves and its crude is exported through a pipeline to the Mediterranean that crosses KRG territory and Turkey. If Turkey decides to close the pipeline, it would deprive the KRG government in Erbil of most its hard currency income.

THE KURDISH REGION'S IMPORTANCE TO OIL MARKETS:

Iraqi Kurdistan produces around 650,000 bpd of crude from its fields, including around 150,000 bpd from the disputed areas of Kirkuk. The region's production volumes represent 15 percent of total Iraqi output and around 0.7 percent of global oil production. The KRG aspires to raise production to over 1 million bpd by the end of this decade.

THE KURDISH REGION'S IMPORTANCE TO OIL COMPANIES:

Kurdish oil production has been dominated by mid-sized oil firms such as Genel , DNO , Gulf Keystone and Dana Gas . Major oil firms such as Chevron , Exxon Mobil and Rosneft also have projects in Kurdistan but they are mostly at an exploration stage.[nL5N1M057T] Russia's state oil major Rosneft, however, has lent over $1 billion to the KRG guaranteed by oil sales and committed a total of $4 billion to various projects in Kurdistan.[nL5N1M13JA] Trading houses Vitol, Glencore , Trafigura and Petraco have lent a total of $2 billion to Kurdistan guaranteed by oil sales while Turkey has also provided a total of $1.5 billion to support Erbil in the past two years.

WHO CAN VOTE AND WHERE?

All registered residents of the Kurdish-held region in northern Iraq, Kurds and non-Kurds, are eligible to vote. The Kurdish-held regions include those inside the official boundaries of the KRG and surrounding areas that Peshmerga fighters seized in the course of the war on Islamic State. Kirkuk lies outside the KRG and is also claimed by Baghdad.

Internally displaced people from the disputed territories will be allowed to vote. Iraq's Kurdish diaspora will also be allowed to submit electronic ballots on Sept. 23 and 24.

INTERNATIONAL MONITORS:

The United Nations opposes the referendum and says it will not participate in the process.

UPDATE 1-Exxon's Beaumont, Texas refinery coker to run at reduced rates -sources - 路透新闻

{{20170922T212821.078+0000}}UPDATE 1-Exxon's Beaumont, Texas refinery coker to run at reduced rates -sources(Adds details)

HOUSTON, Sept 22 (Reuters) - The delayed coking unit at Exxon Mobil Corp's 362,300 barrel per day (bpd) Beaumont, Texas, refinery will at best run at reduced production levels for up to a month, sources familiar with plant operations said on Friday.

An Exxon spokeswoman said partial production has been restored at the refinery, which was shut on Aug. 30 by heavy rainfall from Hurricane Harvey.

Two drums of the eight-drum, 45,000 bpd coker are filled with petroleum coke sludge and need to be cleaned before they can resume output, the sources said.

Most production units at the refinery are expected to reach their best possible capacity by early next week, the sources said.

Floodwaters from Harvey's intense, heavy rain disrupted steam supply to the two coker drums causing them to fill with a petroleum coke sludge, the sources added.

Some lines going to the coker also were plugged by the sludge, according to the sources.

Cokers convert residual crude into motor fuel feedstocks or petroleum coke, which can be used as a coal substitute.

To make petroleum coke, residual crude is spun at high speed under high temperature in long drums. The crude hardens into coke on the walls of the drums, which are pulled out at 12- or 24-hour intervals. Then the coke is cut away from the drums by high-pressure, high-temperature water jets.

The flood waters disrupted the process leading to the sludge, the sources said.

The residual crude comes from the crude distillation units, so if the coker is at reduced output, production on one or both of the Beaumont refinery's crude units will likely be reduced.

KazMunaiGas Kashagan gets $0.6 billion advance from Vitol - Reuters News

{{20170922T133419.634+0000}}KazMunaiGas Kashagan gets $0.6 billion advance from VitolBy Alla Afanasyeva

MOSCOW, Sept 22 (Reuters) - KazMunaiGas Kashagan (KMGK), a subsidiary of Kazakhstan's state oil company KazMunaiGas, has extended a deal with international trader Vitol on pre-export financing of oil supplies from the Kashagan field with an additional prepayment of $600 million, the subsidiary's press-service reported

KMGK is using the funds to pay for its 8.48 percent stake in Kashagan, which it acquired in 2008.

KazMunaiGas (KMG) increased its share in the Kashagan project in 2008 by 8.48 percent to 16.81 percent after equity participation of other consortium shareholders decreased in exchange for the government's permission to extend the budget and project time frame.

"KMGK received an additional prepayment on August 10, 2017 for the amount of $600 mln and made early repayment of the second instalment … for a total sum of $804.4 mln," KMGK said on its website. KMGK didn't disclose how much oil Vitol will receive for the prepayment.

Vitol won a tender in 2016 for the right to make prepayment for KMGK's share in oil supplies from the Kashagan oil field worth $1 billion over five years. [nL8N1AX26D]

KMGK said at the time that "the volume of oil supplies from Kashagan to Vitol will depend on global oil prices."

Kashagan oil field is operated by North Caspian Operating Company (NCOC), made up of Italy's Eni , US Exxon Mobil , China's CNPC [CNPC.UL], Anglo-Dutch Royal Dutch Shell , France's Total , Japan's Inpex Holdings Inc <1605.T> and Kazakhstan's KazMunaiGas .

FACTBOX-Iraq's Kurds to vote in historic referendum on independence - Reuters News

{{20170922T132207.458+0000}}FACTBOX-Iraq's Kurds to vote in historic referendum on independenceBy Raya Jalabi and Dmitry Zhdannikov

ERBIL/LONDON, Iraq Sept 22 (Reuters) - About five million people in Kurdish-held areas of northern Iraq will be summoned to take part in a non-binding referendum on independence from Iraq on Monday. [nL5N1M24DX]

They will be asked to tick a yes/no box next to this question: "Do you want the Kurdistan region and the Kurdish areas outside the region's administration to become an independent state?"

HISTORY:

The Kurds are the largest ethnic group left stateless when Britain and France, the colonial powers which won World War One, carved up the Ottoman empire. The region's roughly 30 million ethnic Kurds were left scattered, mainly over four countries: Iraq, Iran, Turkey and Syria. All of them suffered persecution and were often denied the right to speak their language. Those in Iraq were uprooted under Saddam Hussein's regime and suffered an attack using chemical weapons.

WHY THE REFERENDUM?

The autonomous Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) in northern Iraq says the Shi'ite ruled central government in Baghdad has failed to respect autonomy established after the 2003 overthrow of Saddam Hussein in a U.S.-led invasion.

WHY NOW?

The KRG says the vote acknowledges the Kurds' crucial contribution confronting Islamic State after it overwhelmed the the Iraqi army in 2014 amd seized control of a third of Iraq.

WHAT'S THE LIKELY OUTCOME AND WHAT'S THE NEXT MOVE:

The outcome is likely to be a comfortable "yes". The KRG, led by Massoud Barzani, plans to use the vote as a legitimate mandate to press for negotiations with Baghdad and neighboring countries to achieve independence.

WHY IS THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT OPPOSED TO THE VOTE? Baghdad thinks the vote could lead to a messy breakup of Iraq at a time when it is struggling with reconstruction and the return of refugees. It offers talks to resolve disputes over land, energy and power sharing, including the status of the multi-ethnic oil region of Kirkuk.

WHY ARE TURKEY AND IRAN OPPOSED TO THE REFERENDUM?

Iraq's powerful neighbours fear separatist contagion for their own Kurdish populations. Turkey is home to the largest Kurdish minority. It has been fighting Kurdish insurrection in its south-east since 1984. Iran's Kurds are close culturally to Iraq's Kurds and they speak the same Kurdish language. Tehran is also close to the Shi'ite political parties who have been ruling Iraq or holding key security or government positions since 2003.

Syria is embroiled in a civil war in which its own Kurds are pressing for self-administration.

WHO ELSE OPPOSES IT?

About everyone, including the United States and United Nations who fear a destabilization of Iraq while the war with Islamic State is not yet over.

WHY OIL-RICH KIRKUK IS EMERGING AS A FLASHPOINT:

Kirkuk is a multi-ethnic city. It lies outside the recognised Kurdish region and is home to Kurds, Turkmen, Arabs and Assyrian Christians. It sits on susbtantial oil reserves and its crude is exported through a pipeline to the Mediterranean that crosses KRG territory and Turkey. If Turkey decides to close the pipeline, it would deprive the KRG government in Erbil of most its hard currency income.

THE KURDISH REGION'S IMPORTANCE TO OIL MARKETS:

Iraqi Kurdistan produces around 650,000 bpd of crude from its fields, including around 150,000 bpd from the disputed areas of Kirkuk. The region's production volumes represent 15 percent of total Iraqi output and around 0.7 percent of global oil production. The KRG aspires to raise production to over 1 million bpd by the end of this decade.

THE KURDISH REGION'S IMPORTANCE TO OIL COMPANIES:

Kurdish oil production has been dominated by mid-sized oil firms such as Genel , DNO , Gulf Keystone and Dana Gas . Major oil firms such as Chevron , Exxon Mobil and Rosneft also have projects in Kurdistan but they are mostly at an exploration stage.[nL5N1M057T] Russia's state oil major Rosneft, however, has lent over $1 billion to the KRG guaranteed by oil sales and committed a total of $4 billion to various projects in Kurdistan.[nL5N1M13JA] Trading houses Vitol, Glencore , Trafigura and Petraco have lent a total of $2 billion to Kurdistan guaranteed by oil sales while Turkey has also provided a total of $1.5 billion to support Erbil in the past two years.

WHO CAN VOTE AND WHERE?

All registered residents of the Kurdish-held region in northern Iraq, Kurds and non-Kurds, are eligible to vote. The Kurdish-held regions include those inside the official boundaries of the KRG and surrounding areas that Peshmerga fighters seized in the course of the war on Islamic State. Kirkuk lies outside the KRG and is also claimed by Baghdad.

Internally displaced people from the disputed territories will be allowed to vote. Iraq's Kurdish diaspora will also be allowed to submit electronic ballots on Sept. 23 and 24.

INTERNATIONAL MONITORS:

The United Nations opposes the referendum and says it will not participate in the process.

Kazakhstan cuts Kashagan Q4 output forecast to 270,000 bpd - Reuters News

{{20170922T071326.568+0000}}Kazakhstan cuts Kashagan Q4 output forecast to 270,000 bpdMOSCOW, Sept 22 (Reuters) - Kazakhstan's giant Kashagan oil field will produce 270,000 barrels per day in the last quarter of this year, a unit of Kazakh national oil firm told Reuters.

The forecast is lower than that given this month by Energy Minister Kanat Bozumbayev, who said the field would increase production to 300,000-370,000 bpd by the end of this year from the current 200,000 bpd.

BUZZ-FuelCell Energy: Sees potential in carbon capture program - Reuters News

{{20170921T163622.950+0000}}BUZZ-FuelCell Energy: Sees potential in carbon capture program** Shares of FuelCell Energy Inc rise as much as 8.5 pct to a 2-month high of $1.79 after firm highlights its carbon capture potential at Cowen & Co summit on Wednesday

** FCEL says it is "upbeat" about its short-term progress, while highlighting the opportunity for carbon capture and storage in its programs with world's largest listed oil company Exxon Mobil

** In the past few months, fuel cell makers such as FCEL, Hydrogenics Corp and Plug Power have seen their stocks rise on the back of major deals - PLUG up ~128 pct YTD, HYGS up ~109 pct

** Cowen & Co analysts also see a "compelling opportunity" for FCEL's carbonate-based fuel cells, known for being less energy intensive than conventional tech

** Carbon capture, used to capture and store carbon-dioxide from coal emissions, has gained interest lately with President Trump's support for "beautiful clean coal" and a crucial regulatory hearing on Friday, concerning solar companies, which could put the emphasis back on coal

** Despite falling investments and environmental roadblocks, coal still represents ~30 pct of U.S. power generation mix

** Including today's gains, FCEL's stock has risen ~44 pct in the last 3 months

UPDATE 2-California cities sue big oil firms over climate change - Reuters News

{{20170920T222052.131+0000}}UPDATE 2-California cities sue big oil firms over climate change(Adds company and Union of Concerned Scientists comments beginning in paragraph five)

Sept 20 (Reuters) - California cities San Francisco and Oakland filed separate lawsuits against five oil companies on Wednesday seeking billions of dollars to protect against rising sea levels they blamed on climate change, according to public documents.

The lawsuits, filed in state courts in San Francisco and Alameda Counties, alleged Chevron Corp , ConocoPhillips , Exxon Mobil Corp , BP Plc , and Royal Dutch Shell Plc , created a public nuisance and asked for funds to finance infrastructure to deal with rising sea levels.

According to a news release from San Francisco city officials, the lawsuits mirror 1980s-era lawsuits against tobacco companies. They allege the oil giants "knowingly and recklessly created an ongoing public nuisance that is causing harm now and in the future risks catastrophic harm to human life and property."

"Should this litigation proceed, it will only serve special interests at the expense of broader policy, regulatory, and economic priorities," said Chevron spokeswoman Melissa Ritchie.

Shell said in statement the issue should be addressed by government policy and cultural change, not by courts.

Exxon called the lawsuits' claims without merit, and said it would defend itself. ConocoPhillips declined to comment. BP did not respond to a request for comment.

"Congress and the Trump administration are AWOL on climate change," said Ken Kimmell, president of the Union of Concerned Scientists, saying the courts were the appropriate venue to address rising sea levels and other climate impacts.

The lawsuits are the latest in a growing body of legal action against oil companies over climate change. Prosecutors for New York and Massachusetts are investigating Exxon, for example, over the possibility it misled investors in public statements on the risks of climate change. [nL1N1J61IZ]

Marin and San Mateo counties and Imperial Beach, California, in July brought similar public nuisance and failure to warn lawsuits alleging climate change impacts. Those three lawsuits sued the same five plus other oil companies and coal producers.

The cases are People of the State of California V. BP et al., San Francisco Superior Court Case No. CGC 17-561370, and People of the State of California V. BP et al., Alameda County Superior Court Case No. RG17875889.

Chevron drills oil well in Iraqi Kurdish area after two-year gap - sources - Reuters News

* Drilling is first in region since late 2015

* Region tense before planned independence vote

By Ron Bousso and Dmitry Zhdannikov

LONDON, Sept 20 (Reuters) - U.S. firm Chevron drilled its first exploration well this month in Iraqi Kurdistan after a two-year break, industry sources said, signalling its confidence in the area despite an international row over region's independence referendum plan.

Chevron, the second largest U.S. oil and gas company, drilled the well in Sarta block, north of the regional capital Erbil, the first such well since the second half of 2015, two industry sources told Reuters.

"Chevron continues its exploration activities in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq," a Chevron spokeswoman said, without elaborating.

Chevron holds an 80 percent interest in the Sarta and Qara Dagh blocks, which cover a combined area of 279,000 acres (1,129 sq km), according to its 2016 annual report. It does not currently have any production from Iraqi Kurdistan.

Chevron started drilling its previous exploration in Sarta in late 2015 and completed it in early 2016.

It relinquished its Rovi block at the end of 2015.

The California-based firm's operations in the region temporarily ground to a halt in 2014 after a conflict between Kurdish forces and Islamic State. Activity again came to a halt after the first Sarta well was drilled.

The region's attraction for oil companies was dented after a string of reserve downgrades last year. But the sources said Chevron still considered a focus for growth in the future, the sources said.

Despite a conflict in other areas of Iraq that damaged the energy industry, oil and gas production in the Kurdish territory was mostly unaffected.

But tensions in the area have mounted before a referendum on independence the regional government plans to hold on Sept. 25, which had drawn criticism from Baghdad, regional nations and Western powers.

Exxon Mobil , the world's largest listed oil and gas company, pulled out of half of the six exploration blocks it operated in the Kurdistan region late last year.

By Dmitry Zhdannikov

LONDON, Sept 20 (Reuters) - Russia, the only major power that has not called on Iraq's Kurds to cancel a referendum on independence next week, has swiftly become the top funder of Kurdish oil and gas deals, with as much as $4 billion pledged in less than a year, industry sources say.

Washington, European countries, Turkey and Iran have all lined up to oppose a move by Iraq's Kurds to hold a Sept. 25 independence referendum, which the Kurds consider the culmination of decades of struggle for a state of their own, but Iraq calls a violation of its constitution.

This week, the White House issued a statement calling the planned vote "provocative and destabilising", noting that it will take place not only within the autonomous Kurdish region itself but on territory that is disputed.

But Moscow has issued no such call to cancel the vote.

Instead, with the planned referendum just days away, Russian state oil giant Rosneft announced its latest investment last week, to help Iraqi Kurdistan develop its natural gas industry, for domestic supplies and eventual export.

The full value of the deal has not been disclosed officially, but according to industry sources familiar with it, it is worth more than $1 billion.

It is Rosneft's third giant venture in the Kurdish region since February, transforming Moscow from an outsider with little profile in Kurdistan into the region's biggest source of cash.

According to the industry sources, Rosneft's deals since it first arrived in Kurdistan last December are worth around $4 billion in total. That exceeds the $2 billion in financing the Kurdish region has previously received for oil sales from international trading firms that pre-pay for its exports, and $1.5 billion it has received from neighbour Turkey.

It also marks a big change in focus for the Iraqi Kurds, who have had close ties with Washington since 1991 when the United States offered them protection from Saddam Hussein, the dictator later toppled by U.S. forces in 2003.

"Moscow has been effectively filling the gap as the United States has been pulling back from Iraq," said a senior source in Erbil, capital of the Iraqi Kurdish region.

Publicly, Moscow says it supports Iraq's territorial integrity while also recognising the aspirations of the Kurds for a homeland. The 35 million Kurds are spread over Iraq, Iran, Turkey and Syria.

"We are interested that the Kurdish people like any other nation on the planet can fulfil its hopes and aspirations," Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said in July. "We start from the fact that the legitimate aspirations of the Kurds, like other peoples, need to be fulfilled within the framework of existing international legal norms."

But unlike other powers, Moscow has avoided giving a verdict on the legality or wisdom of holding the referendum itself. The Foreign Ministry in Moscow said it had nothing to add to Lavrov's comments on the matter from July.

"The Russian position is: 'Let's wait and see the outcome of the referendum,'" said Hoshiyar Zebari, one of Iraq's pre-eminent Kurdish politicians, who served as foreign minister, deputy prime minister and finance minister in Baghdad from 2003 until last year and now advises Kurdistan's regional government.

"They seem to understand our situation," Zebari told Reuters, adding that Moscow expected the Kurds would use the outcome of the referendum as part of a process of negotiation with Baghdad.

According to a diplomatic source, the Kurds took notice in June when Lavrov signalled to a Kurdish delegation at a meeting in St Petersburg that Russia would not oppose the referendum.

"During previous meetings, Lavrov always focused on Iraq's territorial integrity," said the source, who was present at the meeting on the sidelines of Russia's economic forum in St Petersburg.

"This time, he said that Russia understands the ambitions of Kurdish people for independence. And even though he added that it needed to be done carefully, it was a big signal."

At around the same time as that meeting took place, Rosneft was signing its second of this year's three major oil investment deals with Kurdish officials. Days later, the Kurds announced the date of their referendum.

LOOKING FOR FRIENDS

The Russians are not the first foreigners to come to Kurdistan looking for oil.

The Kurds have long argued that as an autonomous region of Iraq they have the authority to make agreements with foreign companies about pumping the oil on their territory. Iraq's central government, meanwhile, says any deals to export oil from Kurdistan are illegal without Baghdad's blessing.

For several years, American companies were at the forefront of negotiating deals with the Kurds, on the assumption that Baghdad would eventually authorise them. The highest-profile deal was announced by Exxon Mobil, then under the leadership of CEO Rex Tillerson, now U.S. Secretary of State.

But after signing a landmark deal to develop Kurdish oil fields in 2011, Exxon did little exploration, and has since handed some of the blocs back to the Kurdish government.

While Washington remains friendly with the Kurds and sees them as a bulwark against Islamic State, it is concerned about their independence bid leading to the breakup of Iraq or a rupture with Turkey. The United States has long encouraged the Kurds to avoid unilateral steps, such as the referendum, that might destabilise the Baghdad government or antagonise Ankara.

Russia, meanwhile, is looking for more friends in the Middle East after returning in force to the region with a decisive military intervention in Syria. Its main regional allies are Iran and the Syria of President Bashar al-Assad, and having friends in Kurdish territory, located between Syria, Iran and Turkey, would be geopolitically useful.

DEAL AFTER DEAL

Kurdistan has estimated recoverable reserves at 45 billion barrels of oil and 5.66 trillion cubic metres of gas, which could rise further with exploration.

For Rosneft, run by Igor Sechin, a close ally of President Vladimir Putin, it potentially offers a cheap source of crude supplies to refineries in Europe, and a big boost to Rosneft's gas ambitions.

In 2014, Erbil started oil sales via a pipeline through Turkey. It has generally conducted those deals with pre-financing, obtaining money in advance from international trading firms and Turkey before the oil is delivered.

Rosneft began its involvement with a small pre-finance deal at the end of last year along the lines of deals the Kurds had previously reached with global traders. The Russian firm loaned the Kurds around $280 million, guaranteed by future oil sales, according to industry sources.

In February 2017, Rosneft ramped up its cooperation by agreeing to lend the semi-autonomous region $1.2 billion, becoming the first big foreign oil company to publicly commit to pre-financing Kurdish exports.

Kurdistan's minister of natural resources Ashti Hawrami called the deal a ground-breaker for the region that would help its economic independence - a crucial condition for seeking political independence. [nL5N1GD71Z]

By that point, Turkey had invested some $1.5 billion and international trading houses such as Vitol, Petraco, Trafigura and Glencore had collectively loaned the Kurds some $2 billion.

Russia became the Kurds' single biggest financer with its next deal in June this year to lend money and help search for more oil, bringing its total investments close to $2.8 billion. [nL8N1IZ36G]

This week's Russian pledge to invest more than $1 billion in Kurdistan's gas infrastructure could help the region become a major gas exporter to Turkey and Europe one day, Rosneft says. The independence referendum won't be a problem.

"Holding the referendum will not affect our work. We are doing business in an autonomous region in Iraq that has been recognised by law," Rosneft spokesman Mikhail Leontev said this week. "This place is run by Iraqi Kurdistan's nation and it is the people of Iraqi Kurdistan who live there. That is why we don't think we are embarking on an adventure."

LNG growth to propel oil and gas industry's carbon emissions -WoodMac - Reuters News

{{20170920T060001.259+0000}}LNG growth to propel oil and gas industry's carbon emissions -WoodMac* Carbon emissions for top 25 companies to grow by 17pct by 2025

* LNG to be biggest driver of emissions growth, study says

* Around $45bln of projects at risk of not going ahead

* GRAPHIC: emissions growth (http://reut.rs/2xNXLcB)

By Ron Bousso

LONDON, Sept 20 (Reuters) - Liquefied natural gas will be the biggest source of carbon emission growth for the world's top oil and gas companies by 2025, according to a new study by Wood Mackenzie, as demand for the super-chilled fuel is set to rise sharply.

Oil and gas companies such as Exxon Mobil , Royal Dutch Shell and Total have promoted natural gas as a cleaner fossil fuel that will displace coal to meet growing demand for energy as the world shifts away from fossil fuels in the coming decades.

But converting natural gas into LNG by cooling it to minus 160 degrees Celsius in order to transport it to demand centres is a highly energy-intensive and therefore emission-intensive process, according to WoodMac analyst Amy Bowe.

Capping emissions of heat-trapping gases by the oil and gas industry has moved to the forefront of investors' agendas in the wake of the 2015 Paris climate agreement to limit global warming to below 2 degrees Celsius by the end of the century.

Companies are coming under growing pressure to tackle emissions from flaring excess gas at oil fields as well as limiting the emissions of methane, a highly potent greenhouse gas, from pipelines and LNG terminals.

The Edinburgh oil and gas industry consultancy said in a study that emissions from oil and gas production operations of 25 of the world's top energy companies are nevertheless expected to rise by 17 percent by 2025.

Fossil fuel output will increase by 15 percent over the same period.

Emissions resulting from LNG production are forecast to grow by 43 percent over the period compared with a 22 percent increase in supply, "representing the largest absolute increase in emissions," according to the report.

Around 10 percent of gas processed by an LNG terminal is lost into the atmosphere, Bowe said in an interview.

"If you look at the emissions produced just through the extraction and production of it, LNG is more emissions-intensive than pipeline gas and that is largely due to the liquefaction process," Bowe told Reuters.

Global demand for LNG could increase from around 240 million tonnes per year to around 430 million tonnes by 2025, according to Shell, the world's largest LNG trader.

However, despite its large contribution to carbon emissions, LNG remains the least polluting fossil fuel when taking into account the full chain of production, delivery and consumption, primarily for producing electricity, Bowe said.

"If we were to look full-cycle at the emissions produced through the consumption of fuels, we would expect LNG to still be more favourable," Bowe said.

"Compared to coal, LNG is still much more favourable on a full-cycle basis."

The growth in emissions is also driven by a wave of investments in heavy oil projects such as Canada's oil sands, according to the study.

WoodMac also estimated that around $45 billion of oil and gas projects representing some 2.3 percent of fossil fuel reserves of firms surveyed are at risk of not getting the green light by 2025 because of their high carbon emissions.

The number, based on a tax of $40 per tonne of carbon, represents a fraction of other estimates of so-called "stranded" fossil fuel assets. [nL8N1JI1P9]

Conventional onshore oil and gas fields will remain the largest single source of production and emissions by 2025, although their share of the total will diminish as fields age, according to the study.

Azeri parliament to ratify new deal with BP-led consortium in 2017 - Reuters News

{{20170919T124651.114+0000}}Azeri parliament to ratify new deal with BP-led consortium in 2017BAKU, Sept 19 (Reuters) - Azerbaijan's parliament is expected to ratify an oilfield development contract with a BP -led consortium before the end of 2017, the head of state oil group SOCAR said on Tuesday.

BP and Azerbaijan agreed last week to extend to 2050 the contract to develop the country's biggest oilfields - Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli (ACG), a deal dubbed "the contract of the century" when first signed in 1994 until 2024. [nL5N1LV1VK]

The new contract secures large investment in Azerbaijan's oil sector over decades and a one-off bonus of $3.6 billion for the government, a welcome boost for a country that has struggled with a sharp drop in oil prices in the past three years.

"The new contract is expected to be submitted to the parliament before the end of 2017, coming into force after ratification," Rovnag Abdullayev, president of state-owned energy company SOCAR, told Reuters.

He said the main goal of the new contract was to spur interest among SOCAR's foreign partners in new long-term investments and to secure sustainable exploration of the oilfields.

"Today our financial and technological resources are much more advanced than back in the 1990s, when the first "contract of the century" was negotiated," Abdullayev said.

"That allows Azerbaijan to act independently, having an effect on the final outcome of all negotiations."

Abdullayev said that according to the new contract Azerbaijan's direct share in profitable oil amounted to 75 percent and the ratio was not subject to any variations from the start until the end of the contract, thus contributing to stability of the national income.

Under the new production sharing agreement, SOCAR will increase its share to 25 percent from 11.65 percent, while BP's stake declines to 30.37 percent from 35.8 percent. BP will remain the operator.

Stakes of other firms in the BP-led consortium have also been reduced. Chevron now has 9.57 percent, Inpex <1605.T> 9.31 percent, Statoil 7.27 percent, ExxonMobil 6.79 percent, TPAO 5.73 percent, Itochu <8001.T> 3.65 percent and ONGC Videsh 2.31 percent.

The ACG fields produce 585,000 barrels per day, accounting for three quarters of the Azerbaijan's oil output, but production is expected to rise as the partners could invest up to $40 billion in the next 32 years.

BP befürchtet Absatzrückgang bei E-Auto-Boom - Reuters (German)

{{20170918T132255.989+0000}}BP befürchtet Absatzrückgang bei E-Auto-BoomDüsseldorf, 18. Sep (Reuters) - Die Mineralölkonzerne erwarten bei einem kräftigen Zuwachs von E-Autos einen deutlichen Rückgang ihres Kraftstoffabsatzes. "Sollte es zwischen den Jahren 2030 und 2040 tatsächlich fünf bis zehn Millionen E-Autos auf deutschen Straßen geben, würde das den Absatz von Benzin und Diesel im Individualverkehr um zehn bis 15 Prozent verringern", sagte der Chef der BP Europa SE, Wolfgang Langhoff, in einem am Montag vorab veröffentlichten Bericht der "Welt". Diesen Rückgang müsse der Konzern dann in Teilen mit eigenen Geschäften aus der E-Mobilität und mit alternativen Kraftstoffen wettmachen. Zu BP gehört auch der Tankstellenbetreiber Aral, der nach eigenen Angaben in Deutschland Marktführer ist.

UPDATE 1-Exxon Beaumont refinery may restart most units this week – sources - 路透新闻

{{20170918T050408.766+0000}}UPDATE 1-Exxon Beaumont refinery may restart most units this week – sources(Adds details on restart, background about units)

HOUSTON, Sept 18 (Reuters) - ExxonMobil Corp may restart most of the production units at its 362,300 barrel per day (bpd) Beaumont refinery in Texas, by the end of this week, said sources familiar with plant operations on Sunday.

Exxon spokeswoman Charlotte Huffaker said restart activities were progressing at the Beaumont refinery, which was shut down on Aug. 30 after Hurricane Harvey slammed Texas.

The refinery's two crude distillation units restarted on Friday, sources told Reuters. The refinery has also restarted its 40,000 bpd diesel hydrotreater. [nL2N1LW16N]

Exxon restarted the 65,000 bpd hydrocracking unit on Sunday, said energy industry intelligence service Genscape.

The refinery's 45,000 bpd coking unit is expected to achieve full-production level by the last week of September.

Crude distillation units refine crude oil as it comes into the refinery and provide hydrocarbon feedstock for all other production units.

Hydrotreaters remove sulfur from motor fuels in compliance with U.S. environmental regulations.

Cokers convert residual crude into motor fuel feedstocks or petroleum coke, a coal substitute.

Brasil deve antecipar mistura de 10% de biodiesel no diesel para 2018, diz secretário - Reuters (Portuguese, Brazil)

{{20170915T221008.017+0000}}Brasil deve antecipar mistura de 10% de biodiesel no diesel para 2018, diz secretárioRIO DE JANEIRO, 15 Set (Reuters) - O governo brasileiro vai anunciar oficialmente até o fim deste ano a antecipação, para março do ano que vem, do aumento da mistura de biodiesel no diesel dos atuais 8 para 10 por cento, disse nesta sexta-feira o secretário de Petróleo e Gás do Ministério de Minas e Energia, Márcio Félix.

Segundo ele, a decisão de elevar a mistura já foi tomada pelo governo e falta agora uma resolução do Conselho Nacional de Política Energética (CNPE) para regulamentar a elevação.

"A decisão de aumentar está tomada, só falta formalizar... até dezembro, no máximo, sai", disse Félix a jornalistas após participar de um evento da FGV Energia.

A medida deve beneficiar especialmente a indústria de soja, que responde pela maior parte da matéria-prima utilizada para a fabricação de biodiesel no Brasil.[nL2N1LN10H]

O secretário afirmou que a próxima reunião do CNPE está marcada para dezembro, mas existe a possibilidade de haver um encontro extraordinário para tratar desse e de outros temas, como, por exemplo, a atualização do contrato da Cessão Onerosa com a Petrobras.

A ideia é que o anúncio sobre a mistura seja feito o mais rápido possível para que haja tempo de a indústria de fornecedores e, especialmente a automotiva, se preparar.

A perspectiva anterior era que o chamado B-10 entrasse em vigor em março de 2019, mas ele será antecipado em um ano.

Félix frisou que o aumento da mistura poderá reduzir as importações brasileira de diesel para atender o mercado interno e até baixar o preço do combustível aqui no Brasil.

"Estamos preparados para o aumento e tem a questão econômica também. O Brasil está importando diesel e pode produzir biodiesel..."

RENOVABIO

"Se a mistura de 10 por cento entrar com o programa Renovabio, vamos deixar de importar, e vamos recuperar capacidade ociosa das usinas, e o preço tende a ser menor do que é hoje do biodiesel e do diesel, por tabela", adicionou ele.

O programa para incentivar o setor de biocombustível, o Renovabio, está pronto para ser aprovado, e o governo estuda a melhor maneira de avançar com a proposta no Congresso Nacional.

A proposta inicial era implementar o Renovabio por Medida Provisória, mas como há muitas MPs tramitando no Congresso o caminho poderá ser lançar mão de um Projeto de Lei em regime de urgência para acelerar o processo, segundo o secretário.

Ele revelou ainda que o Brasil foi convidado para ingressar na Agência Internacional de Energia, e o acesso ao órgão está "em vias de acontecer".

LEILÕES

O secretário disse que está positivamente satisfeito com o interesse das empresas nos próximos leilões do pré-sal, marcados para outubro, e disse que o interesse de 17 empresas nos certames superou as expectativas.

Para ele, a manifestação do interesse por parte de grandes empresas mostra que o Brasil está no caminho certo.

Uma das grandes empresas interessas seria a estrangeira Exxon Mobil . "As demonstrações de interesse da Exxon no país, e espero que se concretizem, são uma sinalização de que estamos no caminho certo", disse ele.

UPDATE 1-Beaumont port still restricted after Harvey - Reuters News

{{20170915T210747.174+0000}}UPDATE 1-Beaumont port still restricted after Harvey(Adds detail on exports)

By Julia Simon

NEW YORK, Sept 15 (Reuters) - While crude deliveries by larger ships to Beaumont in Texas remain restricted after Hurricane Harvey, a workaround using pipelines can supply Exxon Mobil's refinery there, shipping sources said.

Beaumont's port has been closed to ship traffic over 26 feet (8 meters) since Sept. 9 by the U.S. Coast Guard, because of shoaling - sediment or sand that washes up on the bottom of the waterway and hampers shipping traffic. [nL2N1LQ0OO]

Exxon has other options for receiving crude, as nearby discharge points at Port Arthur and Nederland are still available, and pipes can bring crude up to the refinery. Exxon, however, tends to export refined products direct from the Beaumont port dock, said Brian Hass, operations manager for shipping broker Host Agency in Beaumont.

Exxon Mobil's facility can refine 362,000 barrels of crude a day. Brent Rahe, Coast Guard vessel traffic supervisor at Port Arthur, said there's a high spot in the river that could hinder vessels near the Beaumont port and Exxon Mobil's refinery.

Ships in that waterway are restricted to a 26-foot draft, the Coast Guard said, as opposed to the 40-foot (12-meter)allowance before the storm that allowed large ships that deliver crude into the channel. It is unclear when the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will be able to dredge the Beaumont waterway, Rahe said.

That could eventually cause difficulties for product exports, Hass said, once Beaumont is fully functioning again in the wake of Harvey. That refinery is still in the process of restarting, however.

The refinery expects to be back at full capacity by month-end, a spokeswoman said; the company did not answer questions about the ship channel. Since Harvey struck, overall imports into the Gulf Coast have slumped.

The Beaumont port is the furthest inland port on the Sabine Neches, a long curving waterway that empties into the Gulf of Mexico. The storm shut traffic at several ports, and while some, like Houston and Corpus Christi, have reopened to shipping traffic, they are still subject to restrictions on the depth of cargoes that can come up their respective channels.

Ships with a 38-foot (12-meter) draft - which can accommodate crude deliveries - are able to make their way to Sunoco's terminal, which has pipelines, that can deliver crude to Exxon Beaumont, said Hass.

Exxon Beaumont's facility imported 18.6 million barrels of oil in 2016, according to U.S. Energy Information Administration data.

UPDATE 2-Exxon restarting Beaumont, Texas refinery after Harvey - 路透新闻

{{20170915T210628.176+0000}}UPDATE 2-Exxon restarting Beaumont, Texas refinery after Harvey(New throughout, adds two CDUs restarted, new company statement, work on other units, background)

HOUSTON, Sept 15 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp was restarting its 362,300 barrel per day (bpd) Beaumont, Texas, refinery for the first time since shutting it nearly three weeks ago due to Tropical Storm Harvey, the company said.

"We can confirm that we are progressing restart activities at the Beaumont refinery, as a general practice, we don't comment on the status of particular units," said Exxon spokesman Aaron Stryk.

On Friday, Exxon restarted the refinery's two crude distillation units, which refine crude oil coming into the plant and provide hydrocarbon feedstock to all other units, said sources familiar with plant operations.

The 110,000 bpd Crude A CDU restarted in the morning and the 240,000 bpd CDU restarted later. Both CDUs were on circulation, meaning they were not making any products, but were at operating temperature and circulating oil.

Exxon was working to restart the 45,000 bpd coking unit, which will need to be online before the CDUs can boost production, the sources said.

Exxon was bringing up the 40,000 bpd diesel hydrotreater, which will remove sulfur from products produced by the CDUs, according to the sources. A 35,000 bpd jet fuel hydrotreater will need to have pumps replaced before it can restart.

The refinery's sulfur recovery units and effluent wastewater treatment plant were operating on Friday, the sources said.

Portions of the refinery were flooded on Aug. 30 by Tropical Storm Harvey forcing the refinery to shut down.

Cokers convert residual crude oil from distillation units to feedstock for motor fuels or petroleum coke, a coal substitute.

Beaumont port still restricted after Harvey - Reuters News

{{20170915T205255.453+0000}}Beaumont port still restricted after HarveyBy Julia Simon

NEW YORK, Sept 15 (Reuters) - While crude deliveries by larger ships to Beaumont in Texas remain restricted after Hurricane Harvey, a workaround using pipelines can supply Exxon Mobil's refinery there, shipping sources said.

Silt and clay lingering in the Port of Beaumont still threaten to entrap large ships, two weeks after Hurricane Harvey ravaged Texas, but pipelines are available to move crude up to refineries there from nearby terminals which are less affected by sediment.

Beaumont's port has been closed to ship traffic over 26 feet (8 meters) since Sept. 9 by the U.S. Coast Guard, because of shoaling - sediment or sand that washes up on the bottom of the waterway and hampers shipping traffic. [nL2N1LQ0OO]

The storm shut traffic at several ports, and while some, like Houston and Corpus Christi, have reopened to shipping traffic, they are still subject to restrictions on the depth of cargoes that can come up their respective channels.

The primary refinery in Beaumont is Exxon Mobil's facility, which can refine 362,000 barrels of crude a day. Brent Rahe, Coast Guard vessel traffic supervisor at Port Arthur, said there's a high spot that could hinder vessels near the Beaumont port and Exxon Mobil's refinery.

Ships in that waterway are restricted to a 26-foot draft, the Coast Guard said, as opposed to the 40-foot (12-meter)allowance before the storm that allowed large ships that deliver crude into the channel.

Since Harvey struck, overall imports into the Gulf Coast have slumped. Imports averaged 2.5 million barrels in the week prior to Harvey, and in the two weeks since have averaged 1.47 million and 1.77 million, respectively, EIA data shows.

Exxon Beaumont's facility imported 18.6 million barrels of oil in 2016, according to U.S. Energy Information Administration data. It shut after Harvey hit, but the refinery expects to be back at full capacity by month-end; the company did not answer questions about the ship channel.

REFILE-Pakistani investors aim for LNG import terminal in early 2019 - Reuters News

{{20170915T184717.423+0000}}REFILE-Pakistani investors aim for LNG import terminal in early 2019(Refiles to correct date)

* New LNG import terminal project, Energas, eyes Q1 2019 start

* Project backers want LNG to feed private power plants, industry

* K-Electric accepts bids to secure 15-year LNG supply deal

* Three pre-qualified bidders put forth offers

By Oleg Vukmanovic

LONDON, Sept 15 (Reuters) - Three Pakistani industrial groups plan to begin importing liquefied natural gas (LNG) through a private terminal due to be completed in early 2019, bringing the total number of potential LNG import projects in the country to eight.

Currently, Pakistan has only one active LNG import terminal at Port Qasim in Karachi but is seen by traders and suppliers as a major growth market key to soaking up a growing glut of the fuel on international markets.

Yunus Brothers Group, Sapphire Group and the private backers of Pakistan's Halmore Power Generation Co are co-funding the Energas terminal to supply their power plants, cement, auto and chemical factories, and textile mills with about 2.1 million tonnes of LNG per year.

The terminal at Port Qasim in Karachi will include a floating storage and regasification unit (FSRU), converting the LNG back into gas for feeding into Pakistan's pipeline grid.

"Energas is a buyers-only consortium, pooling demand together to secure long-term LNG supply on preferential terms," Energas Chief Executive Anser Khan said.

Two further power generating companies are in talks to join the consortium, which expects to cut the running costs of its power plant fleet by switching away from burning diesel to cheaper, less polluting gas.

"Energas is currently engaged in talks to secure a 15-year LNG supply deal," Khan said.

As electricity producers, Energas' three investors hold long-term power purchase agreements with the government, potentially making them attractive for LNG suppliers wary of emerging markets' heightened credit and non-payment risks.

Energas does not yet have government approvals.

K-ELECTRIC TENDER

A challenge facing some of Pakistan's proposed import projects is a lack of end-user demand needed to underpin investments in terminal infrastructure and LNG supply, industry sources said.

As a result, Karachi utility K-Electric's tender to secure 1 million tonnes of LNG annually for 15 years drew heavy interest from competing terminal developers hoping to lock-in a major customer. [nL8N1LM50Q]

Last Friday K-Electric took bids from only three pre-qualified import project developers seeking to supply the utility with LNG, according to two industry sources.

The Engro-led project - due to start in late 2018 - comprising Royal Dutch Shell , Fatima Group and trading house Gunvor submitted a bid.

As did Pakistan GasPort (PGP), which opens in November. Trader Trafigura [TRAFG.UL] has access to a share of that project's 750 million cubic feet/day of regasification capacity, but it also plans to open another terminal alongside it. [nL5N1LT28U]

The third K-Electric bidder was the Global Energy Infrastructure-led project - also set to start in late 2018 - made up of Exxon Mobil , Total , Mitsubishi <8058.T> and Qatar Petroleum [QATPE.UL], the sources said.

Securing a utility customer would help underpin at least two of the projects. PGP has already locked in most of its demand via deals to supply three state-owned power plants.

K-Electric expects to pick a winner in October although this could be delayed pending a government decision to approve its tariff, industry sources said.

Two more terminal projects have been proposed - one near Karachi and another in port city Gwadar.

BREAKINGVIEWS-Exxon's M&A machine faces Permian dilemma - Reuters Breakingviews

{{20170915T160535.679+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-Exxon's M&A machine faces Permian dilemma(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are her own.)

By Lauren Silva Laughlin

NEW YORK, Sept 15 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Exxon Mobil's acquisition machine faces a Permian dilemma. Buying a West Texas driller is the quickest way for the $337 billion oil giant to catch up with peers on replacing reserves. The trick for Chief Executive Darren Woods, though, will be to find a way to justify the expense.

Exxon was late to the Permian party. It does have some assets in the region – mostly those it bought earlier this year from the Bass family for $5.6 billion. Woods also has set aside $22 billion to spend globally on boosting reserves and production from current low levels.

The company has been chipping away at its reserves by an average of 11 percent a year for the past three years, according to Citigroup. Royal Dutch Shell , Chevron and BP , meanwhile, have been building them. Exxon's oil-equivalent production is also falling, by 1 percent in the second quarter, or 35,000 barrels a day.

Siphoning, say, Parsley Energy or Diamondback Energy into its tanks would resolve Exxon's problems immediately, adding some 70,000 barrels a day to its output. The two Permian specialists have also fallen in value over the past year thanks in part to the oil-price drop. Parsley has dropped by around a third to just shy of $8 billion, while Diamondback plummeted 35 percent to around $9 billion.

That pegs the enterprise value for both at around nine times estimated EBITDA for the next 12 months, according to Thomson Reuters data. That's roughly the multiple sported by larger players, too - $17 billion Concho Resources and $22 billion Pioneer Natural Resources , which produce 184,700 and 259,000 barrels a day respectively.

Trouble is, that's also where Exxon trades. Granted, it's better than its nearest rival, Chevron, which only commands a roughly seven-times multiple. But it means Woods would need to cut a lot of costs for any Permian deal to stack up financially – some $360 million worth, if he paid a 30 percent premium for Diamondback.

At some 60 percent of the mooted target's costs, it's a real stretch. Noble Energy could only lop off around a third of Clayton Williams Energy's expenses in its deal earlier this year. Exxon would, of course, gain immediate access to any seller's know-how; transferring that to its Bass assets could soften the financial blow. But Woods may need a stronger argument for Permian expansion.

CONTEXT NEWS

- Valuations of stocks with assets primarily in the Permian have fallen over the last year. Pioneer Natural Resources' enterprise value is just under nine times its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization compared with around 15 times last year, according to Thomson Reuters data. Parsley Energy's value has fallen by roughly a third.

- Over the same period, Exxon Mobil's valuation has held steady at roughly nine times EBITDA while its direct competitors' multiples have fallen. Chevron, for example, trades at roughly seven times EBITDA.

- Exxon production fell by 1 percent to 3.9 million barrels a day in the second quarter, the company said on July 28. On the same day, Chevron said its overall production rose by 250,000 barrels a day, equivalent to a 10 percent increase over the quarter, thanks in large part to a one-third jump in Permian output.

- Last year Exxon replaced only 65 percent of its reserves, whereas Chevron and ConocoPhillips replaced 95 percent and 78 percent, respectively. Shell nearly doubled its reserves.

- In January, Exxon paid $5.6 billion to acquire 250,000 acres of land from the Bass family of Fort Worth, Texas. On March 1, Exxon said that it plans to spend $22 billion in capital and exploration in 2017, including in short-term drilling projects in North Dakota and Texas.

FACTBOX-Effect of hurricanes Harvey and Irma on key U.S. companies - Reuters News

{{20170915T075846.484+0000}}FACTBOX-Effect of hurricanes Harvey and Irma on key U.S. companiesSept 14 (Reuters) - Hurricane Harvey, which tore through Corpus Christi in southern Texas on
Aug. 25 and drenched the Houston area with historic rains, killed over 60 people and displaced
more than 1 million people.

The impact knocked out nearly a fifth of U.S. oil-refining capacity. Hundreds of companies,
including airlines, home builders, insurers, oil refiners and retailers were hit, and many of
them are struggling to get back on their feet.

Harvey was the most powerful storm to hit Texas in more than 50 years, causing some $180
billion in damage.

Two weeks later, Hurricane Irma swept through the Florida Keys, submerging about 25 percent
of all dwellings in the region and killing at least 36 people in the United States. Irma caused
about $25 billion in insured losses, including $7 billion in the Caribbean, catastrophe modeler
Karen Clark & Co estimated on Wednesday. [nL2N1LU0HH]

The following table lists the effects of the two storms on some major U.S. companies:

be back up and we'll be back on our full load," Chief Executive

Darren Woods told CNBC earlier this month.

UPDATE 1-Six companies buy oil from U.S. emergency crude reserve - Reuters News

{{20170914T213739.608+0000}}UPDATE 1-Six companies buy oil from U.S. emergency crude reserve(Adds details on cost of the oil, link to document on the sale)

WASHINGTON, Sept 14 (Reuters) - Six companies bought 14 million barrels of oil from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve in a sale required by law to help fund medical research and the federal government, said the Department of Energy on Thursday.

BP Oil Supply, Exxon Mobil Corp, Phillips 66, Shell Trading, Valero Marketing and Supply Company, and Macquarie Commodities Trading bought oil from the reserve, which is held in salt caverns on the Texas and Louisiana coasts.

The companies bought the oil at a range from $46.98 to $47.91 a barrel, slightly below the current futures price of about $49.70 per barrel , depending on which location the crude came from and whether it was sent by pipeline or directly to vessels, which could export the petroleum.

FACTBOX-U.S. Gulf Coast energy infrastructure shut due to Harvey - 路透新闻

{{20170914T213602.037+0000}}FACTBOX-U.S. Gulf Coast energy infrastructure shut due to HarveySept 14 (Reuters) - Gulf Coast facilities continue to recover from the
devastating effects of Hurricane Harvey, which hammered Louisiana and Texas for
several days, shutting key infrastructure in the heart of the U.S. oil and
natural gas industry.

Several refineries, offshore platforms and portions of key pipelines resumed
operations as of Thursday after the storm knocked out roughly 4.4 million
barrels per day (bpd) of refining capacity, or nearly 24 percent of total U.S.
capacity, and about one-quarter of Gulf oil and natural gas production.
[nL2N1LE12X]

Thirteen of 20 affected refineries were at or near normal operating rates as
of Wednesday, according to IHS Markit. Five of the other seven were restarting
or ramping up operations. About 1.7 million bpd of distillation capacity, or 9
percent of the U.S. total, was offline as of Sept. 12.

UPDATE 3-BP-led group extends Azeri oil "contract of the century" - Reuters News

{{20170914T155402.127+0000}}UPDATE 3-BP-led group extends Azeri oil "contract of the century"* Deal to extend ACG field development into 2050

* Consortium to pay Baku bonus of $3.6 billion

* Azerbaijan's SOCAR to secure bigger stake

* BP to remain as operator

(Adds comment from SOCAR)

By Nailia Bagirova and Ron Bousso

BAKU/LONDON, Sept 14 (Reuters) - BP and Azerbaijan agreed on Thursday to extend into 2050 a contract to develop the ex-Soviet state's biggest oilfield cluster, a deal dubbed "the contract of the century" when first signed in 1994.

Under the new production sharing agreement, the Azeri state energy company SOCAR will increase its share to 25 percent from 11.65 percent, while BP's stake declines to 30.37 percent from 35.8 percent. BP will remain the operator.

The new contract secures large investment in Azerbaijan's oil sector for decades and a one-off bonus of $3.6 billion for the government, a welcome boost to a nation that has struggled with a sharp drop in oil prices in the past three years.

"This bonus will be paid to Azerbaijan in eight tranches in the next eight years after an agreement is ratified by Azerbaijan's parliament," a source at SOCAR told Reuters.

The 1994 agreement to develop the giant Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli (ACG) fields in the Caspian Sea was transformative for Baku's political and economic development after the collapse of the Soviet Union.

The new deal, whose exact terms were not disclosed, remains profitable for its partners at current oil prices of $55 a barrel, BP Chief Executive Officer Bob Dudley said in an interview. [nL5N1LV41H]

The fields produce 585,000 barrels per day, accounting for three quarters of the Azerbaijan's oil output, but production is expected to rise as the partners could invest up to $40 billion in the next 32 years, according to a statement.

"There are still billions of barrels to recover and billions of dollars to invest" in the project, said Wood Mackenzie analyst Laura Bennie.

"Attention will now turn to a brand-new production platform (Azeri Central East), which will be commissioned in the 2020s," she said.

Azeri President Ilham Aliyev said the remaining oil reserves of the ACG oilfields stood at 500 million tonnes.

Stakes of other firms in the consortium have also been reduced. Chevron now has 9.57 percent, Inpex <1605.T> 9.31 percent, Statoil 7.27 percent, ExxonMobil 6.79 percent, TPAO 5.73 percent, Itochu <8001.T> 3.65 percent and ONGC Videsh 2.31 percent.

UPDATE 1-Kashagan to cut CPC oil supplies to 700,000 tonnes in Sept - Reuters News

{{20170914T152039.895+0000}}UPDATE 1-Kashagan to cut CPC oil supplies to 700,000 tonnes in Sept(Adds details)

MOSCOW, Sept 14 (Reuters) - Kazakhstan's giant Kashagan oil field will feed about 700,000 tonnes of oil into the CPC pipeline this month, 400,000 tonnes less than originally planned, a CPC official told Reuters on Thursday.

Kashagan shipments via CPC have fallen below 10,000 tonnes per day this month after holding near 25,000 for several months, according to two sources familiar with the matter.

The two sources said Kashagan - which is an offshore field - had cut supplies because of some deposits being flooded by water. A third source said the field's processing plant had suffered a power outage last week.

The sources said Kashagan's daily output was now approaching normal levels, but the issue has not been resolved completely.

North Caspian Operating Company (NCOC), which operates Kashagan, did not reply to questions from Reuters about the reduction.

NCOC includes Eni , Total , Shell , ExxonMobil , Kazakh state firm KazMunayGaz, China's CNPC and Japan's Inpex <1605.T>.

UPDATE 1-Exxon Beaumont refinery full return may come by end of Sept –sources - 路透新闻

{{20170914T022006.709+0000}}UPDATE 1-Exxon Beaumont refinery full return may come by end of Sept –sources(Adds details, background)

HOUSTON, Sept 13 (Reuters) - ExxonMobil Corp may return its 362,300 barrel per day (bpd) Beaumont, Texas, refinery to full production by the end of September, said sources familiar with plant operations on Wednesday.

Exxon spokeswoman Charlotte Huffaker said the company did not have a timeline for resuming normal operations at the Beaumont refinery.

Exxon was initiating the refinery's restart on Wednesday, Huffaker said. The refinery was shut on Aug. 30 when Tropical Storm Harvey inundated the Beaumont area.

Exxon was warming up the Beaumont refinery's small crude distillation unit (CDU) on Wednesday ahead of the restart, the sources said.

Energy industry intelligence service Genscape said on Wednesday its cameras observed increased activity at the 110,000-bpd Crude A CDU.

CDUs do the initial refining of crude oil coming into a refinery and provide feedstock for all other productions units.

UPDATE 1-Norway gas pipeline investors go to top court over tariff cut - Reuters News

{{20170913T154315.813+0000}}UPDATE 1-Norway gas pipeline investors go to top court over tariff cut(Adds detail, background)

OSLO, Sept 13 (Reuters) - A group of investors in Norway's gas pipeline network are going to the country's highest court in a final attempt to overturn a government decision to cut pipeline tariffs that came into effect in October 2016.

The Supreme Court is expected to decide whether to hear the case in late 2017, one of the investors, Solveig Gas, said in a statement. The hearing, if accepted, will take place in 2018.

The government owns 45.8 percent of the Gassled pipeline network via state-owned Petoro, while majority state-owned Statoil has 5 percent.

The four investors pursuing the case own a combined 43.9 percent stake. They are in turn owned by Allianz , UBS , the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, Canada's Public Sector Pension Investment Board, the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and France's Caisse des Depots.

In June, a Norwegian appeals court ruled against the four in a lawsuit that argued the cut in gas pipeline tariffs was unlawful and would cost them a combined 15 billion Norwegian crowns ($1.8 billion) in lost earnings through 2028.

That verdict overturned a previous decision, and awarded the government 42.2 million crowns from the plaintiffs.

Some of the companies involved have said the unexpected decision to lower gas transportation tariffs would hurt the image of Norway as a country to invest in.

The government cut tariffs shortly after the four investors bought their stakes in Gassled in 2011 and 2012 from ExxonMobil , Total , Statoil and Royal Dutch Shell for a total of 32 billion crowns.

Norway's ministry of Petroleum and Energy was not immediately available for comment.

LEAD 1-Shell met fin à un siècle de production pétrolière en Irak - Reuters (French)

{{20170913T135026.492+0000}}LEAD 1-Shell met fin à un siècle de production pétrolière en Irak* Shell cède à Bagdad ses 45% dans le gisement de Majnoon

* Ses 20% dans West Qurna 1 sont aussi à vendre

* Le groupe, arrivé en 1912, ne produira plus que du gaz en Irak

(Actualisé avec contexte, précisions)

par Ron Bousso

LONDRES, 13 septembre (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell va mettre fin à un siècle de production pétrolière en Irak pour se concentrer sur l'exploitation plus rentable du gaz.

Confirmant une information de Reuters, la compagnie pétrolière anglo-néerlandaise a annoncé mercredi qu'elle s'était entendue avec le ministère irakien du Pétrole de lui céder ses parts dans le gisement de Majnoon, près de Bassorah dans le sud du pays, après une modification des termes de son accord. [nL5N1LT6DO]

Ce contrat qui courait jusqu'en 2030 accordait à Shell une part de 45% dans le gisement ouvert en 2010. La compagnie malaisienne Petronas a 30% et Bagdad détenait le solde.

Shell a aussi mis en vente sa participation de 20% dans le gisement de West Qurna 1, également dans le sud irakien, dont Exxon Mobil est l'opérateur principal.

La banque d'investissement Lazard est chargée de la vente, ont dit des sources du secteur à Reuters. Lazard n'a pas donné suite à une demande de commentaire.

Le retrait de Shell du pétrole irakien témoigne des difficultés éprouvées par les opérateurs étrangers dans le pays. L'Irak, membre de l'Opep, détient des réserves de pétrole parmi les plus importantes du monde mais les contrats qu'il propose n'offrent que de faibles marges et le gouvernement a demandé aux compagnies étrangères de serrer leurs coûts après la chute des cours en 2014.

Shell a dit ne pas quitter l'Irak, préférant concentrer ses efforts sur le développement de sa coentreprise de gaz Basra Gas Company. Le groupe anglo-néerlandais détient 44% de cette coentreprise qui traite du gaz extrait des champs de Rumaila, West Qurna et Zubair.

Shell a produit près de 20 millions de barils de pétrole en Irak en 2016, représentant environ 3% de sa production totale de brut, selon son rapport annuel.

Les termes précis de son contrat n'ont pas été rendus publics et le groupe n'a jamais détaillé ses résultats dans le pays mais des sources avaient indiqué qu'il était mécontent d'être payé en nature et d'avoir une influence limitée sur la stratégie.

"En mai 2017, le ministère du Pétrole a appliqué une pénalité de rendement et un facteur de rémunération sur la coentreprise de Shell du gisement de Majnoon, qui ont eu un impact important sur le plan commercial", a déclaré un porte-parole de Shell mercredi.

Shell a alors décidé qu'il était dans l'intérêt de toutes les parties de céder ses parts dans ce gisement au ministère du Pétrole irakien, a-t-il ajouté tout en soulignant que le groupe restait "très engagé" dans le gaz irakien.

Les compagnies étrangères font depuis longtemps pression sur l'Irak pour qu'il revoie ses conditions afin d'encourager le développement de réserves que le pays évalue à 153 milliards de barils, soit les quatrièmes plus importantes de l'Opep.

"Peut-être que cela va les faire bouger", a dit un responsable d'une autre compagnie étrangère présente en Irak.

Shell, via sa filiale Anglo Saxon Oil Company, faisait partie de la Turkish Petroleum Company, qui réunissait plusieurs compagnies européennes et avait obtenu de l'Empire ottoman en 1912 une concession pour explorer le sous-sol de l'actuel territoire irakien. De l'or noir y avait été découvert 15 ans plus tard.

RPT-UPDATE 1-Shell set to draw line under a century of Iraqi oil  - Reuters News

* Shell to relinquish stake in Majnoon field

* Oil giant in process of selling West Qurna 1 stake

* Company says to focus on Iraq's gas production

By Ron Bousso

LONDON, Sept 13 (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell is set to end a century of oil production in Iraq by withdrawing from two of the Arab state's flagship fields to focus on more profitable gas development.

Shell's retreat highlights the challenges foreign operators face with low-margin oil contracts in Iraq, an OPEC member that sits on some of the world's biggest oil reserves and wants to boost production after years of conflict hindered development.

The Anglo-Dutch firm said on Wednesday it had agreed with Iraq's oil ministry to relinquish operations at Majnoon field to the government after unfavourable changes to fiscal terms. The announcement confirmed an earlier Reuters report. [nL5N1LT67P]

Shell is also selling its 20 percent stake in West Qurna 1 oil field in the south of the country. The field is operated by Exxon Mobil .

Investment bank Lazard is running the sale for Shell, industry sources told Reuters. The bank did not immediately respond to a request for comment. [nL5N1LU2JV]

Shell said it was still committed to producing gas in Iraq, saying it would focus on developing and expanding the Basra Gas Company, which processes gas from the Rumaila, West Qurna and Zubair fields. It has a 44 percent stake in the joint venture.

Shell produced almost 20 million barrels of oil from Iraq during 2016, which accounted for about 3.5 percent of the firm's total oil output last year, according to Shell's annual report.

Precise terms of the contract terms are not public and Shell has not detailed its earnings from Iraqi oil.

But a source told Reuters last year Shell had found limited financial benefit in recent years from oil production in Iraq, where it is paid in crude but has limited say on strategy. [nL8N1DT50R]

"The Oil Minister of Iraq formally endorsed a recent Shell proposal to pursue an amicable and mutually acceptable release of the Shell interest in Majnoon, with the timeline to be agreed in due course," a Shell company spokesman said.

Shell took the decision after Iraq applied performance penalties on the Shell-operated venture "which had a significant impact on its commerciality," he said.

Battling a sharp fall in oil prices since 2014, Iraq asked foreign firms to cut spending on oil projects in order to reduce the cash-strapped government's contribution in shared ventures.

Foreign firms in Iraq have long urged Baghdad to revise oil production contract terms to encourage development of reserves that Iraq estimates at about 153 billion barrels, the fourth biggest in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.

"Maybe now they will speed things up," one executive from another company operating in Iraq said.

Shell, via its subsidiary Anglo Saxon Oil Company, was among a consortium of European firms called Turkish Petroleum Company which acquired concessions in 1912 from the Ottoman Empire to explore for oil in today's Iraq. Oil was found 15 years later.

Shell started developing Majnoon, which means "crazy" in Arabic, in 2010.

It holds a 45 percent stake in the field that it operates under a technical service contract that expires in 2030. Malaysia's national oil company Petronas holds a 30 percent stake, while Iraqi government holds 25 percent.

LONDON, Sept 13 (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell is set to end a century of oil production in Iraq by withdrawing from two of the Arab state's flagship fields to focus on more profitable gas development.

Shell's retreat highlights the challenges foreign operators face with low-margin oil contracts in Iraq, an OPEC member that sits on some of the world's biggest oil reserves and wants to boost production after years of conflict hindered development.

The Anglo-Dutch firm said on Wednesday it had agreed with Iraq's oil ministry to relinquish operations at Majnoon field to the government after unfavourable changes to fiscal terms. The announcement confirmed an earlier Reuters report. [nL5N1LT67P]

Shell is also selling its 20 percent stake in West Qurna 1 oil field in the south of the country. The field is operated by Exxon Mobil .

Investment bank Lazard is running the sale for Shell, industry sources told Reuters. The bank did not immediately respond to a request for comment. [nL5N1LU2JV]

Shell said it was still committed to producing gas in Iraq, saying it would focus on developing and expanding the Basra Gas Company, which processes gas from the Rumaila, West Qurna and Zubair fields. It has a 44 percent stake in the joint venture.

Shell produced almost 20 million barrels of oil from Iraq during 2016, which accounted for about 3.5 percent of the firm's total oil output last year, according to Shell's annual report.

Precise terms of the contract terms are not public and Shell has not detailed its earnings from Iraqi oil.

But a source told Reuters last year Shell had found limited financial benefit in recent years from oil production in Iraq, where it is paid in crude but has limited say on strategy. [nL8N1DT50R]

"The Oil Minister of Iraq formally endorsed a recent Shell proposal to pursue an amicable and mutually acceptable release of the Shell interest in Majnoon, with the timeline to be agreed in due course," a Shell company spokesman said.

Shell took the decision after Iraq applied performance penalties on the Shell-operated venture "which had a significant impact on its commerciality," he said.

Battling a sharp fall in oil prices since 2014, Iraq asked foreign firms to cut spending on oil projects in order to reduce the cash-strapped government's contribution in shared ventures.

Foreign firms in Iraq have long urged Baghdad to revise oil production contract terms to encourage development of reserves that Iraq estimates at about 153 billion barrels, the fourth biggest in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.

"Maybe now they will speed things up," one executive from another company operating in Iraq said.

Shell, via its subsidiary Anglo Saxon Oil Company, was among a consortium of European firms called Turkish Petroleum Company which acquired concessions in 1912 from the Ottoman Empire to explore for oil in today's Iraq. Oil was found 15 years later.

Shell started developing Majnoon, which means "crazy" in Arabic, in 2010.

It holds a 45 percent stake in the field that it operates under a technical service contract that expires in 2030. Malaysia's national oil company Petronas holds a 30 percent stake, while Iraqi government holds 25 percent.

UPDATE 1-Norway gas pipeline investors go to top court over tariff cut - Reuters News

{{20170913T154315.813+0000}}UPDATE 1-Norway gas pipeline investors go to top court over tariff cut(Adds detail, background)

OSLO, Sept 13 (Reuters) - A group of investors in Norway's gas pipeline network are going to the country's highest court in a final attempt to overturn a government decision to cut pipeline tariffs that came into effect in October 2016.

The Supreme Court is expected to decide whether to hear the case in late 2017, one of the investors, Solveig Gas, said in a statement. The hearing, if accepted, will take place in 2018.

The government owns 45.8 percent of the Gassled pipeline network via state-owned Petoro, while majority state-owned Statoil has 5 percent.

The four investors pursuing the case own a combined 43.9 percent stake. They are in turn owned by Allianz , UBS , the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, Canada's Public Sector Pension Investment Board, the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and France's Caisse des Depots.

In June, a Norwegian appeals court ruled against the four in a lawsuit that argued the cut in gas pipeline tariffs was unlawful and would cost them a combined 15 billion Norwegian crowns ($1.8 billion) in lost earnings through 2028.

That verdict overturned a previous decision, and awarded the government 42.2 million crowns from the plaintiffs.

Some of the companies involved have said the unexpected decision to lower gas transportation tariffs would hurt the image of Norway as a country to invest in.

The government cut tariffs shortly after the four investors bought their stakes in Gassled in 2011 and 2012 from ExxonMobil , Total , Statoil and Royal Dutch Shell for a total of 32 billion crowns.

Norway's ministry of Petroleum and Energy was not immediately available for comment.

LEAD 1-Shell met fin à un siècle de production pétrolière en Irak - Reuters (French)

{{20170913T135026.492+0000}}LEAD 1-Shell met fin à un siècle de production pétrolière en Irak* Shell cède à Bagdad ses 45% dans le gisement de Majnoon

* Ses 20% dans West Qurna 1 sont aussi à vendre

* Le groupe, arrivé en 1912, ne produira plus que du gaz en Irak

(Actualisé avec contexte, précisions)

par Ron Bousso

LONDRES, 13 septembre (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell va mettre fin à un siècle de production pétrolière en Irak pour se concentrer sur l'exploitation plus rentable du gaz.

Confirmant une information de Reuters, la compagnie pétrolière anglo-néerlandaise a annoncé mercredi qu'elle s'était entendue avec le ministère irakien du Pétrole de lui céder ses parts dans le gisement de Majnoon, près de Bassorah dans le sud du pays, après une modification des termes de son accord. [nL5N1LT6DO]

Ce contrat qui courait jusqu'en 2030 accordait à Shell une part de 45% dans le gisement ouvert en 2010. La compagnie malaisienne Petronas a 30% et Bagdad détenait le solde.

Shell a aussi mis en vente sa participation de 20% dans le gisement de West Qurna 1, également dans le sud irakien, dont Exxon Mobil est l'opérateur principal.

La banque d'investissement Lazard est chargée de la vente, ont dit des sources du secteur à Reuters. Lazard n'a pas donné suite à une demande de commentaire.

Le retrait de Shell du pétrole irakien témoigne des difficultés éprouvées par les opérateurs étrangers dans le pays. L'Irak, membre de l'Opep, détient des réserves de pétrole parmi les plus importantes du monde mais les contrats qu'il propose n'offrent que de faibles marges et le gouvernement a demandé aux compagnies étrangères de serrer leurs coûts après la chute des cours en 2014.

Shell a dit ne pas quitter l'Irak, préférant concentrer ses efforts sur le développement de sa coentreprise de gaz Basra Gas Company. Le groupe anglo-néerlandais détient 44% de cette coentreprise qui traite du gaz extrait des champs de Rumaila, West Qurna et Zubair.

Shell a produit près de 20 millions de barils de pétrole en Irak en 2016, représentant environ 3% de sa production totale de brut, selon son rapport annuel.

Les termes précis de son contrat n'ont pas été rendus publics et le groupe n'a jamais détaillé ses résultats dans le pays mais des sources avaient indiqué qu'il était mécontent d'être payé en nature et d'avoir une influence limitée sur la stratégie.

"En mai 2017, le ministère du Pétrole a appliqué une pénalité de rendement et un facteur de rémunération sur la coentreprise de Shell du gisement de Majnoon, qui ont eu un impact important sur le plan commercial", a déclaré un porte-parole de Shell mercredi.

Shell a alors décidé qu'il était dans l'intérêt de toutes les parties de céder ses parts dans ce gisement au ministère du Pétrole irakien, a-t-il ajouté tout en soulignant que le groupe restait "très engagé" dans le gaz irakien.

Les compagnies étrangères font depuis longtemps pression sur l'Irak pour qu'il revoie ses conditions afin d'encourager le développement de réserves que le pays évalue à 153 milliards de barils, soit les quatrièmes plus importantes de l'Opep.

"Peut-être que cela va les faire bouger", a dit un responsable d'une autre compagnie étrangère présente en Irak.

Shell, via sa filiale Anglo Saxon Oil Company, faisait partie de la Turkish Petroleum Company, qui réunissait plusieurs compagnies européennes et avait obtenu de l'Empire ottoman en 1912 une concession pour explorer le sous-sol de l'actuel territoire irakien. De l'or noir y avait été découvert 15 ans plus tard.

UPDATE 2-U.S. Coast Guard, EPA cleaning up a dozen Texas chemical spills after Harvey - Reuters News

{{20170911T221931.717+0000}}UPDATE 2-U.S. Coast Guard, EPA cleaning up a dozen Texas chemical spills after Harvey(Adds NuStar comment in paragraph 8)

By Emily Flitter

HOUSTON, Sept 11 (Reuters) - The U.S. Coast Guard and the Environmental Protection Agency are working with Texas state regulators to clean up oil and chemicals spilled from a dozen industrial facilities after flooding from Hurricane Harvey, authorities said.

The spills came from oil refineries, fuel terminals and other businesses, but EPA spokeswoman Terri White said it was not possible to provide an estimate for the amounts spilled.

"Initial reports were based on observation," White said. "Some spills were already being cleaned up by the time EPA or other officials arrived to assess them and others had already migrated offsite."

Refineries owned by Valero Energy Corp in Houston, Motiva Inc in Port Arthur, and Exxon Mobile Corp in Baytown, were among the facilities that had reported spills, according to White. Representatives for those companies did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Officials also reported spills at Kinder Morgan Inc's Pasadena fuel storage terminal and at an oil terminal in Texas City owned by NuStar Energy LP .

Kinder Morgan spokeswoman Lexey Long said on Monday the company reported a spill of 500 barrels of gasoline on Aug. 27. Workers covered the spill with a foam blanket and set up a barrier to keep the public away.

"The spill has been fully remediated," she said.

NuStar spokesman Chris Cho said a small amount of petroleum contact water spilled out of a storage tank into a containment area and was quickly cleaned up. "There were no injuries and no environmental impact," he said.

Two wastewater treatment plants - Integrity Golden Triangle Marine Services of Port Arthur and San Jacinto River and Rail in Beaumont - also appeared on the list of spill response locations that EPA provided to Reuters.

A San Jacinto River and Rail spokesman said the plant had spilled a "foamy emulsion" when floodwaters overtopped the berms around its facility but its operators did not expect any health or environmental impacts.

Integrity Golden Triangle President Robert Goolsby said a wastewater pit at his plant overflowed into a concrete moat designed to contain such spills, and plant workers were already cleaning it up when state regulators and the Coast Guard arrived.

The liquid spills come in addition to more than a million pounds of toxic emissions above legal limits that spewed from industrial facilities following Harvey, according to reports from companies filed with the Texas Commission for Environmental Quality.

The EPA and other authorities had warned people affected by the flood that waters could contain bacteria and toxic chemicals, but have said little yet about the specific origins or quantities of substances.

Residents in Baytown, where houses sit along the Houston Ship Channel next to several major refineries and chemical plants, said they were concerned about the impact of the spills and releases on health.

"I'm against the sword and the wall, what can I do?" said Carlos Caban, one of the residents, whose son had taken pictures of contaminated-looking floodwaters in nearby refinery site.

Several residents reported seeing a metallic sheen on water flowing near the plants during the heaviest flooding, posting videos to YouTube.

"Some is on our property and some is on adjacent property which has already been cleaned up," said spokesman Dennis Winkler. "We do not expect a long-term environmental impact. We do not expect there will be any air impact or health impacts."

UPDATE 1-ExxonMobil slashes LNG price to India in bad omen for producers - Reuters News

{{20170911T072523.003+0000}}UPDATE 1-ExxonMobil slashes LNG price to India in bad omen for producers* ExxonMobil agrees to renegotiate 20-year LNG contract

* Buyers have upper hand amid LNG oversupply - analysts

* India's Petronet to buy more LNG from Gorgon project

(Adds Petronet statement, details of the deal)

By Sonali Paul and Nidhi Verma

MELBOURNE/NEW DELHI, Sept 11 (Reuters) - India has won a price cut on a 20-year liquefied natural gas (LNG) deal with global giant ExxonMobil Corp in a rare contract renegotiation, a bad sign for producers in a heavily oversupplied global market.

In a trade-off for ExxonMobil, India's Petronet LNG will increase its volumes from the Gorgon LNG project in Australia by an extra 1 million tonnes a year to about 2.5 million tonnes a year, but at cheaper rates than initially agreed in 2009.

Long-term contracts are rarely revised in the LNG market, and for a big producer to cave in shows how supply from new plants in Australia and the United States over the past two years has transformed the market, analysts said.

"This trend is overall a negative for sellers, as they are forced to provide more flexibility to buyers' needs to maintain their markets," said Saul Kavonic, an analyst with energy consultants Wood Mackenzie.

India has been aggressive in seeking cheaper deals, also renegotiating a contract with Qatar in 2015, but the real pain for producers would come if major Asian buyers in Japan, Korea and China followed suit.

"Happy to share good news that India has, yet again been able to address the long term price issue of LNG from Gorgon to suit Indian market," India's oil minister, Dharmendra Pradhan, said on Saturday on social media.

Indian consumers would soon receive LNG at an "amicable price", Pradhan said. India started receiving Gorgon supplies from January this year.

Petronet said in a stock exchange announcement on Monday it had reached a "broad understanding of terms" with ExxonMobil, without giving further details.

Citing market sources, RBC analyst Ben Wilson estimated ExxonMobil would receive 15 percent less revenue per unit on its sales to Petronet under the new deal.

If ExxonMobil had not agreed to renegotiate, Petronet might have scrapped the agreement, leaving the major to pursue damages and resell the volumes on a weak spot market.

"They've probably taken the lesser of two evils," said Wilson, adding that it did not bode well for other LNG producers such as Australia's Woodside Petroleum which has targeted India to diversify its heavy exposure to Japan and South Korea.

In a major shift from previous contractual terms, Exxon has agreed to absorb shipping charges, two sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.

The original LNG supplies would be priced at less than 14 percent of the Brent oil price, down from about 14.5 percent earlier, while the additional supplies would be priced about 12.5 percent of Brent, the sources said.

ExxonMobil, which controls about a quarter of the 15.6 million tonnes a year Gorgon project, had no immediate comment.

Analysts said the fact India had managed to force ExxonMobil to renegotiate was the latest proof that buyers have the upper hand in a market where LNG spot prices are well below oil-linked contract prices that were signed during the oil boom.

"The risk of price renegotiations will become more acute over the next couple years as spot LNG prices remain depressed, even if oil linked prices rise," Wood Mackenzie's Kavonic said.

"The elephant in the room will be how negotiations play out with traditional markets in Japan and Korea, and especially the Chinese national oil companies."

India Petronet set to buy extra 1 mln T Australian LNG from Exxon - sources - Reuters News

{{20170911T055125.461+0000}}India Petronet set to buy extra 1 mln T Australian LNG from Exxon - sourcesNEW DELHI, Sept 11 (Reuters) - India's Petronet LNG has agreed to buy an additional one million tonnes of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from ExxonMobil's share of the Gorgon project in Australia, two sources said on Monday, after the global giant eased the terms of a previous deal.

Petronet will buy the LNG on delivered basis with a price equivalent to about 12.5 percent of Brent oil prices, the sources said. The deal for additional volumes is yet to be signed.

Indian Oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan said on Saturday that Petronet has been able to renegotiate a contract agreed in 2009 for around 1.5 million tonnes a year of LNG from ExxonMobil's share of the Gorgon LNG project in Australia.[nL4N1LQ0CS]

ExxonMobil slashes 20-year LNG price to India in bad omen for producers - Reuters News

{{20170911T025139.966+0000}}ExxonMobil slashes 20-year LNG price to India in bad omen for producers* Petronet gets roughly 15 pct price cut, analyst says

* Supply glut forces ExxonMobil to capitulate

* Price cut makes life tougher for sellers into India

By Sonali Paul

MELBOURNE, Sept 11 (Reuters) - India has won a big price cut on a 20-year liquefied natural gas (LNG) deal with global giant ExxonMobil Corp in a rare contract renegotiation, a bad sign for global producers in a heavily oversupplied market.

Long-term contracts are rarely revised in the LNG market, and for a big producer to cave in shows how supply from new plants in Australia and the United States over the past two years has transformed the market, analysts said.

"This trend is overall a negative for sellers, as they are forced to provide more flexibility to buyers' needs to maintain their markets," said Saul Kavonic, an analyst with energy consultants Wood Mackenzie.

India has been aggressive in seeking cheaper deals, also renegotiating a contract with Qatar in 2015, but the real pain for producers would come if major Asian buyers in Japan, Korea and China followed suit.

India's oil minister, Dharmendra Pradhan, said on Saturday the country had been able to renegotiate a contract agreed in 2009 for around 1.5 million tonnes a year of LNG from ExxonMobil's share of the Gorgon LNG project in Australia going to Petronet LNG . [nL4N1LQ0BG]

"Happy to share good news that India has, yet again been able to address the long term price issue of LNG from Gorgon to suit Indian market," Pradhan said on social media.

Indian consumers would soon receive LNG at an "amicable price", he said. Gorgon began exporting LNG last year.

Citing market sources, RBC analyst Ben Wilson estimated ExxonMobil would receive 15 percent less revenue per unit on its sales to Petronet under the new deal.

If ExxonMobil had not agreed to renegotiate the contract, Petronet might have scrapped the agreement, leaving the major to pursue damages and resell the volumes on a weak spot market.

"They've probably taken the lesser of two evils," said Wilson, adding that it did not bode well for other LNG producers such as Australia's Woodside Petroleum which has targeted India to diversify its heavy exposure to Japan and South Korea.

ExxonMobil had no immediate comment.

Analysts said the fact India had managed to force ExxonMobil to renegotiate was the latest proof that buyers have the upper hand in a market where LNG spot prices are well below oil-linked contract prices that were signed during the oil boom.

"The risk of price renegotiations will become more acute over the next couple years as spot LNG prices remain depressed, even if oil linked prices rise," Wood Mackenzie's Kavonic said.

"The elephant in the room will be how negotiations play out with traditional markets in Japan and Korea, and especially the Chinese national oil companies."

RPT-UPDATE 1-Will Saudi Aramco deliver world record profit for next year's IPO? - Reuters News

{{20170910T060001.729+0000}}RPT-UPDATE 1-Will Saudi Aramco deliver world record profit for next year's IPO?(Repeats with no changes to text)

* Saudi Aramco is world's biggest oil producing company

* IPO aims to raise cash for kingdom's investment plans

* Saudi crown prince suggests company worth $2 trillion

* Valuation demands annual earnings around $130 billion

By Dmitry Zhdannikov and Ron Bousso

LONDON, Sept 8 (Reuters) - When oil giant Saudi Aramco discloses its financials for the first time next year, it must either surprise investors with world record profits or reduce its aspirations for a $2 trillion valuation in its initial public offering (IPO). [IPO-ARMO.SE]

Investors have long debated whether Aramco could be valued anywhere close to $2 trillion, the figure suggested by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who wants to raise cash through the IPO to finance investments aimed at helping wean the world's biggest oil exporting nation off dependency on crude.

Based on Aramco's oil reserves of 261 billion barrels and a valuation of $7 to $8 per barrel in line with recent industry acquisitions - such as Total's purchase of Maersk's oil assets - Aramco warrants close to the $2 trillion valuation.

But that is not the only metric for an energy firm's worth. By other measures, Aramco's target valuation may be challenging.

Most other metrics for the world's largest oil producing company are simply not known and will not be disclosed until Aramco publishes financial results before the planned IPO in 2018.

Yet a simple calculation using globally accepted ratios for Aramco's peers - enterprise value versus core earnings (EV/EBITDA) - shows the Saudi firm has to report EBITDA in the region of $130 billion to achieve a $2 trillion valuation.

Such an EBITDA figure would be a global first. No firm in any industry has reported earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) above $100 billion.

By comparison, Apple , the technology giant and the world's most valuable listed firm that is worth more than $830 billion, reported EBITDA of $82 billion in 2015, according to Thomson Reuters Eikon data.

AWAITING BOOK-BUILDING

Exxon Mobil , the world's largest listed energy firm with a market capitalisation of $365 billion in 2016, reported EBITDA of $23 billion last year, according to Thomson Reuters Eikon data. In 2012, it reported EBITDA of $65 billion - but that was when oil traded well above $100 a barrel. Benchmark Brent crude is now around $54 .

Last year, Exxon traded at EV/EBITDA of more than 15 times, which is high by energy industry standards. If Aramco matched that same high ratio, its core earnings would need to be around $130 billion to achieve its target valuation.

Aramco would not be drawn when asked to comment on how it would achieve the $2 trillion figure.

"This is highly speculative. We do not comment on speculation or rumour," the company told Reuters in a statement.

A Saudi Arabia-based industry source said Aramco's value could not be calculated until the completion of book-building to assess investor appetite.

The source said it was misleading to compare Aramco with Exxon, which has less than half the Saudi firm's oil output and not even a 10th of its reserves. EBITDA should not be the only measure, the source added.

Nevertheless, Aramco would do well to secure Exxon's high ratios. Investors tend to like Exxon more than other oil firms, handing it ratios that are sometimes more generous than popular technology firms such as Google and Apple.

For example, Exxon's rivals Shell , BP and Total trade at EV/EBITDA of around six times. If Aramco was assessed at that level, it would need to show core earnings at an astonishing $330 billion a year to achieve a valuation of $2 trillion.

"One thing you never do ahead of an IPO is to tell the market how much the company will be worth as you immediately become hostage to a number or a timetable," said a Western investment banker, who was involved in listing another state energy firm.

DRAWING CONCLUSIONS

Yet Aramco could prove hugely profitable, given its oil output of about 10 million barrels per day (bpd) and some of the world's cheapest crude recovery rates, alongside its global refinery network that adds further value.

Exxon by comparison has less than half Aramco's output - with oil-equivalent production of 4 million bpd in 2016, while the U.S. firm's reserves are a fraction of Aramco's - with proved oil-equivalent reserves of about 20 billion barrels.

Aramco has never published results, but conclusions about its earnings can be drawn from Saudi Arabia's accounts, given oil constitutes the lion's share of the nation's revenues, said Fareed Mohamedi, chief economist at U.S.-based Rapidan Group.

"Based on the Saudi current-account balance, Aramco had revenues of $160 billion last year from just oil and refined products exports when the average price of oil was $43 a barrel," Mohamedi said.

"So if the price of oil goes to $70 per barrel, it is not impossible for Aramco to make a top line of $250 billion a year. Given that operational costs of Aramco are one of the lowest in the world, it is not impossible to see them reporting the bottom line or earnings on a huge scale – of $100 billion a year and above," he said.

Financials aside, investors will also assess country risk when working out Aramco's valuation.

Exxon benefits from having its headquarters in the United States, even if some of its operations and production are in politically unstable nations.

Aramco's head office is in Saudi Arabia, a nation in a volatile region with a war in Yemen on its doorstep.

"Aramco is definitely a fantastic, modern and high-quality company," said the Western banker. "But unfortunately, no one can say that Saudi Arabia is a fantastic country from the geopolitical prospect."

India renegotiates LNG deal with Exxon - oil minister - Reuters News

{{20170909T193412.520+0000}}India renegotiates LNG deal with Exxon - oil minister* India to get Gorgon LNG at "amicable price" soon- minister

* India now to get Gorgon LNG on delivered basis

* LNG will now cost 13-13.5 pct of oil price

By Nidhi Verma

NEW DELHI, Sept 9 (Reuters) - India has renegotiated the pricing of liquefied natural gas (LNG) imported from Australia's Gorgon project to make the imported fuel affordable to price-sensitive domestic customers, Indian oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan said on Saturday.

India has been trying to leverage its position as one of the biggest energy consumers to strike better bargains for its companies. In 2015 it renegotiated the LNG pricing formula with Qatar's Rasgas to buy the gas at half the original price.

"Indian customers will receive (Gorgon) LNG volumes at an amicable price soon. This is done in a similar way to what we did with LNG from Qatar," Pradhan said in a tweet.

India's top gas importer Petronet LNG signed a deal in 2009 with Exxon Mobil Corp to buy 1.5 million tonnes of LNG annually from Gorgon for 20 years. At that time Petronet agreed to buy LNG at a cost equivalent to 14.5 percent of the oil price and to pay for the shipping freight as well.

Supplies under the deal began from January 2017, with the landed price of gas costing about $11-$13 per million British thermal units (mmBtu), almost double that of Asian spot LNG prices.

The Gorgon gas prices are now linked to about 13-13.5 percent of the global oil price on a delivered basis, two sources with knowledge of the negotiation said.

Renegotiation of the deal also shows how softening oil prices and a global supply glut are forcing LNG exporters to offer better deals to retain their share in global energy markets.

India wants to gradually move to a gas-based economy and aims to double the cleaner fuel's share in its energy mix to 15 percent in the next few years.

Petronet's managing director Prabhat Singh declined comment and Pradhan did not specify changes in the pricing formula.

"Happy to share good news that India has, yet again, been able to address the long-term price issue of LNG from Gorgon to suit Indian market," Pradhan said in a tweet.

By Jarrett Renshaw and Ernest Scheyder

NEW YORK/HOUSTON, Sept 8 (Reuters) - Oil and petrochemical plants along the U.S. Gulf Coast intend to go ahead with plans for near record spending on expansions next year, despite Hurricane Harvey driving up labor costs and slowing work, experts said.

Harvey largely spared oil and petrochemical plants along the U.S. Gulf Coast from significant damage but thousands of homes and businesses were not as fortunate. Refiners and recovery projects will compete for the same labor, driving up costs or causing labor shortages.

Industrial investment in the Gulf Coast is expected to hit $51.9 billion next year, near the 2015 peak, requiring an army of pipefitters, ironworkers and other craftsman, said Industrial Information Resources (IIR), which tracks labor supply for refiners and other industrial companies.

"We had a labor shortage before Harvey, but now it's significantly worse," said IIR's Anthony Salemme. "It's going to spread to soft crafts like painters and insulators."

Investments have soared in recent years because the shale revolution fed off an existing infrastructure. The region's deep water ports and expanding pipeline and storage networks offer an easy outlet to global markets. It also boasts a welcoming regulatory climate and skilled workforce.

Since 2010, $85 billion worth of petrochemical projects have started or been completed across the United States, nearly all of them in the Gulf Coast region, according to the American Chemistry Council.

But the concentration along the Gulf of Mexico leaves these facilities and supporting networks exposed to the brutal force of tropical storms and hurricanes, as Harvey laid bare last month.

The storm shut roughly a quarter of the nation's refinery capacity and more than a dozen petrochemical plants halted operations. Ports were closed and key fuel pipelines serving the Midwest and U.S. Northeast were partially or completely shut, driving up pump prices as fears of fuel shortages took hold.

Preliminary assessments suggest that storm's hit to the region is not deterring companies from going ahead with existing projects. But global commodities buyers such as Ineos Group [INEOSG.UL] and Reliance Industries Ltd that relied on existing facilities shut by the storm may now consider putting some warehouses and stock elsewhere.

"The robustness of the supply chain is brought a little more under attention," said David Witte, a senior vice president at consultants IHS Markit. "They may be looking at it differently."

Construction costs also could slow some work.

INVESTMENT PLANS

There is no sign that major new projects are under threat. Several with plans on the drawing board, including BASF SE , DowDuPont Inc and Exxon Mobil Corp are sticking to growth plans. Others said they will repair Harvey's damage before making any decisions on long-term strategy for the region.

Exxon earlier this year said it would invest $20 billion to expand Texas refining and petrochemical operations in Beaumont, Corpus Christi and Baytown. All three communities were damaged by Harvey. [nL8N1LL480]

As part of that expansion, Exxon and Saudi Basic Industries Corp <2010.SE> are proposing an about $10 billion chemical plant in Corpus Christi, near where Harvey made landfall. The project is moving forward, according to a source familiar with the matter.

Exxon spokesman Scott Silvestri declined to comment.

DowDuPont is also undeterred from an ongoing $4 billion expansion project that includes new capacity in Freeport, Texas, on the coast. "Hurricane Harvey does not change our perspective on the region being a great location for our investments," spokeswoman Rachelle Schikorra said in a statement.

Royal Dutch Shell Plc , which is expanding its operations in the Gulf, also has proposed new investments in western Pennsylvania, near the natural gas-rich Marcellus formation.

The plant will help Shell capture a larger share of the U.S. market for polyethylene, more than half of which is concentrated in northern states. It took Shell years to make the decision to build the plant.

Pennsylvania has started to position itself as a second U.S. refining region, even though new plants are years away from opening. The state lacks the specialized refining workforce and proximity to open water - and the Panama Canal - that make the Gulf Coast area still so appealing.

The U.S. Gulf Coast will remain an attractive investment area, said Shell spokesman Curtis Smith and other energy officials.

"What this storm has demonstrated is the resilience of the energy system," said Torgrim Reitan, who runs Statoil ASA's U.S. operations. "Even a Harvey can't take out this capacity."

UPDATE 1-Exxon Beaumont refinery may remain shut until first week of Oct –sources - 路透新闻

{{20170908T184129.600+0000}}UPDATE 1-Exxon Beaumont refinery may remain shut until first week of Oct –sources(Adds more details, Exxon statement)

HOUSTON, Sept 8 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp's 362,300-barrel-per-day (bpd) Beaumont, Texas, refinery may remain closed until the first week of October as it recovers from Hurricane Harvey, sources familiar with plant operations said on Friday.

Exxon, in a statement to Reuters, said the company is "preparing to begin restart activities" at the refinery.

The refinery was shut on Aug. 30 as Harvey drenched southeast Texas. Exxon has said the lower portion of the refinery flooded because of the heavy rain.

More than 4.4 million barrels of U.S. daily refining capacity - about a quarter of what the nation can produce - was shut in as a result of Harvey, which reached land on Aug. 25 and deluged the Texas coast with several feet of rain. Most of the refineries shut are currently in the restarting process.

EXCLUSIVE-BP's stake in giant Azeri oilfields set to fall -sources - Reuters News

{{20170908T140550.386+0000}}EXCLUSIVE-BP's stake in giant Azeri oilfields set to fall -sourcesBy Margarita Antidze

TBILISI/BAKU, Sept 8 (Reuters) - BP's stake in Azerbaijan's vast oilfields is expected to shrink under a new production-sharing agreement with state energy company SOCAR, two industry sources familiar with the talks told Reuters.

Azerbaijan plans to sign a new contract with BP next week on development of the giant Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli (ACG) oilfields that will run until 2050.

The fields are the largest oilfields in the Azerbaijan sector of the Caspian basin.

An existing deal is due to expire in 2024 and a BP-led consortium and SOCAR signed a letter of intent in December to continue development of the oilfields until 2050 in a move to unlock billions of dollars of fresh investment.

"According to preliminary information, SOCAR will increase its share at the expense of a share reduction of other companies, including BP," an industry source aware of the negotiations told Reuters.

Another industry source, who also is familiar with the talks and did not want to be identified, said SOCAR's share could increase to 20 percent from the current 11.6 percent while BP's share could fall to 30 percent from 35.8 percent.

"The shares of some other companies might be also reduced," the source said. The figures in the final contract might still change, the source said.

A spokeswoman for BP in Azerbaijan said: "We don't have information on the content of the contract now."

A SOCAR spokesman said the company had no immediate comment.

The shareholders in the consortium include BP, SOCAR, Chevron , INPEX <1605.T>, Statoil , ExxonMobil , TPAO, ITOCHU <8001.T> and ONGC Videsh .

The sources said that BP would remain the project operator, although some of its existing rights might be delegated to SOCAR.

BP came under fire from Azeri President Ilham Aliyev earlier this decade for lower than promised output.

Oil output at ACG totalled 14 million tonnes in the first half of 2017, or 585,000 barrels per day, down from 16 million tonnes a year earlier.

Indigenous Mapuche thwart Argentina shale development - Reuters News

{{20170908T140002.272+0000}}Indigenous Mapuche thwart Argentina shale developmentBy Juliana Castilla

BUENOS AIRES, Sept 8 (Reuters) - Indigenous Mapuche communities demanding cash payments and blocking oil wells in Argentina's Vaca Muerta area are threatening the long delayed development of the world's second-largest shale fields, oil companies say.

Since the beginning of the year the Mapuche have cut off access to 14 wells in the Loma de la Lata field, one of only two shale fields currently producing in the Belgium-sized Vaca Muerta area, state-run YPF said in an e-mailed statement.

YPF , Argentina's largest oil company, spent 55 million pesos ($3 million) on payments to a Kaxipayiñ Mapuche community leader last year, more than double the payments in 2014, a company source said.

The conflict is intensifying as President Mauricio Macri prioritizes attracting energy investment to develop the area and end Argentina's reliance on imported energy.

"It affects us a lot," YPF Chairman Miguel Gutierrez said of the Mapuche conflict in a recent interview. "It's a situation that has been developing for many years and now it must be resolved."

A private oil company source who was not authorized to speak on the record said Mapuche communities are eyeing a greater share of the expected boom in the form of cash payments.

Companies including Exxon Mobil Corp , France's Total SA , BP PLC unit Pan American Energy LLC and Royal Dutch Shell PLC have announced investments in Vaca Muerta in recent months.

Part of Loma de la Lata field is on government-recognized Mapuche territory. Argentine law gives companies the right to extract natural resources found beneath private property, and the state compensates the owner for use of the land.

Kaxipayiñ Mapuche leader Gabriel Cherqui says his people are not opposed to drilling and only want YPF to clean up pollution.

"Imagine you find yourself overnight with 10 drilling towers in the yard of your house and you see them throwing polluted water on either side and breaking everything," he said in an interview, adding that members of his community have cancer and seen the number of abortions rise.

YPF denies polluting, though it admits there is contamination in the area from oil operations some 25 years ago. In a statement YPF said the Kaxipayiñ community has blocked cleanup efforts "and pursues interests that have nothing to do with the environment."

The private company source said the Mapuche also demand companies hire certain private contractors that charge more than the market rate. Cherqui could not be reached to respond to that point.

The Argentine government's relationship with the broader Mapuche community has grown tense in recent weeks as human rights groups accuse federal security forces in the disappearance of a man from a Mapuche rights protest in the Patagonian province of Chubut. He has not been seen for over a month, spurring nationwide protests. The government says it is investigating. [nL1N1KX1DA]

YPF's Gutierrez said companies had called on the provincial government of Neuquen, where Loma de la Lata is located, to mediate a solution. Companies had previously negotiated access to wells directly with the Mapuche. The Neuquen government did not respond the request for comment.

"What we have to achieve is a protocol to follow and all the parties know: the Mapuches, the industry and regulatory authorities," he said.

"We are starting a ramping up of development in Vaca Muerta. There is a great opportunity and we have to standardize this type of dialogue."

India renegotiates LNG deal with Exxon - oil minister - Reuters News

{{20170909T193412.520+0000}}India renegotiates LNG deal with Exxon - oil minister* India to get Gorgon LNG at "amicable price" soon- minister

* India now to get Gorgon LNG on delivered basis

* LNG will now cost 13-13.5 pct of oil price

By Nidhi Verma

NEW DELHI, Sept 9 (Reuters) - India has renegotiated the pricing of liquefied natural gas (LNG) imported from Australia's Gorgon project to make the imported fuel affordable to price-sensitive domestic customers, Indian oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan said on Saturday.

India has been trying to leverage its position as one of the biggest energy consumers to strike better bargains for its companies. In 2015 it renegotiated the LNG pricing formula with Qatar's Rasgas to buy the gas at half the original price.

"Indian customers will receive (Gorgon) LNG volumes at an amicable price soon. This is done in a similar way to what we did with LNG from Qatar," Pradhan said in a tweet.

India's top gas importer Petronet LNG signed a deal in 2009 with Exxon Mobil Corp to buy 1.5 million tonnes of LNG annually from Gorgon for 20 years. At that time Petronet agreed to buy LNG at a cost equivalent to 14.5 percent of the oil price and to pay for the shipping freight as well.

Supplies under the deal began from January 2017, with the landed price of gas costing about $11-$13 per million British thermal units (mmBtu), almost double that of Asian spot LNG prices.

The Gorgon gas prices are now linked to about 13-13.5 percent of the global oil price on a delivered basis, two sources with knowledge of the negotiation said.

Renegotiation of the deal also shows how softening oil prices and a global supply glut are forcing LNG exporters to offer better deals to retain their share in global energy markets.

India wants to gradually move to a gas-based economy and aims to double the cleaner fuel's share in its energy mix to 15 percent in the next few years.

Petronet's managing director Prabhat Singh declined comment and Pradhan did not specify changes in the pricing formula.

"Happy to share good news that India has, yet again, been able to address the long-term price issue of LNG from Gorgon to suit Indian market," Pradhan said in a tweet.

{{20170908T214817.398+0000}}REFILE-RPT-Harvey may pinch some Gulf Coast refining, chemical projects (Corrects spelling of compete in second paragraph)

By Jarrett Renshaw and Ernest Scheyder

NEW YORK/HOUSTON, Sept 8 (Reuters) - Oil and petrochemical plants along the U.S. Gulf Coast intend to go ahead with plans for near record spending on expansions next year, despite Hurricane Harvey driving up labor costs and slowing work, experts said.

Harvey largely spared oil and petrochemical plants along the U.S. Gulf Coast from significant damage but thousands of homes and businesses were not as fortunate. Refiners and recovery projects will compete for the same labor, driving up costs or causing labor shortages.

Industrial investment in the Gulf Coast is expected to hit $51.9 billion next year, near the 2015 peak, requiring an army of pipefitters, ironworkers and other craftsman, said Industrial Information Resources (IIR), which tracks labor supply for refiners and other industrial companies.

"We had a labor shortage before Harvey, but now it's significantly worse," said IIR's Anthony Salemme. "It's going to spread to soft crafts like painters and insulators."

Investments have soared in recent years because the shale revolution fed off an existing infrastructure. The region's deep water ports and expanding pipeline and storage networks offer an easy outlet to global markets. It also boasts a welcoming regulatory climate and skilled workforce.

Since 2010, $85 billion worth of petrochemical projects have started or been completed across the United States, nearly all of them in the Gulf Coast region, according to the American Chemistry Council.

But the concentration along the Gulf of Mexico leaves these facilities and supporting networks exposed to the brutal force of tropical storms and hurricanes, as Harvey laid bare last month.

The storm shut roughly a quarter of the nation's refinery capacity and more than a dozen petrochemical plants halted operations. Ports were closed and key fuel pipelines serving the Midwest and U.S. Northeast were partially or completely shut, driving up pump prices as fears of fuel shortages took hold.

Preliminary assessments suggest that storm's hit to the region is not deterring companies from going ahead with existing projects. But global commodities buyers such as Ineos Group [INEOSG.UL] and Reliance Industries Ltd that relied on existing facilities shut by the storm may now consider putting some warehouses and stock elsewhere.

"The robustness of the supply chain is brought a little more under attention," said David Witte, a senior vice president at consultants IHS Markit. "They may be looking at it differently."

Construction costs also could slow some work.

INVESTMENT PLANS

There is no sign that major new projects are under threat. Several with plans on the drawing board, including BASF SE , DowDuPont Inc and Exxon Mobil Corp are sticking to growth plans. Others said they will repair Harvey's damage before making any decisions on long-term strategy for the region.

Exxon earlier this year said it would invest $20 billion to expand Texas refining and petrochemical operations in Beaumont, Corpus Christi and Baytown. All three communities were damaged by Harvey. [nL8N1LL480]

As part of that expansion, Exxon and Saudi Basic Industries Corp <2010.SE> are proposing an about $10 billion chemical plant in Corpus Christi, near where Harvey made landfall. The project is moving forward, according to a source familiar with the matter.

Exxon spokesman Scott Silvestri declined to comment.

DowDuPont is also undeterred from an ongoing $4 billion expansion project that includes new capacity in Freeport, Texas, on the coast. "Hurricane Harvey does not change our perspective on the region being a great location for our investments," spokeswoman Rachelle Schikorra said in a statement.

Royal Dutch Shell Plc , which is expanding its operations in the Gulf, also has proposed new investments in western Pennsylvania, near the natural gas-rich Marcellus formation.

The plant will help Shell capture a larger share of the U.S. market for polyethylene, more than half of which is concentrated in northern states. It took Shell years to make the decision to build the plant.

Pennsylvania has started to position itself as a second U.S. refining region, even though new plants are years away from opening. The state lacks the specialized refining workforce and proximity to open water - and the Panama Canal - that make the Gulf Coast area still so appealing.

The U.S. Gulf Coast will remain an attractive investment area, said Shell spokesman Curtis Smith and other energy officials.

"What this storm has demonstrated is the resilience of the energy system," said Torgrim Reitan, who runs Statoil ASA's U.S. operations. "Even a Harvey can't take out this capacity."

REFILE-Harvey may pinch some Gulf Coast refining, chemical projects  - Reuters News

{{20170908T214737.938+0000}}REFILE-Harvey may pinch some Gulf Coast refining, chemical projects (Corrects spelling of compete in second paragraph)

By Jarrett Renshaw and Ernest Scheyder

NEW YORK/HOUSTON, Sept 8 (Reuters) - Oil and petrochemical plants along the U.S. Gulf Coast intend to go ahead with plans for near record spending on expansions next year, despite Hurricane Harvey driving up labor costs and slowing work, experts said.

Harvey largely spared oil and petrochemical plants along the U.S. Gulf Coast from significant damage but thousands of homes and businesses were not as fortunate. Refiners and recovery projects will compete for the same labor, driving up costs or causing labor shortages.

Industrial investment in the Gulf Coast is expected to hit $51.9 billion next year, near the 2015 peak, requiring an army of pipefitters, ironworkers and other craftsman, said Industrial Information Resources (IIR), which tracks labor supply for refiners and other industrial companies.

"We had a labor shortage before Harvey, but now it's significantly worse," said IIR's Anthony Salemme. "It's going to spread to soft crafts like painters and insulators."

Investments have soared in recent years because the shale revolution fed off an existing infrastructure. The region's deep water ports and expanding pipeline and storage networks offer an easy outlet to global markets. It also boasts a welcoming regulatory climate and skilled workforce.

Since 2010, $85 billion worth of petrochemical projects have started or been completed across the United States, nearly all of them in the Gulf Coast region, according to the American Chemistry Council.

But the concentration along the Gulf of Mexico leaves these facilities and supporting networks exposed to the brutal force of tropical storms and hurricanes, as Harvey laid bare last month.

The storm shut roughly a quarter of the nation's refinery capacity and more than a dozen petrochemical plants halted operations. Ports were closed and key fuel pipelines serving the Midwest and U.S. Northeast were partially or completely shut, driving up pump prices as fears of fuel shortages took hold.

Preliminary assessments suggest that storm's hit to the region is not deterring companies from going ahead with existing projects. But global commodities buyers such as Ineos Group [INEOSG.UL] and Reliance Industries Ltd that relied on existing facilities shut by the storm may now consider putting some warehouses and stock elsewhere.

"The robustness of the supply chain is brought a little more under attention," said David Witte, a senior vice president at consultants IHS Markit. "They may be looking at it differently."

Construction costs also could slow some work.

INVESTMENT PLANS

There is no sign that major new projects are under threat. Several with plans on the drawing board, including BASF SE , DowDuPont Inc and Exxon Mobil Corp are sticking to growth plans. Others said they will repair Harvey's damage before making any decisions on long-term strategy for the region.

Exxon earlier this year said it would invest $20 billion to expand Texas refining and petrochemical operations in Beaumont, Corpus Christi and Baytown. All three communities were damaged by Harvey. [nL8N1LL480]

As part of that expansion, Exxon and Saudi Basic Industries Corp <2010.SE> are proposing an about $10 billion chemical plant in Corpus Christi, near where Harvey made landfall. The project is moving forward, according to a source familiar with the matter.

Exxon spokesman Scott Silvestri declined to comment.

DowDuPont is also undeterred from an ongoing $4 billion expansion project that includes new capacity in Freeport, Texas, on the coast. "Hurricane Harvey does not change our perspective on the region being a great location for our investments," spokeswoman Rachelle Schikorra said in a statement.

Royal Dutch Shell Plc , which is expanding its operations in the Gulf, also has proposed new investments in western Pennsylvania, near the natural gas-rich Marcellus formation.

The plant will help Shell capture a larger share of the U.S. market for polyethylene, more than half of which is concentrated in northern states. It took Shell years to make the decision to build the plant.

Pennsylvania has started to position itself as a second U.S. refining region, even though new plants are years away from opening. The state lacks the specialized refining workforce and proximity to open water - and the Panama Canal - that make the Gulf Coast area still so appealing.

The U.S. Gulf Coast will remain an attractive investment area, said Shell spokesman Curtis Smith and other energy officials.

"What this storm has demonstrated is the resilience of the energy system," said Torgrim Reitan, who runs Statoil ASA's U.S. operations. "Even a Harvey can't take out this capacity."

UPDATE 1-Exxon Beaumont refinery may remain shut until first week of Oct –sources - 路透新闻

{{20170908T184129.600+0000}}UPDATE 1-Exxon Beaumont refinery may remain shut until first week of Oct –sources(Adds more details, Exxon statement)

HOUSTON, Sept 8 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp's 362,300-barrel-per-day (bpd) Beaumont, Texas, refinery may remain closed until the first week of October as it recovers from Hurricane Harvey, sources familiar with plant operations said on Friday.

Exxon, in a statement to Reuters, said the company is "preparing to begin restart activities" at the refinery.

The refinery was shut on Aug. 30 as Harvey drenched southeast Texas. Exxon has said the lower portion of the refinery flooded because of the heavy rain.

More than 4.4 million barrels of U.S. daily refining capacity - about a quarter of what the nation can produce - was shut in as a result of Harvey, which reached land on Aug. 25 and deluged the Texas coast with several feet of rain. Most of the refineries shut are currently in the restarting process.

EXCLUSIVE-BP's stake in giant Azeri oilfields set to fall -sources - Reuters News

{{20170908T140550.386+0000}}EXCLUSIVE-BP's stake in giant Azeri oilfields set to fall -sourcesBy Margarita Antidze

TBILISI/BAKU, Sept 8 (Reuters) - BP's stake in Azerbaijan's vast oilfields is expected to shrink under a new production-sharing agreement with state energy company SOCAR, two industry sources familiar with the talks told Reuters.

Azerbaijan plans to sign a new contract with BP next week on development of the giant Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli (ACG) oilfields that will run until 2050.

The fields are the largest oilfields in the Azerbaijan sector of the Caspian basin.

An existing deal is due to expire in 2024 and a BP-led consortium and SOCAR signed a letter of intent in December to continue development of the oilfields until 2050 in a move to unlock billions of dollars of fresh investment.

"According to preliminary information, SOCAR will increase its share at the expense of a share reduction of other companies, including BP," an industry source aware of the negotiations told Reuters.

Another industry source, who also is familiar with the talks and did not want to be identified, said SOCAR's share could increase to 20 percent from the current 11.6 percent while BP's share could fall to 30 percent from 35.8 percent.

"The shares of some other companies might be also reduced," the source said. The figures in the final contract might still change, the source said.

A spokeswoman for BP in Azerbaijan said: "We don't have information on the content of the contract now."

A SOCAR spokesman said the company had no immediate comment.

The shareholders in the consortium include BP, SOCAR, Chevron , INPEX <1605.T>, Statoil , ExxonMobil , TPAO, ITOCHU <8001.T> and ONGC Videsh .

The sources said that BP would remain the project operator, although some of its existing rights might be delegated to SOCAR.

BP came under fire from Azeri President Ilham Aliyev earlier this decade for lower than promised output.

Oil output at ACG totalled 14 million tonnes in the first half of 2017, or 585,000 barrels per day, down from 16 million tonnes a year earlier.

Indigenous Mapuche thwart Argentina shale development - Reuters News

{{20170908T140002.272+0000}}Indigenous Mapuche thwart Argentina shale developmentBy Juliana Castilla

BUENOS AIRES, Sept 8 (Reuters) - Indigenous Mapuche communities demanding cash payments and blocking oil wells in Argentina's Vaca Muerta area are threatening the long delayed development of the world's second-largest shale fields, oil companies say.

Since the beginning of the year the Mapuche have cut off access to 14 wells in the Loma de la Lata field, one of only two shale fields currently producing in the Belgium-sized Vaca Muerta area, state-run YPF said in an e-mailed statement.

YPF , Argentina's largest oil company, spent 55 million pesos ($3 million) on payments to a Kaxipayiñ Mapuche community leader last year, more than double the payments in 2014, a company source said.

The conflict is intensifying as President Mauricio Macri prioritizes attracting energy investment to develop the area and end Argentina's reliance on imported energy.

"It affects us a lot," YPF Chairman Miguel Gutierrez said of the Mapuche conflict in a recent interview. "It's a situation that has been developing for many years and now it must be resolved."

A private oil company source who was not authorized to speak on the record said Mapuche communities are eyeing a greater share of the expected boom in the form of cash payments.

Companies including Exxon Mobil Corp , France's Total SA , BP PLC unit Pan American Energy LLC and Royal Dutch Shell PLC have announced investments in Vaca Muerta in recent months.

Part of Loma de la Lata field is on government-recognized Mapuche territory. Argentine law gives companies the right to extract natural resources found beneath private property, and the state compensates the owner for use of the land.

Kaxipayiñ Mapuche leader Gabriel Cherqui says his people are not opposed to drilling and only want YPF to clean up pollution.

"Imagine you find yourself overnight with 10 drilling towers in the yard of your house and you see them throwing polluted water on either side and breaking everything," he said in an interview, adding that members of his community have cancer and seen the number of abortions rise.

YPF denies polluting, though it admits there is contamination in the area from oil operations some 25 years ago. In a statement YPF said the Kaxipayiñ community has blocked cleanup efforts "and pursues interests that have nothing to do with the environment."

The private company source said the Mapuche also demand companies hire certain private contractors that charge more than the market rate. Cherqui could not be reached to respond to that point.

The Argentine government's relationship with the broader Mapuche community has grown tense in recent weeks as human rights groups accuse federal security forces in the disappearance of a man from a Mapuche rights protest in the Patagonian province of Chubut. He has not been seen for over a month, spurring nationwide protests. The government says it is investigating. [nL1N1KX1DA]

YPF's Gutierrez said companies had called on the provincial government of Neuquen, where Loma de la Lata is located, to mediate a solution. Companies had previously negotiated access to wells directly with the Mapuche. The Neuquen government did not respond the request for comment.

"What we have to achieve is a protocol to follow and all the parties know: the Mapuches, the industry and regulatory authorities," he said.

"We are starting a ramping up of development in Vaca Muerta. There is a great opportunity and we have to standardize this type of dialogue."

INSIGHT-The next oil major? Service firm Schlumberger's big bet on production - Reuters News

{{20170908T050004.131+0000}}INSIGHT-The next oil major? Service firm Schlumberger's big bet on productionBy Liz Hampton

HOUSTON, Sept 8 (Reuters) - The world's largest oilfield services company, Schlumberger NV , is spending billions of dollars buying stakes in its customers' oil and gas projects - investing in the same ventures it supplies with equipment and expertise.

The new business model gives Schlumberger a say in drilling decisions, oilfield management and even on hiring other Schlumberger units for service contracts, the company has told investors.

The expanded operational authority saves Schlumberger from bidding for each of the many jobs that typically require separate contracts on a large drilling project - effectively locking out the firm's competitors.

Schlumberger's gamble could upend the service business model throughout the industry, as rivals including General Electric Co's unit Baker Hughes say they are considering whether to adopt similar strategies.

The model can supercharge profits on a given job but also ramps up risk, giving the firm more exposure to global oil price swings and potentially big losses if individual projects fail. The downsides have some analysts questioning whether the traditionally conservative firm is taking on too many speculative projects too quickly.

Schlumberger already has taken hundreds of millions in write-downs or impairments on some of these joint ventures, according to its financial filings.

Traditionally, oil producers manage the risk and make the financial and operational decisions on projects; they pay service providers a fee to carry out individual jobs. Firms such as Schlumberger typically supply a wide variety of services, such as well design, along with technology and staff to run rigs.

Schlumberger declined to make executives available for interviews and did not respond to written questions about its production business.

Despite early setbacks, Schlumberger has committed cash to growing the division, called Schlumberger Production Management, since its launch in 2011. Last year, it generated $1.4 billion in revenue. It had investment of $2.6 billion as of June 30, Schlumberger Executive Vice President Patrick Schorn told investors earlier this summer.

The company's investments have the firm co-managing about 230,000 barrels a day of oil and gas output at the end of 2016 - about as much as one of the largest U.S. independent producers, Pioneer Natural Resources .

This year, the company stepped up the financing role, opening a standalone investment fund to provide financing for the ventures. The company has not disclosed the size of the fund.

Such ventures require a breadth of skills and a tolerance for risk generally found at large integrated oil companies such as Chevron Corp and Exxon Mobil Corp .

Two of Schlumberger's newest partnerships - a deepwater liquefied natural gas project off the coast of Equatorial Guinea and an Argentina shale development with YPF SA - involve decision-making and operational authority similar to that typically held by multinational oil producers.

In June, Schlumberger agreed to invest $700 million in an oil exploration project with Nigerian National Petroleum Corp and First Exploration & Production that would require global oil prices of between $50 to $60 a barrel to achieve a 20 percent profit, research house Bernstein estimated in a report published in July. Current prices are struggling to break out of the bottom of that range.

COMPETING WITH CUSTOMERS

As Schlumberger's production business has grown, it has negotiated deals that include equity in oil and gas fields and as well as deals that give the firm payment based on oil and gas output, according to interviews with customers, partners, investors and former Schlumberger executives.

Schlumberger this year agreed to contribute $390 million for a 49 percent stake in a venture with YPF in Argentina's Vaca Muerta shale field, which has attracted international oil firms including Chevron and Royal Dutch Shell .

Schlumberger Chief Executive Paal Kibsgaard has downplayed the potential for its production business to compete with its own oil company customers.

He described the enterprise as "a new avenue for project investments alongside our customers" in remarks to investors in April.

Schorn also insisted this spring that the business is "not significantly changing the risk profile ... the biggest risk remains the cyclical nature" of the oil and gas industry.

'CAPABILITY AND CASH'

Investors say Schlumberger, which held $6.22 billion in cash and short-term investments at June 30, is strong enough to handle any increased risks and the price volatility of its investments in long-term projects.

As both project manager and service provider, Schlumberger also has an enviable level of control over operations, said Mike Breard of Dallas-based wealth management firm Hodges Capital, which invests in oilfield service companies.

"I like the long-term aspect of it – the fact that they are telling frack crews where to work, and using their own equipment more efficiently than might be used by some other operator," he said.

British-based natural gas explorer Sound Energy PLC was happy to give Schlumberger full rights to the service contracts on drilling projects in Morocco in exchange for a Schlumberger investment amounting to 27 percent of total costs, said the chief of British-based natural gas explorer.

Schlumberger will get 27.5 percent of revenue from the oil produced.

"We're smaller and entrepreneurial. Schlumberger has the technical capability and cash. That's the nature of the partnership," Sound CEO James Parsons said in an interview.

The duo has completed three wells in Morocco and plans to drill three more by year end.

"It's a $50 [million] or $60 million bet for them so far," Parsons said.

Schlumberger's appetite for these ventures is spurring rivals to consider similar financing and services deals. Baker Hughes recently agreed to provide about $10 million in financing to Twinza Oil's first offshore gas field in Papua New Guinea, supplying the cash to prove the merits of the field.

"It allows Twinza to have success in going out to raise financing," Baker Hughes CEO Lorenzo Simonelli said.

Baker Hughes will not take a stake in the oilfield, unlike some of Schlumberger's joint investments with producers.

RISK AND LOSS

In 2014 and 2015, Schlumberger took nearly $400 million in combined write-offs on oil production investments, including an Eagle Ford shale field in south Texas that struggled after oil prices crashed.

It also is owed about $900 million by Ecuador. In July, the South American country said it had negotiated a payment plan that includes an expanded contract that has Schlumberger agreeing to invest another $1 billion in the venture.

Schlumberger hasn't commented on the South American nation's disclosure. It previously acknowledged taking Ecuadorian bonds in lieu of cash for $150 million in bills. It also previously estimated its investment in the projects at up to $4.9 billion over 20 years.

The write downs have stirred some on Wall Street to question whether Schlumberger should take more conservative path with its oil production partnerships.

The firm's production division "used to focus on production management of well understood low-risk oil fields," said Colin Davies, a Bernstein oilfield services analyst. "Now it has expanded into frankly somewhat more speculative ventures."

Exxon, other refiners buy fuel as plants recover slowly from Harvey - Reuters News

{{20170907T230624.729+0000}}Exxon, other refiners buy fuel as plants recover slowly from HarveyBy Devika Krishna Kumar and Jessica Resnick-Ault

Sept 7 (Reuters) - Refiners including Exxon Mobil Corp and Motiva Enterprises purchased fuel on Thursday to compensate for lost output from plants that have been shut since Hurricane Harvey hit the U.S. Gulf Coast last month, traders said.

Refiners typically sell fuel, rather than buy it. The purchases sparked concern in the market that Harvey may have inflicted damage on refineries that will take time to repair. That pushed up prices on Gulf Coast physical markets by about 5 cents a gallon, five traders familiar with the deals said.

The surge in buying also came as refiners scrambled to meet the deadline to ship on Colonial Pipeline, the largest line in the country, during the five-day period through Thursday.

Harvey dumped a record amount of rain on refineries in Texas, the heart of the U.S. energy industry. The shutdowns have cut millions of barrels of fuel supplies from the world's largest oil consumer, pushing up prices for gasoline, diesel and jet fuel across the country.

Refiners in the Gulf are still assessing the impact of flooding on their plants and would have avoided buying fuel if they could have supplied their customers themselves, traders said.

Until Thursday, refiners in the Gulf had only fleetingly bought cargoes in the physical markets since Harvey, traders said.

The refiners will ship the fuel through Colonial Pipeline, the main transit route for fuel produced in the Gulf destined for gas stations in cities along the U.S. East Coast such as New York.

Colonial restarted sections of its main gasoline and distillate lines in Texas earlier this week after a partial shutdown when supplies from Gulf refiners dwindled and floods prevented refiners from loading fuel into the line. [nENN0UWJ8L]

It is unclear how much fuel is moving through the line currently, because Colonial does not disclose volumes shipped. [nENN0UWJ8L]

Without the purchases, refiners may have struggled to meet commitments to their branded stores along the East Coast, traders said.

Even as refiners struggle to plug supply gaps related to Harvey, new shortages have emerged in the U.S. Southeast as Hurricane Irma disrupted deliveries there. [nL2N1LO119]

SHUTDOWNS

The two largest refineries in the country were both shut down by Harvey and are projected to partially restart by next week.

Motiva aims to have the nation's largest refinery running at 40 percent of capacity by Monday, the company said on Thursday. The plant, at Port Arthur in Texas, has capacity of 603,000 barrels per day (bpd).

Exxon's 560,500 bpd Baytown, Texas, refinery, the second largest, may restart partial production by early next week, sources said. [nL2N1LO0NU] [nL2N1LN2O6]

A second large Exxon plant is also shut at Beaumont in Texas. The two plants combined can process about 920,000 bpd.

Exxon said on Thursday it was completing minor repairs at Baytown and sources said the company is restarting utilities at Beaumont. [nFWN1LO0QB] [nL2N1LN2KD]

Exxon is working to ensure customers are well supplied with gasoline, a spokeswoman said. She did not comment on specific fuel purchases. Motiva declined to comment on trading activity.

Harvey shut about 4.4 million barrels per day (bpd) of refining capacity, nearly 24 percent of the U.S. total.

As of Thursday, at least 1 million barrels were still shut, with another 3 million barrels of capacity in the process of restarting or running at reduced rates. [nL8N1LL480]

The storm also shut down oil ports and the Houston Ship Channel, one of the main routes for waterborne supplies from refineries. [nFWN1LG0RL]

The rise in cash gasoline prices reversed falls earlier this week as some plants began restarting.

Conventional gasoline rose 4.50 cents a gallon to trade at a 18 cent-per-gallon premium to benchmark U.S. gasoline futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange , traders said. Benchmark futures ended the session 0.7 percent lower at $1.6610 a gallon.

The most actively traded Gulf coast gasoline grade is A2 CBOB. Prices for that grade jumped 5 cents to trade 18 cents above the benchmark.

FACTBOX-U.S. Gulf Coast energy infrastructure shut due to Harvey - 路透新闻

{{20170907T173540.526+0000}}FACTBOX-U.S. Gulf Coast energy infrastructure shut due to HarveySept 7 (Reuters) - Gulf Coast facilities were slowly recovering from the
devastating effects of Hurricane Harvey, which hammered Louisiana and Texas for
several days, shutting key infrastructure in the heart of the U.S. oil and
natural gas industry.

Several refineries, offshore platforms and portions of key pipelines had
resumed operations as of Wednesday, after the storm knocked out roughly 4.4
million barrels per day (bpd) of refining capacity, or nearly 24 percent of
total U.S. capacity, and about one-quarter of Gulf oil and natural gas
production. [nL2N1LE12X]

As of Thursday, about 3.8 million barrels of daily refining capacity, or
about 20 percent, was shut in, though a number of the refineries in that group
were in the process of restarting. Several others, including Marathon Petroleum
Corp's  Galveston Bay and Citgo's Corpus Christi refineries, were running
at reduced rates, according to company reports and Reuters estimates.

Motiva Enterprises said it could return to 40 percent production at its Port
Arthur, Texas, refinery, the nation's largest with capacity of 603,000 barrels a
day, by the end of this weekend. Motiva has restarted its large crude unit, but
is waiting on the restoration of shipping and pipelines to begin production,
sources said on Thursday. [nL2N1LO0NU]

Overall refining runs dropped sharply as a result of the storm. The U.S.
Energy Department said for the week to Sept. 1, crude refining inputs for the
Gulf region fell to 6 million barrels a day, the lowest weekly figure for the
Gulf since data was first recorded in 1992. [nL2N1LO11N]

Grèce-Total attend le vote du Parlement sur son projet d'exploration - Reuters (French)

{{20170907T160504.895+0000}}Grèce-Total attend le vote du Parlement sur son projet d'explorationpar Angeliki Koutantou

ATHÈNES, 7 septembre (Reuters) - Total s'attend à obtenir d'ici la fin de l'année le feu vert du Parlement grec en vue de l'exploration pétrolière de la côte occidentale du pays, a déclaré le président directeur général du groupe français.

La Grèce et un consortium composé de Total, du groupe italien Edison et d'Hellenic Petroleum ont signé un protocole d'accord pour prospecter du pétrole et du gaz en mer Ionienne à la suite d'importantes découvertes de gaz en Méditerranée orientale.

"Nous prévoyons la ratification de l'accord par le Parlement grec d'ici la fin de l'année", a déclaré au quotidien Ta Nea Patrick Pouyanné.

Le président Emmanuel Macron, accompagné de plusieurs dirigeants de groupes français, dont Total, effectue ce jeudi une visite de deux jours en Grèce. [nL8N1LO3AZ]

L'exploration nécessite en général des études sismiques afin de déterminer l'emplacement et le volume des réserves de pétrole et de gaz éventuelle avant le début du forage.

Encouragé par les importantes découvertes de gaz au large de l'Egypte et d'Israël, Total a exprimé un grand intérêt pour les blocs méditerranéens et procède actuellement à des forages au large de Chypre.

Dans un autre consortium formé avec Exxon Mobil et Hellenic Petroleum, le groupe français a également exprimé son intérêt pour la prospection de deux sites au large de la Crète, amenant ainsi la Grèce a lancer un appel d'offres. [nL8N1IX3X2]

Par ailleurs le groupe français Vinci , qui détient des participations dans deux grands concessionnaires autoroutiers grecs et exploite l'un des plus grands ponts à haubans du monde, envisage également de participer à de nouveaux projets de concessions dans le pays.

Dans le quotidien Ta Nea, le responsable du département concessions de Vinci, Nicolas Notebaert, déclare que le groupe français est intéressé par le bail à long terme de l'autoroute Egnatia, qui traverse la Grèce d'est en ouest.

Dans le cadre de son plan de sauvetage qui comprend notamment des privatisations, la Grèce prévoit de lancer un appel d'offres sur Egnatia à la fin de l'année.

Vinci et Alstom se sont également associés à des entreprises grecques en vue de participer à un appel d'offres sur l'extension du métro d'Athènes.

Le président Emmanuel Macron et le Premier ministre grec Alexis Tsipras ont également convenu de développer la coopération dans les nouvelles technologies, le tourisme, les infrastructures et la défense.

Le gouvernement grec signera ainsi vendredi avec la banque d'investissement publique Bpifrance un protocole d'accord.

UPDATE 1-Kazakhstan may strike separate deal with OPEC on oil output curbs - Reuters News

{{20170907T132425.316+0000}}UPDATE 1-Kazakhstan may strike separate deal with OPEC on oil output curbs(Writes through with comments on OPEC discussions)

By Mariya Gordeyeva

ASTANA, Sept 7 (Reuters) - Kazakhstan is aiming for a standalone deal with leading global oil producers on restraining its crude production due to a need to crank up output at its Kashagan field, a Kazakh official said on Thursday.

The Central Asian nation increased oil and gas condensate output by 9.9 percent in January-July to 49.907 million tonnes, or 1.724 million barrels per day (bpd), exceeding its quota of 1.7 million bpd under a global supply pact.

Kazakhstan has said it needs to adjust the terms of the deal as it expects to boost output later this year thanks to the giant Kashagan field. [nR4N1IZ050]

On Thursday, Deputy Energy Minister Aset Magauov said his country needed to repay the shareholders in Kashagan, where output had been delayed for years before it was relaunched last year.

"I think that talks on Kazakhstan's commitments will continue separately," Magauov told reporters.

"There is understanding from OPEC that the project (Kashagan) is very large, there have been huge investments and there is a need to return these investments to shareholders."

He said Kashagan, with investments of around $55 billion, was expected to produce 13 million tonnes next year (260,000 bpd), while other oil projects in the country could see their output reduced.

Kashagan has been developed by a consortium of China National Petroleum Corp [CNPET.UL], Exxon Mobil , Eni , Royal Dutch Shell , Total , Inpex <1605.T> and KazMunaiGas .

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other producers, including Russia and Kazakhstan, agreed to cut output from January this year until the end of March 2018 to reduce global inventories and support oil prices.

UPDATE 1-Exxon CEO says making progress restarting refinery in Texas -CNBC - Reuters News

{{20170907T122358.642+0000}}UPDATE 1-Exxon CEO says making progress restarting refinery in Texas -CNBC(Adds details on Exxon's post-Harvey plans)

Sept 7 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp is making good progress as it restarts operations at its Baytown, Texas refinery following Hurricane Harvey, Chief Executive Darren Woods told CNBC.

The world's largest publicly traded oil producer on Sunday restarted operations at the 560,500-barrel-per-day refinery - the nation's second-largest.

"It's very difficult to predict exactly when all those units will be back up and we'll be back on our full load. But we're making good progress. We're hoping to get some units started up later this week, and then it will be one unit after another," Woods said.

Exxon has not yet assessed Harvey's impact on third quarter earnings, Woods told the TV channel.

Harvey tore through Corpus Christi in southern Texas on Aug. 25 and then drenched the Houston area with historic rains, knocking out nearly a fifth of U.S. oil-refining capacity. Oil companies are now bracing for Hurricane Irma, one of the most powerful Atlantic storms in a century. [nL2N1LF0UJ]

Irma has not impacted any of the oil major's offshore Gulf of Mexico operations yet, Woods said.

Part of Exxon's Harvey response team has been tasked with planning for Irma, which could make landfall in Florida this weekend, CNBC reported.

RPT-Meth, coke and oil: A drug boom in the Texas shale patch - Reuters News

{{20170907T110001.600+0000}}RPT-Meth, coke and oil: A drug boom in the Texas shale patch(Repeats for additional clients with no changes to text)

By Liz Hampton

MIDLAND, Texas, Sept 7 (Reuters) - When Joe Forsythe returned to the West Texas oilfields last year after a stint in a drug rehab facility, he figured he had beaten his addiction to methamphetamine.

The 32-year-old rig worker and equipment handler lasted about a year before relapsing.

"It's easy to get back into that mentality," said Forsythe, of Midland, Texas, who said he no longer uses drugs after several stints in rehab since 2015. "I'd work 24 hours ... I was just plagued with fatigue and needed something to improve my work ethic."

Forsythe's experience and others like it reflect a painful flipside of the nation's shale oil boom - a parallel increase in substance abuse, drug crime and related social ills.

While drug use is a problem among industrial workers nationwide, it raises particular concern in the oil patch as U.S. production surges to record levels in what is already one of the nation's most dangerous sectors - with a fatality rate about three times the average for other industries, according to 2015 federal statistics.

Drug use is a significant factor in workplace injuries and crimes involving oilfield workers, according to drug counselors, hospital and police officials and court records in West Texas, the epicenter of the U.S. shale sector.

As the shale revolution has spawned waves of hiring here since 2010, law enforcement authorities have tracked a boom in drug trafficking and related crime. In Midland and Ector counties, home to many Permian Basin oil workers, state and local police in 2016 seized more than 95 pounds of methamphetamine - up from less than four pounds in 2010.

Meth and cocaine are stimulants of choice in the oil patch to get though long oilfield shifts, but alcohol and pain killers such as opioids are also widely abused - often to soften the crash after taking stimulants, drug addicts and counselors said.

Drug charges in the industry town of Midland more than doubled between 2012 and 2016, to 942 from 491, according to police data. In neighboring Odessa, total drug arrests doubled between 2010 and 2016, to 1291 from 756, according to Odessa Police Department data.

The increase in drug crime stretched through two boom periods in the West Texas oil patch, before and after a crude price crash that hit in 2014.

Oil companies typically drug test job applicants and often conduct additional random tests on employees. For truck drivers and those involved with hazardous materials, tests are also conducted under federal programs run by the U.S. Department of Transportation.

Several oil firms with major operations in the Permian Basin declined to discuss how they handle drugs in the oil patch or did not respond to inquiries.

Schlumberger NV , Halliburton Co and Exxon Mobil Corp declined to comment. Exxon referred Reuters to its alcohol and drug policy.

Pioneer Natural Resources Co. and ConocoPhillips did not respond to requests for comment.

The American Petroleum Institute, an industry trade group, declined to comment.

LONG HOURS - ON METH

Despite corporate and regulatory efforts to curb drug abuse, many oilfield workers regularly use stimulants on long shifts of grueling work for relatively high pay, said drug counselors, local law enforcement officials and oil field workers recovering from addictions.

More than a third of clients at Midland's Springboard drug rehabilitation center are currently involved in the oil and gas industry, said Executive Director Steve Thomason.

Rising oil prices have brought more admissions for methamphetamine abuse, Thomason said.

"People say they can work on it for 24 hours straight," he said.

Long shifts are common in the oil industry because expensive drilling equipment, often leased at high daily rates, runs through the night, and workers often have to commute to wells in remote locations. Most oil producers subcontract oilfield services to smaller companies that are not unionized.

Springboard's admissions of methamphetamine users went up 20 percent in the first six months of this year compared with the last half of 2016, he said. The number of rigs operating in the Permian Basin increased more than 38 percent during the same period, according to data from energy services firm Baker Hughes .

Corporal Steve LeSueur, a spokesman for the Odessa police, said the influx of drugs in the oil patch is stretching police resources.

"The jail has been full," he said. "A lot of crimes that are committed are drug-related – simple property crimes, forgeries to feed their drug habits."

METH AND MURDER

Some offenses are more severe.

In 2016, Shawn Pinson, an employee of a well construction company, was convicted of murdering an acquaintance following a drug-related dispute.

The murder occurred around the same time he was arrested for possession of methamphetamine, police records show. The victim tested positive for meth at the time of the murder, according to an autopsy.

At his trial, witnesses close to Pinson testified he had become addicted to methamphetamine while working in the oilfield, according to a prosecutor and a defense attorney involved in the case.

Pinson did not respond to a letter seeking comment and his current attorney, Michele Greene, did not respond to a request for comment.

When oil jobs are plentiful, companies desperate for labor sometimes will disregard signs of substance abuse, said three recovering drug addicts who worked in the oilfield.

"These oilfield bosses - they party, too," Forsythe said. "As long as you're getting the job done and not making a scene, they won't drug test you."

One recovering addict, who declined to use his name because he still works in the industry, said he was often high during long-haul trips driving trucks transporting oil.

"I could do a little coke and speed and it would give me the extra stretch," he said. "It ended up running me to the ground."

ATENE, 7 settembre (Reuters) - Total si aspetta che entro fine anno il parlamanto ellenico dia via libera alle esplorazioni di greggio offshore al largo della costa occidentale.

Lo dice l'AD in un'intervista a un quotidiano ellenico.

Atene e un consorzio composto da Total, Edison ed Hellenic Petroleum hanno siglato un contratto per la concessione di uno sfruttamento di greggio e gas nel Mar Ionio.

"Prevediamo che l'accordo venga ratificato dal parlamento greco entro fine anno, in modo da iniziare a lavorare" spiega Patrick Pouyanne a 'Ta New'.

Tra oggi e domani i vertici di Total e altre società francesi sono in visita ad Atene insieme a Emmanuel Macron.

Putin rues awarding U.S. top diplomat Tillerson Russian state honour - Reuters News

{{20170907T084936.092+0000}}Putin rues awarding U.S. top diplomat Tillerson Russian state honourVLADIVOSTOK, Russia, Sept 7 (Reuters) - Vladimir Putin took a jab at Rex Tillerson on Thursday, joking that the U.S. Secretary of State had "fallen in with the wrong company" since he had awarded him a Russian state honour for his contribution to Russian-U.S. relations.

Hopes of detente in Moscow's relations with Washington under Donald Trump, who had praised President Putin before winning the White House, have faded as the countries have imposed sanctions and expelled diplomats in recent months.

Addressing a U.S. citizen at a plenary session of an economic forum in the far eastern city of Vladivostok, Putin said: "We awarded your compatriot Mr. Tillerson the Order of Friendship, but he seems to have fallen in with the wrong company and to be steering in the other direction."

"I hope that the wind of cooperation, friendship and reciprocity will eventually put him on the right path," Putin added, drawing cheers from the crowd.

In 2013 Putin awarded Tillerson, then CEO of energy giant Exxon Mobil , the Order of Friendship, a Russian state honour, for his "significant contribution to strengthening cooperation in the energy sector".

Russia's relations with the United States deteriorated over its annexation of the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea in 2014 and support for pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine, prompting Washington to impose economic sanctions against Moscow.

The Kremlin, which has denied U.S. allegations it meddled in the presidential vote, had heaped praise on Trump during his election campaign, saying it supported efforts to improve Russian-American relations.

But Trump, who was faced scrutiny over the alleged ties of his entourage with Russia, reluctantly signed into law fresh sanctions against Moscow, further straining relations.

Meth, coke and oil: A drug boom in the Texas shale patch - Reuters News

{{20170907T084646.634+0000}}Meth, coke and oil: A drug boom in the Texas shale patchBy Liz Hampton

MIDLAND, Texas, Sept 7 (Reuters) - When Joe Forsythe returned to the West Texas oilfields last year after a stint in a drug rehab facility, he figured he had beaten his addiction to methamphetamine.

The 32-year-old rig worker and equipment handler lasted about a year before relapsing.

"It's easy to get back into that mentality," said Forsythe, of Midland, Texas, who said he no longer uses drugs after several stints in rehab since 2015. "I'd work 24 hours ... I was just plagued with fatigue and needed something to improve my work ethic."

Forsythe's experience and others like it reflect a painful flipside of the nation's shale oil boom - a parallel increase in substance abuse, drug crime and related social ills.

While drug use is a problem among industrial workers nationwide, it raises particular concern in the oil patch as U.S. production surges to record levels in what is already one of the nation's most dangerous sectors - with a fatality rate about three times the average for other industries, according to 2015 federal statistics.

Drug use is a significant factor in workplace injuries and crimes involving oilfield workers, according to drug counselors, hospital and police officials and court records in West Texas, the epicenter of the U.S. shale sector.

As the shale revolution has spawned waves of hiring here since 2010, law enforcement authorities have tracked a boom in drug trafficking and related crime. In Midland and Ector counties, home to many Permian Basin oil workers, state and local police in 2016 seized more than 95 pounds of methamphetamine - up from less than four pounds in 2010.

Meth and cocaine are stimulants of choice in the oil patch to get though long oilfield shifts, but alcohol and pain killers such as opioids are also widely abused - often to soften the crash after taking stimulants, drug addicts and counselors said.

Drug charges in the industry town of Midland more than doubled between 2012 and 2016, to 942 from 491, according to police data. In neighboring Odessa, total drug arrests doubled between 2010 and 2016, to 1291 from 756, according to Odessa Police Department data.

The increase in drug crime stretched through two boom periods in the West Texas oil patch, before and after a crude price crash that hit in 2014.

Oil companies typically drug test job applicants and often conduct additional random tests on employees. For truck drivers and those involved with hazardous materials, tests are also conducted under federal programs run by the U.S. Department of Transportation.

Several oil firms with major operations in the Permian Basin declined to discuss how they handle drugs in the oil patch or did not respond to inquiries.

Schlumberger NV , Halliburton Co and Exxon Mobil Corp declined to comment. Exxon referred Reuters to its alcohol and drug policy.

Pioneer Natural Resources Co. and ConocoPhillips did not respond to requests for comment.

The American Petroleum Institute, an industry trade group, declined to comment.

LONG HOURS - ON METH

Despite corporate and regulatory efforts to curb drug abuse, many oilfield workers regularly use stimulants on long shifts of grueling work for relatively high pay, said drug counselors, local law enforcement officials and oil field workers recovering from addictions.

More than a third of clients at Midland's Springboard drug rehabilitation center are currently involved in the oil and gas industry, said Executive Director Steve Thomason.

Rising oil prices have brought more admissions for methamphetamine abuse, Thomason said.

"People say they can work on it for 24 hours straight," he said.

Long shifts are common in the oil industry because expensive drilling equipment, often leased at high daily rates, runs through the night, and workers often have to commute to wells in remote locations. Most oil producers subcontract oilfield services to smaller companies that are not unionized.

Springboard's admissions of methamphetamine users went up 20 percent in the first six months of this year compared with the last half of 2016, he said. The number of rigs operating in the Permian Basin increased more than 38 percent during the same period, according to data from energy services firm Baker Hughes .

Corporal Steve LeSueur, a spokesman for the Odessa police, said the influx of drugs in the oil patch is stretching police resources.

"The jail has been full," he said. "A lot of crimes that are committed are drug-related – simple property crimes, forgeries to feed their drug habits."

METH AND MURDER

Some offenses are more severe.

In 2016, Shawn Pinson, an employee of a well construction company, was convicted of murdering an acquaintance following a drug-related dispute.

The murder occurred around the same time he was arrested for possession of methamphetamine, police records show. The victim tested positive for meth at the time of the murder, according to an autopsy.

At his trial, witnesses close to Pinson testified he had become addicted to methamphetamine while working in the oilfield, according to a prosecutor and a defense attorney involved in the case.

Pinson did not respond to a letter seeking comment and his current attorney, Michele Greene, did not respond to a request for comment.

When oil jobs are plentiful, companies desperate for labor sometimes will disregard signs of substance abuse, said three recovering drug addicts who worked in the oilfield.

"These oilfield bosses - they party, too," Forsythe said. "As long as you're getting the job done and not making a scene, they won't drug test you."

One recovering addict, who declined to use his name because he still works in the industry, said he was often high during long-haul trips driving trucks transporting oil.

"I could do a little coke and speed and it would give me the extra stretch," he said. "It ended up running me to the ground."

Russia's Putin says row with Exxon over Sakhalin-1 is resolved - Reuters News

{{20170907T070118.976+0000}}Russia's Putin says row with Exxon over Sakhalin-1 is resolvedVLADIVOSTOK, Russia, Sept 7 (Reuters) - A dispute with U.S. major ExxonMobil over the Sakhalin-1 oil and gas project has been resolved, Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday.

Speaking at a conference in the Russian Pacific port city of Vladivostok, he said that the government will soon announce the decision.

Exxon has been in talks with Russian gas giant Gazprom for years over gas sales from Sakhalin-1. Gazprom has a monopoly on gas exports via pipeline from Russia.

Exxon also lodged a claim with a court of arbitration in Stockholm in 2015 seeking the return of $637 million which it said it had over-paid in taxes to the Russian exchequer.

UPDATE 1-Exxon Beaumont refinery beginning to restart utilities -sources - 路透新闻

{{20170906T221650.159+0000}}UPDATE 1-Exxon Beaumont refinery beginning to restart utilities -sources(Adds details on units restarting, units shut)

HOUSTON, Sept 6 (Reuters) - ExxonMobil Corp began restarting utilities at the 362,300 barrel per day (bpd) Beaumont, Texas, refinery on Wednesday for the first time in seven days since being shut by Hurricane Harvey, said sources familiar with plant operations.

Exxon spokeswoman Charlotte Huffaker said the Beaumont refinery remains shut due to flooding within the plant.

"Flood waters have receded substantially, and we are continuing impact assessments," Huffaker said.

Exxon is restarting units like boilers and other utilities needed in the refining process ahead of restarting production units that make motor fuels, the sources said.

Exxon said on Sunday it began restarting the polyethylene plant in the Beaumont chemical plant, which adjoins the refinery.

POINT MARCHÉS-Wall Street rebondit un peu avec le pétrole - Reuters (French)

{{20170906T210030.147+0000}}POINT MARCHÉS-Wall Street rebondit un peu avec le pétrole(Actualisé avec volumes, autres classes d'actifs et précisions)

* Le Dow a gagné 0,25%, le S&P-500 0,31% et le Nasdaq 0,28%

* Le secteur de l'énergie soutient la tendance

* Le risque géopolitique continue de peser

par Lewis Krauskopf

6 septembre (Reuters) - La Bourse de New York a légèrement rebondi mercredi dans le sillage des cours du pétrole mais elle n'a effacé qu'une partie de ses pertes de la veille en raison de la persistance des tensions géopolitiques autour de la Corée du Nord.

Wall Street a en revanche peu réagi à la publication du "livre beige" de la Réserve fédérale. Dans ce document, la Fed dit ne pas encore percevoir de signes francs d'une accélération de l'inflation aux Etats-Unis. [nL8N1LN5OA]

De même, l'annonce d'un possible accord sur un relèvement provisoire du plafond de la dette fédérale n'a eu qu'un effet modeste. [nL8N1LN5TZ]

L'indice Dow Jones <.DJI> a gagné 54,33 points (+0,25%), à 21.807,64. Le Standard & Poor's 500 <.SPX>, plus large et principale référence des investisseurs, a pris 7,69 points, soit 0,31%, à 2.465,54, au lendemain de sa plus forte baisse en pourcentage (-0,76%) depuis le 17 août. Le Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC>, à forte composante technologique, a pour sa part fini en hausse de 17,74 points (+0,28%) à 6.393,31.

Fermée lundi, la Bourse de New York a vivement réagi mardi au nouvel essai nucléaire effectué dimanche par la Corée du Nord, qui a ravivé les craintes d'un conflit avec les Etats-Unis aux conséquences incertaines.

Des indicateurs macroéconomiques publiés mercredi ont en revanche livré des signaux positifs pour l'économie américaine au troisième trimestre, avec une accélération de l'activité du secteur des services en août, selon l'indice ISM, et un déficit commercial moins élevé que prévu en juillet. [nZON013T05] [nL8N1LN40H]

"Il y a des forces opposées qui empêchent le marché de percer vers un nouveau plus haut mais les éléments fondamentaux semblent l'empêcher de s'effondrer et de déclencher un important mouvement de vente", dit Walter Todd, responsable de l'investissement chez Greenwood Capital. "Il y a ces forces opposées qui s'affrontent et qui maintiennent le marché dans une marge très étroite."

Le S&P-500 n'a ainsi fini qu'à 15 points de son record de clôture touché le 7 août.

UNITED CONTINENTAL PÉNALISÉ PAR HARVEY

Le secteur de l'énergie <.SPNY> (+1,64%) a été de loin le plus dynamique du jour, porté par des cours du pétrole en hausse avec la reprise de l'activité dans les raffineries du golfe du Mexique qui avaient été contraintes à l'arrêt par l'ouragan Harvey.

Exxon Mobil (+2,07%), qui a en outre profité d'un relèvement de recommandation par UBS, et Chevron (+2,15%) ont été les deux principaux contributeurs à la hausse du S&P-500.

Fiat Chrysler Automobiles a pris 5,54%, bénéficiant du relèvement de la recommandation de Barclays et de la hausse du secteur en Europe, porté par des espoirs de scission de l'allemand Daimler . [nL8N1LN1C6]

Gap a fini en tête du palmarès du S&P-500 avec un gain de 7,45%. Le géant américain de l'habillement a annoncé l'ouverture d'environ 70 magasins et la fermeture d'environ 200 autres jugés non performants au cours des trois prochaines années.

Wall Street a aussi apprécié l'annonce du distributeur Kohl's , qui a décidé d'ouvrir 10 grands magasins à Amazon . [nL8N1LN4Z4] Le titre Kohl's a gagné 4,9% alors qu'Amazon n'a quasiment pas varié (+0,26%).

En recul, le groupe de transport aérien United Continental a perdu 1,26% après avoir revu à la baisse sa prévision de recette unitaire par passager pour prendre en compte les perturbations provoquées par Harvey. [nL8N1LN3SH]

L'ACCORD SUR LE PLAFOND DE LA DETTE SOUTIENT LE DOLLAR

Malgré une hausse de son chiffre d'affaires trimestriel, Hewlett Packard Enterprise a cédé 1,92%, sanctionné par un abaissement de la recommandation de Bank of America Merrill Lynch.

AT&T (-1,4%) et Verizon (-0,95%) ont pour leur part souffert de l'annonce par leur concurrent T-Mobile US (+0,24%) qu'il offrirait un accès gratuit au service de vidéos en ligne Netflix (+2,71%) à ses clients disposant d'un abonnement familial.

Environ 6,3 milliards d'actions ont été échangées au cours de la séance sur les différents marchés américains, contre 5,8 milliards en moyenne sur les 20 séances précédentes.

Le dollar a faibli dans un premier temps après l'annonce du prochain départ anticipé du vice-président de la Fed, Stanley Fischer. [nL8N1LN53C] Il a cependant effacé ses pertes avec l'accord sur le plafond de la dette fédérale, pour finir quasiment inchangé face à un panier de devises de référence <.DXY> comme face à l'euro à la veille de la réunion de politique monétaire de la Banque centrale européenne (BCE).

Le rendement à 10 ans des emprunts du Trésor américain a suivi les mêmes mouvements que le dollar pour finir en hausse à 2,10%.

Valeurs refuges, le yen et l'or ont pâti de la moindre aversion au risque constatée au cours de la journée, la devise japonaise cédant près de 0,5% face au dollar et à l'euro et l'or au comptant reculant de 0,35% sous 1.334 dollars l'once.

W. Africa Crude-Offer levels steady, Sonangol sold out for Oct - 路透新闻

{{20170906T153225.351+0000}}W. Africa Crude-Offer levels steady, Sonangol sold out for OctLONDON, Sept 6 (Reuters) - Angolan state oil firm Sonangol was reported by traders on Wednesday to have sold a cargo of Gimboa, the last of its October-loading cargoes for sale, while Nigerian supply remained ample.

Offer levels for Nigerian and Angolan cargoes were steady and the focus remained on pending Indian buy tenders.

ANGOLA

* State oil company Sonangol sold a cargo of Gimboa on Monday, its last October cargo, traders said, one of which added that a U.S. buyer had bought the cargo. Price details did not emerge.

* About 12 or less Angolan crude cargoes were still available, traders said.

* Offer levels were steady. Chevron was offering Cabinda at dated Brent plus $1.10 a barrel and Total was offering Girassol at dated Brent plus $1.40.

NIGERIA

* Just over 30 October-loading cargoes were available for sale, or slightly more than half the loading programme. The number was pegged at 30 on Tuesday.

* Offers were steady. ExxonMobil was offering a late-month cargo at dated Brent plus $1.75, a trader said - 10 cents higher than an offer heard last week.

TENDERS

* The result of Indian refiner BPCL's tender to buy cargoes loading Oct. 25 to Nov. 5 had yet to emerge.

* Indian Oil Corp. is running two tenders, the results of which are expected on Thursday. The refiner is seeking a wide variety of grades, with West African sought for loading Nov. 1-10, Nov. 5-20 and Nov. 20-30.

UPDATE 2-Norway receives more bidders for mature areas oil licensing round - Reuters News

{{20170906T103019.170+0000}}UPDATE 2-Norway receives more bidders for mature areas oil licensing round* Norway hands out acreage near existing fields each year

* Applications rose to 39 this year from 33 in 2016

* Ministry received bids from a record 50 firms in 2013 round

(Adds oil minister quotes, detail)

By Nerijus Adomaitis

OSLO, Sept 6 (Reuters) - Norway's licensing round to explore for oil and gas in mature offshore areas attracted bids from 39 companies, up from 33 firms last year, the Oil and Energy Ministry said on Wednesday.

The announcement comes five days before a parliamentary election in Norway, where some opposition parties have called for scaling back exploration to reduce carbon emissions from Western Europe's top oil and gas producer.

When the so-called predefined areas (APA) licensing round was announced in May, the right-wing government expanded the areas offered near existing discoveries by 87 blocks in the Norwegian and the Barents Seas.

Norway's Oil and Energy Minister Terje Soeviknes said in a statement that increased interest in this year's APA round showed optimism was returning to the industry.

"Further exploration activity is vital to future value creation and employment," he said. "This in turn is important with reference to financing the welfare state."

Applicants included majors Shell , ConocoPhillips , Exxon Mobil and Total , as well as Norway's biggest oil and gas company Statoil .

Also on the list was Oslo-listed DNO , the biggest oil producer in the Kurdistan region of Iraq, which re-entered the Norwegian continental shelf in May after acquiring Origo Exploration.

The government plans to award licences in early 2018.

In the APA round in 2016, 29 of the 33 applicants were awarded 56 production licenses.

Mature area licensing rounds attracted the most interest in 2013, when 50 firms submitted bids, compared to 16 bids in 2005.

Norway's APA rounds were introduced in 2003 to encourage exploration near existing discoveries. Oil firms usually have between one and three years to decide whether to drill an exploration well, otherwise the production licence becomes void.

Norway holds separate licensing rounds to hand out acreage in frontier areas.

Russia's Putin says row with Exxon over Sakhalin-1 is resolved - Reuters News

{{20170907T070118.976+0000}}Russia's Putin says row with Exxon over Sakhalin-1 is resolvedVLADIVOSTOK, Russia, Sept 7 (Reuters) - A dispute with U.S. major ExxonMobil over the Sakhalin-1 oil and gas project has been resolved, Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday.

Speaking at a conference in the Russian Pacific port city of Vladivostok, he said that the government will soon announce the decision.

Exxon has been in talks with Russian gas giant Gazprom for years over gas sales from Sakhalin-1. Gazprom has a monopoly on gas exports via pipeline from Russia.

Exxon also lodged a claim with a court of arbitration in Stockholm in 2015 seeking the return of $637 million which it said it had over-paid in taxes to the Russian exchequer.

UPDATE 1-Exxon Beaumont refinery beginning to restart utilities -sources - 路透新闻

{{20170906T221650.159+0000}}UPDATE 1-Exxon Beaumont refinery beginning to restart utilities -sources(Adds details on units restarting, units shut)

HOUSTON, Sept 6 (Reuters) - ExxonMobil Corp began restarting utilities at the 362,300 barrel per day (bpd) Beaumont, Texas, refinery on Wednesday for the first time in seven days since being shut by Hurricane Harvey, said sources familiar with plant operations.

Exxon spokeswoman Charlotte Huffaker said the Beaumont refinery remains shut due to flooding within the plant.

"Flood waters have receded substantially, and we are continuing impact assessments," Huffaker said.

Exxon is restarting units like boilers and other utilities needed in the refining process ahead of restarting production units that make motor fuels, the sources said.

Exxon said on Sunday it began restarting the polyethylene plant in the Beaumont chemical plant, which adjoins the refinery.

POINT MARCHÉS-Wall Street rebondit un peu avec le pétrole - Reuters (French)

{{20170906T210030.147+0000}}POINT MARCHÉS-Wall Street rebondit un peu avec le pétrole(Actualisé avec volumes, autres classes d'actifs et précisions)

* Le Dow a gagné 0,25%, le S&P-500 0,31% et le Nasdaq 0,28%

* Le secteur de l'énergie soutient la tendance

* Le risque géopolitique continue de peser

par Lewis Krauskopf

6 septembre (Reuters) - La Bourse de New York a légèrement rebondi mercredi dans le sillage des cours du pétrole mais elle n'a effacé qu'une partie de ses pertes de la veille en raison de la persistance des tensions géopolitiques autour de la Corée du Nord.

Wall Street a en revanche peu réagi à la publication du "livre beige" de la Réserve fédérale. Dans ce document, la Fed dit ne pas encore percevoir de signes francs d'une accélération de l'inflation aux Etats-Unis. [nL8N1LN5OA]

De même, l'annonce d'un possible accord sur un relèvement provisoire du plafond de la dette fédérale n'a eu qu'un effet modeste. [nL8N1LN5TZ]

L'indice Dow Jones <.DJI> a gagné 54,33 points (+0,25%), à 21.807,64. Le Standard & Poor's 500 <.SPX>, plus large et principale référence des investisseurs, a pris 7,69 points, soit 0,31%, à 2.465,54, au lendemain de sa plus forte baisse en pourcentage (-0,76%) depuis le 17 août. Le Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC>, à forte composante technologique, a pour sa part fini en hausse de 17,74 points (+0,28%) à 6.393,31.

Fermée lundi, la Bourse de New York a vivement réagi mardi au nouvel essai nucléaire effectué dimanche par la Corée du Nord, qui a ravivé les craintes d'un conflit avec les Etats-Unis aux conséquences incertaines.

Des indicateurs macroéconomiques publiés mercredi ont en revanche livré des signaux positifs pour l'économie américaine au troisième trimestre, avec une accélération de l'activité du secteur des services en août, selon l'indice ISM, et un déficit commercial moins élevé que prévu en juillet. [nZON013T05] [nL8N1LN40H]

"Il y a des forces opposées qui empêchent le marché de percer vers un nouveau plus haut mais les éléments fondamentaux semblent l'empêcher de s'effondrer et de déclencher un important mouvement de vente", dit Walter Todd, responsable de l'investissement chez Greenwood Capital. "Il y a ces forces opposées qui s'affrontent et qui maintiennent le marché dans une marge très étroite."

Le S&P-500 n'a ainsi fini qu'à 15 points de son record de clôture touché le 7 août.

UNITED CONTINENTAL PÉNALISÉ PAR HARVEY

Le secteur de l'énergie <.SPNY> (+1,64%) a été de loin le plus dynamique du jour, porté par des cours du pétrole en hausse avec la reprise de l'activité dans les raffineries du golfe du Mexique qui avaient été contraintes à l'arrêt par l'ouragan Harvey.

Exxon Mobil (+2,07%), qui a en outre profité d'un relèvement de recommandation par UBS, et Chevron (+2,15%) ont été les deux principaux contributeurs à la hausse du S&P-500.

Fiat Chrysler Automobiles a pris 5,54%, bénéficiant du relèvement de la recommandation de Barclays et de la hausse du secteur en Europe, porté par des espoirs de scission de l'allemand Daimler . [nL8N1LN1C6]

Gap a fini en tête du palmarès du S&P-500 avec un gain de 7,45%. Le géant américain de l'habillement a annoncé l'ouverture d'environ 70 magasins et la fermeture d'environ 200 autres jugés non performants au cours des trois prochaines années.

Wall Street a aussi apprécié l'annonce du distributeur Kohl's , qui a décidé d'ouvrir 10 grands magasins à Amazon . [nL8N1LN4Z4] Le titre Kohl's a gagné 4,9% alors qu'Amazon n'a quasiment pas varié (+0,26%).

En recul, le groupe de transport aérien United Continental a perdu 1,26% après avoir revu à la baisse sa prévision de recette unitaire par passager pour prendre en compte les perturbations provoquées par Harvey. [nL8N1LN3SH]

L'ACCORD SUR LE PLAFOND DE LA DETTE SOUTIENT LE DOLLAR

Malgré une hausse de son chiffre d'affaires trimestriel, Hewlett Packard Enterprise a cédé 1,92%, sanctionné par un abaissement de la recommandation de Bank of America Merrill Lynch.

AT&T (-1,4%) et Verizon (-0,95%) ont pour leur part souffert de l'annonce par leur concurrent T-Mobile US (+0,24%) qu'il offrirait un accès gratuit au service de vidéos en ligne Netflix (+2,71%) à ses clients disposant d'un abonnement familial.

Environ 6,3 milliards d'actions ont été échangées au cours de la séance sur les différents marchés américains, contre 5,8 milliards en moyenne sur les 20 séances précédentes.

Le dollar a faibli dans un premier temps après l'annonce du prochain départ anticipé du vice-président de la Fed, Stanley Fischer. [nL8N1LN53C] Il a cependant effacé ses pertes avec l'accord sur le plafond de la dette fédérale, pour finir quasiment inchangé face à un panier de devises de référence <.DXY> comme face à l'euro à la veille de la réunion de politique monétaire de la Banque centrale européenne (BCE).

Le rendement à 10 ans des emprunts du Trésor américain a suivi les mêmes mouvements que le dollar pour finir en hausse à 2,10%.

Valeurs refuges, le yen et l'or ont pâti de la moindre aversion au risque constatée au cours de la journée, la devise japonaise cédant près de 0,5% face au dollar et à l'euro et l'or au comptant reculant de 0,35% sous 1.334 dollars l'once.

W. Africa Crude-Offer levels steady, Sonangol sold out for Oct - 路透新闻

{{20170906T153225.351+0000}}W. Africa Crude-Offer levels steady, Sonangol sold out for OctLONDON, Sept 6 (Reuters) - Angolan state oil firm Sonangol was reported by traders on Wednesday to have sold a cargo of Gimboa, the last of its October-loading cargoes for sale, while Nigerian supply remained ample.

Offer levels for Nigerian and Angolan cargoes were steady and the focus remained on pending Indian buy tenders.

ANGOLA

* State oil company Sonangol sold a cargo of Gimboa on Monday, its last October cargo, traders said, one of which added that a U.S. buyer had bought the cargo. Price details did not emerge.

* About 12 or less Angolan crude cargoes were still available, traders said.

* Offer levels were steady. Chevron was offering Cabinda at dated Brent plus $1.10 a barrel and Total was offering Girassol at dated Brent plus $1.40.

NIGERIA

* Just over 30 October-loading cargoes were available for sale, or slightly more than half the loading programme. The number was pegged at 30 on Tuesday.

* Offers were steady. ExxonMobil was offering a late-month cargo at dated Brent plus $1.75, a trader said - 10 cents higher than an offer heard last week.

TENDERS

* The result of Indian refiner BPCL's tender to buy cargoes loading Oct. 25 to Nov. 5 had yet to emerge.

* Indian Oil Corp. is running two tenders, the results of which are expected on Thursday. The refiner is seeking a wide variety of grades, with West African sought for loading Nov. 1-10, Nov. 5-20 and Nov. 20-30.

UPDATE 2-Norway receives more bidders for mature areas oil licensing round - Reuters News

{{20170906T103019.170+0000}}UPDATE 2-Norway receives more bidders for mature areas oil licensing round* Norway hands out acreage near existing fields each year

* Applications rose to 39 this year from 33 in 2016

* Ministry received bids from a record 50 firms in 2013 round

(Adds oil minister quotes, detail)

By Nerijus Adomaitis

OSLO, Sept 6 (Reuters) - Norway's licensing round to explore for oil and gas in mature offshore areas attracted bids from 39 companies, up from 33 firms last year, the Oil and Energy Ministry said on Wednesday.

The announcement comes five days before a parliamentary election in Norway, where some opposition parties have called for scaling back exploration to reduce carbon emissions from Western Europe's top oil and gas producer.

When the so-called predefined areas (APA) licensing round was announced in May, the right-wing government expanded the areas offered near existing discoveries by 87 blocks in the Norwegian and the Barents Seas.

Norway's Oil and Energy Minister Terje Soeviknes said in a statement that increased interest in this year's APA round showed optimism was returning to the industry.

"Further exploration activity is vital to future value creation and employment," he said. "This in turn is important with reference to financing the welfare state."

Applicants included majors Shell , ConocoPhillips , Exxon Mobil and Total , as well as Norway's biggest oil and gas company Statoil .

Also on the list was Oslo-listed DNO , the biggest oil producer in the Kurdistan region of Iraq, which re-entered the Norwegian continental shelf in May after acquiring Origo Exploration.

The government plans to award licences in early 2018.

In the APA round in 2016, 29 of the 33 applicants were awarded 56 production licenses.

Mature area licensing rounds attracted the most interest in 2013, when 50 firms submitted bids, compared to 16 bids in 2005.

Norway's APA rounds were introduced in 2003 to encourage exploration near existing discoveries. Oil firms usually have between one and three years to decide whether to drill an exploration well, otherwise the production licence becomes void.

Norway holds separate licensing rounds to hand out acreage in frontier areas.

Companies do not pay for exploration acreage, but future profits from any discoveries are subject to high tax rates.

UPDATE 3-U.S. gasoline prices slip as oil industry bounces back from Harvey - Reuters News

{{20170904T210245.168+0000}}UPDATE 3-U.S. gasoline prices slip as oil industry bounces back from Harvey(Adds Port Arthur, Eagle Ford updates)

By Libby George

NEW YORK, Sept 4 (Reuters) - U.S. gasoline prices fell on Monday as the nation's oil heartland continued to claw its way back from the devastation wrought by Storm Harvey, with shipping channels, pipelines and refineries restarting operations.

Port operations across the U.S. Gulf Coast oil and gas hub were resuming, although many still had restrictions on vessel draft, according to U.S. Coast Guard updates.

Key fuel pipelines planned to restart as more of the oil refineries that feed them ramped up production.

Benchmark U.S. gasoline futures fell by more than 3 percent, and retail prices edged up by only 1 cent a gallon on Monday, according to motorists advocacy group AAA, after climbing by more than 20 cents in the wake of Harvey, which was downgraded to a storm after making landfall as a hurricane.

Harvey dumped as much as 50 inches (127 cm) of rain over Texas and Louisiana, forcing officials to close or restrict operations at ports from Corpus Christi, Texas, to Lake Charles, Louisiana. It also forced the closure of nearly a quarter of the nation's oil refining capacity.

The U.S. Coast Guard on Monday allowed some barge traffic to enter Port Arthur, Texas, home of the country's largest oil refinery, and is considering allowing ships to enter on Tuesday, a spokesman said. [nL2N1LL0ZX]

Port Arthur was one of three Texas ports that was still closed, along with Beaumont and Port Orange. The state's 25 other ports were operational as of Monday, some with restrictions, according to Colonel Lars Zetterstrom, Galveston District commander of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.

Alberto Hernandez, a watch supervisor at the U.S. Coast Guard, said on Monday that ships were exiting and entering the Houston Ship Channel, which links the Port of Houston, the busiest petrochemical port, to the Gulf of Mexico.

The channel is open to just past Exxon Mobil Corp's Baytown refinery to vessels up to a 40-foot (12-meter) draft, while salvage efforts continued to remove a sunken drydock in an industrial portion, officials said.

Hernandez said there was no time frame for removing the drydock debris from the main stem of the channel, which is key to moving crude oil to refineries.

Restarts of pipelines that move fuel from refineries to the rest of the nation also were alleviating worries about shortages.

Colonial Pipeline Co , which transports more than 3 million barrels per day (bpd) of gasoline, diesel and jet fuel from Gulf Coast refineries to Northeastern markets, said the restart on Monday afternoon of its main distillate line between Houston and Hebert, Texas, would take "a few hours." It plans the same restart process for the gasoline line between those points on Tuesday. [nENN0OPWF2]

The Explorer Pipeline planned to reopen its 24-inch (61 cm) Oklahoma-to-Midwest fuel pipeline on Monday after reopening its 28-inch (71 cm) Texas-to-Oklahoma line on Sunday. [L2N1LL01W]

ExxonMobil said on Monday its pipeline division was initiating supply of gasoline and other fuels to the Houston area after making "significant progress" on restarting the lines.

Fuels-producing refineries also were ramping up output. Valero Energy Corp was restarting multiple units at its 335,000 bpd Port Arthur, Texas, refinery on Monday, according to regulatory filings, and the company said its 293,000 bpd Corpus Christi and 225,000-bpd Texas City refineries were back to pre-storm levels of production.[nL2N1LL0UV][nL8N1LL3UW]

ExxonMobil's 560,500-bpd Baytown, Texas, refinery, the nation's second-largest, began restarting during the weekend, while Phillips 66 said it was resuming operations at its 247,000-bpd Sweeny refinery. [nL2N1LJ0FW]

Crude oil operations were also edging back to normal. ConocoPhillips said its oil production in the Eagle Ford shale region was expected to reach 80 percent of its pre-storm level of 130,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day by Monday evening, while the number of U.S. Gulf oil and gas production platforms with evacuated personnel after Hurricane Harvey dropped to 14, down from 30, according to the U.S. Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement. [nL8N1LL41G]

Still, the bureau said the total of U.S. Gulf of Mexico oil production closed increased to roughly 6.94 percent, or 121,484 bpd, up from 5.5 percent on Sunday. It did not give a reason for the increase.

FACTBOX-U.S. Gulf Coast energy infrastructure shut due to Harvey - 路透新闻

{{20170904T202227.483+0000}}FACTBOX-U.S. Gulf Coast energy infrastructure shut due to HarveySept 4 (Reuters) - Harvey hammered Louisiana and Texas after coming ashore a week ago as a
hurricane, shutting key infrastructure in the heart of the U.S. oil and natural gas industry.

Several refineries and part of a key pipeline resumed operations on Monday, while terminals,
drilling platforms and other facilities were working to restart after the storm knocked out
roughly 4.2 million barrels per day (bpd) of refining capacity, or nearly 23 percent of total
U.S. capacity. The Gulf of Mexico area has nearly half of U.S. refining capacity. [nL2N1LE12X]

Texas is home to 5.6 million bpd of refining capacity, and neighboring Louisiana has 3.3
million bpd.

Colonial Pipeline was reopening its main distillate line from Houston and Pasadena, Texas,
to Lake Charles, Louisiana, on Monday afternoon, while the Explorer Pipeline was also aiming for
a Monday restart. The developments helped alleviate concerns about domestic fuels distribution,
and the price of gasoline futures slipped by more than 3 percent. [L2N1LK0B4] [nENN0OPWF2]

Valero  on Monday said its Corpus Christi and Texas City oil refinery operations had
recovered to pre-hurricane levels, while regulatory filings showed the company restarting
multiple units at Port Arthur. Operations at its Three Rivers refinery continued to ramp up,
while its Houston refinery will increase rates as transportation and logistics infrastructure
become more accessible. [L2N1LK00H][nL8N1LL3UW][nL2N1LL0UV]

ExxonMobil Corp  said on Sunday it was making progress restarting its Baytown, Texas,
refinery, the nation's second largest, and said on Monday it was initiating supply of gasoline
and other fuels to the Houston area after making "significant progress" on restarting pipelines.
[nL2N1LJ0FV][nL2N1LK0M7][nL8N1LL41X]

Phillips 66  was preparing to resume operations at its Sweeny refinery as well as its
Beaumont terminal in Texas. The refiner also said its Pasadena refined products terminal resumed
truck loading for gasoline and diesel loading over the weekend. [nL2N1LJ0FW]

As of Monday, the number of U.S. Gulf oil and gas production platforms with evacuated
personnel dropped to 14, or 1.97 percent of the total, the federal Bureau of Safety and
Environmental Enforcement said, down from 30. Still, BSEE said the total of U.S. Gulf of Mexico
oil production closed increased to roughly 6.94 percent, or 121,484 barrels bpd, from 5.5
percent on Sunday. [nL8N1LL41G]

Colonel Lars Zetterstrom, Galveston District commander of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers,
said 25 of the 28 ports in Texas were operational as of Monday, some with restrictions. Only
Port Arthur, Beaumont and Port Orange along the Sabine-Neches Waterway remained fully closed,
and the Coast Guard said ship traffic could begin with restrictions on Tuesday at Port Arthur.

Exxon says it is initiating gasoline, fuels supply to Houston area - Reuters News

{{20170904T183934.889+0000}}Exxon says it is initiating gasoline, fuels supply to Houston areaLONDON, Sept 4 (Reuters) - ExxonMobil said on Monday its pipeline division was initiating supply of gasoline and other fuels to the Houston area after making "significant progress" on restarting the lines.

The pipelines were shut during Hurricane Harvey, which also forced the closure of the company's Baytown and Beaumont refineries.

It said a restart at the 560,500-barrel-per-day (bpd) Baytown facility was "making good progress", while the 362,300-bpd Beaumont refinery remained closed due to flooding.

CORRECTED-U.S. gasoline prices slip as oil industry bounces back from Harvey - Reuters News

{{20170904T171418.154+0000}}CORRECTED-U.S. gasoline prices slip as oil industry bounces back from Harvey(Corrects paragraph 4 to say nearly a quarter of refining capacity, from nearly a quarter of refineries)

By Libby George

NEW YORK, Sept 4 (Reuters) - U.S. gasoline prices fell on Monday as the nation's oil heartland continued to claw its way back from the devastation wrought by Storm Harvey, with shipping channels, pipelines and refineries restarting operations.

Port operations across the U.S. Gulf Coast oil and gas hub were resuming, although many still had restrictions on vessel draft, according to U.S. Coast Guard updates. Key fuels pipelines planned to restart as more of the oil refineries that feed them ramped up production.

Benchmark U.S. gasoline futures tumbled as a result by 3 percent, and retail prices edged only one cent higher on Monday, according to motorists advocacy group AAA, after climbing by more than 20 cents in the wake of the storm.

The storm dumped as much as 50 inches (127 cm) of rainfall over Texas and Louisiana, forcing officials to close or restrict operations at ports from Corpus Christi to Lake Charles, Louisiana. It also forced the closure of nearly a quarter of the nation's oil refining capacity.

Alberto Hernandez, a watch supervisor at the U.S. Coast Guard, said on Monday there were ships exiting and entering the Houston Ship Channel, which links the busiest petrochemical port to the Gulf of Mexico, on Monday.

The channel is open to just past Exxon Mobil Corp 's Baytown refinery to vessels up to a 40-foot (12-meter) draft, while salvage efforts continued to remove a sunken drydock in an industrial portion of it, officials said.

Hernandez said there was no time frame for removing the drydock debris from the main stem of the channel, which is key to moving crude oil to refineries.

Restarts at pipelines that move fuels from refineries to the rest of the nation also were alleviating worries about shortages.

Colonial Pipeline Co , which transports more than 3 million barrels per day (bpd) of gasoline, diesel and jet fuel from Gulf Coast refineries to Northeastern markets, was targeting a Monday restart of the main distillate line between Houston and Hebert, Texas. The gasoline line between those points was set to restart on Tuesday.

The Explorer Pipeline planned to reopen its 24-inch (61 cm) Oklahoma-to-Midwest fuel pipeline on Monday after reopening its 28-inch (71 cm) Texas-to-Oklahoma line on Sunday. [L2N1LL01W]

Fuels-producing refineries also were ramping up output. The nation's second-largest unit, ExxonMobil's 560,500-bpd Baytown, Texas, refinery, began restarting during the weekend, while Phillips 66 said it was resuming operations at its 247,000-bpd Sweeny refinery. [nL2N1LJ0FW]

Total plans to restart the 225,500-bpd Port Arthur, Texas, refinery soon, Gulf Coast market sources said on Sunday. [nL2N1LK0RH]

W. Africa Crude-Some Nigerian cargoes clear, Angolan muted - 路透新闻

{{20170904T154043.896+0000}}W. Africa Crude-Some Nigerian cargoes clear, Angolan mutedLONDON, Sept 4 (Reuters) - Several Nigerian crude cargoes cleared at the tail end of last week after some tenders closed, but traders remained on the sidelines on Monday with three Indian tenders due to be awarded this week.

ANGOLA

* A dozen or so Angolan crude cargoes were still available, including some for re-sale.

* Chevron has a cargo of Cabinda on offer at dated Brent plus $1.10 a barrel.

* Total has a cargo of Girassol on offer at dated Brent plus $1.40 a barrel and a cargo of Nemba still on sale from last week.

NIGERIA

* BP sold a cargo of end-October loading Erha but details of the buyer did not immediately emerge.

* ExxonMobil sold its Oct. 6-7 cargo of Qua Iboe at the end of last week but the identity of the buyer remained unclear. Litasco was still offering a cargo of Qua Iboe.

* Qua Iboe offers fell over the past week from as high as dated Brent plus $1.80 a barrel to dated Brent plus $1.65, partly because of Tropical Storm Harvey. The grade was pegged lower than that at about dated Brent plus $1.30-$1.40 a barrel.

* Chevron sold a cargo of September-loading Pennington to South Africa, several trading sources said.

TENDERS

* India's BPCL issued a buy tender for cargoes loading Oct. 25 to Nov. 5. The tender closes on Sept. 6.

* India's IOC has two tenders out. IOC is seeking a wide variety of grades, with West African ones sought for loading Nov. 1-10, Nov. 5-20 and Nov. 20-30.

EXCLUSIVE-Indonesia's Pertamina receives first license to export gasoil -sources - Reuters News

{{20170904T114629.655+0000}}EXCLUSIVE-Indonesia's Pertamina receives first license to export gasoil -sources* Crowded retail market, lower domestic demand drives up inventory

* Licence issued 2-3 weeks ago, working on export procedures

* Pertamina still wants to focus on domestic sales

* Lobbying government to be exclusive importer of gasoil

By Jessica Jaganathan and Wilda Asmarini

SINGAPORE/JAKARTA, Sept 4 (Reuters) - Indonesia's Pertamina [PERTM.UL] has received a license from the government to export gasoil for the first time, three sources close to the matter said on Monday, although the state oil company is planning to prioritize domestic sales if possible.

Pertamina is typically an importer of gasoil, as diesel is called in most Asian markets, but inbound shipments have declined over the years as it ramped up refining output and demand from the mining sector slowed.

With other gasoil sellers - such as Royal Dutch Shell , Exxon Mobil Corp and Solaris Prima Energy - crowding into the retail market, and an increased biodiesel mandate in 2016 reducing conventional consumption, Pertamina's supply of the fuel has also outperformed demand, said Toharso, director of refineries at Pertamina, who goes by one name.

If Pertamina exports its surplus fuel, it would help ease supply tightness in Asia caused by Tropical Storm Harvey, which drove up the Asian gasoil margins to a one-and-a-half month high, traders said. [nL4N1LG30C] [nL8N1LH44K]

The company, though, is also taking steps to sell more gasoil into its domestic market by asking the government to grant it a monopoly on diesel imports, which would force the other retailers to buy from Pertamina.

The state oil company received the gasoil export license two to three weeks ago, and it is developing a standard operating procedure on how to export the cargoes, the sources said.

Still, "we will try our best to sell in the domestic market," Toto Nugroho, senior vice president at Pertamina for integrated supply chain, told Reuters.

But if market competition means storage inventories build up, "the last resort is to export," he said.

Pertamina declined to give details on possible export volumes or a timeline of shipments.

LOBBYING FOR IMPORT MONOPOLY

Pertamina supplies about 70 percent of Indonesia's gasoil needs, while private firms supply the rest, Toharso said.

Many of the private firms import their gasoil, but Pertamina is lobbying Jakarta to name it the country's exclusive importer of the fuel, a move that would alleviate the state oil company's surplus and possibly negate its need to export the fuel.

"Pertamina is encouraging the Energy Ministry to make other companies not to import gasoil and just buy it from Pertamina," said Toharso.

Indonesia's Energy Ministry did not address a Reuters query asking if it will approve Pertamina's request.

Dadan Kusdiana, a spokesman for the ministry said it will "encourage (retail) companies to purchase from Pertamina first before they import."

"Pertamina has also sent an offer letter to other (retail) companies that need gasoil," Kusdiana said.

But the prices offered by Pertamina are higher than buying from the international market, said a buyer who declined to be named as he was not authorised to speak with media.

"We can easily absorb the cargoes as long as the price is competitive," the buyer said.

Toharso said the prices were negotiable.

Nearly two-thirds of Indonesia's gasoil is used in its transport sector for commercial vehicles, which is expected to grow at 3 to 5 percent this year. The rest is used in the country's industrial and mining sectors.

Solaris Prima Energy is a subsidiary of China-owned trader Unipec Singapore, whose parent company is Asia's top refiner Sinopec Corp <600028.SS>.

RPT-Harvey's wake tempers bullish outlook for U.S. oil output growth - Reuters News

{{20170904T060001.760+0000}}RPT-Harvey's wake tempers bullish outlook for U.S. oil output growth(Repeats story originally published Sept 1, no changes)

By Ernest Scheyder

HOUSTON, Sept 1 (Reuters) - Damage and delays from Tropical Storm Harvey will hold the U.S. oil industry back from achieving a targeted 10 million barrels per day of production anytime soon, according to analysts, a setback in America's fight for global market share with OPEC.

The storm, which flooded refineries, wells and pipelines across Texas, added to a string of problems oil companies already faced, like low crude prices and expensive engineering challenges at new shale wells. [nL2N1LG1DG]

Earlier this year, oil analysts and some company executives had anticipated that the United States could top the 10 million bpd mark by year-end. That would have been a 14 percent increase, taking U.S. output to a level not seen since the 1970s.

But then Harvey knocked out about a quarter of U.S. refining capacity and shuttered transport routes for crude, gasoline, diesel and other products. The storm's impacts sent gasoline prices soaring but also crimped demand for crude. [nL2N1LI0GW][nL2N1LH0T8]

Bringing all that infrastructure back to normal operations could take weeks or months.

"Harvey is going to have a longer effect on the oil industry than anyone would have imagined," said Dan Katzenberg, an oil industry analyst at R.W. Baird & Co. "It's just a real mess on so many levels."

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is frustrated that the storm has not pushed global prices higher, with one OPEC delegate telling Reuters, "It seems no event will move the oil price up much."[nL8N1LH4M4]

Slipping production after a major storm is not unprecedented: U.S. output slipped after Hurricane Dennis in 1999, Hurricane Ivan in 2004 and Hurricane Katrina in 2005, forcing a range of industry and government reactions.

On Friday, U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry said he had authorized the release of 4.5 million barrels from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve. The move, aimed at helping a handful of Gulf Coast refiners deal with local supply disruptions, will likely depress oil prices further.[nL2N1LI1DA]

FINANCIAL STRAINS

The Energy Information Administration (EIA) earlier this year had forecast that technological and process improvements would lift U.S. production sharply, leading some analysts and executives to predict 10 million bpd by December.

But in recent months those expectations dimmed. Producers, showing signs of financial strain from the tepid oil prices, pared budgets for the year.

Companies also face problems with pressure imbalance and high natural gas levels at new shale oil wells in the Permian Basin, the largest U.S. oilfield. [nL1N1KO0Z0]

The EIA on Thursday revised lower its data on U.S. oil production for June, saying it fell nearly 1 percent in the month to about 9.1 million bpd. Analysts called that a bad omen for the rest of the summer.

Harvey forced Exxon Mobil Corp , Royal Dutch Shell PLC , Marathon Oil Corp , Statoil ASA and other producers in the Eagle Ford shale region of Texas and the U.S. Gulf of Mexico to halt production and the drilling and fracking of shale wells.

More than a quarter of Gulf production went offline due to the storm, according to government data. In the Eagle Ford shale, producers on Friday were still assessing damage, but most saw operations slow or grind to a halt.[nL2N1LC0CG]

"At this point, we're really waiting to see what the cumulative effect will be" from Harvey, said Paul Hesse of the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

Exxon lost nearly 100,000 bpd of production, and Shell has so far lost more than 700,000 bpd.

ConocoPhillips , meanwhile, said it does not plan to reopen its headquarters, which abuts a Houston reservoir that nearly breached, until Sept. 11.

"That 10 million (bpd) level is just not going to happen in the next two years at least," said Anas Alhajji, an independent oil analyst and economist. "The impact of Harvey adds to existing woes."

FACTBOX-U.S. Gulf Coast energy infrastructure shut due to Harvey - 路透新闻

{{20170904T015621.207+0000}}FACTBOX-U.S. Gulf Coast energy infrastructure shut due to HarveySept 3 (Reuters) - Harvey has hammered Louisiana and Texas after coming ashore a week ago as
a hurricane, shutting key infrastructure in the heart of the U.S. oil and natural gas industry.

Several refineries, terminals, drilling platforms and other facilities were working to
restart or return to normal operations on Sunday. While the storm was receding, at least 4.2
million barrels per day (bpd) of refining capacity was still offline, or nearly 23 percent of
total U.S. capacity, based on company reports and Reuters estimates. The Gulf of Mexico area has
nearly half of U.S. refining capacity. [nL2N1LE12X]

Texas is home to 5.6 million bpd of refining capacity, and neighboring Louisiana has 3.3
million bpd. Refineries in Corpus Christi are beginning to restart, according to plant sources.

Colonial Pipeline and Explorer Pipeline were looking to restart some key pipelines early
this week, helping alleviate concerns about rising retail prices and the domestic distribution
of gasoline and distillates. [L2N1LK0B4]

ExxonMobil Corp  said on Saturday it was restarting its Baytown, Texas refinery, the
nation's second largest, six days after it was shut because of heavy rain from Harvey.
[nL2N1LJ0FV]

Phillips 66  was preparing to resume operations at its Sweeny refinery as well as its
Beaumont terminal in Texas. The refiner also said its Pasadena refined products terminal would
resume truck loading for gasoline on Saturday afternoon, while its diesel loading would resume
on Sunday. [nL2N1LJ0FW]

Valero said that operations at its Three Rivers and Corpus Christi refineries continued to
ramp up, while its Texas City plant was at full rates. Its Houston refinery will increase rates
as transportation and logistics infrastructure becomes more accessible. [L2N1LK00H]

The company added that it was evaluating the Port Arthur refinery status for any potential
storm-related impacts.

As of Sunday, the volume of Gulf Coast crude production that was still shut-in had declined
to about 96,000 bpd from nearly 107,000 bpd on Saturday

{{20170903T230146.411+0000}}US-Industrie bringt nach Wirbelstrum "Harvey" Anlagen wieder in GangHouston, 04. Sep (Reuters) - Nach dem verheerenden Wirbelsturm "Harvey" kommt die Industrie an der Golfküste der USA wieder in die Gänge. Der Energiekonzern Total gab am Sonntag die komplette Wiederherstellung der Stromversorgung seiner Raffinerie in Port Arthur bekannt. Brancheninsidern zufolge soll die Anlage bald wieder hochgefahren werden, ein konkretes Datum wurde nicht genannt. Eine Sprecherin von Exxon Mobile erklärte, die Plattform Galveston 209 im Golf sei wieder in Betrieb. Bei einer zweiten Anlage würden die Folgen des Sturms noch untersucht.

"Harvey" hatte insbesondere die Küste von Texas stark mit Mitleidenschaft gezogen, wo große Teile der amerikanischen Öl- und Gasindustrie angesiedelt sind. Mindestens 47 Menschen kamen ums Leben, der Schaden wird auf bis zu 180 Milliarden Dollar geschätzt.[nL8N1LK0OT]

FACTBOX-U.S. Gulf Coast energy infrastructure shut due to Harvey - 路透新闻

{{20170903T223022.507+0000}}FACTBOX-U.S. Gulf Coast energy infrastructure shut due to HarveySept 3 (Reuters) - Harvey has hammered Louisiana and Texas after coming ashore a week ago as
a hurricane, shutting key infrastructure in the heart of the U.S. oil and natural gas industry.

Several refineries, terminals, drilling platforms and other facilities were working to
restart or return to normal operations on Sunday. While the storm was receding, at least 4.2
million barrels per day (bpd) of refining capacity is still offline, or nearly 23 percent of
total U.S. capacity, based on company reports and Reuters estimates. The Gulf of Mexico area has
nearly half of U.S. refining capacity. [nL2N1LE12X]

Texas is home to 5.6 million bpd of refining capacity, and neighboring Louisiana has 3.3
million bpd. Refineries in Corpus Christi are beginning to restart, according to plant sources.

ExxonMobil Corp  said on Saturday it was restarting its Baytown, Texas refinery, the
nation's second largest, six days after it was shut because of heavy rain from Harvey.
[nL2N1LJ0FV]

Phillips 66  is preparing to resume operations at its Sweeny refinery as well as its
Beaumont terminal in Texas. The refiner also said its Pasadena refined products terminal would
resume truck loading for gasoline on Saturday afternoon, while its diesel loading would resume
on Sunday. [nL2N1LJ0FW]

Phillips 66's Gulf Coast fractionation plant in Mont Belvieu, Texas, suspended operations
due to a lack of storage.

Valero said that operations at its Three Rivers and Corpus Christi refineries continued to
ramp up, while its Texas City plant was at full rates. Its Houston refinery will increase rates
as transportation and logistics infrastructure becomes more accessible. [L2N1LK00H]

The company added that it was evaluating the Port Arthur refinery status for any potential
storm-related impacts.

Sources told Reuters on Thursday that the nation's largest refinery, Motiva Enterprises Port
Arthur plant, may be shut for up to two weeks. [nL2N1LH0T8]

As of Sunday, the volume of Gulf Coast crude production that was still shut-in had declined
to about 96,000 bpd from nearly 107,000 bpd on Saturday

UPDATE 3-U.S. gasoline prices slip as oil industry bounces back from Harvey - Reuters News

{{20170904T210245.168+0000}}UPDATE 3-U.S. gasoline prices slip as oil industry bounces back from Harvey(Adds Port Arthur, Eagle Ford updates)

By Libby George

NEW YORK, Sept 4 (Reuters) - U.S. gasoline prices fell on Monday as the nation's oil heartland continued to claw its way back from the devastation wrought by Storm Harvey, with shipping channels, pipelines and refineries restarting operations.

Port operations across the U.S. Gulf Coast oil and gas hub were resuming, although many still had restrictions on vessel draft, according to U.S. Coast Guard updates.

Key fuel pipelines planned to restart as more of the oil refineries that feed them ramped up production.

Benchmark U.S. gasoline futures fell by more than 3 percent, and retail prices edged up by only 1 cent a gallon on Monday, according to motorists advocacy group AAA, after climbing by more than 20 cents in the wake of Harvey, which was downgraded to a storm after making landfall as a hurricane.

Harvey dumped as much as 50 inches (127 cm) of rain over Texas and Louisiana, forcing officials to close or restrict operations at ports from Corpus Christi, Texas, to Lake Charles, Louisiana. It also forced the closure of nearly a quarter of the nation's oil refining capacity.

The U.S. Coast Guard on Monday allowed some barge traffic to enter Port Arthur, Texas, home of the country's largest oil refinery, and is considering allowing ships to enter on Tuesday, a spokesman said. [nL2N1LL0ZX]

Port Arthur was one of three Texas ports that was still closed, along with Beaumont and Port Orange. The state's 25 other ports were operational as of Monday, some with restrictions, according to Colonel Lars Zetterstrom, Galveston District commander of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.

Alberto Hernandez, a watch supervisor at the U.S. Coast Guard, said on Monday that ships were exiting and entering the Houston Ship Channel, which links the Port of Houston, the busiest petrochemical port, to the Gulf of Mexico.

The channel is open to just past Exxon Mobil Corp's Baytown refinery to vessels up to a 40-foot (12-meter) draft, while salvage efforts continued to remove a sunken drydock in an industrial portion, officials said.

Hernandez said there was no time frame for removing the drydock debris from the main stem of the channel, which is key to moving crude oil to refineries.

Restarts of pipelines that move fuel from refineries to the rest of the nation also were alleviating worries about shortages.

Colonial Pipeline Co , which transports more than 3 million barrels per day (bpd) of gasoline, diesel and jet fuel from Gulf Coast refineries to Northeastern markets, said the restart on Monday afternoon of its main distillate line between Houston and Hebert, Texas, would take "a few hours." It plans the same restart process for the gasoline line between those points on Tuesday. [nENN0OPWF2]

The Explorer Pipeline planned to reopen its 24-inch (61 cm) Oklahoma-to-Midwest fuel pipeline on Monday after reopening its 28-inch (71 cm) Texas-to-Oklahoma line on Sunday. [L2N1LL01W]

ExxonMobil said on Monday its pipeline division was initiating supply of gasoline and other fuels to the Houston area after making "significant progress" on restarting the lines.

Fuels-producing refineries also were ramping up output. Valero Energy Corp was restarting multiple units at its 335,000 bpd Port Arthur, Texas, refinery on Monday, according to regulatory filings, and the company said its 293,000 bpd Corpus Christi and 225,000-bpd Texas City refineries were back to pre-storm levels of production.[nL2N1LL0UV][nL8N1LL3UW]

ExxonMobil's 560,500-bpd Baytown, Texas, refinery, the nation's second-largest, began restarting during the weekend, while Phillips 66 said it was resuming operations at its 247,000-bpd Sweeny refinery. [nL2N1LJ0FW]

Crude oil operations were also edging back to normal. ConocoPhillips said its oil production in the Eagle Ford shale region was expected to reach 80 percent of its pre-storm level of 130,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day by Monday evening, while the number of U.S. Gulf oil and gas production platforms with evacuated personnel after Hurricane Harvey dropped to 14, down from 30, according to the U.S. Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement. [nL8N1LL41G]

Still, the bureau said the total of U.S. Gulf of Mexico oil production closed increased to roughly 6.94 percent, or 121,484 bpd, up from 5.5 percent on Sunday. It did not give a reason for the increase.

FACTBOX-U.S. Gulf Coast energy infrastructure shut due to Harvey - 路透新闻

{{20170904T202227.483+0000}}FACTBOX-U.S. Gulf Coast energy infrastructure shut due to HarveySept 4 (Reuters) - Harvey hammered Louisiana and Texas after coming ashore a week ago as a
hurricane, shutting key infrastructure in the heart of the U.S. oil and natural gas industry.

Several refineries and part of a key pipeline resumed operations on Monday, while terminals,
drilling platforms and other facilities were working to restart after the storm knocked out
roughly 4.2 million barrels per day (bpd) of refining capacity, or nearly 23 percent of total
U.S. capacity. The Gulf of Mexico area has nearly half of U.S. refining capacity. [nL2N1LE12X]

Texas is home to 5.6 million bpd of refining capacity, and neighboring Louisiana has 3.3
million bpd.

Colonial Pipeline was reopening its main distillate line from Houston and Pasadena, Texas,
to Lake Charles, Louisiana, on Monday afternoon, while the Explorer Pipeline was also aiming for
a Monday restart. The developments helped alleviate concerns about domestic fuels distribution,
and the price of gasoline futures slipped by more than 3 percent. [L2N1LK0B4] [nENN0OPWF2]

Valero  on Monday said its Corpus Christi and Texas City oil refinery operations had
recovered to pre-hurricane levels, while regulatory filings showed the company restarting
multiple units at Port Arthur. Operations at its Three Rivers refinery continued to ramp up,
while its Houston refinery will increase rates as transportation and logistics infrastructure
become more accessible. [L2N1LK00H][nL8N1LL3UW][nL2N1LL0UV]

ExxonMobil Corp  said on Sunday it was making progress restarting its Baytown, Texas,
refinery, the nation's second largest, and said on Monday it was initiating supply of gasoline
and other fuels to the Houston area after making "significant progress" on restarting pipelines.
[nL2N1LJ0FV][nL2N1LK0M7][nL8N1LL41X]

Phillips 66  was preparing to resume operations at its Sweeny refinery as well as its
Beaumont terminal in Texas. The refiner also said its Pasadena refined products terminal resumed
truck loading for gasoline and diesel loading over the weekend. [nL2N1LJ0FW]

As of Monday, the number of U.S. Gulf oil and gas production platforms with evacuated
personnel dropped to 14, or 1.97 percent of the total, the federal Bureau of Safety and
Environmental Enforcement said, down from 30. Still, BSEE said the total of U.S. Gulf of Mexico
oil production closed increased to roughly 6.94 percent, or 121,484 barrels bpd, from 5.5
percent on Sunday. [nL8N1LL41G]

Colonel Lars Zetterstrom, Galveston District commander of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers,
said 25 of the 28 ports in Texas were operational as of Monday, some with restrictions. Only
Port Arthur, Beaumont and Port Orange along the Sabine-Neches Waterway remained fully closed,
and the Coast Guard said ship traffic could begin with restrictions on Tuesday at Port Arthur.

Exxon says it is initiating gasoline, fuels supply to Houston area - Reuters News

{{20170904T183934.889+0000}}Exxon says it is initiating gasoline, fuels supply to Houston areaLONDON, Sept 4 (Reuters) - ExxonMobil said on Monday its pipeline division was initiating supply of gasoline and other fuels to the Houston area after making "significant progress" on restarting the lines.

The pipelines were shut during Hurricane Harvey, which also forced the closure of the company's Baytown and Beaumont refineries.

It said a restart at the 560,500-barrel-per-day (bpd) Baytown facility was "making good progress", while the 362,300-bpd Beaumont refinery remained closed due to flooding.

CORRECTED-U.S. gasoline prices slip as oil industry bounces back from Harvey - Reuters News

{{20170904T171418.154+0000}}CORRECTED-U.S. gasoline prices slip as oil industry bounces back from Harvey(Corrects paragraph 4 to say nearly a quarter of refining capacity, from nearly a quarter of refineries)

By Libby George

NEW YORK, Sept 4 (Reuters) - U.S. gasoline prices fell on Monday as the nation's oil heartland continued to claw its way back from the devastation wrought by Storm Harvey, with shipping channels, pipelines and refineries restarting operations.

Port operations across the U.S. Gulf Coast oil and gas hub were resuming, although many still had restrictions on vessel draft, according to U.S. Coast Guard updates. Key fuels pipelines planned to restart as more of the oil refineries that feed them ramped up production.

Benchmark U.S. gasoline futures tumbled as a result by 3 percent, and retail prices edged only one cent higher on Monday, according to motorists advocacy group AAA, after climbing by more than 20 cents in the wake of the storm.

The storm dumped as much as 50 inches (127 cm) of rainfall over Texas and Louisiana, forcing officials to close or restrict operations at ports from Corpus Christi to Lake Charles, Louisiana. It also forced the closure of nearly a quarter of the nation's oil refining capacity.

Alberto Hernandez, a watch supervisor at the U.S. Coast Guard, said on Monday there were ships exiting and entering the Houston Ship Channel, which links the busiest petrochemical port to the Gulf of Mexico, on Monday.

The channel is open to just past Exxon Mobil Corp 's Baytown refinery to vessels up to a 40-foot (12-meter) draft, while salvage efforts continued to remove a sunken drydock in an industrial portion of it, officials said.

Hernandez said there was no time frame for removing the drydock debris from the main stem of the channel, which is key to moving crude oil to refineries.

Restarts at pipelines that move fuels from refineries to the rest of the nation also were alleviating worries about shortages.

Colonial Pipeline Co , which transports more than 3 million barrels per day (bpd) of gasoline, diesel and jet fuel from Gulf Coast refineries to Northeastern markets, was targeting a Monday restart of the main distillate line between Houston and Hebert, Texas. The gasoline line between those points was set to restart on Tuesday.

The Explorer Pipeline planned to reopen its 24-inch (61 cm) Oklahoma-to-Midwest fuel pipeline on Monday after reopening its 28-inch (71 cm) Texas-to-Oklahoma line on Sunday. [L2N1LL01W]

Fuels-producing refineries also were ramping up output. The nation's second-largest unit, ExxonMobil's 560,500-bpd Baytown, Texas, refinery, began restarting during the weekend, while Phillips 66 said it was resuming operations at its 247,000-bpd Sweeny refinery. [nL2N1LJ0FW]

Total plans to restart the 225,500-bpd Port Arthur, Texas, refinery soon, Gulf Coast market sources said on Sunday. [nL2N1LK0RH]

W. Africa Crude-Some Nigerian cargoes clear, Angolan muted - 路透新闻

{{20170904T154043.896+0000}}W. Africa Crude-Some Nigerian cargoes clear, Angolan mutedLONDON, Sept 4 (Reuters) - Several Nigerian crude cargoes cleared at the tail end of last week after some tenders closed, but traders remained on the sidelines on Monday with three Indian tenders due to be awarded this week.

ANGOLA

* A dozen or so Angolan crude cargoes were still available, including some for re-sale.

* Chevron has a cargo of Cabinda on offer at dated Brent plus $1.10 a barrel.

* Total has a cargo of Girassol on offer at dated Brent plus $1.40 a barrel and a cargo of Nemba still on sale from last week.

NIGERIA

* BP sold a cargo of end-October loading Erha but details of the buyer did not immediately emerge.

* ExxonMobil sold its Oct. 6-7 cargo of Qua Iboe at the end of last week but the identity of the buyer remained unclear. Litasco was still offering a cargo of Qua Iboe.

* Qua Iboe offers fell over the past week from as high as dated Brent plus $1.80 a barrel to dated Brent plus $1.65, partly because of Tropical Storm Harvey. The grade was pegged lower than that at about dated Brent plus $1.30-$1.40 a barrel.

* Chevron sold a cargo of September-loading Pennington to South Africa, several trading sources said.

TENDERS

* India's BPCL issued a buy tender for cargoes loading Oct. 25 to Nov. 5. The tender closes on Sept. 6.

* India's IOC has two tenders out. IOC is seeking a wide variety of grades, with West African ones sought for loading Nov. 1-10, Nov. 5-20 and Nov. 20-30.

EXCLUSIVE-Indonesia's Pertamina receives first license to export gasoil -sources - Reuters News

{{20170904T114629.655+0000}}EXCLUSIVE-Indonesia's Pertamina receives first license to export gasoil -sources* Crowded retail market, lower domestic demand drives up inventory

* Licence issued 2-3 weeks ago, working on export procedures

* Pertamina still wants to focus on domestic sales

* Lobbying government to be exclusive importer of gasoil

By Jessica Jaganathan and Wilda Asmarini

SINGAPORE/JAKARTA, Sept 4 (Reuters) - Indonesia's Pertamina [PERTM.UL] has received a license from the government to export gasoil for the first time, three sources close to the matter said on Monday, although the state oil company is planning to prioritize domestic sales if possible.

Pertamina is typically an importer of gasoil, as diesel is called in most Asian markets, but inbound shipments have declined over the years as it ramped up refining output and demand from the mining sector slowed.

With other gasoil sellers - such as Royal Dutch Shell , Exxon Mobil Corp and Solaris Prima Energy - crowding into the retail market, and an increased biodiesel mandate in 2016 reducing conventional consumption, Pertamina's supply of the fuel has also outperformed demand, said Toharso, director of refineries at Pertamina, who goes by one name.

If Pertamina exports its surplus fuel, it would help ease supply tightness in Asia caused by Tropical Storm Harvey, which drove up the Asian gasoil margins to a one-and-a-half month high, traders said. [nL4N1LG30C] [nL8N1LH44K]

The company, though, is also taking steps to sell more gasoil into its domestic market by asking the government to grant it a monopoly on diesel imports, which would force the other retailers to buy from Pertamina.

The state oil company received the gasoil export license two to three weeks ago, and it is developing a standard operating procedure on how to export the cargoes, the sources said.

Still, "we will try our best to sell in the domestic market," Toto Nugroho, senior vice president at Pertamina for integrated supply chain, told Reuters.

But if market competition means storage inventories build up, "the last resort is to export," he said.

Pertamina declined to give details on possible export volumes or a timeline of shipments.

LOBBYING FOR IMPORT MONOPOLY

Pertamina supplies about 70 percent of Indonesia's gasoil needs, while private firms supply the rest, Toharso said.

Many of the private firms import their gasoil, but Pertamina is lobbying Jakarta to name it the country's exclusive importer of the fuel, a move that would alleviate the state oil company's surplus and possibly negate its need to export the fuel.

"Pertamina is encouraging the Energy Ministry to make other companies not to import gasoil and just buy it from Pertamina," said Toharso.

Indonesia's Energy Ministry did not address a Reuters query asking if it will approve Pertamina's request.

Dadan Kusdiana, a spokesman for the ministry said it will "encourage (retail) companies to purchase from Pertamina first before they import."

"Pertamina has also sent an offer letter to other (retail) companies that need gasoil," Kusdiana said.

But the prices offered by Pertamina are higher than buying from the international market, said a buyer who declined to be named as he was not authorised to speak with media.

"We can easily absorb the cargoes as long as the price is competitive," the buyer said.

Toharso said the prices were negotiable.

Nearly two-thirds of Indonesia's gasoil is used in its transport sector for commercial vehicles, which is expected to grow at 3 to 5 percent this year. The rest is used in the country's industrial and mining sectors.

Solaris Prima Energy is a subsidiary of China-owned trader Unipec Singapore, whose parent company is Asia's top refiner Sinopec Corp <600028.SS>.

RPT-Harvey's wake tempers bullish outlook for U.S. oil output growth - Reuters News

{{20170904T060001.760+0000}}RPT-Harvey's wake tempers bullish outlook for U.S. oil output growth(Repeats story originally published Sept 1, no changes)

By Ernest Scheyder

HOUSTON, Sept 1 (Reuters) - Damage and delays from Tropical Storm Harvey will hold the U.S. oil industry back from achieving a targeted 10 million barrels per day of production anytime soon, according to analysts, a setback in America's fight for global market share with OPEC.

The storm, which flooded refineries, wells and pipelines across Texas, added to a string of problems oil companies already faced, like low crude prices and expensive engineering challenges at new shale wells. [nL2N1LG1DG]

Earlier this year, oil analysts and some company executives had anticipated that the United States could top the 10 million bpd mark by year-end. That would have been a 14 percent increase, taking U.S. output to a level not seen since the 1970s.

But then Harvey knocked out about a quarter of U.S. refining capacity and shuttered transport routes for crude, gasoline, diesel and other products. The storm's impacts sent gasoline prices soaring but also crimped demand for crude. [nL2N1LI0GW][nL2N1LH0T8]

Bringing all that infrastructure back to normal operations could take weeks or months.

"Harvey is going to have a longer effect on the oil industry than anyone would have imagined," said Dan Katzenberg, an oil industry analyst at R.W. Baird & Co. "It's just a real mess on so many levels."

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is frustrated that the storm has not pushed global prices higher, with one OPEC delegate telling Reuters, "It seems no event will move the oil price up much."[nL8N1LH4M4]

Slipping production after a major storm is not unprecedented: U.S. output slipped after Hurricane Dennis in 1999, Hurricane Ivan in 2004 and Hurricane Katrina in 2005, forcing a range of industry and government reactions.

On Friday, U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry said he had authorized the release of 4.5 million barrels from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve. The move, aimed at helping a handful of Gulf Coast refiners deal with local supply disruptions, will likely depress oil prices further.[nL2N1LI1DA]

FINANCIAL STRAINS

The Energy Information Administration (EIA) earlier this year had forecast that technological and process improvements would lift U.S. production sharply, leading some analysts and executives to predict 10 million bpd by December.

But in recent months those expectations dimmed. Producers, showing signs of financial strain from the tepid oil prices, pared budgets for the year.

Companies also face problems with pressure imbalance and high natural gas levels at new shale oil wells in the Permian Basin, the largest U.S. oilfield. [nL1N1KO0Z0]

The EIA on Thursday revised lower its data on U.S. oil production for June, saying it fell nearly 1 percent in the month to about 9.1 million bpd. Analysts called that a bad omen for the rest of the summer.

Harvey forced Exxon Mobil Corp , Royal Dutch Shell PLC , Marathon Oil Corp , Statoil ASA and other producers in the Eagle Ford shale region of Texas and the U.S. Gulf of Mexico to halt production and the drilling and fracking of shale wells.

More than a quarter of Gulf production went offline due to the storm, according to government data. In the Eagle Ford shale, producers on Friday were still assessing damage, but most saw operations slow or grind to a halt.[nL2N1LC0CG]

"At this point, we're really waiting to see what the cumulative effect will be" from Harvey, said Paul Hesse of the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

Exxon lost nearly 100,000 bpd of production, and Shell has so far lost more than 700,000 bpd.

ConocoPhillips , meanwhile, said it does not plan to reopen its headquarters, which abuts a Houston reservoir that nearly breached, until Sept. 11.

"That 10 million (bpd) level is just not going to happen in the next two years at least," said Anas Alhajji, an independent oil analyst and economist. "The impact of Harvey adds to existing woes."

FACTBOX-U.S. Gulf Coast energy infrastructure shut due to Harvey - 路透新闻

{{20170904T015621.207+0000}}FACTBOX-U.S. Gulf Coast energy infrastructure shut due to HarveySept 3 (Reuters) - Harvey has hammered Louisiana and Texas after coming ashore a week ago as
a hurricane, shutting key infrastructure in the heart of the U.S. oil and natural gas industry.

Several refineries, terminals, drilling platforms and other facilities were working to
restart or return to normal operations on Sunday. While the storm was receding, at least 4.2
million barrels per day (bpd) of refining capacity was still offline, or nearly 23 percent of
total U.S. capacity, based on company reports and Reuters estimates. The Gulf of Mexico area has
nearly half of U.S. refining capacity. [nL2N1LE12X]

Texas is home to 5.6 million bpd of refining capacity, and neighboring Louisiana has 3.3
million bpd. Refineries in Corpus Christi are beginning to restart, according to plant sources.

Colonial Pipeline and Explorer Pipeline were looking to restart some key pipelines early
this week, helping alleviate concerns about rising retail prices and the domestic distribution
of gasoline and distillates. [L2N1LK0B4]

ExxonMobil Corp  said on Saturday it was restarting its Baytown, Texas refinery, the
nation's second largest, six days after it was shut because of heavy rain from Harvey.
[nL2N1LJ0FV]

Phillips 66  was preparing to resume operations at its Sweeny refinery as well as its
Beaumont terminal in Texas. The refiner also said its Pasadena refined products terminal would
resume truck loading for gasoline on Saturday afternoon, while its diesel loading would resume
on Sunday. [nL2N1LJ0FW]

Valero said that operations at its Three Rivers and Corpus Christi refineries continued to
ramp up, while its Texas City plant was at full rates. Its Houston refinery will increase rates
as transportation and logistics infrastructure becomes more accessible. [L2N1LK00H]

The company added that it was evaluating the Port Arthur refinery status for any potential
storm-related impacts.

As of Sunday, the volume of Gulf Coast crude production that was still shut-in had declined
to about 96,000 bpd from nearly 107,000 bpd on Saturday

Sep (Reuters) - Nach dem verheerenden Wirbelsturm "Harvey" kommt die Industrie an der Golfküste der USA wieder in die Gänge. Der Energiekonzern Total gab am Sonntag die komplette Wiederherstellung der Stromversorgung seiner Raffinerie in Port Arthur bekannt. Brancheninsidern zufolge soll die Anlage bald wieder hochgefahren werden, ein konkretes Datum wurde nicht genannt. Eine Sprecherin von Exxon Mobile erklärte, die Plattform Galveston 209 im Golf sei wieder in Betrieb. Bei einer zweiten Anlage würden die Folgen des Sturms noch untersucht.

"Harvey" hatte insbesondere die Küste von Texas stark mit Mitleidenschaft gezogen, wo große Teile der amerikanischen Öl- und Gasindustrie angesiedelt sind. Mindestens 47 Menschen kamen ums Leben, der Schaden wird auf bis zu 180 Milliarden Dollar geschätzt.[nL8N1LK0OT]

FACTBOX-U.S. Gulf Coast energy infrastructure shut due to Harvey - 路透新闻

{{20170903T223022.507+0000}}FACTBOX-U.S. Gulf Coast energy infrastructure shut due to HarveySept 3 (Reuters) - Harvey has hammered Louisiana and Texas after coming ashore a week ago as
a hurricane, shutting key infrastructure in the heart of the U.S. oil and natural gas industry.

Several refineries, terminals, drilling platforms and other facilities were working to
restart or return to normal operations on Sunday. While the storm was receding, at least 4.2
million barrels per day (bpd) of refining capacity is still offline, or nearly 23 percent of
total U.S. capacity, based on company reports and Reuters estimates. The Gulf of Mexico area has
nearly half of U.S. refining capacity. [nL2N1LE12X]

Texas is home to 5.6 million bpd of refining capacity, and neighboring Louisiana has 3.3
million bpd. Refineries in Corpus Christi are beginning to restart, according to plant sources.

ExxonMobil Corp  said on Saturday it was restarting its Baytown, Texas refinery, the
nation's second largest, six days after it was shut because of heavy rain from Harvey.
[nL2N1LJ0FV]

Phillips 66  is preparing to resume operations at its Sweeny refinery as well as its
Beaumont terminal in Texas. The refiner also said its Pasadena refined products terminal would
resume truck loading for gasoline on Saturday afternoon, while its diesel loading would resume
on Sunday. [nL2N1LJ0FW]

Phillips 66's Gulf Coast fractionation plant in Mont Belvieu, Texas, suspended operations
due to a lack of storage.

Valero said that operations at its Three Rivers and Corpus Christi refineries continued to
ramp up, while its Texas City plant was at full rates. Its Houston refinery will increase rates
as transportation and logistics infrastructure becomes more accessible. [L2N1LK00H]

The company added that it was evaluating the Port Arthur refinery status for any potential
storm-related impacts.

Sources told Reuters on Thursday that the nation's largest refinery, Motiva Enterprises Port
Arthur plant, may be shut for up to two weeks. [nL2N1LH0T8]

As of Sunday, the volume of Gulf Coast crude production that was still shut-in had declined
to about 96,000 bpd from nearly 107,000 bpd on Saturday

Harvey's wake tempers bullish outlook for U.S. oil output growth - Reuters News

{{20170901T200010.017+0000}}Harvey's wake tempers bullish outlook for U.S. oil output growthBy Ernest Scheyder

HOUSTON, Sept 1 (Reuters) - Damage and delays from Tropical Storm Harvey will hold the U.S. oil industry back from achieving a targeted 10 million barrels per day of production anytime soon, according to analysts, a setback in America's fight for global market share with OPEC.

The storm, which flooded refineries, wells and pipelines across Texas, added to a string of problems oil companies already faced, like low crude prices and expensive engineering challenges at new shale wells. [nL2N1LG1DG]

Earlier this year, oil analysts and some company executives had anticipated that the United States could top the 10 million bpd mark by year-end. That would have been a 14 percent increase, taking U.S. output to a level not seen since the 1970s.

But then Harvey knocked out about a quarter of U.S. refining capacity and shuttered transport routes for crude, gasoline, diesel and other products. The storm's impacts sent gasoline prices soaring but also crimped demand for crude. [nL2N1LI0GW][nL2N1LH0T8]

Bringing all that infrastructure back to normal operations could take weeks or months.

"Harvey is going to have a longer effect on the oil industry than anyone would have imagined," said Dan Katzenberg, an oil industry analyst at R.W. Baird & Co. "It's just a real mess on so many levels."

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is frustrated that the storm has not pushed global prices higher, with one OPEC delegate telling Reuters, "It seems no event will move the oil price up much."[nL8N1LH4M4]

Slipping production after a major storm is not unprecedented: U.S. output slipped after Hurricane Dennis in 1999, Hurricane Ivan in 2004 and Hurricane Katrina in 2005, forcing a range of industry and government reactions.

On Friday, U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry said he had authorized the release of 4.5 million barrels from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve. The move, aimed at helping a handful of Gulf Coast refiners deal with local supply disruptions, will likely depress oil prices further.[nL2N1LI1DA]

FINANCIAL STRAINS

The Energy Information Administration (EIA) earlier this year had forecast that technological and process improvements would lift U.S. production sharply, leading some analysts and executives to predict 10 million bpd by December.

But in recent months those expectations dimmed. Producers, showing signs of financial strain from the tepid oil prices, pared budgets for the year.

Companies also face problems with pressure imbalance and high natural gas levels at new shale oil wells in the Permian Basin, the largest U.S. oilfield. [nL1N1KO0Z0]

The EIA on Thursday revised lower its data on U.S. oil production for June, saying it fell nearly 1 percent in the month to about 9.1 million bpd. Analysts called that a bad omen for the rest of the summer.

Harvey forced Exxon Mobil Corp , Royal Dutch Shell PLC , Marathon Oil Corp , Statoil ASA and other producers in the Eagle Ford shale region of Texas and the U.S. Gulf of Mexico to halt production and the drilling and fracking of shale wells.

More than a quarter of Gulf production went offline due to the storm, according to government data. In the Eagle Ford shale, producers on Friday were still assessing damage, but most saw operations slow or grind to a halt.[nL2N1LC0CG]

"At this point, we're really waiting to see what the cumulative effect will be" from Harvey, said Paul Hesse of the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

Exxon lost nearly 100,000 bpd of production, and Shell has so far lost more than 700,000 bpd.

ConocoPhillips , meanwhile, said it does not plan to reopen its headquarters, which abuts a Houston reservoir that nearly breached, until Sept. 11.

"That 10 million (bpd) level is just not going to happen in the next two years at least," said Anas Alhajji, an independent oil analyst and economist. "The impact of Harvey adds to existing woes."

FACTBOX-U.S. Gulf Coast energy infrastructure shut due to Harvey - 路透新闻

{{20170901T172618.062+0000}}FACTBOX-U.S. Gulf Coast energy infrastructure shut due to HarveyBy David Gaffen

Sept 1 (Reuters) - Harvey has hammered Louisiana and Texas after coming ashore a week ago as
a hurricane, shutting key infrastructure in the heart of the U.S. oil and natural gas industry.

Several refineries, terminals, drilling platforms and other infrastructure have shut. While
the storm is receding, at least 4.2 million barrels per day (bpd) of refining capacity is still
offline, or nearly 23 percent of total U.S. capacity, based on company reports and Reuters
estimates. The Gulf of Mexico area has nearly half of U.S. refining capacity. [nL2N1LE12X]

Texas is home to 5.6 million bpd of refining capacity, and neighboring Louisiana has 3.3
million bpd. Refineries in Corpus Christi were beginning to restart, according to plant sources.

Marathon's Galveston Bay refinery had brought production levels back up to about 45 percent
of capacity, while LyondellBasell's Houston refinery was at about 63 percent capacity, according
to sources. [nL2N1LI03T] [nL2N1LI0S4]

On Thursday sources told Reuters that the nation's largest refinery, Motiva Enterprises Port
Arthur plant, may be shut for up to two weeks. [nL2N1LH0T8]

About 13.5 percent of oil production in the Gulf of Mexico was shut in on Thursday,
according to the U.S. Department of the Interior. [nL2N1LH1IQ]

BREAKINGVIEWS-Vanguard slowly flexes corporate-governance muscle - Reuters Breakingviews

{{20170901T162626.350+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-Vanguard slowly flexes corporate-governance muscle(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.)

By Tom Buerkle

NEW YORK, Sept 1 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Activist hedge-fund manager Paul Singer recently warned that the rise of so-called passive investing risked distorting markets and "devouring capitalism." But although index-tracking funds can't sell stocks when they spot trouble ahead, that doesn't mean they are without influence.

Vanguard demonstrated as much with its latest report on investment stewardship. The giant $4.5 trillion mutual-fund manager stepped up its corporate engagement activity in the 12 months to June, holding discussions with more than 900 companies around the world on governance, pay and other issues. It also voted against management at Exxon Mobil , Viacom and Wells Fargo on climate change, pay and the like. And it supported 47 percent of board-related proposals put forward by outside shareholders at U.S. companies, up from 17 percent the previous year.

The company founded by indexing pioneer Jack Bogle has been slower to find a less passive voice than rival BlackRock . Vanguard describes its engagements anecdotally without identifying companies, unlike the $5.7 trillion manager led by Larry Fink, which used a recent report to provide detailed arguments against Exxon Mobil's refusal to disclose its climate-related risks and against drugmaker Mylan's executive-pay policies. Yet Vanguard's detailed proxy-voting record shows its votes lined up alongside BlackRock's at the oil giant and at Mylan.

In an open letter to corporate directors, Vanguard Chairman and Chief Executive William McNabb said the firm was determined to press its investors' interest and prod companies to manage for the long term precisely because the index funds that comprise nearly three-quarters of its assets hold their securities almost indefinitely. Among other things, he stressed the need for gender diversity on boards, an issue rival indexing heavyweight State Street Global Advisors championed this year too.

Index-tracking managers may not throw their weight around publicly like Singer's Elliott Management and other activists, but their sheer size gives them sway. Vanguard alone owns on average more than 6 percent of every S&P 500 Index company. In one specific instance, it joined the large vote against the re-election to the board of Wells Fargo Chairman Stephen Sanger over the bank's fake-accounts scandal, contributing to the bank's recent decision to replace Sanger with Elizabeth Duke. McNabb and his managers talk softly, but they carry a big stick.

CONTEXT NEWS

- Vanguard on Aug. 31 said it engaged with 954 companies around the world on governance, pay and other issues in the 12 months ended June 30, an increase of 17 percent from the previous year.

- The mutual-fund manager voted in favor of 47 percent of board-related proposals introduced by outside shareholders at U.S. companies in the latest proxy season, up from 17 percent in the previous year, the company disclosed in its annual investment stewardship report. It supported management in 96 percent of say-on-pay votes, the same as in the previous year, 86 percent of other compensation-related proposals, up from 83 percent previously, and 90 percent of governance-related proposals, down from 91 percent previously.

STAVANGER, Norway, Aug 31 (Reuters) - The future of Norway's oil sector is emerging as a key issue for voters in a Sept. 11 parliamentary election, nowhere more so than in the oil capital of Stavanger.

The right-wing bloc of Conservative Prime Minister Erna Solberg is neck-and-neck in opinion polls with an opposition grouping led by Jonas Gahr Stoere's Labour.

Should neither secure a majority, the smaller Green party - which pledges to stop oil exploration and phase out production within 15 years - could become kingmakers.

There is little chance of the Greens being able to call time on Norway's number one industry, which all major parties back to the hilt, accounts for half of national exports and employs over 180,000 people.

But they have been gradually gathering support over the past four years and are polling at about 5 percent of the vote, underlining changes in Norwegian society and divisions over the future of oil.

Should they hold the balance of power, they could seek to force compromises to trim the oil industry's ambitions, with environmentalists in recent months focusing on the need to limit oil companies' expansion in the Arctic.

The Norwegian oil sector is still in recovery mode after thousands of local jobs were lost when crude prices crashed between 2014 and 2016. So the risk of any curbing of its prospects is high in people's minds in Stavanger, a windswept west coast city set among fjords.

"If you were to just close down this industry, what are we supposed to live off? This is a big question for many," said Egil Ellingsen, 38, a Lutheran pastor who said he had counselled many people in the area who had lost their jobs.

Ellingsen organised a public debate at his church last weekend with local parliamentary candidates, attended by about 800 people.

The subject of jobs - how to create them, how people would survive if the oil industry declined - surfaced regularly during the debate.

At one point Ellingsen asked the local Green candidate: "Can you give me concrete examples of what jobs people could do if oil stops?"

The candidate cited the offshore wind industry and the forestry and fisheries sectors as examples.

'WE NEED CLEAR DIRECTION'

Such assurances are not assuaging the concerns of workers at Dusavik port, outside Stavanger, which Total , ExxonMobil and Statoil use to ship equipment to their platforms in the North Sea.

On a cloudy morning, staff are unloading drilling fluid from the Normand Leader ship just back from the Johan Sverdrup oil and gas field, which Norwegian state-controlled Statoil and its partners are developing offshore.

Production at the giant field - up to 3.3 billion barrels of oil - is due to start in 2019 but it is already keeping the harbour busy.

After Johan Sverdrup was discovered in 2010, the port's operator, NorSea Group, invested 220 million crowns ($28.53 million) in its infrastructure to accommodate increased activity.

Even as crude prices plunged, it kept all its 150 full-time employees at Dusavik, but let go the 20-30 workers who were on temporary contracts at Dusavik and its sister port in nearby Tananger.

Rune Veenstra, the port's managing director, said the election campaign was sending out conflicting signals and creating uncertainty. What his company needed more than anything was clarity and predictability so that it can make long-term investments, he added.

"If we can't have a clear direction, it is no good for anyone," Veenstra told Reuters.

ECONOMY ON THE MEND

The main parties say they will not give ground to the Greens or any other group seeking to curb Norway's oil sector, which is pivotal to a national economy that is turning a corner after a couple of slow years.

In the first half of 2017, the economy grew more than expected and reached 0.7 percent in the second quarter, data from Statistics Norway showed on Aug. 24. [nL8N1LA0WJ]

The current government coalition, the centre-right Conservatives and the populist Progress Party, claim credit for the turnaround. Their approach has been to cut taxes on businesses and individuals and plug the gap thanks to Norway's near-$1 trillion sovereign wealth fund.

"This is a sign that the economic policy that the government has been running over the last years has been (right)," Health Minister Bent Hoeie, a Conservative, told Reuters.

That view is shared among some voters, such as 47-year-old Finn, a former oil worker who says he will vote for the Conservatives.

When Reuters met him in October 2015, Finn had just been laid off and was looking for work (http://reut.rs/2iwkxPq). He is now employed by a state agency working for the Norwegian armed forces.

"I am interested in schools and creating workplace opportunities ... the Conservatives have a better programme," he said. He declined to give his full name.

But Labour, which was in government in 2005-2013, is emphasising that, even though the economy is on the up, there are still challenges to address if the country wants to finance its cradle-to-grave welfare state in the future.

"We have to make sure that more of those who are outside (the job market) get an opportunity to have a job in the future," Hadia Tajik, Labour's deputy leader, told Reuters.

Many Labour supporters told Reuters they would vote for the party because it was best at delivering good public services, such as schools and hospitals.

"When Labour was in power, the schools, the hospitals, everything was good. Now it is not," said Atif Nisar, a 39-year-old taxi driver. "My whole family has decided, we are all voting Labour."
