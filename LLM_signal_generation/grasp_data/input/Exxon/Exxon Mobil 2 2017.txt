* Grace period on repayment of between 3-5 years

* Kurdistan needs funds for battle with ISIS, refugee crisis

By Dmitry Zhdannikov

LONDON, Feb 28 (Reuters) - Iraq's Kurdistan has agreed new deals to borrow $3 billion from trading houses and Russian state oil firm Rosneft that will be guaranteed by future oil sales to strengthen its fiscal position as the semi-autonomous region fights Islamic State.

Kurdistan's natural sources minister Ashti Hawrami told Reuters the new deals had been concluded in recent weeks. The region also negotiated grace periods of between 3 and 5 years for repaying the debt.

Trading houses have been pre-financing Kurdish oil exports for the past two years after the government in Erbil decided to start independent oil exports via Turkey's Mediterranean terminals. Rosneft said last week it would join them. [nR4N1G100S].

Kurdistan says it needs to export oil independently as Baghdad has not paid Erbil its budget share just as the region needs money to fight Islamic State and host Syrian refugees.

Baghdad has said it would sue buyers of Kurdish oil, arguing that the central government was the only legal exporter. The new Baghdad government has softened its stance, however, as it cooperated with Erbil against Islamic State in Mosul.

"This helps our economic independence although it is important to understand that this cannot be achieved just by oil revenues and higher oil prices. We also need to press on with our economic reforms," Hawrami said in an interview in London.

"We have learnt a lot from the oil price shock, the costs of fighting ISIS, and the burden of some 1.8 million refugees coming to our territory... Reform is a must – we have a lot of debts to deal with."

He declined to name the trading houses but market sources have previously identified Vitol, Petraco, Glencore and Trafigura as buyers of Kurdish barrels. Last week, Glencore confirmed it had concluded deals for Kurdish oil. The other trading houses do not comment on their dealings with Kurdistan and Rosneft did not give any details on the size of the deal.

Hawrami said the deals would serve as a hedge against an oil price slide for several years. Previous deals with trading houses have usually lasted 6-12 months.

"It is also positive for the traders as they don't have to renegotiate their contracts every six months," said Hawrami.

"It strengthens our fiscal situation. It means we can pay more regularly to the international oil companies working in Kurdistan and we can invest some money in expanding our oil infrastructure," he said.

Kurdistan's finances suffered badly during the oil price slump of 2015-2016 and it has accumulated several months of arrears to producers such as Genel , DNO and Gulf Keystone due to tight revenues and supply glitches.

"This year we want to avoid repeating this. I'm confident we will do better. We know the producers' needs and plans. We are prioritizing not to fall behind again," Hawrami said.

GROUND BREAKING DEAL

Hawrami said the arrival of Rosneft in addition to trading houses to the marketing of Kurdish barrels was good news for the region as it gave Erbil its first big end-user and opened up new markets - Rosneft has refineries in Germany and India.

"We hope Rosneft's deal will become a ground breaker for other majors," he said adding Rosneft was also looking at exploration blocks in Kurdistan.

He also said relations with Baghdad were improving.

"We didn't hear any negative comments from them after the deal with Rosneft. They know we are selling our oil. And actually if we help each other rather than hindering progress, we can both achieve better prices as buyers will not be able to seek unreasonable discounts."

He also said the fact that Erbil was now selling some barrels for Baghdad from the northern Kirkuk field was evidence of improving relations.

"In reality, Baghdad has given us some share of oil to export. So we have an arrangement that we both honour. We have real cooperation and we hope to build on that," he said.

INFRASTRUCTURE EXPANSION

Kurdistan's existing pipelines can handle just over 650,000 barrels per day of exports and more investments are needed to bring that capacity to 1 million bpd, including upgrading of pumping stations, said Hawrami.

He said pipeline capacity should be expanded by the year-end but production would not start rising until next year.

"We have to be mindful about supply and demand. You tell me what the oil price is going to be and I will tell you when we could reach 1 million bpd of output. Investments have dried up in the last two years because of the oil price crash and attacks by ISIS," he said.

Kurdistan is planning to offer some 20 blocks of land for exploration to investors. The region took some blocks back from investors after discovering they did little exploration, said Hawrami without naming the companies.

Some operators relinquished blocks as they were disappointed with what they found, including U.S. oil giant Exxon Mobil which has given back three blocks out of six over the past year.

Hawrami said he did not see this as a set back.

"Exxon has concluded that they will continue working on 3 blocks while on another three the potential reserves were simply not big enough for them. Those blocks could suit other firms. We are now looking to farm them out," he said.

Nigeria's crude oil exports to slip in April - loading plans - 路透新闻

{{20170228T123735.667+0000}}Nigeria's crude oil exports to slip in April - loading plansLONDON, Feb 28 (Reuters) - Nigeria's April crude oil exports
are on track to drop by just over 100,000 barrels per day (bpd)
in April from the previous month, according to loading
programmes compiled by Reuters on Tuesday.

The exports of 1.54 million bpd, on 50 cargoes, are down
from a revised March programme that included 1.65 million bpd on
56 cargoes. The biggest month-on-month decline was in Qua Iboe,
Nigeria's largest oil stream.

Qua Iboe exports in March were revised higher to 11 cargoes,
four more than the 7 planned to load in April, due to loading
delays that have pushed February exports back. Field operator
Exxon Mobil has reissued the export programme for Qua Iboe
several times this year, though the reason for the problems was
not immediately clear. [nL5N1FL5VW]

The company dealt with strike action in late December that
impacted its production, and also had to deal with the closure
of the main pipeline that exports the oil. [nL8N1BR2QM]

Agbami, Amenam, Brass River and Erha were also set to load
fewer cargoes in April, despite a respite in militant attacks in
the Delta region and the lifting by ENI of force majeure on
Brass River. Antan, which has field maintenance, will not export
any cargoes in April.

Exports of Bonga were set to climb to 4 cargoes, from just
one in March, as operator Shell completed field maintenance,
traders said. There were also more cargoes of Bonny Light,
Escravos, Owkwori and Usan.

April's exports will also include four cargoes of Akpo
condensate, for a total of 133,000 bpd, the same total as March
but slightly higher on a bpd basis due to the shorter month in
April.

CORRECTED-UPDATE 1-Oil and gas producer Apache to spend 63.2 pct more this year - 路透新闻

{{20170227T164125.572+0000}}CORRECTED-UPDATE 1-Oil and gas producer Apache to spend 63.2 pct more this year(In Feb. 23 story, removes reference in paragraph 7 to Chevron raising its budget for the year. Chevron had cut its budget.)

Feb 23 (Reuters) - Oil and gas producer Apache Corp said it would spend 63.2 percent more in 2017 than it did last year, joining a growing list of U.S. shale producers who are ramping up spending to take advantage of a recovery in oil prices.

Apache, which reported a smaller loss on Thursday, plans to spend $3.1 billion in 2017, higher than the $1.9 billion it spent last year.

The company said it would spend nearly two-thirds of its budget in Texas' Permian Basin, of which $500 million is budgeted for infrastructure development in the so-called Alpine High field.

Total production was nearly unchanged at 490,376 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the fourth quarter.

Apache said last September it had amassed more than 300,000 acres in the field it calls Alpine High, most of which is in Reeves County, Texas.

U.S. crude prices, which dipped to a low of $26.05 last year have largely traded above $50 since late November.

This has prompted producers such as Exxon Mobil and Hess Corp to boost their capital budgets for the year.

Net loss attributable to Apache's common shareholders was $182 million, or 48 cents per share, in the three months ended Dec. 31. (http://bit.ly/2moGRY9)

The company had posted a loss of $4.02 billion, or $10.62 per share, a year earlier, when it incurred one-time charges of $5.9 billion.

The Houston-based company's total revenue fell about 2 percent to $1.45 billion.

RPT-ANALYSIS-Canada energy sector sidelined as Big Oil chases fatter profits - 路透新闻

{{20170227T130103.995+0000}}RPT-ANALYSIS-Canada energy sector sidelined as Big Oil chases fatter profits(Repeats late Friday story with no changes to text)

By Nia Williams

CALGARY, Alberta, Feb 24 (Reuters) - Canada's energy sector has fallen out of favor with international oil majors, who are scaling back ambitions and walking away from reserves in the ground there to focus on lower-cost and higher-margin opportunities elsewhere.

Billion-dollar bets on Canada's oil sands went sour this week for Exxon Mobil Corp and Conoco Phillips . Between them, the two companies erased from their books nearly 5 billion barrels of bitumen, the heavy, viscous oil found under Alberta's boreal forest. This has wiped about $250 billion worth of oil from their reserves. [nL1N1G61S7] [nL1N1G723D]

Conoco has put $2 billion of Canadian natural gas assets on the block. [nL1N1G1140]

The companies joined the list of foreign players to take a hit in a Canadian energy patch where a two-year slump in global oil prices has discouraged the high investments needed to get projects off the ground.

While crude prices have recovered to above $50 a barrel from a low of $26 a year ago, that is not enough to make Canada's oil sands profitable. Even some of Canada's conventional energy plays are expensive at current crude prices.

Canadian producer Husky Energy Inc , owned by Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing, is weighing the sale of some Eastern Canadian offshore crude assets, people familiar with the matter told Reuters. [nL1N1G916U]

The oil sands have caused energy companies the most pain.

Devon Energy Corp Chief Executive Officer Dave Hager summed up the problem this month when discussing the Pike oil sands project, which awaits a company decision later this year.

"We like the project a lot, but ... it's a little bit lower return than our well-oriented programs here in the U.S.," Hager told analysts on an earnings call.

Hager cited capital costs and uncertain future prices as factors behind the wariness of sinking funds into projects that take four years to build. Shale plays need less investment, produce cheaper oil and often provide a fatter return within months.

President Donald Trump is also expected to loosen U.S. regulations for oil and gas companies, while the Canadian government has been planning a carbon tax.

Statoil ASA sold its oil sands project and leases to Calgary-based Athabasca Oil Corp . CNOOC-owned <0883.HK> Nexen shut down its oil sands upgrader. Royal Dutch Shell abandoned its 80,000 barrel per day Carmon Creek project, taking a $2 billion write-down.

"The oil sands are not as sexy as they used to be," said GMP FirstEnergy analyst Martin King. "The focus is on the United States - there are more immediate returns and lower drilling costs."

In the days of $100 a barrel crude, and before the U.S. shale revolution, the oil sands were a red-hot play for investors, offering huge reserves, low decline rates and a stable political climate.

Between 2005 and 2015 foreign direct investment in Canada's oil industry more than doubled to C$130 billion ($99.19 billion) from C$50 billion, according to Statistics Canada data. That slowed in 2015 as the crude price rout deepened.

"You would assume it's still slowing down based on lower prices," said economist Carlos Murillo of the Conference Board of Canada.

RS Energy Group analyst Rob Bedin noted that Suncor Energy's Fort Hills, the last of the oil sands mega-projects, needs U.S. crude prices around $100 a barrel to break even, compared with $40-$45 a barrel for shale plays in the Midland Basin, Texas.

While oil sands growth is expected to slow dramatically, production is not expected to drop. Projects there, once built, are viewed as a useful addition to companies' portfolios. Day-to-day operating costs are reasonably low and they produce for decades.

Two years ago, producer forecasts of 2026 oil sands production totalled 6 million bpd, according to RS Energy research, up from 2.5 million bpd currently.

Last year producers dropped that 2026 forecast to 5 million bpd, but RS Energy analysis suggests 3.5 billion bpd is more realistic once company finances are taken into account.

BACK-YARD RESOURCE

The fate of growth in the oil sands is primarily in the hands of the domestic Canadian producers like Suncor Energy and MEG Energy , which are still intent on developing their back-yard crude resource through improved technology and carefully planned small-scale expansions.

Canadian reserve reporting rules, which allow the use of price forecasts from reserve evaluation firms, help domestic oil sands producers maintain a more positive outlook. The United States requires producers to report reserves based on last year's prices.

Still, there are concerns even for oil sands specialists. These include low crude prices, environmental opposition to building new pipelines and government carbon emissions caps.

Lack of pipeline capacity has in the past left crude bottlenecked in Alberta, but now that three major projects are finally moving forward there are doubts about whether there will be enough volume to fill them.

Enbridge Inc CEO Al Monaco said two pipelines should suffice based on the current supply outlook, and the latest cuts in reserves may make it harder for projects like TransCanada Corp's Keystone XL to find enough shippers.

"One pipeline is within (oil sands) projects already under construction," said University of Alberta energy economist Andrew Leach. "Where it gets more speculative is if you get beyond one pipeline then your case starts to depend on some incremental growth into the next decade, which is not sanctioned and would not be on anyone's reserve books at this point."

RPT-EXCLUSIVE-Algeria's Sonatrach in talks to begin offshore drilling -source - 路透新闻

{{20170227T070000.839+0000}}RPT-EXCLUSIVE-Algeria's Sonatrach in talks to begin offshore drilling -source(Repeats FEB 26 story, no change to text)

By Lamine Chikhi

ALGIERS, Feb 26 (Reuters) - Algeria's Sonatrach wants to start offshore oil drilling and has begun discussions with U.S. operators Exxon Mobil Corp and Anadarko as well as Italy's Eni , a source at the state energy company told Reuters on Sunday.

The North African OPEC member nation has struggled to attract oil investment in recent years because of tough terms that have made foreign companies wary.

Sonatrach last year began a more flexible approach to bilateral talks with foreign partners.

Low oil prices have also pressured Sonatrach, prompting it to focus on developing production at more mature fields in the southern Sahara and bringing online delayed gas projects. Offshore drilling could offer another area for growth.

"Seismic operations carried out by Sonatrach have shown an interesting potential in the areas including Bejaia and Oran," said the source, who asked not to be identified. Bejaia is an eastern port and Oran is a port city in western Algeria.

Algeria needs the know-how and expertise of major international firms to launch offshore drilling, the source said.

"Foreign partners, including Anadarko, Exxon Mobil and Eni were invited by Sonatrach to provide technical assistance given the experience they acquired in the Gulf of Mexico and deep water in Mozambique," the Sonatrach source said.

"The offshore is complementary to our operations in the south. It will also contribute to boosting our output," the source said.

The source did not give any information on the timing or scale of any offshore projects.

Such details, including when the drilling will start, are expected to be announced soon by Sonatrach's leadership, the source said.

Algeria's earnings from oil and gas fell to $27.5 billion in 2016 from $35.7 billion in 2015 and more than $60 billion in 2014.

Algeria's oil output was previously estimated at 1.1 million barrels per day (bpd) but it has cut production by 50,000 bpd under an agreement between OPEC and non-OPEC producers aimed at raising crude prices.

EXCLUSIVE-Iraq's Kurdistan negotiates $3 bln oil pre-payment deals - 路透新闻

{{20170228T124010.590+0000}}EXCLUSIVE-Iraq's Kurdistan negotiates $3 bln oil pre-payment deals* Fresh deals are with trading houses, Rosneft - minister

* Grace period on repayment of between 3-5 years

* Kurdistan needs funds for battle with ISIS, refugee crisis

By Dmitry Zhdannikov

LONDON, Feb 28 (Reuters) - Iraq's Kurdistan has agreed new deals to borrow $3 billion from trading houses and Russian state oil firm Rosneft that will be guaranteed by future oil sales to strengthen its fiscal position as the semi-autonomous region fights Islamic State.

Kurdistan's natural sources minister Ashti Hawrami told Reuters the new deals had been concluded in recent weeks. The region also negotiated grace periods of between 3 and 5 years for repaying the debt.

Trading houses have been pre-financing Kurdish oil exports for the past two years after the government in Erbil decided to start independent oil exports via Turkey's Mediterranean terminals. Rosneft said last week it would join them. [nR4N1G100S].

Kurdistan says it needs to export oil independently as Baghdad has not paid Erbil its budget share just as the region needs money to fight Islamic State and host Syrian refugees.

Baghdad has said it would sue buyers of Kurdish oil, arguing that the central government was the only legal exporter. The new Baghdad government has softened its stance, however, as it cooperated with Erbil against Islamic State in Mosul.

"This helps our economic independence although it is important to understand that this cannot be achieved just by oil revenues and higher oil prices. We also need to press on with our economic reforms," Hawrami said in an interview in London.

"We have learnt a lot from the oil price shock, the costs of fighting ISIS, and the burden of some 1.8 million refugees coming to our territory... Reform is a must – we have a lot of debts to deal with."

He declined to name the trading houses but market sources have previously identified Vitol, Petraco, Glencore and Trafigura as buyers of Kurdish barrels. Last week, Glencore confirmed it had concluded deals for Kurdish oil. The other trading houses do not comment on their dealings with Kurdistan and Rosneft did not give any details on the size of the deal.

Hawrami said the deals would serve as a hedge against an oil price slide for several years. Previous deals with trading houses have usually lasted 6-12 months.

"It is also positive for the traders as they don't have to renegotiate their contracts every six months," said Hawrami.

"It strengthens our fiscal situation. It means we can pay more regularly to the international oil companies working in Kurdistan and we can invest some money in expanding our oil infrastructure," he said.

Kurdistan's finances suffered badly during the oil price slump of 2015-2016 and it has accumulated several months of arrears to producers such as Genel , DNO and Gulf Keystone due to tight revenues and supply glitches.

"This year we want to avoid repeating this. I'm confident we will do better. We know the producers' needs and plans. We are prioritizing not to fall behind again," Hawrami said.

GROUND BREAKING DEAL

Hawrami said the arrival of Rosneft in addition to trading houses to the marketing of Kurdish barrels was good news for the region as it gave Erbil its first big end-user and opened up new markets - Rosneft has refineries in Germany and India.

"We hope Rosneft's deal will become a ground breaker for other majors," he said adding Rosneft was also looking at exploration blocks in Kurdistan.

He also said relations with Baghdad were improving.

"We didn't hear any negative comments from them after the deal with Rosneft. They know we are selling our oil. And actually if we help each other rather than hindering progress, we can both achieve better prices as buyers will not be able to seek unreasonable discounts."

He also said the fact that Erbil was now selling some barrels for Baghdad from the northern Kirkuk field was evidence of improving relations.

"In reality, Baghdad has given us some share of oil to export. So we have an arrangement that we both honour. We have real cooperation and we hope to build on that," he said.

INFRASTRUCTURE EXPANSION

Kurdistan's existing pipelines can handle just over 650,000 barrels per day of exports and more investments are needed to bring that capacity to 1 million bpd, including upgrading of pumping stations, said Hawrami.

He said pipeline capacity should be expanded by the year-end but production would not start rising until next year.

"We have to be mindful about supply and demand. You tell me what the oil price is going to be and I will tell you when we could reach 1 million bpd of output. Investments have dried up in the last two years because of the oil price crash and attacks by ISIS," he said.

Kurdistan is planning to offer some 20 blocks of land for exploration to investors. The region took some blocks back from investors after discovering they did little exploration, said Hawrami without naming the companies.

Some operators relinquished blocks as they were disappointed with what they found, including U.S. oil giant Exxon Mobil which has given back three blocks out of six over the past year.

Hawrami said he did not see this as a set back.

"Exxon has concluded that they will continue working on 3 blocks while on another three the potential reserves were simply not big enough for them. Those blocks could suit other firms. We are now looking to farm them out," he said.

Nigeria's crude oil exports to slip in April - loading plans - 路透新闻

{{20170228T123735.667+0000}}Nigeria's crude oil exports to slip in April - loading plansLONDON, Feb 28 (Reuters) - Nigeria's April crude oil exports
are on track to drop by just over 100,000 barrels per day (bpd)
in April from the previous month, according to loading
programmes compiled by Reuters on Tuesday.

The exports of 1.54 million bpd, on 50 cargoes, are down
from a revised March programme that included 1.65 million bpd on
56 cargoes. The biggest month-on-month decline was in Qua Iboe,
Nigeria's largest oil stream.

Qua Iboe exports in March were revised higher to 11 cargoes,
four more than the 7 planned to load in April, due to loading
delays that have pushed February exports back. Field operator
Exxon Mobil has reissued the export programme for Qua Iboe
several times this year, though the reason for the problems was
not immediately clear. [nL5N1FL5VW]

The company dealt with strike action in late December that
impacted its production, and also had to deal with the closure
of the main pipeline that exports the oil. [nL8N1BR2QM]

Agbami, Amenam, Brass River and Erha were also set to load
fewer cargoes in April, despite a respite in militant attacks in
the Delta region and the lifting by ENI of force majeure on
Brass River. Antan, which has field maintenance, will not export
any cargoes in April.

Exports of Bonga were set to climb to 4 cargoes, from just
one in March, as operator Shell completed field maintenance,
traders said. There were also more cargoes of Bonny Light,
Escravos, Owkwori and Usan.

April's exports will also include four cargoes of Akpo
condensate, for a total of 133,000 bpd, the same total as March
but slightly higher on a bpd basis due to the shorter month in
April.

CORRECTED-UPDATE 1-Oil and gas producer Apache to spend 63.2 pct more this year - 路透新闻

{{20170227T164125.572+0000}}CORRECTED-UPDATE 1-Oil and gas producer Apache to spend 63.2 pct more this year(In Feb. 23 story, removes reference in paragraph 7 to Chevron raising its budget for the year. Chevron had cut its budget.)

Feb 23 (Reuters) - Oil and gas producer Apache Corp said it would spend 63.2 percent more in 2017 than it did last year, joining a growing list of U.S. shale producers who are ramping up spending to take advantage of a recovery in oil prices.

Apache, which reported a smaller loss on Thursday, plans to spend $3.1 billion in 2017, higher than the $1.9 billion it spent last year.

The company said it would spend nearly two-thirds of its budget in Texas' Permian Basin, of which $500 million is budgeted for infrastructure development in the so-called Alpine High field.

Total production was nearly unchanged at 490,376 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the fourth quarter.

Apache said last September it had amassed more than 300,000 acres in the field it calls Alpine High, most of which is in Reeves County, Texas.

U.S. crude prices, which dipped to a low of $26.05 last year have largely traded above $50 since late November.

This has prompted producers such as Exxon Mobil and Hess Corp to boost their capital budgets for the year.

Net loss attributable to Apache's common shareholders was $182 million, or 48 cents per share, in the three months ended Dec. 31. (http://bit.ly/2moGRY9)

The company had posted a loss of $4.02 billion, or $10.62 per share, a year earlier, when it incurred one-time charges of $5.9 billion.

The Houston-based company's total revenue fell about 2 percent to $1.45 billion.

RPT-ANALYSIS-Canada energy sector sidelined as Big Oil chases fatter profits - 路透新闻

{{20170227T130103.995+0000}}RPT-ANALYSIS-Canada energy sector sidelined as Big Oil chases fatter profits(Repeats late Friday story with no changes to text)

By Nia Williams

CALGARY, Alberta, Feb 24 (Reuters) - Canada's energy sector has fallen out of favor with international oil majors, who are scaling back ambitions and walking away from reserves in the ground there to focus on lower-cost and higher-margin opportunities elsewhere.

Billion-dollar bets on Canada's oil sands went sour this week for Exxon Mobil Corp and Conoco Phillips . Between them, the two companies erased from their books nearly 5 billion barrels of bitumen, the heavy, viscous oil found under Alberta's boreal forest. This has wiped about $250 billion worth of oil from their reserves. [nL1N1G61S7] [nL1N1G723D]

Conoco has put $2 billion of Canadian natural gas assets on the block. [nL1N1G1140]

The companies joined the list of foreign players to take a hit in a Canadian energy patch where a two-year slump in global oil prices has discouraged the high investments needed to get projects off the ground.

While crude prices have recovered to above $50 a barrel from a low of $26 a year ago, that is not enough to make Canada's oil sands profitable. Even some of Canada's conventional energy plays are expensive at current crude prices.

Canadian producer Husky Energy Inc , owned by Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing, is weighing the sale of some Eastern Canadian offshore crude assets, people familiar with the matter told Reuters. [nL1N1G916U]

The oil sands have caused energy companies the most pain.

Devon Energy Corp Chief Executive Officer Dave Hager summed up the problem this month when discussing the Pike oil sands project, which awaits a company decision later this year.

"We like the project a lot, but ... it's a little bit lower return than our well-oriented programs here in the U.S.," Hager told analysts on an earnings call.

Hager cited capital costs and uncertain future prices as factors behind the wariness of sinking funds into projects that take four years to build. Shale plays need less investment, produce cheaper oil and often provide a fatter return within months.

President Donald Trump is also expected to loosen U.S. regulations for oil and gas companies, while the Canadian government has been planning a carbon tax.

Statoil ASA sold its oil sands project and leases to Calgary-based Athabasca Oil Corp . CNOOC-owned <0883.HK> Nexen shut down its oil sands upgrader. Royal Dutch Shell abandoned its 80,000 barrel per day Carmon Creek project, taking a $2 billion write-down.

"The oil sands are not as sexy as they used to be," said GMP FirstEnergy analyst Martin King. "The focus is on the United States - there are more immediate returns and lower drilling costs."

In the days of $100 a barrel crude, and before the U.S. shale revolution, the oil sands were a red-hot play for investors, offering huge reserves, low decline rates and a stable political climate.

Between 2005 and 2015 foreign direct investment in Canada's oil industry more than doubled to C$130 billion ($99.19 billion) from C$50 billion, according to Statistics Canada data. That slowed in 2015 as the crude price rout deepened.

"You would assume it's still slowing down based on lower prices," said economist Carlos Murillo of the Conference Board of Canada.

RS Energy Group analyst Rob Bedin noted that Suncor Energy's Fort Hills, the last of the oil sands mega-projects, needs U.S. crude prices around $100 a barrel to break even, compared with $40-$45 a barrel for shale plays in the Midland Basin, Texas.

While oil sands growth is expected to slow dramatically, production is not expected to drop. Projects there, once built, are viewed as a useful addition to companies' portfolios. Day-to-day operating costs are reasonably low and they produce for decades.

Two years ago, producer forecasts of 2026 oil sands production totalled 6 million bpd, according to RS Energy research, up from 2.5 million bpd currently.

Last year producers dropped that 2026 forecast to 5 million bpd, but RS Energy analysis suggests 3.5 billion bpd is more realistic once company finances are taken into account.

BACK-YARD RESOURCE

The fate of growth in the oil sands is primarily in the hands of the domestic Canadian producers like Suncor Energy and MEG Energy , which are still intent on developing their back-yard crude resource through improved technology and carefully planned small-scale expansions.

Canadian reserve reporting rules, which allow the use of price forecasts from reserve evaluation firms, help domestic oil sands producers maintain a more positive outlook. The United States requires producers to report reserves based on last year's prices.

Still, there are concerns even for oil sands specialists. These include low crude prices, environmental opposition to building new pipelines and government carbon emissions caps.

Lack of pipeline capacity has in the past left crude bottlenecked in Alberta, but now that three major projects are finally moving forward there are doubts about whether there will be enough volume to fill them.

Enbridge Inc CEO Al Monaco said two pipelines should suffice based on the current supply outlook, and the latest cuts in reserves may make it harder for projects like TransCanada Corp's Keystone XL to find enough shippers.

"One pipeline is within (oil sands) projects already under construction," said University of Alberta energy economist Andrew Leach. "Where it gets more speculative is if you get beyond one pipeline then your case starts to depend on some incremental growth into the next decade, which is not sanctioned and would not be on anyone's reserve books at this point."

{{20170227T070000.839+0000}}RPT-EXCLUSIVE-Algeria's Sonatrach in talks to begin offshore drilling -source(Repeats FEB 26 story, no change to text)

By Lamine Chikhi

ALGIERS, Feb 26 (Reuters) - Algeria's Sonatrach wants to start offshore oil drilling and has begun discussions with U.S. operators Exxon Mobil Corp and Anadarko as well as Italy's Eni , a source at the state energy company told Reuters on Sunday.

The North African OPEC member nation has struggled to attract oil investment in recent years because of tough terms that have made foreign companies wary.

Sonatrach last year began a more flexible approach to bilateral talks with foreign partners.

Low oil prices have also pressured Sonatrach, prompting it to focus on developing production at more mature fields in the southern Sahara and bringing online delayed gas projects. Offshore drilling could offer another area for growth.

"Seismic operations carried out by Sonatrach have shown an interesting potential in the areas including Bejaia and Oran," said the source, who asked not to be identified. Bejaia is an eastern port and Oran is a port city in western Algeria.

Algeria needs the know-how and expertise of major international firms to launch offshore drilling, the source said.

"Foreign partners, including Anadarko, Exxon Mobil and Eni were invited by Sonatrach to provide technical assistance given the experience they acquired in the Gulf of Mexico and deep water in Mozambique," the Sonatrach source said.

"The offshore is complementary to our operations in the south. It will also contribute to boosting our output," the source said.

The source did not give any information on the timing or scale of any offshore projects.

Such details, including when the drilling will start, are expected to be announced soon by Sonatrach's leadership, the source said.

Algeria's earnings from oil and gas fell to $27.5 billion in 2016 from $35.7 billion in 2015 and more than $60 billion in 2014.

Algeria's oil output was previously estimated at 1.1 million barrels per day (bpd) but it has cut production by 50,000 bpd under an agreement between OPEC and non-OPEC producers aimed at raising crude prices.

Wall Street challenges U.S. regulator over proposed commodities rule - 路透新闻

{{20170221T174930.580+0000}}Wall Street challenges U.S. regulator over proposed commodities ruleBy Olivia Oran

Feb 21 (Reuters) - Wall Street is pushing back against a proposed rule to force U.S. banks like Goldman Sachs Group Inc to hold more capital against investments in commodities, placing what some see as an overly restrictive limit on banks' ties to the sector.

In a comment letter filed late on Friday and not yet made public, the industry argues the proposed rule would hurt the economy, and that fears about environmental risks from physical commodities activities are overblown.

The U.S. Federal Reserve handed down the proposal in September, after a public backlash stemming from the belief that big banks' involvement in commodities markets hurt consumers by driving up prices.

The comment letter, filed by the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association and the Institution of International Bankers and seen by Reuters, comes as big banks face an uncertain future in Washington. Even though President Donald Trump has said he favors deregulation and has hired several Wall Street executives as advisers, it is unclear how he or the new Congress will approach various rules.

Apart from Goldman Sachs, few banks have large exposure to physical commodities any longer. At one time, it was a big and lucrative business for both Goldman and Morgan Stanley , due to a quirk in their regulatory structure. Other banks, including JPMorgan Chase & Co , eventually plunged into the business as well, but exited as global capital requirements got more onerous, making such investments too costly to maintain.

The Fed's proposed rule would formalize and increase those standards, imposing what it has called a 1,250 percent risk weighting on banks that own, trade and move physical commodities. Among other measures, $1 in capital would need to be held for every $1 investment, the regulator's highest charge for the riskiest investments.

The rule could potentially force banks to withdraw from the commodities business altogether, because such capital charges would severely depress returns.

In its proposal, the Fed said new measures would shield banks and the broader financial system from a costly mishap like the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. Advocates say the rule is also needed to help mitigate commodity price fluctuations and social conflicts that arise from commodity-related activities.

In the letter filed on Friday, the bank-affiliated groups said the rule would hurt "competition, end users, the liquidity of commodities markets ... and thus the real economy." A number of utility and power companies, including Calpine Corp , have also cited liquidity and price concerns.

Big banks have been using similar arguments in lobbying to roll back existing rules, including the Volcker rule limiting risky, speculative trading and the Durbin rule, which caps the fees they can charge retailers for processing debit card transactions. [nIFR8tqrNf] [nL1N1FT1R2]

Industry sources say the fight against the Fed's proposal is more about regaining a competitive edge than protecting an existing source of revenue.

Between 2007 and 2009, commodities trading accounted for as much as one-fifth of revenue for Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs.

But over the past five years, Morgan Stanley has decreased its physical commodity assets to $179 million from $9.7 billion. Goldman Sachs has shed much of its energy infrastructure as well, though it is still a major trader of fossil fuels, trading more natural gas than both Chevron Corp and ExxonMobil Corp in certain quarters, according to Natural Gas Intelligence.

As regulated banks have scaled back, specialists like Glencore Plc , Vitol Group and Mercuria Energy Group have gained ground.

UPDATE 3-Singapore carbon tax would hit refiners, help renewables - 路透新闻

{{20170221T101604.502+0000}}UPDATE 3-Singapore carbon tax would hit refiners, help renewables* Proposed carbon tax would deal blow to refineries

* Singapore is main regional oil trading hub

* Could indicate longer-term shift to cleaner energy

(Adds comment from environmental group)

By Jessica Jaganathan and Henning Gloystein

SINGAPORE, Feb 21 (Reuters) - Singapore's proposed plan to tax greenhouse gas emissions would probably hit oil refiners hard, ramping up costs in an industry that has been central to the city-state's rapid development over the last half-century.

Monday's announcement that a carbon tax on direct emitters is to be introduced from 2019 shows that Singapore, Asia's main oil trading hub, could be moving towards a longer-term future dominated by cleaner technology and resources. [nL4N1G230P]

"It is the first time in the history of Singapore that a budget has placed such a high emphasis on green initiatives linked to tax revenues," said Isabella Loh, chairman of the Singapore Environment Council, an independent non-profit body.

"The announcement clearly underpins the priority of a future-ready and greener economy."

Countries around the world have been under increasing pressure to crack down on carbon emissions, with Singapore part of the historic Paris climate accord that went into force late last year.

In parts of Europe and countries such as Australia, the introduction of carbon taxes or carbon trading schemes has often driven a decline in established refining industries and a parallel surge in investment in clean energy technology.

"The proposed carbon tax on emitters would prove a significant drag on industry profit-margins," said Peter Lee, oil and gas analyst at BMI Research in Singapore.

The government said the carbon tax would probably cover 30 to 40 "large direct emitters" including power stations, petrochemical facilities and semiconductor makers.

But it is Singapore's three refineries, run by ExxonMobil , Royal Dutch Shell and Singapore Refining Company, that would probably need to brace for the hardest blow.

The tax proposal comes as those refineries, with a combined fuel generation capacity of around 1.38 million barrels per day (bpd), grapple with rising competition from China, India and the Middle East .

Shell said in a statement it supported a strong and stable government-led carbon price, but that any policy "must ensure companies can compete effectively with others in the region who are not subject to the same levels of carbon dioxide costs".

Exxon said "effective policies are those that promote global participation (and) let market prices drive the selection of solutions".

Singapore Refining Company could not be reached for comment.

Looking at a carbon tax rate of S$10 to $20 ($7 to $14) per tonne, the government estimated that would add around $3.50 to $7 to the cost of processing a barrel of crude into fuels like diesel or gasoline.

Benchmark crude prices stood around $56 per barrel on Tuesday, translating to a daily surplus cost of $4.8 million to $9.7 million for the three Singapore refineries.

On the flip side, the tax would help fire growth in Singapore's nascent renewable energy industries.

"Existing green projects, such as solar, will enjoy the much needed premium (as they are not taxed)," said Andrew Koscharsky, energy director at RCMA Group, which trades wholesale power and retail electricity in Singapore.

It would be important to adopt the law swiftly to encourage immediate investment in renewables, he added.

Singapore's government will next month invite feedback on its proposals from industry and the public. ($1=1.4 Singapore dollars)

RPT-ANALYSIS-U.S. shale oil braces for the unfamiliar in 2017: inflation - 路透新闻

{{20170220T070001.349+0000}}RPT-ANALYSIS-U.S. shale oil braces for the unfamiliar in 2017: inflation(Repeats for additional clients with no changes to text)

By Swetha Gopinath and Arathy S Nair

Feb 17 (Reuters) - U.S. shale producers are facing their first production cost increase in five years in 2017 as industry activity picks up and energy service providers hike fees to take a bigger share of the profits generated by higher oil prices.

Drilling innovations over the past decade have generated a dizzying reduction in the cost of pumping oil from shale formations across the United States - the world's largest energy consumer - triggering an energy revolution and a production boom.

When that boom ended with the onset of a two-year global price war in 2014, shale producers responded with even deeper cost cuts. Technological breakthroughs allowed producers to wring more oil from the rock and halved the per-barrel price needed to turn a profit.

But for the first time since 2012, shale producers will see a rise in break-even production costs this year, according to data from Rystad Energy, which surveys producers. The per-barrel costs will rise an average of $1.60 across the shale patch to $36.50.

For a chart of the fall and recent rise of shale oil production costs, see: http://tmsnrt.rs/2lxKeeX

The drive to lower costs has run its course for now, and service firms are leveraging power in the more crowded oilfields, such as the Permian basin in West Texas, to eke out higher payments from producers.

Firms that supply rigs, crews, technological expertise are clamoring to take back discounts they extended during the slump, in some cases asking for between 10 percent and 15 percent more as the number of rigs and crews deployed in the fields rises.

Producers expect that to continue.

"In the Permian, activity has picked up, and going forward we would expect to see some pressure," Chevron Corp's Chief Executive John Watson said on an earnings call last month.

Oil service providers acknowledge, however, that their price hikes may not stick until drillers generate enough demand to burn through the remaining spare capacity in the oil service sector.

In a securities filing on Feb. 8, service provider Baker Hughes Inc cautioned that drilling "activity needs to increase meaningfully before excess service capacity can be substantially absorbed and meaningful pricing recovery takes place."

PERMANENT COST SAVINGS

Service inflation represents only a fraction of the expected rise in international crude prices this year. A Reuters poll of 31 analysts and economists forecast benchmark U.S. oil prices will average $56.08 per barrel in 2017, up from $43.47 last year.

Between half and two-thirds of the cost savings achieved during the oil price slump are likely to become permanent even if oil prices tick higher, according to industry experts and company estimates.

Shale companies deployed more rigs than they have done in sixteen months last week [nL1N1FT11T], and have steadily increased the number in the field to take advantage of crude prices that have mostly held at more than $50 per barrel since the world's top oil exporters, both OPEC and non-OPEC, agreed to cut supplies in late November.

A further rise in the oil price could quickly stir drilling activity across the United States, which would in turn accelerate service fee and labor cost inflation. That is a worrying development for an industry that has lately gotten used to costs heading only down.

There were 207 hydraulic fracturing fleets at work in January across the U.S., up 20 percent from last June, according to data from Houston-based Primary Vision, which tracks oilfield service equipment usage.

Pioneer Natural Resources Co has its own fracturing crews, which it hopes will help offset rising service costs elsewhere.

"I believe we will be able to keep our inflation numbers down to more like approximately 5 percent, but the internal plan is to make sure that cost inflation is offset by our efficiency gains," Pioneer Natural Chief Executive Tim Dove said on a post-earnings call earlier this month.

HEDGING AGAINST INFLATION

Other companies have locked in contracts to insulate themselves from the rise in service and labor costs. WPX Energy, a leading shale oil producer in North Dakota and Texas, has sought to protect against price inflation through contracts for sand, stimulant, equipment and services, said CEO Rick Muncrief in an interview.

Other companies including Hess Corp hope to beat the inflation forecasts with yet more efficiency gains.

Hess hopes to wring more barrels out of each well with new techniques that allow it to conduct hydraulic fracturing at 60 spots along a well, up from the usual 50, president Greg Hill said on a conference call last month.

In addition, using more sand and other proppants - used to keep fissures in shale rock open - in the wells should help boost production, Hill said.

Oil producers can already count on many cost savings achieved in recent years, such as reductions in the time it takes to drill wells, said Gürcan Gülen, an energy economist at the Bureau of Economic Geology at the University of Texas at Austin.

"Once you know better how to do things, you're not going to change that when oil prices move higher," said Gülen.

But the possibility of more deep cost reductions are, for the most part, gone.

A number of companies saw break-even costs at the wellhead - the price required to profit from oil at a new well - stagnate between the third and fourth quarters, data from Rystad Energy showed.

"To certain producers, there's a little bit of opportunity to lower costs more," said Bill Costello, a portfolio manager at Westwood Holdings Group. "But those are few and far between."

{{20170218T231449.912+0000}}UPDATE 2-Fire hits California refinery; local gasoline prices could rise(New throughout, adds that refinery unit has been shut down following blaze)

By Erwin Seba

Feb 18 (Reuters) - An explosion and fire at an oil refinery in Torrance, California, on Saturday forced the partial shutdown of the plant, leading oil traders to expect a spike this week in West Coast gasoline prices.

Police and the plant owner said no one was hurt in the fire, which was extinguished by local firefighters.

Two years ago, a fire at the same plant led to its closure for several months and a sustained increase in West Coast gasoline prices for more than a year. After the fire on Saturday, a group of local residents worried about pollution and accidents protested at the refinery. The event had been planned to mark the anniversary of the Feb. 18, 2015 incident.

Catherine Leys, one of the protesters, lives 1.4 miles from the plant and said industrial ash drifted down on the playground near her home after the 2015 blast.

The plant supplies 10 percent of California's gasoline. Traders said they expected local gasoline prices to jump this week.

"I expect prices will be firming on Tuesday, maybe 5 cents or 15 cents a gallon," a West Coast refined products trader said. He was talking about wholesale gasoline prices in the Los Angeles market. In California, pump prices normally follow wholesale price movements within hours.

PBF Energy owns and operates the refinery in the city of Torrance, just outside Los Angeles. PBF purchased it from Exxon Mobil Corp in 2016.

PBF shuttered the plant's crude distillation unit after the pre-dawn blaze, energy industry intelligence service Genscape reported.

The unit refines 155,000 barrels of oil per day, turning it into gasoline and diesel among other products.

PBF told state regulators it was forced to use its safety flare system on an emergency basis after the incident.

The crude distillation unit, which produces motor fuel, is the workhorse of the refinery. Within 24 hours of the Feb. 18, 2015 explosion, wholesale gasoline prices initially jumped 10 cents a gallon.

A RAND study found drivers ultimately paid an extra $2.4 billion for gasoline because of the 2015 Torrance refinery outage.

The Torrance refinery had at least two outages in 2016 after a power outage at a local utility knocked the facility offline. In October, PBF received a violation notice from the California's air regulator for excessive flaring following one of the outages. [nL1N1CK0WF]

California gasoline prices are frequently among the highest in the United States. Only Hawaii residents pay more.

California requires cleaner-burning fuel than most other U.S. states do. The state is geographically isolated with no pipeline connections to major refining centers on the Gulf Coast and Midwest, leaving the market tightly balanced between what West Coast refineries can produce and what can be shipped in.

ANALYSIS-U.S. shale oil braces for the unfamiliar in 2017: inflation - 路透新闻

{{20170217T151326.369+0000}}ANALYSIS-U.S. shale oil braces for the unfamiliar in 2017: inflationBy Swetha Gopinath and Arathy S Nair

Feb 17 (Reuters) - U.S. shale producers are facing their first production cost increase in five years in 2017 as industry activity picks up and energy service providers hike fees to take a bigger share of the profits generated by higher oil prices.

Drilling innovations over the past decade have generated a dizzying reduction in the cost of pumping oil from shale formations across the United States - the world's largest energy consumer - triggering an energy revolution and a production boom.

When that boom ended with the onset of a two-year global price war in 2014, shale producers responded with even deeper cost cuts. Technological breakthroughs allowed producers to wring more oil from the rock and halved the per-barrel price needed to turn a profit.

But for the first time since 2012, shale producers will see a rise in break-even production costs this year, according to data from Rystad Energy, which surveys producers. The per-barrel costs will rise an average of $1.60 across the shale patch to $36.50.

For a chart of the fall and recent rise of shale oil production costs, see: http://tmsnrt.rs/2lxKeeX

The drive to lower costs has run its course for now, and service firms are leveraging power in the more crowded oilfields, such as the Permian basin in West Texas, to eke out higher payments from producers.

Firms that supply rigs, crews, technological expertise are clamoring to take back discounts they extended during the slump, in some cases asking for between 10 percent and 15 percent more as the number of rigs and crews deployed in the fields rises.

Producers expect that to continue.

"In the Permian, activity has picked up, and going forward we would expect to see some pressure," Chevron Corp's Chief Executive John Watson said on an earnings call last month.

Oil service providers acknowledge, however, that their price hikes may not stick until drillers generate enough demand to burn through the remaining spare capacity in the oil service sector.

In a securities filing on Feb. 8, service provider Baker Hughes Inc cautioned that drilling "activity needs to increase meaningfully before excess service capacity can be substantially absorbed and meaningful pricing recovery takes place."

PERMANENT COST SAVINGS

Service inflation represents only a fraction of the expected rise in international crude prices this year. A Reuters poll of 31 analysts and economists forecast benchmark U.S. oil prices will average $56.08 per barrel in 2017, up from $43.47 last year.

Between half and two-thirds of the cost savings achieved during the oil price slump are likely to become permanent even if oil prices tick higher, according to industry experts and company estimates.

Shale companies deployed more rigs than they have done in sixteen months last week [nL1N1FT11T], and have steadily increased the number in the field to take advantage of crude prices that have mostly held at more than $50 per barrel since the world's top oil exporters, both OPEC and non-OPEC, agreed to cut supplies in late November.

A further rise in the oil price could quickly stir drilling activity across the United States, which would in turn accelerate service fee and labor cost inflation. That is a worrying development for an industry that has lately gotten used to costs heading only down.

There were 207 hydraulic fracturing fleets at work in January across the U.S., up 20 percent from last June, according to data from Houston-based Primary Vision, which tracks oilfield service equipment usage.

Pioneer Natural Resources Co has its own fracturing crews, which it hopes will help offset rising service costs elsewhere.

"I believe we will be able to keep our inflation numbers down to more like approximately 5 percent, but the internal plan is to make sure that cost inflation is offset by our efficiency gains," Pioneer Natural Chief Executive Tim Dove said on a post-earnings call earlier this month.

HEDGING AGAINST INFLATION

Other companies have locked in contracts to insulate themselves from the rise in service and labor costs. WPX Energy, a leading shale oil producer in North Dakota and Texas, has sought to protect against price inflation through contracts for sand, stimulant, equipment and services, said CEO Rick Muncrief in an interview.

Other companies including Hess Corp hope to beat the inflation forecasts with yet more efficiency gains.

Hess hopes to wring more barrels out of each well with new techniques that allow it to conduct hydraulic fracturing at 60 spots along a well, up from the usual 50, president Greg Hill said on a conference call last month.

In addition, using more sand and other proppants - used to keep fissures in shale rock open - in the wells should help boost production, Hill said.

Oil producers can already count on many cost savings achieved in recent years, such as reductions in the time it takes to drill wells, said Gürcan Gülen, an energy economist at the Bureau of Economic Geology at the University of Texas at Austin.

"Once you know better how to do things, you're not going to change that when oil prices move higher," said Gülen.

But the possibility of more deep cost reductions are, for the most part, gone.

A number of companies saw break-even costs at the wellhead - the price required to profit from oil at a new well - stagnate between the third and fourth quarters, data from Rystad Energy showed.

"To certain producers, there's a little bit of opportunity to lower costs more," said Bill Costello, a portfolio manager at Westwood Holdings Group. "But those are few and far between."

Tillerson à Bonn pour le G20 et pour rencontrer Lavrov - 路透新闻

{{20170216T063100.176+0000}}Tillerson à Bonn pour le G20 et pour rencontrer Lavrovpar Lesley Wroughton

WASHINGTON, 16 février (Reuters) - Rex Tillerson est jeudi à Bonn, en Allemagne, pour son premier voyage à l'étranger en tant que chef de la diplomatie des Etats-Unis à l'occasion d'une réunion des pays du G20, et il s'entretiendra dans la journée avec le ministre russe des Affaires étrangères, Sergueï Lavrov.

Si le message "America First" ("L'Amérique d'abord") du président Donald Trump suscite de nombreuses interrogations à l'étranger, plusieurs responsables américains préviennent que ce déplacement de deux jours en Europe du nouveau secrétaire d'Etat sera avant tout consacré à écouter les partenaires des Etats-Unis au sein du Groupe des Vingt.

Dans le cadre de la préparation du sommet du G20 à Hambourg début juillet, le secrétaire d'Etat participera également à des sessions de discussions sur le nouvel ordre mondial, la coopération avec les pays africains et la prévention des conflits.

Ancien PDG de la compagnie pétrolière Exxon Mobil et novice en politique, Rex Tillerson rencontrera à Bonn ses homologues britannique, saoudien, turc, italien et du sultanat d'Oman et il participera à des réunions sur la Syrie et le Yémen, ont précisé des responsables du département d'Etat.

Il s'entretiendra en outre pour la première fois en tant que chef de la diplomatie américaine avec le ministre russe des Affaires étrangères, Sergueï Lavrov.

Après la démission mardi du conseiller à la sécurité nationale de Donald Trump, Michael Flynn, affaibli par des révélations sur des conversations avec l'ambassadeur russe à Washington avant sa prise de fonctions, les relations avec Moscou de l'administration Trump sont au centre de l'attention.

Jusqu'à sa démission, Flynn était le principal interlocuteur de nombreux ambassadeurs étrangers aux Etats-Unis.

"La conversation avec M. Lavrov sera très importante", a estimé un responsable du département d'Etat avant le départ de Tillerson pour Bonn. Le secrétaire d'Etat poursuivra "une coopération pragmatique et constructive dans les zones où nos intérêts se rejoignent", a-t-il ajouté.

Dans le sillage de Tillerson, le vice-président Mike Pence se rendra à Bruxelles et au forum annuel de Munich sur les politiques de défense ce week-end.

Pour les alliés de l'Otan de Washington, cette visite est vue comme une opportunité de clarifier la politique étrangère de l'administration Trump après le départ de Flynn.

Mercredi, le secrétaire américain à la Défense, Jim Mattis, a appelé les pays membres de l'Alliance atlantique à honorer leurs obligations financières dans le domaine de la défense, sous peine de voir les Etats-Unis "modérer" leur soutien à l'alliance. [nL8N1G05O0]

UPDATE 1-Tillerson arrives in Bonn amid questions over U.S. foreign policy - 路透新闻

{{20170215T230333.990+0000}}UPDATE 1-Tillerson arrives in Bonn amid questions over U.S. foreign policy(Recasts with Tillerson arrival in Bonn, comments on Russia meetings)

By Lesley Wroughton

WASHINGTON, Feb 15 (Reuters) - Rex Tillerson arrived in Bonn on Wednesday on his maiden foreign trip as U.S. secretary of state to attend a summit of G20 top economies at a time when many are wondering how far President Donald Trump's "America First" message will reshape U.S. foreign policy.

From North Korean provocations and reports Russia has deployed a new cruise missile, to concerns about China's actions in the South China Sea and conflicts in Yemen, Syria and Ukraine, there is no shortage of global challenges.

Tillerson did not make any remarks on his arrival in Bonn.

Senior U.S. officials said Tillerson's two-day trip was mostly to listen to what G20 counterparts had to say, conceding that this might frustrate some.

Tillerson will also participate in a series of sessions on a shifting global order, cooperation with Africa and conflict prevention. It will be a prelude to the G20 leaders summit in Hamburg, Germany in July, which Trump is due to attend.

"I think he is mostly going on a listening tour," said a U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity, saying that may disappoint U.S. allies. "If our (guy) says, 'well, I am just here to listen,' that's going to be dispiriting."

U.S. allies worry about Trump's unpredictability. They wonder how far he will go in warning China and Iran about their behavior, whether he will back out of long-standing treaties and trade deals, tear up the nuclear agreement with Iran, build a border wall with Mexico, or cozy up to Moscow.

Tillerson, the former Exxon Mobil CEO, has international business experience but none in government. State Department officials said he would meet with counterparts from Britain, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Italy and Oman while in Bonn, and participate in larger meetings on Yemen and Syria.

He also will hold his first meeting as secretary of state with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov at a time when Trump administration contacts with Moscow are under the spotlight with the resignation of national security adviser Michael Flynn.

"The conversation with Mr. Lavrov will be a very important one," a senior State Department official said, speaking to reporters ahead of Tillerson's departure.

During his meeting with Lavrov on Thursday, Tillerson will seek "pragmatic and constructive cooperation in areas where our interests overlap," the official said.

"The obvious ones which have been discussed many times are counter-ISIS and counterterrorism would be areas that the Secretary would hope to develop some possible avenues for cooperation," the official said. He will also press Russia to fully implement the Minsk peace accords to end violence in eastern Ukraine.

The G20 is made up of developed economies and emerging nations such as China, India, Indonesia, Mexico, South Africa and Brazil.

Jim Wilkinson, a senior adviser to former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, said it was vital for Tillerson to establish a relationship with fellow ministers during his first trip.

"That chemistry with counterparts begins on the first trip," he said. "Secretary Tillerson and his counterparts will be working on some of the toughest issues around the world and that's going to require trust."

While Tillerson has been on the job for just two weeks and may not be immersed in all subjects yet, Wilkinson said: "Foreign ministers will be understanding that in the early days he may not have all the answers, but they will want to know they have a conduit to someone who can speak for the U.S."

WASHINGTON, Feb 15 (Reuters) - Rex Tillerson left on his maiden foreign trip as U.S. secretary of state on Wednesday, heading to Bonn to interact with counterparts from the G20 top economies at a time many are wondering how far President Donald Trump's "America First" message will reshape U.S. foreign policy.

From North Korean provocations to fresh reports that Russia has deployed a new cruise missile, concerns about China's aggressions in the South China Sea, and conflicts in Yemen, Syria and Ukraine, there is no shortage of global challenges.

HOUSTON, Feb 14 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp plans to restart a gasoline-producing fluidic catalytic cracking unit this week, perhaps as early as Thursday, at its 502,500 barrel per day (bpd) Baton Rouge, Louisiana, refinery, said sources familiar with plant operations on Tuesday.

An Exxon spokeswoman declined to discuss operations at the Baton Rouge refinery.

The refinery's two 110,000 bpd FCCUs are shut for planned overhauls. The first FCCU was shut on Jan. 9 and the second on Jan. 27. Both cat crackers are expected to be back in production by the end of February.

(Adds losses to oil militancy)

By Tife Owolabi

PORT HARCOURT, Nigeria, Feb 14 (Reuters) - Nigeria needs to offer work to people who make a living from illegally refining oil in the Niger Delta to achieve peace there, Vice President Yemi Osinbajo said on Tuesday.

The government has been holding talks with militants to end attacks on oil pipelines which cost the country up to $100 billion in lost oil revenues in 2016, Oil Minister Emmanuel Ibe Kachikwu said in a video on his Facebook page.

But a military crackdown on thousands of illegal refineries in the southern swamps, which process crude oil stolen from oil majors and state oil firm NNPC, has raised tensions again.

Illicit refineries process stolen crude in makeshift, blackened structures of pipes and metal tanks hidden in oil-soaked clearings deep in the Niger Delta's thick bush land.

"Our approach to that is that we must engage them (illegal refiners) by establishing modular refineries so that they can participate in legal refineries," Osinbajo said during a visit to Rivers state, part of the Delta region.

"We have recognised that young men must be properly engaged," he said, without giving details.

He also said the government would make more provisions for an amnesty scheme for former militants who laid down arms in 2009 in exchange for cash stipends and job training.

Illegal refining is one of the few businesses flourishing in an otherwise desolate region, as petrol is scarce in Nigeria due to the country's derelict state refineries.

Authorities had originally cut the budget for cash payments to militants to end corruption but later resumed payments to stop surging pipeline attacks which cut output by 700,000 barrels a day for several months last year.

"We have to make more provisions for amnesty and provisions for social intervention," Osinbajo told residents of Port Harcourt, the region's major city. He has been visiting the Niger Delta since last month to calm tensions.

The militants and residents who sympathise with them say they want a greater share of Nigeria's oil wealth to go to the impoverished region.

Crude sales make up about 70 percent of government revenue and the attacks have deepened an economic crisis brought about by low global oil prices.

Nigeria's oil production climbed to 1.576 million bpd in January, roughly 102,000 bpd higher than December, according to secondary sources in a monthly OPEC report released on Monday

Osinbajo put total oil output last month at between 1.7 million bpd and 1.8 million bpd down from the 2.2 million bpd at the start of 2016.

TABLE-Traders rush to export U.S. crude on better economics - 路透新闻

{{20170213T181059.377+0000}}TABLE-Traders rush to export U.S. crude on better economicsFeb 13 (Reuters) - Oil majors and trading houses are rushing to export an unprecedented volume of U.S. crude this month
after the opening of the export window to Asia.

Traders estimate that some 700,000 to 900,000 barrels per day is set to leave the United States in February, with the
majority to Asia. A number of vessels are also going to Latin America and Europe.

The economics became favorable after Brent's premium over U.S. crude widened to the most in nearly a year. Also, the
widening differential for Dubai over U.S. crude also opened the arbitrage to the Far East.

BUZZ-S&P energy earnings on the comeback trail - 路透新闻

{{20170209T180243.699+0000}}BUZZ-S&P energy earnings on the comeback trail** S&P 500 energy co earnings are slowly coming out of their long stretch of quarterly declines, but remain among the weakest sectors this reporting period

** With results in from about half the cos in the sector, Q4 S&P 500 energy company earnings <.SPNY> are now on track to be about flat from a year ago, Thomson Reuters data shows

** While the Q4 estimate for the group has improved since mid-January, when the sector's earnings were projected to have fallen 2.1 pct, it is still well below the 4.9 pct growth projected for the sector at the start of the year

** Another quarterly profit fall for energy would mark the 9th consecutive quarter of yr/yr declines, the data shows

** Earnings for the entire S&P 500 are on track to gain 8.5 pct, the best growth since Q3 2014

** Excluding energy, S&P 500 earnings are estimated to have gained 8.7 pct in Q4

** Just 58 pct of energy cos that have reported have exceeded analysts' estimates vs a 68 pct beat rate for the entire S&P 500

** Some top names in the sector have disappointed investors: Exxon Mobil shares fell 1.1 pct on Jan 31 after posting its lowest quarterly profit since 1999

** But within energy, the biggest drags on earnings so far this reporting period have been results from the oil and gas drilling, as well as oil and gas equipment and services industries

** The S&P energy index was up 0.9 pct on Thurs. Index is down about 4 pct since the start of the yr after rising nearly 7 pct in Q4, thanks to sharp gains following the election

UPDATE 2-Total on hunt for deals after outperforming rivals - 路透新闻

{{20170209T145504.718+0000}}UPDATE 2-Total on hunt for deals after outperforming rivals* Total's Q4 adjusted net profit beats expectations

* CEO says cost savings help outperformance vs peers

* Says scouting for opportunities to snap up assets

(Adds details, peer comparison, background)

By Bate Felix

PARIS, Feb 9 (Reuters) - French oil company Total is on the hunt to buy assets from struggling rivals, it said on Thursday, as it reported some of the biggest profits in the industry for last year and raised its dividend.

Chief Executive Patrick Pouyanne said Total was reaping the benefit of cutting costs more quickly than competitors following the start of an oil price rout in 2014, and of focusing on projects with lower production costs.

"We have the second-best net adjusted profit in the year among oil majors although we don't have the same size of production compared with some of them - we are fifth largest in terms of production," he told reporters.

Total said it made an adjusted net profit of $8.2 billion in 2016 and that on a comparable basis Shell made $7.2 billion, BP $2.6 billion and Chevron $1.8 billion. Only Exxon Mobil made more, with $8.9 billion, Total said.

In the fourth quarter, the French company's net profit rose 16 percent to $2.4 billion, beating analysts' average forecast of $2.3 billion, while the dividend was set at 0.62 euros per share, up from 0.61 euros in the previous three quarters.

"Another resilient set of results from Total, with earnings robust across all segments," Jefferies analysts said in a note.

They have a "hold" rating on the stock, which was up 1.2 percent to 47.4 euros at 1430 GMT.

"We reacted faster than our peers on cutting our costs and we succeeded," Pouyanne said. "We deliberately made the choice to go for projects with very low production costs."

"We did a lot of cost savings. The most spectacular was the average cost of production in exploration and production which was reduced to $5.9 per barrel of oil equivalent (boe), compared with $9.9/boe in 2014 and was the principal reason of our resilience," he said.

Total said it made $2.8 billion of savings in 2016, beating its target of $2.4 billion. It aims to make a further $3.5 billion of savings in 2017 and cut production costs to $5.5/boe.

Pouyanne said the company's downstream business also contributed to the strong performance, with a return on capital employed of over 30 percent, which he said was ahead of the 16-17 percent at peers.

NEW PROJECTS, OPPORTUNITIES

Total's solid balance sheet meant it could look for opportunities to pick up assets, the CEO said, adding the company planned to make final investment decisions on about 10 projects within the next 18 months.

"We are in a field of opportunities," Pouyanne said. "After two years of very low prices, there are companies around the world that have good assets but are struggling."

Total expects to invest $16-$17 billion in 2017, including resource acquisitions, compared with $18.3 billion in 2016.

Production is forecast to grow by more than 4 percent, supporting the company's goal to increase output on average by 5 percent per year from 2014 to 2020.

Pouyanne said the global oil market had not yet rebalanced and inventories were about 10 percent above normal. He added oil prices were likely to remain volatile.

A rebalancing of supply and demand would depend on implementation of the deal to cut output agreed by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and non-OPEC producers, he said.

Total predicted its breakeven oil price would continue to fall, reaching less than $40 per barrel before the dividend, with cash flow from operations expected to cover investments and the cash portion of the dividend at $50 per barrel.

India's Petronet to cut spot LNG cargo purchases in FY 18 - 路透新闻

{{20170209T085740.974+0000}}India's Petronet to cut spot LNG cargo purchases in FY 18Feb 9 (Reuters) - India's biggest gas importer Petronet LNG will cut spot purchases of liquefied natural gas in the next fiscal year as it is getting supplies under a long-term deal with Exxon Mobil Corp for imports from Australia's Gorgon project, the company's chief executive Prabhat Singh said on Thursday.

The first cargo from Gorgon was received in January and it was cheaper than spot prices, he said.

Separately, Petronet LNG's head of finance, RK Garg, said the second LNG cargo from Gorgon is expected to arrive in March.

The company will receive up to 18 LNG cargos from Gorgon in bigger vessels, he said.

Petronet LNG has a long-term contract with Exxon Mobil to buy about 1.5 million tonnes of super-cooled fuel every year.

LEAD 2-Wall Street piétine, pénalisée par l'énergie - 路透新闻

{{20170207T215008.754+0000}}LEAD 2-Wall Street piétine, pénalisée par l'énergie(Actualisé avec dollar, Treasuries)

* L'énergie pèse sur la tendance

* Le Nasdaq parvient tout de même à battre son record

* La dollar grimpe, les rendements des Treasuries reculent

par Lewis Krauskopf

7 février (Reuters) - La Bourse de New York a paru mardi reprendre des couleurs avant de réduire ses gains sous l'effet d'une baisse du secteur de l'énergie pour terminer sans grand changement avec tout de même un record de clôture pour le Nasdaq.

Le Dow Jones a touché un record en séance, des résultats trimestriels bien accueillis paraissant éclipsant pour un temps les inquiétudes liées à la politique protectionniste de Donald Trump.

Les valeurs technologiques, en revanche, ont réalisé de bonnes performances, permettant au Nasdaq de battre son record.

La baisse des cours du pétrole, sous la pression d'une faible demande et de signes indiquant un redémarrage de la production de pétrole de schiste aux Etats-Unis, a ensuite pesé sur la tendance, le secteur de l'énergie <.SPNY> cédant 1,37% avec notamment des reculs de 1,4% pour Chevron et 0,65% pour Exxon Mobil .

L'indice Dow Jones <.DJI> a finalement gagné 37,87 points, soit 0,19%, à 20.090,29, faiblissant après avoir touché un record à 20.118,01.

Le Standard & Poor's 500 <.SPX> a progressé de 0,02% à 2.293,08 et le Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> a pris 0,19% à 5.674,22.

Soutenue pendant deux mois soutenu par les promesses de relance budgétaire, de baisses des impôts et de dérégulation de Donald Trump, Wall Street paraît reprendre son souffle. L'indice S&P-500 n'a ainsi plus fluctué de plus de 1%, à la hausse comme à la baisse, depuis le 7 décembre.

[nL5N1FR3JH]

Sur le plan sectoriel, l'indice S&P des technologiques <.SPLRCT> a pris 0,41%, équilibrant la baisse de l'indice de l'énergie.

Apple (+0,95%) a porté le S&P et le Nasdaq, Boeing (+1,53%) et IBM (+1,48%) enregistrant pour leur part les plus fortes progressions du Dow Jones.

A la baisse, GAP a reculé 1% après avoir bondi en avant-Bourse de plus de 7% à la faveur d'une croissance de ses ventes, pour la première fois en huit trimestres.[nL5N1EV5KT]

L'action cotée à New York du groupe israélien Teva Pharmaceutical Industries , leader mondial des médicaments génériques, a plongé de 6,3% à la suite de la démission du directeur général Erez Vigodman. [nL5N1FR6DN].

Sur le marché des changes, le dollar progresse de 0,48% face à un panier de devises de référence <.DXY> et de 0,S5% face à l'euro , autour de 1,068, en raison des incertitudes politiques en Europe, notamment en France.

Sur le front de la dette, les rendements des Treasuries ont chuté à des creux de près de trois semaines en raison des inquiétudes concernant la politique commerciale de Donald Trump.

UPDATE 1-Production at five Louisiana refineries unaffected by tornadoes - 路透新闻

{{20170207T203557.673+0000}}UPDATE 1-Production at five Louisiana refineries unaffected by tornadoes(Updates with no impact to Phillips 66 refinery, Motiva spokeswoman)

HOUSTON, Feb 7 (Reuters) - Production at Exxon, PBF, Phillips 66 and Motiva refineries in southeast Louisiana were unaffected by severe weather on Tuesday that spawned tornadoes, the companies and Gulf Coast market sources said.

Operations at refineries run by Exxon Mobil Corp in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, PBF Energy in Chalmette, Louisiana, and Phillips 66 in Alliance, Louisiana, were not affected by the weather, said company representatives.

Motiva Enterprises' [MOTIV.UL] Convent and Norco refineries in Louisiana continued planned operations despite the storms, a company spokeswoman said.

"There was no impact to operations and we continue to meet contractual commitments," Exxon's Stephanie Cargile said in an emailed statement.

Exxon's 502,500-barrel-per-day Baton Rouge refinery is the second largest in Louisiana and the company's second largest U.S. refinery.

Storms spun off tornadoes from Baton Rouge to east of New Orleans late on Tuesday morning, according to local media reports. Officials said injuries from the storms had been reported.

A tornado watch remained in effect on Tuesday afternoon across south Louisiana.

Britain's FTSE rises, boosted by weak sterling, DCC - 路透新闻

{{20170207T172902.227+0000}}Britain's FTSE rises, boosted by weak sterling, DCC* FTSE 100 up 0.2 percent at close

* UK mid caps mark record closing level

* Services company DCC top of blue-chip index

* BP flounders after profit slumps

(Adds detail, updates prices at close)

By Kit Rees and Helen Reid

LONDON, Feb 7 (Reuters) - British shares rose on Tuesday, boosted by a weak sterling and a surge in services company DCC , while UK mid caps posted a record closing level.

Sterling fell to its lowest in two weeks against the dollar, contributing to gains for Britain's blue-chip FTSE index <.FTSE> which has many dollar-earning constituents.

The FTSE 100 ended the session 0.2 percent higher at 7,186.22 points while the British mid cap index <.FTMC> closed 1 percent higher at a record closing level of 18,559.70 points.

DCC was the top performer among the blue chips, rising after the company said it would buy a retail petrol station network of ExxonMobil's Norwegian unit, Esso Norge AS, for 2.43 billion Norwegian crowns ($293.38 million). [nL4N1FS2QV]

Shares in the Ireland-based company were up 5.6 percent and marked their biggest one-day gain since Nov. 2015.

Oil major BP suffered after the company said its 2016 profit slumped to the lowest level in at least a decade, to $2.59 billion. BP shares were down more than 4 percent, the worst-performing FTSE stock. The FTSE 350 oil & gas index <.FTNMX0530> dropped more than 2 percent.

Engine maker Rolls Royce , however, was a top gainer, up almost 3 percent. The stock featured in Citigroup's 'top calls' for the day.

"Results next week should mark the inflection from fire-fighting to looking to the future," Citi analysts wrote in a note.

Materials stocks were the top sectoral gainer, helped by a weaker pound due to their operations abroad. Precious metals miners Fresnillo and Randgold Resources were the biggest gainers, both up more than 4 percent.

Education group Pearson , which suffered its worst-ever daily fall on Jan. 18, was also a top gainer, up 3.6 percent after Morgan Stanley raised its target price on the stock to 615p from 550p.

Among the mid caps, which outperformed their blue chip peers, workwear and hygiene company Berendsen rose almost 7 percent after RBC analysts upgraded the stock to "outperform" from "sector perform", saying the European business was in good shape.

The small-cap index <.FTSC> was up 0.4 percent, also hitting a record high and closing at 5,294.21 points, its highest closing level on record.

CORRECTED-UPDATE 2-DCC to buy ExxonMobil's Norwegian retail petrol station network - 路透新闻

{{20170207T105755.650+0000}}CORRECTED-UPDATE 2-DCC to buy ExxonMobil's Norwegian retail petrol station network(Corrects to remove reference to DCC owning a food distribution business in paragraph 2)

Feb 7 (Reuters) - London-listed DCC Plc said it would buy the retail petrol station network of ExxonMobil's Norwegian unit, Esso Norge AS, for 2.43 billion Norwegian crowns ($293.38 million).

DCC, whose activities range from oil distribution to waste management, said the total consideration, along with the value of stock in tank at the date of acquisition, would be paid in cash.

The stock rose 6.6 percent to 6,795 pence as of 0920 GMT, making it the top gainer on the FTSE 100 index <.FTSE>

Dublin-based DCC, which gets nearly half of its profit from Britain and Ireland, has been expanding into western Europe in recent years through acquisitions.

The company, which has in the past bought assets from oil companies such as Chevron and Total , has been scouting for opportunities to purchase distribution and market assets from oil majors as they slim down their portfolio to ride out an oil price slump.

Esso's retail petrol station network has 142 company-operated sites and contracts to supply 108 Esso-branded dealer-owned stations, DCC said.

The business will be integrated into DCC's energy unit and DCC will sign a long-term supply agreement with Esso Norge.

The acquisition is "high quality" and "meaningful", Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in a note, citing expected return on acquisition capital of nearly 15 percent in the first full year of ownership. The firm has an "overweight" rating on the stock.

The transaction is expected to close in the final calendar quarter of 2017, the company said. [nRSG1627Wa]

The Norwegian acquisition follows DCC's deal in November to buy a 97 percent stake in French natural gas retail and marketing business, Gaz Europeen, for an enterprise value of 110 million euros (96 million pounds). [nL4N1DF31F]

Separately, DCC said on Tuesday the group operating profit for the third quarter ended Dec.31, 2016 was "strongly ahead" of the prior year and in line with its expectations, helped by strong performance of its energy unit. [nRSG1641Wa] ($1 = 8.2829 Norwegian crowns)

LONDON, Feb 7 (Reuters) - British shares rose on Tuesday, boosted by a weak sterling and housebuilders stocks, while services company DCC surged on news of a purchase from ExxonMobil.

Sterling fell to its lowest in two weeks against the dollar, contributing to gains for Britain's blue-chip FTSE index <.FTSE> which has many dollar-earning constituents. The FTSE was up 0.6 percent at 0955 GMT.

DCC rose to the top of the FTSE after the company said it would buy a retail petrol station network of ExxonMobil's Norwegian unit, Esso Norge AS, for 2.43 billion Norwegian crowns ($293.38 million). [nL4N1FS2QV]

Shares in the Ireland-based company were up 6.7 percent and headed for their biggest one-day gain since Nov. 2015.

Oil major BP suffered after the company reported 2016 profit slumped to the lowest level in at least a decade, to $2.59 billion. BP shares were down 2.8 percent, the worst-performing FTSE stock. The FTSE 350 oil & gas index <.FTNMX0530> was the only sector index in negative territory.

Engine maker Rolls Royce was a top gainer, up 2.8 percent. The stock figured in Citi bank's 'top calls' for the day. "Results next week should mark the inflection from fire-fighting to looking to the future," Citi analysts wrote in a note.

Materials stocks were the top sectoral gainer. Rio Tinto , which reports earnings on Feb. 8, was a top gainer along with peers Fresnillo and Randgold Resources . The FTSE miners benefit from a weaker pound due to their operations abroad.

Education group Pearson , which suffered its worst-ever daily fall on Jan. 18, was a top gainer, up 2.8 percent after Morgan Stanley raised its target price on the stock to 615p from 550p.

Housebuilders Taylor Wimpey , Barratt Development and Persimmon were gaining ground, up between 2.2 and 3.4 percent, after closing in negative territory yesterday.

The government was expected to publish details of a new housing strategy on Tuesday.

The mid-cap FTSE 250 index <.FTMC> outperformed the blue-chip index, up 0.8 percent with workwear and hygiene company Berendsen leading the gains, up 5.4 percent after RBC analysts upgraded the stock to "outperform" from "sector perform", saying the European business was in good shape.

The small-cap index <.FTSC> was up 0.2 percent, underperforming its peers as energy stocks weighed.

Premier Oil was the top faller, down 5.9 percent after a downgrade from "buy" to "hold" from Deutsche Bank analysts, citing underperformance from the company's Solan field in the North Sea.

UPDATE 2-Statoil takes hit as cuts long-term oil price view - 路透新闻

{{20170207T093835.119+0000}}UPDATE 2-Statoil takes hit as cuts long-term oil price view* Takes $2.3 bln impairment as cuts long-term oil price view

* Q4 net operating loss $1.9 bln vs forecast $2.1 bln profit

* Break-even price is $27 on projects vs $41 last year

* Shares down 1.2 percent, off earlier lows

(Adds detail on output, analysts)

By Nerijus Adomaitis and Gwladys Fouche

LONDON/OSLO, Feb 7 (Reuters) - Norway's Statoil plunged to an unexpected loss in the fourth quarter of last year, as it cut its long-term assumptions for the price of oil and took a $2.3 billion impairment charge on the value of its assets as a result.

But the state-controlled company cheered some analysts with a higher than expected production forecast for 2017, with plans to cut another $1 billion in costs and by saying the average break-even price for its new projects had fallen sharply.

"We guess the market will like Statoil's 2017 guidance and probably forgive the major Q4 earnings miss," said Teodor Sveen-Nilsen at Swedbank.

At 0910 GMT, Statoil shares were down 1.2 percent at 154.7 Norwegian crowns, off an earlier low of 153.4 crowns.

Though oil prices have recovered in recent months, helped by output cuts by major producers, they remain well below levels of more than $100 a barrel earlier in the decade. [O/R]

Statoil said on Tuesday it now expected benchmark Brent crude to reach $75 a barrel in 2020, compared with a previous forecast of $83, and $80 in 2030, compared with $100 before.

Britain's BP said on Tuesday it expected oil prices to remain above $50 a barrel this year, as it also missed fourth-quarter earnings forecasts. [nL5N1FS16K]

Statoil said it made a net operating loss of $1.9 billion for the quarter, versus an operating profit of $152 million in the same period of 2015 and analysts' average forecast of a $2.1 billion profit. [nL5N1FK4F2]

The company's adjusted operating profit fell to $1.66 billion from $1.78 billion a year earlier, missing analysts' forecast for a rise to $2.27 billion as its international unit's performance fell short of expectations. [nL5N1FS0M1]

However, Swedbank's Sveen-Nilsen said Statoil's guidance suggested its 2017 production would rise 4-5 percent from 2016, compared with his own expectations for flat to up 1 percent.

The company also estimated its average break-even price for new projects by 2022 had fall to $27 a barrel from $41 this time last year.

"This is impressive and a sign that investment activity is rising again," said Carnegie analyst Kjetil Bakken.

Statoil forecast its capital expenditure would rise to $11 billion this year from a downwardly revised $10 billion in 2016, with spending on oil and gas exploration steady at $1.5 billion.

The company added it would cut another $1 billion in costs this year on top of the $3.2 billion it has already cut. It maintained its dividend policy and said it may buy back shares, subject to approval from shareholders.

Statoil shares have gained 31 percent over the past year, outperforming a 24 percent rise in the Stoxx Europe 600 oil and gas sector index <.SXEP>.

BP-Bénéfice net du T4 inférieur aux attentes, l'action baisse - 路透新闻

{{20170207T091508.200+0000}}BP-Bénéfice net du T4 inférieur aux attentes, l'action baisseLONDRES, 7 février (Reuters) - BP a annoncé mardi des résultats inférieurs aux attentes pour le quatrième trimestre et en baisse sur l'ensemble de l'exercice pour la deuxième année consécutive, affectés par un cours moyen du baril de pétrole à son plus bas niveau en 12 ans.

La compagnie pétrolière britannique s'attend toutefois à ce que l'accord de réduction de la production conclu entre les pays de l'Opep et certains pays hors Opep maintienne les cours du baril au-dessus de la barre des 50 dollars cette année.

Son bénéfice 2016 est tombé à son plus bas niveau depuis au moins dix ans, à 2,59 milliards de dollars (2,43 milliards d'euros), et a manqué le consensus de marché au quatrième trimestre en raison d'une charge exceptionnelle de 328 millions.

Sur les trois derniers mois de 2016, BP a dégagé un bénéfice net de 400 millions de dollars (375 millions d'euros), en retrait par rapport aux 560 millions attendus en moyenne par les analystes financiers mais supérieur aux 196 millions de dollars dégagés pour la même période de 2015.

Le groupe s'inscrit ainsi dans la lignée de son grands concurrents - Royal Dutch Shell, Exxon Mobil et Statoil - qui ont tous trois publié des résultats trimestriels inférieurs aux attentes.

Le titre accuse une perte de 2,56% à 464,25 pence vers 08h55 GMT à la Bourse de Londres alors que son indice sectoriel européen <.SXEP> recule de 0,46%.

Le groupe estime qu'un prix du baril à environ 60 dollars doit lui permettre d'équilibrer ses comptes d'ici fin 2017 alors que la précédente estimation était à 50-55 dollars le baril.

Sa production devrait augmenter cette année avec le lancement attendu de huit projets, du jamais vu pour BP, dont depuis un à Oman et un autre en Azerbaïdjan. La compagnie espère ajouter 800.000 barils par jour de production nouvelle d'ici la fin de la décennie.

Le directeur financier Brian Gilvary a dit à Reuters que l'accord de baisse de la production conclu par l'Opep pour soutenir les cours n'aurait qu'un impact limité sur la production propre au groupe.

"Si tout se passe comme l'a dit l'Opep je pense que nous resterons au-dessus des 50 dollars le baril", a-t-il duit.

BP a publié une perte annuelle de 542 millions de dollars pour sa division de production de pétrole et de gaz, son activité dite d'amont, tandis que le bénéfice de sa division raffinage et négoce a baissé de 25% à 5,6 millions de dollars.

Le groupe table sur des investissements en haut de la fourchette qu'il s'était fixée de 16-17 milliards de dollars.

BP est engagé depuis quelques mois dans une série de rachats d'actifs, y compris dans le gisement en mer d'Eni de Zohr en Egypte et d'une participation de Kosmos dans la zone d'exploration au large des côtes de Mauritanie et du Sénégal.

Ce regain d'activité marque un retour à la croissance pour le groupe qui avait dû vendre des milliards de dollars d'actifs à la suite de l'explosion de sa plate-forme Deepwater Horizon dans le Golfe du Mexique, dont la facture s'était élevée 62 milliards de dollars. [nL8N1A05OV]

Republicanos revogam leis de transparência e emissões do setor de energia - 路透新闻

{{20170203T195201.545+0000}}Republicanos revogam leis de transparência e emissões do setor de energiaWASHINGTON, 3 Fev (Reuters) - Os parlamentares republicanos dos Estados Unidos revogaram nesta sexta-feira uma regra de transparência cujo objetivo era combater a corrupção em companhias de petróleo, gás e mineração e votaram para acabar com os limites de emissão em operações de perfuração, parte de um esforço para reduzir regulações da era Obama sobre o setor de energia.

Em uma votação de 52 a 47, o Senado controlado por Republicanos aprovou uma resolução que acaba com uma regra que exige que companhias como a Exxon Mobil e Chevron divulguem publicamente seus impostos e outras taxas pagas a governos estrangeiros.

A Câmara dos Deputados já aprovou a medida. É esperado que o presidente Donald Trump assine-a em breve.

Após uma série de disputas jurídicas, o órgão regulador dos EUA, a SEC, completou em junho de 2016 a regulação, que segundo apoiadores poderia ajudar a expor relações financeiras questionáveis que companhias dos EUA podem ter com governos estrangeiros como a Rússia.

Senadores democratas levantaram preocupações de que o presidente da Exxon durante estas disputas jurídicas era Rex Tillerson, que foi recentemente confirmado como secretário de Estado dos EUA e que trabalhou na Rússia.

Na quinta-feira, o Senado também rejeitou uma lei que limitaria companhias de carvão de descartar rejeitos em rios, animando a prejudicada indústria.

UPDATE 4-U.S. Republicans ax disclosure, emissions rules on energy - 路透新闻

{{20170203T184253.251+0000}}UPDATE 4-U.S. Republicans ax disclosure, emissions rules on energy(Adds details on methane rule, background)

By Lisa Lambert and Timothy Gardner

WASHINGTON, Feb 3 (Reuters) - U.S. Republicans on Friday repealed a securities disclosure rule aimed at curbing corruption at energy and mining companies and voted to ax emissions limits on drilling operations, part of a push to remove Obama-era regulations on extractive industries.

In a 52-47 vote, the Republican-controlled Senate approved a resolution to eradicate a rule requiring companies such as Exxon Mobil and Chevron Corp to publicly state taxes and other fees paid to foreign governments like Russia.

The House of Representatives already passed the measure. President Donald Trump is expected to sign it within days. On Thursday, the Senate repealed a rule that would have limited coal companies from dumping waste into streams. [nL1N1FN1RD]

After a number of legal battles, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in June 2016 completed the regulation, which supporters said could help expose questionable financial ties U.S. companies may have with foreign governments.

Senate Democrats raised concerns that Exxon's chief executive during those legal fights was Rex Tillerson, who was recently confirmed as U.S. secretary of state and has worked extensively in Russia.

"It should be lost on no one that in less than 48 hours, the Republican-controlled Senate has confirmed the former head of ExxonMobil to serve as our secretary of state, and repealed a key anti-corruption rule that Exxon Mobil and the American Petroleum Institute have erroneously fought for years," Senator Ben Cardin of Maryland said, referring to the oil industry's trade group.

Exxon and other major energy corporations fought for years to block the rule, required by the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law.

Cardin, the senior Democrat on the foreign relations committee, wrote the Dodd-Frank section on the payments to foreign governments with Richard Lugar, a former Republican senator.

Critics of the rule said it duplicated existing regulations, was too costly and burdensome for companies to implement and that it put U.S. companies at a competitive disadvantage with state-owned companies in other countries that do not have to divulge such information.

The change could give American companies an edge over Canadian and European companies that face some of the toughest transparency rules in the world. [nL1N1FO0K6]

RARELY USED LAW PREVENTS OPPOSITION

Democrats said Republicans were using the review act to help companies not the public.

"When it comes to giving public resources to private interests and gutting our nation's health, environmental and financial standards, the Republicans can't seem to act fast enough," said Representative Raul Grijalva. "Whoever they're doing this for, it isn't the American public."

The Congressional Review Act also bars agencies from revisiting overturned rules, which could pose a legal conundrum for the SEC, which is required by law to enact a payments regulation.

The Senate will next consider repealing a rule limiting venting and leaking of the powerful greenhouse gas methane by oil and gas drillers on federal and tribal lands, mostly in the U.S. West. The repeal was passed by the Republican-controlled House on Friday.

The Interior Department finalized the methane rule in November. The oil industry has argued that it would add to costs for new and existing wells. Environmentalists have said the rule would protect human health and return more than $800 million in royalties to taxpayers over 10 years.

UPDATE 1-U.S. transparency reversal stings Canadian, European oil firms - 路透新闻

{{20170203T140745.329+0000}}UPDATE 1-U.S. transparency reversal stings Canadian, European oil firms(Recasts with Senate vote, adds comment from EU in paragraph 10)

By Ernest Scheyder and Nia Williams

HOUSTON/CALGARY, Feb 3 (Reuters) - A reversal of U.S. transparency requirements for the natural resources industry could give American oil companies an edge over Canadian and European rivals who face some of the toughest rules in the world, according to company executives, legal experts and trade groups.

The U.S. Senate passed a resolution early on Friday to overturn the "resource extraction rule," an Obama administration regulation that required companies to disclose taxes and other payments to foreign governments.

President Donald Trump is expected to soon sign the resolution killing the rule, which had been aimed at discouraging shady dealing in far-flung nations. [nL1N1FO0JM]

The rule was among a handful of regulations ushered in during the final months of Barack Obama's presidency that the Republican-controlled Congress has targeted as overly burdensome for the U.S. economy.

Overturning the regulation leaves Canadian and European natural resource companies with far more stringent reporting standards for payments to foreign governments than U.S. behemoths like Exxon Mobil Corp and Chevron Corp .

Certain details of contract negotiations and terms of bids to access reserves must be divulged under the Canadian and European rules. That could provide American companies a glimpse of their rivals' negotiating tactics around the globe, without having to tip their hands in return.

"It definitely could put Canada at a disadvantage because we are fairly stringent on our rules, both domestically and internationally, on how our companies operate," said Mark Salkeld, chief executive officer of the Petroleum Services Association of Canada, an industry trade group.

European oil company Royal Dutch Shell Plc , meanwhile, pointed out that a U.S. reversal of the transparency requirements would go against the broader global trend in the notoriously murky industry.

"The trend that we have, with access to information, with bringing distant countries into our space all the time, we will have to live with that. I don't think any single political system can turn that around," Shell CEO Ben van Beurden told reporters when asked about the proposed U.S. regulation change.

A European Commission spokeswoman, Vanessa Mock, told Reuters that Europe has no plans to weaken its own rules as a result of the U.S. reversal.

'BANG FOR THEIR BUCK'

Required by the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's extraction rule was finalized last summer and was scheduled to take effect next year. Democratic proponents of the rule said it would help to curb corruption in foreign nations.

Canadian and European regulations were modeled after the Dodd-Frank efforts. But the rule was quickly targeted by congressional Republicans after victories in the November election that brought President Donald Trump and his anti-regulation, pro-energy agenda into the White House.

Trump has signaled a sweeping reduction in regulation to bolster the American drilling and mining industries, including undoing Obama's initiatives to combat climate change.

Vivek Warrier, a partner at Calgary law firm Bennett Jones, said that could put Canadian companies at an even steeper disadvantage.

"When a potential investor comes in, they will look at the additional regulatory compliance costs that will impact Canadian companies and probably conclude there's better bang for their buck south of the border," he said.

Suncor Energy Inc , Canada's largest oil and gas producer, said reporting on payments to foreign governments is a minor administrative burden. "But generally speaking we support reporting payments to governments, as it contributes to greater transparency," said Sneh Seetal, a Suncor spokeswoman.

Canadian Natural Resources Ltd and Cenovus Energy Inc , two Canadian oil producers, declined to comment.

American oil companies, including Exxon Mobil, meanwhile, say the regulation had threatened to put them at a competitive disadvantage to huge state-controlled oil companies like Russia's Rosneft Ltd [TNKBP.UL] and China's CNOOC Ltd <0883.HK>.

"As publicly-traded companies, we have to compete globally with state-owned companies who hold a large majority of proved reserves and have no similar transparency or reporting obligations," Exxon spokesman William Holbrook said.

Stephen Comstock, director of tax policy for the American Petroleum Institute, said revoking the U.S. extraction rule is "a necessary step by Congress to establish sensible regulations that balance increasing transparency without diminishing our industry's competitive advantage."

Exxon and the API said they support an alternative scheme whereby a host country would report to its citizens at a regular interval how much money in total was generated from extractive industries, without breaking out company details.

The U.S. oil industry also said the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act would still remain in effect, prohibiting bribery of foreign officials.

WASHINGTON, Feb 3 (Reuters) - The Republican-led Congress early Friday morning killed a controversial U.S. securities rule disclosure rule aimed at curbing corruption at big oil, gas and mining companies.

In a 52 to 47 vote, the Senate approved a resolution already passed by the House of Representatives that wipes from the books a rule requiring companies such as Exxon Mobil and Chevron Corp to publicly state the taxes and other fees they pay to governments.

Republican President Donald Trump is expected to sign it shortly.

Republicanos revogam leis de transparência e emissões do setor de energia - 路透新闻

{{20170203T195201.545+0000}}Republicanos revogam leis de transparência e emissões do setor de energiaWASHINGTON, 3 Fev (Reuters) - Os parlamentares republicanos dos Estados Unidos revogaram nesta sexta-feira uma regra de transparência cujo objetivo era combater a corrupção em companhias de petróleo, gás e mineração e votaram para acabar com os limites de emissão em operações de perfuração, parte de um esforço para reduzir regulações da era Obama sobre o setor de energia.

Em uma votação de 52 a 47, o Senado controlado por Republicanos aprovou uma resolução que acaba com uma regra que exige que companhias como a Exxon Mobil e Chevron divulguem publicamente seus impostos e outras taxas pagas a governos estrangeiros.

A Câmara dos Deputados já aprovou a medida. É esperado que o presidente Donald Trump assine-a em breve.

Após uma série de disputas jurídicas, o órgão regulador dos EUA, a SEC, completou em junho de 2016 a regulação, que segundo apoiadores poderia ajudar a expor relações financeiras questionáveis que companhias dos EUA podem ter com governos estrangeiros como a Rússia.

Senadores democratas levantaram preocupações de que o presidente da Exxon durante estas disputas jurídicas era Rex Tillerson, que foi recentemente confirmado como secretário de Estado dos EUA e que trabalhou na Rússia.

Na quinta-feira, o Senado também rejeitou uma lei que limitaria companhias de carvão de descartar rejeitos em rios, animando a prejudicada indústria.

UPDATE 4-U.S. Republicans ax disclosure, emissions rules on energy - 路透新闻

{{20170203T184253.251+0000}}UPDATE 4-U.S. Republicans ax disclosure, emissions rules on energy(Adds details on methane rule, background)

By Lisa Lambert and Timothy Gardner

WASHINGTON, Feb 3 (Reuters) - U.S. Republicans on Friday repealed a securities disclosure rule aimed at curbing corruption at energy and mining companies and voted to ax emissions limits on drilling operations, part of a push to remove Obama-era regulations on extractive industries.

In a 52-47 vote, the Republican-controlled Senate approved a resolution to eradicate a rule requiring companies such as Exxon Mobil and Chevron Corp to publicly state taxes and other fees paid to foreign governments like Russia.

The House of Representatives already passed the measure. President Donald Trump is expected to sign it within days. On Thursday, the Senate repealed a rule that would have limited coal companies from dumping waste into streams. [nL1N1FN1RD]

After a number of legal battles, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in June 2016 completed the regulation, which supporters said could help expose questionable financial ties U.S. companies may have with foreign governments.

Senate Democrats raised concerns that Exxon's chief executive during those legal fights was Rex Tillerson, who was recently confirmed as U.S. secretary of state and has worked extensively in Russia.

"It should be lost on no one that in less than 48 hours, the Republican-controlled Senate has confirmed the former head of ExxonMobil to serve as our secretary of state, and repealed a key anti-corruption rule that Exxon Mobil and the American Petroleum Institute have erroneously fought for years," Senator Ben Cardin of Maryland said, referring to the oil industry's trade group.

Exxon and other major energy corporations fought for years to block the rule, required by the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law.

Cardin, the senior Democrat on the foreign relations committee, wrote the Dodd-Frank section on the payments to foreign governments with Richard Lugar, a former Republican senator.

Critics of the rule said it duplicated existing regulations, was too costly and burdensome for companies to implement and that it put U.S. companies at a competitive disadvantage with state-owned companies in other countries that do not have to divulge such information.

The change could give American companies an edge over Canadian and European companies that face some of the toughest transparency rules in the world. [nL1N1FO0K6]

American oil companies, including Exxon Mobil, meanwhile, say the regulation had threatened to put them at a competitive disadvantage to huge state-controlled oil companies like Russia's Rosneft Ltd [TNKBP.UL] and China's CNOOC Ltd <0883.HK>.

"As publicly-traded companies, we have to compete globally with state-owned companies who hold a large majority of proved reserves and have no similar transparency or reporting obligations," Exxon spokesman William Holbrook said.

Stephen Comstock, director of tax policy for the American Petroleum Institute, said revoking the U.S. extraction rule is "a necessary step by Congress to establish sensible regulations that balance increasing transparency without diminishing our industry's competitive advantage."

Exxon and the API said they support an alternative scheme whereby a host country would report to its citizens at a regular interval how much money in total was generated from extractive industries, without breaking out company details.

The U.S. oil industry also said the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act would still remain in effect, prohibiting bribery of foreign officials.

US Senate kills SEC "resource extraction" rule  - 路透新闻

{{20170203T120333.779+0000}}US Senate kills SEC "resource extraction" rule By Lisa Lambert and Sarah N. Lynch

WASHINGTON, Feb 3 (Reuters) - The Republican-led Congress early Friday morning killed a controversial U.S. securities rule disclosure rule aimed at curbing corruption at big oil, gas and mining companies.

In a 52 to 47 vote, the Senate approved a resolution already passed by the House of Representatives that wipes from the books a rule requiring companies such as Exxon Mobil and Chevron Corp to publicly state the taxes and other fees they pay to governments.

Republican President Donald Trump is expected to sign it shortly.

OPEC, Russia spare Asia oil supply cuts in fight to hold market share - 路透新闻

{{20170202T062315.313+0000}}OPEC, Russia spare Asia oil supply cuts in fight to hold market share* OPEC Nov. to Jan. supply to Asia rises 7 pct

* Supply gain occurs despite OPEC, non-OPEC pledge to cut 1.8 mil bpd in H1 2017

* Oil market still expected to rebalance at some point in 2017

By Henning Gloystein

SINGAPORE, Feb 2 (Reuters) - OPEC and non-OPEC producer Russia are shielding Asia from supply cuts agreed in a landmark deal last year as they fight to protect their share of the world's biggest and fastest growing oil market.

Instead, they have reduced deliveries to Europe and the Americas as they implement a coordinated agreement to cut supply by about 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd), seeking to reduce a global supply glut and lift oil prices.

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries' (OPEC) oil supplies to Asia rose by 7 percent between November and January, to 17 million bpd, meeting two-thirds of the region's oil consumption, data from Thomson Reuters Eikon showed.

Under a deal agreed last November, OPEC pledged to cut production by around 1.2 million bpd in the first half of 2017. Other producers, including Russia, pledged to cut another 600,000 bpd.

"For OPEC, and here we mean the Mideast countries, Asia is their core and growing market," said Tushar Bansal, director at Singapore-based consultancy Ivy Global Energy. "The last thing OPEC ... would want is that as they develop newer markets outside the region, some other players like Rosneft or Venezuela increase their market share in what is their backyard."

While the OPEC and Russian cuts should eventually rebalance the market after a three-year glut, it will be slower in Asia unless regional demand picks up.

In a sign of ongoing Asian oversupply, Eikon data shows that around 30 chartered supertankers, known as Very Large Crude Carriers (VLCC), are sitting in the waters outside Asia's oil trading hub of Singapore and southern Malaysia, carrying about 55 million barrels of oil, enough to meet almost five days of Chinese demand.

Asia has been the main source of global oil demand growth for the past two decades as consumption in economically developed nations has stagnated.

Therefore, OPEC has raised its supply to Asia, and Russia has also re-routed a great chunk of its rising production towards China and the Asia-Pacific over the past decade. Russia surpassed Saudi Arabia as China's biggest supplier last year, exporting 1.05 million bpd of crude versus Saudi Arabia's 1.02 million. [nB9N1FA005]

The increase in Asian deliveries contrasts with OPEC's global cut of over 1 million bpd in January, surprising market watchers with a compliance rate of over 80 percent. [nL5N1FK4RW]

Russia, the world's biggest oil producer, also said it cut supplies by 100,000 bpd in January. [nL5N1FM19Z]

"Oil stocks are drawing, especially in Europe. In Asia, strong demand is tightening the market, but it will take time," said Oystein Berentsen, managing director for crude at oil trading firm Strong Petroleum in Singapore.

For the moment, data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) suggests that global markets remain oversupplied, with around 95.8 million bpd of demand being met by 96.4 million bpd of supply.

But given the cuts and an expected demand increase of up to 1.6 million bpd this year, the global market will likely balance this year.

RPT-Wall Street finit de justesse en hausse avec Apple et la Fed - 路透新闻

* Le statu quo de la Fed et son communiqué n'ont surpris personne

* Apple a pris 6,09% après ses résultats

* Facebook prenait 2% après la clôture

(Répétition sans changement d'une dépêche diffusée mercredi)

par Rodrigo Campos

NEW YORK, 2 février (Reuters) - La Bourse de New York a terminé en hausse mercredi, l'indice Standard & Poor's-500 <.SPX> mettant fin à une série de quatre séances consécutives de repli, grâce à la forte hausse d'Apple après ses résultats et après la décision très attendue de la Réserve fédérale de laisser sa politique monétaire inchangée.

Le S&P-500, longtemps hésitant, gagne en clôture 0,68 point, soit 0,03%, à 2.279,55. Le Dow Jones <.DJI> a quant à lui pris 26,85 points (+0,14%) à 19.890,94 et le Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> a progressé de 27,87 points (+0,50%) à 5.642,65.

Tout en laissant ses taux inchangés, la Fed a dressé un tableau relativement optimiste de la conjoncture américaine et redit s'attendre à voir l'inflation remonter à 2%, ce qui valide le scénario de nouvelles hausses de taux dans les prochains mois. [nL5N1FM6EG]

"La confiance dans l'économie est visible dans les déclarations plus appuyées concernant l'inflation", estime Atul Lele, directeur des investissements de Deltec International Group.

Parallèlement, Apple a bondi de 6,09% à 128,75 dollars, son plus haut niveau de clôture depuis un an et demi, après avoir annoncé mardi que les ventes de l'iPhone, son produit phare, avaient retrouvé le chemin de la croissance au cours des trois derniers mois de 2016, soutenant ses résultats financiers. [nL5N1FL80O]

La capitalisation boursière du groupe californien a augmenté de près de 40 milliards de dollars sur la journée. Et sans le soutien d'Apple, les trois grands indices américains auraient tous fini la séance dans le rouge.

BOND D'AMD, BAISSE D'EXXON

Autre valeur technologique très entourée, Advanced Micro Devices s'est adjugé 16,3% après une perte moins lourde qu'attendu et une prévision de chiffre d'affaires solide.

Les bancaires ont par ailleurs bénéficié des indicateurs conjoncturels solides publiés en début de journée, qu'il s'agisse de l'enquête ADP sur l'emploi ou de l'indice ISM d'activité du secteur manufacturier, des signes d'amélioration de la situation économique qui plaident pour la remontée des taux, synonyme d'amélioration des marges du secteur. [nZON1YXS06] [nZON00XS06]

L'indice KBW des banques <.BKX> a pris 0,31% et au sein du Dow, Goldman Sachs et American Express ont avancé respectivement de 0,59% et 0,5%. L'absence de précision de la Fed sur le calendrier de la remontée des taux a toutefois limité leur progression en fin de séance.

A la baisse, Exxon Mobil , en repli de 1,13%, a souffert d'une série d'abaissements d'objectifs de cours par des analystes, au lendemain de ses trimestriels.

Au total, les bénéfices du S&P-500 sont désormais attendus en hausse de 7,1% sur le trimestre octobre-décembre, selon les données Thomson Reuters. Mais certains investisseurs se demandent si le marché n'est pas désormais survalorisé.

Le S&P-500 se traite en effet sur la base de 17,6 fois les profits attendus sur les 12 prochains mois, nettement au-dessus de sa moyenne de long terme de 14,7 fois, selon StarMine.

Environ 7,59 milliards d'actions ont été échangées mercredi sur les différents marchés actions américains, contre 6,8 milliards en moyenne sur les 20 séances précédentes.

Après la clôture, Facebook gagnait près de 2% dans les transactions hors séance, les investisseurs saluant le bond de 50,8% de son chiffre d'affaires au quatrième trimestre. [nL5N1FM7FY]

Sur le marché des changes, le dollar d'abord soutenu par les indicateurs du jour, a réduit ses gains face un panier de référence <.DXY> en réaction au communiqué de la Fed, que certains cambistes espéraient plus offensif.

En fin de journée, l'euro s'échangeait autour de 1,0765 dollar .

Les Treasuries, eux, ont au contraire effacé une partie de leurs pertes après la Fed, le rendement à dix ans revenant à 2,47% contre environ 2,49% juste avant les annonces de la banque centrale et 2,45% mardi soir.

Ce rendement de référence avait atteint 2,52% en début de journée en réaction à l'enquête ADP et à l'ISM.

Cheaper renewables to halt coal and oil demand growth from 2020 -research - 路透新闻

{{20170202T000101.175+0000}}Cheaper renewables to halt coal and oil demand growth from 2020 -researchBy Nina Chestney

LONDON, Feb 2 (Reuters) - The falling cost of electric vehicle and solar technology will halt demand growth for oil and coal from 2020, according to research published on Thursday, posing a threat to fossil fuel companies unprepared for the transition.

The Grantham Institute at Imperial College London and independent think tank Carbon Tracker Initiative analysed cost forecasts for electric vehicle (EV) and solar photovoltaic (PV) technology, government policies and the impact on road transport and power markets, which account for half of global fossil fuel consumption.

"Fossil fuels may lose 10 percent of market share to PV and EVs within a single decade. This may not sound much but it can be the beginning of the end once demand starts to decline," Carbon Tracker said in a statement.

A 10 percent loss of market share caused the collapse of the U.S. coal mining industry and Europe's five biggest utilities lost more than 100 billion euros ($108 billion) in value from 2008-2013 because they were unprepared for renewable energy growth, it added.

The report said that electric vehicles could make up a third of the world's road transport market by 2035 and that solar PV could supply 23 percent of global power generation by 2040, entirely phasing out coal and leaving natural gas with only a 1 percent market share.

Growth in the number of electric vehicles could lead to 2 million barrels per day (bpd) of oil demand being displaced by 2025, the report estimates.

That would be similar to the volume of oversupply that led to the 2014/15 collapse in oil prices. By 2040, 16 million bpd could be displaced, rising to 25 million bpd by 2050, it said.

The International Energy Agency has said that 2 million bpd of oil could be displaced by electric vehicles by 2040. Bloomberg New Energy Finance has forecast that such displacement could occur as early as 2028.

MISPLACED CONFIDENCE?

"Coal demand could peak in 2020 and fall to half of 2012 levels by 2050. Oil demand could be flat from 2020 to 2030 then fall steadily to 2050," Thursday's report said.

By contrast, the International Energy Agency said this week it does not expect oil demand to peak any time soon. [nL5N1FK1B0]

Last week BP said that it expects global oil demand to continue growing into the 2040s, citing increased plastics consumption, while U.S. peer ExxonMobil has said that it sees fossil fuels meeting almost 80 percent of global energy needs by 2040.[nL5N1FF4HH]

"Oil majors already do scenario analysis but, as Exxon previously indicated, they do not assign sufficient probability to a rapid (low-carbon) transition," said James Leaton, head of research at Carbon Tracker Initiative.

"There appears to be a desire to justify business-as-usual at some companies, which does not constitute sound risk management."

Several studies have warned investors that measures to curb carbon emissions growth will hit earnings at coal, oil and gas companies as the world shifts to cleaner energy.

Low oil prices over the past couple of years have also forced companies to reduce spending and shelve deals on oil and gas fields.

Royal Dutch Shell on Tuesday announced $4.7 billion in asset sales, including a large chunk of its North Sea portfolio, and Exxon posted its lowest quarterly profit since 1999 as it wrote down the book value of part of its North American gas and crude reserves [nL5N1FL1XD][nL1N1FL0M7] ($1 = 0.9284 euros)

UPDATE 2-U.S. Senate confirms Tillerson as secretary of state - 路透新闻

{{20170201T225936.841+0000}}UPDATE 2-U.S. Senate confirms Tillerson as secretary of state(Adds context that vote was historically close)

By Patricia Zengerle

WASHINGTON, Feb 1 (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate confirmed Rex Tillerson as President Donald Trump's secretary of state on Wednesday, filling a key spot on the Republican's national security team despite concerns about the former Exxon Mobil Corp chief executive officer's ties to Russia.

The vote, mostly along party lines, was by far the closest in at least half a century.

Fifty-six senators backed Tillerson, and 43 voted no. Every Republican favored Tillerson, along with four members of the Democratic caucus, Senators Heidi Heitkamp, Joe Manchin and Mark Warner as well as Angus King, an independent.

Democratic Senator Chris Coons did not vote.

Tillerson's predecessor in the position, John Kerry, was confirmed by 94 to 3. Condoleezza Rice, the last secretary of state nominated by a Republican, was confirmed by 85-13.

Senate Democrats had tried, but failed, to delay the vote on Tillerson because of Trump's executive order banning immigration from seven mostly Muslim countries and temporarily halting the entry of refugees. [nL1N1FK0WQ]

They said they wanted to ask Tillerson more questions about the issue after Trump signed the order on Friday, prompting protests and chaos at airports across the country and uncertainty and disruption for travelers around the world.

But Republicans hold a majority of 52 seats in the 100-member Senate, and so far have confirmed all of the six Trump nominees who have come up for votes.

Senators had also expressed concerns over Tillerson's ties to Russia after the executive spent years there working for the oil company. Some faulted him for failing to promise to recuse himself from matters related to Exxon Mobil businesses for his entire term as secretary of state rather than only the one year required by law.

Tillerson, 64, retired as chairman and chief executive of Exxon Mobil at the end of 2016 after a four-decade career at the company.

Republicans and other Tillerson supporters said they thought he would be a strong leader as the country's top diplomat, citing his experience running a giant corporation operating on six continents. They also said it was important to finalize Trump's national security team quickly, to address international crises and reassure allies wondering about the new president's "America First" foreign policy.

U.S. House axes regulations on oil and mining company payments, stream pollution - 路透新闻

{{20170201T220550.911+0000}}U.S. House axes regulations on oil and mining company payments, stream pollutionWASHINGTON, Feb 1 (Reuters) - The Republican-led U.S. House of Representatives on Wednesday killed two Obama-era rules, one intended to root out corruption in the extraction sector and one aimed at reducing stream pollution.

Required by the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law, the Securities and Exchange Commission's "extraction rule" was approved this summer to require oil, gas, mining and other companies to publicly state the taxes and other fees they pay to governments. Republicans say the requirement is burdensome and costly for energy companies, and also that it duplicates other long-standing regulations.

The stream buffer rule is intended to lessen the amount of waste from mountain-top removal coal mining deposited in local waterways. Republican lawmakers, though, say it is hurting coal jobs by placing unworkable limits on the industry.

The Republican-dominated Senate is expected to quickly take up killing both regulations and then send the resolutions to President Donald Trump to sign.

LEAD 2-Wall Street finit de justesse en hausse avec Apple et la Fed - 路透新闻

* Le statu quo de la Fed et son communiqué n'ont surpris personne

NEW YORK, 1er février (Reuters) - La Bourse de New York a terminé en hausse mercredi, l'indice Standard & Poor's-500 <.SPX> mettant fin à une série de quatre séances consécutives de repli, grâce à la forte hausse d'Apple après ses résultats et après la décision très attendue de la Réserve fédérale de laisser sa politique monétaire inchangée.

Le S&P-500, longtemps hésitant, gagne en clôture 0,68 point, soit 0,03%, à 2.279,55. Le Dow Jones <.DJI> a quant à lui pris 26,85 points (+0,14%) à 19.890,94 et le Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> a progressé de 27,87 points (+0,50%) à 5.642,65.

Tout en laissant ses taux inchangés, la Fed a dressé un tableau relativement optimiste de la conjoncture américaine et redit s'attendre à voir l'inflation remonter à 2%, ce qui valide le scénario de nouvelles hausses de taux dans les prochains mois. [nL5N1FM6EG]

"La confiance dans l'économie est visible dans les déclarations plus appuyées concernant l'inflation", estime Atul Lele, directeur des investissements de Deltec International Group.

Parallèlement, Apple a bondi de 6,09% à 128,75 dollars, son plus haut niveau de clôture depuis un an et demi, après avoir annoncé mardi que les ventes de l'iPhone, son produit phare, avaient retrouvé le chemin de la croissance au cours des trois derniers mois de 2016, soutenant ses résultats financiers. [nL5N1FL80O]

La capitalisation boursière du groupe californien a augmenté de près de 40 milliards de dollars sur la journée. Et sans le soutien d'Apple, les trois grands indices américains auraient tous fini la séance dans le rouge.

BOND D'AMD, BAISSE D'EXXON

Autre valeur technologique très entourée, Advanced Micro Devices s'est adjugé 16,3% après une perte moins lourde qu'attendu et une prévision de chiffre d'affaires solide.

Les bancaires ont par ailleurs bénéficié des indicateurs conjoncturels solides publiés en début de journée, qu'il s'agisse de l'enquête ADP sur l'emploi ou de l'indice ISM d'activité du secteur manufacturier, des signes d'amélioration de la situation économique qui plaident pour la remontée des taux, synonyme d'amélioration des marges du secteur. [nZON1YXS06] [nZON00XS06]

L'indice KBW des banques <.BKX> a pris 0,31% et au sein du Dow, Goldman Sachs et American Express ont avancé respectivement de 0,59% et 0,5%. L'absence de précision de la Fed sur le calendrier de la remontée des taux a toutefois limité leur progression en fin de séance.

A la baisse, Exxon Mobil , en repli de 1,13%, a souffert d'une série d'abaissements d'objectifs de cours par des analystes, au lendemain de ses trimestriels.

Au total, les bénéfices du S&P-500 sont désormais attendus en hausse de 7,1% sur le trimestre octobre-décembre, selon les données Thomson Reuters. Mais certains investisseurs se demandent si le marché n'est pas désormais survalorisé.

Le S&P-500 se traite en effet sur la base de 17,6 fois les profits attendus sur les 12 prochains mois, nettement au-dessus de sa moyenne de long terme de 14,7 fois, selon StarMine.

Environ 7,59 milliards d'actions ont été échangées mercredi sur les différents marchés actions américains, contre 6,8 milliards en moyenne sur les 20 séances précédentes.

Après la clôture, Facebook gagnait près de 2% dans les transactions hors séance, les investisseurs saluant le bond de 50,8% de son chiffre d'affaires au quatrième trimestre. [nL5N1FM7FY]

Sur le marché des changes, le dollar d'abord soutenu par les indicateurs du jour, a réduit ses gains face un panier de référence <.DXY> en réaction au communiqué de la Fed, que certains cambistes espéraient plus offensif.

En fin de journée, l'euro s'échangeait autour de 1,0765 dollar .

Les Treasuries, eux, ont au contraire effacé une partie de leurs pertes après la Fed, le rendement à dix ans revenant à 2,47% contre environ 2,49% juste avant les annonces de la banque centrale et 2,45% mardi soir.

Ce rendement de référence avait atteint 2,52% en début de journée en réaction à l'enquête ADP et à l'ISM.

Senado EEUU confirma a Tillerson como secretario de Estado de Gobierno de Trump - 路透新闻

{{20170201T212858.627+0000}}Senado EEUU confirma a Tillerson como secretario de Estado de Gobierno de TrumpWASHINGTON, 1 feb (Reuters) - El Senado estadounidense confirmó el miércoles a Rex Tillerson como secretario de Estado del mandatario Donald Trump, un cargo clave en el equipo de seguridad nacional del republicano pese a las preocupaciones por los lazos del ex presidente ejecutivo de Exxon Mobil Corp con Rusia.

En la votación, 56 senadores respaldaron a Tillerson y 43 votaron en contra. Todos los legisladores republicanos favorecieron a Tillerson, junto con los senadores demócratas Heidi Heitkamp, Joe Manchin y Mark Warner así como el independiente Angus King.

El senador demócrata Chris Coons no votó.

Los senadores demócratas habían intentado sin éxito retrasar la votación debido a la orden ejecutiva de Trump que prohibió el ingreso de personas de siete países de mayoría musulmana y suspendió temporalmente la entrada de refugiados.

Dijeron que querían hacerle a Tillerson más preguntas sobre el tema después de que Trump firmó el decreto el viernes.

Los senadores también expresaron preocupación sobre los lazos de Tillerson con Rusia ya que el ejecutivo pasó años trabajando en ese país para la compañía petrolera.

Algunos lo criticaron por no prometer mantenerse a un lado de temas relacionados con los negocios de Exxon Mobil durante todo su período como secretario de Estado en vez de el año requerido por la ley.

Los republicanos dijeron que creían que Tillerson será un líder fuerte como el principal diplomático del país. También afirmaron que era importante ocupar los cargos claves del equipo de seguridad nacional de Trump con rapidez.

INSIGHT-As oil recovers, U.S. firms descend on the Permian Basin in West Texas - 路透新闻

{{20170201T191430.138+0000}}INSIGHT-As oil recovers, U.S. firms descend on the Permian Basin in West Texas(Updates with Endeavor considering IPO, link to FACTBOX)

By Ernest Scheyder

ODESSA, Texas, Feb 1 (Reuters) - In most U.S. shale oil regions, energy firms are making strategic but cautious bets as the price of oil holds above $50 a barrel.

Here in the Permian Basin of West Texas, the largest U.S. oil patch, the industry poured more than $28 billion into land acquisitions last year - more than triple what they spent in 2015.

Those deals set the stage for much larger investments needed to extract the oil from the ground - and they illustrate how the Permian Basin has become the epicenter for the U.S. shale resurgence after a historic oil price crash.

"We could easily see an extra 100 rigs out here in the Permian by June," said Josh Clawson of Gesco, a Midland, Texas, electrical contractor for oil drilling rigs.

That doesn't necessarily mean the investment blitz will extend to other U.S. oil regions. The industry's focus on the Permian reflects the simple math of profitability and a complex set of geographic advantages and technological advances that make it cheaper to drill here than in other major U.S. oil regions.

Permian Basin producers make money at the current crude price of about $53 per barrel because of the region's sprawling pipeline network, abundant labor and supplies, and warm winters that allow year-round work.

Most of America's shale industry needs prices above $60 a barrel to justify new projects and expansion. Oil has not hit that price since June 2015.

So at least for now, the Permian accounts for a disproportionate share of the industry's recovery. The amount spent on Permian land purchases and leases last year represented 39 percent of all deals nationally and tripled the activity seen in any other major U.S. oil region.

Acquisitions in North Dakota's Bakken shale fields, by comparison, accounted for 3 percent of all deals.

For a graphic comparing the land acquisitions in the Permian to other oil regions, see: http://tmsnrt.rs/2jHDopg

Judging by the confident flow of capital into West Texas - a swagger bred in part by aggressive cost-cutting and innovation through the downturn - U.S. oil companies have retained their appetite for risk.

What remains to be seen, should per-barrel prices rise further, is whether companies continue to expand operations in the Permian as projects start to make more economic sense in other oil states including North Dakota, Colorado and Wyoming.

FAST START TO 2017

Oil companies started the new year with announcements of about $9 billion more in Permian land deals, including a $6.6 billion Exxon Mobil Corp buy that doubled its acreage in the basin.[nL4N1F74E1]

Occidental Petroleum Corp , WPX Energy , Noble Energy Inc and RSP Permian Inc have also made major commitments to the region.

The companies that have sold or leased their holdings have typically been smaller, privately-held firms aiming to take advantage of the high land prices rather than invest the millions of dollars needed to pump the oil.

The demand for West Texas acreage has sent land prices soaring in the last two years. One deal in December 2016 priced out at more than $63,000 an acre, double the price paid in similar deal earlier that year.

Double Eagle Energy Permian LLC and its predecessor companies have made a fortune buying and selling Permian acreage starting in 2009.

But Double Eagle's founders, who have snapped up 65,000 acres in the past two years, now plan to start drilling their holdings in addition to speculating on land values. The firm is preparing for an initial public offering with an expected valuation of $3 billion, according to a half dozen bankers who have examined its value.[nL1N1CI1LI]

"Activity breeds activity," said John Sellers, co-founder of Double Eagle, of the surge here. "The Permian is a really great basin to be in."

While land prices have risen fast, the cost of acreage still represents a small part of the profit equation. Most of the expense is tied to drilling and getting the oil to market.

Buyers of Permian acreage are moving quickly to tap their holdings. The number of rigs across the basin is up more than 28 percent in the past year; oil job postings here have more than doubled from lows of last March; and sales tax receipts for the region starting rising in November after falling for two years.

Oil firms are pumping 2.2 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude from the Permian, about a quarter of U.S. output of 8.9 million bpd.

EARLY ACTION

In Midland and nearby Odessa, centers for the West Texas industry, the buzz of economic growth has replaced the desolation of 2015 and early 2016.

Many storage yards are only half full - meaning more equipment is in the field.

Chevron Corp , which controls more than 1 million acres of Permian land, last year opened a new regional office in Midland. EOG Resources Inc and Occidental Petroleum Corp have office expansion plans of their own.

Concho Resources Inc , which is headquartered in Midland, has been renovating and expanding its downtown Midland offices and funding community projects, including a $400,000 makeover of a downtown park.

Permits for new home construction jumped 50 percent in November, the latest period for which data are available. And dinner at Midland's Texas Roadhouse Inc now requires a half-hour wait.

The job market has roared back.

"Everyone I know here is hiring," said J. Ross Lacy, a Midland councilman.

The resurgence gained momentum last summer when industry veteran Mark Papa's Silver Run Acquisition Corp bought Centennial Resource Development Inc , which controls premium acreage across the Permian.[nL1N1A51D0]

Papa is considered one of the preeminent oil executives of his generation, and his move from retirement back into the oil patch was seen as a sign by many that the Permian was heating up again.[nL1N1A51D0]

Two months later, Apache Corp said it had accumulated over 300,000 acres of Permian land over two years for less than $1,300 an acre.

"The Permian Basin represents the foundation of Apache's North American growth strategy," said Gary Clark, vice president of investor relations at Houston-based Apache.

Apache estimated the land had more than 3 billion barrels of oil, sparking speculation that the Permian holds far more oil than anyone had expected in a previously overlooked part of the basin.[nL3N1BJ3XA]

Anadarko Petroleum Corp sold acreage in east Texas earlier this month for $2.3 billion as it looked to raise cash to develop the 600,000 acres of Permian land it controls.[nL1N1F22LS]

The firm is relocating 200 employees and their families to Midland, a sign of faith in the region's long-term prospects.

PERFORMANCE ANXIETY

Many of recent Permian deals were paid for with cash from secondary stock offerings, an unusual step that investors typically dislike because it dilutes their stakes in companies. But in the Permian, it seems, investors see the payoff.

Companies turned to stock offerings for cash because debt markets were largely closed to oil producers during the two-year price downturn.[nL2N1800XD]

Diamondback Energy Inc paid more than $3 billion last year for Permian land in two separate transactions - deals financed through stock offerings. Diamondback executives said the deals were immediately profitable and should provide years of growth.

Executives at SM Energy Co and RSP Permian made similar comments in announcing their own deals late last year for $1.6 billion and $2.4 billion, respectively.[nL4N1CO3MW][nL4N1CJ552]

While shares of top Permian producers have risen in recent weeks, Wall Street's appetite for stock is unsated.

West Texas oil giant Endeavor Energy Resources LP[EERL.UL], one of the biggest private oil producers in the Permian, is considering taking advantage of that with an initial public offering to expand and pump more from the field, Chief Executive Chuck Moloy told Reuters. [L1N1FM1FJ]

Of the 44 analysts covering Pioneer Natural Resources Co - considered by many investors to be the top Permian producer - forty recommend buying it, according to Thomson Reuters data.

None recommend selling the stock.

Investors are seeing the same unique advantages that drew oil companies to wide-open spaces of West Texas.

"The industry is learning where the value really is," said Chuck Meloy, chief executive of Endeavor.

"And that's out here in the Permian."

FACTBOX-Permian Basin becomes hotbed of energy M&A - 路透新闻

{{20170201T185316.461+0000}}FACTBOX-Permian Basin becomes hotbed of energy M&AFeb 1 (Reuters) - The Permian Basin of West Texas, the largest U.S. oil patch, has become a hotbed of M&A activity in the energy industry as a recovery in
oil prices spurs firms to make strategic investments.

Oil and gas producers have spent more than $30 billion since the start of 2016 to acquire lucrative Permian acreage as per data compiled by Reuters.

The Permian has become the focus of oil firms' acreage purchases because it is cheaper to drill there than in other major U.S. oil basins. [nL1N1FL29Y]

Although U.S. crude oil prices are about 50 percent lower than they were in mid-2014, they have held steady above $50, and Permian producers can make money
at current prices.

Below is a list of Permian Basin deals signed since January 2016:

{{20170201T120002.838+0000}}RPT-INSIGHT-As oil recovers, U.S. firms descend on the Permian Basin in West Texas(Repeating for additional clients with no changes to text)

By Ernest Scheyder

ODESSA, Texas, Feb 1 (Reuters) - In most U.S. shale oil regions, energy firms are making strategic but cautious bets as the price of oil holds above $50 a barrel.

Here in the Permian Basin of West Texas, the largest U.S. oil patch, the industry poured more than $28 billion into land acquisitions last year - more than triple what they spent in 2015.

Those deals set the stage for much larger investments needed to extract the oil from the ground - and they illustrate how the Permian Basin has become the epicenter for the U.S. shale resurgence after a historic oil price crash.

"We could easily see an extra 100 rigs out here in the Permian by June," said Josh Clawson of Gesco, a Midland, Texas, electrical contractor for oil drilling rigs.

That doesn't necessarily mean the investment blitz will extend to other U.S. oil regions. The industry's focus on the Permian reflects the simple math of profitability and a complex set of geographic advantages and technological advances that make it cheaper to drill here than in other major U.S. oil regions.

Permian Basin producers make money at the current crude price of about $53 per barrel because of the region's sprawling pipeline network, abundant labor and supplies, and warm winters that allow year-round work.

Most of America's shale industry needs prices above $60 a barrel to justify new projects and expansion. Oil has not hit that price since June 2015.

So at least for now, the Permian accounts for a disproportionate share of the industry's recovery. The amount spent on Permian land purchases and leases last year represented 39 percent of all deals nationally and tripled the activity seen in any other major U.S. oil region.

Acquisitions in North Dakota's Bakken shale fields, by comparison, accounted for 3 percent of all deals.

Judging by the confident flow of capital into West Texas - a swagger bred in part by aggressive cost-cutting and innovation through the downturn - U.S. oil companies have retained their appetite for risk.

What remains to be seen, should per-barrel prices rise further, is whether companies continue to expand operations in the Permian as projects start to make more economic sense in other oil states including North Dakota, Colorado and Wyoming.

FAST START TO 2017

Oil companies started the new year with announcements of about $9 billion more in Permian land deals, including a $6.6 billion Exxon Mobil Corp buy that doubled its acreage in the basin.[nL4N1F74E1]

Occidental Petroleum Corp , WPX Energy , Noble Energy Inc and RSP Permian Inc have also made major commitments to the region.

The companies that have sold or leased their holdings have typically been smaller, privately-held firms aiming to take advantage of the high land prices rather than invest the millions of dollars needed to pump the oil.

The demand for West Texas acreage has sent land prices soaring in the last two years. One deal in December 2016 priced out at more than $63,000 an acre, double the price paid in similar deal earlier that year.

Double Eagle Energy Permian LLC and its predecessor companies have made a fortune buying and selling Permian acreage starting in 2009.

But Double Eagle's founders, who have snapped up 65,000 acres in the past two years, now plan to start drilling their holdings in addition to speculating on land values. The firm is preparing for an initial public offering with an expected valuation of $3 billion, according to a half dozen bankers who have examined its value.[nL1N1CI1LI]

"Activity breeds activity," said John Sellers, co-founder of Double Eagle, of the surge here. "The Permian is a really great basin to be in."

While land prices have risen fast, the cost of acreage still represents a small part of the profit equation. Most of the expense is tied to drilling and getting the oil to market.

Buyers of Permian acreage are moving quickly to tap their holdings. The number of rigs across the basin is up more than 28 percent in the past year; oil job postings here have more than doubled from lows of last March; and sales tax receipts for the region starting rising in November after falling for two years.

Oil firms are pumping 2.2 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude from the Permian, about a quarter of U.S. output of 8.9 million bpd.

EARLY ACTION

In Midland and nearby Odessa, centers for the West Texas industry, the buzz of economic growth has replaced the desolation of 2015 and early 2016.

Many storage yards are only half full - meaning more equipment is in the field.

Chevron Corp , which controls more than 1 million acres of Permian land, last year opened a new regional office in Midland. EOG Resources Inc and Occidental Petroleum Corp have office expansion plans of their own.

Concho Resources Inc , which is headquartered in Midland, has been renovating and expanding its downtown Midland offices and funding community projects, including a $400,000 makeover of a downtown park.

Permits for new home construction jumped 50 percent in November, the latest period for which data are available. And dinner at Midland's Texas Roadhouse Inc now requires a half-hour wait.

The job market has roared back.

"Everyone I know here is hiring," said J. Ross Lacy, a Midland councilman.

The resurgence gained momentum last summer when industry veteran Mark Papa's Silver Run Acquisition Corp bought Centennial Resource Development Inc , which controls premium acreage across the Permian.[nL1N1A51D0]

Papa is considered one of the preeminent oil executives of his generation, and his move from retirement back into the oil patch was seen as a sign by many that the Permian was heating up again.[nL1N1A51D0]

Two months later, Apache Corp said it had accumulated over 300,000 acres of Permian land over two years for less than $1,300 an acre.

"The Permian Basin represents the foundation of Apache's North American growth strategy," said Gary Clark, vice president of investor relations at Houston-based Apache.

Apache estimated the land had more than 3 billion barrels of oil, sparking speculation that the Permian holds far more oil than anyone had expected in a previously overlooked part of the basin.[nL3N1BJ3XA]

Anadarko Petroleum Corp sold acreage in east Texas earlier this month for $2.3 billion as it looked to raise cash to develop the 600,000 acres of Permian land it controls.[nL1N1F22LS]

The firm is relocating 200 employees and their families to Midland, a sign of faith in the region's long-term prospects.

PERFORMANCE ANXIETY

Many of recent Permian deals were paid for with cash from secondary stock offerings, an unusual step that investors typically dislike because it dilutes their stakes in companies. But in the Permian, it seems, investors see the payoff.

Companies turned to stock offerings for cash because debt markets were largely closed to oil producers during the two-year price downturn.[nL2N1800XD]

Diamondback Energy Inc paid more than $3 billion last year for Permian land in two separate transactions - deals financed through stock offerings. Diamondback executives said the deals were immediately profitable and should provide years of growth.

Executives at SM Energy Co and RSP Permian made similar comments in announcing their own deals late last year for $1.6 billion and $2.4 billion, respectively.[nL4N1CO3MW][nL4N1CJ552]

While shares of top Permian producers have risen in recent weeks, Wall Street's appetite for stock is unsated. Of the 44 analysts covering Pioneer Natural Resources Co - considered by many investors to be the top Permian producer - forty recommend buying it, according to Thomson Reuters data.

None recommend selling the stock.

Investors are seeing the same unique advantages that drew oil companies to wide-open spaces of West Texas.

"The industry is learning where the value really is," said Chuck Meloy, chief executive of Endeavor Energy Resources LP [EERL.UL], one of the largest private oil producers in the region. "And that's out here in the Permian."

The companies that have sold or leased their holdings have typically been smaller, privately-held firms aiming to take advantage of the high land prices rather than invest the millions of dollars needed to pump the oil.

The demand for West Texas acreage has sent land prices soaring in the last two years. One deal in December 2016 priced out at more than $63,000 an acre, double the price paid in similar deal earlier that year.

Double Eagle Energy Permian LLC and its predecessor companies have made a fortune buying and selling Permian acreage starting in 2009.

But Double Eagle's founders, who have snapped up 65,000 acres in the past two years, now plan to start drilling their holdings in addition to speculating on land values. The firm is preparing for an initial public offering with an expected valuation of $3 billion, according to a half dozen bankers who have examined its value.[nL1N1CI1LI]

"Activity breeds activity," said John Sellers, co-founder of Double Eagle, of the surge here. "The Permian is a really great basin to be in."

While land prices have risen fast, the cost of acreage still represents a small part of the profit equation. Most of the expense is tied to drilling and getting the oil to market.

Buyers of Permian acreage are moving quickly to tap their holdings. The number of rigs across the basin is up more than 28 percent in the past year; oil job postings here have more than doubled from lows of last March; and sales tax receipts for the region starting rising in November after falling for two years.

Oil firms are pumping 2.2 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude from the Permian, about a quarter of U.S. output of 8.9 million bpd.

EARLY ACTION

In Midland and nearby Odessa, centers for the West Texas industry, the buzz of economic growth has replaced the desolation of 2015 and early 2016.

Many storage yards are only half full - meaning more equipment is in the field.

Chevron Corp , which controls more than 1 million acres of Permian land, last year opened a new regional office in Midland. EOG Resources Inc and Occidental Petroleum Corp have office expansion plans of their own.

Concho Resources Inc , which is headquartered in Midland, has been renovating and expanding its downtown Midland offices and funding community projects, including a $400,000 makeover of a downtown park.

Permits for new home construction jumped 50 percent in November, the latest period for which data are available. And dinner at Midland's Texas Roadhouse Inc now requires a half-hour wait.

The job market has roared back.

"Everyone I know here is hiring," said J. Ross Lacy, a Midland councilman.

The resurgence gained momentum last summer when industry veteran Mark Papa's Silver Run Acquisition Corp bought Centennial Resource Development Inc , which controls premium acreage across the Permian.[nL1N1A51D0]

Papa is considered one of the preeminent oil executives of his generation, and his move from retirement back into the oil patch was seen as a sign by many that the Permian was heating up again.[nL1N1A51D0]

Two months later, Apache Corp said it had accumulated over 300,000 acres of Permian land over two years for less than $1,300 an acre.

"The Permian Basin represents the foundation of Apache's North American growth strategy," said Gary Clark, vice president of investor relations at Houston-based Apache.

Apache estimated the land had more than 3 billion barrels of oil, sparking speculation that the Permian holds far more oil than anyone had expected in a previously overlooked part of the basin.[nL3N1BJ3XA]

Anadarko Petroleum Corp sold acreage in east Texas earlier this month for $2.3 billion as it looked to raise cash to develop the 600,000 acres of Permian land it controls.[nL1N1F22LS]

The firm is relocating 200 employees and their families to Midland, a sign of faith in the region's long-term prospects.

PERFORMANCE ANXIETY

Many of recent Permian deals were paid for with cash from secondary stock offerings, an unusual step that investors typically dislike because it dilutes their stakes in companies. But in the Permian, it seems, investors see the payoff.

Companies turned to stock offerings for cash because debt markets were largely closed to oil producers during the two-year price downturn.[nL2N1800XD]

Diamondback Energy Inc paid more than $3 billion last year for Permian land in two separate transactions - deals financed through stock offerings. Diamondback executives said the deals were immediately profitable and should provide years of growth.

Executives at SM Energy Co and RSP Permian made similar comments in announcing their own deals late last year for $1.6 billion and $2.4 billion, respectively.[nL4N1CO3MW][nL4N1CJ552]

While shares of top Permian producers have risen in recent weeks, Wall Street's appetite for stock is unsated. Of the 44 analysts covering Pioneer Natural Resources Co - considered by many investors to be the top Permian producer - forty recommend buying it, according to Thomson Reuters data.

None recommend selling the stock.

Investors are seeing the same unique advantages that drew oil companies to wide-open spaces of West Texas.

"The industry is learning where the value really is," said Chuck Meloy, chief executive of Endeavor Energy Resources LP [EERL.UL], one of the largest private oil producers in the region. "And that's out here in the Permian."

After slump in energy deals, hints of recovery: EY - 路透新闻

{{20170201T000101.571+0000}}After slump in energy deals, hints of recovery: EY* Deal volume down 27 pct in 2016 from year earlier: EY

* But deal value rose to $395 billion

* Recent pick up set to accelerate, EY's Brogan says

* GRAPHIC: 2016 Oil and Gas M&A (http://tmsnrt.rs/2jRdAHn)

By Ron Bousso

LONDON, Feb 1 (Reuters) - A sharp pick up in deal-making in the oil and gas sector in recent weeks has scope to accelerate as oil prices recover, advisory company EY said in a report.

While the number of deals in 2016 dropped year-on-year by 27 percent, their value rose to $395 billion from $340 billion in 2015.

Executives' appetite for acquisition clearly grew after OPEC and major non-OPEC oil producers agreed to cut output in November, boosting prices and instilling confidence that a recovery was under way. Exxon Mobil BP , Total and Statoil all signed major deals in the last few weeks of the year. [nL5N1F239Q]

Royal Dutch Shell on Tuesday announced $4.7 billion in asset sales, including a large chunk of its North Sea portfolio in what many analysts saw as a bellwether for M&A activity due to its relatively high operating costs. [nL5N1FL1XD]

"Transactions took a back seat to the more urgent task to adapt to new economic realities in the sector last year. A number of deals were initiated but not completed amid ongoing volatility," Andy Brogan, EY Global Oil and Gas Transaction Leader said.

"We expect to see the momentum that began in the fourth quarter of 2016 continue in the year ahead."

Oil prices have gradually recovered since January 2016, when they sank to a 13-year low of $27 a barrel, forcing companies to slash spending and shelve deals on oil and gas fields.

Deal activity in North America rose to $76 billion in 2016 from $43 billion in 2015, driven primarily by the shale oil Permian basin, with its low operating costs and high reservoirs, which spurred a record number of transactions, according to the EY report.

A total of 1,024 upstream deals were struck last year with a combined value of $130 billion.

The infrastructure sector, which includes pipelines and storage terminals, produced the largest increase in volume, rising by 37 percent to 93 deals worth $146 billion.

Deals in the refining sector, which is less influenced by oil price volatility, declined by 17 percent from a year earlier to 131 while rising in value by around 30 percent to $65.9 billion, EY said.

Major downstream assets included the $10.9 billion acquisition by a consortium led by Russia's oil champion Rosneft to acquire a 98 percent stake in an Indian refinery.[nL4N1CL05T

UPDATE 4-Exxon boosts capital budget but takes $2 bln charge from XTO deal - 路透新闻

{{20170131T194911.396+0000}}UPDATE 4-Exxon boosts capital budget but takes $2 bln charge from XTO deal(Adds details on asset impairment charge, updates stock price)

By Ernest Scheyder

HOUSTON, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp boosted its 2017 capital budget on Tuesday on a bet that oil prices have stabilized, but posted its lowest quarterly profit since 1999 as it took a $2 billion charge against the value of natural gas reserves from its buyout of XTO Energy.

The world's largest publicly traded oil producer wrote down the book value of part of its North American natural gas and crude reserves, some of which were acquired in 2009's all-stock buyout of XTO Energy, a deal worth roughly $30 billion at the time.

After conducting an annual asset review, Exxon said the value of some reserves in North America's Rocky Mountain region should be lowered due to weak performance and its own tepid outlook on the potential for future commodity price rises. Exxon declined to provide its internal forecast for oil and gas prices.

Exxon will report estimates for the value of its proved reserves in February. The $2 billion impairment charge likely will reduce the value of the proved reserves.

Wall Street traders expect oil prices to stay near their current range, between $54 and $55 per barrel, for several years and for natural gas prices to remain near their current level, about $3.13 per million cubic feet. <0#CLCAL:>

Exxon also said it will increase spending to about $22 billion this year from $19.3 billion in 2016. The move came after peers Chevron Corp , Hess Corp and other oil producers boosted their capital budgets for the year. [nL1N1E300Z] [nFWN1F20JE]

The 14 percent boost in capital expenditures and the writedown reflect a delicate balancing act by oil and natural gas companies in an era of extreme volatility after a two-year price rout.

The higher spending is not due to rising prices for oilfield contract work or other services, Jeff Woodbury, Exxon's vice president of investor relations, said on an earnings conference call with investors.

"It is, by an large, a function of activity level" increasing, Woodbury said.

Exxon's announcement came after the company posted a better-than-expected quarterly profit, helped by rising oil prices and lower costs.

The results reflected the slow and steady improvement in the global oil and gas industry as commodity prices inch higher after a two-year rout.

The quarterly report was Exxon's first under Chief Executive Officer Darren Woods. Rex Tillerson, the former CEO, has been nominated by U.S. President Donald Trump to be secretary of state and is awaiting confirmation. [nL1N1FD28Y]

Fourth-quarter earnings fell to $1.68 billion, or 41 cents per share, from $2.78 billion, or 67 cents per share, in the year-ago period.

Excluding the $2 billion writedown, Exxon earned 90 cents per share. By that measure, analysts expected 70 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Production fell 3 percent to 4.1 million barrels of oil equivalent per day.

Earlier this month Exxon said it would pay up to $6.6 billion to double its holdings in the oil-rich Permian Basin of west Texas, the largest oil field in the United States.[nL4N1F74E1]

Shares of Texas-based Exxon fell 1.7 percent to $83.40 in afternoon trading.

Exxon aumenta orçamento para investimentos, mas lucro cai com baixa contábil - 路透新闻

{{20170131T173952.761+0000}}Exxon aumenta orçamento para investimentos, mas lucro cai com baixa contábilHOUSTON, 31 Jan (Reuters) - A Exxon Mobil , maior petroleira de capital aberto do mundo, anunciou nesta terça-feira um aumento de cerca de 14 por cento no orçamento para investimentos em 2017, em uma aposta na continuidade da alta dos preços do petróleo , mas o lucro trimestral da companhia foi o pior desde 1999 devido a uma baixa contábil bilionária.

A petroleira disse que irá aumentar os investimentos para cerca de 22 bilhões de dólares neste ano, ante 19,3 bilhões de dólares em 2016. A medida ocorre após outras empresas, como a Chevron e a Hess Corp , aumentarem os orçamentos de investimentos para o ano.

Mas a Exxon Mobil apresentou nesta terça-feira seu pior lucro trimestral em anos principalmente devido a uma baixa contábil de 2 bilhões de dólares realizada pela companhia devido à compra em 2009 da produtora de gás natural XTO Energy, em um negócio então avaliado em 30 bilhões de dólares.

A baixa contábil é um reconhecimento tácito da Exxon de que os preços do gás natural não deverão subir substancialmente no curto prazo.

O lucro do quatro trimestre de 2016 caiu para 1,68 bilhão de dólares, ou 41 centavos por ação, ante 2,78 bilhões, ou 67 centavos por ação no mesmo período do ano anterior.

Desconsiderada a baixa contábil, a Exxon lucrou 90 centavos por ação, contra uma estimativa de 70 centavos por ação apontada em pesquisa da Thomson Reuters com analistas.

BREAKINGVIEWS-New Exxon CEO gets steadier start than predecessor - 路透新闻

{{20170131T165315.501+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-New Exxon CEO gets steadier start than predecessor(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.)

By Richard Beales

NEW YORK, Jan 31 (Reuters Breakingviews) - It's not that running Exxon Mobil is easy, but the energy titan is a well-oiled machine compared to the new U.S. administration. New Chief Executive Darren Woods delivered a solid first set of quarterly earnings. Ex-boss Rex Tillerson, meanwhile, awaits a Senate nod to lead President Donald Trump's State Department.

Exxon generated profit of $1.7 billion in the fourth quarter of 2016, down 40 percent from a year earlier, after a $2 billion writedown on a gas field. Unlike most of the industry, the $350 billion company traditionally has avoided such impairments. Though a prolonged commodity slump has taken its toll, Exxon also managed not to take a hit on oil sands that it had earlier warned was a possibility.

The one blemish aside, earnings handily exceeded what analysts were expecting. It helped that crude prices ratcheted up last year, with the Brent benchmark averaging $49.46 a barrel in the fourth quarter by Exxon's figures, up from $33.89 in the first quarter. The company also kept a lid on costs, even as total production declined slightly.

Challenges nevertheless await Woods. One is to replace reserves to help sustain output long-term. Even big projects due to start producing soon make only modest dents in the problem for a company as big as Exxon. The possibility of lower taxes under Trump is a potential boon, as might be the lifting of U.S. sanctions on Russia. But greater friction in trade and cross-border investment – also plausible with Trump in charge – could work the other way.

Exxon wouldn't be drawn meaningfully during Tuesday's call on such matters or on Trump's chaotic temporary ban on entry into the United States for citizens of seven mainly Muslim countries including Iran and Iraq. That particular edict is surely more alarming for Tillerson than Woods. After all, it has made much harder his job of maintaining America's diplomatic relationships before he has even started.

Woods benefited from a far smoother transition. A post-election lift in Exxon's share price has since faded, but at least the new CEO can rely on a focused organization to help him do his job. Given what's in store, Tillerson could be forgiven nostalgia for his old corner office.

RPT-LEAD 2-Exxon Mobil augmente ses projets d'investissement 2017 - 路透新闻

{{20170131T165224.775+0000}}RPT-LEAD 2-Exxon Mobil augmente ses projets d'investissement 2017(Répétition titre, texte sans changement)

HOUSTON, 31 janvier (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil , première capitalisation pétrolière mondiale, a augmenté mardi son budget d'investissement d'environ 14%, pariant sur une poursuite de la hausse des cours du pétrole dans le sillage de l'accord de l'Opep sur une baisse de la production.

Exxon a annoncé son intention d'augmenter ses dépenses à environ 22 milliards de dollars (20,37 milliards d'euros) cette année, contre 19,3 milliards en 2016. Chevron et d'autres compagnies pétrolières vont aussi investir davantage.

L'augmentation des dépenses n'est pas due à la hausse des prix des travaux sur les installations pétrolières ou d'autres services, a déclaré à la presse Jeff Woodbury, le vice-président d'Exxon chargé des relations avec les investisseurs.

"En gros, c'est lié au niveau d'activité,", a-t-il dit.

Ces annonces ont été faites à l'occasion de la publication par Exxon d'un bénéfice trimestriel meilleur que prévu, porté par l'augmentation du baril de brut et par la baisse des coûts.

Exxon Mobil a inscrit une charge de 2 milliards de dollars pour dépréciation d'actifs de gaz naturel aux Etats-Unis.

La compagnie pétrolière a annoncé un bénéfice au quatrième trimestre de 1,68 milliard de dollars (1,56 milliard d'euros) ou 41 cents par action, à comparer à 2,78 milliards de dollars ou 67 cents par action par rapport à la même période 2015.

Hors la charge exceptionnelle pour dépréciation d'actifs, le bénéfice ressort à 90 cents par action, supérieur aux 70 cents attendus par le consensus Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

La production a reculé de 3% pour s'établir à 4,1 millions de barils équivalent pétrole par jour.

Le chiffre d'affaires au quatrième trimestre ressort à 61,01 milliards de dollars contre 59,80 milliards un an plus tôt.

Le bénéfice 2016 s'établit à 7,8 milliards de dollars.

Les investissements d'Exxon ont chuté de 35% au quatrième trimestre à 4,83 milliards de dollars.

En décembre dernier, le président du géant pétrolier Darren Woods a également pris à son compte le poste de directeur général que Rex Tillerson a quitté après avoir été choisi par Donald Trump pour devenir secrétaire d'Etat.[nL5N1EU06W]

Le Sénat américain devrait confirmer mercredi par un vote la nomination de Tillerson à ce poste.

Le titre perd 2% à 83,15 dollars vers 16h00 GMT.

CALGARY, Alberta, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Canadian oil producer Imperial Oil Ltd reported a sharp rise in fourth-quarter profit on Tuesday, helped by a nearly C$1 billion gain from the sale of its service stations.

Calgary-based Imperial, majority-owned by Exxon Mobil Corp , sold its remaining company-owned Esso retail stations to five fuel distributors for about C$2.8 billion ($2.15 billion). [nL4N16G5L1]

Total net income rose to C$1.44 billion, or C$1.70 per share, in the quarter, from C$102 million, or 12 Canadian cents per share, a year earlier. Imperial recorded a C$988 million gain from the sale of the service stations. [nCNWyL7rza]

However, Imperial's production dipped to an average of 399,000 gross oil-equivalent barrels per day (bpd) from 400,000 a year earlier, and quarterly volumes fell at its vast Kearl oil sands mining project in northern Alberta.

Kearl averaged 169,000 bpd in the quarter compared with 203,000 bpd in the same period a year earlier, due to planned and unplanned maintenance activities.

Imperial's share of production from the Syncrude oil sands plant, majority-owned by Suncor Energy , reached 87,000 bpd, up from 64,000 bpd a year earlier, reflecting efforts to improve reliability at the mining and upgrading project.

"Syncrude effectively matched its record utilization rate achieved in Q3," TD Securities analyst Menno Hulshof wrote in a note to clients, but added that the higher-than-expected Syncrude volumes were offset by lower Kearl volumes.

Analysts also said the increased output form Syncrude boded well for Suncor, which releases its quarterly earnings next week.

Imperial shares were down 0.8 percent at C$42.50 on the Toronto Stock Exchange. ($1 = 1.3051 Canadian dollars)

TABLE-Three U.S. crude cargoes about to arrive in Asia, Caribbean - 路透新闻

{{20170131T163720.734+0000}}TABLE-Three U.S. crude cargoes about to arrive in Asia, CaribbeanJan 31 (Reuters) - Three tankers carrying some 3.5 million barrels of U.S. crude chartered by companies including
British BP  and U.S. refiner Citgo Petroleum are on the way to Asian and Caribbean destinations, according to
sources and Thomson Reuters vessel tracking data.

The very large crude carriers (VLCC) Awtad and Manifa are scheduled to arrive in China and Singapore in February,
according to ClipperData, and the Suezmax Stena Supreme is expected to discharge this week at Venezuelan PDVSA's
terminal in Curacao.

After declining to award a crude tender earlier this month to import up to 1 million barrels of U.S. light crude,
PDVSA requested the oil from its U.S. refining unit Citgo Petroleum, which has supplied the parent company with U.S.
grades several times since last year.

{{20170131T163426.936+0000}}ACTUALIZA 1-Ganancia trimestral de Exxon Mobil supera estimaciones(Actualiza con más datos)

Por Ernest Scheyder

HOUSTON, 31 ene (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp reportó el martes una utilidad trimestral mejor a la esperada, beneficiada por un aumento de los precios del petróleo y menores costos, y anunció un incremento en su presupuesto de inversión de capital para 2017.

Los resultados trimestrales de la mayor petrolera mundial entre las que cotizan en bolsa reflejó la mejoría lenta y constante del sector productor de petróleo y gas a nivel mundial, a medida que los precios de ambas materias primas se recuperan tras dos años de derrumbes.

Exxon asumió un cargo de 2.000 millones de dólares para amortizar el valor de los activos de gas natural de Rocky Mountain, una medida inusual para una compañía que tradicionalmente evita esos métodos contables.

La empresa anotó una ganancia de 1.680 millones de dólares, o 41 centavos por acción en el cuarto trimestre de 2016. El resultado se compara con los 2.780 millones de dólares o 67 centavos por acción en el mismo período del año previo.[nL2N15H18T]

Excluyendo la amortización de 2.000 millones de dólares, Exxon ganó 90 centavos por acción. Bajo esta medición, los analistas esperaban ganancias de 70 centavos por acción, de acuerdo a Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

La producción disminuyó un 3 por ciento a 4,1 millones de barriles de petróleo equivalente por día.

Por otro lado, Exxon dijo que incrementará el gasto a alrededor de 22.000 millones de dólares este año desde 19.300 millones en 2016, apostando a que los precios del crudo seguirán subiendo y que la OPEP honrará su acuerdo de recorte de producción.

La decisión imita a las de pares como Chevron Corp y Hess Corp , entre otras, que aumentaron sus presupuestos de gasto de capital para el año.
