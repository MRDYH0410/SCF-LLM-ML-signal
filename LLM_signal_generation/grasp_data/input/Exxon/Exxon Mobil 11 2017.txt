VIENA, 30 nov (Reuters) - La OPEP y otros productores petroleros, como Rusia, aprobarían el jueves extender un pacto de reducción al bombeo hasta fines de 2018, aunque advirtieron que se podría abandonar el trato de manera anticipada ante un sobrecalentamiento del mercado.

Moscú ha estado presionando por un mensaje claro de cómo dejar los recortes para que el mercado no caiga demasiado pronto en un déficit. El acuerdo actual de los productores, bajo el cual el bombeo se reduce en cerca de 1,8 millones de barriles por día (bpd) expira en marzo.

Durante la reunión de los 14 miembros de la OPEP en Viena el jueves, el ministro de Energía saudí, Khalid al-Falih, señaló que él estaba a favor de extender los recortes en nueve meses hasta fines de 2018.

Falih dijo que era prematuro hablar sobre un abandono del pacto al menos por un par de trimestres y agregó que el cartel revisaría el progreso en su reunión de junio. "Cuando nos dirijamos hacia una salida, lo haremos de forma muy gradual (...) para asegurarnos de no golpear al mercado", aseveró.

Los ministros de Petróleo de Irak, Irán y Angola afirmaron también que era posible revisar el acuerdo actual en junio, en caso de que el mercado llegara a estar demasiado ajustado.

El ministro iraní, Bijan Zanganeh, dijo que el nivel de 60 dólares el barril era un buen precio. El referencial Brent ha estado operando en torno a los 63 dólares.

La reunión de la Organización de Países Exportadores de Petróleo será seguida por una reunión del grupo y de productores encabezados por Rusia cerca de las 1400.

UPDATE 9-OPEC, Russia agree oil cut extension to end of 2018 - 路透新闻

{{20171130T082755.000+0000}}UPDATE 9-OPEC, Russia agree oil cut extension to end of 2018VIENNA, Nov 30 (Reuters)

* OPEC agrees to cap Nigeria, Libya output at 2017 levels

* Saudi's Falih says premature to talk of exiting cuts

* Saudi Arabia needs high oil price for Aramco IPO

* Review of cuts possible in June if market overheats

* Russia worried price rally would further spur U.S. output

(Updates with Falih, Novak news conference)

By Alex Lawler, Rania El Gamal and Shadia Nasralla

VIENNA, Nov 30 (Reuters) - OPEC and non-OPEC producers led by Russia agreed on Thursday to extend oil output cuts until the end of 2018 as they try to finish clearing a global glut of crude while signalling a possible early exit from the deal if the market overheats.

Russia, which this year reduced production significantly with OPEC for the first time, has been pushing for a clear message on how to exit the cuts so the market doesn't flip into a deficit too soon, prices don't rally too fast and rival U.S. shale firms don't boost output further.

Russia needs much lower oil prices to balance its budget than OPEC's leader Saudi Arabia, which is preparing a stock market listing for national energy champion Aramco next year and would hence benefit from pricier crude.

The producers' current deal, under which they are cutting supply by about 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) in an effort to boost oil prices, expires in March.

Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih told reporters the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and non-OPEC allies had agreed to extend the cuts by nine months until the end of 2018, as largely anticipated by the market.

OPEC also decided to cap the combined output of Nigeria and Libya at 2017 levels below 2.8 million bpd. Both countries have been exempt from cuts due to unrest and lower-than-normal production.

Falih said it was premature to talk about exiting the cuts at least for a couple of quarters as the world was entering a season of low winter demand. He added that OPEC would examine progress at its next regular meeting in June.

"When we get to an exit, we are going to do it very gradually ... to make sure we don't shock the market," he said.

OPEC and Russia together produce over 40 percent of global oil. Moscow's first real cooperation with OPEC, put together with the help of President Vladimir Putin, has been crucial in roughly halving an excess of global oil stocks since January.

With oil prices rising above $60, Russia has expressed concerns that an extension for the whole of 2018 could prompt a spike in crude production in the United States, which is not participating in the deal.

A joint OPEC and non-OPEC communique said the next meeting in June 2018 would present an opportunity to adjust the agreement based on market conditions.

The Iraqi, Iranian and Angolan oil ministers also said before Thursday's meetings that a review of the deal was possible in June in case the market became too tight.

International benchmark Brent crude rose around 0.5 percent on Thursday to trade above $63 per barrel.

GLUT OR SHORTAGE?

Just as OPEC gathered in Vienna, U.S. government data showed that U.S. oil production rose 3 percent in September to 9.48 million bpd. [nEMNHBT0SD] But Falih said OPEC "won't be quick on the trigger" to react to short-term U.S. output spikes.

U.S. shale oil producers, which effectively triggered the global oil glut of recent years, have been adjusting their message over the past year, switching away from combative language with regard to OPEC actions.

"If producers in the U.S. increase their rig count over the next few months due to higher prices then I expect another price collapse by the end of 2018," said Scott Sheffield, executive chairman of Pioneer Natural Resources Co , one of the largest producers in the Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico, the largest U.S. oilfield.

"I hope that all U.S. shale companies will maintain their current rig counts and use all excess cash flow to increase dividends back to their shareholders," he told Reuters.

Gary Ross, a veteran OPEC watcher and founder of Pira consultancy, said the market could surprise on the upside with Brent rising to $70 if there were a major supply disruption.

"Everywhere you look there is an ever-present risk to supply," Ross said.

"In Iraq's Kurdistan there is a major risk to oil exports because of tensions with Baghdad, in Libya militias are still fighting, in Nigeria the risks of disruptions are significant, Venezuela is on the verge of default, Iran could again face U.S. financial sanctions and even in Saudi Arabia political risk is on the rise," Ross added.

The production cuts have been in place since the start of 2017 and helped halve an excess of global oil stocks although those remain at 140 million barrels above the five-year average, according to OPEC.

Russia has signalled it wants to understand better how producers will exit from the cuts as it needs to provide guidance to its private and state energy companies. On Thursday, Novak said all companies were on board with the latest limits.

OPEC, allies set to agree oil cut extension to end of 2018 - sources  - Reuters News

{{20171130T074126.540+0000}}OPEC, allies set to agree oil cut extension to end of 2018 - sources By Alex Lawler and Rania El Gamal

VIENNA, Nov 30 (Reuters) - OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers will agree at a meeting on Thursday to extend an output-cutting deal until the end of 2018, four sources familiar with the matter said.

The producers' current deal, under which they are cutting supply by about 1.8 million barrels per day in an effort to boost oil prices, expires in March.

"They will agree on the nine months," an OPEC delegate said, adding that the meeting, due to start around 0900 GMT, was expected to be smooth.

A second source said: "No surprises ... all are for nine months."

Two other sources made similar remarks.

The 14-member Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and Russia have signalled that they may review any extension of the deal when they meet again in June if the market overheats.

With oil prices rallying above $60 per barrel, some are concerned that such an extension could prompt a spike in crude production in the United States, which is not participating in the deal.

Russia needs much lower oil prices to balance its budget than OPEC's leader Saudi Arabia, which is preparing a stock market listing for national energy champion Aramco next year and would hence benefit from pricier crude.

Six ministers from OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers including Saudi Arabia and Russia met in Vienna on Wednesday and recommended extending the cuts to the end of 2018.

{{20171129T200528.174+0000}}UPDATE 6-OPEC, Russia head for oil cut extension but wary of overheating market* Saudi Falih says oil market rebalancing not yet complete

* Russia's Novak says has "common understanding" with Falih

(Updates with Iranian oil minister)

By Ernest Scheyder, Ahmad Ghaddar and Vladimir Soldatkin

VIENNA, Nov 29 (Reuters) - OPEC and Russia look set to prolong oil supply cuts until the end of 2018 this week while signalling that they may review the deal when they meet again in June if the market overheats.

With oil prices rallying above $60 per barrel, Russia has questioned the wisdom of extending existing cuts of 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) until the end of next year as such a move could prompt a spike in U.S. production.

Russia needs much lower oil prices to balance its budget than OPEC's leader Saudi Arabia, which is preparing a stock market listing for national energy champion Aramco next year and would hence benefit from pricier crude.

Six ministers from OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers including Saudi Arabia and Russia met in Vienna on Wednesday - one day ahead of a full OPEC gathering - and recommended extending the cuts to the end of 2018. At present, the cuts expire in March.

"That's one of the recommendations," Kuwait's Oil Minister Essam al-Marzouq told reporters when asked whether the committee had agreed on a nine-month extension, among other matters.

Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak was, however, less certain about the duration.

"The market has not been fully balanced yet. Joint efforts are needed after April 1. Everybody has recommended that the agreement could be extended and tomorrow such concrete details will be discussed," Novak said.

Several sources familiar with the talks have said Russia had suggested an option of reviewing the deal at the next OPEC meeting in June in case the oil market overheats.

"In reality it would be only a three-month true extension with the review in June," said Olivier Jakob from Petromatrix consultancy.

Benchmark Brent and U.S. crude prices fell for a third consecutive session on Wednesday but Brent still traded above $63 per barrel. [O/R]

Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih told the monitoring meeting on Wednesday that cuts needed to be extended as the rebalancing of oil markets was not yet complete.

Iranian oil minister Bijan Zanganeh, who fought Falih on many previous occasions, said he would agree with extending cuts by either six or nine months to help the market rebalance.

DEBATE ON NIGERIA, LIBYA

Novak told reporters after meeting Falih: "We understand that we need to take further steps to rebalance the market ... We have a common understanding (with Falih)."

Amrita Sen from consultancy Energy Aspects said she believed the debate between Saudi Arabia and Russia was about timings rather than substance.

"Saudi Arabia believes it is too early to discuss an exit strategy as the market rebalancing job hasn't been done yet. Russia would like to do it sooner ... OPEC has surprised on the upside during its past three meetings and delivered more than the market had expected," she said.

Two sources familiar with OPEC talks said the group may debate capping Nigerian and Libyan output at 1.8 million bpd and 1 million bpd respectively, having exempted the two countries so far due to unrest and lower-than-normal production volumes.

The production cuts have been in place since the start of 2017 and helped halve an excess of global oil stocks although those remain at 140 million barrels above the five-year average, according to OPEC.

Russia has signalled it wants to understand better how producers will exit from the cuts as it needs to provide guidance to its private and state energy companies.

"It is important ... to work out a strategy which we will follow from April 2018," Novak told the monitoring committee.

Iraqi Oil Minister Jabar al-Luaibi said there had been little discussion so far on any exit strategy.

Some Russian producers including Rosneft, run by an ally of President Vladimir Putin, Igor Sechin, have questioned the rationale of prolonging the cuts, saying it will lead to a loss of market share to U.S. firms, which are not reducing output.

OPEC, which comprises 14 countries, has traditionally been much less worried about exit strategies as its members have been known for reducing compliance and cheating on their quotas towards the expiry of such deals.

"Russia seems to be pushing OPEC to have a concrete plan to phase out the cuts when appropriate ... compared to the typical undisciplined OPEC strategy," U.S. bank Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co, which is active in the shale industry, said.

{{20171129T175914.940+0000}}ACTUALIZA 2-OPEP y Rusia se aprestan a extender recorte de bombeo; preocupa sobrecalentamiento de mercado(Agrega detalles, citas y contexto)

Por Ernest Scheyder, Ahmad Ghaddar y Vladimir Soldatkin

VIENA, 29 nov (Reuters) - La OPEP y Rusia parecen dispuestos a prolongar esta semana un acuerdo para recortar los suministros de petróleo hasta fines de 2018, pero hay indicios de que podrían revisar el pacto cuando se reúnan nuevamente en junio del próximo año si el mercado se sobrecalienta.

Con los precios del crudo cotizando sobre los 60 dólares por barril, Rusia ha cuestionado la conveniencia de extender los recortes existentes de 1,8 millones de barriles por día hasta fines del próximo año debido a que eso podría provocar un alza de la producción en Estados Unidos.

Para equilibrar su presupuesto, Rusia necesita precios del crudo más bajos que el líder de la OPEP, Arabia Saudita, que se prepara para sacar a la bolsa a la estatal energética Saudi Aramco el próximo año y, por lo tanto, se beneficiaría de un precio más alto del petróleo.

Seis ministros de países de la Organización de Países Exportadores de Petróleo y fuera del cártel, incluyendo a Arabia Saudita y Rusia, se reunieron en Viena el miércoles -un día antes de un encuentro del pleno del grupo- y recomendaron extender los recortes hasta fines de 2018. En la actualidad, el pacto concluye en marzo del próximo año. [ID:nL1N1NZ1DF]

"Esa es una de las recomendaciones", dijo a periodistas el ministro de Petróleo de Kuwait, Essam al-Marzouq, cuando se le preguntó si el comité había acordado una prórroga de nueve meses, entre otros asuntos.

No obstante, el ministro de Energía de Rusia, Alexander Novak, se mostró menos seguro sobre la duración.

"El mercado no se ha equilibrado aún. Son necesarios esfuerzos conjuntos tras el 1 de abril. Todos han recomendado que el acuerdo pueda ser extendido y mañana se discutirán estos detalles concretos", afirmó Novak.

Varias fuentes conocedoras de las conversaciones indicaron que Rusia sugirió una opción de revisar el acuerdo en el próximo encuentro de la OPEP de junio, en caso de que el mercado se recaliente.

"En realidad será solo una extensión real de tres meses con la revisión en junio", afirmó Olivier Jakob, de la consultora Petromatrix.

El crudo referencial Brent y el petróleo en Estados Unidos caían el miércoles por tercera sesión consecutiva, en línea con un declive de las existencias de crudo en Estados Unidos.

El ministro de Energía de Arabia Saudita, Khalid al-Falih, dijo en el encuentro del miércoles que es necesario ampliar los recortes, ya que no se ha logrado aún el reequilibrio de los mercados petroleros. Tras la cita, Novak dijo a periodistas que "entendemos que debemos tomar medidas adicionales para reequilibrar el mercado (...) Tenemos un entendimiento común (con Falih)".

Exxon nears deal to explore for oil and gas offshore Mauritania - Reuters News

{{20171129T165326.586+0000}}Exxon nears deal to explore for oil and gas offshore MauritaniaBy Edward McAllister

DAKAR, Nov 29 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil is close to signing a deal to explore for oil and gas offshore Mauritania, its first foray into the West African country, Mauritania's oil, energy and mines director said on Wednesday.

An Exxon Mobil spokeswoman declined to comment on the deal, but said the Texas-based company does not yet have drilling activities in Mauritania.

Interest has surged in oil and gas fields offshore of Mauritania and neighbour Senegal since big discoveries by Cairn Energy and Kosmos Energy , the latter now partnered with BP, in separate projects over the last three years. Both are expected to start production early next decade.

London-based BP is already developing a major gas project and France's Total has bought into several exploration licences in both countries.

"We have agreed on the terms of three blocks," Moustapha Bechir, Mauritania's director general of oil, energy and mines told Reuters on the sidelines of an Oil & Gas Council conference in Dakar. He said they and Exxon had yet to formally sign the deal, but would do soon.

Experts describe the deep waters there as the next big frontier in energy drilling, though the true size of the deposits is not yet known. BP next year plans to make a final investment decision on a liquefied natural gas (LNG) project that would ship West African gas worldwide.

Long overlooked by firms more focused on massive deposits in the Gulf of Guinea further south, Senegal's and Mauritania's oil and gas was discovered by new technology that has given companies a better idea of what lies under the sea bed.

Now, specialist firms are trawling the deep waters making seismic tests to determine what is below. Oil service companies such as Baker Hughes, now part of General Electric , Schlumberger, and others are lining up to team up with oil producers to develop the resources.

Governments in less developed areas south of Senegal and Mauritania's deposits, including Gambia, Guinea Bissau and Guinea, are also trying to coax oil companies in the hope that they can emulate the interest.

Gambia is marketing oil blocks in its thin sliver of territorial water, while Guinea has started to drill offshore.

Guinea Bissau plans to drill its first deep offshore well next year, Celedonio Vieira, the director of marketing and business development at state-run PetroGuin, told Reuters.

"We are optimistic because of the success in Senegal," he said.

{{20171129T152628.108+0000}}UPDATE 1-Exxon assessing damage to shut Beaumont refinery crude unit -sources(Adds company comment, details on fire.)

HOUSTON, Nov 29 (Reuters) - ExxonMobil Corp was assessing damage on Wednesday to the shut small crude distillation unit (CDU) at its 362,300 barrel-per-day Beaumont, Texas, refinery, said sources familiar with plant operations.

Exxon spokeswoman Charlotte Huffaker said the company continues to meet its contractual commitments, but declined to discuss the status of individual units at the Beaumont refinery.

The 110,000-bpd CDU was shut on Tuesday by a fire that started due to a leak on the unit, according to a notice Exxon filed with the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.

The CDU is the smaller of two at the refinery doing the initial refining of crude oil and supplying hydrocarbon feed to all other production units.

No injuries were reported due to the fire, which burned for about 40 minutes early Tuesday morning before it was put out by the refinery's fire department.

Seis ministros de países de la OPEP y fuera del cártel, incluyendo a Arabia Saudita y Rusia, se reunirán en Viena el miércoles, un día antes de una reunión del pleno de la OPEP, para revisar recomendaciones de sus delegados.

El martes, un comité conjunto de países de la OPEP y productores fuera del grupo recomendó extender los recortes hasta fines de 2018 con una opción de revisar el pacto en la siguiente reunión de la OPEP de junio del próximo año, dijeron tres fuentes de la Organización de Países Exportadores de Petróleo.

"La opción de nueve meses de la OPEP es en realidad una opción de seis meses (o de tres meses) porque será reevaluada en la próxima reunión", comentó Jamie Webster, director del Centro para el Impacto Energético del Boston Consulting Group. Los recortes existentes expirarán en marzo de 2018.

El crudo referencial Brent y el petróleo en Estados Unidos caían el miércoles y por tercera sesión consecutiva, aunque el Brent permanecía sobre los 63 dólares por barril.

Los recortes de producción han operado desde comienzos de 2017 y ayudado a reducir a la mitad un exceso de inventarios globales de crudo, aunque permanecen en 140 millones de barriles sobre el promedio a cinco años, según la OPEP.

VIENNA, Nov 29 (Reuters) - OPEC and Russia look set to prolong oil supply cuts until the end of 2018 this week while signalling that they may review the deal when they meet again in June if the market overheats.

With oil prices rallying above $60 per barrel, Russia has questioned the wisdom of extending existing cuts of 1.8 million barrels per day until the end of next year as such a move could prompt a spike in U.S. production.

Russia needs much lower oil prices to balance its budget than OPEC's leader Saudi Arabia, which is preparing a stock market listing for national energy champion Aramco next year and would hence benefit from pricier crude.

Six ministers from OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers including Saudi Arabia and Russia will gather in Vienna on Wednesday - one day ahead of a full OPEC meeting - to review recommendations by their delegates.

On Tuesday, a joint OPEC/non-OPEC committee recommended extending cuts until the end of 2018 with an option of reviewing the arrangement at the next OPEC meeting in June, three sources from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries said.

"OPEC's nine-month option is really a six-month (or three-month) option as it will be re-evaluated at the next meeting," said Jamie Webster, director at the Boston Consulting Group's Centre for Energy Impact. The existing cuts expire in March.

Benchmark Brent and U.S. crude prices declined on Wednesday for a third consecutive day although Brent remained above $63. [O/R]

United Arab Emirates Energy Minister Suhail bin Mohammed al-Mazroui said on Tuesday that cutting output through all of 2018 was still the main, but not only, scenario.

"We have seen very good results towards the market recovery. We still need to continue," he said.

The production cuts have been in place since the start of 2017 and helped halve an excess of global oil stocks although those remain at 140 million barrels above the five-year average, according to OPEC.

Russia has signalled it wants to understand better how producers will exit from the cuts as it needs to provide guidance to its private and state energy companies.

Some producers including Rosneft, run by an ally of President Vladimir Putin, Igor Sechin, have questioned the rationale of prolonging the cuts, saying it will lead to a loss of market share to U.S. firms, which are not reducing output.

OPEC, which comprises 14 countries, has traditionally been much less worried about exit strategies as its members have been known for reducing compliance and cheating on their quotas towards the expiry of such deals.

"OPEC and Russia will both realise they are losing market share and they will be better off going back to a more competitive environment," the head of commodity research at Citi, Ed Morse, told Reuters.

Citi's rival Goldman Sachs said in a note on Tuesday: "We continue to expect a gradual ramp up in OPEC and Russian production from April onward."

Saudi Aramco Mobil Refinery Co to shut down for maintenance in March - 路透新闻

{{20171129T065025.083+0000}}Saudi Aramco Mobil Refinery Co to shut down for maintenance in MarchKHOBAR, Saudi Arabia, Nov 29 (Reuters) - Saudi Aramco Mobil Refinery Co (Samref) plans to shut down its entire 400,000-barrels-per-day oil refinery in Yanbu for scheduled maintenance starting on March 10, the company said on Wednesday.

"Samref will be on planned turnaround for maintenance from March 10 until April 30," Samref told Reuters.

It added the last time a complete shutdown happened was in 2013.

The refinery, owned by Saudi Aramco and U.S. supermajor Exxon Mobil makes gasoline, jet fuel, gas oil, among other products.

{{20171129T053300.943+0000}}UPDATE 1-Exxon's Beaumont, Texas refinery restarts coker –sources(Adds background)

HOUSTON, Nov 28 (Reuters) - ExxonMobil Corp restarted on Tuesday the coking unit at its 362,300-barrel-per-day (bpd) Beaumont, Texas, refinery after repairing a leak, sources familiar with plant operations said.

Exxon spokeswoman Charlotte Huffaker declined comment.

The 45,000-bpd coker was shut on Nov. 21 to repair the leak, the sources said.

The coker converts residual crude from distillation units to feedstock for motor fuels or petroleum coke, which can be used as a coal substitute

U.S. Cash Crude-Coastal lights near flat after refinery fire - 路透新闻

{{20171128T223515.944+0000}}U.S. Cash Crude-Coastal lights near flat after refinery fireNov 28 (Reuters) - U.S. Gulf Coast light sweet crudes were
little changed on Tuesday even after a fire shut a key unit at
Exxon Mobil Corp's  Beaumont, Texas, refinery.

A fire early on Tuesday morning forced Exxon to shut its
110,000 barrel per day crude distillation unit, the smaller of
the two units that processes sweet crude. [nL1N1NY0O2]

Traders appeared to shrug off news of the refinery fire, and
Exxon officials were assessing damages. Both Light Louisiana
Sweet and WTI at East Houston moved sideways, dealers said.

Meanwhile, TransCanada Corp.  said that its 590,000
bpd Keystone crude pipeline restarted operations as expected on
Tuesday, although a company spokesman did not indicate a
timeline for when U.S. regulators would allow it to return to
full capacity. [nL1N1NY1Q9]

The Canada to U.S. pipeline was shut for nearly two weeks
after a 5,000-barrel leak in rural South Dakota on Nov. 16.

* Light Louisiana Sweet  for January delivery was
unchanged at a midpoint of $5.50, trading at $5.50 a barrel
premium to U.S. crude futures .

* Mars Sour  was unchanged at a midpoint of $2.70,
trading at $2.70 a barrel premium to U.S. crude futures .

* WTI Midland  fell 8 cents to a midpoint of 47
cents and traded at 45 cents a barrel premium to U.S. crude
futures .

* West Texas Sour  rose 14.5 cents to a midpoint of
negative 28 cents and traded at 30 cents a barrel discount to
U.S. crude futures .

* WTI at East Houston, also known as MEH, traded at $4.15 a
barrel over WTI.

* ICE Brent January  futures fell 23 cents to settle
at $63.61 a barrel.

* WTI January crude  futures fell 12 cents to settle
at $57.99 a barrel.

* The Brent/WTI spread  narrowed by 11 cents
to settle at $5.62.

UPDATE 4-OPEC heading for oil cut extension with a caveat - Reuters News

{{20171128T202458.731+0000}}UPDATE 4-OPEC heading for oil cut extension with a caveat* Delegates recommend reviewing deal in June

* Ministers yet to approve committee's stance

* June review would be perceived as shorter extension of cuts

* Oil prices fall for second trading session

(Updates with UAE)

By Alex Lawler, Vladimir Soldatkin and Ahmad Ghaddar

VIENNA, Nov 28 (Reuters) - OPEC and Russia are heading towards prolonging their oil supply cuts for the whole of 2018 but with an option to review the deal in June, OPEC sources said on Tuesday after Moscow expressed concerns the market could overheat.

The recommendation was made by a joint committee of OPEC and non-OPEC delegates including Russia but has yet to be approved by the ministers from the committee on Wednesday and then by a full OPEC meeting on Thursday, two OPEC sources said.

Oil prices deepened their two-day decline on the news, which the market could perceive as an extension of production cuts by just three months until June 2018 rather than a full year.

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia and nine other producers are cutting crude output by about 1.8 million barrels per day until March 2018, and on Thursday their oil ministers will discuss extending the deal.

"It will not be an easy meeting and we always look at various scenarios," United Arab Emirates Energy Minister Suhail bin Mohammed al-Mazroui said on Tuesday in Dubai. Upon arrival in Vienna, he said cutting output through the whole of 2018 was still the main scenario but not the only one.

The market had largely expected OPEC to prolong the cuts until the end of 2018 to prop up prices and clear an excess of global stocks, but doubts have emerged in the last few days.

OPEC's leader, Saudi Arabia, has signalled that it wants oil to trade at about $60 a barrel as the kingdom prepares to list shares in national oil champion Aramco and fights a large fiscal deficit.

The Russian government also wants high oil prices ahead of a presidential election in March 2018. But officials in Moscow have voiced worries about pricier oil boosting the rouble, which could undermine the competitiveness of Russia's economy.

U.S. producers aggressively hedged their future production as oil recently rallied , raising fears of another spike in shale output in the United States, which is not participating in the global production curbs.

"Russia is on board for the extension," one of the OPEC sources said following the committee meeting.

Goldman Sachs, one of the most active banks in commodity trading and oil producer hedging, said on Tuesday in a note the outcome of the OPEC meeting was uncertain as Brent oil had risen above $63 per barrel.

"The push for a nine-month extension, four months before the cuts end and given an accelerating rebalancing further stands in the face of prior comments that the cuts should remain data-dependent to assess their effectiveness," the U.S. bank said.

Citi, one of Goldman's main rivals, said it expected major producers to end production cuts sooner rather than later.

"OPEC and Russia will both realise they are losing market share and they will be better off going back to a more competitive environment," the head of commodity research at Citi, Ed Morse, told Reuters.

GRADUAL OUTPUT BOOST

Goldman said oil might fall further this week as the market had priced in a nine-month extension.

"We continue to expect a gradual ramp up in OPEC and Russian production from April onward," Goldman said, adding "as a result, the announcement of an only six-month extension would still initially appear bullish relative to our expectation".

On Friday, Russia said it was ready to support extending the output-cutting deal but had still to decide on the duration.

On Monday, Reuters reported that a major Russian production project led by Exxon Mobil was preparing to ramp up output by a quarter from next year. [nL3N1NX3T4]

The project is not subject to the global output-cutting deal but the development would signal an obstacle to Russia's efforts on production curtailment.

The Exxon project involves Rosneft, the Kremlin-owned state producer whose boss Igor Sechin, a close ally of President Vladimir Putin, has long been a critic of Moscow's deal with the 14-country OPEC.

Sources close to talks between OPEC and Russia told Reuters Moscow wanted to fine-tune the language of the deal to include an option to review the agreement if global stocks fell steeply.

The supply pact is aimed at reducing oil stocks in industrialised countries to their five-year average. The latest figures suggest OPEC is more than halfway there, with OPEC sources saying the target could be reached after June 2018.

UPDATE 3-Crude unit shut after Exxon's Beaumont, Texas refinery fire -sources - 路透新闻

{{20171128T195534.353+0000}}UPDATE 3-Crude unit shut after Exxon's Beaumont, Texas refinery fire -sources(Adds company assessing damage, no injuries due to fire.)

HOUSTON, Nov 28 (Reuters) - The small crude distillation unit at ExxonMobil Corp's 362,300 barrel-per-day (bpd) Beaumont, Texas, refinery was shut on Tuesday following a fire, sources familiar with plant operations said.

Exxon officials were assessing the damage to the 110,000 bpd CDU, which processes sweet crude, and is the smaller of two CDUs at the refinery doing the primary refining of crude oil and providing hydrocarbon feedstock for all other production units.

Exxon spokeswoman Charlotte Huffaker said the fire broke out at about 6 a.m. CST (1200 GMT). No injuries from the blaze were reported.

Huffaker declined to discuss the status of specific units at the Beaumont refinery, but said Exxon continues to meet its contractual commitments.

Traders said prices for sweet and sour crude oil grades were unchanged on Tuesday morning following news of the fire.

The Beaumont Fire Department sent a fire engine to the refinery located on the south end of Beaumont's central business district at the Port of Beaumont, a spokesman said.

"We got a call from a couple of passers-by about the fire," the spokesman said. "We sent an engine out there and it was inside the plant. The engine was on standby until they decided that they didn't need us."

Residents near the refinery and at Lamar University were asked to remain inside while the fire was burning, according to local media reports.

A residential neighborhood is located on the refinery's west side with houses just across the street from the entrance to the Beaumont facility, which includes an adjoining Exxon chemical plant.

ExxonMobil's Canada offshore project produces first oil - Reuters News

{{20171128T165833.632+0000}}ExxonMobil's Canada offshore project produces first oilCALGARY, Alberta, Nov 28 (Reuters) - The Hebron oil project off the coast of eastern Canada has produced its first oil, operator Exxon Mobil said on Tuesday, in a boost to Atlantic Canada's output after years of weak crude prices.

At its peak Hebron will produce up to 150,000 barrels per day (bpd), Exxon said. It will help Atlantic Canada offshore production climb 44 percent to 307,000 bpd by 2024, according to estimates from the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers.

The platform is located 200 miles (350 kilometres) off the coast of Newfoundland and Labrador in depths of 300 feet (92 metres) and the oil field, first discovered in 1980, is estimated to contain more than 700 million barrels of recoverable resources.

"The successful startup of the Hebron project demonstrates ExxonMobil's disciplined project management expertise and highlights its ability to execute large-scale energy developments safely and responsibly in challenging operating conditions," Liam Mallon, president of ExxonMobil Development Company, said in a statement.

Offshore production is dwarfed by the 2.4 million barrels that comes from western Canada, but first oil from Hebron is still welcome news for the country's energy industry after foreign oil majors sold off around $23 billion in Canadian assets this year as a result of depressed prices. [nL2N1HB21M]

While Canadian crude production is still growing thanks to Alberta's vast oil sands, forecasts have been scaled back since oil prices started slumping in mid-2014.

During Hebron's eight-year construction process U.S. oil prices collapsed from over $100 a barrel to as low as $26.

The platform holds living quarters, drilling and production facilities and storage capacity for 1.2 million barrels of oil.

It is operated by Exxon's ExxonMobil Canada Properties, which holds a 35.5 percent stake. Other joint venture partners are Chevron Canada Ltd , Suncor Energy , Statoil ASA and Nalcor Energy, the Newfoundland and Labrador provincial energy corporation.

ExxonMobil's Canada offshore project produces first oil - 路透新闻

{{20171128T165831.000+0000}}ExxonMobil's Canada offshore project produces first oilCALGARY, Alberta, Nov 28 (Reuters)

CALGARY, Alberta, Nov 28 (Reuters) - The Hebron oil project off the coast of eastern Canada has produced its first oil, operator Exxon Mobil said on Tuesday, in a boost to Atlantic Canada's output after years of weak crude prices.

At its peak Hebron will produce up to 150,000 barrels per day (bpd), Exxon said. It will help Atlantic Canada offshore production climb 44 percent to 307,000 bpd by 2024, according to estimates from the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers.

The platform is located 200 miles (350 kilometres) off the coast of Newfoundland and Labrador in depths of 300 feet (92 metres) and the oil field, first discovered in 1980, is estimated to contain more than 700 million barrels of recoverable resources.

"The successful startup of the Hebron project demonstrates ExxonMobil's disciplined project management expertise and highlights its ability to execute large-scale energy developments safely and responsibly in challenging operating conditions," Liam Mallon, president of ExxonMobil Development Company, said in a statement.

Offshore production is dwarfed by the 2.4 million barrels that comes from western Canada, but first oil from Hebron is still welcome news for the country's energy industry after foreign oil majors sold off around $23 billion in Canadian assets this year as a result of depressed prices. [nL2N1HB21M]

While Canadian crude production is still growing thanks to Alberta's vast oil sands, forecasts have been scaled back since oil prices started slumping in mid-2014.

During Hebron's eight-year construction process U.S. oil prices collapsed from over $100 a barrel to as low as $26.

The platform holds living quarters, drilling and production facilities and storage capacity for 1.2 million barrels of oil.

It is operated by Exxon's ExxonMobil Canada Properties, which holds a 35.5 percent stake. Other joint venture partners are Chevron Canada Ltd , Suncor Energy , Statoil ASA and Nalcor Energy, the Newfoundland and Labrador provincial energy corporation.

UPDATE 2-Norway's wealth fund would take many years to sell energy shares - Reuters News

{{20171128T154330.429+0000}}UPDATE 2-Norway's wealth fund would take many years to sell energy shares* Any divestments would take "many years" -CEO

* Finance ministry will publish view in autumn 2018

* Parliament could vote on proposal at earliest in June 2019

(Adds detail, quotes)

By Gwladys Fouche

OSLO, Nov 28 (Reuters) - Norway's $1-trillion sovereign wealth fund may take five years to reduce its investments in energy companies even once the policy is adopted, the fund's CEO said on Tuesday.

The world's largest sovereign wealth fund this month proposed dropping oil and gas companies from its benchmark equity index, which would mean cutting its investments in such businesses over time. [nL8N1NM4UW]

The aim is to lessen the impact of a permanent drop in oil prices on the Norwegian government's wealth, especially when the fund is increasing its exposure to equities to 70 percent of its value from 60 percent. The news hit energy stocks when announced. [nL8N1NM4UW] [nL8N1NM4HN].

The proposal, if adopted, would however take time.

It must first be reviewed by the finance ministry, which has said it would come back with its opinion in autumn 2018. If the ministry backs the proposal, parliament could vote on it only in June 2019 at the earliest. [nO9N1ML02E]

From that point, there will be another few years before the fund completes the process, said fund CEO Yngve Slyngstad.

"Typically our transition period will be two, three, five years, depending on the issue," he told reporters on Tuesday. "The fund will be invested in oil stocks for many years."

Still, if it does go ahead, the fund would divest billions of dollars from oil and gas stocks, as defined by the FTSE oil and gas reference index <.TFTAWORLDS0001U>.

These stocks represent 6 percent - or around $37 billion - of the fund's benchmark equity index.

"It will clearly reduce the exposure to the (oil and gas) sector and we will potentially exit the sector," said Slyngstad.

OIL PRICE IMPACT

The fund invests Norway's revenues from oil and gas production for future generations, investing in equities, bonds and real estate abroad. Its size is equivalent to $192,000 for every Norwegian man, woman and child.

The fund's analysis shows there is a link between the oil price level and the return from oil and gas stocks, a link that is much more pronounced than for any other sector.

Slyngstad reiterated on Tuesday the proposal did not reflect a particular view of future movement in oil prices or the profitability or sustainability of the oil and gas sector.

It is purely based on financial arguments and as a way to reduce the exposure to oil of the Norwegian state's wealth, which has grown over the past decade, he said.

Norway has its own separate exposure to the energy market through untapped offshore hydrocarbon reserves as Western Europe's largest oil and gas producer.

In addition, Norway holds a 67-percent stake in the national oil company, Statoil .

Slyngstad said there would still be opportunities to invest as companies undergo an "energy transition" to less fossil-fuel-intensive models.

"Most investors would say we will be in an energy transition for the next 30 years and that energy transition will have opportunities for investors," he said.

EXCLUSIVE-Rising Russian Sakhalin oil output may threaten OPEC deal compliance - Reuters News

{{20171128T143645.816+0000}}EXCLUSIVE-Rising Russian Sakhalin oil output may threaten OPEC deal compliance* Rise may make it harder for Russia to comply with OPEC cut

* Sakhalin 1 output set to reach 250,000-260,000 bpd-sources

* Exxon seeking permission to raise output - source

(Updates with Japanese comment, analysts)

By Nidhi Verma, Florence Tan and Olesya Astakhova

NEW DELHI/SINGAPORE/MOSCOW, Nov 27 (Reuters) - Oil output from Russia's Far Eastern Sakhalin-1 project is set to rise by about a quarter from January, sources with knowledge of the plan said, signalling Moscow may find it hard to comply with output cuts in tandem with OPEC for the whole of next year.

Russia and the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries will meet in Vienna on Thursday to discuss an extension of the pact to curb output, possibly by another nine months until the end of 2018. [nL1N1NU1D9][nL8N1NU3GA]

The Sakhalin-1 project, operated by U.S. oil giant Exxon Mobil off the coast of Sakhalin, currently produces about 200,000 bpd. As a production sharing agreement (PSA) with the Russian state, it is excluded from any output curbs.

The project also involves the Kremlin state oil major Rosneft , whose boss Igor Sechin, a close ally of President Vladimir Putin, has long been one of the main critics of Moscow's deal with OPEC.

"From January, total oil production from Sakhalin-1 and a small stream from Rosneft's separate block will be about 250,000 bpd," said one of the sources.

A second source said production would increase to 260,000 bpd in the March quarter from about 190,000 bpd in 2017. A third source said output would rise to more than more than 250,000 bpd.

None of the sources wanted to be identified due to the sensitivity of the issue. Exxon and Rosneft did not reply to a request for comment. Indian partner ONGC Videsh declined to comment.

Production at Sakhalin-1 has been fluctuating at below 200,000 bpd for many years before the group began to explore a third deposit, Arkutin Dagi, in 2015.

"We are discussing it today with the energy ministry. We have such an option (of output increases), which we didn't have before. It is because of the new deposit," Masao Fujita, president of Sodeco, a fourth Japanese partner in the consortium, told Reuters in Moscow.

Rosneft and Exxon have long been trying to develop closer ties, including via drilling in the Arctic. But the plan was shelved after the United States imposed sanctions on Rosneft for Russian actions in Ukraine.

The Sakhalin project is exempt from sanctions because it dates back to the early 1990s.

GRADUAL OUTPUT INCREASE

In the meantime, the joint venture has opted to "front load" production and may cut it later if government permission is not granted to keep the annual average intact, the third source said.

OPEC, Russia and several other major producers have cut their combined output by about 1.8 million barrels per day since January to reduce bloated inventories and boost oil prices.

Moscow has said it was ready to support extending a deal but has sent mixed signals about the duration of the extension with some ministers arguing the oil rally could lead to an overly strong rouble and undermine the competitiveness of the economy.

Russia's oil-dependent economy grew an annual 1.8 percent in the September quarter, slowing from 2.5 percent in the second quarter. [nL8N1NT1VC]

Under the current deal that ends in March, Russia agreed to cut output by 300,000 bpd from its level in October 2016.

"Russia may have to cut output from other fields to compensate for a rise in output from Sakhalin-1. It is in Russia's interest to comply with deal to keep oil prices high," said Ehsan Ul-Haq, director of crude oil and refined products at consultancy Resource Economist.

Goldman Sachs said on Tuesday an OPEC supply cut extension by a nine months was far from guaranteed given that some members including Russia were having concerns about the market overheating.

"We continue to expect a gradual ramp up in OPEC and Russian production from April onward," Goldman said.

REFILE-Pressured for profit, oil majors bet big on shale technology - Reuters News

{{20171128T141258.795+0000}}REFILE-Pressured for profit, oil majors bet big on shale technology(Refiles to removes extra word 'effort' in sixth paragraph.)

By Ernest Scheyder

HOUSTON, Nov 28 (Reuters) - Shale oil engineer Oscar Portillo spends his days drilling as many as five wells at once - without ever setting foot on a rig.

Part of a team working to cut the cost of drilling a new shale well by a third, Portillo works from a Royal Dutch Shell Plc office in suburban Houston, his eyes darting among 13 monitors flashing data on speed, temperature and other metrics as he helps control rigs more than 500 miles (805 km) away in the Permian Basin, the largest U.S. oilfield.

For the last decade, smaller oil companies have led the way in shale technology, slashing costs by as much as half with breakthroughs such as horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracking that turned the United States into the world's fastest-growing energy exporter.

(For a graphic detailing the decline in drilling costs, see: http://tmsnrt.rs/2zCXvxE)

Now, oil majors that were slow to seize on shale are seeking further efficiencies by adapting technologies for highly automated offshore operations to shale and pursuing advances in digitalization that have reshaped industries from auto manufacturing to retail.

If they are successful, the U.S. oil industry's ability to bring more wells to production at lower cost could amp up future output and company profits. The firms could also frustrate the ongoing effort by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to drain a global oil glut.

"We're bringing science into the art of drilling wells," Portillo said.

The technological push comes amid worries that U.S. shale gains are slowing as investors press for higher financial returns. Many investors want producers to restrain spending and focus on generating higher returns, not volume, prompting some to pull back on drilling.

Production at a majority of publicly traded shale producers rose just 1.3 percent over the first three quarters this year, according to Morgan Stanley .

But many U.S. shale producers vowed during third quarter earnings disclosures to deliver higher returns through technology, with many forecasting aggressive output hikes into 2018. [nL2N1N62KA]

Chevron Corp is using drones equipped with thermal imaging to detect leaks in oil tanks and pipelines across its shale fields, avoiding traditional ground inspections and lengthy shutdowns.

Ryan Lance, chief executive of ConocoPhillips - the largest U.S. independent oil and gas producer - sees ample opportunity to boost both profits and output. Conoco also oversees remote drilling operations in a similar way to Shell.

"The people that don't have shale in their portfolios don't understand it, frankly," Lance said in an interview. "They think it's going to go away quickly because of the high [production] decline rates, or that the resource is not nearly that substantial. They're wrong on both counts."

Shell, in an initiative called "iShale," has marshaled technology from a dozen oilfield suppliers, including devices from subsea specialist TechnipFMC Plc that separate fracking sand from oil and well-control software from Emerson Electric Co , to bring more automation and data analysis to shale operations.

One idea borrowed from deepwater projects is using sensors to automatically adjust well flows and control separators that divvy natural gas, oil and water. Today, these subsea systems are expensive because they are built to operate at the extreme pressures and temperatures found miles under the ocean's surface.

Shell's initiative aims to create cheaper versions for onshore production by incorporating low-cost sensors similar to those in Apple Inc's Watch, eliminating the need for workers to visit thousands of shale drilling rigs to read gauges and manually adjust valves. Shell envisions shale wells that predict when parts are near mechanical failure and schedule repairs automatically.

By next year, the producer wants to begin remote fracking of wells, putting workers in one place to oversee several projects. It also would add solar panels and more powerful batteries to well sites to reduce electricity and diesel costs.

Oil firms currently spend about $5.9 million to drill a new shale well, according to consultancy Rystad Energy. Shell expects to chop that cost to less than $4 million apiece by the end of the decade.

"There is still very little automation," said Amir Gerges, head of Shell's Permian operations. "We haven't scratched the surface."

TECHNOLOGY AND GEOLOGY

Much of the new technology is focused on where rather than how to drill.

"There is no amount of technology that can improve bad geology," said Mark Papa, CEO of shale producer Centennial Resource Development Inc

Anadarko Petroleum , Statoil and others are using DNA sequencing to pinpoint high potential areas, collecting DNA from microbes in oil to search for the same DNA in rock samples. ConocoPhillip's MRI techniques also borrow from medical advances.[nL2N1GQ0XE]

ConocoPhillips next year will start using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to analyze Permian rock samples and find the best drilling locations, a technique the company first developed for its Alaskan offshore operations.

EOG Resources Inc last year began using a detailed analysis of the oil quality of its fields. The analysis, designed by Houston start-up Premier Oilfield Laboratories, helps to speed decisions on fracking locations and avoid less productive sites.

Premier has reduced the time needed to analyze geochemical data to find oil reserves from days or weeks to seconds. Such efficiencies serve two purposes, said Nathan Ganser, Premier's director of geochemical services.

"It's not only removing costs that are superfluous," he said. "It's boosting production."

INTERVIEW-Saudi's SABIC to spend $3-$10 bln in acquisitions over next five yrs  - Reuters News

{{20171128T140214.469+0000}}INTERVIEW-Saudi's SABIC to spend $3-$10 bln in acquisitions over next five yrs (Adds quote, detail, context)

By Maha El Dahan and Tom Arnold

DUBAI, Nov 28 (Reuters) - Petrochemical producer Saudi Basic Industries Corp (SABIC) plans to spend between $3 and $10 billion on acquisitions over the next five years in specialties and agri-nutrients, chief executive Yousef al-Benyan said on Tuesday.

The group was already looking at two producers of speciality plastics with operations in Europe, the Middle East and China - and could reach a decision on them by the second quarter of 2018, Benyan told Reuters in an interview.

SABIC <2010.SE>, was also looking for ways to expand its agri-nutrients operations in Africa and South America, he added. The sector produces chemicals used in fertilisers.

The move to target more lucrative speciality chemicals comes as Saudi Arabia as a whole is looking for ways to diversify its economy and lessen its reliance on oil.

"We would like to provide our shareholders a business that has less dependency on oil and energy, to reduce the high level of cyclicality in our petrochemical industry," Benyan said.

The company had decided it needed to expand its work in specialities and "this is not going to happen through organic growth this will happen through acquisitions," he added.

The specialities sector - which produces plastics for car windscreens, mobile phone screens and other goods - currently brings in around $1 billion of the company's annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. That figure would grow to between $2 to $3 billion in the near future, Benyan added.

The company posted a net profit of 17.9 billion riyals ($4.8 billion) for the full year of 2016.

He told Reuters in May the firm was evaluating acquisition opportunities in the range of $3 billion to $6 billion in petrochemicals, speciality chemicals and fertilisers and said it aimed to do the first such deal in the fourth quarter of this year. [nL8N1I442X]

SABIC, currently the world's fourth-biggest petrochemicals company, planned to make a decision on an investment in a cracker in Texas with an affiliate of Exxon Mobil by the end of 2018, he said.

"We don't have a decision yet but it is progressing well ... the project is promising and I think it will strengthen our partnership and our strategic position in North America," he said.

SABIC agreed with Saudi Aramco to build a $20 billion complex on Sunday, converting 45 percent of crude oil directly into chemicals and bypassing refining.

The use of crude oil as feedstock to produce olefins and other petrochemicals is economically attractive particularly when it has become harder to get gas, pushing petrochemicals companies for the search of alternative feedstock abroad.[nL8N1HR3QF]

In April, SABIC said it had agreed with Exxon Mobil Chemical to potentially build the petrochemical complex in Texas. The ethane cracker would have a capacity of 1.8 million tonnes per year.

($1 = 3.7502 riyals)

Se avecina dura reunión de la OPEP ante fantasma de déficit petrolero - Reuters (Spanish)

{{20171128T122226.873+0000}}Se avecina dura reunión de la OPEP ante fantasma de déficit petrolero* Ministro de Energía Emiratos Árabes Unidos predice reunión dura

* Goldman dice subida de precio hizo a la OPEP repensar recortes

* Mercado espera extensión control producción hasta fines de 2018

Por Maha El Dahan y Rania El Gamal

DUBÁI/VIENA, 28 nov (Reuters) - La OPEP se dirige a unas conversaciones más duras de lo esperado esta semana, en medio de preocupaciones de que sus esfuerzos por reequilibrar el mercado petrolero podrían no funcionar al crear un déficit global e incentivar una mayor subida de precios.

"No será una reunión fácil y siempre miramos varios escenarios", dijo el martes el ministro de Energía de Emiratos Árabes Unidos, Suhail bin Mohammed al-Mazroui, en Dubái antes de dirigirse al encuentro de la Organización de Países Exportadores de Petróleo (OPEP) en Viena.

La OPEP, Rusia y otros nueve productores están recortando la producción de petróleo en unos 1,8 millones de barriles por día hasta marzo de 2018 y el jueves discutirán extender ese acuerdo. El mercado esperaba que la OPEP prolongue los recortes hasta finales de 2018, pero en los últimos días han surgido dudas.

Arabia Saudita, país líder de la OPEP, ha señalado que quiere que el petróleo se negocie a unos 60 dólares el barril, mientras el reino se prepara para cotizar las acciones de su firma petrolera Aramco y aún lucha con un enorme déficit fiscal.

El Gobierno ruso también quiere altos precios petroleros antes de la elección presidencial en marzo de 2018. Pero funcionarios en Moscú han expresado preocupación acerca de que un petróleo más caro impulse al rublo, lo que podría minar la competitividad de la economía rusa.

Mientras el petróleo se negociaba por encima de los 60 dólares el barril , productores estadounidenses están asegurando su producción futura, lo que genera temores de otro salto en la producción de esquisto en Estados Unidos, que no está participando en los recortes globales a la producción.

Goldman Sachs, uno de los bancos más activos en la comercialización de materias primas y seguros de los productores petroleros, dijo el martes que el resultado de la reunión de la OPEP era incierto.

"La ausencia de un consenso de ese tipo se debe a la incertidumbre sobre el progreso del reequilibrio del mercado petrolero así como a que los precios del petróleo se negocien a 63 dólares el barril", dijo el banco estadounidense en una nota.

Reunião da Opep ocorre nesta semana em meio a temor de déficit de petróleo - Reuters (Portuguese, Brazil)

{{20171128T121331.983+0000}}Reunião da Opep ocorre nesta semana em meio a temor de déficit de petróleoPor Maha El Dahan e Rania El Gamal

DUBAI/VIENA, 28 Nov (Reuters) - A Opep está indo para negociações políticas mais duras do que as esperadas nesta semana, em meio à preocupação de que seus esforços para reequilibrar o mercado de petróleo possam ser fortes demais, criando um déficit global e estimulando uma nova disputa de preços.

"Não será uma reunião fácil e sempre analisamos vários cenários", disse o ministro de Energia dos Emirados Árabes Unidos, Suhail bin Mohammed al-Mazroui, nesta terça-feira, em Dubai, antes de partir para a reunião da Organização dos Países Exportadores de Petróleo em Viena.

A Opep, a Rússia e outros nove produtores estão reduzindo a produção de petróleo em cerca de 1,8 milhões de barris por dia (bpd) até março de 2018, e na quinta-feira todos discutirão a extensão do acordo. O mercado espera amplamente que a Opep prolongue os cortes até o final de 2018, mas as dúvidas surgiram nos últimos dias.

O líder da Opep, a Arábia Saudita, sinalizou que quer o petróleo negociado em torno de 60 dólares por barril, uma vez que o reino se prepara para listar ações de sua petroleira campeã nacional, a Aramco, e ainda está lutando contra um grande déficit fiscal.

O governo russo também quer altos preços do petróleo antes de uma eleição presidencial em março de 2018. Mas funcionários em Moscou manifestaram preocupações sobre o petróleo mais caro impulsionando o rublo, o que poderia prejudicar a competitividade da economia russa.

À medida que o petróleo subiu acima de 60 dólares por barril , os produtores dos Estados Unidos fixaram agressivamente sua produção futura, aumentando os receios de outro pico na produção de xisto, que não está inclusa nos cortes globais de produção.

RPT-Pressured for profit, oil majors bet big on shale technology - Reuters News

{{20171128T120001.948+0000}}RPT-Pressured for profit, oil majors bet big on shale technology(Repeats for additional clients with no changes to text)

By Ernest Scheyder

HOUSTON, Nov 28 (Reuters) - Shale oil engineer Oscar Portillo spends his days drilling as many as five wells at once - without ever setting foot on a rig.

Part of a team working to cut the cost of drilling a new shale well by a third, Portillo works from a Royal Dutch Shell Plc office in suburban Houston, his eyes darting among 13 monitors flashing data on speed, temperature and other metrics as he helps control rigs more than 500 miles (805 km) away in the Permian Basin, the largest U.S. oilfield.

For the last decade, smaller oil companies have led the way in shale technology, slashing costs by as much as half with breakthroughs such as horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracking that turned the United States into the world's fastest-growing energy exporter.

(For a graphic detailing the decline in drilling costs, see: http://tmsnrt.rs/2zCXvxE)

Now, oil majors that were slow to seize on shale are seeking further efficiencies by adapting technologies for highly automated offshore operations to shale and pursuing advances in digitalization that have reshaped industries from auto manufacturing to retail.

If they are successful, the U.S. oil industry's ability to bring more wells to production at lower cost could amp up future output and company profits. The firms could also frustrate the ongoing effort by The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) effort to drain a global oil glut.

"We're bringing science into the art of drilling wells," Portillo said.

The technological push comes amid worries that U.S. shale gains are slowing as investors press for higher financial returns. Many investors want producers to restrain spending and focus on generating higher returns, not volume, prompting some to pull back on drilling.

Production at a majority of publicly traded shale producers rose just 1.3 percent over the first three quarters this year, according to Morgan Stanley .

But many U.S. shale producers vowed during third quarter earnings disclosures to deliver higher returns through technology, with many forecasting aggressive output hikes into 2018. [nL2N1N62KA]

Chevron Corp is using drones equipped with thermal imaging to detect leaks in oil tanks and pipelines across its shale fields, avoiding traditional ground inspections and lengthy shutdowns.

Ryan Lance, chief executive of ConocoPhillips - the largest U.S. independent oil and gas producer - sees ample opportunity to boost both profits and output. Conoco also oversees remote drilling operations in a similar way to Shell.

"The people that don't have shale in their portfolios don't understand it, frankly," Lance said in an interview. "They think it's going to go away quickly because of the high [production] decline rates, or that the resource is not nearly that substantial. They're wrong on both counts."

Shell, in an initiative called "iShale," has marshaled technology from a dozen oilfield suppliers, including devices from subsea specialist TechnipFMC Plc that separate fracking sand from oil and well-control software from Emerson Electric Co , to bring more automation and data analysis to shale operations.

One idea borrowed from deepwater projects is using sensors to automatically adjust well flows and control separators that divvy natural gas, oil and water. Today, these subsea systems are expensive because they are built to operate at the extreme pressures and temperatures found miles under the ocean's surface.

Shell's initiative aims to create cheaper versions for onshore production by incorporating low-cost sensors similar to those in Apple Inc's Watch, eliminating the need for workers to visit thousands of shale drilling rigs to read gauges and manually adjust valves. Shell envisions shale wells that predict when parts are near mechanical failure and schedule repairs automatically.

By next year, the producer wants to begin remote fracking of wells, putting workers in one place to oversee several projects. It also would add solar panels and more powerful batteries to well sites to reduce electricity and diesel costs.

Oil firms currently spend about $5.9 million to drill a new shale well, according to consultancy Rystad Energy. Shell expects to chop that cost to less than $4 million apiece by the end of the decade.

"There is still very little automation," said Amir Gerges, head of Shell's Permian operations. "We haven't scratched the surface."

TECHNOLOGY AND GEOLOGY

Much of the new technology is focused on where rather than how to drill.

"There is no amount of technology that can improve bad geology," said Mark Papa, CEO of shale producer Centennial Resource Development Inc

Anadarko Petroleum , Statoil and others are using DNA sequencing to pinpoint high potential areas, collecting DNA from microbes in oil to search for the same DNA in rock samples. ConocoPhillip's MRI techniques also borrow from medical advances.[nL2N1GQ0XE]

ConocoPhillips next year will start using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to analyze Permian rock samples and find the best drilling locations, a technique the company first developed for its Alaskan offshore operations.

EOG Resources Inc last year began using a detailed analysis of the oil quality of its fields. The analysis, designed by Houston start-up Premier Oilfield Laboratories, helps to speed decisions on fracking locations and avoid less productive sites.

Premier has reduced the time needed to analyze seismic data to find oil reserves from days or weeks to seconds. Such efficiencies serve two purposes, said Nathan Ganser, Premier's director of geochemical services.

"It's not only removing costs that are superfluous," he said. "It's boosting production."

Fondo soberano de Noruega explica decisión sobre valores de energía - Reuters (Spanish)

{{20171128T111633.959+0000}}Fondo soberano de Noruega explica decisión sobre valores de energíaOSLO, 28 nov (Reuters) - El fondo soberano de Noruega dijo que no halló diferencias significativas en la rentabilidad prevista para el sector de petróleo y gas respecto al conjunto del mercado, al tiempo que dio más detalles sobre sus planes para reducir sus inversiones en empresas de energía.

El fondo soberano más grande del mundo, que maneja activos por 1 billón de dólares, propuso este mismo mes sacar de su índice de referencia las inversiones en valores cotizados de petróleo y gas, una noticia que hizo bajar en bolsa al sector de energético.

"Sería beneficioso para un inversor que ya tiene una exposición significativa al precio del petróleo al margen de su cartera financiera, no añadir más exposición invirtiendo en acciones de petróleo y gas en su cartera financiera", dijo en un informe.

Si el Parlamento noruego adopta la propuesta, el fondo tendría que acometer desinversiones multimillonarias en activos de combustibles fósiles, que en la actualidad tienen un peso del 6 por ciento, o alrededor de 37.000 millones de dólares, en el índice de acciones de referencia del fondo.

El objetivo es que el fondo sea menos vulnerable a una caída sostenida de los precios del crudo en un momento en que está incrementando la exposición a la renta variable al 70 por ciento desde un 60 por ciento previo.

Además de sus inversiones a través de su fondo de pensiones, Noruega está expuesta al petróleo y el gas con sus reservas de hidrocarburos y con la participación del 67 por ciento que tiene en la petrolera nacional Statoil .

El Gobierno noruego es el titular de la participación en Statoil y esta no estaría afectada por las desinversiones del fondo, que se gestiona de forma separada.

Al cierre de 2016, el fondo también era uno de los mayores inversores en empresas petroleras, con un 2,3 por ciento en Royal Dutch Shell, un 1,7 por ciento en BP, un 0,9 por ciento de Chevron y un 0,8 por ciento de Exxon Mobil.

Exxon says $1 bln Antwerp clean fuels unit will be running by mid-2018 - Reuters News

{{20171128T105243.847+0000}}Exxon says $1 bln Antwerp clean fuels unit will be running by mid-2018LONDON, Nov 28 (Reuters) - ExxonMobil expects a new $1 billion fuel upgrading unit at its Antwerp refinery to be fully operational in the first half of next year, the company said on Tuesday.

The delayed coker unit, part of a $1 billion investment announced in 2014, will enable the 320,000 barrel per day (bpd) refinery to upgrade high-sulphur fuel into various types of diesel, including the variant mandated by new laws governing shipping fuels. [http://reut.rs/2jrMVPS ]

The company announced the investment during a particularly tough period for European refining, when margins were near multi-year lows and demand in the region appeared to be in permanent decline. However, refining profits have since rebounded strongly.[nL5N1M23YH]

An Exxon spokeswoman said the company plans to complete construction "towards early 2018". Though she said the complex start-up process can take several months, the company expects the unit to be fully operational in the first half of next year.

In addition to the current boom in fuel demand, spurred by low oil prices, traders and analysts say that any project to cut fuel oil production is key to refinery survival amid tightening rules over the level of sulphur that can be burned.

The switch to cleaner fuels in the world's ships mandated by the International Maritime Organization will reduce the maximum level of sulphur that can be burned to 0.5 percent in 2020 from 3.5 percent now.

Analysts FGE estimate that the shipping rule alone could shift 700,000 bpd from fuel oil to distillates, while the International Energy Agency has put the figure as high as 2 million bpd. [nL8N1D3692]

Tough OPEC meeting looms amid spectre of oil deficit - Reuters News

{{20171128T102612.542+0000}}Tough OPEC meeting looms amid spectre of oil deficit* UAE energy minister predicts no easy meeting

* Goldman says price rally has made OPEC rethink cuts

* Market expects output-curb extension until end of 2018

By Maha El Dahan and Rania El Gamal

DUBAI/VIENNA, Nov 28 (Reuters) - OPEC is heading for tougher-than-expected policy talks this week amid concern that its efforts to rebalance the oil market might overshoot by creating a global deficit and spurring a further price rally.

"It will not be an easy meeting and we always look at various scenarios," United Arab Emirates Energy Minister Suhail bin Mohammed al-Mazroui said on Tuesday in Dubai before leaving for the gathering of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries in Vienna.

OPEC, Russia and nine other producers are cutting oil output by about 1.8 million barrels per day until March 2018, and on Thursday will discuss extending the deal. The market had largely expected OPEC to prolong cuts until the end of 2018 but doubts have emerged in the last few days.

OPEC's leader Saudi Arabia has signalled that it wants oil to trade at about $60 per barrel as the kingdom prepares to list shares in its national oil champion Aramco and is still fighting a large fiscal deficit.

The Russian government also wants high oil prices ahead of a presidential election in March 2018. But officials in Moscow have voiced worries about pricier oil boosting the rouble, which could undermine the competitiveness of Russia's economy.

As oil rallied above $60 per barrel , U.S. producers aggressively hedged their future production, raising fears of another spike in shale output in the United States, which is not participating in the global production curbs.

Goldman Sachs, one of the most active banks in commodity trading and oil producer hedging, said on Tuesday the outcome of the OPEC meeting was uncertain.

"The absence of such a consensus is due to the uncertainty on the progress of the oil market rebalancing as well as Brent oil prices trading at $63 per barrel," the U.S. bank said in a note.

"The push for a nine-month extension, four months before the cuts end and given an accelerating rebalancing further stands in the face of prior comments that the cuts should remain data-dependent to assess their effectiveness."

GRADUAL OUTPUT BOOST

U.S. oil prices fell more than 1 percent on Monday and eased further on Tuesday from a two-year high reached last week. [O/R]

Goldman said oil might fall further this week as the market had priced in a nine-month extension.

"We continue to expect a gradual ramp up in OPEC and Russian production from April onward," Goldman said, adding "as a result, the announcement of an only six-month extension would still initially appear bullish relative to our expectation".

On Friday, Russia said it was ready to support extending the output-cutting deal but had still to decide on the duration.

On Monday, Reuters reported that a major Russian production project led by Exxon Mobil was preparing to ramp up output by a quarter from next year. [nL3N1NX3T4]

The project is not subject to the global output-cutting deal but the development would signal an obstacle to Russia's efforts on production curtailment.

The Exxon project involves Rosneft, the Kremlin-owned state producer whose boss Igor Sechin, a close ally of President Vladimir Putin, has long been a critic of Moscow's deal with the 14-country OPEC.

Sources close to talks between OPEC and Russia told Reuters Moscow wanted to fine-tune the language of the deal to include an option to review the agreement if global stocks fell steeply.

The supply pact is aimed at reducing oil stocks in industrialised countries to their five-year average. The latest figures suggest OPEC is more than halfway there, with OPEC sources saying the target could be reached after June 2018.

RPT-CEO da Petrobras diz que Maia se comprometeu com votação da MP do Repetro - Reuters (Portuguese, Brazil)

{{20171128T102025.823+0000}}RPT-CEO da Petrobras diz que Maia se comprometeu com votação da MP do Repetro(Repete texto publicado na noite de segunda-feira)

BRASÍLIA, 27 Nov (Reuters) - O presidente da Petrobras , Pedro Parente, afirmou nesta segunda-feira que o presidente da Câmara, Rodrigo Maia (DEM-RJ), comprometeu-se a fazer todo o esforço para aprovar o mais rapidamente possível a medida provisória que estendeu até 2040 um regime aduaneiro diferenciado para o setor de petróleo e gás natural, chamado Repetro.

Essa MP foi vista como um dos fatores do sucesso dos leilões de áreas de petróleo do Brasil deste ano, que atraíram bilhões de reais de companhias como a Exxon Mobil e a Shell, além da própria Petrobras.

Segundo Parente, Maia disse que a medida vai à votação na Câmara na próxima quarta-feira.

A proposta perde a validade no dia 15 de dezembro, se não passar pelos plenários da Câmara e do Senado.

"É fundamental a aprovação dentro do prazo por conta de um compromisso das autoridades brasileiras com o novo regime tributário que fez parte das questões consideradas pelas empresas que fizeram os investimentos, e certamente é muito importante que isso seja confirmado para que se confirme os investimentos", disse o presidente da Petrobras a jornalistas.

Anteriormente previsto para acabar em 2019, o Repetro permite uma suspensão do pagamento de tributos federais na importação e exportação de bens destinados às atividades de pesquisa e de lavra das jazidas de petróleo e de gás natural.

Parente participou de uma reunião no Palácio do Planalto com o presidente Michel Temer, o presidente da Câmara, e os ministros do Planejamento, Dyogo Oliveira, da Casa Civil, Eliseu Padilha, de Minas e Energia, Fernando Coelho Filho, e Mansueto Almeida, secretário de Acompanhamento Econômico do Ministério da Fazenda.

O presidente da Petrobras disse que ainda não conversou com o presidente do Senado, Eunício Oliveira (PMDB-CE), a respeito da votação da MP, mas já conversou com o líder do governo naquela Casa, Romero Jucá (PMDB-RR), sobre a medida.

Segundo ele, Jucá entende que é "muito importante" apreciar a proposta.

UPDATE 2-Norway's wealth fund would take many years to sell energy shares - 路透新闻

{{20171128T092536.000+0000}}UPDATE 2-Norway's wealth fund would take many years to sell energy sharesOSLO, Nov 28 (Reuters)

* Any divestments would take "many years" -CEO

* Finance ministry will publish view in autumn 2018

* Parliament could vote on proposal at earliest in June 2019

(Adds detail, quotes)

By Gwladys Fouche

OSLO, Nov 28 (Reuters) - Norway's $1-trillion sovereign wealth fund may take five years to reduce its investments in energy companies even once the policy is adopted, the fund's CEO said on Tuesday.

The world's largest sovereign wealth fund this month proposed dropping oil and gas companies from its benchmark equity index, which would mean cutting its investments in such businesses over time. [nL8N1NM4UW]

The aim is to lessen the impact of a permanent drop in oil prices on the Norwegian government's wealth, especially when the fund is increasing its exposure to equities to 70 percent of its value from 60 percent. The news hit energy stocks when announced. [nL8N1NM4UW] [nL8N1NM4HN].

The proposal, if adopted, would however take time.

It must first be reviewed by the finance ministry, which has said it would come back with its opinion in autumn 2018. If the ministry backs the proposal, parliament could vote on it only in June 2019 at the earliest. [nO9N1ML02E]

From that point, there will be another few years before the fund completes the process, said fund CEO Yngve Slyngstad.

"Typically our transition period will be two, three, five years, depending on the issue," he told reporters on Tuesday. "The fund will be invested in oil stocks for many years."

Still, if it does go ahead, the fund would divest billions of dollars from oil and gas stocks, as defined by the FTSE oil and gas reference index <.TFTAWORLDS0001U>.

These stocks represent 6 percent - or around $37 billion - of the fund's benchmark equity index.

"It will clearly reduce the exposure to the (oil and gas) sector and we will potentially exit the sector," said Slyngstad.

OIL PRICE IMPACT

The fund invests Norway's revenues from oil and gas production for future generations, investing in equities, bonds and real estate abroad. Its size is equivalent to $192,000 for every Norwegian man, woman and child.

The fund's analysis shows there is a link between the oil price level and the return from oil and gas stocks, a link that is much more pronounced than for any other sector.

Slyngstad reiterated on Tuesday the proposal did not reflect a particular view of future movement in oil prices or the profitability or sustainability of the oil and gas sector.

It is purely based on financial arguments and as a way to reduce the exposure to oil of the Norwegian state's wealth, which has grown over the past decade, he said.

Norway has its own separate exposure to the energy market through untapped offshore hydrocarbon reserves as Western Europe's largest oil and gas producer.

In addition, Norway holds a 67-percent stake in the national oil company, Statoil .

Slyngstad said there would still be opportunities to invest as companies undergo an "energy transition" to less fossil-fuel-intensive models.

"Most investors would say we will be in an energy transition for the next 30 years and that energy transition will have opportunities for investors," he said.

Norway's wealth fund sees no significant differences between oil, gas stocks and market - Reuters News

{{20171128T090131.805+0000}}Norway's wealth fund sees no significant differences between oil, gas stocks and marketOSLO, Nov 28 (Reuters) - Norway's $1 trillion sovereign wealth fund said on Tuesday it found no significant differences in expected return for oil and gas stocks and the market.

"It might be beneficial for an investor that already has substantial oil price exposure outside their financial portfolio, not to add to this exposure by investing in oil and gas stocks in their financial portfolio," the fund said in a discussion note.

The world's largest sovereign wealth fund proposed on Nov. 17 to drop oil and gas stock from its index, sending energy stocks lower.

CEO da Petrobras diz que Maia se comprometeu com votação da MP do Repetro - Reuters (Portuguese, Brazil)

{{20171127T215305.148+0000}}CEO da Petrobras diz que Maia se comprometeu com votação da MP do RepetroBRASÍLIA, 27 Nov (Reuters) - O presidente da Petrobras , Pedro Parente, afirmou nesta segunda-feira que o presidente da Câmara, Rodrigo Maia (DEM-RJ), comprometeu-se a fazer todo o esforço para aprovar o mais rapidamente possível a medida provisória que estendeu até 2040 um regime aduaneiro diferenciado para o setor de petróleo e gás natural, chamado Repetro.

Essa MP foi vista como um dos fatores do sucesso dos leilões de áreas de petróleo do Brasil deste ano, que atraíram bilhões de reais de companhias como a Exxon Mobil e a Shell, além da própria Petrobras.

Segundo Parente, Maia disse que a medida vai à votação na Câmara na próxima quarta-feira.

A proposta perde a validade no dia 15 de dezembro, se não passar pelos plenários da Câmara e do Senado.

"É fundamental a aprovação dentro do prazo por conta de um compromisso das autoridades brasileiras com o novo regime tributário que fez parte das questões consideradas pelas empresas que fizeram os investimentos, e certamente é muito importante que isso seja confirmado para que se confirme os investimentos", disse o presidente da Petrobras a jornalistas.

Anteriormente previsto para acabar em 2019, o Repetro permite uma suspensão do pagamento de tributos federais na importação e exportação de bens destinados às atividades de pesquisa e de lavra das jazidas de petróleo e de gás natural.

Parente participou de uma reunião no Palácio do Planalto com o presidente Michel Temer, o presidente da Câmara, e os ministros do Planejamento, Dyogo Oliveira, da Casa Civil, Eliseu Padilha, de Minas e Energia, Fernando Coelho Filho, e Mansueto Almeida, secretário de Acompanhamento Econômico do Ministério da Fazenda.

UPDATE 1-Exxon Mobil CEO makes first big changes to refining  - Reuters News

{{20171127T194428.236+0000}}UPDATE 1-Exxon Mobil CEO makes first big changes to refining (Recasts with further Exxon comments)

By Ernest Scheyder and Erwin Seba

HOUSTON, Nov 27 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp Chief Executive Darren Woods is reorganizing the company's refining operations, part of a push to boost profits amid volatile oil and natural gas prices, the company said on Monday.

The changes at the world's largest publicly traded oil producer are the most sweeping to date by Woods, who became chief executive in January after former chief Rex Tillerson resigned to become U.S. secretary of state.

Woods has moved first to reshape the parts of the businesses he knows best, according to sources familiar with the matter. Before taking the helm at Exxon, Woods ran Exxon's refining operations.

Exxon spokeswoman Charlotte Huffaker confirmed the downstream business overhaul in a statement, adding the company expects it will "improve decision making and enhance performance in the market."

The parts of the business impacted were refining and marketing divisions, said spokesman Scott Silvestri.

Company sources told Reuters Exxon's chemical operation also has been restructured, but Silvestri denied this.

It was not immediately clear if the changes will involve job cuts or executive departures. Exxon's Huffaker said she could not say if there would be any impact on jobs.

The reorganization aims to squeeze more profits from the downstream business as the company works to improve its exploration and production operations, which have struggled since 2014 to adjust to lower oil and gas prices .

The downstream restructuring, disclosed internally last month, will combine the fuels and lubricants division with the supply and refining divisions. Financial responsibility for the merged operation will rest with country and regional chiefs who report to Exxon's Irving, Texas, headquarters rather than divisional bosses as previously, according to people familiar with the matter.

The changes are designed to simplify operations and increase accountability for profitability, the sources said.

REFINING STRENGTH

Exxon's refining and chemical operations have grown in stature under Woods, delivering steady earnings compared with its oil and gas production.

Exxon operates 22 refineries in 14 countries, processing nearly 5 million barrels of oil per day. The firm builds chemical and refining plants in the same location, allowing managers to shift production between fuels or chemicals based on demand.

The changes come as Exxon expands the refining division. The company is investing $20 billion through 2022 to expand its chemical and oil refining plants on the U.S. Gulf Coast.

The refining and chemicals arms contributed more than $4.2 billion apiece to 2016 earnings, compared with a $196 million profit from exploration and production. Last year's results were affected by sharply lower crude prices.

In some quarters, Exxon would not have made any money were it not for its refineries.

This year, the company's oil and gas business bounced back to a $5 billion profit during the first nine months on stronger crude prices. Refining earnings were $4.03 billion and chemicals $3.25 billion, respectively, for the first three quarters this year. [nL2N1N20K7]

Some staff members have raised questions as to whether there is any need to alter a system seen as largely successful, said the sources who declined to be identified.

It was unclear if the changes would impact an internal accounting practice known as general interest principle. That rule permits certain transactions to be loss-making for a local division if they are beneficial for the corporation as a whole.

Exxon did not comment on any potential accounting changes.

EXCLUSIVO-Exxon reorganiza operações químicas e de refino - Reuters (Portuguese, Brazil)

{{20171127T164441.057+0000}}EXCLUSIVO-Exxon reorganiza operações químicas e de refinoHOUSTON, 27 Nov (Reuters) - O presidente-executivo da Exxon Mobil , Darren Woods, está reorganizando as operações químicas e de refino da companhia, parte de um esforço para impulsionar lucros em meio à volatilidade nos preços do petróleo e gás natural, disse uma porta-voz.

As mudanças na maior petroleira de capital aberto do mundo são as mais abrangentes já implementadas por Woods, que se tornou presidente-executivo em janeiro após o antigo presidente Rex Tillerson renunciar ao cargo para se tornar secretário de Estado dos Estados Unidos.

Woods tem agido primeiro para remodelar os negócios que conhece melhor, disseram fontes familiarizadas com o tema.

Antes de assumir o comando da Exxon, Woods liderava as operações de refino da companhia e mais cedo em sua carreira foi um executivo sênior da unidade global de químicos.

A reorganização visa tirar mais lucro dos negócios de combustíveis e químicos no momento em que a companhia trabalha para melhorar suas operações de exploração e produção, que estão lutando desde 2014 para ajustar-se aos menores preços do petróleo e gás.

A reestruturação, divulgada internamente no mês passado, combinará a divisão de combustíveis e lubrificantes com as divisões de distribuição e refino.

A responsabilidade financeira da operação de fusão ficará sob os chefes nacional e regionais que reportam à sede da Exxon em Irving, no Texas, ao invés de chefes da divisão como era antes, segundo pessoas familiarizadas com o tema.

A porta-voz da Exxon Charlotte Huffaker confirmou a reestruturação em declaração, acrescentando que a companhia espera que "irá melhorar a tomada de decisões e aumentar a performance no mercado".

EXCLUSIVE-Rising Russian Sakhalin-1 oil output may threaten OPEC deal compliance - Reuters News

* Sakhalin 1 output set to reach 250,000-260,000 bpd

* Exxon seeking permission to raise output - source

By Nidhi Verma and Florence Tan

NEW DELHI/SINGAPORE, Nov 27 (Reuters) - Oil output from Russia's Sakhalin-1 project is set to rise by about a quarter to 250,000-260,000 barrels per day (bpd) from January, sources with knowledge of the plan said, signalling Moscow may find it hard to comply with an extended OPEC output cut.

Russia and the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries will meet in Vienna on Thursday to discuss an extension of the pact to curb output, possibly to the end of 2018. [nL1N1NU1D9][nL8N1NU3GA]

The Sakhalin-1 project, operated by ExxonMobil off the coast of Sakhalin island in Russia's Far East, currently produces about 200,000 bpd.

"From January, total oil production from Sakhalin-1 and a small stream from Rosneft's separate block will be about 250,000 bpd," said one of the sources.

A second source said production will increase to 260,000 bpd in the March quarter from about 190,000 bpd in 2017. A third source said output will rise to more than more than 250,000 bpd.

None of the sources wanted to be identified due to the sensitivity of the issue.

"Exxon is seeking permission to raise output under its development plan and hopeful of getting it later in the year." said the first source.

In the meantime, the joint venture has opted to "front load" production and may cut it later if permission is not granted to keep the annual average intact, this source said.

OPEC, Russia and several other major producers have cut their combined output by about 1.8 million barrels per day since January to reduce bloated inventories and boost oil prices.

Moscow has said it was ready to support extending a deal.

ECONOMIC PAIN

But its economy minister has also said Russia's economy has been hurt by the deal as its dampened investment.

Russia's oil-dependent economy grew an annual 1.8 percent in the September quarter, slowing from 2.5 percent in the second quarter. [nL8N1NT1VC]

Under the current deal that ends in March, Russia agreed to cut output by 300,000 bpd from its level in October 2016.

"Russia may have to cut output from other fields to compensate for a rise in output from Sakhalin-1. It is in Russia's interest to comply with deal to keep oil prices high," said Ehsan Ul-Haq, director of crude oil and refined products at consultancy Resource Economist.

ExxonMobil holds a 30 percent stake in Sakhalin-1, Japan's Sodeco has 30 percent, India's ONGC Videsh holds 20 percent and the rest is controlled by Rosneft.

ONGC Videsh's managing director declined to comment. Exxon was not immediately available to comment.

One of the stumbling blocks for extending the OPEC-led deal is a boom in U.S. oil production , which has jumped by 15 percent since mid-2016 to a record 9.66 million bpd.

U.S. producers, which scaled back output with the price slump after mid-2014, have ramped up production as oil prices climbed . Higher U.S. output undermines the impact of output cuts and erodes market share for others, like Russia.

A recovery in production from Nigeria and Libya - OPEC members exempted from supply cuts due to losses caused by unrest - has also added to supplies and that could force existing participants in the deal to go for deeper cuts.

A key goal of the agreement, lifting prices, has been achieved. Benchmark Brent crude, which tumbled from well above $100 a barrel in 2014 to about $27 in 2016, is back above $60.

"Until now the discipline is very strong as prices were below $60 a barrel ...with a rise in prices many countries stop thinking about consequences of lower oil prices and that could mean low compliance," said Haq.

"Whenever the prices are high than discipline becomes challenging," he added.

HOUSTON, Nov 27 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp Chief Executive Darren Woods is reorganizing the company's refining and chemical operations, part of a push to boost profits amid volatile oil and natural gas prices, a spokeswoman said.

The changes at the world's largest publicly traded oil producer are the most sweeping to date by Woods, who became chief executive in January after former chief Rex Tillerson resigned to become U.S. secretary of state.

Woods has moved first to reshape the businesses he knows best, according to sources familiar with the matter. Before taking the helm at Exxon, Woods ran Exxon's refining operations and earlier in his career was a senior executive in its global chemicals unit.

The reorganization aims to squeeze more profits from the fuel and chemicals businesses as the company works to improve its exploration and production operations, which have struggled since 2014 to adjust to lower oil and gas prices.

The restructuring, disclosed internally last month, will combine the fuels and lubricants division with the supply and refining divisions.

It was unclear if the changes would impact an internal accounting practice known as general interest principle. That rule permits certain transactions to be loss-making for a local division if they are beneficial for the corporation as a whole.

Exxon did not comment on any potential accounting changes.

EXCLUSIF-Exxon Mobil réorganise ses pôles raffinage et chimie - Reuters (French)

{{20171127T094107.603+0000}}EXCLUSIF-Exxon Mobil réorganise ses pôles raffinage et chimieHOUSTON, 27 novembre (Reuters) - Le directeur général d'Exxon Mobil Darren Woods réorganise les activités de raffinage et de chimie du pétrolier afin d'améliorer leur rentabilité sur fond de volatilité des prix du pétrole et du gaz, a déclaré une porte-parole.

Ces changements sont les plus importants opérés à ce jour par Darren Woods, qui a succédé en janvier à Rex Tillerson, devenu secrétaire d'Etat de l'administration Trump.

Darren Woods s'est d'abord attelé à restructurer les activités qu'il connaît le mieux, selon des sources proches du dossier. Avant d'assurer la direction générale d'Exxon, première capitalisation pétrolière mondiale, il en dirigeait les opérations de raffinage et, avant cela, avait eu des responsabilités dans la division chimie.

La restructuration vise à augmenter la rentabilité des carburants et de la chimie, tout en relançant les opérations d'exploration et de production, qui ont beaucoup souffert de l'effondrement des prix du pétrole en 2014.

Cette réorganisation, présentée en interne le mois dernier, regroupera la division carburants et lubrifiants avec celles de la distribution et du raffinage.

La porte-parole d'Exxon Charlotte Huffaker a confirmé ces changements dans un communiqué et ajouté que le groupe espère qu'ils "permettront d'améliorer la chaîne de décision et la performance sur le marché".

Elle a indiqué qu'elle ne pouvait pas dire à ce stade si ces changements auraient des répercussions sur l'emploik.

Exxon gère 22 raffineries dans 14 pays, produisant près de cinq millions de barils de pétrole par jour.

Les activités gazières et pétrolières ont représenté un bénéfice de cinq milliards de dollars (4 milliards d'euros) sur les neuf premiers mois de l'année grâce à la hausse des prix du pétrole , contre 4,03 milliards de dollars pour le raffinage et 3,25 milliards de dollars pour la chimie.

UPDATE 1-Total sells two Norwegian oilfields to Statoil for $1.45 bln - Reuters News

{{20171127T091028.388+0000}}UPDATE 1-Total sells two Norwegian oilfields to Statoil for $1.45 bln* Total says will focus on non-operated assets

* Statoil will become operator of both fields

* Costs overruns, delays have plagued Martin Linge

(Adds details, quotes, background)

PARIS/OSLO, Nov 27 (Reuters) - French oil and gas major Total said on Monday it had agreed to sell its stakes in two Norwegian oilfields to Statoil for $1.45 billion as it reviews its North Sea portfolio after acquiring Denmark's Maersk Oil in August.

The company said Statoil will take over its 51 percent stake in the Martin Linge field and its 40 percent holding in the Garantiana discovery on the Norwegian Continental Shelf.

"The forthcoming acquisition of Maersk Oil... leads us to review our portfolio in this area so as to focus on the assets in which Total will be able to generate synergies and reduce their break-even points," Arnaud Breuillac, Total's head of exploration and production, said in a statement.

The company said that although Norway remains strategically important as one of the largest contributors to its output, it plans to focus on its non-operated assets such as Ekofisk, Snohvit and Johan Sverdrup fields.

Total's decision to scale back its presence in Norway, focusing on non-operated assets, follows a recent trend among foreign oil majors, including BP and Exxon Mobil , to become junior partners in Norwegian fields and concentrate their exploration and field management in less mature regions.

Some have gone even further, with U.S. oil company Hess last month announcing the sale of its Norwegian assets altogether and plans to also divest from the Danish parts of the North Sea. [nL8N1MZ0Y4]

Total said there was limited scope for Total to improve operations in the Martin Linge field which was its only operated asset in Norway, while Statoil was in a better position to optimize the asset. The estimated recoverable resources of the field is in excess of 300 million barrels oil equivalent.

The Martin Linge development has been plagued by delays and cost overruns, with the latest investment estimate seen at 41.3 billion Norwegian crowns ($5.1 billion), about 42 percent more than originally anticipated. [nL8N1MN24C]

The field is expected to start production in 2019 after a one year delay following a fatal accident in May at a South Korean yard building the platform for the field, raising the cost for the project.

Total is also the largest investor in the Garantiana discovery, which is being developed.

Total's shares were down 0.5 percent by 0839 GMT, while Statoil was down 0.54 percent.

EXCLUSIVE-Exxon Mobil chief revamps refining, chemical operations - spokeswoman - Reuters News

{{20171127T060001.022+0000}}EXCLUSIVE-Exxon Mobil chief revamps refining, chemical operations - spokeswomanBy Ernest Scheyder and Erwin Seba

HOUSTON, Nov 27 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp Chief Executive Darren Woods is reorganizing the company's refining and chemical operations, part of a push to boost profits amid volatile oil and natural gas prices, a spokeswoman said.

The changes at the world's largest publicly traded oil producer are the most sweeping to date by Woods, who became chief executive in January after former chief Rex Tillerson resigned to become U.S. secretary of state.

Woods has moved first to reshape the businesses he knows best, according to sources familiar with the matter. Before taking the helm at Exxon, Woods ran Exxon's refining operations and earlier in his career was a senior executive in its global chemicals unit.

The reorganization aims to squeeze more profits from the fuel and chemicals businesses as the company works to improve its exploration and production operations, which have struggled since 2014 to adjust to lower oil and gas prices.

The restructuring, disclosed internally last month, will combine the fuels and lubricants division with the supply and refining divisions. Financial responsibility for the merged operation will rest with country and regional chiefs who report to Exxon's Irving, Texas, headquarters rather than divisional bosses as previously, according to people familiar with the matter.

The changes are designed to simplify operations and increase accountability for profitability, the sources said.

Exxon spokeswoman Charlotte Huffaker confirmed the overhaul in a statement, adding the company expects it will "improve decision making and enhance performance in the market."

It was not immediately clear if the changes will involve job cuts or executive departures. Huffaker said she could not say if there would be any impact on jobs.

REFINING STRENGTH

Exxon's refining and chemical operations have grown in stature under Woods, delivering steady earnings compared to its oil and gas production.

Exxon operates 22 refineries in 14 countries, processing nearly 5 million barrels of oil per day. The firm builds chemical and refining plants in the same location, allowing managers to shift production between fuels or chemicals based on demand.

The changes come as Exxon expands the refining division. The company is investing $20 billion through 2022 to expand its chemical and oil refining plants on the U.S. Gulf Coast.

The refining and chemicals arms contributed more than $4.2 billion apiece to 2016 earnings, compared with a $196 million profit from exploration and production. Last year's results were affected by sharply lower crude prices.

In some quarters, Exxon would not have made any money were it not for its refineries.

This year, the company's oil and gas business bounced back to a $5 billion profit during the first nine months on stronger crude prices . Refining earnings were $4.03 billion and chemicals $3.25 billion, respectively, for the first three quarters this year.

Some staff members have raised questions as to whether there is any need to alter a system seen as largely successful, said the sources who declined to be identified.

It was unclear if the changes would impact an internal accounting practice known as general interest principle. That rule permits certain transactions to be loss-making for a local division if they are beneficial for the corporation as a whole.

Exxon did not comment on any potential accounting changes.

Irak ofrece nueve bloques de petróleo y gas para exploración cerca de fronteras con Irán y Kuwait - Reuters (Spanish)

{{20171126T152523.357+0000}}Irak ofrece nueve bloques de petróleo y gas para exploración cerca de fronteras con Irán y KuwaitPor Ahmed Rasheed

BAGDAD, 26 nov (Reuters) - Irak invitará a firmas de energía extranjeras a participar en la exploración y desarrollo de nueve bloques nuevos de crudo y gas junto a las fronteras de Irán y Kuwait, informó el Ministerio de Petróleo en un comunicado el domingo.

Irak celebrará una conferencia de prensa el lunes para anunciar los detalles de los bloques de exploración, localizados en el sur y en el este del país y que incluyen también un bloque en sus aguas territoriales, según el comunicado.

"El ministerio pretende impulsar tanto la producción como las reservas de crudo y gas en cooperación con compañías internacionales", indicó el comunicado.

Irak ha elevado con rapidez su bombeo en los últimos años con la ayuda de petroleras foráneas, hasta convertirse en el segundo mayor productor de la Organización de Países Exportadores de Petróleo (OPEP) tras Arabia Saudita.

Los bloques ofrecidos están localizados en las provincias de Basora, Misan, Muthanna, Wasit y Diyala.

Los contratos serán diferentes en comparación a los firmados por Irak con compañías extranjeras para desarrollar los gigantescos yacimientos del sur del país, señaló el comunicado.

De acuerdo a los contratos de servicio usados por Bagdad tras las rondas de oferta posteriores a 2003, que incluyen campos sureños como Rumaila, West Qurna y Majnoon, el ministerio paga a las compañías una tarifa fija denominada en dólares por cada barril de crudo producido.

Aunque el modelo funcionó bien para Bagdad cuando los precios del petróleo eran altos, la caída de los precios dejó al gobierno pagando las mismas cantidades a firmas como BP, Exxon, Lukoil y Shell en un momento en que los ingresos procedentes de las ventas de crudo han bajado mucho.

UPDATE 1-Iraq offers nine oil and gas blocks for exploration near Iran, Kuwait borders - Reuters News

{{20171126T113037.667+0000}}UPDATE 1-Iraq offers nine oil and gas blocks for exploration near Iran, Kuwait borders(Adds details, quote, background)

By Ahmed Rasheed

BAGHDAD, Nov 26 (Reuters) - Iraq will invite foreign energy firms to bid for the exploration and development of nine new oil and gas blocks bordering Iran and Kuwait, the oil ministry said in a statement on Sunday.

Iraq is to hold a press conference on Monday to announce details of the exploration blocks which are located in the south and east of the country and include one offshore block in the territorial waters, according to the statement.

"The ministry is targeting to boost both production and reserves of oil and gas in cooperation with international companies," said the ministry statement.

Iraq has raised output rapidly in recent years with the help of foreign oil companies to become OPEC's second-largest producer behind Saudi Arabia.

The blocks on offer are located in the provinces of Basra, Misan, Muthanna, Wasit and the Central Diyala province.

The contracts will be different from previous service contracts Iraq signed with foreign firms to develop the country's giant southern fields, said the statement.

Under the service contracts used for Baghdad's post-2003 bidding rounds, including those for its southern fields like Rumaila, West Qurna and Majnoon, the ministry pays companies a fixed dollar-denominated fee for every barrel of oil produced.

While the model worked well for Baghdad when oil prices were high, the slump in prices left Baghdad paying the same fees to firms like BP, Exxon, Lukoil and Shell at a time when revenue from oil sales was significantly lower.

POINT MARCHÉS-Records à Wall Street pour le "Black Friday" - Reuters (French)

{{20171124T200030.991+0000}}POINT MARCHÉS-Records à Wall Street pour le "Black Friday"* Gains de 0,14% pour le Dow, de 0,20% pour le S&P, de 0,32% pour le Nasdaq

* Les valeurs de la distribution à la hausse, Amazon et Macy's en vedette

* Le pétrole à un plus haut de plus de deux ans

par Tanya Agrawal

24 novembre (Reuters) - La Bourse de New York a terminé en hausse vendredi la séance raccourcie du "Black Friday", le S&P 500 et le Nasdaq battant leurs records à la faveur d'une hausse d'Amazon et des valeurs de la distribution avec le solide départ de la période commerciale des fêtes de fin d'année aux Etats-Unis.

Les secteurs des ressources de base et de l'énergie, soutenus par la hausse des cours des matières premières, ont aussi contribué à la progression de Wall Street.

Après deux années décevantes, les consommateurs sont au rendez-vous aussi bien sur les sites de commerce en ligne que dans les grands magasins, ont dit des analystes et des cabinets de consultants spécialisés.

L'indice Dow Jones <.DJI> a gagné 31,81 points (0,14%) à 23.557,99. Le S&P-500 <.SPX>, plus large, a pris 5,34 points, soit 0,20% à 2.602,42 points, record en clôture après un nouveau plus haut en séance, tandis que le Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> a avancé de son côté de 21,80 points (0,32%) à 6,889,16 points, un record en clôture juste en-dessous de son plus haut du jour.

Sur l'ensemble de la semaine, le Dow et le S&P ont gagné respectivement 0,85% et 0,9%, affichant leur première performance positive en trois semaines. Le Nasdaq s'est adjugé près de 1,6%, enregistrant sa meilleure performance depuis la première semaine du mois de septembre.

L'indice du compartiment de la distribution <.SPXRT> a terminé en hausse de 0,75%, lui aussi juste en-dessous du record atteint durant la séance, emmené par Amazon qui a pris 2,58%.

"Amazon est extrêmement important pour le secteur de la distribution et le fait qu'Amazon ait continué de progresser augure bien de la période commerciale de fin d'année et des perspectives de Wall Street", a dit Adam Sarhan, directeur général de 50 Park Investments.

Les distributeurs traditionnels qui ont renforcé leur présence en ligne ont aussi été recherchés.

Macy's a terminé en hausse de 2,1%. Le directeur général de la chaîne de grands magasins a déclaré à CNBC que l'entreprise était en meilleure posture cette année que l'année dernière et qu'elle avait enregistré une solide demande en ligne.

D'autres grandes enseignes comme Kohl's , Gap et J.C. Penney ont terminé sur des hausses de 1% à 1,6%. Wal Mart a gagné 0,23%.

Certains distributeurs sont toutefois restés à l'écart de la hausse du secteur comme Target qui cède 2,8% et Bed Bath & Beyond qui abandonne 1,9%.

LES VENTES EN LIGNES SCRUTÉES

"Les investisseurs vont attacher beaucoup d'importance à la répartition des achats entre commerce en ligne et commerces traditionnels", a dit Andre Bakhos, directeur général de Janlyn Capital.

Le consultant Adobe Analytics a indiqué que les ventes en ligne ont connu un "solide début" pour ce Black Friday, représentant 640 millions de dollars (536 millions d'euros) dans les premières heures, en hausse de 18,4% par rapport à l'année dernière. Le consultant anticipe une progression de 13,8% sur l'ensemble de la journée.

Toujours selon Adobe Analytics, les consommateurs américains ont dépensé jeudi 2,87 milliards de dollars (2,4 milliards d'euros) en ligne à l'occasion de Thanksgiving, soit une progression de 18,3%. De nombreux magasins ont également enregistré un regain d'affluence, ayant ouvert leurs portes plus tôt à la veille du Black Friday.

Huit des onze principaux compartiments sectoriels du S&P ont terminé en hausse avec par exemple l'indice des valeurs technologiques <.SPLRCT> qui s'adjuge 0,54% suivi par celui de des matériaux de base <.SPLRCM> et de l'énergie <.SPNY> qui prennent respectivement 0,45% et 0,27% avec la hausse des cours des matières premières et du pétrole.

Les cours du brut léger américain ont progressé de plus de 1,5% à un plus haut de plus de deux ans à près de 59 dollars le baril après la fermeture partielle de l'important oléoduc nord-américain Keystone, qui se traduit par une réduction de l'offre aux Etats-Unis.

Le cuivre s'est rapproché d'un plus haut d'un mois, soutenu par le recul du dollar et une baisse des approvisionnements.

Les volumes échangés ont porté sur 2,68 milliards de titres, très en deçà de la moyenne de 6,48 milliards de titres des 20 dernières séances.

Sur le marché des changes, le dollar est en net repli, son indice contre un panier de devises de référence <.DXI> tombant à un plus bas depuis fin septembre à 92,8.

Le billet vert pâti à la fois de la vigueur de l'euro porté par le dynamisme de l'économie européenne et du plafonnement des taux aux Etats-Unis dans un contexte de faiblesse persistante de l'inflation.

Les rendements des Treasuries se sont très légèrement tendus sans sortir de la fourchette étroite dans laquelle ils évoluent depuis une semaine et demi avec le regain de doute des investisseurs sur une remontée de l'inflation.

Le rendement de l'emprunt de référence à 10 ans ressort à 2,34% contre 2,32% mercredi, à la veille d'une journée de clôture des marchés Thanksgiving.

Hoegh LNG pulls out of Pakistan LNG import project - Reuters News

{{20171124T135123.761+0000}}Hoegh LNG pulls out of Pakistan LNG import projectLONDON, Nov 24 (Reuters) - Shipping company Hoegh LNG on Friday cancelled a deal to provide a floating import terminal for a liquefied natural gas (LNG) project being developed by Turkish company Global Energy Infrastructure Limited (GEI) in Pakistan.

This month Hoegh LNG announced the consortium behind the project, including Exxon Mobil , France's Total and Qatar Petroleum , had dissolved due to unresolved differences with GEI, adding that it was evaluating its own options.

Hoegh LNG was due to supply the project's ship-based import terminal, a floating storage and regasification unit (FSRU), where LNG brought in by tanker is converted back to gas to feed into Pakistan's grid.

The project was set to be Pakistan's third and biggest by import capacity, starting in late 2018 or early 2019.

"Hoegh LNG has considered its options under the contract with GEI, and has today informed GEI that it has concluded to terminate the FSRU charter agreement signed 15 December 2016," it said in a stock market announcement.

Last month Reuters reported that Exxon Mobil pulled out of the project owing to disagreements with GEI and that Total and Mitsubishi could also quit and join a rival scheme.

The shipping company said it is holding multiple discussions about finding alternative employment for the FSRU and hopes to clinch a deal before the end of 2018.

IMF credit to Chad delayed over Glencore oil debt - Reuters News

{{20171124T105431.573+0000}}IMF credit to Chad delayed over Glencore oil debt* Only $48.8 million of IMF's $300 million credit paid out

* Sacking of finance minister may delay Glencore talks

* Chad's oil firm seeks lower overall interest rate

By Julia Payne and Madjiasra Nako

LONDON/N'DJAMENA, Nov 24 (Reuters) - Chad's stalled talks with Glencore on restructuring more than $1 billion in debt due to the trading firm has delayed the release of IMF funds for the struggling central African country until at least early next year, sources familiar with the matter said.

The International Monetary Fund has said Chad's external commercial debt, most of which is to Glencore, was unsustainable as it eats up most of the country's oil revenues.

The fund approved just over $300 million in credit for Chad at the end of June. The IMF initially released $48.8 million to Chad but said the release of further funds would depend on progress reports at subsequent meetings.

Negotiations are likely to be further delayed after President Idriss Deby sacked his Finance Minister Christian Georges Diguimbaye and the deputy. [nL8N1NT43J]

A Chadian government source said a mid-November deadline for Chad to report progress on commercial debt talks to the IMF was missed and IMF funds would not be released until early 2018.

"Chad's case was to be discussed by an IMF council on Nov. 15 but a commercial agreement with Glencore was needed for this to be valid. As this did not occur, the case will be submitted in December for a fund release in January or February," the source said.

A second Chadian government source also said the next disbursement from the IMF had been delayed.

The IMF said at the end of June that the "remaining amount will be phased over the duration of the programme, subject to semi-annual reviews." The programme lasts three years.

An IMF spokesman did not respond to requests for comment by phone and email. A spokesman for Glencore declined to comment.

A series of meetings in Paris this month ended without a deal. After the meetings, commodities trader and miner Glencore wrote a letter copied to the IMF reiterating its offer. [nL8N1NL5GO]

A spokesman for Chad's state-run oil firm Societe des Hydrocarbures du Tchad (SHT) said the firm was seeking an overall reduction on the interest rate from "about 9 percent to a maximum of 5 percent, including Libor."

Glencore said in its letter it had offered a temporary interest rate reduction to Libor plus 4 percent along with a grace period on principal until the last quarter of 2019, down from 6.75 percent.

Two banking sources said that the proposal was still being evaluated by Chad.

At the moment, Chad still owes about $1.3 billion from the original $1.45 billion that Glencore and a consortium of lenders loaned the country in 2014 in exchange for crude.

SHT used those funds to buy a 25 percent stake in the major oil producing Doba Consortium from Chevron.

Despite being one of the world's poorest nations, its army played a major role in reclaiming territory back from Boko Haram, an Islamist militant group that took over large swathes of Nigeria's northeast in 2014 including key border towns.

Chad continues to help regional security initiatives, including a U.N. peacekeeping mission in Mali.

LONDON/N'DJAMENA, Nov 24 (Reuters) - Chad's stalled talks with Glencore on restructuring more than $1 billion in debt due to the trading firm has delayed the release of IMF funds for the struggling central African country until at least early next year, sources familiar with the matter said.

CORRECTED-Exxon joins European oil firms in initiative to limit emissions - Reuters News

{{20171123T095328.134+0000}}CORRECTED-Exxon joins European oil firms in initiative to limit emissions(Corrects paragraph 4 to read "...according to consultancy Wood Mackenzie..." instead of "...according to Shell...")

By Ron Bousso

LONDON, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil joined European peers including Royal Dutch Shell and Total in a new initiative to find ways to reduce potent emissions in their rapidly growing natural gas operations.

BP , Italy's Eni , Exxon, Spain's Repsol , Shell, Norway's Statoil , Total and Wintershall "committed to further reduce methane emissions from the natural gas assets," they said in a joint statement.

Methane, one of the most potent greenhouse gases emitted into the atmosphere, is released during the extraction, processing and transporting of natural gas.

For example, around 10 percent of gas transformed into liquefied natural gas (LNG) is released into the atmosphere between production and consumption, according to consultancy Wood Mackenzie.[nL5N1LZ4K9]

The new initiative is the latest step by the world's leading oil and gas companies to reduce carbon emissions from their operations to help meet U.N.-backed goals to limit global warming.

Last year, a group of ten companies set up the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative (OGCI), representing more than 20 percent of the world's production. Exxon did not join that initiative.

UPDATE 1-ExxonMobil stops non-essential work in PNG highlands due to unrest - Reuters News

{{20171123T015113.240+0000}}UPDATE 1-ExxonMobil stops non-essential work in PNG highlands due to unrest* Unrest escalates in PNG highlands

* Non-essential staff evacuated after worker was abducted

* PNG LNG still operating, Oil Search operations normal

(Adds ExxonMobil comment on abduction)

MELBOURNE, Nov 23 (Reuters) - ExxonMobil has evacuated non-essential staff working in the highlands of Papua New Guinea due to unrest in the area, but operations are continuing at its PNG LNG liquefied natural gas project, the company said on Thursday.

"Due to recent community tension in the Highlands (Hides, Angore, Komo), ExxonMobil PNG has suspended non-essential work," the company said in a statement emailed to Reuters. It declined to specify the nature of "non-essential" work.

It said its gas conditioning plant at Hides, which processes gas before it is sent via a 760-kilometre (472-mile) pipeline to the PNG LNG export plant at Port Moresby, is continuing to operate.

"ExxonMobil PNG continues to monitor the situation in Hela Province. The safety and security of our employees, contractors and the local community is a top priority," the company said, adding that non-essential staff have been moved out of the area.

Violence has escalated in the highlands, where gas is produced for the LNG project, due to anger among locals over the nation's election process earlier this year and disputes over royalties from the PNG LNG project, an observer said.

"In fact the situation is so bad that I am unable to travel to my field site," Michael Main, an Australian doctoral student who has regularly been in and out of the highlands for his research, told Reuters.

One of ExxonMobil's staff in Angore was abducted last week but was later safely released, ExxonMobil said.

"We are taking very seriously the incident," the company said.

Oil Search Ltd , which operates oil and gas fields in the area and is a partner in PNG LNG, said there has been no impact on its operations and its staff are working as normal.

Australia's Santos Ltd , which recently rebuffed a $7.2 billion takeover approach, is also a partner in PNG LNG.

ExxonMobil stops non-essential work in PNG highlands due to unrest - Reuters News

{{20171122T233728.379+0000}}ExxonMobil stops non-essential work in PNG highlands due to unrestMELBOURNE, Nov 23 (Reuters) - ExxonMobil has evacuated non-essential staff in the highlands of Papua New Guinea, it said on Thursday, due to unrest in the area, but said operations are continuing at its PNG LNG liquefied natural gas project.

Main said one of ExxonMobil's camps in the highlands had been attacked and an ex-patriate security staff member had been kidnapped and released earlier this week. Radio New Zealand also reported the kidnapping on Thursday. ExxonMobil declined to comment.

"For safety and security reasons, we do not discuss details of our personnel or operations," ExxonMobil said.

Oil Search Ltd , which operates oil and gas fields in the area and is a partner in PNG LNG, said there has been no impact on its operations and its staff are working as normal.

Рост цен на нефть окажет поддержку Уолл-стрит при открытии - Reuters (Russian)

{{20171122T142245.571+0000}}Рост цен на нефть окажет поддержку Уолл-стрит при открытии22 ноя (Рейтер) - Рост цен на нефть в среду подтолкнул вверх фьючерсы на фондовые индексы США, однако инвесторы проявляют осторожность на фоне падения акций Hewlett Packard после заявления главы компании о намерении уйти в отставку, а также в преддверии публикации протокола последнего заседания ФРС.

Глава Федеральной резервной системы Джанет Йеллен во вторник подтвердила свой прогноз о том, что инфляция в США в скором времени восстановится, но сделала одну весьма важную оговорку: она "очень не уверена" в этом и не исключает возможности того, что цены останутся низкими еще многие годы [nL8N1NS0FX].

Протокол октябрьского заседания Комитета по операциям на открытом рынке ФРС будет опубликован в 22.00 МСК.

Цены на американскую нефть подскочили в среду почти на 2 процента, впервые с июля 2015 года достигнув отметки $58 за баррель, на фоне ограничения трубопроводных поставок сырья из Канады в США, а также за счет надежд на продление глобального пакта ОПЕК+.

Акции нефтяных гигантов Chevron и Exxon прибавили в цене по полпроцента, а бумаги Schlumberger выросли на 1 процент.

Акции Hewlett Packard Enterprise упали на 6 процентов в ходе торгов до официального открытия биржевой сессии, после того как глава компании Мэг Уитмен объявила, что уйдет в отставку в феврале.

Бумаги Deere & Co подорожали примерно на 5 процентов, так как американская машиностроительная компания сообщила, что ждет хорошей прибыли в 2018 финансовом году, и отчиталась о квартальных результатах, превысивших прогнозы Уолл-стрит [nL8N1NS3HH].

К 17.15 МСК фьючерсы на индекс Dow Jones <1YMc1> поднялись на 0,18 процента, на S&P 500 - на 0,09 процента, а на Nasdaq 100 - на 0,13 процента.

* Futures up: Dow 40 pts, S&P 2.5 pts, Nasdaq 9 pts

By Sruthi Shankar

Nov 22 (Reuters) - A jump in U.S. crude prices prodded U.S. stock futures higher on Wednesday, with traders' eyes on a slide in Hewlett Packard shares after its chief executive said she would leave, as well as minutes from the Federal Reserve's latest policy meeting.

Trading volumes were thin ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday on Thursday and an early close on Friday, but investors will scrutinize the minutes for Fed's thinking on inflation for more clarity on what it might do under a new chair next year.

A final quarter-point rise under Janet Yellen next month is almost fully baked in to short-term interest rates, underlining the Fed's continuing optimism about the economy. But the pace of rises is also slow enough not to scare stock investors who have thrived on a decade of cheap money.

"On this eve of Thanksgiving, the market is attempting to maintain an upward bias with oil prices and the macro news leading the way," Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at First Standard Financial, wrote in a note.

"We look for a fairly mixed to positive session."

At 8:28 a.m. ET (1228 GMT), Dow e-minis <1YMc1> were up 40 points, or 0.17 percent, with 22,222 contracts changing hands.

S&P 500 e-minis gained 2.5 points, or 0.1 percent, on 130,840 contracts traded while Nasdaq 100 e-minis rose 9 points, or 0.14 percent, on volume of 27,045 contracts.

All of Wall Street's main indexes closed at record levels on Tuesday after a bounce in technology stocks, by far the best performing sector of the market this year.

One blip in that area was the 6-percent drop in Hewlett Packard Enterprise shares in premarket after Chief Executive Meg Whitman said she would leave in February six years into the job. [nL3N1NR5AB]

HP Inc , comprising the computer and printer business that Whitman carved out of the old Hewlett Packard, was also down 4.7 percent after reporting an unimpressive profit.

U.S. light crude jumped nearly 2 percent on Wednesday, hitting $58 a barrel for the first time since July 2015 as a major pipeline cut Canadian deliveries to the United States, where inventories are already said to be falling. [O/R]

Oil majors Chevron and Exxon both rose half a percent and sector services provider Schlumberger gained 1 percent.

One other big gainer was U.S. tractor maker Deere & Co which rose about 5 percent after reporting upbeat quarterly earnings and issuing a strong profit forecast for the year. [nL3N1NS3MK]

The Fed's Open Market Committee releases minutes of its October policy meeting at 2:00 p.m. ET (1800 GMT).

EXCLUSIVE-Iraq looks to Kuwait gas pipeline to pay off reparations - Reuters News

{{20171122T132103.713+0000}}EXCLUSIVE-Iraq looks to Kuwait gas pipeline to pay off reparations* Iraq under pressure from World Bank to cut gas flaring

* Kuwait offers state guarantees for the project -sources

* Kuwait looking for alternatives to Qatar gas

* Project a challenge to Shell's Iraqi gas projects

By Rania El Gamal, Osamu Tsukimori and Dmitry Zhdannikov

DUBAI/TOKYO/LONDON, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Iraq has hired Japan's Toyo Engineering <6330.T> to help build a gas pipeline to Kuwait and a related petrochemical plant as Baghdad looks to reduce flaring and finish paying reparations owed for its 1990 invasion of its neighbour.

The project, details of which have not been reported before, would allow Kuwait to diversify its gas imports in the wake a political crisis between Gulf states and major supplier Qatar.

It would also deal a blow to Royal Dutch Shell , which aimed to be the dominant gas player in Iraq before relations with Baghdad soured following Shell's exit from large oil projects.

"Iraq needs to urgently reduce gas flaring as it trails behind all targets it has promised the World Bank," said a senior industry source working on the project but not allowed to discuss it publicly.

"The Kuwaiti gas project is a quick fix and an easy way to monetise gas resources."

The World Bank, which has repeatedly made reducing gas flaring a condition of lending to Baghdad, did not respond to a request for immediate comment.

Toyo is proposing to construct a gas pipeline and start deliveries after 2019, industry sources said.

Toyo's chief financial officer, Kensuke Waki, told Reuters that talks about a pipeline and a petrochemical plant were ongoing but a final investment decision had not yet been made.

Kuwait is very keen on the project and has offered a sovereign guarantee for up to 80 percent of the costs, industry sources said. No total cost has been announced.

Kuwait's oil ministry did not respond to a request for immediate comment. Oil minister Issam Al-Marzouq said last month that talks between Kuwait and Iraq were focused on a proposal to use gas to help pay Baghdad's final $4.6 billion in war compensation payments.

Iraqi oil ministry spokesman Asim Jihad said talks were focusing on price and confirmed that supplies could be used to help pay off reparations.

DIFFERENCES OVER PRICE, PLANT

Industry sources told Reuters the talks have faltered over price, however.

They said Kuwait is pushing for a price of less than $3 per mbtu (million British thermal unit), in line with U.S. Henry Hub prices. But that is less than half what Iraq pays in the north when importing gas from neighbouring Iran.

"The price of gas remains the key sticking point for now," one of the sources said.

He also said both Iraq and Kuwait were pushing to have the petrochemical plant built on their territory to further capitalise on gas deliveries.

Discussions with Iraq are ongoing, a senior Kuwaiti oil industry source with knowledge of the project said, adding that it was not yet clear if gas would come from West Qurna 2 operated by Russia's Lukoil or from Rumaila, operated by BP .

Iraq used to supply Kuwait with gas from Rumaila. Volumes reached as much as 400 mcf per day but stopped shortly after the 1990 invasion.

More than a million claimants in Kuwait have been paid as part of Baghdad's $52.4 billion reparations bill for the invasion. But Iraq, hurt by the 2014 fall in oil prices and its war with Islamic State militants, requested a delay on the last and largest tranche, which is due this year.

CHALLENGE TO SHELL

Kuwait, although one of OPEC's leading oil producers, has struggled to meet growing domestic gas demand. The shortfall has been estimated at 500 million cubic feet per day and is being covered mainly by LNG imports, including from Qatar.

A decade ago Kuwait tried to build a pipeline from Qatar, but the move was blocked by Saudi Arabia. With relations between Riyadh and Doha worsening this year, Kuwait is looking to diversify its gas imports.

Last year, Kuwait said it would be ready to buy up to 200 mcf/day of gas from Baghdad.

Iraqi oil ministry spokesman Jihad said volumes could start at 50 mcf/d rising gradually to 200 mcf/d.

Iraq's gas reserves of 3.7 trillion cubic metres rank as 12th largest in the world but represent only a tenth of those of Iran, the world's largest.

It extracts large quantities of gas together with oil, however, and that gas is currently being flared.

Iraq's gas development plans have long focused on the Basra gas company, a $17 billion, 25-year project in which Iraq has 51 percent, Shell owns 44 percent and Japan's Mitsubishi Corp <8058.T> 5 percent.

The project was designed to aggregate gas from fields in the south including West Qurna 1 operated by Exxon Mobil Corp , Zubair operated by Italy's ENI and BP's Rumaila.

"Shell's main aim was always to develop an LNG terminal and ultimately a petchem complex in Iraq," said a Shell insider who worked on the gas project.

With Iraq refusing to agree on a gas price with Shell, the project has hit a major impasse, industry sources said. Talks have also been complicated by Shell pulling out of the Majnoon oil fields earlier this year.

"Iraq is furious at Shell and prospects don't look that great for the Basra gas company," one Iraqi industry source said.

Asked about the negotiations, both Shell and the Iraqi oil ministry said discussions were ongoing and both sides remained committed to the project.

EXCLUSIVO-Tillerson sob fogo: diplomatas dos EUA o acusam de violar lei sobre crianças-soldados - Reuters (Portuguese, Brazil)

{{20171121T221034.907+0000}}EXCLUSIVO-Tillerson sob fogo: diplomatas dos EUA o acusam de violar lei sobre crianças-soldadosPor Jason Szep e Matt Spetalnick

WASHINGTON, 21 Nov (Reuters) - Um grupo de cerca de uma dúzia de autoridades do Departamento de Estado norte-americano tomou o incomum passo de acusar formalmente o secretário de Estado, Rex Tillerson, por violação de uma lei federal elaborada para impedir que exércitos estrangeiros alistem crianças-soldados, de acordo com um documento interno revisado pela Reuters.

Um memorando confidencial "dissidente" do Departamento de Estado não relatado anteriormente informou que Tillerson violou a Lei de Prevenção de Crianças-Soldados quando decidiu em junho excluir o Iraque, Mianmar e Afeganistão de uma lista norte-americana de infratores no uso de crianças-soldados. Isto aconteceu apesar do departamento reconhecer publicamente que crianças estavam sendo recrutadas nestes países.

Manter estes países fora da lista anual torna mais fácil o fornecimento de assistência militar dos EUA para eles. O Iraque e Afeganistão são aliados próximos na luta contra militantes islâmicos, enquanto Mianmar é um aliado emergente para contrabalançar a influência da China no sudeste asiático.

Documentos analisados pela Reuters também mostram que a decisão de Tillerson foi contrária a uma recomendação unânime dos chefes de escritórios regionais do Departamento de Estado supervisionando embaixadas no Oriente Médio e Ásia, dos enviados dos EUA ao Afeganistão e Paquistão, do escritório de direitos humanos do departamento e de advogados de dentro do departamento.

"Além de infringir a lei dos EUA, esta decisão arrisca prejudicar a credibilidade de uma ampla gama de relatórios e análises do Departamento de Estado e enfraqueceu uma das principais ferramentas diplomáticas do governo dos EUA para dissuadir forças armadas governamentais e grupos armados apoiados pelo governo de recrutarem e usarem crianças em funções de combate e apoio ao redor do mundo", informou o memorando de 28 de julho.

A Reuters relatou em junho que Tillerson havia desconsiderado recomendações internas sobre o Iraque, Mianmar e Afeganistão. Os novos documentos revelam a extensão da oposição no Departamento de Estado, incluindo o raro uso do que é conhecido como "canal dissidente", que permite que autoridades contestem políticas sem medo de represálias.

As visões expressas pelas autoridades norte-americanas ilustram tensões contínuas entre diplomatas de carreira e o ex-chefe da Exxon Mobil Corp , nomeado pelo presidente Donald Trump para seguir uma abordagem "América Primeiro" na diplomacia.

INTERPRETANDO A LEI

A lei de crianças-soldados aprovada em 2008 indica que o governo dos EUA deve estar convencido de que nenhuma criança abaixo dos 18 anos "seja alistada, recrutada ou de outra forma obrigada a servir como criança-soldado" para que um país seja removido da lista. O estatuto se estende especificamente para forças militares governamentais e grupos armados apoiados pelo governo, como milícias.

A lista atualmente inclui a República Democrática do Congo, Nigéria, Somália, Sudão do Sul, Mali, Sudão, Síria e Iêmen.

"O secretário revisou minuciosamente todas as informações apresentadas para ele e fez uma determinação sobre se os fatos apresentados justificavam uma listagem de acordo com a lei", disse um porta-voz do Departamento de Estado quando perguntado sobre as acusações de autoridades de que Tillerson havia violado a lei.

Em uma resposta escrita ao memorando dissidente em 1º de setembro, o assessor de Tillerson, Brian Hook, reconheceu que os três países usam crianças-soldados. Ele disse, no entanto, que é necessário distinguir entre governos "fazendo pouco ou nenhum esforço para corrigir suas violações de crianças-soldados... e os que estão fazendo sinceros – se ainda incompletos – esforços".

Hook deixou claro que o diplomata mais sênior dos EUA usou o que ele vê como seu critério para interpretar a lei.

{{20171121T215706.938+0000}}UPDATE 1-Exxon Beaumont refinery shuts coker for repair -sources(Adds company no comment, background on unit)

HOUSTON, Nov 21 (Reuters) - ExxonMobil Corp began shutting the coker at its 362,300-barrel-per-day (bpd) Port Arthur, Texas, refinery on Tuesday to repair a leak, said sources familiar with plant operations.

Exxon spokeswoman Charlotte Huffaker declined to comment about Beaumont operations. She said Exxon continues to meet its contractual commitments.

The repairs on the 45,000-bpd delayed coking unit are expected to finish by early next week, the sources said.

Cokers convert residual crude from distillation units to feedstock for motor fuels or into petroleum coke, a substitute for coal. A delayed coking unit removes coke at 12-hour or 24-hour intervals.

UPDATE 2-U.S. diplomats accuse Tillerson of breaking child soldiers law - Reuters News

{{20171121T215350.418+0000}}UPDATE 2-U.S. diplomats accuse Tillerson of breaking child soldiers law(Adds State Department comment, Tillerson sidestepping question)

By Jason Szep and Matt Spetalnick

WASHINGTON, Nov 21 (Reuters) - A group of about a dozen U.S. State Department officials have taken the unusual step of formally accusing Secretary of State Rex Tillerson of violating a federal law designed to stop foreign militaries from enlisting child soldiers, according to internal documents reviewed by Reuters.

A confidential State Department "dissent" memo, which Reuters was first to report on, said Tillerson breached the Child Soldiers Prevention Act when he decided in June to exclude Iraq, Myanmar, and Afghanistan from a U.S. list of offenders in the use of child soldiers. This was despite the department publicly acknowledging that children were being conscripted in those countries. [http://tmsnrt.rs/2jJ7pav ]

Keeping the countries off the annual list makes it easier to provide them with U.S. military assistance. Iraq and Afghanistan are close allies in the fight against Islamist militants, while Myanmar is an emerging ally to offset China's influence in Southeast Asia.

Documents reviewed by Reuters also show Tillerson's decision was at odds with a unanimous recommendation by the heads of the State Department's regional bureaus overseeing embassies in the Middle East and Asia, the U.S. envoy on Afghanistan and Pakistan, the department's human rights office and its own in-house lawyers. [http://tmsnrt.rs/2Ah6tB4 ]

"Beyond contravening U.S. law, this decision risks marring the credibility of a broad range of State Department reports and analyses and has weakened one of the U.S. government's primary diplomatic tools to deter governmental armed forces and government-supported armed groups from recruiting and using children in combat and support roles around the world," said the July 28 memo.

State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert, questioned at length by reporters on the issue at her daily briefing, strongly defended Tillerson's decision as valid and in "technical compliance with the law in the way he read it."

"No one in the United States government likes the idea of the use of child soldiers," she said. "It's abhorrent.

Asked at a photo opportunity with the visiting Peruvian foreign minister about his decision, Tillerson sidestepped any direct response to the dissenting officials' complaint.

Reuters reported in June that Tillerson had disregarded internal recommendations on Iraq, Myanmar and Afghanistan. The new documents reveal the scale of the opposition in the State Department, including the rare use of what is known as the "dissent channel," which allows officials to object to policies without fear of reprisals.[nL1N1JK1X9]

The views expressed by the U.S. officials illustrate ongoing tensions between career diplomats and the former chief of Exxon Mobil Corp appointed by President Donald Trump to pursue an "America First" approach to diplomacy.

INTERPRETING THE LAW

The child soldiers law passed in 2008 states that the U.S. government must be satisfied that no children under the age of 18 "are recruited, conscripted or otherwise compelled to serve as child soldiers" for a country to be removed from the list. The statute extends specifically to government militaries and government-supported armed groups like militias.

The list currently includes the Democratic Republic of Congo, Nigeria, Somalia, South Sudan, Mali, Sudan, Syria and Yemen.

In a written response to the dissent memo on Sept. 1, Tillerson adviser Brian Hook acknowledged that the three countries did use child soldiers. He said, however, it was necessary to distinguish between governments "making little or no effort to correct their child soldier violations ... and those which are making sincere - if as yet incomplete - efforts." [http://tmsnrt.rs/2zWGRt0 ]

Hook made clear that America's top diplomat used what he sees as his discretion to interpret the law.

'A POWERFUL MESSAGE'

Foreign militaries on the list are prohibited from receiving aid, training and weapons from Washington unless the White House issues a waiver based on U.S. "national interest." In 2016, under the Obama administration, both Iraq and Myanmar, as well as others such as Nigeria and Somalia, received waivers.

At times, the human rights community chided President Barack Obama for being too willing to issue waivers and exemptions, especially for governments that had security ties with Washington, instead of sanctioning more of those countries. "Human Rights Watch frequently criticized President Barack Obama for giving too many countries waivers, but the law has made a real difference," Jo Becker, advocacy director for the group's children's rights division, wrote in June in a critique of Tillerson's decision.

The dissenting U.S. officials stressed that Tillerson's decision to exclude Iraq, Afghanistan and Myanmar went a step further than the Obama administration's waiver policy by contravening the law and effectively easing pressure on the countries to eradicate the use of child soldiers.

The officials acknowledged in the documents reviewed by Reuters that those three countries had made progress. But in their reading of the law, they said that was not enough to be kept off a list that has been used to shame governments into completely eradicating the use of child soldiers.

'UNCONSCIONABLE ACTIONS'

Ben Cardin, ranking Democrat on the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, wrote to Tillerson on Friday saying there were "serious concerns that the State Department may not be complying" with the law and that the secretary's decision "sent a powerful message to these countries that they were receiving a pass on their unconscionable actions."

The memo was among a series of previously unreported documents sent this month to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the State Department's independent inspector general's office that relate to allegations that Tillerson violated the child soldiers law.

Legal scholars say that because of the executive branch's latitude in foreign policy there is little legal recourse to counter Tillerson's decision.

Herman Schwartz, a constitutional law professor at American University in Washington, said U.S. courts would be unlikely to accept any challenge to Tillerson's interpretation of the child soldiers law as allowing him to remove a country from the list on his own discretion.

The signatories to the document were largely senior policy experts with years of involvement in the issues, said an official familiar with the matter. Reuters saw a copy of the document that did not include the names of those who signed it.

Tillerson's decision to remove Iraq and Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, from the list and reject a recommendation by U.S. officials to add Afghanistan was announced in the release of the government's annual human trafficking report on June 27.

Six days earlier, a previously unreported memo emailed to Tillerson from a range of senior diplomats said the three countries violated the law based on evidence gathered by U.S. officials in 2016 and recommended that he approve them for the new list.

It noted that in Iraq, the United Nations and non-governmental organizations "reported that some Sunni tribal forces ... recruited and used persons younger than the age of 18, including instances of children taking a direct part in hostilities."

Ali Kareem, who heads Iraq's High Committee for Human Rights, denied the country's military or state-backed militias use child soldiers. "We can say today with full confidence that we have a clean slate on child recruitment issues," he said.

The memo also said "two confirmed cases of child recruitment" by the Myanmar military "were documented during the reporting period." Human rights advocates have estimated that dozens of children are still conscripted there.

Myanmar government spokesman Zaw Htay challenged accusers to provide details of where and how child soldiers are being used. He noted that in the latest State Department report on human trafficking, "they already recognized (Myanmar) for reducing of child soldiers" – though the report also made clear some children were still conscripted.

The memo said further there was "credible evidence" that a government-supported militia in Afghanistan "recruited and used a child," meeting the minimum threshold of a single confirmed case that the State Department had previously used as the legal basis for putting a country on the list.

The Afghan defense and interior ministries both denied there were any child soldiers in Afghan national security forces, an assertion that contradicts the State Department's reports and human rights activists.

EXCLUSIVE-Tillerson under fire: U.S. diplomats accuse him of breaking child soldiers law - Reuters News

{{20171121T175157.713+0000}}EXCLUSIVE-Tillerson under fire: U.S. diplomats accuse him of breaking child soldiers law(Adds reaction)

By Jason Szep and Matt Spetalnick

WASHINGTON, Nov 21 (Reuters) - A group of about a dozen U.S. State Department officials have taken the unusual step of formally accusing Secretary of State Rex Tillerson of violating a federal law designed to stop foreign militaries from enlisting child soldiers, according to internal documents reviewed by Reuters.

A confidential State Department "dissent" memo not previously reported said Tillerson breached the Child Soldiers Prevention Act when he decided in June to exclude Iraq, Myanmar, and Afghanistan from a U.S. list of offenders in the use of child soldiers. This was despite the department publicly acknowledging that children were being conscripted in those countries. [http://tmsnrt.rs/2jJ7pav ]

Keeping the countries off the annual list makes it easier to provide them with U.S. military assistance. Iraq and Afghanistan are close allies in the fight against Islamist militants, while Myanmar is an emerging ally to offset China's influence in Southeast Asia.

Documents reviewed by Reuters also show Tillerson's decision was at odds with a unanimous recommendation by the heads of the State Department's regional bureaus overseeing embassies in the Middle East and Asia, the U.S. envoy on Afghanistan and Pakistan, the department's human rights office and its own in-house lawyers. [http://tmsnrt.rs/2Ah6tB4 ]

"Beyond contravening U.S. law, this decision risks marring the credibility of a broad range of State Department reports and analyses and has weakened one of the U.S. government's primary diplomatic tools to deter governmental armed forces and government-supported armed groups from recruiting and using children in combat and support roles around the world," said the July 28 memo.

Reuters reported in June that Tillerson had disregarded internal recommendations on Iraq, Myanmar and Afghanistan. The new documents reveal the scale of the opposition in the State Department, including the rare use of what is known as the "dissent channel," which allows officials to object to policies without fear of reprisals.[nL1N1JK1X9]

The views expressed by the U.S. officials illustrate ongoing tensions between career diplomats and the former chief of Exxon Mobil Corp appointed by President Donald Trump to pursue an "America First" approach to diplomacy.

INTERPRETING THE LAW

The child soldiers law passed in 2008 states that the U.S. government must be satisfied that no children under the age of 18 "are recruited, conscripted or otherwise compelled to serve as child soldiers" for a country to be removed from the list. The statute extends specifically to government militaries and government-supported armed groups like militias.

The list currently includes the Democratic Republic of Congo, Nigeria, Somalia, South Sudan, Mali, Sudan, Syria and Yemen.

"The Secretary thoroughly reviewed all of the information presented to him and made a determination about whether the facts presented justified a listing pursuant to the law," a State Department spokesperson said when asked about the officials' allegation that he had violated the law.

In a written response to the dissent memo on Sept. 1, Tillerson adviser Brian Hook acknowledged that the three countries did use child soldiers. He said, however, it was necessary to distinguish between governments "making little or no effort to correct their child soldier violations ... and those which are making sincere - if as yet incomplete - efforts."

Hook made clear that America's top diplomat used what he sees as his discretion to interpret the law.

'A POWERFUL MESSAGE'

Foreign militaries on the list are prohibited from receiving aid, training and weapons from Washington unless the White House issues a waiver based on U.S. "national interest." In 2016, under the Obama administration, both Iraq and Myanmar, as well as others such as Nigeria and Somalia, received waivers.

At times, the human rights community chided President Barack Obama for being too willing to issue waivers and exemptions, especially for governments that had security ties with Washington, instead of sanctioning more of those countries. "Human Rights Watch frequently criticized President Barack Obama for giving too many countries waivers, but the law has made a real difference," Jo Becker, advocacy director for the group's children's rights division, wrote in June in a critique of Tillerson's decision.

The dissenting U.S. officials stressed that Tillerson's decision to exclude Iraq, Afghanistan and Myanmar went a step further than the Obama administration's waiver policy by contravening the law and effectively easing pressure on the countries to eradicate the use of child soldiers.

The officials acknowledged in the documents reviewed by Reuters that those three countries had made progress. But in their reading of the law, they said that was not enough to be kept off a list that has been used to shame governments into completely eradicating the use of child soldiers.

'UNCONSCIONABLE ACTIONS'

Ben Cardin, ranking Democrat on the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, wrote to Tillerson on Friday saying there were "serious concerns that the State Department may not be complying" with the law and that the secretary's decision "sent a powerful message to these countries that they were receiving a pass on their unconscionable actions."

Rachel Stohl, a senior associate at the Stimson Center think tank in Washington who focuses on children in armed conflict, said that by excluding the three countries from the list, "the Trump administration has further enabled perpetual human rights abusers."

The memo was among a series of previously unreported documents sent this month to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the State Department's independent inspector general's office that relate to allegations that Tillerson violated the child soldiers law.

Legal scholars say that because of the executive branch's latitude in foreign policy there is little legal recourse to counter Tillerson's decision.

Herman Schwartz, a constitutional law professor at American University in Washington, said U.S. courts would be unlikely to accept any challenge to Tillerson's interpretation of the child soldiers law as allowing him to remove a country from the list on his own discretion.

The signatories to the document were largely senior policy experts with years of involvement in the issues, said an official familiar with the matter. Reuters saw a copy of the document that did not include the names of those who signed it.

Tillerson's decision to remove Iraq and Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, from the list and reject a recommendation by U.S. officials to add Afghanistan was announced in the release of the government's annual human trafficking report on June 27.

Six days earlier, a previously unreported memo emailed to Tillerson from a range of senior diplomats said the three countries violated the law based on evidence gathered by U.S. officials in 2016 and recommended that he approve them for the new list.

It noted that in Iraq, the United Nations and non-governmental organizations "reported that some Sunni tribal forces ... recruited and used persons younger than the age of 18, including instances of children taking a direct part in hostilities."

Ali Kareem, who heads Iraq's High Committee for Human Rights, denied the country's military or state-backed militias use child soldiers. "We can say today with full confidence that we have a clean slate on child recruitment issues," he said.

The memo also said "two confirmed cases of child recruitment" by the Myanmar military "were documented during the reporting period." Human rights advocates have estimated that dozens of children are still conscripted there.

Myanmar government spokesman Zaw Htay challenged accusers to provide details of where and how child soldiers are being used. He noted that in the latest State Department report on human trafficking, "they already recognized (Myanmar) for reducing of child soldiers" – though the report also made clear some children were still conscripted.

The memo said further there was "credible evidence" that a government-supported militia in Afghanistan "recruited and used a child," meeting the minimum threshold of a single confirmed case that the State Department had previously used as the legal basis for putting a country on the list.

The Afghan defense and interior ministries both denied there were any child soldiers in Afghan national security forces, an assertion that contradicts the State Department's reports and human rights activists.

Iraq crude exports to U.S. through October top all of 2016 - Reuters News

{{20171121T170218.011+0000}}Iraq crude exports to U.S. through October top all of 2016By Bryan Sims

HOUSTON, Nov 21 (Reuters) - Iraq's crude exports to the United States this year are on pace to reach a nine-year high with shipments through October topping 2016's total, according to Thomson Reuters trade flows data.

The gains point to Iraq's willingness to fill U.S. supply gaps created by declines among other members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. The last time Iraq's exports to the United States topped 200 million barrels was in 2008, when they reached 202 million barrels.

Iraq sent a total of 170.4 million barrels of Basra crude oil to the United States through October, up 19 percent compared with the 142.7 million barrels sent in all of 2016, according to Thomson Reuters data.

Total shipments of Iraqi crude to the United States through October increased by 201,000 barrels per day, according to the Thomson Reuters data. In contrast, Saudi Arabia's share of U.S. crude imports in the summer fell to 11 percent of overall U.S. imports, the lowest percentage of U.S. imports since 1985. [nL1N1NJ0TF]

OPEC member Venezuela's total shipments to the United States fell by 89,100 bpd during the same period. [nL8N1NQ1YP]

Imports of Iraqi oil by U.S. Gulf Coast buyers, which tend to prefer heavy crudes, through October totaled 132.5 million barrels, up 22 percent compared with the 108.7 million barrels to the region in 2016.

Basra Light crude grades accounted for the lion's share of 2017 shipments to the United States to date, with 91.7 million barrels. Basra Heavy grades comprised 71.7 million barrels and Basra Blend grades consisted of 6.8 million barrels.

The largest recipients of Iraqi crude this year have been refiners Marathon Petroleum Corp with 31.2 million barrels, followed by Exxon Mobil Corp with 24.7 million barrels. Other top buyers include Valero Energy Corp at 24 million barrels and PBF Energy Inc with 13.9 million barrels.

Saudi Arabia cut shipments to the United States in June, as part of an effort by OPEC to reduce inventories among Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries to their five-year average. OPEC and non-member nations including Russia agreed in late 2016 to cut world output by 1.8 million barrels a day.

Representatives of OPEC countries are set to meet on Nov. 30 in Vienna to consider extending cuts.

EXCLUSIVO-Secretário de Estado é acusado de violar lei dos EUA contra soldados crianças - Reuters (Portuguese, Brazil)

{{20171121T142344.387+0000}}EXCLUSIVO-Secretário de Estado é acusado de violar lei dos EUA contra soldados criançasPor Jason Szep e Matt Spetalnick

WASHINGTON, 21 Nov (Reuters) - Um grupo de cerca de uma dúzia de funcionários do Departamento de Estado dos Estados Unidos adotou a medida incomum de acusar formalmente o secretário de Estado norte-americano, Rex Tillerson, de violar uma lei federal concebida para impedir que militares estrangeiros alistem soldados crianças, de acordo com documentos internos do governo vistos pela Reuters.

Um memorando confidencial de "dissidência" do Departamento de Estado não relatado anteriormente afirma que Tillerson violou a Lei de Prevenção contra Soldados Crianças ao decidir excluir Iraque, Mianmar e Afeganistão de uma lista norte-americana de infratores que utilizam crianças-soldados em junho -- apesar de o departamento ter reconhecido publicamente que crianças estavam sendo alistadas nestes países.

Manter estes países fora da lista anual torna mais fácil para os EUA lhes fornecer assistência militar. Iraque e Afeganistão são aliados próximos na luta contra militantes islâmicos, e Mianmar é um parceiro emergente na contraposição à influência da China no sudeste asiático.

Documentos analisados pela Reuters também mostram que a decisão de Tillerson se chocou com uma recomendação unânime de diretores de escritórios regionais do Departamento de Estado que supervisionam embaixadas no Oriente Médio e na Ásia, do enviado norte-americano ao Afeganistão e ao Paquistão, do escritório de direitos humanos do departamento e dos próprios advogados da pasta.

"Além de infringir a lei norte-americana, este decisão cria o risco de manchar a credibilidade de uma vasta gama de relatórios e análises do Departamento de Estado e enfraqueceu uma das principais ferramentas diplomáticas do governo dos EUA para impedir que forças armadas governamentais e grupos armados apoiados por governos recrutem e usem crianças em combate e funções de apoio em todo o mundo", diz o memorando de 28 de julho.

Em junho a Reuters noticiou que Tillerson desconsiderou recomendações internas sobre Iraque, Mianmar e Afeganistão. Os novos documentos revelam a dimensão da oposição dentro do departamento, incluindo o uso raro do que é conhecido como o "canal de dissidência", que permite que funcionários objetem a políticas sem medo de represálias.

A lei contra soldados crianças aprovada em 2008 determina que o governo dos EUA precisa estar convencido de que crianças e adolescentes com menos de 18 anos de idade não sejam "recrutadas, alistadas ou de qualquer maneira compelidas a servir como soldados crianças" para que um país seja retirado da lista, que atualmente inclui República Democrática do Congo, Nigéria, Somália, Sudão do Sul, Mali, Sudão, Síria e Iêmen.

Em uma resposta por escrito de 1º de setembro ao memorando, Brian Hook, assessor de Tillerson, reconheceu que os três países usam crianças-soldados, mas disse ser necessário distinguir entre governos "que fazem pouco ou nenhum esforço para corrigir suas violações de soldados crianças... e aqueles que estão fazendo esforços sinceros -- mesmo que ainda incompletos".

EXKLUSIV-US-Außenamtsmitarbeiter werfen Tillerson Rechtsbruch vor  - Reuters (German)

{{20171121T131317.249+0000}}EXKLUSIV-US-Außenamtsmitarbeiter werfen Tillerson Rechtsbruch vor - von Jason Szep und Matt Spetalnick

Washington, 21. Nov (Reuters) - US-Außenminister Rex Tillerson wird von den eigenen Beamten Rechtsbruch vorgeworfen. Er soll gegen ein US-Gesetz verstoßen haben, das die Rekrutierung von Kindersoldaten verhindern soll. Laut einem der Nachrichtenagentur Reuters am Dienstag vorliegenden Dokument beschuldigen rund ein Dutzend Beamte des Außenministeriums Tillerson, im Juni den Irak, Afghanistan und Myanmar von der Liste der Staaten gestrichen zu haben, denen der Einsatz von Kindersoldaten vorgeworfen wird - obwohl das US-Außenministerium dort die Rekrutierung von Kindern öffentlich kritisiert hatte. Die Streichung aus der jährlich aktualisierten Liste erleichtert US-Militärhilfe an die Staaten. [Link zur Beschwerde http://tmsnrt.rs/2jJ7pav ] [Memo zu Staaten mit Kindersoldaten http://tmsnrt.rs/2Ah6tB4 ]

Reuters hatte im Juni über die Entscheidung des Ministers berichtet. Das jetzt bekanntgewordene Dokument zeigt den ungewöhnlich heftigen Widerstand dagegen in Tillersons eigenem Haus. Für die Beschwerde nutzten die rund ein Dutzend Personen einen selten verwendeten, speziellen Kommunikationskanal, über den Mitarbeiter ihre Ablehnung politischer Entscheidungen äußern können, ohne Vergeltungsmaßnahmen fürchten zu müssen.

Das Gesetz von 2008 schreibt der US-Regierung vor, dass nur solche Länder von der Liste gestrichen werden dürfen, in denen keine Personen unter 18 Jahren rekrutiert, eingezogen oder in anderer Weise zum Einsatz als Kindersoldaten gezwungen würden.

Ein Berater Tillersons hatte als Antwort auf die Kritik im September eingeräumt, dass in den drei Staaten Kinder als Soldaten eingesetzt würden. Man müsse aber zwischen Staaten unterscheiden, die an dieser Praxis nichts änderten und jenen, die aufrichtige, wenngleich noch unvollständige Bemühungen unternähmen. Tillerson habe hier seinen Ermessenspielraum zur Interpretation des Gesetzes genutzt.

US-PRÄSIDENT NUTZTE BISLANG AUSNAHMEREGELUNGEN

Die US-Regierung darf die Armeen von Staaten auf der Liste nicht unterstützen, es sei denn, das Präsidialamt erlässt eine Ausnahmeregelung im "nationalen Interesse". Unter Präsident Barack Obama wurde diese Ausnahme 2016 unter anderem für Irak, Myanmar, Nigeria und Somalia gewährt. Menschenrechtsorganisationen warfen Obama damals vor, er habe diese Ausnahmen zu leichtfertig erlassen.

Die Kritiker im Außenministerium beklagten, dass die Streichung der drei Staaten von der Liste über die Praxis der Ausnahmegenehmigungen hinausgehe. Dies laufe dem Gesetz zuwider und verringere den Druck auf die Staaten, den Einsatz von Kindersoldaten zu beenden. Sie räumten ein, dass es in den drei Staaten Verbesserungen gebe. Diese reichten aber nicht aus, sie von der Liste zu streichen.

US-Juristen gehen davon aus, dass rechtliche Schritte gegen die Entscheidung des Ministers nicht erfolgreich sein würden, weil die Regierung in der Außenpolitik einen großen Ermessenspielraum habe. Der Verfassungsrechtler Herman Schwartz von der American University in Washington sagte, Gerichte würden Klagen gegen Tillersons Interpretation des Gesetztes kaum zulassen.

The new documents reveal the scale of the opposition in the State Department, including the rare use of what is known as the "dissent channel," which allows officials to object to policies without fear of reprisals.[nL1N1JK1X9]

The views expressed by the U.S. officials illustrate ongoing tensions between career diplomats and the former chief of Exxon Mobil Corp appointed by President Donald Trump to pursue an "America First" approach to diplomacy.

INTERPRETING THE LAW

The child soldiers law passed in 2008 states that the U.S. government must be satisfied that no children under the age of 18 "are recruited, conscripted or otherwise compelled to serve as child soldiers" for a country to be removed from the list. It currently includes the Democratic Republic of Congo, Nigeria, Somalia, South Sudan, Mali, Sudan, Syria and Yemen.

"The Secretary thoroughly reviewed all of the information presented to him and made a determination about whether the facts presented justified a listing pursuant to the law," a State Department spokesperson said when asked about the officials' allegation that he had violated the law.

In a written response to the dissent memo on Sept. 1, Tillerson adviser Brian Hook acknowledged that the three countries did use child soldiers. He said, however, it was necessary to distinguish between governments "making little or no effort to correct their child soldier violations ... and those which are making sincere - if as yet incomplete - efforts."

Hook made clear that America's top diplomat used what he sees as his discretion to interpret the law.

'A POWERFUL MESSAGE'

Foreign militaries on the list are prohibited from receiving aid, training and weapons from Washington unless the White House issues a waiver based on U.S. "national interest." In 2016, under the Obama administration, both Iraq and Myanmar, as well as others such as Nigeria and Somalia, received waivers.

At times, the human rights community chided President Barack Obama for being too willing to issue waivers and exemptions, especially for governments that had security ties with Washington, instead of sanctioning more of those countries. "Human Rights Watch frequently criticized President Barack Obama for giving too many countries waivers, but the law has made a real difference," Jo Becker, advocacy director for the children's rights division of Human Rights Watch, wrote in June in a critique of Tillerson's decision.

The dissenting U.S. officials stressed that Tillerson's decision to exclude Iraq, Afghanistan and Myanmar went a step further than the Obama administration's waiver policy by contravening the law and effectively easing pressure on the countries to eradicate the use of child soldiers.

The officials acknowledged in the documents reviewed by Reuters that those three countries had made progress. But in their reading of the law, they said that was not enough to be kept off a list that has been used to shame governments into completely eradicating the use of child soldiers.

'UNCONSCIONABLE ACTIONS'

Ben Cardin, ranking Democrat on the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, wrote to Tillerson on Friday saying there were "serious concerns that the State Department may not be complying" with the law and that the secretary's decision "sent a powerful message to these countries that they were receiving a pass on their unconscionable actions."

The memo was among a series of previously unreported documents sent this month to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the State Department's independent inspector general's office that relate to allegations that Tillerson violated the child soldiers law.

Legal scholars say that because of the executive branch's latitude in foreign policy there is little legal recourse to counter Tillerson's decision.

Herman Schwartz, a constitutional law professor at American University in Washington, said U.S. courts would be unlikely to accept any challenge to Tillerson's interpretation of the child soldiers law as allowing him to remove a country from the list on his own discretion.

The signatories to the document were largely senior policy experts with years of involvement in the issues, said an official familiar with the matter. Reuters saw a copy of the document that did not include the names of those who signed it.

Tillerson's decision to remove Iraq and Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, from the list and reject a recommendation by U.S. officials to add Afghanistan was announced in the release of the government's annual human trafficking report on June 27.

Six days earlier, a previously unreported memo emailed to Tillerson from a range of senior diplomats said the three countries violated the law based on evidence gathered by U.S. officials in 2016 and recommended that he approve them for the new list.

It noted that in Iraq, the United Nations and non-governmental organizations "reported that some Sunni tribal forces ... recruited and used persons younger than the age of 18, including instances of children taking a direct part in hostilities."

Ali Kareem, who heads Iraq's High Committee for Human Rights, denied the country's military or state-backed militias use child soldiers. "We can say today with full confidence that we have a clean slate on child recruitment issues," he said.

The memo also said "two confirmed cases of child recruitment" by the Myanmar military "were documented during the reporting period." Human rights advocates have estimated that dozens of children are still conscripted there.

Myanmar government spokesman Zaw Htay challenged accusers to provide details of where and how child soldiers are being used. He noted that in the latest State Department report on human trafficking, "they already recognized (Myanmar) for reducing of child soldiers" – though the report also made clear some children were still conscripted.

The memo said further there was "credible evidence" that a government-supported militia in Afghanistan "recruited and used a child," meeting the minimum threshold of a single confirmed case that the State Department had previously used as the legal basis for putting a country on the list.

The Afghan defense and interior ministries both denied there were any child soldiers in Afghan national security forces, an assertion that contradicts the State Department's reports and human rights activists.

{{20171120T174635.136+0000}}UPDATE 1-Exxon Baton Rouge refinery restarts large crude unit -sources(Adds company no comment)

HOUSTON, Nov 20 (Reuters) - ExxonMobil Corp restarted the large crude distillation unit (CDU) at its 502,500-barrel-per-day (bpd) Baton Rouge, Louisiana, refinery on Monday, said sources familiar with plant operations.

Exxon spokeswoman Stephanie Cargile declined to comment.

The 210,000-bpd CDU was taken out of production after a fire heavily damaged a reformer on Nov. 1, the sources said.

It is the largest of four CDUS at the Baton Rouge refinery, doing the primary refining of crude oil and providing hydrocarbon feedstock to all other units.

ANALYSIS-Oil giants unlikely to share coal's fate, for now - Reuters News

{{20171120T060002.271+0000}}ANALYSIS-Oil giants unlikely to share coal's fate, for now(Repeats story from Friday)

* Norwegian wealth funds mulls dropping oil and gas holdings

* But demand for oil and gas to last for decades

* Size of oil majors means hard to find alternative investments

By Ron Bousso, Simon Jessop and Susanna Twidale

LONDON, Nov 17 (Reuters) - The Norwegian sovereign wealth fund's proposal to ditch its oil and gas shares, though hugely symbolic in the battle against climate change, is unlikely to cause a rush to the exit by major investors in the sector in the short term. [nL8N1NM4UW]

The move by the $1 trillion fund, the world's largest, rattled stock markets, exposing what is seen as one of the biggest threats to companies such as Royal Dutch Shell, Exxon Mobil and BP as the world shifts towards renewable energy such as wind and solar.

But in the meantime, expectations of growing global demand for oil and gas for decades to come mean reliance on these companies is likely to continue.

And although the Norwegian initiative will encourage those seeking to hasten the move to a low-carbon economy, the degree to which other investors can follow the fund's example, at least in the short term, is less clear.

The European oil and gas index <.SXEP> fell on Friday to its lowest since late September, extending declines following the Norwegian fund's announcement.

For some, it was seen as an opening shot in the decline of the 150-year-old sector in the battle to slow global warming and reduce carbon emissions, reminiscent of the demise of coal.

"The investor exit from oil and gas as a fuel source will be slower than coal, but the emissions reduction maths is clear and so this inevitable transition has started," said Nathan Fabian, director of policy at Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI), a United Nations-backed group that represents asset managers with holdings of over $60 trillion.

But other investors do not draw the same parallels.

"I do not see this as the start of a broader trend among major investors," said Rohan Murphy, energy analyst at Allianz, which holds shares in several oil majors.

"Coal is a more obvious SRI (sustainable responsible investment) sell compared to oil and gas – coal is dirtier."

"Gas, which is a big part of all the big oil businesses today, is the answer for the medium-term energy transition to gas from coal for power generation," Murphy said.

Petroleum companies see natural gas as a cleaner alternative to coal for power generation in the effort to wean the world off fossil fuels by the end of the century.

"Many wish for a quick and revolutionary role reversal between the oil and gas industry, and the renewable and new electric industry. But undue haste and an overly ideological approach could bring great economic and social damage," Total CEO Patrick Pouyanne said in a speech last month.

Also, demand for oil in transportation and plastics is not expected to decline significantly until 2050, according to many forecasts. [nL1N1ND281]

The Norwegian announcement came as more than 195 nations met in Bonn, Germany, to decide how to comply with climate targets agreed in Paris in 2015 to limit a rise in global temperatures.[nL8N1NL6I4]

SCALE

But beyond our dependence on oil and gas, the size of the world's top oil companies would make mass divestment a huge challenge. The top five publicly traded companies - Exxon, Chevron, Shell, BP and Total - together have a market value of over $1 trillion.

Coal companies, on the other hand, have always been smaller.

For now, there is no viable alternative to oil and gas to meet the world's demand, several investors said.

"My guess is that after the initial market adjustment ... the move may not damage the sector's long-term performance significantly," said Kevin Gardiner, global investment strategist at Rothschild Wealth Management.

The Norwegian wealth fund's move, echoing Saudi Arabia's plan to list part of its national oil company, was aimed at making Norway less exposed to volatile oil prices and less reliant on revenue from fossil fuels.

If approved, it would most likely take years for the Norwegian fund to unwind its large investments in the sector and find new homes for the money.

And while there is also growing demand from retail investors to invest in 'responsible' or 'sustainable' funds, oil and gas companies are not commonly excluded and any change here would be gradual.

Dropping oil and gas companies would also mean missing out on a rich source of dividend income, a prized asset at a time of low bond yields.

Three – Shell, Exxon and Gazprom - were among the top-10 dividend payers globally in the third quarter.

In absolute terms, the number of oil and gas companies in leading stock indices varies, with 14 in the STOXX 600 index of leading European companies, or 2.3 percent; and 26 in the S&P 500 <.SPX>, or 5.2 percent.

The size of some of the largest can have a disproportionate impact on returns relative to their index peers. While there are just two companies in Britain's blue-chip FTSE 100 index, for example, they make up 14 percent of the index's value.

While the Norwegian fund has long been a trend-setter for issues around socially responsible investing, particularly in Scandinavia, the reason for this decision is relatively unique.

Its desire to make treasury receipts less dependent on the oil price is not a challenge faced by most pension funds, which make up a large slice of the money invested globally.

Any decision to ditch oil and gas would arguably leave them less diversified, not more, said investors, although charitable endowments may have more flexibility to do so.

Bid for Santos puts spotlight on Papua New Guinea's juicy LNG assets - Reuters News

{{20171117T054753.027+0000}}Bid for Santos puts spotlight on Papua New Guinea's juicy LNG assets* Harbour Energy may bid $8 billion for Australia's Santos

* Santos holds a stake in lucrative Papua New Guinea LNG

* ExxonMobil's PNG LNG running at 25 pct above capacity

* Exxon, Total and partners plan to double PNG LNG output

By Sonali Paul and Henning Gloystein

MELBOURNE/SINGAPORE, Nov 17 (Reuters) - Takeover interest in Australia's Santos , a company that not long ago was drowning in debt, shines a spotlight on a burgeoning hotspot for oil and gas producers: Papua New Guinea.

The South Pacific nation, one of the world's least explored countries but known for corruption and violence, has become a key source of growth for two of the world's biggest energy companies - ExxonMobil Corp and Total SA - looking to expand their liquefied natural gas (LNG) businesses.

With oil and gas prices recovering this year and LNG demand especially in China skyrocketing, investors are scouring the globe for juicy investments, and Papua New Guinea has landed on their radar. [nL4N1N91MY]

Now private equity wants to get in on the game, with U.S.-based Harbour Energy eyeing a bid for Santos Ltd , Australia's no.2 independent gas producer, which has a 13.5 percent stake in ExxonMobil's Papua New Guinea LNG project (PNG LNG). [nL3N1NL5QO]

"As an acquisition, the prize jewels in Santos are its stakes in PNG LNG," said Saul Kavonic of energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie.

Investors are attracted by Papua New Guinea's high-yielding gas fields, with the gas rich in liquids that generate extra revenue, and easily exported to North Asia's booming markets as LNG on tankers.

Costs are low, a key to grabbing the next leg of growth in the LNG market, as plants in Australia and the United States flood the market with new supply.

Santos is not the only company to have caught the attention of investors because of its Papua New Guinea assets.

Oil Search limited, ExxonMobil's partner in PNG, fended off an $8 billion approach from Australia's biggest energy company, Woodside Petroleum , two years ago, around the same time Santos rebuffed a bid from a fund backed by the royal families of Brunei and the United Arab Emirates.

ExxonMobil sealed its dominance in the country by taking over InterOil, another PNG player, for $2 billion earlier this year after trumping a bid from Total and Oil Search.

Regrouping after Santos spurned an A$9.5 billion ($7.2 billion) approach, Harbour Energy may have to pay more than A$11 billion to snare its target in what would be one of the biggest oil and gas deals since Royal Dutch Shell took over BG Group to become the world's biggest listed LNG producer.

Santos was in deep trouble just a few years ago, struggling with high debt and low oil and gas prices. But asset sales, debt reduction and cost-cutting have led it back to health.

Some analysts now say a bid even at A$11 billion would be too low, in part due to its production costs, to which Papua New Guinea contributes.

"The company has been a turnaround story. By selling down poorly performing assets and driving efficiencies, management has brought down breakeven production costs an incredible 32 percent to $32 per barrel," said Cai Lewis, senior adviser at ASR Wealth Advisers.

Current Brent crude oil prices are above $60 per barrel.

Based on that, Lewis said an A$11 billion offer would be "too cheap".

UNUSUAL PROJECT

Papua New Guinea is an unusual investment destination. The country to the north of Australia is one of Asia's poorest, remote, troubled by corruption and sporadic violence.

"The rate of crime in Papua New Guinea is among the highest in the world," the U.S. State Department said in its 2017 crime and safety report, warning of "violent crime, including gang rape, carjacking, home invasions, kidnappings, and armed robberies."

Also, much of the country is jungle-covered mountain, making access difficult.

Yet all this has not scared off investment into its gas resources.

Exxon was the first to make a foray, committing in 2009 to develop a $19 billion LNG export facility.

The project's remoteness required Exxon to charter huge Russian transport planes to fly in equipment, including gas turbines, to jungle airstrips.

Despite the challenges, ExxonMobil stunned markets by completing the project in 2014 ahead of schedule, and ramping up output at the plant, designed to produce 6.9 million tonnes a year, as high as 25 percent above nameplate capacity.

Enjoying low production costs and LNG prices that have jumped by 70 percent this year to almost $10 per million British thermal units, ExxonMobil plans to double output from PNG LNG by the mid-2020s by using gas from fields that it owns with partners Total, Oil Search and Santos.

They all agree it would be smarter and cheaper to expand PNG LNG than build a competing LNG plant.

"We have got to be the most cost-competitive out there... in order to attract that demand growth," ExxonMobil's head of investor relations, Jeff Woodbury, said in September.

PNG LNG stands in stark contrast to Australia's more expensive mega-projects, which have started up over the past two years after blowing budgets and schedules, and in some cases struggling to produce at capacity.

Santos's $18.5 billion Gladstone LNG project on Australia's east coast opened in 2015 at 15 percent over budget and does not have enough gas to fill the plant, now slated to reach only 75 percent capacity by 2019.

By Sonali Paul and Henning Gloystein

MELBOURNE/SINGAPORE, Nov 17 (Reuters) - Takeover interest in Australia's Santos , a company that not long ago was drowning in debt, shines a spotlight on a burgeoning hotspot for oil and gas producers: Papua New Guinea.

The South Pacific nation, one of the world's least explored countries but known for corruption and violence, has become a key source of growth for two of the world's biggest energy companies - ExxonMobil Corp and Total SA - looking to expand their liquefied natural gas (LNG) businesses.

With oil and gas prices recovering this year and LNG demand especially in China skyrocketing, investors are scouring the globe for juicy investments, and Papua New Guinea has landed on their radar. [nL4N1N91MY]

Now private equity wants to get in on the game, with U.S.-based Harbour Energy eyeing a bid for Santos Ltd , Australia's no.2 independent gas producer, which has a 13.5 percent stake in ExxonMobil's Papua New Guinea LNG project (PNG LNG). [nL3N1NL5QO]

"As an acquisition, the prize jewels in Santos are its stakes in PNG LNG," said Saul Kavonic of energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie.

Investors are attracted by Papua New Guinea's high-yielding gas fields, with the gas rich in liquids that generate extra revenue, and easily exported to North Asia's booming markets as LNG on tankers.

Costs are low, a key to grabbing the next leg of growth in the LNG market, as plants in Australia and the United States flood the market with new supply.

Santos is not the only company to have caught the attention of investors because of its Papua New Guinea assets.

Oil Search limited, ExxonMobil's partner in PNG, fended off an $8 billion approach from Australia's biggest energy company, Woodside Petroleum , two years ago, around the same time Santos rebuffed a bid from a fund backed by the royal families of Brunei and the United Arab Emirates.

ExxonMobil sealed its dominance in the country by taking over InterOil, another PNG player, for $2 billion earlier this year after trumping a bid from Total and Oil Search.

Regrouping after Santos spurned an A$9.5 billion ($7.2 billion) approach, Harbour Energy may have to pay more than A$11 billion to snare its target in what would be one of the biggest oil and gas deals since Royal Dutch Shell took over BG Group to become the world's biggest listed LNG producer.

Santos was in deep trouble just a few years ago, struggling with high debt and low oil and gas prices. But asset sales, debt reduction and cost-cutting have led it back to health.

Some analysts now say a bid even at A$11 billion would be too low, in part due to its production costs, to which Papua New Guinea contributes.

"The company has been a turnaround story. By selling down poorly performing assets and driving efficiencies, management has brought down breakeven production costs an incredible 32 percent to $32 per barrel," said Cai Lewis, senior adviser at ASR Wealth Advisers.

Current Brent crude oil prices are above $60 per barrel.

Based on that, Lewis said an A$11 billion offer would be "too cheap".

UNUSUAL PROJECT

Papua New Guinea is an unusual investment destination. The country to the north of Australia is one of Asia's poorest, remote, troubled by corruption and sporadic violence.

"The rate of crime in Papua New Guinea is among the highest in the world," the U.S. State Department said in its 2017 crime and safety report, warning of "violent crime, including gang rape, carjacking, home invasions, kidnappings, and armed robberies."

Also, much of the country is jungle-covered mountain, making access difficult.

Yet all this has not scared off investment into its gas resources.

Exxon was the first to make a foray, committing in 2009 to develop a $19 billion LNG export facility.

The project's remoteness required Exxon to charter huge Russian transport planes to fly in equipment, including gas turbines, to jungle airstrips.

Despite the challenges, ExxonMobil stunned markets by completing the project in 2014 ahead of schedule, and ramping up output at the plant, designed to produce 6.9 million tonnes a year, as high as 25 percent above nameplate capacity.

Enjoying low production costs and LNG prices that have jumped by 70 percent this year to almost $10 per million British thermal units, ExxonMobil plans to double output from PNG LNG by the mid-2020s by using gas from fields that it owns with partners Total, Oil Search and Santos.

They all agree it would be smarter and cheaper to expand PNG LNG than build a competing LNG plant.

"We have got to be the most cost-competitive out there... in order to attract that demand growth," ExxonMobil's head of investor relations, Jeff Woodbury, said in September.

PNG LNG stands in stark contrast to Australia's more expensive mega-projects, which have started up over the past two years after blowing budgets and schedules, and in some cases struggling to produce at capacity.

Santos's $18.5 billion Gladstone LNG project on Australia's east coast opened in 2015 at 15 percent over budget and does not have enough gas to fill the plant, now slated to reach only 75 percent capacity by 2019.

($1 = 1.3184 Australian dollars)

* Says working to restore normal operations as quickly as possible

* Facility produces up to 14 mln litres of refined products a day

(Adds detail, comment from fire brigade)

SYDNEY, Nov 17 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil said on Friday that there was no danger to the community or environment after heavy gas flaring at an oil refinery near Melbourne in Australia following an interruption to power.

The oil giant said in a statement emailed to Reuters that it was working to restore its Altona refinery to normal operations as quickly as possible.

A spokeswoman for the Metropolitan Fire Brigade said the refinery was flaring because of a power outage in the area, adding that this was normal practice.

Fire crews were called to the refinery but left after determining there was no danger, she said.

The refinery churns out up to 14 million litres of refined products per day, with petrol making up about 60 percent of production, diesel 30 percent and jet fuel around 10 percent, according to the company's website.

By Gwladys Fouche

OSLO, Nov 16 (Reuters) - Norway's trillion-dollar sovereign wealth fund is proposing to drop oil and gas companies from its benchmark index, which would mean cutting its investments in those companies, the deputy central bank chief supervising the fund told Reuters, sending energy stocks lower.

If adopted by parliament, the fund would over time divest billions of dollars from oil and gas stocks, which now represent 6 percent - or around $37 billion - of the fund's benchmark equity index.

The aim is to make the Norwegian government's wealth less vulnerable to a permanent drop in oil prices, at a time when the fund is increasing its exposure to equities to 70 percent of the fund's value from 60 percent earlier.

Europe's index of oil and gas shares <.SXEP> hit its lowest level since mid-October on the news and was trading down 0.39 percent at 16.41 GMT [nL8N1NM4HN].

The proposal came in a letter sent by the central bank to the finance ministry and signed by its governor, Oeystein Olsen, and the chief executive of the fund, Yngve Slyngstad, Deputy Central Bank Governor Egil Matsen said in an interview.

"Our advice is to simply remove the oil and gas sector, as it is defined in the FTSE reference index, from the fund's reference index," Matsen said.

"That would mean all companies that the FTSE has classified with the sector, should be removed from our reference index."

The fund is the world's largest sovereign wealth fund. It invests Norway's revenues from oil and gas production for future generations in stocks, bonds and real estate abroad.

It is among the largest investors in a wide range of oil companies, holding stakes at the end of 2016 of 2.3 percent in Royal Dutch Shell , 1.7 percent of BP , 0.9 percent of Chevron and 0.8 percent of Exxon Mobil .

"The risk for the oil sector is how many investment funds will downsize their exposure to extractive industries," said Jason Kenney, oil analyst at bank Santander.

The fund also held 1.7 percent of Italy's Eni , 1.6 percent of France's Total and 0.9 percent of Sweden's Lundin Petroleum , among others.

At the end of the third quarter, Royal Dutch Shell was the fund's third-biggest equity investment overall, worth around $5.34 billion and exceeded only by its ownership in Apple and Nestle .

"This news will be scrutinised very closely by funds around the world who are already looking closely at the climate risks in their portfolios and which sectors and companies will fare best in the low-carbon transition," said Stephanie Pfeifer, head of the Institutional Investors Group of Climate Change, which groups 140 investors that work on global warming and represent assets of more than 20 trillion euros.

"Investors will look even more carefully at which companies are aligning their business strategies to the transition to a low-carbon energy system and which ones are not. Investors then have a range of options for managing the risks they perceive," she told Reuters.

Others were less sanguine.

"My guess is that after the initial market adjustment – which would have been difficult to anticipate – the move may not damage the sector's long-term performance significantly," Kevin Gardiner, global investment strategist at Rothschild Wealth Management, told Reuters.

BP and Shell declined to comment.

PROTECTING NORWAY'S WEALTH

The aim of the proposal is to make Norway's wealth less vulnerable to a permanent drop in oil prices, especially at a time when the fund is increasing the proportion of its portfolio it invests in equities to 70 percent from 60 percent previously.

"That would mean buying more stocks in the oil and gas sector," said Matsen.

The fund has grown so large that even though the Norwegian state is taking less than 3 percent of the fund's value every year for its fiscal budget in recent years, oil spending now accounts for one in five crowns spent by the state.

In addition to its holdings via the fund, Norway has its own exposure to oil and gas through untapped offshore hydrocarbon reserves, as well as its 67 percent stake in the national oil company, Statoil .

"Oil price exposure of the government's wealth position can be reduced by not having the fund invested in oil and gas stocks," said Matsen.

The fund could still invest in the sector if other parts of the fund's mandate are fulfilled by having some investments in some of the companies, he said.

"But clearly the direction is that ... if the ministry and the politicians think it is good advice and they say yes to it, clearly the investments in the oil and gas sector will decrease over time," he added.

Initial reactions from Norwegian politicians were positive, with two key centrist opposition parties backing the proposal [nO9N1N7006]. Green campaigners also welcomed the news.

"Bravo Norway, and let's hope it gets through because the future of fossil fuel investment is looking shaky indeed," said Rachel Kennerley, climate campaigner at Friends of the Earth.

"This is astonishing — as astonishing as the moment when the Rockefellers divested the world's oldest oil fortune," said Bill McKibben, founder of the 350.org campaign group.

"This is the biggest pile of money on the planet, most of it derived from oil — but that hasn't blinded its owners to the realities of the world we now inhabit."

COAL FIRST, OIL AND GAS NEXT

Since 2015, the fund no longer invests in companies that derive more than 30 percent of their revenues or activities from coal - one of an early group of investors to do so, which has made the coal sector less attractive to some investors.

Oil and gas stocks would be replaced by investments in other companies, Matsen said. "The straight answer is that all other sectors would be weighted up in proportion ... (under) our current mandate," he said.

At the end of 2016, the fund's equity investments were split between investments in the financial sector (23.3 percent), industrial companies (14.1 percent), consumer goods (13.7 percent), consumer services (10.3 percent), healthcare (10.2 percent), technology (9,5 percent), oil and gas (6.4 percent), basic materials (5.6 percent), telecoms (3.2 percent) and utilities (3.1 percent).

The proposal has to be reviewed by the Finance Ministry, which in turn needs to decide whether to propose it to parliament. The Finance Ministry said it would conclude with its own view in the autumn of 2018. [nO9N1ML02E]

If it backs the central bank's proposal, Parliament could vote on it in June 2019 at the earliest.

"It's great to have that luxury, isn't it?" Peter Fitzgerald, Aviva Investors head of multi-assets, told Reuters. "You make all your money from one asset class and then you sell your holdings."

Fondo noruego de 1 billón de dólares propone sacar acciones petroleras de su índice - Reuters (Spanish)

{{20171116T160040.767+0000}}Fondo noruego de 1 billón de dólares propone sacar acciones petroleras de su índicePor Gwladys Fouche

OSLO, 16 nov (Reuters) - El fondo soberano de Noruega, que maneja 1 billón de dólares en activos, propuso eliminar a las compañías de petróleo y gas de su índice de referencia, lo que significaría recortar sus inversiones en esas compañías, dijo a Reuters el jefe adjunto del banco central que supervisa el fondo.

Si el parlamento lo aprueba, el fondo se desprenderá de miles de millones de dólares de acciones de empresas de petróleo y gas, que ahora representan el 6 por ciento, o unos 37.000 millones de dólares, del índice de acciones de referencia del fondo. El objetivo es que los fondos del gobierno noruego sean menos vulnerables a una caída de los precios del petróleo.

El índice europeo de acciones de petróleo y gas <.SXEP> caía un 0,27 por ciento por las noticias, a un mínimo desde mediados de octubre.

La propuesta surgió en una carta enviada por el banco central al Ministerio de Finanzas y firmada por su gobernador, Oeystein Olsen, y el presidente ejecutivo del fondo, Yngve Slyngsad, dijo en una entrevista el vicegobernador del banco central, Egil Matsen.

"Nuestro consejo es simplemente eliminar el sector de petróleo y gas, como se define en el índice de referencia FTSE, del índice de referencia del fondo", dijo Matsen. "Eso significaría que todas las compañías que el FTSE ha clasificado con el sector deberían eliminarse del índice de referencia".

El noruego es el fondo soberano más grande del mundo. Invierte para las generaciones futuras los ingresos de la producción de petróleo y gas del país en acciones, bonos e inmuebles en el extranjero.

El fondo es uno de los mayores inversores en una amplia gama de compañías petroleras, con participaciones al cierre de 2016 del 2,3 por ciento en Royal Dutch Shell , del 1,7 por ciento en BP , del 0,9 por ciento de Chevron y de un 0,8 por ciento de Exxon Mobil .

"El riesgo para el sector petrolero es cuántos fondos de inversión reducirán su exposición a las industrias extractivas", dijo Jason Kenney, analista petrolero del banco Santander.

The proposal came in a letter sent by the central bank to the finance ministry and signed by its governor, Oeystein Olsen, and the chief executive of the fund, Yngve Slyngstad, Deputy Central Bank Governor Egil Matsen said in an interview.

"Our advice is to simply remove the oil and gas sector, as it is defined in the FTSE reference index, from the fund's reference index," Matsen said.

"That would mean all companies that the FTSE has classified with the sector, should be removed from our reference index."

The fund is the world's largest sovereign wealth fund. It invests Norway's revenues from oil and gas production for future generations in stocks, bonds and real estate abroad.

It is among the largest investors in a wide range of oil companies, holding stakes at the end of 2016 of 2.3 percent in Royal Dutch Shell , 1.7 percent of BP , 0.9 percent of Chevron and 0.8 percent of Exxon Mobil .

"The risk for the oil sector is how many investment funds will downsize their exposure to extractive industries," said Jason Kenney, oil analyst at bank Santander.

The fund also held 1.7 percent of Italy's Eni , 1.6 percent of France's Total and 0.9 percent of Sweden's Lundin Petroleum , among others.

At the end of the third quarter, Royal Dutch Shell was the fund's third-biggest equity investment overall, worth around $5.34 billion and exceeded only by its ownership in Apple and Nestle .

"This news will be scrutinised very closely by funds around the world who are already looking closely at the climate risks in their portfolios and which sectors and companies will fare best in the low-carbon transition," said Stephanie Pfeifer, head of the Institutional Investors Group of Climate Change, which groups 140 investors that work on global warming and represent assets of more than 20 trillion euros.

"Investors will look even more carefully at which companies are aligning their business strategies to the transition to a low-carbon energy system and which ones are not. Investors then have a range of options for managing the risks they perceive," she told Reuters.

Others were less sanguine.

"My guess is that after the initial market adjustment – which would have been difficult to anticipate – the move may not damage the sector's long-term performance significantly," Kevin Gardiner, global investment strategist at Rothschild Wealth Management, told Reuters.

BP and Shell declined to comment.

PROTECTING NORWAY'S WEALTH

The aim of the proposal is to make Norway's wealth less vulnerable to a permanent drop in oil prices, especially at a time when the fund is increasing the proportion of its portfolio it invests in equities to 70 percent from 60 percent previously.

"That would mean buying more stocks in the oil and gas sector," said Matsen.

The fund has grown so large that even though the Norwegian state is taking less than 3 percent of the fund's value every year for its fiscal budget in recent years, oil spending now accounts for one in five crowns spent by the state.

In addition to its holdings via the fund, Norway has its own exposure to oil and gas through untapped offshore hydrocarbon reserves, as well as its 67 percent stake in the national oil company, Statoil .

"Oil price exposure of the government's wealth position can be reduced by not having the fund invested in oil and gas stocks," said Matsen.

The fund could still invest in the sector if other parts of the fund's mandate are fulfilled by having some investments in some of the companies, he said.

"But clearly the direction is that ... if the ministry and the politicians think it is good advice and they say yes to it, clearly the investments in the oil and gas sector will decrease over time," he added.

Initial reactions from Norwegian politicians were positive, with two key centrist opposition parties backing the proposal [nO9N1N7006]. Green campaigners also welcomed the news.

"Bravo Norway, and let's hope it gets through because the future of fossil fuel investment is looking shaky indeed," said Rachel Kennerley, climate campaigner at Friends of the Earth.

"This is astonishing — as astonishing as the moment when the Rockefellers divested the world's oldest oil fortune," said Bill McKibben, founder of the 350.org campaign group.

"This is the biggest pile of money on the planet, most of it derived from oil — but that hasn't blinded its owners to the realities of the world we now inhabit."

COAL FIRST, OIL AND GAS NEXT

Since 2015, the fund no longer invests in companies that derive more than 30 percent of their revenues or activities from coal - one of an early group of investors to do so, which has made the coal sector less attractive to some investors.

Oil and gas stocks would be replaced by investments in other companies, Matsen said. "The straight answer is that all other sectors would be weighted up in proportion ... (under) our current mandate," he said.

At the end of 2016, the fund's equity investments were split between investments in the financial sector (23.3 percent), industrial companies (14.1 percent), consumer goods (13.7 percent), consumer services (10.3 percent), healthcare (10.2 percent), technology (9,5 percent), oil and gas (6.4 percent), basic materials (5.6 percent), telecoms (3.2 percent) and utilities (3.1 percent).

The proposal has to be reviewed by the Finance Ministry, which in turn needs to decide whether to propose it to parliament. The Finance Ministry said it would conclude with its own view in the autumn of 2018. [nO9N1ML02E]

If it backs the central bank's proposal, Parliament could vote on it in June 2019 at the earliest.

"It's great to have that luxury, isn't it?" Peter Fitzgerald, Aviva Investors head of multi-assets, told Reuters. "You make all your money from one asset class and then you sell your holdings."

Norway's centrist opposition backs wealth fund pull-out proposal from oil stocks - Reuters News

{{20171116T141201.654+0000}}Norway's centrist opposition backs wealth fund pull-out proposal from oil stocksOSLO, Nov 16 (Reuters) - The Norwegian sovereign wealth fund's proposal to remove oil and gas stocks from its benchmark index is a good idea, two centrist opposition parties said on Thursday.

The Christian Democratic Party said in a statement it gave "full support" to the proposal, while the Liberal Party told Reuters it was "good advice".

Liberal spokesman Terje Breivik added that the party had not formally decided its position on the proposal.

The right-wing government rules in a minority and relies on the Liberals and the Christian Democrats to win majorities for its policies. The government will conclude its own view on the proposal in the autumn of 2018.

Norvegia, fondo sovrano propone di togliere da indice settore oil & gas - Reuters (Italian)

{{20171116T133652.936+0000}}Norvegia, fondo sovrano propone di togliere da indice settore oil & gasOSLO, 16 novembre (Reuters) - Il fondo sovrano della Norvegia ha proposto di togliere le compagnie petrolifere e di gas dal suo indice di riferimento, cosa che potrebbe comportare il taglio dei suoi investimenti nelle società del settore. Lo ha detto a Reuters il vicegovernatore della banca centrale che supervisiona il fondo.

Se accettato dal ministero delle finanze e adottato dal parlamento, il fondo dovrebbe disinvestire da società che rappresentano oggi complessivamente il 6%, circa 37 miliardi di dollari, del suo indice.

La proposta è stata inviata dalla banca centrale in una lettera firmata dal governatore Oeystein Olsen e dal Ceo del fondo Yngve Slyngsad, ha spiegato in un'intervista Egil Matsen.

L'obiettivo è ridurre l'esposizione del fondo, e quindi del governo norvegese, alle fluttuazioni di prezzo del petrolio.

"Il nostro parere è semplicemente eliminare il settore petrolio e gas, così com'è definito nell'indice Ftse, dall'indice di riferimento del fondo", ha detto Matsen.

Il fondo sovrano, il più grande del mondo, possedeva a fine 2016 il 2,3% di Royal Dutch Shell , l'1,7% di BP , lo 0,9% di Chevron e lo 0,8% di Exxon Mobil .

Possiede anche l'1,7% di Eni , l'1,6% di Total e lo 0,9% della svedese Lundin Petroleum .

Alla fine del terzo trimestre, Royal Dutch Shell era il suo principale investimento (per un valore di circa 5,34 miliardi di dollari) dopo Apple e Nestle .

By Gwladys Fouche

OSLO, Nov 16 (Reuters) - Norway's trillion-dollar sovereign wealth fund is proposing to drop oil and gas companies from its benchmark index, which would mean cutting its investments in those companies, the deputy central bank chief supervising the fund told Reuters.

If accepted by the finance ministry and adopted by parliament, the fund would over time divest billions of dollars from oil and gas stocks, which now represent 6 percent - or around $37 billion - of the fund's benchmark equity index.

The proposal came in a letter sent by the central bank to the finance ministry and signed by its governor, Oeystein Olsen, and the chief executive of the fund, Yngve Slyngsad, Deputy Central Bank Governor Egil Matsen said in an interview.

It aims to reduce the exposure of the fund - and therefore the Norwegian government - to oil price fluctuations.

"Our advice is to simply remove the oil and gas sector, as it is defined in the FTSE reference index, from the fund's reference index," Matsen said.

"That would mean all companies that the FTSE has classified with the sector, should be removed from our reference index."

The fund is the world's largest sovereign wealth fund. It invests Norway's revenues from oil and gas production for future generations in stocks, bonds and real estate abroad.

It is among the largest investors in a wide range of oil companies, holding stakes at the end of 2016 of 2.3 percent in Royal Dutch Shell , 1.7 percent of BP , 0.9 percent of Chevron and 0.8 percent of Exxon Mobil .

It also held 1.7 percent of Italy's Eni , 1.6 percent of France's Total and 0.9 percent of Sweden's Lundin Petroleum , among others.

At the end of the third quarter, Royal Dutch Shell was the fund's third-biggest equity investment overall, worth around $5.34 billion and exceeded only by its ownership in Apple and Nestle .

"It clearly stands out, perhaps not surprisingly, but not obviously, that indeed there is a substantial difference ... in return between the oil and gas sector and the broad stock market in periods when the oil price changes substantially," Matsen said.

"Oil price exposure of the government's wealth position can be reduced by not having the fund invested in oil and gas stocks."

The fund could still invest in the sector if other parts of the fund's mandate are fulfilled by having some investments in some of the companies, Matsen said.

"But clearly the direction is that ... if the ministry and the politicians think it is good advice and they say yes to it, clearly the investments in the oil and gas sector will decrease over time," he added.

Oil and gas stocks would be replaced by investments in other companies.

"The straight answer is that all other sectors would be weighted up in proportion ... (under) our current mandate," said Matsen.

At the end of 2016, the fund's equity investments were split between investments in the financial sector (23.3 percent), industrial companies (14.1 percent), consumer goods (13.7 percent), consumer services (10.3 percent), healthcare (10.2 percent), technology (9,5 percent), oil and gas (6.4 percent), basic materials (5.6 percent), telecoms (3.2 percent) and utilities (3.1 percent).

The timing of the coming divestments is as yet unclear. The proposal has to be reviewed by the Finance Ministry, which in turn needs to decide whether to propose it to parliament.

At the earliest, the ministry's first opportunity could come in the spring, with a vote in parliament in June.

In addition to its holdings via the fund, Norway has exposure to oil and gas via large untapped offshore hydrocarbon reserves, as well as its 67 percent stake in the national oil company, Statoil .

The fund has grown so large that even though the Norwegian state is taking less than 3 percent of the fund's value every year for its fiscal budget in recent years, oil spending now accounts for one in five crowns spent by the state. ($1 = 8.2016 Norwegian crowns)

Pakistan LNG import project consortium folds -Hoegh LNG - Reuters News

{{20171116T122358.309+0000}}Pakistan LNG import project consortium folds -Hoegh LNGLONDON, Nov 16 (Reuters) - A consortium behind a liquefied natural gas (LNG) import project in Pakistan, including oil giant Exxon Mobil , France's Total and Qatar Petroleum [QATPE.UL], has been dissolved, shipping company Hoegh LNG said on Thursday.

Hoegh LNG was due to supply the project's ship-based import terminal, a floating storage and regasification unit (FSRU), where LNG brought in by tanker is converted back to gas to feed into Pakistan's grid.

The other six members of the consortium were Japan's Mitsubishi <8058.T> and Turkish developer Global Energy Infrastructure (GEI).

"The consortium has spent considerable time and resources on finding [the project's] final form and structure. However, by mid-November it has been concluded that no agreement with GEI could be found and the consortium has consequently been dissolved," Hoegh LNG said in a results statement.

Last month Reuters reported that Exxon Mobil pulled out of the project owing to disagreements with GEI and that Total and Mitsubishi could also quit and join a rival scheme. [nL8N1N546H]

The project was set to be Pakistan's third and biggest by import capacity, starting in late 2018 or early 2019.

Pakistan plans to add its second LNG import terminal by the end of this year, but private companies have proposed building six more, largely around Port Qasim.

Hoegh LNG did not elaborate on the nature of the disagreement with GEI but industry sources with knowledge of the matter said that part of it related to project costs.

"Due to the withdrawal of the LNG sellers from the infrastructure consortium, and the delays to the original start-up date for the GEI project, Hoegh LNG is evaluating its options with respect to the FSRU contract with GEI," it said.

The company said it is also pursuing alternative opportunities in Pakistan as an FSRU provider.

A highly developed pipeline grid, extensive industrial demand and the biggest natural gas-powered vehicle fleet in Asia behind China and Iran make Pakistan an easy fit for LNG. Official estimates show that imports could jump fivefold to 30 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) by 2022.

The consortium's split also leaves in doubt a multibillion-dollar deal Qatar has already struck with GEI for the sale of up to 2.3 million tonnes of LNG annually over 20 years.

GEI has approached several companies about joining the scheme, including trading house Vitol [VITOLV.UL].

Wall St klesl kvůli ropným firmám, obavy z daní trvají - Reuters (Czech)

{{20171116T074603.202+0000}}Wall St klesl kvůli ropným firmám, obavy z daní trvajíNEW YORK, 16.listopadu (Reuters) - Wall Street ve středu klesl čtvrtou seanci v řadě, když následoval ceny ropy. Pozdější obchodování zatížily obavy ohledně průchodnosti daňových změn poté, co republikánští senátoři návrh zkritizovali.

Index blue chips Dow Jones <.DJI> oslabil o 0,59 procenta na 23.271,28 bodu, širší S&P 500 <.SPX> klesl o 0,55 procenta na 2564,62 bodu a technologický Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> ztratil 0,47 procenta na 6706,208 bodu.

Ceny ropy ve středu klesly po čtvrté v řadě poté, co Mezinárodní agentura pro energii v úterý vydala chmurný výhled poptávky. [O/R]

Akcie Exxon oslabily o 1,3 procenta na 81,21 dolaru a akcie Schlumberger spadly o 2,0 procenta na 61,55 dolarů a během dne se dokonce dotkly nejnižší úrovně od ledna 2016.

Na poli ostře sledovaných daňových změn otřásla trhem zpráva Wall Street Journal, že se republikánský senátor Ron Johnson hodlá postavit proti návrhu. Republikánská senátorka Susan Collinsová také varovala, že se daňovým poplatníkům se středními příjmy může vymazat snížení daní kvůli vyšším pojistným sazbám na zdravotní pojištění, pokud bude zrušen zákon o dostupné zdravotní péči, známý jako Obamacare. [nL1N1NL0LS]

Jejich komentáře poslaly prosazování daňových změn k ledu, protože republikáni si nemohou dovolit ztratit více než dva hlasy.

POINT MARCHÉS-Pétrolières et high tech ont pesé sur Wall Street - Reuters (French)

{{20171115T223429.434+0000}}POINT MARCHÉS-Pétrolières et high tech ont pesé sur Wall Street(Actualisé avec des précisions, éléments de change et obligataires)

* Pertes de 0,59% pour le Dow, de 0,55% pour le S&P, de 0,47% pour le Nasdaq

par Sruthi Shankar et Rodrigo Campos

NEW YORK, 15 novembre (Reuters) - Wall Street a terminé en baisse mercredi dans le sillage des valeurs de l'énergie qui ont pâti pour la quatrième séance d'affilée du recul du pétrole, et de valeurs high tech qui pourraient avoir subi des prises de bénéfice après avoir réalisé les meilleures performances de toute la cote cette année.

Les stocks américains de pétrole brut et d'essence ont affiché une hausse inattendue la semaine dernière, montrent les données publiées mercredi par l'Aadministration américaine d'information sur l'énergie (EIA). [nL8N1NL663]

La demande mondiale de pétrole devrait croître moins vite que prévu dans les prochains mois en raison des températures plus clémentes qui réduiront les besoins de consommation, ce qui pourrait ramener des excédents sur le marché au premier semestre 2018, a dit mardi l'Agence internationale de l'énergie (AIE). [nL8N1NK3LR]

L'indice Dow Jones <.DJI> a perdu 138,19 points (0,59%) à 23.271,28 points. Le S&P-500 <.SPX> a cédé 14,25 points (0,55%) à 2.564,62 points. Le Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> a laissé 31,66 points (0,47%) à 6.706,21 points.

L'indice de volatilité du CBOE <.VIX> a inscrit un pic de plus de deux mois de 14,51, avant de revenir à 13,13, soit un gain de 1,5 point.

Le marché boursier évolue également en fonction des évolutions du marché obligataire et des péripéties entourant la réforme fiscale en devenir aux Etats-Unis.

"Ces derniers jours, la Bourse s'inspire du marché obligataire, surtout du marché 'junk', et les hypothèses sans cesse changeantes quant à l'adoption de la réforme fiscale pèsent aussi", a dit Dave Donabedian (CIBC Atlantic Trust Private Wealth Management).

La courbe des rendements des Treasuries n'a jamais été aussi aplatie depuis 10 ans. Elle a réagi à une statistique d'inflation qui plaide plutôt pour une nouvelle hausse des taux de la part de la Réserve fédérale.

L'écart entre le papier à deux ans et le papier à 10 ans s'est contracté à 63,4 points de base, le plus faible depuis novembre 2007.

Celui entre le papier à cinq ans et le papier à 30 ans s'est rétréci à un petit peu moins de 75 points de base, le plus bas depuis près de deux semaines.

Les prix de détail ont très légèrement augmenté le mois dernier aux Etats-Unis malgré la disparition des effets de l'ouragan Harvey sur le renchérissement de l'essence tandis que la hausse des loyers et du coût des dépenses de santé suggère un renforcement progressif de l'inflation sous-jacente. [nL8N1NL55Q]

"Dans la mesure où les pressions inflationnistes de fond recommencent à se manifester, nous pensons que la Fed devrait accélérer le rythme du durcissement monétaire l'an prochain, relevant le taux des Fed funds par quatre fois en 2018", a dit Michael Pearce (Capital Economics).

La statistique des prix de détail, ainsi que celle des ventes au détail, et une telle perspective pour les taux expliquent que le dollar ait réduit ses pertes face à un panier de devises de référence pour revenir à peu près à l'équilibre <.DXY>. [nL8N1NL5CO]

Mais, observe Mazen Issa (TD Securities), le potentiel haussier du dollar risque de s'émousser si la réforme fiscale ne prend pas force de loi.

Les sénateurs républicains ont présenté jeudi dernier leur propre projet de réforme fiscale qui prévoit notamment de reporter d'un an, à 2019, la baisse de l'impôt sur les sociétés aux Etats-Unis.

Avec l'approbation de Donald Trump, les républicains de la Chambre des représentants ont pour leur part proposé de baisser de 35% à 20% le taux de l'impôt sur les sociétés dès 2018 tout en ouvrant la porte à une mise en oeuvre progressive. [nL8N1NG0B7]

Aux valeurs, le distributeur Target a chuté de près de 10% en raison d'une prévision de bénéfice jugée décevante pour le quatrième trimestre.

Whole Foods Market, la chaîne de supermarchés bio acquise cet été par Amazon.com , a annoncé mercredi des baisses de prix pour ses produits les plus vendus et des articles de saison à l'approche de la période des fêtes, faisant craindre une guerre des prix. [nL8N1NL5Z6]

C'est pourquoi, dans le même compartiment Kroger a perdu 1,9% et Costco 1,4%.

Dans le compartiment des valeurs de l'énergie, Exxon a lâché 1,25%, et les parapétroliers Schlumberger et Halliburton 1,96% et 2,9% respectivement, amenant l'indice <.SPNY> a abandonner 1,17%, le plus net recul sectoriel de la journée.

Les valeurs high tech sont celles qui ont le plus pesé sur l'indice S&P-500, un mouvement que Peter Jankovski (OakBrook Investments) attribue en partie "à leur très forte performance cette année; certains ont peut-être pris leur bénéfice".

Apple a cédé 1,3% et Alphabet 0,5%. L'indice sectoriel <.SPLRCRT> a abandonné 0,85%.

Après la clôture, l'action Cisco Systems gagnait près de 3,8%, en réaction aux résultats et prévisions du premier équipementier de réseaux mondial. [nL8N1NL7UU]

Le volume a représenté 6,55 milliards de titres échangés contre une moyenne de 6,78 milliards sur les 20 dernières séances.

* Target slumps after weak holiday quarter forecast

* Indexes down: Dow 0.45 pct, S&P 0.45 pct, Nasdaq 0.44 pct

(Changes comment, updates prices,)

By Sruthi Shankar

Nov 15 (Reuters) - Wall Street's main indexes were lower on Wednesday as energy stocks remained under pressure after oil prices fell for a fourth straight day.

An unexpected rise in U.S. crude oil and gasoline stocks added to a gloomy global demand outlook from the International Energy Agency, sending oil prices down more than 1 percent. [O/R]

Exxon fell 0.7 percent, Schlumberger 1.7 percent and Halliburton 2.7 percent, dragging down the S&P energy index <.SPNY>.

Metal prices also slid as data from China stoked fears of a slowdown in the world's top commodities consumer. [nL8N1NL3VX]

"The market often goes through a bit of a what's next in terms of a catalyst. Some of it's just a natural pullback from what has been an extraordinary year," said Dave Donabedian, chief investment officer of CIBC Atlantic Trust Private Wealth Management.

"In recent days, the stock market is taking cues from the bond market, particularly the junk bond market and the constantly changing odds of tax reform passing is also weighing."

The U.S. Treasury yield curve flattened to a 10-year low after data showed a slight pickup in U.S. inflation, as the market priced in further interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve next year. [nL1N1NL0OX]

At 10:53 a.m. ET (1453 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average <.DJI> was down 105.32 points, or 0.45 percent, at 23,304.15, the S&P 500 <.SPX> was down 11.55 points, or 0.45 percent, at 2,567.32 and the Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> was down 29.85 points, or 0.44 percent, at 6,708.02.

All three indexes were on track to post their biggest intra-day percentage losses since Nov. 9.

The CBOE Volatility index <.VIX>, a widely followed measure of market anxiety, hit a more than 2 month high at 14.51.

Target shares tumbled 12 percent after the retailer issued a disappointing profit forecast for the key holiday quarter. [nL3N1NL45J]

Amazon-owned Whole Foods Market announced price cuts on best-selling grocery items and holiday staples. [nL3N1NL4PS]

Shares of other retailers fell. Kroger slipped 1.82 percent, Costco 1 percent and Kellogg 2.19 percent.

Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,983 to 806. On the Nasdaq, 1,740 issues fell and 967 advanced.

EXCLUSIVE-Glencore offers Chad new plan to repay more than $1 bln loan - Reuters News

{{20171115T151752.516+0000}}EXCLUSIVE-Glencore offers Chad new plan to repay more than $1 bln loan* Chad under pressure from IMF to restructure debt

* Glencore letter says hopes IMF satisfied by offer

* Talks in Paris last week failed to reach deal - letter

(Adds detail)

By Julia Payne

LONDON, Nov 15 (Reuters) - Commodities trader Glencore has offered Chad a grace period from principal repayments on a more than $1 billion cash-for-crude loan and extended the deadline for full repayment to 2025 from 2022, a letter seen by Reuters showed.

The Central African nation is under pressure to restructure its Glencore debt for a second time after the International Monetary Fund said this year that Chad's external commercial debt, mostly to Glencore, was unsustainable. [nL8N1MN3SW]

The Swiss-based commodities trader and miner, which lent Chad the money before oil prices began tumbling in mid-2014, said in the letter to Chad's finance minister that it hoped the proposal would satisfy the IMF, which was copied.

Glencore held meetings with Chad's delegation in Paris last week to discuss the loan, but no deal was reached.

The letter from Glencore, dated Nov. 14, offered Chad a grace period from principal repayments until the last quarter of 2019, with the interest rate in that period lowered to 4 percent from 6.75 percent.

In addition, the firm offered to release Chad from its call on $1 billion worth of the country's crude during the next three years, the letter said, to support the Chadian budget and domestic fuel needs.

The letter, addressed to Finance Minister Christian Georges Diguimbaye, said Glencore was "told on Friday night that one more time, our enhanced proposal was not enough and that the Republic of Chad was retracting its latest position once more".

Officials at the Finance Ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Glencore and a consortium of the trading firm's bankers had lent Chad's state oil firm $1.45 billion in 2014 in exchange for crude. The deal was restructured in 2015 following the crash in global oil prices. Chad still owes about $1.3 billion.

Negotiations on the loan, led by Glencore, became fraught last month after Chad decided to divert some crude being marketed by Glencore to the country's biggest producer, Exxon Mobil . [nL8N1N40CY]

In the letter, Glencore said it had made "substantial concessions" despite significant changes to the renegotiation parameters from Chad's original July proposal.

Such changes included "the discovery" that the Chadian government had decided to divert about 40 percent of its oil, which it called a "blatant breach of the agreement".

Hit by drought, a refugee crisis and a costly military campaign against Islamist militant group Boko Haram, Chad has had loans from the IMF, World Bank and African Development Bank, with another $12.9 billion of pledged funding as of September from public and private donors for a 2017-2021 development plan.

Chad's production has averaged 131,000 barrels per day so far in 2017, government data showed.

POINT MARCHÉS-Wall Street recule, plombée par la baisse du pétrole - Reuters (French)

{{20171115T150541.450+0000}}POINT MARCHÉS-Wall Street recule, plombée par la baisse du pétrole15 novembre (Reuters) - La Bourse de New York poursuit son repli en début de séance mercredi, pénalisée la baisse par les cours du pétrole et le recul de plusieurs grands distributeurs face à une nouvelle offensive d'Amazon sur les prix.

L'indice Dow Jones <.DJI> perd 161,05 points, soit 0,69%, à 23.248,42. Le Standard & Poor's 500 <.SPX>, plus large, recule de 0,75% à 2.559,55 et le Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> cède 0,87% à 6.679,48.

L'indice de volatilité du CBOE <.VIX> est en hausse de plus de deux points, au plus haut depuis le 21 août.

Les prix du baril de Brent et du brut léger américain (West Texas Intermediate, WTI) poursuivent leur repli et perdent plus de 1% après l'abaissement par l'Agence internationale de l'Energie (AIE) de sa prévision de demande mondiale pour cette année et pour 2018, qui s'est ajouté à une série d'indicateurs chinois moins bons que prévu. .

L'annonce par l'association professionnelle API d'une hausse inattendue des stocks de brut aux Etats-Unis a encore accru la pression sur les cours de l'or noir. [nL8N1NK3LR] Dans ce contexte, les investisseurs suivront avec attention la publication à 15h30 GMT des données officielles sur les stocks américains.

En attendant, le compartiment lié à l'énergie <.SPNY> baisse de 1,47% et celui des matières premières <.SPLRCM> de 1%.

Les titres Exxon et Chevron perdent respectivement 1,01% et 0,5%.

Sur le marché des changes, le dollar a momentanément accentué ses pertes après la publication, une heure avant l'ouverture des marchés actions, d'une série d'indicateurs macroéconomiques.

Les prix à la consommation ont très légèrement augmenté le mois dernier malgré la dissipation des effets de l'ouragan Harvey sur le prix de l'essence, tandis que la hausse des loyers et des tarifs dans le secteur de la santé suggère un renforcement progressif de l'inflation sous-jacente. [nL8N1NL55Q]

TARGET CHUTE, SES PRÉVISIONS DÉÇOIVENT

Les ventes au détail ont parallèlement enregistré une croissance inattendue en octobre grâce à une hausse des achats automobiles, qui ont compensé la baisse de la demande de matériaux de construction. [nL8N1NL5CO]

Enfin, l'enquête mensuelle "Empire State" de la Réserve fédérale de New York a montré un ralentissement plus important que prévu ces dernières semaines de l'activité manufacturière dans la région après son rebond du mois d'octobre. [nL8N1NL5A6]

Le billet vert est revenu à son plus bas niveau depuis un mois face à un panier de devises de référence après ces statistiques, avant d'effacer une partie de ses pertes, limitant ainsi son repli à 0,18% <.DXY>.

Le rendement des Treasuries à 10 ans recule lui aussi, à 2,329%.

Les valeurs de la distribution et plusieurs grands groupes alimentaires chutent par ailleurs après l'annonce par Amazon et sa filiale Whole Foods de baisses de prix pour la période des fêtes.

Wal-Mart cède 0,49%, Costco 0,66% et Kroger 1,95%. Le secteur des biens de consommations recule de 0,67% <.SPLRCS>.

Toujours dans la distribution, Target chute de 8,39% après l'annonce d'une prévision de bénéfice ajusté pour la période des fêtes inférieure aux attentes des analystes.

Le titre Snap cède 0,8% à la suite de l'annonce de la liquidation de la participation du fonds de l'investisseur américain George Soros.

En Europe, les places financières évoluent dans le rouge. Le CAC 40 <.FCHI> perd 0,73% et le Stoxx 600 <.STOXX> 0,91%.

UPDATE 2-Dutch court rejects government's Groningen gas production plan - Reuters News

{{20171115T142310.972+0000}}UPDATE 2-Dutch court rejects government's Groningen gas production plan(Adds reaction from Economic Affairs Ministry and gas extraction company NAM and more background)

By Bart H. Meijer

THE HAGUE, Nov 15 (Reuters) - The highest Dutch administrative court has rejected the government's plan to cap production at a major gas field that has caused damaging earthquakes, saying it might be possible to cut output further without endangering supplies.

The decision adds another chapter to the long fight over gas production in the northern Dutch province of Groningen, where citizens accuse the government of endangering their lives while protecting gas revenues.

The government had proposed capping production at the Groningen gas field at 21.6 billion cubic metres (bcm) per year over the next five years, after a 2015 report found production was risking lives. That would be down from 24 bcm in the production year just ended and 39.4 bcm in 2015-16. [nL8N19G55U]

But the Council of State said on Wednesday the government had failed to properly substantiate its decision, describing it as "unacceptable" to potentially keep production unchanged for five years when it might be possible to further reduce demand.

The Council ordered the government to review its decision within the next 12 months, but production could be maintained at 21.6 bcm for the year through Oct. 1, 2018.

The Economic Affairs Ministry called the verdict a "tough decision", but accepted it has to come up with a new plan in the coming year.

The drafting of a new plan will be the responsibility of Economic Affairs minister Eric Wiebes, whose predecessor Henk Kamp left office when the new government was installed last month. Kamp lowered gas production in Groningen several times in response to earthquakes, but was still seen by residents as neglecting the risks of ongoing production.

Wednesday's decision was met with jubilation from Groningen citizens, many of whom have seen their houses damaged by the thousands of small earthquakes triggered by the gas extraction.

"We won on all fronts. All lousy excuses the government used to justify production have been tossed out the window," said Dirk Kleijer, a spokesman for the Groninger Bodembeweging campaign group.

"The minister now needs to put the safety of residents first. He now needs to come up with a good plan: to lower production and to guarantee our safety".

NAM, the Royal Dutch Shell and ExxonMobil joint venture that operates the Groningen field, also found support in the court ruling, saying it affirmed its view that the safe level of production can be determined by using the right models.

The NAM had contested the government's new production cap, saying it ignored earlier agreed safety norms.

Pakistan LNG import project consortium folds -Hoegh LNG - Reuters News

{{20171116T122358.309+0000}}Pakistan LNG import project consortium folds -Hoegh LNGLONDON, Nov 16 (Reuters) - A consortium behind a liquefied natural gas (LNG) import project in Pakistan, including oil giant Exxon Mobil , France's Total and Qatar Petroleum [QATPE.UL], has been dissolved, shipping company Hoegh LNG said on Thursday.

Hoegh LNG was due to supply the project's ship-based import terminal, a floating storage and regasification unit (FSRU), where LNG brought in by tanker is converted back to gas to feed into Pakistan's grid.

The other six members of the consortium were Japan's Mitsubishi <8058.T> and Turkish developer Global Energy Infrastructure (GEI).

"The consortium has spent considerable time and resources on finding [the project's] final form and structure. However, by mid-November it has been concluded that no agreement with GEI could be found and the consortium has consequently been dissolved," Hoegh LNG said in a results statement.

Last month Reuters reported that Exxon Mobil pulled out of the project owing to disagreements with GEI and that Total and Mitsubishi could also quit and join a rival scheme. [nL8N1N546H]

The project was set to be Pakistan's third and biggest by import capacity, starting in late 2018 or early 2019.

Pakistan plans to add its second LNG import terminal by the end of this year, but private companies have proposed building six more, largely around Port Qasim.

Hoegh LNG did not elaborate on the nature of the disagreement with GEI but industry sources with knowledge of the matter said that part of it related to project costs.

"Due to the withdrawal of the LNG sellers from the infrastructure consortium, and the delays to the original start-up date for the GEI project, Hoegh LNG is evaluating its options with respect to the FSRU contract with GEI," it said.

The company said it is also pursuing alternative opportunities in Pakistan as an FSRU provider.

A highly developed pipeline grid, extensive industrial demand and the biggest natural gas-powered vehicle fleet in Asia behind China and Iran make Pakistan an easy fit for LNG. Official estimates show that imports could jump fivefold to 30 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) by 2022.

The consortium's split also leaves in doubt a multibillion-dollar deal Qatar has already struck with GEI for the sale of up to 2.3 million tonnes of LNG annually over 20 years.

GEI has approached several companies about joining the scheme, including trading house Vitol [VITOLV.UL].

Wall St klesl kvůli ropným firmám, obavy z daní trvají - Reuters (Czech)

{{20171116T074603.202+0000}}Wall St klesl kvůli ropným firmám, obavy z daní trvajíNEW YORK, 16.listopadu (Reuters) - Wall Street ve středu klesl čtvrtou seanci v řadě, když následoval ceny ropy. Pozdější obchodování zatížily obavy ohledně průchodnosti daňových změn poté, co republikánští senátoři návrh zkritizovali.

Index blue chips Dow Jones <.DJI> oslabil o 0,59 procenta na 23.271,28 bodu, širší S&P 500 <.SPX> klesl o 0,55 procenta na 2564,62 bodu a technologický Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> ztratil 0,47 procenta na 6706,208 bodu.

Ceny ropy ve středu klesly po čtvrté v řadě poté, co Mezinárodní agentura pro energii v úterý vydala chmurný výhled poptávky. [O/R]

Akcie Exxon oslabily o 1,3 procenta na 81,21 dolaru a akcie Schlumberger spadly o 2,0 procenta na 61,55 dolarů a během dne se dokonce dotkly nejnižší úrovně od ledna 2016.

Na poli ostře sledovaných daňových změn otřásla trhem zpráva Wall Street Journal, že se republikánský senátor Ron Johnson hodlá postavit proti návrhu. Republikánská senátorka Susan Collinsová také varovala, že se daňovým poplatníkům se středními příjmy může vymazat snížení daní kvůli vyšším pojistným sazbám na zdravotní pojištění, pokud bude zrušen zákon o dostupné zdravotní péči, známý jako Obamacare. [nL1N1NL0LS]

Jejich komentáře poslaly prosazování daňových změn k ledu, protože republikáni si nemohou dovolit ztratit více než dva hlasy.

POINT MARCHÉS-Pétrolières et high tech ont pesé sur Wall Street - Reuters (French)

{{20171115T223429.434+0000}}POINT MARCHÉS-Pétrolières et high tech ont pesé sur Wall Street(Actualisé avec des précisions, éléments de change et obligataires)

* Pertes de 0,59% pour le Dow, de 0,55% pour le S&P, de 0,47% pour le Nasdaq

par Sruthi Shankar et Rodrigo Campos

NEW YORK, 15 novembre (Reuters) - Wall Street a terminé en baisse mercredi dans le sillage des valeurs de l'énergie qui ont pâti pour la quatrième séance d'affilée du recul du pétrole, et de valeurs high tech qui pourraient avoir subi des prises de bénéfice après avoir réalisé les meilleures performances de toute la cote cette année.

Les stocks américains de pétrole brut et d'essence ont affiché une hausse inattendue la semaine dernière, montrent les données publiées mercredi par l'Aadministration américaine d'information sur l'énergie (EIA). [nL8N1NL663]

La demande mondiale de pétrole devrait croître moins vite que prévu dans les prochains mois en raison des températures plus clémentes qui réduiront les besoins de consommation, ce qui pourrait ramener des excédents sur le marché au premier semestre 2018, a dit mardi l'Agence internationale de l'énergie (AIE). [nL8N1NK3LR]

L'indice Dow Jones <.DJI> a perdu 138,19 points (0,59%) à 23.271,28 points. Le S&P-500 <.SPX> a cédé 14,25 points (0,55%) à 2.564,62 points. Le Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> a laissé 31,66 points (0,47%) à 6.706,21 points.

L'indice de volatilité du CBOE <.VIX> a inscrit un pic de plus de deux mois de 14,51, avant de revenir à 13,13, soit un gain de 1,5 point.

Le marché boursier évolue également en fonction des évolutions du marché obligataire et des péripéties entourant la réforme fiscale en devenir aux Etats-Unis.

"Ces derniers jours, la Bourse s'inspire du marché obligataire, surtout du marché 'junk', et les hypothèses sans cesse changeantes quant à l'adoption de la réforme fiscale pèsent aussi", a dit Dave Donabedian (CIBC Atlantic Trust Private Wealth Management).

La courbe des rendements des Treasuries n'a jamais été aussi aplatie depuis 10 ans. Elle a réagi à une statistique d'inflation qui plaide plutôt pour une nouvelle hausse des taux de la part de la Réserve fédérale.

L'écart entre le papier à deux ans et le papier à 10 ans s'est contracté à 63,4 points de base, le plus faible depuis novembre 2007.

Celui entre le papier à cinq ans et le papier à 30 ans s'est rétréci à un petit peu moins de 75 points de base, le plus bas depuis près de deux semaines.

Les prix de détail ont très légèrement augmenté le mois dernier aux Etats-Unis malgré la disparition des effets de l'ouragan Harvey sur le renchérissement de l'essence tandis que la hausse des loyers et du coût des dépenses de santé suggère un renforcement progressif de l'inflation sous-jacente. [nL8N1NL55Q]

"Dans la mesure où les pressions inflationnistes de fond recommencent à se manifester, nous pensons que la Fed devrait accélérer le rythme du durcissement monétaire l'an prochain, relevant le taux des Fed funds par quatre fois en 2018", a dit Michael Pearce (Capital Economics).

La statistique des prix de détail, ainsi que celle des ventes au détail, et une telle perspective pour les taux expliquent que le dollar ait réduit ses pertes face à un panier de devises de référence pour revenir à peu près à l'équilibre <.DXY>. [nL8N1NL5CO]

Mais, observe Mazen Issa (TD Securities), le potentiel haussier du dollar risque de s'émousser si la réforme fiscale ne prend pas force de loi.

Les sénateurs républicains ont présenté jeudi dernier leur propre projet de réforme fiscale qui prévoit notamment de reporter d'un an, à 2019, la baisse de l'impôt sur les sociétés aux Etats-Unis.

Avec l'approbation de Donald Trump, les républicains de la Chambre des représentants ont pour leur part proposé de baisser de 35% à 20% le taux de l'impôt sur les sociétés dès 2018 tout en ouvrant la porte à une mise en oeuvre progressive. [nL8N1NG0B7]

Aux valeurs, le distributeur Target a chuté de près de 10% en raison d'une prévision de bénéfice jugée décevante pour le quatrième trimestre.

Whole Foods Market, la chaîne de supermarchés bio acquise cet été par Amazon.com , a annoncé mercredi des baisses de prix pour ses produits les plus vendus et des articles de saison à l'approche de la période des fêtes, faisant craindre une guerre des prix. [nL8N1NL5Z6]

C'est pourquoi, dans le même compartiment Kroger a perdu 1,9% et Costco 1,4%.

Dans le compartiment des valeurs de l'énergie, Exxon a lâché 1,25%, et les parapétroliers Schlumberger et Halliburton 1,96% et 2,9% respectivement, amenant l'indice <.SPNY> a abandonner 1,17%, le plus net recul sectoriel de la journée.

Les valeurs high tech sont celles qui ont le plus pesé sur l'indice S&P-500, un mouvement que Peter Jankovski (OakBrook Investments) attribue en partie "à leur très forte performance cette année; certains ont peut-être pris leur bénéfice".

Apple a cédé 1,3% et Alphabet 0,5%. L'indice sectoriel <.SPLRCRT> a abandonné 0,85%.

Après la clôture, l'action Cisco Systems gagnait près de 3,8%, en réaction aux résultats et prévisions du premier équipementier de réseaux mondial. [nL8N1NL7UU]

Le volume a représenté 6,55 milliards de titres échangés contre une moyenne de 6,78 milliards sur les 20 dernières séances.

(Changes comment, updates prices,)

By Sruthi Shankar

Nov 15 (Reuters) - Wall Street's main indexes were lower on Wednesday as energy stocks remained under pressure after oil prices fell for a fourth straight day.

An unexpected rise in U.S. crude oil and gasoline stocks added to a gloomy global demand outlook from the International Energy Agency, sending oil prices down more than 1 percent. [O/R]

Exxon fell 0.7 percent, Schlumberger 1.7 percent and Halliburton 2.7 percent, dragging down the S&P energy index <.SPNY>.

Metal prices also slid as data from China stoked fears of a slowdown in the world's top commodities consumer. [nL8N1NL3VX]

"The market often goes through a bit of a what's next in terms of a catalyst. Some of it's just a natural pullback from what has been an extraordinary year," said Dave Donabedian, chief investment officer of CIBC Atlantic Trust Private Wealth Management.

"In recent days, the stock market is taking cues from the bond market, particularly the junk bond market and the constantly changing odds of tax reform passing is also weighing."

The U.S. Treasury yield curve flattened to a 10-year low after data showed a slight pickup in U.S. inflation, as the market priced in further interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve next year. [nL1N1NL0OX]

At 10:53 a.m. ET (1453 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average <.DJI> was down 105.32 points, or 0.45 percent, at 23,304.15, the S&P 500 <.SPX> was down 11.55 points, or 0.45 percent, at 2,567.32 and the Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> was down 29.85 points, or 0.44 percent, at 6,708.02.

All three indexes were on track to post their biggest intra-day percentage losses since Nov. 9.

The CBOE Volatility index <.VIX>, a widely followed measure of market anxiety, hit a more than 2 month high at 14.51.

Target shares tumbled 12 percent after the retailer issued a disappointing profit forecast for the key holiday quarter. [nL3N1NL45J]

Amazon-owned Whole Foods Market announced price cuts on best-selling grocery items and holiday staples. [nL3N1NL4PS]

Shares of other retailers fell. Kroger slipped 1.82 percent, Costco 1 percent and Kellogg 2.19 percent.

Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,983 to 806. On the Nasdaq, 1,740 issues fell and 967 advanced.

EXCLUSIVE-Glencore offers Chad new plan to repay more than $1 bln loan - Reuters News

{{20171115T151752.516+0000}}EXCLUSIVE-Glencore offers Chad new plan to repay more than $1 bln loan* Chad under pressure from IMF to restructure debt

* Glencore letter says hopes IMF satisfied by offer

* Talks in Paris last week failed to reach deal - letter

(Adds detail)

By Julia Payne

LONDON, Nov 15 (Reuters) - Commodities trader Glencore has offered Chad a grace period from principal repayments on a more than $1 billion cash-for-crude loan and extended the deadline for full repayment to 2025 from 2022, a letter seen by Reuters showed.

The Central African nation is under pressure to restructure its Glencore debt for a second time after the International Monetary Fund said this year that Chad's external commercial debt, mostly to Glencore, was unsustainable. [nL8N1MN3SW]

The Swiss-based commodities trader and miner, which lent Chad the money before oil prices began tumbling in mid-2014, said in the letter to Chad's finance minister that it hoped the proposal would satisfy the IMF, which was copied.

Glencore held meetings with Chad's delegation in Paris last week to discuss the loan, but no deal was reached.

The letter from Glencore, dated Nov. 14, offered Chad a grace period from principal repayments until the last quarter of 2019, with the interest rate in that period lowered to 4 percent from 6.75 percent.

In addition, the firm offered to release Chad from its call on $1 billion worth of the country's crude during the next three years, the letter said, to support the Chadian budget and domestic fuel needs.

The letter, addressed to Finance Minister Christian Georges Diguimbaye, said Glencore was "told on Friday night that one more time, our enhanced proposal was not enough and that the Republic of Chad was retracting its latest position once more".

Officials at the Finance Ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Glencore and a consortium of the trading firm's bankers had lent Chad's state oil firm $1.45 billion in 2014 in exchange for crude. The deal was restructured in 2015 following the crash in global oil prices. Chad still owes about $1.3 billion.

Negotiations on the loan, led by Glencore, became fraught last month after Chad decided to divert some crude being marketed by Glencore to the country's biggest producer, Exxon Mobil . [nL8N1N40CY]

In the letter, Glencore said it had made "substantial concessions" despite significant changes to the renegotiation parameters from Chad's original July proposal.

Such changes included "the discovery" that the Chadian government had decided to divert about 40 percent of its oil, which it called a "blatant breach of the agreement".

Hit by drought, a refugee crisis and a costly military campaign against Islamist militant group Boko Haram, Chad has had loans from the IMF, World Bank and African Development Bank, with another $12.9 billion of pledged funding as of September from public and private donors for a 2017-2021 development plan.

Chad's production has averaged 131,000 barrels per day so far in 2017, government data showed.

{{20171115T151749.000+0000}}EXCLUSIVE-Glencore offers Chad new plan to repay more than $1 bln loanLONDON, Nov 15 (Reuters)

* Chad under pressure from IMF to restructure debt

* Glencore letter says hopes IMF satisfied by offer

* Talks in Paris last week failed to reach deal - letter

(Adds detail)

By Julia Payne

LONDON, Nov 15 (Reuters) - Commodities trader Glencore has offered Chad a grace period from principal repayments on a more than $1 billion cash-for-crude loan and extended the deadline for full repayment to 2025 from 2022, a letter seen by Reuters showed.

The Central African nation is under pressure to restructure its Glencore debt for a second time after the International Monetary Fund said this year that Chad's external commercial debt, mostly to Glencore, was unsustainable. [nL8N1MN3SW]

The Swiss-based commodities trader and miner, which lent Chad the money before oil prices began tumbling in mid-2014, said in the letter to Chad's finance minister that it hoped the proposal would satisfy the IMF, which was copied.

Glencore held meetings with Chad's delegation in Paris last week to discuss the loan, but no deal was reached.

The letter from Glencore, dated Nov. 14, offered Chad a grace period from principal repayments until the last quarter of 2019, with the interest rate in that period lowered to 4 percent from 6.75 percent.

In addition, the firm offered to release Chad from its call on $1 billion worth of the country's crude during the next three years, the letter said, to support the Chadian budget and domestic fuel needs.

The letter, addressed to Finance Minister Christian Georges Diguimbaye, said Glencore was "told on Friday night that one more time, our enhanced proposal was not enough and that the Republic of Chad was retracting its latest position once more".

Officials at the Finance Ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Glencore and a consortium of the trading firm's bankers had lent Chad's state oil firm $1.45 billion in 2014 in exchange for crude. The deal was restructured in 2015 following the crash in global oil prices. Chad still owes about $1.3 billion.

Negotiations on the loan, led by Glencore, became fraught last month after Chad decided to divert some crude being marketed by Glencore to the country's biggest producer, Exxon Mobil . [nL8N1N40CY]

In the letter, Glencore said it had made "substantial concessions" despite significant changes to the renegotiation parameters from Chad's original July proposal.

Such changes included "the discovery" that the Chadian government had decided to divert about 40 percent of its oil, which it called a "blatant breach of the agreement".

Hit by drought, a refugee crisis and a costly military campaign against Islamist militant group Boko Haram, Chad has had loans from the IMF, World Bank and African Development Bank, with another $12.9 billion of pledged funding as of September from public and private donors for a 2017-2021 development plan.

Chad's production has averaged 131,000 barrels per day so far in 2017, government data showed.

L'indice Dow Jones <.DJI> perd 161,05 points, soit 0,69%, à 23.248,42. Le Standard & Poor's 500 <.SPX>, plus large, recule de 0,75% à 2.559,55 et le Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> cède 0,87% à 6.679,48.

L'indice de volatilité du CBOE <.VIX> est en hausse de plus de deux points, au plus haut depuis le 21 août.

Les prix du baril de Brent et du brut léger américain (West Texas Intermediate, WTI) poursuivent leur repli et perdent plus de 1% après l'abaissement par l'Agence internationale de l'Energie (AIE) de sa prévision de demande mondiale pour cette année et pour 2018, qui s'est ajouté à une série d'indicateurs chinois moins bons que prévu. .

L'annonce par l'association professionnelle API d'une hausse inattendue des stocks de brut aux Etats-Unis a encore accru la pression sur les cours de l'or noir.

Sur le marché des changes, le dollar a momentanément accentué ses pertes après la publication, une heure avant l'ouverture des marchés actions, d'une série d'indicateurs macroéconomiques.

Les prix à la consommation ont très légèrement augmenté le mois dernier malgré la dissipation des effets de l'ouragan Harvey sur le prix de l'essence, tandis que la hausse des loyers et des tarifs dans le secteur de la santé suggère un renforcement progressif de l'inflation sous-jacente.

UPDATE 2-Dutch court rejects government's Groningen gas production plan - Reuters News

{{20171115T142310.972+0000}}UPDATE 2-Dutch court rejects government's Groningen gas production plan(Adds reaction from Economic Affairs Ministry and gas extraction company NAM and more background)

By Bart H. Meijer

THE HAGUE, Nov 15 (Reuters) - The highest Dutch administrative court has rejected the government's plan to cap production at a major gas field that has caused damaging earthquakes, saying it might be possible to cut output further without endangering supplies.

The decision adds another chapter to the long fight over gas production in the northern Dutch province of Groningen, where citizens accuse the government of endangering their lives while protecting gas revenues.

The government had proposed capping production at the Groningen gas field at 21.6 billion cubic metres (bcm) per year over the next five years, after a 2015 report found production was risking lives. That would be down from 24 bcm in the production year just ended and 39.4 bcm in 2015-16. [nL8N19G55U]

But the Council of State said on Wednesday the government had failed to properly substantiate its decision, describing it as "unacceptable" to potentially keep production unchanged for five years when it might be possible to further reduce demand.

The Council ordered the government to review its decision within the next 12 months, but production could be maintained at 21.6 bcm for the year through Oct. 1, 2018.

The Economic Affairs Ministry called the verdict a "tough decision", but accepted it has to come up with a new plan in the coming year.

The drafting of a new plan will be the responsibility of Economic Affairs minister Eric Wiebes, whose predecessor Henk Kamp left office when the new government was installed last month. Kamp lowered gas production in Groningen several times in response to earthquakes, but was still seen by residents as neglecting the risks of ongoing production.

Wednesday's decision was met with jubilation from Groningen citizens, many of whom have seen their houses damaged by the thousands of small earthquakes triggered by the gas extraction.

"We won on all fronts. All lousy excuses the government used to justify production have been tossed out the window," said Dirk Kleijer, a spokesman for the Groninger Bodembeweging campaign group.

"The minister now needs to put the safety of residents first. He now needs to come up with a good plan: to lower production and to guarantee our safety".

NAM, the Royal Dutch Shell and ExxonMobil joint venture that operates the Groningen field, also found support in the court ruling, saying it affirmed its view that the safe level of production can be determined by using the right models.

The NAM had contested the government's new production cap, saying it ignored earlier agreed safety norms.

U.S. senators blast State Department over cuts - Reuters News

{{20171114T155659.963+0000}}U.S. senators blast State Department over cutsBy Patricia Zengerle

WASHINGTON, Nov 14 (Reuters) - The Republican and Democratic leaders of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee blasted the U.S. State Department on Tuesday for cuts in staff and what they described as a failure to have a plan for a proposed reorganization.

"I don't think they are anywhere close to having a plan to present relative to the reforms that they want," said Senator Bob Corker, the Republican chairman of the committee.

Rex Tillerson, Republican President Donald Trump's Secretary of State, has embraced the White House's proposal - rejected by key members of Congress - to cut the State Department budget by about 30 percent. He has imposed a hiring freeze while analyzing the agency's operations and deciding how to reorganize them.

Tillerson, a former chief executive at Exxon Mobil Corp who took office on Feb. 1, has offered few specifics to ease concerns, including in Congress, that the plan risks weakening U.S. standing in the world.

Senator Ben Cardin, the top Democrat on the Foreign Relations panel, called the staff reductions a risk to national security and a "high-level decapitation of leadership."

"Folks, this situation is alarming. We put our country in danger," Cardin said during a committee business meeting.

Corker said the panel had had "a very unsatisfactory meeting last week with the State Department" and that concern was bipartisan. "We need to be much more focused on holding them accountable," Corker said.

Trump has several times contradicted Tillerson on foreign policy issues. The president said earlier this month that his opinion was the only one that mattered in U.S. foreign policy. "The one that matters is me," Trump said on Fox News. "I'm the only one that matters because, when it comes to it, that's what the policy is going to be." [nL2N1N9155]

Eni signs Oman oil and gas exploration deal, Qatari firm to take stake - Reuters News

{{20171114T113057.059+0000}}Eni signs Oman oil and gas exploration deal, Qatari firm to take stakeMILAN, Nov 14 (Reuters) - Italian energy firm Eni signed a deal on Tuesday to explore an area off the southern coast of Oman for oil and gas and inked an agreement for Qatar Petroleum (QP) to take a stake in the block.

Under the Exploration and Production Sharing Agreement (EPSA), Eni will be operator of Block 52 with an initial 85 percent stake, with the rest held by a subsidiary of state-owned Oman Oil Company SAOC.

But Eni said it had also signed an agreement to cede 30 percent of the block to Qatar Petroleum (QP), a move that will reduce the Italian firm's stake to 55 percent once completed.

Selling down stakes in oil and gas fields it operates is part of Eni's so-called "dual exploration" strategy to raise cash to fund development and support dividends.

"The signing of the Block 52 EPSA represents an important milestone in Eni's strategy to reinforce its presence in the Middle East region," Eni CEO Claudio Descalzi said.

Descalzi welcomed the deal with QP given its position as a top liquefied natural gas (LNG) operator.

Eni, the biggest foreign oil producer in Africa, is seeking to develop its LNG business in an effort to find markets for its bumper gas discoveries in Mozambique and Egypt.

Block 52, located in water depths ranging from 10 metres to over 2,000 metres, is largely underexplored, covering more than 90,000 square kilometres, QP said in a separate statement.

QP is seeking to expand overseas through joint ventures with international oil firms to maintain its dominance over rivals in the United States and Australia.

It will start drilling with ExxonMobil for oil and gas off the southern coast of Cyprus in 2018.

UPDATE 1-Ghana opens talks with Exxon on deepwater drilling contract  - Reuters News

{{20171113T205644.817+0000}}UPDATE 1-Ghana opens talks with Exxon on deepwater drilling contract (Adds quotes and context)

By Kwasi Kpodo

ACCRA, Nov 13 (Reuters) - Ghana has opened talks with Exxon Mobil Corp to allow the U.S. oil firm to undertake deepwater exploration off its coast, a deputy energy minister said on Monday.

"The negotiations are ongoing according to our current laws ... so far so good," Mohamed Amin Adam told Reuters on the sidelines of an Africa oil conference in Accra.

Adam said the government had opted for direct negotiation with Exxon Mobil without open competitive tendering due to the peculiar nature of the field, and because Ghana has yet to pass regulations to back open competitive tendering.

A new petroleum law requires that oil contracts should be awarded through open and competitive tender. It also allows direct negotiation when necessary and justifiable.

Exxon Mobil signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Ghana in 2015 to assess its Deepwater Cape Three Point (DCTP) region, 150 km (100 miles) off the coast with water depth ranging between 2,000 and 4,000 metres (6,500 and 13,000 feet).

The government said two firms had separately opted not to seek to explore the field because of its depth and high risk levels.

Adam said the government considered the ExxonMobil bid important, given the firm's experience and capability in deepwater operations. "Ultra-deepwater exploration is beyond the reach of current technology and we believe operators with strong research and development capability such as ExxonMobil are needed to unlock the potentials," Adam said.

The DCTP interest is the second attempt by Exxon Mobil to acquire oil assets in Ghana after the government blocked its 2009 bid to take over Kosmos' stake in the flagship Jubilee field.

Ghana, which also produces cocoa and gold, expects to ramp up oil production to around 250,000 barrels per day by 2019 from four oil fields including Jubilee whose current combined average annual output is around 100,000 bpd.

Med Crude-Urals up in Baltic on demand for December volumes - 路透新闻

{{20171113T172910.429+0000}}Med Crude-Urals up in Baltic on demand for December volumesMOSCOW, Nov 13 (Reuters) -

* Urals crude differentials firmed against dated Brent in northwest Europe on Monday on demand for December volumes, though there were no loading dates for next month so far.

* In the Platts window BP bid for 100,000 tonnes loading from Baltic ports on Dec. 3-7 at dated Brent minus $0.90 a barrel, which was around 15 cents firmer than the recent estimates, but failed to find a seller.

* Traders said it was not easy to find a seller for December-loading cargo before the release of loading dates, which is expected over the course of the week.

* Urals December exports are expected to be even lower than in November due to higher runs on Russian refineries.

* In the Mediterranean Litasco offered 140,000 tonnes of Urals loading from Novorossiisk on Nov. 23-27 at dated Brent minus $0.40 a barrel, but failed to find a buyer and withdrew the offer.

* Traders said demand for 140,000-tonne cargoes in the Mediterranean was rather poor due to limited arbitrage possibilities to Asia.

* Premiums for CPC Blend against dated Brent remained stable despite ample supply expected for December.

* In the Platts window OMV bid for 85,000 tonnes of CPC Blend loading on Nov. 29 - Dec. 2 at a premium of $0.25 a barrel, while Trafigura offered a cargo of the same size loading on Dec. 4-8 at dated Brent plus $0.40 a barrel, traders said.

* Bids and offers were in line with the latest grade's estimates, but no deal was done.

* There were no bids of offers for Azeri BTC or Siberian Light in the Platts window, traders said.

UPDATE 1-Kashagan development delayed again over new output glitches - Reuters News

{{20171113T164506.161+0000}}UPDATE 1-Kashagan development delayed again over new output glitches(Adds more details)

MOSCOW, Nov 13 (Reuters) - Kazakhstan's giant Kashagan oilfield will reach its planned capacity of 370,000 barrels per day later than anticipated, its developer, the North Caspian Operating Company (NCOC), said on Monday.

"I expect that we will need year 2018 to fully accomplish this (370,000 bpd) capacity, and we will study options to accelerate this timing," NCOC managing director Bruno Jardin said in a statement on Monday.

In October, Kashagan's output fell to 182,000 barrels per day (23,000 tonnes per day) from 200,000 barrels per day in September, its highest monthly output figure, sources said.

It was the first biggest fall in production since May this year and comes at time when NCOC delayed plans to ramp up output to 370,000 bpd from the end of 2017. [nL8N1N74OD]

"Production is not really stable. It's difficult to forecast anything," a source close to one of Kashagan consortium shareholders said.

The main problem revolves around gas re-injection.

"... with the start of gas re-injection in August this year we have learned a great deal about how the reservoir reacts. Pressure decline, and hence production increase, is going to be more gradual than we originally anticipated," Bruno said.

Kashagan's output will only rise above 200,000 barrels per day if gas re-injection goes well, industry sources familiar with the oilfield development said.

All associated natural gas produced at Kashagan along with crude oil has to be utilised and should not be flared up for environmental and technical reasons. Gas produced has a high mercaptan content, which makes it pungent-smelling.

"If they don't find a way to utilise the gas Kashagan will face the gas glut," an industry source said.

Kashagan tentatively launched production in September 2013, but was forced to suspend it due to gas leaks blamed on faulty pipes. Production was restarted again last year.

The early development was fraught with delays and cost overruns that have brought total spending on the project to about $55 billion.

The Kashagan consortium includes Kazakh state oil firm KazMunayGaz , Eni , ExxonMobil , Royal Dutch Shell , Total , China's CNPC [CNPET.UL] and Japan's Inpex <1605.T>.

Pakistan expects no more big firms to exit LNG projects -minister - Reuters News

{{20171113T073000.210+0000}}Pakistan expects no more big firms to exit LNG projects -ministerABU DHABI, Nov 13 (Reuters) - The oil market is rebalancing at an accelerating pace, as global levels of oil inventories have fallen visibly and demand for oil is roubust, OPEC Secretary-General Mohammad Barkindo said on Monday.

Speaking at an energy industry conference, Barkindo said he was confident that both the oil industry and the global economy were benefitting from the deal to cut output among major producers.

ABU DHABI, Nov 13 (Reuters) - Pakistan does not anticipate any more major companies will pull out of the liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects after the exit of Exxon Mobil , a state minister said on the sidelines of an Abu Dhabi energy conference.

"The reason for that consortium to pull out can be within their own financial aspects that would be their own decision," said Jam Kamal Khan, the country's minister of state for petroleum.

"We don't expect any more to pull out in fact investments are increasing."

Exxon Mobil has pulled out of a major project in Pakistan, in a potential blow to plans to boost imports of LNG after years of winter shortages.

Differences among the six-member group behind the project in Port Qasim in Karachi mean other companies may also quit and join a rival scheme, Reuters reported last month, citing government officials and industry sources. [nL8N1N546H]

Governo estima arrecadar R$3 bi com rodada do pré-sal em 2018, dizem fontes - Reuters (Portuguese, Brazil)

{{20171110T183227.133+0000}}Governo estima arrecadar R$3 bi com rodada do pré-sal em 2018, dizem fontesPor Rodrigo Viga Gaier

RIO DE JANEIRO, 10 Nov (Reuters) - A União estima arrecadar no ano que vem aproximadamente 3 bilhões de reais com a 4ª rodada de licitação de áreas exploratórias de petróleo e gás do pré-sal, cujos blocos foram definidos nesta semana em reunião do Conselho Nacional de Política Energética (CNPE), disseram duas fontes do governo à Reuters nesta sexta-feira.

Nas rodadas do pré-sal, que seguem o regime de partilha de produção, o governo arrecada dinheiro com um pagamento quase que imediato do bônus de assinatura do leilão e também com o óleo lucro, pago quando as áreas começam a produzir.

Com os dois leilões do pré-sal de 2017, a União levou 6,15 bilhões de reais, recursos que estão ajudando o governo a evitar um maior déficit nas suas contas.[nL2N1N21PZ]

Segundo as fontes, que falaram na condição de anonimato, o governo estima arrecadação semelhante à registrada na 2ª e 3ª rodadas realizadas ao final de outubro.

O bônus de assinatura das áreas da 4ª rodada será divulgado possivelmente na semana que vem, segundo as fontes. O assunto já foi encaminhado para o Ministério da Casa Civil, que deve publicar os detalhes do certame nos próximos dias.

"Achamos que já na semana que vem a Casa Civil libera isso para o Diário Oficial, mas o que posso adiantar é que a ordem de grandeza da 4ª rodada será a mesma das rodadas do pré-sal deste ano", disse uma das fontes.

Em cada uma das rodadas do pré-sal deste ano, o governo ofertou quatro áreas, enquanto na licitação do ano que vem, marcada para junho, foram definidos cinco blocos: Três Marias, Dois Irmãos, Uirapuru, Saturno e Itaimbezinho, nas Bacias de Santos e Campos.[nL2N1N21HY][nL1N1NF187]

"A ordem de grandeza, a estimativa é que seja aí na casa dos 3 bilhões, e os números dos leilões deste ano são uma referência, e não vai ser muito diferente disso...", adicionou a fonte.

O percentual de óleo lucro oferecido ao governo --que define os ganhadores nas licitações do pré-sal-- também deve ser semelhante na licitação de 2018 ao registrado nas rodadas de 2017, que chegaram a até 80 por cento em um dos blocos, segundo a expectativa das fontes.

A partir da divulgação do valor de bônus para as cinco áreas da 4ª rodada do pré-sal, a Petrobras terá 30 dias para manifestar o direito de preferência pelas áreas selecionadas para o certame.

De acordo com uma das fontes, o governo não pretende colocar um bônus de assinatura muito elevado, na casa de dois dígitos, para manter a atratividade do certame e não afastar potenciais interessados.

Uma terceira fonte, da área econômica do governo, disse à Reuters que o orçamento de 2018 não previu receitas oriundas dos leilões. A peça orçamentária foi enviada ao Congresso antes da reunião do CNPE.

Mas, de acordo com a fonte, "recursos novos" são bem-vindos.

As receitas do governo oriundas de leilões de áreas de petróleo podem aumentar ainda mais com a realização da 15ª rodada de blocos no regime de concessão, marcada para o março de 2018.

A 14ª rodada, realizada em setembro deste ano, sob regime de concessão, arrecadou em bônus 3,84 bilhões de reais, com 95 por cento desse montante sendo arrecadado em lances por blocos na Bacia de Campos, feitos por Petrobras e pela norte-americana Exxon Mobil, que voltou a realizar grandes investimentos no Brasil.[nL2N1M81MP]

Med Crude-Urals diffs unchanged, Azeri BTC and CPC Blend slip - 路透新闻

{{20171110T172408.689+0000}}Med Crude-Urals diffs unchanged, Azeri BTC and CPC Blend slipMOSCOW, Nov 10 (Reuters) - Urals crude differentials to dated Brent in northwest Europe and Mediterranean were stable on Friday in quiet trade, while Azeri BTC and CPC Blend assessments eased on ample exports of Caspian grades in December.

CPC Blend provisional loading plan for December showed exports rising by 11 percent on a daily basis to an all-time high, while Azeri BTC exports will stay roughly flat month-on-month.

The CPC pipeline consortium plans to increase its shipments of oil from the Black Sea to 5.36 million tonnes in December from the 4.69 million tonnes planned for November, a preliminary schedule showed on Friday. [nL8N1NG2ZC]

There were no bids and offers for Urals in the Platts window on Friday.

Oil loadings from the Baltic Sea port of Primorsk have been interrupted by a storm, Russian oil pipeline monopoly Transneft said on Friday. [nR4N1N702C]

In lighter grades, Vitol sold to Trafigura 85,000 tonnes of CPC Blend for Dec. 1-5 loading at dated Brent plus $0.30 a barrel, down by $0.15 from Thursday assessments.

Trafigura also bid for 85,000-tonne parcels of the grade for Nov. 26-30 and Dec. 1-5 up to plus $0.15 and $0.05 a barrel respectively before withdrawing.

OMV bid for 85.000 tonnes of CPC Blend for Nov. 27-Dec. 1 up to a premium of $0.40 a barrel, but found no seller, traders said.

SOCAR offered 85,000 tonnes of Azeri BTC for Nov. 30-Dec. 4 and 135,000 tonnes of the grade for Dec. 2-6 down to a premium of $1.90 and $1.70 a barrel respectively, but nobody was interested.

{{20171109T222152.796+0000}}UPDATE 1-Exxon Baton Rouge large CDU may return to production next week -sources(Adds company no-comment, details on units, outage)

HOUSTON, Nov 9 (Reuters) - ExxonMobil Corp may return the large crude distillation unit (CDU) and a coker at its 502,500 barrel-per-day (bpd) Baton Rouge, Louisiana, refinery by the middle of next week, sources familiar with plant operations said on Thursday.

Exxon spokeswoman Megan Manchester declined comment.

The 210,000 bpd CDU was taken out of production after a fire heavily damaged the 75,000-bpd reformer on Nov. 1, the sources said. The 32,000 bpd coking unit was shut on Tuesday.

The CDU is the largest of four at the refinery. CDUs do the primary refining of crude oil and provide hydrocarbon feedstock for all other units.

The coker was shut in preparation for the CDU's restart. There are three cokers at the refinery that convert residual crude oil from distillation units into either feedstock for motor fuels or petroleum coke, a substitute for coal.

The reformer was heavily damaged in the fire and remains shut, the sources said.

BREAKINGVIEWS-Even China can't thaw Alaska's LNG ice age - Reuters Breakingviews

{{20171109T175233.073+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-Even China can't thaw Alaska's LNG ice age(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are her own.)

By Lauren Silva Laughlin

DALLAS, Nov 9 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Alaska's liquefied natural gas projects are in an ice age that even China's riches won't thaw. The U.S. state has been trying to tap its considerable resource since the 1970s. Exxon Mobil and BP walked away from projects last year because the costly endeavor doesn't compute at current prices. China's cheap debt and need for gas alter the equation, but other energy sources still look better than the Last Frontier.

While Alaska's lands are resource-rich, they're so remote that infrastructure is hard to build. The Prudhoe Bay region has produced some 17 billion barrels of oil since its discovery, according to the Resource Development Council of Alaska. But much of what was pulled out has been pumped back in because it has nowhere to go.

China, seizing the moment of President Donald Trump's trip to Beijing, is now offering to invest in the project which requires new plants along with 800 miles of pipe. It is undeterred by a report by Wood Mackenzie, a consultant for the oil majors, which last year said oil prices would have to be above $70 a barrel before an investor could ink the kind of 12 percent return most global oil producers target.

A few things are different for the People's Republic. Even though oil is still below $70, Chinese state oil companies like Sinopec have access to cheap debt, and might accept a lower return in exchange for securing a patch of liquefied natural gas. China's shift from coal means that gas demand is set to rise 8.7 percent per year through 2022, according to the International Energy Agency.

The risk, though, is on the western side of the Bering Strait. Thursday's tie-up is fuzzily worded, non-binding and sidesteps questions like who pays what, when. And there are other places to get supply – like Qatar, Australia, other parts of the United States and even China itself. The country will by 2040 be the second-largest shale gas producer in the world behind the United States, says the Energy Information Administration. Alaska's LNG is likely to end up on ice.

CONTEXT NEWS

- The state of Alaska signed a joint development agreement with China Petrochemical, CIC [CIC.UL] and the Bank of China <601988.SS> to develop the state's liquefied natural gas resources.

- The agreement, signed in the presence of U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, would include several processing plants and an 800-mile pipeline.

- BP and Exxon walked away from the project last year after Wood Mackenzie, a consultant to the firms, said the project would produce 12 percent returns only if oil prices hit $70 a barrel.

After years of famine, oil dividends back on menu - Reuters News

{{20171109T152224.430+0000}}After years of famine, oil dividends back on menu(Fixes last bullet point to say .. majors' ..not.. major's)

* Pressure on Shell to remove scrip this month

* BP first to revive share buybacks

* Majors seek to show they can make profit in low oil prices

* Oil majors' dividends: http://tmsnrt.rs/2zoJmnF

By Ron Bousso

LONDON, Nov 9 (Reuters) - The world's top oil and gas companies are under growing pressure to revive share and dividend rewards to investors as profits and oil prices get back on track after a three-year crunch.

BP fired the opening shot last week by surprising the market with the resumption of share buybacks after diluting share value for three years through scrip dividends, where investors can opt to receive dividends in shares or cash.[nL8N1N61IG]

The pressure is now on Royal Dutch Shell to make good on commitments made in 2015, following the decision to acquire BG Group for $54 billion, to remove scrip in 2017 and launch a $25 billion share buyback programme from 2017 to 2020.

"There is a competition to see who can first remove the scrip, resume the buyback and then maybe, how much can you buy back and compensate for years of share dilution," said Jags Walia, asset manager at Dutch pension fund APG, which holds shares in Shell and BP.

"I'd like to see them (Shell) announce the turning off of scrip, start talking about the $25 billion buyback - it has been a while since they spoke about that."

Shell did not provide an update on its plans with its third-quarter results, which showed the company generated sufficient cash to cover dividends for the fifth straight quarter, outdoing its larger rival Exxon Mobil . [nL8N1N81KV]

Chief Financial Officer Jessica Uhl said in a call last week that Shell's priorities remain to reduce debt, pay dividends and turn off scrip before turning to share repurchases.

Changing the dividend policy will have a significant impact on Shell's balance sheet even with cashflow soaring to $28 billion in the first nine months. Dividend payouts for the Anglo-Dutch company in the 12 months to September amounted to $15 billion, with scrip accounting for around a quarter.

Shell is not the only one at a crossroads.

Norway's Statoil confirmed in October it would revert to full cash dividends from the fourth quarter, after ending a two-year scrip dividend programme.[nL8N1N10QO]

France's Total said it will scrap the discount offered for scrip shares in 2018.

ADJUSTING TO LOWER PRICES

Shares of oil companies went through a roller coaster in recent years, tracking the collapse of oil prices in 2014 from over $100 a barrel to as low as $28 a barrel.

Deep cost savings, job cuts, asset sales and the recovery in oil prices to above $64 a barrel this month have all helped boost profits and shares back to levels similar to 2014.

With the Shell's $30 billion asset disposal programme on track to be completed almost a year ahead of schedule and debt trending towards around 20 percent, removing scrip will be in focus at its investor day at the end of the month.

"The pressure is on Shell to draw a line in the sand and commit to end scrip dividend," said Brendan Warn, analyst at BMO Capital Markets.

Removing scrip, effectively used to preserve cash in hard times, will send the clearest message yet that Shell, as well as other companies, have adapted to a world of lower prices, Warn said.

Dividends are a major burden on oil majors' balance sheets, amounting to more than $47 billion in 2017.

But none, bar Italy's Eni cut levels throughout the three-year downturn. Shell has repeatedly boasted that it hasn't reduced dividends since the Second World War.

Scrip and suspending buybacks were still vital for many companies to survive at crude prices of around $50 a barrel in 2017.

HSBC estimates that BP's operations will fully cover $8 billion of dividend payments as well as $16 billion in spending at $59 a barrel this year, going down to $53 a barrel in 2018 when excluding payments for the 2010 Deepwater Horizon spill.

For Shell, scrip has helped reduce the breakeven price in 2017 from $55 a barrel to $50 a barrel, according to HSBC.

Exxon slowed down last year its massive share repurchase programme as earnings dropped. It nevertheless kept with its 35-year-old tradition of raising dividends.

Chevron held off on a dividend raise for the fourth quarter due to market uncertainty, but in July it said such a move would be its first use of cash.

UPDATE 2-Exxon Baton Rouge refinery CDU, coker may restart next week -sources - 路透新闻

{{20171108T192036.640+0000}}UPDATE 2-Exxon Baton Rouge refinery CDU, coker may restart next week -sources(Adds company no comment)

HOUSTON, Nov 8 (Reuters) - ExxonMobil Corp plans to restart the 210,000 barrel-per-day (bpd) crude distillation unit (CDU) at its 502,500 bpd Baton Rouge, Louisiana, refinery early next week, sources familiar with plant operations said on Wednesday.

A 32,000 bpd coking unit at the refinery, shut on Tuesday, may restart over the weekend, the sources said.

Exxon spokeswoman Megan Manchester declined comment on Wednesday.

The CDU was taken out of production after a fire heavily damaged the 75,000-bpd reformer on Nov. 1, the sources said. The unit is the largest of four at the refinery that do the primary refining of crude oil and provide hydrocarbon feedstock for all other units.

The crude unit was to be brought back on-line later on Nov. 1, but instead was kept down for planned work.

The coker shutdown was also planned, the sources said. Cokers convert residual crude oil into either feedstock for motor fuels or petroleum coke, a substitute for coal.

The reformer remains shut at the refinery.

RPT-INSIGHT-Peak oil? Majors aren't buying into the threat from renewables - Reuters News

{{20171108T120002.956+0000}}RPT-INSIGHT-Peak oil? Majors aren't buying into the threat from renewables(Repeats for additional clients with no changes to text)

By Ernest Scheyder and Ron Bousso

HOUSTON/LONDON, Nov 8 (Reuters) - Two decades ago, BP set out to transcend oil, adopting a sunburst logo to convey its plans to pour $8 billion over a decade into renewable technologies, even promising to power its gas stations with the sun.

That transformation - marketed as "Beyond Petroleum" - led to manufacturing solar panels in Australia, Spain and the United States and erecting wind farms in the United States and the Netherlands.

Today, BP might be more aptly branded "Back to Petroleum" after exiting or scaling back its renewable energy investments. Lower-cost Chinese components upended its solar panel business, which the firm shed in 2011. A year later, BP tried to sell its U.S. wind power business but couldn't get a buyer.

"We made very big bets in the past," BP Chief Executive Bob Dudley told Reuters in an interview. "A lot of those didn't work. We're not sure yet what will be commercially acceptable."

The costly lesson of the biggest foray yet by an oil major into renewable energy was not lost on rival firms.

Even as governments and environmentalists forecast a peak in oil demand within a generation - and China and India say they may eventually ban gasoline and diesel vehicles - leaders of the world's biggest oil firms are not buying the argument that their traditional business faces any imminent threat.

A Reuters analysis of clean energy investments and forecasts by oil majors, along with exclusive interviews with top oil executives, reveal mostly token investments in alternative energy. Today, renewable power projects get about 3 percent of $100 billion in combined annual spending by the five biggest oil firms, according to energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie.

BP, Chevron , Exxon Mobil , Royal Dutch Shell and Total are instead milking their drilling and processing assets to finance investor payouts now and bolster balance sheets for the future. They believe they can enter new energy sectors later by acquiring companies or technologies if and when others prove them profitable.

"There is no sign of peak demand right now," said Chevron CEO John Watson, an economist by training, who is retiring in early 2018. "For the next 10 or 20 years, we expect to see oil demand growth."

The International Energy Agency forecasts a 10 percent rise in oil demand through 2040, reflecting the consensus among oil firms. The earliest estimate for peak oil demand from any oil company is late next decade, by Shell CEO Ben van Beurden.

History shows energy transitions - from wood to coal to oil - take a long time. Coal's contribution to world energy consumption peaked recently at 28 percent and remains above the share from natural gas, though just below oil's one-third.

Profit, if any, from the majors' decades-long interest in renewable energy ventures is unclear. None of the largest oil companies disclose earnings from their solar, wind or biofuels ventures.

Investors such as Alasdair McKinnon, portfolio manager at Scottish Investment Trust, believe oil will sustain shareholders far into the future.

"There isn't a viable alternative to fossil fuels on the horizon," he said. "We're not buying into the long-term demand destruction for oil."

The confidence in oil's future relies largely on rising consumption from emerging economies. Exxon forecasts that transportation will require 25 percent more fuel by 2040, propelled by growth in Asia. Chevron's analysis of the India and Nigeria markets, meanwhile, concludes that infrastructure needed for electric cars is unlikely to be built.

Cars account for about a fifth of oil consumption, BP estimates. So if electric vehicles do eventually capture mass markets, oil firms would still expect growing demand from the air, rail and trucking industries.

Natural gas - now a smaller business than oil for most majors - can grow to nearly a quarter of all energy used by displacing coal in power generation and through expanded uses in chemicals, these companies forecast. Natural gas can also fuel the power needed for electric cars.

Although Shell forecasts peak oil demand coming earlier than its rivals, it is preparing for that prospect mostly with massive natural gas investments. The firm last year spent $54 billion acquiring BG Group, which derives half its production from gas. Chevron, Exxon and Shell recently have spent billions of dollars on new liquefied natural gas projects across the globe.

Exxon declined to comment for this article.

SHORT-SIGHTED STRATEGY?

Critics of oil majors' cautious renewable strategy - including some big investors - say the firms are being short-sighted in their trust that change will come slow, or that one fossil fuel will gradually replace another. Just as cheap natural gas is supplanting coal, even cheaper wind or solar eventually will displace gas, they argue.

South Australia is soon to become a proving ground for a project could pave the way for renewable power to supplant fossil fuels for peak electricity - a combined wind farm and grid-scale battery storage facility, by electric-car maker Tesla Inc and operator Windlab Ltd.

Fossil fuel companies need to quickly reorient themselves to the low returns of the solar and wind industries, said Jules Kortenhorst, a former Shell executive who runs the Rocky Mountain Institute, a nonprofit energy research organization.

"You cannot flip a switch on a Monday morning from being one to another," he said. "Paychecks in the oil and gas industry are based on fundamentally believing that the world cannot see economic growth without fossil fuels."

To achieve the same share of the renewables market that the largest publicly-traded oil companies now hold in oil and gas would require an investment of about $350 billion over the next 18 years, estimates Wood Mackenzie. Such spending would cut into the generous dividends that oil firms' shareholders have come to expect.

"We think it will be a real challenge for these companies to change their business model," said Nathan Fabian, director of policy at Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI), a United Nations-backed group.

PRI has guidelines calling for investment analysis that weighs environmental, social and governance issues. Its principles have been adopted by investors with $70 trillion in assets under management.

SMALL SCALE RENEWABLES INVESTMENTS

Oil companies have made relatively modest investments a wide range of renewable technologies. Chevron has a smattering of mostly small wind and solar ventures; Shell invests in sugar-cane ethanol in South America, wind farms in the United States and electric-car charging stations in Europe; and BP still owns the U.S. wind farms it once tried to sell.

John Browne - who as BP's CEO two decades ago helped launch the early investments in renewables - said he still believes the renewable power will grow.

"It will take time," he said in an interview with Reuters last month. "And they have time."

Shell pledged to invest up to $1 billion a year by 2020 in what it calls "new energies."

Total said this year it would spend $500 million annually on developing alternatives. But soon after that announcement, it unveiled its $7.5 billion acquisition of Maersk Oil, part of a plan to pump more crude from Norway's North Sea.

Total CEO Patrick Pouyanne in October explained the focus on economics at an October oil conference in London.

"When you ask our customers what their priority is, either in developed economies or in emerging countries, price comes first," he said. A hasty shift to renewables, he said, "could bring great economic and social damage to our 6 billion customers."

Exxon Mobil is backing research into biofuels, joining with gene modification firm Synthetic Genomics to coax algae to produce more lipids, an oil substitute. It hasn't detailed its investment but said the effort remains far from commercialization. By comparison, Exxon this year spent $5.6 billion on U.S. shale oil assets.

BATTERY-POWERED CARS, PLANES

Some of the oil industry's largest customers are planning a shift to renewable alternatives, especially in transportation, which accounts for about a quarter of annual energy consumption.

Ford Motor Co earlier this fall disclosed it would aim, by 2030, to derive a third of its sales from battery-powered cars and another third from gas-electric hybrids. [nL4N1ME3GX]

A startup backed by Boeing Co and JetBlue Airways Corp recently announced plans for a small hybrid jet by 2022, using batteries from Tesla and battery supplier Panasonic Corp <6752.T>. [nL2N1MG1HZ]

Yet oil firms continue to forecast aggressive growth in liquid fuels. Exxon predicts 90 percent of the transportation industry will rely on petroleum through 2040.

BP projects the world's auto fleet doubling to 1.8 billion vehicles by 2035, with only 75 million of those powered by electricity.

"We'll see if (electric cars) can be delivered in a way that doesn't require large subsidies" from governments, Chevron's Watson told Reuters. "That's what we're seeing now."

Chevron's analysis of the India and Nigeria markets, meanwhile, concludes that infrastructure needed for electric cars is unlikely to be built.

Cars account for about a fifth of oil consumption, BP estimates. So if electric vehicles do eventually capture mass markets, oil firms would still expect growing demand from the air, rail and trucking industries.

Natural gas - now a smaller business than oil for most majors - can grow to nearly a quarter of all energy used by displacing coal in power generation and through expanded uses in chemicals, these companies forecast. Natural gas can also fuel the power needed for electric cars.

Although Shell forecasts peak oil demand coming earlier than its rivals, it is preparing for that prospect mostly with massive natural gas investments. The firm last year spent $54 billion acquiring BG Group, which derives half its production from gas. Chevron, Exxon and Shell recently have spent billions of dollars on new liquefied natural gas projects across the globe.

Exxon declined to comment for this article.

SHORT-SIGHTED STRATEGY?

Critics of oil majors' cautious renewable strategy - including some big investors - say the firms are being short-sighted in their trust that change will come slow, or that one fossil fuel will gradually replace another. Just as cheap natural gas is supplanting coal, even cheaper wind or solar eventually will displace gas, they argue.

South Australia is soon to become a proving ground for a project could pave the way for renewable power to supplant fossil fuels for peak electricity - a combined wind farm and grid-scale battery storage facility, by electric-car maker Tesla Inc and operator Windlab Ltd.

Fossil fuel companies need to quickly reorient themselves to the low returns of the solar and wind industries, said Jules Kortenhorst, a former Shell executive who runs the Rocky Mountain Institute, a nonprofit energy research organization.

"You cannot flip a switch on a Monday morning from being one to another," he said. "Paychecks in the oil and gas industry are based on fundamentally believing that the world cannot see economic growth without fossil fuels."

To achieve the same share of the renewables market that the largest publicly-traded oil companies now hold in oil and gas would require an investment of about $350 billion over the next 18 years, estimates consultancy Wood Mackenzie. Such spending would cut into the generous dividends that oil firms' shareholders have come to expect.

"We think it will be a real challenge for these companies to change their business model," said Nathan Fabian, director of policy at Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI), a United Nations-backed group.

PRI has guidelines calling for investment analysis that weighs environmental, social and governance issues. Its principles have been adopted by investors with $70 trillion in assets under management.

SMALL SCALE RENEWABLES INVESTMENTS

Oil companies have made relatively modest investments a wide range of renewable technologies. Chevron has a smattering of mostly small wind and solar ventures; Shell invests in sugar-cane ethanol in South America, wind farms in the United States and electric-car charging stations in Europe; and BP still owns the U.S. wind farms it once tried to sell.

John Browne - who as BP's CEO two decades ago helped launch the early investments in renewables - said he still believes the renewable power will grow.

"It will take time," he said in an interview with Reuters last month. "And they have time."

Shell pledged to invest up to $1 billion a year by 2020 in what it calls "new energies."

Total said this year it would spend $500 million annually on developing alternatives. But soon after that announcement, it unveiled its $7.5 billion acquisition of Maersk Oil, part of a plan to pump more crude from Norway's North Sea.

Total CEO Patrick Pouyanne in October explained the focus on economics at an October oil conference in London.

"When you ask our customers what their priority is, either in developed economies or in emerging countries, price comes first," he said. A hasty shift to renewables, he said, "could bring great economic and social damage to our 6 billion customers."

Exxon Mobil is backing research into biofuels, joining with gene modification firm Synthetic Genomics to coax algae to produce more lipids, an oil substitute. It hasn't detailed its investment but said the effort remains far from commercialization. By comparison, Exxon this year spent $5.6 billion on U.S. shale oil assets.

BATTERY-POWERED CARS, PLANES

Some of the oil industry's largest customers are planning a shift to renewable alternatives, especially in transportation, which accounts for about a quarter of annual energy consumption.

A startup backed by Boeing Co and JetBlue Airways Corp recently announced plans for a small hybrid jet by 2022, using batteries from Tesla and battery supplier Panasonic Corp <6752.T>. [nL2N1MG1HZ]

Yet oil firms continue to forecast aggressive growth in liquid fuels. Exxon predicts 90 percent of the transportation industry will rely on petroleum through 2040.

BP projects the world's auto fleet doubling to 1.8 billion vehicles by 2035, with only 75 million of those powered by electricity.

"We'll see if (electric cars) can be delivered in a way that doesn't require large subsidies" from governments, Chevron's Watson told Reuters. "That's what we're seeing now."

INSIGHT-Peak oil? Majors aren't buying into the threat from renewables - 路透新闻

{{20171108T060000.000+0000}}INSIGHT-Peak oil? Majors aren't buying into the threat from renewablesHOUSTON/LONDON, Nov 8 (Reuters)

By Ernest Scheyder and Ron Bousso

HOUSTON/LONDON, Nov 8 (Reuters) - Two decades ago, BP set out to transcend oil, adopting a sunburst logo to convey its plans to pour $8 billion over a decade into renewable technologies, even promising to power its gas stations with the sun.

That transformation - marketed as "Beyond Petroleum" - led to manufacturing solar panels in Australia, Spain and the United States and erecting wind farms in the United States and the Netherlands.

Today, BP might be more aptly branded "Back to Petroleum" after exiting or scaling back its renewable energy investments. Lower-cost Chinese components upended its solar panel business, which the firm shed in 2011. A year later, BP tried to sell its U.S. wind power business but couldn't get a buyer.

"We made very big bets in the past," BP Chief Executive Bob Dudley told Reuters in an interview. "A lot of those didn't work. We're not sure yet what will be commercially acceptable."

The costly lesson of the biggest foray yet by an oil major into renewable energy was not lost on rival firms.

Even as governments and environmentalists forecast a peak in oil demand within a generation - and China and India say they may eventually ban gasoline and diesel vehicles - leaders of the world's biggest oil firms are not buying the argument that their traditional business faces any imminent threat.

A Reuters analysis of clean energy investments and forecasts by oil majors, along with exclusive interviews with top oil executives, reveal mostly token investments in alternative energy. Today, renewable power projects get about 3 percent of $100 billion in combined annual spending by the five biggest oil firms, according to energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie.

BP, Chevron , Exxon Mobil , Royal Dutch Shell and Total are instead milking their drilling and processing assets to finance investor payouts now and bolster balance sheets for the future. They believe they can enter new energy sectors later by acquiring companies or technologies if and when others prove them profitable.

"There is no sign of peak demand right now," said Chevron CEO John Watson, an economist by training, who is retiring in early 2018. "For the next 10 or 20 years, we expect to see oil demand growth."

For a graphic showing BP's fossil fuel and renewable energy forecasts, see: http://tmsnrt.rs/2h4vGHd

The International Energy Agency forecasts a 10 percent rise in oil demand through 2040, reflecting the consensus among oil firms. The earliest estimate for peak oil demand from any oil company is late next decade, by Shell CEO Ben van Beurden.

History shows energy transitions - from wood to coal to oil - take a long time. Coal's contribution to world energy consumption peaked recently at 28 percent and remains above the share from natural gas, though just below oil's one-third.

Profit, if any, from the majors' decades-long interest in renewable energy ventures is unclear. None of the largest oil companies disclose earnings from their solar, wind or biofuels ventures.

Investors such as Alasdair McKinnon, portfolio manager at Scottish Investment Trust, believe oil will sustain shareholders far into the future.

"There isn't a viable alternative to fossil fuels on the horizon," he said. "We're not buying into the long-term demand destruction for oil."

The confidence in oil's future relies largely on rising consumption from emerging economies. Exxon forecasts that transportation will require 25 percent more fuel by 2040, propelled by growth in Asia. Chevron's analysis of the India and Nigeria markets, meanwhile, concludes that infrastructure needed for electric cars is unlikely to be built.

RPT-INSIGHT-Peak oil? Majors aren't buying into the threat from renewables - 路透新闻

{{20171108T000000.000+0000}}RPT-INSIGHT-Peak oil? Majors aren't buying into the threat from renewablesHOUSTON/LONDON, Nov 8 (Reuters)

(Repeats for additional clients with no changes to text)

By Ernest Scheyder and Ron Bousso

HOUSTON/LONDON, Nov 8 (Reuters) - Two decades ago, BP set out to transcend oil, adopting a sunburst logo to convey its plans to pour $8 billion over a decade into renewable technologies, even promising to power its gas stations with the sun.

That transformation - marketed as "Beyond Petroleum" - led to manufacturing solar panels in Australia, Spain and the United States and erecting wind farms in the United States and the Netherlands.

Today, BP might be more aptly branded "Back to Petroleum" after exiting or scaling back its renewable energy investments. Lower-cost Chinese components upended its solar panel business, which the firm shed in 2011. A year later, BP tried to sell its U.S. wind power business but couldn't get a buyer.

"We made very big bets in the past," BP Chief Executive Bob Dudley told Reuters in an interview. "A lot of those didn't work. We're not sure yet what will be commercially acceptable."

The costly lesson of the biggest foray yet by an oil major into renewable energy was not lost on rival firms.

Even as governments and environmentalists forecast a peak in oil demand within a generation - and China and India say they may eventually ban gasoline and diesel vehicles - leaders of the world's biggest oil firms are not buying the argument that their traditional business faces any imminent threat.

A Reuters analysis of clean energy investments and forecasts by oil majors, along with exclusive interviews with top oil executives, reveal mostly token investments in alternative energy. Today, renewable power projects get about 3 percent of $100 billion in combined annual spending by the five biggest oil firms, according to energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie.

BP, Chevron , Exxon Mobil , Royal Dutch Shell and Total are instead milking their drilling and processing assets to finance investor payouts now and bolster balance sheets for the future. They believe they can enter new energy sectors later by acquiring companies or technologies if and when others prove them profitable.

"There is no sign of peak demand right now," said Chevron CEO John Watson, an economist by training, who is retiring in early 2018. "For the next 10 or 20 years, we expect to see oil demand growth."

The International Energy Agency forecasts a 10 percent rise in oil demand through 2040, reflecting the consensus among oil firms. The earliest estimate for peak oil demand from any oil company is late next decade, by Shell CEO Ben van Beurden.

History shows energy transitions - from wood to coal to oil - take a long time. Coal's contribution to world energy consumption peaked recently at 28 percent and remains above the share from natural gas, though just below oil's one-third.

Profit, if any, from the majors' decades-long interest in renewable energy ventures is unclear. None of the largest oil companies disclose earnings from their solar, wind or biofuels ventures.

Investors such as Alasdair McKinnon, portfolio manager at Scottish Investment Trust, believe oil will sustain shareholders far into the future.

"There isn't a viable alternative to fossil fuels on the horizon," he said. "We're not buying into the long-term demand destruction for oil."

The confidence in oil's future relies largely on rising consumption from emerging economies. Exxon forecasts that transportation will require 25 percent more fuel by 2040, propelled by growth in Asia. Chevron's analysis of the India and Nigeria markets, meanwhile, concludes that infrastructure needed for electric cars is unlikely to be built.

Cars account for about a fifth of oil consumption, BP estimates. So if electric vehicles do eventually capture mass markets, oil firms would still expect growing demand from the air, rail and trucking industries.

Natural gas - now a smaller business than oil for most majors - can grow to nearly a quarter of all energy used by displacing coal in power generation and through expanded uses in chemicals, these companies forecast. Natural gas can also fuel the power needed for electric cars.

Although Shell forecasts peak oil demand coming earlier than its rivals, it is preparing for that prospect mostly with massive natural gas investments. The firm last year spent $54 billion acquiring BG Group, which derives half its production from gas. Chevron, Exxon and Shell recently have spent billions of dollars on new liquefied natural gas projects across the globe.

Exxon declined to comment for this article.

SHORT-SIGHTED STRATEGY?

Critics of oil majors' cautious renewable strategy - including some big investors - say the firms are being short-sighted in their trust that change will come slow, or that one fossil fuel will gradually replace another. Just as cheap natural gas is supplanting coal, even cheaper wind or solar eventually will displace gas, they argue.

South Australia is soon to become a proving ground for a project could pave the way for renewable power to supplant fossil fuels for peak electricity - a combined wind farm and grid-scale battery storage facility, by electric-car maker Tesla Inc and operator Windlab Ltd.

Fossil fuel companies need to quickly reorient themselves to the low returns of the solar and wind industries, said Jules Kortenhorst, a former Shell executive who runs the Rocky Mountain Institute, a nonprofit energy research organization.

"You cannot flip a switch on a Monday morning from being one to another," he said. "Paychecks in the oil and gas industry are based on fundamentally believing that the world cannot see economic growth without fossil fuels."

To achieve the same share of the renewables market that the largest publicly-traded oil companies now hold in oil and gas would require an investment of about $350 billion over the next 18 years, estimates Wood Mackenzie. Such spending would cut into the generous dividends that oil firms' shareholders have come to expect.

"We think it will be a real challenge for these companies to change their business model," said Nathan Fabian, director of policy at Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI), a United Nations-backed group.

PRI has guidelines calling for investment analysis that weighs environmental, social and governance issues. Its principles have been adopted by investors with $70 trillion in assets under management.

SMALL SCALE RENEWABLES INVESTMENTS

Oil companies have made relatively modest investments a wide range of renewable technologies. Chevron has a smattering of mostly small wind and solar ventures; Shell invests in sugar-cane ethanol in South America, wind farms in the United States and electric-car charging stations in Europe; and BP still owns the U.S. wind farms it once tried to sell.

John Browne - who as BP's CEO two decades ago helped launch the early investments in renewables - said he still believes the renewable power will grow.

"It will take time," he said in an interview with Reuters last month. "And they have time."

Shell pledged to invest up to $1 billion a year by 2020 in what it calls "new energies."

Total said this year it would spend $500 million annually on developing alternatives. But soon after that announcement, it unveiled its $7.5 billion acquisition of Maersk Oil, part of a plan to pump more crude from Norway's North Sea.

Total CEO Patrick Pouyanne in October explained the focus on economics at an October oil conference in London.

"When you ask our customers what their priority is, either in developed economies or in emerging countries, price comes first," he said. A hasty shift to renewables, he said, "could bring great economic and social damage to our 6 billion customers."

Exxon Mobil is backing research into biofuels, joining with gene modification firm Synthetic Genomics to coax algae to produce more lipids, an oil substitute. It hasn't detailed its investment but said the effort remains far from commercialization. By comparison, Exxon this year spent $5.6 billion on U.S. shale oil assets.

BATTERY-POWERED CARS, PLANES

Some of the oil industry's largest customers are planning a shift to renewable alternatives, especially in transportation, which accounts for about a quarter of annual energy consumption.

Oil at $70/barrel already a reality for some as Asian premium bites - Reuters News

{{20171107T095917.710+0000}}Oil at $70/barrel already a reality for some as Asian premium bites* Robust demand, limited supplies underpin spot premiums

* Malaysia Miri Light crude touches about $69/bbl

* Australia Barrow Island, Cooper Basin reach close to $70/bbl

By Florence Tan

SINGAPORE, Nov 7 (Reuters) - The rising demand for crude oil that can more easily produce transportation fuels when refined has some Australian and Malaysian producers boasting cargoes valued at close to $70 a barrel, a hefty premium to global benchmarks .

Malaysia's state oil company Petronas [PETR.UL] sold last week a December-loading Miri Light cargo at a premium of about $4.50 a barrel to dated Brent, equivalent to about $69 at the latest prices, according to multiple traders that participate in the Asian regional crude market.

Australian Barrow Island and Cooper Basin crudes are now close to $70 a barrel currently, based on premiums for grades of about $1.50 a barrel to Malaysian benchmark grade Kimanis, said the traders. Kimanis itself is priced at a premium of about $4.40 a barrel to dated Brent, which was assessed at $64.07 a barrel on Monday by price reporting agency S&P Global Platts.

"Prices of domestic Australian grades are even higher than MCO (Malaysian Crude Oil)," an Asian trader said. "That would make them the most expensive crudes in the world."

Demand for these grades is rising because of the short distances to Asian refineries, which prize the crude for their low sulphur content and higher yields of more valuable oil products such as diesel, the traders said.

Demand for short-haul grades has increased after the Brent oil market structure flipped into backwardation, when prompt prices are more than later prices. That means the value of the crude drops over the course of the voyage.

The refiners are willing to pay up for the Australian and Malaysian crudes rather than incur the additional time and cost of shipping Brent supplies from the North Sea, the traders said.

Typically, Asia-Pacific grades are sold to refineries in Southeast Asia and Australia or New Zealand that have a preference for low-sulphur oil.

Values for these grades have risen because of their scarcity.

Petronas and its partners Royal Dutch Shell , ConocoPhillips , Murphy Oil Corp , Pertamina [PERTM.UL] sell about 6 million barrels of Kimanis each month.

But volumes for other Malaysian grades such as Kikeh and Labuan have fallen as output declines at the mature fields.

Australia's crude and condensate production has been below 300,000 barrels per day (bpd) since September 2016, data from the country's Department of the Environment and Energy showed. In August it was 279,000 bpd.

Santos Ltd produces about 30,000 bpd of Cooper Basin crude in southern Australia, according to its website.

Santos and its partners, Chevron Corp and Mobil Australia Resources Co, a unit of Exxon Mobil Corp , produces 5,000 bpd of Barrow Island in western Australia, according to Santos.

Aramco oil reserves audit two-thirds complete, may not be finished in 2017 -sources - Reuters News

{{20171107T080001.051+0000}}Aramco oil reserves audit two-thirds complete, may not be finished in 2017 -sourcesBy Alex Lawler and Rania El Gamal

LONDON/DUBAI, Nov 7 (Reuters) - An audit of Saudi Aramco's [IPO-ARMO.SE] oil reserves is unlikely to be completed before the end of 2017 because of the huge scale of the task, sources familiar with the matter said, a later timeframe than previously indicated.

The audit has so far confirmed the reserves figures earlier given by Saudi Arabia, the sources said, an important part of the state oil company's preparatory work for its planned initial public offering next year.

Saudi Arabia's reserves of easily recoverable oil have long been considered the world's largest. But there have also been questions about their volume and quality, and the audit seeks to provide internationally recognised figures for investors.

"It's a huge task," a source familiar with the matter said, commenting on the progress of the reserves audit. "They are about two-thirds of the way through. It's all going well and smoothly - no surprises."

For nearly 30 years - despite rising production, large swings in oil prices and improved technology - Riyadh has annually reported the same number for reserves of 261 billion barrels, according to BP's statistical review.

Dallas-based DeGolyer and MacNaughton, and Gaffney, Cline and Associates, part of Baker Hughes , are involved in the auditing, sources have said. Baker Hughes declined to comment on the progress of the work, while DeGolyer did not respond to a request for comment.

Asked to comment, Aramco said: "We do not comment on rumours and speculation. Investors will receive relevant information in due course in connection with the IPO."

An industry source had told Reuters in March that Aramco aimed to have one of the two reserves auditors wrap up the review this year, long before the planned listing. But this now looks unlikely. [nL5N1GL5AF]

"Aramco wants to make sure the companies are shown full data to avoid sceptical remarks on its reserves later on," a second source said. "It's unlikely the audit will be finished this year."

A third source said auditing work on the major Aramco fields was completed, leaving smaller fields still to be audited.

A reserves total that is significantly above or below the 261 billion figure is likely to affect Aramco's potential value. Earlier phases of the audit have supported Aramco's statements on the total size of deposits. [nL5N1FH2YM]

The sale of around 5 percent of Aramco next year is a centrepiece of Vision 2030, an ambitious reform plan to diversify the Saudi economy beyond oil which is championed by Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman.

No decision about the location of the international share listing has been announced, fuelling market speculation the IPO could be delayed or shelved. But Prince Mohammad told Reuters in October it was still on track for 2018. [nL8N1N13YC]

BUZZ- Range blowout has Energy ETF gushing higher on the charts - Reuters News

{{20171106T205053.787+0000}}BUZZ- Range blowout has Energy ETF gushing higher on the charts** Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund recent swings have led to an upward range resolution, thrust to a 7-month high

** XLE, up 2.2 pct Mon, on track for its best daily pct gain since early Jun, though still down ~7 pct YTD

** This as oil extends gains amid news Saudi Arabia's crown prince is cementing his power, while at the same time U.S. rig count dropped, market tightens [nL3N1NC4QG]

** NYMEX Crude Futures hit highest since summer 2015; Nat Gas 2-month highs

** In mid-Oct, daily Bollinger Band (BB) width, historical volatility measure, fell to its lowest level in 20-year XLE history [nL2N1MU11P]

** Compression suggested potential for powerful trend once range resolved

** XLE dipped to $66.34 later in Oct, did not violate 100-DMA, quickly reversed

** Reclaimed $68.25 swing resistance, including 200-DMA, taking pressure off downside

** With Mon thrust, XLE momentum and volatility rising. Chart: http://reut.rs/2zjrwCl

** Thus, unless ETF quickly reverses again, breaks its early Nov low ($68.06)/200-DMA (now $67.68), appears poised for further gains; 200-WMA ($74.38) can be a magnet

** Meanwhile, XLE - Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund spread ($6.59) held its $4.14 late-Aug low

** Thus, spread has near-term potential to widen toward 3+ year resistance line (now just over $16.00); energy shares can outperform tech in surprise turn

** This as tech shares/indices flirt with chart hurdles [nL1N1NC102] [nL1N1NC0LQ] [nL2N1N70N5] [nL2N1N60MC]

Dutch Council of State to rule on Groningen gas production Nov. 15 - Reuters News

{{20171106T134318.203+0000}}Dutch Council of State to rule on Groningen gas production Nov. 15AMSTERDAM, Nov 6 (Reuters) - A Dutch high court on Monday said it will rule on Nov. 15 on whether to uphold the government's current plan for gas production at the Groningen gas field.

The plan to lower production to 21.6 billion cubic meters per year beginning in October has been challenged by both environmental groups, who want the figure lowered, and the field's operator, a joint venture between Royal Dutch Shell and Exxon Mobil.

Shell looks beyond road fuels to secure future of refining - Reuters News

{{20171106T070002.682+0000}}Shell looks beyond road fuels to secure future of refining* Asphalt, plastics, chemicals to sustain demand, Shell says

* Shell to double chemicals business by mid-2020s

* Downstream highly independent from oil prices - Shell's Abbott

By Ron Bousso and Dmitry Zhdannikov

LONDON, Nov 6 (Reuters) - While the world braces for the electric-vehicle revolution, Royal Dutch Shell is betting on growing appetite for asphalt and plastics to sustain its century-old oil refining business for the coming decades.

Converting crude oil into products ranging from gasoline to industrial chemicals has long faced obstacles due to volatile profits, high costs, safety issues and pollution and more recently, forecasts of peaking demand for oil.

But refining, together with trading, marketing and chemicals - known together as downstream - has proved its importance during the oil industry's downturn since 2014, providing the bulk of Shell's profits as the price of crude collapsed.

Shell has in recent years transformed its downstream business by selling some plants and upgrading others to have them better resist oil price fluctuations and shifts in demand, delivering double-digit returns on capital employed.

"Refining will continue to be part of our portfolio for decades to come," said Shell's head of manufacturing Lori Ryerkerk, who is in charge of refining.

Shell is perhaps the most aggressive in its sector in forecasting that the demand for gasoline could reach an apex by the 2030s as drivers shift to electric vehicles and traditional engines become more efficient.

But still, Shell says, the continued expansion of the world's economy, particularly in Asia, means consumption of other refined oil products and petrochemicals is likely to grow.

For instance, there are no economically viable substitutes for asphalt, needed to build roads, or for the polymers and chemicals used to produce plastics for cars, toys and clothes, Ryerkerk said.

"While the peak demand for our products will come, it won't come in decades. There are still many products that we make for which there is no other alternative at the moment – heavy transport, industrial applications that require high heat."

The Anglo-Dutch company plans to double the size of its chemicals business by the middle of the next decade with several new plants including in Louisiana and Pennsylvania that benefit from access to cheap shale gas, said Shell's head of chemicals, Graham van't Hoff.

It also wants 20 percent of sales from its fuel stations worldwide to come from recharging electric vehicles and low-carbon fuels by 2025. [nL5N1LT4R6]

The oil sector's outlook for growth in demand for oil and plastics could prove wrong if governments around the world introduce regulations to reduce fossil fuel consumption in their fight against pollution and global warming. A study published last week said a quarter of the world's oil refineries risk closure by 2035 if those targets are met. [nL8N1N60XR]

Just as some countries such as China and India contemplate banning gasoline and diesel vehicles, rules to limit consumption of plastics such as bottles and bags could dampen demand, analysts said.

"Regulation is one of the biggest risks to the business," said Jason Kenney, head of European oil and gas equity research at Banco Santander.

Overcapacity is another danger as other companies including Exxon Mobil and France's Total also expand into petrochemicals.

"Shell currently offers double-digit returns on capital employed from downstream and chemicals. But then you could have a flood of capacity and it will be a difficult sector to remain competitive for decades," Kenney said.

RESILIENCE

Even when demand starts to fall, Shell says its refining arm will have an edge over many competitors thanks to the company's access to its own, cheaper crude and complex trading operations that curb its vulnerability to fluctuating oil prices.

It has 43,000 petrol stations in 70 countries, making Shell the world's largest fuel retailer. Shell recently introduced battery charging spots at a number of stations in Britain and plans to develop hydrogen fuelling stations in Germany.

Shell also supplies 11 percent of the world's lubricants needed in cars, trucks and heavy industrial machinery. It has one of the world's largest aviation fuel businesses, fuelling a plane every 40 seconds.

"Downstream is a highly resilient business. It is pretty independent to changes in crude price," said John Abbott, head of Shell's downstream business.

"We have a competitive edge going into the energy transition," Abbott said.

Shell has interests in more than 20 refineries and processed around 2.6 million barrels of oil per day in 2016, while its 15 petrochemical plants processed 6.2 million tonnes last year.

BREAKINGVIEWS-Singapore's DBS gets closer to oil reality - Reuters Breakingviews

{{20171106T032548.091+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-Singapore's DBS gets closer to oil reality(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are her own.)

By Clara Ferreira-Marques

SINGAPORE, Nov 6 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Singapore's DBS Group has taken a big dose of oil medicine. The $43 billion banking titan lifted net provisions in the latest quarter to a 15-year high. Like its two largest peers, Overseas-Chinese Banking Corp and United Overseas Bank , DBS reckons the worst of the shock in crude prices is over. The offshore industry is still aching, though, leaving both the economy and vessel valuations vulnerable. Local lenders may yet feel more pain.

After a rough 18 months of watching Swiber Holdings and other providers of engineering and construction services reel into distress, there is some good news for Singapore's banks. Interest rates are set to gradually rise. The Lion City's property market is recovering, and its broader $300 billion economy is showing signs of improvement. Wealth management and transaction-banking businesses are gaining ground.

DBS's move on Monday to set aside another S$815 million ($597 million) for troubled loans is an effort to get investors to focus on that momentum. Provisions now cover about half its oil-and-gas services non-performing debt. Singapore's biggest bank also has aggressively written down the value of offshore service vessels used to secure many of the loans to 25 percent.

That's a helpful step, especially if the remaining portfolio is as strong as DBS is arguing. It doesn't mean the worst is definitively past, however, despite a 31 percent run-up in its shares this year.

After distress first hit roughly two years ago when oil tumbled below $50 a barrel, the industry is now experiencing something of a second wave as big producers and service providers come to terms with lower prices for longer. They make it harder to justify complex projects. Drilling cancellations in the region, such as Exxon Mobil's exit from East Natuna in Indonesia this summer, will persist. Halliburton said last month its clients were focused on "cost-effective" production.

It's the sort of news that augurs poorly for banks, especially ones that have not pushed down energy-related collateral nearer to liquidation levels as DBS has. More loans also may wind up added to the endangered list. Singapore's three biggest banks are getting closer to the energy reality, but aren't necessarily fully there.

CONTEXT NEWS

- DBS, Singapore's biggest lender, on Nov. 6 reported an 87 percent increase in net provisions, to S$815 million, their highest level in 15 years, "to remove uncertainty over residual weak oil and gas services exposures".

- At the end of September, DBS had S$3 billion of oil-and-gas support services non-performing assets, for which allowances of S$1.5 billion have been made.

- The bank's net profit fell 23 percent to a five-year low of S$822 million, below the average estimate of S$1.13 billion from four analysts compiled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Pakistan's Engro eyes 2019 start for new LNG terminal in Karachi - Reuters News

{{20171104T094037.102+0000}}Pakistan's Engro eyes 2019 start for new LNG terminal in KarachiBy Drazen Jorgic

KARACHI, Nov 4 (Reuters) - Pakistani conglomerate Engro Corp expects to complete building its second liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal in early 2019, a senior company official said, as Pakistan bets heavily on LNG imports to curb energy shortages.

Engro built Pakistan's first LNG terminal in 2015 and is now finalising plans with Royal Dutch Shell , Fatima Group and trading house Gunvor for another terminal with capacity of 4.5 million tonnes per year.

Pakistan has become a hot destination for global energy giants, with producers such as Exxon and traders like Vitol seeking partners to build terminals after Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi re-oriented Pakistan's energy policy towards gas.

A second terminal is due to come on line later this month, easing gas shortages that have hobbled Pakistan's manufacturing sector and wider economy for more than a decade. Private companies are racing to build several other terminals.

Jahangir Piracha, chief executive of Engro's LNG unit, Elengy Terminal Pakistan, said his consortium expects to sign a final investment decision (FID) in the next few months and would then build the terminal in about a year.

"The technical studies are all done. We are looking at early 2019 (to complete the project) if everything goes right," Piracha told Reuters in Karachi this week.

A rival LNG terminal project by a six-member consortium that included ExxonMobil and Qatar Petroleum, appears to be in trouble after the American company pulled out, Pakistani officials said. ExxonMobil, however, remains very keen on Pakistan and is looking at other terminal projects. [nL8N1N546H]

Unlike Pakistan's first two terminals where the government guaranteed to buy all the gas due to be imported, the subsequent terminals are going to be entirely private ventures with no government off-take guarantees.

Engro's Piracha said the biggest challenge for the Engro consortium is to convince gas buyers such as power plants and factories to sign up before the project is on the ground.

"Because there are so many people trying to develop a project, (local buyers) want to bet on the right horse. They don't want to sign up with you to find out that your project didn't come through," he said.

Piracha said this posed a problem for terminal developers who would prefer to have signed-up customers before making a final investment decision.

"It's a bit of a chicken and egg story," Piracha said. "My own feeling is that people want to see an investment and then they will sign up."

Piracha said other companies in the Engro group could sign up to be consumers from the terminal, which has the capacity for regasification of up to 600 million cubic feet per day, as could businesses from consortium partner Fatima, another major Pakistani conglomerate.

A rival LNG terminal project by a six-member consortium that included ExxonMobil and Qatar Petroleum, appears to be in trouble after the American company pulled out, Pakistani officials said. ExxonMobil, however, remains very keen on Pakistan and is looking at other terminal projects. [nL8N1N546H]

Unlike Pakistan's first two terminals where the government guaranteed to buy all the gas due to be imported, the subsequent terminals are going to be entirely private ventures with no government off-take guarantees.

Engro's Piracha said the biggest challenge for the Engro consortium is to convince gas buyers such as power plants and factories to sign up before the project is on the ground.

"Because there are so many people trying to develop a project, (local buyers) want to bet on the right horse. They don't want to sign up with you to find out that your project didn't come through," he said.

Piracha said this posed a problem for terminal developers who would prefer to have signed-up customers before making a final investment decision.

"It's a bit of a chicken and egg story," Piracha said. "My own feeling is that people want to see an investment and then they will sign up."

Piracha said other companies in the Engro group could sign up to be consumers from the terminal, which has the capacity for regasification of up to 600 million cubic feet per day, as could businesses from consortium partner Fatima, another major Pakistani conglomerate.

U.S. shale producers promise both higher output and returns - Reuters News

{{20171103T190227.262+0000}}U.S. shale producers promise both higher output and returnsBy Ernest Scheyder

HOUSTON, Nov 3 (Reuters) - U.S. shale producers are telling investors impatient for better returns that they can keep boosting oil output aggressively and do so while still making money for shareholders.

Investors have pushed top U.S. shale companies to focus on returns, rather than higher output, a move that threatened to slow the breakneck growth in supply sparked by the shale revolution in the world's top oil consumer.

For the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, slower shale production gains would have been welcome. The cartel this year put caps on its members' production to end a supply glut and boost oil prices, only to find U.S. shale gains and record exports muting the impact of their curbs.

But in comments during recent third-quarter earnings calls, shale executives signaled they expect to deliver both higher returns and output.

At least seven of the largest U.S. shale companies, including Noble Energy Inc and Devon Energy Corp , forecast 10 percent or better production gains this quarter in the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico, the largest U.S. oilfield.

Underpinning the effort: Rising global oil demand and crude prices that are up about 30 percent since June lows. Shale producers are also proving they can drive output higher even after several last summer reported some Permian wells had begun delivering more natural gas, a sign of aging fields.

"I'd like to think the industry is changing for the better," said Todd Heltman of wealth manager Neuberger Berman, which invests in shale producers. "Investors are more focused on return metrics."

Devon plans to boost oil production this quarter by 20 percent from the Permian and Oklahoma shale plays and spend less on each new well. [nL2N1N5147] [nL4N1N66JY]

"We are taking the appropriate steps to become an industry leader with our disciplined approach to capital allocation," said Devon Chief Executive Dave Hager.

U.S. shale output is expected to hit 6.1 million barrels of oil per day (bpd) this month, up 35 percent from a year earlier, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

The inventory of drilled-but-uncompleted wells, a backlog for future output, in September reached 7,120, up 42.6 percent from the year-ago period, and an all-time high. While the number of oil drilling rigs in the United States has slid in recent months, each rig's efficiency has jumped sharply in the past year.

EOG Resources Inc boosted third-quarter production by 8 percent and swung to a $100 million profit, from a loss in the same period last year, helped in part by rising oil prices. CEO Bill Thomas said the company is aiming for 20 percent increase in U.S. crude output this year over last. Its stock is up nearly 17 percent since August.[nL2N1N821M]

Noble Energy forecast its fourth-quarter shale production will rise 15 percent to at least 102,000 bpd.

"If you look at the growth from our Permian Basin drilling operations, you can see very substantial increases in oil production growth of about 15 percent," said Tim Dove, CEO of Pioneer Natural Resources Co .

Pioneer, one of the largest Permian oil producers, plans to boost its shale output by at least 16,000 bpd this quarter. The company's shares are up 15.4 percent since early August. [nL2N1N7253]

Next year could bring more of the same gains.

"We are excited about the trajectory of production growth in the upcoming quarters," said Vicki Hollub, CEO of Occidental Petroleum Corp , another top Permian producer. Oxy projects its Texas oil output will rise by more than 80,000 bpd by the end of 2018, to more than 200,000 bpd. [nL2N1N72CF]

Shale producers outside Texas are cranking up production, too.

Whiting Petroleum Corp , which operates in North Dakota's Bakken shale, plans a 10 percent jump in its fourth-quarter production.[nL2N1N02IO]

"We're confident about the areas in which we're drilling through to the end of the year and really, through the end of 2018," said Jim Volker, who retired as Whiting's CEO this week.[nL4N1MZ5UY]

Continental Resources Inc and Parsley Energy Inc , two other large U.S. shale producers, are due to report quarterly results next week.

OPEC TENSION

U.S. shale increases are keenly watched by OPEC, and likely will be in the spotlight when the group and other major producers meet on Nov. 30 in Vienna.

Emmanuel Kachikwu, Nigeria's oil minister, warned at the last OPEC meeting in May that the group would "sit down again and look at what process it is we need to do" if U.S. shale output continues to weigh on global markets.[nL1N1IQ0AC]

Adding to the pressures, major oil companies that were late to recognize shale's potential have brought their own resources to bear. Chevron Corp and Exxon Mobil Corp are setting out aggressive plans for U.S. shale production, especially in the Permian.[nL2N1N20S2]

Exxon, which more than doubled its Permian holdings earlier this year, plans to boost the number of drilling rigs there by 50 percent, to 30, by the end of next year. By 2020, Exxon expects its Permian oil production to rise 45 percent.[nL2N1N20K7]

Chevron, which has operated in the Permian since the 1930s, recently added a 15th drilling rig in the Permian, with plans to add five more.[nL2N1N20NT]

"We'll be in a position to grow production for a period of years just from the shale," Chevron CEO John Watson said of the company's Permian operations.

UPDATE 1-Threats to NAFTA cast doubt over Mexico's oil tenders, investment - Reuters News

{{20171103T005603.510+0000}}UPDATE 1-Threats to NAFTA cast doubt over Mexico's oil tenders, investment(Adds comment from oil regulator)

By David Alire Garcia

MEXICO CITY, Nov 2 (Reuters) - Uncertainty about the fate of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and investor protections it guarantees could crimp future investment in Mexico's oil industry, including a high-stakes January deepwater auction.

Ahead of a fifth round of NAFTA talks in Mexico City in mid-November, Washington's tough demands that partners Canada and Mexico resist has clouded the future of the 23-year-old pact President Donald Trump has threatened to quit if he cannot get a better deal. [nL2N1MS0XB]

The January deepwater tender of 29 blocks holding some 4.2 billion barrels of prospective reserves, could suffer if concerns about NAFTA's future persuaded oil majors such as Chevron Corp and Exxon Mobil Corp to sit out the auction, oil executives and former government officials say.

So far, 17 companies have begun the process of pre-qualifying for the auction.

"Future investment without those investment protections of NAFTA will take into account the higher level of risk of any dispute not being settled in a more fair manner," Tim Callahan, Mexico country manager for Australia's BHP Billiton , told Reuters.

Energy firms worry the end of NAFTA could eliminate the so-called Investor State Dispute Settlement, which allows such conflicts to be settled via international arbitrators, overriding contractual clauses that only reference local courts.

Last December, BHP Billiton won a 60 percent stake in the $11 billion Trion field in the Gulf of Mexico, the flagship deepwater project of state-owned oil company Pemex.

That same day, eight of 10 blocks were awarded in the deepwater auction, yielding investment commitments worth hundreds of millions of dollars in the first few years of the contracts alone by firms like U.S.-based Chevron and Murphy Oil.

The auctions are part of a 2013 energy reform that ended Pemex's monopoly on oil and gas production. So far, the reform has secured investment pledges that will eventually be worth about $80 billion, the government says.

Callahan, who heads the Mexican oil producer association's NAFTA committee, pointed to longstanding nationalist sentiment toward oil and a lack of legal precedents during the 75-year Pemex monopoly.

"I don't think any of us want to be the first to test in the Mexican courts how they're going to rule on any disputes when it comes to oil," he said.

Threats to NAFTA may force some U.S. oil firms to opt out of January's tenders, said former deputy energy minister Lourdes Melgar, an architect of the auctions. Some deem the investor dispute mechanism "essential" to protect investments, she added.

Some of the biggest investments to date were made only after the government assured firms behind closed doors that any expropriation or administrative withdrawal of contracts could be appealed using the NAFTA resolution mechanism, said Carlos Pascual, a former U.S. ambassador to Mexico now at IHS Markit.

The assurances were made before Trump's surprise election win and company concerns over investor protections lasted "up until the last minute" before bids were submitted, Pascual said.

Without NAFTA, investment disputes could fall to Mexican courts, which unsettles some firms concerned that local judges are often susceptible to bribes or intimidation, oil company executives and former officials say.

"It's a fight for the oil and gas dollar now, and if the companies aren't treated fairly, then there's lots of other places to go," said Craig Steinke, head of Canada-based Renaissance Oil Corp , a company that has won five onshore contracts in Mexico.

Even under the oil contracts' administrative withdrawal clause, companies are entitled to an audience to present their case, the participation of an independent expert and there are no one-person decisions, said Juan Carlos Zepeda, head of oil regulator CNH, which is in charge of supervising the contracts.

Energy Minister Pedro Joaquin Coldwell told Reuters that even without NAFTA protections, respect for due process was embedded in Mexico's legal system. He added that Mexico has more than a dozen other bilateral investment treaties with similar protections as NAFTA, a point that several oil executives who have spoken to Reuters in private also make.

"I don't think the industry should be worried," Coldwell said.

However, leftist presidential hopeful Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who has led early polls for next July's election, has a different message.

Lopez Obrador promises to review signed oil contracts and his top energy advisor Rocio Nahle said foreign companies should not bank on bypassing local courts.

"They need to be careful ... and respect Mexico's laws because this is Mexican territory," said Nahle, who also leads Lopez Obrador's party in the lower house of Congress.

Threats to NAFTA may force some U.S. oil firms to opt out of January's tenders, said former deputy energy minister Lourdes Melgar, an architect of the auctions. Some deem the investor dispute mechanism "essential" to protect investments, she added.

Some of the biggest investments to date were made only after the government assured firms behind closed doors that any expropriation or administrative withdrawal of contracts could be appealed using the NAFTA resolution mechanism, said Carlos Pascual, a former U.S. ambassador to Mexico now at IHS Markit.

The assurances were made before Trump's surprise election win and company concerns over investor protections lasted "up until the last minute" before bids were submitted, Pascual said.

Without NAFTA, investment disputes could fall to Mexican courts, which unsettles some firms concerned that local judges are often susceptible to bribes or intimidation, oil company executives and former officials say.

"It's a fight for the oil and gas dollar now, and if the companies aren't treated fairly, then there's lots of other places to go," said Craig Steinke, head of Canada-based Renaissance Oil Corp , a company that has won five onshore contracts in Mexico.

Energy Minister Pedro Joaquin Coldwell told Reuters that even without NAFTA protections, respect for due process was embedded in Mexico's legal system. He added that Mexico has more than a dozen other bilateral investment treaties with similar protections as NAFTA, a point that several oil executives who have spoken to Reuters in private also make.

"I don't think the industry should be worried," Coldwell said.

However, leftist presidential hopeful Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who has led early polls for next July's election, has a different message.

Lopez Obrador promises to review signed oil contracts and his top energy advisor Rocio Nahle said foreign companies should not bank on bypassing local courts.

"They need to be careful ... and respect Mexico's laws because this is Mexican territory," Nahle, who also leads Lopez Obrador's party in the lower house of Congress, told Reuters.

UPDATE 1-Exxon's Baton Rouge refinery reformer heavily damaged by fire -sources - 路透新闻

{{20171102T220516.883+0000}}UPDATE 1-Exxon's Baton Rouge refinery reformer heavily damaged by fire -sources(Adds no response from company, details, background)

HOUSTON, Nov 2 (Reuters) - A 78,000 barrel-per-day (bpd) reformer was heavily damaged in a fire at ExxonMobil Corp's 502,500 bpd Baton Rouge, Louisiana, refinery, sources familiar with plant operations said on Thursday. A leak was being repaired on the unit when the fire broke out early on Wednesday, the sources said.

There is no timeline for repairing the reformer, which is called the Powerformer.

An Exxon spokeswoman did not reply to a request for comment.

Early on Wednesday morning, the reformer, which converts refining by-products into octane-boosting components of gasoline, was roped off due to the leak when the fire broke out, the sources said.

No injuries were reported due to the blaze.

The refinery's 210,000 bpd crude distillation unit (CDU), the largest of four doing the primary refining of crude oil and providing feedstocks for all other units, was taken out of production to stop the flow of feed to the reformer shortly after the fire erupted.

The CDU returned to production on Wednesday night.

UPDATE 2-Valero a gasoline buyer on U.S. East Coast after Pembroke outage -sources - Reuters News

{{20171102T194643.598+0000}}UPDATE 2-Valero a gasoline buyer on U.S. East Coast after Pembroke outage -sources(Adds Exxon purchases)

NEW YORK, Nov 2 (Reuters) - Valero Energy was buying gasoline cargoes for spot delivery in the U.S. East Coast after an outage at its 270,000 barrels per day (bpd) Pembroke refinery in Wales earlier this week, two trade sources said on Thursday.

Valero, the largest U.S. independent refiner, typically sells gasoline barrels from their Pembroke refinery into the New York Harbor market, traders said.

Exxon Mobil was also buying prompt gasoline barrels in the New York harbor on Thursday, traders said.

The purchases come as supplies in the U.S. East Coast have been squeezed amid lower transatlantic imports and fewer barrels being sent via pipeline from the Gulf Coast refining hub. U.S. Midwest prices have also soared, pulling barrels away from the New York harbor. [nL4N1N16XB]

Gasoline prices in the New York Harbor have surged and traded about 6 cents a gallon above benchmark futures for delivery in December on the New York Mercantile Exchange on Thursday.

The U.S. gasoline crack spread - a key metric in refining margins - continues to surge above five-year highs seasonally. It rose as much as 7.7 percent to $20.27 a barrel on Thursday, after ending the session at around $19.79.

The 90,000 bpd fluid catalytic converter (FCC) at Pembroke was shut unexpectedly earlier this week, three trade sources said. It was not immediately clear what caused the shutdown or when the unit would be restarted.

Traders said Valero was also looking to sell vacuum gasoil, the feedstock used to feed the FCC.

A spokeswoman for the refinery declined to comment on the plant's day to day operations.

Valero purchased the prompt barrels at 6 cents per gallon above benchmark futures, one East Coast trader said. Exxon, meanwhile, did not ship barrels over from Europe, prompting the company to buy barrels in the Philadelphia region and move it west since its Joliet plant was down.

Exxon said last week planned maintenance is continuing on several units at the 238,600 bpd Joliet, Illinois refinery. [nFWN1N01DR]

Gasoline refining margins in northwest Europe extended their gains on Thursday on the back of the outage. [nL8N1N8844]

LEAD 1-Shell-Hausse de 47% du bénéfice au T3, grâce au raffinage - Reuters (French)

{{20171102T110606.773+0000}}LEAD 1-Shell-Hausse de 47% du bénéfice au T3, grâce au raffinage* Hausse du bénéfice de 47% à $4,1 mds

* Bénéfice plus que triplé de l'activité aval

* Flux de trésorerie de $10 mds, hors fonds de roulement

(Actualisé avec précisions, commentaires d'analystes et cours de Bourse)

par Ron Bousso et Karolin Schaps

LONDRES/AMSTERDAM, 2 novembre (Reuters) - La compagnie pétrolière anglo-néerlandaise Royal Dutch Shell a publié jeudi un bénéfice au troisième trimestre en hausse de quasiment 50%, une progression nettement supérieure aux attentes, grâce notamment à ses solides activités de raffinage.

"Les trois activités de Shell ont toutes apporté une contribution solide à ces bons résultats", a déclaré le directeur général Ben van Beurden dans un communiqué, faisant référence aux activités dans l'aval (raffinage & distribution), la production pétrolière et gazière.

Shell et la plupart de ses concurrents sont désormais capables de réaliser des profits, même si le baril de pétrole redescend aux alentours des 50 dollars et se concentrent sur la croissance de leurs activités. Le prix du baril de Brent , qui s'élevait en moyenne à 52 dollars au troisième trimestre, dépasse aujourd'hui les 60 dollars.

BP a dit cette semaine qu'il pourrait équilibrer ses comptes si le cours du brut retombait à 49 dollars.

Signe de cette reprise, Shell a obtenu la semaine dernière le droit d'explorer la moitié de blocs proposés par le Brésil. BP et Exxon Mobil ont également participé avec succès à l'appel d'offres.

Le titre Shell gagne 0,869% à 2 380 pence à la Bourse de Londres vers 12h06, qui avance de 0,31% au même moment.

L'IMPACT DES OURAGANS

Les activités de raffinage, dont le bénéfice a triplé au troisième trimestre, ont largement contribué à la hausse globale du résultat du groupe. Ces dernières ont tiré profit d'une forte progression des marges au mois d'août après le passage de l'ouragan Harvey aux Etats-Unis, qui a réduit d'un quart les capacités des raffineries.

La division chimie, un moteur de croissance important pour les dix ans à venir, a également accru son bénéfice de 20% au troisième trimestre par rapport à il y a un an.

"Les chiffres sont solides. L'aval est une fois encore un facteur de croissance clé", commente Iain Reid, analyste chez Macquarie.

Le bénéfice net part du groupe, ajusté des coûts courants d'approvisionnement (CCS) et hors éléments exceptionnels, a atteint 4,1 milliards de dollars (3,5 milliards d'euros), à comparer avec un consensus de 3,62 milliards de dollars.

Le bénéfice net pour le troisième trimestre 2016 s'établissait à 2,72 milliards de dollars.

La production de pétrole et de gaz sur la période juillet-septembre a augmenté de 2% à 3,657 millions de barils équivalent pétrole par jour par rapport au trimestre précédent.

La génération de trésorerie tirée des activités a baissé de 33% à 7,58 milliards de dollars, son premier recul depuis le premier trimestre 2016. Shell a expliqué ce repli par les hausses en valeur des stocks en raison de l'augmentation des prix du pétrole.

Hors fonds de roulement, la génération de trésorerie a atteint 10 milliards de dollars sur la période, ce qui garantit les investissements du groupe et le versement du dividende, estiment les analystes.

"Le groupe démontre la solidité de ses flux de trésorerie dans un environnement où le baril de Brent vaut environ 50 dollars, ils couvrent le dividende", relève Jason Gammel, analyste chez Jefferies.

Le ratio dette sur capitaux propres, a légèrement augmenté à 25,4%, contre 25,3% au deuxième trimestre.

Il est sensiblement inférieur au pic de 29,2% atteint au troisième trimestre 2016, après le rachat de BG Group pour 54 milliards de dollars.

Shell a vendu quelque 25 milliards de dollars d'actifs pour financer cette acquisition et devrait parvenir à atteindre son objectif de 30 milliards de dollars d'ici la fin 2018.

* Production still complies with global deal

* Output rose as maintenance was completed in Sakhalin-1
project

(Adds detail)

By Vladimir Soldatkin

MOSCOW, Nov 2 (Reuters) - Russian oil output edged up to
10.93 million barrels per day (bpd) in October from a yearly low
of 10.91 million bpd in September and August, energy ministry
data showed on Thursday, following the completion of maintenance
at Pacific fields.

In tonnes, oil output reached 46.23 million versus 44.639
million in September, but Russia remains in compliance with a
global deal aimed at cutting oil production in order to reduce
excessive inventories and support oil prices.

The latest figures show Russia cut its oil output by around
317,000 barrels per day from 11.247 million bpd reached in
October 2016, the baseline for the global agreement to reduce
oil production.

It had agreed to curb its oil output by 300,000 bpd from
that level as part of the global deal with the Organization of
the Petroleum Exporting Countries to cut combined output by
almost 1.8 million barrels per day until March 31.

Sources have told Reuters that OPEC is likely to stay the
course by keeping its current curb on oil production in place
for the whole of 2018 despite potential output disruptions next
year. [nL8N1N75DP]

Russian oil pipeline exports in October rose to 4.627
million bpd from 4.302 million bpd in September.

Output at oil projects run by foreign majors under
production sharing agreements (PSA) jumped by 47 percent in
October from September to almost 300,000 bpd.

This came after the ExxonMobil-led  Sakhalin-1
project in the Pacific outskirts of Russia completed a
maintenance last month.

Output at Russia's largest oil producer Rosneft 
was unchanged in October, while output at the country's No.2 oil
company Lukoil  slipped by 0.4 percent.

Gas production was at 62.67 billion cubic metres (bcm) last
month, or 2.02 bcm a day, versus 53.69 bcm in September.

UPDATE 1-Exxon Baton Rouge refinery large CDU back in production -sources - 路透新闻

{{20171102T013841.278+0000}}UPDATE 1-Exxon Baton Rouge refinery large CDU back in production -sources(Adds details)

HOUSTON, Nov 1 (Reuters) - ExxonMobil Corp returned to production the large crude distillation unit (CDU) at its 502,500-barrel-per-day (bpd) Baton Rouge, Louisiana, refinery on Wednesday night after it was idled following a fire in another unit, said sources familiar with plant operations.

Exxon spokeswoman Charlotte Huffaker declined to comment.

The 210,000-bpd CDU was taken out of production following a fire in the refinery's 78,000-bpd reformer, the sources said.

No injuries were reported in the Wednesday morning blaze, Huffaker said. Exxon has not identified the unit where the fire broke out.

CDUs do the primary refining of crude oil coming into the refinery and provide hydrocarbon feedstock to all other units.

Quarter of oil refineries risk closure under climate goals -report - Reuters News

{{20171102T000101.058+0000}}Quarter of oil refineries risk closure under climate goals -report* Refining profits to shrivel as demand drops, report says

* Sector faces heavy over capacity -Carbon Tracker

* Targets to reduce carbon emissions however seem distant

By Ron Bousso

LONDON, Nov 2 (Reuters) - A quarter of the world's oil refineries risk closure by 2035 if governments meet targets to limit fossil fuel burning in the fight against global warming, a report released on Thursday said.

A surge in electric vehicle sales and higher efficiency in internal combustion and jet engines are expected to slow demand growth for fuels such as gasoline, diesel and aviation fuel in the coming decades, potentially putting pressure on refining profits.

At the same time, governments around the world are set to introduce legislation in the coming years to limit emissions of heat-capturing carbon dioxide into the atmosphere in order to meet targets set at a U.N-backed Paris conference in 2015.

As a result, companies such as Chevron , Royal Dutch Shell , France' Total and China's largest refiner Sinopec could see profits from refining drop by 70 percent or more over the period, according to the report co-authored by environment thinktank Carbon Tracker, Swedish investment fund AP7 and Danish pension fund PKA.

The study is based on the International Energy Agency's 450 Scenario to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius under which oil demand declines by 23 percent between 2020 and 2035.

Under this scenario, despite new refinery additions in Asia and the Middle East, only 62 percent of global capacity will be required to meet demand compared with around 80 percent today. Profits from converting crude oil into refined products will also shrink.

That in turn means that approximately one quarter of the 2016 refining capacity, the equivalent of some 24.7 million barrels per day of oil demand, will need to be closed, the report said.

The closures would likely be more pronounced in developed economies where oil demand is expected to peak earlier than in developing economies. Also, modern, complex refineries that can produce more high quality and cleaner fuels are likely to fare better than older plants.

"The consequences of achieving a 2 degree Celsius world are far more detrimental to the refining sector than the upstream sector, as it results in structural over-capacity and associated poor refining margin environment, which can only be addressed by sustained capacity rationalisation," said Alan Gelder, vice president for research at Edinburgh-based consultancy Wood Mackenzie which took part in the report.

Meeting the emission reduction targets however seems distant today. A report published on Tuesday said global emissions are set to be 30 percent higher than the target needed by 2030.[nL8N1N640X]

While oil companies including Shell have acknowledged that demand for some fuels such as gasoline could peak by the end of the 2020s, they expect demand for oil to remain strong for decades from heavy transport, aviation and chemical production.

The authors of the report estimate that overall earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) for refiners could fall by over 50 percent by 2035 from around $147 billion in 2015.

"We consider that prospective investors should be wary of all new refinery investments," the report said.

"When demand growth stalls and turns negative, new investments will carry the risk of failing to earn an adequate return."

Carbon Tracker and a group of investors warned in a report earlier this year that oil giants risk spending trillions by 2025 on oil and gas projects that won't be feasible under the international climate targets. [nL8N1JI1P9]

UPDATE 1-Exxon Baton Rouge refinery reformer shut after fire -sources - 路透新闻

{{20171101T183511.425+0000}}UPDATE 1-Exxon Baton Rouge refinery reformer shut after fire -sources(Adds company statement, details about unit, background on refinery)

HOUSTON, Nov 1 (Reuters) - A 78,000 barrel-per-day (bpd) reformer was shut on Wednesday by an early-morning fire at ExxonMobil Corp's 502,500 bpd Baton Rouge, Louisiana, refinery, said sources familiar with plant operations.

The fire broke out on the unit, called the Powerformer, at about 2:30 a.m. CDT (0730 GMT) on Wednesday, the sources said.

"On-site responders contained the fire to the area where it occurred and there were no injuries," said Exxon spokeswoman Lana Venable. "There was no community impact."

Venable did not identify the unit where the fire broke out.

Energy industry intelligence service Genscape said the refinery's 210,000 bpd crude distillation unit (CDU), the largest of four at the plant, was shut following the fire, though the blaze was not near the CDU.

The reformer, which has two 39,000 bpd production trains, converts refining by-products into octane-boosting components blended into gasoline.

This is the second fire on a unit involved in gasoline production in the past year at the refinery.

On Nov. 22, 2016, a fire broke out in the alkylation unit when workers disassembled a valve. Four workers were critically injured in the blaze. In May, the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration fined Exxon $165,000 for safety violations.

CDUs do the primary refining of crude oil in a refinery and provide feedstock to all other units.

Alkylation units, through a different process, also convert refining by-products into octane boosting components of gasoline.

UPDATE 2-Australia's Oil Search buys into promising Alaska oil find - Reuters News

{{20171101T064826.194+0000}}UPDATE 2-Australia's Oil Search buys into promising Alaska oil find* Spain's Repsol sees field holding 1.2 bln barrels of oil

* First production slated for 2023

* Eyeing output of up to 120,000 barrels per day

(Adds CEO, analysts' comments)

By Sonali Paul

MELBOURNE, Nov 1 (Reuters) - Australia's Oil Search Ltd has agreed to buy stakes in a huge oil find in Alaska for $400 million, in a surprise push to diversify from its sweet spot of gas in Papua New Guinea.

Oil Search will pick up stakes in three oil blocks from privately owned U.S. firms Armstrong Energy and GMT Exploration giving it a roughly 26 percent holding in the Nanushuk play, co-owned by Spain's Repsol SA .

The play includes the Horseshoe block, which hit oil in March in what Repsol called the biggest U.S. onshore find in 30 years. It estimated the field could hold 1.2 billion barrels. [nFWN1GM0QP]

Oil Search bought in assuming the field holds 500 million barrels, expecting production to begin in 2023, with output to plateau at 80,000 to 120,000 barrels per day.

"With the quality of the assets, the fact that they're tier 1, and the fact that we've gone in very conservatively against what Repsol are saying, I think we can demonstrate to the market that this will be a super deal for Oil Search in the medium term," Oil Search Chief Executive Peter Botten told Reuters.

Investors were nervous about the $8 billion company's move into a region where it has no experience and which is dominated by giants like BP and ExxonMobil Corp , sending its shares down 3 percent, especially after it gave up on a push into Kurdistan.

Other Australian oil and gas producers rose more than 1 percent on Wednesday.

"Questions will inevitably be asked about Oil Search's competitive advantage to play in Alaska until it proves its operational capability there," said Saul Kavonic, an analyst with energy consultants Wood Mackenzie.

RBC analyst Ben Wilson said the move was well-timed near the bottom of the oil price cycle and with some of the appraisal work on the field already done. He said it had "good prospects" as the oil was high-grade.

Botten began working on the deal eight months ago when oil prices were about 20 percent lower than now and said Oil Search managed to get the asset despite higher-priced interest from others in nearby fields, whom he declined to name.

The owners of the neighbouring fields are ConocoPhillips , ExxonMobil and Italy's ENI .

Oil Search has the option of doubling its stake in the Alaskan assets for a further $450 million. It plans to fund the deal from its cash reserves.

Oil Search will work with oilfield services giant Halliburton Co and Armstrong before taking over as operator of the assets in June 2018.

UPDATE 2-Exxon Mobil, PDC Energy settle with U.S., states over air pollution claims - Reuters News

{{20171031T202148.172+0000}}UPDATE 2-Exxon Mobil, PDC Energy settle with U.S., states over air pollution claims(Adds PDC comment in paragraph 6)

By Sarah N. Lynch

WASHINGTON, Oct 31 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp and PDC Energy Inc will each pay a $2.5 million civil penalty to settle charges by the federal government and several states alleging the companies violated laws aimed at reducing air pollution, the U.S. Justice Department said on Tuesday.

The settlement between Exxon and the department, the Environmental Protection Agency and the state of Louisiana alleges the company violated the Clean Air Act when it failed to properly operate and monitor industrial flares at eight of its petrochemical facilities in Texas and Louisiana.

In addition to the penalty, it agreed to invest nearly $300 million to install new air pollution monitoring technology.

The PDC settlement with the federal government and the state of Colorado also relates to Clean Air Act violations stemming from emissions of volatile organic compounds from its oil and gas exploration and production businesses.

Exxon denied any wrongdoing in the settlement, and its spokesman Aaron Stryk said the company worked closely with the government to resolve the matter.

PDC President and Chief Executive Bart Brookman said the agreement resulted from months of conversations with state and EPA regulators. In its settlement, PDC denied any liability.

The company also agreed to spend about $18 million on systems upgrades and another $1.7 million to mitigate the problems.

Grèce-Un consortium mené par Total signe un contrat d'exploration - Reuters (French)

{{20171031T164822.814+0000}}Grèce-Un consortium mené par Total signe un contrat d'explorationATHENES, 31 octobre (Reuters) - Un consortium emmené par Total a signé mardi avec le gouvernement grec un contrat d'exploration pétrolière et gazière en mer Ionienne.

Athènes veut utiliser ses réserves pétrolières, certes limitées, pour réduire ses importations et améliorer ses finances publiques.

Le consortium, retenu en octobre 2016, inclut également le premier raffineur du pays, Hellenic Petroleum , et l'italien Edison .

"C'est incontestablement un vote de confiance dans l'économie grecque", a déclaré le ministre de l'Energie George Stathakis lors de la cérémonie de signature mardi.

Total détiendra une participation de 50% dans le bloc concerné et ses deux partenaires auront chacun 25%.

L'accord doit encore être ratifié par le Parlement grec avant d'être effectif.

En juin dernier, la Grèce a validé le dossier soumis par un autre consortium réunissant le groupe français, ExxonMobil et Hellenic Petroleum pour des permis de prospection et de forage pétroliers et gaziers au large de la Crète. [nL8N1JK2RR]

Total, Edison sign lease for oil and gas exploration off Greece - Reuters News

{{20171031T153933.144+0000}}Total, Edison sign lease for oil and gas exploration off GreeceBy Karolina Tagaris

ATHENS, Oct 31 (Reuters) - A consortium led by France's Total moved a step closer to exploring for oil and gas off Greece after signing a lease on Tuesday with the government for a block in the Ionian Sea.

Greece wants to tap into its limited oil reserves to reduce dependence on oil imports and boost public finances.

It awarded the contract to the Total consortium, which also includes Greece's biggest oil refiner Hellenic Petroleum and Italy's Edison , in October 2016.

"Undoubtedly it is a vote of confidence in the Greek economy," Energy Minister George Stathakis said of the agreement on Tuesday.

Total will operate the block with a 50 percent stake, while Edison and Hellenic Petroleum will each hold 25 percent. The agreement must be ratified by Greece's parliament before exploration work can begin.

Western Greece is a frontier, underexplored area and very little data exists on its hydrocarbon potential.

Bernard Clement, a senior Total executive for the Caspian and Southern Europe, said it would maintain "realistic expectations" before obtaining data.

Total has shown interest in the eastern Mediterranean following major gas discoveries off Israel and Egypt. It is currently drilling for oil off Cyprus.

Together with Hellenic Petroleum in a consortium led by U.S. oil major Exxon Mobil , Total has also expressed interest in exploration at two sites off Crete, prompting Greece to launch a tender.

LOOKING WEST

Greece, like other European countries, relies on Russian gas imports which account for over 60 percent of supplies. Russia covers about a third of Greece's oil needs.

Athens also wants to attract investment into the oil industry as it tries to emerge from years of economic crisis.

During a meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump this month, Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras said Athens wanted U.S. investment in energy too, and it planned to set up a taskforce to overcome red tape.

"It helps a lot to keep the bureaucracy moving if you have a clear message from the top that the answer to investors should be 'Yes'," U.S. ambassador to Greece, Geoffrey Pyatt, told Reuters.

Greece has one LNG terminal off Athens, where it imports Algerian gas, but an official at state-run gas firm DEPA said it plans to invite U.S. companies to ship LNG there for the first time.

It is also developing a floating storage and regasification unit (FSRU) off Alexandroupolis, a city close to the Turkish and Bulgarian borders near where EU-backed pipelines are being built to cut reliance on Russian gas.

"Our vision for Greece (is) as a European energy hub," said Pyatt, a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine.

The FSRU, with an estimated annual capacity of 6.1 billion cubic metres, will seek to supply gas to southeastern Europe via the Interconnector Greece-Bulgaria (IGB) pipeline, which is due to begin construction next year.

The IGB and the FSRU could be connected to the Trans-Adriatic Pipeline which is being built to carry Caspian gas to European markets, which currently depends on Russian oil giant Gazprom for a third of its supply.

"You have several American companies that are looking at the FSRU," Pyatt said. "We very much hope to see an American company also become involved."
