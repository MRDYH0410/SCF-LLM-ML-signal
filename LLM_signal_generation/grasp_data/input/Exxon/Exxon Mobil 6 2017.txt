Canadian National Railway says oil spills after train derails in U.S. - 路透新闻

{{20170703T090221.880+0000}}Canadian National Railway says oil spills after train derails in U.S.July 3 (Reuters) - Canadian National Railway Co said about 20,000 gallons of oil was released following a freight train derailment at Plainfield, the U.S. state of Illinois on Friday, according to a filing with state pollution regulators.

The cause of the derailment was unknown, a filing with the Illinois Emergency Management Agency said on Saturday.

Local media reports estimated the spill to be 45,000 gallons.

The incident occurred when 20 cars of a Canadian National Railway Co freight train, carrying crude for Exxon Mobil Corp to Louisiana, went off the tracks, the Chicago Tribune said in a report on Saturday, quoting officials.

"No one was injured in the derailment. Officials confirmed that oil leaked from two of the cars on the Canadian National freight train, and a possible third car was leaking oil," the report added. (Source: http://trib.in/2uAFObw)

According to a report on the news website of Northwest Herald, most of the derailed cars were cleared by Saturday and the rest were expected to be removed from the site by Sunday.

Cleanup operations of the spilled crude was expected to take a few days, the report said. (Source: http://bit.ly/2t846vY)

IT- und Internet-Konzerne dominieren die Börsen der Welt - 路透新闻

{{20170701T123507.927+0000}}IT- und Internet-Konzerne dominieren die Börsen der WeltFrankfurt, 01. Jul (Reuters) - Der Siegeszug der IT- und Internet-Wirtschaft an den Börsen hat einen Höhepunkt erreicht. Die fünf wertvollsten börsennotierten Unternehmen kamen Ende Juni aus der digitalen Welt, wie die Unternehmensberatung EY errechnet hat. Apple führt mit einer Marktkapitalisierung von 751 Milliarden Dollar die Rangliste weiter vor der Google-Holding Alphabet (636 Milliarden) an. Hinter Microsoft (532 Milliarden) auf Platz drei belegen erstmals der Online-Händler Amazon.com (463 Milliarden) und Facebook(438 Milliarden) die Ränge vier und fünf. Sie verdrängten Warren Buffetts Investmentholding von Berkshire Hathaway und den Ölriesen Exxon Mobil, der vom fünften auf den neunten Platz zurückgefallen ist.

"Die Auswirkungen der Digitalisierung werden immer stärker sichtbar und erfassen immer mehr Branchen und Lebensbereiche", erklärte EY-Deutschland-Chef Hubert Barth am Samstag. "Wir erleben eine fundamentale Umwälzung, die angetrieben wird von innovativen und zunehmend auch hoch profitablen Technologiekonzernen."

Stellten die USA vor einem halben Jahr noch die kompletten Top Ten der Börsen-Schwergewichte, sind nun zwei chinesische Unternehmen in die Phalanx eingebrochen - und auch sie kommen aus der Digitalbranche: die Internet-Händler Alibaba und Tencent<0700.HK> auf den Rängen sieben und zehn. Ende 2016 hatten sie noch auf den Plätzen 19 und 13 gelegen, seither sind ihre Börsenwerte um 62 beziehungsweise 46 Prozent nach oben geschnellt. Zum Vergleich: Die Marktkapitalisierung des iPhone-Herstellers Apple stieg seit Jahresbeginn um knapp 22 Prozent, die von Alphabet um 18 Prozent.

SAP IST WERTVOLLSTES DEUTSCHES UNTERNEHMEN

Unter den 300 teuersten Unternehmen der Welt zählt EY 36 IT-Konzerne - doch nur drei davon kommen aus Europa. Das könne zum Problem werden. "Die Digitalisierung schreitet in großen Schritten voran - und derzeit werden die Regeln in erster Linie von amerikanischen und asiatischen IT-Konzernen gemacht", betonte Barth. Das wertvollste europäische Unternehmen ist auf Platz 13 der Schweizer Nahrungsmittelgigant Nestle mit 272 Milliarden Dollar.

Erst auf Platz 56 weltweit folgt mit dem Softwareriesen SAP (126 Milliarden Dollar) die Nummer eins in Deutschland. Unter den Top 100 finden sich mit SAP, Siemens (Platz 68) Bayer (70) und nun auch der Allianz (93) vier börsennotierte deutsche Konzerne, Ende 2016 waren es noch sechs. BASF, die Deutsche Telekom und Daimler fielen zurück.

Insgesamt finden sich 23 europäische Unternehmen unter den 100 wertvollsten, 52 kommen aus den USA. "Europa ist stärker, als es das Börsenranking suggeriert", erklärte Barth. Der Kontinent habe eine industrielle Basis, die man etwa in den USA vergeblich suche. Auch in einer digitalisierten Welt würden produzierende Hightech-Unternehmen gebraucht.

UPDATE 3-U.S. warns businesses of hacking campaign against nuclear, energy firms - 路透新闻

{{20170701T032855.821+0000}}UPDATE 3-U.S. warns businesses of hacking campaign against nuclear, energy firms(Adds comments from nuclear power generators)

By Jim Finkle

TORONTO, June 30 (Reuters) - The U.S government warned industrial firms this week about a hacking campaign targeting the nuclear and energy sectors, the latest event to highlight the power industry's vulnerability to cyber attacks.

Since at least May, hackers used tainted "phishing" emails to "harvest credentials" so they could gain access to networks of their targets, according to a joint report from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and Federal Bureau of Investigation.

The report provided to the industrial firms was reviewed by Reuters on Friday. While disclosing attacks, and warning that in some cases hackers succeeded in compromising the networks of their targets, it did not identify any specific victims.

"Historically, cyber actors have strategically targeted the energy sector with various goals ranging from cyber espionage to the ability to disrupt energy systems in the event of a hostile conflict," the report said.

Homeland Security and FBI officials could not be reached for comment on the report, which was dated June 28.

The report was released during a week of heavy hacking activity.

A virus dubbed "NotPetya" attacked on Tuesday, spreading from initial infections in Ukraine to businesses around the globe. It encrypted data on infected machines, rendering them inoperable and disrupting activity at ports, law firms and factories. [L8N1JP55N]

On Tuesday the energy-industry news site E&E News reported that U.S. investigators were looking into cyber intrusions this year at multiple nuclear power generators.

Reuters has not confirmed details of the E&E News report, which said there was no evidence safety systems had been compromised at affected plants.

The activity described in the U.S. government report comes at a time when industrial firms are particularly anxious about threat that hackers pose to their operations.

Industrial firms, including power providers and other utilities, have been particularly worried about the potential for destructive cyber attacks since December 2016, when hackers cut electricity in Ukraine.

U.S. nuclear power generators PSEG , SCANA Corp and Entergy Corp said they were not impacted by the recent cyber attacks. SCANA's V.C. Summer nuclear plant in South Carolina shut down on Thursday due to a problem with a valve in the non-nuclear portion of the plant, a spokesman said.

Another nuclear power generator, Dominion Energy , said it does not comment on cyber security.

Two cyber security firms said on June 12 that they had identified the malicious software used in the Ukraine attack, which they dubbed Industroyer, warning that it could be easily modified to attack utilities in the United States and Europe. [L1N1J90J8]

Industroyer is only the second piece of malware uncovered to date that is capable of disrupting industrial processes without the need for hackers to manually intervene.

The first, Stuxnet, was discovered in 2010 and is widely believed by security researchers to have been used by the United States and Israel to attack Iran's nuclear program.

The U.S. government report said attackers conducted reconnaissance to gain information about the individuals whose computers they sought to infect so that they create "decoy documents" on topics of interest to their targets.

In an analysis, it described 11 files used in the attacks, including malware downloaders and tools that allow the hackers to take remote control of victim's computers and travel across their networks.

Chevron Corp , Exxon Mobil Corp and ConocoPhillips , the three largest U.S. oil producers, declined to comment on their network security.

REFILE-Brussels ponders deadly smoke after Grenfell Tower blaze - 路透新闻

{{20170630T144539.082+0000}}REFILE-Brussels ponders deadly smoke after Grenfell Tower blaze(Refiles to clarify breakdown of smoke-related deaths in paragraph 19)

* Draft report says no case for EU-wide rules on smoke

* European Commission says cannot confirm publication date

* Report was debated at meeting in May

By Barbara Lewis and Julia Fioretti

LONDON/BRUSSELS, June 29 (Reuters) - EU policymakers are unlikely to agree to Europe-wide rules on toxic smoke from burning building materials despite years of lobbying from fire fighters and safety experts, according to a draft report ordered by the region's executive seen by Reuters.

The debate has been going on in Brussels for at least four years, but this month's deadly fire at the Grenfell Tower apartment block in London has highlighted a lack of fire safety regulations across the 28-member bloc.

Officials at the European Commission, the European Union's executive, were already studying the draft version of a report on whether new smoke regulations for construction materials are needed before the June 14 blaze that killed at least 80 people.

The draft, dated May, was based on around 50 interviews with regulators, industry groups and fire services, led by BRE, a British-based organisation that carries out research and testing in the building sector.

It found that there "would be limited benefits from regulating for the toxicity of smoke from construction products" and that member states should continue to decide individually whether specific rules are necessary.

It also concluded that "regulation would increase barriers to trade, increase product costs and potentially remove some products from the market".

A final version should be ready by July 17, the draft said, although the Commission said it could not confirm that date.

The Commission had asked for the report to help resolve an argument between fire safety campaigners and the plastics industry.

"Member States are free to set their own requirements for building design and safety," a Commission spokeswoman said, when asked about the report and the possibility of new regulation.

Trade body Plastics Europe says there is no evidence new rules on the toxicity of smoke from building materials would save lives. But firefighters and other safety campaigners say labelling products according to their toxicity when burned is one simple way to address a lack of clear fire safety regulations for builders in the EU.

EU officials, fire safety and industry representatives debated the draft report in Brussels on May 16.

Among those present was Richard Hull, a professor of fire science at the University of Central Lancashire in England.

"If I go to my laboratory and I develop a new insulation material which is excellent in many respects but is lethally toxic when it burns, there's no restriction on me selling that as a building product," he said.

Plastics Europe, which represents companies such as ExxonMobil , Total and BASF , said new regulations would not be useful because there are multiple factors to consider when assessing the safety of a building.

"A smoke toxicity criterion for construction products will not per se guarantee more safety in the eventuality of a fire," Plastics Europe said.

Presently, the EU only sets standards to ensure construction materials can be shipped across borders within the bloc, although EU sources said the Commission had decided long before the Grenfell fire to draw up new rules to harmonise fire-safety tests for building facades.

Police investigating the cause of London's most deadly fire since World War Two have said it started in a faulty fridge and spread rapidly because of external cladding on the 24-storey building. The cladding used has since failed safety checks and prompted a review of the materials used on British buildings ranging from hospitals to hotels to apartment blocks. [nL8N1JL04P][nL8N1JP35L]

Hull said the use of more synthetic materials in construction has made smoke more toxic, with insulation products such as polyisocyanurate (PIR) producing high yields of hydrogen cyanide and carbon monoxide when burned.

Pressure group Fire Safe Europe says around 40 percent of deaths in fires are caused directly by smoke, while a further 20 percent are caused by a combination of severe burns and smoke.

The body brings together fire fighters, representatives of the concrete and cable industries, and equipment and insulation companies including Danish-listed Rockwool and Germany's Knauf Insulation.

"Smoke is playing a crucial role in modern fire behaviour. said Brussels firefighter Pieter Maes, who attended the May meeting. "We need to take it into account in our testing of materials, to understand how smoke production from a certain material can influence how fire spreads."

Czech Member of the European Parliament Pavel Poc told Reuters his Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats group would push the Commission for specific rules on smoke.

"Testing and labelling could give the consumers the chance to choose between more or less toxic materials," he said.

S.Korea's SK Group signs MOU with GE to jointly develop U.S. shale gas - 路透新闻

{{20170629T021231.483+0000}}S.Korea's SK Group signs MOU with GE to jointly develop U.S. shale gas* Seeks to expand business in U.S. shale gas sector

* Plans to invest about $1.6 bln in U.S. over the next five years

* KOGAS signs MOU with Exxon Mobil, Energy Transfer for LNG projects

SEOUL, June 29 (Reuters) - South Korean energy conglomerate SK Group signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with General Electric on Thursday to jointly develop U.S. shale gas fields in a bid to expand in the U.S. shale gas sector.

The partnership with GE will help SK Group bring in U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) to South Korea as well as onsell it to other countries amid growing U.S. LNG exports, SK Group said in a statement.

The deal was signed a day ahead of a planned summit meeting between South Korean President Moon Jae-in and U.S. President Donald Trump in Washington.

South Korea, the world's second-biggest LNG importer, has encouraged local gas companies to invest in U.S. gas projects amid expectations that more opportunities will arise under a Trump administration. [nL4N1EH2KX]

SK Group said it planned to invest 1.8 trillion won ($1.6 billion) in the United States over the next five years and would seek up to 5 trillion won worth of potential investment opportunities.

The investment would also help the United States export about 2 trillion won of U.S.-origin LNG per year and narrow a trade gap between the two countries, the company said in the statement.

Also on Thursday, Korea Gas Corp <036460.KS>, the world's second-biggest LNG buyer, said it signed an MOU with U.S. companies including Exxon Mobil and Energy Transfer for cooperation in U.S. LNG projects.

UPDATE 1-Shell, Exxon to appeal latest Groningen gas production cap - 路透新闻

{{20170628T111410.889+0000}}UPDATE 1-Shell, Exxon to appeal latest Groningen gas production cap(Updates with details from press conference)

By Bart H. Meijer

AMSTERDAM, June 28 (Reuters) - A joint venture between Royal Dutch Shell and Exxon Mobil said on Wednesday it would appeal against a Dutch government plan to lower a production cap at the Groningen natural gas field by a further 10 percent.

The Dutch government has lowered production at Groningen several times over the past three years due to small earthquakes triggered by work there.

The latest cap, announced in May, would lower production to 21.6 billion cubic metres (bcm) per year from October. It was 53.9 bcm in 2013.

The 50-50 Exxon-Shell joint venture, known as NAM, said it had been left in an impossible position by being told it could continue production - vital to supply homes with gas - but without guarantees it is meeting safety standards.

NAM cited one paragraph of the government's May production decision in particular as troubling: "There is no model that can predict at which level of production the seismic risks align with the safety norms."

"We need to know the rules of the game," NAM director Gerald Schotman told reporters. "Models based on independent research have been shoved aside."

Schotman said last year's production plan used estimates of scenarios put together by a panel of scientists and then subjected to independent review by peers - the way the Dutch government determines acceptable levels of risk in other areas, such as the safety of its dikes and flood defenses.

NAM's appeal will be heard starting July 13 at the Council of State, along with appeals by environmentalists who think the latest cap did not go far enough.

TCO will start first LPG shipments to Ukraine in July--traders  - 路透新闻

{{20170628T110123.491+0000}}TCO will start first LPG shipments to Ukraine in July--traders June 28 (Reuters) - Tengizchevroil (TCO), Kazakhstan's biggest producer of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), will start test LPG shipments in July to the Ukrainian domestic market, industry sources said.

TCO previously only sent LPG in transit through Ukraine to the Black Sea port of Odessa and via land border crossings to Poland and other eastern European countries, the sources said. Talks on LPG supplies to Ukraine, which became a more high-reward market in 2016 compared to traditional routes, have been held for around a year.

"(They) signed a spot contract, more likely, for a month. Talks are being held about a term (long-term) contract," a source familiar with the negotiations told Reuters.

He also said that LPG will be delivered to SOCAR Ukraine, a Ukrainian subsidiary of Azerbaijan's state oil company SOCAR.

An export-parity price for LPG supplies from Russia to Ukraine was on average $105-$115 per tonne higher than to Poland in 2016 and $70-80 per tonne higher than via Black Sea ports, Reuters calculations showed.

TCO's test 300-400 tonne spot railway cargo for SOCAR Ukraine will be loaded in July via the Solovey-Topoli border crossing with a premium on technical propane butane mixture on DAP Ukraine basis (Russian-Ukrainian border), traders said.

The size of the premium hasn't been disclosed, but Reuters monitoring showed that the difference between average spot prices of technical propane butane mixture at the Russia-Ukraine border and those on DAP Brest basis was $8 per tonne in favour of the Ukrainian market in the first half of the year.

Another confirmation that TCO will start LPG supplies to Ukraine are shippers' monthly nominations, which Thomson Reuters Eikon publishes weekly. A total of 410 tonnes of liquefied gas, including 180 tonnes of butane and 230 tonnes of propane, will be shipped from the Kulsary station in Kazakhstan to the Ukrainian station of Spartak in the first ten days of July, according to the nominations.

Market participants said SOCAR Ukraine has an agreement to store liquefied gas at the Makarovskaya LPG dispensing station (Spartak station), which is managed by UPK Group, a big player on the Ukrainian wholesale and retail LPG market.

TCO's LPG production rose to 595,237 tonnes in January-May this year, up 6.7 percent from a year earlier.

The company also ramped up LPG exports by nine percent to 549,177 tonnes in the first five months of the year compared to the same period last year.

The main export routes for TCO's LPG in the western direction in January-May 2017 are to the port of Odessa (169,079 tonnes), Poland (128,410 tonnes), the Russian port of Taman (101,940 tonnes) and Hungary (59,986).

TCO also supplies liquefied gas to China with exports reaching 44,272 tonnes in the first five months of the year.

Last October the world's largest independent oil trader Vitol started exports of TCO's LPG, which it received under an advance contract with one of the company's shareholders, Kazakhstan's state oil and gas company KazMunaiGas, which is looking for new profitable export routes because of the economic downturn.

Shareholders in Tengizchevroil are U.S. Chevron (50 percent) and ExxonMobil (25 percent), KazMunaiGas (20 percent) and Lukarco, a subsidiary of Russia's Lukoil , (5 percent).

By Catherine Ngai

NEW YORK, June 28 (Reuters) - U.S. pipeline operators are
selling their underused space at steep discounts to keep crude
flowing - angering shippers and distorting an already opaque
market for oil trading.

Pipeline firms such as Plains All American  and
TransCanada Corp  move about 10 million barrels of crude
around the United States every day.

For pipeline operators to secure financing to build
pipelines and storage facilities, they need oil producers,
refiners and traders to sign long-term contracts to use space on
the pipelines.

Pipeline firms can then use the guaranteed revenue from
those contracts as collateral. Firms shipping on the pipeline
have historically benefited from the long-term deals because
they offered a discount compared to the price of buying space
occasionally.

But now, in the wake of a two-year oil price crash, pipeline
firms are still struggling to keep their lines full. So their
marketing arms are offering steep discounts to ad-hoc buyers of
pipeline capacity - which irritates customers whose long-term
contracts are now more expensive than spot purchases.

"If I were a producer with a long-term contract, I would be
very unhappy at the present time," said Rick Smead, managing
director of advisory services at RBN Energy in Houston. "But,
the reality is that when they (signed contracts), they were
trapped."

Eight pipeline operators contacted by Reuters for this story
declined to comment on their discounted spot pricing or the
secondary market for pipeline capacity.

Some of those pipeline firms are offering prices as low as
25 percent of federally regulated rates, creating a secondary
market that undercuts shippers with long-term contracts,
according to four sources at companies that regularly ship on
the pipelines.

For a graphic detailing how the discount deals work, see: http://tmsnrt.rs/2sJwW5E

The discounts emerged after a global glut and crashing oil
prices caused many shippers to let their pipeline contracts
lapse or declare bankruptcy.

More than a dozen producers, traders and refiners told
Reuters they were angry and frustrated that these discount deals
have become a mainstay. They declined to be named because they
were not authorized to speak publicly.

The contract and regulatory framework of the industry makes
it difficult for them to bargain down their own long-term
contracts, leaving them paying more for the pipeline space than
occasional shippers competing to send oil through the same
lines.

This gives the occasional shippers the edge in delivering
cheaper crude to potential buyers at the end of the line.

DEEP DISCOUNTS

TransCanada's 700,000 barrel-per-day Cushing-Marketlink
pipeline - which carries oil from Cushing, Oklahoma, to Texas
refineries - has long-term rates of between $1.63 and $2.93 a
barrel to transport heavy crude, while occasional shippers
typically paid $3.

The industry downturn since 2014 has reduced demand from
occasional shippers to use the line at that price.

Earlier this year, TransCanada's marketing arm offered
customers the right to send crude through the line at a tariff
of between 80 to 90 cents, traders using the line said.

At the end of 2016, the rate offered was as low 30 to 40
cents. Even with the discounts, the line rarely reached 70
percent capacity.

TransCanada declined to comment.

Pipeline operators agree to charge specific tariffs for
sending oil through the lines when they sign long-term contracts
with oil shippers.

Those rates are known as committed tariffs, and are subject
to approval by the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
(FERC). The FERC also reviews the rates paid by occasional
shippers, known as uncommitted tariffs.

The FERC declined to comment on the secondary market and on
the tariffs that the marketing arms of pipeline operators are
charging in that market.

AGGRESSIVE MARKETING

Most of the 10 largest U.S. pipeline operators - such as
Enbridge  and Enterprise Products Partners  -
have established their own marketing or trading arms that are
reselling space.

Last year, TransCanada - which operates the massive Keystone
pipeline system - became the most recent player to open a unit
to trade oil and resell pipeline space.

A few, such as Plains, have had marketing arms for more than
a decade, but in the past they had mostly just sold or traded
space that went unused by major producers who had committed to
long-term contracts.

On lines such as TransCanada's, big producers such as
ExxonMobil  and Suncor Energy  account for up to 90
percent of the flow in a pipeline. The remaining 10 percent is
sold to occasional shippers.

Suncor and ExxonMobil declined to comment.

With the three-year rout in oil, the volume accounted for in
long-term contracts has fallen, and the marketing arms have gone
from simply selling occasional space to needing to make big
deals to fill the lines.

The practice has become so widespread that even pipeline
operators who had previously said they disliked the emergence of
the secondary market have now joined the fray.

Magellan Midstream Partners , for instance, in
November applied to the FERC to establish a marketing arm,
citing the more favorable terms other firms can offer customers.
The move came after Magellan had declined for years to run its
own operation out of fear that it would compete with its own
customers.

The secondary market is formed by marketing firms signing up
to long-term contracts with their parent companies, the pipeline
owners. The marketing firms become like committed customers to
the line, and pay the same rates for the space as the firms with
long-term contracts.

Those marketing firms book a paper loss for shipping the
volumes at a discount. But the sales keep the pipelines more
full - which makes the parent firm look better to investors, who
use pipeline volume as a key metric to judge those firms.

Some companies have felt the pinch of the paper losses.
Genesis Energy LP  - a Houston-based midstream firm with
a market cap of $3.6 billion - said its supply and logistics
unit saw fourth-quarter revenues fall by 15 percent from a year
earlier.

The company's Chief Executive Grant Sims, during a recent
earnings call, cited "volume cannibalization" for the decline,
saying that it was forced to compete in a market in which
participants were willing to lose money.

Genesis declined to comment further to Reuters.

Ed Longanecker president of the Texas Independent Producers
& Royalty Owners Association, said tensions between producers
and midstream firms become more strained in a low-price
environment, with producers "at the mercy of an extremely
competitive market."

Shell, Exxon to appeal latest Groningen gas production cap - 路透新闻

{{20170628T090847.933+0000}}Shell, Exxon to appeal latest Groningen gas production capAMSTERDAM, June 28 (Reuters) - A joint venture between Royal Dutch Shell and Exxon Mobil said on Wednesday it will file an appeal against a Dutch government plan to lower a production cap at the Groningen natural gas field by a further 10 percent.

The 50-50 Exxon-Shell joint venture, known as NAM, said it has been left in an impossible position by being told it may continue production -- vital to supply homes with gas -- without guarantees it is meeting safety standards. It also opposes the latest, lowered production cap.

The Dutch government has capped production at Groningen due to small earthquakes triggered by work there.

The latest cap announced in May would lower production to 21.6 billion cubic metres (bcm) per year from October, down from 53.9 bcm in 2013.

NAM's appeal will be heard starting July 13 at the Council of State, along with appeals by environmentalists who think the latest cap did not go far enough.

By Jessica Resnick-Ault

THUNDER HORSE OIL PLATFORM, Gulf of Mexico, June 27 (Reuters) - A bout 300 BP workers commute 150 miles here by helicopter, from the Louisiana coast to a deep-sea drilling platform that can produce more oil in a day than a West Texas rig can pump in a year.

On the deck of Thunder Horse, they work two-week shifts, drink seawater from a desalination plant, and eat ribs and chicken ferried in by boat. On the ocean floor, robots provide remote eyes and arms as drills extract up to 265,000 barrels per day.

"There's a whole city below us," said Jim Pearl, Marine Team Leader on the platform.

This is just one of the four Gulf of Mexico platforms on which BP has staked its future in U.S. oil production.

Seven years after its Deepwater Horizon explosion and oil spill, BP is betting tens of billions of dollars on the prospect that it can slash the costs of offshore drilling by half or more - just as shale oil producers have done onshore.

The firm says it can do that while it continues to pay an estimated $61 billion in total costs and damages from the worst spill in history - and without compromising safety.

BP's Gulf platforms are key to a global strategy calling for up to $17 billion in annual investments through 2021 to increase production by about 5 percent each year, Chief Executive Officer Bob Dudley recently told investors.

"Our strategy is to take this investment that we spent so much money building, and keep it full" to the platform's capacity, Richard Morrison, BP's regional president for the Gulf of Mexico, told Reuters during the first tour of a BP Gulf drilling platform since the disaster. "We're also exploring for larger pools of oil."

BP's deepwater double-down is all the more striking for the contrast to its chief competitors, who have cooled on offshore investments in light of the lower costs and quicker returns of onshore shale plays.

While BP has some onshore U.S. developments, the firm is notably absent from the industry's rush into shale oil fields of the West Texas Permian Basin.[nL1N1FM1EO]

Majors including Exxon Mobil Corp , Chevron Corp and Royal Dutch Shell have maintained Gulf operations but focused expansions on U.S. shale. Exxon Mobil doubled its acreage in the Permian in a deal earlier this year.

Freeport-McMoRan and Devon Energy Corp have pulled out of Gulf drilling entirely in recent years. Anadarko Petroleum Corp took a $435-million dollar write-down in May on its Shenandoah project in the Gulf, deciding it could not profit with oil prices hovering at about $50 a barrel.

"In a $50 to $60 world, we always felt like greenfield development, in the Gulf in particular, was fairly challenged," Anadarko CEO Al Walker told investors last month.

Oil prices dropped steeply last week, settling in the low $40s per barrel.

BP says its next Gulf development - the $9 billion Mad Dog phase two - would be profitable even at $40 a barrel. As recently as 2013, BP reported that it could not start new deepwater Gulf projects at prices lower than $100 a barrel.

A BILLION BARRELS

In time, BP's offshore expansion could produce a huge payoff. The firm announced last month that it had discovered an additional billion barrels of oil below its four audaciously named Gulf platforms - Thunder Horse, Atlantis, Na Kika and Mad Dog.

The find - worth more than $40 billion at today's market prices - amounts to more than three times the proven reserves at the Na Kika field, or the equivalent of three new fields in the Gulf.

"It seems like every ten years there's another breakthrough" that unlocks more Gulf oil, Morrison said on the deck of Thunder Horse.

Over his shoulder, a drillship three miles away tapped a new well that will feed production into the massive platform.

In the wake of the 2010 BP disaster, deepwater production was curtailed by a six-month U.S. government moratorium on drilling and a longer period of uncertainty about regulation. But output has rebounded to new record highs as projects sanctioned years ago start operations and existing hubs such as Thunder Horse expand.

BP's big new discovery is key to its slashing of estimated per-barrel costs, as are a host of drilling innovations and more favorable deals with service providers.

For eight decades, geologists have used seismic imaging to estimate oil and gas reserves beneath the rocky undersea terrain.

BP used its own new technology for the billion-barrel discovery. Called full waveform inversion, the technique uses massive amounts of data to create a high-resolution model of reserves that were previously hidden beneath salt deposits.

The firm also aims to tap those reserves without building new multi-billion-dollar platforms.

At Thunder Horse and other platforms, BP is installing wellheads on the seabed and connecting them to pipelines that rise up to existing platforms, like the legs of a spider.

These "tiebacks" allow producers to feed oil from remote regions of fields that previously went untapped.

Other design changes helped BP hold down the investment in Mad Dog's second phase from an initially estimated $20 billion to just $9 billion, the company said. Such savings are part of the equation BP uses to estimate the platform's profitability at oil prices of $40 a barrel.

The struggles of deepwater oil service firms - who were forced to cut prices after per-barrel prices tanked in 2014 - are also keeping BP's expansion costs low.

"If you're going to be building an offshore Gulf of Mexico platform, now is the time to be doing it," said Norm MacDonald, portfolio manager for Invesco's energy fund, which has increased its stake in BP, its second-largest holding.

Other funds remain leery of offshore investments because of the longer wait for a return in a volatile industry.

Shale has a "liquidity premium" because producers can make smaller investments and recoup them sooner, within two or three years, said Michael Roomberg, a portfolio analyst at Miller-Howard Investments.

Tie-backs and other advances, however, could accelerate deepwater returns and help narrow the liquidity gap with shale, MacDonald said.

COST CUTTING, SAFETY CONCERNS

BP's growing deepwater investments irk some environmentalists, who say the company has fought paying what it owes to restore shorelines and communities damaged by its massive spill.

They also see the threat of another disaster.

"They never really fulfilled those promises, and people are very skeptical about them expanding drilling," said Raleigh Hoke, campaign director at Gulf Restoration Network in New Orleans.

Richard Sears - who served as chief scientist on the National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling - said such projects can be managed safely at low oil prices.

The causes of the BP disaster had more to do with poor decision-making and slipshod safety systems than cost-cutting, said Sears, who previously managed production projects at Shell.

BP said it has bolstered safety operations globally since the spill, introducing a safety and operational risk staff with 800 positions and an internal global wells organization to standardize drilling practices, among other measures. The company says it cannot precisely estimate new spending on safety since the spill because its efforts are integrated into many parts of the company.

In a glassed-in drilling shack on the Thunder Horse platform, operators stay connected to a new onshore command center in Houston that BP designed to monitor data from offshore wells.

On the deck below sits a blowout preventer, a room-sized piece of equipment that would soon be fitted on the wellhead of a drilling site, two miles under water.

But first it would need a safety inspection - unlike the blowout preventer that infamously failed to contain the 2010 spill, which federal regulators have said had not been inspected in years.

INSIGHT-In disaster's wake, BP doubles down on deepwater despite surging shale - 路透新闻

{{20170627T050002.205+0000}}INSIGHT-In disaster's wake, BP doubles down on deepwater despite surging shaleBy Jessica Resnick-Ault

THUNDER HORSE OIL PLATFORM, Gulf of Mexico, June 27 (Reuters) - A bout 300 BP workers commute 150 miles here by helicopter, from the Louisiana coast to a deep-sea drilling platform that can produce more oil in a day than a West Texas rig can pump in a year.

On the deck of Thunder Horse, they work two-week shifts, drink seawater from a desalination plant, and eat ribs and chicken ferried in by boat. On the ocean floor, robots provide remote eyes and arms as drills extract up to 265,000 barrels per day.

"There's a whole city below us," said Jim Pearl, Marine Team Leader on the platform.

This is just one of the four Gulf of Mexico platforms on which BP has staked its future in U.S. oil production.

Seven years after its Deepwater Horizon explosion and oil spill, BP is betting tens of billions of dollars on the prospect that it can slash the costs of offshore drilling by half or more - just as shale oil producers have done onshore.

The firm says it can do that while it continues to pay an estimated $61 billion in total costs and damages from the worst spill in history - and without compromising safety.

BP's Gulf platforms are key to a global strategy calling for up to $17 billion in annual investments through 2021 to increase production by about 5 percent each year, Chief Executive Officer Bob Dudley recently told investors.

"Our strategy is to take this investment that we spent so much money building, and keep it full" to the platform's capacity, Richard Morrison, BP's regional president for the Gulf of Mexico, told Reuters during the first tour of a BP Gulf drilling platform since the disaster. "We're also exploring for larger pools of oil."

BP's deepwater double-down is all the more striking for the contrast to its chief competitors, who have cooled on offshore investments in light of the lower costs and quicker returns of onshore shale plays.

While BP has some onshore U.S. developments, the firm is notably absent from the industry's rush into shale oil fields of the West Texas Permian Basin.[nL1N1FM1EO]

Majors including Exxon Mobil Corp , Chevron Corp and Royal Dutch Shell have maintained Gulf operations but focused expansions on U.S. shale. Exxon Mobil doubled its acreage in the Permian in a deal earlier this year.

Freeport-McMoRan and Devon Energy Corp have pulled out of Gulf drilling entirely in recent years. Anadarko Petroleum Corp took a $435-million dollar write-down in May on its Shenandoah project in the Gulf, deciding it could not profit with oil prices hovering at about $50 a barrel.

"In a $50 to $60 world, we always felt like greenfield development, in the Gulf in particular, was fairly challenged," Anadarko CEO Al Walker told investors last month.

Oil prices dropped steeply last week, settling in the low $40s per barrel.

BP says its next Gulf development - the $9 billion Mad Dog phase two - would be profitable even at $40 a barrel. As recently as 2013, BP reported that it could not start new deepwater Gulf projects at prices lower than $100 a barrel.

A BILLION BARRELS

In time, BP's offshore expansion could produce a huge payoff. The firm announced last month that it had discovered an additional billion barrels of oil below its four audaciously named Gulf platforms - Thunder Horse, Atlantis, Na Kika and Mad Dog.

The find - worth more than $40 billion at today's market prices - amounts to more than three times the proven reserves at the Na Kika field, or the equivalent of three new fields in the Gulf.

"It seems like every ten years there's another breakthrough" that unlocks more Gulf oil, Morrison said on the deck of Thunder Horse.

Over his shoulder, a drillship three miles away tapped a new well that will feed production into the massive platform.

In the wake of the 2010 BP disaster, deepwater production was curtailed by a six-month U.S. government moratorium on drilling and a longer period of uncertainty about regulation. But output has rebounded to new record highs as projects sanctioned years ago start operations and existing hubs such as Thunder Horse expand.

BP's big new discovery is key to its slashing of estimated per-barrel costs, as are a host of drilling innovations and more favorable deals with service providers.

For eight decades, geologists have used seismic imaging to estimate oil and gas reserves beneath the rocky undersea terrain.

BP used its own new technology for the billion-barrel discovery. Called full waveform inversion, the technique uses massive amounts of data to create a high-resolution model of reserves that were previously hidden beneath salt deposits.

The firm also aims to tap those reserves without building new multi-billion-dollar platforms.

At Thunder Horse and other platforms, BP is installing wellheads on the seabed and connecting them to pipelines that rise up to existing platforms, like the legs of a spider.

These "tiebacks" allow producers to feed oil from remote regions of fields that previously went untapped.

Other design changes helped BP hold down the investment in Mad Dog's second phase from an initially estimated $20 billion to just $9 billion, the company said. Such savings are part of the equation BP uses to estimate the platform's profitability at oil prices of $40 a barrel.

The struggles of deepwater oil service firms - who were forced to cut prices after per-barrel prices tanked in 2014 - are also keeping BP's expansion costs low.

"If you're going to be building an offshore Gulf of Mexico platform, now is the time to be doing it," said Norm MacDonald, portfolio manager for Invesco's energy fund, which has increased its stake in BP, its second-largest holding.

Other funds remain leery of offshore investments because of the longer wait for a return in a volatile industry.

Shale has a "liquidity premium" because producers can make smaller investments and recoup them sooner, within two or three years, said Michael Roomberg, a portfolio analyst at Miller-Howard Investments.

Tie-backs and other advances, however, could accelerate deepwater returns and help narrow the liquidity gap with shale, MacDonald said.

COST CUTTING, SAFETY CONCERNS

BP's growing deepwater investments irk some environmentalists, who say the company has fought paying what it owes to restore shorelines and communities damaged by its massive spill.

They also see the threat of another disaster.

"They never really fulfilled those promises, and people are very skeptical about them expanding drilling," said Raleigh Hoke, campaign director at Gulf Restoration Network in New Orleans.

Richard Sears - who served as chief scientist on the National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling - said such projects can be managed safely at low oil prices.

The causes of the BP disaster had more to do with poor decision-making and slipshod safety systems than cost-cutting, said Sears, who previously managed production projects at Shell.

BP said it has bolstered safety operations globally since the spill, introducing a safety and operational risk staff with 800 positions and an internal global wells organization to standardize drilling practices, among other measures. The company says it cannot precisely estimate new spending on safety since the spill because its efforts are integrated into many parts of the company.

In a glassed-in drilling shack on the Thunder Horse platform, operators stay connected to a new onshore command center in Houston that BP designed to monitor data from offshore wells.

On the deck below sits a blowout preventer, a room-sized piece of equipment that would soon be fitted on the wellhead of a drilling site, two miles under water.

But first it would need a safety inspection - unlike the blowout preventer that infamously failed to contain the 2010 spill, which federal regulators have said had not been inspected in years.

* Mouvement en faveur des SECTEURS défensifs

* Prises de profits sur les valeurs technologiques

* Le Dow gagne 0,07% et le S&P 0,03%, le Nasdaq cède 0,29%

par Caroline Valetkevitch

NEW YORK, 26 juin (Reuters) - Wall Street a fini sur une note quasiment stable lundi, freinée par un repli des valeurs technologiques au profit de valeurs plus défensives comme les services collectifs et les télécoms.

L'indice Dow Jones <.DJI> a grignoté 14,79 points, soit 0,07%, à 21.409,55. Le S&P-500 <.SPX>, plus large, a pris 0,77 point, soit 0,03%, à 2.439,07. Le Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> a reculé de son côté de 18,10 points (-0,29%) à 6.247,15 points.

Les indices des services collectifs <.SPLRCU> (+0,78%) et des télécoms <.SPLRCL> (+0,62%) sont arrivés en tête du S&P.

"Le marché obligataire signale un ralentissement économique", souligne Paul Nolte, gérant chez Kingsview Asset Management. "C'est la raison pour laquelle nous assistons à une bonne performance des titres défensifs comme les services aux collectivités par exemple, parce que les investisseurs achètent en fonction de ce que dit le marché obligataire."

En revanche, l'indice des valeurs technologiques <.SPLRCT> (-0,59%) a accusé la plus forte baisse sectorielle. Les pertes de Microsoft (-0,95%), Amazon (-0,97%) et Alphabet (-1,42%) ont notamment pesé sur le Nasdaq.

"Ce ne sont que des prises de profits de fin de trimestre. Je ne serais pas surpris de voir l'inverse début juillet, dans la perspective de bons résultats", dit de son côté Tim Ghriskey, responsable de l'investissement chez Solaris Asset Management.

"Nous assistons à une rotation très rapide ces derniers mois," note Art Hogan, chargé de la stratégie chez Wunderlich Securities, qui explique ces mouvements par les discours de responsables de la Fed annonçant de nouvelles hausses de taux.

Face aux perspectives toujours incertaines du resserrement de la politique monétaire de la Réserve fédérale, les investisseurs attendent cette semaine les discours de plusieurs autres responsables de la banque, dont Janet Yellen mardi.

DISCOURS DE YELLEN MARDI

John Williams, le président de la Fed de San Francisco, a plaidé pour une poursuite des hausses graduelles de taux afin d'éviter une surchauffe de l'économie. [nL8N1JN2VS]

Le président de la Fed de New York, William Dudley, a déclaré pour sa part que la récente réduction de l'écart de taux, les niveaux records en Bourse et la baisse des rendements obligataires pourraient encourager la banque centrale américaine à poursuivre la normalisation de sa politique monétaire.

Aux valeurs individuelles, Arconic a chuté de 5,99%, la plus forte baisse du S&P-500, après les informations suggérant que le groupe industriel était informé des risques liés à l'emploi de panneaux de sa fabrication dans la rénovation de la tour Grenfell de Londres, dont l'incendie a fait 79 morts.

Avis Budget en revanche s'est adjugé 14,15% à la suite de l'annonce d'un partenariat sur plusieurs années avec Alphabet pour gérer sa flotte croissante de voitures autonomes.

Hertz grimpe aussi, de 13,52%, après l'annonce d'un partenariat de même type avec Apple qui va lui louer une petite flotte pour tester sa technologie de conduite autonome.

Le pétrole est en hausse pour la troisième séance consécutive, s'éloignant des plus bas de sept mois touchés la semaine dernière, même si l'augmentation continue de l'offre américaine et le niveau des stocks mondiaux limitent le rebond.

Le brut léger (West Texas Intermediate, WTI) se traite à 43,39 dollars le baril et le Brent à 45,86 dollars . Mais l'indice S&P de l'énergie <.SPNY> a cédé 0,24%, avec Exxon (-0,45%) et Chevron (-0,82%).

Sur le marché des changes, le dollar a touché un pic d'un mois face au yen et a légèrement rebondi face à l'euro après un discours du président de la Banque centrale européenne, Mario Draghi, défendant sa politique ultra-accommodante et en attendant les déclarations de Janet Yellen mardi.

Le billet vert prend 0,15% face à un panier de devises de référence et est remonté à 1,1183 pour un euro .

La livre sterling , elle, a profité face aux autres grandes devises de l'accord de gouvernement signé par la Première ministre britannique, Theresa May, avec le parti unioniste nord-irlandais DUP, qui lui assure une majorité au Parlement. [nL8N1JN0PH]

L'annonce d'un repli inattendu des commandes de biens durables aux Etats-Unis le mois dernier a pesé sur les rendements des emprunts d'Etat, le 10 ans étant revenu sous 2,13% et le 30 ans sous 2,70% , au plus bas depuis le 9 novembre. [nL8N1JN2VS]

ACTUALIZA 1-México avala contenido de hasta 10 pct de etanol en gasolinas pese oposición ambientalistas - 路透新闻

{{20170626T213014.074+0000}}ACTUALIZA 1-México avala contenido de hasta 10 pct de etanol en gasolinas pese oposición ambientalistas(Añade postura de opositores y de productores de etanol de EEUU)

Por Adriana Barrera

CIUDAD DE MÉXICO, 26 jun (Reuters) - México dio luz verde el lunes para aumentar desde un 5.8 por ciento a hasta un 10 por ciento el tope del contenido de etanol en las gasolinas que se consumen en el país, pese a la oposición de ambientalistas que aseguran que disparará la contaminación.

La medida, que entrará en vigencia el martes y aplicará para las gasolinas y no al diesel, excluye a las zonas metropolitanas del Valle de México; de Guadalajara, en el occidente del país, y la de Monterrey, en el norte, pero se permitirá en el resto del territorio, según un aviso publicado por la Comisión Reguladora de Energía (CRE).

La CRE dijo que el cambio, que forma parte de modificaciones a la norma mexicana para combustibles, la NOM-016, permitirá a los expendedores locales de gasolinas importar el producto con características similares a las de Estados Unidos.

"Las estaciones de servicio en territorio nacional no cuentan con la posibilidad de ofrecer gasolinas similares a las que se comercializan en los Estados Unidos de América ya que la Norma prohíbe que dichas gasolinas se comercialicen en México", dijo la CRE en el acuerdo, publicado en el Diario Oficial.

"Esta situación, además de ser una desventaja para los expendedores ya establecidos en México, representa una barrera de entrada para quienes pretenden importar a territorio nacional, las gasolinas utilizadas en los Estados Unidos de América", añadió.

Grupos ambientalistas han dicho que elevar la cantidad de etanol disparará la contaminación en México, que ha importado por años grandes cantidades de combustibles de Estados Unidos.

"El etanol es un precusor del ozono, que ha provocado contingencias en la Ciudad de México pero también en otras urbes que sufren problemas de contaminación", dijo Anaid Velasco, coordinadora de investigación del Centro Mexicano de Derecho Ambiental (Cemda).

Velasco dijo que la CRE no tomó en cuenta los argumentos de opositores, como el gobierno de la Ciudad de México y la propia Secretaría del Medio Ambiente federal, además de que llevó un proceso muy acelerado para modificar la norma.

La Comisión dijo que el cambio, que forma parte de modificaciones a la norma mexicana para combustibles, la NOM-016, permitirá a los expendedores locales de gasolinas importar el producto con características similares a las de Estados Unidos.

"Las estaciones de servicio en territorio nacional no cuentan con la posibilidad de ofrecer gasolinas similares a las que se comercializan en los Estados Unidos de América ya que la Norma prohíbe que dichas gasolinas se comercialicen en México", dijo la CRE en el acuerdo, publicado en el Diario Oficial.

"Esta situación, además de ser una desventaja para los expendedores ya establecidos en México, representa una barrera de entrada para quienes pretenden importar a territorio nacional, las gasolinas utilizadas en los Estados Unidos de América", añadió.

Grupos ambientalistas han dicho que elevar la cantidad de etanol disparará la contaminación en México, que ha importado por años grandes cantidades de combustibles de Estados Unidos.

Hasta ahora, las compras las ha hecho Pemex pero se espera que otros jugadores comiencen a hacerlo aprovechando la reforma energética que abrió toda la cadena de los hidrocarburos a otras empresas diferentes a la petrolera estatal.

Firmas como Exxon y BP han anunciado planes para abrir gasolineras en México y se espera que otras muchas sigan sus pasos. En el país hay más de 11,000 estaciones pero las autoridades han dicho que es necesario elevar el número. [ID:nL2N1IJ0VW] [ID:nL2N1GM2IA]

L'émir du Qatar a rencontré le P-DG d'Exxon Mobil à Doha - 路透新闻

{{20170625T143937.627+0000}}L'émir du Qatar a rencontré le P-DG d'Exxon Mobil à Doha25 juin (Reuters) - L'émir du Qatar a rencontré le P-DG d'Exxon Mobil samedi à Doha pour une discussion portant sur une "coopération", a rapporté l'agence de presse publique QNA dans un contexte d'inquiétudes sur des livraisons énergétiques en provenance du pays, mis au ban par ses voisins.

Depuis le 5 juin, l'Arabie saoudite, l'Egypte, Bahreïn et les Emirats arabes unis ont rompu leurs relations avec le Qatar, accusant notamment Doha de soutenir des organisations classées touristes, ce que dément le pays. [nL8N1JL0D9], [nL8N1JK0EW]

Selon l'agence QNA, le cheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani s'est entretenu avec Darren Woods dans son palais d'Al-Bahar.

"Pendant la réunion, ils ont discuté des relations en matière de coopération bilatérale et des moyens de les développer (...)", poursuit QNA.

Cela fait plus de dix ans que le Qatar et Exxon Mobil ont noué un partenariat, le géant pétrolier américain ayant aidé le pays à devenir le premier exportateur mondial de gaz naturel liquéfié (GNL).

Plus tôt dans le mois, Exxon Mobbil a dit que, à ce stade, la production et les exportations du GNL qatari n'étaient pas affectées par les frictions diplomatiques.

Mais cela n'empêche pas certains de s'inquiéter de l'accès au GNL du Qatar surtout après que des ports du Golfe ont dit qu'ils n'accepteraient pas l'entrée de navires battant pavillon qatari.

FOKUS 1-Erdogan nennt Forderungen von Golfstaaten an Katar unrechtmäßig - 路透新闻

{{20170625T110240.630+0000}}FOKUS 1-Erdogan nennt Forderungen von Golfstaaten an Katar unrechtmäßig* Erdogan: Militärbasis in Katar bleibt

* Bahrain wiederholt Forderungen an Katar

(Wochenend-ZF)

Istanbul, 25. Jun (Reuters) - Der türkische Präsident Recep Tayyip Erdogan hat die Forderungen Saudi-Arabiens und anderer arabischer Staaten zur Beendigung der Blockade von Katar als unrechtmäßig bezeichnet. Das Vorgehen verstoße gegen das Völkerrecht, sagte Erdogan am Sonntag. Die Souveränität eines Landes dürfe nicht verletzt werden. Bahrain bekräftigte dagegen die Forderungen an Katar. Dadurch solle unter anderem die Unterstützung von Terrororganisationen gestoppt werden. Die Regierung in Katar hat die Vorwürfe zurückgewiesen. Sie sicherte jedoch eine Prüfung der Forderungen zu.

Er unterstütze den Umgang Katars mit den von seinen Nachbarn gestellten Bedingungen, sagte Erdogan. Die Türkei werde nicht, wie verlangt, ihren Militärstützpunkt in Katar schließen. Sein Land habe vielmehr auch Saudi-Arabien angeboten, dort einen Stützpunkt aufzubauen, aber nie eine klare Antwort erhalten. Seit der See- und Luftblockade Katars durch die Nachbarstaaten hat die Türkei 100 Frachtflugzeuge mit Gütern in das Emirat entsandt. Auch verstärkte die Regierung in Ankara ihre Militärbasis dort.

Der Emir von Katar beriet am Samstag mit dem Chef des US-Energiekonzerns Exxon Mobil über die Lage. Das Land ist der größte Exporteur von Flüssiggas. Die US-Regierung hat sich in dem Konflikt widersprüchlich geäußert. Während Präsident Donald Trump Katar die Unterstützung von Terrorismus vorwarf, stellte das vom früheren Exxon-Chef Rex Tillerson geführte Außenministerium die Motive für den Boykott infrage.

Die Regierung in Doha hat die an sie gestellten 13 Forderungen als unrealistisch und nicht umsetzbar zurückgewiesen. Von ihr wird unter anderem verlangt, den Fernsehsender Al-Jazeera zu schließen und die Verbindungen zum Iran - dem Erzfeind Saudi-Arabiens - einzuschränken. "Die Forderungen zielten darauf ab, den Ländern der Region Stabilität zu bringen, sich nachdrücklich gegen ausländische Interventionen zu stellen und die Unterstützung von Terrororganisationen zu beenden", hieß es am Sonntag in einer Meldung der staatlichen Nachrichtenagentur Bahrains.

Qatar's emir meets Exxon Mobil Corp CEO -agency - Reuters Gulf Financial News

{{20170625T093803.740+0000}}Qatar's emir meets Exxon Mobil Corp CEO -agencyGULF-QATAR/EXXONMOBIL:Qatar's emir meets Exxon Mobil Corp CEO -agency

June 25 (Reuters) - The emir of Qatar met with Exxon Mobil Corp chairman and CEO Darren Woods in Doha on Saturday for talks on "cooperation," state news agency QNA reported, following a rift between four Gulf states and Qatar that has raised worries about energy supplies.

Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt on Monday cut ties with Qatar, accusing the country of supporting extremism. Qatar denies the allegations.

QNA said the Emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, met with Woods and ExxonMobil Qatar General Manager Alistair Routledge at the Al-Bahar Palace.

"During the meeting, they discussed bilateral cooperation relations and means to develop them in addition to the latest developments in the energy sector," the agency said.

Qatar and Exxon have had development agreements for more than a decade, with Exxon helping Qatar to become the world's largest LNG exporter. Exxon, working with government-controlled energy company Qatar Petroleum, has invested in LNG-processing plants, transport ships and related infrastructure.

Exxon said earlier this month that production and exports of liquefied natural gas from Qatar have not been affected by the row.

The growing diplomatic dispute has raised concerns about global access to Qatar's LNG, especially after some regional ports in the Gulf said they would not accept Qatari-flagged vessels.

Retired tanker transports Thailand's first-ever Urals crude - 路透新闻

{{20170623T143736.266+0000}}Retired tanker transports Thailand's first-ever Urals crudeMOSCOW/SINGAPORE, June 23 (Reuters) - A retired Tempera tanker operated by Neste Oil is on its last voyage to make the first-ever delivery of Baltic Urals crude to Thailand, where the ship will remain to be recycled, traders said and shipping reports showed.

ExxonMobil bought 100,000 tonnes of Urals, which was loaded in Primorsk on May 21 for delivery to its Esso refinery in Sri Racha in July. The shipment was possible due to low freight rates for the 15-year-old ice tanker's last voyage.

Finland's Neste Oil had no immediate comment.

An ExxonMobil spokesman said it was not company practice to discuss operational details. Exxon's Sri Racha refinery has processed Russian sweet ESPO Blend - traded in Asia-Pacific - but it will take Urals for the first time. Urals is not typically sold to Thailand because of the long distance, which makes shipping too expensive.

Although Urals arbitrage to Asia has become more common this year due to a low Brent-Dubai spread and a shortage of sour crude in the region due to OPEC output cuts, it is unlikely Urals would be viable for deliveries to Thailand, traders said. "Baltic Urals to Thailand on Aframax is just impossible if you want to make any money," a Urals market trader said. "Above all Tempera is a 1A Super ice class tanker which would make the delivery even pricier."

Traders said if Exxon had sealed a big discount for the shipment it would be viable. The freight rate for Tempera's last voyage was not available. Neste Oil currently operates two other ice class tankers - Mastera, built a year after Tempera, and Stena Arctica.

Neste Oil refineries mostly work on Urals crude oil and some North Sea crudes and the tankers operate only in the Baltic region.

UPDATE 1-Iraq's oil exports in June near May level, oil minister says  - 路透新闻

{{20170622T172608.124+0000}}UPDATE 1-Iraq's oil exports in June near May level, oil minister says (Adds details, quotes)

By Aref Mohammed

BASRA, Iraq, June 22 (Reuters) - Iraq's oil exports from fields owned by the central government in Baghdad are at around 3.27 million barrels per day (bpd) so far in June, about the same level as in May, Oil Minister Jabar al-Luaibi said on Thursday.

Total exports for all fields in Iraq, those of Baghdad and the Kurdish region in the north, have averaged 3.8 million bpd so far in June, he told Reuters in the southern oil city of Basra. The country as a whole is producing about 4.315 million bpd, he said.

Kurdish exports are running at about 520,000 to 530,000 bpd so far this month, he said.

Iraq is in "quiet negotiations" with foreign oil companies operating in Iraq to amend their services contract, he said, declining to give more details.

The country wants to change the terms of the contracts it deems no longer in its favour after oil prices collapsed three years ago, when they were in excess of $100 per barrel, to about $45 per barrel now.

Oil prices should start recovering by the end of July, to reach $54 to $56 a barrel by the end of the year, Luaibi said.

Iraq is the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries' second oil producer, after Saudi Arabia. The group in May rolled over an agreement to cut oil production with other exporting nations, until March, in order to support oil prices.

"Iraq supports the agreement that we reached; if developments happen contrary to OPEC's interests, the (OPEC) ministers will hold an extraordinary meeting," he said.

Iraq will continue developing its production capacity and will start executing a sea water injection project in its oilfields at the end of the year, even without an agreement with Exxon , he said.

"We are now in talks with Exxon Mobil, if we don't reach an agreement, we have other options," he said.

POINT MARCHÉS-Wall Street finit en ordre dispersé - 路透新闻

{{20170621T204759.770+0000}}POINT MARCHÉS-Wall Street finit en ordre dispersé(Actualisé avec des détails, éléments de change et obligataires)

* Pertes de 0,27% pour le Dow, de 0,06% pour le S&P

* Gain de 0,74% pour le Nasdaq

par Sruthi Shankar et Sinead Carew

NEW YORK, 21 juin (Reuters) - Les grands indices de Wall Street ont terminé la séance de mercredi en ordre dispersé, le Nasdaq ayant profité de la vigueur des valeurs des biotechnologies, tandis que le Dow Jones et, dans une moindre mesure, le S&P-500 ont été alourdis en premier lieu par les valeurs de l'énergie.

Le pétrole a perdu 20% de sa valeur cette année, les efforts de l'Opep et de pays producteurs non membres du cartel ne parvenant pas à libérer un marché saturé et le future sur le baril de brut WTI texan a touché en séance son plus bas niveau depuis août 2016. [nL8N1JI58H]

Il a ainsi provoqué une nouvelle saignée de l'indice de l'énergie <.SPNY> (-1,60%), qui accuse la plus mauvaise performance des 11 grands indices sectoriels du Standard & Poor's depuis le début de l'année, avec une perte de plus de 14%, alors que le S&P lui-même affiche un gain de 8,83%.

Dans le compartiment des pétrolières, Chevron laisse 1,9% et Exxon Mobil 1,1%.

"Je pense qu'il y a une scission entre court terme et long terme. Il est évident que jusqu'à présent optimisme ambiant et résultats ont soutenu les cours mais l'or noir a peut-être gâté quelque peu le sentiment à court terme", a dit Terry Sandven (U.S. Bank Wealth Management).

"Si le pétrole tombe à moins de 40 dollars, il y aura des pressions sur l'ensemble des résultats et pas seulement sur ceux du secteur de l'énergie".

L'indice Dow Jones <.DJI> a perdu 57,11 points, soit 0,27%, à 21.410,03 points. Le S&P-500 <.SPX>, plus large, a cédé 1,42 point (0,06%) à 2.435,61 points. Le Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> a gagné 45,92 points (0,74%) à 6.233,95 points.

Il reste la question de la Réserve fédérale qui préoccupe toujours le marché, le rythme des futures hausses des taux étant fonction de l'évolution de l'inflation.

Robert Kaplan et Charles Evans, les présidents des Fed de Dallas et de Chicago respectivement, n'aiment pas l'inflation actuelle qui leur paraît trop faible et qui persiste à rester en deçà de l'objectif de 2% de la banque centrale.

Eric Rosengren, leur homologue de la Fed de Boston, juge que le contexte de taux très bas aux Etats-Unis est risqué pour la stabilité financière.

En dehors de cela, l'indice des biotechnologiques du Nasdaq <.NBI> a gagné 4,05%, porté par les gains de valeurs telles que Celgene , Regeneron et Biogen qui ont gagné de 4,7% à 5,4%. Son gain est de 8% depuis le début de la semaine.

L'indice S&P de la santé <.SPXHC> a gagné lui 1,23%, plus fort gain sectoriel de la séance. Il a avancé de plus de 15% depuis le début de l'année.

Ces valeurs profitent d'articles de presse suivant lesquels l'initiative du président Donald Trump en vue de faire baisser les prix des médicaments ne serait pas aussi négative que ça pour le secteur pharmaceutique.

Un article du New York Times publié mardi laissait même supposer que Trump assouplirait la réglementation le gouvernant, alors que le Sénat se prépare à présenter jeudi son texte de réforme du secteur de la santé.

Enfin, les valeurs de la santé bénéficient d'une rotation des placements des investisseurs, au détriment des valeurs high techs qui ont été attaquées récemment, alors que leur indice sectoriel <.SPLRCT> a gagné 19% environ depuis le début de l'année.

Aux valeurs, Adobe Systems a pris 2,4%, le concepteur de Photoshop ayant annoncé mardi un bénéfice trimestriel supérieur aux attentes en raison d'une hausse des abonnements à son service Creative Cloud, qui intègre entre autres le très populaire logiciel de graphisme. [nL8N1JH6GW]

FedEx , qui a annoncé mardi un bénéfice trimestriel plus élevé que prévu, retirant les fruits de l'acquisition de TNT Express et d'une hausse des ventes sur l'ensemble de ses segments d'activité, a lui progressé de 1,6%. [nL8N1JH6G2]

Le volume a été de 7,16 milliards de titres échangés, plus que la moyenne de 6,92 milliards des 20 dernières séances.

Le recul de Wall Street a poussé les cambistes à prendre leur bénéfice sur le dollar, qui avait atteint mardi un pic d'un mois de 97,871 face à un panier de devises de référence <.DXY>, porté par les anticipations d'une nouvelle hausse des taux de la Réserve fédérale à intervenir d'ici la fin de l'année.

Le sterling lui a monté après qu'Andy Haldane, chef économiste de la Banque d'Angleterre, eut dit qu'il se prononcerait sans doute pour une hausse des taux cette année. La livre a en réaction réduit de moitié sa perte de 0,6% accusée mardi contre le billet vert .

Sur le marché des Treasuries, la courbe des rendements s'est encore un peu plus aplatie, en réaction aux dernières déclarations de responsables de la Fed, l'écart entre le papier à cinq ans et celui à 30 ans tombant à 95 points de base, le plus faible depuis décembre 2007, ce qui était déjà le cas pour le spread de la veille.

Nigerian fuel retailer Nipco launches $16 mln offer for Mobil Oil shares - 路透新闻

{{20170621T145455.764+0000}}Nigerian fuel retailer Nipco launches $16 mln offer for Mobil Oil sharesBy Chijioke Ohuocha

LAGOS, June 21 (Reuters) - Nipco Plc has launched a 4.84 billion naira ($16 mln) offer for the shares it needs to take its stake in Mobil Oil to 70 percent to comply with Nigerian takeover rules, its advisers said on Wednesday.

Nipco's investment subsidiary bought 60 percent of Mobil Oil Nigeria from Exxon Mobil Corp. in October, when the U.S. giant pulled out of downstream fuel distribution in Nigeria.[nFWN1CP0DJ]

Nipco, which was founded in 2001, now owns 66.7 percent of the fuel retailer, according to an offer document seen by Reuters.

It is offering minority shareholders 417.12 naira per share for the 3.23 percent of the capital, or 11.6 million shares, it needs, the same price it paid Exxon last year and a 75 percent premium to Wednesday's market price of 238.36 naira.

The offer ends on June 29.

Shares in Lagos-listed Mobil Oil have lost 10 percent this year, giving the company a market value of 85.95 billion naira ($282 mln). The shares rose 74 percent last year.

The downstream oil industry in Africa's biggest economy is consolidating as multinational oil firms divest to focus on upstream exploration with higher margins, especially given the backdrop of lower crude prices.

Nigeria exports nearly 2 million barrels of oil a day but imports the bulk of its refined products because its refining capacity is unable to meet the country's daily fuel needs of 40 million litres.

Mobil Oil rival Oando has now shifted away from being a fuel distributor to explore for oil and gas. It sold a 60 percent stake in its downstream business last year to Vitol and Helios Investment Partners for $210 million.

Mobil was founded in 1951 and operates more than 200 petrol stations in Nigeria. It also owns three plants that manufacture lubes, petroleum jelly, and insecticides in Nigeria's commercial capital of Lagos. ($1 = 304.80 naira)

* Graphic: Projected oil and gas capex (http://reut.rs/2sSAMe0)

(Shell reaction, graphic)

By Ron Bousso

LONDON, June 21 (Reuters) - Energy giants including Exxon Mobil and Royal Dutch Shell risk wasting more than a third of their budgets on projects that will not be needed if climate targets are to be met, a thinktank report shows.

More than $2 trillion of planned investment in oil and gas projects by 2025 could be redundant if governments stick to targets to lower carbon emissions to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius, according to a report by the Carbon Tracker thinktank and institutional investors.

It compared the carbon intensity of oil and gas projects planned by 69 companies with requirements needed to meet the warming target set by the 2015 Paris agreement, which will require curbing fossil fuel consumption.

It found Exxon, the world's top publicly-traded oil and gas company, risks wasting up to half its budget on new fields that will not be needed.

Shell and France's Total would see up to 40 percent of their budgets misspent.

Fossil fuel producers have come under growing pressure from investors to reduce carbon emissions and increase transparency over future investment.

Sweden's largest national pension fund, AP7, one of the authors of the report, said last week it had wound down investments in six companies, including Exxon, which it said had violated the Paris agreement. [nL8N1JC5AP]

Top energy companies have voiced support for the Paris agreement reached by nearly 200 countries. Many of them have urged governments to impose a tax on carbon emissions to support cleaner sources of energy such as gas. [nL8N1JH4HC]

U.S. President Donald Trump said this month he would withdraw the United States from the Paris accord which he said would undermine the U.S. economy. [nL1N1IY0MV]

The report found five of the most expensive projects, including the extension of Kazakhstan's giant Kashagan field and Bonga Southwest and Bonga North in Nigeria, will not be needed if the global warming target is to be met.

Around two thirds of the potential oil and gas production which would be surplus to requirement is controlled by the private sector, "demonstrating how the risk is skewed towards listed companies rather than national oil companies", the report said.

Saudi Arabia's state-run Aramco, widely considered the lowest cost oil producer, would see up to 10 percent of its production rendered uneconomical, the report said.

The report's authors said their discussions with oil companies had shown the companies wanted to remain flexible to respond to future developments and possible changes in the oil price.

Companies including Shell and BP have rejected the idea that assets could end up redundant, saying the reserves they hold are too small to be affected by any long-term decline in demand.

"We believe our business strategy is resilient to the energy transition. We are convinced there is a role for gas to help with the transition to a lower carbon world," Shell said in response to the report.

UPDATE 3-U.S. Gulf Coast braces for Tropical Storm Cindy - 路透新闻

{{20170621T040739.491+0000}}UPDATE 3-U.S. Gulf Coast braces for Tropical Storm Cindy(Updates storm location, wind speed)

By Liz Hampton

June 20 (Reuters) - Communities and oil refining and production facilities from Texas to Florida braced on Tuesday for potential disruptions as Tropical Storm Cindy strengthened over the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, threatening to bring flash floods across parts of the northern Gulf Coast.

Cindy was located about 230 miles (365 km) south of Morgan City, Louisiana late Tuesday with maximum sustained winds of 60 miles (95 km) per hour, the National Hurricane Center said.

The storm was moving toward the northwest near seven miles (11 km) per hour, and this motion was expected to continue through Wednesday.

On the forecast track, the center of Cindy will approach the coast of southwest Louisiana and southeast Texas late Wednesday, and move inland over southeastern Texas on Thursday, the Miami-based weather forecaster said.

A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for San Luis Pass, Texas to the Alabama-Florida border, Metropolitan New Orleans and Lake Pontchartrain.

"The winds aren't looking to get much stronger than they are now," but some areas east of Houston and toward Florida could see as much as 12 inches of rain, said Stephen Strum, vice president of extended forecast services at Weather Decision Technologies in Tulsa, Oklahoma.

"It's moving fairly slow, so it's going to produce rain for a long time," he added.

Heavy rains and wind could disrupt oil supplies at the massive refining and production centers along the U.S. Gulf Coast, which could drive up prices for consumers. The Louisiana Offshore Oil Port (LOOP), the largest privately owned crude storage terminal in the United States, suspended vessel offloading operations ahead of the storm, but said it expected no interruptions to deliveries from its hub in Clovelly, Louisiana.

Royal Dutch Shell said it suspended some offshore well operations but production was so far unaffected. Anadarko Petroleum said it had evacuated non-essential staff from its Gulf of Mexico facilities.

Exxon Mobil Corp , Phillips 66 , and Motiva Enterprises said the storm had not affected their refining operations.

Cindy was expected to produce six to nine inches (15-23 cm) of rain with isolated maximum amounts of 12 inches over southeastern Louisiana, southern Mississippi, southern Alabama, and the Florida Panhandle through Thursday, the NHC said.

Alabama Governor Kay Ivey declared a state of emergency. Officials in Houston, New Orleans and other cities along the Gulf Coast said they were monitoring developments. Florida Governor Rick Scott warned residents in the northwest part of his state to stay alert for flooding and heavy rain.

The storm could cause a surge of one to three feet along the coast and possibly spawn tornados from southern Louisiana to the Florida Panhandle, the NHC said.

The Gulf of Mexico is home to about 17 percent of U.S. crude output and 5 percent of dry natural gas output, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. More than 45 percent of the nation's refining capacity is along the U.S. Gulf Coast, also home to 51 percent of total U.S. natural gas processing capability.

Crude oil prices for physical delivery along the U.S. Gulf Coast were relatively stable, but cash gasoline prices rose as traders expected heavy rains and possible flooding to hit refineries in the region.

Prompt U.S. Gulf Coast conventional gasoline firmed to trade as little as 2 cents per gallon under the RBOB futures contract , its strongest in four months.[nL1N1JH0UD]

WeatherBell Analytics LLC forecast 11 to 13 named tropical storms in the 2017 Atlantic Hurricane Season, according to a May outlook.

The Atlantic hurricane season runs from June 1 through Nov. 30, and has an annual average of 9.6 named storms, 5.9 hurricanes and 2.3 intense hurricanes.

Southeast of the Gulf of Mexico, a second tropical storm, Bret has been downgraded into a tropical wave.

Oil firms could waste trillions if climate targets reached-report - 路透新闻

{{20170620T230155.611+0000}}Oil firms could waste trillions if climate targets reached-report* Many high-cost projects unnecessary if climate targets met

* More than a third of Exxon, Shell budgets seen at risk by 2025

By Ron Bousso

LONDON, June 21 (Reuters) - Oil giants including Exxon Mobil and Royal Dutch Shell risk spending more than a third of their budgets by 2025 on oil and gas projects that will not be feasible if international climate targets are to be met, a thinktank says.

More than $2 trillion of planned investments in oil and gas projects by 2025 risk becoming redundant if governments stick to targets to lower carbon emissions to limit global warming to 2 degrees celsius, according to a report by the Carbon Tracker thinktank and a group of institutional investors.

The report analysed the costs of oil and gas projects planned for approval by 69 companies into 2025. It then compared their carbon intensity to targets needed to meet the 2 degree limit set by the 2015 Paris agreement, which would lead to a decline in fossil fuel consumption.

According to the report, Exxon, the world's top publicly-traded oil and gas company, risks spending up to half its budget on new fields that will not be needed. Shell and France's Total would see up to 40 percent of their budgets outside the limits.

Fossil fuel companies have come under growing pressure from investors to reduce carbon emissions and increase transparency over future investments.

Sweden's largest national pension fund, AP7, one of the authors of the report, said last week it had wound down investments in six companies, including Exxon, that it says violate the Paris climate agreement. [nL8N1JC5AP]

The world's top fossil fuel companies have voiced support for the Paris agreement reached by nearly 200 countries. Many of them have urged governments to impose a tax on carbon emissions to support cleaner sources of energy such as gas. [nL8N1JH4HC]

President Donald Trump said this month he would withdraw the United States from the Paris accord which he said would undermine the U.S. economy and weaken American national sovereignty. [nL1N1IY0MV]

The report gave the example of five of the most expensive projects, including the extension of the giant Kashagan field in Kazakhstan and the Bonga Southwest and Bonga North in Nigeria, which will not be needed within the 2 degree scenario.

Around two thirds of the potential oil and gas production which is surplus to requirements under the 2 degree scenario is controlled by the private sector, "demonstrating how the risk is skewed towards listed companies rather than national oil companies," the report said.

On the other hand, Saudi Arabia's national oil company Aramco, widely considered the lowest cost oil producer in the world, would only see up to 10 percent of its production uneconomical under the carbon emissions scenario, the report said.

The report's authors said their discussions with oil companies had shown they wanted to remain flexible to respond to future developments and possible changes in the oil price.

International oil companies including Shell and BP have rejected the idea that some of their assets could end up redundant, saying the reserves they hold are too small to be affected by any long-term decline in demand.

U.S. Cash Products-Gulf Coast gasoline strengthens as Tropical Storm Cindy brews - 路透新闻

{{20170620T215734.932+0000}}U.S. Cash Products-Gulf Coast gasoline strengthens as Tropical Storm Cindy brewsBy Devika  Krishna Kumar

NEW YORK, June 20 (Reuters) - U.S. Gulf Coast cash gasoline differentials strengthened on
Tuesday as fears of disruptions from a tropical storm added to a sell-off in benchmark futures
prices, traders said.

M2 conventional gasoline firmed to trade as little as 2 cents below benchmark futures prices
on the New York Mercantile Exchange , its strongest in more than four months. Later in the
session, prices eased to trade close to 3 cents per gallon under futures.

The cash roll for conventional gasoline Cycle 35 to Cycle 36 on Colonial Pipeline was also
seen strengthening by about a quarter penny, traders said.

Communities and oil refining and production facilities from Texas to Florida braced for
potential disruptions as Tropical Storm Cindy meandered over the U.S. Gulf of Mexico,
threatening to bring wind and heavy rain to the region. [nL1N1JH1E0]

Benchmark futures prices on Tuesday fell as much as 2.4 percent before ending the session at
$1.420, or 2.1 percent lower amid a larger sell-off in energy markets. [O/R]

In refinery news, Exxon Mobil Corp  was expected to restart the second largest crude
distillation unit (CDU) at its 502,500-barrel-per-day (bpd) Baton Rouge, Louisiana, refinery on
Tuesday after completing repairs, said sources familiar with plant operations. [REF/OUT]

In Chicago markets, CBOB gasoline strengthened for another day after Exxon confirmed that
there was a "controlled shutdown" to repair a leak on a production unit at its
238,600-barrel-per-day Joliet, Illinois, refinery. [nFWN1JH0CC]

CBOB prices strengthened by 1.50 cents per gallon to trade 5.50 cents under benchmark
futures prices. Meanwhile, diesel strengthened by a penny to trade 1.50 cents below benchmark
futures .

In the New York harbor, gasoline strengthened slightly amid the sell-off in futures prices.
Data from energy intelligence service Genscape early in the session showed inventories of
gasoline in the region rose by about 450,000 barrels last week, said traders who saw the data.

Late in the day, data from the American Petroleum Institute showed U.S. gasoline stocks rose
by 346,000 barrels, compared with analysts' expectations in a Reuters poll for a 443,000-barrel
gain. [API/S]

Prices of Renewable Fuel (D6) Renewable Identification Number (RIN) credits for 2017 were
75.5 cents each, relatively unchanged from Monday's prices, traders said.

Biomass-based diesel (D4) RINs for the current year were seen at bid-ask range of $1.10 and
$1.13, relatively unchanged from Monday, traders said.

FOKUS 6-US-Börsen schließen nach Rekordständen im Minus  - 路透新闻

{{20170620T201701.038+0000}}FOKUS 6-US-Börsen schließen nach Rekordständen im Minus * Dax scheitert an 13.000er Marke

* Chevron und Exxon im Minus

(neu: Schlusskurse, Kreditmärkte)

New York, 20. Jun (Reuters) - Nach den jüngsten Rekordständen ist den US-Börsen am Dienstag die Puste ausgegangen. Auf die Stimmung drückten sinkende Ölpreise. Der Dow-Jones-Index<.DJI> fiel um 0,3 Prozent und schloss bei 21.467 Punkten. Der breiter gefasste S&P<.SPX> gab um 0,7 Prozent auf 2437 Stellen nach. Der Index der Technologiebörse Nasdaq<.IXIC> verlor 0,8 Prozent und ging mit 6188 Zählern aus dem Handel. In Frankfurt schloss der Dax<.GDAXI> 0,6 Prozent im Minus bei knapp 12.815 Punkten, nachdem er am Vormittag auf ein Rekordhoch von 12.951,54 Zählern gestiegen war.

Das Augenmerk der Anleger richtete sich auf den Rohstoffmarkt. Dort verbilligte sich die Ölsorte Brent aus der Nordsee um bis zu 3,2 Prozent und war mit 45,42 Dollar je Barrel so günstig wie zuletzt vor sieben Monaten.[nL8N1IS0LO] "Das hat psychologisch eine große Wirkung auf die Wall Street", sagte Adam Sarhan, Chef des Vermögensberaters 50 Park. "Wenn die Ölpreise abstürzen, sendet der Ölmarkt die Botschaft aus, dass die Nachfrage versiegt und das globale Wirtschaftswachstum abnimmt."

Zu den Kursverlierern in New York zählten insbesondere Ölkonzerne.[nL8N1JH351] Chevron-Papiere büßten knapp ein Prozent ein, Exxon-Titel 0,54 Prozent.

Technologieaktien gerieten wieder unter Druck, nachdem sie sich zu Wochenbeginn noch von vorangegangenen Kursverlusten erholt hatten. Der Sektorindex<.SPLRCT> sank 0,78 Prozent.

An der New York Stock Exchange wechselten rund 812 Millionen Aktien den Besitzer. 835 Werte legten zu, 2077 gaben nach und 143 blieben unverändert. An der Nasdaq schlossen bei Umsätzen von 2,54 Milliarden Aktien 875 im Plus, 1991 im Minus und 202 unverändert.

Die zehnjährigen Papiere stiegen um 9/32 auf 101-29/32. Sie rentierten mit 2,16 Prozent. Die 30-jährigen Bonds stiegen um 31/32 auf 105-8/32 und hatten eine Rendite von 2,74 Prozent.

UPDATE 4-Oil traders brace for storm expected to hit U.S. Gulf Coast this week - 路透新闻

{{20170620T173532.572+0000}}UPDATE 4-Oil traders brace for storm expected to hit U.S. Gulf Coast this week(Recasts, adds details)

June 20 (Reuters) - Oil traders from Texas to Louisiana braced on Tuesday for supply disruptions as a potential tropical storm developing in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico threatened to hit refining and production centers with wind and rain later this week.

The Louisiana Offshore Oil Port, the largest privately owned crude storage terminal in the United States, suspended vessel offloading operations early on Tuesday morning ahead of the storm, but said it expected no interruptions to deliveries from its hub in Clovelly, Louisiana. [nFWN1JH0MO]

Exxon Mobil Corp , Phillips 66 , and Motiva Enterprises have said the potential storm has not yet impacted operations at its facilities. Royal Dutch Shell on Tuesday said some offshore well operations had been suspended but production was currently unaffected.

The weather system in the Gulf of Mexico has a 90 percent chance of becoming a tropical storm in the next day or two, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said in its latest advisory.

Currently located about 265 miles (430 km) south of Morgan City, Louisiana, the weather system is expected to approach the southwest Louisiana coast late on Wednesday and move inland over western Louisiana and eastern Texas on Thursday, the hurricane center said.

The storm could strengthen slightly before it reaches the coast, the NHC said. It extended warnings for the storm westward to High Island, Texas, and for heavy rainfall across most portions of the Gulf Coast.

The weather system now has maximum sustained winds of 40 miles per hour (65 kilometers per hour), the Miami-based forecaster said.

"Satellite imagery shows that the center of the disturbance is gradually becoming better defined, and it is likely that the system will become a tropical or subtropical cyclone later today," the NHC said on Tuesday.

The storm, currently designated as "Potential Tropical Cyclone Three," could also cause tornados later on Tuesday from south-central Louisiana to the western Florida Panhandle.

Crude oil prices for physical delivery along the U.S. Gulf Coast were relatively stable on Tuesday morning, but cash gasoline prices rose as traders expected refineries along the Gulf Coast to get hit with heavy rains, which may result in flooding.

Mars Sour crude was last discussed around a $1.60 a barrel discount to U.S. crude futures , little changed from Monday, while Louisiana Light Sweet crude , the light sweet benchmark, was unchanged at a $1.95 a barrel premium to West Texas Intermediate (WTI).

Meanwhile, prompt U.S. Gulf Coast conventional gasoline traded at a 2 cents per gallon discount to the RBOB futures contract , its strongest level in four months. [nL1N1JH0UD]

Meanwhile, southeast of the Gulf of Mexico, tropical storm Bret is expected to begin weakening later Tuesday and dissipate on Thursday.

That storm, located about 315 miles (505 km) east of Curacao and packing maximum sustained winds of 45 miles (75 km) per hour is moving west-northwest and will continue to proceed across the southeastern Caribbean Sea, the hurricane center said.

The Gulf of Mexico is home to about 17 percent of U.S. crude output and 5 percent of dry natural gas output daily, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. More than 45 percent of the nation's refining capacity is located along the U.S. Gulf Coast, which also is home to 51 percent of total U.S. natural gas processing capability.

WeatherBell Analytics LLC forecast 11 to 13 named tropical storms in the 2017 Atlantic Hurricane Season, according to a May outlook issued by the company.

The Atlantic hurricane season runs from June 1 through Nov. 30, and has an average of 9.6 named storms, 5.9 hurricanes and 2.3 intense hurricanes every year. The median number of named storms between 1981 and 2010 was 12 per year, according to Colorado State University's Tropical Meteorology Project.

Snam en négociations pour la part d'un terminal GNL d'Edison - 路透新闻

{{20170620T160349.415+0000}}Snam en négociations pour la part d'un terminal GNL d'EdisonMILAN, 20 juin (Reuters) - Le groupe gazier italien Snam est en négociations exclusives avec Edison, filiale italienne d'EDF , pour le rachat d'une part dans un terminal de gaz naturel liquéfié (GNL) dans le nord de l'Italie, a-t-on appris de deux sources.

Snam, contrôlé par l'équivalent italien de la Caisse des dépôts (Cassa Depositi e Prestiti), cherche à acquérir la participation de 7,3% d'Edison dans Terminale GNL Adriatico, ainsi que le gazoduc qui le relie au réseau central de distribution de gaz du pays, ont ajouté les sources.

Le terminal, qui a une capacité de huit milliards de mètres cubes par an, est détenu à 70,7% par ExxonMobil et à 22% par Qatar Petroleum. Exxon et le Qatar ont tous deux un droit de préemption sur la participation d'Edison.

Snam a dit qu'il ne commentait pas les rumeurs.

Edison a annoncé ce mois-ci qu'il était en négociations pour vendre cette participation et le gazoduc, ainsi que deux bureaux à Milan où se situe son siège.

"L'idée est de boucler la vente pendant la première moitié du mois de juillet, bien que l'on ne puisse écarter l'éventualité d'un certain dépassement", a dit une des sources.

Selon le journal italien Il Sole 24 Ore, la participation d'Edison dans Terminale GNL Adriatico a une valeur comptable de 159 millions d'euros et le gazoduc de 32 millions d'euros.

Exxon, BP support Republican elders' climate proposal - 路透新闻

{{20170620T144044.425+0000}}Exxon, BP support Republican elders' climate proposalBOSTON, June 20 (Reuters) - Major oil companies like Exxon Mobil and BP Plc have thrown their support behind a carbon tax plan proposed by a group of elder Republican statesmen, according to an advertisement published in the Wall Street Journal on Tuesday.

The corporate support for the plan, which would impose a $40 tax on each ton of carbon dioxide produced, follows a decision by President Donald Trump to pull the United States out of the Paris Climate Agreement, a global pact that fights climate change by slashing emissions from burning fossil fuels.

"This plan would achieve significantly greater emissions reductions than all current and prior climate regulations, while helping America's businesses and workers get ahead," according to the advertisement from the Climate Leadership Council.

The ad bore the corporate symbols of companies such as Exxon, BP, Shell , Total , GM , Johnson & Johnson , and PepsiCo .

The Climate Leadership Council proposal was co-authored by James Baker, secretary of state during the administration of George H. W. Bush, and George Shultz, secretary of state under Ronald Reagan. The proposed $40 per ton tax on carbon would rise in price over time, and revenues would be paid into the Social Security Administration.

While the plan echoes past attempts by parts of the Republican Party to address climate change, it could be a non-starter. Trump has expressed doubt over the existence of climate change and has said efforts to fight it put the United States at a competitive disadvantage.

A White House official did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The administration has previously said a carbon tax is not under consideration.

An overwhelming majority of scientists believe that burning fossil fuels drives global climate change, has raised sea levels and triggered more frequent and powerful storms.

Oil giants like Exxon and BP have been criticized for their roles in contributing to climate change through the production and marketing of fossil fuels. Still, in recent years, they have supported government efforts to regulate emissions, including through the Paris climate deal agreed by nearly 200 nations in 2015.

Exxon Chief Executive Darren Woods had repeatedly urged Trump to keep the United States in the Paris deal, saying the country's abundant reserves of low-carbon natural gas made it well-placed to perform within the agreement.

Snam in exclusive talks to buy LNG terminal stake from Edison -sources - 路透新闻

{{20170620T142925.064+0000}}Snam in exclusive talks to buy LNG terminal stake from Edison -sourcesMILAN, June 19 (Reuters) - Italian gas group Snam is in exclusive talks with EDF's Italian unit Edison to buy a stake in a liquefied natural gas terminal in northern Italy as part of plans to develop its LNG business, two sources said.

Snam, controlled by state lender Cassa Depositi e Prestiti, is looking to buy Edison's 7.3 percent stake in Terminale LNG Adriatico and the gas pipeline that connects it to Italy's gas transmission backbone, the sources said.

Adriatic LNG, which has a capacity of 8 billion cubic metres per year, is 70.7 percent owned by ExxonMobil and 22 percent by Qatar Petroleum. Exxon and Qatar have a pre-emption right on Edison's stake.

Snam said it did not comment on market speculation.

Edison said in June talks were under way to sell the stake and pipeline as well as two offices in Milan hosting its headquarters.

"The idea is to wrap up the sale in the first half of July, though some slippage can't be ruled out," one of the sources said, adding Banca IMI was advising Edison on the deal.

Snam, which makes most of its money from gas transmission, is looking to play a leading role in integrating Europe's grids and making Italy a European gas hub.

In its March business plan it said it would be looking at opportunities to grow its LNG infrastructure business.

According to Italian newspaper Il Sole 24 Ore, Edison's stake in the Adriatic LNG platform has a book value of 159 million euros ($177 million) while the pipeline has a book value of 32 million euros.

It was not possible to confirm these values but one of the sources said if a deal went through it would be for a higher price.

($1 = 0.8979 euros)

POINT MARCHÉS-Wall Street ouvre en baisse, le pétrole pèse sur la tendance - 路透新闻

{{20170620T134528.429+0000}}POINT MARCHÉS-Wall Street ouvre en baisse, le pétrole pèse sur la tendance20 juin (Reuters) - La Bourse de New York cède du terrain mardi en début de séance, la forte baisse des cours du pétrole pesant sur la tendance au lendemain de nouveaux records sur fond de rebond des valeurs technologiques.

Quelques minutes après le début des échanges, l'indice Dow Jones <.DJI> perd 1,45 point, soit 0,01%, à 21.527,54. Le Standard & Poor's 500 <.SPX>, plus large, recule de 0,2% à 2448,47 et le Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> cède 0,19% à 6227,14.

Au même moment, le cours du baril de pétrole brut léger américain (West Texas Intermediate, WTI) chute de 3,01% à 42,87 dollars , au plus bas depuis la mi-novembre, et le Brent abandonne 2,58% à 45,70 dollars . L'un et l'autre sont pénalisés par des informations montrant une hausse de la production en Libye et au Nigeria.

Chevron - plus forte baisse du Dow - et Exxon Mobil , les deux plus gros groupes pétroliers cotés des Etats-Unis, perdent respectivement 1,22% et 0,79%.

Les marchés actions européens évoluent quant à eux en ordre dispersé: l'indice large Stoxx 600 <.STOXX> abandonne 0,19% et le FTSE à Londres 0,17% <.FTSE> tandis que le CAC 40 à Paris gagne 0,19% <.FCHI> et qu'à Francfort, le Dax est inchangé <.GDAXI>.

A Wall Street, le Dow Jones et le S&P 500 ont inscrit de nouveaux records lundi, à la faveur entre autres du rebond des valeurs technologiques après deux semaines de repli. Mardi, l'indice S&P des hautes technologies <.SPLRCT> recule de 0,09%.

En hausse, Lennar , le numéro deux de la construction résidentielle aux Etats-Unis, gagne 4,04% après ses résultats trimestriels, marqués par un bénéfice meilleur qu'attendu, et l'annonce d'une forte hausse de son carnet de commandes sur le trimestre à fin mai.

McDonald's prend 1,1% et a inscrit un plus haut à la faveur d'un relèvement de recommandation.

Sur le marché des changes, le dollar évolue au plus haut depuis trois semaines face à un panier de référence <.DXY>, soutenu par les dernières déclarations de responsables de la Réserve fédérale - dont William Dudley, le président de la Fed de New York - sur la bonne santé de l'économie américaine, qui ravivent les anticipations de relèvement des taux d'ici la fin de l'année.

RPT-INSIGHT-Innovators toil to revive Canada oil sands as majors exit - 路透新闻

{{20170620T110104.725+0000}}RPT-INSIGHT-Innovators toil to revive Canada oil sands as majors exit(Repeats without change)

By Nia Williams and Ernest Scheyder

CALGARY, Alberta/HOUSTON, June 19 (Reuters) - In the boreal forests and on the remote prairies of Alberta, a handful of firms are running pilot projects they hope will end a two-decade drought in innovation and stem the exodus of top global energy firms from Canada's oil sands.

They are searching for a breakthrough that will cut the cost of pumping the tar-like oil from the country's vast underground bitumen reservoirs and better compete with the booming shale industry in the United States.

If they fail, a bigger chunk of the world's third-largest oil reserves will stay in the ground. Canada's oil sands sector has become one of the biggest victims of the global oil price crash that began in 2014 when top OPEC producer Saudi Arabia flooded the market with cheap crude to drive out high cost competitors.

This year alone, oil majors have sold over $22.5 billion of assets in Canada's energy industry, and been lured south to invest in the higher returns of U.S. shale.

Joseph Kuhach is among the entrepreneurs in Canada hoping they can turn the tide. He runs a small Calgary-based firm, Nsolv, that is testing the use of solvents to liquefy the bitumen buried in the sands and make it flow as oil.

Kuhach says using solvents can cut 20 to 40 percent from the cost of producing the oil. The technique currently used is to use steam to heat the sands underground to extract the oil.

It's a hard sell, he said, to Canadian producers struggling with low oil prices. They are reluctant to invest in a multi-million dollar technology that is unproven on a commercial scale, he said.

"The comment I hear so often when I am talking to companies is, 'We want to be the very first in line to be second'," said Kuhach. "It's easier to go after incremental improvements that they can back away from with no great cost and no great risk."

Nsolv is winding down a three-year pilot project with Canada's second-largest energy producer Suncor Energy at its Dover oil sands lease in northern Alberta. Suncor is evaluating the results, the firm's spokeswoman Erin Rees said.

Fourth-largest producer Imperial Oil , controlled by ExxonMobil Corp , is also developing solvent technology and has had an ongoing C$100-million pilot project since 2013, the company said.

The caution of oil sands producers stems in part from the unique challenges of operating here, where projects take years to build and require billions of dollars in upfront capital.

The development of the technique using steam two decades ago made Canada's sands the new frontier for the oil industry, and majors were among the firms that flocked to buy in.

Since then, innovation has stalled. That failure, energy-industry entrepreneurs and venture capitalists told Reuters, is rooted in a risk-averse culture that has left oil sands years behind U.S. shale.

The exodus of international oil firms such as Royal Dutch Shell and Statoil ASA from oil sands has made innovation tougher because there are fewer potential customers who might adopt new technology, said Joe Gasca, chairman of Fractal Systems Inc. His firm processes bitumen into higher-quality crude at the wellhead.

Fractal is running a 1,000 barrel-per-day (bpd) test plant in eastern Alberta for third-largest producer Cenovus Energy , which has yet to make a decision on whether to proceed commercially.

DATING AND MARRIAGE

The shale sector moved fast to innovate and cut costs to survive the oil price crash. In 2014, producing oil from most shale fields cost more than the average $60 a barrel needed for a new Canadian oil sands project to make money. Now, there are some shale patches that can make a profit at $15 a barrel. [nL1N1DU2DQ]

It takes months of pumping steam into underground reservoirs before bitumen starts to flow from the oil sands. That makes engineers reluctant to experiment with the delicate balance of heat and pressure.

Shale, by contrast, provides comparatively fertile ground for innovation. The initial investment is a fraction of what the cost of an oil sands project. Relatively easy access encourages competition as the many firms involved look for an edge. Wells can be drilled quickly. The stakes are lower and the scale is smaller if experiments fail.

Drilling longer wells and being better able to pinpoint where in those wells to fracture the rock, among other techniques, have supercharged U.S. shale output in the past two years. That has boosted firms including Noble Energy and Devon Energy and drawn billions of dollars in new private equity investment.[nL1N1HF0L2]

Canadian producers have fewer projects to experiment with and are unwilling to risk their massive upfront investments, said Steve Fisher, chief executive of Calgary-based startup Veerum.

"Shale is like going on a date, the oil sands is like getting married," he said. "The risk for capital is high in the oil sands, you have massive assets that need to complete on time and operate for 40 years to make money."

Veerum's technology cuts capital costs by tracking how accurately a new project sticks to design specifications during construction, reducing the need for costly fixes later.

The company is supported by GE's Zone Startups Calgary, an incubator for new firms in the energy capital of Canada.

Another hurdle to innovation is the lack of sales and marketing expertise in the city's oil industry to carry ideas through to commercial execution, said Marty Reed, chief executive of clean-tech fund Evok Innovations.

"At $100 a barrel it didn't take a sales and marketing genius to sell the product," Reed said. "But if you are a new company trying to get Suncor to adopt a new widget those skills are crucial."

Evok was launched last year with a C$100 million investment from Cenovus and Suncor over 10 years to accelerate development of technologies to cut oil sands costs and emissions.

'INCREMENTAL GAINS'

Since oil prices began falling in 2014, the long-term forecast for oil sands output in 2030 has fallen to 3.7 million bpd, down from 5.2 million bpd, according to the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers. Current output is around 2.4 million bpd.

Expansion will mostly come from adding units at existing projects, given new projects are unprofitable at current international oil prices of around $45 a barrel.

Canadian oil sands producers recognize that innovation is crucial for their survival, and some firms are spending more.

The country's top energy producer Canadian Natural Resources Ltd allocated C$549 million ($406.97 million) or 14 percent of its 2016 C$3.8 billion capital budget on research and development (R&D), up 4 percent from C$527 million in 2015, when capital spending was higher.

"It's mostly about incremental gains, but we do have some big stuff that could change things," Canadian Natural President Steve Laut told reporters last month, declining to elaborate.

Suncor and Imperial both held R&D spending steady from the previous year while reducing overall capital budgets. Suncor spent C$150 million, or 3 percent of its budget in 2016 on what it calls "step-change technologies", while Imperial spent C$195 million, roughly 17 percent of its budget, company filings showed.

The firms all said they were working on ways to reduce costs and environmental impact. Producers also said new technology is often developed in the field during normal operations and does not necessarily show up in R&D budgets.

A number of producers, including Cenovus and Suncor are looking at ways to add solvents to steam in their commercial operations.

Unlike the solvent-only technique being pitched by Nsolv, this would allow firms to adapt existing thermal plants rather than build new ones, Kuhach said.

Even if pilot steam-and-solvent projects are successful, it would take another three to five years for the technology to spread across the industry, said Dan Wicklum, chief executive of the Canadian Oil Sands Innovation Alliance.

Vancouver-based Chrysalix Venture Capital has become more cautious about new oil sands investments since the oil majors pulled out, Chief Executive Wal van Lierop said, but is investing in technologies that may prove valuable to the sector.

"I am really hoping we can get breakthrough technologies, but I don't see them yet," he said.

"Mediocracy will not help. It will be go big or go home."

UPDATE 4-EQT to create biggest U.S. natgas producer with $6.7 bln Rice deal - Reuters News

{{20170619T225237.423+0000}}UPDATE 4-EQT to create biggest U.S. natgas producer with $6.7 bln Rice deal* Deal would create biggest U.S. natural gas producer

* Merging adjacent land aids longer lateral drilling

* Reduced drilling costs important as gas prices subdued

* EQT's $27.04 offer represents 37.3 pct premium

* Deal expected to close in Q4 2017

(New throughout, adds new EQT filing, details and background)

By Yashaswini Swamynathan and Arathy S Nair

June 19 (Reuters) - EQT Corp was set to leapfrog Exxon Mobil as the largest U.S. natural gas producer after saying on Monday it agreed to a deal to buy fellow Appalachian gas and oil firm Rice Energy for $6.7 billion.

The tie-up would join two of the largest players in the Marcellus and Utica Shale formations, which stretch across much of Pennsylvania and Ohio and are ideally situated to supply gas throughout the U.S. Northeast.

Rice Energy also provides technological expertise to EQT, which has operated in the Marcellus since 2009.

"EQT is a decade behind in fracking technology used by industry leaders in the Marcellus/Utica," said Dallas Salazar, CEO of energy consulting firm Atlas Consulting. "EQT needs a lot, and Rice offers a lot of what it needs."

Technology improvements allow companies to drill sideways over a longer distance, making adjacent land with gas deposits more attractive. On average, the acquisition will increase EQT's sideways drilling capacity by 50 percent in two Pennsylvania counties.

Controlling production costs is important when U.S. natural gas prices remain low due to abundant supply. The Henry Hub U.S. benchmark's average price of $3.02 per million British thermal units so far in 2017 is well below the 10-year average of $4.42.

EQT has identified $2.5 billion of cost savings from the proposed merger, as well as benefits from moving some of Rice's midstream assets into its pipeline business, EQT Midstream Partners . Analysts at Mizuho have estimated those assets to be worth $1.3 billion.

BIGGEST DEAL

The proposed transaction, scheduled to close in the fourth quarter, would be the biggest ever for EQT, increasing its 2017 average sales volume by 1.3 billion cubic feet equivalent per day (bcfe/d) and core acres in the Marcellus field by 187,000 to 670,000.

It is offering Rice Energy shareholders $5.30 per share in cash and 0.37 EQT shares for each share held, equivalent to $27.04 per Rice Energy share. Reuters calculations show that represents a 37.3 percent premium to Friday's closing price.

Rice Energy's shares surged 24.8 percent to $24.57. EQT's shares slid 9 percent.

In a later filing, EQT said Citigroup, its financial adviser, had commited to back the deal with bridge loans worth $1.4 billion. Should the deal collapse, Rice would pay a termination fee of up to $255 million.

EQT will issue debt to cover the cash component and $5.4 billion of equity, and will assume or refinance $1.5 billion of net debt and preferred equity belonging to Rice Energy, according to a company presentation.

Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz were EQT's legal advisers. Barclays Capital was Rice Energy's financial adviser and Vinson & Elkins its legal adviser.

LEAD 2-USA-Gaz naturel/EQT acquiert Rice pour $6,7 mds - 路透新闻

{{20170619T195126.477+0000}}LEAD 2-USA-Gaz naturel/EQT acquiert Rice pour $6,7 mds(Actualisé avec commentaire d'analyste et le fait que l'opération crée le premier producteur américain e gaz naturel)

19 juin (Reuters) - Le producteur américain de gaz et de pétrole EQT a annoncé lundi le rachat de son concurrent Rice Energy pour 6,7 milliards de dollars (6,0 milliards d'euros), la plus importante acquisition de l'histoire d'EQT, qui vise à développer ses actifs dans le gaz naturel.

L'annonce de l'offre fait grimper le titre Rice Energy de 24,83% à 24,58 dollars peu avant la clôture à Wall Street, en-deçà toutefois des 27,05 dollars qu'EQT propose en actions et en numéraire. EQT de son côté chute de 9,12% à 53,41 dollars.

Avec cette acquisition, EQT va pouvoir développer ses techniques de fracturation hydraulique en Pennsylvanie, où les deux groupes ont des installations voisines mais techniquement plus avancées s'agissant de Rice Energy.

"EQT a 10 ans de retard dans les technologies de fracturation utilisées par les leaders du secteur", affirme Dallas Salazar, directeur de la société de conseil spécialisée Atlas Consulting. "EQT a de gros besoins, et Rice y répond bien."

L'opération fera d'EQT le premier producteur américain de gaz naturel, devant Exxon Mobil . Les groupes pétroliers investissent activement dans les Etats riches en gaz comme la Pennsylvanie, la Virginie occidentale et l'Ohio. Les Etats-Unis devraient bientôt devenir le premier exportateur mondial de gaz naturel.

EQT a précisé que le rachat augmenterait son volume de ventes 2017 de 1,3 milliard d'équivalents pieds cubes par jour (36,8 millions de mètres cubes par jour).

Dans le détail, les actionnaires de Rice Energy recevront 5,30 dollars en espèces et 0,37 action EQT pour chaque titre apporté, a précisé l'acquéreur.

Au cours de clôture de vendredi, cela équivaut à un prix de 27,05 dollars par action, soit une prime de 37,4% par rapport à la clôture de Rice vendredi à 19,69 dollars.

EQT espère finaliser l'acquisition d'ici la fin de l'année.

Exxon says scientists boost lipid content from algae in lab study - 路透新闻

{{20170619T150658.435+0000}}Exxon says scientists boost lipid content from algae in lab studyBy Ernest Scheyder

HOUSTON, June 19 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp and Synthetic Genomics Inc said on Monday they had found a way to more than double the amount of lipids produced by algae in a lab, moving a potential alternative to fossil fuels closer to commercial viability.

The development comes as Exxon, the world's largest publicly traded oil producer, fights accusations by environmentalists and others that it misled investors and the public for years about the risks of climate change from fossil fuels.[nL1N1J61IZ]

In the past decade, Exxon has boosted investment in fuel cells, biodiesel, algae and other alternative energy technologies, in collaboration with private partners. The company also has invested in television advertisements to tout its renewable energy investments, including during last summer's Olympic Games.[nL1N1AY0UK]

"Algae can be a viable, renewable source for volumes of oil at scale," said Vijay Swarup, Exxon's vice president for research and development.

"We like algae because it's fast-growing, doesn't compete for food and water and can grow in all sorts of climates and brackish water."

Exxon and Synthetic cautioned that they are far from being able to run the process at commercial scale.

The oil company's ultimate goal is to make an oil from algae that can be processed by existing refineries, though that goal remains elusive.

Exxon began working with California-based Synthetic on algae research in 2009. The lab work is conducted at Synthetic facilities and funded by Exxon, which declined to disclose its financial investment.

Scientists studied the way that algae cells partition carbon - typically from carbon dioxide - and produce lipids, a kind of hydrocarbon. Algae converts carbon dioxide into lipids much in the same way the human body converts sugar into fat.

The scientists were able to genetically modify algae to convert 40 percent of CO2 into lipids, up from a prior 15 percent.

"This was not an overnight breakthrough. This was a lot of sweat and toil," said Craig Venter, chairman of Synthetic Genomics.

Up next, scientists will need to unlock how to speed up the process and strengthen the algae cells.

"This just gives us hope and optimism that we're on the right track," said Swarup.

By Gwladys Fouche

OSLO, June 19 (Reuters) - Sweden's largest national pension fund is looking to get other investors to agree on principles relating to their shareholdings in companies which it says violate the Paris climate agreement.

The fund, called AP7, last week sold out of ExxonMobil , Gazprom , TransCanada Corp , Westar Energy , Entergy and Southern Corp in what some environmentalists said was the first time an investor had cited the Paris agreement as the reason for a divestment. [nL8N1JC5AP]

ExxonMobil denied it was in breach of the accord, while Entergy said AP7's decision was unfounded and Westar Energy said that its strategy is to "strike the balance among keeping power clean, reliable and affordable". [nL8N1JC5AP]

The other companies did not reply to requests for comment.

"At this stage we are talking with four other investors," a spokesman for AP7, which provides pensions to 3.5 million Swedes and said it would no longer invest in companies it decides are in breach of the Paris climate accord, told Reuters.

The fund has 390 billion Swedish crowns ($45 billion) of assets under management.

"We are looking to other investors to start a dialogue on principles that we can agree on as long-term investors regarding the Paris Climate agreement," the spokesman added.

"Some are similar in nature to us and some are on the private side," he said, but declined to name them. ($1 = 8.6905 Swedish crowns)

INSIGHT-Innovators toil to revive Canada oil sands as majors exit - 路透新闻

{{20170619T050033.414+0000}}INSIGHT-Innovators toil to revive Canada oil sands as majors exit(Refiles)

By Nia Williams and Ernest Scheyder

CALGARY, Alberta/HOUSTON, June 19 (Reuters) - In the boreal forests and on the remote prairies of Alberta, a handful of firms are running pilot projects they hope will end a two-decade drought in innovation and stem the exodus of top global energy firms from Canada's oil sands.

They are searching for a breakthrough that will cut the cost of pumping the tar-like oil from the country's vast underground bitumen reservoirs and better compete with the booming shale industry in the United States.

If they fail, a bigger chunk of the world's third-largest oil reserves will stay in the ground. Canada's oil sands sector has become one of the biggest victims of the global oil price crash that began in 2014 when top OPEC producer Saudi Arabia flooded the market with cheap crude to drive out high cost competitors.

This year alone, oil majors have sold over $22.5 billion of assets in Canada's energy industry, and been lured south to invest in the higher returns of U.S. shale.

Joseph Kuhach is among the entrepreneurs in Canada hoping they can turn the tide. He runs a small Calgary-based firm, Nsolv, that is testing the use of solvents to liquefy the bitumen buried in the sands and make it flow as oil.

Kuhach says using solvents can cut 20 to 40 percent from the cost of producing the oil. The technique currently used is to use steam to heat the sands underground to extract the oil.

It's a hard sell, he said, to Canadian producers struggling with low oil prices. They are reluctant to invest in a multi-million dollar technology that is unproven on a commercial scale, he said.

"The comment I hear so often when I am talking to companies is, 'We want to be the very first in line to be second'," said Kuhach. "It's easier to go after incremental improvements that they can back away from with no great cost and no great risk."

Nsolv is winding down a three-year pilot project with Canada's second-largest energy producer Suncor Energy at its Dover oil sands lease in northern Alberta. Suncor is evaluating the results, the firm's spokeswoman Erin Rees said.

Fourth-largest producer Imperial Oil , controlled by ExxonMobil Corp , is also developing solvent technology and has had an ongoing C$100-million pilot project since 2013, the company said.

The caution of oil sands producers stems in part from the unique challenges of operating here, where projects take years to build and require billions of dollars in upfront capital.

The development of the technique using steam two decades ago made Canada's sands the new frontier for the oil industry, and majors were among the firms that flocked to buy in.

Since then, innovation has stalled. That failure, energy-industry entrepreneurs and venture capitalists told Reuters, is rooted in a risk-averse culture that has left oil sands years behind U.S. shale.

The exodus of international oil firms such as Royal Dutch Shell and Statoil ASA from oil sands has made innovation tougher because there are fewer potential customers who might adopt new technology, said Joe Gasca, chairman of Fractal Systems Inc. His firm processes bitumen into higher-quality crude at the wellhead.

Fractal is running a 1,000 barrel-per-day (bpd) test plant in eastern Alberta for third-largest producer Cenovus Energy , which has yet to make a decision on whether to proceed commercially.

DATING AND MARRIAGE

The shale sector moved fast to innovate and cut costs to survive the oil price crash. In 2014, producing oil from most shale fields cost more than the average $60 a barrel needed for a new Canadian oil sands project to make money. Now, there are some shale patches that can make a profit at $15 a barrel. [nL1N1DU2DQ]

It takes months of pumping steam into underground reservoirs before bitumen starts to flow from the oil sands. That makes engineers reluctant to experiment with the delicate balance of heat and pressure.

Shale, by contrast, provides comparatively fertile ground for innovation. The initial investment is a fraction of what the cost of an oil sands project. Relatively easy access encourages competition as the many firms involved look for an edge. Wells can be drilled quickly. The stakes are lower and the scale is smaller if experiments fail.

Drilling longer wells and being better able to pinpoint where in those wells to fracture the rock, among other techniques, have supercharged U.S. shale output in the past two years. That has boosted firms including Noble Energy and Devon Energy and drawn billions of dollars in new private equity investment.[nL1N1HF0L2]

Canadian producers have fewer projects to experiment with and are unwilling to risk their massive upfront investments, said Steve Fisher, chief executive of Calgary-based startup Veerum.

"Shale is like going on a date, the oil sands is like getting married," he said. "The risk for capital is high in the oil sands, you have massive assets that need to complete on time and operate for 40 years to make money."

Veerum's technology cuts capital costs by tracking how accurately a new project sticks to design specifications during construction, reducing the need for costly fixes later.

The company is supported by GE's Zone Startups Calgary, an incubator for new firms in the energy capital of Canada.

Another hurdle to innovation is the lack of sales and marketing expertise in the city's oil industry to carry ideas through to commercial execution, said Marty Reed, chief executive of clean-tech fund Evok Innovations.

"At $100 a barrel it didn't take a sales and marketing genius to sell the product," Reed said. "But if you are a new company trying to get Suncor to adopt a new widget those skills are crucial."

Evok was launched last year with a C$100 million investment from Cenovus and Suncor over 10 years to accelerate development of technologies to cut oil sands costs and emissions.

'INCREMENTAL GAINS'

Since oil prices began falling in 2014, the long-term forecast for oil sands output in 2030 has fallen to 3.7 million bpd, down from 5.2 million bpd, according to the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers. Current output is around 2.4 million bpd.

Expansion will mostly come from adding units at existing projects, given new projects are unprofitable at current international oil prices of around $45 a barrel.

Canadian oil sands producers recognize that innovation is crucial for their survival, and some firms are spending more.

The country's top energy producer Canadian Natural Resources Ltd allocated C$549 million ($406.97 million) or 14 percent of its 2016 C$3.8 billion capital budget on research and development (R&D), up 4 percent from C$527 million in 2015, when capital spending was higher.

"It's mostly about incremental gains, but we do have some big stuff that could change things," Canadian Natural President Steve Laut told reporters last month, declining to elaborate.

Suncor and Imperial both held R&D spending steady from the previous year while reducing overall capital budgets. Suncor spent C$150 million, or 3 percent of its budget in 2016 on what it calls "step-change technologies", while Imperial spent C$195 million, roughly 17 percent of its budget, company filings showed.

The firms all said they were working on ways to reduce costs and environmental impact. Producers also said new technology is often developed in the field during normal operations and does not necessarily show up in R&D budgets.

A number of producers, including Cenovus and Suncor are looking at ways to add solvents to steam in their commercial operations.

Unlike the solvent-only technique being pitched by Nsolv, this would allow firms to adapt existing thermal plants rather than build new ones, Kuhach said.

Even if pilot steam-and-solvent projects are successful, it would take another three to five years for the technology to spread across the industry, said Dan Wicklum, chief executive of the Canadian Oil Sands Innovation Alliance.

Vancouver-based Chrysalix Venture Capital has become more cautious about new oil sands investments since the oil majors pulled out, Chief Executive Wal van Lierop said, but is investing in technologies that may prove valuable to the sector.

"I am really hoping we can get breakthrough technologies, but I don't see them yet," he said.

"Mediocracy will not help. It will be go big or go home."

Chinese state oil giants take petrol price battle to the pumps - 路透新闻

{{20170618T230002.787+0000}}Chinese state oil giants take petrol price battle to the pumps* Price wars concentrated in over-supplied northern provinces

* Deep discounts at 20-30 pct of pump prices

* Rise of teapot refineries floods market with cheap fuel

By Chen Aizhu

LULIANG, China, June 19 (Reuters) - Chinese state oil giants Sinopec and PetroChina are waging war at the nation's gas pumps, slashing prices at unprecedented rates in an effort to reclaim sales lost to private local and foreign rivals in the $440 billion retail fuel market.

The rare price war kicked off in late March as Sinopec <0386.HK> reported first quarter retail sales had slid to a three-year low. Spurred by a glut of fuel, Sinopec started offering hefty discounts in response to ad-hoc but frequent promotions by independent petrol station operators.

PetroChina <0857.HK> swiftly joined in, triggering a ferocious battle against independents and international firms including Shell and BP , said three state oil sources involved in retail fuel marketing.

The heavy discounting is now spreading from the most heavily oversupplied provinces in China's north, squeezing fat retail profit margins in the world's No. 2 fuel market.

The battle is proving a boon for China's drivers.

In the gritty northern coal town of Luliang, taxi and delivery drivers were queued up at a Sinopec outlet after it slashed pump prices by 1.4 yuan ($0.21) per litre, or nearly a quarter, one recent weekend.

"We all know Sinopec has higher gas quality but it was so expensive, so before I went to independent stations to fill my vehicle," one driver surnamed Zhang told Reuters as he waited to gas up his dusty, grey 7-seat van. "Now I switch to Sinopec and will keep visiting here as long as Sinopec offers discounts like this."

Nearby gas stations run by PetroChina and local private operator Taihua each offered the same discount, promoting the bargain prices with eye-catching red banners, free car washes, and credits in pre-paid petrol cards.

Sinopec spokesman Lu Dapeng said price cutting was "the most common approach in market competition". He didn't elaborate.

RARE DISCOUNTS

Such basement prices are rare for Sinopec, officially known as China Petroleum & Chemical Corp <600028.SS>, and PetroChina, the listed subsidiary of China National Petroleum Corporation.

In late March, both were selling high grade fuel at a discount of just 0.20-0.40 yuan per litre.

"As the independents deepened discounts to unbearable levels, Sinopec responded by launching targeted attacks to reclaim lost sales," said a state oil marketing official.

Price battles were rare before 2013 as rigid government price controls capped margins. As recently as 2010, gas stations rationed diesel fuel as shortage hit.

But the plunge in global oil prices since 2014 and the sudden rise of independent refineries known as teapots transformed the market by flooding the country's 90,000 petrol stations with cheaper fuels.

Short of retail infrastructure and barred from exports, teapots sell oil mostly to the country's 40,000-plus private petrol stations, many run by families or independent fuel dealers

"The huge surplus the teapot oil plants have created is eroding the 80-percent market share the two oil giants used to hold several years ago," said Yan Kefeng, veteran oil researcher with IHS Markit.

Sinopec and PetroChina now control around two-thirds of retail sales and independents about a quarter, according to Yu Chang, a former retail director with Shell China and the founder of AutoGo, a fuel retailing e-platform.

The battle has also drawn in global players such as BP, Shell, Total and Exxon . Foreign firms now own and operate nearly 4,000 stations accounting for about 8 percent of sales, mostly in joint-ventures with Sinopec or PetroChina.

"There has been price volatility in the fuel retailing market with seasonal demand and supply changes," Shell wrote in an email. Shell has rapidly boosted its retail network in China and now has a total of 1,200 sites.

MARGIN HIT

While margins have taken a hit, Sinopec and PetroChina are far from losing money in their retail businesses, thanks to their market dominance in key consuming regions in the south and east where there is little need for discounts and wealthier motorists are less sensitive to price cuts.

Compared to 5.24 yuan a litre in Luliang, Beijing motorists pay around 6.66 yuan for 95-octane, euro-5 quality gasoline. Beijing prices are some 12 percent above the premium gasoline in California, but about half that of Singapore prices.

Sources at rivals say Sinopec may also be leading the charge as it aims to stem falling retail fuel sales and bolster its retail business ahead of a planned multi-billion-dollar IPO.

Even with the hit in sales, Sinopec's network of 30,000 fuel stations and more than 23,000 convenience stores is considered a jewel in the crown. The division is estimated by analysts to be worth as much as $58 billion. [nL4N1EU1X6] ($1 = 6.7973 Chinese yuan renminbi)

BREAKINGVIEWS-U.S. Russia punch lands presidential double whammy - 路透新闻

{{20170616T175334.805+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-U.S. Russia punch lands presidential double whammy(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.)

By Gina Chon

WASHINGTON, June 16 (Reuters Breakingviews) - The U.S. Senate's decision to punch back against Russia has landed a presidential double whammy. Lawmakers in the upper chamber voted overwhelmingly, by 98 to two, to back sanctions on the old enemy as payback for the Kremlin's election meddling. They also took the unusual step of restricting the White House's ability to roll them back.

Russia was already grappling with a series of sanctions the Obama administration imposed after Putin annexed Crimea in 2014. The measures targeted Russian oil firms like Rosneft , Gazprom and Lukoil and prevented the Bank of Moscow , VEB and other financial institutions from securing longer-term U.S. dollar-denominated debt. Foreign firms, meanwhile, had to put projects on hold, like Exxon Mobil's $3.2 billion Arctic oil-exploration deal with Rosneft.

It's up to the Treasury Department to target firms and individuals, but the Senate bill mentions Gazprom's Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline to Europe. Shares in firms financing the $10 billion project, including Shell , Engie and Wintershall, fell on Thursday.

The bill contains more worrying details for Putin. First, senators have given the go-ahead for Treasury to target Russia's railways, shipping, metals and mining sectors. Second, it wants the department to review the potential effects of imposing sanctions on Russia's sovereign debt.

It's bad timing for Russia. Its economy only recently started pulling out of a recession that started in 2014. GDP may only grow by 1.4 percent by 2018, reckons the World Bank. New sanctions could wipe that out.

Putin and his government are not the Senate's only target, though. The bill also prohibits President Donald Trump from softening or removing any of the sanctions without congressional approval. That smacks of an admonishment to a president and an administration whose ties to Russia and Putin have become deeply unsettling.

Various congressional probes have already distracted from a healthcare overhaul and tax reform. Former FBI Chief Robert Mueller has been appointed special counsel to probe Russia's role in last year's U.S. elections – and is investigating whether Trump obstructed justice, the Washington Post reported on Wednesday.

Convincing 98 senators to curb his sanctions power is a remarkable feat, and only likely to be repeated when the bill hits the House. The legislative branch's assertion of its power suggests Trump may face more obstacles pushing his agenda.

CONTEXT NEWS

- The U.S. Senate on June 15 voted 98 to two in favor of legislation that would allow the government to impose new sanctions on Russia and require President Donald Trump to get congressional approval before rolling back any existing sanctions.

- The bill, if also passed by the House of Representatives and signed by Trump, would codify into law penalties outlined in several executive orders on Russian sanctions signed by former President Barack Obama starting in 2014. The proposal also permits the U.S. Treasury to impose new sanctions, if it sees fit, on Russian mining, metals, shipping and railways companies, as well as on Russians involved in cyber attacks or providing weapons to the Syrian government.

- The Senate bill is intended to punish Russia for meddling in the 2016 U.S. election, its annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region and for backing the Syrian government in the country's civil war. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on June 16 that the Russian government takes an extremely negative view of the sanctions, which could harm other countries that have to adhere to the proposed rules.

UPDATE 2-Exxon, partners set $4.4 bln for mega oil project in Guyana - 路透新闻

{{20170616T173426.155+0000}}UPDATE 2-Exxon, partners set $4.4 bln for mega oil project in Guyana(New throughout, adds deal details, updates stock price)

By Ernest Scheyder

June 16 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp said on Friday it and partners would spend $4.4 billion to develop part of the Liza oilfield off the coast of Guyana, approving a megaproject at a time when the oil industry has grown obsessed with lower-cost shale.

Exxon's decision shows that oil companies remain interested in large projects, especially offshore, even in an era of belt-tightening after two years of low crude prices .

The Guyana announcement from Exxon and partners Hess Corp and CNOOC <0883.HK> was the fifth deepwater project to gain approvals this year. BP Plc and Reliance Industries said on Thursday they would spend $6 billion to develop natural gas reserves off the Indian coast.[nL3N1JC47Q]

Exxon, which spent nearly $7 billion earlier this year to more than double its holdings in the Permian shale formation in the United States, said the Guyana project was approved due in part to its low cost of production.

"We're excited about the tremendous potential of the Liza field and accelerating first production through a phased development in this lower cost environment," Liam Mallon, Exxon's head of development, said in a statement.

Phase One of the Liza development project should tap about 450 million barrels of oil and pump about 120,000 barrels per day when it comes online in 2020, Exxon said in a statement.

The Liza field is roughly 190 kilometers off the coast of Guyana. Exxon plans 17 wells as part of the project's first phase. A second phase is possible in the future, the company said.

New York-based Hess said it expects its share of the project's cost to be about $955 million.

Shares of Exxon rose 0.7 percent to $82.97 on Friday.

LEAD 1-Le principal fonds de pension suédois se retire de six compagnies - 路透新闻

{{20170615T191237.571+0000}}LEAD 1-Le principal fonds de pension suédois se retire de six compagnies(Actualisé avec réactions ExxonMobil et Entergy § 5-6-7)

OSLO, 15 juin (Reuters) - Le plus important fonds de pension suédois, AP7, a décidé de revendre les parts qu'il détient dans six entreprises accusées selon lui d'enfreindre l'Accord de Paris sur le climat.

L'AP7, qui finance les retraites de près de 3.5 millions de Suédois, a décidé de sanctionner ExxonMobil , Gazprom , TransCanada Corp , Westar , Entergy et Southern Corp pour violation de l'Accord approuvé par 195 pays en décembre 2015, lors de la Cop21.

"Depuis la dernière évaluation faite en décembre 2016, l'Accord de Paris dans la Convention-cadre des Nations Unies est l'une des règles que nous incluons dans notre évaluation", dit l'AP7 dans un communiqué publié jeudi.

Il note qu'ExxonMobil, Entergy et Southern ont lutté contre l'entrée en vigueur dans la législation américaine de l'Accord sur le climat. Il accuse Gazprom de chercher à exploiter le pétrole dans la partie russe de l'Arctique, et condamne les projets de TransCanada de construire de gros oléoducs en Amérique du Nord.

ExxonMobil a exprimé son désaccord avec la décision prise par l'AP7, qui selon elle, "n'a pas communiqué sur son processus de suivi".

"Nous avons fait entendre haut et fort notre soutien à l'Accord de Paris, dans lequel nous voyons un cadre à l'échelle mondiale afin de limiter les risques du changement climatique", dit l'entreprise dans un communiqué envoyé par email.

Entergy a pour sa part estimé qu'une telle décision était "infondée". "Entergy prône ardemment les politiques de carbone intelligent depuis plus de dix ans.(...) En 2016, nos émissions de CO2 avaient baissé d'environ 20% par rapport à 2000", s'est défendue l'entreprise dans un communiqué.

Les militants écologistes se sont félicités de la décision prise par l'AP7, et ont appelé les autres investisseurs ayant des parts dans les entreprises sanctionnées à suivre cette voie.

"Les investissements socialement responsables sont la clé pour atteindre les objectifs fixés par l'Accord de Paris, et la décision prise par l'AP7 aujourd'hui est une étape importante qui va dans la bonne direction", a dit à Reuters le responsable de Greenpeace Nordic pour la campagne de finance durable.

"Nous espérons que d'autres gros détenteurs de parts, comme le fonds de pension norvégien, feront la même chose", a ajouté Martin Norman. Selon lui, la décision de l'AP7 est le premier cas de cession de parts fondé sur l'Accord de Paris.

UPDATE 2-Swedish pension fund sells out of six firms it says breach Paris climate deal - 路透新闻

{{20170615T184253.705+0000}}UPDATE 2-Swedish pension fund sells out of six firms it says breach Paris climate deal(Adds ExxonMobil response)

By Gwladys Fouche

OSLO, June 15 (Reuters) - Sweden's largest national pension fund, AP7, has sold its investments in six companies that it says violate the Paris climate agreement, a decision environmentalists believe is the first of its kind.

AP7, which provides pensions to 3.5 million Swedes, said on Thursday it had sold out of ExxonMobil , Gazprom , TransCanada Corp , Westar , Entergy and Southern Corp, and would no longer invest in companies that operate in breach of the Paris climate accord.

"Since the last screening in December 2016, the Paris agreement to the U.N. Climate Convention is one of the norms we include in our analysis," the company said in a statement.

AP7 said ExxonMobil, Westar, Southern Corp and Entergy had fought against introducing climate legislation in the United States. It also criticised Gazprom for looking for oil in the Russian Arctic and TransCanada for building large-scale pipelines in North America.

ExxonMobil said that it "respectfully disagrees with the decision of AP7, which has not communicated to us its evaluation process.

"We have been vocal in our support of the Paris climate agreement, which we believe is an effective global framework for mitigating the risk of climate change," the company said in an emailed statement.

Entergy said it was disappointed that an investor had divested and said AP7's decision was "unfortunate in light of the fact that the rationale for the decision seems to be unfounded.

"Entergy has aggressively advocated for smart carbon policies for more than a decade," said the company in an emailed statement. "In 2016, our CO2 emissions were approximately 20 percent below our year 2000 emissions."

The other companies were not immediately available for comment.

Environmental campaigners welcomed the decision and called on other investors to follow suit.

"Responsible investments are key for the world to reach the goals in the Paris agreement, and AP7's action today is an important step in the right direction," said Martin Norman, the head of Greenpeace Nordic's Sustainable Finance Campaign

"We expect other global investors, like the Norwegian wealth fund, to do the same," he told Reuters, adding AP7's decision was the first known divestment by an investor based on the Paris agreement.

Norway's $950 billion sovereign wealth fund, the world's largest, has ethical ambitions. Its chief executive told Reuters on June 2 the fund would ask the banks in which it has invested to disclose how their lending contributes to greenhouse gas emissions [nL8N1IZ57C].

{{20170615T180549.513+0000}}Le principal fonds de pension suédois se retire de six compagniesOSLO, 15 juin (Reuters) - Le plus important fonds de pension suédois, AP7, a décidé de revendre les parts qu'il détient dans six entreprises accusées selon lui d'enfreindre l'Accord de Paris sur le climat.

L'AP7, qui finance les retraites de près de 3.5 millions de Suédois, a décidé de sanctionner ExxonMobil , Gazprom , TransCanada Corp , Westar , Entergy et Southern Corp pour violation de l'Accord approuvé par 195 pays en décembre 2015, lors de la Cop21.

"Depuis la dernière évaluation faite en décembre 2016, l'Accord de Paris dans la Convention-cadre des Nations Unies est l'une des règles que nous incluons dans notre évaluation", dit l'AP7 dans un communiqué publié jeudi.

Il note qu'ExxonMobil, Entergy et Southern ont lutté contre l'entrée en vigueur dans la législation américaine de l'Accord sur le climat. Il accuse Gazprom de chercher à exploiter le pétrole dans la partie russe de l'Arctique, et condamne les projets de TransCanada de construire de gros oléoducs en Amérique du Nord.

Aucune des entreprises n'a souhaité réagir dans l'immédiat.

Les militants écologistes se sont félicités de la décision prise par l'AP7, et ont appelé les autres investisseurs ayant des parts dans les entreprises sanctionnées à suivre cette voie.

"Les investissements socialement responsables sont la clé pour atteindre les objectifs fixés par l'Accord de Paris, et la décision prise par l'AP7 aujourd'hui est une étape importante qui va dans la bonne direction", a dit à Reuters le responsable de Greenpeace Nordic pour la campagne de finance durable.

"Nous espérons que d'autres gros détenteurs de parts, comme le fonds de pension norvégien, feront la même chose", a ajouté Martin Norman. Selon lui, la décision de l'AP7 est le premier cas de cession de parts fondé sur l'Accord de Paris.

Swedish pension fund sells out of 6 firms it says breach Paris climate deal - 路透新闻

{{20170615T164334.100+0000}}Swedish pension fund sells out of 6 firms it says breach Paris climate dealBy Gwladys Fouche

OSLO, June 15 (Reuters) - Sweden's largest national pension fund, AP7, has sold its investments in six companies it accuses of breaching the Paris climate agreement, in a decision environmentalists believe is the first of its kind.

AP7, which provides pensions to 3.5 million Swedes, said on Thursday it had sold out of ExxonMobil , Gazprom , TransCanada Corp , Westar , Entergy and Southern Corp, and would no longer invest in companies that operate in breach of the Paris climate deal.

"Since the last screening in December 2016, the Paris agreement to the U.N. Climate Convention is one of the norms we include in our analysis," the company said in a statement.

AP7 said ExxonMobil, Westar, Southern Corp and Entergy had fought against introducing climate legislation in the United States. It also criticised Gazprom for looking for oil in the Russian Arctic and TransCanada for building large scale pipelines in North America.

None of the companies were immediately available for comment.

Environmental campaigners welcomed the decision and called on other investors to follow suit.

"Responsible investments are key for the world to reach the goals in the Paris agreement, and AP7's action today is an important step in the right direction," said Martin Norman, the head of Greenpeace Nordic's Sustainable Finance Campaign

"We expect other global investors, like the Norwegian wealth fund, to do the same," he told Reuters, adding AP7's decision was the first known divestment by an investor based on the Paris agreement.

Norway's $950-billion sovereign wealth fund, the world's largest, has ethical ambitions. Its CEO told Reuters on June 2 the fund would ask the banks in which it has invested to disclose how their lending contributes to greenhouse gas emissions. [nL8N1IZ57C]

UPDATE 1-Kazakhstan's Tengizchevroil cuts dividends to finance expansion - 路透新闻

{{20170615T095700.850+0000}}UPDATE 1-Kazakhstan's Tengizchevroil cuts dividends to finance expansion(Adds details, context)

ASTANA, June 15 (Reuters) - Tengizchevroil, Kazakhstan's biggest oil producer, has reduced dividend payouts to its shareholders Chevron , ExxonMobil , LUKOIL , and KazMunayGaz , KazMunayGaz's chief executive Sauat Mynbayev said on Thursday.

Mynbayev told reporters Tengizchevroil would also borrow about $20 billion to help finance the $37 billion expansion.

He did not say what the previous and new Tengizchevoil dividends were. The company is privately held and does not disclose dividend data.

Under the expansion plan Tengiz will increase output to 39 million tonnes a year (850,000 barrels per day) by 2022 from about 27 million tonnes currently.

Kazakhstan holds a 20 percent stake in the venture via state oil and gas firm KazMunayGaz. Chevron owns 50 percent, Exxon Mobil has 25 percent and Lukarco, controlled by Russia's LUKOIL, the remaining 5 percent.

Kazakhstan and foreign partners also continue talks on another oil project, Karachaganak, over a financial dispute, Mynbayev said.

Lukoil said last year Kazakhstan had filed a $1.6 billion claim against the consortium developing the Karachaganak gas condensate field. Kazakhstan's energy ministry has said the dispute is about calculations of the parties' shares in the field's output.

"I hope (resolving the dispute) will take less than a year (from now)," Mynbayev said.

Shell and Eni hold stakes of 29.25 percent each in the consortium while Chevron owns 18 percent, Lukoil has around 13.5 percent and KazMunaiGas holds 10 percent.

* Expects 40-50 wells will need to be plugged and abandoned (P&A) per year in coming years, with P&A costs varying from 50 million crowns to several hundred million crowns

* Says fields that were closed after 2011 or are expected to be closed by 2021 account for less than 2 percent of production during that period

* Says oil companies spent 32.5 billion crowns on decommissioning and 8.5 billion crowns on installation removal on the NCS during the last five years

UPDATE 2-Swedish pension fund sells out of six firms it says breach Paris climate deal - 路透新闻

{{20170615T184253.705+0000}}UPDATE 2-Swedish pension fund sells out of six firms it says breach Paris climate deal(Adds ExxonMobil response)

By Gwladys Fouche

OSLO, June 15 (Reuters) - Sweden's largest national pension fund, AP7, has sold its investments in six companies that it says violate the Paris climate agreement, a decision environmentalists believe is the first of its kind.

AP7, which provides pensions to 3.5 million Swedes, said on Thursday it had sold out of ExxonMobil , Gazprom , TransCanada Corp , Westar , Entergy and Southern Corp, and would no longer invest in companies that operate in breach of the Paris climate accord.

"Since the last screening in December 2016, the Paris agreement to the U.N. Climate Convention is one of the norms we include in our analysis," the company said in a statement.

AP7 said ExxonMobil, Westar, Southern Corp and Entergy had fought against introducing climate legislation in the United States. It also criticised Gazprom for looking for oil in the Russian Arctic and TransCanada for building large-scale pipelines in North America.

ExxonMobil said that it "respectfully disagrees with the decision of AP7, which has not communicated to us its evaluation process.

"We have been vocal in our support of the Paris climate agreement, which we believe is an effective global framework for mitigating the risk of climate change," the company said in an emailed statement.

Entergy said it was disappointed that an investor had divested and said AP7's decision was "unfortunate in light of the fact that the rationale for the decision seems to be unfounded.

"Entergy has aggressively advocated for smart carbon policies for more than a decade," said the company in an emailed statement. "In 2016, our CO2 emissions were approximately 20 percent below our year 2000 emissions."

The other companies were not immediately available for comment.

Environmental campaigners welcomed the decision and called on other investors to follow suit.

"Responsible investments are key for the world to reach the goals in the Paris agreement, and AP7's action today is an important step in the right direction," said Martin Norman, the head of Greenpeace Nordic's Sustainable Finance Campaign

"We expect other global investors, like the Norwegian wealth fund, to do the same," he told Reuters, adding AP7's decision was the first known divestment by an investor based on the Paris agreement.

Norway's $950 billion sovereign wealth fund, the world's largest, has ethical ambitions. Its chief executive told Reuters on June 2 the fund would ask the banks in which it has invested to disclose how their lending contributes to greenhouse gas emissions [nL8N1IZ57C].

Le principal fonds de pension suédois se retire de six compagnies - 路透新闻

{{20170615T180549.513+0000}}Le principal fonds de pension suédois se retire de six compagniesOSLO, 15 juin (Reuters) - Le plus important fonds de pension suédois, AP7, a décidé de revendre les parts qu'il détient dans six entreprises accusées selon lui d'enfreindre l'Accord de Paris sur le climat.

L'AP7, qui finance les retraites de près de 3.5 millions de Suédois, a décidé de sanctionner ExxonMobil , Gazprom , TransCanada Corp , Westar , Entergy et Southern Corp pour violation de l'Accord approuvé par 195 pays en décembre 2015, lors de la Cop21.

"Depuis la dernière évaluation faite en décembre 2016, l'Accord de Paris dans la Convention-cadre des Nations Unies est l'une des règles que nous incluons dans notre évaluation", dit l'AP7 dans un communiqué publié jeudi.

Il note qu'ExxonMobil, Entergy et Southern ont lutté contre l'entrée en vigueur dans la législation américaine de l'Accord sur le climat. Il accuse Gazprom de chercher à exploiter le pétrole dans la partie russe de l'Arctique, et condamne les projets de TransCanada de construire de gros oléoducs en Amérique du Nord.

Aucune des entreprises n'a souhaité réagir dans l'immédiat.

Les militants écologistes se sont félicités de la décision prise par l'AP7, et ont appelé les autres investisseurs ayant des parts dans les entreprises sanctionnées à suivre cette voie.

"Les investissements socialement responsables sont la clé pour atteindre les objectifs fixés par l'Accord de Paris, et la décision prise par l'AP7 aujourd'hui est une étape importante qui va dans la bonne direction", a dit à Reuters le responsable de Greenpeace Nordic pour la campagne de finance durable.

"Nous espérons que d'autres gros détenteurs de parts, comme le fonds de pension norvégien, feront la même chose", a ajouté Martin Norman. Selon lui, la décision de l'AP7 est le premier cas de cession de parts fondé sur l'Accord de Paris.

UPDATE 1-Kazakhstan's Tengizchevroil cuts dividends to finance expansion - 路透新闻

{{20170615T095700.850+0000}}UPDATE 1-Kazakhstan's Tengizchevroil cuts dividends to finance expansion(Adds details, context)

ASTANA, June 15 (Reuters) - Tengizchevroil, Kazakhstan's biggest oil producer, has reduced dividend payouts to its shareholders Chevron , ExxonMobil , LUKOIL , and KazMunayGaz , KazMunayGaz's chief executive Sauat Mynbayev said on Thursday.

Mynbayev told reporters Tengizchevroil would also borrow about $20 billion to help finance the $37 billion expansion.

He did not say what the previous and new Tengizchevoil dividends were. The company is privately held and does not disclose dividend data.

Under the expansion plan Tengiz will increase output to 39 million tonnes a year (850,000 barrels per day) by 2022 from about 27 million tonnes currently.

Kazakhstan holds a 20 percent stake in the venture via state oil and gas firm KazMunayGaz. Chevron owns 50 percent, Exxon Mobil has 25 percent and Lukarco, controlled by Russia's LUKOIL, the remaining 5 percent.

Kazakhstan and foreign partners also continue talks on another oil project, Karachaganak, over a financial dispute, Mynbayev said.

Lukoil said last year Kazakhstan had filed a $1.6 billion claim against the consortium developing the Karachaganak gas condensate field. Kazakhstan's energy ministry has said the dispute is about calculations of the parties' shares in the field's output.

"I hope (resolving the dispute) will take less than a year (from now)," Mynbayev said.

Shell and Eni hold stakes of 29.25 percent each in the consortium while Chevron owns 18 percent, Lukoil has around 13.5 percent and KazMunaiGas holds 10 percent.

INSIGHT-Secret rebates send European plastics benchmark above true cost - 路透新闻

{{20170614T060002.756+0000}}INSIGHT-Secret rebates send European plastics benchmark above true cost* Ethylene benchmark written into purchase contracts for plastics

* Index veers from true cost since 2013 because of rebates

* Benchmark provider says not its job to factor in discounts

By Libby George and Karolin Schaps

LONDON, June 14 (Reuters) - An unregulated benchmark used to set the price of plastics in Europe has veered above the true cost in recent years, because of secret rebates chemical companies give each other that disguise the price of the main precursor, four sources familiar with the industry say.

Ethylene, a flammable gas, is the main feedstock used to synthesise the most commonly used plastics, found in the vast majority of all manufactured goods. It is produced in refineries from natural gas or crude oil, as one of the main products of the $400 billion global petrochemicals industry.

When manufacturers buy and sell plastic, a benchmark of the ethylene price is often written into their purchase contracts, to reflect the raw material cost.

But the European index is unregulated and, the sources said, has overstated the actual price for the past four years because it does not take into account the now common practice of firms negotiating rebates.

The sources include one person at a petrochemical company and three people who research the industry.

The actual price companies charge each other for the chemical is secret, and companies tend to offer big clients discounts from the benchmark to reflect economies of scale, local market conditions, or other factors. But those discounts have grown, making the benchmark a less accurate reflection of the real costs.

Companies do not have to pass the rebates on to their customers further down the supply chain, who are contractually obliged to pay prices based on the higher benchmark.

Reuters was unable to assess the degree to which the practice has hurt manufacturers of goods made from plastics. More than 10 companies that buy or sell ethylene, contacted by Reuters, declined to discuss their pricing, including any rebates they offer or receive.

Most of the sources that spoke to Reuters said they did not believe rebates had made the market unfair. But they say the lack of transparency, and the divergence between the published benchmark and the true price, could create the potential for suppliers to overcharge customers who may be unaware of the practice.

"There's an understanding that this is not a perfect process," said Matthew Thoelke, senior director of olefins and derivatives at analysis firm IHS.

The sources said the petrochemical companies that participate in setting the ethylene contract price while giving or receiving rebates include Europe's biggest, such as BASF, Royal Dutch Shell, Total and LyondellBasell. BASF, Shell and Total declined to comment on their pricing. LyondellBasell did not respond to Reuters request for comment.

LEVEL PLAYING FIELD

The benchmark for the price of ethylene used in nearly all European contracts is produced by the Independent Chemical Information Service, or ICIS, which has published its "ethylene contract price" since 1980.

ICIS is now a unit of Reed Business Information. Thomson Reuters, parent company of Reuters, competes with Reed as a supplier of benchmark prices for other commodities but does not publish a rival index price for ethylene.

ICIS senior editor Nel Weddle said the benchmark, published after confirming agreements with at least four companies who buy and sell ethylene, allows everyone to start on a "level playing field" with knowledge of prices.

However, the figures it uses to compile the index do not include rebates off the benchmark price. ICIS said it is not responsible for collecting information about such rebates, which it called "a common part of any supply or purchase contract".

Although ICIS is the most widely used benchmark in Europe, it is not the only one. A competitor, Argus, publishes a rival index, which also does not take rebates into account. It declined to comment.

Another competitor, Platts, has launched a new rival index which it says will better reflect the true market price by taking into account the rebates.

The sources familiar with the practice said refineries began offering substantial rebates in 2013 to clear their stocks during a period of oversupply of ethylene. But instead of being a temporary measure to deal with local market conditions, the rebates grew after oil and gas prices tumbled in 2014, and have continued to widen since.

The contract price of ethylene has hovered around 850-1,050 euros per tonne over the past year, down from a range of 1,200-1,300 euros before oil and gas prices fell in 2014. Rebates now run at more than 100 euros a tonne, the sources said.

One of the sources, at a major research consultancy, said his firm's staff use their own contacts at chemical companies to get a sense of the secret rebates. The rebates are now a key to understanding the profitability of businesses in the sector, which is therefore harder to forecast solely from public data.

Weddle of ICIS said the company was not aware of complaints from users of its benchmark about its omission of the rebates.

However, last year ICIS conducted a review of its methodology and posted feedback online from some users of the index. One of three respondents whose views ICIS posted wrote that the published prices should begin to reflect rebates.

"Otherwise, the reported contract prices do not reflect the real market situation and especially smaller suppliers and consumers are left in the dark," the respondent wrote. ICIS confirmed that the response was genuine but declined to identify who had written it.

Some in the industry who spoke to Reuters sought to play down the significance of the disparity between the index and the price after rebates, saying the market is competitive enough to prevent customers who rely on the benchmark being overcharged.

While Europe's benchmarks have their problems, "the situation in general is fair", said Jose Manuel Martinez, the chief executive of the Spanish oil company Cepsa's petrochemicals business.

NO REGULATION

Unlike benchmarks for crude oil or the major refined fuel products like diesel and gasoline, the ICIS benchmark for ethylene is not formally scrutinised by regulators, as ethylene contracts are not typically traded on securities exchanges.

In the marketing materials for the rival Platts benchmark intended to address the problem by adjusting for rebates, Platts includes a graph comparing the contract price to what it says is its own assessment of the true price, based on the cost of raw materials, economic conditions and other fundamentals.

The graph shows the ICIS contract price consistently higher than Platts' estimate from 2013 on, with the gap growing wider last year, when Platts estimates the true cost of ethylene bottomed out as low as 650 euros a tonne.

Platts says the early indications from its new index have shown large buyers typically receiving rebates of 14-18 percent.

The issue appears mostly confined to Europe, rather than the United States or Asia, which have more liquid markets with higher volumes of spot trade of ethylene, making prices relatively transparent.

"As long as a market is liquid, the players know how to behave," said Cepsa's Martinez.

UPDATE 1-Qatar closes helium plants amid rift with Arab powers - 路透新闻

{{20170613T184654.261+0000}}UPDATE 1-Qatar closes helium plants amid rift with Arab powers* Early sign of possible impact on global commodities markets

* Closed land crossing with Saudi Arabia has frozen exports

* Consumers tap inventory, search for new suppliers or routes

(Adds context, comments from industry participants)

By Stephen Kalin and Tom Finn

DUBAI/DOHA, June 13 (Reuters) - Qatar, the world's second largest helium producer, has closed its two helium production plants because of the economic boycott imposed by other Arab states, industry sources told Reuters on Tuesday.

The helium plants operated by RasGas, a subsidiary of state-owned Qatar Petroleum [QATPE.UL] (QP), were shut after Saudi Arabia closed its border with Qatar, blocking overland exports of the gas, a QP official told Reuters. RasGas is 70 percent owned by QP and U.S. giant Exxon Mobil has 30 percent.

The official declined to be named under briefing rules. Phil Kornbluth, head of U.S.-based industry consultancy Kornbluth Helium Consulting, said his sources had confirmed the closure.

The closure of the plants is a sign of how the rift between Qatar and Arab powers could affect commodities markets. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Bahrain cut diplomatic and transport ties last week, accusing Qatar of supporting terrorism, a charge Doha denies.

Qatar's exports of liquefied natural gas at Ras Laffan have been unaffected by the boycott.

The impact on the global helium market was expected to be delayed, as consumers use up existing stocks and work out alternative supply options. Shipping by sea directly from Doha or through Oman would add complexity, risk and cost.

But if the diplomatic dispute lasts a month or more, Kornbluth predicted there would be a global shortage and the last time that happened, prices doubled.

"Helium is the single commodity that is affected most by this blockade because it's probably the only thing where Qatar is a major world producer and the supply has been completely cut off," he said.

Among its uses, helium is used to cool superconducting magnets in medical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanners, as a lifting gas in balloons and airships, as a gas to breathe in deep-sea diving and to keep satellite instruments cool. It is derived from natural gas during processing.

The two plants shut by Qatar have a combined annual production capacity of approximately 2 billion standard cubic feet of liquid helium and can meet about 25 percent of total world demand for the gas, according to RasGas' website.

Kornbluth said the helium plants had shut down after filling all available shipping containers and storage tanks. He forecast the closure was costing RasGas revenue.

FINDING NEW SUPPLIES

Helium, best known as a gas for filling party balloons and making the voice squeaky, is difficult to capture and store. The United States is the biggest producer in what is a $4.7 billion industry, according to Mordor Intelligence.

Demand for the gas, driven particularly by Asia's booming manufacturing industry, is on the rise.

U.S. reserves meanwhile are dwindling due to the lack of helium production from its oil and gas fields, and the country has already had to start importing helium from Qatar. Other helium-producing countries include Algeria, Russia, Canada and China, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.

A Dubai-based vendor servicing the local market said on Tuesday it had not received new shipments from Qatar since last week, forcing it to dip into its stocks.

Japan's Iwatani <8088.T>, which supplies helium to China and Southeast Asia, said it had a month's supply in stock. A spokesman told Reuters it was considering exporting on ships from a Qatari port, or sourcing from the United States.

German industrial gases company Linde said it was working on meeting customers' requirements via helium sources in Australia, Algeria and the United States.

Air Water <4088.T>, which imports from Qatar and sells in Japan, has shifted its helium supply automatically to the United States, a spokesman said.

A source with direct knowledge of the matter said South Korea's importers, which source a third of their helium from Qatar, could suffer heavily.

"We might have an indirect impact if U.S. helium prices go up," the source said.

UPDATE 1-Exxon Baytown refinery begins planned HCU overhaul -sources - 路透新闻

{{20170613T152707.356+0000}}UPDATE 1-Exxon Baytown refinery begins planned HCU overhaul -sources(Adds details on work, background on unit)

HOUSTON, June 13 (Reuters) - ExxonMobil Corp began a planned overhaul of the hydrocracking unit at its 560,500 barrel per day (bpd) Baytown, Texas, refinery on Monday night, sources familiar with plant operations said on Tuesday.

Exxon spokesman Michael Ashton said on Tuesday that planned maintenance was underway at the refinery but did not identify the units involved.

The 25,000 bpd hydrocracking unit is expected to be shut until late July or early August to complete the overhaul.

The hydrocracker at the Baytown refinery uses hydrogen under high heat and pressure in the presence of a catalyst to convert distillate feedstocks into motor fuels, primarily diesel.

BlackRock urges Exxon to disclose more about climate change-related risks - 路透新闻

{{20170610T002040.319+0000}}BlackRock urges Exxon to disclose more about climate change-related risksJune 9 (Reuters) - The world's largest asset manager BlackRock Inc on Friday urged Exxon Mobil Corp to "enhance its disclosures" regarding risks related to climate change.

Less than two weeks ago, shareholders approved a measure calling for increased transparency on climate change, a resolution supported by BlackRock and other large institutional funds. [nL1N1IX15V]

BlackRock also said it requested to meet Exxon's independent directors over the past two years.

However, the world's largest publicly traded oil company declined to make directors available, citing a non-engagement policy between board members and shareholders.

BlackRock is Exxon's third largest investor with a more than 4 percent stake, according to Thomson Reuters data.

Exxon was not immediately available for a comment.

UPDATE 1-Exxon calls NY prosecutor's climate change probe 'harassment' in filing - 路透新闻

{{20170609T201419.383+0000}}UPDATE 1-Exxon calls NY prosecutor's climate change probe 'harassment' in filing(Adds details on Tillerson's emails)

By Ernest Scheyder and Emily Flitter

June 9 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp asked a New York court on Friday to reject another subpoena request from Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, arguing the prosecutor's recent claim to have found evidence Exxon misled investors was false and that he was abusing his investigative powers.

The company said Schneiderman's allegation it had neglected to estimate the impact of future environmental regulation on new deals was "frivolous" and that no "legitimate law enforcement need" would be served by giving his office more documents.

"For a prosecutor proceeding in good faith, the absence of any evidence of wrongdoing is grounds for closing an investigation, not expanding it," Exxon wrote in its filing with the court.

Schneiderman's office denied the allegations.

"As detailed in our filing last week, the Attorney General's office has a substantial basis to suspect that Exxon's proxy cost analysis may have been a sham," said Amy Spitalnick, a spokeswoman for the New York attorney general. "This office takes potential misrepresentations to investors very seriously and will vigorously seek to enforce this subpoena. We look forward to next week's hearing."

Schneiderman sought more materials from the oil producer as part of an ongoing probe that has already reviewed nearly 3 million documents. He is examining whether Exxon misled the public about its understanding of the effects of greenhouse gas emissions on the earth's climate. [nL1N1IZ0N6]

The probe has already revealed Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who until December was chief executive of Exxon, used a separate email address and an alias, "Wayne Tracker," to discuss climate change-related issues while at the company. [nL2N1GQ1T7]

Testimony Schneiderman made public on June 2 offered more details about how the company handled the "Wayne Tracker" account, which was first created in 2007. Exxon employee Connie Feinstein, an information technology manager for the oil company, told prosecutors changes in the email program Exxon used, along with an automatic process that deleted internal emails after 13 months, may have erased years' worth of "Wayne Tracker" emails.

"We realized that the automated file sweeper had not been disabled for a period of time as it should have been," Feinstein said in the April 26 interview.

Exxon has been fighting Schneiderman's requests for information about its climate change policies in both state and federal court, claiming it should not have to turn over records because the New York prosecutor's probe is politically motivated.

The case is People of the State of New York v PricewaterhouseCoopers and Exxon Mobil Corporation, New York State Supreme Court, New York County, No. 451962/2016.

June 9 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp on Friday asked a New York court to reject the latest subpoena request from the state's top prosecutor and called his climate change probe "reckless."

New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman has requested more materials from the oil producer as part of an ongoing probe that has already reviewed nearly 3 million documents.[nL1N1IZ0N6]

The attorney general, who also wants to interview Exxon employees, has said Exxon withheld information about its internal climate change discussions and misled the public about what it knew.[nL1N1IZ0N6]

In a court filing on Friday, Exxon blasted what it called "reckless and false allegations" from Schneiderman and said it has not withheld information.

"For a prosecutor proceeding in good faith, the absence of any evidence of wrongdoing is grounds for closing an investigation, not expanding it," Exxon wrote in its filing with the court.

The Texas-based company accused Schneiderman of abusing the power of his office and using the probe to advance his political ambitions.

"Lacking any basis in the facts or in proportionality, these subpoenas cannot be allowed to stand," Exxon said in a request to the court.

Schneiderman's office denied the allegations.

"As detailed in our filing last week, the Attorney General's office has a substantial basis to suspect that Exxon's proxy cost analysis may have been a sham," said Amy Spitalnick, a spokeswoman for the New York attorney general. "This office takes potential misrepresentations to investors very seriously and will vigorously seek to enforce this subpoena. We look forward to next week's hearing."

RPT-ANALYSIS-Rising Kashagan output weighs on Kazakhstan's CPC oil price - 路透新闻

{{20170608T125202.872+0000}}RPT-ANALYSIS-Rising Kashagan output weighs on Kazakhstan's CPC oil price(Repeats to additional subscriber service)

* Investors in delayed Kashagan project keen lift output

* Extra CPC flows pile pressure on heavily discounted grade

* Limits on Mediterranean demand pushes CPC to Asia

By Olga Yagova

MOSCOW, June 8 (Reuters) - One of the world's fastest growing crude streams, Kazakhstan's CPC, is battling to find new buyers in a market saturated with light grades and with core European customers reluctant to buy more of the pungent oil blend even as its value has plunged.

It is a familiar picture for oil producers which have struggled with oversupply in the past three years, sending oil prices from above $100 a barrel to less than $50 a now.

But it is proving a particular challenge for Kazakhstan, which has joined the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other non-OPEC nations in a pact to reduce output.

Under the deal, Astana pledged to keep overall production at 1.7 million barrels per day (bpd). At the same time, it needs to reward investors in its giant Kashagan oil project that produces CPC but which started up last year five years behind schedule.

So Astana is letting oil firms hike output from Kashagan in the Caspian Sea, which means it must cut from elsewhere. But the extra flows are piling pressure on CPC's already falling value.

In 2013, light CPC crude traded at an average annual premium of $0.15 a barrel to dated Brent, then during 2014-2016 it slid to a discount of $0.11-$0.18. In the first five months of 2017, the discount had widened further to as much as $1.23.

"Now it is more expensive to delay Kashagan again rather than sell discounted CPC Blend. Shareholders need the project to work now," said one trader.

Kashagan oil field has been developed by a consortium of China National Petroleum Corp [CNPET.UL], Exxon Mobil , Eni , Royal Dutch Shell , Total , Inpex <1605.T> and KazMunaiGas . Phase one cost $55 billion.

Rising output from Kashagan has pushed up oil flows through the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC) pipeline to the Black Sea port of Novorossiisk.

The pipeline, which also transports oil from other parts of Kazakhstan and Russia, pumped an average of 700,000 bpd in the past decade. But after Kashagan production began at the end of 2016, volumes rose to 900,000 bpd last year.

That figure could rise this year to 1.2 million-1.3 million bpd, according to Caspian pipeline consortium which manages the pipeline. [nL8N1IE3HB]

"The CPC Blend market is tough," said one trader in the Mediterranean, traditionally the biggest market for the crude. "What's frightening is that we will have about 10 million tonnes extra of the grade to handle soon."

MEDITERRANEAN RESTRICTIONS

Selling any light crude has been made tough due to cuts by OPEC, whose members have tended to reduce output of heavier oil preferred by some refiners, leaving the market awash with lighter grades. But CPC has characteristics that add to the challenge.

Unlike Russia's main Urals export blend, CPC is a more difficult fit for refiners because it has a high level of mercaptans, a group of pungent gases.

"In some Mediterranean refineries, CPC Blend processing is simply restricted due to the smell and harmful emissions, while it is also corrosive, so you can only process it if you have anti-corrosive coat on refinery units," another trader said.

In addition, more larger Suezmax crude carriers are being used to ship CPC as exports from Novorossiisk increase while the number of loading time slots remains limited. Some European ports will only take smaller Aframax vessels, traders said.

This is pushing the blend to markets further afield.

"Mediterranean refiners are not very keen on CPC, so the grade is now flowing worldwide, from Poland to Japan," a source with a big European refiner said.

Reuters Eikon data shows CPC Blend supplies to Asia increased sharply since the start of 2017, heading to markets where bigger Suezmax vessels help reduce transport costs.

South Korea, India and Japan bought 800,000 tonnes, 700,000 tonnes and 600,000 tonnes of CPC respectively in January-May 2017. In the whole of 2016, those three countries bought 400,000 tonnes, 500,000 tonnes and 600,000 tonnes respectively.

Elsewhere in Europe, Poland's PKN Orlen bought 700,000 tonnes of CPC this year for its Polish and Lithuanian refineries for the first time. [nL5N1GK53P]

But rising CPC shipments beyond its core Mediterranean market have not been enough to support its value. The grade that formerly balanced between premium and discount to BFOE has been traded far below dated Brent crude for six months, the longest period in its history, Reuters Eikon data showed.

"I don't think CPC Blend differentials will bounce back to a premium to Brent anytime soon. Not in the current market," one trader in the Mediterranean market said.

FOKUS 5-Wall Street tritt vor Westminster-Wahlen auf der Stelle - 路透新闻

{{20170607T173838.434+0000}}FOKUS 5-Wall Street tritt vor Westminster-Wahlen auf der Stelle* Börsianer blicken gespannt auf Großbritannien

* Auch EZB-Ratssitzung und Comey-Aussage im Blick

* Ausverkauf am Ölmarkt

(neu: Fokus auf Wall Street)

New York, 07. Jun (Reuters) - Kurz vor einem ereignisreichen Donnerstag haben sich Investoren an der Wall Street zurückgehalten. Die wichtigsten Indizes zeigten sich im New Yorker Nachmittagshandel fast unverändert. Mit Spannung blicken auch US-Anleger nach Großbritannien, wo am Donnerstag ein neues Parlament gewählt wird. Das Abschneiden der Konservativen um Premierministerin Theresa May könnte darüber entscheiden, ob das Land weiter eng mit der EU zusammenarbeitet oder ob es einen "harten Brexit" gibt.

Für Aufsehen sorgt am Donnerstag auch der Auftritt des geschassten FBI-Chefs James Comey, der vor einem Ausschuss des US-Senates befragt wird. Die Investmentexpertin Lizz Ann Sonders von der Bank Charles Schwab sagte allerdings, Comeys Aussage müsste schon schockierend sein, um die Märkte zu bewegen. Drittes Großereignis am Donnerstag ist die EZB-Ratssitzung in Frankfurt.

Der Dow Jones<.DJI> mit den 30 Standardwerten lag bei 21.134 Punkten, der S&P 500<.SPX> verharrte etwa bei 2428 Zählern und der Nasdaq notierte mit 6275 Stellen. In Frankfurt war der Dax<.GDAXI> mit einem Minus von 0,1 Prozent aus dem Handel gegangen.

Auf dem Ölmarkt kam es zum Ausverkauf: Ein Fass der US-Sorte WTI verbilligt sich um 4,7 Prozent auf 45,94 Dollar je Barrel. Hintergrund sind Zweifel, ob die Förderbremse des Ölländerverbandes Opec hält. In der Staatengruppe selbst gibt es etwa zwischen Saudi-Arabien und Katar Streit. Zudem steigt die Ölproduktion in den USA, die nicht Mitglied in der Opec sind. Der sinkende Rohstoffpreis zog auch die Aktien von ExxonMobil und Chevron nach unten, die um 0,6 beziehungsweise ein Prozent nachgaben.

Um 3,3 Prozent ging es für den Lastwagenbauer Navistar bergab. Das Unternehmen, an dem Volkswagen beteiligt ist, hatte einen Quartalsverlust bekanntgegeben.

CORRECTED-Investors expect to meet with Exxon on climate-impact report - 路透新闻

{{20170607T162619.664+0000}}CORRECTED-Investors expect to meet with Exxon on climate-impact report(Corrects paragraph 8 to show the shareholder vote on the study proposal was at Marathon Petroleum, not Marathon Oil)

By Gary McWilliams

HOUSTON, June 1 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp investors will push to meet with oil company officials this summer to hash out elements of a climate-impact analysis following a shareholder vote calling for studies of technology and climate-related risks to its business.

Exxon has said that it will reconsider its opposition to the request, not that it would begin discussions or initiate new studies. The shareholder proposal, filed by 54 groups including financial, religious and corporate governance activists, won the support on Wednesday of 62 percent of Exxon holders. [nL1N1IX15V]

"I anticipate we'll be having a meeting this summer," said Tracey Rembert, assistant director of Catholic Responsible Investing at Christian Brothers Investment Services, one of the 54 co-filers.

The White House's decision on Thursday to withdraw from the Paris agreement on climate change has no bearing on the proposal. "We expect the scenario assessment will start to be done quickly at Exxon," Rembert said. [nL1N1IY0MV]

The investors behind the proposal routinely met in past years with Exxon between December and February to discuss annual meeting proposals, she said. Earlier discussions because of the majority vote are in order.

Rembert said the group will ask for Exxon to conduct scenario planning exercises that would look at risks from disruptive technology, climate or government policies. "What are the black swan events that can take place beyond low oil prices, aggressive policies or shifting consumer preferences?" she said.

The reconsideration at Exxon comes as Devon Energy and Hess Corp owners on Wednesday will weigh climate-impact resolutions.

Ballot initiatives press for greater studies of the risk that government carbon-reduction efforts in the future make oil and gas reserves uneconomic to tap, leading to investment losses. Study proposals this year received at least 40 percent approval at Duke Energy , Marathon Petroleum and Southern Co , according to a tally by Ceres, a non-profit group that tracks environmental records of public companies.

"When investors make a very strong statement at a company the size of Exxon Mobil, other competitors in their industry take notice and may reconsider or rethink their investor dialogue on these issues," said Bruce Goldfarb, chief executive of proxy solicitor Okapi Partners. [nL1N1IX2E2]

The Exxon shareholder vote will have minor influence because most of the ballots likely were already cast, said Danielle Fugere, president of As You Sow, a shareholder advocacy group seeking a carbon-risk study at Hess. Last year, its proposal was backed by about 23 percent of Hess holders.

Hess's vice president of investor relations, Jay Wilson, said the company talks regularly with large shareholders but declined to comment on any discussions since the Exxon vote. Devon didn't respond to requests for comment. Directors at both oil companies oppose the studies. [nL1N1IE20Q]

Exxon says Qatar LNG not affected by Arab states tension - 路透新闻

{{20170606T192616.415+0000}}Exxon says Qatar LNG not affected by Arab states tensionBy Ernest Scheyder

June 6 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp said on Tuesday that production and exports of liquefied natural gas from Qatar have not been affected by rising diplomatic tensions in the Middle East.

Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt on Monday cut ties with Qatar, accusing the country of supporting extremism. Qatar denies the allegations. [nL3N1J226R] [nL8N1J30YR]

The growing diplomatic rift has raised concerns about global access to Qatar's LNG, especially after some regional ports in the Persian Gulf said they would not accept Qatari-flagged vessels.[nL3N1J33A3]

Commodities traders have grown concerned Qatar's LNG could be barred from Saudi Arabia or from traversing Egypt's Suez Canal, though so far no limitations have been imposed.

Maersk , the world's biggest container shipping line, said on Tuesday it can no longer transport goods in or out of Qatar in the wake of the diplomatic rift.[nL8N1J34FL]

Qatar and Exxon have had development agreements for more than a decade, with Exxon helping Qatar to become the world's largest LNG exporter. Exxon, working with government-controlled energy company Qatar Petroleum [QATPE.UL], has invested in LNG-processing plants, transport ships and related infrastructure.

The pair, which earlier this year were awarded a contract to explore for gas off the coast of Cyprus, also control the Golden Pass LNG facility in the United States with ConocoPhillips . [nL5N1HD2K6]

Despite the diplomatic tension with other Arab States, a key Qatari gas export pipeline to the United Arab Emirates is still operating. Exxon said its production and export of LNG from Qatar have not been affected. [nL8N1J33XB]

"As a matter of practice, we don't comment on matters between governments," Exxon spokesman Alan Jeffers said in a statement to Reuters.

Exxon has said that a large portion of its Qatari LNG production is under long-term supply contracts, meaning the company must supply gas from Qatar or some other source. Exxon does have a large LNG operation in Papua New Guinea.

Qatar has reassured clients in Japan and India that LNG shipments will not be affected by the tension. [nL3N1J21XS][nT9N1EB00Q]

Shares of Texas-based Exxon rose 1.3 percent to $81.19 in Tuesday afternoon trading.

UPDATE 1-Equatorial Guinea sees Fortuna FLNG off-taker decision in August - 路透新闻

{{20170605T162621.705+0000}}UPDATE 1-Equatorial Guinea sees Fortuna FLNG off-taker decision in August(recasts, adds details)

By Wendell Roelf

CAPE TOWN, June 5 (Reuters) - Equatorial Guinea has short-listed Royal Dutch Shell and oil traders Gunvor [GGL.UL] and Vitol [VITOLV.UL] for an off-take agreement at its Fortuna floating liquefied natural gas (FLNG) export terminal and expects to make a final decision by August, its oil minister said on Monday.

Fortuna FLNG will be Africa's first deepwater floating liquefaction facility, with production capacity of 2.2 million tonnes per year and an estimated start-up in 2020.

"Our criteria for selection (of the preferred off-taker) is very simple - whoever gives more money. So, whoever provides the biggest cash and good terms and alternatives to the state," Gabriel Obiang Lima, minister of mines and hydrocarbons, said at a press conference on Monday in Cape Town

"Clearly the ball is with the off-takers. We have already had discussions with them," he said.

British oil and gas explorer Ophir Energy said in May it plans to borrow $1.2 billion from Chinese banks to back the development of Fortuna. [nL8N1IA5B5]

Addressing delegates at an African oil and gas conference earlier, Obiang Lima said he saw scope for adding another two FLNG terminals by year-end, as demand for LNG grew particularly on the continent.

He said the latest OPEC member, who joined the oil producing cartel in May, has entered into a binding agreement with OneLNG SA to explore the liquefaction and commercialisation of natural gas in offshore Blocks O and I.

OneLNG is a joint venture between Golar LNG and Schlumberger to rapidly develop gas reserves into LNG.

"That combination will give us a lot of flexibility," Obiang Lima said.

He also named the winners of the 2016 licensing round for onshore and offshore blocks, with Ophir Energy among seven companies that included firms from Israel, Ireland and South Africa, who were awarded seven blocks.

Earlier Equatorial Guinea, a former Spanish colony and Sub-Saharan Africa's third largest oil producer, signed a production-sharing contract for offshore block EG-11 with U.S. oil major ExxonMobil , for one of the blocks on offer.

"Block EG-11 is the jewel among a group of already very prospective blocks that we are signing in 2017," Obiang Lima said in a statement.

ExxonMobil already operates Zafiro field, the largest oil producing field in Equatorial Guinea, and Obiang Lima said the country intended raising oil output to 300,000 bpd by 2020.

UPDATE 3-Qatar's dispute with Arab states puts LNG market on edge - 路透新闻

{{20170605T143148.306+0000}}UPDATE 3-Qatar's dispute with Arab states puts LNG market on edge* Qatar is world's biggest exporter of LNG

* Potential impact on LNG shipments to Egypt, UAE

* LNG traders alert to trade shocks, contingency planning

(Adds UAE ban on Qatari LNG tankers in anchorage zone)

By Henning Gloystein and Oleg Vukmanovic

SINGAPORE/LONDON, June 5 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia and key allies on Monday cut ties with Qatar, the world's top seller of liquefied natural gas (LNG), stoking concern over any supply disruptions to neighbouring countries spilling over into global gas markets.

Saudi Arabia, along with the United Arab Emirates and Egypt - both highly reliant on Qatari gas via pipeline and LNG - and Bahrain said they would sever all ties including transport links with Qatar, an escalation on past diplomatic spats. [nL3N1J21X4]

They accuse Qatar, which supplies roughly a third of global LNG - natural gas that has been converted to liquid form for export - of supporting extremism.

U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who accompanied President Donald Trump on his trip to Saudi Arabia last month, was CEO of Exxon Mobil - Qatar's key Western partner in building its giant LNG export plants.

As the rift lifted oil prices, LNG traders took a wait-and-see approach, alert to potential disruption of regional energy flows but erring on the assumption that any trade shocks could be contained given well supplied global markets.

Qatar's top clients in Japan and India quickly received reassurances that supplies would continue as usual. [nL3N1J21XS] [nT9N1EB00Q]

Within hours of the diplomatic break, the UAE barred all vessels coming to or from Qatar using its popular anchorage point off Fujairah. [nL8N1J22XN]

The ban impacts about six LNG vessels linked to Qatar now anchored in the Fujairah zone which may need to be moved out, according to shipping data on Thomson Reuters.

But there was little sign yet of LNG supply being hit.

"I cannot see this impacting exports of Qatari LNG outside the Arab world at all and it won't likely impact LNG and gas pipeline exports within the Arab world either," Morten Frisch, an independent LNG and gas industry consultant, said.

Still, traders startled by the development began to plan for all eventualities, especially any upsets to piped gas supplies from Qatar to the UAE.

The UAE consumes 1.8 billion cubic feet/day of Qatari gas via the Dolphin pipeline, and has LNG purchase agreements with its neighbour, leaving it doubly exposed to tit-for-tat measures, industry sources and traders said.

So far flows through Dolphin are unaffected but traders say even a partial shutdown would ripple through global gas markets by forcing the UAE to seek replacement LNG supply just as its domestic demand peaks.

With LNG markets in bearish mood and demand weak, the UAE could cope with Qatar suspending its two to three monthly LNG deliveries by calling on international markets, but Dolphin piped flows are too large to fully replace.

"A drop off in Dolphin deliveries would have a huge impact on LNG markets," one trader monitoring developments said.

Spot LNG prices have not yet reacted.

Egypt, while relying heavily on Qatari LNG brought in by Swiss commodity trade houses, is less vulnerable than the UAE because it has no direct deals with Qatar, domestic gas output is squeezing out the need for imports, and traders would be liable for any moves by Qatar to restrict exports.

"Trafigura, Glencore and Vitol frequently take LNG from Qatar and deliver it to Egypt but they take ownership of the cargoes at the Qatari port and don't use Qatari ships, meaning technically that Qatar shouldn't have sway," one trade source said.

In reality though, Qatar can block exports to certain countries by issuing so-called destination restrictions.

"It's not clear yet," another LNG trader said of potential impacts to deliveries from Qatar to Egypt.

Egypt is halfway through its annual LNG cargo delivery programme for the year, with 50 shipments left to arrive, of which at least 10 are of Qatari origin, a Cairo-based energy source said.

Retaliatory measures such as suspending LNG supply deals would leave Qatar free to push more volumes into Europe where it has access to several import terminals.

Under that scenario, trade houses with supply commitments to Egypt could turn to the United States, Algeria and Nigeria for replacement cargoes, traders and industry sources said.

The deterioration in ties between Qatar and Egypt contrasts with 2013 when the producer gifted five LNG cargoes to Egypt - when Mohamed Mursi, leader of the Muslim Brotherhood, served as president.

* Carbon credit hike could insulate more U.S. oil from future busts

* Occidental, Exxon, Chevron among the potential winners

* Congress to consider boosting tax credit this summer

By Ernest Scheyder

HOBBS, New Mexico, June 5 (Reuters) - Amid the frenetic activity of American shale oilfields recovering from a two-year recession sit a handful of oil towns that seemed impervious as many producers went into bankruptcy and the economy around them sank.

Occidental Petroleum Corp and a few other oil producers with wells near this town on New Mexico's border with Texas steadily pumped low-cost oil through the downturn, using a technique that has been heralded worldwide as a way to reduce carbon emissions and boost oil output.

"When everyone else in the oil industry was going down, Oxy kept working," said Joshua Grassham, vice president of Lea County State Bank and a Hobbs Chamber of Commerce board member. The city of 35,000 rests on the Permian oilfield, the largest oilfield in the United States.

This way of drilling brings with it a sweetener for the oil industry to keep crude flowing: a tax credit that helps insulate these wells in a downturn, and could triple in size if Congress approves a new measure this summer.

Such a move could extend by decades the producing life of hundreds more wells, increasing oil supply which would be a drag on prices. To date, the technique has been employed only at conventional oilfields, rather than on shale deposits. Some firms are studying how to put the technique to work in shale drilling, too.

The drilling method harnesses the carbon dioxide produced during the extraction of oil or from power plants, and forces it back into the fields. That boosts the pressure underground and drives more oil to the surface.

Their success could be replicated in oilfields across the United States if Congress approves the measure, which already enjoys broad bipartisan support. While the Trump administration has yet to say whether it supports the tax credit increase, the measure could also be a boon to the coal industry, which Trump wants to revitalize.

The technique, one of several so-called enhanced oil recovery (EOR) strategies used to prolong the productive lifespan of oilfields and increase output, underpins around five percent of U.S. oil output, or about 450,000 barrels per day, according to energy consultancy Advanced Resources International.

EOR can help firms to produce between 30 percent and 60 percent of all the oil held in a reservoir. That's far more than the 10 percent usually recovered from initial traditional drilling, according to the Department of Energy.

The existing credit has provided a financial lift for Occidental, Denbury Resources Inc and oil producers with ready access to the gas. Exxon Mobil Corp and Chevron Corp also use the technique on some of their oil fields. None detail their tax savings from the credit, but since the it was first offered in 2008, companies have collected at least $350 million in the credits, according to Internal Revenue Service figures.

In Hobbs, Occidental not only kept a 200-person workforce intact during the oil-price downturn - when tens of thousands of workers were laid off in the shale patch - it also invested $250 million to expand operations during that period, according to its public filings.

That meant Hobbs and nearby Seminole, Texas, where Hess Corp has its own carbon dioxide injection facility, didn't suffer the extreme financial pain felt by shale towns, such as Williston, North Dakota, and other shale producing communities in 2015 and 2016.[nL2N17Z0ZS]

"Oxy's investment in the carbon project was a huge economic boost to our area," Grassham said.

Some of the carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, comes from naturally occurring reservoirs that are a low-cost source for Occidental. Others get the gas piped from power plants that burn coal. Power companies hope the technique can help them avoid higher carbon emissions.

The company spends about $18 to $25 per barrel to collect oil from its enhanced oil recovery operations. In contrast, its shale-focused well costs are lower - $16 to $19 per barrel. But because EOR wells pump consistently for decades, their value to the company over time exceeds shale wells, whose production quickly tapers off.

Across Texas and New Mexico, Occidental runs one of the world's largest fleet of enhanced oil recovery projects, injecting 2 billion cubic feet of carbon dioxide each day into wells that first produced oil nearly a century ago.

"We had a very large, stable carbon dioxide EOR business in our portfolio during the downturn," said Jody Elliott, president of Occidental's American operations. "That helped."

Partly because of its carbon facilities, Occidental was able to raise its dividend during the downturn. Today, executives are using the profits from the carbon business to grow its shale business across the Permian, the largest acreage holding in the region.

"These two businesses play very well off of each other," Elliott said.

TAX CHANGE?

Congress is expected this summer to debate extending an existing tax credit that could pave way for wider use. The proposed Carbon Capture Utilization and Storage Act would boost the credit to $35 per metric ton of carbon dioxide, up from $10 per ton today.

The legislation failed to move forward during last year's heated presidential campaign, but supporters say it will be reintroduced soon. "We want to make sure that we show a strong commitment so we continue to develop these technologies," said North Dakota Senator Heidi Heitkamp, a Democrat and the bill's lead sponsor.

Electricity generator NRG Energy Inc earlier this year opened a $1.04 billion carbon capture facility at a Texas coal-fired power plant, using its carbon dioxide emissions to extract crude from a 1930s-era oilfield.[nL1N1EZ1Q4]

Expanding the credit could, supporters hope, encourage more coal-fired power plants to follow NRG's lead by capturing and selling carbon to oil producers. Most oilfields are not located near carbon dioxide supplies, so the tax credit also could spur the build-out of carbon pipelines.

Environmentalists, including the Sierra Club, like the process because it traps carbon underground, preventing it from contributing to greenhouse gas emissions.

"You'll put more carbon in the ground than oil that is produced," said Vello Kuuskraa, president of consultancy Advanced Resources International, which studies enhanced oil recovery and carbon storage.

Oxy is considering investing another $550 million in its Hobbs operation in the next several years to further expand its carbon facilities.

"During all these oil industry downturns, those carbon wells keep people working," said Grassham.

SINGAPORE/HONG KONG, June 5 (Reuters) - The sale by Malaysian energy firm Petronas of an estimated $1 billion stake in a local upstream gas project has moved to the second round and is set to attract interest from about half a dozen bidders including Royal Dutch Shell and ExxonMobil Corp , four sources familiar with the matter said.

State-owned Petroliam Nasional Bhd (Petronas) had kicked off a process to sell a stake of up to 49 percent in the SK316 offshore gas block in Malaysia's Sarawak state, Reuters reported in February. [nL4N1G52FP]

Prospective buyers are expected to submit second round financial bids this month, and a final decision on the successful bidder is expected later this year, said two sources.

Sources said Total , PTT Exploration and Production PCL and some Japanese firms are also among those keen to bid for the asset.

The transaction, if completed, would mark Petronas' biggest upstream stake sale since oil prices started falling more than two years ago.

All the sources declined to be identified as discussions between Petronas and the companies are private, adding that terms of the deal could change depending on how the talks proceed.

Petronas, which last week maintained a cautious outlook for the rest of the year after reporting quarterly profit more than double a year ago, did not respond to a request for comment.

In a statement to Reuters in April, it had said that through its unit, Petronas Carigali, it was seeking partners who could bring the technology and capabilities to explore, develop and efficiently operate the various fields and opportunities in the SK316 offshore gas block.

Shell, ExxonMobil and Total declined to comment.

PTT Exploration said it was keen to invest in Thailand and Southeast Asia due to its expertise in these markets and as costs and risks were low.

"This area is consistent with the company's expansion strategy, however, the company will consider details of each project before making an investment decision," PTTEP said in response to a query on its interest in the Petronas asset.

Gas from the NC3 field in the SK316 block feeds Malaysia's LNG export project, known as LNG 9, a joint venture between Petronas and JX Nippon Oil & Energy Corp <5020.T> that began commercial production in January. [nL4N1FD2QM]

The sale of a stake in the offshore gas block has been clouded by political opposition to the process, but sources said this was unlikely to derail ongoing talks.

Opposition party leaders in Sarawak, a key vote base for Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak who is likely to call general elections this year, have expressed disapproval in Petronas' plan to find a partner.

One even called for the state to be given the option to acquire all or part of the stake that it proposes to sell.

Sarawak Chief Minister Abang Johari, however, has said the state did not want to take on the risk of developing the gas field as "the project cost billions of ringgit and it is of high risk," according to state news agency Bernama.

He said the state government was in talks with Petronas about the partner-finding process for SK316.

Big oil, small U.S. towns see new reward in old production technique - 路透新闻

{{20170605T050001.860+0000}}Big oil, small U.S. towns see new reward in old production technique* Carbon credit hike could insulate more U.S. oil from future busts

* Occidental, Exxon, Chevron among the potential winners

* Congress to consider boosting tax credit this summer

By Ernest Scheyder

HOBBS, New Mexico, June 5 (Reuters) - Amid the frenetic activity of American shale oilfields recovering from a two-year recession sit a handful of oil towns that seemed impervious as many producers went into bankruptcy and the economy around them sank.

Occidental Petroleum Corp and a few other oil producers with wells near this town on New Mexico's border with Texas steadily pumped low-cost oil through the downturn, using a technique that has been heralded worldwide as a way to reduce carbon emissions and boost oil output.

"When everyone else in the oil industry was going down, Oxy kept working," said Joshua Grassham, vice president of Lea County State Bank and a Hobbs Chamber of Commerce board member. The city of 35,000 rests on the Permian oilfield, the largest oilfield in the United States.

This way of drilling brings with it a sweetener for the oil industry to keep crude flowing: a tax credit that helps insulate these wells in a downturn, and could triple in size if Congress approves a new measure this summer.

Such a move could extend by decades the producing life of hundreds more wells, increasing oil supply which would be a drag on prices. To date, the technique has been employed only at conventional oilfields, rather than on shale deposits. Some firms are studying how to put the technique to work in shale drilling, too.

The drilling method harnesses the carbon dioxide produced during the extraction of oil or from power plants, and forces it back into the fields. That boosts the pressure underground and drives more oil to the surface.

Their success could be replicated in oilfields across the United States if Congress approves the measure, which already enjoys broad bipartisan support. While the Trump administration has yet to say whether it supports the tax credit increase, the measure could also be a boon to the coal industry, which Trump wants to revitalize.

The technique, one of several so-called enhanced oil recovery (EOR) strategies used to prolong the productive lifespan of oilfields and increase output, underpins around five percent of U.S. oil output, or about 450,000 barrels per day, according to energy consultancy Advanced Resources International.

EOR can help firms to produce between 30 percent and 60 percent of all the oil held in a reservoir. That's far more than the 10 percent usually recovered from initial traditional drilling, according to the Department of Energy.

The existing credit has provided a financial lift for Occidental, Denbury Resources Inc and oil producers with ready access to the gas. Exxon Mobil Corp and Chevron Corp also use the technique on some of their oil fields. None detail their tax savings from the credit, but since the it was first offered in 2008, companies have collected at least $350 million in the credits, according to Internal Revenue Service figures.

In Hobbs, Occidental not only kept a 200-person workforce intact during the oil-price downturn - when tens of thousands of workers were laid off in the shale patch - it also invested $250 million to expand operations during that period, according to its public filings.

That meant Hobbs and nearby Seminole, Texas, where Hess Corp has its own carbon dioxide injection facility, didn't suffer the extreme financial pain felt by shale towns, such as Williston, North Dakota, and other shale producing communities in 2015 and 2016.[nL2N17Z0ZS]

"Oxy's investment in the carbon project was a huge economic boost to our area," Grassham said.

Some of the carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, comes from naturally occurring reservoirs that are a low-cost source for Occidental. Others get the gas piped from power plants that burn coal. Power companies hope the technique can help them avoid higher carbon emissions.

The company spends about $18 to $25 per barrel to collect oil from its enhanced oil recovery operations. In contrast, its shale-focused well costs are lower - $16 to $19 per barrel. But because EOR wells pump consistently for decades, their value to the company over time exceeds shale wells, whose production quickly tapers off.

Across Texas and New Mexico, Occidental runs one of the world's largest fleet of enhanced oil recovery projects, injecting 2 billion cubic feet of carbon dioxide each day into wells that first produced oil nearly a century ago.

"We had a very large, stable carbon dioxide EOR business in our portfolio during the downturn," said Jody Elliott, president of Occidental's American operations. "That helped."

Partly because of its carbon facilities, Occidental was able to raise its dividend during the downturn. Today, executives are using the profits from the carbon business to grow its shale business across the Permian, the largest acreage holding in the region.

"These two businesses play very well off of each other," Elliott said.

TAX CHANGE?

Congress is expected this summer to debate extending an existing tax credit that could pave way for wider use. The proposed Carbon Capture Utilization and Storage Act would boost the credit to $35 per metric ton of carbon dioxide, up from $10 per ton today.

The legislation failed to move forward during last year's heated presidential campaign, but supporters say it will be reintroduced soon. "We want to make sure that we show a strong commitment so we continue to develop these technologies," said North Dakota Senator Heidi Heitkamp, a Democrat and the bill's lead sponsor.

Electricity generator NRG Energy Inc earlier this year opened a $1.04 billion carbon capture facility at a Texas coal-fired power plant, using its carbon dioxide emissions to extract crude from a 1930s-era oilfield.[nL1N1EZ1Q4]

Expanding the credit could, supporters hope, encourage more coal-fired power plants to follow NRG's lead by capturing and selling carbon to oil producers. Most oilfields are not located near carbon dioxide supplies, so the tax credit also could spur the build-out of carbon pipelines.

Environmentalists, including the Sierra Club, like the process because it traps carbon underground, preventing it from contributing to greenhouse gas emissions.

"You'll put more carbon in the ground than oil that is produced," said Vello Kuuskraa, president of consultancy Advanced Resources International, which studies enhanced oil recovery and carbon storage.

Oxy is considering investing another $550 million in its Hobbs operation in the next several years to further expand its carbon facilities.

"During all these oil industry downturns, those carbon wells keep people working," said Grassham.

U.S. Cash Products-Chicago gasoline strengthens on rumors of Exxon Joliet issues - 路透新闻

{{20170602T213749.908+0000}}U.S. Cash Products-Chicago gasoline strengthens on rumors of Exxon Joliet issuesBy Devika  Krishna Kumar

NEW YORK, June 2 (Reuters) - Chicago CBOB gasoline differentials strengthened on Friday amid
rumors of an issue at ExxonMobil Corp's  238,600-barrel-per-day (bpd) Joliet, Illinois,
refinery, traders said.

Prices strengthened by as much as 2 cents but ended the day about 1.50 cents per gallon
higher to trade 8.50 cents per gallon under the benchmark futures contract after Exxon said the
gasoline-producing unit at its Joliet refinery was not shut. Energy News Today reported earlier
in the day that production on the gasoline-producing fluidic catalytic cracking unit (FCCU)
would be halted during the weekend for repairs to the 26,200-bpd alkylation unit. [nL1N1IZ17H]

In other Midwest markets, Group Three gasoline slid by half a penny to trade 7.75 cents per
gallon under the futures contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange . Diesel weakened by
a penny to trade 3.50 cents per gallon below the futures contract as refiners were seen selling,
traders said.

Gulf Coast conventional gasoline was largely unchanged in thin trade while A2 CBOB gasoline
strengthened by a cent to trade about 11.75 cents per gallon under the benchmark futures
contract.

Koch was seen buying 62-grade diesel, traders said.

In the New York Harbor, both M2 conventional gasoline and F2 RBOB gasoline weakened, brokers
said.

Renewable Fuel (D6) Renewable Identification Number (RIN) credits for 2017 traded at prices
from 74 and 75 cents each, up slightly from 74 and 75 cents on Thursday, traders said.
Biomass-based diesel (D4) RINs for the current year traded at prices at $1.025, little-changed
from Thursday's quotes.

POINT MARCHÉS-Wall Street ignore le rapport sur l'emploi et bat ses records - 路透新闻

{{20170602T211042.931+0000}}POINT MARCHÉS-Wall Street ignore le rapport sur l'emploi et bat ses records(Actualisé avec autres classes d'actifs)

* Le Dow a gagné 0,29%, le S&P-500 0,37% et le Nasdaq 0,94%

* Les créations d'emploi ralentissent aux USA

* Une hausse de taux en juin reste anticipée

* Les valeurs technologiques toujours en vedette

par Chuck Mikolajczak

NEW YORK, 2 juin (Reuters) - La Bourse de New York a enchaîné vendredi une deuxième séance consécutive de records, la faiblesse des créations d'emploi aux Etats-Unis ayant été éclipsée par la progression des valeurs technologiques.

L'indice Dow Jones <.DJI> a pris 62,11 points, soit 0,29%, à 21.206,29. Le Standard & Poor's 500 <.SPX>, plus large et principale référence des investisseurs, a gagné 9,01 points, soit 0,37%, à 2.439,07. Le Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> a pour sa part fini en hausse de 58,97 points (+0,94%) à 6.305,80.

Ces trois grands indices ont battu leurs records en séance et en clôture et, sur la semaine, le Dow a pris 0,6%, le S&P-500 0,96% et le Nasdaq 1,54%.

Le nombre de créations d'emplois (138.000) a diminué de manière inattendue le mois dernier aux Etats-Unis et les chiffres des deux mois précédents ont été révisés en baisse. [nZON1E150A]

Ce ralentissement survient cependant sur un marché américain du travail quasiment au plein emploi, avec un taux de chômage tombé à un creux de 16 ans à 4,3%.

L'économie américaine n'a besoin de créer que 75.000 à 100.000 emplois par mois pour répondre à l'accroissement de la population active.

Ce rapport mensuel sur l'emploi ne change rien aux anticipations des investisseurs, qui voient la Réserve fédérale augmenter à nouveau ses taux, pour la deuxième fois de l'année, lors de sa prochaine réunion des 13 et 14 juin. La Fed a déjà procédé en mars à un premier tour de vis monétaire en 2017 et elle en anticipe trois au total sur l'ensemble de l'année.

Les traders estiment à 90,7% la probabilité d'une hausse de taux d'un quart de point ce mois-ci aux Etats-Unis, selon les données Thomson Reuters.

"Je ne dirais pas que ces données soutiennent l'idée d'une hausse de taux mais (la Fed) est sur une trajectoire et elle ne va pas en changer, au moins en juin", dit Jim Tierney, responsable des investissements du fonds Concentrated US Growth chez AllianceBernstein à New York.

"Les actions sont à des records et, dans une certaine mesure, les actions ignorent certains indicateurs de court terme", ajoute-t-il.

L'ÉNERGIE PÉNALISÉE PAR LE RECUL DU PÉTROLE

Parmi les secteurs les plus performants de la séance ont figuré les technologies <.SPLRCT> (+1,04%) et, dans une moindre mesure, l'industrie <.SPLRCI> (+0,49%).

Les premières ont été portées notamment par la nette progression du titre Broadcom (+8,5%), plus forte hausse du S&P-500 et qui affiche désormais un gain de 44% depuis le début de l'année. Plusieurs intermédiaires ont relevé leur objectif de cours sur le titre après la publication par le fabricant de semi-conducteurs de ses résultats trimestriels.

Les poids lourds de la cote Apple (+1,42%) et Microsoft (+2,37%) ont aussi contribué au dynamisme du secteur, le plus en vue en ce moment à Wall Street avec une envolée de plus de 20% depuis le début de l'année.

Les valeurs industrielles ont pour leur part été portées par le secteur aéronautique, notamment Boeing , dont le titre, principal contributeur à la progression du Dow, a fini en hausse de 1,55% après un record en séance à 191,69 dollars.

La compagnie Delta Air Lines , avec un gain de 2,69%, a affiché la plus forte progression de l'indice sectoriel de l'industrie après avoir annoncé une hausse de 3,5% sur un an de son revenu unitaire par passager en mai. Elle a entraîné ses concurrentes dans son sillage comme United Continental (+1,3%).

Du côté des baisses, le secteur de l'énergie <.SPNY> (-1,18%) a souffert du recul continu des cours du pétrole, qui ont perdu plus de 4% sur la semaine avec un Brent repassé sous les 50 dollars le baril. [nL8N1IZ5IG]

Exxon Mobil a cédé 1,49% et Chevron 1,11%.

Les valeurs financières <.SPSY>, qui profitent de taux d'intérêt plus élevés, ont effacé une partie des pertes affichées après la publication du rapport mensuel sur l'emploi mais ont tout de même accusé un repli de 0,37%, avec par exemple des baisses de 0,8% pour Goldman Sachs et Bank of America .

Le dollar est tombé à un plus bas de sept mois face à un panier de devises de référence <.DXY>, comme face à l'euro à 1,1280 dollar, après les chiffres des créations d'emploi, qui ne remettent pas en cause une hausse de taux en juin mais font naître des doutes sur la capacité de la Fed à poursuivre son resserrement monétaire au second semestre.

Les rendements des emprunts du Trésor américain ont eux aussi fléchi, le 10 ans reculant à 2,1539%.

L'or a en revanche connu une quatrième semaine consécutive de progression, avec une hausse d'environ 1% pour la seule journée de vendredi.

HOUSTON, June 2 (Reuters) - ExxonMobil Corp said on Friday the gasoline-producing unit at its Joliet, Illinois, refinery was not shut, causing CBOB gasoline in the Chicago market to retreat close to the previous day's close, traders said.

CBOB gasoline climbed as much as 2 cents a gallon early on Friday as traders swapped rumors about a shutdown of 98,000 barrel-per-day (bpd) gasoline-producing fluidic catalytic cracking unit at Exxon's 238,600-bpd Joliet refinery.

After Exxon's statement, CBOB was seen at an offer of 9 cents a gallon under the gasoline contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

Energy News Today reported that production on the FCCU would be halted over the weekend for repairs to the 26,200-bpd alkylation unit.

CBOB gasoline traded early in Chicago on Friday at an 8-cent-a-gallon discount to the NYMEX gasoline contract on talk the FCCU was shut, traders said.

CBOB finished on Thursday at a 10.25-cent discount to the NYMEX.

Washington softens stance on US investors mingling with Putin and allies  - 路透新闻

{{20170602T183317.109+0000}}Washington softens stance on US investors mingling with Putin and allies * In past years, U.S. advised firms to stay away from forum

* No such guidance was issued this year

* Trump says he wants friendlier ties with Kremlin

By Sujata Rao and Yeganeh Torbati

ST PETERSBURG, Russia/WASHINGTON, June 2 (Reuters) - For three years after Russia annexed Crimea, Washington officials quietly cautioned major U.S. firms about attending the annual St Petersburg forum, where investors mingle with President Vladimir Putin and his lieutenants.

This year, the first forum since Donald Trump became U.S. president, such cautions were not issued, according to four people familiar with preparations for U.S. companies to attend.

Washington's policy toward Russia is essentially unchanged under Trump, with the United States committed to maintaining sanctions on Moscow unless it complies with international demands about Ukraine.

But its approach this year to the St Petersburg event - often described as Russia's version of the Davos forum in Switzerland - reveals a change in tone, according to some people who follow U.S.-Russia trade relations.

Daniel Russell, the head of the U.S.-Russia business council, when asked if U.S. companies were feeling less pressure from the administration to stay away, said: "I think that's right.

"Some of the companies, particularly in 2015, received calls from the U.S. government not to attend and I think that attitude has certainly changed."

The change in tone fits with promises Trump made during his election campaign to pursue friendlier ties with Russia.

Any sign of warming toward the Kremlin is highly sensitive for the White House, since Congress and the FBI are conducting inquiries into whether members of the Trump team had improper contacts with Russian officials before Trump's inauguration. Trump has denied doing anything wrong.

Asked about contacts with companies planning to attend the forum, a State Department spokesperson said: "We have an open dialogue with the business community, and ultimately companies are free to make their own decisions, in line with applicable laws and regulations."

The forum in St Petersburg was in its second day on Friday and there were signs of a more substantial U.S. presence than in previous years since the March 2014 annexation of Crimea.

U.S. AMBASSADOR

U.S. ambassador to Russia John Tefft was at the forum, though he did not have a speaking slot. No U.S. ambassador attended in 2014, 2015 or 2016.

A spokeswoman for the U.S. embassy in Moscow said his attendance was a routine part of his ambassadorial duties.

Major U.S. companies who sent senior executives - including oil major Exxon, Boeing, Chevron and JPMorgan - were represented at a similar level to last year, but several delegates at the forum said they estimated the U.S. presence to be numerically bigger than in previous years.

"We see a much larger number of people from the U.S., Canada," said Kirill Dmitriev, chief executive of the Russian Direct Investment Fund, a state body that works with foreign investors.

"There is a better understanding (among foreign investors) that sanctions really did not work, the Russian economy continues to grow, Russia represents an attractive market and people should work with Russia," he told Reuters.

Several U.S. delegates said that, politics aside, they were drawn to the forum by the fact the Russian economy had returned to growth after a slowdown.

The forum is a prestige project for Putin, a native of St Petersburg. Foreign executives typically use their presence to signal to the Kremlin their enthusiasm for investing in Russia.

In 2014, when the Ukraine crisis first started, U.S. cabinet officials including Secretary of State John Kerry made personal calls to chief executives of U.S. firms asking them not to attend, said a former U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity.

The next year, senior U.S. officials below cabinet level were charged with persuading American executives not to attend, and in 2016, U.S. officials brought up the issue in a low-level manner, the former official said.

The account of those conversations was confirmed by a second former official who served in the administration of former U.S. President Barack Obama.

The guidance in later years was not necessarily to stay away, but that executives who did attend should keep their presence low-key, said several other people familiar with the discussions.

Ian Colebourne, who is CEO for Deloitte in the Commonwealth of Independent States and sits on the U.S.-Russia business council, said he was aware of officials giving guidance to executives in previous years, but added: "I haven't heard anything this year."

Two other sources familiar with the preparations for U.S. companies to attend also said there had been no guidance before this year's forum, in contrast to previous years.

GREEN LIGHT?

The lack of contact from the U.S. government this year is being interpreted among business executives as meaning: "You can go," said one of the two sources.

The U.S. Chamber of Commerce did not receive any guidance from the administration about whether or not to participate in the event, a source with the Chamber said.

Still, some companies that did attend exercised caution, keeping a low profile.

The head of U.S. oil giant Exxon Mobil, Darren Woods, did not join the table of panelists at the main oil session of the forum. It was chaired by the head of Kremlin oil major Rosneft, Igor Sechin, who is on the U.S. sanctions list.

Like his predecessor as Exxon CEO Rex Tillerson, now Trump's Secretary of State, Woods made only brief remarks from the floor in a discussion about the energy industry.

Woods declined to answer questions from Reuters. An Exxon representative said company policy was not to comment on the travel arrangements of its executives.

Among other U.S. companies at the forum, JPMorgan Chase & Co., sent Daniel Pinto, Chief Executive Officer of its corporate and investment business, while Boeing sent Bertrand-Marc Allen, president of its international arm.

U.S. oil major Chevron sent its vice president for business development, Jay Pryor. He was also at the forum last year. A company representative did not reply to questions about any guidance from the administration.

"Let's say the seniority of some of the teams is more senior this year, certainly compared to some prior years and that's a positive sign," Deloitte's Colebourne said of the U.S corporate presence.

Robert Dudley, chief executive of BP, a British company with substantial business in the United States, said his impression was that this year there were more representatives of U.S. companies at the forum than previously.

"That would suggest they are not feeling that kind of pressure," to curb their presence, he said.

UPDATE 3-NY prosecutor says Exxon misled investors on climate change - 路透新闻

{{20170602T180919.893+0000}}UPDATE 3-NY prosecutor says Exxon misled investors on climate change(Adds background on investigation in lead and paragraphs 8, 10 and 11)

By Emily Flitter

NEW YORK, June 2 (Reuters) - New York's top prosecutor on Friday accused Exxon Mobil of misleading investors about how it accounts for climate change risks, court filings show, offering a rare look inside an ongoing fraud investigation as it pressed the company to turn over more documents.

Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said in a court filing he had evidence of "potential materially false and misleading statements by Exxon" that could have led investors to think the U.S. oil giant company properly assessed the risks when it actually ignored a formula to estimate the impact of future environmental regulation on new deals.

Schneiderman's filing came a day after President Donald Trump announced plans to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate accord, in which nearly 200 countries pledged to lower their greenhouse gas emissions to try to slow global warming. World leaders and many U.S. executives condemned the decision. [nL1N1IY0MV]

"ExxonMobil's external statements have accurately described its use of a proxy cost of carbon, and the documents produced to the Attorney General make this fact unmistakably clear," said Exxon spokesman Scott Silvestri. "We will respond fully to the Attorney General's inaccurate and irresponsible allegations about proxy cost in our court filings."

'MAY BE A SHAM'

Schneiderman's filing focused on the method Exxon used to give its investors estimates of the regulatory cost of greenhouse gas emissions on new projects. The company frequently showed investors a number it called a "proxy cost" for greenhouse gasses as a way to assure them it was accounting for potential changes to government policy that would make producing and burning fossil fuels more expensive.

"The exercise described to investors may be a sham," Schneiderman wrote, because Exxon may not have actually applied it when estimating profits and losses on its investments.

"Exxon's own documents suggest that if Exxon had applied the proxy cost it promised to shareholders, at least one substantial oil sands project may have projected a financial loss, rather than a profit, over the course of the project's original timeline," Schneiderman wrote.

The New York prosecutor is not the only authority examining Exxon's climate-related statements to investors. Exxon said on Sept. 20 the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating how it valued its oil and gas reserves in the wake of low prices and potential curbs on carbon emissions. [nL3N1BW412]

UNUSUAL TRANSPARENCY

Exxon has been fighting Schneiderman's requests for information about its climate change policies in both state and federal court, claiming it should not have to turn over records because the New York prosecutor's probe is politically motivated and abusive to the company.

Its resistance has created a highly unusual condition: State and federal prosecutors normally only reveal their findings once they've completed the process and are ready to file charges.

But Exxon's attempts to fight Schneiderman's subpoenas - it even sued Schneiderman and Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey, who is also probing the company, in federal court - have led Schneiderman to use evidence he's uncovered so far to argue his case for why Exxon should be forced to hand over more documents.

Exxon has already turned over 2 million documents as part of the investigation, leading to the discovery that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who until December was chief executive of Exxon, used a separate email address and an alias, "Wayne Tracker," to discuss climate change-related issues while at the company. [nL2N1GQ1T7]

Schneiderman is seeking records he says Exxon has been withholding, as well the ability to interview Exxon employees who might know about Exxon's internal climate change discussions.

On May 23, a New York State appeals court ruled Exxon should turn over records Schneiderman was requesting. [nL1N1IP1TQ]

Exxon shares were down 1.5 percent Friday at $79.49. Crude prices fell on worries Trump's decision to withdraw from the global climate accord could ultimately result in an overabundance of oil production. [nL3N1IZ1BK]

CORRECTED-Investors expect to meet with Exxon on climate-impact report - 路透新闻

{{20170602T163649.158+0000}}CORRECTED-Investors expect to meet with Exxon on climate-impact report(Adds name of Tracey Rembert's employer in paragraph 3)

By Gary McWilliams

HOUSTON, June 1 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp investors will push to meet with oil company officials this summer to hash out elements of a climate-impact analysis following a shareholder vote calling for studies of technology and climate-related risks to its business.

Exxon has said that it will reconsider its opposition to the request, not that it would begin discussions or initiate new studies. The shareholder proposal, filed by 54 groups including financial, religious and corporate governance activists, won the support on Wednesday of 62 percent of Exxon holders. [nL1N1IX15V]

"I anticipate we'll be having a meeting this summer," said Tracey Rembert, assistant director of Catholic Responsible Investing at Christian Brothers Investment Services, one of the 54 co-filers.

The White House's decision on Thursday to withdraw from the Paris agreement on climate change has no bearing on the proposal. "We expect the scenario assessment will start to be done quickly at Exxon," Rembert said. [nL1N1IY0MV]

The investors behind the proposal routinely met in past years with Exxon between December and February to discuss annual meeting proposals, she said. Earlier discussions because of the majority vote are in order.

Rembert said the group will ask for Exxon to conduct scenario planning exercises that would look at risks from disruptive technology, climate or government policies. "What are the black swan events that can take place beyond low oil prices, aggressive policies or shifting consumer preferences?" she said.

The reconsideration at Exxon comes as Devon Energy and Hess Corp owners on Wednesday will weigh climate-impact resolutions.

Ballot initiatives press for greater studies of the risk that government carbon-reduction efforts in the future make oil and gas reserves uneconomic to tap, leading to investment losses. Study proposals this year received at least 40 percent approval at Duke Energy , Marathon Oil and Southern Co , according to a tally by Ceres, a non-profit group that tracks environmental records of public companies.

"When investors make a very strong statement at a company the size of Exxon Mobil, other competitors in their industry take notice and may reconsider or rethink their investor dialogue on these issues," said Bruce Goldfarb, chief executive of proxy solicitor Okapi Partners. [nL1N1IX2E2]

The Exxon shareholder vote will have minor influence because most of the ballots likely were already cast, said Danielle Fugere, president of As You Sow, a shareholder advocacy group seeking a carbon-risk study at Hess. Last year, its proposal was backed by about 23 percent of Hess holders.

Hess's vice president of investor relations, Jay Wilson, said the company talks regularly with large shareholders but declined to comment on any discussions since the Exxon vote. Devon didn't respond to requests for comment. Directors at both oil companies oppose the studies. [nL1N1IE20Q]

Tillerson says U.S. will continue efforts to reduce emissions - 路透新闻

{{20170602T154306.911+0000}}Tillerson says U.S. will continue efforts to reduce emissionsWASHINGTON, June 2 (Reuters) - The United States will continue its efforts to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions despite President Donald Trump's decision to leave the Paris climate accord, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said on Friday.

"It was a policy decision and I think it's important that everyone recognize the United States has a terrific record on reducing our own greenhouse gas emissions," Tillerson told reporters at the State Department.

"That was done in the absence of a Paris agreement. I don't think we're going to change our ongoing efforts to reduce those emissions in the future either, so hopefully people can keep it in perspective."

Tillerson, the former CEO of Exxon Mobil Corp , had advocated keeping the United States in the deal so it could keep a position at the international bargaining table over how to address climate change.

NY prosecutor says Exxon's climate change math 'may be a sham' - 路透新闻

{{20170602T135103.307+0000}}NY prosecutor says Exxon's climate change math 'may be a sham'By Emily Flitter

NEW YORK, June 2 (Reuters) - New York's top prosecutor on Friday increased pressure on Exxon Mobil to turn over records of internal assessments of the risks global warming poses to its businesses, claiming to already have evidence of "potential materially false and misleading statements by Exxon," court filings show.

Attorney General Eric Schneiderman has been investigating whether the U.S. oil giant misled investors by publicly stating that it thought the risks of climate change were low while privately admitting they were far higher.

In a filing on Friday, Schneiderman focused on the method Exxon used to give its investors estimates of the regulatory cost of greenhouse gas emissions on new projects. The company frequently showed investors a number it called a "proxy cost" for greenhouse gasses as a way to assure them it was accounting for potential changes to government policy that would make producing and burning fossil fuels more expensive.

"The exercise described to investors may be a sham," Schneiderman wrote in the court filing.

A spokesman for Exxon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Exxon has been fighting Schneiderman's requests for information about its climate change policies in both state and federal court, claiming it should not have to turn over records because the New York prosecutor's probe is politically motivated and abusive to the company.

Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey is also investigating the company. Both probes are modeled after earlier investigations of tobacco companies, which were shown to admit in great detail internally that smoking was bad for human health while publicly maintaining it was not.

Friday's filing revealed that Exxon may have actually low-balled the cost of carbon-emissions regulations in its internal calculations compared with what it told investors.

"Exxon's own documents suggest that if Exxon had applied the proxy cost it promised to shareholders, at least one substantial oil sands project may have projected a financial loss, rather than a profit, over the course of the project's original timeline," Schneiderman wrote.

On May 23, a New York State appeals court ruled Exxon should turn over records Schneiderman was requesting, which it had been arguing it should not be compelled to release. [nL1N1IP286]

Friday's filing included a request for even more internal documents, as well the ability to interview Exxon employees who might know about Exxon's internal climate change discussions.

* Graphic on Paris climate agreement: http://tmsnrt.rs/2fTjA1w

By Clyde Russell

LAUNCESTON, Australia, June 2 (Reuters) - It's not hard to imagine Chinese President Xi Jinping having a wry smile at both the decision by Donald Trump to pull the United States out of the Paris climate accord and the global reaction.

While President Trump's decision had been expected, it does confirm that world leadership on efforts to limit global climate change will now shift to Asia, and China in particular. [nL1N1IY0MV]

Xi is now free to accept the mantle of global leadership on climate action, which will give him an opportunity to advance China's interests across the world at a time when Trump's actions are likely to cost the United States influence and allies.

The best part for Xi is that this hasn't cost him anything, Trump has done the damage to the United States all by himself, and is most likely unaware or uncaring of the likely consequences, which go well beyond the blow to the image of the United States as a global leader.

It's been a good past few weeks for Xi, given the successful hosting of a regional summit in Beijing to promote the "belt and road" initiative that ended on May 15 with pledges by China to spend as much as $800 billion on projects aimed at boosting trade and development across Asia, Africa and into Europe.

China, the world's largest polluter, was also quick to state that it remained committed to the 2015 Paris agreement, which aims to limit the rise in global temperatures to less than 2 degrees centigrade by the end of the century.

"China will stand by its responsibilities on climate change," Premier Li Keqiang told reporters on Thursday after meeting German Chancellor Angela Merkel and before flying on to Brussels for meetings with European Union officials that will include how to keep the Paris agreement going without U.S. participation. [nL8N1IY1J8]

While China has moved quickly to step into the leadership role vacated by Trump, it's likely that Xi will be looking for more than just increased prestige and prominence in international affairs.

China will most likely be seeking to attract more investment into renewable energy technology and manufacturing, building up a sector of its economy that is already experiencing rapid growth.

The opportunities for China are immense, as it can step into the U.S. role of providing technology and equipment transfer to developing nations to help them meet their commitments under the Paris agreement.

CHINA RAMPS UP RENEWABLES

China has committed to plough 2.5 trillion yuan ($361 billion) into renewable power generation by 2020, as the world's largest energy market continues to shift away from dirty coal power towards cleaner fuels.

The investment will create over 13 million jobs in the sector, the National Energy Administration said on Jan. 5 in a document that lays out its plan to develop the nation's energy sector during the five-year 2016 to 2020 period.

No doubt China will also seek to export renewable energy sources such as solar panels and wind turbines, and this process may well be helped by the country's strong stance in favour of the global climate accord.

It's also likely that China will join European countries in rejecting Trump's efforts to negotiate a better deal.

The countries that remain committed to the 195-nation Paris agreement have little incentive to give a better deal to the United States, the world's second-biggest polluter.

Rather it's more likely that they may seek to impose carbon-related tariffs on U.S. goods if these are deemed to be enjoying an unfair advantage because they are produced in an economy free of carbon restraints.

It's difficult to see how Trump's decision to exit the Paris deal is anything other than an own goal.

It's highly improbable that this will lead to more manufacturing jobs in the United States, instead it may actually encourage renewable energy pioneers to look at establishing facilities in countries with more progressive views.

It's also unlikely to revive the U.S. coal industry, which will remain under pressure from cheaper natural gas and the increasing cost-competitiveness of renewables.

It's a massive blow to U.S. prestige, and one that will likely filter down to U.S. companies that do business globally, making it harder for them to win business.

It also shows that Trump has little regard for his country's international reputation and that he remains under the spell of climate change deniers and nationalists with limited grasp of science or the economic implications.

Trump's actions also fly in the face of the wishes of many U.S. companies, including those that are supposed to be beneficiaries of the withdrawal, such as Exxon Mobil .

The maelstrom of criticism Trump is getting for abandoning the global climate pact is unlikely to dissuade him, or convince the section of his support base that fervently believe it is the correct course of action.

Much like the British vote to leave the European Union, the true costs of Trump's decision will only become apparent once it is too late.

LEAD 1-Climat-La décision de Trump déçoit de nombreuses entreprises US - 路透新闻

{{20170602T112538.618+0000}}LEAD 1-Climat-La décision de Trump déçoit de nombreuses entreprises US(Actualisé avec autres réactions)

par Emily Flitter et Valerie Volcovici

NEW YORK/WASHINGTON, 2 juin (Reuters) - Donald Trump a présenté jeudi sa décision de retirer les Etats-Unis de l'Accord de Paris sur le climat comme une mesure primordiale pour préserver l'emploi aux Etats-Unis, un argument accueilli avec scepticisme par de nombreuses entreprises américaines.

De Facebook à Apple, de Ford à Microsoft, beaucoup de grands groupes ont dénoncé la décision du président américain, tandis que les groupes gaziers et pétroliers, qui ont le plus à gagner de l'abandon du traité, se sont distingués par leur silence.

Le PDG du fabricant de voitures électriques Tesla, Elon Musk, et celui de Walt Disney, Robert Iger, ont manifesté leur désaccord en démissionnant du conseil présidentiel au sein duquel ils siégeaient jusqu'à présent.

Jeff Immelt, le directeur général de General Electric, a dit sa "déception" sur Twitter: "Le changement climatique est une réalité. L'industrie doit prendre le pas et ne pas dépendre du gouvernement."

Lloyd Blankfein, directeur général de la banque d'affaires Goldman Sachs, a dénoncé pour sa part "un recul pour l'environnement et pour la position de leadership des Etats-Unis dans le monde".

Tim Cook, le PDG d'Apple, a regretté une décision "mauvaise pour notre planète". "Apple est engagé dans la lutte contre le changement climatique et ne faiblira pas", a-t-il dit sur Twitter.

Mark Zuckerberg a écrit sur Facebook, qu'il dirige, une décision "mauvaise pour l'environnement, mauvaise pour l'économie, qui met en danger l'avenir de nos enfants".

Le président de l'Association mondiale du charbon (WCA), Benjamin Sporton, a confié à Reuters des sentiments mitigés quant à l'annonce de Trump et s'est dit impatient de voir une politique américaine octroyant une place au charbon dans le mix énergétique mondial.

"Ce dont nous avons vraiment besoin, si le président veut à nouveau rentrer dans l'accord, c'est qu'il le change pour reconnaître le rôle de toutes les sources d'énergie, y compris le charbon", a déclaré Sporton, ajoutant que son lobby avait fait valoir au président les avantages d'un maintien dans l'Accord de Paris.

Seul Peabody, premier producteur américain de charbon coté en Bourse, a déclaré mercredi soutenir une sortie de l'accord, jugé "défectueux sur un certain nombre de points".

DES COMPAGNIES PÉTROLIÈRES PRO-PARIS

L'American Petroleum Institute (API), qui regroupe les grandes compagnies pétrolières et gazières du pays, a dit dans un communiqué n'avoir jamais pris position officiellement sur l'accord.

Un certain nombre de compagnies de l'API, dont Exxon Mobil et ConocoPhillips , avaient affiché leur soutien à l'accord.

"Pour nous, (...) il faut un cadre tel que celui-ci pour faire face aux risques du changement climatique", a dit mercredi le directeur général d'Exxon Mobil, Darren Woods, en marge de l'assemblée générale du groupe.

D'autres groupes ont exprimé un soutien prudent au projet de Trump et estimé qu'il permettrait de régler certains problèmes du texte, même si l'Union européenne, ainsi que l'Allemagne, la France et l'Italie dans une déclaration commune, ont déjà exclu toute renégociation du traité signé en décembre 2015.

"Les industriels soutiennent l'esprit de l'Accord de Paris et les efforts pour répondre au changement climatique par le biais d'un accord international juste. Mais comme l'a reconnu le président, certains éléments de l'accord n'étaient pas équitables pour les industriels américains", a déclaré Ross Eisenberg, de la Fédération nationale de l'Industrioe (National Association of Manufacturers).

Pendant la campagne présidentielle, Donald Trump, qui doute de la responsabilité humaine dans le changement climatique, a promis de retirer les Etats-Unis d'un accord qui aurait selon lui détruit des emplois, freiné la croissance et coûté plus de mille milliards de dollars sans fournir de bénéfice tangible.

RPT-Trump withdrawal from climate deal disappoints many U.S. companies - 路透新闻

{{20170602T110501.633+0000}}RPT-Trump withdrawal from climate deal disappoints many U.S. companies(Repeats story that ran late June 1 with no changes to text)

By Emily Flitter and Valerie Volcovici

NEW YORK/WASHINGTON, June 1 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday withdrawing the country from the Paris climate accord would stave off an economic crisis and protect American jobs - but many American companies seemed to disagree.

Criticism of his decision rolled in from blue-chip companies like Facebook Inc , Apple Inc , Ford Motor Co and Microsoft Corp , while the response from fossil fuel groups with the most to gain from a relaxation of U.S. carbon emissions standards was muted.

Tesla Inc Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk and Walt Disney Co CEO Robert Iger said they would leave White House advisory councils over Trump's decision. [nL3N1IY5QF]

In an interview on Thursday, the president of the World Coal Association, Benjamin Sporton, told Reuters that he had mixed feelings about Trump's announcement, adding he was eager to see a U.S. policy that actively promotes a place for coal in the global energy mix.

"What we really need to see, if the president wants to re-enter the deal, is that he can change the agreement to recognize the role of all sources of energy, including coal," Sporton said, adding his group had described to administration officials the benefits of remaining in the agreement.

The American Petroleum Institute, the oil and gas industry's biggest trade group, meanwhile, issued a statement saying it had never taken an official position on the Paris accord.

A number of its members, including Exxon Mobil Corp and ConocoPhillips , had publicly supported the deal.

"For us, our position on the Paris agreement... we need a framework like that to address the risks of climate change," Exxon Mobil CEO Darren Woods told reporters on the sidelines of the company's annual general meeting on Wednesday. [nL1N1IX15V]

Some other groups expressed measured support for Trump's decision, saying it provided an opportunity to fix problems with the deal.

"Manufacturers support the spirit of the Paris Agreement and the effort to address climate change through a fair international agreement. But as the president has acknowledged, certain elements of this deal were not equitable for U.S. manufacturers," said Ross Eisenberg, vice president for energy and resources policy at the National Association of Manufacturers, in a statement to Reuters.

A spokesman for Peabody Energy Corp , America's largest publicly traded coal miner, had said on Wednesday that the company would support a decision by Trump to withdraw from the Paris deal because the "accord is flawed on a number of levels."

Trump vowed during his campaign to pull the United States out of the Paris deal, arguing the pact would cost the United States trillions of dollars, kill jobs, and stymie economic growth without providing tangible benefit.

His critics have argued, however, that the risks of climate change require action, and that a shift to a low-carbon energy economy can create more jobs than it eliminates.

"A SETBACK"

Spokespeople for other extractive oil and mining groups, like the National Mining Association and the American Fuel & Petrochemicals Manufacturers, declined to comment on Trump's decision to withdraw from the Paris accord.

But a number of other business leaders derided it in forceful terms.

"Today's decision is a setback for the environment and for the U.S.'s leadership position in the world," said Goldman Sachs Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein in his first-ever tweet. [nL1N1IY2CK]

"Disappointed with today's decision on the Paris Agreement. Climate change is real. Industry must now lead and not depend on government," tweeted General Electric Co's Jeff Immelt.

Apple's CEO Tim Cook, meanwhile, posted to Twitter: "Decision to withdraw from the #ParisAgreeement was wrong for our planet" and "Apple is committed to fight climate change and we will never waver".

"Withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement is bad for the environment, bad for the economy, and it puts our children's future at risk," wrote Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg in a Facebook post.

FOKUS 1-US-Konzerne kritisieren Trumps Rückzug aus Weltklimavertrag - 路透新闻

{{20170602T082008.935+0000}}FOKUS 1-US-Konzerne kritisieren Trumps Rückzug aus Weltklimavertrag(neu: Apple, Facebook, Goldman, GE, Kohleverband, Hintergrund)

* Apple und Facebook: "Schlecht für Umwelt und Wirtschaft"

* Goldman-Boss: Rückschlag für US-Führungsposition in der Welt

* Tesla- und Disney-Chefs legen Trump-Beratermandate nieder

- von Emily Flitter und Valerie Volcovici

New York/Washington, 02. Jun (Reuters) - Führende US-Unternehmen haben die Ankündigung von Präsident Donald Trump für einen Ausstieg aus dem Weltklimavertrag scharf kritisiert. "Die Entscheidung, sich aus dem Pariser Abkommen zurückzuziehen, war falsch für unseren Planeten", twitterte Apple-Chef Tim Cook. Der iPhone-Hersteller werde am Kampf gegen den Klimawandel festhalten und nicht zaudern. Facebook-Chef Mark Zuckerberg schrieb in seinem Online-Netzwerk, der Beschluss sei "schlecht für die Umwelt, schlecht für die Wirtschaft und gefährdet die Zukunft unserer Kinder". Der Chef des Elektro-Autobauers Tesla, Elon Musk, und Disney-Boss Robert Iger kündigten aus Protest ihre Beraterfunktionen beim Präsidenten.

Auch aus der Finanzbranche und der Industrie hagelte es unmittelbar nach Trumps Erklärung Kritik. "Die Entscheidung ist ein Rückschlag für die Umwelt und für die US-Führungsposition in der Welt", erklärte der Chef der führenden US-Investmentbank Goldman Sachs, Lloyd Blankfein, in seinem ersten Kommentar auf Twitter überhaupt. Die Bankenbranche gilt eigentlich als einer der großen Profiteure von Trumps Wahlsieg. Denn der Präsident hat angekündigt, die unter seinem Vorgänger Barack Obama als Lehre aus der globalen Finanzkrise verschärfte Regulierung wieder zu lockern.

Der Chef des Siemens-Rivalen General Electric, Jeff Immelt, twitterte, er sei enttäuscht. Die Industrie müsse nun unabhängig von der Regierung eine Führungsrolle übernehmen. "Der Klimawandel ist real." Auch andere Großkonzerne wie Ford und Microsoft kritisierten Trump.

Zurückhaltender fiel das Echo in der Kohle- und Öl-Branche aus. Der Präsident des Weltkohleverbands WCA, Benjamin Sporton, sagte zu Reuters, er habe gemischte Gefühle. Er wünsche sich, dass sich die USA für eine neue Vereinbarung und eine Energiepolitik einsetzten, in der auch die Kohle ihren Platz habe. Der größte US-Verband der Öl- und Gasbranche, das American Petroleum Institute, teilte knapp mit, nie eine offizielle Position zu dem Abkommen eingenommen zu haben. Allerdings hatten zuvor schon führende Mitglieder wie der Ölmulti Exxon Mobil erklärt, zum Kampf gegen den Klimawandel sei ein Rahmen wie der Pariser Vertrag nötig.

Der Industrieverband NAM betonte, er unterstütze zwar den Geist des Pariser Weltklimavertrags, einige Teile des Abkommens seien aber ungerecht für die USA. Trump hatte erklärt, sein Land wolle aus dem Klimavertrag aussteigen, weil dieser für die USA unfair sei. Zudem zweifelt er den Klimawandel an. Im Wahlkampf hatte er ihn als eine Erfindung der Chinesen bezeichnet, um der US-Wirtschaft zu schaden.[nL8N1IZ08K]

Washington/Berlin, 02. Jun (Reuters) - US-Präsident Donald Trump hat den Weltklimavertrag als Instrument zur Schwächung seines Landes gebrandmarkt und den Austritt angekündigt. "Unter dem Strich ist das Abkommen in extremem Maße unfair gegenüber den USA", sagte er am Donnerstag in Washington. Daher würden die USA es verlassen und auch alle Zahlungen für den Kampf gegen den Klimawandel an andere Länder einstellen. Er werde sich aber für einen neuen und gerechten Vertrag einsetzen. "Wenn uns das gelingt: Gut. Wenn nicht, ist das auch in Ordnung." Deutschland, Frankreich und Italien lehnten eine Neuverhandlung ab. Die Länder bekräftigen in einer gemeinsamen Erklärung, dass die Dynamik des im Dezember 2015 ausgehandelten Vertrags nicht aufzuhalten sei.

Weltweit stieß Trumps Entscheidung auf Kritik. Die UN nannten sie eine große Enttäuschung. Großbritanniens Premierministerin Theresa May drückte ihr Bedauern aus. Das US-Präsidialamt teilte mit, Trump habe mit Bundeskanzlerin Angela Merkel, Frankreichs Präsident Emmanuel Macron, May und Kanadas Ministerpräsident Justin Trudeau telefoniert, um seine Entscheidung persönlich zu erläutern. Die USA würden sich auch ohne Abkommen darum bemühen, die Umwelt zu schützen. Japan erklärte, der Klimawandel brauche konzertierte Anstrengungen der ganzen internationalen Gemeinschaft.

Mit der Kündigung kann der Austritt der USA frühestens im Jahr 2020 wirksam werden. Die USA wären damit das einzige Land neben Syrien und Nicaragua, das nicht mehr Teil des UN-Weltklimavertrags ist. Er hat zum Ziel, die Erderwärmung auf deutlich unter zwei Grad gegenüber der vorindustriellen Zeit zu begrenzen. Trump hatte den Klimawandel im Wahlkampf als Erfindung der Chinesen bezeichnet, die nur der US-Wirtschaft schaden wollten.

CHEFS VON TESLA UND DISNEY SCHMEISSEN BEI TRUMP HIN

Die Welt habe applaudiert, als die USA den Vertrag unterzeichnet hätten, kritisierte Trump im Rosengarten des Weißen Hauses. Aber nur, weil er das Land zugunsten anderer schwäche. Andere würden daher über die USA lachen. "Sie werden es nicht mehr machen", sagte er. "Ich bin gewählt, um die Menschen von Pittsburgh zu vertreten, nicht Paris." Der demokratische Bürgermeister von Pittsburgh, Bill Peduto, antwortete umgehend, dass seine Stadt - lange Zentrum der US-Stahlindustrie - hinter dem Pariser Abkommen stehe.

Diejenigen, die die USA im Abkommen halten wollten, seien die gleichen, die ihren Beitrag etwa zur Nato nicht ausreichend leisteten, sagte Trump unter Anspielung auf Länder wie Deutschland. Die USA seien reich an Rohstoffen, und dieser enorme Reichtum solle dem Land mit dem Pariser Vertrag weggenommen werden, um ihn auf andere Staaten zu verteilen. Trump kritisierte, dass der Vertrag das Land Millionen Arbeitsplätze kostet. Länder wie China oder Indien aber dürften über Jahre immer mehr Treibhausgas ausstoßen.

Ex-Präsident Barack Obama, der das Abkommen mit ausgehandelt hatte, warf Trump vor, sich der Zukunft zu verweigern. Er sei überzeugt, dass die US-Bundesstaaten, die Städte und Unternehmen jetzt sogar mehr tun würden, um den Planeten zu schützen, heißt es in einer Erklärung. Tesla-Chef Elon Musk und Disney-Chef Robert Iger kündigten aus Protest ihre Beraterfunktionen beim Präsidenten. Apple, Facebook oder Ford kritisierten Trumps Schritt. Auch Dow Chemical und der Ölkonzern Exxon hatten ihn davor gewarnt. Dagegen kündigte der Kohlekonzern Peabody Energy an, Trump in dieser Sache zu unterstützen.

EU: KAMPF GEGEN KLIMAWANDEL GEHT WEITER

Die EU-Kommission teilte mit, sie werde sich nun um neue Bündnisse im Kampf gegen den Klimawandel bemühen. Der Rückzug der USA sei ein trauriger Tag für die Weltgemeinschaft.

Bundesumweltministerin Barbara Hendricks (SPD) erklärte, Trump habe sich für die Vergangenheit entschieden, der Rest der Welt für die Zukunft. Das "Paris-Abkommen wird Bestand haben - auch ohne die USA." Die EU und Deutschland hatten zum einen auf allen diplomatischen Kanälen versucht, Trump von einem Austritt abzubringen. Zum anderen hatten sich die Staaten aber offenbar auch mit Erfolg bemüht, einen Domino-Effekt nach einem US-Ausstieg zu verhindern. Deutschland hat derzeit die Präsidentschaft der Gruppe der 20 führenden Industrie- und Schwellenländer der Welt (G20) inne und steht nun vor einem schwierigen Gipfeltreffen Anfang Juli in Hamburg. Merkel wollte die Staaten dort zu einem einheitlich Votum für den Klimaschutz bewegen. Im Rahmen der G7 war Italien damit vergangene Woche am Widerstand von Trump gescheitert, was zu einem offenen Zerwürfnis führte. Mit den USA außerhalb des Pariser Klimavertrages dürfte eine Abschlusserklärung noch schwerer werden.

USA-Réaction mitigée des milieux d'affaires au retrait de l'accord de Paris - 路透新闻

{{20170602T021747.524+0000}}USA-Réaction mitigée des milieux d'affaires au retrait de l'accord de Parispar Emily Flitter et Valerie Volcovici

NEW YORK/WASHINGTON, 2 juin (Reuters) - La décision du président américain de retirer les Etats-Unis de l'accord de Paris sur le climat, présentée comme critique pour protéger l'économie et les emplois américains, a été accueillie jeudi avec une relative froideur dans les milieux d'affaires.

Des valeurs sûres du secteur -- Facebook, Apple , Ford ou Microsoft -- ont dénoncé la décision, tandis que chez les groupes gaziers et pétroliers, qui ont le plus à gagner d'un assouplissement des règles en matière d'émission polluantes, une réponse en demi-teinte était de mise.

Le patron des voitures électriques Tesla, Elon Musk, mais aussi celui de Walt Disney, Robert Iger, ont annoncé leur démission du conseil présidentiel auquel ils siégeaient jusqu'à présent.

Jeff Immelt, le directeur général de General Electric, a dit sa "déception" sur Twitter: "Le changement climatique est une réalité. L'industrie doit prendre le pas et ne pas dépendre du gouvernement."

Lloyd Blankfein, directeur général de la banque d'affaires Goldman Sachs, a dénoncé pour sa part "un recul pour l'environnement et pour la position de leadership des Etats-Unis dans le monde".

Le président de l'Association mondiale du charbon (WCA), Benjamin Sporton, a confié à Reuters lors d'une interview des sentiments mitigés quant à l'annonce de Trump et s'est dit impatient de voir une politique américaine octroyant une place au charbon dans le mix énergétique mondial.

"Ce dont nous avons vraiment besoin, si le président veut à nouveau rentrer dans l'accord, c'est qu'il le change pour reconnaître le rôle de toutes les sources d'énergie, y compris le charbon", a déclaré Sporton, ajoutant que son association avait fait valoir au président les avantages d'un maintien dans l'accord de Paris.

Peabody, premier producteur américain de charbon, a déclaré mercredi soutenir une sortie de l'accord, jugé "défectueux sur un certain nombre de niveaux".

DES COMPAGNIES PÉTROLIÈRES PRO-PARIS

L'American Petroleum Institute (API), qui regroupe les grandes compagnies pétrolières et gazières du pays, a dit dans un communiqué n'avoir jamais pris position officiellement sur l'accord.

Un certain nombre de compagnies de l'API, dont Exxon Mobil et ConocoPhillips , avaient rendu public leur soutien à l'accord.

"Pour nous, (...) il faut un cadre tel que celui-ci pour faire face aux risques du changement climatique", a dit mercredi le directeur général d'Exxon Mobil, Darren Woods, en marge de l'assemblée générale du groupe.

D'autres groupes ont exprimé un soutien prudent au projet de Trump et estimé qu'il permettrait de régler certains problèmes du texte.

"Les industriels soutiennent l'esprit de l'accord de Paris et les efforts pour répondre au changement climatique par le biais d'un accord international juste. Mais comme l'a reconnu le président, certains éléments de l'accord n'étaient pas équitables pour les industriels américains", a déclaré Ross Eisenberg, de la National Association of Manufacturers.

Pendant la campagne présidentielle, Donald Trump, qui doute de la responsabilité humaine dans le changement climatique, a promis de retirer les Etats-Unis d'un accord qui aurait selon lui détruit des emplois, freiné la croissance et coûté plus de mille milliards de dollars sans fournir de bénéfice tangible.

Trump withdrawal from climate deal gets mixed response from U.S. companies - 路透新闻

{{20170602T011530.236+0000}}Trump withdrawal from climate deal gets mixed response from U.S. companiesBy Emily Flitter and Valerie Volcovici

NEW YORK/WASHINGTON, June 1 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday withdrawing the country from the Paris climate accord would stave off an economic crisis and protect American jobs - but many American companies seemed to disagree.

Criticism of his decision rolled in from blue-chip companies like Facebook Inc , Apple Inc , Ford Motor Co and Microsoft Corp , while the response from fossil fuel groups with the most to gain from a relaxation of U.S. carbon emissions standards was muted.

Tesla Inc Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk and Walt Disney Co CEO Robert Iger said they would leave White House advisory councils over Trump's decision. [nL3N1IY5QF]

In an interview on Thursday, the president of the World Coal Association, Benjamin Sporton, told Reuters that he had mixed feelings about Trump's announcement, adding he was eager to see a U.S. policy that actively promotes a place for coal in the global energy mix.

"What we really need to see, if the president wants to re-enter the deal, is that he can change the agreement to recognize the role of all sources of energy, including coal," Sporton said, adding his group had described to administration officials the benefits of remaining in the agreement.

The American Petroleum Institute, the oil and gas industry's biggest trade group, meanwhile, issued a statement saying it had never taken an official position on the Paris accord.

A number of its members, including Exxon Mobil Corp and ConocoPhillips , had publicly supported the deal.

"For us, our position on the Paris agreement... we need a framework like that to address the risks of climate change," Exxon Mobil CEO Darren Woods told reporters on the sidelines of the company's annual general meeting on Wednesday. [nL1N1IX15V]

Some other groups expressed measured support for Trump's decision, saying it provided an opportunity to fix problems with the deal.

"Manufacturers support the spirit of the Paris Agreement and the effort to address climate change through a fair international agreement. But as the president has acknowledged, certain elements of this deal were not equitable for U.S. manufacturers," said Ross Eisenberg, vice president for energy and resources policy at the National Association of Manufacturers, in a statement to Reuters.

A spokesman for Peabody Energy Corp , America's largest publicly traded coal miner, had said on Wednesday that the company would support a decision by Trump to withdraw from the Paris deal because the "accord is flawed on a number of levels."

Trump vowed during his campaign to pull the United States out of the Paris deal, arguing the pact would cost the United States trillions of dollars, kill jobs, and stymie economic growth without providing tangible benefit.

His critics have argued, however, that the risks of climate change require action, and that a shift to a low-carbon energy economy can create more jobs than it eliminates.

"A SETBACK"

Spokespeople for other extractive oil and mining groups, like the National Mining Association and the American Fuel & Petrochemicals Manufacturers, declined to comment on Trump's decision to withdraw from the Paris accord.

But a number of other business leaders derided it in forceful terms.

"Today's decision is a setback for the environment and for the U.S.'s leadership position in the world," said Goldman Sachs Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein in his first-ever tweet. [nL1N1IY2CK]

"Disappointed with today's decision on the Paris Agreement. Climate change is real. Industry must now lead and not depend on government," tweeted General Electric Co's Jeff Immelt.

Apple's CEO Tim Cook, meanwhile, posted to Twitter: "Decision to withdraw from the #ParisAgreeement was wrong for our planet" and "Apple is committed to fight climate change and we will never waver".

"Withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement is bad for the environment, bad for the economy, and it puts our children's future at risk," wrote Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg in a Facebook post.

COLUMN-China is the winner from Trump's climate own goal: Russell - 路透新闻

{{20170602T003436.326+0000}}COLUMN-China is the winner from Trump's climate own goal: Russell(Graphic on Paris climate agreement: http://tmsnrt.rs/2fTjA1w)

By Clyde Russell

LAUNCESTON, Australia, June 2 (Reuters) - It's not hard to imagine Chinese President Xi Jinping having a wry smile at both the decision by Donald Trump to pull the United States out of the Paris climate accord and the global reaction.

While President Trump's decision had been expected, it does confirm that world leadership on efforts to limit global climate change will now shift to Asia, and China in particular. [nL1N1IY0MV]

Xi is now free to accept the mantle of global leadership on climate action, which will give him an opportunity to advance China's interests across the world at a time when Trump's actions are likely to cost the United States influence and allies.

The best part for Xi is that this hasn't cost him anything, Trump has done the damage to the United States all by himself, and is most likely unaware or uncaring of the likely consequences, which go well beyond the blow to the image of the United States as a global leader.

It's been a good past few weeks for Xi, given the successful hosting of a regional summit in Beijing to promote the "belt and road" initiative that ended on May 15 with pledges by China to spend as much as $800 billion on projects aimed at boosting trade and development across Asia, Africa and into Europe.

China, the world's largest polluter, was also quick to state that it remained committed to the 2015 Paris agreement, which aims to limit the rise in global temperatures to less than 2 degrees centigrade by the end of the century.

"China will stand by its responsibilities on climate change," Premier Li Keqiang told reporters on Thursday after meeting German Chancellor Angela Merkel and before flying on to Brussels for meetings with European Union officials that will include how to keep the Paris agreement going without U.S. participation. [nL8N1IY1J8]

While China has moved quickly to step into the leadership role vacated by Trump, it's likely that Xi will be looking for more than just increased prestige and prominence in international affairs.

China will most likely be seeking to attract more investment into renewable energy technology and manufacturing, building up a sector of its economy that is already experiencing rapid growth.

The opportunities for China are immense, as it can step into the U.S. role of providing technology and equipment transfer to developing nations to help them meet their commitments under the Paris agreement.

CHINA RAMPS UP RENEWABLES

China has committed to plough 2.5 trillion yuan ($361 billion) into renewable power generation by 2020, as the world's largest energy market continues to shift away from dirty coal power towards cleaner fuels.

The investment will create over 13 million jobs in the sector, the National Energy Administration said on Jan. 5 in a document that lays out its plan to develop the nation's energy sector during the five-year 2016 to 2020 period.

No doubt China will also seek to export renewable energy sources such as solar panels and wind turbines, and this process may well be helped by the country's strong stance in favour of the global climate accord.

It's also likely that China will join European countries in rejecting Trump's efforts to negotiate a better deal.

The countries that remain committed to the 195-nation Paris agreement have little incentive to give a better deal to the United States, the world's second-biggest polluter.

Rather it's more likely that they may seek to impose carbon-related tariffs on U.S. goods if these are deemed to be enjoying an unfair advantage because they are produced in an economy free of carbon restraints.

It's difficult to see how Trump's decision to exit the Paris deal is anything other than an own goal.

It's highly improbable that this will lead to more manufacturing jobs in the United States, instead it may actually encourage renewable energy pioneers to look at establishing facilities in countries with more progressive views.

It's also unlikely to revive the U.S. coal industry, which will remain under pressure from cheaper natural gas and the increasing cost-competitiveness of renewables.

It's a massive blow to U.S. prestige, and one that will likely filter down to U.S. companies that do business globally, making it harder for them to win business.

It also shows that Trump has little regard for his country's international reputation and that he remains under the spell of climate change deniers and nationalists with limited grasp of science or the economic implications.

Trump's actions also fly in the face of the wishes of many U.S. companies, including those that are supposed to be beneficiaries of the withdrawal, such as Exxon Mobil .

The maelstrom of criticism Trump is getting for abandoning the global climate pact is unlikely to dissuade him, or convince the section of his support base that fervently believe it is the correct course of action.

Much like the British vote to leave the European Union, the true costs of Trump's decision will only become apparent once it is too late.

Das Auswärtige Amt und die übrigen SPD-Ministerien in der Bundesregierung äußerten sich in einem ungewöhnlichen Schritt zusammen: Die USA schadeten sich selbst und allen anderen Völkern der Welt.

CORRECTED-UPDATE 3-U.S. coal stocks fall; exit from climate deal may hurt, not help - 路透新闻

{{20170601T202259.952+0000}}CORRECTED-UPDATE 3-U.S. coal stocks fall; exit from climate deal may hurt, not help(Removes fourth paragraph, which does not reflect Peabody's current position on Paris accord)

By Rodrigo Campos and Nichola Groom

NEW YORK/LOS ANGELES, May 31 (Reuters) - U.S. coal company shares dipped alongside renewable energy stocks on Wednesday after reports that President Donald Trump plans to pull the United States from a global accord on fighting climate change.

The market reaction reflects concerns, raised by some coal companies in recent months, that a U.S. exit from the Paris Climate Agreement could unleash a global backlash against coal interests outside the United States.

Peabody Energy , the largest publicly traded U.S. coal company dropped 2.2 percent to $24.29 a share, while Arch Coal fell 0.4 percent to $70.77.

A spokesman for Peabody said the company would support a decision by Trump to withdraw from the Paris deal because the "accord is flawed on a number of levels."

Cloud Peak Energy Inc had also urged the Trump administration to stay in the Paris deal to prevent other nations from an aggressive turn against the global coal industry. Its shares were down 0.6 percent to $3.39.

A spokesman for Cloud Peak declined to comment.

A source briefed on the matter told Reuters that Trump is planning to follow through on his campaign pledge to pull the United States out of the Paris accord, a move designed to help boost domestic energy production and speed economic growth, after weeks of deliberations on the issue.

Trump did not confirm the decision, but said he would make an announcement "over the coming days". [nL1N1IX0K6]

CAMPAIGN PLEDGE

A U.S. withdrawal would come over the objections of scores of big U.S. corporations - from Wal-Mart to Exxon Mobil - worried the move will complicate the business landscape instead of bolstering the economy.

"For us, our position on the Paris agreement... we need a framework like that to address the risks of climate change," Exxon Mobil Chief Executive Officer Darren Woods told reporters on the sidelines of the company's annual general meeting on Wednesday. Exxon had made that case in a recent letter to the White House, he said.

Exxon dipped 0.7 percent, ConocoPhillips declined 0.2 percent, and Chevron Corp fell 0.6 percent. Crude oil prices fell to a three-week low on news that recovering Libyan output boosted OPEC crude output in May. [nL3N1IX0XS]

Solar energy shares also got hit on Wednesday, with First Solar Inc down 2.5 percent, and SunPower Corp each down 3.4 percent.

"Regardless of what the President decides on the accord, we expect America's solar industry to continue to thrive and create jobs, boost the economy and reduce greenhouse gas emissions," the Solar Energy Industries Association said in a statement.

Shares of Tesla Inc , which recently acquired SolarCity, were up 1.8 percent at $341.01.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk said in a Twitter post on Wednesday that he had done "all I can" to convince Trump to stay in the Paris accord, and threatened to leave White House advisory councils if Trump announces a U.S. exit.

Trump campaigned on a promise to unravel Obama-era climate regulations to help boost domestic oil, gas and coal production. Company executives, economists, and analysts have expressed skepticism, however, that his deregulatory agenda can alter existing trends away from coal.

U.S. carbon emissions have declined to near 30-year lows, a trend driven by increased natural gas use replacing coal.

The VanEck Vectors Coal exchange-traded fund fell 1.2 percent to $12.71, not far from a five-month low hit earlier in May. The ETF is on track to fall 7.2 percent this month after rising in the first three months of the year as part of the so-called Trump trade.

UPDATE 2-Italy's Eni signs LNG deal in Mozambique, raising hopes of gas boom - 路透新闻

{{20170601T193645.215+0000}}UPDATE 2-Italy's Eni signs LNG deal in Mozambique, raising hopes of gas boom* Coral South field has 16 tcf of gas in place

* Project to cost $8 bln, LNG exports to begin in 2022

* Mozambique well positioned to supply Asia

(Adds value of the project in paragraph 3)

By Manuel Macuri

MAPUTO, June 1 (Reuters) - Italian energy company Eni signed an $8 billion deal on Thursday to develop a gas field off the coast of Mozambique, the first of a series of projects that could transform the poor African nation into a major energy supplier to Asia.

Developing the Coral South field, discovered in May 2012 and operated by Eni, requires building six subsea wells connected to a floating facility capable of producing about 3.4 million tonnes of liquefied natural gas (LNG) per year, Eni said.

The project would cost $8 billion and LNG exports were expected to start in 2022, Eni said.

"The Coral South Project will deliver a reliable source of energy while contributing to Mozambique's economic development," Eni chief executive Claudio Descalzi said in a statement.

The Coral South field contains about 450 billion cubic metres, or 16 trillion cubic feet (tcf) of gas. The field lies in the Rovuma Basin, with estimated reserves of about 85 tcf, enough to supply Germany, Britain, France and Italy for nearly two decades.

Mozambican authorities approved the project's development plan in February 2016 and in October Eni signed a 20-year deal to supply BP with LNG from the project. [nL5N1CA31B]

Mozambique, which lies on Africa's eastern seaboard, is well placed to supply growing Asian economies with gas, analysts say.

The floating LNG platform will be built in South Korea by a consortium led by Samsung Heavy <010140.KS>. The group includes France's Technip and Japan's JGC <1963.T>. [nL8N1A71YQ]

Partners in the field development include China National Petroleum Co (CNPC) [CNPET.UL], Korea Gas Corp (Kogas) <036460.KS> and Mozambique's state-run Empresa Nacional de Hidrocarbonetos (ENH).

U.S. energy major Exxon Mobil Corp agreed this year to pay Eni $2.8 billion for a 25 percent stake in its huge Area 4 concession off the coast of Mozambique, which includes the Coral South field. [nL3N1GM3SO]

U.S. firm Anadarko is planning a separate onshore LNG project in northern Mozambique.

Eni said project finance would fund 60 percent of the cost of building the floating LNG facility, while the financing agreement has been subscribed by 15 major international banks and guaranteed by five export credit agencies.

Eni's long-delayed final investment decision will be a relief for the Mozambican government following a high-profile debt scandal that emerged last year.

The International Monetary Fund and Western donors cut budget support when $2 billion in hidden loans were exposed, plunging the country into economic crisis.

LNG exports are seen as the only likely long-term solution to the country's deep financial problems.

"This is really good news for the government of Mozambique," said Alasdair Reid, Africa expert at energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie. "It demonstrates that, despite ongoing credit issues, there is still enough belief in the investment climate for partners to raise finance and move projects forward."

TOP-THEMA-Welt zeigt Einigkeit für Klimaschutz - Trump isoliert - 路透新闻

{{20170601T120359.075+0000}}TOP-THEMA-Welt zeigt Einigkeit für Klimaschutz - Trump isoliert(Durchgehend neu)

* US-Präsident will Entscheidung über Ausstieg bekanntgeben

* China: Wir stehen zu unsere Verantwortung

* Auch Russland und Indien wollen im Klimavertrag bleiben

* Deutschland vor schwierigem G20-Treffen

- von Markus Wacket und Andreas Rinke

Berlin, 01. Jun (Reuters) - Kurz vor der Entscheidung von US-Präsident Donald Trump zum Welt-Klimavertrag haben führende Staaten ein Bekenntnis zu dem Abkommen abgelegt und die USA weiter isoliert. "Unsere Worte zählen, und unsere Taten müssen Erfolge habe. China wird zu seiner Verantwortung stehen", sagte Ministerpräsident Li Keqiang am Donnerstag nach einem Treffen mit Kanzlerin Angela Merkel in Berlin. Der Kampf gegen den Klimawandel liege im Interesse seines Landes. China ist vor den USA der größte Treibhausgas-Produzent. Russland bekräftigte ebenfalls, man stehe zum Abkommen. Ohne wichtige Unterzeichner sei dies aber weniger effektiv. Während Bundesaußenminister Sigmar Gabriel vor dem Scheitern des Vertrages warnte, sagte Umweltministerin Barbara Hendricks, der Kampf gegen den Klimawandel werde ohne die USA weitergehen: "Paris ist nicht tot."

Trump hat noch für Donnerstag (21:00 Uhr MESZ) eine Entscheidung über den Verbleib seines Landes im 2015 geschlossenen Weltklimavertrag bekanntgeben. Nach Informationen eines Insiders wird Trump den Ausstieg verkünden. Mehrere US-Medien haben dies ebenfalls berichtet. Die USA wären damit neben Syrien und Nicaragua das einzige Land der Weltgemeinschaft außerhalb des UN-Abkommens. Dieses hat zum Ziel, die Erderwärmung auf deutlich unter zwei Grad gegenüber der vorindustriellen Zeit zu begrenzen. Trump hatte den Klimawandel im Wahlkampf als Erfindung der Chinesen bezeichnet, die nur der US-Wirtschaft schaden wollten. Er stellte deswegen den Austritt aus dem Abkommen in Aussicht.

Chinas Ministerpräsident Li betonte in Berlin, sein Land habe als eines der ersten Länder die Vorgaben des Pariser Klimaschutzabkommens auch in nationale Gesetze übertragen. "Wir wissen, dass eine Volkswirtschaft in einem bestimmten Entwicklungsstadium unbedingt auf nachhaltiges und grünes Wachstum setzen muss." Merkel lobte dies und betonte die gemeinsame Verantwortung für den internationalen Kampf gegen den Klimawandel. Eine ähnliche Zusage hatte Merkel Anfang der Woche von Indiens Ministerpräsident Narendra Modi bekommen. Indien ist drittgrößter Kohlendioxid(CO2)-Produzent vor Russland. Li Keqiang reist weiter nach Brüssel zum EU-China-Gipfel, wo weitere Vereinbarungen zum Klimaschutz unterzeichnet werden sollen.

HENDRICKS: WELTKLIMA WIRD JAHRE OHNE USA ÜBERSTEHEN

Deutschland und die EU hatten zum einen auf allen diplomatischen Kanälen versucht, Trump von einem Austritt abzubringen. Zum anderen hatten sich die Staaten aber offenbar auch mit Erfolg bemüht, einen Domino-Effekt nach einem US-Ausstieg zu verhindern. Umweltministerin Barbara Hendricks sagte, der Klimaschutz werde so oder so weitergehen. "Acht Jahre würde das Weltklima auch noch überstehen ohne die Vereinigten Staaten", sagte die SPD-Politikerin im rbb-Inforadio unter Hinweis auf die maximale Amtszeit eines amerikanischen Präsidenten.

Außenminister Gabriel warnte hingegen vor einem Scheitern des Vertrages. Dann würden sich die Wüsten ausbreiten und Kriege und Bürgerkriege um Wasser stattfinden. Dies würde wiederum Folgen haben für die Flüchtlings- und Wanderungsbewegungen auf der Welt.

Deutschland hat derzeit die Präsidentschaft der Gruppe der 20 führenden Industrie- und Schwellenländer der Welt (G20) inne und steht nun vor einem schwierigen Gipfeltreffen Anfang Juli in Hamburg. Merkel wollte die Staaten dort zu einem einheitlich Votum für den Klimaschutz bewegen. Im Rahmen der G7 war Italien damit vergangene Woche am Widerstand von Trump gescheitert, was zu einem offenen Zerwürfnis führte. Mit den USA außerhalb des Pariser Klimavertrages dürfte eine Abschlusserklärung noch schwerer werden.

WIDERSTAND GEGEN TRUMP AUCH VON US-KONZERNEN

Trump hat verschiedene Möglichkeiten zum Ausstieg aus dem Abkommen, was sich bis zum Jahr 2020 hinziehen könnte. Aber bereits jetzt hat der Präsident per Dekret Klimaschutz-Entscheidugen seines Vorgänger Barack Obama aufgehoben, so dass die Zusagen für den Weltklimavertrag ohnehin kaum noch einzuhalten wären.

Die USA haben sich so nicht nur weltweit isoliert. Auch innerhalb des Landes stößt Trump auf Widerstand. Zahlreiche Unternehmen haben an den Präsidenten appelliert, den Vertrag nicht aufzukündigen. Darunter sind Konzerne wie Apple, aber auch Industrieriesen wie Dow Chemical und Exxon. Tesla-Chef Elon Musk kündigte an, sollten die USA den Klimavertrag verlassen, werde er seine Funktion als Berater Trumps aufgeben. Zahlreiche Bundesstaaten wie Kalifornien bekennen sich zudem zum Kampf gegen den Klimawandel und machen eigene Vorgaben.

Die deutsche Industrie befürchtet so allerdings wachsende rechtliche Unsicherheiten in dem wichtigen Exportland. Während die Regierung in Washington die Regeln beim Ausstoß von Kohlendioxid lockern wolle, gebe es strengere Vorschriften in sieben anderen Bundesstaaten, sagte der Präsident des Automobilverbandes VDA, Matthias Wissmann. "Für jemanden, der für den US-Markt produziert, ist es ein ziemliches Problem, wenn es unterschiedliche Rechtsvorschriften gibt."

RPT-Exxon vote shows Wall St diverging from Trump on climate change - 路透新闻

{{20170601T110002.856+0000}}RPT-Exxon vote shows Wall St diverging from Trump on climate change(Repeats story published Wednesday with no changes)

By Ross Kerber

BOSTON, June 1 (Reuters) - Major investors put U.S. industry on notice on Wednesday that climate change matters, even as reports emerged that President Donald Trump plans to withdraw the United States from an international pact to fight global warming.

A number of large institutional fund firms including BlackRock Inc, the world's largest asset manager, supported a shareholder resolution calling on Exxon Mobil Corp to share more information about how new technologies and climate change regulations could impact the business of the world's largest publicly traded oil company. The proposal won the support of 62.3 percent of votes cast. [nL1N1IX15V]

The victory, on such a wide margin, was hailed by climate activists as a turning point in their decades-long campaign to get oil and gas companies to communicate how they would adapt to a low-carbon economy.

With major investors now seeing climate change as a major risk, activists said U.S. corporations will have to be more transparent about the impact of a warming planet even if the United States withdraws from the 2015 Paris climate accord, as Trump promised during his presidential campaign.[nL1N1IX0K6]

"Economic forces are outrunning any other considerations," said Anne Simpson, investment director for sustainability at the California Public Employees' Retirement System, one of the sponsors of the resolution.

She credited big investors in Exxon for the change, since at least some of them switched their votes after last year when a similar measure won just 38 percent support.

"We have seen a sea change in their viewpoint," she said. Many top investors now consider their votes on shareholder proposals "on merit, rather than considering it a test of loyalty to management," she said.

Among Exxon's top investors, Vanguard Group Inc and BlackRock Inc opposed last year's call for climate change reporting. A spokeswoman for Vanguard, which has about 7 percent of Exxon's shares, declined to comment on its voting this year.

A person familiar with the matter said funds run by BlackRock, which holds about 6 percent of Exxon shares, voted in favor of the climate resolution.

Filings showing their exact votes are not due for months. But both fund firms and others have taken steps since last year to make it easier to support climate resolutions.

A spokesman for Exxon's ninth-largest investor Northern Trust Corp , Doug Holt, said it voted in favor of the proposal, citing its own guidelines updated in 2016.

THE VOTE FROM THE STREET

The investment firms' approach reflects a new interest in climate matters among their own investors, who have stuffed money into so-called "green" mutual funds and other vehicles that use environmental factors in their stockpicking.[nL1N1IT0EG]

Wall Street's priorities have shifted the terms of debate at a number of other energy and utility companies. A majority of shareholders voting at Occidental Petroleum Corp and PPL Corp called for similar reports on the risks of climate change. Votes on two more of the measures are scheduled for June 7 at Devon Energy Corp and at Hess Corp . [nL1N1IR1BA] [nL1N1IE20Q]

Michael Crosby, involved in corporate outreach for the Midwest Capuchin Franciscans, a religious order, said Wednesday's vote was a rejection of Exxon's arguments it already provides enough detail on its outlook.

"The Street is saying, you have to give better evidence," Crosby said.

After the measure passed, Exxon Chief Executive Officer Darren Woods said its board would reconsider its climate communications.

The activists now face the task of maintaining alliances with leaders like Woods who opposed their resolutions but who in some cases support the 195-nation Paris agreement. Exxon said in a March 22 letter to the White House that the Paris deal is "an effective framework for addressing the risks of climate change."

Trump had at least one ally at Exxon's meeting in Dallas, Steven Milloy of Potomac, Maryland, who urged other investors to support his resolution that would make it harder to file proposals like the one on climate change. Milloy said management should show less concerns for climate issues, which he called misplaced, and cited Trump as a model. "For the first time we have a president who actively opposes climate hysteria," Milloy said.

According to Exxon, Milloy's proposal received support from 1.6 percent of votes cast.

- Express Scripts , the nation's largest pharmacy benefits manager, is suing Kaléo, the manufacturer of Evzio. Express Scripts claims it is owed more than $14.5 million in fees and rebates related to Evzio, and it has dropped the drug from its preferred list. http://nyti.ms/2rdnd6A

- In a reversal, a majority of Exxon Mobil's shareholders, have voted in favor of more open and detailed analyses of the risks posed to its business by policies aimed at stemming climate change. Those policies include the goal of the Paris climate agreement to restrict global temperatures to no more than 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels. http://nyti.ms/2rdwdsx

- Trump is expected to withdraw the United States from the 2015 climate change accord that committed nearly every nation to take action to curb the warming of the planet. Trump said on Twitter that he had made his decision and would announce it in the Rose Garden on Thursday afternoon. http://nyti.ms/2rdAFYe

WDHLG-TOP-THEMA-EU will US-Ausstieg aus Klimavertrag nicht einfach hinnehmen - 路透新闻

{{20170601T041624.120+0000}}WDHLG-TOP-THEMA-EU will US-Ausstieg aus Klimavertrag nicht einfach hinnehmen(Wiederholung vom Vorabend)

* Juncker: Pflicht zu sagen: So geht das nicht

* Bericht: Beratungen über konkrete Umsetzung laufen

* Bundesregierung: Haben keine Kenntnis von Trumps Entscheidung

* Trump: Gebe Entscheidung in nächsten Tagen bekannt

- von Valerie Volcovici und Markus Wacket

Washington/Berlin, 31. Mai (Reuters) - Die Europäische Union will die drohende Abkehr der USA aus dem Pariser Klimavertrag nicht einfach akzeptieren. "Es ist die Pflicht Europas zu sagen: So geht das nicht", sagte EU-Kommissionspräsident Jean-Claude Juncker in Berlin. Es werde Jahre dauern, bis die USA aus ihren Verpflichtungen herauskämen. US-Präsident Donald Trump will einem Insider zufolge aus dem Klimaabkommen aussteigen und wendet sich damit in einem wichtigen Punkt von der Weltgemeinschaft ab. Die Entscheidung sei gefallen, sagte eine mit dem Beschluss vertraute Person am Mittwoch der Nachrichtenagentur Reuters.

Mehrere US-Medien wie der Sender Fox News berichteten dies ebenfalls. Trump selbst erklärte, er werde sich in den kommenden Tagen äußern. Die USA als zweitgrößter Treibhausgasproduzent nach China wären damit neben Syrien und Nicaragua das einzige Land außerhalb des Abkommens von 2015. Dahinter stehen rund 200 Staaten. Ziel ist es, die Erderwärmung auf deutlich unter zwei Grad gegenüber der vorindustriellen Zeit zu begrenzen. Der Klimaschutz soll auch Teil des Beschlusses der 20 einflussreichsten Staaten der Welt (G20) werden, die sich im Juli in Hamburg treffen.

Trump hatte den Klimawandel im Wahlkampf als Erfindung der Chinesen bezeichnet, die nur der US-Wirtschaft schaden wollten. Er stellte deswegen den Austritt aus dem Abkommen in Aussicht. Nach seinem Regierungsantritt legte er sich jedoch nicht mehr öffentlich fest.

Die EU und Deutschland versuchten noch auf verschiedenen diplomatischen Kanälen, Trump von einem Austritt abzuhalten. Einen Plan B für einen Klimavertrag ohne die USA gebe es nicht, sagte der stellvertretende Präsident der EU-Kommission, Maros Sefcovic. "Als ich selbst im Weißen Haus war, habe ich erklärt, dass es keinen Plan B gibt, denn es gibt keinen Planeten B." Die EU sei aber für eine Führungsrolle in Klimafragen bereit, wenn die USA nun ausfalle. "Wenn sie sich entscheiden auszusteigen, wäre das enttäuschend. Aber ich glaube nicht, dass dies den Lauf der Geschichte ändern wird." Auch die Bundesregierung arbeitete daran, dass ein Ausstieg der USA keinen Dominoeffekt auslöst. Wichtige Staaten wie China und Indien haben bekräftigt, sie würden zum Vertrag stehen. Die Bundesregierung selbst erklärte, sie kenne keinen Beschluss Trumps. SPD-Kanzlerkandidat Martin Schulz warnte vor erheblichen Wettbewerbsnachteilen für die europäischen Unternehmen, sollten die USA aus dem Abkommen aussteigen.[nL8N1IX6FG] Ein Sprecher des französischen Präsidenten Emmanuel Macron sagte, Frankreich werde "pro-aktiv" darauf hinwirken, dass das Klimaabkommen umgesetzt werde.

JUNCKER - HERR TRUMP KENNT DIE DETAILS NICHT

"Die Amerikaner können gar nicht aus diesem Klimaschutzabkommen aussteigen", sagte Juncker in Berlin. "Herr Trump glaubt das, weil er die Details nicht kennt."

Das Internetportal Axios berichtete, zurzeit liefen in der US-Regierung die Beratungen darüber, auf welchem Weg das Abkommen verlassen werde solle. Damit befasse sich eine kleine Gruppe um den Chef der Umweltbehörde EPA, Scott Pruitt. Sie müsse entscheiden, ob die USA die Vereinbarung von Paris kündigen werde. Damit könnte der Austritt frühestens 2020 wirksam werden. Alternativ ist auch ein Ausstieg aus der UN-Konvention zum Klimawandel möglich, die dem Abkommen zugrunde liegt. Damit wären die USA in etwa einem Jahr nicht mehr Teil des Vertrages. Dies wäre aber ein noch gravierenderer Schnitt, da die USA dann an Konferenzen rund um Klima- und Umweltthemen nicht einmal am Rande teilnehmen könnten.

Die unmittelbaren Auswirkungen eines Austritts sind nach Einschätzung aus deutschen Regierungskreisen zunächst beschränkt. Allerdings haben die Staaten in Paris vereinbart, dass sie sich 2020 ehrgeizigere Vorgaben zur Verringerung der Klimagase setzen wollen, damit das Zwei-Grad-Ziel bis Ende des Jahrhunderts erreicht werden kann. Die USA würden hier ausfallen. Zudem könnte dies bewirken, dass weitere Staaten bei ihren Zielen zurückhaltender werden.

G20-TREFFEN IN HAMBURG UNTER NOCH SCHWIERIGEREN VORZEICHEN

Kanzlerin Angela Merkel droht nun ein schwieriges Treffen beim G20-Gipfel unter deutscher Führung. Schon in der vergangenen Woche zeigte der G7-Gipfel in Italien ein Zerwürfnis zwischen den USA und den übrigen Teilnehmern. In der Frage des freien Welthandels, aber vor allem beim Klimaschutz waren die USA isoliert. Merkel kritisierte am Wochenende mit Blick auf den Weltklimavertrag: "Dieses Pariser Abkommen ist ja nicht irgendein Abkommen, sondern es ist schon ein zentrales Abkommen zur Gestaltung der Globalisierung". Zurück in Deutschland forderte Merkel angesichts der Konflikte eine größere Eigenständigkeit der Europäer.[nL8N1IU0GJ]

Das Ringen um den Klimaschutz hat gravierende Auswirkungen auf die Wirtschaft. Staaten fürchten, dass ihr Engagement Nachteile im Wettbewerb mit Ländern mit laxeren Klimavorgaben bringen könnte. Vor allem das Ja sowohl von den USA und dem Rivalen China zum Pariser Vertrag löste damals bei Klimaschützern Optimismus aus. Die Chefs großer Konzerne wie ExxonMobil, Dow Chemical und Tesla appellierten an Trump, an dem Klimaabkommen festzuhalten. Tesla-Chef Elon Musk drohte damit, aus einem Beratergremium des US-Präsidialamtes auszuscheiden, sollte Trump aus dem Vertrag aussteigen.

UPDATE 9-Trump to announce decision on global climate deal on Thursday - 路透新闻

{{20170601T014821.348+0000}}UPDATE 9-Trump to announce decision on global climate deal on Thursday* Trump says he is listening to people on both sides

* Pullout would make U.S. only third nation not in pact

* Democrat Clinton, Republican Romney oppose pullout

* Leaving the deal would take the U.S. years, Juncker says

(Updates with Trump tweet on timing of announcement)

By Valerie Volcovici and Jeff Mason

WASHINGTON, May 31 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump said he would announce on Thursday his decision whether to keep the United States in a global pact to fight climate change, as a source close to the matter said he was preparing to pull out of the Paris accord.

Trump said he would make the announcement at 3 p.m. EDT (1900 GMT) in the White House Rose Garden, ending his tweet with "MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!"

During his 2016 presidential campaign, Trump blasted the accord, and called global warming a hoax aimed at weakening U.S. industry.

The Republican vowed at the time to "cancel" the Paris deal within 100 days of becoming president on Jan. 20, part of an effort to bolster U.S. oil and coal industries.

A U.S. withdrawal could deepen a rift with U.S. allies. The United States would join Syria and Nicaragua as the world's only non-participants in the landmark 195-nation accord agreed upon in Paris in 2015.

Trump came under pressure on Wednesday from corporate CEOs, U.S. allies, Democrats and some fellow Republicans to keep the United States in the accord.

Responding to shouted questions earlier on Wednesday from reporters in the White House Oval Office where he met with Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc, Trump said: "I'm hearing from a lot of people, both ways."

The source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Trump was working out terms of the planned withdrawal with U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt, an oil industry ally and climate change doubter.

The pact was the first legally binding global deal to fight climate change. Virtually every nation voluntarily committed to steps aimed at curbing global emissions of "greenhouse" gases. These include carbon dioxide generated from burning of fossil fuels that scientists blame for a warming planet, sea level rise, droughts and more frequent violent storms.

The United States committed to reduce its emissions by 26 percent to 28 percent from 2005 levels by 2025.

Advocates of the climate deal pressured Trump, who has changed his mind on large decisions before even after signaling a move in the opposite direction.

The chief executives of dozens of companies have made last-minute appeals to Trump. The CEOs of ExxonMobil Corp , Apple Inc , Dow Chemical Co , Unilever NV and Tesla Inc were among those urging him to remain in the agreement. Tesla's Elon Musk threatened to quit White House advisory councils if the president pulls out.

Musk said: "I've done all I can to advise directly" to Trump and through others in the White House.

Robert Murray, CEO of Murray Energy Corp [MUYEY.UL], an Ohio-based coal company and major Trump campaign donor, urged Trump to withdraw from the deal. But on Wednesday, U.S. coal company shares fell alongside renewable energy stocks following reports that Trump would pull out. [nL1N1IX0YV]

Pulling the United States from the accord could further alienate American allies in Europe already wary of Trump and call into question U.S. leadership and trustworthiness on one of the world's leading issues. It also would be one more step by the Republican president to erase the legacy of his predecessor, Democrat Barack Obama, who helped broker the accord and praised it during a trip to Europe this month.

BROAD IMPLICATIONS

A U.S. pullout could have sweeping implications. The deal relies heavily on reductions in emissions by big polluter nations, and the United States is the world's second-biggest carbon dioxide emitter behind China.

At a conference near Los Angeles, Democrat Hillary Clinton, who Trump defeated in the 2016 presidential election, said withdrawing would be a mistake. "Part of what keeps us going is that America's word is good, and that you stand with your prior administration whether it was of your party or not," she said.

Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee who Trump considered for secretary of state, said on Twitter that affirmation of the Paris agreement "is not only about the climate: It is also about America remaining the global leader."

Democratic U.S. Senators Bob Menendez and Jack Reed wrote a letter urging Trump not to withdraw. They said withdrawal would undermine U.S. credibility and its position as a global leader, empowering nations like China to drive the climate agenda and set international standards while also reaping economic benefits from a growing clean energy sector.

U.S. allies rallied behind the Paris accord on Wednesday. [nL8N1IX4C8]

In Berlin, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker stressed withdrawal would take years, saying: "The Americans can't just leave the climate protection agreement. Mr. Trump believes that because he doesn't know the details." [nL8N1IX5X6]

China and the European Union will seek on Friday to buttress the agreement. In a statement backed by all 28 EU states, the European Union and China will commit to full implementation of the accord, EU and Chinese officials said. [nL8N1IX5CW]

Trump has said the accord would cost the U.S. economy trillions of dollars without tangible benefit. For the president, a withdrawal would reflect his "America First" approach to policy, unencumbered by international obligations.

Trump refused to endorse the accord at a summit of the G7 group of wealthy nations on Saturday in Italy, saying he needed more time to decide. [nL8N1IT044]

Acionistas da Exxon aprovam medida para maior transparência sobre impactos climáticos - 路透新闻

{{20170531T235154.364+0000}}Acionistas da Exxon aprovam medida para maior transparência sobre impactos climáticosDALLAS, 31 Mai (Reuters) - O presidente-executivo da Exxon Mobil disse nesta quarta-feira que a companhia vai reconsiderar a maneira como comunica os riscos enfrentados por mudanças climáticas, após acionistas terem aprovado uma medida pedindo por mais transparência.

Uma proposta não-vinculativa foi aprovada por 62 por cento dos votos, em uma rara derrota para a administração da Exxon, a qual havia feito recomendação contra a medida.

A companhia argumentou que já fornece informações suficientes sobre o potencial impacto de mudanças tecnológicas e da demanda de energia sobre seu portfólio de ativos.

Os resultados devem refletir como grandes acionistas votam medidas do tipo, após a mesma proposta, no ano passado, ter recebido apoio de apenas 38,1 por cento.

A proposta pediu para que a Exxon os riscos que seu negócio pode enfrentar frente a mudanças tecnológicas e de políticas de mudanças climáticas -- tais como o acordo de 2015 que busca manter o aumento médio na temperatura global abaixo de 2 graus Celsius.

UPDATE 3-Exxon shareholders approve climate impact report in win for activists - 路透新闻

{{20170531T231158.536+0000}}UPDATE 3-Exxon shareholders approve climate impact report in win for activists(Adds Breakingviews link)

By Gary McWilliams

DALLAS, May 31 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp's chief executive said on Wednesday the company would reconsider how it communicates the risks its faces from climate change after shareholders approved a measure calling for increased transparency.

The non-binding proposal passed with 62 percent of ballots cast in a rare defeat for Exxon's management, which had recommended a vote against the measure. The company argued that it already provides sufficient information on the potential impact of changing technologies and energy demand on its asset portfolio.

The results likely reflected a shift in how big shareholders voted on the measure, as the same proposal last year received only 38.1 percent of shares voted.

Asset manager BlackRock Inc backed the proposal, according to a source familiar with the matter. BlackRock holds about 6 percent of Exxon shares.

Among other top Exxon shareholders, spokespeople for State Street Corp and Vanguard Group declined to comment on the vote on Wednesday. "It's a powerful message," New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli said in an interview. A New York state public employee pension fund he oversees was one of the proposal's sponsors. "They recognized the global community is staying committed to Paris," he said, referring to the Paris global climate accord. The proposal asked for Exxon to report on risks its business could face from technology changes and from climate change policies such as the 2015 accord aiming to keep average global temperature increases below 2 degrees Celsius.

In remarks following the shareholder meeting, Exxon Chief Executive Darren Woods said the board would reconsider its climate change-related communications but did not commit to producing the report requested in the proposal.

He also said board directors would review a policy designed to bar them from meeting individually with big shareholders, a practice criticized by the climate proposal sponsors.

"We take the vote seriously will respond to that feedback and look for opportunities" to communicate, Woods said. "That issue along with others is part of dialogue we have with the board."

Exxon still faces probes by Massachusetts and New York Attorneys General into whether it misled the public and investors by soft-pedaling climate change risks. Exxon has said suits are politically motivated and intended to force it and others to change their positions on climate change.

Protesters, some in skeleton costumes, held up signs saying "Exxon Lied" across the street from Wednesday's annual meeting.

Approval of Exxon's executive pay meanwhile received 68 percent of ballots cast, down from 89 percent a year ago. Proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services had recommended shareholders reject the executive pay plan. [nL4N1IL1K7]

A proposal calling for a report on Exxon's efforts to reduce emissions of methane, another greenhouse gas, in its operations received support of nearly 39 percent of ballots cast.

Another proposal calling on the company to increase shareholder payouts in light of climate change-related risks was approved by less than 4 percent of ballots cast. Exxon had opposed both proposals.

Earlier, Exxon's Woods had said the company supported the goals of many of the proposals, but disagreed with the methods.

{{20170601T120359.075+0000}}TOP-THEMA-Welt zeigt Einigkeit für Klimaschutz - Trump isoliert(Durchgehend neu)

* US-Präsident will Entscheidung über Ausstieg bekanntgeben

* China: Wir stehen zu unsere Verantwortung

* Auch Russland und Indien wollen im Klimavertrag bleiben

* Deutschland vor schwierigem G20-Treffen

- von Markus Wacket und Andreas Rinke

Berlin, 01. Jun (Reuters) - Kurz vor der Entscheidung von US-Präsident Donald Trump zum Welt-Klimavertrag haben führende Staaten ein Bekenntnis zu dem Abkommen abgelegt und die USA weiter isoliert. "Unsere Worte zählen, und unsere Taten müssen Erfolge habe. China wird zu seiner Verantwortung stehen", sagte Ministerpräsident Li Keqiang am Donnerstag nach einem Treffen mit Kanzlerin Angela Merkel in Berlin. Der Kampf gegen den Klimawandel liege im Interesse seines Landes. China ist vor den USA der größte Treibhausgas-Produzent. Russland bekräftigte ebenfalls, man stehe zum Abkommen. Ohne wichtige Unterzeichner sei dies aber weniger effektiv. Während Bundesaußenminister Sigmar Gabriel vor dem Scheitern des Vertrages warnte, sagte Umweltministerin Barbara Hendricks, der Kampf gegen den Klimawandel werde ohne die USA weitergehen: "Paris ist nicht tot."

Trump hat noch für Donnerstag (21:00 Uhr MESZ) eine Entscheidung über den Verbleib seines Landes im 2015 geschlossenen Weltklimavertrag bekanntgeben. Nach Informationen eines Insiders wird Trump den Ausstieg verkünden. Mehrere US-Medien haben dies ebenfalls berichtet. Die USA wären damit neben Syrien und Nicaragua das einzige Land der Weltgemeinschaft außerhalb des UN-Abkommens. Dieses hat zum Ziel, die Erderwärmung auf deutlich unter zwei Grad gegenüber der vorindustriellen Zeit zu begrenzen. Trump hatte den Klimawandel im Wahlkampf als Erfindung der Chinesen bezeichnet, die nur der US-Wirtschaft schaden wollten. Er stellte deswegen den Austritt aus dem Abkommen in Aussicht.

Chinas Ministerpräsident Li betonte in Berlin, sein Land habe als eines der ersten Länder die Vorgaben des Pariser Klimaschutzabkommens auch in nationale Gesetze übertragen. "Wir wissen, dass eine Volkswirtschaft in einem bestimmten Entwicklungsstadium unbedingt auf nachhaltiges und grünes Wachstum setzen muss." Merkel lobte dies und betonte die gemeinsame Verantwortung für den internationalen Kampf gegen den Klimawandel. Eine ähnliche Zusage hatte Merkel Anfang der Woche von Indiens Ministerpräsident Narendra Modi bekommen. Indien ist drittgrößter Kohlendioxid(CO2)-Produzent vor Russland. Li Keqiang reist weiter nach Brüssel zum EU-China-Gipfel, wo weitere Vereinbarungen zum Klimaschutz unterzeichnet werden sollen.

HENDRICKS: WELTKLIMA WIRD JAHRE OHNE USA ÜBERSTEHEN

Deutschland und die EU hatten zum einen auf allen diplomatischen Kanälen versucht, Trump von einem Austritt abzubringen. Zum anderen hatten sich die Staaten aber offenbar auch mit Erfolg bemüht, einen Domino-Effekt nach einem US-Ausstieg zu verhindern. Umweltministerin Barbara Hendricks sagte, der Klimaschutz werde so oder so weitergehen. "Acht Jahre würde das Weltklima auch noch überstehen ohne die Vereinigten Staaten", sagte die SPD-Politikerin im rbb-Inforadio unter Hinweis auf die maximale Amtszeit eines amerikanischen Präsidenten.

Außenminister Gabriel warnte hingegen vor einem Scheitern des Vertrages. Dann würden sich die Wüsten ausbreiten und Kriege und Bürgerkriege um Wasser stattfinden. Dies würde wiederum Folgen haben für die Flüchtlings- und Wanderungsbewegungen auf der Welt.

Deutschland hat derzeit die Präsidentschaft der Gruppe der 20 führenden Industrie- und Schwellenländer der Welt (G20) inne und steht nun vor einem schwierigen Gipfeltreffen Anfang Juli in Hamburg. Merkel wollte die Staaten dort zu einem einheitlich Votum für den Klimaschutz bewegen. Im Rahmen der G7 war Italien damit vergangene Woche am Widerstand von Trump gescheitert, was zu einem offenen Zerwürfnis führte. Mit den USA außerhalb des Pariser Klimavertrages dürfte eine Abschlusserklärung noch schwerer werden.

WIDERSTAND GEGEN TRUMP AUCH VON US-KONZERNEN

Trump hat verschiedene Möglichkeiten zum Ausstieg aus dem Abkommen, was sich bis zum Jahr 2020 hinziehen könnte. Aber bereits jetzt hat der Präsident per Dekret Klimaschutz-Entscheidugen seines Vorgänger Barack Obama aufgehoben, so dass die Zusagen für den Weltklimavertrag ohnehin kaum noch einzuhalten wären.

Die USA haben sich so nicht nur weltweit isoliert. Auch innerhalb des Landes stößt Trump auf Widerstand. Zahlreiche Unternehmen haben an den Präsidenten appelliert, den Vertrag nicht aufzukündigen. Darunter sind Konzerne wie Apple, aber auch Industrieriesen wie Dow Chemical und Exxon. Tesla-Chef Elon Musk kündigte an, sollten die USA den Klimavertrag verlassen, werde er seine Funktion als Berater Trumps aufgeben. Zahlreiche Bundesstaaten wie Kalifornien bekennen sich zudem zum Kampf gegen den Klimawandel und machen eigene Vorgaben.

Die deutsche Industrie befürchtet so allerdings wachsende rechtliche Unsicherheiten in dem wichtigen Exportland. Während die Regierung in Washington die Regeln beim Ausstoß von Kohlendioxid lockern wolle, gebe es strengere Vorschriften in sieben anderen Bundesstaaten, sagte der Präsident des Automobilverbandes VDA, Matthias Wissmann. "Für jemanden, der für den US-Markt produziert, ist es ein ziemliches Problem, wenn es unterschiedliche Rechtsvorschriften gibt."

RPT-Exxon vote shows Wall St diverging from Trump on climate change - 路透新闻

{{20170601T110002.856+0000}}RPT-Exxon vote shows Wall St diverging from Trump on climate change(Repeats story published Wednesday with no changes)

By Ross Kerber

BOSTON, June 1 (Reuters) - Major investors put U.S. industry on notice on Wednesday that climate change matters, even as reports emerged that President Donald Trump plans to withdraw the United States from an international pact to fight global warming.

A number of large institutional fund firms including BlackRock Inc, the world's largest asset manager, supported a shareholder resolution calling on Exxon Mobil Corp to share more information about how new technologies and climate change regulations could impact the business of the world's largest publicly traded oil company. The proposal won the support of 62.3 percent of votes cast. [nL1N1IX15V]

The victory, on such a wide margin, was hailed by climate activists as a turning point in their decades-long campaign to get oil and gas companies to communicate how they would adapt to a low-carbon economy.

With major investors now seeing climate change as a major risk, activists said U.S. corporations will have to be more transparent about the impact of a warming planet even if the United States withdraws from the 2015 Paris climate accord, as Trump promised during his presidential campaign.[nL1N1IX0K6]

"Economic forces are outrunning any other considerations," said Anne Simpson, investment director for sustainability at the California Public Employees' Retirement System, one of the sponsors of the resolution.

She credited big investors in Exxon for the change, since at least some of them switched their votes after last year when a similar measure won just 38 percent support.

"We have seen a sea change in their viewpoint," she said. Many top investors now consider their votes on shareholder proposals "on merit, rather than considering it a test of loyalty to management," she said.

Among Exxon's top investors, Vanguard Group Inc and BlackRock Inc opposed last year's call for climate change reporting. A spokeswoman for Vanguard, which has about 7 percent of Exxon's shares, declined to comment on its voting this year.

A person familiar with the matter said funds run by BlackRock, which holds about 6 percent of Exxon shares, voted in favor of the climate resolution.

Filings showing their exact votes are not due for months. But both fund firms and others have taken steps since last year to make it easier to support climate resolutions.

A spokesman for Exxon's ninth-largest investor Northern Trust Corp , Doug Holt, said it voted in favor of the proposal, citing its own guidelines updated in 2016.

THE VOTE FROM THE STREET

The investment firms' approach reflects a new interest in climate matters among their own investors, who have stuffed money into so-called "green" mutual funds and other vehicles that use environmental factors in their stockpicking.[nL1N1IT0EG]

Wall Street's priorities have shifted the terms of debate at a number of other energy and utility companies. A majority of shareholders voting at Occidental Petroleum Corp and PPL Corp called for similar reports on the risks of climate change. Votes on two more of the measures are scheduled for June 7 at Devon Energy Corp and at Hess Corp . [nL1N1IR1BA] [nL1N1IE20Q]

Michael Crosby, involved in corporate outreach for the Midwest Capuchin Franciscans, a religious order, said Wednesday's vote was a rejection of Exxon's arguments it already provides enough detail on its outlook.

"The Street is saying, you have to give better evidence," Crosby said.

After the measure passed, Exxon Chief Executive Officer Darren Woods said its board would reconsider its climate communications.

The activists now face the task of maintaining alliances with leaders like Woods who opposed their resolutions but who in some cases support the 195-nation Paris agreement. Exxon said in a March 22 letter to the White House that the Paris deal is "an effective framework for addressing the risks of climate change."

Trump had at least one ally at Exxon's meeting in Dallas, Steven Milloy of Potomac, Maryland, who urged other investors to support his resolution that would make it harder to file proposals like the one on climate change. Milloy said management should show less concerns for climate issues, which he called misplaced, and cited Trump as a model. "For the first time we have a president who actively opposes climate hysteria," Milloy said.

According to Exxon, Milloy's proposal received support from 1.6 percent of votes cast.

PRESS DIGEST- New York Times business news - June 1 - 路透新闻

{{20170601T050741.802+0000}}PRESS DIGEST- New York Times business news - June 1June 1 (Reuters) - The following are the top stories on the New York Times business pages. Reuters has not verified these stories and does not vouch for their accuracy.

- Uber said that it lost $708 million over the first three months of the year on revenue of $3.4 billion. That is a narrowing of the previous quarter's loss of $991 million, on revenue of $2.9 billion. Uber said it was still sitting on $7.2 billion in cash, about the same amount it held at the end of 2016. http://nyti.ms/2rdnS86

- Express Scripts , the nation's largest pharmacy benefits manager, is suing Kaléo, the manufacturer of Evzio. Express Scripts claims it is owed more than $14.5 million in fees and rebates related to Evzio, and it has dropped the drug from its preferred list. http://nyti.ms/2rdnd6A

- In a reversal, a majority of Exxon Mobil's shareholders, have voted in favor of more open and detailed analyses of the risks posed to its business by policies aimed at stemming climate change. Those policies include the goal of the Paris climate agreement to restrict global temperatures to no more than 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels. http://nyti.ms/2rdwdsx

- Trump is expected to withdraw the United States from the 2015 climate change accord that committed nearly every nation to take action to curb the warming of the planet. Trump said on Twitter that he had made his decision and would announce it in the Rose Garden on Thursday afternoon. http://nyti.ms/2rdAFYe

WDHLG-TOP-THEMA-EU will US-Ausstieg aus Klimavertrag nicht einfach hinnehmen - 路透新闻

{{20170601T041624.120+0000}}WDHLG-TOP-THEMA-EU will US-Ausstieg aus Klimavertrag nicht einfach hinnehmen(Wiederholung vom Vorabend)

* Juncker: Pflicht zu sagen: So geht das nicht

* Bericht: Beratungen über konkrete Umsetzung laufen

* Bundesregierung: Haben keine Kenntnis von Trumps Entscheidung

* Trump: Gebe Entscheidung in nächsten Tagen bekannt

- von Valerie Volcovici und Markus Wacket

Washington/Berlin, 31. Mai (Reuters) - Die Europäische Union will die drohende Abkehr der USA aus dem Pariser Klimavertrag nicht einfach akzeptieren. "Es ist die Pflicht Europas zu sagen: So geht das nicht", sagte EU-Kommissionspräsident Jean-Claude Juncker in Berlin. Es werde Jahre dauern, bis die USA aus ihren Verpflichtungen herauskämen. US-Präsident Donald Trump will einem Insider zufolge aus dem Klimaabkommen aussteigen und wendet sich damit in einem wichtigen Punkt von der Weltgemeinschaft ab. Die Entscheidung sei gefallen, sagte eine mit dem Beschluss vertraute Person am Mittwoch der Nachrichtenagentur Reuters.

Mehrere US-Medien wie der Sender Fox News berichteten dies ebenfalls. Trump selbst erklärte, er werde sich in den kommenden Tagen äußern. Die USA als zweitgrößter Treibhausgasproduzent nach China wären damit neben Syrien und Nicaragua das einzige Land außerhalb des Abkommens von 2015. Dahinter stehen rund 200 Staaten. Ziel ist es, die Erderwärmung auf deutlich unter zwei Grad gegenüber der vorindustriellen Zeit zu begrenzen. Der Klimaschutz soll auch Teil des Beschlusses der 20 einflussreichsten Staaten der Welt (G20) werden, die sich im Juli in Hamburg treffen.

Trump hatte den Klimawandel im Wahlkampf als Erfindung der Chinesen bezeichnet, die nur der US-Wirtschaft schaden wollten. Er stellte deswegen den Austritt aus dem Abkommen in Aussicht. Nach seinem Regierungsantritt legte er sich jedoch nicht mehr öffentlich fest.

Die EU und Deutschland versuchten noch auf verschiedenen diplomatischen Kanälen, Trump von einem Austritt abzuhalten. Einen Plan B für einen Klimavertrag ohne die USA gebe es nicht, sagte der stellvertretende Präsident der EU-Kommission, Maros Sefcovic. "Als ich selbst im Weißen Haus war, habe ich erklärt, dass es keinen Plan B gibt, denn es gibt keinen Planeten B." Die EU sei aber für eine Führungsrolle in Klimafragen bereit, wenn die USA nun ausfalle. "Wenn sie sich entscheiden auszusteigen, wäre das enttäuschend. Aber ich glaube nicht, dass dies den Lauf der Geschichte ändern wird." Auch die Bundesregierung arbeitete daran, dass ein Ausstieg der USA keinen Dominoeffekt auslöst. Wichtige Staaten wie China und Indien haben bekräftigt, sie würden zum Vertrag stehen. Die Bundesregierung selbst erklärte, sie kenne keinen Beschluss Trumps. SPD-Kanzlerkandidat Martin Schulz warnte vor erheblichen Wettbewerbsnachteilen für die europäischen Unternehmen, sollten die USA aus dem Abkommen aussteigen.[nL8N1IX6FG] Ein Sprecher des französischen Präsidenten Emmanuel Macron sagte, Frankreich werde "pro-aktiv" darauf hinwirken, dass das Klimaabkommen umgesetzt werde.

JUNCKER - HERR TRUMP KENNT DIE DETAILS NICHT

"Die Amerikaner können gar nicht aus diesem Klimaschutzabkommen aussteigen", sagte Juncker in Berlin. "Herr Trump glaubt das, weil er die Details nicht kennt."

Das Internetportal Axios berichtete, zurzeit liefen in der US-Regierung die Beratungen darüber, auf welchem Weg das Abkommen verlassen werde solle. Damit befasse sich eine kleine Gruppe um den Chef der Umweltbehörde EPA, Scott Pruitt. Sie müsse entscheiden, ob die USA die Vereinbarung von Paris kündigen werde. Damit könnte der Austritt frühestens 2020 wirksam werden. Alternativ ist auch ein Ausstieg aus der UN-Konvention zum Klimawandel möglich, die dem Abkommen zugrunde liegt. Damit wären die USA in etwa einem Jahr nicht mehr Teil des Vertrages. Dies wäre aber ein noch gravierenderer Schnitt, da die USA dann an Konferenzen rund um Klima- und Umweltthemen nicht einmal am Rande teilnehmen könnten.

Die unmittelbaren Auswirkungen eines Austritts sind nach Einschätzung aus deutschen Regierungskreisen zunächst beschränkt. Allerdings haben die Staaten in Paris vereinbart, dass sie sich 2020 ehrgeizigere Vorgaben zur Verringerung der Klimagase setzen wollen, damit das Zwei-Grad-Ziel bis Ende des Jahrhunderts erreicht werden kann. Die USA würden hier ausfallen. Zudem könnte dies bewirken, dass weitere Staaten bei ihren Zielen zurückhaltender werden.

G20-TREFFEN IN HAMBURG UNTER NOCH SCHWIERIGEREN VORZEICHEN

Kanzlerin Angela Merkel droht nun ein schwieriges Treffen beim G20-Gipfel unter deutscher Führung. Schon in der vergangenen Woche zeigte der G7-Gipfel in Italien ein Zerwürfnis zwischen den USA und den übrigen Teilnehmern. In der Frage des freien Welthandels, aber vor allem beim Klimaschutz waren die USA isoliert. Merkel kritisierte am Wochenende mit Blick auf den Weltklimavertrag: "Dieses Pariser Abkommen ist ja nicht irgendein Abkommen, sondern es ist schon ein zentrales Abkommen zur Gestaltung der Globalisierung". Zurück in Deutschland forderte Merkel angesichts der Konflikte eine größere Eigenständigkeit der Europäer.[nL8N1IU0GJ]

Das Ringen um den Klimaschutz hat gravierende Auswirkungen auf die Wirtschaft. Staaten fürchten, dass ihr Engagement Nachteile im Wettbewerb mit Ländern mit laxeren Klimavorgaben bringen könnte. Vor allem das Ja sowohl von den USA und dem Rivalen China zum Pariser Vertrag löste damals bei Klimaschützern Optimismus aus. Die Chefs großer Konzerne wie ExxonMobil, Dow Chemical und Tesla appellierten an Trump, an dem Klimaabkommen festzuhalten. Tesla-Chef Elon Musk drohte damit, aus einem Beratergremium des US-Präsidialamtes auszuscheiden, sollte Trump aus dem Vertrag aussteigen.

UPDATE 9-Trump to announce decision on global climate deal on Thursday - 路透新闻

{{20170601T014821.348+0000}}UPDATE 9-Trump to announce decision on global climate deal on Thursday* Trump says he is listening to people on both sides

* Pullout would make U.S. only third nation not in pact

* Democrat Clinton, Republican Romney oppose pullout

* Leaving the deal would take the U.S. years, Juncker says

(Updates with Trump tweet on timing of announcement)

By Valerie Volcovici and Jeff Mason

WASHINGTON, May 31 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump said he would announce on Thursday his decision whether to keep the United States in a global pact to fight climate change, as a source close to the matter said he was preparing to pull out of the Paris accord.

Trump said he would make the announcement at 3 p.m. EDT (1900 GMT) in the White House Rose Garden, ending his tweet with "MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!"

During his 2016 presidential campaign, Trump blasted the accord, and called global warming a hoax aimed at weakening U.S. industry.

The Republican vowed at the time to "cancel" the Paris deal within 100 days of becoming president on Jan. 20, part of an effort to bolster U.S. oil and coal industries.

A U.S. withdrawal could deepen a rift with U.S. allies. The United States would join Syria and Nicaragua as the world's only non-participants in the landmark 195-nation accord agreed upon in Paris in 2015.

Trump came under pressure on Wednesday from corporate CEOs, U.S. allies, Democrats and some fellow Republicans to keep the United States in the accord.

Responding to shouted questions earlier on Wednesday from reporters in the White House Oval Office where he met with Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc, Trump said: "I'm hearing from a lot of people, both ways."

The source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Trump was working out terms of the planned withdrawal with U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt, an oil industry ally and climate change doubter.

The pact was the first legally binding global deal to fight climate change. Virtually every nation voluntarily committed to steps aimed at curbing global emissions of "greenhouse" gases. These include carbon dioxide generated from burning of fossil fuels that scientists blame for a warming planet, sea level rise, droughts and more frequent violent storms.

The United States committed to reduce its emissions by 26 percent to 28 percent from 2005 levels by 2025.

Advocates of the climate deal pressured Trump, who has changed his mind on large decisions before even after signaling a move in the opposite direction.

The chief executives of dozens of companies have made last-minute appeals to Trump. The CEOs of ExxonMobil Corp , Apple Inc , Dow Chemical Co , Unilever NV and Tesla Inc were among those urging him to remain in the agreement. Tesla's Elon Musk threatened to quit White House advisory councils if the president pulls out.

Musk said: "I've done all I can to advise directly" to Trump and through others in the White House.

Robert Murray, CEO of Murray Energy Corp [MUYEY.UL], an Ohio-based coal company and major Trump campaign donor, urged Trump to withdraw from the deal. But on Wednesday, U.S. coal company shares fell alongside renewable energy stocks following reports that Trump would pull out. [nL1N1IX0YV]

Pulling the United States from the accord could further alienate American allies in Europe already wary of Trump and call into question U.S. leadership and trustworthiness on one of the world's leading issues. It also would be one more step by the Republican president to erase the legacy of his predecessor, Democrat Barack Obama, who helped broker the accord and praised it during a trip to Europe this month.

BROAD IMPLICATIONS

A U.S. pullout could have sweeping implications. The deal relies heavily on reductions in emissions by big polluter nations, and the United States is the world's second-biggest carbon dioxide emitter behind China.

At a conference near Los Angeles, Democrat Hillary Clinton, who Trump defeated in the 2016 presidential election, said withdrawing would be a mistake. "Part of what keeps us going is that America's word is good, and that you stand with your prior administration whether it was of your party or not," she said.

Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee who Trump considered for secretary of state, said on Twitter that affirmation of the Paris agreement "is not only about the climate: It is also about America remaining the global leader."

Democratic U.S. Senators Bob Menendez and Jack Reed wrote a letter urging Trump not to withdraw. They said withdrawal would undermine U.S. credibility and its position as a global leader, empowering nations like China to drive the climate agenda and set international standards while also reaping economic benefits from a growing clean energy sector.

U.S. allies rallied behind the Paris accord on Wednesday. [nL8N1IX4C8]

In Berlin, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker stressed withdrawal would take years, saying: "The Americans can't just leave the climate protection agreement. Mr. Trump believes that because he doesn't know the details." [nL8N1IX5X6]

China and the European Union will seek on Friday to buttress the agreement. In a statement backed by all 28 EU states, the European Union and China will commit to full implementation of the accord, EU and Chinese officials said. [nL8N1IX5CW]

Trump has said the accord would cost the U.S. economy trillions of dollars without tangible benefit. For the president, a withdrawal would reflect his "America First" approach to policy, unencumbered by international obligations.

Trump refused to endorse the accord at a summit of the G7 group of wealthy nations on Saturday in Italy, saying he needed more time to decide. [nL8N1IT044]

Acionistas da Exxon aprovam medida para maior transparência sobre impactos climáticos - 路透新闻

{{20170531T235154.364+0000}}Acionistas da Exxon aprovam medida para maior transparência sobre impactos climáticosDALLAS, 31 Mai (Reuters) - O presidente-executivo da Exxon Mobil disse nesta quarta-feira que a companhia vai reconsiderar a maneira como comunica os riscos enfrentados por mudanças climáticas, após acionistas terem aprovado uma medida pedindo por mais transparência.

Uma proposta não-vinculativa foi aprovada por 62 por cento dos votos, em uma rara derrota para a administração da Exxon, a qual havia feito recomendação contra a medida.

A companhia argumentou que já fornece informações suficientes sobre o potencial impacto de mudanças tecnológicas e da demanda de energia sobre seu portfólio de ativos.

Os resultados devem refletir como grandes acionistas votam medidas do tipo, após a mesma proposta, no ano passado, ter recebido apoio de apenas 38,1 por cento.

A proposta pediu para que a Exxon os riscos que seu negócio pode enfrentar frente a mudanças tecnológicas e de políticas de mudanças climáticas -- tais como o acordo de 2015 que busca manter o aumento médio na temperatura global abaixo de 2 graus Celsius.

Exxon Baton Rouge refinery completes coker overhaul -sources - 路透新闻

{{20170531T234939.512+0000}}Exxon Baton Rouge refinery completes coker overhaul -sourcesHOUSTON, May 31 (Reuters) - ExxonMobil Corp completed the overhaul of a coking unit late last week at its 502,500-barrel-per-day (bpd) Baton Rouge, Louisiana, refinery, sources familiar with plant operations said on Wednesday.

The 32,000-bpd West Coker was shut in mid-April for the planned overhaul. A coker increases the amount of refinable material taken from a barrel of crude and converts residual crude oil into petroleum coke, a coal substitute.

UPDATE 3-Exxon shareholders approve climate impact report in win for activists - 路透新闻

DALLAS, May 31 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp's chief executive said on Wednesday the company would reconsider how it communicates the risks its faces from climate change after shareholders approved a measure calling for increased transparency.

The non-binding proposal passed with 62 percent of ballots cast in a rare defeat for Exxon's management, which had recommended a vote against the measure. The company argued that it already provides sufficient information on the potential impact of changing technologies and energy demand on its asset portfolio.

The results likely reflected a shift in how big shareholders voted on the measure, as the same proposal last year received only 38.1 percent of shares voted.

Asset manager BlackRock Inc backed the proposal, according to a source familiar with the matter. BlackRock holds about 6 percent of Exxon shares.

Among other top Exxon shareholders, spokespeople for State Street Corp and Vanguard Group declined to comment on the vote on Wednesday. "It's a powerful message," New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli said in an interview. A New York state public employee pension fund he oversees was one of the proposal's sponsors. "They recognized the global community is staying committed to Paris," he said, referring to the Paris global climate accord. The proposal asked for Exxon to report on risks its business could face from technology changes and from climate change policies such as the 2015 accord aiming to keep average global temperature increases below 2 degrees Celsius.

In remarks following the shareholder meeting, Exxon Chief Executive Darren Woods said the board would reconsider its climate change-related communications but did not commit to producing the report requested in the proposal.

He also said board directors would review a policy designed to bar them from meeting individually with big shareholders, a practice criticized by the climate proposal sponsors.

"We take the vote seriously will respond to that feedback and look for opportunities" to communicate, Woods said. "That issue along with others is part of dialogue we have with the board."

Exxon still faces probes by Massachusetts and New York Attorneys General into whether it misled the public and investors by soft-pedaling climate change risks. Exxon has said suits are politically motivated and intended to force it and others to change their positions on climate change.

Protesters, some in skeleton costumes, held up signs saying "Exxon Lied" across the street from Wednesday's annual meeting.

Approval of Exxon's executive pay meanwhile received 68 percent of ballots cast, down from 89 percent a year ago. Proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services had recommended shareholders reject the executive pay plan. [nL4N1IL1K7]

A proposal calling for a report on Exxon's efforts to reduce emissions of methane, another greenhouse gas, in its operations received support of nearly 39 percent of ballots cast.

Another proposal calling on the company to increase shareholder payouts in light of climate change-related risks was approved by less than 4 percent of ballots cast. Exxon had opposed both proposals.

Earlier, Exxon's Woods had said the company supported the goals of many of the proposals, but disagreed with the methods.
