{{20170331T124934.696+0000}}BUZZ-Exxon issues another new Qua Iboe plan due to loading delaysLONDON, March 31 (Reuters) - ** ExxonMobil has issued what is at least its fourth revised loading programme for Qua Iboe crude oil, Nigeria's largest export stream, after further loading delays, traders said on Friday.

** Cargoes from the March, April and May programmes are delayed by up to four weeks, pushing two of the May cargoes into June, according to a revised programme seen by Reuters.

** There are now 9 cargoes, for a total of 285,000 barrels per day (bpd) set to load in April, some of which were originally scheduled to load in the middle of March. There are 8 cargoes set to load in May with 245,000 bpd.

** Persistent loading delays have forced field operator ExxonMobil to revise the loading plan several times in what traders said was an unusual amount of changes for a grade not under force majeure. [nL5N1FL5VW][L5N1GG4JK]

** The issues have made buyers more reluctant to purchase Qua Iboe cargoes. Traders said Exxon is dealing with pumping issues and metering issues on the export pipeline. Exxon does not comment on its operations.

RPT-North Dakota oil output set to rise as controversial pipeline opens - 路透新闻

{{20170330T110001.841+0000}}RPT-North Dakota oil output set to rise as controversial pipeline opensBy Ernest Scheyder

HOUSTON, March 30 (Reuters) - North Dakota oil production will get a shot in the arm next month as a pipeline comes online despite opposition by environmental groups and Native Americans, allowing the energy industry to save at least $540 million in annual shipping costs.

The Dakota Access Pipeline gives the state's producers cheaper access to refineries and other customers on the U.S. Gulf Coast.

Market players said they expect this will hasten a revival of output from the Bakken region which fell sharply along with global oil prices during the past two years. [nL1N1FS1QC]

"We're back to growth in the Bakken," Hess Corp Chief Executive Officer John Hess said in a recent interview. The New York-based company has contracts to send roughly half its daily North Dakota output through DAPL. For 2017, Hess has said its Bakken production could grow more than 10 percent.

President Donald Trump approved the $3.7 billion pipeline in February, reversing the prior administration which had blocked it last December with a decision by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.

Energy Transfer Partners LP , which operates the 1,100 mile (1,770 km) long DAPL, has begun filling the line with crude and could reach full operating capacity by late April, based on industry estimates.

DAPL "will provide a safer, more environmentally responsible and more cost-effective transportation system to move crude across this country as opposed to truck or rail," said ETP spokeswoman Vicki Granado.

The pipeline will carry about 500,000 barrels of oil per day, more than half of North Dakota's daily output, cutting reliance on riskier rail-cars and reducing transport cost by roughly $3 to $5 per barrel, analysts estimate.

That should help level the playing field between Bakken producers and rivals in other U.S. shale plays, many of which are closer to refineries and other customers.

"Economics for drilling in the Bakken will look better because of DAPL," Rusty Braziel of RBN Energy consultants in Houston, said in an interview.

The state's drilling rig count has jumped 40 percent since early February, when Trump gave final approval to the pipeline. By the end of the year, analysts expect the rig count to rise another 10 percent or more.

DAPL's opponents say they will continue to oppose the line and oil production across North Dakota, which pumps more crude each day than any state but Texas.

"Just because oil flow is pending does not mean that it cannot be stopped by court order, and we have a strong, ongoing case in front of the courts," said David Archambault II, chairman of North Dakota's Standing Rock Sioux tribe, which lives adjacent to the line.

OUTLOOK

Transportation savings from DAPL are a key factor oil companies are considering when deciding whether to boost production, executives, analysts and investors said.

Hess plans to triple the number of drilling rigs it operates in North Dakota this year. The company will move the 30 percent of its existing Bakken production from rail to pipeline once DAPL opens. [nL1N1FF0TN]

Oasis Petroleum Inc , another large Bakken producer, said its 2017 output could rise more than 30 percent. DAPL "is definitely going to give us more options to get our product to market," Oasis Chief Executive Officer Tommy Nusz said in an interview.

Whiting Petroleum Corp , the state's largest oil producer, does not contract for space on DAPL, nor does Continental Resources Inc , the second-largest.[nL2N1C32I7]

But Continental expects DAPL to ease a transport bottleneck out of the state and open room on other pipelines, allowing it to stop using rail.

Both Whiting and Continental have projected production to rise more than 20 percent this year. The companies did not respond to requests for comment.

North Dakota's oil production fell 13 percent in the last 12 months for which data are available to about 980,000 barrels per day (bpd) due to low prices. While the expected jump in 2017 output likely won't return output to its 2015 peak, it could help statewide production again rise above 1 million barrels per day.

Another reason for rising production is that higher prices have prompted many companies to hedge, or sell forward, some of their output, which bolsters confidence. Whiting and Oasis, for example, have hedged more than half of 2017 production.

But the state's producers say that DAPL's opening, after months of uncertainty, gives them confidence they can ship their product to market.

"We have to have a more pragmatic approach to infrastructure development in this country," said Hess.

Texas judge kicks Exxon climate lawsuit to New York court  - Reuters News

{{20170330T032056.235+0000}}Texas judge kicks Exxon climate lawsuit to New York court HOUSTON, March 29 (Reuters) - A federal judge in Texas on Wednesday kicked an Exxon Mobil Corp lawsuit seeking to thwart two states from pursuing a fraud case over climate change to a Manhattan court, saying his court wasn't the best place to resolve the dispute.

A group of state attorneys general, led by New York's Eric Schneiderman, brought a securities fraud suit against the world's largest publicly traded oil company in 2015 claiming it misled investors by soft-pedaling the dangers of climate change.

Exxon criticized their case as intended to get the company and others in the oil and gas industry to change their positions on climate change. It responded with its own suit in U.S. District Court in Dallas.

That suit argued the states conspired with climate activists to target Exxon and the states' demands for documents dating back 40 years violated its rights to protection against unreasonable searches and were abusive.

U.S. District Judge Ed Kinkeade, who earlier sought to question Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey over Exxon's claims the original fraud lawsuit was biased, ruled in favor of Healey and her New York counterpart. He wrote his court was not the proper venue because events at issue in the case took place in New York.

But the judge's decision questioned whether the two AGs "are trying to hide something," citing an agreement with climate activists not to publicly discuss their contacts. He also said the agreement should be open to discovery by Exxon attorneys.

Exxon had argued that the requests for documents were, as the judge summarized it, tools to cultivate the political goals of Healey and New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman.

Despite having the case transferred to Manhattan, an Exxon spokesman said the company was gratified the judge agreed its "claims involve important issues," adding: "We look forward to continuing the case in that court."

Healey also lauded the decision to move the case, saying "we will continue to argue that this frivolous lawsuit should be dismissed."

Amy Spitalnick, a spokeswoman for Schneiderman, said in a statement that the judge's remarks in the ruling were "riddled with factual errors and oil industry spin," and said Exxon was free to make the same claims in New York but "so far, inexplicably have not done so."

The case is 4:16-cv-00469 in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas, Fort Worth division.

UPDATE 1-Eni CEO says Mexico oil find likely bigger than estimates - 路透新闻

{{20170329T140321.520+0000}}UPDATE 1-Eni CEO says Mexico oil find likely bigger than estimates(Recasts lead, adds CEO comments, background)

By Stephen Jewkes

RAVENNA, Italy, March 29 (Reuters) - Italy's Eni said on Wednesday it expected that its recent discovery off the coast of Mexico would hold more than the 800 million barrels of oil it originally estimated.

"This is an important find and we've found new layers of good light oil that make us think there's more," Chief Executive Claudio Descalzi said at an oil and gas conference.

Eni said earlier this month it had found "meaningful" reserves of oil off the coast of Mexico after becoming the first international oil company to drill a well in the country after a 2013 reform opening up the sector to investors.

State-controlled Eni, which in recent years has made major gas finds in Mozambique and Egypt, holds one of the best discovery track records in the industry.

Its organic reserve replacement ratio -- a measure of its ability to find hydrocarbons -- stood at 193 percent in 2016 compared to a 35 percent peer average.

"Eni's Zohr discovery is a game changer," Egypt's oil minister Tarek El Molla said on Wednesday, referring to Eni's discovery in Egyptian waters of the biggest gas field ever found in the Mediterranean.

Descalzi said Eni would follow the same strategy in Mexico as it had adopted in Egypt, using infrastructure already in place to help speed up time to market.

He said the discovery, some 6-7 km from the coast, was close to installations owned by Mexico's state-owned oil company Pemex. He added he would speak to Pemex in coming months to discuss using some of their infrastructure in the area.

Royal Dutch Shell , Chevron and Exxon Mobil have recently signaled the oil industry's return to Mexico's deep waters with high bids in a government auction.

Since taking over as Eni CEO in 2014, oil veteran Descalzi has streamlined the company, focusing attention on the upstream job of finding oil and gas.

Asked about the group's retail gas and power business which serves 11 million clients, he said a decision would be taken this year on whether or not to sell all or part of it. "There is a lot of interest from industrial players and funds," he said.

Descalzi, former head of Eni's upstream activity, is set to be re-appointed CEO of Eni in April for a second three-year mandate.

UPDATE 1-As oil output grows, BP keeps refining stable, expands retail - 路透新闻

{{20170329T134256.584+0000}}UPDATE 1-As oil output grows, BP keeps refining stable, expands retail* BP plans to sell "one or two" plants

* Unlikely to invest in new refineries

* Targets $3 bln boost to free cashflow by 2021

(Adds comments on trading operations)

By Ron Bousso and Dmitry Zhdannikov

LONDON, March 29 (Reuters) - BP has no plan to build new refineries despite growing oil production and will focus on modernising existing plants while expanding its network of filling stations to generate $3 billion in additional cash.

The group's head of refining told Reuters that even though BP's output was set to spike as new fields become operational, its attitude to refining remains more cautious.

"Are we going to invest in more greenfield refining in BP? Probably not," said Tufan Erginbilgic, who has worked in refining since 1990.

He said BP was happy with its refining portfolio although it could sell some assets in downstream - which combines refineries with chemicals plants and infrastructure such as storage.

Refining of crude oil into fuels such as gasoline, diesel and jet fuel has for years been the industry's problem child, having to grapple with weak and volatile profit margins as well as competition from modern refineries built in China, India and the Middle East.

The problems are compounded by the prospect of more energy-efficient cars, aircraft and heating, tighter marine fuel standards, the rise of electric vehicles and slowing consumption growth.

A push to modernise and streamline BP's refining, trading and marketing - known as downstream activities - generated $5.6 billion in free cashflow last year, up 25 percent from 2014 despite refining margins at 12-year lows, Erginbilgic said.

Erginbilgic, who became downstream chief in 2014, said he is aiming for a $3 billion increase in free cashflow by 2021.

"We will sell one or two assets, making very good money today because the tide went up for these assets," he told Reuters.

SMALLER PORTFOLIO

Refining proved to be extremely valuable for integrated oil companies, offsetting much of the losses from production operations during the two-year tumble in oil prices that started in 2014.

Erginbilgic says BP's investment decisions are driven by an expected global push towards greater energy efficiency and its belief that demand growth will slow in the next 20 years to reach about 112 million barrels per day (bpd) from 96 million bpd today.

Overcapacity and weak demand growth will probably prompt more refiners to close plants in Europe, he said. In the United States, refineries will benefit from rising production and booming exports to growing Asian markets.

Last year BP and Russia's top oil company, Rosneft , dissolved a refining joint venture in Germany. In the United States, BP invested billions of dollars in modernising its Whiting refinery near Chicago, originally built in 1889 by John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil Company.

BP is by no means the only oil major embracing a strategy rethink to adapt to evolving markets. Rivals including Shell and France's Total have undergone deep portfolio reviews in recent years, selling and closing many operations.

BP was forced to start asset sales long before the oil price collapsed, in part to raise money for litigation costs relating to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill.

The company has sold or converted 16 plants since 2000 and today operates or has a stake in 11 refineries and 17 petrochemicals plants.

It is seeking to sell its 50 percent stake in Chinese petrochemicals joint venture SECCO, its largest investment in China, Reuters reported last year.[nL4N1AQ1V0]

POCKETS OF GROWTH

Though Shell and trading company Vitol, among others, expect gasoline and diesel demand to peak between 2020 and 2030, some refining segments still represent solid growth stories, Erginbilgic says.

Petrochemicals will not suffer any significant slowdown because energy efficiency doesn't reduce demand for plastics, particularly in Asia, he said.

BP's trading operations are expected to benefit from growing global crude trade on the back of abundant U.S., Canadian and Brazilian production and rising energy demand in Asia, he added.[nL5N1H44ZF]

BP is also betting on expanding its network of petrol stations with high-end convenience stores at a time other majors, including Shell and Exxon Mobil , have been shrinking their vast but often basic networks.

In Britain, BP operates its chain with retailer Marks & Spencer . In Germany, it teamed up with REWE.

Late last year it agreed to buy a chain of stations from Australia's top grocer Woolworths for $1.3 billion and Erginbilgic said BP's model could be expanded to markets such as Mexico, Indonesia, China and India. [nL4N1EM3DB]

Erginbilgic said the marketing business, which also includes lubricants, can deliver an extra $2 billion in cashflow by 2021, twice as much as refining and petrochemicals.

UPDATE 1-Exxon to sell its Norway-operated oilfields - Reuters News

{{20170329T125127.150+0000}}UPDATE 1-Exxon to sell its Norway-operated oilfields(Adds quotes, price, detail)

OSLO, March 29 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil has agreed to sell its operated upstream business in Norway to private equity firm HitecVision and oil company Point Resources for an undisclosed sum, it said on Wednesday.

The deal means that the world's largest listed oil firm will no longer operate producing fields on the Norwegian continental shelf, making it the second oil major to scale back its presence in less than a year after BP in 2016.

Exxon Mobil retains stakes in more than 20 producing fields operated by Statoil and Shell however, including the Snorre oilfield and the major Ormen Lange gas field.

The sale of stakes in the Jotun, Balder and Ringhorne fields, along with some related production assets and properties, had long been rumoured in local media.

"It's a natural part of business to assess whether such assets could be worth more to others than they are to us. We'll remain a significant investor in Norway however," Exxon spokesman Tore Revaa said.

The fields sold had daily output of 54,000 barrels of oil equivalents in 2016, while Exxon's remaining Norwegian stakes yielded about 170,000 barrels per day.

Norwegian financial daily Dagens Naeringsliv, citing unnamed sources, said the deal was valued at close to 8 billion Norwegian crowns ($935 million). The companies declined to comment when contacted by Reuters.

Point Resources, which is majority owned by HitecVision, will have output of about 60,000 barrels of oil equivalent following the deal, which could grow to about 80,000 barrels in 2022, it said in a separate statement.

"Given the number of development plans and other opportunities, no redundancies are expected within the combined company as a result of the transaction," it added.

Following the deal, Point's reserves and contingent resources will amount to about 350 million barrels of oil equivalent.

The switch of ownership, which the companies hope to complete in the fourth quarter of 2017, must be approved by the Norwegian government.

Energy Minister Terje Soeviknes said in a statement the deal could bring more diversity and competition to the oil industry.

"The transaction ... is exciting because it makes Point a significant player while Exxon Mobil remains a large producer," he added.

BP last year sold all its Norwegian assets to oil firm Det Norske in exchange for cash and a 30 percent stake in the new company, named Aker BP .[nL8N1920ZT]

RPT-Troubled California oil refinery puts PBF's turnaround skills to the test - 路透新闻

{{20170329T110001.507+0000}}RPT-Troubled California oil refinery puts PBF's turnaround skills to the test(Repeats article published earlier, no changes)

By Liz Hampton

HOUSTON, March 29 (Reuters) - An aging California refinery is testing PBF Energy Inc's reputation as a turnaround whiz, with mounting production woes and costly repairs at the 88-year-old plant throwing a wrench into efforts to quickly revive profits.

The refinery, acquired from Exxon Mobil Corp for $537.5 million, has reported frequent breakdowns since the deal closed last July. On April 1, a regional air-quality regulator expects to consider the plant's frequent breakdowns and emissions, along with a plan to enhance safety with an expensive phase out of a chemical used in gasoline production.

PBF is spending $100 million this year to improve operations, and is budgeting another $50 million for upgrading its electric power to prevent outages. Phasing out the use of modified hydrofluoric acid at the plant presents a potentially larger bill that was not on the table when PBF bought the refinery last July.

This week, the company lowered its estimate of first-quarter crude throughput at Torrance by 16 percent. It has said the overhaul would allow the Torrance refinery to boost production and hit profitability goals. "These things will be fixed," PBF Chief Executive Tom Nimbley assured analysts on an earnings call last month.

The problems are weighing on earnings. Last year, the company missed its earnings goals due at least partly to outages at Torrance and at PBF's Delaware City, Del., refinery. It posted an operating loss of $61.7 million in the fourth quarter compared with earnings of $168 million a year earlier.

"We left $75 million on the table in the fourth quarter and more than $300 million in terms of lost profit opportunities for the year," Nimbley said, discussing fourth quarter results.

The push to phase out hydrofluoric acid, widely used in refining and semiconductor industries, came after a tank holding the chemical suffered a "near miss" from a 2015 explosion, according to a federal probe of the blast.

Hydrofluoric acid can form a toxic cloud at room temperature and exposure can cause severe health problems and lead to death. An estimated 330,000 people live or work near the refinery.

The South Coast Air Quality Management District may push to adopt a rule to phase out use of the acid by December. A study commissioned by the air regulator estimated switching to sulfuric acid would cost around $100 million for each of the refineries in the region that use it.

PBF said in a statement that figure was "exceptionally low," and called a switch to sulfuric acid for gasoline output cost-prohibitive. A company executive has said the switch could worsen the plant's emissions.

A refiner in Texas is building a similar unit for $300 million. [nWNAB09SRX]

"I see no way they could avoid doing the upgrade if they wanted to stay in the gasoline business," said Robert Campbell, an analyst at consultancy Energy Aspects.

Acquisitions made PBF the fourth largest independent refiner in the United States. It proved its skills by buying a Delaware City refinery, overhauling it and quickly cutting annual expenses by $200 million.

But the Torrance deal was troubled from the start. Closing was contingent on the plant running 15 days straight without a breakdown, but PBF went ahead despite an incident 10 days ahead of closing, saying it was not material and Exxon covered repair costs.

SULFUR EMISSIONS

Local residents are pressuring elected officials and PBF due to noticeable gas-flaring and emissions.

Last year, the facility released 487 tons of sulfur oxide, nearly 20 times greater than Valero Energy Corp, Southern California's second biggest polluter, which released just under 25 tons, according to figures from SCAQMD, which may be subject to revisions.

PBF disputes the regulator's figures. It said 16 tons of the sulfur releases were under its ownership. It expects that figure to decline to less than 4 tons if its requests for revisions are upheld.

"They will turn things around eventually," said a person familiar with the plant, adding: "It's going to take time."

Investors are not patient. In the last year, PBF's share price has slid 35.1 percent to $21.11 per share, more than peers Tesoro, which is down 9 percent, or Valero, which is up 1.6 percent over the same period.

Woodside CEO 'OK' with LNG buyers' club, hints at more flexibility - 路透新闻

{{20170329T101800.635+0000}}Woodside CEO 'OK' with LNG buyers' club, hints at more flexibility* Woodside's Coleman sees no threat from LNG alliance

* Buyers' club, flexible contracts could create more liquidity

* Buyers 2 yrs from more long-term contracts on megaprojects

By Farah Master

HONG KONG, March 29 (Reuters) - Australian energy major Woodside Petroleum on Wednesday hinted it may in future be willing to allow buyers of liquefied natural gas (LNG) more flexibility as part of long-term contracts, saying that in time this could help create a more liquid market.

Last week, the biggest buyers in the world's top three LNG consuming countries - Japan, South Korea and China - clubbed together to secure greater supply flexibility. [nL3N1H02FJ]

The move potentially shifts power to importers amid a growing surplus, adding pressure on producers like Woodside and peers Royal Dutch Shell , Chevron and Exxon Mobil to grant more flexible contracts.

Speaking as one of the first executives of a major LNG producer to address the buyers' alliance, Woodside's Chief Executive Peter Coleman said on Wednesday he did not see a threat from the new grouping.

"We are OK with it, we don't see a threat from it at all," he told Reuters in Hong Kong.

The main goal of the buyers' alliance - made up Japan's JERA, Korea Gas Corp (KOGAS) and China National Offshore Oil Corp (CNOOC) - is to rid themselves of long-term contracts that oblige them to take in a fixed amount of cargoes every month and which do not allow them to sell excess cargoes to third parties.

Coleman did not specifically say Woodside was willing to grant buyers more flexibility in future, but said that to "cooperate and move things around" was a sensible thing to do for the big LNG buyers.

"It actually helps create more liquidity in the market place, because you have a large volume of LNG moving through the three different market players," he said.

MORE TRADING, LESS MEGA-PROJECTS

The LNG industry is undergoing huge change as the biggest ever flood of new supply is hitting the market, with volumes coming mainly from Australia and the United States.

The oversupply resulted in a more than 70 percent fall in Asian spot LNG prices from their 2014 peaks to around $5.50 per million British thermal unites (mmBtu).

However, Woodside has come through the market rout in better shape than many rivals, with $2.7 billion in cash and undrawn debt, and sees itself well positioned. [nL4N1G662V]

Woodside operates large LNG export facilities like Pluto and the North West Shelf, and is a partner in the $34 billion Wheatstone project, scheduled to start up later this year. It also has plans for another project, Browse, but for which it has not yet made a final investment decision (FID). [nL4N1D00MR]

Still, while oversupply will likely trigger more trading in LNG as producers sell uncontracted cargoes, Coleman said it made it difficult to develop large new production projects.

"The challenge today is there is not a market you can go to and develop a mega project ... The mega projects - 15-20 million tonnes (annual capacity) - still require buyers in long-term contracts to finance," he said.

Thanks to high spot prices of up to $20 per mmBtu over past years, producers and buyers were keen to sign long-term contracts that guaranteed supplies at stable prices.

Now, with oil and gas prices much lower and abundant supplies, LNG importers are keener on freely trading LNG instead of entering fixed term deals.

"Buyers are still two years away from being able to take out (new) long-term contracts for big projects," Coleman said.

CORRECTED-INTERVIEW-As oil output grows, BP keeps refining stable, expands retail - 路透新闻

{{20170329T100747.263+0000}}CORRECTED-INTERVIEW-As oil output grows, BP keeps refining stable, expands retail(Corrects to show BP plans to sell refining assets, not refineries)

* BP plans to sell "one or two" plants

* Unlikely to invest in new refineries

* Targets $3 bln boost to free cashflow by 2021

By Ron Bousso and Dmitry Zhdannikov

LONDON, March 29 (Reuters) - BP has no plan to build new refineries despite growing oil production and will focus on modernising existing plants while expanding its network of filling stations to generate $3 billion in additional cash.

The group's head of refining told Reuters that even though BP's output was set to spike as new fields become operational, its attitude to refining remains more cautious.

"Are we going to invest in more greenfield refining in BP? Probably not," said Tufan Erginbilgic, who has worked in refining since 1990.

He said BP was happy with its refining portfolio although it could sell some assets in downstream - which combines refineries with chemicals plants and infrastructure such as storage.

Refining of crude oil into fuels such as gasoline, diesel and jet fuel has for years been the industry's problem child, having to grapple with weak and volatile profit margins as well as competition from modern refineries built in China, India and the Middle East.

The problems are compounded by the prospect of more energy-efficient cars, aircraft and heating, tighter marine fuel standards, the rise of electric vehicles and slowing consumption growth.

A push to modernise and streamline BP's refining, trading and marketing - known as downstream activities - generated $5.6 billion in free cashflow last year, up 25 percent from 2014 despite refining margins at 12-year lows, Erginbilgic said.

Erginbilgic, who became downstream chief in 2014, said he is aiming for a $3 billion increase in free cashflow by 2021.

"We will sell one or two assets, making very good money today because the tide went up for these assets," he told Reuters.

SMALLER PORTFOLIO

Refining proved to be extremely valuable for integrated oil companies, offsetting much of the losses from production operations during the two-year tumble in oil prices that started in 2014.

Erginbilgic says BP's investment decisions are driven by an expected global push towards greater energy efficiency and its belief that demand growth will slow in the next 20 years to reach about 112 million barrels per day (bpd) from 96 million bpd today.

Overcapacity and weak demand growth will probably prompt more refiners to close plants in Europe, he said. In the United States, refineries will benefit from rising production and booming exports to growing Asian markets.

Last year BP and Russia's top oil company, Rosneft , dissolved a refining joint venture in Germany. In the United States, BP invested billions of dollars in modernising its Whiting refinery near Chicago, originally built in 1889 by John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil Company.

BP is by no means the only oil major embracing a strategy rethink to adapt to evolving markets. Rivals including Shell and France's Total have undergone deep portfolio reviews in recent years, selling and closing many operations.

BP was forced to start asset sales long before the oil price collapsed, in part to raise money for litigation costs relating to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill.

The company has sold or converted 16 plants since 2000 and today operates or has a stake in 11 refineries and 17 petrochemicals plants.

It is seeking to sell its 50 percent stake in Chinese petrochemicals joint venture SECCO, its largest investment in China, Reuters reported last year.[nL4N1AQ1V0]

POCKETS OF GROWTH

Though Shell and trading company Vitol, among others, expect gasoline and diesel demand to peak between 2020 and 2030, some refining segments still represent solid growth stories, Erginbilgic says.

Petrochemicals will not suffer any significant slowdown because energy efficiency doesn't reduce demand for plastics, particularly in Asia, he said.

BP is also betting on expanding its network of petrol stations with high-end convenience stores at a time other majors, including Shell and Exxon Mobil , have been shrinking their vast but often basic networks.

In Britain, BP operates its chain with retailer Marks & Spencer . In Germany, it teamed up with REWE.

Late last year it agreed to buy a chain of stations from Australia's top grocer Woolworths for $1.3 billion and Erginbilgic said BP's model could be expanded to markets such as Mexico, Indonesia, China and India. [nL4N1EM3DB]

Erginbilgic said the marketing business, which also includes lubricants, can deliver an extra $2 billion in cashflow by 2021, twice as much as refining and petrochemicals.

By Richard Valdmanis

BOSTON, March 23 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump's White House has said his plans to slash environmental regulations will trigger a new energy boom and help the United States drill its way to independence from foreign oil.

But the top U.S. oil and gas companies have been telling their shareholders that regulations have little impact on their business, according to a Reuters review of U.S. securities filings from the top producers.

In annual reports to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, 13 of the 15 biggest U.S. oil and gas producers said that compliance with current regulations is not impacting their operations or their financial condition.

The other two made no comment about whether their businesses were materially affected by regulation, but reported spending on compliance with environmental regulations at less than 3 percent of revenue.

The dissonance raises questions about whether Trump's war on regulation can increase domestic oil and gas output, as he has promised, or boost profits and share prices of oil and gas companies, as some investors have hoped.

According to the SEC, a publicly traded company must deem a matter "material" and report it to the agency if there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable investor would consider it important.

"Materiality is a fairly low bar," said Cary Coglianese, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania who runs the university's research program on regulation. "Despite exaggerated claims, regulatory costs are usually a very small portion of many companies' cost of doing business."

The oil majors' annual filings come after the industry and its political allies have spent years criticizing the Obama administration for policies aimed at reducing fossil-fuel consumption, curtailing drilling on federal lands and subsidizing renewable energy.

Trump promised during the campaign that a rollback of the Democratic administration's policies would help free the nation from reliance on imported oil.

"Under my presidency, we will accomplish complete American energy independence," said Trump, describing regulation as a "self-inflicted wound."

The Trump administration is now preparing an executive order - dubbed the "Energy Independence" executive order - to roll back Obama-era regulations, which could be signed as early as this month, according to administration officials.

U.S. presidents have aimed to reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil since the Arab oil embargo of the 1970s, which triggered soaring prices. But the United States still imports about 7.9 million barrels of crude oil a day - almost enough meet total oil demand in Japan and India combined.

"ENERGY RENAISSANCE"

The Trump administration's attacks on regulation have been applauded by the oil industry.

"We haven't seen 3 percent growth in the economy for eight years, and I think part of the reason is that we've had a heavy dose of regulation," Chevron Corp. CEO John Watson said at CERAWeek, a global energy conference in Houston this month.

Continental Resources CEO, Harold Hamm, who advised Trump on energy issues during his campaign for the White House, told the Republican National Convention in Cleveland in July that stripping regulation could allow the country to double its production of oil and gas, triggering a new "American energy renaissance."

Yet Continental's annual report, filed last month with the SEC, says environmental regulation - after eight years under the Obama administration - does not have a "material adverse effect on our operations to any greater degree than other similarly situated competitors."

Continental's competitors who reported actual spending on environmental compliance told investors that such expenses amount to a small percentage of operating revenues.

Fourteen of the 15 companies whose filings were reviewed by Reuters declined to comment on their statements to investors or the impact of regulation on their profits.

A spokesman for ConocoPhillips acknowledged that regulatory compliance has not had a material adverse impact on the company's liquidity or financial position. But red tape can be an unwelcome burden nonetheless.

"Changing, excessive, overlapping, duplicative and potentially conflicting regulations increase costs, cause potential delays and negatively impact investment decisions, with great cost to consumers of energy," the spokesman, Daren Beaudo, said in a written statement.

The American Petroleum Institute - which represents the U.S. oil and gas industry - also declined to comment.

Last month, before the U.S. Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, API President Jack Gerard said that the oil and gas industry has surged forward despite onerous regulations under the Obama administration.

"Technological innovations and industry leadership have propelled the oil and gas industry forward despite the unprecedented onslaught of 145 new and pending federal regulatory actions targeting our industry."

Though the industry saw a staunch opponent in Obama, oil and gas production soared more than 50 percent during his presidency. That was mainly because of high oil prices and improved hydraulic fracturing, a drilling technology that has allowed producers to access new reserves in previously tough-to -reach shale formations.

The rush of production ultimately contributed to a global glut that dropped crude oil prices from a high of over $100 a barrel in early 2014 to a low of nearly $25 by 2016. Current prices hover near $50 a barrel.

NO "MATERIAL" IMPACT

Four of the 15 companies reviewed by Reuters reported that spending on environmental matters - including new equipment or facilities, as well as fines and compliance staffing - amounted to a small fraction of revenues.

Exxon Mobil reported spending $4.9 billion worldwide in 2016, or about 2.24 percent of gross revenue. Occidental Petroleum , a much smaller company, reported spending $285 million, or about 2.82 percent of revenue. Neither addressed whether the spending was "material" in their filings.

Two other companies, ConocoPhillips and Chevron, also broke out their environmental spending while reporting that regulation had no material impact on their business. Conoco spent $627 million in 2016, or about 2.57 percent of gross revenue, while Chevron spent $2.1 billion, or 1.91 percent of gross revenue.

The other 11 companies did not break out spending, but all of them told the SEC that environmental regulation did not have a material impact on their business.

In one typical statement, EOG Resources , one of the biggest U.S. producers, told investors in a report filed last month: "Compliance with environmental laws and regulations increases EOG's overall cost of business, but has not had, to date, a material adverse effect on EOG's operations, financial condition or results of operations."

Devon Energy Corp , Anadarko Petroleum Corp , Pioneer Natural Resources Co , Apache Corp , and other large U.S.-focused oil and gas drillers used similar wording.

"ABSENCE OF A NEGATIVE"

Still, Obama's exit - and Trump's win over Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in November - has been enough to brighten the outlook of some big investors.

"I believe the absence of a negative is a positive," John Dowd, who manages several energy funds at Fidelity Investments, wrote in his 2017 energy outlook. "The market has been concerned with the sustainability of fracking, and particularly to what extent it might have been regulated into obscurity by a different election outcome."

Clinton had said during her campaign that she planned to increase regulation on fracking.

Other segments of the energy industry, such as coal mining and oil refining, were harder hit by environmental protection measures during Obama's presidency. Several coal companies went bankrupt in recent years and blamed Obama's climate change initiatives for raising costs and hurting demand.

Refiners have also long complained that environmental regulations have stymied attempts to build new refineries and that they have borne the brunt of costly rules requiring them to blend biofuels into their gasoline.

Still, some energy analysts and regulation experts point out that the biggest drivers for these industries, too, tend to be supply and demand – not regulation.

The abundance of cheap natural gas is seen as the biggest obstacle to reviving coal country, since both fuels compete for space in the furnaces of U.S. power plants. For refiners, the key driver for profitability is the differential between the price of their raw material, crude oil, and the fuels they make with it.

"Supply and demand are the fundamental forces driving markets," said Coglianese, the University of Pennsylvania law professor. "Regulation is relatively trivial."

Nigeria's crude oil exports to rise in May - loading plans - 路透新闻

{{20170328T155623.645+0000}}Nigeria's crude oil exports to rise in May - loading plansLONDON, March 28 (Reuters) - Nigeria's crude oil exports are
set to rise to 1.66 million barrels per day (bpd) in May,
according to a loading programme compiled by Reuters on Tuesday.

The programme for the month is up from April's revised
loadings and also puts Nigeria just above Angola's planned
exports of 1.61 million bpd in May. [nL5N1H451F]

While Nigeria had consistently been Africa's largest oil
exporter, its loadings have fallen below those of Angola several
times over the past year as it dealt with militant attacks on
oil infrastructure in the Niger Delta.

The increase to 54 May cargoes from 52 in April, or 1.61
million bpd, came in part from rising exports of Bonga and
Antan, both of which were hit earlier in the year by scheduled
maintenance.

Exports of Qua Iboe were expected to be either flat or
lower. April's export plans for Qua Iboe were uncertain, with
some traders showing a programme with nine cargoes and others
with eight.

Field operator ExxonMobil has re-issued the Qua programme
several times as it grappled with loading delays of as much as
two weeks. Traders said the problem stemmed from pumping issues
and metering issues on the export pipeline. Exxon has declined
to comment. [nL5N1GG4JK]

UPDATE 1-Tillerson to meet NATO on March 31, ending no-show furore - 路透新闻

{{20170324T190832.893+0000}}UPDATE 1-Tillerson to meet NATO on March 31, ending no-show furore(Adds U.S. State Department official on Tillerson)

By Robin Emmott and Lesley Wroughton

BRUSSELS/WASHINGTON, March 24 (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson will meet NATO foreign ministers at a rescheduled gathering on March 31, a senior State Department official said on Friday, ending a furore over his earlier decision to skip the event.

Reuters exclusively reported on Monday that Tillerson had decided not to attend his first meeting with the ministers, originally scheduled for April 5-6 - raising fears about the new U.S. administration's commitment to the military alliance. [nL2N1GY03B]

But the State Department official said the meeting in Brussels had been brought forward and would now go ahead. There was no official statement from NATO.

Tillerson's potential no-show had increased unease caused by U.S. President Donald Trump's description of NATO as "obsolete" during his election campaign.

Trump has since said he strongly supports the alliance, but in interviews and speeches he continues to air grievances over what he see as Europe's failure to pay its fair share of protecting the West.

Tillerson met many of the NATO foreign ministers in Washington this week at a gathering of the coalition fighting Islamic State militants, but the meeting in Brussels would be his first formal NATO ministerial.

Given the U.S. role as the de facto head of the alliance, it is rare for the United States' top diplomat to miss a NATO meeting. The last time was during the Iraq war in 2003, when Colin Powell was forced to cancel at the last moment.

Tillerson, a former top executive at Exxon Mobil Corp who worked with the Russian government, originally decided to attend a U.S. visit by the Chinese president instead of the April NATO meeting, Reuters reported.

"The Secretary of State will visit NATO in Brussels on Friday, March 31st. The visit will come after his trip to Ankara, Turkey. Details about his schedule are forthcoming," the State Department official said on Friday.

U.S. drillers add most rigs in a week since January -Baker Hughes - 路透新闻

{{20170324T170722.951+0000}}U.S. drillers add most rigs in a week since January -Baker HughesMarch 24 (Reuters) - U.S. drillers added oil rigs for a
tenth week in a row,  doubling the rig count in a ten-month
recovery as energy companies boost spending on new production to
take advantage of a recovery in crude prices.

Drillers added 21 oil rigs in the week to March 24, the
biggest weekly increase since the week to Jan. 20, bringing the
total count up to 652, up from a six-year low of 316 in May, 
energy services firm Baker Hughes Inc  said on Friday.

During the same week a year ago, there were 372 active oil
rigs.

That rig count increase came despite a collapse in U.S.
crude futures over the past two weeks down to levels seen when
the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC)
agreed to cut production on Nov. 30.

U.S. crude futures  steadied around $48 a barrel on
Friday as rising domestic production and inventories offset
hopes OPEC output cuts were beginning to balance the global
glut. [O/R]

U.S. crude inventories have been growing since the start of
the year and hit a fresh record high last week as steadily
rising production climbed to over 9.1 million barrels per day.

Production was projected to rise from an average of 8.9
million bpd in 2016 to 9.2 million bpd in 2017 and a record high
of 9.6 million bpd in 2018, according to federal energy data.

Even though U.S. shale producers were drilling at the
highest rate in 18 months, they have left a record number of
wells unfinished in the Permian basin, the largest oilfield in
the country, a sign that output may not rise as swiftly as
drilling activity would indicate. [nL2N1H0233]

Since crude prices first topped $50 a barrel in May after
recovering from 13-year lows in February 2016, drillers have
added a total of 336 oil rigs in 39 of the past 43 weeks, the
biggest recovery in rigs since a global oil glut crushed the
market over two years starting in mid 2014.

Baker Hughes oil rig count plunged from a record 1,609 in
October 2014 to 316 in May 2016 as U.S. crude collapsed from
over $107 in June 2014 to near $26 in February 2016.

Analysts projected U.S. energy firms would boost spending on
drilling and pump more oil and natural gas from shale fields in
coming years with energy prices expected to climb higher.

Futures for the balance of 2017  were trading about
$49 a barrel, while calendar 2018  was fetching around
$50 a barrel.

Analysts at Simmons & Co, energy specialists at U.S.
investment bank Piper Jaffray, this week forecast the total oil
and gas rig count would average 831 in 2017, 953 in 2018 and
1,064 in 2019. Most wells produce both oil and gas.

That compares with an average of 736 so far in 2017, 509 in
2016 and 978 in 2015, according to Baker Hughes data.

Analysts at U.S. financial services firm Cowen & Co said in
a note this week that its capital expenditure tracking showed 57
exploration and production (E&P) companies planned to increase
spending by an average of 50 percent in 2017 over 2016.

That expected spending increase in 2017 followed an
estimated 48 percent decline in 2016 and a 34 percent decline in
2015, Cowen said according to the 64 E&P companies it tracks.

NATO aims for Tillerson meeting on March 31 -diplomats - 路透新闻

* Tillerson's presence seen as indicator of U.S. support

* Rare for U.S. top diplomat to miss a NATO meeting

By Robin Emmott

BRUSSELS, March 24 (Reuters) - NATO foreign ministers aim to meet the new U.S. secretary of state on March 31 if no other allies object, alliance diplomats said, ending a furore about Rex Tillerson's decision to skip a planned April meeting to attend a summit with China.

If no agreement is found soon, the meeting will go ahead as scheduled on April 5-6, three diplomats said. There has also been discussion about a gathering before the G7 foreign ministers meeting in Italy on April 10-11, which Tillerson will attend, but March 31 is the preferred date, diplomats said.

A NATO official said there was no decision yet. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg told Reuters in an interview this week that both NATO and the United States were looking for a new date for talks. [nL2N1GZ1T7]

Reuters exclusively reported on Monday that Tillerson, a former top executive at Exxon Mobil Corp who worked with the Russian government, would skip his first meeting with all NATO foreign ministers for a U.S. visit by the Chinese president and travel to Russia in April. [nL2N1GY03B]

Tillerson's potential no-show increased unease among European allies about U.S. President Donald Trump's commitment to the Western military alliance despite assurances by his defence minister and vice president of support.

During his election campaign and on the eve of taking office, Trump called NATO "obsolete". He has since said he strongly supports the alliance, but in interviews and speeches he continues to air grievances over what he see as Europe's failure to pay its fair share of protecting the West.

Tillerson met many of the NATO foreign ministers in Washington this week at a gathering of the coalition fighting Islamic State militants, but the meeting in Brussels would be his first formal NATO ministerial.

Given the U.S. role as the de facto head of the alliance, it is rare for the United States' top diplomat to miss a NATO meeting. The last time was during the Iraq war in 2003, when Colin Powell was forced to cancel at the last moment.

UPDATE 3-World's top LNG buyers form alliance to push for flexible contracts - 路透新闻

{{20170323T155538.045+0000}}UPDATE 3-World's top LNG buyers form alliance to push for flexible contracts* S.Korea's KOGAS, Japan's JERA, China's CNOOC sign MOU

* Top LNG buyers to work together to get flexible LNG contracts

* Glut means producers are under pressure to grant concessions

(Recasts, adds background on buyers' clubs, producer comments, Qatar official, detail on WTO and market impact)

By Jane Chung, Yuka Obayashi and Oleg Vukmanovic

SEOUL/TOKYO/MILAN, March 23 (Reuters) - The world's biggest liquefied natural gas (LNG) buyers, all in Asia, are clubbing together to secure more flexible supply contracts in a move which shifts power to importers from producers as oversupply grows.

Korea Gas Corp (KOGAS) said on Thursday it had signed a memorandum of understanding in mid-March with Japan's JERA and China National Offshore Oil Corp (CNOOC) to exchange information and "cooperate in the joint procurement of LNG."

Together, the three companies purchase a third of global LNG production, giving them a strong hand to challenge restrictive contract terms that have squeezed buyers' finances.

Influential buyers' clubs are largely unheard of in commodity markets where it is the producers, such as the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), who wield power, enforcing production quotas to manage prices.

A painful period of high LNG prices before 2014 left Asian importers scrambling to contain losses and led to the first talks between India, Japan, South Korea, China and Taiwan about joint purchases.

Several joint LNG-buying deals have been set up since then but none approach the scale of the latest agreement, which is the first involving the game's biggest players.

Under Thursday's agreement, the buyers aim to extract concessions from producers that would give them supply flexibility, such as having the right to re-sell imports to third parties, something they are not allowed to do currently under so-called destination restrictions.

"We have created a platform to share, discuss and solve our common issues such as traditional LNG business practices, including destination restrictions," said JERA spokesman Atsuo Sawaki.

The alliance of three big buyers across three countries will put pressure on exporters such as Qatar, Australia and Malaysia. They prefer to have clients locked into fixed supply contracts which run for decades and make buyers take fixed amounts of monthly volumes irrespective of demand, with no right to re-sell surplus supplies to other end-users.

'MARKET CRUNCH'

The agreement has been helped by the fact the power wielded by OPEC is unparalleled in the commodities world. Attempts to create an OPEC-style body through the Gas Exporting Countries Forum has failed to gain traction because gas and LNG markets are more fragmented than oil, while similar moves in coffee, railroads, rubber and tin have all collapsed over the decades.

The LNG market is undergoing huge changes as the biggest ever flood of new supply is hitting the market, with volumes coming mainly from Australia and the United States.

JERA, KOGAS and CNOOC will all struggle with having excess supplies in the next few years, sources at three major LNG producers told Reuters, curbing the consortium's ability to strike any new deals this decade.

Reworking existing deals, however, is feasible and may hit the world's biggest producer Qatar the hardest as many of its mid-term supply deals with Japan start to expire from around 2023, industry sources said.

A senior Qatar Petroleum official hinted that buyers - emboldened by temporarily oversupplied markets to demand better terms - may come to regret their actions when the cycle turns.

"Right now the market is over-supplied but if we went into a period of a tighter market, how would these buyers organisations hold up? That is an important question," the official said.

"If there is a market crunch and gas tightens it could recreate incentives for buyers to lock in long-term contracts."

More practically, the deal complements the buying habits of each company - KOGAS largely buys for winter, CNOOC for summer and JERA across both seasons - offering opportunities for swapping cargoes, industry sources said.

"Flexibility is becoming critical for LNG buyers ... as the rise of solar capacity is going to make consumption of LNG more seasonal," said Kerry Anne Shanks, head of LNG research for Asia/Pacific at Wood Mackenzie.

PRESSURE ON PRODUCERS

New production has resulted in global installed LNG capacity of over 300 million tonnes a year, while only around 268 million tonnes of LNG were traded in 2016, according to Thomson Reuters data.

That has helped pull down Asian spot LNG prices by more than 70 percent from their 2014 peaks to $5.65 per million British thermal units (mmBtu).

It has also given importers more suppliers to choose from, putting pressure on major producers like Royal Dutch Shell , Chevron , ExxonMobil and Woodside Petroleum to grant more flexible contract terms.

Companies forming cartels are difficult to challenge at the World Trade Organization, which does not have rules about anti-competitive behaviour and only governs trade relations between member countries. But WTO rules do oblige state-run firms to trade on commercial and non-discriminatory terms.

Thomas Cottier, a law professor and senior research fellow at the World Trade Institute at the University of Bern, said the LNG alliance may or may not comply with the WTO rules.

"To the extent that governments are directly or indirectly involved, it may violate rules on state trading or the prohibition to encourage voluntary export restraints. However, conduct of private companies is subject to domestic anti-trust law and is not part of WTO law," he told Reuters by email.

Even if an LNG supplier such as Qatar, Russia or Australia launched a dispute at the WTO, several other major gas producers such as Iran and Turkmenistan are not members of the WTO and therefore have no right to have their complaints heard there.

UPDATE 1-Statoil wins licences off UK, "resets" exploration off U.S. - 路透新闻

{{20170323T142536.308+0000}}UPDATE 1-Statoil wins licences off UK, "resets" exploration off U.S.* Bids $44.5 mln for 13 licences in U.S. Gulf of Mexico

* Says "resets" exploration campaign offshore U.S.

* Wins six licences, including five operated, in UK

(Combines British, U.S. strands)

OSLO, March 23 (Reuters) - Norway's Statoil was the second top bidder for 13 oil exploration leases in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and won six licences offshore Britain, it said on Thursday, in a sign it may be looking to boost reserves after slashing costs.

"The importance of oil companies' ability to replenish reserves after several years of spending cuts is increasing as oil prices stabilize, brokerage RBC Capital Markets said in a note on Thursday."

Statoil bid a total of $44.5 million for 13 licences in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, coming second only to Shell and ahead of Hess Corp , Chevron and Exxon , the latest auction results showed. [nL2N1GZ29E]

The company said in a separate statement it had won five new operated licences in the northern North Sea and one in the frontier area west of Scotland, committing to drill at least three wells.

Statoil said its bids for licences in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico meant that the company was "resetting" its exploration campaign there, two months after saying it was considering whether to end it due to poor results. [nL5N1EW13J]

"We continue to believe in the potential of the Gulf of Mexico," Statoil's Tore Loeseth, head of exploration in the U.S. and Mexico, said in a statement.

Statoil's spokesman said the company believed it could be more successful based on the analysis of the seismic data and the lessons from the previous drilling.

The U.S. auctions results are subject to a 90-days formal review and final approval, with no commitment to drill.

Statoil, however, would have to hand back its licences if it fails to spud wells in 5-10 years, depending on water depths.

The company expected its offshore U.S. production to nearly double by 2020 from about 60,000 barrels per day in 2016.

The tender in Britain, which received bids last year, attracted the lowest interest in 14 years, reflecting the drop in appetite for finding new oil in the North Sea due to high costs and weak oil prices. [nL8N1D12MZ]

Brent crude price were trading at over $50 a barrel most of the time in 2017, up from over $40 a barrel in 2016.

INSIGHT-As Trump targets energy rules, oil companies downplay their impact - 路透新闻

{{20170323T110002.463+0000}}INSIGHT-As Trump targets energy rules, oil companies downplay their impactBy Richard Valdmanis

BOSTON, March 23 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump's White House has said his plans to slash environmental regulations will trigger a new energy boom and help the United States drill its way to independence from foreign oil.

But the top U.S. oil and gas companies have been telling their shareholders that regulations have little impact on their business, according to a Reuters review of U.S. securities filings from the top producers.

In annual reports to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, 13 of the 15 biggest U.S. oil and gas producers said that compliance with current regulations is not impacting their operations or their financial condition.

The other two made no comment about whether their businesses were materially affected by regulation, but reported spending on compliance with environmental regulations at less than 3 percent of revenue.

The dissonance raises questions about whether Trump's war on regulation can increase domestic oil and gas output, as he has promised, or boost profits and share prices of oil and gas companies, as some investors have hoped.

According to the SEC, a publicly traded company must deem a matter "material" and report it to the agency if there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable investor would consider it important.

"Materiality is a fairly low bar," said Cary Coglianese, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania who runs the university's research program on regulation. "Despite exaggerated claims, regulatory costs are usually a very small portion of many companies' cost of doing business."

The oil majors' annual filings come after the industry and its political allies have spent years criticizing the Obama administration for policies aimed at reducing fossil-fuel consumption, curtailing drilling on federal lands and subsidizing renewable energy.

Trump promised during the campaign that a rollback of the Democratic administration's policies would help free the nation from reliance on imported oil.

"Under my presidency, we will accomplish complete American energy independence," said Trump, describing regulation as a "self-inflicted wound."

The Trump administration is now preparing an executive order - dubbed the "Energy Independence" executive order - to roll back Obama-era regulations, which could be signed as early as this month, according to administration officials.

U.S. presidents have aimed to reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil since the Arab oil embargo of the 1970s, which triggered soaring prices. But the United States still imports about 7.9 million barrels of crude oil a day - almost enough meet total oil demand in Japan and India combined.

"ENERGY RENASSAINCE"

The Trump administration's attacks on regulation have been applauded by the oil industry.

"We haven't seen 3 percent growth in the economy for eight years, and I think part of the reason is that we've had a heavy dose of regulation," Chevron Corp. CEO John Watson said at CERAWeek, a global energy conference in Houston this month.

Continental Resources CEO, Harold Hamm, who advised Trump on energy issues during his campaign for the White House, told the Republican National Convention in Cleveland in July that stripping regulation could allow the country to double its production of oil and gas, triggering a new "American energy renaissance."

Yet Continental's annual report, filed last month with the SEC, says environmental regulation - after eight years under the Obama administration - does not have a "material adverse effect on our operations to any greater degree than other similarly situated competitors."

Continental's competitors who reported actual spending on environmental compliance told investors that such expenses amount to a small percentage of operating revenues.

Fourteen of the 15 companies whose filings were reviewed by Reuters declined to comment on their statements to investors or the impact of regulation on their profits.

A spokesman for ConocoPhillips acknowledged that regulatory compliance has not had a material adverse impact on the company's liquidity or financial position. But red tape can be an unwelcome burden nonetheless.

"Changing, excessive, overlapping, duplicative and potentially conflicting regulations increase costs, cause potential delays and negatively impact investment decisions, with great cost to consumers of energy," the spokesman, Daren Beaudo, said in a written statement.

The American Petroleum Institute - which represents the U.S. oil and gas industry - also declined to comment.

Last month, before the U.S. Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, API President Jack Gerard said that the oil and gas industry has surged forward despite onerous regulations under the Obama administration.

"Technological innovations and industry leadership have propelled the oil and gas industry forward despite the unprecedented onslaught of 145 new and pending federal regulatory actions targeting our industry."

Though the industry saw a staunch opponent in Obama, oil and gas production soared more than 50 percent during his presidency. That was mainly because of high oil prices and improved hydraulic fracturing, a drilling technology that has allowed producers to access new reserves in previously tough-to -reach shale formations.

The rush of production ultimately contributed to a global glut that dropped crude oil prices from a high of over $100 a barrel in early 2014 to a low of nearly $25 by 2016. Current prices hover near $50 a barrel.

NO "MATERIAL" IMPACT

Four of the 15 companies reviewed by Reuters reported that spending on environmental matters - including new equipment or facilities, as well as fines and compliance staffing - amounted to a small fraction of revenues.

Exxon Mobil reported spending $4.9 billion worldwide in 2016, or about 2.24 percent of gross revenue. Occidental Petroleum , a much smaller company, reported spending $285 million, or about 2.82 percent of revenue. Neither addressed whether the spending was "material" in their filings.

Two other companies, ConocoPhillips and Chevron, also broke out their environmental spending while reporting that regulation had no material impact on their business. Conoco spent $627 million in 2016, or about 2.57 percent of gross revenue, while Chevron spent $2.1 billion, or 1.91 percent of gross revenue.

The other 11 companies did not break out spending, but all of them told the SEC that environmental regulation did not have a material impact on their business.

In one typical statement, EOG Resources , one of the biggest U.S. producers, told investors in a report filed last month: "Compliance with environmental laws and regulations increases EOG's overall cost of business, but has not had, to date, a material adverse effect on EOG's operations, financial condition or results of operations."

Devon Energy Corp , Anadarko Petroleum Corp , Pioneer Natural Resources Co , Apache Corp , and other large U.S.-focused oil and gas drillers used similar wording.

"ABSENCE OF A NEGATIVE"

Still, Obama's exit - and Trump's win over Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in November - has been enough to brighten the outlook of some big investors.

"I believe the absence of a negative is a positive," John Dowd, who manages several energy funds at Fidelity Investments, wrote in his 2017 energy outlook. "The market has been concerned with the sustainability of fracking, and particularly to what extent it might have been regulated into obscurity by a different election outcome."

Clinton had said during her campaign that she planned to increase regulation on fracking.

Other segments of the energy industry, such as coal mining and oil refining, were harder hit by environmental protection measures during Obama's presidency. Several coal companies went bankrupt in recent years and blamed Obama's climate change initiatives for raising costs and hurting demand.

Refiners have also long complained that environmental regulations have stymied attempts to build new refineries and that they have borne the brunt of costly rules requiring them to blend biofuels into their gasoline.

Still, some energy analysts and regulation experts point out that the biggest drivers for these industries, too, tend to be supply and demand – not regulation.

The abundance of cheap natural gas is seen as the biggest obstacle to reviving coal country, since both fuels compete for space in the furnaces of U.S. power plants. For refiners, the key driver for profitability is the differential between the price of their raw material, crude oil, and the fuels they make with it.

"Supply and demand are the fundamental forces driving markets," said Coglianese, the University of Pennsylvania law professor. "Regulation is relatively trivial."

Statoil "resets" exploration in U.S. Gulf of Mexico - 路透新闻

{{20170323T070811.946+0000}}Statoil "resets" exploration in U.S. Gulf of MexicoOSLO, March 23 (Reuters) - Norway's Statoil has "reset" its exploration campaign in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico by placing top bids for 13 offshore deepwater oil and gas leases there in the latest auction, the company said Thursday.

The majority state-owned company said in January it was considering whether to end its costly search for oil and gas in the region following a series of exploration failures. [nL5N1EW13J]

Statoil made total bids of $44.5 million in the auction, second only to Shell and ahead of Hess Corp , Chevron and Exxon .

The outcome will now be subject to a 90-days formal review and final approval. [nL2N1GZ29E]

"We continue to believe in the potential of the Gulf of Mexico," Statoil's Tore Loeseth, head of exploration in the U.S. and Mexico, said in a statement.

Statoil said it expected its offshore U.S. production to nearly double by 2020 from about 60,000 barrels per day in 2016.

Grandes petroleras abren sus billeteras en subasta por lotes en el Golfo de México - 路透新闻

{{20170323T024914.293+0000}}Grandes petroleras abren sus billeteras en subasta por lotes en el Golfo de MéxicoPor Ruthy Munoz

HOUSTON, 22 mar (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell plc , Chevron Corp y Exxon Mobil Corp anunciaron el retorno de la industria petrolera a las aguas profundas del Golfo de México en una subasta del Gobierno, con un repunte de un 76 por ciento en las ofertas máximas frente al nivel del año previo.

La subasta de bloques de petróleo y gas costa afuera recibió cerca de 275 millones de dólares en ofertas máximas, frente a los 156,4 millones de dólares del año anterior. La subasta del 2016 atrajo el cuarto total más bajo de ofertas de licitación en el centro del Golfo.

La industria petrolera se había alejado de los proyectos en aguas profundas debido a la caída de los precios del crudo y a una mayor fiscalización de los reguladores tras el desastre de Deepwater Horizon en abril del 2010, el mayor derrame marítimo accidental de petróleo.

El derrame de cinco meses de duración, que arrojó unos 210 millones de galones estadounidenses (780.000 m3) de crudo en el Golfo, causó grandes daños a los hábitats marinos y la fauna, así como a la pesca y el turismo de la zona, lo que obligó a BP a vender activos por valor de miles de millones de dólares.

La subasta del miércoles es la primera bajo la presidencia Donald Trump, quien ha prometido reducir los obstáculos regulatorios y de permisos a fin de apoyar la exploración energética.

Major oil companies open their wallets in Gulf of Mexico bidding - 路透新闻

{{20170323T012920.550+0000}}Major oil companies open their wallets in Gulf of Mexico biddingBy Ruthy Munoz

HOUSTON, March 22 (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell plc, Chevron Corp and Exxon Mobil Corp signaled the oil industry's return to the Gulf of Mexico's deep waters with high bids in a government auction up 76 percent over a year ago.

The auction of offshore oil and gas parcels received nearly $275 million in high bids, compared with $156.4 million a year ago. The year-ago auction drew the fourth lowest total bids for leases in the central Gulf.

The oil industry had moved away from deep water projects as oil prices fell and regulatory scrutiny increased following the Deepwater Horizon disaster in April 2010, the largest accidental marine oil spill. The five-month-long spill, which spewed some 210 million U.S. gallons (780,000 m3) into the Gulf, caused extensive damage to marine and wildlife habitats, as well as to the area's fishing and tourism industries, forcing BP to sell assets worth of billions of dollars.

Wednesday's auction was the first under President Donald Trump, who has promised to cut permitting and regulatory hurdles in support of energy exploration.

Shell and Chevron each had 20 high bids, and Shell's $55.8 million total was the largest among the 26 companies submitting offers. Norway's Statoil ASA was the second-largest total bidder with $44.5 million, followed by Hess Corp , Chevron and Exxon.

"Today's strong sale reflects continued industry optimism and interest in the Gulf's Outer Continental Shelf, Department of Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said in a statement.

The highest bid on a single block this year, from Shell, was for $24 million, almost twice last year's $13.6 million top offer. Among other top bidders, Exxon submitted 19 high bids totaling nearly $22 million, and Anadarko Petroleum had 16 high bids totaling nearly $19 million.

The bids will be evaluated for the next 90 days by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management and winners disclosed following the review.

Interest in new deep-water projects is heating up with more favorable costs for drilling rigs, services and production equipment. Shell has cut its well costs by at least 50 percent and reduced logistics costs by three quarters, helping make deep-water projects affordable at crude prices under $50 a barrel.

Last month, the Anglo-Dutch oil giant gave final approval to go ahead with its Kaikias deep-water project in the Gulf. In December, BP said it planned to move ahead with a previously delayed expansion project known as Mad Dog Phase 2, the first new platform sanctioned for the Gulf in a year and a half.

Cyprus to move forward with more oil drilling licensing -minister - 路透新闻

{{20170322T211659.568+0000}}Cyprus to move forward with more oil drilling licensing -ministerNEW YORK, March 22 (Reuters) - Cyprus will move ahead with further licensing for oil drilling after analyzing the results of its most recent exploration, the country's energy minister Yiorgos Lakkotrypis said on Wednesday.

Cyprus announced the completion of a third round of licensing for well drilling in which Exxon Mobil , Italy's ENI and France's Total won additional blocks offshore. The contracts will be signed on April 5 and 6, but it has not yet been determined which blocks off Cyprus' coast the companies will drill, Lakkotrypis said.

The minister said that while the country's current priority is "exploration, exploration, exploration," he expected much more for Cyprus on the energy front.

"Once we have the results of this exploration 2.0 as I called it, then of course there will be a fourth (round) and a fifth and a sixth and I'm sure there will be plenty more," Lakkotrypis told Reuters on the sidelines of Capital Link's Invest in Cyprus Forum in New York City.

Additionally, ENI and Total will have additional wells on the already licensed block with ENI expected to begin work in late June or early July. ENI will also progress with "a couple" of wells this year, Lakkotrypis said. Exxon will be developing its well in 2018 with a number of exploration wells to take place in the coming years.

Cyprus is seeking to develop its energy sector to bolster an economy that relies largely on tourism, business services and shipping. However efforts to expand the energy sector could be complicated by the island's division between Turkish Cypriots and Greek Cypriots.

Turkey, which supports a breakaway Turkish Cypriot state in northern Cyprus and is highly influential there, says the Greek Cypriot-led government of the island has no right to explore for hydrocarbons.

Cyprus and Turkey do not have diplomatic relations and peace talks between Greek and Turkish Cypriots to reunite the island under a federal umbrella broke off abruptly in February.

Lakkotrypis said the government was committed to negotiating an agreement with Turkey but that its oil and gas development was not part of that discussion.

"Cyprus is a sovereign country," he said. "We will continue to go ahead and proceed with strategic plans in the oil and gas industry to develop the industry with the help of some of the biggest companies in the world."

UPDATE 1-Exxon must confer with NY atty gen'l on Tillerson emails -judge - 路透新闻

{{20170322T193227.099+0000}}UPDATE 1-Exxon must confer with NY atty gen'l on Tillerson emails -judge(Adds details from hearing, background, other email cases)

By Karen Freifeld

NEW YORK, March 22 (Reuters) - A New York state judge on Wednesday ordered ExxonMobil Corp to work with New York's attorney general to recover lost emails from an account once used by U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson when he was the oil company's chief executive.

Justice Barry Ostrager of the State Supreme Court in Manhattan also ordered Exxon by March 31 to turn over documents from its management committee that had been subpoenaed by Eric Schneiderman, the attorney general.

Schneiderman had issued the subpoena in November, in connection with his probe into whether Exxon misled investors and the public about climate change. [nL2N1GX0RV]

At a court hearing on Wednesday, a lawyer for the attorney general said Exxon had just made a "bombshell" revelation that it had lost a year of emails from an account that Tillerson had used, but under the alias "Wayne Tracker."

Tillerson used the alias account to send and receive information about climate change and other matters, Schneiderman said in a March 13 letter to the court. [nL2N1GQ1T7]

Schneiderman said Exxon failed to disclose the "Wayne Tracker" account, and that it had been uncovered during the review of other materials.

The letter also said Exxon had produced 60 documents bearing the "Wayne Tracker" email, but had not said the account was Tillerson's.

Exxon responded that the account was proper, enabling Tillerson to communicate easily with other Exxon officials, and set up because of the flood of email that Tillerson already received.

It has also said it does not consider the lost emails significant, and that copies of many would already have been turned over to the attorney general.

In December, Tillerson left Exxon, where he had also been chairman, and stepped down as chairman of the American Petroleum Institute trade group. [nL1N1F10OH] [nL4N1E94WG]

The discovery of Tillerson's account came after disclosures that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and current Vice President Mike Pence, when he was Indiana's governor, had used previously undisclosed accounts to send and receive mail electronically.

U.S. sticks to global transparency initiative after Congress repeal  - 路透新闻

{{20170322T191400.363+0000}}U.S. sticks to global transparency initiative after Congress repeal By Valerie Volcovici and Nerijus Adomaitis

WASHINGTON/OSLO, March 22 (Reuters) - The United States remains committed to the "principles and goals" of the global transparency initiative to fight corruption in managing revenues from oil, gas and mineral extraction, it said on Wednesday.

There were doubts about U.S. participation in the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) after Congress killed the "resource extraction rule" that required companies such as Exxon Mobil to disclose taxes and other fees paid to foreign governments, such as Russia.[nL1N1FO0JM]

The EITI, which was founded in 2003, and which the U.S. joined in 2014, sets a global standard for governments to disclose their revenues from oil, gas, and mining assets, and for companies to report payments made to obtain access to publicly owned resources, as well as other donations.

"The (U.S. Interior) Department remains committed to the principles and goals of EITI including transparency and good governance of the extractive sectors...," Heather Swift, a spokesperson for Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, said in an email to Reuters.

Industry sources familiar with EITI implementation said the United States was already pulling out in all but name, but could formally remain a member until its progress assessment scheduled to start in April 2018.

Azerbaijan left the group in March after the EITI board, chaired by Sweden's former prime minister Fredrik Reinfeldt, suspended its membership over concerns about limits on civic freedoms.[nL5N1GN5P0]

The EITI initiative was primarily aimed at developing nations and most of its members are in Africa. But Britain, Germany and Norway also joined, while France and Australia have also expressed interest.

Democratic Senator Ben Cardin and former Republican Senator Richard Lugar, authors of legislation encouraging U.S. participation in EITI, said withdrawal would harm national interests.

"Such a retreat is a retreat from our values, which give America its strength and its moral leadership in the world," they said in a joint statement.

Jonas Moberg, head of EITI's secretariat in Oslo, said the United States continued to be the part of the global initiative, but if it decided to leave, it wouldn't be the end of the initiative, now being implemented in 51 countries.

"Should the administration of President Trump decide to bring an end to EITI implementation, we are not concerned that it would be a decision followed elsewhere," he added in an email to Reuters.

The International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM), which represents 23 leading mining companies, has said companies that work in EITI member countries will still have to abide by strict disclosure rules, despite the recent U.S. legal changes. [nL5N1FT5KX]

Judge orders Exxon to confer with New York AG on Tillerson emails - 路透新闻

{{20170322T181701.522+0000}}Judge orders Exxon to confer with New York AG on Tillerson emailsNEW YORK, March 22 (Reuters) - A New York state judge on Wednesday ordered ExxonMobil Corp to work with the New York attorney general's office to try to recover lost emails from an alias account used by U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson when he was the oil company's chairman and chief executive.

Justice Barry Ostrager, who is overseeing a probe by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman into whether Exxon misled the public and shareholders about the impact of climate change, also ordered the company to turn over management documents by March 31.

In a letter to the judge last week, Schneiderman said Exxon had failed to disclose Tillerson used the alias "Wayne Tracker" for certain communications at the company. The company has said Tillerson used the alias because his main email was too full, but said it may not have preserved all of his messages from the Tracker account. [nL2N1GX0RV]

REFILE-Saudi king's Asia tour trumpets Aramco's moves downstream - 路透新闻

{{20170322T092520.193+0000}}REFILE-Saudi king's Asia tour trumpets Aramco's moves downstream(Refiles to clarify in paragraph 7 that RAPID will be one of Aramco's biggest new refinery projects outside Saudi Arabia)

* Saudi king's lavish tour belies hardnosed oil strategy

* Aramco's $7 billion JV in Malaysian refinery key

* Deal with Malaysia's Petronas helps diversify Saudi Aramco

* It also gives Saudi's more leverage over oil product prices

* Deals seen helping Aramco valuation ahead of IPO

By Henning Gloystein

SINGAPORE, March 20 (Reuters) - Saudi King Salman's lavish tour of Asia, arriving in each country on a golden escalator with 400 tonnes of luggage, had a hardnosed marketing mission - to cement the kingdom's place as leading oil supplier to the world's biggest consumer region.

The string of deals inked on his three-week tour to Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan and China also point to a fresh strategy, one to increase Saudi leverage over refined product and petrochemical markets, known as the downstream sector.

"Our strategy is about growth in the downstream," said Amin Nasser, chief executive officer of state oil company Aramco, told Reuters on Sunday. "The growth in that sector is very important, and anything integrated between refining, petrochemical, with marketing and distribution, is of interest to us."

Saudi Arabia's main influence on oil markets has been via the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), of which it is the de-facto leader.

But OPEC's ability to control prices by turning the oil pumping spigots on and off has waned as non-OPEC producers like Russia and, more recently, U.S. shale drillers, have ramped up output and eroded its grip on market share. [nL3N1GU1GS]

One indication of a shift in Saudi strategy came on the first leg of the tour in Kuala Lumpur. Aramco signed a deal to take a $7 billion investment, in a joint venture with Malaysia's state oil company Petronas in a refinery and petrochemical project known as RAPID (Refinery and Petrochemical Integrated Development).[nL3N1GD2WX]

'THE WINDOW'

Under construction in Malaysia's southern Johor state, RAPID is just across a narrow strait from Singapore, Asia's oil trading hub. Some 70 percent of the oil for the project, set to start in 2019, will come from Saudi Arabia, giving the kingdom a key outlet for its crude in Asia, the world's fastest growing market. It is one of Aramco's largest new refinery projects outside the kingdom.

Aramco also recently made a deal with Indonesia's Pertamina over a $5 billion expansion of the country's largest oil refinery, for which Aramco will supply the crude.

"The investments are intended to enhance Aramco's competitive position in Southeast Asia," said Ihsan Buhulaiga, a Saudi economist.

The Malaysian investment also allows the Saudis to join the hub of refineries in and around Singapore that help determine fuel prices in the region.

Price agency S&P Global Platts assesses dozens of fuel products during a set time every day, based on deliveries in and out of this region. Platts calls it Market-on-Close, but traders dub it "the window", and it influences pricing of oil products worth billions of dollars each day.

While crude and fuel products by many companies flow in and out of the pricing region, known as FOB Straits. But the only refineries now in this price region are operated by U.S. Exxon , Anglo-Dutch Royal Dutch Shell , and Singapore Petroleum Corp (SPC), owned by PetroChina <601857.SS>.

"When you control refining capacity with the capability to deliver petroleum products into the window, you have access to a physical outlet which also plays a key role in daily price discovery," said John Driscoll, director of consultancy JTD Energy in Singapore.

ARAMCO IPO

The Saudi move deeper into refineries and petrochemical plants would likely help the potential valuation of Aramco in what could be the world's largest-ever initial public offering.

Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who oversees the kingdom's economic policy, has said the sale is expected to value Aramco at $2 trillion or more. Analysts have estimated a valuation between $1 trillion and $1.5 trillion.

Singapore, along with Hong Kong and Tokyo have been mentioned as possible exchanges where Aramco's shares would be traded. The primary listing will be on Saudi Arabia's domestic exchange, and Riyadh is also looking at New York or London for the secondary listing.

Aramco's joint ventures in Malaysia, Indonesia and elsewhere are not only aimed at increasing its refining capacity. Its new deals in the region would also greatly increase its participation in the petrochemical sector, which involves all forms of plastics and where profits have soared thanks to strong demand.

"We have capacity of about 5.4 million barrels per day of participated refining capacity, and our target is to reach 10 million barrels by 2030," Aramco's Nasser said.

Ultimately, the big prize is China, where the Saudis signed deals that could be worth as much as $65 billion during the last leg of the king's Asian tour, covering energy, manufacturing and even a theme park in the kingdom.

The deals included a memorandum of understanding between Aramco and China North Industries Group Corp (Norinco) to look into building refining and petrochemical plants in China.

John Sfakianakis, director of the Riyadh-based Gulf Research Centre, said that the trip was "the beginning of a long-term strategy of Saudi Arabia to open itself to Asian investors and vice versa" as part of its Vision 2030 policy to diversify its economy beyond crude exports.

ACTUALIZA 1-EEUU cambia de idea, ofrece nueva fecha para reunión de OTAN - 路透新闻

{{20170321T222347.564+0000}}ACTUALIZA 1-EEUU cambia de idea, ofrece nueva fecha para reunión de OTAN(Actualiza con ofrecimiento de cambio fecha para reunión, agrega detalles y citas; cambia redacción)

Por Arshad Mohammed y Robin Emmott

WASHINGTON/BRUSELAS, 21 mar (Reuters) - El secretario de Estado Rex Tillerson propuso el martes una nueva fecha para una reunión de ministros de Relaciones Exteriores de la OTAN, dijo el Gobierno de Estados Unidos, luego de que primero decidiera no asistir al encuentro.

La decisión original de Tillerson de no ir a la reunión de la OTAN pautada para el 5 y 6 de abril en Bruselas molestó a los aliados europeos de Washington, que volvieron a dudar del compromiso del presidente Donald Trump con la alianza. Funcionarios estadounidenses dijeron que el secretario de Estado podría visitar Rusia en abril.

Reuters reportó el lunes en exclusiva que Tillerson no asistiría a la reunión de la OTAN para estar en las conversaciones de Trump con el líder chino, Xi Jinping, del 6 al 7 de abril en Florida.

La alianza ofreció cambiar las fechas de la reunión para que Tillerson pudiera acudir a ese encuentro y al de Trump con Xi, pero el Departamento de Estado rechazó la propuesta, dijeron el lunes un ex funcionario estadounidense y un ex diplomático de la OTAN, ambos bajo condición de anonimato.

Pero el martes, el portavoz del Departamento de Estado Mark Toner dijo que se presentó una propuesta de fechas para que Tillerson pueda asistir, aunque remarcó que esa decisión debe ser tomada por consenso por los 28 miembros de la OTAN. También destacó que "Estados Unidos sigue comprometido en un 100 por ciento" con la alianza.

No acudir a la reunión de la OTAN y visitar Moscú podría avivar la percepción de que Trump está dando prioridad a las relaciones de Estados Unidos con las grandes potencias, al tiempo que deja esperando a las naciones más pequeñas que dependen de Washington para su seguridad, dijeron dos ex funcionarios estadounidenses.

Trump a menudo ha elogiado al presidente ruso, Vladimir Putin. Tillerson trabajó junto al Gobierno de Rusia cuando era un ejecutivo de alto rango de Exxon Mobil Corp y ha puesto en duda la conveniencia de las sanciones contra Moscú porque, dijo, pueden perjudicar a las firmas estadounidenses.

Un ex diplomático de la OTAN, que habló bajo condición de anonimato, dijo que es vital presentar un frente unido contra Moscú. La Organización del Tratado del Atlántico Norte fue creada en 1949 para servir como bastión frente a la Unión Soviética.

Mozambique to get $350 mln in tax from Eni-Exxon deal  - Reuters News

{{20170321T181814.708+0000}}Mozambique to get $350 mln in tax from Eni-Exxon deal MAPUTO, March 21 (Reuters) - Mozambique will get $350 million in capital gains tax from Eni after the Italian oil and gas company agreed to sell a stake in a gas field to Exxon Mobil Corp , senior tax official Anibal Mbalango said on Tuesday.

Exxon, the world's biggest publicly traded oil producer, agreed earlier this month to pay Eni $2.8 billion for a 25 percent stake in a Mozambican gas field. [nL3N1GM3SO]

Eni is currently the operator of Mozambique's Area 4 licence which, with 85 trillion cubic feet of gas, is one of the world's largest gas discoveries in recent years.

The deal offers Mozambique the chance to transform itself from one of the world's poorest countries into a global LNG exporter.

WASHINGTON, 21 mar (Reuters) - El secretario de Estado estadounidense, Rex Tillerson, planea no asistir a una reunión de ministros de Relaciones Exteriores de la OTAN en abril para permanecer en su país durante una visita del presidente chino y viajaría a Rusia a fines de ese mes, dijeron funcionarios estadounidenses el lunes.

Tillerson no asistirá a la reunión de la OTAN del 5 al 6 de abril en Bruselas para poder estar durante las conversaciones que sostendrá el mandatario estadounidense, Donald Trump, con el líder chino, Xi Jinping, del 6 al 7 de abril en el complejo Mar-a-Lago de Trump en Florida, dijeron cuatro funcionarios y ex funcionarios estadounidenses.

Una portavoz del Departamento de Estado de Estados Unidos dijo que Tillerson se reunirá el miércoles con ministros de Relaciones Exteriores de 26 de los otros 27 miembros de la OTAN -todos, excepto Croacia- en un encuentro de la coalición que trabaja para derrotar al grupo militante Estado Islámico.

"Después de estas consultas y reuniones, en abril (Tillerson) viajará a una reunión del G-7 (Grupo de los Siete) en Italia y luego a reuniones en Rusia", agregó, y dijo que el subsecretario de Estado para Asuntos Políticos, Tom Shannon, representará a Estados Unidos en el encuentro de ministros de Relaciones Exteriores de la OTAN.

Eliot Engel, el congresista demócrata de más alto rango en el comité de Asuntos Exteriores de la Cámara de Representantes de Estados Unidos, opinó que Tillerson está cometiendo un error al no asistir a las conversaciones en Bruselas.

"El Gobierno de Donald Trump está cometiendo un grave error que afectará la confianza de la alianza más importante de Estados Unidos y provocará preocupaciones de que esta administración es simplemente demasiado amigable con (el presidente ruso) Vladimir Putin", afirmó Engel en un comunicado por escrito.

Un ex diplomático de la OTAN, que habló bajo condición de anonimato, dijo que era vital presentar un frente unido contra Moscú. La Organización del Tratado del Atlántico Norte (OTAN) fue creada en 1949 para servir como bastión frente a la Unión Soviética.

FOKUS 1-Insider - US-Außenminister lässt Nato-Treffen ausfallen - 路透新闻

{{20170321T090441.334+0000}}FOKUS 1-Insider - US-Außenminister lässt Nato-Treffen ausfallen* Insider: Tillerson trifft sich stattdessen mit Chinas Präsident

* Insider: Russland-Besuch im April geplant

(Neu: Details, Reaktionen)

Washington, 21. Mrz (Reuters) - US-Außenminister Rex Tillerson will Regierungskreisen zufolge am Treffen seiner Nato-Kollegen am 5. und 6. April in Brüssel nicht teilnehmen. Stattdessen wolle er bei den Gesprächen von Präsident Donald Trump mit dessen chinesischem Kollegen Xi Jinping am 6. und 7. April dabei sein, sagten am Montag mehrere Regierungsvertreter in Washington. Das Treffen findet auf Trumps Anwesen Mar-a-Lago in Florida statt. Für den 12. April plane Tillerson dann einen Besuch in Moskau. Frühere US-Regierungsvertreter äußerten die Sorge, dass diese Terminplanung womöglich Beunruhigung unter Verbündeten ihres Landes auslöst. Tillerson könne damit den Eindruck verstärken, dass die Vereinigten Staaten mit Russland anbändeln.

Eine Ministeriumssprecherin sagte, statt Tillerson solle Staatssekretär Tom Shannon nach Brüssel reisen. Der Außenminister selbst werde am Mittwoch an einem Treffen der Vertreter von 26 Nato-Staaten teilnehmen, bei dem über das Vorgehen gegen die Extremistenmiliz Islamischer Staat gesprochen werden solle. Im April wolle er nach Italien zu einem G7-Treffen und danach nach Russland fliegen. Das russische Außenministerium erklärte am Dienstag, es könne entsprechende Pläne Tillersons weder bestätigen noch dementieren.

Ein ehemaliger Nato-Diplomat und ein Ex-Regierungsvertreter der USA sagten, die Allianz habe angeboten, ihr Treffen so zu verschieben, dass es keine Überschneidungen mit dem Besuch Xis gebe. Das US-Außenministerium habe diese Idee aber zurückgewiesen. Bei der Opposition stießen die Pläne Tillersons auf Kritik. Der oberste Demokrat im Außenausschuss des Repräsentantenhauses, Eliot Engel, sprach von einem ernsthaften Fehler, der das Vertrauen in das wichtigste Bündnis der USA erschüttern und Sorgen schüren könnte, die Regierung Trumps könnte auf Kuschelkurs mit dem russischen Präsidenten Wladimir Putin gehen.

Die Bundespolizei FBI ermittelt derzeit, ob es Kontakte zwischen der Regierung in Moskau und Personen mit Verbindungen zu Trumps Wahlkampfteam gab.[nL5N1GX45D] Trump hat sich wiederholt lobend über Putin geäußert. In der Nato hatte Trump für Verunsicherung gesorgt mit der Äußerung, das Verteidigungsbündnis sei "obsolet". Bei einem Treffen mit Bundeskanzlerin Angela Merkel sagte Trump, er bekenne sich zur Nato. Zugleich mahnte er aber, dass die USA auf einer Entlastung durch die Nato-Partner bestünden.[nL5N1GU5VP] Tillerson hatte in seiner früheren Funktion als Spitzenmanager des Ölkonzerns Exxon Mobil jahrelang mit der russischen Regierung zusammengearbeitet.

ÖZEL HABER-ABD Dışişleri Bakanı Tillerson Rusya ziyareti için NATO bakanlar toplantısına katılmıyor  - 路透新闻

{{20170321T085222.244+0000}}ÖZEL HABER-ABD Dışişleri Bakanı Tillerson Rusya ziyareti için NATO bakanlar toplantısına katılmıyor Arshad Mohammed / John Walcott

WASHINGTON, 21 Mart (Reuters) - ABD Dışişleri Bakanı Rex Tillerson'ın gelecek ay NATO dışişleri bakanlarının yapacağı toplantıya katılmayacağı, o tarihlerde Çin Cumhurbaşkanı'nın ABD ziyaretini bekleyeceğini ve ardından da Nisan ayında Moskova'ya resmi bir ziyaret yapacağı açıklandı. Bu program NATO üyelerince, Tillerson'un Moskova ile ilişkilere ittifak ilişkilerinden daha fazla öncelik tanıdığı biçiminde yorumlanabilir.

Tillerson 28 NATO bakanının 5-6 Nisan'da Brüksel'de yapacağı toplantılara katılmayacak ve Başkan Donald Trump'ın 6-7 Nisan'da ABD'yi ziyaret edecek olan Çin Cumhurbaşkanı Xi Jinping ile Florida'da yapacağı görüşmelerde yer alacak. Amerikalı iki eski yetkili, bakanın NATO toplantısına gitmeyip onun yerine Moskova'yı ziyaret etmesinin Trump'ın büyük devletlerle ilişkileri, ittifakın önünde gördüğü algısını güçlendirebileceğini söylediler.

Bu program aynı zamanda güvenlik konusunda ABD'ye muhtaç olan küçük NATO üyelerini de tereddütte bırakabilir.

Trump'ın sıklıkla Rusya Devlet Başkanı Vladimir Putin'i övdüğü ve Tillerson'un da Exxon Mobil şirketinin CEO'su olduğu yıllarda Rus hükümetiyle yakın işbirliği yaptığı biliniyor. Tillerson Rusya'ya karşı uygulanan yaptırımları sorgulamış ve bunların ABD'nin ticari ilişkilerine zarar vereceğini söylemişti.

Bir dışişleri yetkilisi, Tillerson'un Çarşamba günü Hırvatistan hariç diğer 26 NATO üyesinin dışişleri bakanlarıyla, yapılacak toplantıda İslam Devleti ile mücadele konusunu görüşeceğini ancak NATO odaklı ayrı bir görüşme yapmayacağını söyledi ve ekledi:

"Bakan, bu görüşmelerden sonra Nisan ayında G7 toplantısı için İtalya'ya gidecek ve oradan görüşmeler için Rusya'ya geçecek."

NATO bakanlar toplantısında ABD'yi siyasi ilişkilerden sorumlu Bakan Yardımcısı Tom Shannon temsil edecek.

ABD Temsilciler Meclisi dış ilişkiler komitesi üyesi Demokrat Partili Eliot Engel, Tillerson'un Brüksel'de yapılacak NATO toplantısına gitmemesini eleştirdi.

Engel yaptığı yazılı açıklamada, "Donald Trump yönetimi Amerika'nın en önemli ittifakının güvenini sarsacak ve bu yönetimin (Rusya Devlet Başkanı Vladimir) Putin ile fazla yakın olduğu kaygılarını besleyecek vahim bir hata yapmaktadır" dedi.

Tillerson no asistirá a la reunión de la OTAN del 5 al 6 de abril en Bruselas para poder estar durante las conversaciones que sostendrá el mandatario estadounidense, Donald Trump, con el líder chino, Xi Jinping, del 6 al 7 de abril en el complejo Mar-a-Lago de Trump en Florida, dijeron cuatro funcionarios y ex funcionarios estadounidenses.

Saltarse la reunión de la OTAN y visitar Moscú podría avivar la percepción de que Trump está poniendo primero las relaciones de Estados Unidos con las grandes potencias, al tiempo que deja esperando a las naciones más pequeñas que dependen de Washington para su seguridad, dijeron dos ex funcionarios estadounidenses.

Trump a menudo ha elogiado al presidente ruso, Vladimir Putin, y Tillerson trabajó junto al Gobierno de Rusia cuando era un ejecutivo de alto rango de Exxon Mobil Corp , y ha puesto en duda la sabiduría de las sanciones contra Moscú que, dijo, pueden perjudicar a las firmas estadounidenses.

Insider - US-Außenminister will nicht an Nato-Treffen teilnehmen - 路透新闻

{{20170321T031020.607+0000}}Insider - US-Außenminister will nicht an Nato-Treffen teilnehmenWashington, 21. Mrz (Reuters) - US-Außenminister Rex Tillerson will Regierungskreisen zufolge am Treffen seiner Nato-Kollegen am 5. und 6. April in Brüssel nicht teilnehmen. Stattdessen wolle er bei den Gesprächen von Präsident Donald Trump mit dessen chinesischem Kollegen Xi Jinping am 6. und 7. April dabei sein, sagten am Montag mehrere Regierungsvertreter in Washington. Für den 12. April plane Tillerson dann einen Besuch in Moskau.

Frühere US-Regierungsvertreter äußerten die Sorge, dass diese Terminplanung womöglich Beunruhigung unter Verbündeten ihres Landes auslöst. Tillerson könne damit den Eindruck verstärken, dass die Vereinigten Staaten mit Russland anbändeln.

Die Bundespolizei FBI ermittelt derzeit, ob es Kontakte zwischen der Regierung in Moskau und Personen mit Verbindungen zu Trumps Wahlkampfteam gab.[nL5N1GX45D] Trump hat sich wiederholt lobend über seinen russischen Amtskollegen Wladimir Putin geäußert. In der Nato hatte Trump für Verunsicherung gesorgt mit der Äußerung, das Verteidigungsbündnis sei "obsolet". Tillerson hatte in seiner früheren Funktion als Spitzenmanager des Ölkonzerns Exxon Mobil jahrelang mit der russischen Regierung zusammengearbeitet.

Teens suing U.S. over climate change ask for Exxon's 'Wayne Tracker' emails - 路透新闻

{{20170320T181655.319+0000}}Teens suing U.S. over climate change ask for Exxon's 'Wayne Tracker' emailsBy Emily Flitter

NEW YORK, March 20 (Reuters) - Lawyers for a group of teenagers suing the U.S. government in a climate change case have asked the government and the oil industry's leading trade group to turn over emails sent and received by U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson using an alias address while he was running Exxon Mobil.

"It's possible that Rex Tillerson was communicating with people in government related to climate and energy policy using that email address," Julia Olson, a lawyer for the teenagers, said on Monday, referring to the alias address Wayne.Tracker@exxonmobil.com.

Tillerson left Exxon Mobil Corp, where he had been chief executive and chairman, in December, and also stepped down then as chairman of industry trade group the American Petroleum Institute.

New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman's office, which is probing whether Exxon misled shareholders and the public about climate change, wrote to a judge last week accusing the company of not previously disclosing the alias and Tillerson's communications through it. [nL2N1GQ1T7]

Exxon said in response to the attorney general's letter that the use of the alias was "entirely proper" and was aimed at giving priority to emails from a group of senior executives.[nL2N1GU01L]

The teenagers' case, filed in federal court in Oregon, seeks to prove government officials and oil industry leaders knew about the causes and effects of climate change but nevertheless carried on with policies that perpetuated it, violating Americans' constitutional right to live in a habitable climate.

The federal government has argued in court filings that there is no support for the claim that Americans are constitutionally entitled to a protected climate, while the API has said climate science is not firmly established enough to support the teenagers' case.

Spokespeople for the Justice Department, Exxon and the API did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

"Based on evidence we already have, it's pretty clear that Rex Tillerson, Exxon and API all knew that climate change was very significant and was being caused by burning fossil fuels," Olson said. "To the extent that we can get information through Wayne Tracker emails that they were openly acknowledging climate change was a big problem and trying to influence the government on how to deal with it, that helps our case."

The case is Juliana v. U.S., U.S. District Court, District of Oregon (Eugene), No. 15-cv-01517.

Dans les premières minutes après l'ouverture, l'indice Dow Jones <.DJI> perd 7,9 points, soit 0,04%, à 20.908,06 points. Le Standard & Poor's 500 <.SPX>, plus large, recule de 0,14% à 2.375 points et le Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> cède 0,07% à 5.896,89 points.

Le compartiment de l'énergie <.SPNY> perd 0,7%, dans le sillage du repli des cours du brut après l'annonce, vendredi, d'une hausse du nombre de forages aux Etats-Unis et des niveaux de production toujours élevés pour les pays membres de l'Opep.

Parmi les valeurs pétrolières, Chesapeake recule de 2,5% et Exxon Mobil perd 0,6%, tout comme Chevron .

Les investisseurs s'interrogent par ailleurs sur la politique commerciale extérieure de Donald Trump après la réunion du G20, vendredi et samedi, au terme de laquelle les Etats-Unis ont empêché que soit affichée dans le communiqué final une position commune sur le rejet du protectionnisme. [nL5N1GV0J4]

"Une politique protectionniste des Etats-Unis ferait plus de mal que de bien", estime Hussein Sayed, responsable de la stratégie chez FXTM.

Au sein du Nasdaq, Nektar Therapeutics bondit de 26,3% après les résultats encourageants d'une étude clinique sur un antalgique opioïde.

En Europe, les principales places boursières évoluent en baisse, le Stoxx 600 <.STOXX> cédant 0,1%. Les investisseurs européens se montrent peu enclins aux prises d'initiatives avant la tenue dans la soirée d'un débat télévisé entre les principaux candidats à l'élection présidentielle française.

Sur le marché des changes, le dollar est en légère baisse face à un panier de devises de référence <.DXY>, tandis que l'euro gagne 0,18% face au billet vert, à 1,0758.

De son côté, la livre sterling a effacé ses gains initiaux face au dollar pour retomber sous 1,24 dollar, alors que le gouvernement britannique a indiqué qu'il enclencherait la procédure officielle pour une sortie du pays de l'UE le 29 mars. [nL5N1GX36M]

Saudi king's Asia tour trumpets Aramco's moves downstream - 路透新闻

{{20170320T080010.386+0000}}Saudi king's Asia tour trumpets Aramco's moves downstream* Saudi king's lavish tour belies hardnosed oil strategy

* Aramco's $7 billion JV in Malaysian refinery key

* Deal with Malaysia's Petronas helps diversify Saudi Aramco

* It also gives Saudi's more leverage over oil product prices

* Deals seen helping Aramco valuation ahead of IPO

By Henning Gloystein

SINGAPORE, March 20 (Reuters) - Saudi King Salman's lavish tour of Asia, arriving in each country on a golden escalator with 400 tonnes of luggage, had a hardnosed marketing mission - to cement the kingdom's place as leading oil supplier to the world's biggest consumer region.

The string of deals inked on his three-week tour to Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan and China also point to a fresh strategy, one to increase Saudi leverage over refined product and petrochemical markets, known as the downstream sector.

"Our strategy is about growth in the downstream," said Amin Nasser, chief executive officer of state oil company Aramco, told Reuters on Sunday. "The growth in that sector is very important, and anything integrated between refining, petrochemical, with marketing and distribution, is of interest to us."

Saudi Arabia's main influence on oil markets has been via the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), of which it is the de-facto leader.

But OPEC's ability to control prices by turning the oil pumping spigots on and off has waned as non-OPEC producers like Russia and, more recently, U.S. shale drillers, have ramped up output and eroded its grip on market share. [nL3N1GU1GS]

One indication of a shift in Saudi strategy came on the first leg of the tour in Kuala Lumpur. Aramco signed a deal to take a $7 billion investment, in a joint venture with Malaysia's state oil company Petronas in a refinery and petrochemical project known as RAPID (Refinery and Petrochemical Integrated Development).[nL3N1GD2WX]

'THE WINDOW'

Under construction in Malaysia's southern Johor state, RAPID is just across a narrow strait from Singapore, Asia's oil trading hub. Some 70 percent of the oil for the project, set to start in 2019, will come from Saudi Arabia, giving the kingdom a key outlet for its crude in Asia, the world's fastest growing market. It is Armaco's largest refinery project outside the kingdom.

Aramco also recently made a deal with Indonesia's Pertamina over a $5 billion expansion of the country's largest oil refinery, for which Armaco will supply the crude.

"The investments are intended to enhance Aramco's competitive position in Southeast Asia," said Ihsan Buhulaiga, a Saudi economist.

The Malaysian investment also allows the Saudis to join the hub of refineries in and around Singapore that help determine fuel prices in the region.

Price agency S&P Global Platts assesses dozens of fuel products during a set time every day, based on deliveries in and out of this region. Platts calls it Market-on-Close, but traders dub it "the window", and it influences pricing of oil products worth billions of dollars each day.

While crude and fuel products by many companies flow in and out of the pricing region, known as FOB Straits. But the only refineries now in this price region are operated by U.S. Exxon , Anglo-Dutch Royal Dutch Shell , and Singapore Petroleum Corp (SPC), owned by PetroChina <601857.SS>.

"When you control refining capacity with the capability to deliver petroleum products into the window, you have access to a physical outlet which also plays a key role in daily price discovery," said John Driscoll, director of consultancy JTD Energy in Singapore.

ARAMCO IPO

The Saudi move deeper into refineries and petrochemical plants would likely help the potential valuation of Aramco in what could be the world's largest-ever initial public offering.

Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who oversees the kingdom's economic policy, has said the sale is expected to value Aramco at $2 trillion or more. Analysts have estimated a valuation between $1 trillion and $1.5 trillion.

Singapore, along with Hong Kong and Tokyo have been mentioned as possible exchanges where Aramco's shares would be traded. The primary listing will be on Saudi Arabia's domestic exchange, and Riyadh is also looking at New York or London for the secondary listing.

Aramco's joint ventures in Malaysia, Indonesia and elsewhere are not only aimed at increasing its refining capacity. Its new deals in the region would also greatly increase its participation in the petrochemical sector, which involves all forms of plastics and where profits have soared thanks to strong demand.

"We have capacity of about 5.4 million barrels per day of participated refining capacity, and our target is to reach 10 million barrels by 2030," Aramco's Nasser said.

Ultimately, the big prize is China, where the Saudis signed deals that could be worth as much as $65 billion during the last leg of the king's Asian tour, covering energy, manufacturing and even a theme park in the kingdom.

The deals included a memorandum of understanding between Aramco and China North Industries Group Corp (Norinco) to look into building refining and petrochemical plants in China.

John Sfakianakis, director of the Riyadh-based Gulf Research Centre, said that the trip was "the beginning of a long-term strategy of Saudi Arabia to open itself to Asian investors and vice versa" as part of its Vision 2030 policy to diversify its economy beyond crude exports.

Australia threatens gas majors with 'action' to avert domestic shortage - 路透新闻

{{20170319T002338.552+0000}}Australia threatens gas majors with 'action' to avert domestic shortageBy Harry Pearl

SYDNEY, March 19 (Reuters) - Australia's minister for resources said on Sunday that the government would take action to avert an energy shortage if big gas producers did not boost supply for the country's domestic market.

Australia is on track to become the world's largest exporter of liquefied natural gas (LNG), yet its energy market operator has warned of a domestic gas crunch from 2019 that could trigger industry supply cuts and broad power outages.

Major gas producers, including Exxon Mobil Corp and Royal Dutch Shell , who have large export contracts, guaranteed to ensure gas was available for the domestic market during crisis talks with the government this week. [nL3N1GT12M]

"If the commitments are not met, if we don't see more gas, we'll act, we'll take decisions in our national interest to secure our nation's energy supplies," Resources Minister Matt Canavan, who was at the talks, told The ABC on Sunday.

Australia's power supply problems made international headlines last week when Tesla Inc boss Elon Musk offered to save South Australia, the country's most renewable-energy dependent state, from blackouts by installing large-scale battery storage. [nL3N1GN2W8]

Manufacturers have long complained of tight gas supplies and soaring prices as producers have focused on supplying gas to LNG plants that have locked in 20-year export contracts. Restrictions on drilling coal seam gas have added to supply constraints.

Producers blame state drilling bans, uncertainty over Australia's climate policy and, more recently, potential increases in petroleum producer taxes, for deterring development of new gas fields.

Canavan, who did not elaborate on what action would be taken, said the companies had given strong commitments to the government.

"This is what every nation around the world would do. The gas industry understand that. That's what we need to see delivered," he said.

U.S. drillers add oil rigs for 9th week in a row -Baker Hughes - 路透新闻

{{20170317T170617.672+0000}}U.S. drillers add oil rigs for 9th week in a row -Baker HughesMarch 17 (Reuters) - U.S. drillers added oil rigs for a
ninth week in a row, extending a recovery that is expected to
boost shale production by the most in six-months in April.

Drillers added 14 oil rigs in the week to March 17, bringing
the total count up to 631, the most since September 2015, energy
services firm Baker Hughes Inc  said on Friday.

During the same week a year ago, there were 387 active oil
rigs.

That rig count increase came despite a collapse in crude
futures over the past two weeks to a more than three-month low
because the rigs activated this week were based on decisions
made a couple of month ago when oil prices were higher.

U.S. crude futures  were at about $49 a barrel on
Friday, set for a modest weekly rise after falling 9 percent
last week on concerns production cuts by the Organization of the
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) was failing to reduce a
global glut as U.S. shale producers crank up activity. [O/R]

Since crude prices first topped $50 in May after recovering
from 13-year lows in February 2016, drillers have added a total
of 315 oil rigs in 38 of the past 42 weeks, the biggest recovery
in rigs since a global oil glut crushed the market over two
years starting in mid 2014.

Baker Hughes oil rig count plunged from a record 1,609 in
October 2014 to a six-year low of 316 in May 2016 as U.S. crude
collapsed from over $107 a barrel in June 2014 to near $26 in
February 2016.

U.S. shale oil production in April was projected to rise
109,000 barrels per day (bpd), the biggest monthly rise in six
months, to 4.96 million bpd as output in the Permian Basin,
America's fastest growing shale oil region, hits another record
high, according government data on Monday. [nL2N1GQ14W]

U.S. crude inventories edged down from record highs last
week, after nine straight weeks of builds, while overall
production was projected to rise from 8.9 million bpd in 2016 to
9.2 million bpd in 2017 and a record high of 9.6 million bpd in
2018, according to federal energy data. [EIA/S][nL2N1GK17S]

Analysts said they expect U.S. energy firms to boost
spending on drilling and pump more oil and natural gas from
shale fields in coming years now that energy prices are expected
to keep climbing.

Futures for the balance of 2017  and calendar 2018
 were both trading around $50 a barrel.

Analysts at Simmons & Co, energy specialists at U.S.
investment bank Piper Jaffray, this week forecast the total oil
and gas rig count would average 818 in 2017, 937 in 2018 and
1,048 in 2019. Most wells produce both oil and gas.

That compares with an average of 729 so far in 2017, 509 in
2016 and 978 in 2015, according to Baker Hughes data.

Analysts at U.S. financial services firm Cowen & Co said in
a note this week that its capital expenditure tracking showed 54
exploration and production (E&P) companies planned to increase
spending by an average of 50 percent in 2017 over 2016.

That expected spending increase in 2017 followed an
estimated 48 percent decline in 2016 and a 34 percent decline in
2015, Cowen said according to the 64 E&P companies it tracks.

LONDRES, 17 mars (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil cherche à vendre la moitié des 2.500 stations-service qu'il possède en Italie, une opération qui pourrait représenter jusqu'à 500 millions d'euros, ont rapporté plusieurs sources proches du dossier vendredi.

Après Royal Dutch Shell , Total et Erg , le groupe pétrolier américain, via sa filiale Esso, tente de réduire son exposition au marché surdimensionné des stations-service.

Le géant anglo-néerlandais s'est retiré l'année dernière et le groupe français et l'italien Erg s'apprêtent à vendre leur coentreprise TotalErg. [nL8N1FZ7LD]

Selon des sources bancaires, le fonds d'investissement Apollo envisage de racheter à la fois le réseau d'Esso et les 2.600 stations-service de TotalErg afin de rationaliser son portefeuille et d'augmenter ses profits.

L'une de ces sources a indiqué que d'autres fonds d'investissement, dont Carlyle , étaient également intéressés par le réseau d'Esso.

L'Italie compte environ 21.000 stations-service, soit près de deux fois plus que la France et quasiment trois fois plus que la Grande-Bretagne.

Au cours des deux dernières années, le gouvernement italien a cherché à réduire le nombre de stations-service pour adapter le marché à la demande et rendre le secteur plus rentable.

Exxon n'a pas répondu à une demande de commentaire.

Cyprus approves Eni, Total, Exxon offshore block deals - 路透新闻

{{20170317T135407.822+0000}}Cyprus approves Eni, Total, Exxon offshore block dealsATHENS, March 17 (Reuters) - Cyprus's cabinet on Friday approved contracts with France's Total , Italy's Eni , Exxon Mobil and Qatar Petroleum to explore for oil and gas in offshore areas south of the island, officials said.

Exploring the Mediterranean's Levant Basin has become more attractive since Eni discovered Egypt's offshore Zohr field in 2015, the biggest gas field in the Mediterranean and estimated to contain 850 billion cubic metres of gas. The Cypriot concessions cover exploration rights for three offshore blocks off the south and southwestern coast and contracts would be signed on April 5 and 6, Energy Minister Georgios Lakkotrypis said.

Eni and Total are in a consortium for one of the blocks and ExxonMobil and Qatar have joined up for another. Eni will be on its own in a third block. The blocks were offered in the third licensing round held by Cyprus.

Total, which won rights for another block in a previous licensing round, planned to conduct drilling this year in Block 11, which borders the Zohr discovery, Lakkotrypis said.

Eni said last week said it had finalised a deal with Total to buy a 50 percent interest in Block 11, with Total remaining the operator. [nI6N1GC00Z]

The Italian firm planned to drill twice this year, Lakkotrypis said. "Precisely what block has not yet been defined, that will be acertained with greater clarity by seismic data," he added.

Noble Energy of the U.S. made Cyprus's first natural gas discovery offshore in 2011.

Exxon punta a vendere la metà dei distributori Esso in Italia - fonti - 路透新闻

{{20170317T124908.717+0000}}Exxon punta a vendere la metà dei distributori Esso in Italia - fontiLONDRA, 17 marzo (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil sta cercando di cedere la metà dei suoi 2.500 distribuitori di benzina in Italia per una cifra fino a 500 milioni di euro.

Lo riferiscono diverse fonti a conoscenza delle vicenda.

Attraverso la controllata Esso, Exxon è l'ultima delle società petrolifere che sta cercando di ridurre l'esposizione nel settore in Italia. Royal Dutch Shell è uscita l'anno scorso e Total ed Erg sono vicine a vendere la loro joint venture.

Secondo un certo numero di fonti bancarie, la società di private equity Apollo sta valutando l'acquisizione sia delle stazioni Esso che Total/Erg, per razionalizzare il portafoglio e ottenere migliori profitti.

Una delle fonti ha riferito che anche altri gruppi di private equity, compreso Carlyle , hanno mostrato interesse per i distributori Esso.

In Italia ci sono circa 21.000 stazioni di servizio, quasi il doppo della Francia e il triplo della Gran Bretagna.

Negli ultimi due anni, il governo ha cercato di tagliare il numero dei distributori per portarli in linea con la domanda e rendere l'industria più efficiente.

Al momento Exxon non ha risposto a una richiesta di commento. Generalmente non usa advisor esterni per le attività di m&a e non è chiaro se si appoggi ad una banca per questa transazione.

Exxon eyes sale of Italian service stations -sources - 路透新闻

{{20170317T122243.993+0000}}Exxon eyes sale of Italian service stations -sourcesBy Ron Bousso and Clara Denina

LONDON, March 17 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil is seeking to sell half of its 2,500 petrol stations in Italy for up to 500 million euros ($537 million), several sources close to the process said.

Exxon, through its local subsidiary Esso, is the latest oil company trying to reduce its exposure to Italy's oversupplied petrol retail sector. Royal Dutch Shell exited last year and Total and Italian energy group Erg are nearing the sale of their joint venture.[nL8N1FZ7DB][nI6N18900U]

According to a number of banking sources, private equity firm Apollo is considering acquiring both the Esso and Total/Erg's 2,600 stations to allow it to rationalise the portfolio and squeeze better profits.

One of the banking sources said that other private equity groups, including Carlyle have shown interest in buying the Esso branded stations.

Italy has around 21,000 service stations across the country, almost twice the number in France and almost three times that of Britain.

Over the past two years, the government has been seeking to cut the number of stations to bring them into line with demand and make the industry more efficient.

Exxon did not immediately respond to a request for comment. It generally doesn't use external advisors for M&A activity and it was unclear if it had hired a bank for this transaction.

Ownership of Norway's Nyhamna gas export plant to expand - 路透新闻

{{20170317T120644.092+0000}}Ownership of Norway's Nyhamna gas export plant to expand* Nyhamna can export up to 20 pct of Britain's gas needs

* Plant's ownership could rise to 13 firms from five

* Shell set to relinquish operatorship to Gassco

By Lefteris Karagiannopoulos

OSLO, March 17 (Reuters) - The ownership of Norway's Nyhamna gas-processing plant, a major supplier of energy to Britain, could expand to 13 companies this year from five now when Gassco succeeds Royal Dutch Shell as the facility's operator, Shell told Reuters.

Currently processing gas from the offshore Ormen Lange field, Nyhamna will also receive gas from Statoil's Aasta Hansteen and other fields from late 2018 via the new Polarled pipeline.

The plant exports gas to Britain via the Langeled pipeline, which can meet about 20 percent of Britain's gas needs.

A new ownership structure will reflect the addition of more gas input sources, allowing the Polarled owners to take stakes in the plant, Gassco said.

"We can confirm that the Nyhamna gas plant will become part of a new joint venture," said a Gassco spokeswoman, declining to comment on how the ownership will be split.

Gassco said Shell was expected to remain technical service provider (TSP) at Nyhamna, meaning the company will continue to handle daily operations, similar to the TSP role Statoil plays at the Gassco-operated Kaarstoe and Kollsnes gas plants.

"Shell is one of 13 parties with future ownership interests," Shell said in an email to Reuters, declining to elaborate further on the process.

The Nyhamna plant is currently owned by Ormen Lange license partners Norway's Petoro, Statoil, Shell, Denmark's DONG Energy and ExxonMobil .

Potential future owners include France's Total , Wintershall [WINT.UL], the oil and gas subsidiary of Germany's BASF , Italy's Edison , ConocoPhillips and Austria's OMV .

Norway's oil and energy ministry must approve the new ownership structure and set gas transportation tariffs that will ultimately impact the profitability of the pipelines and processing system.

"The decision (on tariffs) will be made before start-up of operations of the new facilities ... after a proposal is sent on public consultation," a ministry spokesman said.

RPT-Trump's proposal to scrap Chemical Safety Board draws criticism  - 路透新闻

{{20170317T110001.870+0000}}RPT-Trump's proposal to scrap Chemical Safety Board draws criticism (Repeats story that ran earlier with no change to headline or text)

By Gary McWilliams

March 17 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump's proposal to do away with the federal agency that investigates chemical accidents drew sharp criticism from environmental, labor and safety advocates, who said that eliminating the watchdog would put American lives at risk.

Christine Todd Whitman, the former U.S. Environmental Protection Agency head, on Thursday called the proposal to get rid of Chemical Safety Board (CSB) and cut EPA funding short-sighted, saying both have long been an industry target for advocating greater public information on chemicals.

"If you want to put the American people in danger this is the way to do it," she said of the president's proposal to cut the CSB's funding entirely from the 2018 federal budget. "The chemical industry has fought back from the beginning."

The CSB investigates major chemicals accidents to search for their causes and makes recommendations that could prevent a recurrence. It has no regulatory power, but is influential because its recommendations are often adopted by industry, labor, government officials, the EPA and Occupational Safety and Health Administration.

The president on Thursday outlined a plan for fiscal 2018 discretionary spending, which exclude programs like Social Security, that removes allocations for 19 independent bodies, including the CSB and Corporation for Public Broadcasting.

The CSB, which has an annual budget of about $12 million, defended its work, saying its work has broadly improved safety. "As this process moves forward, we hope that the important mission of this agency will be preserved," the agency said in a statement.

Chemical and energy industry officials offered limited comment on the proposal. Petroleum and refining industry groups, Exxon Mobil Corp , BP plc and Tesoro Corp did not respond or declined to comment directly on the potential phase out.

The American Chemistry Council, a trade group that represents major chemicals producers, said in a statement it would work with the administration and Congress to "ensure EPA has funding to carry out essential responsibilities." It did not comment directly on the CSB.

The American Petroleum Institute, the oil industry trade group, said it looked "forward to working with the administration and Congress as all of these issues work their way through the budget process."

Michael Wright, director of health, safety and environment at the United Steelworkers union, said the CSB's recommendations generally have been welcome by labor and industry. One such recommendation that stemmed from a fatal 2005 refinery incident included barring portable trailers that cannot withstand an explosion.

The board's reviews of major accidents have proved significant. Its probes have led to industry standards on worker fatigue, greater reporting of hazardous chemicals to first responders, and have prompted companies to keep workers not directly involved in projects out of harm's way.

In California, many of the board's safety recommendations have been drafted into law. For example, the state worker safety agency, known as Cal/OSHA, has doubled its investigative staff based on CSB recommendations.

"This is one of the best bargains in Washington," said the USW's Wright. "If it has prevented even one accident, it has saved far more money than its budget over its entire history."

Its probe of the fatal Deepwater Horizon rig explosion was controversial because of its two-year length and extensive need for outside help. The work led to new standards for safety in the offshore oil industry and in well equipment.

But some recommendations have not been yet been implemented. After a fatal 2013 explosion in West, Texas, that killed 12 first responders the CSB proposed facilities that store large amounts of fertilizer be covered by emergency planning laws that give first responders more information. That remains open.

Beth Rosenberg, a former CSB board member and now an assistant professor at Tufts University School of Medicine, said the CSB "does excellent work; other countries admire this agency." She said opponents "don't know what they're doing here or how useful this board is."

UPDATE 2-Tillerson's use of email alias at Exxon 'entirely proper' - Exxon attorneys - 路透新闻

{{20170317T034325.859+0000}}UPDATE 2-Tillerson's use of email alias at Exxon 'entirely proper' - Exxon attorneys(Adds background in eighth paragraph)

March 16 (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson's use of an alias email address while he was chief executive at Exxon Mobil Corp was "entirely proper," attorneys representing the company said in a letter to a New York court on Thursday.

New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who is investigating whether Exxon misled shareholders and the public about climate change, wrote to a judge on Monday accusing Exxon of not previously disclosing the alias and Tillerson's communications through it. [nL2N1GR19O]

Tillerson had used the alias email address while at the oil company to send and receive information related to climate change and other matters. [nL2N1GQ1T7]

"It (alias email address) allowed a limited group of senior executives to send time-sensitive messages to Mr. Tillerson that received priority over the normal daily traffic that crossed the desk of a busy CEO. The purpose was efficiency, not secrecy," attorneys at the law firm Paul Weiss Rifkind Wharton & Garrison LLP said. (http://bit.ly/2ntj6mk)

Had Tillerson set up the alias email address with the purpose of "secrecy," emails to the account would have avoided any reference to Tillerson as the intended recipient, the attorneys said.

"Obtaining publicity, not information, appears to have been the real goal of the New York Attorney General's March 13 letter," the attorneys said.

The New York Attorney General's March 13 letter asked the judge to order Exxon to explain whether documents from the alias email and 34 additional accounts assigned to other Exxon executives and board members had been preserved.

Exxon has provided 2.5 million pages of documents in response to a subpoena from Schneiderman's office, but those documents include only 160 emails from Exxon management.

"More than 16 months after receiving our subpoena, Exxon is just now admitting it may not have preserved or produced the emails of its former CEO, who used an alias email account. We look forward to addressing these, and the other issues our letter raised, in court," Amy Spitalnick, press secretary at the office of the New York attorney general, said in an email.

UPDATE 1-Unpaid wages, sackings stir new tension in Nigeria's oil hub - 路透新闻

{{20170316T175519.853+0000}}UPDATE 1-Unpaid wages, sackings stir new tension in Nigeria's oil hub* Niger Delta region mired in poverty, conflict

* Government is trying to broker a peace deal with militants

* Sackings of oil workers, delayed wages threaten stability

* Oil majors blame late payments from state

(Adds Eni comments)

By Tife Owolabi and Libby George

PORT HARCOURT, Nigeria/LONDON, March 16 (Reuters) - The moment a group of Nigerian contractors met executives from Italian oil major Eni to discuss unpaid wages they started shouting, calling them fraudsters and liars until a police commander restored calm.

Wenenda Mpi, local manager of Eni unit Agip, blamed the payment delays on debts owed by the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), a view shared by an Eni spokesman in Rome, and said the government had promised to sort the problem out.

The heated meeting, called after hundreds of Eni contractors threatened a protest that police feared could turn violent, highlights the challenge of stabilising the Niger Delta oil region, even though attacks on oil facilities have halted.

Militants were persuaded to stop the attacks by promises of more investment and jobs from visiting officials including Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, a technocrat who stood in for President Muhammadu Buhari this year while he had seven weeks of medical treatment in London.

That has helped restore output to close to its former level 2.2 million barrels a day (bpd) from the 1.15 million bpd it hit last year. But it is unclear how long the calm will last.

Protests like that against Eni in the region's biggest city Port Harcourt are common, partly because low global oil prices mean oil firms are firing hundreds of workers and cutting back on contractors such as welders, security guards and cooks.

The Eni contractors showed up on time at the city's police headquarters for the meeting brokered by a local police commander, and tempers were high by the time three Agip managers and the police boss arrived more than an hour later.

"We are giving Agip a two week ultimatum to pay all outstanding debt," said Clement Adaminegbe, head of contractors at Agip, threatening unspecified further action. "In case of failure we will take a clear stand."

Mpi promised to look into the grievances but was shouted down by the workers until the Commissioner of Police Zaki Ahmed stepped in - persuading them to meet again next week in the presence of an Italian manager.

"I want both parties to resolve the issue amicably," he said, addressing the stone-faced protesters at the meeting attended by a Reuters reporter.

EXPECTATIONS

Since the start of the year, Vice President Osinbajo has been going back and forth to the swamp lands, promising to drag the region's population out of poverty with a bigger share of Nigeria's huge oil wealth.

Residents say Osinbajo, a Christian like most in the southern region, has connected much better with them than Buhari, a Muslim from the north, who last year sent the army to hunt down militants and has only visited the region once.

Osinbajo has proposed legalising illegal oil refineries to ensure employment for angry youths who often join militants, although a military campaign to hunt them down has continued.

The future of the fragile peace will depend on whether the government follows up on such proposals at a time when Africa's biggest economy is hit by its first recession in 25 years.

State oil firm NNPC has been planning for two years to pay back funds owed to oil majors for joint oil operations. The government said in December a remaining $5.1 billion would be paid back in five years, a time scale which means tensions over payments on the ground will likely continue.

An Eni spokesman said payment delays from NNPC had been accumulating for 15 years, but they expected repayments to resume this year.

Locals are demanding that oil majors relocate their headquarters to the region – a move that most are loath to make due to security concerns.

A spokesman for Eni said 90 percent of its Nigerian subsidiary's workforce were already based in the Delta. A spokesperson for Shell's Nigeria unit said they had no such plans, Chevron and Exxon declined to comment on any relocation.

CASH

The oil swamps are home to 40 ethnic groups competing for a share of oil money, a major obstacle to reaching an agreement that would put a permanent end to attacks on oil facilities.

"There's a kind of cycle of violence in the Delta," said Anthony Goldman of Nigeria-focused Promedia Consulting. "It's not just about paying people off. This money is there – it's in the budget. It's really about what the situation is on the ground."

Villages fight for contracts, forcing oil firms to recruit only their youth as guards or risk pipelines being blown up by rejected hires. Or they demand firms to buy food or cement from them and block passage of vehicles if they bring in supplies from other villages, oil workers say.

"The issue of surveillance contracts is not working well, we will revisit it," the Agip manager said at the meeting, referring to security contracts with host communities.

The protesters handed the Agip delegation a list of 16 demands including a cash payment of 10 million naira ($32,000) to "demobilise" the planned protest. They also want to get 60 percent of future work tendered by Agip. Eni said its contracts were awarded on a competitive basis.

Officials have repeatedly visited the biggest Delta group of Ijaw from which the Niger Delta Avengers, the biggest militant group, recruits. That has not gone down well with other groups.

"If the people of the upland part of the region are not treated with same level of respect as those in the creeks, there will never be security for the oil assets you so much cherish," the militant group Niger Delta Greenland Justice Mandate said in a statement last week.

Shell has been reluctant to reopen the only key pipeline that is still down – Trans Forcados – and oil traders say there are still worries from buyers about the reliability of Nigeria's exports, given the security problems. [nL5N1GC55R]

Locals hope Buhari will allow Osinbajo to continue his peace efforts in the Niger Delta after he resumed work on Monday following his medical leave.

"Osinbajo ... was working hard to return peace," said Austin Ozobo, a Delta activist. "Our fear is that things may get worse with the return of President Buhari, certain steps or modalities taken by the (former) acting President Osinbajo to restore peace in the region may be abandoned."

RPT-UPDATE 3-Australia hauls in gas majors to avert local shortage - 路透新闻

{{20170316T011039.896+0000}}RPT-UPDATE 3-Australia hauls in gas majors to avert local shortage(Repeats to additional subscribers)

* Australian PM in crisis talks with gas majors

* Australia faces gas shortage despite exports soaring

* Manufacturers desperate for cheaper gas

By Sonali Paul

SYDNEY, March 15 (Reuters) - Australia's top gas producers, led by ExxonMobil Corp and Royal Dutch Shell , agreed to boost supply to the country's domestic market to help avert an energy shortage following crisis talks with Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.

Australia is on track to become the world's largest exporter of liquified natural gas (LNG), yet its energy market operator has warned of a domestic gas crunch from 2019 that could trigger industry supply cuts and broad power outages.

"We are a massive gas exporter. It is utterly untenable - unacceptable - for us to be in a position where domestic gas consumers ... cannot have access to affordable gas," Turnbull told reporters on Wednesday after the meeting.

He said the producers had guaranteed to ensure that gas would be available for the national electricity market.

Australia's power supply problems made international headlines last week when Tesla Inc boss Elon Musk offered to save South Australia, the country's most renewable-energy dependent state, from blackouts by installing large-scale battery storage.

The South Australian government on Tuesday outlined plans to spend A$510 million ($385 million) to keep the lights on, including A$150 million to encourage the development of 100 megawatts of battery storage. [nL3N1GQ32M]

Australian manufacturers have long complained of tight gas supplies and soaring prices as producers have focused on supplying gas to LNG plants that have locked in 20-year export contracts. Three LNG plants have opened in the country over the past two years, which has tripled gas demand and sent gas prices rocketing from around A$6 a gigajoule (GJ) to as much as $22/GJ.

"That's apocalyptic as far as the cost structures of energy-intensive manufacturers are concerned," Tennant Reed, policy adviser at the Australian Industry Group, said at a gas outlook conference this week.

RESERVATION CALL

Companies like top Australian steel maker BlueScope Steel , fertiliser maker Incitec Pivot and packaging maker Orora Group have urged the government to reserve gas for the domestic market or risk losing thousands of jobs as plants shut.

Both sides of government have resisted a domestic gas reservation, acknowledging that would create sovereign risk for existing projects and threaten future investment in the country, but Turnbull left the door open to imposing a domestic quota.

"We've made considerable progress today, but there is more work to be done. But the considerable powers the Commonwealth has are obviously ones that we would never shirk from using in the national interest," he said.

Shell, which runs the Queensland Curtis LNG plant (QCLNG) and is sitting on undeveloped coal seam gas in the state, said it has sold significant volumes into southeastern Australia.

Diverting gas from LNG plants into the domestic market would be the easiest short-term solution, as two of the three LNG plants in Queensland - Shell's QCLNG and Origin and ConocoPhillips' Australia Pacific LNG (APLNG) - have some capacity that is not locked into export contracts.

Turnbull said both QCLNG and APLNG had committed to being net suppliers to the domestic market, while Santos' Gladstone LNG, which is short of gas, had taken the request on notice.

A challenge, however, would be finding space on the gas pipeline network, said Saul Kavonic, an analyst at Wood Mackenzie.

Producers blame state drilling bans, uncertainty over Australia's climate policy and, more recently, potential increases in petroleum producer taxes, for deterring development of new gas fields.

Companies also reined in spending on exploration and development after the oil price collapse in 2014.

UPDATE 1-Trump seeks input from U.S. energy companies on Paris climate pact - 路透新闻

{{20170315T162808.641+0000}}UPDATE 1-Trump seeks input from U.S. energy companies on Paris climate pact(Adds comment from coal association, paragraphs 10 and 15; quote from Trump's 100-day action plan in paragraph 7)

By Valerie Volcovici and Timothy Gardner

WASHINGTON, March 15 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump's administration has been contacting U.S. energy companies to ask them about their views on the U.N. global climate accord, according to two sources with knowledge of the effort, a sign Trump is reconsidering his 2016 campaign pledge to back out of the deal.

The sources, who asked not to be named because they are not authorized to speak publicly on the subject, said many of the companies reached by the administration had said they would prefer the United States remain in the pact, but would also support reducing U.S. commitments in the deal.

The accord, agreed by nearly 200 countries in Paris in 2015, would limit planetary warming in part by slashing carbon dioxide and other emissions from the burning of fossil fuels. As part of the deal, the United States committed to reducing its emissions by between 26 and 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025.

The sources did not name the companies contacted.

One of the sources said the companies were "publicly traded fossil fuel companies," and added the White House would consider their input in making a decision on the Paris accord shortly. The source said the White House has been leading the discussions with the fossil fuel companies and the State Department, which represents the United States in climate negotiations, had not taken part.

A White House official declined to comment.

Trump has called climate change a hoax and vowed during his campaign for the White House to "cancel the Paris Climate Agreement" within 100 days, claiming it would be too costly for the U.S. economy.

Since being elected he has been mostly quiet on the issue. In a New York Times interview in November he said he would keep an open mind about the Paris deal. He and members of his family and inner circle also met with climate change advocate and former Vice President Al Gore in December.

Officials for Exxon Mobil , ConocoPhillips , Chevron , Peabody Energy Corp and others did not immediately comment when asked about whether they had been contacted by the White House about the Paris accord.

But several, including Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips, have expressed public support for the pact. The World Coal Association, which represents Peabody and other miners, has also said it supports the deal.

OIL COMPANY SUPPORT

Exxon Mobil Chief Executive Darren Woods recently called the pledges that came out of the Paris agreement an "effective framework" for dealing with emissions, and pointed to Exxon's own work to cut its carbon emissions.

In comments on Exxon's website, Woods wrote: "I believe, and my company believes, that climate risks warrant action and it's going to take all of us – business, governments and consumers – to make meaningful progress."

Rex Tillerson, Exxon's former CEO and now U.S. Secretary of State, also supported remaining a part of the climate change discussion during his confirmation hearing. He said he did not see climate change as an imminent national security threat but said the U.S. would be "better served by being at that table" and remaining a party to climate change negotiations.

Conoco CEO Ryan Lance similarly said he favored the U.S. remaining in the Paris agreement, during CERAWeek comments last week, in part because it could create opportunities for its natural gas operations and its investments in carbon-capture and storage.

Benjamin Sporton, the president of the World Coal Association, had a similar stance: "With a number of well-developed carbon capture and storage projects, the United States is already a global leader in cleaner coal technology. Given the role given to low emissions coal technology in the Paris Agreement by many developing economies, there are clear benefits to remaining within the agreement."

J. Robinson West, former chairman of Magellan Petroleum Corp., and now a managing director at Boston Consulting Group, said President Trump's anti-Paris accord sentiments probably reflected his dealings with the CEOs of smaller companies that operate only in the U.S.

"The independents are anti-climate change ... all this stuff costs them money. The global companies operate all over the world. They have to operate at one standard - the highest standard - wherever they operate," he said.

Global oil companies have spent heavily on environmental initiatives in recent years. Exxon Mobil, for example, logged $4.9 billion in environmental spending in 2016, about 2.24 percent of total revenue, according to its annual report with the Securities and Exchanges Commission. ConocoPhillips spent $627 million, or 2.57 percent of revenue.

Trump seeks input from U.S. energy companies on Paris climate pact - 路透新闻

{{20170315T154053.851+0000}}Trump seeks input from U.S. energy companies on Paris climate pactBy Valerie Volcovici and Timothy Gardner

WASHINGTON, March 15 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump's administration has been contacting U.S. energy companies to ask them about their views on the U.N. global climate accord, according to two sources with knowledge of the effort, a sign Trump is reconsidering his 2016 campaign pledge to back out of the deal.

The sources, who asked not to be named because they are not authorized to speak publicly on the subject, said many of the companies reached by the administration had said they would prefer the United States remain in the pact, but would also support reducing the U.S. commitments in the deal.

The accord, agreed by nearly 200 countries in Paris in 2015, would limit planetary warming in part by slashing carbon dioxide and other emissions from the burning of fossil fuels. As part of the deal, the United States committed to reducing its emissions by between 26 and 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025.

The sources did not name the companies contacted.

One of the sources said the companies were "publicly traded fossil fuel companies," and added the White House would consider their input in making a decision on the Paris accord shortly. The source said the White House has been leading the discussions with the fossil fuel companies and the State Department, which represents the United States in climate negotiations, had not taken part.

A White House official declined to comment.

Trump has called climate change a hoax and vowed during his campaign for the White House to pull the U.S. out of the Paris deal, claiming it would be too costly for the U.S. economy.

Since being elected he has been mostly quiet on the issue. In a New York Times interview in November he said he would keep an open mind about the Paris deal. He and members of his family and inner circle also met with climate change advocate and former Vice President Al Gore in December.

Officials for Exxon Mobil , ConocoPhillips , Chevron , Peabody Energy Corp and others did not immediately comment when asked about whether they had been contacted by the White House about the Paris accord.

But several, including Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips, have expressed public support for the pact.

J. Robinson West, former chairman of Magellan Petroleum Corp., and now a managing director at Boston Consulting Group, says President Trump's anti-Paris accord sentiments probably reflect his dealings with the CEOs of smaller oil companies that operate only in the U.S., not the major oil companies.

"There are two classes of companies – the independents, which are much more influential with this administration, and the global oil companies. The independents are anti-climate change ... all this stuff costs them money. The global companies operate all over the world. They have to operate at one standard - the highest standard - wherever they operate."

Global oil companies have spent heavily on environmental regulation compliance in recent years. Exxon Mobil, for example, logged $4.9 billion in environmental spending in 2016, about 2.24 percent of total revenue, according to its annual report with the Securities and Exchange Commission. ConocoPhillips, meanwhile, spent $627 million, or 2.57 percent of revenue.

UPDATE 3-Australia hauls in gas majors to avert local shortage - 路透新闻

{{20170315T064055.396+0000}}UPDATE 3-Australia hauls in gas majors to avert local shortage* Australian PM in crisis talks with gas majors

* Australia faces gas shortage despite exports soaring

* Manufacturers desperate for cheaper gas

(Recasts with result of meeting, fresh quotes)

By Sonali Paul

SYDNEY, March 15 (Reuters) - Australia's top gas producers, led by ExxonMobil Corp and Royal Dutch Shell , agreed to boost supply to the country's domestic market to help avert an energy shortage following crisis talks with Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.

Australia is on track to become the world's largest exporter of liquified natural gas (LNG), yet its energy market operator has warned of a domestic gas crunch from 2019 that could trigger industry supply cuts and broad power outages.

"We are a massive gas exporter. It is utterly untenable - unacceptable - for us to be in a position where domestic gas consumers ... cannot have access to affordable gas," Turnbull told reporters on Wednesday after the meeting.

He said the producers had guaranteed to ensure that gas would be available for the national electricity market.

Australia's power supply problems made international headlines last week when Tesla Inc boss Elon Musk offered to save South Australia, the country's most renewable-energy dependent state, from blackouts by installing large-scale battery storage.

The South Australian government on Tuesday outlined plans to spend A$510 million ($385 million) to keep the lights on, including A$150 million to encourage the development of 100 megawatts of battery storage. [nL3N1GQ32M]

Australian manufacturers have long complained of tight gas supplies and soaring prices as producers have focused on supplying gas to LNG plants that have locked in 20-year export contracts. Three LNG plants have opened in the country over the past two years, which has tripled gas demand and sent gas prices rocketing from around A$6 a gigajoule (GJ) to as much as $22/GJ.

"That's apocalyptic as far as the cost structures of energy-intensive manufacturers are concerned," Tennant Reed, policy adviser at the Australian Industry Group, said at a gas outlook conference this week.

RESERVATION CALL

Companies like top Australian steel maker BlueScope Steel , fertiliser maker Incitec Pivot and packaging maker Orora Group have urged the government to reserve gas for the domestic market or risk losing thousands of jobs as plants shut.

Both sides of government have resisted a domestic gas reservation, acknowledging that would create sovereign risk for existing projects and threaten future investment in the country, but Turnbull left the door open to imposing a domestic quota.

"We've made considerable progress today, but there is more work to be done. But the considerable powers the Commonwealth has are obviously ones that we would never shirk from using in the national interest," he said.

Shell, which runs the Queensland Curtis LNG plant (QCLNG) and is sitting on undeveloped coal seam gas in the state, said it has sold significant volumes into southeastern Australia.

Diverting gas from LNG plants into the domestic market would be the easiest short-term solution, as two of the three LNG plants in Queensland - Shell's QCLNG and Origin and ConocoPhillips' Australia Pacific LNG (APLNG) - have some capacity that is not locked into export contracts.

Turnbull said both QCLNG and APLNG had committed to being net suppliers to the domestic market, while Santos' Gladstone LNG, which is short of gas, had taken the request on notice.

A challenge, however, would be finding space on the gas pipeline network, said Saul Kavonic, an analyst at Wood Mackenzie.

Producers blame state drilling bans, uncertainty over Australia's climate policy and, more recently, potential increases in petroleum producer taxes, for deterring development of new gas fields.

Companies also reined in spending on exploration and development after the oil price collapse in 2014.

Australia hauls in gas majors to boost local supply, cap prices - 路透新闻

{{20170314T221248.335+0000}}Australia hauls in gas majors to boost local supply, cap pricesBy Sonali Paul

SYDNEY, March 15 (Reuters) - Australia's top gas producers, led by ExxonMobil Corp and Royal Dutch Shell , are set to come under fire to supply more gas to the local market and curb soaring prices in crisis talks on Wednesday with Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.

The meeting comes days after Australia's energy market operator warned the country faces a gas crunch from 2019 that could trigger supply cuts to industry or power outages for lack of gas for generation.

This is happening even as the country is on track to become the world's top exporter of liquefied natural gas.

"What I'm seeking to do is to ensure we have action from the gas companies," Turnbull told reporters in Canberra.

"I can say that the gas companies, I have no doubt, are very well aware they operate with the benefit of a social licence from the Australian people. And they cannot expect to maintain that if, while billions of dollars of gas are being exported, Australians are left short."

Manufacturers who need gas have long complained they faced tight supplies and soaring prices as producers have been focused on supplying gas to the LNG plants that have locked in 20-year export contracts.

Tillerson's email alias was prompted by business needs, Exxon says  - 路透新闻

{{20170314T220828.730+0000}}Tillerson's email alias was prompted by business needs, Exxon says By Ernest Scheyder

HOUSTON, March 14 (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, while chief executive of Exxon Mobil Corp , used an alias for emails with employees and board members because his primary account was jammed with too many messages, the oil company said on Tuesday.

New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who is investigating whether Exxon misled shareholders and the public about climate change, wrote to a judge on Monday accusing Exxon of not previously disclosing the alias and Tillerson's climate-change communications through it.[nL2N1GQ1T7]

Exxon denied trying to hide anything.

"This was not an alias used to discuss only climate change," Exxon spokesman Alan Jeffers said on Tuesday. "It was an account used for everyday business by senior executives who needed to reach" Tillerson, who left the company at the end of 2016 to become secretary of state.

Tillerson received thousands of emails a day from climate change activists and others at his regular address - Rex.W.Tillerson@ExxonMobil.com - and that made it difficult to parse which messages were important to promptly address Exxon's business operations, Jeffers said.

Tillerson used the email alias for eight years and sent thousands of messages. Sixty-four of those sent and received met the parameters for Schneiderman's climate change subpoena and were turned over to New York officials, Jeffers said.

The email alias was Wayne.Tracker@ExxonMobil.com. Wayne is Tillerson's middle name and "Tracker" is likely a reference to his past involvement in the Boy Scouts of America.

Although Trump has vowed to reverse climate-change steps taken by former President Barack Obama, Exxon has said it believes it must address climate change. On Monday, it said: "ExxonMobil believes the risk of climate change is clear and warrants action."

Darren Woods, who succeeded Tillerson as Exxon's CEO in January, does not use an email alias, nor does any other Exxon employee, Jeffers said.

Use of the email alias was seized upon by environmentalists on Tuesday, who said it revealed a pattern of deception.

"If they had nothing to hide, than why the secret email account?" said Jamie Henn of 350.org, an environmental group.

Exxon plans to respond to Schneiderman in a court filing within the next several days, Jeffers said.

The case is People of the State of New York v PricewaterhouseCoopers and Exxon Mobil Corporation, New York State Supreme Court, New York County, No. 451962/2016.

* Les cours du brut ont touché leurs plus bas depuis fin novembre

* Une tempête de neige a affecté les compagnies aériennes

* Le Dow a perdu 0,21%, le S&P 0,34%, le Nasdaq 0,32%

par Rodrigo Campos

NEW YORK, 14 mars (Reuters) - La Bourse de New York a fini en baisse mardi, affectée par le repli des cours du brut à leurs plus bas niveaux depuis trois mois, dans un marché par ailleurs dominé par la prudence à la veille des annonces de la Réserve fédérale américaine (Fed).

L'indice Dow Jones <.DJI> a perdu 44,11 points, soit 0,21% à 20.837,37 points. Le S&P-500 <.SPX>, plus large, a perdu 8,02 points, soit 0,34%, à 2.365,45. Le Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> a reculé de son côté de 18,97 points (-0,32%) à 5.856,82 points.

Le comité de politique monétaire de la Fed, qui a entamé mardi une réunion de deux jours, devrait décider mercredi d'un nouveau relèvement d'un quart de point de l'objectif de taux des "fed funds".

Si ce relèvement est largement attendu, le calendrier du resserrement monétaire de la Fed en 2017 reste incertain et les opérateurs de marché guetteront toute indication à ce sujet lors de la conférence de presse de sa présidente, Janet Yellen.

La chute des cours du brut après la publication du rapport mensuel de l'Opep a par ailleurs pénalisé les valeurs pétrolières. Selon ce rapport, les stocks mondiaux de pétrole ont continué d'augmenter au mois de janvier malgré l'entrée en vigueur en début d'année d'un accord de réduction de la production visant à soutenir les prix du baril. [nL5N1GR3YL]

Le brut léger américain a touché un point bas de 47,09 dollars le baril dans la journée, puis s'est repris après la clôture. Mais il reste à ses plus bas depuis le 30 novembre, date de l'accord de l'Opep, après sept jours de repli d'affilée.

BREAKINGVIEWS-Icahn cronyism fits Trump's emerging energy policy - 路透新闻

{{20170314T200031.805+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-Icahn cronyism fits Trump's emerging energy policy(The authors are Reuters Breakingviews columnists. The opinions expressed are their own.)

By Lauren Silva Laughlin and Antony Currie

DALLAS/NEW YORK, March 14 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Carl Icahn's first big pitch as deregulation consigliere to the president has sparked accusations of cronyism. His proposed overhaul of the U.S. biofuels program would directly benefit one of his own companies. Such a conflict of interest should preclude his having a say, yet it's part of a pattern for a Trump administration devoted to fossil fuels.

Icahn wants to change who is responsible for mixing the right amount of ethanol into petroleum. At present, it falls on refiners' shoulders. If they can't do it directly, they have to buy credits as offsets.

It's a pet peeve for Icahn, who recently ranted about how the Environmental Protection Agency makes life difficult for refiners. He alleges speculators are driving up the cost of credits. But he's hardly objective in this case, owning 82 percent of refiner CVR Energy , which last year spent some $200 million on ethanol credits. Icahn's meddling raised complaints last week from public watchdog group Public Citizen.

The biofuels policy is ripe for rethinking. The government required ethanol be added to gasoline in 2005 to cut oil imports and improve the environment. It also didn't hurt that the policy helped corn farmers in Iowa, home of the first battle in the nation's presidential campaign. Domestic oil production has surged in recent years, though, crimping imports. And recent studies, including one by the University of Michigan, suggest ethanol may actually increase, rather than decrease, carbon-dioxide emissions that cause climate change. The European Union in November proposed halving its use in transportation fuel, while the EPA increased it.

The new EPA administrator, Scott Pruitt, brings a different perspective. On Thursday he denied carbon dioxide is a "primary contributor" to global warming. That puts him in lockstep with President Donald Trump, who has called climate change a Chinese hoax and pledged to exit the Paris climate-change agreement. Emails released shortly after the Senate confirmed Pruitt's appointment last month showed he worked closely with oil and gas companies and utilities to roll back environmental regulations in his previous post as Oklahoma's attorney general.

Icahn's role is polluting the ethanol battle. Administration officials usually have to sell any holdings and even then may still have to recuse themselves on key issues - as former Exxon Mobil boss and current Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has over the Keystone XL pipeline. As an informal adviser Icahn is not held to such basic standards.

Trump has, at least, not taken Icahn up on his ethanol proposal yet. But it's early days.

CONTEXT NEWS

- On March 9 Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt told CNBC that he "would not agree that it (CO2) is a primary contributor to the global warming that we see. Although we don't know that yet."

- Also on March 9, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson recused himself from any decisions related to TransCanada's application for a permit to build the Keystone XL pipeline. The statement came in a letter to Greenpeace after the environmental group had written to the State Department and the Office of Government Ethics arguing that Exxon Mobil, where Tillerson spent 10 years as chief executive, would "directly and predictably" benefit from the pipeline's approval. State Department legal adviser Katherine McManus told Greenpeace that Tillerson had recused himself in February.

- On March 8 Public Citizen, a government watchdog group, said it asked lawmakers to investigate whether billionaire investor Carl Icahn should have been subject to lobbying disclosure laws when he advised President Donald Trump to overhaul the U.S. biofuels program.

- On March 1 the White House denied that Trump planned to issue an executive order to change the national biofuels program. The U.S. Renewable Fuels Association had earlier said that Trump's team had informed the group an order was pending, according to a Reuters report. The RFA issued a statement saying that a member of the Trump administration called to inform the group that the president intended to sign an executive order that would change the so-called "point of obligation," shifting the onus to combine biofuels with gasoline from refiners to retailers.

- Among those who pushed for the change is hedge-fund manager Icahn, who owns 82 percent of biofuel producer CVR Energy.

POINT MARCHÉS-Wall Street ouvre en baisse, Fed et pétrole pèsent - 路透新闻

{{20170314T134919.072+0000}}POINT MARCHÉS-Wall Street ouvre en baisse, Fed et pétrole pèsentPARIS, 14 mars (Reuters) - La Bourse de New York a ouvert mardi en légère baisse, la prudence dominant chez les investisseurs à la veille des annonces de la Réserve fédérale américaine (Fed) tandis que le secteur pétrolier pèse sur la cote dans le sillage du repli brutal des cours du brut après le rapport de l'Opep.

Quelques minutes après le début des échanges, l'indice Dow Jones <.DJI> perd 0,13%, à 20.855,18 . Le Standard & Poor's 500 <.SPX>, plus large, recule de 0,28% à 2.366,90 points et le Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> cède 0,35% à 5.855,74 points.

Le Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), le comité de politique monétaire de la Fed, se réunit dès ce mardi et devrait décider mercredi d'un nouveau relèvement d'un quart de point de l'objectif de taux des "fed funds".

Si un relèvement des taux est largement attendu, le calendrier du resserrement monétaire de la Fed en 2017 reste incertain et les opérateurs de marché guetteront toute indication à ce sujet lors de la conférence de presse de la présidente de l'institution, Janet Yellen.

Aux valeurs, Valeant Pharmaceuticals chute de 12,5%, l'investisseur William Ackman ayant annoncé que son fonds spéculatif Pershing Square avait vendu la totalité de sa participation. [nL5N1GQ6SH]

De son côté, Lantheus Holdings décroche de 11,7% après avoir annoncé que certains de ses actionnaires allaient céder 3 millions d'actions.

A l'inverse, Moneygram International s'envole de 27% à 16,10 dollars après la surenchère d'Euronet Worldwide sur l'offre du chinois Ant Financial, filiale de paiements d'Alibaba (+0,4%). Euronet a proposé 15,20 dollars par action pour reprendre le spécialiste du transfert de fonds, contre 13,25 dollars pour Ant Financial.

La chute brutale des cours du brut après la publication du rapport mensuel de l'Opep pénalise les valeurs pétrolières. Lanterne rouge du S&P-500, Marathon Oil perd 4,7%. Au sein du Dow, Chevron baisse de 1,2% et ExxonMobil cède 0,5%.

Avant l'ouverture de Wall Street, le recul des cours du brut avait déjà poussé les marchés d'actions européens, également prudents face aux annonces de la Fed et à la tenue des élections législatives aux Pays-Bas, en territoire négatif.

Sur les marchés pétroliers, le Brent de la mer du Nord cède 1,3% à 50,68 dollars le baril et le brut léger américain recule de 1,7% à 47,58 dollars vers 13h37 GMT.

Les stocks mondiaux de pétrole ont continué d'augmenter au mois de janvier malgré l'entrée en vigueur en début d'année d'accords pour réduire la production afin de soutenir les prix, lit-on dans le dernier rapport mensuel de l'Opep publié mardi. [nL5N1GR3YL]

Tillerson used email alias at Exxon to talk climate -New York attorney general - 路透新闻

{{20170314T012753.256+0000}}Tillerson used email alias at Exxon to talk climate -New York attorney generalBy Karen Freifeld

NEW YORK, March 13 (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, the former chairman and chief executive of Exxon Mobil Corp , used an alias email address while at the oil company to send and receive information related to climate change and other matters, according to New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman.

The attorney general's office said in a letter on Monday that it found Tillerson had used an alias email address under the pseudonym "Wayne Tracker" from at least 2008 through 2015. Wayne is Tillerson's middle name.

The letter was sent to a New York state judge overseeing Schneiderman's investigation into whether Exxon misled shareholders and the public about climate change.

In a statement on Monday, Exxon spokesman Alan Jeffers said, "The email address, Wayne.Tracker@exxonmobil.com, is part of the company's email system and was put in place for secure and expedited communications between select senior company officials and the former chairman for a broad range of business-related topics."

Jeffers said the company had provided 2.5 million pages of documents in response to a subpoena from Schneiderman's office and would respond to the claims in the letter in court filings.

A State Department spokeswoman declined to comment on the matter.

The letter, seen by Reuters, said Exxon had not previously disclosed the alias account. It asked the judge to order Exxon to explain whether documents from the "Wayne Tracker" email and 34 additional accounts assigned to other Exxon executives and board members had been preserved.

The letter said that Exxon had produced some 60 documents bearing the "Wayne Tracker" email but never said it was used by Tillerson for relevant communications at Exxon.

It asked the court to order Exxon to identify whether any other email accounts were used by Tillerson.

"Exxon's top executives, and in particular, Mr. Tillerson, have made multiple representations that are at the center of OAG's (attorney general's office) investigation of potentially false or misleading statements to investors and the public," the letter said.

The case is People of the State of New York v PricewaterhouseCoopers and Exxon Mobil Corporation, New York State Supreme Court, New York County, No. 451962/2016.

CalPERS plans 17 climate change proxy efforts this year - 路透新闻

{{20170313T172137.851+0000}}CalPERS plans 17 climate change proxy efforts this yearBy Robin Respaut

March 13 (Reuters) - The California Public Employees' Retirement System plans to be active in 17 proxy efforts on climate change directed at energy companies this proxy season, the pension fund's Chief Investment Officer Ted Eliopoulos said on Monday.

CalPERS' effort will build on its actions over the past year, when it was active in 12 proxy efforts, to increase the percentage of votes in favor of climate change strategy disclosures.

Eliopoulos said during an investment committee board meeting that CalPERS would ask energy companies over the next three months for "disclosure of their climate change strategy, among other topics."

In order to "drive the votes at those companies, we are building on our networks of peer engagement," said Eliopoulos.

The nation's largest public pension fund joined New York City pension chiefs last year to urge Exxon Mobil shareholders to back a measure that would force the company to detail how its business would be impacted as governments move to tackle climate change. [nL2N1881YY]

CalPERS and New York City vowed to engage other shareholders to push the world's largest publicly traded oil company to say more about how its revenues, reserves and operations could be hurt by the 2015 Paris Agreement backed by 195 countries to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius.

Following the proxy access proposal, Exxon appointed its first climate scientist to its board, Dr. Susan Avery, the former head of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and a former professor at the University of Colorado, Boulder. [nL1N1FF222]

"This is an extremely encouraging response in recognition that Exxon needs to bolster its capacity on climate change," Eliopoulos said on Monday.

UPDATE 1-Majors exiting Canada's oil sands acting in own interest -Trudeau - 路透新闻

{{20170310T204018.742+0000}}UPDATE 1-Majors exiting Canada's oil sands acting in own interest -Trudeau(Adds detail on oil sands, comments on border)

By Liz Hampton

HOUSTON, March 10 (Reuters) - Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Friday dismissed a recent string of major oil companies selling their holdings in the heavy oil sands of Western Canada and moving investments to shale fields.

Royal Dutch Shell and Marathon Oil this week disclosed sales of operations that largely removed both firms from the carbon-heavy oil reserves. Shell is selling its interests to Canadian Natural Resources. Last month, Exxon Mobil wrote down all of its oil reserves from its Kearl project in northern Alberta, saying extracting the oil was no longer economic at current prices.

"Businesses will make the decisions they make," Trudeau said.

In a wide-ranging media briefing, Trudeau said oil and gas executives are looking for greater clarity on regulations and pricing, arguing that the world is ready for a low-carbon economy. He also said Canada and the United States are working on border issues, including migration and trade.

Trudeau said a Canadian consensus on a carbon price to meet international climate change goals shows the nation can move forward on difficult issues.

"The one thing I've heard consistently from leaders in the energy industry is the need for clarity in terms of what (the) frame of regulations, (and) pricing is going to be," he said.

Promoting both renewable and conventional energy sources shows "investments in Canada are sound investments, not just for short term, but for the long term," Trudeau said." We're going to see many people interested in partnering in drawing on Canadians' great natural resources."

Referring to a U.S. proposal for a tax on imports to stimulate job creation, which his government opposes, Trudeau cautioned that details are still lacking, and agreement is far from assured.

"Anything that creates extra barriers and impediments to the smooth flow of goods will hurt our business and hurt our workers and limit our capacity to be competitive," he said, repeating his objections to a U.S. border tax.

Asked about potential repercussions if a tax were imposed, Trudeau said his government would seek to protect the country's export jobs and "stand up for the values we hold dear."

The United States and Canada are engaged at several levels, he said, including on trade, refugees and immigration. The country's minister of public safety is meeting with the U.S. secretary of Homeland Security on border issues, he said, adding that Canada is not skimping on border security.

Work also is continuing on gaining pre-clearance approvals to allow more Canadians to pass U.S. customs reviews while still on Canadian soil, he said, speeding up travel between the two countries.

FOKUS 5-US-Börsen zum Wochenschluss kaum verändert - 路透新闻

{{20170310T183835.078+0000}}FOKUS 5-US-Börsen zum Wochenschluss kaum verändert* Indizes geben Gewinne im Handelsverlauf wieder ab

* Starke Job-Daten deuten auf US-Zinsanhebung kommende Woche hin

* Übernahme-Gerücht durch Exxon treibt Aktien von BP an

(Fokus auf Wall Street, aktuelle Kurse)

New York, 10. Mrz (Reuters) - Die US-Börsen haben am Freitag wenig verändert tendiert. Überraschend starke US-Arbeitsmarkdaten und die damit verbundene Erwartung einer US-Zinsanhebung in der kommenden Woche hatten die Wall Street zum Handelsstart zwar deutlich angeschoben. Im Handelsverlauf bröckelten die Gewinne aber wieder ab. Händler schlossen inzwischen nicht mehr aus, dass die US-Notenbank angesichts der robusten Konjunktur und der erwarteten Maßnahmen von US-Präsident Donald Trump zur weiteren Anfachung der Wirtschaft insgesamt vier Zinsanhebungen 2017 plant.

Der Dow-Jones-Index<.DJI> der Standardwerte lag am Mittag (Ortszeit) mit 20.851 Punkten minimal tiefer als am Vortag. Der breiter gefasste S&P-500<.SPX> legte hingegen ebenso wie die Nasdaq um knapp 0,1 Prozent zu. Der S&P notierte damit bei 2365 und die Nasdaq<.IXIC> bei 5841 Stellen. Der Dax<.GDAXI> in Frankfurt hatte 0,1 Prozent tiefer geschlossen.

Den am Freitag vor Börsenbeginn veröffentlichten US-Job-Daten zufolge schufen private Unternehmen und der Staat im Februar insgesamt 235.000 Stellen, Experten hatten mit nur 190.000 gerechnet. Die Erwerbslosenquote sank auf 4,7 Prozent. Damit herrscht faktisch Vollbeschäftigung, was das erklärte Ziel der US-Notenbank ist. Anleger sind sich nun nahezu sicher, dass die Federal Reserve Mitte kommender Woche die Zinsen anheben wird. Zudem werden sie auf mögliche Andeutungen von Notenbank-Chefin Janet Yellen im Anschluss an die Zinsmitteilung achten, ob die die Fed angesichts der robusten Wirtschaft ihre Geldpolitik aggressiver verschärfen könnte als bislang erwartet.

Fusionsgerüchte sorgten für Kurszuwächse bei Ölkonzernen: Der Londoner "Evening Standard" berichtete, Exxon könnte versuchen, BP zu kaufen. BP und Exxon wollten sich dazu nicht äußern. Die Exxon-Papiere verloren 0,1 Prozent, die in London gelisteten Papiere der britischen BP stiegen um 3,7 Prozent.

Aktien von Finisar gaben 22 Prozent nach. Der Netzwerkausrüster hatte unerwartet schwache Quartalszahlen und auch einen unter den Prognosen liegenden Ausblick vorgelegt.

Papiere von Southwest Airlines verloren 1,8 Prozent. Die viertgrößte US-Airline hatte sich pessimistischer als bislang zu den Erwartungen für das laufende Quartal geäußert.

U.S. oil rig count rises to most since Sept. 2015 -Baker Hughes - 路透新闻

{{20170310T180716.043+0000}}U.S. oil rig count rises to most since Sept. 2015 -Baker HughesMarch 10 (Reuters) - U.S. drillers added oil rigs for an
eighth week in a row to the most since September 2015, extending
a ten-month recovery as energy companies boost spending to take
advantage of a recovery in crude prices since OPEC agreed to cut
production late last year.

Drillers added eight oil rigs in the week to March 10,
bringing the total count up to 617, versus 386 rigs a year ago,
energy services firm Baker Hughes Inc  said on Friday.

The increase came despite a collapse in crude futures this
week to a three-month low because the rigs activated this week
were based on decisions made a couple of month ago when oil
prices were higher.

"We will not see the impact of this week's crude price
collapse for another couple of months," James Williams,
president of energy consultant WTRG Economics in Arkansas, said,
noting "if crude prices rebound next week, this week's price
drop won't matter at all as far as the rig count is concerned."

U.S. crude futures  steadied around $48 a barrel on
Friday after falling this week to its lowest since November,
pressured by ample supplies in the U.S., despite production cuts
led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries
(OPEC). [O/R]

Since crude prices first topped $50 a barrel in May after
recovering from 13-year lows in February 2016, drillers have
added a total of 301 oil rigs in 37 of the past 41 weeks, the
biggest recovery in rigs since a global oil glut crushed the
market over two years starting in mid 2014.

Baker Hughes oil rig count plunged from a record 1,609 in
October 2014 to a six-year low of 316 in May 2016 as U.S. crude
collapsed from over $107 a barrel in June 2014 to near $26 in
February 2016.

Marathon Oil Corp  said on Wednesday it will spend
$1.1 billion for about 70,000 acres in the Permian basin in
Texas, where it plans to immediately boost spending by adding a
drilling rig. [nL3N1GM4K8] [nL5N1GM1VZ]

The move comes as Exxon Mobil Corp , Pioneer Natural
Resources Co  and others have ramped up operations in the
Permian, one of the cheapest places to pump oil in the United
States.

Additionally, U.S. shale oil producers said this week at the
CERAWeek conference in Houston they are plotting ambitious
production growth outside the red-hot Permian, where about
two-thirds of the rigs have been added over the past 10 months.

Drillers like Hess Corp , Chesapeake Energy Corp
, Continental Resources Inc  and others said at
the conference they were planning to expand in North Dakota,
Oklahoma and other shale regions. [nL2N1GL1L8]

Oil production in North Dakota rose 38,000 barrels per day
(bpd) to 980,000 bpd in January, monthly data from the state
Industrial Commission showed this week. [nEMN1CPVT8]

U.S. crude inventories hit a record high last week, after
nine straight weeks of builds, while production was projected to
rise from 8.9 million bpd in 2016 to 9.2 million bpd in 2017 and
a record high of 9.6 million bpd in 2018, according to federal
energy data. [EIA/S][nL2N1GK17S]

Senior Saudi energy officials, however, told top independent
U.S. oil firms in a closed-door meeting this week that they
should not assume OPEC would extend output curbs to offset
rising production from U.S. shale fields, two industry sources
told Reuters. [nL3N1GM017]

Saudi Arabia's energy minister also said at CERAWeek that
there would be no "free rides" for U.S. shale producers
benefiting from the upturn. [nL2N1GK0XX]

FOKUS 4-Dax kann 12.000er Marke nicht ins Wochenende retten - 路透新闻

{{20170310T170701.057+0000}}FOKUS 4-Dax kann 12.000er Marke nicht ins Wochenende retten* Euro nach Zinsspekulationen höher

* US-Stellenaufbau überrascht positiv

* Lohnentwicklung drückt Dollar

(Neu: Schlusskurse, BP Exxon, Euro)

Frankfurt, 10. Mrz (Reuters) - Trotz eines soliden US-Arbeitsmarktberichtes haben Europas Aktienanleger zum Wochenschluss lieber Gewinne mitgenommen. Spekulationen auf allmählich wieder steigende Zinsen machten vor allem Bankentitel begehrt und beflügelten den Euro. Der Dax<.GDAXI> ging 0,1 Prozent schwächer bei 11.963,18 Punkten aus dem Handel. Auf Wochensicht gab er ein halbes Prozent ab. Der EuroStoxx50<.STOXX50E> legte am Freitag 0,2 Prozent zu auf 3416,27 Zähler. "Erneut erleben wir das Phänomen, dass gute Daten zum Anlass genommen werden, Gewinne mitzunehmen", sagte Marktexperte Jochen Stanzl vom Online-Broker CMC Markets. Das deute auf Erschöpfungssignale hin. Zudem drückte der Euro-Anstieg die Kurse exportorientierter Unternehmen.

Am Devisenmarkt baute der Euro am Abend seine Kursgewinne aus und legte 0,8 Prozent auf 1,0663 Dollar zu. Einige Ratsmitglieder der Europäischen Zentralbank (EZB) haben Insidern zufolge die Möglichkeit einer Zinsanhebung vor dem Auslaufen der großangelegten Anleihenkäufe erwogen. Die Diskussion darüber sei aber kurz gewesen, und es habe keine breite Zustimmung dazu gegeben, sagten zwei mit der Situation vertraute Personen[nL5N1GN4BH].

JOB-DATEN MACHEN WEG FÜR FED-ZINSERHÖHUNG FREI

Nach einer schwächer als erwartet ausgefallenen Lohnentwicklung in den USA war der Dollar bereits zuvor ins Hintertreffen geraten. Dabei brummt der Jobmotor in den USA: Im Februar entstanden 235.000 Stellen.[nL5N1GN2UW]. Damit dürfte die Fed kommenden Mittwoch den Leitzins um 25 Basispunkte auf 0,75 bis ein Prozent anheben. "Mit diesen guten Zahlen gibt es für die Fed keinen Grund mehr, weiter zu warten", sagte Martin Moryson, Chefvolkswirt von Sal. Oppenheim. Investoren sehen nach Reuters-Daten die Wahrscheinlichkeit einer US-Zinserhöhung bei mehr als 90 Prozent.

Die Aussicht auf ein nahendes Ende der ultra-lockeren Geldpolitik in Europa und auf steigende US-Zinsen halfen den Finanzwerten erneut auf die Sprünge. Commerzbank führten mit einem Plus von 5,8 Prozent die Dax-Gewinnerliste an, Deutsche Bank legten 2,1 Prozent zu. Der Index für die Banken der Euro-Zone<.SX7E> legte um zwei Prozent zu. EZB-Chef Mario Draghi hatte am Donnerstag betont, es gebe derzeit keinen Druck, weitere Notfall-Maßnahmen zur Ankurbelung der Konjunktur zu ergreifen[nFWN1GM0ML]. Auch seien neue langfristige Billig-Kredite für die europäischen Geschäftsbanken kein Thema.

ÖLKONZERNE NACH BERICHT ÜBER BP-KAUF GEFRAGT

Ein Zeitungsbericht über angebliche Pläne von Exxon zum Kauf von BP trieben die Aktien europäischer Energiekonzerne in die Höhe. Die Anteilscheine des britischen Ölunternehmens stiegen um 3,6 Prozent, Exxon lagen leicht im Minus. Royal-Dutch-Shell-Papiere legten um 1,2 Prozent zu, Total-Aktien gewannen ein Prozent. BP und Exxon lehnten Stellungnahmen zu der Meldung des "Evening Standard" über wieder hochkochende Marktgerüchte ab, wonach der US-Konzern den britischen Rivalen schlucken will.

In London gewannen BT 3,7 Prozent. Nach einem zweijährigen Tauziehen mit den britischen Behörden willigte der Telekom-Konzern ein, die für das Breitbandnetz zuständige Sparte Openreach zu einer rechtlich eigenständigen Tochter zu machen[nL5N1GN1EO]. Der Regulierer Ofcom und Konkurrenten wie Vodafone erwarten davon einen rascheren Ausbau des Glasfaser-Netzes für Breitband-Internetzugänge.

* Oil price recovery, low service cost boost offshore exploration

* Firms slash costs of deepwater projects by 50 pct

* Exploration spending halved since 2014

By Ron Bousso

HOUSTON, March 10 (Reuters) - Deepwater oil drilling can be expensive, time-consuming and a hard sell to investors. But the world's top energy firms are restarting their search for giant oilfields under the ocean after a two-year lull.

A recovery in oil prices to about $50 a barrel from a 12-year low in 2016 is reviving oil majors' appetite for risk. [nL1N1G9171]

Reductions in offshore production costs mean that some projects may be able to compete with North American shale fields, executives said at an energy conference in Houston this week.

The recovery in the industry has so far been focused on onshore shale output from the largest U.S. oilfield, the Permian Basin.

"Our competition over the past years has evolved from 'we want to be the best in deepwater' to 'we want to compete with shale' to 'we want to beat the Permian'," Wael Sawan, Royal Dutch Shell's executive vice president for deepwater, said in an interview.

Shell is the largest deepwater producer among the world's top publicly traded oil companies and is set to pump 900,000 barrels per day (bpd) from such projects by the end of the decade.

Firms such as Shell and Exxon Mobil , who specialize in complex offshore exploration, slashed budgets after oil prices collapsed in 2014. Spending cuts were so drastic that the Paris-based International Energy Agency warned this week of a looming supply crunch beyond 2020.[nL5N1GJ3H6]

Shell has cut well costs by at least 50 percent, reduced logistics cost by three quarters and cut staff by nearly a third to make developments in areas such as the Gulf of Mexico and Nigeria profitable at oil prices below $40 a barrel, on par with the most profitable shale wells, Sawan said.

Other companies such as France's Total have seen similar cost cuts.

SNIPER FOCUS

After cutting the cost of deepwater development, companies are also reviving the search for new resources.

They are focusing exploration efforts on areas close to existing fields to maximize the chances of discovery and minimize costs. Many such areas are in Brazil, the Gulf of Mexico and Southeast Asia.

"It is a very selective, sniper focus," Sawan said.

Some firms are poised to benefit from decreased competition, lower costs of marine seismic studies and drilling rigs, and cheaper opportunities to acquire exploration licences from governments eager to attract investment.

"Right now, we've entered the best time in the last decade to be in the exploration business," Gregory Hebertson, who heads Murphy's western hemisphere exploration, said at the CERAWeek conference in Houston. "There is probably a two- or three-year window that we can capture the cost efficiency in the market."

Discovering new resources is essential for oil firms to grow and to offset natural decline of fields. But deepwater exploration requires money, time, expertise - and luck.

Some shareholders would prefer that oil firms stick to other, less risky growth options, said Federico Arisi Rota, executive vice president Americas for Italy's Eni, which operates major offshore drilling projects.

"We must compete with alternative growth options that might be considered more attractive," such as growth through mergers and acquisitions or investing in shale oil production, Rota said.

Pressure to limit company spending amid a slow recovery in oil prices is also putting a break on big exploration campaigns.

"We know exploration spending is not always appreciated by investors," Kevin McLachlan, head of exploration for Total said.

RISKIER PLANS AHEAD

Eni is considered one of the most successful explorers after the discovery of giant gas fields in Egypt in recent years. It aims at discovering 2 to 3 billion barrels of oil and gas this year through drilling 115 offshore wells near Africa, Mexico, Norway and Asia, Rota said.

A "more aggressive" exploration program is planned to start in 2018 in riskier and more expensive regions such as the Arctic, which offer the potential big discoveries, he said.

Deepwater resources will be required to keep up with the growing demand, regardless of output growth in shale oil fields, Total's McLachlan said.

Such projects are "key to our long-term plan, and we believe it is the same for the industry no matter the near-term focus on the Permian," McLachlan said, referring to the largest U.S. oilfield in west Texas.

Hess Corp Chief Executive John Hess said the company's Liza development, off the coast of Guyana, was crucial to his company's growth potential and estimated to have as much as 2 billion barrels of oil.

"This is one of the largest oil discoveries in the last 10 years," Hess said in an interview.

{{20170310T112106.254+0000}}RPT-ACTUALIZA 2-Tribunal revoca decisión que ordena a Venezuela pagar 1.400 mln dlr a Exxon: abogado(Repetición de nota transmitida la noche anterior. No altera texto)

Por Alexandra Ulmer

CARACAS, 9 mar (Reuters) - Un tribunal del Banco Mundial revocó la decisión que ordenó a Venezuela pagar 1.400 millones de dólares en daños a la estadounidense Exxon Mobil Corp por la nacionalización de sus activos, dijo el jueves un abogado que representa en el juicio al país petrolero.

El caso, en el Centro Internacional de Arreglo de Diferencias Relativas a Inversiones (CIADI), el tribunal arbitral del Banco Mundial, es uno de los muchos que surgieron tras las sendas nacionalizaciones durante el Gobierno del presidente Hugo Chávez.

El Tribunal suspendió en el 2015 el pago que Venezuela debía hacer a Exxon , hasta que se tomara una decisión sobre una petición de anulación hecha por ese país.

"Estábamos seguros de que nuestra posición era correcta y estamos muy contentos de la decisión del comité", dijo a Reuters, vía correo electrónico, el abogado y representante legal de Venezuela ante el tribunal arbitral George Kahale.

El dictamen del CIADI, fechado el jueves, dice que "partes del laudo" fueron anuladas pero no ofreció un desglose de las cifras.

Un portavoz de la petrolera estadounidense, Todd Spitler, no confirmó los detalles. Sin embargo, agregó que "Exxon Mobil continuará evaluando los aspectos legales del caso y determinará los pasos a seguir próximamente".

La anulación del pago aliviaría las finanzas del Gobierno del presidente Nicolás Maduro, que se enfrenta a un pesado cronograma de pagos de deuda externa en medio de una profunda recesión y una escasez generalizada de bienes esenciales.

La nación petrolera cuestionó el pago que se decidió en el 2014, e incluso argumentó que una decisión de la Cámara de Comercio Internacional, un panel arbitral con sede en París, por unos 908 millones de dólares, debía ser deducido de la compensación.

A pesar de la decisión inicial del tribunal del Banco Mundial en el caso de Exxon, el Gobierno de Venezuela lo consideró como un éxito debido a que la compañía buscaba una compensación de unos 10.000 millones de dólares.

En el 2007 el entonces presidente Hugo Chávez, que falleció por un cáncer, ordenó la expropiación de una serie de desarrollos petroleros, incluido el proyecto de crudo pesado Cerro Negro y otro más pequeño llamado La Ceiba, ambos operados por Exxon.

Aunque se retiró del CIADI en el 2012, Venezuela enfrenta una treintena de millonarios arbitrajes internacionales en esa corte luego de una agresiva política de nacionalizaciones llevada a cabo por Chávez durante sus 14 años en el poder.

BREAKINGVIEWS-Aramco's IPO merits social engineering discount - 路透新闻

{{20170310T100306.691+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-Aramco's IPO merits social engineering discount(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.)

By Andy Critchlow

LONDON, March 10 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Saudi Aramco is in danger of undermining its own cash call. The state-owned oil giant is preparing to launch the world's biggest initial public offering, targeting a valuation of $2 trillion - almost six times bigger than the value of the world's largest publically traded oil company, ExxonMobil . Yet concurrent plans to pump cash into what could prove to be a series of white elephants should have investors arguing for a discount.

Aramco is sometimes described as a state within a state. To understand why, consider its planned $4.4 billion investment in a new energy-focused industrial area in the country's Eastern Province, reported by Reuters on Tuesday. Such attempts to create more jobs for young Saudis are one of two main pillars holding up the economic plan laid out by Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman last year. Similar schemes, which aim to boost local manufacturing and attract foreign investment, sprawl across the desert kingdom.

There are two problems. First, they have so far failed to tackle joblessness: youth unemployment is high and comparable to rates in poor sub-Saharan African countries at 30 percent of the workforce, according to World Bank figures. Spending on imports fell by just 2 percent in 2015 despite decades of investment into building domestic industrial capacity.

Second, the employment drive potentially makes the other pillar - raising as much as possible from the sale in Aramco shares – trickier. The group already lacks publicly accessible detail on its finances. If it also plans to periodically write off billions on city-building experiments, investors should be factoring that into the valuation.

Aramco's workforce is still only about two-thirds the size of its international peer Royal Dutch Shell , which has 93,000 employees. Hence it may not display all the bloated inefficiency characteristic of state-dominated groups. But if it persists with quixotic social engineering, investors will start with the $2 trillion valuation and apply a white elephant discount.

CONTEXT NEWS

- Saudi Aramco plans to develop an industrial city in the eastern part of Saudi Arabia, focusing on energy related activities, the state-owned oil producer's vice president for procurement said on March 7.

- Aramco will invest 16.5 billion riyals ($4.4 billion) into the new industrial area, Abdulaziz al-Abdulkarim said. The scheme is part of a government plan to create more domestic jobs for its energy industry. The kingdom is in the process of reforming its economy with the aim of reducing dependence on oil exports.

CERAWEEK-Oil industry revives quest for deepwater reserves - 路透新闻

{{20170310T060001.992+0000}}CERAWEEK-Oil industry revives quest for deepwater reserves* Oil price recovery, low service cost boost offshore exploration

* Firms slash costs of deepwater projects by 50 pct

* Exploration spending halved since 2014

By Ron Bousso

HOUSTON, March 10 (Reuters) - Deepwater oil drilling can be expensive, time-consuming and a hard sell to investors. But the world's top energy firms are restarting their search for giant oilfields under the ocean after a two-year lull.

A recovery in oil prices to about $50 a barrel from a 12-year low in 2016 is reviving oil majors' appetite for risk. [nL1N1G9171]

Reductions in offshore production costs mean that some projects may be able to compete with North American shale fields, executives said at an energy conference in Houston this week.

The recovery in the industry has so far been focused on onshore shale output from the largest U.S. oilfield, the Permian Basin.

"Our competition over the past years has evolved from 'we want to be the best in deepwater' to 'we want to compete with shale' to 'we want to beat the Permian'," Wael Sawan, Royal Dutch Shell's executive vice president for deepwater, said in an interview.

Shell is the largest deepwater producer among the world's top publicly traded oil companies and is set to pump 900,000 barrels per day (bpd) from such projects by the end of the decade.

UPDATE 3-Order for Venezuela to pay Exxon $1.4 bln in damages overturned - lawyer - 路透新闻

{{20170310T020643.341+0000}}UPDATE 3-Order for Venezuela to pay Exxon $1.4 bln in damages overturned - lawyer(Adds ICSID, details of case)

By Alexandra Ulmer

CARACAS, March 9 (Reuters) - A World Bank tribunal's order for Venezuela to pay $1.4 billion in damages to Exxon Mobil Corp over nationalizations has been annulled, a lawyer for the Venezuelan government said on Thursday.

The case at the World Bank's International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes is one of many arising from nationalizations during late President Hugo Chavez's 1999-2013 rule of the South American OPEC member country.

"We were confident all along that our position was correct and are very pleased that the annulment committee agreed," Venezuela's lawyer George Kahale said.

A reduction to the overall $1.6 billion award would be welcome news to President Nicolas Maduro's cash-strapped government as it faces heavy foreign debt repayments amid a deep economic recession that has led to widespread shortages.

The ICSID ruling, dated Thursday, said "portions of the award" were annulled but did not give a breakdown of figures.

A spokesman for the U.S.-based oil company, Todd Spitler, did not confirm financial details, but said: "Exxon Mobil will continue to evaluate its legal rights and determine next steps."

Venezuela had challenged the 2014 award with various arguments, including that a previous decision from Paris-based International Chamber of Commerce to award Exxon $908 million should be deducted from the ICSID award.

Chavez, the firebrand socialist leader whose rule was cut short by death from cancer, nationalized a range of oil ventures, including the Cerro Negro heavy crude project and a smaller project called La Ceiba, both operated by Exxon.

Despite its appeal of the World Bank court's initial ruling in the Exxon case, Venezuela's government had hailed that as a success because the company had been seeking compensation of up to $10 billion.

Chavez led a wave of takeovers that also encompassed the electricity, telecoms, metal and agricultural sectors. Many companies deemed the takeovers unlawful, and Venezuela faces more than 20 international arbitration cases.

Supporters of Chavez's nationalizations say he was right to take back control of Venezuela's commodities riches to channel the profits into social programs at home rather than profits for multinational companies.

USA-Tillerson s'est récusé du dossier de l'oléoduc Keystone XL - 路透新闻

{{20170310T003422.005+0000}}USA-Tillerson s'est récusé du dossier de l'oléoduc Keystone XL10 mars (Reuters) - Le secrétaire d'Etat américain Rex Tillerson s'est récusé des questions liées à la demande de permis déposée par la société TransCanada auprès du gouvernement américain pour construire l'oléoduc Keystone XL, écrit jeudi le département d'Etat dans une lettre adressée à Greenpeace.

Rex Tillerson était juqu'à l'an dernier le PDG du géant pétrolier Exxon Mobil , ce qui pourrait provoquer un conflit d'intérêt dans ce dossier.

"Il n'a pas travaillé sur ce sujet au département d'Etat et il ne jouera aucun rôle dans les délibérations ou la décision finale sur la demande de TransCanada", assure dans la lettre la conseillère juridique du département d'Etat, Katherine McManus.

Greenpeace a écrit mercredi au département d'Etat et au Bureau d'éthique gouvernementale pour demander à Rex Tillerson de se récuser, en faisant valoir qu'Exxon Mobil bénéficierait "directement et de manière prévisible" de la construction de l'oléoduc Keystone XL compte tenu de ses investissements dans les champs de sable bitumineux canadiens.

Selon Katherine McManus, le secrétaire d'Etat s'est récusé début février des questions liées à la procédure relancée par TransCanada après l'élection de Donald Trump à la présidence des Etats-Unis.

La société canadienne a tenté pendant cinq ans d'obtenir un permis pour construire l'oléoduc de près de 1.900 km de long entre l'Alberta, au Canada, et le Nebraska, aux Etats-Unis, jusqu'à ce que le président Barack Obama rejette le projet en 2015 en invoquant ces conséquences environnementales.

Mais Donald Trump, qui avait promis pendant la campagne électorale de faciliter l'exploitation des énergies fossiles et la construction d'infrastructures, a signé dès son arrivée à la Maison blanche un décret en ce sens, ce qui a incité TransCanada à déposer une nouvelle demande de permis en janvier.

UPDATE 1-Tillerson has recused himself from Keystone pipeline issues -State Dept - 路透新闻

{{20170310T001546.922+0000}}UPDATE 1-Tillerson has recused himself from Keystone pipeline issues -State Dept(Adds quotes, details, background)

WASHINGTON, March 9 (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has recused himself from issues related to TransCanada Corp's application for a permit for the Keystone XL pipeline, the State Department said in a letter on Thursday to the environmental group Greenpeace.

"He has not worked on that matter at the Department of State, and will play no role in the deliberations or ultimate resolution of TransCanada's application," said the letter from Katherine McManus, the State Department's deputy legal adviser.

McManus' letter came after Greenpeace wrote to officials at the State Department and the Office of Government Ethics on Wednesday, urging Tillerson recuse himself from any decisions on the multibillion-dollar pipeline, given his former role as chief executive officer of Exxon Mobil Corp. .

Greenpeace argued in its letter that Exxon Mobil would "directly and predictably" benefit from the approval of Keystone XL because the firm has investments in Canadian oil sands.

Tillerson recused himself from the matter in early February, McManus wrote.

TransCanada tried for more than five years to build the 1,179-mile (1,897-km) pipeline, until President Barack Obama rejected it in 2015.

TransCanada resubmitted its application for the Keystone project in January, after Obama's White House successor, Donald Trump, signed an order smoothing its path.

The line is designed to link existing pipeline networks in Canada and the United States to bring crude from Alberta and North Dakota to refineries in Illinois en route to the Gulf of Mexico.

"Exxon Mobil could benefit from the approval of the pipeline if it has specific contracts or agreements with TransCanada either to transport their Canadian tar sands production, or to receive such shipments at their U.S. refineries," Greenpeace wrote in its letter on Wednesday.

Tillerson wrote in a January letter to McManus that for one year after his resignation from Exxon Mobil, he "will not participate personally and substantially in any particular matter involving specific parties in which I know that Exxon Mobil is a party or represents a party, unless I am first authorized to participate."

UPDATE 2-Shell sells Canadian oil sands, ties bonuses to emissions cuts - Reuters News

{{20170309T211304.108+0000}}UPDATE 2-Shell sells Canadian oil sands, ties bonuses to emissions cuts* Shell sells interests in new, existing oil sands projects

* Buys half of Marathon Oil Canada

* Total deal value of $7.25 bln for Shell

* Ties 10 pct of directors' bonuses to emissions management

(Adds Marathon Oil details)

By Karolin Schaps

LONDON, March 9 (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell has agreed to sell most of its Canadian oil sands assets for $8.5 billion, the latest international oil major to withdraw from the costly and carbon-heavy projects.

Shell is trying to sell assets totalling $30 billion to cut debt following its $54 billion acquisition of BG Group and is under investor pressure to mitigate climate change risks.

Shell also said on Thursday that 10 percent of directors' bonuses will now be tied to how well it manages greenhouse gas emissions in refining, chemical and upstream operations. [nL8N1DU5G2][nL1N1EG1QZ]

Analysts welcomed the deal, under which Shell has agreed to sell its existing and undeveloped Canadian oil sands interests to Canadian Natural Resources and to cut its share in the Athabasca Oil Sands Project (AOSP) to 10 percent from 60 percent.

"This significant divestment should help de-gear Shell's balance sheet over 2017 and help remove concerns around the dividend," said Biraj Borkhataria, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets.

Shell is also buying half of Marathon Oil Canada Corp , which brings the deal's value for Shell to $7.25 billion and its divestment plan total to around $20 billion, as it works towards its target of $30 billion by late 2018.

Other oil firms including Exxon Mobil , Conoco Phillips and Statoil have written down or sold their Canadian oil sand assets. [nL2N1GC0FG]

Shell said it would remain as operator of the AOSP Scotford upgrader and the Quest carbon capture and storage project.

MARATHON MOVES

Separately, Marathon Oil said it would spend $1.1 billion for roughly 70,000 acres in the Permian Basin in a deal with privately-held BC Operating Inc, using proceeds from the Shell deal to expand in the largest U.S. oilfield.

The move comes as Exxon, Pioneer Natural Resources Co and others have ramped up operations in the Permian, one of the cheapest places to pump oil in the United States.

That has drawn interest from investors all over the world. The oil industry poured more than $28 billion into land acquisitions last year in the Permian - more than triple what was spent there a year earlier.[nL1N1FM1EO]

Marathon Oil inked the deal for far less than many peers have recently done in similar transactions, paying roughly $13,900 per acre, factoring in existing production. Some recent acreage deals in the Permian have eclipsed $50,000 per acre.

The company plans to immediately boost spending on the new acreage by adding a drilling rig.

Shares of Marathon rose 8.1 percent to $16.07 on the New York Stock Exchange. ($1 = 0.9482 euros)

U.S. shale firms lift reserves while oil majors take Canada hit - 路透新闻

{{20170309T173539.098+0000}}U.S. shale firms lift reserves while oil majors take Canada hitBy Swetha Gopinath and Arathy S Nair

March 8 (Reuters) - Top shale oil producers are lifting their crude and gas reserve estimates for the first time in two years - even as many major oil companies are cutting the same projections and taking write downs on more expensive fields.

Rising confidence in the growth prospects of the U.S. shale patch is in striking contrast to the retreat of the world's top oil firms from the high-cost oil sands of Canada.

The increase in reported shale reserves is driven by new drilling efficiencies, leaner operations and improved well completion techniques, industry experts said.

"Many wells that were not profitable a year ago have become profitable" because those advances have cut the cost of producing from shale, said Per Magnus Nysveen, a senior partner at consultancy Rystad Energy.

The top 20 U.S. shale firms - a group that includes Pioneer Natural Resources Co and Chesapeake Energy Corp, - hiked their proved oil reserves by nearly 7 percent on average in 2016, according to a Reuters review of year-end financial filings.

While shale producers reap the benefits of technological advances, oil majors that bet billions of dollars on giant long-term projects in Canada have taken a hit.

On Thursday, Royal Dutch Shell plc became the latest energy giant to quit on oil sands. Shell said it would remove 2 billion barrels of oil from its reserves and take a $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion after-tax impairment in a retreat from most of its Canadian oil sands operations. [nL5N1GM1VZ]

Exxon Mobil Corp and ConocoPhillips last month reported total reductions of nearly 5 billion barrels of proved reserves from oil sands projects after deciding they could not be pumped at current prices.

Overall, the 10 U.S. oil companies with the largest holdings in conventional oil fields reduced their reserves by 13.4 percent in 2016, according to a Reuters' analysis of year-end regulatory filings.

SHALE TURNAROUND

In 2015, the same shale firms, a group which do not operate in conventional oil fields, reported that proved reserves had fallen by 13 percent on average as low oil prices made many fields unprofitable.

Firms operating in shale oil fields use hydraulic fracturing to tap oil in rock formations that cannot be accessed by conventional drilling methods.

The reserves reflect oil and gas that can be profitably tapped in the next five years and are valued by investors as a measure of future revenue growth. Greater reserves also can give the companies more borrowing power.

The 2016 shale reserve gains, while modest, came as conventional drillers were paring back their own estimates as oil prices remain below the levels needed to make output from higher cost fields profitable. The cost of pumping a barrel of oil from Canada's oil sands is much higher than the cost of producing oil from shale.

The reported 2016 increases in shale reserves are based on U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rules and use an average West Texas Intermediate oil price of $42.75 per barrel in 2016.

The oil price on Thursday fell below $50 per barrel amid worries about growing crude inventories, especially from shale producers.

Shale producers' reported natural gas reserves were based on a $2.49 per million British Thermal Units (MMBtu) average price in 2016, down from $2.58 a year earlier.

Recent production increases from U.S. shale fields have rattled OPEC producers aiming to pare global crude inventories. In remarks to industry executives at an energy conference in Houston this week, Saudi Oil Minister Khalid al-Falih warned that OPEC won't accept shale oil rivals getting "free rides" from its production cutbacks.

The implied threat was that OPEC could reverse the output cuts, which took effect in January, and flood the world market with oil, kicking off another price war. The curbs have boosted oil prices and in turn revived the shale industry in the United States after a two-year downturn.

BOOST FROM TECHNOLOGY

The technological improvements in shale fields include the ability to drill further into the earth, both vertically and horizontally, creating more underground sites in each well for hydraulic fracturing.

"Reserve growth really comes down to better well design," said Michael Dynan, vice president for portfolio and strategic development at Schramm, a manufacturer of drilling rigs.

Such changes are helping oil firms tap more oil and gas while keeping spending low. Continental Resources Inc says it found twice the reserves per dollar spent in 2016 than in 2014.

More recently, producers have also embraced big data analysis techniques that are providing "a lot of insight into how best to drill a well, where to locate a well and the fracking techniques to use," said Binu Mathew, who heads digital products at GE Oil & Gas, which is merging with Baker Hughes Inc .

Such advances are only the beginning of the shale oil industry's efforts to wring more oil from wells for less money, said Stephen Ingram, southern region director of Halliburton Co's completion and production business.

HIGHER CONFIDENCE

Another factor in aiding reserves is the sharp decline last year in fees charged by oilfield service suppliers.

Oilfield service firms are looking to take back some of the discounts they extended during the downturn, but shale producers say they expect to hold the line on expenses as they continue to expand production. [nL1N1G12BF]

Some of the reported gains in reserves are coming from un-drilled acreage, which makes them less certain. At least six of the companies Reuters analyzed reported a rise in proved reserves based on undeveloped properties in 2016.

Investors have increasing faith in the profit potential of such undeveloped properties, however.

"Confidence is very high that they are going to be turned into proved, producing assets," said Todd Heltman, a senior energy analyst at investment firm Neuberger Berman.

Still, some investors worry that shale firms are becoming too aggressive about booking undeveloped reserves.

"There is no geological risk here, but if your wells don't live up to your expectations, you have negative reserve revisions," said Bill Costello, a portfolio manager at Westwood Holdings Group, referring to downgrading proved reserves to uneconomic-to-tap categories.

REFILE-UPDATE 2-Exxon stumps up $2.8 bln for Mozambique gas gateway to Asia - Reuters News

* Exxon to take 25 pct stake in Mozambique gas field

* Field is one of the world's largest recent gas finds

* Exxon will be in charge of building onshore LNG plants

By Ahmed Farhatha and Stephen Jewkes

March 9 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp , the world's biggest publicly traded oil producer, has agreed to pay Italy's Eni $2.8 billion for a 25 percent stake in a giant Mozambique gas field to strengthen its position supplying rich Asian markets.

Eni is currently the operator of Mozambique's Area 4 licence which, with 85 trillion cubic feet of gas in place, is one of the world's largest gas discoveries in recent years.

The offshore reserves - big enough to supply Germany, Britain, France and Italy with gas for nearly two decades - need a string of giant onshore and offshore liquefied natural gas (LNG) plants whose proximity to fast-growing consumer markets in Asia make the project highly lucrative.

The deal will put Exxon in charge of developing one of the world's biggest new sources of LNG after trailing peers such as Royal Dutch Shell , which is doubling-down on the growth potential of gas as the world switches to cleaner-burning fuels.

"This strategic investment will enable ExxonMobil's LNG leadership and experience to support development of Mozambique's abundant natural gas resources," Exxon Chairman and CEO Darren Woods said in a statement on Thursday.

The deal shows energy groups are still willing to invest in new production when the stakes are high enough, despite spending cuts put in place to offset the oil price slide.

It will also give Mozambique the chance to transform itself from one of the world's poorest countries into a wealthier state and a major global LNG exporter.

With billions of dollars tied up in developing its giant Zohr gas find in Egypt, Eni will also benefit from Exxon's deep-pockets and track-record of delivering complex LNG plants in remote areas on time and to budget.

The state-controlled company, which is selling down stakes in some of its prize discoveries to help fund growth and support dividends, has raised more than $9 billion in the last four years from disposals.

In 2013, Eni sold 20 percent of its Area 4 stake to China's CNPC for $4.2 billion but since then oil and gas prices have come down sharply.

At 1400 GMT, Eni stock was down 1.7 percent at 14.55 euros.

"Mozambique is going to be one of the world's largest gas hubs in the next 10-15 years and Exxon has to be there," Mediobanca oil analyst Alessandro Pozzi said.

EXXON SAVVY

Under the deal, Eni will continue to lead all upstream operations in Area 4, while Exxon will be in charge of building the onshore LNG plants.

Eni, which has previously estimated overall investments at around $50 billion, said it would remain in charge of building the floating LNG plant in the Coral field, part of Area 4.

Talks to bring on board a technically-savvy partner like Exxon have dragged on for months due to differences over valuations due to falling oil and gas prices.

Last year, sources told Reuters Eni had wrapped up the deal with Exxon but it would not be announced for several months at Exxon's request. [nL8N1AM34L]

Exxon is already present in Mozambique after winning exploration licences last year for offshore blocks to the south of Area 4.

POINT MARCHÉS-Wall Street prudente à l'ouverture avec le pétrole - 路透新闻

{{20170309T144705.745+0000}}POINT MARCHÉS-Wall Street prudente à l'ouverture avec le pétrole9 mars (Reuters) - La Bourse de New York a débuté sur une note prudente jeudi à la veille des chiffres mensuels de l'emploi aux Etats-Unis et sur fond de recul marqué des cours du pétrole.

Quelques minutes après l'ouverture, l'indice Dow Jones <.DJI> grapille 0,03% à 20.863,03 points. Le Standard & Poor's 500 <.SPX>, plus large, gagne 0,05% à 2.362,52 points et le Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> est pratiquement inchangé, à 5.837,70 points.

Le secteur de l'énergie pèse toutefois sur la tendance boursière, les cours du pétrole perdant autour de 2%, sous 50 dollars le baril pour le brut léger américain (West Texas Intermediate, WTI) , au lendemain de l'annonce d'un nouveau record des stocks de brut aux Etats-Unis.

L'indice sectoriel S&P cède 0,54% <.SPNY>, Exxon Mobil 0,72% et Chevron 0,56%.

Les banques soutiennent en revanche la tendance: Goldman Sachs , plus forte hausse du Dow, prend 0,6% et JPMorgan Chase & Co 0,41%.

Avant le rapport mensuel sur l'emploi attendu vendredi, les inscriptions hebdomadaires au chômage sont ressorties en hausse à 243.000 alors que les économistes interrogés par Reuters prévoyaient en moyenne un chiffre de 235.000 après le plus bas de 44 ans touché la semaine précédente à 223.000.[nZON17YS04]

En Europe, au moment de l'ouverture des marchés américains, les principaux indices boursiers évoluaient en ordre dispersé mais au-dessus de leurs plus bas du jour, les déclarations de Mario Draghi, le président de la Banque centrale européenne (BCE), ayant provoqué une nette hausse des valeurs bancaires.

La BCE, sans surprise, a laissé sa politique monétaire inchangée [nL5N1GM4F2] et Mario Draghi a souligné lors de sa conférence de presse que la probabilité d'une baisse supplémentaire des taux d'intérêt avait diminué, ce qui a permis à l'euro de remonter à plus de 1,06 dollar et permet à l'indice Stoxx des banques européennes <.SX7P> de gagner plus de 1%.

L'indice paneuropéen Stoxx 600 <.STOXX> reste toutefois en baisse de 0,1% environ tandis que le CAC 40 <.FCHI> à Paris est en légère hausse et que le Dax <.GDAXI> à Francfort est revenu à l'équilibre.

Le dollar abandonne 0,25% face à un panier de devises de référence <.DXY>.

Dans l'actualité des fusions-acquisitions, PPG Industries perd 2,15% après le rejet par le néerlandais Akzo Nobel d'une offre d'achat hostile le valorisant 21 milliards d'euros. [nL5N1GM12X]

Eni sells Exxon 25 pct stake in Mozambique gas field for $2.8 bln - 路透新闻

{{20170309T112939.606+0000}}Eni sells Exxon 25 pct stake in Mozambique gas field for $2.8 blnMILAN, March 8 (Reuters) - Exxonmobil said on Thursday it had agreed to buy a 25 percent stake in the giant Mozambique gas field of Italian major Eni for about $2.8 billion.

Eni, which is selling stakes in a number of fields to fund development of other projects, is currently the operator of Mozambique's Area 4 where it holds a 50 percent indirect stake held through Eni East Africa.

The field holds about 85 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and is one of the world's largest gas discoveries in recent years.

Under the deal Eni will continue to lead all upstream operations in the area, while ExxonMobil will be in charge of building the onshore liquefied natural (LNG) gas plants.

The Italian major said it will remain in charge of building the floating LNG plant in the Coral field, which is part of Area 4.

The area 4 project envisages the construction of onshore and offshore LNG plants to export the gas to areas such as India and Asia.

In 2013 Eni sold 20 percent of its Area 4 stake to China's CNPC for $4.2 billion but since then oil and gas prices have come down sharply.

Eni, Exxonmobil acquisterà 25% area 4 Mozambico per 2,8 mld dlr  - 路透新闻

{{20170309T112428.604+0000}}Eni, Exxonmobil acquisterà 25% area 4 Mozambico per 2,8 mld dlr MILANO, 9 marzo (Reuters) - Eni cederà a ExxonMobil la partecipazione del 25% dell'area 4 nell'offshore del Mozambico. La major petrolifera italiana detiene indirettamente una quota del 50% nel blocco attraverso una partecipazione del 71,4% in Eni East Africa, la quale a sua volta detiene il 70% della concessione Area 4. La partecipazione di Eni si ridurrà quindi al 25%.

E' quanto si legge in un comunicato congiunto.

Le condizioni concordate prevedono un prezzo di circa 2,8 miliardi di dollari.

Eni continuerà a gestire il progetto Coral Floating Lng e tutte le operazioni upstream nell'area 4, mentre ExxonMobil guiderà la costruzione e la gestione degli impianti di liquefazione di gas naturale a terra, spiega la nota.

A seguito del completamento della transazione, Eni East Africa sarà controllata pariteticamente da Eni ed ExxonMobil, ciascuna con il 35,7%, mentre Cnpc deterrà il 28,6%.

Le rimanenti quote nell'area 4 sono detenute da Empresa Nacional de Hidrocarbonetos E.P. (Enh 10%), Kogas (10%) e Galp Energia (10%).

Nel commentare il deal, l'AD Claudio Descalzi, sottolinea che "grazie a questo approccio, Eni è stata in grado di realizzare oltre 9 miliardi di dollari negli ultimi 4 anni. Questo accordo conferma inoltre l'assoluta qualità dell'intero progetto, sia dal punto di vista delle sue potenzialità sia da quello della sua solidità tecnica e finanziaria".

POINT MARCHÉS-Wall Street baisse, pénalisée par le pétrole - 路透新闻

{{20170308T220328.467+0000}}POINT MARCHÉS-Wall Street baisse, pénalisée par le pétrole(Actualisé avec volumes, dollar, Treasuries, or)

* Le Dow a perdu 0,33% et le S&P-500 0,23%, le Nasdaq a pris 0,06%

* Le secteur de l'énergie plombé par la chute du pétrole

* Une hausse de taux semble se préciser

par Chuck Mikolajczak

8 mars (Reuters) - La Bourse de New York a fini mercredi en ordre dispersé, le Dow Jones et le S&P-500 étant particulièrement pénalisés par la chute des cours du pétrole.

L'indice Dow Jones <.DJI> a perdu 69,03 points, soit 0,33%, à 20.855,73. Le Standard & Poor's 500 <.SPX>, plus large et principale référence des investisseurs, a cédé 5,41 points, soit 0,23%, à 2.362,98. Soutenu notamment par Microsoft (+0,92%), le Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> a en revanche arraché un gain de 3,62 points (0,06%) à 5.837,55.

Il s'agit de la troisième séance consécutive de baisse pour le Dow et le S&P-500. Ces deux indices, comme le Nasdaq, ont touché des records la semaine dernière dans l'espoir que le Congrès et Donald Trump s'entendront sur des mesures de relance budgétaire, de dérégulation et de baisses d'impôts défendues par le nouveau président américain.

"Les actions sont au carrefour de l'optimisme et de l'inquiétude et elles vont probablement aller dans un sens et dans l'autre jusqu'à ce que nous obtenions plus de clarté de la part de la Fed et des législateurs", dit Terry Sandven, responsable de la stratégie actions chez US Bank Wealth Management.

"Je pense que dans une certaine mesure, les actions sont valorisées à la perfection et plusieurs indicateurs invitent à la prudence", ajoute-t-il.

Le secteur privé américain a pourtant créé 248.000 postes le mois dernier selon l'enquête du cabinet ADP, alors que le consensus Reuters donnait un chiffre de 190.000 seulement. [nZON1YYR06]

Cette enquête est considérée comme un bon indicateur de la tendance du marché du travail et les investisseurs attendent désormais la publication vendredi du rapport mensuel du département du Travail, qui sera décortiqué à la loupe avant la réunion de politique monétaire de la Réserve fédérale, mardi et mercredi prochains.

CATERPILLAR RECULE, UNE ENQUÊTE POUR FRAUDE FISCALE ÉVOQUÉE

Le marché juge désormais quasi certain un relèvement d'un quart de point de l'objectif de taux des "fed funds" le 15 mars et la principale interrogation porte maintenant sur la possibilité d'une accélération du rythme du resserrement monétaire.

Cette perspective n'a cependant pas profité aux valeurs financières <.SPSY>, stables, même si le titre Citigroup (+1,00%) a touché un pic de plus de huit ans.

Elle a en revanche pesé sur les secteurs généralement recherchés pour leur rendement, comme les services aux collectivités ("utilities") <.SPLRCU> (-1,54%).

Ce sont toutefois les valeurs de l'énergie <.SPNY> qui ont collectivement le plus souffert ce mardi avec un recul de 2,54% en raison de la chute de plus de 5% des cours du pétrole après l'annonce d'une augmentation plus forte que prévu des stocks de brut la semaine dernière aux Etats-Unis. [nL5N1GL6AO]

Exxon Mobil (-1,81%) et Chevron (-1,97%) ont lourdement pesé sur le Dow et ont été les principaux freins sur le S&P-500, sur lequel les huit plus fortes baisses sont à mettre au débit d'entreprises du secteur de l'énergie comme Marathon Oil (-8,66%).

Autre valeur à la baisse, la plus forte du Dow, Caterpillar a cédé 2,82% après un article du New York Times selon lequel un rapport établi à la demande des autorités fédérales américaines conclut que le géant des engins de terrassement et de travaux publics s'est rendu coupable de fraude fiscale et de fraude comptable lors du rapatriement de milliards de dollars de trésorerie détenus par des filiales étrangères.

Le spécialiste des revêtements PPG Industries a pour sa part bondi de 6% sur des rumeurs de rapprochement avec le néerlandais Akzo Nobel . [nL5N1GL68J]

Environ 7,07 milliards de titres ont été échangés sur les marchés actions américains, ce qui est légèrement supérieur à la moyenne quotidienne de 6,94 milliards sur les 20 dernières séances.

La perspective d'une hausse des taux la semaine prochaine de la part de la Fed a contribué à raffermir le dollar, remonté juste en-dessous d'un pic de deux mois touché la semaine dernière face à un panier de devises de référence <.DXY>.

CERAWEEK-Oil majors still years from repairing balance sheets after price war - 路透新闻

{{20170308T165530.950+0000}}CERAWEEK-Oil majors still years from repairing balance sheets after price warBy Ernest Scheyder and Gary McWilliams

HOUSTON, March 8 (Reuters) - Financially strapped oil producers are spending billions to boost production before it's clear that recent crude price gains brought on by OPEC output cuts can be sustained.

Five of the largest publicly traded oil companies - BP , Chevron , Exxon Mobil , Royal Dutch Shell , and Total - are trying to work down debts that totaled $297 billion at the end of December. That nearly doubled the companies' 2012 debt levels.

But even with oil prices about 70 percent higher than a year ago, most companies have yet to reach the point where their cash flow covers annual shareholder payouts and expansion projects vital to the industry's long-term survival.

Add other expenses, such as the interest on debt, and the break-even point is pushed out until at least 2020, industry analysts from Citigroup estimated.

"For the entire oil and gas industry, balance sheets have never been worse," said Fadel Gheit, an Oppenheimer & Co oil industry analyst. Producers, he said, "were in critical condition and have been upgraded to guarded."

For a graphic on oil majors' debt, cash flow and capital spending, see: http://tmsnrt.rs/2mzgTVc

For now, U.S. producers are taking advantage of the price increase spurred by OPEC's production cuts to boost their output. Some of the oil they are pumping would not have been profitable at $40 a barrel, but is with prices holding steady above $50.

The industry is betting that prices will maintain a delicate balance - high enough to repair balance sheets and finance new projects, but not so high that it creates a new glut.

If crude maintains a price in the mid-$50s per barrel, the biggest oil producers could see their cash flows increase by 71 percent on average over 2016, according to Citigroup.

The danger is that too many wells could come back online too soon, undercutting OPEC's effort to reduce global inventories. That could send prices back to the 12-year lows of early 2016.

U.S. shale producers in March are forecast to pump 79,000 barrels a day (bpd) more than in February, when shale contributed about 4.75 million bpd to U.S. output, according to the U.S. Energy Information Agency, reversing production declines last year. [nL1N1FE5NT]

Shale output could rise more than 500,000 bpd by the end of the year, said Daniel Yergin, vice chairman of analysis firm IHS Markit and an oil historian.

"U.S. shale has demonstrated that it's still a player," Yergin said in an interview. "It's going to continue to be a major factor in the global market."

SPENDING AGAIN

Most majors are planning strong production growth until at least 2021, a Reuters analysis of the latest investor presentation and corporate plans showed.

The firms - Royal Dutch Shell, Exxon Mobil, Chevron, BP, Total, Statoil and Eni - plan to grow output by a combined 15 percent in the next five years.[nL5N1GJ31I][nL5N1GJ31I]

It could take another year before the biggest companies' cash from operations exceeds their combined capital spending and dividends, Citigroup estimated. It projects the major oil producers will need to sell their oil for between $55 and $60 per barrel this year just to cover those two big costs.

Chevron Corp, which expects positive cash flow this year, says it could generate an additional $3.5 billion selling its oil at $55 a barrel, a figure predicted to be 2017's average price in a Reuters poll of analysts and economists. [O/POLL]

Exxon Mobil Corp and BP have signaled they will spend more on expansion projects this year than in 2016, a sign of optimism about stronger pricing.[nL1N1FL0M7][nL5N1FS16K]

Higher production could deliver fresh money that can be used to hire workers, reduce debt or boost shareholder payouts.

It would also be a welcome turn for an industry that has been spending more cash than it generates and borrowing to pay dividends that shareholders expect, regardless of the state of the industry.

John Watson, Chevron's chief executive, said in late January he wants to "maintain and grow" the oil giant's dividend, calling it his top priority.

Chevron is winding down construction of several big projects, helping to stem its past spending rate and generate more revenue as new operations come online.

France's Total SA is raising its dividend by 1.6 percent this year, the first time in three years, and says it expects to cover its capital spending and cash dividend with oil above $50 a barrel.[nL5N1FU1JC]

The gains are driven largely by the OPEC output cut in November - the first in eight years. The agreement to reduce supply by about 1.8 million barrels a day runs through June, and OPEC and Russia are expected to review the cut in May.

Some analysts expect the agreement to be extended, but the cartel could just as easily resume higher production, squelching the industry's nascent financial recovery.[nL8N1G737L]

Torgrim Reitan, head of U.S. operations for Statoil - Norway's state-owned firm - said he has "stopped guessing" what OPEC might do in crafting the company's plans.

"We need to be prepared for volatility," he said in an interview at the CERAWeek energy conference in Houston. "This is the time for leadership in the oil industry, the time for making the right decisions that will fuel growth."

THE SHALE ADVANTAGE

Unlike the major producers, U.S. shale companies are better equipped to live with volatility. When prices rise, they ramp up drilling and lock in returns with price hedges, which Chevron, Exxon and other large producers typically don't do.

When prices fall, shale producers can more easily cut spending than the majors because of their small size.

Shale producers' ability to pour more of their new cash into production is feeding technology developments that allow them to squeeze more oil out of existing wells and at a faster pace than a few years ago.[nL1N1DU2DQ]

"Those who withstood the storm and survived have learned just how nimble they can be," said Avi Mirman, chief executive of Lilis Energy Inc , a shale oil producer in west Texas.

Similar approaches are belatedly being adopted by the biggest producers. Chevron is embracing a short-cycle approach to investing in projects that can go into production in months, not years.

However, Alastair Syme, who tracks global oil and gas companies for Citigroup, cautions the continued cost reductions by shale producers could thwart OPEC's ability to prop oil prices through production cuts, undercutting the cash flows needed to rebuild.

"If shale producers can grow U.S. supply at between 1 million and 1.5 million barrels a day, it'll be a challenge for everyone to respond to that," he said in an interview.

Statoil plans to extend Statfjord A output until 2022 - 路透新闻

{{20170308T105200.571+0000}}Statoil plans to extend Statfjord A output until 2022OSLO, March 8 (Reuters) - Norway's Statoil plans to extend production at its oldest oil platform still in operation, the Statfjord A, until 2022, two years longer than previously planned, the company said in a letter to the country's Ministry of Petroleum and Energy.

"Earlier cease of production may still occur, and work is also ongoing to assess possibilities of prolonged production beyond 2022," the company added in the letter obtained by Reuters.

Statoil had planned to halt Statfjord A's production in 2016, but decided in 2013 to extend operations until 2020 to squeeze more oil from the field.

Other partners in the field are ExxonMobil and Centrica .

RPT-COLUMN-Oil industry costs will rise as focus shifts to growth: Kemp - 路透新闻

By John Kemp

LONDON, March 7 (Reuters) - Oil industry costs are notoriously pro-cyclical, which is one of the main reasons for the pattern of boom and bust that has afflicted in the industry from the beginning.

The cost of everything from skilled and unskilled labour to engineering contracts, field services, raw materials, equipment, spare parts and rig hire tends to rise and fall with price of oil.

During a boom, prices for labour and equipment escalate rapidly, pushing up the breakeven cost of finding and developing new deposits, and driving the market-clearing price of oil even higher.

In a bust, labour and equipment prices fall sharply, pushing down breakeven costs and helping sustain production at an unexpectedly high level despite the plunge in oil prices.

Pro-cyclical costs include everything from skilled petroleum engineers and unskilled labour, to fuel, rig hire and drill bits.

Pro-cyclical costs apply to a host of other services in the supply chain including catering, accommodation and transportation.

And in the broadest sense, pro-cyclical costs include taxes, royalties and other government charges on exploration and production.

In a downturn, governments cut tax and royalty rates, and offer regulatory relief, to attract investment, only to increase them again during a boom to capture windfall gains.

The pro-cyclical behaviour of costs is a classic example of positive feedback which amplifies the boom-bust cycle in oil prices and delays the process of adjustment following a supply or demand shock.

Pro-cyclical costs ensure crude supply tends to respond sluggishly to even a big change in oil prices ("Oil prices: volatility and prediction", Reuters, 2016).

Rising costs hampered efforts to boost oil production during the 2004-2014 boom; more recently falling costs have hampered efforts to cut output and rebalance the market during the slump.

The best symbol of the industry's cost cycle is the provision of free fruit to employees at BP's giant Sunbury campus near London ("Operational excellence becomes oil industry watchword (again)", Reuters, 2015).

Free fruit tends to be axed when oil prices fall, only to return when prices rise, as the company's priority switches between cost control and employee morale.

Free fruit is a trivial example but multiplied up by thousands of items in the supply chain it shows how the entire cost structure can rise and fall by tens of billions of dollars per year.

STRUCTURAL v CYCLICAL

The recent slump in oil prices has been accompanied by brutal cost-cutting across the entire oil and gas industry.

U.S. drilling companies cut their prices by a third between March 2014 and January 2017, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (http://tmsnrt.rs/2midNVb).

Cheaper prices for everything from drilling contracts to labour, fracking sand, pressure pumping and freight have helped lower breakeven prices for U.S. shale producers.

Similar cost reduction strategies have been implemented by state-owned oil companies such as Saudi Aramco as well as major privately-owned companies such as Exxon , Shell and BP.

As a result, breakeven prices for the entire oil industry from OPEC to shale and offshore producers have tumbled since 2014.

The critical question is how much of this reduction is structural and permanent versus how much is cyclical and will be reversed as oil prices start to recover.

Oil industry leaders insist this time will be different and that they will maintain tight control over expenses even as oil prices rise.

Some of the efficiency improvements wrung from the supply chain during the slump are likely to prove enduring.

Standardisation of equipment and procedures, as well as better targeting of production zones, longer lateral sections in wells, and multilayer wells are improvements that will not be unlearned.

Past experience indicates, however, that costs have a large cyclical component and will start to increase as producers shift from contraction to expansion.

Changes in drilling costs, for example, have been closely associated with changes in the number of rigs drilling for oil and gas.

U.S. drilling prices were down 7 percent in January 2017 compared with January 2016, according to preliminary data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

But the year-on-year decline has progressively slowed from as much as 24 percent in November 2015, in an indication drilling costs are stabilising (http://tmsnrt.rs/2n1VQIz).

By early March 2017, the number of rigs drilling for oil and gas in the United States had risen by almost 60 percent compared with the same period a year ago (http://tmsnrt.rs/2n1yfb8).

As the rig count continues to climb, drilling prices should stabilise, then begin to rise, based on past experience (http://tmsnrt.rs/2mi66hG).

Fracking sand prices have already surged, owing to a combination of poor weather, supply problems and a big increase in consumption.

Oilfield service company leaders have warned contract prices have been cut to unsustainably low levels and must increase, at least in the United States.

For the time being, oil industry buyers will continue to hold the upper hand in negotiations, but the balance will shift as the industry returns to expansion mode.

And as the balance of pricing power shifts, costs will begin to escalate, and the industry's estimated breakevens are also likely to increase.

Pro-cyclical costs are a fundamental rather than incidental feature of the supply chain and there is no reason to believe that will change.

Appeals for cost discipline may work in the short term, but in the medium term they are no more likely to be successful than in the past.

BREAKINGVIEWS-Big Oil drills through White House policy crust - 路透新闻

{{20170307T193403.913+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-Big Oil drills through White House policy crust(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.)

By Lauren Silva Laughlin

HOUSTON, March 7 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Washington, we have a problem. That's the implied message from Houston, where energy bosses are gathered for their annual hootenanny.

The CERAWeek event kicked off with a gushing letter from the White House praising Exxon Mobil for its plan, originally unveiled in 2013 and curiously touted again on Monday, to invest and hire in America. President Donald Trump might have been less pleased, however, with other remarks by Darren Woods, the company's new chief executive.

In his first major public speech since taking over for Rex Tillerson, now Trump's secretary of state, Woods embraced free trade and environmental initiatives. "I want to challenge the assumption made by many that a growing economy and a cleaner environment are mutually exclusive," Woods said. He added, separately, "It's hard to be in our business and not support open markets and free trade."

The comments, and other similar ones expressed by oil and gas executives throughout the Houston Hilton, notably clash with the new administration's climate-change and border-tax positions.

International markets are dictating the agenda. Some 37 percent of power generation is expected to come from renewable sources by 2040, up from 23 percent now, according to the International Energy Agency. Despite Trump's intention to pull out of the Paris climate accord, nearly 200 countries, including China, are forging ahead with plans to reduce carbon emissions as they collectively agreed.

In terms of trade, there are concerns in the U.S. energy sector – despite a sizeable increase in domestic production – that a so-called border-adjustment tax under consideration, which would eliminate deductions for import costs, would be harmful. Dan Romasko, CEO of refiner Motiva, for one, said he thought it would lead to higher gasoline prices and create a consumer backlash. "It's hard to believe they won't think of this as a subsidy to energy producers," he said.

Al Monaco, boss of Canadian pipeline operator Enbridge , emphasized the importance of North American cooperation: "I don't see a border."

As Trump tears up trade deals and questions man-made climate change, global economic forces are naturally resisting. And no industry is better equipped to drill through hardened dispositions than the oil business.

FACTBOX-Trump tweets have short-lived impact on stocks - 路透新闻

{{20170307T181721.858+0000}}FACTBOX-Trump tweets have short-lived impact on stocksNEW YORK, March 7 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's comments about various companies have drawn much attention, and his tweets on Tuesday marked a subtle shift in which they focused on a sector over a specific company.

But while the share prices of most companies that Trump singled out on Twitter have dropped immediately, the impact has been mostly short lived.

Following is a list of companies targeted in Trump's tweets:

DRUG COMPANIES Pfizer Inc , Merck & Co Inc , Amgen Inc and Gilead Sciences Inc : Trump sent a tweet on Tuesday before the market opened that he was "working on a new system where there will be competition in the Drug Industry. Pricing for the American people will come way down!"

Drugmakers' shares moved lower. Pfizer was down 1 percent at $34.02, and Merck fell 0.6 percent at $66.05. Both are Dow Jones industrial average components.

Amgen was off 0.9 percent at $177.88, and Gilead was 1.8 percent lower at $68.87. The PowerShares Dynamic Pharmaceutical ETF was down 1.3 percent.

EXXON MOBIL CORP : Trump congratulated the oil company in a tweet after the closing bell on Monday for an investment program that would create "45,000 construction & manufacturing jobs in the U.S. Gulf Coast region." Shares of the Dow component were down 0.8 percent at $82.19 on Tuesday.

BOEING CO : In a Dec. 6 tweet, Trump criticized costs of the Air Force One plane manufactured by the company. Shares of the Dow component closed that session little changed and since rallied nearly 19 percent through Monday's close.

UNITED TECHNOLOGIES CORP : Trump tweeted on Nov. 24 about working on a deal with the Dow component to keep jobs at its Carrier unit in Indiana. The stock gained 0.6 percent in the session following the Thanksgiving holiday and had advanced nearly 4 percent through Monday.

LOCKHEED MARTIN CORP : Trump tweeted on Dec. 12 that the U.S. defense company's F-35 fighter jet program was "out of control." Lockheed Martin shares fell 2.5 percent on the day of the tweet but have recovered since and were up 3.6 percent at Monday's close. The stock has outperformed the NYSE Arca Defense index <.DFII>, which has risen 1.4 percent over the same period.

GENERAL MOTORS CO : Trump on Jan. 3 threatened a "big border tax" on GM for making its Chevy Cruze model in Mexico. GM shares fell briefly in premarket trade following the tweets and recovered to finish the trading session up 0.9 percent. The stock since gained nearly 9 percent through Monday's close.

By John Kemp

LONDON, March 7 (Reuters) - Oil industry costs are notoriously pro-cyclical, which is one of the main reasons for the pattern of boom and bust that has afflicted in the industry from the beginning.

The cost of everything from skilled and unskilled labour to engineering contracts, field services, raw materials, equipment, spare parts and rig hire tends to rise and fall with price of oil.

During a boom, prices for labour and equipment escalate rapidly, pushing up the breakeven cost of finding and developing new deposits, and driving the market-clearing price of oil even higher.

In a bust, labour and equipment prices fall sharply, pushing down breakeven costs and helping sustain production at an unexpectedly high level despite the plunge in oil prices.

Pro-cyclical costs include everything from skilled petroleum engineers and unskilled labour, to fuel, rig hire and drill bits.

Pro-cyclical costs apply to a host of other services in the supply chain including catering, accommodation and transportation.

And in the broadest sense, pro-cyclical costs include taxes, royalties and other government charges on exploration and production.

In a downturn, governments cut tax and royalty rates, and offer regulatory relief, to attract investment, only to increase them again during a boom to capture windfall gains.

The pro-cyclical behaviour of costs is a classic example of positive feedback which amplifies the boom-bust cycle in oil prices and delays the process of adjustment following a supply or demand shock.

Pro-cyclical costs ensure crude supply tends to respond sluggishly to even a big change in oil prices ("Oil prices: volatility and prediction", Reuters, 2016).

Rising costs hampered efforts to boost oil production during the 2004-2014 boom; more recently falling costs have hampered efforts to cut output and rebalance the market during the slump.

The best symbol of the industry's cost cycle is the provision of free fruit to employees at BP's giant Sunbury campus near London ("Operational excellence becomes oil industry watchword (again)", Reuters, 2015).

Free fruit tends to be axed when oil prices fall, only to return when prices rise, as the company's priority switches between cost control and employee morale.

Free fruit is a trivial example but multiplied up by thousands of items in the supply chain it shows how the entire cost structure can rise and fall by tens of billions of dollars per year.

STRUCTURAL v CYCLICAL

The recent slump in oil prices has been accompanied by brutal cost-cutting across the entire oil and gas industry.

U.S. drilling companies cut their prices by a third between March 2014 and January 2017, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (http://tmsnrt.rs/2midNVb).

Cheaper prices for everything from drilling contracts to labour, fracking sand, pressure pumping and freight have helped lower breakeven prices for U.S. shale producers.

Similar cost reduction strategies have been implemented by state-owned oil companies such as Saudi Aramco as well as major privately-owned companies such as Exxon , Shell and BP.

As a result, breakeven prices for the entire oil industry from OPEC to shale and offshore producers have tumbled since 2014.

The critical question is how much of this reduction is structural and permanent versus how much is cyclical and will be reversed as oil prices start to recover.

Oil industry leaders insist this time will be different and that they will maintain tight control over expenses even as oil prices rise.

Some of the efficiency improvements wrung from the supply chain during the slump are likely to prove enduring.

Standardisation of equipment and procedures, as well as better targeting of production zones, longer lateral sections in wells, and multilayer wells are improvements that will not be unlearned.

Past experience indicates, however, that costs have a large cyclical component and will start to increase as producers shift from contraction to expansion.

Changes in drilling costs, for example, have been closely associated with changes in the number of rigs drilling for oil and gas.

U.S. drilling prices were down 7 percent in January 2017 compared with January 2016, according to preliminary data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

But the year-on-year decline has progressively slowed from as much as 24 percent in November 2015, in an indication drilling costs are stabilising (http://tmsnrt.rs/2n1VQIz).

By early March 2017, the number of rigs drilling for oil and gas in the United States had risen by almost 60 percent compared with the same period a year ago (http://tmsnrt.rs/2n1yfb8).

As the rig count continues to climb, drilling prices should stabilise, then begin to rise, based on past experience (http://tmsnrt.rs/2mi66hG).

Fracking sand prices have already surged, owing to a combination of poor weather, supply problems and a big increase in consumption.

Oilfield service company leaders have warned contract prices have been cut to unsustainably low levels and must increase, at least in the United States.

For the time being, oil industry buyers will continue to hold the upper hand in negotiations, but the balance will shift as the industry returns to expansion mode.

And as the balance of pricing power shifts, costs will begin to escalate, and the industry's estimated breakevens are also likely to increase.

Pro-cyclical costs are a fundamental rather than incidental feature of the supply chain and there is no reason to believe that will change.

Appeals for cost discipline may work in the short term, but in the medium term they are no more likely to be successful than in the past.

CERAWEEK-Exxon to invest $20 bln on U.S. Gulf Coast refining projects - 路透新闻

{{20170306T222702.902+0000}}CERAWEEK-Exxon to invest $20 bln on U.S. Gulf Coast refining projects(Adds Trump spokesman comments)

By Ernest Scheyder

HOUSTON, March 6 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp , the world's largest publicly traded oil producer, said on Monday it would invest $20 billion through 2022 to expand its chemical and oil refining plants on the U.S. Gulf Coast.

The investments at 11 sites should create 35,000 temporary construction jobs and 12,000 permanent jobs, Chief Executive Darren Woods said in a speech at CERAWeek, the world's largest gathering of energy executives. [nL2N1GC1LX]

Some of the expansions began in 2013, but the scope of the project is now growing and the timeline extended, Exxon said.

Woods ran Exxon's refining division before becoming CEO two months ago, and the new spending benefits a sector with which he has significant experience and comfort. Investments in the high-margin projects should help ease concerns from Wall Street that Exxon's growth potential - especially in oil and gas exploration and production - is sliding. [nL2N1GE0UU]

"Exxon Mobil is building a manufacturing powerhouse along the U.S. Gulf Coast," Woods said. "These businesses are leveraging the shale revolution to manufacture cleaner fuels and more energy-efficient plastics."

The investments across Texas and Louisiana will take advantage of cheap shale gas to make plastics and other chemicals for export. The strategy builds on prior steps Exxon and peers, including Dow Chemical Co , have taken in the wake of the American shale expansion, which sharply cut production costs.

"The supply is here. The demand is there. We want to keep connecting those dots," Woods said.

Exxon last month pledged to boost this year's spending by 16 percent to expand operations, especially in shale production, after the company posted a better-than-expected quarterly profit, helped by rising oil prices and lower costs. [nL1N1FL0M7]

U.S. President Donald Trump, who tapped former Exxon CEO Rex Tillerson for secretary of state, praised the company's spending plans as an example of "a true American success story." Most of the permanent jobs are expected to pay more than $100,000 per year.

"This is exactly the kind of investment, economic development and job creation that will help put Americans back to work," Trump said.

When asked if Trump was taking credit for an investment program that began under former President Barack Obama in 2013, White House spokesman Sean Spicer said that Exxon made it clear to the president it was investing more in the United States because of his push for fewer regulations and tax relief.

The bulk of the expansion will take place in Beaumont, Texas, with plans to expand polyethylene production, oil refining capacity and liquefied natural gas exports.

Exxon also will increase its lubricant manufacturing capacity and potentially build a new refinery to produce ethane, a key building block for chemical production.

CLIMATE CHANGE

Woods spent the larger part of his speech discussing climate change, an area for which Exxon has come under attack in the past year. The global economy can grow while also improving the climate, he said.

"I believe the assumption that affordable energy and a cleaner environment are a zero-sum game is mistaken," he said. "It underestimates the power of technology."

Woods highlighted Exxon's research into carbon capture sequestration, biofuels and other areas as ones helping the company expand its operations beyond oil and gas.

"The only way to keep winning in a competitive market is to keep innovating," he said.

Hoping to stem at least some of the environmental controversy, Exxon in January, just after Woods became CEO, named an environmentalist to its board of directors. [nL1N1FF222]

By Ron Bousso

HOUSTON, March 6 (Reuters) - Oil majors have long been passive watchers of the pump war between OPEC and U.S. shale producers, but not any more.

Majors were unable to grow output for the past decade even as oil prices soared above $100 per barrel due bad capital discipline and huge project delays.

The oil price slump since 2014 has prompted the world's biggest oil firms to drastically cut costs but also to force contractors to make projects more efficient and extract the same amount of barrels for fewer dollars.

As a result, most majors are now planning exceptionally strong production growth until at least 2021, a Reuters analysis of the latest investor presentation and corporate plans showed.

Even as prices hold near $50 per barrel, the firms - Royal Dutch Shell Plc , Exxon Mobil Corp , Chevron Corp , BP Plc , Total SA , Statoil ASA and Eni SpA - plan to grow output by a combined 15 percent in the next five years.

"This environment requires discipline on costs and strong operating performance. It will reward businesses that can remain highly competitive at these prices," BP's chief Bob Dudley said at the London-based company's strategy day last week.

The seven companies will add almost 3 million barrels per day to their combined output in the next five years effectively generating production the size of another major like Chevron.

The International Energy Agency on Monday warned that global oil supply may struggle to match demand after 2020 due to the sharp decline in investment in recent years.[nL5N1GJ3H6]

Fatih Birol, the head of the West's energy watchdog, said that investment in oil needs to rise this year by 20 percent from 2016 in order to meet the rise in demand and natural field decline.

"The first signals from oil companies are not very encouraging in terms of future investments," Birol said in a press conference at a major industry gathering in Houston.

A lot of new barrels will not be necessarily oil as firms like Shell and Eni are pressing ahead with giant gas projects.

But the development still challenges the predominant narrative in the notoriously cyclical oil sector - that the reduction of investment during more than two years of low prices would lead to a supply crunch by the end of this decade.

Many executives including the head of Total Patrick Pouyanne and Eni's Claudio Descalzi as well as the IEA have predicted a crunch by 2020, based on low levels of investments in new projects.

"The investor mindset is switching to growth again," said Anish Kapadia, analyst at investment bank Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co.

"Oil prices are above $50 a barrel, companies are generating cash and are starting to talk about growth again, we are at that point of the cycle."

THE EXXON-VS-SHELL RACE

The change in mood is expected to be reflected at this week's CERAWeek industry conference in Houston, Texas, as activity in the U.S. shale picks up rapidly and global merger and acquisition activity returns. [nL3N1GH05D] [nL5N1F239Q]

Unlike in the previous decade, when U.S. oil output growth was driven by independent firms, majors such as Exxon plan to be the driving force behind the new cycle. [nL4N1F74E1]

Exxon and Chevron are both betting much of their money on shale production which benefits from relatively low investment and rapid production.

Europe's oil majors on the other hand are focusing more on the traditional large, often offshore projects such in the Gulf of Mexico and Brazil that require big investment and years to develop but also produce larger volumes of oil and gas.

As things stand, Shell could dethrone Exxon as the biggest publicly-traded oil producer by the end of the decade with projected output of 4.23 million barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2021.

That figure could be revised down because Shell plans to dispose of more than $20 billion of assets in the next two years to pay for its $54 billion acquisition of BG Group.

The Anglo-Dutch group has already outstripped Exxon on profits in the past two quarters. [nL5N1FN1IN]

Jason Kenney, analyst at Santander, sees France's Total as particularly well positioned to benefit from the recovery in oil prices as it is now set to reap the fruit of investments already made. [nL5N1FU1JC]

"The company (Total) is benefiting from a period of 'already invested-in' growth delivery when others are debating about reinvestment for long term growth," he said.

Total leads the group of oil majors with a return on average capital employed, a ratio of profitability versus investments, of 10.2, with Exxon second at 7.3, according to Kenney.

CERAWEEK-Titanes del petróleo se reúnen en Houston después de dos años de guerra de precios - 路透新闻

{{20170306T170344.512+0000}}CERAWEEK-Titanes del petróleo se reúnen en Houston después de dos años de guerra de preciosPor Ernest Scheyder

HOUSTON, 6 mar (Reuters) - Los nombres más prominentes en la industria petrolera se darán cita esta semana en la reunión más extensa de la industria desde el fin de una guerra de precios de dos años, que enfrentó a exportadores de Oriente Medio contra firmas que impulsan la revolución del esquisto en Estados Unidos.

Cuando la OPEP se unió en noviembre a productores fuera del bloque para acordar un recorte histórico en el suministro, el grupo pidió una pausa en la pelea por cuotas de mercado que había conducido a los precios del petróleo a mínimos de 12 años y puesto a muchos productores de esquisto contra la pared.

Los precios del crudo están cerca de un 70 por ciento por encima del punto en que se encontraban la última vez que los ministros de petróleo y los presidentes ejecutivos de las grandes compañías del área se reunieron en Houston hace un año en CERAWeek, la reunión más grande de la industria en América.

El entusiasmo en momentos en que ambas partes disfrutan de mayores ingresos marcará un cálido inicio de la reunión en comparación con el pesimismo de un año atrás, en la parte más álgida de la guerra de precios.

"El mercado petrolero se ha estado equilibrando y las poderosas fuerzas de la oferta y la demanda están operando", dijo Dan Yergin, vicepresidente del organizador de la conferencia IHS Markit y ganador de un Premio Pulitzer. "El ánimo será diferente este año".

El acuerdo de la OPEP en noviembre, las perspectivas de que se extienda y prometedoras posibilidades de inversión para la industria dominarán las discusiones, en las que las grandes empresas productoras estatales y las privadas tratarán de posicionarse para un repunte en un negocio notoriamente cíclico.

Dos veces la cantidad de ministros de la OPEP en comparación con el año anterior, más funcionarios de energía de alto rango de Rusia e India, estarán en la capital de la industria petrolera estadounidense. Los presidentes ejecutivos de cinco grandes productores internacionales -BP , Chevron Corp , Exxon Mobil Corp , Royal Dutch Shell y Total - estarán escuchando atentamente los comentarios de los funcionarios y ministros para analizar si los recortes podrían extenderse después de su fecha de expiración en junio.

CERAWEEK-Titans of oil world meet in Houston after 2-yr price war - 路透新闻

{{20170306T060001.491+0000}}CERAWEEK-Titans of oil world meet in Houston after 2-yr price war(Repeats Sunday item, no change to text)

By Ernest Scheyder

HOUSTON, March 5 (Reuters) - The biggest names in the oil world come together this week for the largest industry gathering since the end of a two-year price war that pitted Middle East exporters against the firms that drove the shale energy revolution in the United States.

When OPEC in November joined with several non-OPEC producers to agree to a historic cut in output, the group called time on a fight for market share that drove oil prices to a 12-year low and many shale producers to the wall.

Oil prices are about 70 percent higher than they were the last time oil ministers and the chief executives of Big Oil met in Houston a year ago at CERAWeek, the largest annual industry meet in the Americas.

The ebullience as both sides enjoy higher revenues will be a welcome relief from the gloom of a year ago, near the depths of the price war.

"The oil market has been rebalancing and the powerful forces of supply and demand have been working," said Dan Yergin, vice chairman of conference organizer IHS Markit and a Pulitzer Prize-winning oil historian.

"The mood will be different this year."

OPEC's November deal, the prospects for its continuation and rosier investment prospects for the industry will dominate the discussions, with state-run producers and Big Oil both positioning themselves for an upturn in the notoriously cyclical business.

Twice as many OPEC ministers as a year ago - plus Russia and India's top energy officials - will be in the capital of the U.S. energy industry.

Saudi Arabia's energy minister Khalid al-Falih, who assumed his role last spring and whose country has contributed the largest share of OPEC output curbs, addresses the meeting on Tuesday.[nP8N16A00F]

Russian Oil Minister Alexander Novak, who was key to bringing non-OPEC countries on board to cut in tandem with OPEC, will speak on Monday

Chief executives from five hard-hit international oil producers - BP , Chevron Corp , Exxon Mobil Corp , Royal Dutch Shell and Total - will be listening closely to the ministers' comments to see if those production curbs will be extended past their June expiration.

The meeting won't be without simmering tension between U.S. oil producers and OPEC. One of the biggest questions in the oil market is how quickly and how much shale producers will boost output. A sharp rise from the U.S. shale patch could undo the Saudi-led deal to reduce the global oil glut.

Shale activity is humming in the hottest U.S. oilfield, the Permian Basin, a 75,000 square mile expanse in West Texas. The U.S. land drilling rig count is up 55 percent in the past 12 months, and many of them are in the Permian. [nEMNH2K0S4]

"It's exciting now to see the rig count rising and business activity picking up again," said Peter Boylan, chief executive of Cypress Energy Partners LP , an oilfield service provider with operations in Texas and North Dakota.

That newfound investment vigor and projections for stronger shale production have kept a lid on the recovery. Oil prices may struggle to breach $60 per barrel, regardless of how much OPEC cuts, if the U.S. keeps increasing production, according to a Reuters poll.[nL5N1GC3R6]

U.S. crude futures closed on Friday at $53.33 per barrel.

BHP Billiton has boosted investment in its shale operations since last fall, forecasting the sector to become the single largest generator of cash flow for its petroleum business within five years.

"We expect a balanced oil market in 2017 for the first time in nearly three years," said Steve Pastor, president of BHP's petroleum business.

CERAWEEK-Titans of oil world meet in Houston after 2-yr price war - 路透新闻

{{20170305T060001.702+0000}}CERAWEEK-Titans of oil world meet in Houston after 2-yr price warBy Ernest Scheyder

HOUSTON, March 5 (Reuters) - The biggest names in the oil world come together this week for the largest industry gathering since the end of a two-year price war that pitted Middle East exporters against the firms that drove the shale energy revolution in the United States.

When OPEC in November joined with several non-OPEC producers to agree to a historic cut in output, the group called time on a fight for market share that drove oil prices to a 12-year low and many shale producers to the wall.

Oil prices are about 70 percent higher than they were the last time oil ministers and the chief executives of Big Oil met in Houston a year ago at CERAWeek, the largest annual industry meet in the Americas.

The ebullience as both sides enjoy higher revenues will be a welcome relief from the gloom of a year ago, near the depths of the price war.

"The oil market has been rebalancing and the powerful forces of supply and demand have been working," said Dan Yergin, vice chairman of conference organizer IHS Markit and a Pulitzer Prize-winning oil historian.

"The mood will be different this year."

The capital of the U.S. oil industry Houston is emerging from the price war sporting new downtown skyscrapers and the lingering glow from hosting last month's Super Bowl. [nL1N1FL2AJ]

OPEC's November deal, the prospects for its continuation and rosier investment prospects for the industry will dominate the discussions, with state-run producers and Big Oil both positioning themselves for an upturn in the notoriously cyclical business.

Twice as many OPEC ministers as a year ago - plus Russia and India's top energy officials - will be in the capital of the U.S. energy industry.

Saudi Arabia's energy minister Khalid al-Falih, who assumed his role last spring and whose country has contributed the largest share of OPEC output curbs, addresses the meeting on Tuesday.[nP8N16A00F]

U.S. drillers add oil rigs for 7th week in a row -Baker Hughes - 路透新闻

{{20170303T180355.506+0000}}U.S. drillers add oil rigs for 7th week in a row -Baker HughesMarch 3 (Reuters) - U.S. drillers added oil rigs for a
seventh week in a row, extending a recovery into a tenth month
as energy companies, including Exxon Mobil Corp , boost
spending plans to take advantage of a crude price recovery.

Drillers added seven oil rigs in the week to March 3,
bringing the total count up to 609, the most since October 2015,
energy services firm Baker Hughes Inc  said on Friday.

During the same week a year ago, there were 392 active oil
rigs.

Since crude prices first topped $50 a barrel in May after
recovering from 13-year lows in February 2016, drillers have
added a total of 293 oil rigs in 36 of the past 40 weeks, the
biggest recovery in rigs since a global oil glut crushed the
market over two years starting in mid 2014.

The Baker Hughes oil rig count plunged from a record 1,609
in October 2014 to a six-year low of 316 in May 2016 as U.S.
crude collapsed from over $107 a barrel in June 2014 to near $26
in February 2016.

U.S. crude futures  traded around $53 a barrel on
Friday, putting the contract on track to fall for a second week
in three as ample U.S. crude supplies undermine efforts by the
Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and
other producers to drain a global oil glut. [O/R]

U.S. crude inventories hit record highs last week, after
eight straight weeks of builds, and production topped 9 million
barrels per day for a second week in a row, the most since April
2016, according to federal energy data. [EIA/S]

Analysts said they expect U.S. energy firms to boost
spending on drilling and pump more oil and natural gas from
shale fields in coming years now that energy prices are
projected to keep climbing.

Futures for the balance of 2017  and calendar 2018
 were both fetching over $54 a barrel.

Exxon's new Chief Executive Darren Woods told shareholders
on Wednesday that the oil major is to invest $5.5 billion in
short-term drilling projects in North Dakota and Texas in 2017,
or around a quarter of capex, and intends increasing it in the
following three years.[nL2N1GE0UU] [nL2N1GE1WT]

Analysts at Simmons & Co, energy specialists at U.S.
investment bank Piper Jaffray, this week forecast the total oil
and gas rig count would average 815 in 2017, 933 in 2018 and
1,044 in 2019. Most wells produce both oil and gas.

That compares with an average of 718 so far in 2017, 509 in
2016 and 978 in 2015, according to Baker Hughes data.

Analysts at U.S. financial services firm Cowen & Co said in
a note this week that its capital expenditure tracking showed 52
exploration and production (E&P) companies planned to increase
spending by an average of 50 percent in 2017 over 2016.

That expected spending increase in 2017 followed an
estimated 48 percent decline in 2016 and a 34 percent decline in
2015, Cowen said according to the 64 E&P companies it tracks.

UPDATE 1-Japan's GPIF posts record $92 bln quarterly gain thanks to stock rally - 路透新闻

{{20170303T075539.647+0000}}UPDATE 1-Japan's GPIF posts record $92 bln quarterly gain thanks to stock rally* GPIF posts record quarterly gain

* Stock rally boosts returns

* GPIF's domestic bond underweights target for 1st time

(Adds quotes, details on investments)

By Junko Fujita

TOKYO, March 3 (Reuters) - Japan's Government Pension Investment Fund, the world's largest pension fund, posted a record quarterly gain of $92 billion thanks to a rally in the country's stock market.

GPIF on Friday reported a return of 7.98 percent in its fiscal third quarter, which ended in December.

Its paper gain totalled 10.5 trillion yen. The fund managed 144.8 trillion yen worth of assets as of December.

"We had a big gain in the quarter but there are many complex issues in the world economy so we will be carefully manage the assets going forward," said GPIF spokesman Shinichiro Mori at a media briefing on Friday.

Japan's benchmark Nikkei share index <.N225> rallied 16 percent in the quarter on expectations of stronger global economic growth and as the yen weakened in the face of a surging U.S. dollar following the election of President Donald Trump.

It edged up another 2 percent in January-March this year.

In 2014 GPIF made an historic policy shift, increasing its investments in riskier assets such as stocks for higher returns, while it reduced its reliance on low-yielding domestic bonds.

Of all the pension reserve, which also included 2.5 trillion yen pooled at Japan's health ministry, 23.76 percent was allocated to Japanese stocks.

GPIF's domestic bond holdings accounted for 33.26 percent of its assets, underweighting its allocation target set in 2014 for the first time as yields rose.

GPIF allocated 13.37 percent of its assets to foreign bonds and 23.16 percent to foreign stocks. The remaining 6.3 percent was mainly cash GPIF holds.

Its Japanese stock holdings returned 15.18 percent, while the domestic bond holdings had a negative return of 1.07 percent.

GPIF directly invests only in a portion of bonds, while it asks other financial institutions to manage most of the bonds and all the stocks.

GPIF also is trying to boost its investments in alternative assets, such as infrastructure and private equity. But such investments accounted for only 0.07 percent of its total assets in the quarter, versus a target of 5 percent.

At the end of 2015 financial year, GPIF had invested 81.4 billion yen in infrastructure, while it injected 1.9 billion yen in private equity assets, said Mori.

GPIF does not have any investments in U.S. infrastructure, he added.

($1 = 114.0900 yen)

Guyana says future oil output could be refined in Trinidad, Suriname - 路透新闻

{{20170302T211200.949+0000}}Guyana says future oil output could be refined in Trinidad, SurinameGEORGETOWN, March 2 (Reuters) - The South American nation of Guyana could send future oil production to Trinidad and Tobago or Suriname for refining, a government official said on Thursday.

Exxon Mobil Corp and partner companies say they have found between 800 million and 1.4 billion barrels of oil off the coast of Guyana, with production expected for 2020.

"We recently had some overtures made by the government of Trinidad and Tobago ... they are operating right now below optimum and they are importing oil from Nigeria," Natural Resources Minister Raphael Trotman told reporters.

"Suriname has also indicated a willingness to do refining for Guyana. Why? Because they too have a refinery which is performing under par."

Guyana, which currently does not produce oil, is considering whether it would make economic sense to build its own refinery, Trotman said.

The crude discovery triggered a diplomatic dispute with neighboring Venezuela, which lays claim to a portion of Guyana as part of a long-standing border dispute. Guyana says the countries' border was settled over a century ago.

Venezuela has in the past supplied crude to Petrotrin's 168,000-barrel-per-day Pointe-a-Pierre refinery in Trinidad, but is no longer doing so amid ongoing oilfield production problems.

UPDATE 4-Exxon touts growth potential with eye toward dividend - 路透新闻

{{20170301T233653.993+0000}}UPDATE 4-Exxon touts growth potential with eye toward dividend(Adds links to related content, no changes to headline or text)

By Ernest Scheyder

NEW YORK, March 1 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp , the world's largest publicly traded oil producer, sought to reassure anxious investors on Wednesday about its growth potential, highlighting both short- and long-term projects executives said should continue to help fund the 106-year-old dividend.

"Our job is to compete and succeed in any market," new Chief Executive Officer Darren Woods said at the company's annual analyst day in New York.

Woods sought to assuage Wall Street concerns that Exxon has lagged Chevron Corp and other peers in its ability to replace the oil and gas reserves it needs for future profitability.

It was a tough task, with analysts critical of the company's ability to sustain growth. Of 25 Wall Street analysts tracking Exxon, only five recommend buying its shares, less than a third of the 17 who advise buying Chevron's shares, according to Thomson Reuters data.

"Darren Woods did an effective job in laying out the story, but he was hamstrung by his predecessor's mistakes and the market's increasingly skeptical sentiment on the stock," Raymond James analyst Pavel Molchanov said.

Woods, who was meeting analysts for the first time since predecessor Rex Tillerson left in January to become U.S. secretary of state, sought to show Wall Street that the company's investment potential was positive.

Shares of Exxon rose 2 percent on Wednesday in line with the broader market, despite a drop in oil prices .

Exxon touted short-term projects in North Dakota and Texas, while pointing to larger endeavors in Russia, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Angola and Canada slated to come online later this year.

Combined, all growth projects should boost the company's production to between 4 million and 4.4 million barrels of oil equivalent per day by 2020, Exxon said.

Exxon pumped 4.1 million barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2016.

Exxon and other oil majors have been slow to recover from a two-year price war with OPEC members that has eroded profitability. Exxon does not hedge its oil production, so it is particularly sensitive to price swings.

Last year, for the second year in a row, Texas-based Exxon failed to replace 100 percent of its oil and gas reserves with new projects.[nL1N1G723D]

The company repeated its January spending outlook, in which it said it would spend $22 billion this year, up about 16 percent from 2016. [nL1N1FL0M7]

Woods said that spending should increase to about $25 billion by the end of the decade.

"We are confident in our ability to create significant shareholder value over the long-term," he said.

REFINING

Woods, who previously ran Exxon's refining unit, defended the company's integrated business model, which twins oil exploration and production with refining. Refining profits typically rise when oil prices fall, which has helped lift Exxon's results in the past year.

While some investors have pushed oil companies to spin off refining units to boost shareholder returns, Woods said Exxon's profitability would suffer should that occur.

BREAKINGVIEWS-Exxon stakes long-term growth on short-term fixes - 路透新闻

{{20170301T224915.168+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-Exxon stakes long-term growth on short-term fixes(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are her own.)

By Lauren Silva Laughlin

DALLAS, March 1 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Exxon Mobil's new chief executive, Darren Woods, is staking long-term growth on short-term fixes. At the oil major's annual analyst confab in New York on Wednesday, he outlined plans to ramp up the amount of capital expenditure dedicated to shale drilling in North Dakota and Texas. These should yield results more quickly than the longer-term projects Exxon tended to focus on and help it replace reserves it recently lost.

Like its rivals, Exxon engages in a constant tug of war for its cash. On the one side, shareholders are big fans of the dividend that the company has steadily increased over the past several years. On the other, though, is the need to invest to grow its production. While oil prices were high, it was relatively easy to keep the two in balance.

As prices dropped though, so did profit, meaning Exxon had to borrow more money to help fund both investments and dividend payments. Just last week, Exxon finally cut reserves by a record 3.3 billion barrels, which stoked fears a dividend cut could be in the offing.

Sinking more resources into U.S. shale – including assets it bought in recent months – should help as returns come relatively quickly. That's why the company is investing some $5.5 billion this year in upstream shale, and intends increasing it in the following three years.

That, in turn, should secure the dividend – assuming prices don't suddenly crash. It should also help ensure the company can keep its return on capital employed at the 8 percent or so that analysts expect this year. Royal Dutch Shell and BP are projected to have hit 6 percent.

Trouble is, this year, at least, shale will only account for around a quarter of capex, with most of the rest going to projects that will take longer to bear fruit. And overall its investments over the next few years are only expected to boost production to as much as 4.4 million barrels equivalent a day by 2020, compared with 4.1 million and falling last year. The extra flow will be useful, but Woods may need to up the ante.

CONTEXT NEWS

- Exxon Mobil's new Chief Executive Darren Woods told shareholders at the company's annual analyst day on March 1 that the oil major is to invest $5.5 billion in short-term drilling projects in North Dakota and Texas in 2017, or around a quarter of capex. These so-called short-cycle investments will make up an even bigger portion of capex between 2018 and 2020.

- Exxon is also making investments in Russia, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Angola and Canada. Together the projects should boost Exxon's production to as much as 4.4 million barrels of oil per day by 2020, Reuters reported.

FACTBOX-Dow crosses 21,000 threshold: facts & figures - 路透新闻

{{20170301T224655.901+0000}}FACTBOX-Dow crosses 21,000 threshold: facts & figures(Updates after market close)

By Chuck Mikolajczak

NEW YORK, March 1 (Reuters) - After breaking a streak of 12 straight record-setting sessions, the Dow resumed its upward climb and closed above the 21,000 mark for the first time on Wednesday. [nL3N1GE4VJ]

The venerable index posted its largest daily percentage gain of the year at 1.46 percent, after ending February with its fourth straight month of gains -an advance of nearly 15 percent and its best four-month run since 2012.

Below is a list of facts about the index on its climb to 21,000:

** The Dow first closed above 20,000 on Jan. 25, 2017, when it ended the trading day at 20,068.51. The 24 market sessions between 1,000 point milestone for the index match the shortest such span in its history, from March 29 to May 3, 1999, when it rose from 10,000 to 11,000, also taking 24 trading days.

** The longest stretch between such milestones has been the 3,630 days needed for the index to close above the 2,000 barrier, reached on Jan. 8, 1987.

** Apple has been the best performer on the index since the 20,000 mark, with a gain of 14.7 percent. It is also the top boosts to the price-weighted Dow, contributing 122.65 points.

** Two other stocks contributed more than 100 Dow points each since the 20,000 milestone: Goldman Sachs and Boeing

** Goldman was the biggest contributor in the Dow's march from 19,000 to 20,000, adding about 167 points.

** Intel was the worst performing stock during the most recent 1,000 point run, down almost 5 percent. The stock is the third-biggest drag on the index, subtracting 12.8 points.

** The top two drags on the index during the move to 21,000 are both oil companies - Chevron and Exxon Mobil - which subtracted nearly 23 and 16 points respectively from the Dow.

TABLE-VLCC from U.S. Gulf Coast carrying crude to Asia - 路透新闻

{{20170301T191619.130+0000}}TABLE-VLCC from U.S. Gulf Coast carrying crude to AsiaMarch 1 (Reuters) - A Very Large Crude Carrier (VLCC) carrying an estimated 2 million barrels of U.S. oil is
bound for Asia, according to sources and Reuters Trade Flows data.

The Shaybah loaded in the Galveston Offshore Lightering Zone in mid-February and is currently en route to
Singapore, according to the data.

It was not immediately clear which company was moving the oil. One source said the vessel is co-loaded with
Thunderhorse crude and Southern Green Canyon, both produced in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. So far, no Asian refiners
have taken Thunderhorse crude.

The move comes as the spread between U.S. crude and global benchmarks widened, making exports of domestic oil
economic.

Exxon tente de rassurer sur sa croissance et ses dividendes  - 路透新闻

{{20170301T183104.770+0000}}Exxon tente de rassurer sur sa croissance et ses dividendes NEW YORK, 1er mars (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil , première capitalisation pétrolière mondiale, a cherché à rassurer les investisseurs mercredi sur son potentiel de croissance, faisant valoir que ses projets à court et long terme devraient continuer à permettre au groupe de distribuer un dividende comme il le fait depuis 106 ans.

La compagnie est à la traîne par rapport à ses concurrents, y compris Chevron , dans l'esprit des analystes de Wall Street en terme de capacité à renouveler ses réserves de pétrole et de gaz, garant de sa future rentabilité.

L'an dernier, pour la deuxième année de suite, le groupe basé au Texas n'a pas pu renouveler à 100% ses réserves de pétrole et de gaz avec de nouveaux projets.

Pour rassurer ses investisseurs, Exxon a vanté les mérites de ses projets à court terme dans le Dakota du Nord et au Texas, mais aussi de ses projets en Russie, au Qatar, aux Emirats arabes unis, en Angola et au Canada.

L'ensemble de ses projets de croissance devraient porter la production du groupe à un niveau situé entre 4,0 et 4,4 millions de barils équivalent pétrole par jour d'ici 2020, a dit Exxon.

La compagnie a pompé 4,1 millions de barils équivalent pétrole par jour en 2016.

"Notre métier est d'être compétitif et de réussir sur tous les marchés, quelles que soient les conditions et les prix", a dit le président, Darren Woods, dans un communiqué publié mercredi avant une réunion avec les analystes à New York.

** ExxonMobil has issued yet another loading programme for Qua Iboe crude oil, Nigeria's largest export stream, after further loading delays, traders said on Friday

** Cargoes are now delayed by up to two weeks, pushing two into May, traders said

** There are now 9 cargoes, for a total of 276,000 barrels per day (bpd) set to load in March and 10 cargoes, for a total of 317,000 bpd, set to load in April

** The new export plans compared with a revised March programme of 11 cargoes, with 337,000 bpd, and 7 cargoes, with 222,000 bpd, for April

** Operator ExxonMobil has issued several revised loading plans this year due to rolling postponements [nL5N1FL5VW]

** Traders said the company is grappling with pumping issues and metering issues on the export pipeline. Exxon did not immediately respond to a request for comment

** The persistent delays have limited demand for the cargoes, as buyers are wary of buying crude if they are not sure when it will load

UPDATE 1-Japan's GPIF posts record $92 bln quarterly gain thanks to stock rally - 路透新闻

{{20170303T075539.647+0000}}UPDATE 1-Japan's GPIF posts record $92 bln quarterly gain thanks to stock rally* GPIF posts record quarterly gain

* Stock rally boosts returns

* GPIF's domestic bond underweights target for 1st time

(Adds quotes, details on investments)

By Junko Fujita

TOKYO, March 3 (Reuters) - Japan's Government Pension Investment Fund, the world's largest pension fund, posted a record quarterly gain of $92 billion thanks to a rally in the country's stock market.

GPIF on Friday reported a return of 7.98 percent in its fiscal third quarter, which ended in December.

Its paper gain totalled 10.5 trillion yen. The fund managed 144.8 trillion yen worth of assets as of December.

"We had a big gain in the quarter but there are many complex issues in the world economy so we will be carefully manage the assets going forward," said GPIF spokesman Shinichiro Mori at a media briefing on Friday.

Japan's benchmark Nikkei share index <.N225> rallied 16 percent in the quarter on expectations of stronger global economic growth and as the yen weakened in the face of a surging U.S. dollar following the election of President Donald Trump.

It edged up another 2 percent in January-March this year.

In 2014 GPIF made an historic policy shift, increasing its investments in riskier assets such as stocks for higher returns, while it reduced its reliance on low-yielding domestic bonds.

Of all the pension reserve, which also included 2.5 trillion yen pooled at Japan's health ministry, 23.76 percent was allocated to Japanese stocks.

GPIF's domestic bond holdings accounted for 33.26 percent of its assets, underweighting its allocation target set in 2014 for the first time as yields rose.

GPIF allocated 13.37 percent of its assets to foreign bonds and 23.16 percent to foreign stocks. The remaining 6.3 percent was mainly cash GPIF holds.

Its Japanese stock holdings returned 15.18 percent, while the domestic bond holdings had a negative return of 1.07 percent.

GPIF directly invests only in a portion of bonds, while it asks other financial institutions to manage most of the bonds and all the stocks.

GPIF also is trying to boost its investments in alternative assets, such as infrastructure and private equity. But such investments accounted for only 0.07 percent of its total assets in the quarter, versus a target of 5 percent.

At the end of 2015 financial year, GPIF had invested 81.4 billion yen in infrastructure, while it injected 1.9 billion yen in private equity assets, said Mori.

GPIF does not have any investments in U.S. infrastructure, he added.

($1 = 114.0900 yen)

Guyana says future oil output could be refined in Trinidad, Suriname - 路透新闻

{{20170302T211200.949+0000}}Guyana says future oil output could be refined in Trinidad, SurinameGEORGETOWN, March 2 (Reuters) - The South American nation of Guyana could send future oil production to Trinidad and Tobago or Suriname for refining, a government official said on Thursday.

Exxon Mobil Corp and partner companies say they have found between 800 million and 1.4 billion barrels of oil off the coast of Guyana, with production expected for 2020.

"We recently had some overtures made by the government of Trinidad and Tobago ... they are operating right now below optimum and they are importing oil from Nigeria," Natural Resources Minister Raphael Trotman told reporters.

"Suriname has also indicated a willingness to do refining for Guyana. Why? Because they too have a refinery which is performing under par."

Guyana, which currently does not produce oil, is considering whether it would make economic sense to build its own refinery, Trotman said.

The crude discovery triggered a diplomatic dispute with neighboring Venezuela, which lays claim to a portion of Guyana as part of a long-standing border dispute. Guyana says the countries' border was settled over a century ago.

Venezuela has in the past supplied crude to Petrotrin's 168,000-barrel-per-day Pointe-a-Pierre refinery in Trinidad, but is no longer doing so amid ongoing oilfield production problems.

Germany's 2016 oil output stable, gas down 8.1 percent -industry - 路透新闻

{{20170302T102457.487+0000}}Germany's 2016 oil output stable, gas down 8.1 percent -industryFRANKFURT, March 2 (Reuters) - Germany produced 2.4 million
tonnes of oil in 2016, unchanged on the previous year, while
natural gas output fell by 8.1 percent to 7.9 billion cubic
metres (bcm), industry association BVEG data showed on Thursday.

German producers include BEB Erdgas und Erdoel, Mobil
Erdgas-Erdoel , DEA, formerly part of RWE

BASF's Wintershall  produces modest gas volumes at
home but more abroad, and leads in domestic crude oil.

BVEG member firms had a turnover of 1.8 billion euros in
Germany, down from 2.5 billion a year earlier, reflecting
dwindling reserves.

German gas producers have been trying to keep up production
but have been involved in years of debate over the use of
fracking technology to access untapped shale gas reserves.

Last summer, the government passed a law imposing limits on
fracking. [L8N19E3EX]

BVEG members now have to contend with a slowdown in the
licencing of new projects.

Germany sourced 8 percent of its gas demand from domestic
sources last year, down from 10 percent in 2015, while importing
the rest. [GAS/DE]

UPDATE 4-Exxon touts growth potential with eye toward dividend - 路透新闻

{{20170301T233653.993+0000}}UPDATE 4-Exxon touts growth potential with eye toward dividend(Adds links to related content, no changes to headline or text)

By Ernest Scheyder

NEW YORK, March 1 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp , the world's largest publicly traded oil producer, sought to reassure anxious investors on Wednesday about its growth potential, highlighting both short- and long-term projects executives said should continue to help fund the 106-year-old dividend.

"Our job is to compete and succeed in any market," new Chief Executive Officer Darren Woods said at the company's annual analyst day in New York.

Woods sought to assuage Wall Street concerns that Exxon has lagged Chevron Corp and other peers in its ability to replace the oil and gas reserves it needs for future profitability.

It was a tough task, with analysts critical of the company's ability to sustain growth. Of 25 Wall Street analysts tracking Exxon, only five recommend buying its shares, less than a third of the 17 who advise buying Chevron's shares, according to Thomson Reuters data.

"Darren Woods did an effective job in laying out the story, but he was hamstrung by his predecessor's mistakes and the market's increasingly skeptical sentiment on the stock," Raymond James analyst Pavel Molchanov said.

Woods, who was meeting analysts for the first time since predecessor Rex Tillerson left in January to become U.S. secretary of state, sought to show Wall Street that the company's investment potential was positive.

Shares of Exxon rose 2 percent on Wednesday in line with the broader market, despite a drop in oil prices .

Exxon touted short-term projects in North Dakota and Texas, while pointing to larger endeavors in Russia, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Angola and Canada slated to come online later this year.

Combined, all growth projects should boost the company's production to between 4 million and 4.4 million barrels of oil equivalent per day by 2020, Exxon said.

Exxon pumped 4.1 million barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2016.

Exxon and other oil majors have been slow to recover from a two-year price war with OPEC members that has eroded profitability. Exxon does not hedge its oil production, so it is particularly sensitive to price swings.

Last year, for the second year in a row, Texas-based Exxon failed to replace 100 percent of its oil and gas reserves with new projects.[nL1N1G723D]

The company repeated its January spending outlook, in which it said it would spend $22 billion this year, up about 16 percent from 2016. [nL1N1FL0M7]

Woods said that spending should increase to about $25 billion by the end of the decade.

"We are confident in our ability to create significant shareholder value over the long-term," he said.

REFINING

Woods, who previously ran Exxon's refining unit, defended the company's integrated business model, which twins oil exploration and production with refining. Refining profits typically rise when oil prices fall, which has helped lift Exxon's results in the past year.

While some investors have pushed oil companies to spin off refining units to boost shareholder returns, Woods said Exxon's profitability would suffer should that occur.

BREAKINGVIEWS-Exxon stakes long-term growth on short-term fixes - 路透新闻

{{20170301T224915.168+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-Exxon stakes long-term growth on short-term fixes(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are her own.)

By Lauren Silva Laughlin

DALLAS, March 1 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Exxon Mobil's new chief executive, Darren Woods, is staking long-term growth on short-term fixes. At the oil major's annual analyst confab in New York on Wednesday, he outlined plans to ramp up the amount of capital expenditure dedicated to shale drilling in North Dakota and Texas. These should yield results more quickly than the longer-term projects Exxon tended to focus on and help it replace reserves it recently lost.

Like its rivals, Exxon engages in a constant tug of war for its cash. On the one side, shareholders are big fans of the dividend that the company has steadily increased over the past several years. On the other, though, is the need to invest to grow its production. While oil prices were high, it was relatively easy to keep the two in balance.

As prices dropped though, so did profit, meaning Exxon had to borrow more money to help fund both investments and dividend payments. Just last week, Exxon finally cut reserves by a record 3.3 billion barrels, which stoked fears a dividend cut could be in the offing.

Sinking more resources into U.S. shale – including assets it bought in recent months – should help as returns come relatively quickly. That's why the company is investing some $5.5 billion this year in upstream shale, and intends increasing it in the following three years.

That, in turn, should secure the dividend – assuming prices don't suddenly crash. It should also help ensure the company can keep its return on capital employed at the 8 percent or so that analysts expect this year. Royal Dutch Shell and BP are projected to have hit 6 percent.

Trouble is, this year, at least, shale will only account for around a quarter of capex, with most of the rest going to projects that will take longer to bear fruit. And overall its investments over the next few years are only expected to boost production to as much as 4.4 million barrels equivalent a day by 2020, compared with 4.1 million and falling last year. The extra flow will be useful, but Woods may need to up the ante.

CONTEXT NEWS

- Exxon Mobil's new Chief Executive Darren Woods told shareholders at the company's annual analyst day on March 1 that the oil major is to invest $5.5 billion in short-term drilling projects in North Dakota and Texas in 2017, or around a quarter of capex. These so-called short-cycle investments will make up an even bigger portion of capex between 2018 and 2020.

- Exxon is also making investments in Russia, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Angola and Canada. Together the projects should boost Exxon's production to as much as 4.4 million barrels of oil per day by 2020, Reuters reported.

FACTBOX-Dow crosses 21,000 threshold: facts & figures - 路透新闻

{{20170301T224655.901+0000}}FACTBOX-Dow crosses 21,000 threshold: facts & figures(Updates after market close)

By Chuck Mikolajczak

NEW YORK, March 1 (Reuters) - After breaking a streak of 12 straight record-setting sessions, the Dow resumed its upward climb and closed above the 21,000 mark for the first time on Wednesday. [nL3N1GE4VJ]

The venerable index posted its largest daily percentage gain of the year at 1.46 percent, after ending February with its fourth straight month of gains -an advance of nearly 15 percent and its best four-month run since 2012.

Below is a list of facts about the index on its climb to 21,000:

** The Dow first closed above 20,000 on Jan. 25, 2017, when it ended the trading day at 20,068.51. The 24 market sessions between 1,000 point milestone for the index match the shortest such span in its history, from March 29 to May 3, 1999, when it rose from 10,000 to 11,000, also taking 24 trading days.

** The longest stretch between such milestones has been the 3,630 days needed for the index to close above the 2,000 barrier, reached on Jan. 8, 1987.

** Apple has been the best performer on the index since the 20,000 mark, with a gain of 14.7 percent. It is also the top boosts to the price-weighted Dow, contributing 122.65 points.

** Two other stocks contributed more than 100 Dow points each since the 20,000 milestone: Goldman Sachs and Boeing

** Goldman was the biggest contributor in the Dow's march from 19,000 to 20,000, adding about 167 points.

** Intel was the worst performing stock during the most recent 1,000 point run, down almost 5 percent. The stock is the third-biggest drag on the index, subtracting 12.8 points.

** The top two drags on the index during the move to 21,000 are both oil companies - Chevron and Exxon Mobil - which subtracted nearly 23 and 16 points respectively from the Dow.

TABLE-VLCC from U.S. Gulf Coast carrying crude to Asia - 路透新闻

{{20170301T191619.130+0000}}TABLE-VLCC from U.S. Gulf Coast carrying crude to AsiaMarch 1 (Reuters) - A Very Large Crude Carrier (VLCC) carrying an estimated 2 million barrels of U.S. oil is
bound for Asia, according to sources and Reuters Trade Flows data.

The Shaybah loaded in the Galveston Offshore Lightering Zone in mid-February and is currently en route to
Singapore, according to the data.

It was not immediately clear which company was moving the oil. One source said the vessel is co-loaded with
Thunderhorse crude and Southern Green Canyon, both produced in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. So far, no Asian refiners
have taken Thunderhorse crude.

The move comes as the spread between U.S. crude and global benchmarks widened, making exports of domestic oil
economic.

For the first three quarters of 2016 exports, see: [nL1N1EZ155]

Exxon tente de rassurer sur sa croissance et ses dividendes  - 路透新闻

{{20170301T183104.770+0000}}Exxon tente de rassurer sur sa croissance et ses dividendes NEW YORK, 1er mars (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil , première capitalisation pétrolière mondiale, a cherché à rassurer les investisseurs mercredi sur son potentiel de croissance, faisant valoir que ses projets à court et long terme devraient continuer à permettre au groupe de distribuer un dividende comme il le fait depuis 106 ans.

La compagnie est à la traîne par rapport à ses concurrents, y compris Chevron , dans l'esprit des analystes de Wall Street en terme de capacité à renouveler ses réserves de pétrole et de gaz, garant de sa future rentabilité.

L'an dernier, pour la deuxième année de suite, le groupe basé au Texas n'a pas pu renouveler à 100% ses réserves de pétrole et de gaz avec de nouveaux projets.

Pour rassurer ses investisseurs, Exxon a vanté les mérites de ses projets à court terme dans le Dakota du Nord et au Texas, mais aussi de ses projets en Russie, au Qatar, aux Emirats arabes unis, en Angola et au Canada.

L'ensemble de ses projets de croissance devraient porter la production du groupe à un niveau situé entre 4,0 et 4,4 millions de barils équivalent pétrole par jour d'ici 2020, a dit Exxon.

La compagnie a pompé 4,1 millions de barils équivalent pétrole par jour en 2016.

"Notre métier est d'être compétitif et de réussir sur tous les marchés, quelles que soient les conditions et les prix", a dit le président, Darren Woods, dans un communiqué publié mercredi avant une réunion avec les analystes à New York.

RPT-INSIGHT-U.S. military marches forward on green energy, despite Trump - 路透新闻

{{20170301T120002.396+0000}}RPT-INSIGHT-U.S. military marches forward on green energy, despite Trump(Repeats for additional clients with no changes to text)

By Timothy Gardner

WASHINGTON, March 1 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump and his top advisors have often scoffed at government support of green energy. His chief strategist called it "madness."

But the largest U.S. government agency - the Department of Defense - plans to forge ahead under the new administration with a decade-long effort to convert its fuel-hungry operations to renewable power, senior military officials told Reuters.

The reasons have nothing to do with the white-hot debate over climate change. In combat zones, green energy saves lives by, for instance, reducing the need for easily attacked convoys to deliver diesel fuel to generators at U.S. bases. Mobile solar-power units allow soldiers to prowl silently through enemy territory.

At sea, gas-electric hybrid battleships save fuel and allow for fewer stops – making them less vulnerable to attacks like the bombing of the USS Cole in 2000, when al-Qaeda militants killed 17 U.S. soldiers during a refueling stop in Yemen.

The military's zeal for renewable power has already had broad impacts on energy contractors, generating hundreds of millions in contracts for solar companies and helping to reduce fuel consumption by the world's largest single petroleum buyer.

The armed forces nearly doubled renewable power generation between 2011 and 2015, to 10,534 billion British thermal units, or enough to power about 286,000 average U.S. homes, according to a Department of Defense report.

The number of military renewable energy projects nearly tripled to 1,390 between 2011 and 2015, department data showed, with a number of utilities and solar companies benefiting. Many of those projects are at U.S. bases, where renewable energy allows the military to maintain its own independent source of power in case of a natural disaster or an attack - or cyber attack - that disables the public grid.

The White House did not respond to Reuters requests for comment on the military's use of green energy. Although Trump has blasted solar subsidies, vowed to boost fossil fuel development and questioned the science behind climate change, military leaders remain confident that the president won't halt their march toward renewable power.

"We expect that it's going to continue during the Trump administration," said Lt. Col. Wayne Kinsel, head of the infrastructure unit of the Air Force Asset Management Division for Logistics, Engineering and Force Protection. "It's really not political."

Other senior officials in the Navy, Air Force and Army also told Reuters that they expected their renewable energy programs to continue.

Lt. Col. J.B. Brindle, a Defense Department spokesman, said the agency "spends very little appropriated funding" on renewable energy projects, but declined to give any figures or to answer additional questions about such efforts.

Trump's Secretary of Defense, Jim Mattis, has long supported efforts to reduce troop dependence on petroleum. He saw first-hand the vulnerability of diesel convoys to attacks by militants while serving as Commander of the Marine Corps Combat Development Command in Afghanistan and Iraq in the early 2000s. As far back as 2003, he urged Navy researchers to find innovative ways to unleash the military from the "tether of fuel."

LAUNCHED BY A REPUBLICAN

The military's push into alternative energy started under Republican President George W. Bush in 2007, when he signed a law requiring the Pentagon to get 25 percent of the electricity for its buildings from renewable energy by 2025.

The effort accelerated under President Barack Obama, who required the Army, Air Force and Navy to each deploy 1 gigawatt of renewable power and directed the Army to open a lab developing energy technologies for combat vehicles.

In an apparent nod to Obama's efforts to curb global warming, the Pentagon also reported to Congress in 2015 that the droughts and floods caused by climate change pose a security threat – contributing to foreign political and economic instability that could require substantial troop deployments.

Former Defense Secretary Ash Carter said in his parting memo in January that the Navy has already met its goal, producing 1 gigawatt of electricity - while the other forces are on track to meet their targets.

The programs have their opponents. The conservative Heritage Foundation, for example, has railed against the military's support of renewable power and biofuels.

"The administration right now needs to focus specifically on combat power," said Rachel Zissimos, a Heritage researcher. "Investing money on optional initiatives right now I think is problematic."

HIGH STAKES FOR MILITARY SUPPLIERS

Solar companies such as SunPower Corp and utilities including Sempra Energy and Southern have won utility-scale renewable energy contracts worth hundreds of millions of dollars in recent years, according to the companies and Department of Defense documents reviewed by Reuters.

Southern , for example, has 11 solar projects totaling 310 megawatts on bases in states including Georgia and Alabama. In December, Sempra completed the 150-megawatt Mesquite Solar 3 in Arizona to provide about a third of the power needed at 14 Navy and Marine bases in California for 25 years.

SunPower has already landed a major deal under the Trump administration - a $96 million contract finalized on Feb. 3 to provide power to Vandenberg Air Force base in California until 2043, according to a Pentagon database.

Sempra and Southern said they were committed to serving their customers but declined to comment on whether they were discussing new contracts with the military. SunPower did not comment.

Last year, the Navy began outfitting Arleigh Burke destroyers with gas-electric hybrid engines developed by L3 , which won a $119 million contract in 2013.

Tesla , which produces electric cars and batteries, is another company that analysts say could benefit from military contracts. A Tesla spokesman said the company is "supportive" of the military's interest in clean energy but declined comment on whether it was pursuing Defense Department contracts.

The U.S. military's use of oil, meanwhile, fell by more than 20 percent between 2007 and 2015. The bulk of the decline likely stems from declining combat operations rather than rising efficiency and use of renewable energy. But traditional military fuel suppliers - such as Exxon Mobil , BP , and Shell - nonetheless have a lot at stake if the military accelerates its move away from fossil fuels.

The military's average annual oil bill was about $14.28 billion between 2007 and 2015.

BP is constantly reviewing its marketing strategies to ensure growth, a spokesman said.

"As fuel slates change, we will adapt, and continue to provide our customers with the products they demand," he said in response to questions about the potential impact of the military's increased use of renewable fuels.

SOLAR-POWERED SOLDIERS

Hauling fuel to the battlefield has been a hazard for militaries since at least World War I and continues to take a grim toll. One in nearly 40 fuel convoys in Iraq in 2007 resulted in a death or serious injury, according to a study commissioned by the Defense Department. In Afghanistan the same year, one in 24 fuel convoys suffered casualties.

Marines in Afghanistan began carrying solar panels in 2009 to forward bases in battles with Taliban fighters. They used them to power batteries for communications, GPS and night-vision goggles. The panels not only reduced the need for convoys, they allowed marines to shut off generators, hushing operations and making them harder for enemies to detect.

Arotech subsidiary UEC has sold $25 million worth of the solar arrays and expects a bigger business in systems working with batteries and solar to slash dependence on generators, said business manager Nancy Straight.

Col. Brian Magnuson, the head of the Marines' expeditionary energy office, established in 2009, said his office aims to replace diesel-powered generators on the battlefield with solar power, and to reduce energy use with efficiency measures such as insulated tents and the deployment of advanced batteries.

"These technologies are a way to become more effective in combat," Magnuson said. "This is about war-fighting capability."

UPDATE 1-Exxon Beaumont refinery plans coker work in late March –sources - 路透新闻

{{20170228T215054.667+0000}}UPDATE 1-Exxon Beaumont refinery plans coker work in late March –sources(Adds company no comment, background)

HOUSTON, Feb 28 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp will begin a seven-week overhaul on the delayed coking unit at the 344,600-barrel-per-day Beaumont, Texas, refinery in late March, said sources familiar with the company's plans.

Two of the drums of the 45,000-bpd coker will be out of production for about three weeks for refurbishment and then returned to service, the sources said. Then another two drums will be taken out of service for three weeks.

An Exxon spokeswoman declined on Tuesday to discuss the company's plans for the Beaumont refinery.

Cokers boost the amount of refinable material obtained from a barrel of oil and convert residual crude to petroleum coke, which can be used as a coal substitute.

Delayed cokers do not produce coke continuously, but at regular intervals when a drum, which can be 300 feet (91.4 meters) in length, is lifted out of the unit. High-pressure hot water jets are used to remove the layer of coke that has been cooked along the wall of the drum.
