{{20170531T123102.890+0000}}Un consortium incluant Total prêt à explorer des sites en GrèceATHÈNES, 31 mai (Reuters) - La Grèce a reçu des marques d'intérêt d'un consortium regroupant Total , Exxon Mobil et Hellenic Petroleum en vue de l'exploration et de l'exploitation de deux sites au large de la Crète, a annoncé mercredi le ministère de l'Energie.

Le gouvernement grec, en quête de nouvelles sources de financement, a lancé un programme ambitieux d'exploration pétrolière et gazière après de récentes découvertes importantes de gaz en Méditerranée orientale.

Les deux blocs situés au sud de la Crète figurent parmi un ensemble de 17 blocs en mer Ionienne qui n'ont pas été attribués lors d'un précédent appel d'offres en 2014.

Greece receives oil and gas exploration interest from Exxon, Total, Hellenic Petroleum - 路透新闻

{{20170531T114619.363+0000}}Greece receives oil and gas exploration interest from Exxon, Total, Hellenic PetroleumATHENS, May 31 (Reuters) - Greece has received interest for hydrocarbons exploration and exploitation in two sites off the island of Crete from a consortium of Exxon Mobil , France's Total and Greece's Hellenic Petroleum , the energy ministry said on Wednesday.

Greece has launched an ambitious programme to discover more oil and gas, encouraged by recent big large gas finds in the eastern Mediterranean and spurred on by its protracted financial crisis.

The blocks south of Crete are among the remaining 17 of 20 blocks in the Ionian Sea and south of Crete which were unsuccessfully offered in 2014.

BP to sign Azerbaijan oilfield extension deal at end of June - 路透新闻

{{20170531T112701.406+0000}}BP to sign Azerbaijan oilfield extension deal at end of JuneBAKU, May 31 (Reuters) - British oil company BP expects to sign a contract at the end of June extending its production sharing deal for Azerbaijan's biggest oilfields until 2050, the company's regional head said on Wednesday.

The existing deal is due to expire in 2024 and BP-led consortium and Azeri state oil firm SOCAR signed a letter of intent in December to continue developing the giant Azeri-Chirag-Guneshly (ACG) offshore fields until 2050.

"End of June is a very reasonable time for it," Gary Jones, BP's regional head for Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey, told reporters when asked when the contract was due to be signed. "It's a big deal. We want to get it right."

The shareholders in the consortium include BP, SOCAR, Chevron , INPEX <1605.T>, Statoil , ExxonMobil , TPAO, ITOCHU <8001.T> and ONGC Videsh .

Azeri President Ilham Aliyev said on Wednesday he expected the contract to be signed soon.

"We are thinking about development of the ACG bloc and I think we will reach a final agreement with investors," Aliyev said at the annual Caspian Oil & Gas conference in Baku.

BP came under fire from Aliyev earlier this decade when the country's leader criticised the oil firm for lower than promised output levels. Oil output at ACG totalled more than 7.1 million tonnes in the first quarter of this year.

RPT-Exxon steps up efforts to sway shareholders on climate-report vote  - 路透新闻

{{20170531T100001.258+0000}}RPT-Exxon steps up efforts to sway shareholders on climate-report vote (Repeats with no changes to text)

By Gary McWilliams and Ross Kerber

HOUSTON/BOSTON, May 31 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp has stepped up efforts to persuade investors to vote against climate-related proposals at Wednesday's annual meeting with a campaign of calling, writing and lobbying shareholders in person.

The world's largest publicly traded oil company opposes a proposal requiring it to report on the risks to its business from new technologies and global climate change policies, insisting it already provides the information.

Last year, the same proposal was backed by 38.1 percent of shares voted.

The stakes are higher this year. The business-impact issue is central to lawsuits by two state attorneys general alleging Exxon soft-peddled the risks to consumers and shareholders. Wall Street support of similar measures also has convinced energy companies including Occidental Petroleum to address the Paris climate accord's goal of keeping global temperature increases under 2-degrees Celsius. [nL2N1IK1TB]

If the proposal garners less than last year's 38 percent support, it could endorse Exxon's view which is that its current reporting is appropriate, said Rob Schuwerk, senior counsel for environmental think tank Carbon Tracker Initiative.

But if support this year exceeds 50 percent, the oil company likely would do more to explain potential business impacts from having to meet the Paris agreement's temperature goal. A result in between the two, he said, would be the "the hazy middle" that would still show growing investor interest in climate issues.

Exxon took a conciliatory approach in a letter to investors on Tuesday. Vice President Jeff Woodbury wrote that on many of the shareholder proposals "the corporation agrees with the underlying objective - we just have a different view on the best means to achieve it."

Prior shareholder letters insisted the proposals were misguided or ignored the company's efforts to spell out its position that even in world intent on limited temperature rises, it would still need more oil.

Anne Sheehan, head of corporate governance at California State Teachers' Retirement System, which backs the additional climate reporting, said Exxon's letter suggests the voting is at least very close and may be going against the company.

"You're not going to do an eleventh-hour shareholder communication if everything was going swimmingly," she said in an interview.

In addition to the vote on the climate-impact report, Exxon holders will consider proposals to shift spending to dividends and buybacks from oil exploration and on a proposal to require a report on its efforts to restrict emissions of methane, a greenhouse gas.

Exxon opposes all these proposals and has actively lobbied shareholders. This campaign "is a lot more intense than normal," said one investor, who spoke on condition of anonymity. "I think they're pulling out all the stops."

BILLBOARDS AND RALLIES

Climate campaigners are also active. They have organized rallies and held media briefings. In Dallas, where the meeting takes place, they have put up billboards and signs seeking to sway votes.

Any change likely will be driven by institutional holders shifting their positions. Big investors including State Street Corp and BlackRock Inc , which together hold about 9 percent of Exxon shares, recently have made clear they are now giving more attention to climate issues. [nL1N1IS0KA]

Bob Litterman, chairman of the risk committee at asset-management firm Kepos Capital LP and who holds derivatives betting that oil companies will underperform the S&P 500 index, said no matter the outcome of the vote on Wednesday, pressures on Exxon to spell out the potential impact of a global warming on the value of its energy assets will only grow.

"Whether it's shareholders or attorneys general or the passage of time, they're going to have to become honest about the potential for their assets to be stranded," or become uneconomic to pursue, said Litterman.

Exxon steps up efforts to sway shareholders on climate-report vote  - 路透新闻

{{20170531T040101.319+0000}}Exxon steps up efforts to sway shareholders on climate-report vote By Gary McWilliams and Ross Kerber

HOUSTON/BOSTON, May 31 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp has stepped up efforts to persuade investors to vote against climate-related proposals at Wednesday's annual meeting with a campaign of calling, writing and lobbying shareholders in person.

The world's largest publicly traded oil company opposes a proposal requiring it to report on the risks to its business from new technologies and global climate change policies, insisting it already provides the information.

Last year, the same proposal was backed by 38.1 percent of shares voted.

The stakes are higher this year. The business-impact issue is central to lawsuits by two state attorneys general alleging Exxon soft-peddled the risks to consumers and shareholders. Wall Street support of similar measures also has convinced energy companies including Occidental Petroleum to address the Paris climate accord's goal of keeping global temperature increases under 2-degrees Celsius. [nL2N1IK1TB]

If the proposal garners less than last year's 38 percent support, it could endorse Exxon's view which is that its current reporting is appropriate, said Rob Schuwerk, senior counsel for environmental think tank Carbon Tracker Initiative.

But if support this year exceeds 50 percent, the oil company likely would do more to explain potential business impacts from having to meet the Paris agreement's temperature goal. A result in between the two, he said, would be the "the hazy middle" that would still show growing investor interest in climate issues.

Exxon took a conciliatory approach in a letter to investors on Tuesday. Vice President Jeff Woodbury wrote that on many of the shareholder proposals "the corporation agrees with the underlying objective - we just have a different view on the best means to achieve it."

Prior shareholder letters insisted the proposals were misguided or ignored the company's efforts to spell out its position that even in world intent on limited temperature rises, it would still need more oil.

Anne Sheehan, head of corporate governance at California State Teachers' Retirement System, which backs the additional climate reporting, said Exxon's letter suggests the voting is at least very close and may be going against the company.

"You're not going to do an eleventh-hour shareholder communication if everything was going swimmingly," she said in an interview.

In addition to the vote on the climate-impact report, Exxon holders will consider proposals to shift spending to dividends and buybacks from oil exploration and on a proposal to require a report on its efforts to restrict emissions of methane, a greenhouse gas.

Exxon opposes all these proposals and has actively lobbied shareholders. This campaign "is a lot more intense than normal," said one investor, who spoke on condition of anonymity. "I think they're pulling out all the stops."

BILLBOARDS AND RALLIES

Climate campaigners are also active. They have organized rallies and held media briefings. In Dallas, where the meeting takes place, they have put up billboards and signs seeking to sway votes.

Any change likely will be driven by institutional holders shifting their positions. Big investors including State Street Corp and BlackRock Inc , which together hold about 9 percent of Exxon shares, recently have made clear they are now giving more attention to climate issues. [nL1N1IS0KA]

Bob Litterman, chairman of the risk committee at asset-management firm Kepos Capital LP and who holds derivatives betting that oil companies will underperform the S&P 500 index, said no matter the outcome of the vote on Wednesday, pressures on Exxon to spell out the potential impact of a global warming on the value of its energy assets will only grow.

"Whether it's shareholders or attorneys general or the passage of time, they're going to have to become honest about the potential for their assets to be stranded," or become uneconomic to pursue, said Litterman.

POINT MARCHÉS-Wall Street termine en léger repli, énergie et finances en berne - 路透新闻

{{20170530T214432.083+0000}}POINT MARCHÉS-Wall Street termine en léger repli, énergie et finances en berne(Actualisé avec devises, Treasuries, volume de transactions)

* Plus forte hausse de la consommation en avril depuis quatre mois

* Mais la confiance du consommateur s'est dégradée

* L'action Amazon a brièvement franchi la barre des 1.000 dollars

* Le Dow Jones a perdu 0,24%, le S&P-500 0,12%, le Nasdaq 0,11%

NEW YORK, 30 mai (Reuters) - Wall Street a terminé en léger repli mardi, après un long week-end de trois jours, alourdie par les secteurs financier et de l'énergie et après une série d'indicateurs mitigés à un peu plus de deux semaines de la réunion monétaire de la Réserve fédérale.

L'indice Dow Jones <.DJI> a perdu 50,81 points, soit 0,24%, à 21.029,47. Le S&P-500 <.SPX>, plus large, a cédé 2,91 points, soit 0,12%, à 2.412,91. Le Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> a reculé de son côté de 7,01 points (-0,11%) à 6.203,19 points.

Les cours du pétrole ont perdu du terrain dans le doute sur l'efficacité de l'accord de réduction de la production Opep et non-Opep, qui vient d'être prolongé pour soutenir les prix.

L'indice de l'énergie <.SPNY> a terminé en baisse de 1,31%, plus net repli des indices sectoriels du S&P. Chevron et Exxon ont perdu respectivement 0,63% et 0,55%.

Les valeurs financières ont également pesé sur la tendance, avec un indice sectoriel <.SPSY> en recul de 0,77%. JPMorgan a cédé 1,71%, plus gros contributeur au repli du S&P, et Goldman Sachs a pesé sur le Dow, avec une perte de 1,96%.

Sur le plan macroéconomique, la hausse de l'indice des prix de base aux Etats-Unis a ralenti, à 1,5% sur un an en avril, après +1,6% en mars, ce qui tend à renforcer le scénario selon lequel la Réserve fédérale pourrait ne pas relever à nouveau ses taux après sa réunion des 13 et 14 juin. [nL8N1IW4D2]

"Nous sommes dans une phase où les indicateurs du premier trimestre ont été légèrement plus faibles et les investisseurs se demandent si c'était un accident où bien s'il faut y voir quelque chose de plus sérieux", dit Brent Schutte, responsable de la stratégie chez Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management.

MOUVEMENT VERS LES VALEURS REFUGE

Les dépenses de consommation en mai ont connu leur plus forte hausse en quatre mois mais d'un autre côté, la confiance du consommateur aux Etats-Unis s'est dégradée. [nL8N1IW4SW]

Le président de la Fed de Dallas, Robert Kaplan, a dit à CNBC que malgré son inquiétude face aux récents indicateurs, il s'attendait quand même à deux nouvelles hausses de taux en 2017.

De son côté, la gouverneure de la Fed, Lael Brainard, a dit qu'un prochain relèvement de taux était probable mais que la banque pourrait vouloir le repousser si l'inflation restait faible, tout en soulignant qu'elle était pour réduire "sans trop tarder" le portefeuille d'obligations de la banque. [nL8N1IW6L3]

Amazon.com (+0,09%) a brièvement franchi la barre des 1.000 dollars en cours de séance, devançant de peu Alphabet (+0,29%), la maison-mère de Google. [nL8N1IW54E]

Micron (+3,19%), très prisé à Wall Street après que le groupe a réalisé des résultats meilleurs que prévu pendant sept trimestres de suite, affiche sa huitième séance de hausse d'affilée. Le titre a gagné 40% depuis le début de l'année, alors que le secteur des semiconducteurs <.SOX> a pris 20%.

L'indice des services télécoms <.SPLRCL> affiche la plus forte hausse sectorielles du S&P. AT&T a pris 1,13% et Verizon 1,94% à la faveur d'une note de broker positive.

Les inquiétudes concernant la croissance aux Etats-Unis et en Europe ont joué en faveur des valeurs refuge telles que le yen et les obligations d'Etat américaines et allemandes. Le yen s'est renforcé face au dollar et à l'euro et l'or a grimpé à un pic d'un mois à 1.270 dollars l'once.

Environ 5,68 milliards d'actions ont changé de mains sur les marchés américains, en retrait par rapport aux 6,69 milliards échangés quotidiennement au cours des 20 dernières séances.

* The company did not say when it planned to stop production at the field, but was interested in plugging work between 2019-2021

* Encana started producing gas at the facility in 2013

* Separately, Exxon Mobil expects to start plugging wells in early 2018 at the Sable Island project, Nova Scotia's other offshore gas field, which it operates. It has a peak capacity between 500-600 mmcfd and entered service in 1999.

* Production at both facilities has been declining for years. Nova Scotia's production averaged 165 mmcfd in February, down from a monthly peak of 565 mmcfd in December 2001, according to Canadian energy regulators

Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co, which offers a broad line of hardware, software and services aimed at corporate buyers, is expected to report a fall in the second-quarter profit. Chief Executive Meg Whitman has narrowed the company's strategy and is betting on the data center hardware business. However, as demand flags for hardware products, investors will be looking for signs of re-acceleration in the business.

The Federal Reserve issues its so-called Beige Book, a compendium of anecdotes on the health of the economy drawn from the central bank's sources across the nation. It will likely provide further evidence that the economy continues to strengthen as the central bank prepares to raise interest rates again, possibly as soon as at its next meeting in a couple of weeks time.

Cybersecurity firm Palo Alto Networks Inc is expected to report a fall in third-quarter profit. The company has faced rising competition in a hotly contested industry and is struggling with issues with its sales force. Investors will look to the company's forecast for signs of re-acceleration. Commentary about the recent global WannaCry ransomware attack will also be of interest.

Exxon Mobil Corp is scheduled to hold its annual shareholders meeting.

UPDATE 1-Tengizchevroil restarts operations after toxic substance release - 路透新闻

{{20170530T175832.422+0000}}UPDATE 1-Tengizchevroil restarts operations after toxic substance release(Adds details, context)

ALMATY, May 30 (Reuters) - Kazakhstan's biggest oil producer, Tengizchevroil, has restarted operations at its first-generation oil and gas separation plant which had been briefly suspended on Tuesday after a toxic substance was released, the company said.

Chevron , ExxonMobil , Lukoil and KazMunayGas are partners in the venture, which said the event was caused by an unplanned power loss and there were no injuries, spills or equipment damage.

"The power was soon restored and the emissions event stopped," it said in a statement. "KTL (oil and gas separation plant) start-up is proceeding safely."

The Central Asian country's energy ministry said earlier on Tuesday it would investigate the incident, describing it as "emission of toxic substances into the atmosphere".

The company, which produced 7.3 million tonnes (58 million barrels) of oil in the first quarter, said it had provided the authorised government bodies with information on the event. It did not say what substance had been released.

LNG tender from Australia's Gorgon project signals early restart-trade - 路透新闻

{{20170530T160635.657+0000}}LNG tender from Australia's Gorgon project signals early restart-tradeLONDON, May 30 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil seeks to sell a liquefied natural gas (LNG) cargo from Australia's giant Gorgon export facility in June, raising the possibility of an early restart to the partly-idled plant, trade sources said.

Exxon Mobil was offering to deliver the cargo in the second-half of June and bids were due by Wednesday, sources said.

The tender was being taken as a sign that Train 1, which was idled in mid-May, would return to production earlier than expected, traders said. [nL8N1IH3JO]

Gorgon operator Chevron previously said Train 1 would remain offline until about June 15.

Groningen minimum required output level lowered in study - 路透新闻

{{20170530T110135.181+0000}}Groningen minimum required output level lowered in studyAMSTERDAM, May 30 (Reuters) - The Dutch government said on Tuesday that a study of the minimum amount of gas that can be produced annually at the Groningen gas field through 2020 while still guaranteeing supply is 21 billion cubic metres (bcm), assuming average temperatures.

That's slightly below the 21.6 bcm the government has proposed producing for the coming five years beginning October 1.

The study was carried out by national gas grid transmission operator Gasunie following a request by parliament.

The Netherlands has been cutting output at the Groningen field, Europe's largest, to reduce the risk of earthquakes caused by production. [nL8N1IQ53R]

In a letter to parliament, Economic Affairs Minister Henk Kamp said Gasunie and NAM, the Shell/ExxonMobil joint venture that operates the Groningen field, is investigating whether reduction can be further cut at the Loppersum cluster, near to where several relatively strong quakes have occurred.

Exxon CEO Woods expected to attend St. Petersburg forum -sources - 路透新闻

{{20170529T122112.083+0000}}Exxon CEO Woods expected to attend St. Petersburg forum -sourcesBy Denis Pinchuk and Olesya Astakhova

MOSCOW, May 29 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Chief Executive Officer Darren Woods is expected to attend the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum this week, two industry sources told Reuters.

Woods is due to attend the June 1-3 forum where Russian President Vladimir Putin will deliver the keynote speech, the sources said. A meeting between Woods and Putin is possible, one of the sources said.

Exxon did not respond to a request seeking a comment.

Woods visited Moscow in March to meet Putin. Russian energy minister Alexander Novak and the head of top Russian oil producer Rosneft , Igor Sechin, also attended. [nR4N1GE00X]

This year's forum is the first since Donald Trump became U.S. president. During his election campaign, Trump said he wanted to restore frayed relations with the Kremlin.

Wood's predecessor, Rex Tillerson, now U.S. Secretary of State, appeared at last year's forum having stayed away for two years over Russia's intervention in Ukraine.

In 2014, sanctions drove Exxon away from a joint project with Rosneft in the offshore Arctic Kara sea oil field, where both companies started - and then postponed - exploratory drilling.

Rosneft and Exxon are also partners in the Pacific oil and gas project, Sakhalin-1, an Exxon-led venture that has been at odds with Russia's government over taxes. Sakhalin-1 is not subject to sanctions.

Other energy chief executives and officials due to attend the forum include Patrick Pouyanne of Total , Rainer Seele of OMV , Isabelle Kocher from Engie , Mario Mehren of Wintershall, BP CEO Robert Dudley, Saudi Arabia's oil minister Khalid al-Falih and OPEC Secretary General Mohammad Sanusi Barkindo.

UPDATE 1-U.S. fossil fuel groups pull out of climate change court case - 路透新闻

{{20170526T140012.544+0000}}UPDATE 1-U.S. fossil fuel groups pull out of climate change court case(Adds details throughout, adds in first paragraph that number of groups pulling out of the case is three)

By Emily Flitter

NEW YORK, May 26 (Reuters) - Three fossil fuel industry groups dropped their attempt to intervene in a court case over climate change this week after failing to reach an agreement on a unified legal position on climate science, court filings show.

The American Petroleum Institute (API) and the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM), prominent trade groups in the oil and gas industry, along with the American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers (AFPM), intervened in a federal case in which a group of teenagers sued the U.S. government for violating their constitutional rights by causing climate change.

The three groups were arguing that a judgment requiring the government to tighten environmental regulations would harm their business interests. But discord arose among them after a judge ordered them to submit a joint filing stating their views on climate science.

A lawyer representing the three groups said in a court hearing on May 18 that they were unable to agree on the causes and effects of human activity and greenhouse gas emissions on the climate, transcripts of the proceedings show.

"It seems pretty clear that the trade group intervenors have recognized that there may be costs as well as benefits to intervention and that they might be better off leaving the defense of the case to the government," said Seth Jaffe, an environmental lawyer who is a partner at Foley Hoag in Boston. He is not involved in the case.

NAM was the first to file its request to withdraw, submitting it to the court on Monday. API asked to withdraw on Thursday. AFPM filed its request early on Friday.

"What is noticeably absent from these withdrawal motions is the reason why the fossil fuel industry wants to leave the case," said Philip Gregory, a lawyer for the teen plaintiffs.

One issue for the industry groups is that laying out in court the scientific findings they accept on climate change could bind them to specific positions in other legal proceedings.

Exxon Mobil , for instance, a member of both API and NAM, is battling with attorneys general in Massachusetts and New York who are investigating the company for fraud based on apparent discrepancies between its public stance on global warming and internal documents on climate science. [nL1N1CN11P]

NAM spokeswoman Jennifer Drogus said the group had reevaluated its need to fight on behalf of the industry following the 2016 U.S. elections.

"We no longer feel that our participation in this case is needed to safeguard industry and our workers," she said in an email on Friday.

API spokeswoman Sabrina Fang did not say why the industry group had asked to withdraw from the case.

"We have full confidence that the courts will recognize that Congress and the Executive branch have the constitutional authority to write and execute the laws of the U.S.," she said in an email to Reuters on Thursday.

Spokespeople for AFPM did not immediately respond to request for comment.

The API formed a "Climate Change Task Force" last year to form a new message on climate change. Fang, when asked by Reuters on May 19 if the force had made any changes to API's public stance on climate change, said: "Nothing has changed."

A spokeswoman for NAM did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The case is Juliana v. U.S., U.S. District Court, District of Oregon (Eugene), No. 15-cv-01517.

RPT-EXCLUSIVE-Fidelity may back climate resolutions, a milestone for activists - 路透新闻

{{20170526T132149.801+0000}}RPT-EXCLUSIVE-Fidelity may back climate resolutions, a milestone for activists(Repeated for wider distribution with no change to text or headline)

By Ross Kerber

BOSTON, May 26 (Reuters) - Fidelity Investments may support shareholder proxy proposals calling on companies to report on sustainability matters this year, a major shift by the Boston asset manager as climate activists gain more traction at large U.S. corporations.

While Fidelity will generally vote as company managers recommend on environmental or social issues, "Fidelity may support shareholder proposals calling for reports on sustainability, renewable energy and environmental impact issues," states a new section of its proxy voting guidelines.

The guidelines were put in place in January for this spring's annual meeting season and have not previously been reported.

Fidelity spokeswoman Nicole Goodnow said Fidelity's new policy comes as client interest grows in how companies approach environmental, social and governance issues.

Other big fund companies including BlackRock Inc and State Street Corp have also lent support lately to calls for U.S. companies to account for how climate change could affect their business.

Shareholders passed such resolutions at Occidental Petroleum Corp and at utility holding company PPL Corp, this month, and a high-profile test is due at Exxon's annual meeting on May 31.[nL2N1IK1TB]

Fidelity's new language marks a milestone since the family-controlled Boston fund manager, the fourth-largest U.S. fund firm with about $2.1 trillion under management, had given little indication its climate stance was also changing.

During the last two proxy seasons Fidelity funds opposed or abstained on every one of 30 shareholder proposals related to climate questions at U.S. companies, according to researcher Proxy Insight. BlackRock had a similar record but made clear in March that climate risk would be a top priority in its outreach to companies this year.[nL2N1GN1ML]

The new stance by the Boston firm shows "Fidelity doesn't want to be sidelined from some of the most consequential decisions being made on climate risk," said Shanna Cleveland, a director at Ceres, an advocacy group in Boston that helped coordinate the resolutions.

Filings that will show the fund managers' votes are not due for months. Fidelity's change may not have a major impact at Exxon because its funds following the new policy own about 17 million shares or about 0.4 percent of the company, ranking it 19th among investors.

Goodnow declined to say how Fidelity will vote at Exxon.

Fidelity also recently created an investment office to follow environmental, social and governance issues and signed on to the United Nations-backed Principles for Responsible Investment. Signatories pledge to consider environmental, social and governance factors and to seek disclosures.

U.S. fossil fuel groups pull out of climate change court case - 路透新闻

{{20170526T044814.021+0000}}U.S. fossil fuel groups pull out of climate change court caseBy Emily Flitter

NEW YORK, May 26 (Reuters) - Two fossil fuel industry groups dropped their attempts to intervene in a court case over climate change this week after failing to reach an agreement on a unified legal position on climate science, court filings show.

The American Petroleum Institute (API) and the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM), prominent trade groups in the oil and gas industry, along with the American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers (AFPM), intervened in a federal case in which a group of teenagers sued the U.S. government for violating their constitutional rights by causing climate change.

The three groups were arguing that a judgment requiring the government to tighten environmental regulations would harm their business interests. But discord arose among them after a judge ordered them to submit a joint filing stating their views on climate science.

A lawyer representing the three groups said in a court hearing on May 18 that they were unable to agree on the causes and effects of human activity and greenhouse gas emissions on the climate, transcripts of the proceedings show.

"It seems pretty clear that the trade group intervenors have recognized that there may be costs as well as benefits to intervention and that they might be better off leaving the defense of the case to the government," said Seth Jaffe, an environmental lawyer who is a partner at Foley Hoag in Boston. He is not involved in the case.

NAM was the first to file its request to withdraw, submitting it to the court on Monday. API asked to withdraw on Thursday. AFPM has not yet responded to the judge's request.

"What is noticeably absent from these withdrawal motions is the reason why the fossil fuel industry wants to leave the case," said Philip Gregory, a lawyer for the teen plaintiffs.

One issue for the industry groups is that laying out in court the scientific findings they accept on climate change could bind them to specific positions in other legal proceedings.

Exxon Mobil , for instance, a member of both API and NAM, is battling with attorneys general in Massachusetts and New York who are investigating the company for fraud based on apparent discrepancies between its public stance on global warming and internal documents on climate science. [nL1N1CN11P]

API spokeswoman Sabrina Fang did not say why the industry group had asked to withdraw from the case.

"This case is about separation of powers among the three branches of government ... and we have full confidence that the courts will recognize that Congress and the Executive branch have the constitutional authority to write and execute the laws of the U.S.," she said on Thursday.

The API formed a "Climate Change Task Force" last year to form a new message on climate change. Fang, when asked by Reuters on May 19 if the force had made any changes to API's public stance on climate change, said: "Nothing has changed."

A spokeswoman for NAM did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The case is Juliana v. U.S., U.S. District Court, District of Oregon (Eugene), No. 15-cv-01517.

Nigeria to mediate in dispute between Exxon and labour unions - 路透新闻

{{20170524T185440.783+0000}}Nigeria to mediate in dispute between Exxon and labour unionsABUJA, May 24 (Reuters) - Nigeria's government wants to resolve a labour dispute between Exxon Mobil Corp and unions in the oil-rich Niger Delta region, a minister said on Wednesday.

Unions have protested against the sacking of workers at Exxon and other foreign oil firms, staging several strikes since the start of the year.

"We have reached out to the management to internally resolve the matter through reconciliation," labour minister Chris Ngige told reporters after a cabinet meetting.

"If that fails government will fully take over because even my counterpart the minister of petroleum had intervened but it failed," he added.

On Saturday a Nigerian labour union that had called for the shutdown of all Exxon Mobil in the Niger Delta said it had suspended a strike. [nL8N1IM0UK]

"I have referred the matter to the industrial arbitration panel for reconciliation. If this fails we will take another action," Ngige said, without elaborating.

He said he had convened a meeting at which only Exxon's representatives and not those of the PENGASSAN labour union had attended.

The latest industrial action was in protest at the sacking of 150 workers in December, of which 82 were PENGASSAN members.

Strikes by Exxon workers in Nigeria at the end of last year disrupted output, delaying loadings by weeks.

UPDATE 1-Shell, Exxon may appeal over planned Groningen gas output cut - 路透新闻

{{20170524T143647.266+0000}}UPDATE 1-Shell, Exxon may appeal over planned Groningen gas output cut(Adds details, background) (Writes through with context)

AMSTERDAM, May 24 (Reuters) - A joint venture between Royal Dutch Shell and Exxon Mobil said on Wednesday it was considering appealing against a Dutch government plan to cut production at the Groningen gas field by 10 percent.

The Dutch state earlier on Wednesday confirmed it intended to go ahead with a tightening of output at the massive field from Oct. 1. It said interested parties had until July 7 to announce an appeal.

The 50-50 Shell-Exxon joint venture known as NAM, said in a reaction that the measure was "disproportionate" and ignored previously agreed safety norms, which do not call for such a large reduction.

The NAM said it appeared as if the government wanted it to "provide absolute safety guarantees" which is impossible.

The proposed cut, first announced in April, is the latest in a series over the past two years following earthquakes causing major damage to properties in the northernmost region of the Netherlands.

With the new cut, production will be capped at 21.6 billion cubic metres (bcm) per year, down from 53.9 bcm in 2013. NAM has accepted civil responsibility for damage caused by the quakes and is paying damages of more than 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion). ($1 = 0.8937 euros)

Most Norwegian oil workers agree wage deal, mediation for rest - 路透新闻

{{20170524T095829.217+0000}}Most Norwegian oil workers agree wage deal, mediation for restOSLO, May 24 (Reuters) - Energy firms operating offshore Norway on Wednesday agreed wage deals for 2017 with the two largest trade unions representing oil and gas workers, while talks with a smaller union will continue at a later stage under mandatory mediation rules.

Industri Energi and Safe, representing some 87 percent of Norwegian oil workers, said the outcome of the talks was disappointing, but added they had nevertheless accepted it as they did not have the right to go on strike this year due to a clause in last year's agreement.

Lederne, a third union representing some 13 percent of Norwegian oil and gas workers or about 1,000 people, does have the right to go on strike, and said it had rejected the oil firms' offer.

Under Norwegian law, the talks involving Lederne will now proceed to a state mediator, which must be conducted before any strike is allowed.

Norway is western Europe's top oil and gas producer with daily output in April of around 2.1 million barrels of oil, condensate and natural gas liquids, as well as natural gas corresponding to about 1.7 million barrels of oil equivalent.

Top operators offshore Norway include, among others, Statoil , Aker BP , Total , Exxon Mobil , Shell and Centrica .

CORRECTED-State appeals court rules Exxon must give records to NY prosecutor - 路透新闻

{{20170523T214928.665+0000}}CORRECTED-State appeals court rules Exxon must give records to NY prosecutor(Corrects paragraph 5 to say Healey "is conducting a separate probe" instead of "is participating in the probe" ... Corrects paragraph 7 to say "his filing" instead of "their filing"...)

By Emily Flitter

NEW YORK, May 23 (Reuters) - A New York state appeals court on Tuesday ruled that Exxon Mobil Corp should be compelled to turn over records in an investigation into how much the company knew about global warming as it continued to publicly downplay the effects it was expected to have on the fossil fuel industry.

Exxon has been battling subpoenas from New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who is probing the company for fraud in its public statements about climate change. The appeals court upheld a lower court's decision, rejecting Exxon's argument that the court did not properly consider which state's laws on turning over evidence in an investigation should apply in the case. The investigation is taking place in New York, but Exxon's headquarters are in Texas.

"We respect, but disagree with the court's decision and are assessing our options and potential next steps," said Scott Silvestri, an Exxon spokesman.

"The unanimous appeals court rightly affirmed the lower court's decision and rejected Exxon's frivolous claims, which were merely one of the many tactics the company has employed in its campaign of delay and distraction," said Schneiderman's spokeswoman Amy Spitalnick.

Exxon is also fighting the investigation in Manhattan federal court, arguing Schneiderman and Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey, who is conducting a separate probe, are motivated by politics. On Friday, Schneiderman asked a judge to dismiss Exxon's case.

The investigation has already led to one public revelation: that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who until December was chief executive of Exxon, used a separate email address and an alias, "Wayne Tracker," to discuss climate change-related issues while at the company. [nL2N1GQ1T7]

In his filing in federal court on Friday, Schneiderman revealed his office had interviewed witnesses who could help them learn more about the kind of records Exxon might have showing internal discussions about climate change. He described the move as an attempt to keep Exxon from destroying relevant records before they were required to be turned over in the investigation.

The cases are People of the State of New York v PricewaterhouseCoopers and Exxon Mobil Corporation, New York State Supreme Court, New York County, No. 451962/2016, and 1:17-cv-2301 in U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York.

UPDATE 2-Shell shareholders reject emissions target proposal - 路透新闻

{{20170523T142234.421+0000}}UPDATE 2-Shell shareholders reject emissions target proposal* 94 pct of shareholders who voted rejected the resolution

* Follow This says will target BP once funding available

* Shareholders overwhelmingly approve CEO pay package

(Updates with final vote results)

By Karolin Schaps

THE HAGUE, May 23 (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell shareholders on Tuesday widely rejected a proposal by an environmental group calling for the oil company to set and publish annual targets to reduce carbon emissions.

The vote is a setback for climate activists who are increasing pressure on global oil companies, including U.S. firms Exxon Mobil and Chevron , to become more ambitious in helping combat climate change. [nL2N1IK1TB]

Around 94 percent of Shell shareholders who cast a vote decided against resolution 21, according to final results reported following the company's annual general meeting (AGM) in The Hague. Roughly 5 percent of voters abstained.

"The resolution is an unreasonable ask," said Shell Chief Executive Ben van Beurden, promising to engage further with investors on how the oil company can become more transparent about its plans to tackle climate change.

Shell said binding emissions reduction targets would mean "tying its hands" and weakening the company because it would be forced to reduce production and sales.

Growing investor sensitivity to climate change risks have already led Shell to invest in renewable energy projects such as offshore wind farms.

Shareholders overwhelmingly approved the company's new remuneration policy which for the first time ties 10 percent of executives bonuses to cutting greenhouse gas emissions.[nL8N1II59A]

Van Beurden's speech at Tuesday's AGM began with a 30 minute presentation of Shell's initiatives to help lower carbon emissions.

Mark van Baal, founder of the Follow This activist group which put forward the resolution, said the group would target other oil companies such as BP as soon as funding was available.

There was also little opposition to a 60 percent increase in van Beurden's pay package, with 93 percent of shareholders supporting it in Tuesday's vote. [nL5N1GM1SF]

Last week, shareholders of rival London-listed oil company BP approved CEO Bob Dudley's pay package, which was 40 percent lower than the previous year. [nL8N1IJ463]

Last year, some 60 percent of shareholders voted against Dudley's pay package of nearly $20 million.

UPDATE 1-Company climate risk disclosure could become mandatory in a few years - 路透新闻

{{20170523T122458.441+0000}}UPDATE 1-Company climate risk disclosure could become mandatory in a few years(Adds Shell shareholder vote result)

By Nina Chestney

LONDON, May 23 (Reuters) - Companies' disclosure of risks to their business from climate change could become mandatory in a few years as investor pressure gathers pace, climate finance experts said on Tuesday.

Investors have urged companies, particularly those operating in the oil, gas and coal sectors, to disclose the financial impact of long-term climate change and increase transparency as the world shifts away from fossil fuels.

"I think we are moving towards the disclosure of climate change risks and stress testing of investments by companies. That is something which is gaining traction," John Roome, senior director of climate change at the World Bank, told an FT climate finance summit in London.

"We are now in the voluntary stage but I suspect that in a few years we may very well see standardised requirements from various regulatory authorities on disclosure of climate risk," he added.

Last year, a global task force set up by the G20's Financial Stability Board proposed that companies disclose in their public financial findings how they identify and manage risks to their business from climate change.

Although the measures are voluntary, there are calls for them to become mandatory.

This could happen in a few years and further ahead prudential requirements could be placed on potential stranded assets, Roome said, using a term for assets that no longer provide an economic return because of changes in the market or regulatory environment.

Last year, institutions managing trillions of U.S. dollars of assets called for oil majors Exxon Mobil and Chevron to disclose the impact of curbing global temperature rise on their businesses, although shareholders narrowly voted against resolutions calling for such stress tests.

On Tuesday, Royal Dutch Shell shareholders rejected a proposal by an environmental activist group demanding the oil major sets and publishes annual targets to reduce carbon emissions. [nL9N1BB01U]

There are also a number of financial regulators who argue that climate risk is not part of companies' core business, Roome said.

Environmental lawyer Alice Garton at ClientEarth said existing laws apply to company disclosure where climate risks are material, or affect the economic decisions of shareholders.

There have already been lawsuits in the United States against Exxon Mobil and coal miner Peabody Energy Corp over disclosures related to climate change.

ClientEarth said it had written to energy company BP , miner and trader Glencore and investors this week warning of the risk of investor lawsuits based on statements about future fossil fuel demand in their reporting.

"It is highly likely that more cases like Peabody and Exxon arise in the future. Class action lawyers have become very clever at developing these cases for profit," said Garton, company and financial project leader at ClientEarth.

México apoya recortes de producción impulsados por OPEP para estabilizar al mercado petrolero - 路透新闻

{{20170523T102054.496+0000}}México apoya recortes de producción impulsados por OPEP para estabilizar al mercado petroleroVIENA, 23 mayo (Reuters) - México respalda una ampliación de los recortes a la producción impulsados por la OPEP como una forma de estabilizar los mercados petroleros y atraer nuevas inversiones al creciente sector energético del país, dijo el martes el subsecretario mexicano de Hidrocarburos.

Aldo Flores-Quiroga dijo que cree que los miembros de la Organización de Países Exportadores de Petróleo (OPEP) deberían y continuarán planeando la coordinación de los recortes de producción de petróleo hasta por lo menos el 2018.

No dijo si prefería una extensión de seis o nueve meses, que los miembros de la OPEP están debatiendo.

"Los mercados estables ayudan a proporcionar un marco estable para la inversión, y eso ayuda a México", dijo Flores-Quiroga, que asumió su cargo el verano boreal pasado.

Los ministros de petróleo de la OPEP y productores fuera del grupo se reúnen el jueves en Viena.

México, que no forma parte de la OPEP, ha visto una atrofia de su industria petrolera en los últimos 50 años debido a la subinversión y la regulación hostil de los socios extranjeros.

Cambios constitucionales en el 2013 comenzaron lentamente a atraer capital a la segunda economía más grande de Latinoamérica, pero los bajos precios del crudo han obstaculizado los esfuerzos del Gobierno mexicano.

Exxon Mobil Corp , por ejemplo, planea invertir 300 millones de dólares en estaciones de servicio minoristas durante la próxima década en México, pero importará combustible debido a la falta de capacidad local de refino y suministro de crudo.

Ahead of Exxon's annual meeting, climate activists gain ground - 路透新闻

{{20170522T110001.478+0000}}Ahead of Exxon's annual meeting, climate activists gain groundBy Ross Kerber

BOSTON, May 22 (Reuters) - Shareholder activists focused on climate issues are gaining traction in their push to have large energy companies and utilities take account of the impact rising global temperatures could have on their businesses.

Proponents ranging from giant New York and California state pension funds to Wespath Investment Management of Illinois scored a number of victories this month.

Those include a resolution at PPL Corp approved by 57 percent of votes cast calling for the utility holding company to publicly report how it could be affected by policies and technologies aimed at limiting global warning.

The PPL result comes on the heels of a vote at Occidental Petroleum Corp on a similar resolution, backed by two-thirds of votes cast. Also, top proxy advisers recommended votes in favor of a third such resolution set for Exxon Mobil Corp's annual meeting on May 31.[nL4N1IL1K7]

Activists say the developments suggest they are at an inflection point after years of seeking support from big institutional investors like BlackRock Inc. The giant New York asset manager switched sides in this year's vote at Occidental, citing concerns about the company's pace of disclosures to date.[nL1N1IE20Q]

The reports the activists have sought through the advisory shareholder resolutions are sometimes known as "2 degree scenario analysis" reports after the goal of the 2015 Paris climate accord to limit global temperature increases to 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) from preindustrial levels by phasing out fossil fuels.

The limits could hit companies' bottom lines such as by reducing the revenue they can expect from extracting fossil fuel reserves. Activists hope that having the companies lay out plans for dealing with future regulatory, technology and market changes will smooth their transition to cleaner energy.

Edward Kamonjoh, executive director of the 50/50 Climate Project in Washington, which supports the resolutions, said actions by U.S. President Donald Trump like the dismantling of Obama-era climate policies may have moved big investors to take on a more active role.

While Trump has not so far followed through on a campaign promise to take the United States out of the Paris deal, investors cannot count on strong environmental regulations in the future, he said.

"Investors who feel that climate is a risk now realize they just have themselves to manage this risk in the next few years," Kamonjoh said.

MOOD TEST

Most energy company and utility boards have urged their investors to oppose the measures, some arguing they already take climate change seriously.

A key test of investors' mood will come at the end of May at Exxon. The largest U.S. oil & gas producer argues a climate report is unnecessary because it already conducts reviews that sufficiently test its business for impacts from changing technology and energy demand.

Exxon has offered other arguments including that it supports the Paris agreement, Exxon Secretary Jeffrey Woodbury told investors in a May 18 letter, and that it has invested nearly $7 billion since 2000 on emissions-reduction technology.

At PPL, spokesman Ryan Hill said via e-mail that its board "will carefully consider the results and determine the best path forward." PPL is committed to sustainable energy, he said, noting steps it has taken such as retiring coal plants and building Kentucky's largest solar power facility.

Some companies have made changes even without votes. Activists including Wespath on May 2 said they withdrew a call for a climate-change report from Chevron Corp, citing an 18-page document Chevron issued in March titled "Managing Climate Risks" as a good first step.

While it did not analyze all the scenarios sought by activists, the report went further than past efforts to outline how climate change could affect its profitability.

Chevron CEO John Watson said in the report he "shares the concerns of governments and the public about climate change risks."

Also, Danielle Fugure, president of California nonprofit As You Sow, said last month it withdrew a shareholder resolution calling for a climate risk report from Anadarko Petroleum Corp.. In return, she said, the Texas company agreed to continue to work with her group and others to develop methods for reporting on climate risks that would be practical for the company but still convey to investors the full extent of the risks it could face.

Anadarko spokesman John Christiansen confirmed the agreement. "We are consistently looking for ways to further enhance sustainability in our operations, as well as improve transparency regarding these efforts," he said via e-mail.

Fugure said the high vote totals such as at Occidental show how climate change is becoming an accepted business issue. "The market itself is moving to take carbon risk into account, and the market itself will be pricing carbon risk into the value of companies," she said.

UPDATE 1-Nigerian oil labour union suspends Exxon Mobil strike in Rivers state - 路透新闻

{{20170520T211845.805+0000}}UPDATE 1-Nigerian oil labour union suspends Exxon Mobil strike in Rivers state(Adds trade union comment on nationwide strike)

YENAGOA, Nigeria, May 20 (Reuters) - A Nigerian labour union that had called for the shutdown of all Exxon Mobil Corp facilities in the Niger Delta has suspended its strike at its Rivers state branch in the oil production hub, two union representatives said on Saturday.

Reuters had been unable to verify independently whether members of the Petroleum and Natural Gas Senior Staff Association of Nigeria (PENGASSAN) had shut the company's facilities in the region on Friday, and oil industry sources said there was no impact on production. [nL8N1IL3R8]

"The strike has been suspended," said Chika Onuegbu, who represents PENGASSAN in Rivers state.

Onuegbu and a senior PENGASSAN official, who also said the strike in Rivers state had been suspended but did not want to be identified, said the move followed a ruling by an industrial arbitration panel.

PENGASSAN'S chairman in the Port Harcourt zone, Azubike M Azubike, later said the industrial action had not been suspended elsewhere in the country.

"The strike is still on nationwide, especially in Exxon Mobil facilities across Nigeria. We are still talking with Exxon Mobil management," he said.

Nigerian labour unions have held a number of strikes in the last few months over the dismissal of oil industry workers.

The latest industrial action was in protest at the sacking of 150 workers in December, of which 82 were PENGASSAN members.

Strikes by Exxon workers in Nigeria at the end of last year did affect output, delaying loadings by weeks.

TOP-THEMA-Trump in Riad - Milliarden-Deals für Rüstung und Energie - 路透新闻

{{20170520T173720.763+0000}}TOP-THEMA-Trump in Riad - Milliarden-Deals für Rüstung und Energie* Auftakt zur ersten Auslandsreise

* Tillerson: Deals im Wert von 350 Milliarden Dollar

* Rüstungsabkommen mit Volumen von 110 Milliarden Dollar

* Gegenseitiges Lob über Twitter

(Neu: Tillerson, Saudi-Arabiens Außenminister, Unterzeichnung von Verträgen, Zitate, Unternehmen)

- von Jeff Mason und Steve Holland

Riad, 20. Mai (Reuters) - Donald Trump hat zum Auftakt seiner erste Auslandsreise als US-Präsident am Samstag milliardenschwere Industrieverträge in Saudi-Arabien unter Dach und Fach gebracht. Allein 110 Milliarden Dollar schwer ist nach Angaben der US-Regierung ein Rüstungspaket. Das sind mehr als das Doppelte des deutschen Wehretats. Zusammen mit Abkommen in anderen Bereichen dürften während des ersten Besuchstags von Trump in Riad Verträge im Wert von insgesamt 350 Milliarden Dollar geschlossen worden sein, sagte Außenminister Rex Tillerson. Außenminister Adel al-Dschubeir sagte, Trumps Besuch markiere den Beginn einer Wende in den Beziehungen zwischen den USA und der arabischen Welt. Am Sonntag sollte der US-Präsident in dem Königreich eine mit Spannung erwartete Rede zum Islam halten. Seine insgesamt neuntägige Reise inmitten von Turbulenzen zu Hause führt den 70-Jährigen auch nach Israel sowie Rom, Brüssel und Sizilien.

Trump wurde zusammen mit einer Frau Melania am Flughafen in Riad von König Salman bin Abdelasis Al-Saud begrüßt. Der Empfang war dabei herzlicher als der seines Vorgängers Barack Obama. Später war zu hören, wie der König mit Trump über den Krieg in Syrien sprach. Die Männer tauschten Tweets aus - Trump erklärte wie toll es sei, in Riad zu sein, während Salman davon schrieb, wie der Besuch die strategische Zusammenarbeit der beiden Staaten stärken werde.

"UNSER MILITÄRSEKTOR IST SEHR GLÜCKLICH"

Von dem Rüstungsdeal hatte die Nachrichtenagentur Reuters eine Woche zuvor aus amerikanischen Regierungskreisen erfahren.[nL8N1IF02E] "Das Paket zeigt so deutlich wie nur möglich wie die USA zu unseren Partnerschaften mit Saudi-Arabien und unseren Partnern in der Golfregion stehen", hieß es in einer Erklärung des Präsidialamts. Zudem würden in der amerikanischen Rüstungsindustrie Zehntausende neue Stellen geschaffen. Das seien "riesige Investitionen in die USA", sagte Trump nach der Unterzeichnungszeremonie in Riad. "Unserer Militärsektor ist sehr glücklich."

Zu dem Paket gehört die Montage von 150 "Blackhawk"-Kampfhubschraubern in Saudi-Arabien. Dieser Sechs-Milliarden-Dollar-Deal soll im Königreich 450 Stellen schaffen. Der einheimische Ölriese Aramco erklärte, es werde auch mit der Unterzeichnung von Abkommen mit US-Unternehmen im Umfang von 50 Milliarden Dollar gerechnet. Auch Exxon, GE, Raytheon, General Dynamics und Dow Chemical gehören zu den Unternehmen mit Vereinbarungen. Zum Teil wurden in die Liste bereits vorher angekündigte Verträge sowie Absichtserklärungen aufgenommen. Saudi-Arabien will seine Wirtschaft unabhängiger vom Öl machen.[nL8N1I30QS]

US-ZEITUNGEN MIT NEUEN ENTHÜLLUNGEN IN RUSSLAND-AFFÄRE

Die Regierungen der ersten beiden Länder auf Trumps Reise, Saudi-Arabien und Israel, teilen die negativen Ansichten des neuen US-Präsidenten zum Iran. Beide Staaten hatten Obama vorgeworfen, nicht hart genug gegenüber der Islamischen Republik aufgetreten. Trump hat insbesondere das Atomabkommen kritisiert.

Seine Reise wird von der Russland-Affäre in den USA überschattet.[nL8N1IM039] Einem neuen Bericht der "New York Times" zufolge sagte Trump bei einem Treffen mit russischen Vertretern, die Entlassung von FBI-Direktor James Comey habe den Druck durch den Ermittlungen der Behörden von ihn genommen. Die "Washington Post" berichtete ihrerseits, ein hochrangiger Berater Trumps werde als "Person von Interesse" eingestuft. Zudem wurde bekannt, dass Comey in einer öffentlichen Anhörung eines Senatsausschusses Rede und Antwort stehen will.

ExxonMobil, Total discuss offshore drilling opportunities in Greece -ministry - 路透新闻

{{20170519T164059.441+0000}}ExxonMobil, Total discuss offshore drilling opportunities in Greece -ministryATHENS, May 19 (Reuters) - Greece's energy minister held talks on Friday with representatives of U.S. oil major ExxonMobil and France's Total about gas exploration opportunities off Greek shores, the energy ministry said.

A government official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said a consortium of ExxonMobil, Total and Greece's biggest oil refiner Hellenic Petroleum are expected to submit an offer "in the coming period" for exploration south of Crete.

Friday's meeting focused on "prospects for exploration and exploitation of hydrocarbon deposits," the energy ministry said in a statement.

Greece has made several fruitless attempts over the last 50 years to find big oil and gas reserves, but its debt crisis has prompted it to step up those efforts.

Athens previously tendered blocks off Crete, its southernmost island north of Egypt and Libya and west of Cyprus, in 2013 but did not receive bids.

The country is also hoping to find gas off western Greece and last year named a consortium of Total, Hellenic Petroleum and Italy's Edison as the preferred bidder for an offshore gas drilling block in the Ionian Sea. Licensing is expected this year.

Exploring for gas in the Mediterranean has become more attractive since Italy's Eni discovered Egypt's offshore Zohr field in the Levant Basin in 2015, the biggest gas field in the Mediterranean and estimated to contain 850 billion cubic metres of gas.

UPDATE 1-Nigerian oil labour union calls for Exxon Mobil shutdown in Delta - 路透新闻

{{20170519T150014.731+0000}}UPDATE 1-Nigerian oil labour union calls for Exxon Mobil shutdown in Delta(Adds Exxon Mobil comment, additional union comment)

By Tife Owolabi

YENAGOA, Nigeria, May 19 (Reuters) - A Nigerian labour union on Friday called for the shutdown of all Exxon Mobil Corp facilities in the Niger Delta, a union representative said.

Reuters was unable to independently verify whether union members had shut down the company's facilities.

Oil industry sources said there had been no impact on production.

Madubuezi Azubuike, who chairs the Petroleum and Natural Gas Senior Staff Association of Nigeria (PENGASSAN) in Rivers state, said the call followed the breakdown of talks with the company over sackings and was part of a strike that began last week. [nL8N1ID4TU]

"We have called for the shutdown of all Mobil facilities across the Delta today," he said.

The industrial action is in protest at the sacking of 150 workers in December, of which 82 were PENGASSAN members.

"No resolution has been reached so far. We have had meetings with top management of the union and Mobil executives, but with no avail over issues," Azubuike said.

The strike will target the oil company's wells, said Chika Onuegbu, another PENGASSAN official.

An Exxon Mobil spokesman said: "We respect the rights of our workforce and will continue to engage with them to resolve this situation but remain committed to the safety of our personnel and security of our facilities."

Strikes by Exxon workers in Nigeria at the end of last year did affect output, delaying loadings by weeks.

Nigerian labour unions have held a number of strikes in the last few months over the dismissal of oil industry workers.

"If the result is not enough, we have 5 percent discretion from the minister. If that's still not enough, now we have a problem."

The latest offer includes 10 conventional blocks and 5 non-conventional oil and gas blocks and all will be offered under a gross split production sharing contract scheme, Wiratmaja Puja, director general of oil and gas told reporters.

Unlike the conventional pools of oil and natural gas, unconventional oil and natural gas do not flow naturally through the rock, making them much more difficult to produce.

Details of the offer are below:

Conventional oil and gas blocks Regular bids: 1. Tongkol (East Natuna Basin) 2. East Tanimbar (Maluku) 3. Memberamo (Papua) Direct offers: 1. Andaman I 2. Andaman II 3.South Tuna (Riau island) 4. Merak (Banten&Lampung) 5. Pekawai (East Kalimantan) 6. West Yamdena (Maluku) 7. Kasuri III (West Papua) Non-conventional oil and gas blocks

Shale gas: 1. Jambi I 2. Jambi II Coal bed methane: 1. Raja (South Sumatra) 2. Bungamas (South Sumatra) 3. West Air Komering (South Sumatra) Indonesia offered a total of 17 oil and gas blocks last year, according to Tunggal, Indonesia's upstream oil and gas director.

"There were lots of bids, but because of evaluations in the end there was only one winner," he said.

Thin interest in the 2016 tender was a result of low oil prices, among other factors, said Tahar, who denied that Indonesia was unattractive to energy investors.

"It wasn't the (investment) climate, but there was a combination of what investors' strategies were like (and) oil prices were down," Tahar told reporters, noting that the recently introduced gross split mechanism had not proven to be more or less attractive yet.

"In fact we are now more open to change things that never used to be changed. We have opened everything now," he added.

"When oil prices pick up (investment) doesn't necessarily go up. It's slow - there's a lag."

But industry participants were less enthusiastic about the latest offer, and said more work is still needed to make Indonesia attractive.

"In Indonesia at the moment, the returns are difficult, the time to get a return is too long, and the risk of political involvement is quite high," said Andrew Harwood, director of Asia Pacific upstream oil and gas research at WoodMackenzie.

"So it's difficult for Indonesia at the current stage to get the gross split to be attractive against other opportunities oil and gas companies have elsewhere," he said referring to opportunities in the Gulf of Mexico, Africa, Europe and Australia.

The sentiment was shared by oil company executives.

"Indonesia is less economically competitive than other countries," said one executive at an international oil company operating in Indonesia, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter.

"Production is going down in oil and gas, while a lot of countries are increasing, so I think that says it all."

Despite President Joko Widodo's efforts to improve the ease of doing business for energy investors in Indonesia, there is "still much more work to do," he said.

Countries that have traditionally done a very good job in attracting capital from energy investors were those that provided competitive fiscal terms, contract sanctity and a stable regulatory regime, he said.

"Indonesia has to compete well for capital or they'll go somewhere else."

RPT-ExxonMobil planea iniciar importación combustibles para sus gasolineras en México antes de fin 2017 - 路透新闻

{{20170519T120828.984+0000}}RPT-ExxonMobil planea iniciar importación combustibles para sus gasolineras en México antes de fin 2017(Repite nota transmitida la noche anterior. Texto sin cambios)

CIUDAD DE MÉXICO, 18 mayo (Reuters) - La petrolera estadounidense ExxonMobil iniciará antes de fines del año la importación de gasolina para abastecer las estaciones de servicio que planea abrir en el corto plazo en México, dijo el jueves el director de combustibles de la empresa, Martin Proske.

El gigante petrolero anunció el miércoles que planea invertir unos 300 millones de dólares en México en los próximos 10 años en logística, productos y mercadotecnia para suministrar combustible y otros productos a segmentos de mayoreo, menudeo, industrial y comercial. [nL2N1IJ0VW]

"El inicio de eso, antes del fin del año", respondió Proske a la pregunta de cuándo esperaban comenzar a importar su propia gasolina para abastecer sus nuevas estaciones de servicio.

La reforma energética implementada hace casi tres años abrió toda la cadena de los hidrocarburos a la inversión privada, acabando con el monopolio que la estatal Pemex tenía en el sector.

BP inauguró en marzo su primera estación de gasolina en Ciudad de México y anunció que planeaba abrir 1,500 en el próximo lustro. [ID:nL2N1IJ046]

Proxy firm ISS advises vote against Exxon exec pay plan - 路透新闻

{{20170519T040111.122+0000}}Proxy firm ISS advises vote against Exxon exec pay planMay 18 (Reuters) - Influential proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) recommended investors break with Exxon Mobil Corp on some closely watched questions due to be voted at the energy company's May 31 annual meeting.

ISS recommended investors vote "against" the pay of Exxon's top executives, questioning if pay awards are strongly linked to performance, according to a report sent by an ISS spokesman on Thursday evening.

ISS recommended votes in favor of a shareholder resolution requesting Exxon to provide more information on the impact that climate change regulation could have on its business.

ISS supported all of Exxon's directors up for election and backed its board recommendations on some other matters.

But the ISS recommendations against the company on the two high-profile questions show the pressure faced by the energy giant as shareholders mobilize more support on climate issues from big institutional investors.

Just last week for instance investors at Occidental Petroleum passed a similar measure calling for a report on the impact climate change policies could have on its business, after BlackRock Inc switched sides. [nL1N1IE20Q]

ExxonMobil planea iniciar importación combustibles para sus gasolineras en México antes de fin 2017 - 路透新闻

{{20170519T013424.880+0000}}ExxonMobil planea iniciar importación combustibles para sus gasolineras en México antes de fin 2017CIUDAD DE MÉXICO, 18 mayo (Reuters) - La petrolera estadounidense ExxonMobil iniciará antes de fines del año la importación de gasolina para abastecer las estaciones de servicio que planea abrir en el corto plazo en México, dijo el jueves el director de combustibles de la empresa, Martin Proske.

El gigante petrolero anunció el miércoles que planea invertir unos 300 millones de dólares en México en los próximos 10 años en logística, productos y mercadotecnia para suministrar combustible y otros productos a segmentos de mayoreo, menudeo, industrial y comercial. [nL2N1IJ0VW]

"El inicio de eso, antes del fin del año", respondió Proske a la pregunta de cuándo esperaban comenzar a importar su propia gasolina para abastecer sus nuevas estaciones de servicio.

La reforma energética implementada hace casi tres años abrió toda la cadena de los hidrocarburos a la inversión privada, acabando con el monopolio que la estatal Pemex tenía en el sector.

BP inauguró en marzo su primera estación de gasolina en Ciudad de México y anunció que planeaba abrir 1,500 en el próximo lustro. [ID:nL2N1IJ046]

ExxonMobil plans to import fuel to Mexico to supply its gas stations - 路透新闻

{{20170519T005047.319+0000}}ExxonMobil plans to import fuel to Mexico to supply its gas stationsMEXICO CITY, May 18 (Reuters) - ExxonMobil Corp said on Thursday that it will start importing its own gasoline into Mexico before the end of the year to supply the Mobil-brand gas stations it will be opening in Latin America's second largest economy.

ExxonMobil expects to open its first service stations in Mexico later this year and will sell gasoline and diesel fuels, as it pumps $300 million in the coming decade in an effort to gain a foothold in the country's retail fuel market.[nL2N1IJ0UZ]

"The start of this will be before year end, either through open season or through commitments with infrastructure developers," said Martin Proske, the company's director of fuels in Mexico, of when ExxonMobil would start importing its own gasoline to supply the service stations.

The so-called open season auctions, which will be staggered throughout this year, will allow private companies to bid for access to surplus pipeline capacity within state-owned Pemex's [PEMX.UL] existing network.

For decades, Mexico's fuel market was closed, by law, to any company but Pemex. But in 2013, reforms ended Pemex's monopoly in everything from crude oil production to retail sales.

Proske said future supply options included importing fuel via train or boat or buying gasoline from Pemex.

The plan follows BP Plc's announcement earlier this year that the British oil giant would open about 1,500 service stations in Mexico within five years.

Mexico is home to about 11,400 gas stations and is the world's fourth biggest gasoline market, Mexico's energy minister has said.

Exxon's Baton Rouge refinery returns CDU to full production: sources - 路透新闻

{{20170518T225627.759+0000}}Exxon's Baton Rouge refinery returns CDU to full production: sourcesHOUSTON, May 18 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp's 502,500 barrel per day (bpd) Baton Rouge, Louisiana, refinery returned the second largest crude distillation unit to full production on Thursday, said sources familiar with plant operations.

The 110,000 bpd PSLA-9 CDU restarted on Tuesday. It was shut on April 24 for a planned overhaul that included cleaning heater tubes on the unit. The work was originally scheduled to wrap up around May 7, but was extended for a week.

RPT-Empresas ven menos probable colapso de TLCAN, firmas EEUU comprometidas a invertir en México: asociación - 路透新闻

{{20170518T123731.048+0000}}RPT-Empresas ven menos probable colapso de TLCAN, firmas EEUU comprometidas a invertir en México: asociación(Repetición de nota transmitida la noche anterior. No altera texto)

Por Ana Isabel Martinez y Dave Graham

CIUDAD DE MÉXICO, 17 mayo (Reuters) - Las empresas ven menos probable que el Tratado de Libre Comercio de América del Norte (TLCAN) colapse y las grandes firmas estadounidenses establecidas en México están comprometidas a seguir invirtiendo en el país, dijo el miércoles el jefe de una asociación de empresas internacionales.

Frederic García, presidente del Consejo Ejecutivo de Empresas Globales (CEEG, por su sigla en inglés) dijo que los avances en el proceso para comenzar a renegociar el TLCAN y una mayor conciencia de sus beneficios económicos han puesto fin a los temores de que el acuerdo sea desechado.

"Hubo un momento donde la probabilidad, o la percepción de que se iba a parar el TLCAN era muy fuerte. Hoy en día creo que la percepción de esa probabilidad ya no es lo mismo", dijo García. "La gran preocupación que podía existir de que ya no va a seguir el tratado ya es un tema que está detrás", agregó.

El CEEG aglutina a las mayores multinacionales en México, incluidas AT&T , Coca-Cola , General Motors , Microsoft , Exxon Mobil , Nestlé, HSBC, Siemens e IBM , que dice representan alrededor del 40 por ciento del total de la inversión extranjera directa.

Junto con otras asociaciones empresariales, el CEEG ha participado activamente en exaltar los beneficios del TLCAN para contrarrestar las amenazas del presidente estadounidense, Donald Trump, de abandonar el pacto comercial que su país mantiene desde 1994 con México y Canadá.

El secretario de Economía de México, Ildefonso Guajardo, dijo el martes que espera que el Gobierno de Trump notifique formalmente la próxima semana al Congreso estadounidense sobre su intención de renegociar el acuerdo. [nL2N1II1C3]

La semana pasada, una asociación que agrupa a las principales empresas mexicanas dijo que planeaban reducir ligeramente sus inversiones este año debido a la incertidumbre sobre Trump, pero García dijo que el CEEG no haría pronósticos sobre los desembolsos que se tienen proyectados. [nL1N1IE0EF]

"Las empresas norteamericanas dentro del CEEG, desde el primer día de la administración nueva en Estados Unidos han manifestado su gran interés de seguir operando en México (y) su gran interés de seguir invirtiendo en México", dijo.

ExxonMobil secures Qatari condensate for Singapore unit - sources - 路透新闻

{{20170518T084301.718+0000}}ExxonMobil secures Qatari condensate for Singapore unit - sourcesSINGAPORE, May 18 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp has outbid other Asian buyers of deodorised field condensate (DFC) in a tender floated by Qatar Petroleum, to secure supplies for a newly purchased refining-petrochemical complex in Singapore, sources with knowledge of the matter said on Thursday.

The U.S. oil major bid for the cargoes of the ultra light oil at more than $2 a barrel above Dubai quotes, the sources said, adding that other buyers had intended to pay a premium of less than $2.

The cargoes will load from July to September.

ExxonMobil declined to comment. Qatar Petroleum did not respond to an e-mail seeking comment.

The higher-than-expected bid was likely due to expectations that condensate exports from the Middle East could tighten as Qatar resumed operations at its Ras Laffan splitter last week and Iran recently started up a new splitter, the sources said.

Earlier this month, ExxonMobil said it reached an agreement to buy a refining and petrochemical plant owned by Jurong Aromatics (JAC) in Singapore that will boost its output and meet demand in Asia. [nL4N1ID1R0]

Empresas ven menos probable colapso de TLCAN, firmas EEUU comprometidas a invertir en México: asociación - 路透新闻

{{20170518T022313.482+0000}}Empresas ven menos probable colapso de TLCAN, firmas EEUU comprometidas a invertir en México: asociaciónPor Ana Isabel Martinez y Dave Graham

CIUDAD DE MÉXICO, 17 mayo (Reuters) - Las empresas ven menos probable que el Tratado de Libre Comercio de América del Norte (TLCAN) colapse y las grandes firmas estadounidenses establecidas en México están comprometidas a seguir invirtiendo en el país, dijo el miércoles el jefe de una asociación de empresas internacionales.

Frederic García, presidente del Consejo Ejecutivo de Empresas Globales (CEEG, por su sigla en inglés) dijo que los avances en el proceso para comenzar a renegociar el TLCAN y una mayor conciencia de sus beneficios económicos han puesto fin a los temores de que el acuerdo sea desechado.

"Hubo un momento donde la probabilidad, o la percepción de que se iba a parar el TLCAN era muy fuerte. Hoy en día creo que la percepción de esa probabilidad ya no es lo mismo", dijo García. "La gran preocupación que podía existir de que ya no va a seguir el tratado ya es un tema que está detrás", agregó.

El CEEG aglutina a las mayores multinacionales en México, incluidas AT&T , Coca-Cola , General Motors , Microsoft , Exxon Mobil , Nestlé, HSBC, Siemens e IBM , que dice representan alrededor del 40 por ciento del total de la inversión extranjera directa.

Junto con otras asociaciones empresariales, el CEEG ha participado activamente en exaltar los beneficios del TLCAN para contrarrestar las amenazas del presidente estadounidense, Donald Trump, de abandonar el pacto comercial que su país mantiene desde 1994 con México y Canadá.

El secretario de Economía de México, Ildefonso Guajardo, dijo el martes que espera que el Gobierno de Trump notifique formalmente la próxima semana al Congreso estadounidense sobre su intención de renegociar el acuerdo. [nL2N1II1C3]

La semana pasada, una asociación que agrupa a las principales empresas mexicanas dijo que planeaban reducir ligeramente sus inversiones este año debido a la incertidumbre sobre Trump, pero García dijo que el CEEG no haría pronósticos sobre los desembolsos que se tienen proyectados. [nL1N1IE0EF]

"Las empresas norteamericanas dentro del CEEG, desde el primer día de la administración nueva en Estados Unidos han manifestado su gran interés de seguir operando en México (y) su gran interés de seguir invirtiendo en México", dijo.

NAFTA demise fears fade as U.S. firms committed to Mexico -lobby - 路透新闻

{{20170517T235233.530+0000}}NAFTA demise fears fade as U.S. firms committed to Mexico -lobbyBy Dave Graham and Ana Isabel Martinez

MEXICO CITY, May 17 (Reuters) - Companies no longer fear the North American Trade Agreement (NAFTA) will collapse and top U.S. multinationals in Mexico are committed to investing in the country going forward, the head of a global business lobby said on Wednesday.

Frederic Garcia, President of Mexico's Executive Council of Global Companies (CEEG), said preparations to renegotiate NAFTA and growing awareness of the accord's economic benefits had all but put an end to fears that the deal would be scrapped.

"There was a moment where the probability, or the perception that NAFTA would end, was very strong," Garcia said in an interview in Mexico City. "But today I think there's an awareness that it will continue. The big worry that the deal could come to an end is an issue that's behind us."

The CEEG represents a host of multinationals in Mexico including AT&T Inc , Coca-Cola Co , General Motors Co , Microsoft Corp , Exxon Mobil Corp , Nestle, HSBC, Siemens and IBM Corp , which it says account for around 40 percent of total foreign direct investment.

It and other business associations have been active in extolling the benefits of NAFTA to Americans to counter threats by U.S. President Donald Trump to dump the 23 year-old accord that binds the United States, Mexico and Canada.

Mexico's Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo said on Tuesday he expected the U.S. government to notify Congress early next week of plans to rework the accord, yielding talks by late August. [nL2N1II1AT]

It was not yet clear how NAFTA would be revamped, but if Mexico's efforts to update its free trade deal with the European Union proved instructive, it could include provisions to boost corporate compliance and adherence to the law, Garcia said.

Trump said last month he was ready to renegotiate NAFTA with Mexico and Canada, though since taking the presidency in January he also has maintained that the United States could withdraw from the agreement if talks did not work in favor of his homeland. [nL1N1I0047]

Arguing the accord has destroyed U.S. jobs, Trump has menaced multinationals manufacturing in Mexico with punitive tariffs, and his threats to quit NAFTA. This sent the peso to a record low in January.

Earlier that month Ford abruptly canceled a $1.6 billion plant in central Mexico following verbal attacks by Trump. But as the rhetoric from the White House began to moderate, the peso has recovered somewhat, and fears for NAFTA's future have eased.

Last week, a Mexican business lobby said it expected investment to drop slightly this year due to uncertainty over Trump, but Garcia said the CEEG would make no forecasts over projected outlays to avoid drawing attention to the matter.

"As far as the U.S. firms in the CEEG go, from the first day of the new U.S. administration they've stated their great interest to continue operating in Mexico (and) their great interest to continue investing in Mexico," he said.

However, they had done so in such a way as to preserve their interests with the U.S. administration, Garcia added.

UPDATE 3-Exxon says to open gas stations in Mexico, invest $300 mln - 路透新闻

{{20170517T234118.016+0000}}UPDATE 3-Exxon says to open gas stations in Mexico, invest $300 mln(Adds details, report on Shell gas stations)

MEXICO CITY, May 17 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp announced it will bring its Mobil-brand gas stations to Mexico, pumping $300 million in the coming decade as it seeks to gain a foothold in the country's retail fuel market.

Exxon expects to open its first service stations in Mexico later this year and will offer motorists its Synergy gasoline and diesel fuels, the U.S.-based oil company said in a statement on Wednesday.

The company did not specify how many service stations it would open in Mexico or where it would source the fuel for them. But local newspaper Reforma reported on Wednesday that Exxon company official Martin Proske said in an interview that supply options included importing fuel via train or boat or buying gasoline from state-owned Pemex [PEMX.UL].

The plan follows BP Plc's announcement earlier this year that the British oil giant would open about 1,500 service stations in Mexico within five years.

BP told Reuters on Wednesday that its foray into Mexico is proving more promising than expected, and that it would likely increase its investment in everything from exploration to retail fuel sales. [nL2N1IJ13S]

Separately, Mexican media reported Royal Dutch Shell said it would also open its first gas station in the country this year, citing the firm's downstream chief for Mexico, Andres Cavallari. Shell did not immediately reply to requests for comment.

Latin America's No. 2 economy is home to about 11,400 gas stations and is the world's fourth biggest gasoline market, Mexico's energy minister has said.

For decades, Mexico's fuel market was closed - by law - to any company but Pemex. But in 2013, reforms ended Pemex's monopoly in everything from crude oil production to retail sales.

"Recent energy reforms present a unique opportunity to help meet the growing demand for reliable fuel supplies and quality service in Mexico," Exxon's Proske said in a company statement.

Fears had grown in Mexico that foreign investment might fall after U.S. President Donald Trump was elected last year, as he railed against companies that moved operations to Mexico.

U.S.-Mexico relations have also been strained by Trump's threat to ditch the North American Free Trade Agreement and his promise to build a wall between the two countries.

But Exxon's announcement was the latest good news for Mexico's economy after General Electric Co last week praised the country as vital to its growth and Siemens later said that it was going to swap out U.S. imports for local supplies at its Mexican plants. [nL2N1IH1WG] [nL1N1IE18Z]

However, growing fuel theft has worried some in the energy sector. Mexican authorities have been struggling to contain criminal gangs siphoning off fuel that Pemex has said is costing it some 27,000 barrels per day in gasoline and diesel.

BREAKINGVIEWS-Running government like business proves difficult - 路透新闻

{{20170517T181615.991+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-Running government like business proves difficult(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are her own.)

By Gina Chon

WASHINGTON, May 17 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Running the U.S. government like a business is proving to be difficult. Donald Trump promised American voters to operate the White House as if it was a company. But the skills required in his private real-estate firm are proving less transferable than those for the boss of a public company, with its many checks and balances and multiple constituencies. In the corporate world, an independent board is often the best hope for a course correction. In the Trump era, that job will have to fall to Congress.

Trump touted his business acumen, as a successful builder of shiny skyscrapers and reality-TV celebrity, as the solution to making America great again. He stacked his administration with corporate and finance executives from places like Exxon Mobil and Goldman Sachs . He said his skills as a dealmaker would help forge beautiful trade pacts and a huge tax-reform plan. Voters fell for the pitch.

Yet though he spent his career in the public eye, the Trump Organization is a private family business. His three eldest children were executives at the firm, along with a handful of loyal longtime associates. Trump, though, was the decider and rarely answered to outsiders, though he had to deal with creditors in his four bankruptcies. Alan Garten, general counsel for Trump's company, summed it up in an interview with Corporate Counsel in 2016: "At the end of the day, I work for the Trump family."

As a consequence, Trump never faced the kind of oversight that comes with being the chief executive of a public company. At the top is the board of directors, who are elected by shareholders and have a fiduciary obligation to serve them. The CEO reports to the board, which assesses management, and increasingly an independent chairman. The directors typically base a chief executive's compensation on how the company performed over a fiscal year.

Trump faced none of these disciplining forces in his own company, and brought his informal management style to the White House, along with family members. Ivanka, his daughter, has a West Wing office, as does her husband, senior adviser Jared Kushner. Trump's longtime bodyguard, Keith Schiller, also came along. He was sent to the FBI to deliver the dismissal letter for Director James Comey, who was investigating potential Russian ties to the Trump campaign. As in New York, Trump has an open-door policy for the Oval Office and aides often make unscheduled visits. That allows administration officials to regularly curry his favor and slip information, pertinent or otherwise, onto his desk.

This lack of discipline has led to numerous self-inflicted wounds in the four-month-old Trump administration. In the latest controversy, the New York Times reported Tuesday that Trump asked Comey to end the FBI's probe of former National Security Adviser Mike Flynn, which if true could constitute an attempt to obstruct law enforcement. The White House denied that Trump made such a request. Flynn resigned in February after making misstatements to Vice President Mike Pence about his conversations with the Russian ambassador.

The limits of Trump's informal style, which might have worked when licensing his name out to hoteliers in Azerbaijan or a Chinese maker of ties, is most evident in the White House's frequent communications missteps. Last week, for instance, administration officials offered explanations for Comey's firing that were then contradicted by the commander-in-chief in a televised interview.

At public companies, it is imperative for chief executives to scale their messages far and wide, from their deputies down to their front-line staff, and across to investors, suppliers, customers, union officials and politicians. Trump didn't need to do that in private business, and is failing to ensure the members of his administration are on the same page on important matters ranging from Comey to trade.

Moreover, when a scandal erupts at a public company, there is often an independent probe commissioned by the board, with investigators reporting to independent directors. From 2012 to 2016, there was a 36 percent increase in dismissals of CEOs due to scandals or misconduct compared to 2007 to 2011, according to a study by a unit of PwC released on Monday. Stanford University researchers found that nearly 60 percent of CEOs were fired in incidents where bad behavior garnered meaningful media coverage. Over the last year, the top dogs at Valeant , Wells Fargo and Fox News all left their respective companies amid alleged wrongdoing by them or their employees.

The system isn't perfect and many times boards are too entrenched and slow to respond, while directors are chummy with management. But it provides some accountability and boards can also punish executives for screwing up. To wit, Barclays directors have pledged to cut CEO Jes Staley's pay by a "very significant" amount for trying to find out the identity of a whistleblower.

Even some private companies have implemented changes after CEO missteps. In February, Uber [UBER.UL] hired former Attorney General Eric Holder to investigate allegations of sexual harassment. In March, Uber CEO Travis Kalanick said he was on the lookout for a No. 2 after he acknowledged he "must fundamentally change as a leader and grow up." He had lashed out at an Uber driver complaining about reduced prices, which was caught on video.

Of course, the White House is different from a public company and the bar for admonishing or ousting a president should be very high. It was Trump, however, who promised to bring business savvy to government, so should be judged accordingly. His victory benefited the Republican Party, which cemented control of the House of Representatives and the Senate.

So to complete the corporate analogy, it falls on the majority party, particularly in the Senate, to act as the most important check on the president. That means Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell effectively plays the role of lead independent director. If he fails to correct the course of dysfunction, Congress can expect to feel the wrath of shareholders, that is, American voters.

Exxon va ouvrir des stations-service au Mexique  - 路透新闻

{{20170517T171221.156+0000}}Exxon va ouvrir des stations-service au Mexique MEXICO, 17 mai (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil a annoncé mercredi qu'il investirait 300 millions de dollars (269 millions d'euros) au cours de la prochaine décennie afin d'entrer sur le marché mexicain du carburant, ajoutant qu'il ouvrirait sa première station-service sous la marque Mobil cette année.

Exxon proposera son essence Synergy et ses gazoles et investira dans la logistique, les produits et le marketing, a précisé le groupe américain, première capitalisation pétrolière mondiale.

"Les récentes réformes dans le domaine de l'énergie représentent une occasion unique de répondre à la demande croissante au Mexique pour des carburants fiables et un service de qualité", a déclaré dans un communiqué Martin Proske, un des responsables d'Exxon.

En 2013, la réforme dans le secteur de l'énergie a mis fin au monopole de la compagnie pétrolière mexicaine publique Pemex, qui allait de la production de pétrole à la distribution.

ACTUALIZA 1-ExxonMobil planea invertir 300 mln dlr en México en próxima década, abrirá primera estación de servicio en 2017 - 路透新闻

{{20170517T161211.148+0000}}ACTUALIZA 1-ExxonMobil planea invertir 300 mln dlr en México en próxima década, abrirá primera estación de servicio en 2017(Actualiza con citas y contexto)

CIUDAD DE MÉXICO, 17 mayo (Reuters) - La gigante estadounidense ExxonMobil dijo el miércoles que planea invertir unos 300 millones de dólares en México en los próximos 10 años en logística, productos y mercadotecnia para suministrar combustible y otros productos a segmentos de mayoreo, menudeo, industrial y comercial.

La petrolera , que hasta diciembre tuvo como director ejecutivo al ahora secretario de Estado de Estados Unidos, Rex Tillerson, informó que abrirá su primera estación de gasolina en la región central de México en el segundo semestre del 2017 y, posteriormente, inaugurará más en el transcurso del año.

"La reciente reforma energética presenta una oportunidad única en el mercado mexicano para ayudar a satisfacer la creciente demanda de combustibles y un servicio más competitivo", dijo Martin Proske, director de combustibles de ExxonMobil México, citado en un comunicado.

En una entrevista con el diario local Reforma, precisó que la empresa evalúa desde comprar gasolina a la petrolera estatal mexicana Pemex y agregarle su propio aditivo hasta importarla a través de barco o tren.

El Gobierno mexicano abrió hace un año la importación de gasolina y diésel, una actividad que era exclusiva de Pemex, que tuvo el monopolio de los hidrocarburos hasta la entrada en vigor de la reforma energética aprobada durante la gestión del presidente Enrique Peña Nieto.

Otras petroleras internacionales han dicho que planean abrir estaciones de servicio en México, donde hay unas 11,400 gasolineras.

BP inauguró en marzo su primera estación en Ciudad de México y anunció que planeaba abrir 1,500 en el próximo lustro. [nL2N1IJ046]

Si bien las franquicias de Pemex aún dominan el sector de combustible al por menor, varias otras compañías han anunciado planes para entrar al mercado, incluyendo a la cadena de tiendas de conveniencia Oxxo de FEMSA y a Gulf Oil.

RPT-INSIGHT-In America's largest oilfield, whir of activity confounds OPEC - 路透新闻

By Ernest Scheyder

LEA COUNTY, N.M., May 17 (Reuters) - As oilfield workers for Lilis Energy Inc threaded together drill pipes one recent morning in the Permian Basin, a bulldozer cleared sagebrush to make way for the company's fifth well since January.

Lilis aims to expand production sevenfold this year in America's most active oilfield.

The whir of activity is all the more impressive after the small firm nearly collapsed in late 2015 - amid unrestrained production from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). As per-barrel prices plummeted, Lilis piled on debt and struggled to pay workers.

Now - with prices higher after a November OPEC decision to cut output - Lilis can't grow fast enough.

Such resurrections are common these days in the Permian, which stretches across West Texas and eastern New Mexico. They tell the story of the U.S. shale resurgence and the quandary it poses for OPEC as it struggles to tame a global glut.

Surging U.S. production has stalled OPEC's effort to cut supply. Inventories in industrialized nations totaled 3.05 billion barrels in February - about 330 million barrels above the five-year average, according to the International Energy Agency.

The Permian boom will be high on the agenda as OPEC oil ministers begin gathering in Vienna ahead of a May 25 policy meeting to decide whether to extend output cuts.[nL4N1IA1M6]

In the long term, too much U.S. output could spur OPEC to open the spigots again - setting off another price war - but for now its member nations' need for revenue makes that unlikely.

On Monday, the world's top two oil producers - OPEC heavyweight Saudi Arabia and Russia, a non-OPEC nation - said they had agreed in principle on the need to continue output cuts for an additional nine months, through March 2018. [nL4N1IH4FH]

That would extend the initial agreement, which took effect in January and reduced production by 1.2 barrels per day (bpd) from OPEC nations and another 600,000 bpd from non-OPEC producers, including Russia.

The pledge to extend cuts marked an evolution in the thinking of Saudi Arabia Oil Minister Khalid al-Falih - in response to surging U.S. output.

After OPEC's decision in November, Al-Falih expressed confidence that no further supply curbs would be needed because of rising demand.

Then in March, Al-Falih told a Houston energy conference that the "green shoots" in U.S. shale might be "growing too fast" - and warned there would be no "free rides" for U.S. producers benefiting from OPEC production cuts.

But by last week, Al-Falih vowed OPEC would do "whatever it takes" to control oversupply.

Unlike OPEC nations, U.S. firms are barred by anti-trust laws from colluding to control output or prices, leaving market demand as the only check on production.

"I'm really proud American production is offsetting those OPEC cuts," said Lilis Chief Executive Avi Mirman.

FREE RIDE ON OPEC CUTS

Now it appears the free ride for U.S. shale producers will continue at least into next year.

U.S. oil output has jumped to 9.31 million bpd this year, up 440,000 bpd from 2016, according to U.S. Energy Information Agency estimates.

About a quarter of that production comes from the Permian, where broad-based growth comes from small firms like Lilis, global majors including Exxon Mobil Corp and large independents such as Parsley Energy Inc .

OPEC's two-year price war sank hundreds of companies and forced majors including Exxon and Chevron Corp to retrench - but it also and stirred their interest in shale.

Exxon paid nearly $7 billion in February to double its acreage in the Permian. [nL4N1F74E1]

Earlier this month, about 20 miles (32 km) south of Midland, Texas - the center of the basin's industry - a crew from ProPetro Holding Corp was hydraulically fracturing, or fracking, an Exxon well.

Silver silos held 18 million pounds of sand, which would be mixed with 22 million gallons of water and forced into the well, unlocking oil trapped in rock.

"We're really approaching the Permian as a major project," Sara Ortwein, president of Exxon's shale-focused subsidiary, XTO Energy, said in an interview.

Across the Permian, the number of rigs this year has risen 30 percent and the number of fracking crews has jumped 40 percent, according to Primary Vision, which tracks oilfield service equipment usage.

That won't change soon, said Mark Papa, CEO of Centennial Resource Development Inc , which added to its Permian land holdings this month with a $350 million deal.

"A disproportionate amount of U.S. production growth between now and the end of the decade will come from the Permian," Papa said in an interview.

'WE'RE OUT OF RIGS'

In a reversal from the thousands of layoffs here in 2015, oil companies are hiring briskly.

Fracking service provider Keane Group Inc , for instance, has plans to hire at least 240 workers this year.

For the growth to continue, however, prices will have to rise for rigs and other services, executives and analysts have said.

Paul Mosvold, president of drilling contractor Scandrill Inc, has more business than he can handle.

"We're out of rigs," he said. "We have been since January."

But he won't add more rigs unless producers pay more - maybe $25,000 per day, instead of the current $15,000 to $19,000. That may depend on per-barrel prices going up, an unlikely prospect amid expanding supply.

Oil drillers, meanwhile, continue to hunt for new cost-cutting technologies - after already halving the cost of extracting a barrel since 2014.

Parsley is cutting labor costs with sensors on wells that transmit production and maintenance data to its headquarters in Austin, Texas. [nASA09N8C]

"We're constantly getting more efficient," Mark Timmons, Parsley's vice president of field operations.

The Lilis revival started last year with debt-for-equity swaps and a merger with another troubled oil producer, giving Lilis access to Permian acreage.

The company's market value has risen to $210 million from about $3 million two years ago.

At the company's newest well site, Lilis CEO Mirman checked drilling progress on his iPhone and shrugged off any worries about OPEC's next move.

"We're using every tool at our disposal to grow," he said.

{{20170516T220546.611+0000}}UPDATE 1-Exxon boosting Baton Rouge crude unit production -sources(Adds company no comment)

HOUSTON, May 16 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp's 502,500-barrel-per-day (bpd) Baton Rouge, Louisiana, refinery was ramping up production on its second largest crude distillation unit after restarting on Monday, sources familiar with plant operations said on Tuesday.

An Exxon spokeswoman declined on Tuesday to discuss operations at the Baton Rouge refinery.

The 110,000-bpd PSLA-9 CDU was shut on April 24 for a planned overhaul that included cleaning heater tubes on the unit. The work was originally scheduled to wrap up around May 7, but was extended for a week.

CORRECTED-UPDATE 3-Tillerson gives nod at Arctic meet to climate change action - 路透新闻

{{20170516T142731.467+0000}}CORRECTED-UPDATE 3-Tillerson gives nod at Arctic meet to climate change action(Corrects timing of debate about the agreement to show it took place before the meal, not after, in paragraph 7)

By Timothy Gardner

FAIRBANKS, Alaska, May 11 (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson signed an agreement recognizing the landmark Paris climate accord at a meeting of Arctic nations in Alaska on Thursday, but said President Donald Trump was not rushing to decide whether to leave or weaken U.S. commitments to the pact.

Trump's efforts to dilute U.S. climate policies have made the country an outlier on the issue and put Tillerson in an awkward position at a meeting of the Arctic Council.

The council meets every two years to tackle climate change and other problems facing the North. The Arctic is warming at a faster pace than any other part of the world, forcing native villagers on coasts and rivers in the region to move to higher ground as permafrost and glaciers melt and seas rise.

Global warming also puts stress on wildlife such as walruses and polar bears as they lose their habitat areas.

The Arctic agreement Tillerson signed with foreign ministers from the other seven nations of the council, including Russia, Canada and Norway, made only a passing reference to the Paris pact. It noted "entry into force" of the pact and its implementation and called for global action to reduce greenhouse gas pollution.

Still, Tillerson's signing of the document surprised a source close to the State Department. "We'd heard ... that there would likely be a significant U.S. effort to redline or even remove entirely the Paris and climate language," said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitive nature of the talks.

Tillerson signed the agreement at a dinner the council members ate together on Wednesday night after hours of debate before the meal, Denmark's Foreign Minister Anders Samuelsen told Reuters. The ministers stressed to Tillerson the business benefits, as well as the advantages to the environment and Arctic natives, of taking action on climate, Samuelsen said. Tillerson, a former chief executive of Exxon Mobil is one of Trump's advisers who supports staying in the agreement.

"He was happy about it; he seemed to be satisfied. We all were because it's a big step," Samuelsen said.

A local tribal leader also pressured Tillerson to act at a celebration of the council on Wednesday. "We the tribes ask you to listen to our land. It's telling us to implement promises to slow the change," Chairman Victor Joseph of the Tanana Chief Conference said before Tillerson was introduced at the celebration.

It was unclear how much influence the Arctic agreement, signed late on Wednesday and made public on Thursday, would influence Trump's decision.

Tillerson told the council the Trump administration was reviewing how it will approach climate change but was not going to rush to make a decision on Paris. "We are appreciative that each of you has an important point of view," said Tillerson. "We are going to make the right decision for the United States," said Tillerson.

Trump is expected to make a decision on Paris after a Group of Seven summit at the end of May.

Finland's Foreign Minister Timo Soini, whose country will chair the council for the next two years, praised U.S. leadership in the Arctic Council, but added that the Paris pact is an important tool in fighting climate change.

Arctic warming is thawing permafrost and melting sea ice, causing damage to infrastructure but also opening up new oil reserves, shipping routes and access to fisheries - intensifying a decades-long race for Arctic resources.

Adding pressure on Trump, scientists from the United States and other Arctic nations issued a report ahead of the meeting warning that the warming could lead to trillions of dollars worth of damage to buildings, roads and other infrastructure this century. [nL8N1HS53K].

The council also signed an agreement on sharing science and data on the Arctic, an effort led by Russia and the United States, and addressed Arctic search and rescue and communications.

Trump's administration has already reversed Obama-era bans on offshore drilling in certain parts of the Arctic, a turn that could intensify competition for resources in the region with major oil producer Russia.

Russia has beefed up its military presence in the Arctic to levels not seen since the fall of the Soviet Union, as global interest in the region's oil, gas and rare earth metals heats up. [nL5N1FG40N]

BREAKINGVIEWS-BHP should take Elliott's activism as a compliment - 路透新闻

{{20170516T113149.167+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-BHP should take Elliott's activism as a compliment(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.)

By Andy Critchlow

LONDON, May 16 (Reuters Breakingviews) - BHP may have a portfolio of assets that doesn't click together, but it's not the only miner in that situation. Rivals Rio Tinto , Anglo American and Glencore all have bits that don't quite fit in their armoury. So why has BHP been singled out by activist fund Elliott for a potential split? It's because BHP's petroleum business looks well suited to a spinoff, and the more BHP resists, the more attractive its oil wells become. The Anglo-Australian miner should see Elliott's campaign as a compliment.

Elliott – founded by billionaire Paul Singer – is like a dog with a bone, and is unlikely to stop chewing on BHP until the company takes its demands for a restructuring seriously. On Tuesday it renewed a public campaign first launched last month to harangue the mining group into demerging, restructuring and returning more of its cash directly to shareholders.

In its new manifesto for change Elliott has ditched a proposal for BHP to abandon its dual listing in London and Sydney, a move which anyway would be blocked by the government in Canberra. Instead, it has doubled down on its more plausible call to offload oil, which sits awkwardly amongst BHP's core iron ore, coal and copper mining activities. Its argument is simple. BHP has invested too much – $8 billion alone on petroleum exploration since 2002 that the fund says has produced almost no return. Were a serious bid to emerge – and the assets could be attractive for an oil major like BP or Exxon – BHP chief Andrew Mackenzie would have a tough job rebuffing it out of hand.

One reason to consider a split is because BHP's oil operations are actually worth investing in. According to Eikon data, petroleum generated a 52 percent EBITDA margin last year, double the margin achieved by Anglo American's incongruous diamond business, or Rio Tinto's division that makes aluminium – a metal that only incidentally involves mining. Instead of taking offence, BHP could accept Elliott's challenge, invite bidders for its oil business, and know that it is doing so from a position of strength.

CONTEXT NEWS

- Activist investor Elliott has returned with a new proposal to restructure BHP.

- The hedge fund said on May 16 that the mining giant can remain incorporated in Australia but must review its petroleum business.

- Elliott called on BHP on April 10 to restructure its current corporate structure, which consists of a UK and an Australian company, and spin off its petroleum unit.

- BHP consists of an Australian-listed company and a UK-listed company. They are separate legal entities with different investor bases, but are managed as if they were one.

UPDATE 1-Nigerian oil workers extend Exxon Mobil strike to Chevron, Agip and Shell - 路透新闻

{{20170516T070731.804+0000}}UPDATE 1-Nigerian oil workers extend Exxon Mobil strike to Chevron, Agip and Shell(Adds quote, details)

ONITSHA, Nigeria, May 16 (Reuters) - Nigerian workers from an oil labour union have extended a strike to oil majors Chevron , Shell and Eni subsidiary Agip in protest over the sacking of members from Exxon Mobil Corp , the union's general secretary said on Tuesday.

Nigerian labour unions have held a number of strikes in the last few months in protest at the sacking of workers by oil companies. Members of the Petroleum and Natural Gas Senior Staff Association of Nigeria (PENGASSAN) began a strike at Exxon Mobil last week. [nL8N1ID4TU] [nL5N1EZ3Y2]

PENGASSAN General Secretary Lumumba Okugbara said the union's 10,000 members were taking part in the three-day nationwide strike which began on Monday and would continue until Wednesday.

"Production activities are still on and our members on essential duties are working. Only those in administrative duties are not working in the various multi-national oil companies since yesterday," he said.

The strikes are in protest at the sacking of 150 workers in December, of which 82 were PENGASSAN members. Okugbara said union representatives would meet Exxon Mobil management on Tuesday for talks.

Strikes by Exxon workers in Nigeria at the end of last year did impact output, leading to weeks-long loading delays.

BREAKINGVIEWS-Investors may impose a climate change upon Exxon - 路透新闻

{{20170515T205953.874+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-Investors may impose a climate change upon Exxon(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are her own.)

By Lauren Silva Laughlin

DALLAS, May 15 (Reuters Breakingviews) - The shareholder climate appears to be changing at Exxon Mobil . The New York State Common Retirement Fund has put a proposal on the company's proxy urging it to increase disclosures about the risks climate change poses to its business. After a similar proposal passed last week at Occidental Petroleum , the $350 billion oil giant will find it hard to resist the tide.

The world's largest publicly traded oil company by market capitalization has paid fair lip service to the dangers of climate change. Chief Executive Darren Woods endorsed a carbon tax in his first blog post since taking over in February from Rex Tillerson. The firm's investor-relations chief conceded the risks were "serious" in a shareholder call last week. But Exxon insists current disclosures are adequate, hardly surprising given it continues to bet heavily on fossil fuels. It has invested $7 billion to develop lower-emission energy solutions over the past 15 years. That's just slightly more than it spent on an acquisition last quarter to buy land in the Permian Basin.

Meanwhile the world is headed in another direction. Nearly 200 countries pledged to take action under the Paris climate-change agreement of 2015. Though President Donald Trump has threatened to pull out from this agreement, many companies as well as city and state municipalities are stepping up efforts to increase their use of clean energy. Renewable energy increased nearly a third in the U.S. between 2010 and 2015, according to data from the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy.

Pension funds smartly want assurances that the world's largest oil company won't be left behind. The New York fund is calling for more disclosure around how a global push to clean energy is going to affect Exxon's business, including the value of its hefty oil and gas reserves.

A similar proposal by the New York fund fell short last year, garnering support from just 38 percent of shareholders. The recent vote at Occidental will make it hard for other Exxon shareholders to resist. The support of BlackRock , the third-largest shareholder at Exxon, effectively sealed that vote. So long as the changing climate can affect earnings, shareholders should demand more disclosure.

CONTEXT NEWS

- Proxy advisors Glass Lewis on May 6 recommended that shareholders at Exxon Mobil support a proposal calling on the company to publish an annual assessment of the long-term impact of climate-change policies and technological advances on its oil and gas reserves.

- The proposal was put forward by the New York State Common Retirement Fund and the Church Commissioners of England. On May 12, shareholders of Occidental Petroleum approved a proposal that would require the company to report the business impacts of climate change.

UPDATE 2-South Africa may award first shale gas exploration licences by end-Sept - 路透新闻

{{20170515T141255.065+0000}}UPDATE 2-South Africa may award first shale gas exploration licences by end-Sept* Environmentalists criticised Karoo exploration

* Exploration licences in Karoo valid for three years

* South Africa also pushing for more offshore activity

(Adds offshore quotes, recoverable resources)

By Wendell Roelf

JOHANNESBURG, May 15 (Reuters) - South Africa's government may award its first shale gas exploration licences by the end of September, after environmental objections delayed the process, a senior government official said on Monday.

The five licence applications under review are for exploration in the semi-arid Karoo basin.

Environmentalists criticised plans to work in the sparsely populated region, known for its rugged scenery and home to rare species such as the mountain zebra and riverine rabbit.

Royal Dutch Shell , Falcon Oil and Gas and Bundu Gas & Oil are among five firms whose applications were being reviewed by the regulator, acting Petroleum Agency SA (PASA) Chief Executive Lindiwe Mekwe told Reuters.

PASA would make recommendations to Mineral Resources Minister Mosebenzi Zwane to decide on the licence awards.

"We anticipate that the minister will be in a position to make a determination during the second or third quarter," Mekwe said.

"If the decision is made this year the exploration rights will be valid for a period of three years, exploration activities should commence within three years," she said.

South Africa is seeking to replace its dwindling offshore gas reserves and reduce reliance on coal to fuel power plants.

Shell said last year its Karoo project could compete in its global shale gas and oil portfolio provided commercial terms were attractive. It had previously pulled back from the plans due to low energy prices and licence delays. [nL5N16G4CZ]

South Africa's recoverable gas reserves from onshore shale and offshore gas fields was estimated in 2015 at about 19.5 trillion cubic feet (TCF). Officials say it would take about a decade to significantly develop these gas resources.

Mekwe said Total had applied to renew its offshore exploration licence, but was not expected to drill in the next two years as the French firm continued engineering work for a drill ship to deal with rough sea conditions.

Sasol , Exxonmobil and Impact had received an upgrade in their technical co-operation permits, which entitle holders to conduct desktop studies, to offshore exploration licences, she added.

Mekwe called for more opportunities for black citizens to enter the oil and gas industry, expected to expand once a Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Bill is finalised.

"PASA is indeed adding weight on black economic empowerment credentials," Mekwe said.

UPDATE 1-Chevron shuts first Gorgon LNG export plant unit for around a month - 路透新闻

{{20170515T114037.030+0000}}UPDATE 1-Chevron shuts first Gorgon LNG export plant unit for around a month(Adds background on past outages, future plant expansion plans)

By Oleg Vukmanovic

LONDON, May 15 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp has shut the first production line at its giant Gorgon liquefied natural gas (LNG) export plant in Australia and expects the outage to last about a month in order to replace a faulty device, a spokesman said on Monday.

"Production on Gorgon Train 1 was stopped on May 12 due to a failure of a flow measurement device," the company said in a statement.

"Train 1 is expected to be down approximately one month for this replacement and we will take this opportunity to perform other routine maintenance," it said.

Chevron has struggled to maintain stable production at the $54 billion project, which came on stream in March last year, following a string of unplanned shutdowns since then.

Gorgon's third production line started up in March 2017, bringing combined export capacity to 15.6 million tonnes.

On a conference call in April, Chevron Asia Pacific Exploration and Production president Stephen Green said work was carried out to address a reliability issue identified on Gorgon's first two production lines, or trains.

It is unclear if recurring production setbacks at Gorgon could hinder or delay Chevron's plans to bolster the efficiency of the plant and to lift production capacity through a process known as debottlenecking.

Chevron said trains 2 and 3 were running normally and the plant is continuing to ship cargoes.

Chevron holds a controlling stake of 47.3 percent in the project, while ExxonMobil and Shell each have a 25 percent stake. The remaining stakes are held by Osaka Gas <9532.T>, Tokyo Gas <9531.T> and JERA.

U.S. companies push hard for lower tax rate on offshore profits - 路透新闻

{{20170515T100001.886+0000}}U.S. companies push hard for lower tax rate on offshore profitsBy Ginger Gibson

WASHINGTON, May 15 (Reuters) - Major U.S. multinationals are pushing the Trump administration to deepen the tax break it has already tentatively proposed on $2.6 trillion in corporate profits being held offshore, a key piece in Washington's intricate tax reform puzzle.

As President Donald Trump tries to deliver on his campaign promise to overhaul the tax code, lobbyists for technology, drug and other manufacturers are working with officials behind closed doors, six lobbyists working with various industries told Reuters.

In line with tax cuts already embraced by Republicans in the House of Representatives, the lobbyists said they are telling the White House and Treasury Department that if companies are forced to bring home, or repatriate, foreign earnings, they want a sharply reduced tax rate.

The lobbyists are making an aggressive case that cutting the tax rate on offshore profits to 10 percent from 35 percent, as the administration has indicated it may favor, is not enough.

Rather, the lobbyists said they want a lower, bifurcated rate of 3.5 percent on earnings already invested abroad in illiquid assets, such as factories, and 8.75 percent on cash and liquid assets.

During the 2016 presidential campaign, Trump proposed setting the rate at 10 percent, and argued it could be used to raise tax revenue to pay for tax cuts or infrastructure.

Discussion of hard numbers in the long-running repatriation debate may indicate tax reform is advancing on Trump's slow-moving domestic policy agenda. Or it may just be lobbyists trying to set the early framework for a long slog ahead, which could be adjusted if they get concessions elsewhere.

"For us, it's how you create a tax environment where you give business long-term certainty," one lobbyist said.

The changes being discussed are part of larger tax reform, another lobbyist said: "Our international tax system is out of whack with the rest of the world. This system is not sustainable."

LATEST PUSH IN LONG CAMPAIGN

The lobbyists' demands represent the latest effort in a push by corporate America that has been under way since 2004-2005, the last time Washington let multinationals pay only a small fraction of the taxes due on their foreign profits.

Repatriation and comprehensive tax reform are important to the economy, Apple Inc CEO Tim Cook said earlier this month on CNBC. "The administration ... they're really getting this and want to bring this back and I hope that that comes to pass," he said. Apple held $239.6 billion of cash and securities offshore as of April 1.

Under current law, U.S.-based corporations are supposed to pay 35-percent income tax on profits worldwide. But companies can defer that tax on active profits left outside the country.

The deferral rule has incentivized multinationals to park profits offshore and about $2.6 trillion in earnings is being held overseas by more than 500 U.S. companies, according to Audit Analytics, a corporate research firm.

Nearly a third of that is held by 10 companies, including Apple, Microsoft Corp , Pfizer Inc and General Electric Co , the firm said. All four of those companies declined to comment.

These companies and hundreds of others could bring their foreign profits into the United States at any time, but they do not in order to avoid paying the 35-percent tax due.

If the $2.6 trillion overseas were repatriated at once, two things would happen. First, Washington would get a big jolt of tax revenue. Second, repatriated profits not collected by the Internal Revenue Service could be put to use in the economy.

As the law stands, tax-deferred profits can be held offshore indefinitely. The result of that has been companies biding their time, claiming their profits are "trapped" offshore while lobbying for a repatriation tax cut. The last time they got one was in 2004-2005 under former President George W. Bush, whose administration let multinationals voluntarily repatriate profits at a 5.25 percent tax rate.

At the time, Bush tried to extract promises from companies that they would dedicate repatriated funds to investments in new plants and other job-creating projects.

But in a 2011 follow-up study, a Senate committee concluded the Bush repatriation tax "holiday" cost the Treasury at least $3.3 billion in net revenue over 10 years and "produced no appreciable increase in U.S. jobs or domestic investment."

Rather, the repatriated funds largely went to shareholder dividends and executive bonuses, the committee said.

The repatriation tax break now being discussed differs from Bush's: repatriation would not be voluntary, but mandatory, so foreign profits would have to be brought home.

In addition, lobbyists said they have talked to the administration about ending deferral and exempting foreign profits from taxation. The administration has floated this as an option. Lobbyists said there has been discussion about limiting that exemption to 95 percent of repatriated foreign earnings.

UPDATE 2-BlackRock switch helps pass 'historic' climate measure at Occidental - 路透新闻

{{20170512T215536.401+0000}}UPDATE 2-BlackRock switch helps pass 'historic' climate measure at Occidental(Adds comment from proponent, details on BlackRock talks with Chevron)

By Ross Kerber

BOSTON, May 12 (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc said on Friday that it voted in favor of a successful shareholder proposal calling for more climate change reporting by Occidental Petroleum Corp , in the first sign the world's largest asset manager was backing up its tough new talk on environmental matters.

Backers of the resolution called its passage a major victory, the first time such a measure succeeded at a major U.S. oil and gas company. Proponents said they were pleased by BlackRock's support, which they had sought.

"Today's historic vote puts the oil and gas industry on notice – the climate is changing and so are investor expectations of how companies should respond," said Laura Campos, a director at the Nathan Cummings Foundation, one of the resolution's proponents.

BlackRock , which has $5.4 trillion under management, traditionally has given few details of its reasoning behind specific proxy votes. On Friday, however, it said it was concerned about Occidental's pace of disclosure to date. It also gave details about its talks with other companies such as Chevron Corp , which BlackRock said has provided more detail on climate risks it faces such as a recent report it published.

A Chevron representative said the company would continue speaking with investors, and that it had held "extensive dialogue with proponents and other stockholders."

BlackRock spokesman Ed Sweeney said BlackRock would not explain every vote it casts in such detail but wanted to underscore how it promotes its corporate governance priorities in talks with companies.

"We want to highlight our engagement and articulate our voting decisions," he said.

Occidental Chairman Eugene Batchelder said in an emailed statement: "We look forward to continuing our shareholder engagement on the topic and providing additional disclosure about the company's assessment and management of climate-related risks and opportunities."

Major oil companies have long faced shareholder criticism for being slow to respond to climate concerns, though some have moved to mend fences with activists in recent years such as ExxonMobil's decision earlier this year to name a environmental expert to its board.

Specifically, the resolution at Occidental - which was also backed by Wespath Investment Management and state pension funds including the California Public Employees' Retirement System - called on the energy company to explain the impact it could face from changes like new public policies on climate change, such as the 2016 Paris climate agreement.

BlackRock, Occidental's largest investor with about 8 percent of its shares, last year had opposed a similar resolution, which failed to get a majority of support from investors.

In a statement sent by Sweeney explaining the switch, the fund firm said its vote last year was meant to give Occidental time. But despite talks with Occidental, "we remain concerned about the lack of discernable improvements to the company's reporting practices" on climate issues, the statement said.

Last year a similar resolution was narrowly defeated with 249 million votes cast for it and 259 million votes cast against. The size of BlackRock's holdings suggested its switch helped give the proposal a majority of support this year. An Occidental spokesman said the company would provide details about the vote in coming days.

EXCLUSIVE-Cheniere in talks to boost LNG shipments to China - 路透新闻

{{20170512T203000.191+0000}}EXCLUSIVE-Cheniere in talks to boost LNG shipments to China(Adds context, closing stock prices)

By Ernest Scheyder and Scott DiSavino

HOUSTON/NEW YORK, May 12 (Reuters) - Cheniere Energy Inc said on Friday it has had extensive negotiations with China about increasing U.S. liquefied natural gas exports, as a new trade deal paves the way for a second wave of LNG investment in the world's fastest growing gas supplier.

The Trump Administration on Thursday said it reached an agreement with China to increase trade access for some U.S. companies to China, which is expected to include LNG exports. [nL1N1IE08B][nL1N1IE12X]

That should benefit several companies building LNG export terminals in the United States, as the U.S. is forecast to become the third largest LNG exporter by the end of next year.

Cheniere is currently the only company able to export large cargoes of LNG from the continental United States, giving it a leg up now to ink long-term contracts with China, the world's largest growth market for gas.

"We're heartened by this trade deal for its potential to increase Chinese access to American LNG," Cheniere spokesman Eben Burnham-Snyder told Reuters.

"We have had extensive negotiations with the Chinese over the last month," he said. Cheniere has also shipped LNG to 20 other countries around the globe, and is in talks to ship to more.

Shares of Cheniere jumped as much as 5 percent to $49.50 on Friday to their highest since February, and the stock has more than doubled since Cheniere's Sabine Pass terminal first opened in February 2016. Shares closed up 3.3 percent to $48.68.

Since the shale boom in the U.S. a decade ago, energy companies have been building export facilities, with as much as 6 billion cubic feet per day of capacity due by the end of 2018. [nL2N1H51YF]

"In the longer term, the deal paves the way for a second wave of investment in U.S. LNG," said Massimo Di-Odoardo, Head of global gas and LNG research at natural resources consultancy Wood Mackenzie.

"Developers will now be able to target Chinese buyers directly, potentially supporting project financing. It could also support direct Chinese investment into liquefaction and upstream developments on U.S. soil," he said.

Those companies include Dominion Resources Inc , Kinder Morgan Inc , Sempra Energy and Freeport LNG, which are building LNG export terminals, and Exxon Mobil Corp , Veresen Inc , Venture Global LNG and Tellurian Inc , which hope to build new export terminals. [nL1N1HX0PP]

Under the plan, which falls under the framework of the U.S.-China Comprehensive Economic Dialogue, Chinese companies can now negotiate long-term contracts to source LNG from U.S. suppliers, the U.S. Commerce Department said.

"We are happy for all support in moving forward with U.S. LNG exports...We view this announcement as a step forward in improving the balance of trade," said Joi Lecznar, a spokeswoman for Tellurian, which is developing the $13-$16 billion Driftwood LNG export facility in Louisiana, expected to enter service in 2022.

Until now, Chinese buyers have not bought long-term LNG supplies from the U.S. directly.

China, however, has bought U.S. LNG through short-term, or spot, deals. The only long-term contracts it has for U.S. LNG are with companies, like Royal Dutch Shell PLC , which themselves have agreements to buy gas from Cheniere's Sabine Pass or other U.S. export terminals.

Sabine Pass in Louisiana entered service in February 2016, making it the first and only big LNG export facility in the lower 48 U.S. states. The United States has been a net importer of natural gas for 60 years; that is expected to change in 2017 as a result of LNG exports.

China was the third biggest importer of U.S. LNG in 2016, having imported 17.2 billion cubic feet (bcf) on six vessels, according to federal energy data. For the first two months of 2017, China imported 30.9 bcf of gas on 10 tankers.

One billion cubic feet is enough gas for about five million U.S. homes.

By 2030, Wood Mackenzie projects Chinese LNG demand will reach 75 million tonnes per annum or 10 bcfd. That would be worth $26 billion a year at current prices ($7 per million British thermal units).

"The U.S. is keen for a slice of the pie," Di-Odoardo said, noting that U.S. LNG accounted for about 7 percent of total LNG imports into China in March.

The Trump Administration earlier announced plans to expedite the environmental permitting process for other new facilities, such as Veresen's Jordan Cove project on the Pacific Coast in Oregon. [nL1N1HT1FY]

BUZZ-ExxonMobil testing repaired Nigerian Qua Iboe crude pipeline - 路透新闻

{{20170512T151327.154+0000}}BUZZ-ExxonMobil testing repaired Nigerian Qua Iboe crude pipelineMay 12 (Reuters) -

* ExxonMobil is testing its main 48-inch Qua Iboe crude export pipeline after nearly of year of repairs following a shutdown in July last year, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters

* ExxonMobil resumed exports of the grade in October via an alternate smaller pipeline, but loadings were unreliable and more limited

* Once testing is complete, the resumption of the larger line could enable an increase in exports to around 12 cargoes, from the current 7-10 cargoes per month of 950,000 barrels each, sources said. Exxon declined to comment

* Exports had also been dogged by delays following strike action that in December [nL5N1H848E]

* Workers initiated another strike this week but Exxon said that production was so far unaffected [nL8N1IE5C2]

YENAGOA, Nigeria, May 12 (Reuters) - A Nigerian oil labour union and Exxon Mobil Corp plan to meet with government officials in an effort to end a strike over the sacking of workers, a union and government official said on Friday.

Workers at Exxon Mobil went on strike this week to protest against the sacking of 150 staff in December. Nigerian labour unions have held a number of similar strikes in the past few months. [nL5N1EZ3Y2] [nL8N1CW90V]

"There are arrangements for both parties to meet early next week with the federal government," said Chika Onuegbu, who chairs the Petroleum and Natural Gas Senior Staff Association of Nigeria (PENGASSAN) in the oil-producing Rivers State.

He said the strike was continuing.

A government official said the labour minister would convene a meeting to resolve the conflict, without giving detials.

A spokesman for Exxon Mobil declined to comment on the possibility of a meeting with the government, adding that the strike had "no impacts" on oil production.

"We respect the rights of our workforce and will continue to engage with them to resolve this situation, but remain committed to the safety of our personnel and security of our facilities," he said.

Government officials were not immediately available.

Strikes by Exxon workers in Nigeria at the end of 2016 did affect oil output, leading to weeks-long loading delays.

RPT-Total's plans for Brazil's new oil frontier snagged on Amazon reef - 路透新闻

{{20170512T110002.265+0000}}RPT-Total's plans for Brazil's new oil frontier snagged on Amazon reef(Repeats for additional clients with no changes to text)

By Marta Nogueira

OIAPOQUE, Brazil, May 12 - Deep beneath the waters of the Atlantic off Brazil's most northern coast, French major Total SA is hunting for what it hopes will be Latin America's next big oil discovery.

Metal drill bits, pipes and containers filled with equipment sit in the tropical port of Belém, near the mouth of the vast Amazon River, ready to sink the first exploratory wells 120 km (75 miles) offshore.

Some geologists say the area, known as the Foz do Amazonas Basin, may contain as many as 14 billion barrels of petroleum, more than the entire proven reserves of Mexico.

But another underwater discovery threatens to derail Total's plans: a massive system of coral reefs just 28 kilometers from where the French firm and its partners, Britain's BP PLC and Brazilian state oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA, plan to drill.

Brazilian scientists had suspected since the 1970s that the area might be home to a sizeable reef. But the unusual depth of this formation - reaching more than 100 meters (400 ft) - coupled with the Amazon silt clouding the waters, delayed that confirmation until just five years ago, just as the government was putting drilling leases out for tender.

Environmentalists, led by campaigner Greenpeace, are now pressuring regulators to block oil exploration in the area. They believe the thriving reef system, which is more 1,000 kilometers long and dotted with brightly colored coral and giant sponges, may be home to new marine species.

Scientists fear an oil spill could damage this treasure before it has even been studied. Leaked crude from Foz do Amazonas wells could also potentially wreak havoc on Brazil's far north Amapá state, home to the world's largest belt of mangroves and thousands of square miles of virgin rainforest, says environmental scientist Valdenira Ferreira.

"In terms of environmentally sensitive environments, this is the biggest in Brazil," said Ferreira, a researcher at the Institute for Scientific Research of Amapá, who is helping prepare a study for the nation's Environment Ministry.

Total says it is scrupulously complying with all requirements by Brazilian authorities and is taking every precaution to ensure that drilling would be safe.

The dispute highlights pressures facing Brazil to protect its unique environmental patrimony as its tries to foment jobs and economic growth for its citizens.

It is also reviving concerns that Brazil, which ranks among the Western hemisphere's least open economies, remains a difficult place to do business despite a new conservative government's efforts to cut red tape and woo foreign investment as it seeks to drag the economy out of the worst downturn since the Great Depression.

Four years after Total and its partners paid 622 million reais ($196 million) for five exploration blocks, they are still waiting for the go-ahead from Brazil's environmental regulator, Ibama.

The agency has given no indication as to when it will make a ruling.

"It's an area that is very sensitive. We're concerned about everything there," said Alexandre Souza, environmental analyst for Ibama.

The delay has Total's Chief Executive in Brazil, Maxime Rabilloud, suggesting the company might sit out three offshore oil license rounds that Brazil has scheduled for this year.

He said Total had already invested some 200 million reais ($64 million) in developing its fields in Foz do Amazonas, with no guarantee yet that it will be able to proceed.

"It's complicated to ask for more money to enter into more exploration blocks without clarity about when the earlier blocks can be evaluated to see if they have any oil," he said in his office in Rio de Janeiro in March.

Such uncertainty could prove damaging for Brazil in a year when oil companies have 25 auctions to choose from around the world, says Antonio Guimaraes, executive secretary of exploration and production at the Brazilian Petroleum Institute (IBP), an industry group.

He has urged President Michel Temer's government to speed passage of legislation currently pending in Congress that would make it easier for companies to win environmental licenses, an effort that has alarmed environmentalists.

DEEPSEA DRILLING

Deep-water discoveries during the 2000s off the coast of Rio de Janeiro in an area known as the pre-salt made Brazil one of the oil sector's hottest destinations, prompting then-president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva to declare "God is Brazilian".

The announcement of the massive Libra offshore prospect in 2010 – the world's biggest in decades - heightened the excitement around the area.

Today, the pre-salt region accounts for almost half of Brazil's oil production, and is rising fast. Success there has piqued interest in other offshore regions of Brazil, including Foz de Amazonas.

The basin was the most hotly disputed area of Brazil's 2013 oil auction. In addition to Total and BP, Brazil's OGX and Queiroz Galvão Exploration and Production (QGEP) secured blocks in the area.

Helping fuel optimism was a May 2015 offshore discovery by ExxonMobil in nearby Guyana in an area with similar geology.

"I would say in terms of the opening of a new frontier in Brazil, the Amazon Basin is a strong candidate," said geologist Pedro Zalan, who did exploration work for Petrobras in the area.

Total, which said it hopes to receive a decision from Ibama this year, plans to drill nine exploratory wells at water depths of more than 1,900 meters.

Environmentalists say such extreme depths bring greater risks, making it harder to plug and contain any spill. BP's 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill, the worst in U.S. waters, was from a deep-water well of similar depth.

In a 64-page document submitted to Ibama, reviewed by Reuters, Total said the environmental risks were fully understood.

"We are very aware of the sensitivity of the ecosystems," Rabilloud said. He said the company was using a well design that has been used in similar conditions in French Guiana without any incidents.

In the event of an accident, Rabilloud said an emergency response could be activated within two hours.

In contrast to findings by Ferreira, the environmental researcher in Amapá, Total has concluded that ocean currents would carry any pollution away from the coast of Brazil.

Rabilloud expressed confidence in receiving a green light from Ibama but said the uncertainty over the delay made operations difficult.

"Right now, Total is ready to invest," he said. "Now, if you ask me when I will get the license, I can't tell you."

FISHING AND UNEMPLOYMENT

President Temer's government has proposed plans to simplify environmental licensing and hand companies a greater say in a bid to avoid lengthy delays.

The Ibama environmental agency has also seen its budget slashed as the government scrambles to curb a massive deficit.

Packed with members of the farming and business lobby, the government has been accused of downplaying environmental damage, including rising levels of deforestation.

The government denies neglecting environmental rules or planning to dilute them. It says, however, its top priority is creating jobs and bringing an end to Brazil's harshest recession in decades.

In Amapá, the Brazilian state with the highest rate of unemployment last year, many residents are eager for potential benefits from the oil industry.

However, in the remote town of Oiapoque near the border of French Guiana, many suspect that will pass them by.

Fishermen in the poor town fear the oil industry may instead hurt their livelihoods.

"If we have an oil spill here, the fish will die and what will the fisherman do," said Rodolfo Antonio Ferreira da Silva, 63, who has fished for nearly 50 years, casting his net into the river.

For Adair Jeanjaque, a member of the Kalina indigenous people, the oil venture smacks of colonialism.

"It will be the same as when the Portuguese came here and took everything without any benefit," Jeanjaque said in his village on the outskirts of Oiapoque. ($1 = 1.7910 marka) ($1 = 3.1740 reais) ($1 = 3.1497 reais)

ANALYSIS-China, India plans for electric cars threaten to cut gasoline demand - 路透新闻

{{20170512T034501.612+0000}}ANALYSIS-China, India plans for electric cars threaten to cut gasoline demand* China and India prepare for radical policy shifts

* Rise of electric vehicles to hit gasoline demand

* IEA says it will review its demand forecasts

* Moody's warns of "significant credit risk" for oil industry

* Oil demand from petrochemicals, heavy industry to remain strong

By Seng Li Peng and Florence Tan

SINGAPORE/KUALA LUMPUR, May 12 (Reuters) - Demand for gasoline in Asia may peak much earlier than expected as millions of people in China and India buy electric vehicles over the next decade, threatening wrenching change for the oil industry, oil and auto company executives warned.

They said refiners should prepare for a future in which gasoline, their biggest source of revenue, will be much less of a cash cow.

Change is being prompted by policy moves in India and China, where governments are trying to rein in rampant pollution, cut oil imports, and compete for a slice of the fast-growing green car market.

In its "road map", released in April, China said it wants alternative fuel vehicles to account for at least one-fifth of the 35 million annual vehicle sales projected by 2025. [nL4N1HX1HS]

India is considering even more radical action, with an influential government think-tank drafting plans in support of electrifying all vehicles in the country by 2032, according to government and industry sources interviewed by Reuters late last week. [nL4N1I8080]

"We will see a clear shift to electric cars. It's driven by legislation so electric cars are coming, it's not a niche anymore," Wilco Stark, vice president for strategy and product planning at German car maker Daimler , told Reuters.

Stark and other executives were interviewed during the Asia Oil & Gas Conference in Kuala Lumpur this week.

Daimler sees electric vehicles contributing 15-20 percent of its overall sales by 2025 and at least an additional 10 percent of sales coming from hybrids, he said.

Electric cars currently make up less than 2 percent of the global car fleet, and any faster-than-expected growth in that percentage will materially impact oil demand and the refining business.

"Technology is moving fast. In 10-15 years... our gasoline market might not be the same as it is today," said Dawood Nassif, board director at the state-owned oil company Bahrain Petroleum Company (BAPCO).

With gasoline responsible for up to 45 percent of refinery output, and one of the highest profit-margin fuels, a slowdown or fall in demand will have far reaching implications.

Credit agency Moody's says that the fast pace of technological development makes accurate predictions difficult, but warned that direct financial effects from falling oil demand, including gasoline, "could be material by the 2020s." [nL8N1HZ24U]

The changes are so big that the influential International Energy Agency (IEA) plans to revisit its analysis of electric vehicle trends and oil demand.

"The choices made by China and India are obviously most relevant for the possible future peak in passenger car oil demand," an IEA spokesman told Reuters.

In its current policies scenario, last updated in November 2016, the IEA still expects oil demand from vehicle use to rise until 2040. [nL8N1DH3M6]

It's not just China and India that are changing fast.

Asia's major car makers, Japan and South Korea, already sell significant volumes of hybrid vehicles - which operate off gasoline and electricity - while fuel efficiency gains will continue to cut gasoline consumption for standard vehicles. [nL3N1H71GT]

There will, though, be some major hurdles before a country like India goes mostly electric. High battery costs would push up car prices and a lack of charging stations and other infrastructure in India means car makers may hesitate to make the necessary investment in the technology.

NEED TO ADAPT

Asia has long been the main driver of future oil demand thanks to supercharged growth in sales of autos.

China sells more than 2 million new cars a month and is challenging the United States as the world's biggest oil consumer. India now is the world's third-biggest oil importer, ahead of Japan.

More than a third of the world's refineries are in Asia, up from just 18 percent in 1990.

For refiners, the growth of vehicles that run on electricity and other alternative fuels is a wake-up call. They can tweak the products they make from crude oil to an extent, but still mostly rely on gasoline consumption for revenue.

"Rising pressure on margins and cash flows will potentially lead to stranded assets," Moody's warned, using a term for assets that no longer provide an economic return because of changes in the market or regulatory environment.

The oil industry is taking note.

Royal Dutch Shell said this week that it "is looking into ... the potential to introduce electric vehicle charging points at our retail sites in several countries."

Oil executives say it is still premature to expect overall oil demand to fall soon.

"Our industry will not disappear," said Abdulaziz al Judaimi, senior vice president for downstream at Saudi Aramco, the world's biggest oil export company.

They are envisaging a shift towards producing more petrochemicals like plastics or household chemicals, areas where consumption is soaring. [nL4N1DG248]

Saudi Aramco is jointly developing the huge Malaysian RAPID refinery and petrochemical complex with state-owned Petronas, and the two said this week they are exploring an expansion of its petrochemical capacity. [nL4N1IA3WR]

Exxon Mobil this week said it would buy a petrochemical plant in Singapore. [nL4N1ID1R0]

Refiners also still see strong oil demand from heavy industry.

"Refiners may shift their focus from gasoline to middle distillates," said KY Lin of Taiwan's Formosa Petrochemical <6505.TW>, a major Asian refiner. "Gasoil is used widely, including in farming/industrial equipment... and also as a marine fuel."

USA-Les valeurs à suivre à Wall Street - 路透新闻

{{20170511T122544.637+0000}}USA-Les valeurs à suivre à Wall Street(Actualisé avec Macy's)

NEW YORK, 11 mai (Reuters) - Principales valeurs à suivre jeudi à Wall Street, où les contrats à terme suggèrent une ouverture en baisse de 0,2% à 0,3%:

* SNAP propriétaire de Snapchat, perdait 22,5% dans les premières transactions en avant-Bourse jeudi, revenant pratiquement à son prix d'introduction de 17 dollars, après l'annonce d'un chiffre d'affaires trimestriel inférieur aux attentes et d'un ralentissement de la hausse du nombre de ses utilisateurs. Plusieurs intermédiaires ont abaissé leur objectif de cours. [nL8N1IC95Q]

* MACY'S chute de plus de 7% dans les transactions en avant-Bourse après la publication des résultats trimestriels, inférieurs aux attentes et qui montrent une baisse de 5,2% des ventes à magasins comparables. Le groupe de grands magasins a néanmoins confirmé ses prévisions pour l'ensemble de l'exercice fiscal.

* STRAIGHT PATH COMMUNICATIONS a annoncé jeudi avoir 7accepté une offre de rachat de VERIZON COMMUNICATIONS sur la base d'une valeur d'entreprise d'environ 3,1 milliards de dollars (2,85 milliards d'euros). Le prix de l'offre (184 dollars par action) est inférieur au cours de clôture de mercredi, l'action Straight Path ayant vu son cours pratiquement quintupler depuis début avril et les premières déclarations sur la possibilité d'un rachat.

* T-MOBILE US participera très probablement à d'éventuelles discussions de fusions aux Etats-Unis en s'appuyant sur sa position solide sur ce marché, a déclaré jeudi sa maison mère allemande, Deutsche Telekom . [nL8N1ID3Z9]

* LIBERTY GLOBAL - Le président du groupe, John Malone, s'est déclaré ouvert à des accords avec Vodafone et ITV à condition que les valorisations soient appropriées, dans un entretien au Financial Times.

* TEVA PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRIES a publié jeudi un bénéfice trimestriel supérieur aux attentes, soutenu par l'intégration d'Actavis, la filiale de médicaments génériques d'Allergan rachetée pour 40,5 milliards de dollars en août dernier. [nL8N1ID5YI]

* KOHL'S a publié jeudi un bénéfice trimestriel supérieur aux attente, soutenu par la réduction des coûts et des stocks, mais ses ventes à données comparables ont reculé pour le cinquième trimestre consécutif et sont inférieures aux estimations des analystes.

* TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY FOX a annoncé mercredi soir un chiffre d'affaires trimestriel en hausse moins marquée que prévu, le groupe de médias contrôlé par Rupert Murdoch ayant souffert d'une stagnation des revenus publicitaires aux Etats-Unis dans ses activités câble et d'un nombre réduit de succès commerciaux dans les salles de cinéma. En après-Bourse, l'action perdait près de 4%.

* SYMANTEC a fait état d'un chiffre d'affaires du quatrième trimestre 2016-2017 et de prévisions pour l'exercice en cours inférieurs aux attentes, ce qui se traduisait par un recul de près de 5% de l'action du spécialiste de la cybersécurité en après-Bourse.

* WHOLE FOODS MARKET a annoncé mercredi après la clôture des marchés américains la nomination d'un nouveau directeur financier et de cinq administrateurs indépendants sans lien avec le fonds activiste Jana Partners. Le titre gagnait plus de 2% dans les transactions hors séance.

* PAREXEL INTERNATIONAL - Le fonds activiste Starboard Value a fait état d'une prise de participation de 5,7% dans Parexel en jugeant le titre "sous-évalué". Des sources avaient déclaré lundi à Reuters que Parexel, un spécialiste des services à l'industrie pharmaceutique, envisageait de se vendre.

* EXXON MOBIL a annoncé jeudi avoir conclu le rachat d'un site de raffinage et de pétrochimie de Jurong Aromatics à Singapour. Un journal sud-coréen avait rapporté en mars qu'Exxon Mobil était favori sur ce dossier avec une offre d'environ 1,7 milliard de dollars.

* AMERICAN INTERNATIONAL GROUP - L'assureur s'apprête à nommer Brian Duperreault, actuel dirigeant d'Hamilton Insurance Group, au poste de directeur général en remplacement de Peter Hancock, rapporte jeudi le Wall Street Journal, en citant des sources proches du dossier. AIG s'est refusé à tout commentaire.

BUZZ-ExxonMobil: BofA Merrill upgrades to 'buy' on improving margins - 路透新闻

{{20170511T121432.672+0000}}BUZZ-ExxonMobil: BofA Merrill upgrades to 'buy' on improving margins** Exxon's rating upgraded to buy from neutral by BofA Merrill, price objective raised by $5 to $100, a 22 pct upside to current levels

** Upgrade comes two weeks after Exxon reported better-than-expected Q1 profit, helped by rising crude prices and cost cuts

** XOM's strong Q1 cash flow suggests its E&P margins have finally improved, BofA Merrill analysts say, adding that projects lined up through recent acquisitions will add to momentum

** XOM "stands as a more attractive dividend play versus European peers," analysts say; co last month hiked quarterly dividend by 2 cents to 77 cents a share

UPDATE 2-Oil workers go on strike at Exxon Mobil in Nigeria -union - 路透新闻

{{20170511T120157.366+0000}}UPDATE 2-Oil workers go on strike at Exxon Mobil in Nigeria -union(Adds oil traders)

LAGOS, May 11 (Reuters) - Nigerian workers at U.S. oil major Exxon Mobil Corp have gone on strike in protest over the sacking of workers, oil labour union officials said on Thursday.

Nigerian labour unions have criticised oil companies for sacking workers in the last few months and held a number of strikes. [nL5N1EZ3Y2] [nL8N1CW90V]

Abel Agarin, who chairs the Lagos zone of the Petroleum and Natural Gas Senior Staff Association of Nigeria (PENGASSAN), said members of his union were on strike in protest at the sacking of 150 workers in December. He said 82 were PENGASSAN members.

"We want them to be brought back and if that is not possible we want a proper severance package for them," said Agarin, who led around 50 protesters in the commercial capital.

PENGASSAN said strikes were being held in Lagos, Bonny, Akwa Ibom and Port Harcourt.

A spokesman for Exxon Mobil said by email that there were "no impacts" on oil production.

Two oil traders said it was too early to say whether the strikes would have an impact on production.

Strikes by Exxon workers in Nigeria at the end of 2016 did impact output, leading to weeks-long loading delays.

{{20170511T113625.135+0000}}Wall Street-Stocks to watch dell'11 maggio11 maggio (Reuters) - I futures sugli indici azionari statunitensi sono in calo, dopo che ieri la borsa Usa ha chiuso contrastata, con gli investitori che hanno "digerito" una serie di trimestrali deboli e il lincenziamento dal parte del presidente Donald Trump del capo dell'Fbi.

Ieri il Dow Jones <.DJI> ha chiuso in calo dello 0,16%, in crescita invece l'S&P 500 <.SPX> e il Nasdaq <.IXIC>, saliti rispettivamente dello 0,11% e dello 0,14%.

RPT-Trump's climate stance looms over Arctic meeting - 路透新闻

{{20170511T110001.092+0000}}RPT-Trump's climate stance looms over Arctic meeting(Repeats story with no changes)

By Timothy Gardner

FAIRBANKS, Alaska, May 11 (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson will host foreign ministers from Arctic nations at a summit in Alaska on Thursday, where President Donald Trump's reluctance to fight climate change will likely cast a shadow over talks.

The Arctic Council, which includes the United States, Russia, Canada and five other countries, meets every two years to tackle problems in the region, which is warming at a faster pace than any other part of the world.

Unlike former President Barack Obama, Trump has expressed doubts about whether human activity has a significant role in climate change, and is mulling whether to pull the United States out of a global pact to fight it.

He is expected to decide whether Washington will leave the 2015 Paris Agreement, or stay in with reduced commitments, after a Group of Seven summit at the end of this month.

Canada and the Nordic countries have stressed the importance of staying in the Paris agreement, setting them up for a potential clash with the United States over language in a final agreement to be reached at the conclusion of Thursday's meeting.

It is of "decisive importance that the United States remains part" of the Paris agreement, Norway's Foreign Minister Borge Brende told Reuters this week in Norway.

Arctic warming is thawing permafrost and melting sea ice, causing damage to infrastructure but also opening up new oil reserves, shipping routes and access to fisheries - intensifying a decades-long race for Arctic resources.

This year's agenda will highlight sharing science on climate-related issues, and also address Arctic search and rescue and communications.

Adding pressure on the Trump administration, scientists from the United States and other Arctic nations issued a report ahead of the meeting that the impacts of warming in the region could lead to trillions of dollars worth of damage to buildings, roads and other infrastructure this century. [nL8N1HS53K].

Following the meeting, Tillerson, the former chief executive of energy giant Exxon Mobil , will hand over the chairmanship of the council to Finland, which plans to stress the Paris pact as it leads the council over the next two years.

Trump's administration has also reversed Obama-era bans on offshore drilling in certain parts of the Arctic, a turn that could intensify competition for resources in the region with major oil producer Russia.

Russia has beefed up its military presence in the Arctic to levels not seen since the fall of the Soviet Union, as global interest in the region's oil, gas and rare earth metals heats up. [nL5N1FG40N]

UPDATE 1-Exxon Mobil buys Singapore petrochemical plant, boosts output in Asia - 路透新闻

{{20170511T041849.465+0000}}UPDATE 1-Exxon Mobil buys Singapore petrochemical plant, boosts output in Asia* Transaction to be completed in H2 2017

* Lifts Exxon's Singapore aromatics output above 3.5 mln T/year

(Adds quote, details on Jurong Aromatics plant)

By Florence Tan

SINGAPORE, May 11 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp said on Thursday it has reached an agreement to buy a refining and petrochemical plant owned by Jurong Aromatics (JAC) in Singapore that will boost its output and meet demand in Asia.

The company expects to complete the transaction in the second half of 2017, boosting its aromatics production in Singapore to more than 3.5 million tonnes per year (tpy), including 1.8 million tpy of paraxylene, a raw material for textiles and bottles.

The plant will be integrated with Exxon Mobil's existing petroleum complex on Jurong Island, said Gan Seow Kee, chairman and managing director of ExxonMobil Asia Pacific Pte Ltd.

Singapore houses Exxon Mobil's largest refining-petrochemical complex with a crude oil processing capacity of 592,000 barrels per day and two steam crackers.

The Korea Herald reported in March that Exxon Mobil had outbid Lotte Chemical Corp <011170.KS> with a price of 2 trillion won or about $1.7 billion for the JAC plant.

Exxon's spokeswoman said it is not the company's practice to discuss details of its commercial transactions.

JAC's condensate splitter and petrochemical units - at a construction cost of $2.4 billion - started operations in Asia in 2014 to produce paraxylene to meet demand from textile and bottle manufacturers in China.

JAC's debt mounted, though, as commodities went into freefall in the middle of that year, and it stopped operations at end-2014 to fix a technical issue. Its lender BNP Paribas appointed accounting firm Borelli Walsh as the receiver and manager of JAC.

The JAC plant resumed operations in July 2016 under tolling agreements with BP and Glencore . [nL4N1A02J6]

{{20170511T120157.366+0000}}UPDATE 2-Oil workers go on strike at Exxon Mobil in Nigeria -union(Adds oil traders)

LAGOS, May 11 (Reuters) - Nigerian workers at U.S. oil major Exxon Mobil Corp have gone on strike in protest over the sacking of workers, oil labour union officials said on Thursday.

Nigerian labour unions have criticised oil companies for sacking workers in the last few months and held a number of strikes. [nL5N1EZ3Y2] [nL8N1CW90V]

Abel Agarin, who chairs the Lagos zone of the Petroleum and Natural Gas Senior Staff Association of Nigeria (PENGASSAN), said members of his union were on strike in protest at the sacking of 150 workers in December. He said 82 were PENGASSAN members.

"We want them to be brought back and if that is not possible we want a proper severance package for them," said Agarin, who led around 50 protesters in the commercial capital.

PENGASSAN said strikes were being held in Lagos, Bonny, Akwa Ibom and Port Harcourt.

A spokesman for Exxon Mobil said by email that there were "no impacts" on oil production.

Two oil traders said it was too early to say whether the strikes would have an impact on production.

Strikes by Exxon workers in Nigeria at the end of 2016 did impact output, leading to weeks-long loading delays.

Wall Street-Stocks to watch dell'11 maggio - 路透新闻

{{20170511T113625.135+0000}}Wall Street-Stocks to watch dell'11 maggio11 maggio (Reuters) - I futures sugli indici azionari statunitensi sono in calo, dopo che ieri la borsa Usa ha chiuso contrastata, con gli investitori che hanno "digerito" una serie di trimestrali deboli e il lincenziamento dal parte del presidente Donald Trump del capo dell'Fbi.

Ieri il Dow Jones <.DJI> ha chiuso in calo dello 0,16%, in crescita invece l'S&P 500 <.SPX> e il Nasdaq <.IXIC>, saliti rispettivamente dello 0,11% e dello 0,14%.

Oggi il calendario macro prevede i prezzi alla produzione di aprile e le nuove richieste settimanali dei sussidi di disoccupazione (alle 14,30 italiane). Sul fronte corporate sono in agenda i risultati di Macy's e Nordstrom.

Intorno alle 13,30 italiane il futures e-minis sullo S&P 500 cede lo 0,15%, quello sul Nasdaq lo 0,2% e quello sul Dow Jones <1YMc1> lo 0,09%.

Sul mercato obbligazionario il benchmark decennale sale 4/32 e rende il 2,39%, il trentennale di 6/32 con un rendimento del 3,03%.

Tra i titoli in evidenza oggi:

**SNAP , propriterario di Snapchat, cede il 22,5% nel pre-borsa, dopo l'annuncio di un giro di affari trimestrale inferiore alle attese e di un rallentamento del numero di utenti. Diverse agenzie hanno abbassato il loro target.

**T-MOBILE US parteciperà molto probabilmente a eventuali colloqui di fusione negli Usa, dove la sua posizione solida sul mercato gli darà il tempo di trovare la miglior occasione, ha annunciato oggi la casa madre Deutsche Telekom .

**LIBERTY GLOBAL - Il presidente del gruppo, John Malone, si è detto aperto ad accordi con Vodafone e ITV a condizione che le valorizzazioni siano appropriate.

**TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY FOX ha annunciato ieri sera un giro d'affari trimestrale in rialzo meno marcato del previsto. Il gruppo media controllato da Rupert Murdoch ha sofferto di una stagnazione dei ricavi pubblicitari negli Usa nelle attività via cavo e di un numero ridotto di successi commerciali nelle sale cinematografiche.

**SYMANTEC ha registrato ricavi del quarto trimestre 2016-2017 e previsioni per l'esercizio in corso inferiori alle attese.

**WHOLE FOODS MARKET ha annunciato ieri sera dopo la chiusura dei mercati Usa la nomina di un nuovo direttore finanziario e di cinque amministratori indipendenti non legati ai fondi Jana Partners.

RPT-Trump's climate stance looms over Arctic meeting - 路透新闻

{{20170511T110001.092+0000}}RPT-Trump's climate stance looms over Arctic meeting(Repeats story with no changes)

By Timothy Gardner

FAIRBANKS, Alaska, May 11 (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson will host foreign ministers from Arctic nations at a summit in Alaska on Thursday, where President Donald Trump's reluctance to fight climate change will likely cast a shadow over talks.

The Arctic Council, which includes the United States, Russia, Canada and five other countries, meets every two years to tackle problems in the region, which is warming at a faster pace than any other part of the world.

Unlike former President Barack Obama, Trump has expressed doubts about whether human activity has a significant role in climate change, and is mulling whether to pull the United States out of a global pact to fight it.

He is expected to decide whether Washington will leave the 2015 Paris Agreement, or stay in with reduced commitments, after a Group of Seven summit at the end of this month.

Canada and the Nordic countries have stressed the importance of staying in the Paris agreement, setting them up for a potential clash with the United States over language in a final agreement to be reached at the conclusion of Thursday's meeting.

It is of "decisive importance that the United States remains part" of the Paris agreement, Norway's Foreign Minister Borge Brende told Reuters this week in Norway.

Arctic warming is thawing permafrost and melting sea ice, causing damage to infrastructure but also opening up new oil reserves, shipping routes and access to fisheries - intensifying a decades-long race for Arctic resources.

This year's agenda will highlight sharing science on climate-related issues, and also address Arctic search and rescue and communications.

Adding pressure on the Trump administration, scientists from the United States and other Arctic nations issued a report ahead of the meeting that the impacts of warming in the region could lead to trillions of dollars worth of damage to buildings, roads and other infrastructure this century. [nL8N1HS53K].

Following the meeting, Tillerson, the former chief executive of energy giant Exxon Mobil , will hand over the chairmanship of the council to Finland, which plans to stress the Paris pact as it leads the council over the next two years.

Trump's administration has also reversed Obama-era bans on offshore drilling in certain parts of the Arctic, a turn that could intensify competition for resources in the region with major oil producer Russia.

Russia has beefed up its military presence in the Arctic to levels not seen since the fall of the Soviet Union, as global interest in the region's oil, gas and rare earth metals heats up. [nL5N1FG40N]

UPDATE 1-Exxon Mobil buys Singapore petrochemical plant, boosts output in Asia - 路透新闻

{{20170511T041849.465+0000}}UPDATE 1-Exxon Mobil buys Singapore petrochemical plant, boosts output in Asia* Transaction to be completed in H2 2017

* Lifts Exxon's Singapore aromatics output above 3.5 mln T/year

(Adds quote, details on Jurong Aromatics plant)

By Florence Tan

SINGAPORE, May 11 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp said on Thursday it has reached an agreement to buy a refining and petrochemical plant owned by Jurong Aromatics (JAC) in Singapore that will boost its output and meet demand in Asia.

The company expects to complete the transaction in the second half of 2017, boosting its aromatics production in Singapore to more than 3.5 million tonnes per year (tpy), including 1.8 million tpy of paraxylene, a raw material for textiles and bottles.

The plant will be integrated with Exxon Mobil's existing petroleum complex on Jurong Island, said Gan Seow Kee, chairman and managing director of ExxonMobil Asia Pacific Pte Ltd.

Singapore houses Exxon Mobil's largest refining-petrochemical complex with a crude oil processing capacity of 592,000 barrels per day and two steam crackers.

The Korea Herald reported in March that Exxon Mobil had outbid Lotte Chemical Corp <011170.KS> with a price of 2 trillion won or about $1.7 billion for the JAC plant.

Exxon's spokeswoman said it is not the company's practice to discuss details of its commercial transactions.

JAC's condensate splitter and petrochemical units - at a construction cost of $2.4 billion - started operations in Asia in 2014 to produce paraxylene to meet demand from textile and bottle manufacturers in China.

JAC's debt mounted, though, as commodities went into freefall in the middle of that year, and it stopped operations at end-2014 to fix a technical issue. Its lender BNP Paribas appointed accounting firm Borelli Walsh as the receiver and manager of JAC.

The JAC plant resumed operations in July 2016 under tolling agreements with BP and Glencore . [nL4N1A02J6]

Jones Act tanker used to transport oil from Alaska's North Slope to retire -operator - 路透新闻

{{20170508T214541.047+0000}}Jones Act tanker used to transport oil from Alaska's North Slope to retire -operatorHOUSTON, May 8 (Reuters) - The Alaskan Frontier, a Suezmax tanker typically used to transport Alaskan North Slope crude to West Coast refineries, is scheduled to retire, according to vessel operator Alaska Tanker Company.

The U.S.-flagged vessel is one of a few that comply with the Jones Act, a maritime law that requires shipments between U.S. ports to take place on U.S.-built and manned vessels.

A source, who requested anonymity, said the ship would be retired in June, but the company did not confirm the timing.

The Alaska Tanker Company fleet is time chartered to transport BP Plc's Alaska North Slope production. The fleet operator has also moved Alaskan crude for producers Exxon Mobil Corp and ConocoPhillips .

UPDATE 1-Exxon extends work at Baton Rouge crude unit -sources - 路透新闻

{{20170505T195805.612+0000}}UPDATE 1-Exxon extends work at Baton Rouge crude unit -sources(Adds company no comment)

HOUSTON, May 5 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp's 502,500 barrel per day (bpd) Baton Rouge, Louisiana, refinery is extending a planned overhaul on the second largest crude distillation unit by at least a week, Gulf Coast market sources said on Friday.

The work on the 110,000 bpd PSLA-9 CDU could finish as early as May 14. Exxon is also overhauling the 32,000 bpd West Coker, which is expected to remain shut until the work finishes in late May, the sources said.

A company spokeswoman declined to discuss operations at the Baton Rouge refinery, but said Exxon continues to meet its contractual obligations.

PSLA-9 is the second-largest of the four CDUs at the Baton Rouge refinery. The other three crude units remain in operation.

CDUs do the primary refining of oil coming into a refinery, breaking down the crude into feed for all other units.

The West Coker is one of three coking units, which squeeze refinable material from residual crude and convert the remainder to petroleum coke, a coal substitute.

Total and Erg get four bids for Italy petrol stations -sources - 路透新闻

{{20170505T123858.528+0000}}Total and Erg get four bids for Italy petrol stations -sourcesBy Giancarlo Navach and Stephen Jewkes

MILAN, May 5 (Reuters) - Total and energy group Erg have received four bids for the Italian petrol station network they jointly own, three sources close to the matter said.

The bidders, which include Italian refiner API Anonima Petroli [APIHDA.UL], have asked for additional information, two of the sources said, adding that details on how the sale will be structured would likely be announced by the end of May.

Bidding closed at the end of April.

France's Total and Italy's Erg jointly control TotalErg which operates close to 2,600 service stations in Italy with a market share of around 11 percent.

But the joint venture also holds other assets including a quarter of Italian refinery Sarpom, controlled by ExxonMobil's Esso unit, which is proving a stumbling block.

"The sale has not been wrapped up yet because the bidders have asked more questions," one of the sources said, adding it was not clear if the assets would be sold as a single block or would be broken up.

TotalErg, 51 percent owned by Erg, has appointed HSBC and Rothschild to sell a business which sources have said could be worth more than 600 million euros ($657 million).

A person close to the deal said that in addition to API the bidders included a foreign industrial player and private equity firms.

Italian financial daily Il Sole 24 Ore reported this week that Terra Firma, TRC Capital, and Glencore had made bids.

Another source said API, which already owns 2,600 stations of its own, was in talks with private equity group Advent to back its bid but added clinching a deal had been tough.

"It's not clear if Advent is still on board," the source said.

A deal with API would create Italy's biggest service station operator, ahead of Eni and Kuwait Petroleum International which last year bought a network from Royal Dutch Shell .

API, Erg and Advent declined to comment.

($1 = 0.9127 euros)

RPT-Pemex seeks investors for its refineries, but who's buying? - 路透新闻

{{20170505T110001.992+0000}}RPT-Pemex seeks investors for its refineries, but who's buying?(Repeating for additional clients with no changes to text.)

By Jessica Resnick-Ault and David Alire Garcia

NEW YORK/MEXICO CITY, May 5 (Reuters) - Sweeping energy reforms have turned Mexico into one of the world's most attractive offshore prospects, but one segment is getting no love from U.S. investors: the nation's aging refineries.

Efforts by Mexico's state-owned oil company Pemex to attract about $5 billion in capital to help modernize its two largest refineries so far have proved futile, according to two people familiar with the process who declined to be named because they were not authorized to speak publicly.

The company is seeking a joint venture partner for its Salina Cruz refinery on the West Coast. It's also looking for an investor to complete construction of a coking unit to process heavy crude at its Tula refinery just north of Mexico's capital.

Among those to rebuff overtures from Pemex over the past year are U.S. refining giants Valero Energy Corp and Tesoro Corp , the people said.

Valero and Tesoro declined to comment. Those and other companies were deterred by operational, political and market concerns, the people said.

Pemex officials said they "categorically reject" the notion that they are struggling to find investors.

"There has been interest," a company spokesman said Thursday. "We've had talks with many companies whose names we can't reveal."

Pemex has said publicly it's seeking investment from Korean, Japanese and Chinese firms. The company hired Bank of America last year to seek potential partners.

The refining sector has contributed buckets of red ink to Pemex's bottom line. Its six domestic refineries have accumulated annual operating losses of about $5 billion in recent years. Government-set fuel prices, a spate of accidents and other non-scheduled stoppages have cut deeply into margins.

For years, Pemex prioritized investment in profitable drilling projects, neglecting other areas. As a result, refineries built decades ago to process light, sweet crude from Mexico's shallower waters can't efficiently process heavy oil from fields currently in production.

The upshot: Today Mexico imports more than 60 percent of its refined gasoline and diesel from the United States, while its own refineries operate at about half capacity.

The mismatch would seem a prime business opportunity. Instead Pemex's refineries have become a virtual third rail for investors.

Some potential partners are leery of the sums needed to bring the aging facilities up to standard, people familiar with the situation said. Then there's the bloated refinery workforce whose jobs are protected by a strong union. On average, Pemex uses about 3,000 full-time workers to operate each refinery. That's triple the number found at U.S. facilities with similar sized operations, according to figures from Pemex and U.S. refiners.

"The refineries aren't competitive. Their product slate doesn't meet the demand of the country," said Dave Hackett, an energy consultant at Stillwater Associates in California.

Pemex's refineries could be the biggest challenge yet for Jose Antonio Gonzalez Anaya, who was brought in as chief executive last year to lure investment to Mexico's most important company. The oil giant has struggled in recent years with slumping production, falling oil prices and rising debt.

Gonzalez Anaya, a polished, American-educated technocrat, has scored some early wins. He oversaw cost cuts of more $5 billion last year and has hustled to attract exploration and production partnerships; the first one covering a deep water Gulf block was inked in February between Pemex, U.S. oil major Chevron and Japan's Inpex <1605.T>.

On Wednesday, Pemex reported its first quarterly profit in five years, gaining some $4.7 billion during the January-March period.

Overall, the outlook is bullish for Mexico's oil industry. Reforms to Mexico's constitution four years ago ended Pemex's nearly 80-year monopoly and allowed the government-controlled company to form its first-ever equity partnerships. The changes also permitted private oil companies to operate fields on their own. Major oil companies including Exxon Mobil Corp , Total SA and Statoil have snagged offshore leases at auction.

Overhauling Mexico's refining sector, however, has proven daunting. Unlike offshore production, where new rigs can be brought in and operators can largely call their own shots, the refineries come with baggage. Potential investors must contend with the existing infrastructure, much of it dating back to the 1970s. Then there are entrenched relationships with local government officials and union leaders.

Lowering a massive coking drum into place during an event at the Tula facility last month, Pemex chief Gonzalez Anaya was accompanied, not by foreign investors, but by Carlos Romero Deschamps, head of the powerful oil workers union and a senator with the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, of President Enrique Pena Nieto.

If refinery investors "are forced to follow exactly how Pemex has worked in the past, obviously no one will enter," said Carlos Petersen, an analyst covering Latin America for Eurasia Group.

Mexico's political climate is another concern. By law, Pena Nieto, who led the oil reform, is limited to a single six-year term that ends next year. The government's decision to open its oil industry to outside producers and sell off some Pemex assets was vehemently opposed by many Mexicans and left-leaning politicians. Among them is Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, a populist who's the current front-runner for the 2018 presidential race.

In the meantime, Pemex is moving forward - alone - to finance some of its refining needs. Badly in need of more capacity to process heavy crude, Pemex broke ground in 2013 on the coker project at its Tula refinery.

The company will fund half the $2.2-billion cost for the first phase while it seeks partners to help complete the facility, Pemex's top downstream executive Carlos Murrieta told analysts on a conference call earlier this week. He put the final price tag at $4.5 billion and projected the plant would be ready in 2022.

Houston oil analyst Jake Fuller is dubious that other new Pemex refinery projects will follow anytime soon.

"It would be a monumental shift," said Fuller, downstream expert at IHS.

Pemex seeks investors for its refineries, but who's buying? - 路透新闻

{{20170505T050002.041+0000}}Pemex seeks investors for its refineries, but who's buying?By Jessica Resnick-Ault and David Alire Garcia

NEW YORK/MEXICO CITY, May 5 (Reuters) - Sweeping energy reforms have turned Mexico into one of the world's most attractive offshore prospects, but one segment is getting no love from U.S. investors: the nation's aging refineries.

Efforts by Mexico's state-owned oil company Pemex to attract about $5 billion in capital to help modernize its two largest refineries so far have proved futile, according to two people familiar with the process who declined to be named because they were not authorized to speak publicly.

The company is seeking a joint venture partner for its Salina Cruz refinery on the West Coast. It's also looking for an investor to complete construction of a coking unit to process heavy crude at its Tula refinery just north of Mexico's capital.

Among those to rebuff overtures from Pemex over the past year are U.S. refining giants Valero Energy Corp and Tesoro Corp , the people said.

Valero and Tesoro declined to comment. Those and other companies were deterred by operational, political and market concerns, the people said.

Pemex officials said they "categorically reject" the notion that they are struggling to find investors.

"There has been interest," a company spokesman said Thursday. "We've had talks with many companies whose names we can't reveal."

Pemex has said publicly it's seeking investment from Korean, Japanese and Chinese firms. The company hired Bank of America last year to seek potential partners.

The refining sector has contributed buckets of red ink to Pemex's bottom line. Its six domestic refineries have accumulated annual operating losses of about $5 billion in recent years. Government-set fuel prices, a spate of accidents and other non-scheduled stoppages have cut deeply into margins.

For years, Pemex prioritized investment in profitable drilling projects, neglecting other areas. As a result, refineries built decades ago to process light, sweet crude from Mexico's shallower waters can't efficiently process heavy oil from fields currently in production.

The upshot: Today Mexico imports more than 60 percent of its refined gasoline and diesel from the United States, while its own refineries operate at about half capacity.

The mismatch would seem a prime business opportunity. Instead Pemex's refineries have become a virtual third rail for investors.

Some potential partners are leery of the sums needed to bring the aging facilities up to standard, people familiar with the situation said. Then there's the bloated refinery workforce whose jobs are protected by a strong union. On average, Pemex uses about 3,000 full-time workers to operate each refinery. That's triple the number found at U.S. facilities with similar sized operations, according to figures from Pemex and U.S. refiners.

"The refineries aren't competitive. Their product slate doesn't meet the demand of the country," said Dave Hackett, an energy consultant at Stillwater Associates in California.

Pemex's refineries could be the biggest challenge yet for Jose Antonio Gonzalez Anaya, who was brought in as chief executive last year to lure investment to Mexico's most important company. The oil giant has struggled in recent years with slumping production, falling oil prices and rising debt.

Gonzalez Anaya, a polished, American-educated technocrat, has scored some early wins. He oversaw cost cuts of more $5 billion last year and has hustled to attract exploration and production partnerships; the first one covering a deep water Gulf block was inked in February between Pemex, U.S. oil major Chevron and Japan's Inpex <1605.T>.

On Wednesday, Pemex reported its first quarterly profit in five years, gaining some $4.7 billion during the January-March period.

Overall, the outlook is bullish for Mexico's oil industry. Reforms to Mexico's constitution four years ago ended Pemex's nearly 80-year monopoly and allowed the government-controlled company to form its first-ever equity partnerships. The changes also permitted private oil companies to operate fields on their own. Major oil companies including Exxon Mobil Corp , Total SA and Statoil have snagged offshore leases at auction.

Overhauling Mexico's refining sector, however, has proven daunting. Unlike offshore production, where new rigs can be brought in and operators can largely call their own shots, the refineries come with baggage. Potential investors must contend with the existing infrastructure, much of it dating back to the 1970s. Then there are entrenched relationships with local government officials and union leaders.

Lowering a massive coking drum into place during an event at the Tula facility last month, Pemex chief Gonzalez Anaya was accompanied, not by foreign investors, but by Carlos Romero Deschamps, head of the powerful oil workers union and a senator with the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, of President Enrique Pena Nieto.

If refinery investors "are forced to follow exactly how Pemex has worked in the past, obviously no one will enter," said Carlos Petersen, an analyst covering Latin America for Eurasia Group.

Mexico's political climate is another concern. By law, Pena Nieto, who led the oil reform, is limited to a single six-year term that ends next year. The government's decision to open its oil industry to outside producers and sell off some Pemex assets was vehemently opposed by many Mexicans and left-leaning politicians. Among them is Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, a populist who's the current front-runner for the 2018 presidential race.

In the meantime, Pemex is moving forward - alone - to finance some of its refining needs. Badly in need of more capacity to process heavy crude, Pemex broke ground in 2013 on the coker project at its Tula refinery.

The company will fund half the $2.2-billion cost for the first phase while it seeks partners to help complete the facility, Pemex's top downstream executive Carlos Murrieta told analysts on a conference call earlier this week. He put the final price tag at $4.5 billion and projected the plant would be ready in 2022.

Houston oil analyst Jake Fuller is dubious that other new Pemex refinery projects will follow anytime soon.

"It would be a monumental shift," said Fuller, downstream expert at IHS.

Statoil-Les résultats du T1 supérieurs aux attentes - 路透新闻

{{20170504T065707.363+0000}}Statoil-Les résultats du T1 supérieurs aux attentesOSLO, 4 mai (Reuters) - La compagnie pétrolière norvégienne Statoil a publié jeudi des résultats au titre du premier trimestre sensiblement meilleurs qu'attendu, à la faveur d'une hausse des prix du pétrole et de sa production.

Ses résultats sont conformes à la tendance observée chez les autres grands groupes pétroliers mondiaux, comme Royal Dutch Shell , BP , ExxonMobil , Chevron et Total , qui ont également annoncé des bénéfices plus élevés que prévu.

"Des prix plus élevés, une robuste performance opérationnelle et une croissance organique de la production de 5% ont contribué à notre solide résultat financier et à une forte génération de trésorerie sur tous les segments (de nos activités)", a déclaré le groupe dans un communiqué.

Le bénéfice d'exploitation ajusté est ressorti à 3,3 milliards de dollars (3 milliards d'euros) au premier trimestre 2017, contre 857 millions il y a un an. Les analystes anticipaient 2,67 milliards de dollars.

La trésorerie générée par les activités opérationnelles a plus que doublé à 5,97 milliards de dollars pour les trois premiers mois 2017, contre 2,2 milliards il y a un an. Les résultats des activités internationales sont également positifs.

La production trimestrielle a représenté 2,146 millions de barils équivalent par jour, celle du plateau continental norvégien atteignant son plus fort niveau depuis cinq ans.

Le groupe a également confirmé ses objectifs annuels et a maintenu un dividende de 0,2201 dollar par action au titre du premier trimestre.

FACTBOX-U.S. Chemical Safety Board conclusions in Torrance blast probe - 路透新闻

{{20170503T194049.240+0000}}FACTBOX-U.S. Chemical Safety Board conclusions in Torrance blast probeMay 3 (Reuters) - The U.S. Chemical Safety Board has wrapped up a two-year investigation of a Feb. 18, 2015, explosion at a Torrance, California, refinery then owned by Exxon Mobil Corp . It found that weaknesses in Exxon Mobil's process safety management program led to the explosion, which caused minor injuries to four workers and spiked West Coast gasoline prices. [nL1N1I425P]

EXPLOSION

The blast occurred when volatile hydrocarbons flowed backwards in an idled gasoline-producing fluidic catalytic cracking unit (FCCU) to the electrostatic precipitator, which releases sparks as it collects catalyst particles from escaping through the unit's exhaust stack.

WEAKNESSES

"These weaknesses led to operation of the FCC unit without pre-established safe operating limits and criteria for unit shutdown, reliance on safeguards that could not be verified, the degradation of a safety-critical safeguard, and the re-use of a previous procedure deviation without a sufficient hazard analysis that confirmed that the assumed process conditions were still valid," the CSB said in its report.

NEAR MISS

The board also found debris from the ESP nearly struck alkylation unit settler tanks containing toxic hydrofluoric acid, which can be deadly at 30 parts per million. The CSB has asked a federal court to enforce subpoenas against Exxon so the board can read information the company withheld about steps taken to prevent hydrofluoric acid releases or to mitigate them.

UNITS

FCCU: A fluidic catalytic cracking unit converts gas oil to gasoline and diesel using a catalyst under high heat and pressure.

Alkylation unit: An alkylation unit uses an acid catalyst to convert low-octane refining byproducts into high-octane components used in gasoline. Hydrofluoric acid is the most commonly used acid in U.S. refinery alkylation units.

ESP: An electrostatic precipitator uses electricity to collect catalyst from the exhaust stack of FCCUs in compliance with environmental rules.

EXXON STATEMENT

"Exxon Mobil deeply regrets the Feb. 18, 2015 incident at the Torrance refinery. We are thankful that no one was seriously hurt and wish to express our appreciation to city officials and community partners, the Torrance Fire Department and the Torrance Police Department for their dedication in ensuring the safety of the community.

"We are confident that we understand the cause of the Feb. 18 incident and have worked cooperatively with the Chemical Safety Board and staff to fully understand their findings and recommendations to improve the safety of our operations.

"During the course of the investigation, there was no evidence the Feb. 18 incident posed any risk to the modified hydrofluoric acid alkylation unit or risk of harm to the community. There was no loss of containment in the alkylation unit, it was neither associated with nor damaged in the Feb. 18 incident, and all safety systems and procedures operated as designed.

"In terms of safety, Exxon Mobil meets or exceeds accepted industry practices (API 751) and has stringent safety measures in place to mitigate risks associated with the modified hydrofluoric acid alkylation process. We employ multiple industry leading systems designed to detect a release of modified hydrofluoric acid and effectively mitigate and contain such a release, should one occur."

OPPOSITION California residents have pushed local and state leaders to ban the use of hydrofluoric acid in the state's refineries.

AGENCY

The U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board is tasked with finding the root causes of chemical plant fires and explosions. It has no regulatory or enforcement authority and only issues reports on the results of its investigations, which include recommendations to companies, regulators and industry associations.

UPDATE 2-Weak safety standards led to Exxon refinery blast - U.S. agency - 路透新闻

{{20170503T193354.963+0000}}UPDATE 2-Weak safety standards led to Exxon refinery blast - U.S. agency(Adds comments from Exxon, CSB conference call)

By Erwin Seba and Liz Hampton

HOUSTON, May 3 (Reuters) - The U.S. Chemical Safety Board (CSB) has concluded that a 2015 explosion at a Torrance, California, refinery then owned by Exxon Mobil Corp could have been prevented, the agency concluded in a report issued on Wednesday.

"This explosion and near miss should not have happened," said CSB Chair Vanessa Allen Sutherland in a statement. "The CSB's report concludes the unit was operating without proper procedures."

The federal watchdog found that weaknesses in the Torrance refinery's safety program led to the blast. [nL1N1I507I]

The blast blew a large piece of debris 80 feet (24.38 m) to nearby alkylation unit settler tanks containing toxic hydrofluoric acid, which the board called a "near-miss event."

Four workers suffered minor injuries and part of the refinery underwent a lengthy shutdown, contributing to a spike in the state's gasoline prices.

The Torrance refinery supplies 20 percent of the gasoline in Southern California and 10 percent statewide.

The explosion occurred when volatile hydrocarbons flowed backward through an idled gasoline-producing fluidic catalytic cracking unit (FCCU) to a pollution control device called an electrostatic precipitator (ESP), the CSB found.

The generation of sparks by the ESP ignited the hydrocarbons setting off the explosion.

The board, which has no regulatory authority and does not assess fines, found that the FCCU was operating without pre-established limits for a shutdown.

The agency also said Exxon relied on safeguards that it could not be sure were working and that a critical safeguard failed.

Exxon said in a statement: "We are confident we understand the cause of the blast and have worked cooperatively with the Chemical Safety Board and staff to fully understand their findings and recommendations."

Regarding the hydrofluoric acid, Exxon said, "There was no evidence the Feb. 18 incident posed any risk to the modified hydrofluoric acid alkylation unit or risk of harm to the community."

Residents near the refinery want local and state officials to ban the use of hydrofluoric acid in making octane-boosting gasoline additives.

Hydrofluoric acid is a highly toxic chemical that can kill or seriously injure at a concentration of 30 parts per million. As a gas it forms a ground-hugging cloud.

The board said it has asked a federal court to enforce subpoenas requiring Exxon to provide information about safeguards to prevent or mitigate a release of hydrofluoric acid.

Exxon said it "strongly disagrees" with any statement questioning its responsiveness or cooperation with the investigation.

"We offered to make additional documents available if the CSB could provide a sufficient basis for the documents and agreed to respect commercial confidentiality, which they have not done," a spokesman said Wednesday.

PBF Energy Inc , which acquired the refinery last year, "has already implemented a number of measures that address the CSB's recommendations," PBF spokesman Michael Karlovich said in a statement. "We plan to complete two studies later this year that will address the remaining recommendations."

The CSB determines root causes of chemical plant accidents and provides recommendations to companies, industry organizations and regulatory agencies.

NATO urges global fight against climate change as Trump mulls Paris accord  - 路透新闻

{{20170503T185742.765+0000}}NATO urges global fight against climate change as Trump mulls Paris accord By Timothy Gardner

NORFOLK, Va., May 3 (Reuters) - Climate change poses a global security threat that all countries must fight together, a NATO general said on Wednesday, as U.S. President Donald Trump nears a decision on whether to pull out of the Paris climate deal.

The comments were the strongest yet from the U.S.-European military alliance about the importance of upholding the Paris accord. They come amid lingering tensions between the leadership of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and Trump, who at one point called NATO "obsolete".

"There is a huge necessity that the U.N. continues to involve all nations and coordinate the action of all nations," to fight climate change, General Denis Mercier, NATO's supreme allied commander for transformation, told Reuters on the sidelines of a conference in Norfolk, Virginia.

"If one nation, especially the biggest nation ... if they do not recognize a problem, then we will have trouble dealing with the causes," of climate change, said Mercier.

Though he did not single out any country by name, the United States is the world's biggest economy and the second largest emitter of greenhouse gases after China.

Trump, a Republican, is weighing whether the United States should stay in the Paris climate agreement, a deal struck by nearly 200 countries in 2015 to limit global warming by reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and to provide funds to poor countries dealing with the effects of climate change. [L8N1I56C4]

Trump has complained that the United States was treated unfairly in the agreement because it would pay more than other countries to fight global warming. He is expected to decide in the next week or two on whether the country will leave the pact, or stay in with reduced commitments. [nW1N1GA00N]

His Democratic predecessor, former President Barack Obama, had pledged a 26 percent to 28 percent cut in U.S. greenhouse gas emissions from 2005 levels, by 2025.

NATO's duty when it comes to climate change is to try to predict its impacts on geopolitical stability, said Mercier, who is French. He said risks include rising seas, water scarcity and the opening of access to resources in the Arctic - all of which he said are likely to bring about new conflicts that could involve the 28 NATO countries.

A global effort to stem climate change could help the world avoid some of these crises and conflicts, he said.

"It's not too late, but it is time," he added.

Norfolk, home to the world's largest naval base, already faces severe risks from rising sea levels. The main road to U.S. Naval Station Norfolk has experienced chronic flooding, and electric and water utilities supporting the base are threatened every time the waters rise.

"In some circles many public policy makers do not want to use (the words) global warming or climate change, but the reality is we are experiencing it, Norfolk Mayor Kenneth Alexander told reporters on the sidelines of the conference.

U.S. greenhouse gas emissions have fallen recently due to a switch from coal to natural gas and renewables in generating electricity. But many climate experts fear that if Washington leaves the Paris accord, or adjusts down its commitments, other countries could follow suit and global emissions could surge.

Many companies including ExxonMobil Corp , Microsoft Corp , and Arch Coal Inc , have urged the United States to stay in the Paris agreement, in part to retain their global competitiveness.

Nigeria's crude oil exports to slide in June - loading plans - 路透新闻

{{20170503T163816.942+0000}}Nigeria's crude oil exports to slide in June - loading plansLONDON, May 3 (Reuters) - Nigeria's crude oil exports are
set to slip to 1.52 million barrels per day (bpd) in June,
according to loading programmes compiled by Reuters on Tuesday.

The programme for the month is down from a revised schedule
of 1.63 million bpd in May. Three of the June cargoes of Qua
Iboe, the largest Nigerian stream, were deferred from May.

Operator ExxonMobil has reissued the Qua Iboe plan several
times in the past two months due to persistent, but unexplained,
loading delays, and there are now seven cargoes planned for each
of May and June. [nL5N1H451F] [nL5N1H848E] [nL5N1FL5VW]

Planned June exports are just below Angola's schedule of
1.67 million bpd. Nigeria had consistently been Africa's largest
oil exporter, but its loadings have fallen below those of Angola
several times over the past year as it had to deal with militant
attacks on oil infrastructure in the Niger Delta.

Nigeria will also export four cargoes of Akpo condensate in
June, the same figure as in May.

TABLE-First Bakken oil cargo to Asia exported - 路透新闻

{{20170502T205217.066+0000}}TABLE-First Bakken oil cargo to Asia exportedMay 2 (Reuters) - The first-ever reported export of North Dakota's crude oil to Asia left port last month,
according to documents seen by Reuters.

Swiss-based Mercuria Energy Trading S.A. loaded more than 600,000 barrels of Bakken crude, as well as some Mars
Sour crude and DSW crude, in late March off the coast of Louisiana onto the very large crude carrier (VLCC) Maran
Canopus, destined for Singapore, according to the bill of lading and ship tracking data.

The Maran Canopus supertanker took oil in a ship-to-ship transfer from smaller Aframax vessels on five
different occasions, according to the data.

At least two Asian refiners told Reuters they are interested in Bakken light crude because of the products it
can yield through refining.

For the first three quarters of 2016 exports, see: [nL1N1EZ155]

* So viele neue Projekte 2017 geplant wie noch nie

* BP: Ölpreis dürfte dieses Jahr in etwa stabil bleiben

(neu: Details zum Ölpreis, Hintergrund)

London, 02. Mai (Reuters) - BP wird angesichts des wieder steigenden Ölpreises mutiger. Der britische Konzern will 2017 acht neue Förderprojekte starten, so viele wie noch nie in einem Jahr, unter anderem in Aserbaidschan und dem Oman. Die Produktion kletterte zuletzt bereits auf den höchsten Wert seit fünf Jahren. Dadurch verdreifachte sich der Gewinn im ersten Quartal 2017 auf 1,5 Milliarden Dollar, wie BP am Dienstag mitteilte. Dazu trug auch der jüngste Sparkurs mit Stellenstreichungen und gekürzten Investitionen bei.

Die gesamte Branche profitiert derzeit vom Ölpreis, der im vergangenen Jahr um 50 Prozent auf rund 54 Dollar pro Fass im ersten Quartal gestiegen ist. BP kalkuliert 2017 im Schnitt mit einer Spanne zwischen 50 und 55 Dollar. BP-Finanzchef Brian Gilvary sagte Reuters, sollten wichtige Förderländer und das Ölkartell Opec ihre Produktionskürzungen ins zweite Halbjahr ausdehnen, sei das obere Ende der Spanne durchaus realistisch. Vor drei Jahren kostete ein Fass Öl (159 Liter) aber noch über 100 Dollar. Das riesige Überangebot hat den Preis dann einbrechen lassen.

Zuletzt hatten schon viele BP-Konkurrenten mit verbesserten Zahlen geglänzt. Der größte börsennotierte Öl-Multi Exxon erzielte zu Jahresanfang ein mehr als doppelt so hohes Quartalsergebnis, Chevron schrieb nach einem Verlust im Vorjahr wieder schwarze Zahlen in Milliardenhöhe und Total kündigte nach einem Gewinnsprung zum ersten Mal seit 2014 wieder ein Großprojekt an.[nL8N1HZ2JC][nL8N1I05TX]

An der Londoner Börse kam die BP-Bilanz gut an. Die Aktie legte um 2,4 Prozent zu und war damit größter Gewinner im britischen Leitindex FTSE 100<.FTSE>. Investoren waren im Februar noch aufgeschreckt als BP zum Jahresende 2016 zwar den Überschuss verdoppelte, aber hinter den Erwartungen der Analysten zurückblieb. Diesmal übertraf BP die Prognosen des Marktes. Allerdings stieg wegen Zukäufen und Altlasten im Zusammenhang mit der Ölkatastrophe im Golf von Mexiko auch die Verschuldung um neun Prozent auf 38,6 Milliarden Dollar an.
