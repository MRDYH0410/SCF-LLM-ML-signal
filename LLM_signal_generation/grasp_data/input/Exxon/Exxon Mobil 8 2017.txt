MEXICO CITY, Aug 31 (Reuters) - Trade negotiators plan to take small steps forward in a second round of talks to rework the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) this weekend, trying to ignore daily threats from U.S. President Donald Trump to tear it up if he does not get his way.

Trump has used Twitter, press conferences and speeches to attack NAFTA in recent days, a ploy Mexican and Canadian officials regard as a negotiating strategy to wring concessions, but which has heightened uncertainty over the accord.

"Hopefully we can renegotiate it, but if we can't, we'll terminate it and we'll start all over again with a real deal," Trump told cheering workers at a factory in Missouri on Wednesday, as Mexico's foreign and trade ministers met their U.S. counterparts in Washington to keep relations on track.

Away from the diplomatic noise, trade experts from the three NAFTA nations hope to advance the revamp during the five days of talks in Mexico that start on Friday by working through areas of greater consensus before turning to trickier issues.

"We want to see positive signs of progress at the negotiating tables," said Moises Kalach, head of the international negotiating arm of Mexico's CCE business lobby, which is leading the private sector in the talks. "Hopefully we'll get it, even if it doesn't have to be stated publicly. Hopefully we'll start getting closure on some issues."

Overall, the Mexican round, which follows talks two weeks ago in Washington, is expected to define more clearly the priorities of each nation rather than yield major breakthroughs.

The emergence of detailed positions on the tougher points looks less likely in this round, officials said.

Kalach and one Mexican negotiator, who spoke on condition of anonymity, saw broad agreement between the NAFTA members on how to improve conditions for small businesses, as well as in salvaging elements of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade accord that Trump ditched after taking office.

Some consensus was forged between the three countries when the TPP was finalized in 2015 on issues including the environment, anti-corruption, labor rules and digital trade.

More divisive issues that could enter the talks range from exploring the scope to raise NAFTA content requirements for autos to the contested U.S. demand to scrap the so-called Chapter 19 dispute settlement mechanism for resolving complaints about illegal subsidies and dumping, officials say.

A key plank of the U.S. strategy is how to reduce its trade deficit with Mexico, which has sent negotiators scrambling for creative ways to rebalance trade, Kalach said.

One hope is that Mexico's incipient oil and gas sector opening will result in more imports and infrastructure investment from U.S. companies, some of which have already entered the market, such as Exxon Mobil Corp and Chevron Corp.

Folding that reform into NAFTA in a way that would make any attempt to unwind it politically costly for a future Mexican government would give U.S. and Canadian investors more security, Kalach and the Mexican negotiator said.

The risk the reform will stall has preoccupied officials in the region because the current front-runner for Mexico's July 2018 presidential election, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, opposed the opening of the energy industry.

"The best thing (the United States and Canada) can do is protect NAFTA because this essentially protects their investments," said Kalach.

THROWING WORDS ABOUT

Trump has accused Mexico and Canada of being "very difficult", and officials from both countries say his words come as little surprise given his confrontational negotiating style.

Still, Mexico's government has touted a back-up plan, seeing a "high risk" that NAFTA could unravel.[nL2N1LF14H]

Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Tuesday shrugged off the threats and Canadian officials close to the process said they remained fully focused on the talks.

"There are always going to be words thrown about here and there but ... we will continue to work seriously and respectfully to improve NAFTA to benefit not just Canadians but our American and Mexican friends as well," Trudeau said.

A spokeswoman for U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) Robert Lighthizer declined to comment directly on how Trump's comments would affect the talks. However, trade experts say they are unlikely to foster a spirit of cooperation.

"I think his tweets and statements are just complicating what's already a difficult negotiation," said Wendy Cutler, a former deputy USTR and lead U.S. negotiator for the TPP.

"I think it will embolden the naysayers in Canada and Mexico who don't want to move in certain areas by telling the negotiators, 'don't move on these issues because the president has already said he probably won't sign off on this deal'".

Houston mayor pushes U.S. government to quickly approve Harvey aid - Reuters News

{{20170830T181114.615+0000}}Houston mayor pushes U.S. government to quickly approve Harvey aidHOUSTON, Aug 30 (Reuters) - Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner pushed the U.S. government on Wednesday to quickly approve funds for Tropical Storm Harvey relief efforts and clear any regulatory hurdles to recovery.

"I'm hoping that people at the federal level, at the very top, will understand this was catastrophic," Turner said at a press conference. "We just need the red tape to be cleared."

Turner said he did not want the city to pay for relief efforts on its own and then seek reimbursement, but rather wants federal funds as soon as possible.

Principal refinería de EEUU cierra totalmente por inundaciones en Texas - Reuters (Spanish)

{{20170830T175245.841+0000}}Principal refinería de EEUU cierra totalmente por inundaciones en TexasHOUSTON, 30 ago (Reuters) - La mayor refinería de Estados Unidos cerró por completo el miércoles debido a que las fuertes lluvias causadas por la tormenta tropical Harvey inundaron la planta de producción de 603.000 barriles por día (bpd) de crudo en Port Arthur, Texas, según informó la propia compañía, Motiva Enterprises.

"A las 05:00 hora local (1000 GMT) del miércoles, Motiva comenzó un cierre controlado de la refinería de Port Arthur en respuesta a las crecientes condiciones de inundación locales", dijo la empresa, que agregó que el reinicio de las operaciones dependerá de que baje el agua.

Un meteorólogo del Gobierno estadounidense dijo que el total de lluvias por la tormenta en la zona de Beaumont-Port Arthur, en Texas, excedería las del área de Houston, la cuarta ciudad más poblada de Estados Unidos que se encuentra paralizada por las terribles inundaciones provocadas por Harvey.

Beaumont-Port Arthur recibió "una increíble cantidad de lluvia anoche", dijo David Roth, de la Administración Nacional Oceánica y Atmosférica. El punto de observación del aeropuerto regional muestra un total de lluvias en las últimas 24 horas que "parece exceder cualquiera reportado en torno a Houston en 24 horas durante el paso de Harvey", agregó el meteorólogo.

La refinería en Beaumont de ExxonMobil Corp , junto con las de Port Arthur de Total SA y Valero Energy Corp estuvieron cerradas el martes y miércoles por la tormenta. [nL2N1LF0ON]

Fuentes con conocimiento de las operaciones en la planta de Motiva [MOTIV.UL] dijeron que la refinería había reducido la producción a casi un 40 por ciento de la capacidad a las 21:00 hora local el martes, antes de cortar por completo las actividades.

Motiva esperaba mantener la producción de la refinería al menos en un nivel mínimo de ser posible, pero estaba moviendo las unidades a la etapa de circulación, antes de un cierre total. En circulación, las unidades son mantenidas a temperatura operativa y circulan crudo u otras materias primas dentro de ellas pero no se genera producción. La medida permite a la refinería un reinicio rápido.

El miércoles a la mañana, varias áreas de la planta de Motiva estaban inundadas, dijeron las fuentes, que agregaron que no estaba claro si las unidades sufrieron algún daño.

FACTBOX-U.S. Gulf Coast energy infrastructure shut due to Harvey - 路透新闻

{{20170830T125819.239+0000}}FACTBOX-U.S. Gulf Coast energy infrastructure shut due to Harvey(Updates outages)

By Devika  Krishna Kumar

Aug 30 (Reuters) - Tropical Storm Harvey made landfall in Louisiana early on Wednesday after
hammering Texas, threatening more infrastructure in the heart of the U.S. oil and natural gas
industry.

The U.S. National Hurricane Center said Harvey came ashore just west of Cameron, Louisiana,
and was expected to weaken to a tropical depression by Wednesday evening. [nL4N1LG3F3]

Numerous refineries, terminals, drilling platforms and other infrastructure have shut. At
least 4.2 million bpd of refining capacity was offline, or more than 22 percent of total U.S.
capacity, based on company reports and Reuters estimates. The Gulf is home to nearly half of
U.S. refining capacity. [nL2N1LE12X]

Texas is home to 5.6 million barrels per day (bpd) of refining capacity, and neighboring
Louisiana has 3.3 million bpd.

Valero Energy Corp's  335,000-barrel-per-day (bpd) Port Arthur, Texas, refinery was
shut on Wednesday morning, according to sources familiar with plant operations. Total SA's
 225,500-bpd Port Arthur, Texas, refinery was shut by an early-Wednesday power outage,
Gulf Coast market sources said.

Motiva Enterprises [MOTIV.UL] began shutting down its 603,000-bpd Port Arthur, Texas,
refinery, the nation's largest, on Tuesday evening due to flooding within the plant, said
sources familiar with plant operations. [nL2N1LF202]

As of Tuesday afternoon, more than 18 percent, or 319,523 bpd, of current oil production in
the Gulf of Mexico was shut versus about 19 percent a day earlier, the U.S. Department of the
Interior's Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement said. [nL2N1LE135]

FACTBOX-U.S. Gulf Coast energy infrastructure shut due to Harvey - 路透新闻

{{20170830T110951.323+0000}}FACTBOX-U.S. Gulf Coast energy infrastructure shut due to Harvey(Adds latest on Total Port Arthur)

By Devika  Krishna Kumar

Aug 30 (Reuters) - Tropical Storm Harvey made landfall in Louisiana early on Wednesday after
hammering Texas, threatening more infrastructure in the heart of the U.S. oil and natural gas
industry.

The U.S. National Hurricane Center said that Harvey came ashore just west of Cameron,
Louisiana, and it is expected to weaken to a tropical depression by this evening. [nL4N1LG3F3]

Numerous refineries, terminals, drilling platforms and other infrastructure have shut. Texas
is home to 5.6 million barrels per day (bpd) of refining capacity, and neighboring Louisiana has
3.3 million bpd.

Total SA's  225,500 barrel per day (bpd) Port Arthur, Texas, refinery was shut by an
early morning power outage, Gulf Coast market sources said.

Meanwhile, Motiva Enterprises [MOTIV.UL] began shutting down its 603,000 bpd Port Arthur,
Texas, refinery, the nation's largest, on Tuesday evening due to flooding within the plant, said
sources familiar with plant operations. [nL2N1LF202]

Valero Energy Corp  shut the large crude distillation unit and the gasoline-producing
fluidic catalytic cracking unit at its 335,000 bpd Port Arthur, Texas refinery. [nL2N1LF22R]

At least 3.6 million bpd of refining capacity is offline, or nearly 20 percent of total U.S.
capacity, based on company reports and Reuters estimates. The Gulf is home to nearly half of
U.S. refining capacity. [nL2N1LE12X]

As of Tuesday afternoon, more than 18 percent, or 319,523 bpd, of current oil production in
the Gulf of Mexico has been shut versus about 19 percent a day earlier, the U.S. Department of
the Interior's Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement said. [nL2N1LE135]

UPDATE 3-Storm Harvey paralyzes a fifth of U.S. fuel output - 路透新闻

{{20170830T001919.668+0000}}UPDATE 3-Storm Harvey paralyzes a fifth of U.S. fuel output(Recasts with additional refining output cut, updates prices, details)

By Erwin Seba

HOUSTON, Aug 29 (Reuters) - Flooding from Tropical Storm Harvey has shut nearly a fifth of U.S. oil-refining capacity, triggering worries about a gasoline supply crunch as the slow-moving tempest lumbers through the heart of America's petrochemicals industry.

At least 3.6 million barrels per day of refining capacity are offline in Texas and Louisiana, or nearly 20 percent of total U.S. capacity, based on company reports and Reuters estimates. Restarting plants even under the best conditions can take a week or more. [nL2N1LE0LK]

As a result of the outages, major pipelines carrying gasoline, diesel and jet fuel started to adjust deliveries or close lines outright because of a lack of supply. U.S. gasoline futures surged 4 percent to settle at their highest in more than two years. [O/R]

The U.S. Gulf Coast is home to nearly half of domestic refining capacity, with some 5.6 million bpd of capacity in Texas and 3.3 million bpd in Louisiana.

More refinery closures were expected, as parts of Texas have received more than 4 feet (1.2 metres) of rain. Fuel prices were expected to keep rising as refining capacity remains down and pipelines run short. Explorer Pipeline, which runs from Texas to Chicago, will shut two lines early on Wednesday.

"These closures are already impacting markets, with crude prices lower on a perceived drop in demand and gasoline prices spiking in response to lower supply," said Sandy Fielden, director of oil and products research at Morningstar.

Colonial Pipeline, the key artery sending gasoline up the East Coast, was still shipping barrels there but had faced flooding at origination points in Texas. [nFWN1LE0RJ]

The U.S. Northeast was already dealing with reduced supply. Philadelphia Energy Solutions, the region's largest refiner, said it had sold all its available regular gasoline barrels because of increased demand, while Monroe Energy's refinery had increased runs. [nL2N1LF172] [nL2N1LF14U]

"Harvey will raise product prices nationwide, denting demand, especially in September," said Barclays analysts in a note on Tuesday.

U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude edged down 13 cents, or 0.3 percent, to $46.44 a barrel.

In cash trading, the spread between Gulf Coast gasoline prices and benchmark futures rallied further, a day after hitting a five-year high in anticipation of constrained supply. That price was lately 24 cents above benchmark futures , traders said. [nL2N1LE1PT]

GASOLINE PRICES RISE

Retail gasoline prices have started to rise, too, with the average gallon of gasoline rising 1 cent overnight to $2.38 nationally. The average price in Texas rose 2 cents to $2.19 per gallon.

Motiva Enterprises began shutting down its 603,000-bpd Port Arthur, Texas, refinery, the nation's largest, on Tuesday evening because of flooding within the plant, said sources familiar with plant operations.

Valero Energy Corp shut the large crude distillation unit and the gasoline-producing fluidic catalytic cracking unit at its 335,000-bpd Port Arthur, Texas, refinery.

Marathon Petroleum Corp was shutting two refineries in the Houston area on Tuesday because of flooding, according to sources familiar with plant operations. The 459,000-bpd Galveston Bay Refinery in Texas City, Texas, 45 miles (72 km) south of Houston, has flooding in its tank farm and on nearby streets, the sources said. [nL2N1LF0TR]

Exxon has shut its 362,300-bpd Beaumont refinery in east Texas because of high water in the plant, said sources familiar with the plant. The company earlier shut production at its Baytown, Texas, refinery, the nation's second largest.

FACTBOX-U.S. Gulf Coast energy infrastructure shut due to Harvey - 路透新闻

{{20170829T224821.806+0000}}FACTBOX-U.S. Gulf Coast energy infrastructure shut due to Harvey(Adds latest on Motiva, Valero refineries)

By Devika  Krishna Kumar

Aug 29 (Reuters) - Tropical Storm Harvey hammered Texas and headed toward Louisiana,
threatening more infrastructure in the heart of the U.S. oil and natural gas industry. By
Tuesday, winds had decreased, but massive rain was flooding parts of Houston and heading up the
Gulf Coast where it is expected to continue for several days. [nL2N1LF09J]

Numerous refineries, terminals, drilling platforms and other infrastructure have shut. Texas
is home to 5.6 million barrels per day (bpd) of refining capacity, and neighboring Louisiana has
3.3 million bpd.

Motiva Enterprises [MOTIV.UL] began shutting down its 603,000-barrel-per-day (bpd) Port
Arthur, Texas, refinery, the nation's largest, on Tuesday evening due to flooding within the
plant, said sources familiar with plant operations. [nL2N1LF202]

Valero Energy Corp  shut the large crude distillation unit and the gasoline-producing
fluidic catalytic cracking unit at its 335,000 bpd Port Arthur, Texas refinery. [nL2N1LF22R]

At least 3.6 million bpd of refining capacity is offline, or nearly 20 percent of total U.S.
capacity, based on company reports and Reuters estimates. The Gulf is home to nearly half of
U.S. refining capacity. [nL2N1LE12X]

As of Tuesday afternoon, more than 18 percent, or 319,523 bpd, of current oil production in
the Gulf of Mexico has been shut versus about 19 percent a day earlier, the U.S. Department of
the Interior's Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement said. [nL2N1LE135]

{{20170829T202658.479+0000}}UPDATE 1-Exxon shutting Beaumont refinery due to Harvey -sources(Adds company statement)

HOUSTON, Aug 29 (Reuters) - ExxonMobil Corp was shutting all units at its 362,300 barrel-per-day Beaumont, Texas, refinery on Tuesday, said sources familiar with plant operations.

Exxon said later on Tuesday that the Beaumont refinery had reduced production and shut some units due to the adverse weather.

Earlier in the day, Exxon shut the larger of two crude distillation units, the 240,000 bpd Crude B unit, and the 45,000 bpd coking unit due to high water in the refinery, the sources said.

Mozambico, Eni pagherà 350 mln dlr per capital gain cessione quota a Exxon  - Reuters (Italian)

{{20170829T175714.369+0000}}Mozambico, Eni pagherà 350 mln dlr per capital gain cessione quota a Exxon MAPUTO, 29 agosto (Reuters) - Il Mozambico imporrà a Eni una tassa da 350 milioni di dollari sul capital gain per la vendita a ExxonMobil di una quota nell'impianto di gas 'Coral South'.

A dirlo il ministro delle Finanze del Paese a una tv locale.

A giugno, Eni ha firmato un accordo da 8 miliardi di dollari con il governo per sviluppare un impianto di gas al largo della costa del Mozambico, il primo di una serie di progetti che potrebbero trasformare il Paese in un importante fornitore di energia all'Asia.

L'impianto Coral South gestito da Eni contiene circa 450 miliardi di metri cubi di gas.

Exxon Mobil quest'anno ha acconsentito a pagare a Eni 2,8 miliardi di dollari per la quota del 25% in Coral South.

Mozambique's government plans to set up a sovereign investment fund where taxes received on sales of the country's minerals will be used to finance development projects, state media reported earlier this month.[nL8N1L74IJ]

The government has authorised the asset sale and the tax authorities can now collect the tax, Minister of Economy and Finance Adriano Maleiane said in a news bulletin on the private television station STV.

"The state has already done what had to be done. Officials from outside the country must close, and from there they have a deadline of 30 days to bring the funds here to Mozambique. Before the end of the year is the probable deadline, "said Maleiane.

In June, ENI signed an $8 billion deal with the government to develop a gas field off the coast of Mozambique, the first of a series of projects that could transform the poor African nation into a major energy supplier to Asia.[nL8N1IY5XS]

The Coral South field operated by ENI contains about 450 billion cubic metres or 16 trillion cubic feet (tcf) of gas.

Exxon Mobil Corp agreed this year to pay Eni $2.8 billion for a 25 percent stake in Coral South.[nL3N1GM3SO]

Maputo has been struggling to shake off an international scandal after the discovery of hidden loans worth $2 billion to state companies led the International Monetary Fund and Western donors to halt support, triggering the collapse of Mozambique's currency and leading to a debt default.[nL8N1J232G]

Tropensturm "Harvey" bedroht weitere Raffinerien an US-Golfküste - Reuters (German)

{{20170829T141714.158+0000}}Tropensturm "Harvey" bedroht weitere Raffinerien an US-GolfküsteHouston, 29. Aug (Reuters) - Wegen der heftigen Regenfälle durch Tropensturm "Harvey" könnten weitere Raffinerien an der US-Golfküste ihren Betrieb einstellen. Der Ölkonzern ExxonMobil wird möglicherweise bereits am Dienstag seine Anlage in Beaumont im Osten von Texas schließen, wie mehrere Insider der Nachrichtenagentur Reuters sagten. Die zweitgrößte US-Raffinerie in Baytown läuft bereits mit gedrosselter Produktion.

Dasselbe gilt Insidern zufolge für die größte US-Anlage in Port Arthur, die von Motiva Enterprises[MOTIV.UL] betrieben wird. Noch am Dienstag wird demnach entschieden, ob die Produktion ganz eingestellt wird. Auch der Raffineriekonzern Marathon Petroleum stellt nach Reuters-Informationen im Werk Galveston Bay den Betrieb ein.

Auf die Golfküste entfällt die Hälfte der Raffineriekapazität in den USA. Etwa 15 Prozent der gesamten amerikanischen Produktion ist wegen des Unwetters nicht verfügbar. Selbst bei idealen Bedingungen dürfte es mindestens eine Woche dauern, bis die Raffinerien wieder angefahren werden können.

Wegen des heftigen Regens, den "Harvey" mit sich bringt, steigen die Pegel in der Ölmetropole Houston immer weiter an. Bislang sind neun Todesopfer gezählt worden. Der Großraum Houston, wo fast sieben Millionen Menschen leben, steht größtenteils unter Wasser.

Harvey threatens more U.S. oil refineries after heavy rains - 路透新闻

{{20170829T132828.360+0000}}Harvey threatens more U.S. oil refineries after heavy rainsBy Erwin Seba

HOUSTON, Aug 29 (Reuters) - Heavy rains and flooding from Tropical Storm Harvey threatened more oil refineries along the Louisiana coast after hammering plants in Texas, forcing Exxon Mobil Corp and Citgo Petroleum [PDVSAC.UL] to consider shutdowns.

The storm dropped back over the Gulf of Mexico on Monday, sending heavy rains from Houston through to Lake Charles, Louisiana. Between five and 15 inches of rain was expected in south-central Louisiana, the National Hurricane Center said on Tuesday.

The Gulf Coast is home to nearly half the U.S. refining capacity, and nearly 2.7 million barrels per day, or nearly 15 percent of U.S. refining capacity, is already shut off. Restarting those plants even under the best conditions can take a week or more.

Louisiana is home to about 3.3 million barrels of daily capacity; Texas has about 5.6 million barrels.

U.S. gasoline futures on Tuesday rose 0.9 percent to $1.73 a gallon, and have jumped about 6 percent since last Wednesday's prestorm close. Heating oil futures, a proxy for diesel and other distillates, added 0.5 percent.

Fuel prices are expected to keep rising as refining capacity remains down because of the storm. In cash trading on Monday, the spread between Gulf Coast gasoline prices and benchmark futures hit a five-year high in anticipation of constrained supply. [nL2N1LE1PT]

The full impact of the refining outages, which began last week when Harvey slammed into Corpus Christi, Texas, and is now affecting Louisiana's refining center, remained uncertain, analysts said.

"The current disruptions are affecting both demand and supply, making it difficult to assess the impact on balances at this point," wrote analysts at JBC Energy.

Exxon may begin shutting units as early as Tuesday at its 362,300-barrel-per-day (bpd) Beaumont refinery in east Texas due to high water in the plant, said sources familiar with the company's plans. It was weighing a shutdown of its 240,000-bpd crude distillation unit and 45,000-bpd coking unit, the sources said. The company earlier cut production at its Baytown, Texas, refinery, the nation's second largest.

Motiva Enterprises [MOTIV.UL] plans to make a final decision Tuesday on whether to shut the nation's largest crude refinery as the storm pours more water into its Port Arthur, Texas, plant, two sources familiar with plant operations said. Motiva said Monday that operations at the plant were "stable."

Citgo's 425,0000-bpd Lake Charles, Louisiana, refinery has reduced production because of crude oil shipping disruptions, Energy News Today reported on Monday. Citgo is keeping a close eye on operations, a spokeswoman said Monday night.

Previous storms have substantially affected demand, which may offset expectations for tightening refined product supply. Retail gasoline prices have started to rise, with the average price for a gallon of gasoline rising 1 cent overnight to $2.38 nationally, while the average price in Texas rose 2 cents overnight to $2.19 per gallon.

Compounding matters is the possible closing of the Houston Ship Channel, a prime artery for crude supplies, for an extended period of time.

Exxon Mobil Vietnam gas project could start in November -state TV - Reuters News

{{20170829T130448.175+0000}}Exxon Mobil Vietnam gas project could start in November -state TVHANOI, Aug 29 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp's Blue Whale gas project, Vietnam's biggest, could start in November, Vietnam Television (VTV) reported on Tuesday.

The Blue Whale field has an estimated 150 billion cubic metres of reserves. Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc told Exxon Mobil on Tuesday he hoped to have the project starting officially at an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in November when U.S. President Donald Trump and U.S. government officials are expected to attend, state-run VTV reported.

Vietnam is trying to switch to cleaner energy from coal-fired power plants. The country is also planning solar and wind power plants. [nL3N1GO04I]

Jon Gibbs, Exxon Mobil's vice president in Asia Pacific and Middle East, said the U.S. company aimed to produce the first gas for Vietnamese power plants in 2023, VTV reported.

PetroVietnam, Exxon Mobil's Vietnamese partner, has said the project would contribute nearly $20 billion to the state budget. [nL4N1F33WP]

Exxon Mobil established an exploration and exploitation unit in Vietnam that distributes lubricant and petrochemical products, a Vietnamese government news website said.

By Peter Henderson and Mica Rosenberg

HOUSTON, Aug 28 (Reuters) - Historic flooding from Tropical Storm Harvey killed at least seven people in Texas and was expected to drive 30,000 from their homes, as officials on Monday warned that floodwaters would likely rise in the coming days as the storm hovers over the U.S. Gulf Coast.

Thousands of National Guard troops, police, rescue workers and civilians raced in helicopters, boats and special high-water trucks to rescue the hundreds of people still believed trapped in Houston, the nation's fourth-largest city.

The storm was the most powerful hurricane to strike Texas in more than 50 years when it came ashore on Friday near Corpus Christi, about 220 miles (354 km) south of Houston.

It is believed to have killed at least six people in Harris County, where Houston is located, according to Tricia Bentley, a spokeswoman for the county coroner's office. A 60-year-old woman died in neighboring Montgomery County when a tree fell on her trailer home while she slept, the local medical examiner's letter said on Twitter. More deaths were suspected in neighboring counties.

As stunned families surveyed the wreckage of destroyed homes along the nearby coast and roads that were not flooded were clogged with debris, Texas Governor Greg Abbott warned Houstonians to brace for a long period of disruption.

"We need to recognize this is going to be a new and different normal for this entire region," Abbott told reporters after touring the damaged coastal city of Corpus Christi.

Harvey was expected to remain over Texas' Gulf Coast for the next few days, dropping another 10 inches to 20 inches (25-51 cm) of rain, with threats of flooding extending into neighboring Louisiana.

In scenes evoking the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans in 2005, police and Coast Guard teams have rescued at least 2,000 people so far, plucking many from rooftops by helicopter, as they urged the hundreds believed to be marooned in flooded houses to hang towels or sheets outside to alert rescuers.

Harvey's center was 85 miles (137 km) south-southwest of Houston on Monday afternoon and forecast to arc slowly toward the city through Wednesday, with the worst floods expected later that day and on Thursday.

Schools and office buildings were closed throughout in the metropolitan area, home to 6.8 million people, on Monday as chest-high water filled some neighborhoods in the low-lying city.

Numerous refiners shut operations in the nation's refining and petrochemical hub.

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers said Monday that it was releasing water from the nearby Addicks and Barker reservoirs into Buffalo Bayou, the primary body of water running through Houston. Officials warned that would lead to more flooding.

"The more they release it could go up and it could create even additional problems," Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner warned. The release was necessary to prevent an uncontrolled surge of water, which Turner said "would be exponentially worse."

Torrential rain also hit areas more than 150 miles (240 km) away, swelling rivers upstream and causing a surge that was heading toward the Houston area, where numerous rivers and streams already have been breached.

The high floodwaters made it hard for some residents who had fled their homes to find safe places to stay. Christe Fletcher, 37, fled her house after it flooded to waist-deep, but was struggling to find a safe route to the hotel where she had reserved a room.

"It's kind of hard to get there because all of the roads are closed," Fletched said. "It's the worst experience you can go through."

'NOT COMPLAINING, WE'RE ALIVE'

About 5,500 people were in shelters as of Monday morning, city officials said, with Federal Emergency Management Agency director Brock Long forecasting that as more than 30,000 people would eventually are expected to be placed temporarily in shelters.

Many area residents were left in limbo, wondering what remained of their flooded homes.

Regina Costilla, 48, said she and her 16-year-old son had been rescued from their home by a good Samaritan with a boat. She sat and worried until she was reunited with her husband and large dog, who had been left behind because they didn't fit into the boat.

"I'm not complaining, we're alive," said Costilla. "When I saw the forecast of the storm I said I'll be happy if we get out with our lives"

Houston did not order an evacuation due to concerns about people being stranded on city highways now consumed by floods, Turner said.

Abbott, who had suggested on Friday that people leave the area, declined to second-guess the mayor on Monday, telling reporters, "Decisions about evacuations are something that are behind us."

TRUMP TO VISIT

U.S. President Donald Trump plans to go to Texas on Tuesday to survey the damage, a White House spokeswoman said on Sunday. [nL2N1LD0IB] On Monday he approved an emergency declaration for Louisiana.

Trump, facing the biggest U.S. natural disaster since he took office in January, signed a disaster proclamation for Texas on Friday, triggering federal relief efforts.

"We're dealing with Congress. As you know it's going to be a very expensive situation," Trump told reporters on Monday. [nL2N1LE19S]

Almost half of the U.S. refining capacity is in the Gulf region. Shutdowns extended across the coast, including Exxon Mobil's facility in Baytown, the nation's second largest refinery.[nL2N1LD0FS][nL2N1LD09D]

The floods' path of destruction could destroy as much as $20 billion in insured property, making it one of the costliest storms in history for U.S. insurers, according to Wall Street analysts. [nL8N1LE4AZ]

NEW YORK, Aug 28 (Reuters) - The S&P 500 and Dow ended little changed on Monday, with energy and bank shares lower as Tropical Storm Harvey crippled the U.S. energy hub in Texas, while tech and healthcare gave a light boost to the Nasdaq.

Harvey, the most powerful hurricane to strike the southern U.S. state in more than 50 years when it came ashore on Friday, dumped more rain on Houston on Monday, and the flooding could worsen as engineers release water from overflowing reservoirs to keep it from jumping dams and surging uncontrollably. [nL2N1LE05R]

Market analysts said despite the human drama and infrastructure devastation, the market could take solace in the fact that a massive rebuilding effort would mostly offset the negative economic consequences of the flooding.

U.S. crude futures fell 2.5 percent to $46.68 per barrel over concerns that the refinery shutdowns could trigger an increase in crude inventories. Gasoline prices , however, rose. [nL4N1LE17O]

Oil majors Exxon and Chevron were down 0.3 percent and 0.4 percent respectively. Refiner Valero Energy climbed 1.1 percent.

Investors sought safe-haven assets, with gold rising to its highest in nearly 10 months.

But the search for safe havens was accompanied by stock picking in Home Depot , which rose 1.2 percent, and other companies likely to benefit from rebuilding efforts in the region. [nL2N1LE0GD]

"Home Depot will most certainly see a financial benefit from Hurricane Harvey, just as it did from Hurricane Sandy back in 2013," said Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail.

Insurer Travelers was the largest drag on the Dow with a 2.6 percent drop to $123.23, while Allstate fell 1.5 percent to $90.65 as investors assessed the likely impact of Harvey on the sector.

The S&P 500 financial sector <.SPSY> was the largest weight on the index, with a 0.5 percent drop. [nL2N1LE137]

"There tends to be initially a knee-jerk reaction and people react to the human side and the energy disruption, but that eases soon," said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at The Leuthold Group in Minneapolis, of the market's reaction to the major storm and its aftermath.

"This is a massive human tragedy and the worst of it may not be over yet, but as far as stock market impact I don't know if it is net-net a huge negative considering the fact it will bring in huge stimulus to the region."

The Dow Jones Industrial Average <.DJI> fell 5.27 points, or 0.02 percent, to close at 21,808.4, the S&P 500 <.SPX> gained 1.19 points, or 0.05 percent, to 2,444.24

The Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> added 17.37 points, or 0.28 percent, to 6,283.02 helped by rises in Apple and Gilead Sciences .

Kite Pharmaceuticals surged 28.0 percent to $178.05 after Gilead Sciences agreed to buy the immunotherapy developer in a deal valued at $11.9 billion. Shares of Gilead rose 1.2 percent. [nL4N1LE3SZ]

Expedia fell 4.5 percent after an internal memo by the online travel services company said its CEO, Dara Khosrowshahi, has been asked to lead Uber [UBER.UL].

Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.14-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.02-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

About 5.13 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, compared with the near 6 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.

Harvey threatens more U.S. oil refineries after heavy rains - 路透新闻

{{20170829T132828.360+0000}}Harvey threatens more U.S. oil refineries after heavy rainsBy Erwin Seba

HOUSTON, Aug 29 (Reuters) - Heavy rains and flooding from Tropical Storm Harvey threatened more oil refineries along the Louisiana coast after hammering plants in Texas, forcing Exxon Mobil Corp and Citgo Petroleum [PDVSAC.UL] to consider shutdowns.

The storm dropped back over the Gulf of Mexico on Monday, sending heavy rains from Houston through to Lake Charles, Louisiana. Between five and 15 inches of rain was expected in south-central Louisiana, the National Hurricane Center said on Tuesday.

The Gulf Coast is home to nearly half the U.S. refining capacity, and nearly 2.7 million barrels per day, or nearly 15 percent of U.S. refining capacity, is already shut off. Restarting those plants even under the best conditions can take a week or more.

Louisiana is home to about 3.3 million barrels of daily capacity; Texas has about 5.6 million barrels.

U.S. gasoline futures on Tuesday rose 0.9 percent to $1.73 a gallon, and have jumped about 6 percent since last Wednesday's prestorm close. Heating oil futures, a proxy for diesel and other distillates, added 0.5 percent.

Fuel prices are expected to keep rising as refining capacity remains down because of the storm. In cash trading on Monday, the spread between Gulf Coast gasoline prices and benchmark futures hit a five-year high in anticipation of constrained supply. [nL2N1LE1PT]

The full impact of the refining outages, which began last week when Harvey slammed into Corpus Christi, Texas, and is now affecting Louisiana's refining center, remained uncertain, analysts said.

"The current disruptions are affecting both demand and supply, making it difficult to assess the impact on balances at this point," wrote analysts at JBC Energy.

Exxon may begin shutting units as early as Tuesday at its 362,300-barrel-per-day (bpd) Beaumont refinery in east Texas due to high water in the plant, said sources familiar with the company's plans. It was weighing a shutdown of its 240,000-bpd crude distillation unit and 45,000-bpd coking unit, the sources said. The company earlier cut production at its Baytown, Texas, refinery, the nation's second largest.

Motiva Enterprises [MOTIV.UL] plans to make a final decision Tuesday on whether to shut the nation's largest crude refinery as the storm pours more water into its Port Arthur, Texas, plant, two sources familiar with plant operations said. Motiva said Monday that operations at the plant were "stable."

Citgo's 425,0000-bpd Lake Charles, Louisiana, refinery has reduced production because of crude oil shipping disruptions, Energy News Today reported on Monday. Citgo is keeping a close eye on operations, a spokeswoman said Monday night.

Previous storms have substantially affected demand, which may offset expectations for tightening refined product supply. Retail gasoline prices have started to rise, with the average price for a gallon of gasoline rising 1 cent overnight to $2.38 nationally, while the average price in Texas rose 2 cents overnight to $2.19 per gallon.

Compounding matters is the possible closing of the Houston Ship Channel, a prime artery for crude supplies, for an extended period of time.

29 août (Reuters) - Principales valeurs à suivre mardi à Wall Street, où les contrats à terme sur les indices de référence signalent une ouverture en baisse de l'ordre de 0,5% à 0,8% :

* COMPAGNIES D'ASSURANCE - La facture de la tempête tropicale Harvey pour les assureurs pourrait dépasser 20 milliards de dollars (16,58 milliards d'euros), selon les analystes de Wall Street. [nL8N1LE50K]

* COMPAGNIES PÉTROLIÈRES - Jefferies a abaissé mardi son objectif de cours sur plusieurs valeurs du secteur, notamment EXXON MOBIL et CHEVRON , jugeant l'amélioration du marché pétrolier "lente et ardue".

Par ailleurs, Harvey a touché l'industrie américaine du pétrole et du gaz en son coeur, conduisant plusieurs groupes pétroliers à suspendre l'activité de leurs raffineries et à évacuer les nombreuses plates-formes implantées dans le golfe du Mexique. Exxon Mobil a notamment fermé sa raffinerie de Baytown, la deuxième du pays.

* BEST BUY - Le distributeur d'électroménager et d'électronique grand public prend 1,5% à 63,40 dollars en avant-Bourse après avoir publié une croissance plus forte que prévu des ventes à magasins constants au deuxième trimestre de son exercice fiscal et relevé sa prévision de chiffre d'affaires annuel. [nL8N1LF3KX]

* ADVISORY BOARD a annoncé mardi la vente de ses activités dans le secteur de la santé à la division Optum d'UNITED HEALTH GROUP et de sa branche éducation au fonds d'investissement Vista Equity, pour un total de 2,58 milliards de dollars (2,14 milliards d'euros). [nL8N1LF48V]

Exxon Mobil Vietnam gas project could start in November -state TV - Reuters News

{{20170829T130448.175+0000}}Exxon Mobil Vietnam gas project could start in November -state TVHANOI, Aug 29 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp's Blue Whale gas project, Vietnam's biggest, could start in November, Vietnam Television (VTV) reported on Tuesday.

The Blue Whale field has an estimated 150 billion cubic metres of reserves. Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc told Exxon Mobil on Tuesday he hoped to have the project starting officially at an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in November when U.S. President Donald Trump and U.S. government officials are expected to attend, state-run VTV reported.

Vietnam is trying to switch to cleaner energy from coal-fired power plants. The country is also planning solar and wind power plants. [nL3N1GO04I]

Jon Gibbs, Exxon Mobil's vice president in Asia Pacific and Middle East, said the U.S. company aimed to produce the first gas for Vietnamese power plants in 2023, VTV reported.

PetroVietnam, Exxon Mobil's Vietnamese partner, has said the project would contribute nearly $20 billion to the state budget. [nL4N1F33WP]

Exxon Mobil established an exploration and exploitation unit in Vietnam that distributes lubricant and petrochemical products, a Vietnamese government news website said.

Exxon plans to shut the 240,000-bpd Crude B distillation unit and the 45,000-bpd coking unit first, the sources said.

HOUSTON, Aug 28 (Reuters) - Historic flooding from Tropical Storm Harvey killed at least seven people in Texas and was expected to drive 30,000 from their homes, as officials on Monday warned that floodwaters would likely rise in the coming days as the storm hovers over the U.S. Gulf Coast.

Thousands of National Guard troops, police, rescue workers and civilians raced in helicopters, boats and special high-water trucks to rescue the hundreds of people still believed trapped in Houston, the nation's fourth-largest city.

The storm was the most powerful hurricane to strike Texas in more than 50 years when it came ashore on Friday near Corpus Christi, about 220 miles (354 km) south of Houston.

It is believed to have killed at least six people in Harris County, where Houston is located, according to Tricia Bentley, a spokeswoman for the county coroner's office. A 60-year-old woman died in neighboring Montgomery County when a tree fell on her trailer home while she slept, the local medical examiner's letter said on Twitter. More deaths were suspected in neighboring counties.

As stunned families surveyed the wreckage of destroyed homes along the nearby coast and roads that were not flooded were clogged with debris, Texas Governor Greg Abbott warned Houstonians to brace for a long period of disruption.

"We need to recognize this is going to be a new and different normal for this entire region," Abbott told reporters after touring the damaged coastal city of Corpus Christi.

Harvey was expected to remain over Texas' Gulf Coast for the next few days, dropping another 10 inches to 20 inches (25-51 cm) of rain, with threats of flooding extending into neighboring Louisiana.

In scenes evoking the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans in 2005, police and Coast Guard teams have rescued at least 2,000 people so far, plucking many from rooftops by helicopter, as they urged the hundreds believed to be marooned in flooded houses to hang towels or sheets outside to alert rescuers.

Harvey's center was 85 miles (137 km) south-southwest of Houston on Monday afternoon and forecast to arc slowly toward the city through Wednesday, with the worst floods expected later that day and on Thursday.

Schools and office buildings were closed throughout in the metropolitan area, home to 6.8 million people, on Monday as chest-high water filled some neighborhoods in the low-lying city.

Numerous refiners shut operations in the nation's refining and petrochemical hub.

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers said Monday that it was releasing water from the nearby Addicks and Barker reservoirs into Buffalo Bayou, the primary body of water running through Houston. Officials warned that would lead to more flooding.

"The more they release it could go up and it could create even additional problems," Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner warned. The release was necessary to prevent an uncontrolled surge of water, which Turner said "would be exponentially worse."

Torrential rain also hit areas more than 150 miles (240 km) away, swelling rivers upstream and causing a surge that was heading toward the Houston area, where numerous rivers and streams already have been breached.

The high floodwaters made it hard for some residents who had fled their homes to find safe places to stay. Christe Fletcher, 37, fled her house after it flooded to waist-deep, but was struggling to find a safe route to the hotel where she had reserved a room.

"It's kind of hard to get there because all of the roads are closed," Fletched said. "It's the worst experience you can go through."

'NOT COMPLAINING, WE'RE ALIVE'

About 5,500 people were in shelters as of Monday morning, city officials said, with Federal Emergency Management Agency director Brock Long forecasting that as more than 30,000 people would eventually are expected to be placed temporarily in shelters.

Many area residents were left in limbo, wondering what remained of their flooded homes.

Regina Costilla, 48, said she and her 16-year-old son had been rescued from their home by a good Samaritan with a boat. She sat and worried until she was reunited with her husband and large dog, who had been left behind because they didn't fit into the boat.

"I'm not complaining, we're alive," said Costilla. "When I saw the forecast of the storm I said I'll be happy if we get out with our lives"

Houston did not order an evacuation due to concerns about people being stranded on city highways now consumed by floods, Turner said.

Abbott, who had suggested on Friday that people leave the area, declined to second-guess the mayor on Monday, telling reporters, "Decisions about evacuations are something that are behind us."

TRUMP TO VISIT

U.S. President Donald Trump plans to go to Texas on Tuesday to survey the damage, a White House spokeswoman said on Sunday. [nL2N1LD0IB] On Monday he approved an emergency declaration for Louisiana.

Trump, facing the biggest U.S. natural disaster since he took office in January, signed a disaster proclamation for Texas on Friday, triggering federal relief efforts.

"We're dealing with Congress. As you know it's going to be a very expensive situation," Trump told reporters on Monday. [nL2N1LE19S]

Almost half of the U.S. refining capacity is in the Gulf region. Shutdowns extended across the coast, including Exxon Mobil's facility in Baytown, the nation's second largest refinery.[nL2N1LD0FS][nL2N1LD09D]

The floods' path of destruction could destroy as much as $20 billion in insured property, making it one of the costliest storms in history for U.S. insurers, according to Wall Street analysts. [nL8N1LE4AZ]

NEW YORK, Aug 28 (Reuters) - The S&P 500 and Dow ended little changed on Monday, with energy and bank shares lower as Tropical Storm Harvey crippled the U.S. energy hub in Texas, while tech and healthcare gave a light boost to the Nasdaq.

Harvey, the most powerful hurricane to strike the southern U.S. state in more than 50 years when it came ashore on Friday, dumped more rain on Houston on Monday, and the flooding could worsen as engineers release water from overflowing reservoirs to keep it from jumping dams and surging uncontrollably. [nL2N1LE05R]

Market analysts said despite the human drama and infrastructure devastation, the market could take solace in the fact that a massive rebuilding effort would mostly offset the negative economic consequences of the flooding.

U.S. crude futures fell 2.5 percent to $46.68 per barrel over concerns that the refinery shutdowns could trigger an increase in crude inventories. Gasoline prices , however, rose. [nL4N1LE17O]

Oil majors Exxon and Chevron were down 0.3 percent and 0.4 percent respectively. Refiner Valero Energy climbed 1.1 percent.

Investors sought safe-haven assets, with gold rising to its highest in nearly 10 months.

But the search for safe havens was accompanied by stock picking in Home Depot , which rose 1.2 percent, and other companies likely to benefit from rebuilding efforts in the region. [nL2N1LE0GD]

"Home Depot will most certainly see a financial benefit from Hurricane Harvey, just as it did from Hurricane Sandy back in 2013," said Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail.

Insurer Travelers was the largest drag on the Dow with a 2.6 percent drop to $123.23, while Allstate fell 1.5 percent to $90.65 as investors assessed the likely impact of Harvey on the sector.

The S&P 500 financial sector <.SPSY> was the largest weight on the index, with a 0.5 percent drop. [nL2N1LE137]

"There tends to be initially a knee-jerk reaction and people react to the human side and the energy disruption, but that eases soon," said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at The Leuthold Group in Minneapolis, of the market's reaction to the major storm and its aftermath.

"This is a massive human tragedy and the worst of it may not be over yet, but as far as stock market impact I don't know if it is net-net a huge negative considering the fact it will bring in huge stimulus to the region."

The Dow Jones Industrial Average <.DJI> fell 5.27 points, or 0.02 percent, to close at 21,808.4, the S&P 500 <.SPX> gained 1.19 points, or 0.05 percent, to 2,444.24

The Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> added 17.37 points, or 0.28 percent, to 6,283.02 helped by rises in Apple and Gilead Sciences .

Kite Pharmaceuticals surged 28.0 percent to $178.05 after Gilead Sciences agreed to buy the immunotherapy developer in a deal valued at $11.9 billion. Shares of Gilead rose 1.2 percent. [nL4N1LE3SZ]

Expedia fell 4.5 percent after an internal memo by the online travel services company said its CEO, Dara Khosrowshahi, has been asked to lead Uber [UBER.UL].

Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.14-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.02-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

About 5.13 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, compared with the near 6 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.

By Rodrigo Campos

NEW YORK, Aug 28 (Reuters) - Energy and bank shares weighed on the Dow and the S&P 500 on Monday as Tropical Storm Harvey crippled the U.S. energy hub in Texas.

Harvey, the most powerful hurricane to strike the southern U.S. state in more than 50 years when it came ashore on Friday, dumped more rain on Houston on Monday, and the flooding could worsen as engineers release water from overflowing reservoirs to keep it from jumping dams and surging uncontrollably. [nL2N1LE05R]

U.S. crude futures fell 2.3 percent to $46.75 per barrel over concerns that the refinery shutdowns could trigger an increase in crude inventories. Gasoline prices , however, rose. [nL4N1LE17O]

Oil majors Exxon and Chevron were down 0.5 percent and 0.7 percent respectively. Refiner Valero Energy climbed 1.3 percent.

The uncertainty pushed investors toward safe-haven assets, with gold rising to its highest in nearly 10 months.

But the search for safe havens was accompanied by stock picking in Home Depot , which rose 1.1 percent, and other companies likely to benefit from rebuilding efforts in the region. [nL2N1LE0GD]

"Home Depot will most certainly see a financial benefit from Hurricane Harvey, just as it did from Hurricane Sandy back in 2013," said Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail.

Insurer Travelers was the largest drag on the Dow with a 2.6 percent drop to $123.21, while Allstate fell 1.5 percent to $90.60 as investors assessed the likely impact of Harvey on the sector.

The S&P 500 financial sector <.SPSY> was the largest weight on the index, with a 0.6 percent drop. [nL2N1LE137]

The Dow Jones Industrial Average <.DJI> fell 19.62 points, or 0.09 percent, to 21,794.05, the S&P 500 <.SPX> lost 0.41 point, or 0.02 percent, to 2,442.64

The Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> added 16.06 points, or 0.26 percent, to 6,281.70 helped by rises in Apple and Gilead Sciences .

Kite Pharmaceuticals surged 28.1 percent to $178.25 after Gilead Sciences agreed to buy the immunotherapy developer in a deal valued at $11.9 billion. Shares of Gilead were up 1.3 percent. [nL4N1LE3SZ]

Expedia fell 4.4 percent after an internal memo by the online travel services company said its CEO, Dara Khosrowshahi, has been asked to lead Uber [UBER.UL].

Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.21-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.13-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&P 500 posted 49 new 52-week highs and 10 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 98 new highs and 85 new lows.

Harvey threatens more U.S. oil refineries after heavy rains - 路透新闻

{{20170829T132828.360+0000}}Harvey threatens more U.S. oil refineries after heavy rainsBy Erwin Seba

HOUSTON, Aug 29 (Reuters) - Heavy rains and flooding from Tropical Storm Harvey threatened more oil refineries along the Louisiana coast after hammering plants in Texas, forcing Exxon Mobil Corp and Citgo Petroleum [PDVSAC.UL] to consider shutdowns.

The storm dropped back over the Gulf of Mexico on Monday, sending heavy rains from Houston through to Lake Charles, Louisiana. Between five and 15 inches of rain was expected in south-central Louisiana, the National Hurricane Center said on Tuesday.

The Gulf Coast is home to nearly half the U.S. refining capacity, and nearly 2.7 million barrels per day, or nearly 15 percent of U.S. refining capacity, is already shut off. Restarting those plants even under the best conditions can take a week or more.

Louisiana is home to about 3.3 million barrels of daily capacity; Texas has about 5.6 million barrels.

U.S. gasoline futures on Tuesday rose 0.9 percent to $1.73 a gallon, and have jumped about 6 percent since last Wednesday's prestorm close. Heating oil futures, a proxy for diesel and other distillates, added 0.5 percent.

Fuel prices are expected to keep rising as refining capacity remains down because of the storm. In cash trading on Monday, the spread between Gulf Coast gasoline prices and benchmark futures hit a five-year high in anticipation of constrained supply. [nL2N1LE1PT]

The full impact of the refining outages, which began last week when Harvey slammed into Corpus Christi, Texas, and is now affecting Louisiana's refining center, remained uncertain, analysts said.

"The current disruptions are affecting both demand and supply, making it difficult to assess the impact on balances at this point," wrote analysts at JBC Energy.

Exxon may begin shutting units as early as Tuesday at its 362,300-barrel-per-day (bpd) Beaumont refinery in east Texas due to high water in the plant, said sources familiar with the company's plans. It was weighing a shutdown of its 240,000-bpd crude distillation unit and 45,000-bpd coking unit, the sources said. The company earlier cut production at its Baytown, Texas, refinery, the nation's second largest.

Motiva Enterprises [MOTIV.UL] plans to make a final decision Tuesday on whether to shut the nation's largest crude refinery as the storm pours more water into its Port Arthur, Texas, plant, two sources familiar with plant operations said. Motiva said Monday that operations at the plant were "stable."

Citgo's 425,0000-bpd Lake Charles, Louisiana, refinery has reduced production because of crude oil shipping disruptions, Energy News Today reported on Monday. Citgo is keeping a close eye on operations, a spokeswoman said Monday night.

Previous storms have substantially affected demand, which may offset expectations for tightening refined product supply. Retail gasoline prices have started to rise, with the average price for a gallon of gasoline rising 1 cent overnight to $2.38 nationally, while the average price in Texas rose 2 cents overnight to $2.19 per gallon.

Compounding matters is the possible closing of the Houston Ship Channel, a prime artery for crude supplies, for an extended period of time.

Exxon Mobil Vietnam gas project could start in November -state TV - Reuters News

{{20170829T130448.175+0000}}Exxon Mobil Vietnam gas project could start in November -state TVHANOI, Aug 29 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp's Blue Whale gas project, Vietnam's biggest, could start in November, Vietnam Television (VTV) reported on Tuesday.

The Blue Whale field has an estimated 150 billion cubic metres of reserves. Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc told Exxon Mobil on Tuesday he hoped to have the project starting officially at an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in November when U.S. President Donald Trump and U.S. government officials are expected to attend, state-run VTV reported.

Vietnam is trying to switch to cleaner energy from coal-fired power plants. The country is also planning solar and wind power plants. [nL3N1GO04I]

Jon Gibbs, Exxon Mobil's vice president in Asia Pacific and Middle East, said the U.S. company aimed to produce the first gas for Vietnamese power plants in 2023, VTV reported.

PetroVietnam, Exxon Mobil's Vietnamese partner, has said the project would contribute nearly $20 billion to the state budget. [nL4N1F33WP]

Exxon Mobil established an exploration and exploitation unit in Vietnam that distributes lubricant and petrochemical products, a Vietnamese government news website said.

* 30,000 people expected to seek shelter - U.S. officials

By Peter Henderson and Mica Rosenberg

HOUSTON, Aug 28 (Reuters) - Historic flooding from Tropical Storm Harvey killed at least seven people in Texas and was expected to drive 30,000 from their homes, as officials on Monday warned that floodwaters would likely rise in the coming days as the storm hovers over the U.S. Gulf Coast.

Thousands of National Guard troops, police, rescue workers and civilians raced in helicopters, boats and special high-water trucks to rescue the hundreds of people still believed trapped in Houston, the nation's fourth-largest city.

The storm was the most powerful hurricane to strike Texas in more than 50 years when it came ashore on Friday near Corpus Christi, about 220 miles (354 km) south of Houston.

It is believed to have killed at least six people in Harris County, where Houston is located, according to Tricia Bentley, a spokeswoman for the county coroner's office. A 60-year-old woman died in neighboring Montgomery County when a tree fell on her trailer home while she slept, the local medical examiner's letter said on Twitter. More deaths were suspected in neighboring counties.

As stunned families surveyed the wreckage of destroyed homes along the nearby coast and roads that were not flooded were clogged with debris, Texas Governor Greg Abbott warned Houstonians to brace for a long period of disruption.

"We need to recognize this is going to be a new and different normal for this entire region," Abbott told reporters after touring the damaged coastal city of Corpus Christi.

Harvey was expected to remain over Texas' Gulf Coast for the next few days, dropping another 10 inches to 20 inches (25-51 cm) of rain, with threats of flooding extending into neighboring Louisiana.

In scenes evoking the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans in 2005, police and Coast Guard teams have rescued at least 2,000 people so far, plucking many from rooftops by helicopter, as they urged the hundreds believed to be marooned in flooded houses to hang towels or sheets outside to alert rescuers.

Harvey's center was 85 miles (137 km) south-southwest of Houston on Monday afternoon and forecast to arc slowly toward the city through Wednesday, with the worst floods expected later that day and on Thursday.

Schools and office buildings were closed throughout in the metropolitan area, home to 6.8 million people, on Monday as chest-high water filled some neighborhoods in the low-lying city.

Numerous refiners shut operations in the nation's refining and petrochemical hub.

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers said Monday that it was releasing water from the nearby Addicks and Barker reservoirs into Buffalo Bayou, the primary body of water running through Houston. Officials warned that would lead to more flooding.

"The more they release it could go up and it could create even additional problems," Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner warned. The release was necessary to prevent an uncontrolled surge of water, which Turner said "would be exponentially worse."

Torrential rain also hit areas more than 150 miles (240 km) away, swelling rivers upstream and causing a surge that was heading toward the Houston area, where numerous rivers and streams already have been breached.

The high floodwaters made it hard for some residents who had fled their homes to find safe places to stay. Christe Fletcher, 37, fled her house after it flooded to waist-deep, but was struggling to find a safe route to the hotel where she had reserved a room.

"It's kind of hard to get there because all of the roads are closed," Fletched said. "It's the worst experience you can go through."

'NOT COMPLAINING, WE'RE ALIVE'

About 5,500 people were in shelters as of Monday morning, city officials said, with Federal Emergency Management Agency director Brock Long forecasting that as more than 30,000 people would eventually are expected to be placed temporarily in shelters.

Many area residents were left in limbo, wondering what remained of their flooded homes.

Regina Costilla, 48, said she and her 16-year-old son had been rescued from their home by a good Samaritan with a boat. She sat and worried until she was reunited with her husband and large dog, who had been left behind because they didn't fit into the boat.

"I'm not complaining, we're alive," said Costilla. "When I saw the forecast of the storm I said I'll be happy if we get out with our lives"

Houston did not order an evacuation due to concerns about people being stranded on city highways now consumed by floods, Turner said.

Abbott, who had suggested on Friday that people leave the area, declined to second-guess the mayor on Monday, telling reporters, "Decisions about evacuations are something that are behind us."

TRUMP TO VISIT

U.S. President Donald Trump plans to go to Texas on Tuesday to survey the damage, a White House spokeswoman said on Sunday. [nL2N1LD0IB] On Monday he approved an emergency declaration for Louisiana.

Trump, facing the biggest U.S. natural disaster since he took office in January, signed a disaster proclamation for Texas on Friday, triggering federal relief efforts.

"We're dealing with Congress. As you know it's going to be a very expensive situation," Trump told reporters on Monday. [nL2N1LE19S]

Almost half of the U.S. refining capacity is in the Gulf region. Shutdowns extended across the coast, including Exxon Mobil's facility in Baytown, the nation's second largest refinery.[nL2N1LD0FS][nL2N1LD09D]

The floods' path of destruction could destroy as much as $20 billion in insured property, making it one of the costliest storms in history for U.S. insurers, according to Wall Street analysts. [nL8N1LE4AZ]

NEW YORK, Aug 28 (Reuters) - The S&P 500 and Dow ended little changed on Monday, with energy and bank shares lower as Tropical Storm Harvey crippled the U.S. energy hub in Texas, while tech and healthcare gave a light boost to the Nasdaq.

Harvey, the most powerful hurricane to strike the southern U.S. state in more than 50 years when it came ashore on Friday, dumped more rain on Houston on Monday, and the flooding could worsen as engineers release water from overflowing reservoirs to keep it from jumping dams and surging uncontrollably. [nL2N1LE05R]

Market analysts said despite the human drama and infrastructure devastation, the market could take solace in the fact that a massive rebuilding effort would mostly offset the negative economic consequences of the flooding.

U.S. crude futures fell 2.5 percent to $46.68 per barrel over concerns that the refinery shutdowns could trigger an increase in crude inventories. Gasoline prices , however, rose. [nL4N1LE17O]

Oil majors Exxon and Chevron were down 0.3 percent and 0.4 percent respectively. Refiner Valero Energy climbed 1.1 percent.

Investors sought safe-haven assets, with gold rising to its highest in nearly 10 months.

But the search for safe havens was accompanied by stock picking in Home Depot , which rose 1.2 percent, and other companies likely to benefit from rebuilding efforts in the region. [nL2N1LE0GD]

"Home Depot will most certainly see a financial benefit from Hurricane Harvey, just as it did from Hurricane Sandy back in 2013," said Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail.

Insurer Travelers was the largest drag on the Dow with a 2.6 percent drop to $123.23, while Allstate fell 1.5 percent to $90.65 as investors assessed the likely impact of Harvey on the sector.

The S&P 500 financial sector <.SPSY> was the largest weight on the index, with a 0.5 percent drop. [nL2N1LE137]

"There tends to be initially a knee-jerk reaction and people react to the human side and the energy disruption, but that eases soon," said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at The Leuthold Group in Minneapolis, of the market's reaction to the major storm and its aftermath.

"This is a massive human tragedy and the worst of it may not be over yet, but as far as stock market impact I don't know if it is net-net a huge negative considering the fact it will bring in huge stimulus to the region."

The Dow Jones Industrial Average <.DJI> fell 5.27 points, or 0.02 percent, to close at 21,808.4, the S&P 500 <.SPX> gained 1.19 points, or 0.05 percent, to 2,444.24

The Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> added 17.37 points, or 0.28 percent, to 6,283.02 helped by rises in Apple and Gilead Sciences .

Kite Pharmaceuticals surged 28.0 percent to $178.05 after Gilead Sciences agreed to buy the immunotherapy developer in a deal valued at $11.9 billion. Shares of Gilead rose 1.2 percent. [nL4N1LE3SZ]

Expedia fell 4.5 percent after an internal memo by the online travel services company said its CEO, Dara Khosrowshahi, has been asked to lead Uber [UBER.UL].

Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.14-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.02-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

About 5.13 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, compared with the near 6 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.

FOKUS 1-Zwei Tote durch Tropensturm "Harvey" - Überschwemmungsgefahr - Reuters (German)

{{20170827T064829.377+0000}}FOKUS 1-Zwei Tote durch Tropensturm "Harvey" - Überschwemmungsgefahr* Ein Mensch in Houston und Rockport sterben

* 230.000 Menschen sind ohne Strom

(Wochenendzusammenfassung)

Rockport, 27. Aug (Reuters) - In Texas sind durch den stärksten Sturm seit mehr als 50 Jahren zwei Menschen ums Leben gekommen. Zwar schwächte sich der mit großer Sorge erwartete Hurrikan "Harvey" am Wochenende ab, nachdem er auf Land traf. Trotzdem richtete er großes Chaos an. Mehr als 230.000 Menschen saßen nach Angaben örtlicher Versorger im Dunkeln. Die andauernden heftigen Regenfälle schürten Ängste vor heftigen Überschwemmungen. Zunächst war unklar, welchen Schaden "Harvey" insgesamt angerichtet hat. Fest stand, dass in der Küstenregion zahlreiche Dächer abgedeckt, Bäume entwurzelt und Autos beschädigt wurden. Viele Öl- und Gasproduzenten stellten vorübergehend ihre Arbeit ein.

Eine Frau starb, als sie mit ihrem Auto durch die überfluteten Straßen im Westen der Millionenstadt Houston fuhr. Ein weiterer Mensch kam bei einem Hausbrand in der besonders stark getroffenen Kleinstadt Rockport ums Leben, wie der Bürgermeister Charles Wax am Samstag sagte. Etwa ein Dutzend Menschen in der Region hätten Verletzungen wie Knochenbrüche erlitten, sagte ein anderer Vertreter der Behörden.

Der Sturm war in der Nacht zu Samstag mit Windgeschwindigkeiten von bis zu 210 Kilometern in der Stunde über die Küste von Texas hinweggefegt.[nL8N1LC0GF] Damit war "Harvey" der stärkste Sturm, der den Bundesstaat seit 1961 heimgesucht hat. Über Land schwächte sich "Harvey" weiter ab und wurde zum Tropensturm herabgestuft. Gefahr drohte vor allem durch Starkregen. Für einige Gegenden wurden Niederschlagsmengen von bis zu 102 Zentimetern vorhergesagt. "Das ist ernst", warnte Houstons Bürgermeister Sylvester Turner die rund zwei Millionen Einwohner. Es sei wichtig, dass niemand auf die Straße gehe. Dem Gouverneur von Texas, Greg Abbott, zufolge sind rund 1800 Militärangehörige im Einsatz, um bei Rettungsaktionen und Aufräumarbeiten zu helfen.

Der Sturm dürfte Texas noch tagelang in Atem halten, da er sich nur langsam fortbewegt. Laut Meteorologen könnten die starken Regenfälle die gesamte nächste Woche andauern. In Corpus Christi wiesen die Behörden die Anwohner an, ihren Wasserverbrauch zu drosseln und Trinkwasser abzukochen. Wegen der Stromausfälle kamen die Klärwerke nicht mit der Reinigung der Abwässer nach. In der Nähe des Flusses Brazos wurden rund 4500 Gefängnisinsassen aufgrund des steigenden Wasserspiegels in Sicherheit gebracht. Die US-Küstenwache rettete am Samstag nach eigenen Angaben 20 Menschen, deren Boote in Seenot geraten waren.

In der Region ist fast die Hälfte der US-Raffinerie-Kapazität angesiedelt, im Golf von Mexiko selbst erfolgt knapp ein Fünftel der Öl-Produktion des Landes. Ängste vor Engpässen sorgten ließen den Gaspreis auf den höchsten Wert seit vier Monaten steigen. Konzerne wie Royal Dutch Shell, Anadarko Petroleum und Exxon evakuierten ihre Öl- und Gasplattformen vor der Küste.

FACTBOX-U.S. Gulf Coast energy infrastructure shutters as Harvey hits Texas - 路透新闻

{{20170827T011628.796+0000}}FACTBOX-U.S. Gulf Coast energy infrastructure shutters as Harvey hits Texas(Adds latest from refineries)

Aug 26 (Reuters) - Tropical Storm Harvey hit Texas, the heart of the U.S. oil and gas
industry, late Friday as a Category 4 hurricane with winds of 130 miles per hour (209 km per
hour), making it the strongest storm to strike the state since 1961. [nL2N1LC088]

Refineries, terminals and other infrastructure had shutdown ahead of the hurricane making
landfall. Currently, damage assessments at four Corpus Christi, Texas, area oil refineries were
underway on Saturday, a first step toward resuming production at the plants with combined
capacity of 836,000 barrels per day (bpd), according to Gulf Coast refining sources.
[nL2N1LC0F3]

Texas is home to 5.6 million barrels of refining capacity, and Louisiana has 3.3 million
barrels.

At least 836,000 barrels per day of refining capacity is currently offline.

{{20170826T222413.771+0000}}Exxon cuts Baytown refinery rates due to ship channel shutdownNEW YORK, Aug 26 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp said on Saturday it has cut rates at its 560,000 barrel-per-day Baytown, Texas, refinery due to the shutdown of the Houston Ship Channel amid Tropical Storm Harvey.

"We continue to work with the Port of Houston to facilitate safe delivery of crude shipments when channel conditions allow," the company said in a statement.

On Friday, Exxon shut its Hoover and Galveston 209 platforms in the Gulf of Mexico due to Harvey. [nFWN1LB0SD]

{{20170826T220650.630+0000}}FACTBOX-U.S. Gulf Coast energy infrastructure shutters as Harvey hits Texas(Adds updates from terminal operators, refineries)

Aug 26 (Reuters) - Tropical Storm Harvey hit Texas, the heart of the U.S. oil and gas
industry, late Friday as a Category 4 hurricane with winds of 130 miles per hour (209 km per
hour), making it the strongest storm to strike the state since 1961. [nL2N1LC088]

Refineries, terminals and other infrastructure had shutdown ahead of the hurricane making
landfall. Currently, damage assessments at four Corpus Christi, Texas, area oil refineries were
underway on Saturday, a first step toward resuming production at the plants with combined
capacity of 836,000 barrels per day (bpd), according to Gulf Coast refining sources.
[nL2N1LC0F3]

Texas is home to 5.6 million barrels of refining capacity, and Louisiana has 3.3 million
barrels.

At least 836,000 barrels per day of refining capacity is currently offline.

About 25 percent of U.S. Gulf oil output offline due to Harvey - Reuters News

{{20170826T181801.172+0000}}About 25 percent of U.S. Gulf oil output offline due to HarveyHOUSTON, Aug 26 (Reuters) - Hurricane Harvey weakened further as it moved across southern Texas on Saturday and was on the cusp of becoming a tropical storm, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said.

The storm had maximum sustained winds of 75 mph (121 km per hour) as of 9 a.m. local time, the NHC said. Below that speed, a storm is classified as a tropical storm.

Harvey was the strongest storm in more than 50 years to hit Texas when it came ashore late on Friday as a Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale. [nL2N1LC088] That is the second-most powerful category of storm as measured by the speed of sustained winds.

HOUSTON, Aug 26 (Reuters) - About 25 percent of U.S. Gulf of Mexico oil production is offline due to Tropical Storm Harvey, the U.S. Department of the Interior's Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement said on Saturday.

That equates to roughly 428,568 barrels of oil per day out of the roughly 1.75 million bpd pumped from the Gulf. The amount of oil production offline increased from Friday, when roughly 22 percent of output was affected.[nL2N1LB1FC]

About 26 percent of Gulf natural gas production is offline, or about 835 million cubic feet per day, BSEE said.

Roughly 112 platforms have been evacuated in the Gulf so far as a result of Harvey, about 15 percent of those in the region. Half of the drilling rigs in the Gulf have also been evacuated, BSEE said.

BSEE tabulates the data by polling 30 Gulf operators.

{{20170826T161657.845+0000}}FOKUS 3-Hurrikan "Harvey" schwächt sich ab - Zehntausende ohne Strom* Massive Regenfälle - Überschwemmungen drohen

* Bewohner und Helfer suchen noch Schutz - Schäden bisher unklar

* Feuerwehr: "Wir wissen noch nicht, welche Probleme wir haben"

(neu: Hurrikan schwächt sich weiter ab, Schäden)

Corpus Christi, 26. Aug (Reuters) - Der in den USA mit großer Sorge erwartete Hurrikan "Harvey" hat sich am Samstag weiter abgeschwächt. Nachdem der Sturm mit Windgeschwindigkeiten von bis zu 210 Kilometern in der Stunde über die Küste von Texas hingweggefegt war, verlor er auf seinem Weg über den Bundesstaat im Süden der Vereinigten Staaten an Kraft. Doch den Texanern brachte er heftigen Regen und massive Stromausfälle. Nach Angaben örtlicher Versorger saßen mehr als 240.000 Kunden im Dunkeln. Im voraussichtlichen Verlauf von "Harvey" leben rund sechs Millionen Menschen. In der besonders gebeutelten Kleinstadt Rockport wurden eine Schule, ein Hotel und andere Gebäude stark beschädigt, von denen einige als Zufluchtsorte für die Bevölkerung dienten.

Im Laufe des Tages wurde "Harvey" auf der Hurrikan-Gefahrenskala immer weiter herabgestuft. Dennoch ist "Harvey" seit über 50 Jahren der schwerste Sturm in Texas, dem Zentrum der US-Gas- und Ölindustrie. In dem Bundesstaat am Golf von Mexiko wurden nach den Regenfällen verheerende Überschwemmungen befürchtet. Weil viele Bewohner und Helfer auch in anderen Regionen noch Schutz suchten, war das gesamte Ausmaß der von "Harvey" angerichteten Schäden am Samstag noch nicht abzusehen.

Der Leiter der Freiwilligen Feuerwehr von Rockport, Steve Sims, erklärte, dass die Menschen nirgendwo hingehen könnten. "Wir wissen, dass wir eine Menge Probleme haben, aber wir wissen noch nicht genau welche." Neben dem Strom fielen auch viele Internet- und Telefonnetze aus.

Tausende Anwohner hatten sich in der Region vorsorglich in Sicherheit gebracht. Viele widersetzten sich jedoch auch den Anweisungen, Schutz zu suchen, und horteten stattdessen Lebensmittel, Benzin und Sandsäcke. Nach einer Anordnung des Bürgermeisters von Rockport sollten alle, die blieben, ihre Namen auf den Arm schreiben - damit sie im Falle von Verletzungen oder Tod leichter zu identifizieren sind.

In Corpus Christi löste sich ein Bohrschiff aus seiner Verankerung und rammte im Hafen einige Schlepperboote. Die Klärwerke der Großstadt kamen wegen des Stromausfalls nicht mit der Reinigung von Abwässern nach. Die Bewohner wurden aufgefordert, ihren Wasserverbrauch zu drosseln und Trinkwasser abzukochen.

In der Region ist fast die Hälfte der US-Raffinerie-Kapazität angesiedelt, im Golf von Mexiko selbst erfolgt knapp ein Fünftel der Öl-Produktion des Landes. Ängste vor Engpässen sorgten für steigende Gaspreise. Konzerne wie Royal Dutch Shell, Anadarko Petroleum und Exxon evakuierten ihre Öl- und Gasplattformen vor der Küste. Schiffe mussten ihren Routen ändern.

Vielerorts wurden Erinnerungen an den Hurrikan "Katrina" der Kategorie fünf wach, der 2005 in den südöstlichen US-Bundesstaaten am Golf schwere Schäden verursacht hatte. Damals kamen etwa 1800 Menschen ums Leben.

FOKUS 2-Hurrikan "Harvey" erreicht Texas und schwächt sich ab - Reuters (German)

{{20170826T105448.469+0000}}FOKUS 2-Hurrikan "Harvey" erreicht Texas und schwächt sich ab* Stärkster Sturm seit mehr als einem Jahrzehnt

* Gebäude beschädigt - Über 360.000 Haushalte ohne Strom

* Sorge vor Engpässen im Golf von Mexiko - Gaspreise steigen

(neu: Hurrikan schwächt sich ab, Details)

Corpus Christi, 26. Aug (Reuters) - Der Hurrikan "Harvey" ist in Texas mit Windgeschwindigkeiten von bis zu 210 Kilometern in der Stunde auf die US-Küste getroffen. In der Nacht zu Samstag schwächte sich der schwerste Sturm seit mehr als einem Jahrzehnt ab. Trotzdem prognostizierten Experten verheerende Sturmfluten und heftige Regenfälle. Am Samstag stufte das Nationale Hurrikan-Zentrum (NHC) "Harvey" von der zweithöchsten Kategorie vier auf zwei zurück. Es wird aber damit gerechnet, dass der Sturm noch für Tage in den US-Bundesstaaten Texas und Louisiana wütet.

Rund sechs Millionen Menschen waren unmittelbar betroffen. "Harvey" erreichte nur wenige Kilometer von der Stadt Corpus Christi entfernt gegen 22 Uhr (Ortszeit) das erste Mal das Festland und bewegte sich dann nordöstlich weiter. Medien zufolge wurde zunächst vor allem die Stadt Rockport mit rund 10.000 Einwohnern schwer getroffen. Unter anderem wurden eine Schule, ein Hotel sowie andere Gebäude stark beschädigt, die als Zufluchtsorte vorgesehen waren.

Der Leiter der Freiwilligen Feuerwehr von Rockport, Steve Sims, erklärte, dass die Menschen weiterhin Schutz suchen müssten und nirgendwo hingehen könnten. "Wir wissen, dass wir eine Menge Probleme haben, aber wir wissen noch nicht genau welche." Die Strom- und Internetversorgung sowie die meisten Telefonnetze waren ausgefallen. Insgesamt befanden sich laut den Betreibern Ercot und AEP, die für meisten Netze in Texas verantwortlich sind, mehr als 360.000 Haushalte ohne Strom.

Tausende Anwohner hatten sich in der Region vorsorglich in Sicherheit gebracht. Viele widersetzten sich jedoch auch den Anweisungen, Schutz zu suchen, und horteten stattdessen Lebensmittel, Benzin und Sandsäcke.

In der Region ist auch fast die Hälfte der US-Raffinerie-Kapazität angesiedelt, im Golf von Mexiko selbst erfolgt knapp ein Fünftel der Öl-Produktion des Landes. Ängste vor Engpässen sorgten für steigende Gaspreise. Konzerne wie Royal Dutch Shell, Anadarko Petroleum und Exxon evakuierten ihre Öl- und Gasplattformen vor der Küste. Schiffe durften die Häfen zwischen Corpus Christi und Texas City nicht mehr anlaufen. Viele Kreuzfahrtschiffe mussten ihren Routen ändern.

US-Präsident Donald Trump, der sich nun mit dem ersten schweren Sturm in seiner Amtszeit konfrontiert sieht, hat für Texas den Katastrophenzustand ausgerufen. Er habe auf Wunsch des Gouverneurs des Bundesstaates, Greg Abbott, gehandelt, twitterte Trump am Freitag. Somit könnten jegliche Staatshilfen in Anspruch genommen werden.

"Harvey" war der erste Hurrikan der Stärke vier, der die USA seit "Charley" 2004 traf und der erste, der Texas seit 1961 heimsuchte. Vielerorts wurden Erinnerungen an den Hurrikan "Katrina" der Kategorie fünf wach, der 2005 in den südöstlichen US-Bundesstaaten am Golf schwere Schäden verursacht hatte. Damals kamen etwa 1800 Menschen ums Leben.

FOKUS 1-Hurrikan "Harvey" erreicht US-Küste - Reuters (German)

{{20170826T045812.954+0000}}FOKUS 1-Hurrikan "Harvey" erreicht US-Küste* Stärkster Sturm seit 2005

* Gaspreise steigen

(neu: Hurrikan erreicht Küste, Details)

Corpus Christi, 26. Aug (Reuters) - Der Hurrikan "Harvey" hat in der Nacht zu Samstag die US-Küste in Texas erreicht. Mit Windgeschwindigkeiten von bis zu 210 Kilometern in der Stunde traf der schwerste Sturm seit mehr als einem Jahrzehnt auf das US-amerikanische Festland. Es wurden Sturmfluten und weitere heftige Regenfälle erwartet. Das Nationale Hurrikan-Zentrum (NHC) stufte "Harvey" zuvor in die zweithöchste Kategorie 4 hoch. Dies bedeutet, dass der Sturm Bäume entwurzeln, Häuser zerstören und die Produktion von Versorgern für Tage unterbrechen könnte.

Es wurde damit gerechnet, dass der Sturm noch für Tage in den US-Bundesstaaten Texas und Louisiana wütet. Rund sechs Millionen Menschen dürften unmittelbar betroffen sein. "Harvey" erreichte nur wenige Kilometer von der Stadt Corpus Christi mit rund 320.000 Einwohnern gegen 22 Uhr (Ortszeit) das erste Mal Land und bewegte sich dann nordöstlich. Medienberichten zufolge wurde zunächst vor allem die Stadt Rockport schwer getroffen. Unter anderem wurden eine Schule, ein Hotel sowie andere Gebäude beschädigt, die als Zufluchtsorte vorgesehen waren. Tausende Anwohner hatten sich in der Region vorsorglich in Sicherheit gebracht. Viele widersetzten sich jedoch auch den Anweisungen, sich in Schutz zu bringen, und horteten stattdessen Lebensmittel, Benzin und Sandsäcke.

In der Region ist auch fast die Hälfte der US-Raffinerie angesiedelt, im Golf selbst erfolgt knapp ein Fünftel der Öl-Produktion des Landes. Konzerne wie Royal Dutch Shell, Anadarko Petroleum und Exxon haben ihre Öl- und Gasplattformen vor der Küste evakuiert. Die Gaspreise in den USA zogen bereits an.

US-Präsident Donald Trump, der sich nun mit dem ersten schweren Sturm in seiner Amtszeit konfrontiert sieht, hat für Texas den Katastrophenzustand ausgerufen. Er habe auf Wunsch des Gouverneurs des Bundesstaates, Greg Abbott, gehandelt, twitterte Trump am Freitag. Somit könnten jegliche Staatshilfen in Anspruch genommen werden.

Im August 2005 hatte der Kategorie-5-Hurrikan "Katrina" in den südöstlichen Bundesstaaten der USA am Golf von Mexiko schwere Schäden verursacht. Besonders der Großraum New Orleans war betroffen, aber auch weite Gebiete in Louisiana, Florida, Mississippi, Alabama und Georgia.

Hurricane Harvey's wallop on U.S. oil refiners is just beginning - 路透新闻

{{20170826T011330.546+0000}}Hurricane Harvey's wallop on U.S. oil refiners is just beginningBy Erwin Seba

HOUSTON, Aug 25 (Reuters) - Refiners from Corpus Christi, Texas, to Louisiana were working furiously to prepare for Hurricane Harvey which is packing winds of up to 130 miles per hour, and threatening "unprecedented" flooding, according to forecasters.

The storm on Friday had shut 4.4 percent of U.S. oil processing capacity, causing by one estimate a week's worth of product supply constraints. But up to a quarter of the nation's refining output lies in the path of the major Gulf Coast storm, according to current forecasts.[nL2N1LB077]

Refining staff were busy securing loose equipment, piling sandbags within plants and reviewing procedures for a shutdown if they became necessary, sources familiar with plant operations said on Friday.

Ride-out crews, who are specially trained to remain during storms, are hunkered down in control rooms monitoring systems at the Citgo Petroleum Corp [PDVSAC.UL], Flint Hills Resources [FHR.UL] and Valero Energy Corp's plants in South Texas, the sources said. The companies operate four refineries, three in Corpus Christi and another in nearby Three Rivers, Texas.

Since 2005 when hurricanes Katrina and Rita devastated the Gulf Coast, refiners have been hardening their plants to better sustain and recover from storms. For example, Phillips 66 erected a 4.5-mile flood wall to protect its Alliance, Louisiana facility.

Most refiners also have generators on raised platforms several feet off the ground or stationed off-site to provide power for repairs and to make preparations to restart after a loss of power.

But Katrina and Rita proved back-up equipment was not the only issue. Refineries near New Orleans were disrupted after several feet of water poured onto their properties.

Rita also took what was then BP Plc's Texas City, Texas, refinery out of operation for seven months after a sudden shutdown of its cogeneration plant caused extensive damage to 27 miles of steam piping.

Like the BP plant, refineries are most often shut after a hurricane by loss of utilities or supply systems.

On Thursday, LyondellBasell Industries reduced production at its Houston refinery to conserve crude oil supplies, sources said, in anticipation of the closure of the Houston Ship Channel. The channel was closed to vessel traffic on Friday.

Lyondell returned production to full on Friday afternoon after finding an additional supply of crude, the sources said.

To conserve its available crude, Marathon Petroleum Corp also reduced production at its 459,000 barrel-per-day Galveston Bay Refinery in Texas City, the former BP plant.

Aug 25 (Reuters) - Hurricane Harvey intensified on Friday into the most powerful hurricane
to hit the U.S. mainland in more than a decade, as authorities warned local residents to shelter
from what could be life-threatening winds and floods. [nL2N1LB077]

Refineries, terminals and other infrastructure have begun preparations or shutdown
procedures with the hurricane expected to make landfall on the central Texas coast between 8 pm
and 9 pm CDT (0100-0200 GMT).

Texas is home to 5.6 million barrels of refining capacity, and Louisiana has 3.3 million
barrels.

At least 1.1 million barrels of Gulf refining capacity is currently offline, including
refiners that had previously shut down due to other issues.

* Gouverneur: Evakuierungsaufrufen unbedingt Folge leisten

* Sechs Millionen Menschen und Hälfte der US-Raffinerien betroffen

(Neu: aktuelle Angaben zum Sturm, Evakuierungen, Warnungen)

- von Brian Thevenot

Corpus Christi, 25. Aug (Reuters) - Die Bewohner an der Golfküste von Texas haben sich am Freitag auf die Ankunft des wohl schwersten Hurrikans seit mehr als einem Jahrzehnt vorbereitet. Jetzt sei es dringend an der Zeit, sich vor dem Sturm in Sicherheit zu bringen, erklärte der Nationale Wetterdienst. Der Gouverneur des Bundesstaates, Greg Abbott, forderte die Bevölkerung auf, den Aufrufen der Behörden zur Evakuierung unbedingt Folge zu leisten: "Bringen Sie sich in Sicherheit, solange Sie noch können." Neben Texas rief auch Louisiana den Notstand aus. Die Regierung in Washington erklärte, sie stehe bereit, um im Katastrophenfall zu helfen. Präsident Donald Trump werde Anfang kommende Woche betroffene Gebiete besuchen.

Das Nationale Hurrikan-Zentrum (NHC) stufte "Harvey" am frühen Freitagnachmittag (Ortszeit) in die dritthöchste Sturmkategorie 3 ein. Seit "Wilma" im Oktober 2005 hat kein so starker Wirbelsturm mehr das US-Festland erreicht. Jüngsten Berechnungen zufolge sollte "Harvey" etwa um Mitternacht (07.00 Uhr MESZ Samstag) nahe Corpus Christi auf das Festland treffen. Die Windgeschwindigkeiten könnten dann mehr als 190 Kilometer pro Stunde überschreiten. Das NHC sprach von der Gefahr von "lebensbedrohlichen und katastrophalen Überschwemmungen".

In dem Gebiet von Corpus Christi bis Galveston leben knapp sechs Millionen Menschen, was etwa der Bevölkerung von Hessen entspricht. In der Region ist auch fast die Hälfte der US-Raffinerie-Kapazität angesiedelt, im Golf selbst knapp ein Fünftel der Öl-Produktion des Landes. Viele der Anlagen wurden vorsorglich geschlossen, darunter allein in Corpus Christi drei Raffinerien. Royal Dutch Shell, Anadarko und Exxon brachten Personal von den Förderinseln im Golf in Sicherheit.

Im August 2005 hatte der Kategorie-5-Hurrikan "Katrina" in den südöstlichen Bundesstaaten der USA am Golf von Mexiko schwere Schäden verursacht. Besonders der Großraum New Orleans war betroffen, aber auch weite Gebiete in Louisiana, Florida, Mississippi, Alabama und Georgia.

{{20170825T161156.928+0000}}FACTBOX-U.S. Gulf Coast energy infrastructure shutters, driving prices up(Adds refinery curtailments, price impacts)

By Jessica Resnick-Ault

Aug 24 (Reuters) - Hurricane Harvey intensified early on Friday
into potentially the most powerful hurricane to hit the U.S.
mainland in more than a decade, as authorities warned locals to
shelter from what could be life-threatening winds and floods.
[nL2N1LB077]

Refineries, terminals and other infrastructure have begun
preparations or shutdown procedures with the hurricane set to make
landfall on the central Texas coast late on Friday or early on
Saturday.

Texas is home to 5.6 million barrels of refining capacity, and
Louisiana has 3.3 million barrels.

At least 1.1 million barrels of Gulf refining capacity is
currently offline, including refiners that had previously shut down
due to other issues.

By Jessica Resnick-Ault

Aug 24 (Reuters) - Refineries, terminals and other
infrastructure have begun preparations or shutdown procedures
ahead of Hurricane Harvey, which is expected to make landfall as
a category 3 hurricane.

Texas is home to 5.6 million barrels of refining capacity,
and Louisiana has 3.3 million barrels.

At least 1.1 million barrels of Gulf refining capacity is
currently offline, including refiners that had previously shut
down due to other issues.

UPDATE 6-Hurricane Harvey threatens U.S. with most powerful storm in 12 years - Reuters News

* Could be most powerful storm to hit U.S. mainland since 2005

(Adds details on Louisiana declaration, President Trump monitoring situation, port closings and oil field impact)

By Jim Forsyth

SAN ANTONIO, Aug 24 (Reuters) - A Gulf of Mexico storm rapidly intensified on Thursday spinning into the potentially biggest hurricane to hit the mainland United States in 12 years and taking aim at the heart of nation's oil refining industry.

Hurricane Harvey is forecast to make landfall late Friday or early Saturday, packing winds of up to 125 miles per hour (201 km per hour). The storm could bring a surge in sea levels as high as 12 feet (3.7 meters) and dump up to 35 inches (97 cm) of rain over parts of Texas. Flood warnings are also in effect for northern Mexico and Louisiana.

The threat has triggered evacuations and canceled the first day of school in communities along the south Texas coast, which is home to 5.8 million people from Corpus Christi to Galveston.

Energy companies shut coastal refineries, pulled workers from Gulf of Mexico offshore oil platforms and halted onshore drilling in south Texas on Thursday. Just under 10 percent of offshore U.S. Gulf of Mexico crude output capacity and nearly 15 percent of natural gas production was halted by midday, government data showed.

Harvey is forecast to come ashore as a Category 3 hurricane, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said, the third most powerful on the Saffir-Simpson scale, which would make it the first major hurricane to hit the mainland United States since Hurricane Wilma struck Florida in 2005.

Louisiana and Texas issued disaster declarations, authorizing the use of state resources to prepare for the storm. The NHC expects Harvey to move slowly over Texas and linger over the state for days, dumping as much 35 inches (97 cm) of rain on some areas. Louisiana could see 10 to 15 inches of rain.

"With this system's intensity and slow motion, it is the worst of both worlds," said John Tharp, a forecaster with Weather Decision Technologies in Norman, Oklahoma. "There will be major impacts along the coast and inland with periods of prolonged rain."

Harvey will bring rains and a storm surge that will bring "life-threatening and devastating flooding" to parts of the Texas coast, the NHC said in an advisory.

President Donald Trump has been briefed on the storm and stands ready to provide resources if needed, the White House said on Thursday.

Houston, the nation's fourth most populous city, warned residents of flooding from close to 20 inches of rain over several days.

"I hope people will listen to forecasters when they say 'beware of flash floods,'" Corpus Christi Mayor Joe McComb told residents of the Texas city nearest to expected landfall. "Flash floods can come quickly, and they can be deadly."

GASOLINE PRICES SPIKE

The NHC expects the storm to come ashore along the central Texas coast, an area that includes Corpus Christi and Houston, home to some of the biggest refineries in the country.

More than 45 percent of the country's refining capacity is along the U.S. Gulf Coast, and nearly a fifth of the nation's crude oil is produced offshore in the region. Ports from Corpus Christi to Texas City, Texas, were closed to incoming vessels.

Harvey has already disrupted U.S. oil supplies in the region.

Three refineries in Corpus Christi and one farther inland at Three Rivers were shutting down ahead of the storm. Concern that Harvey could cause shortages in fuel supply drove benchmark gasoline prices to a three-week high.

One other refinery reduced output and others were considering shutting. [nL2N1LA147]

Prices for gasoline in spot physical markets on the Gulf Coast rose even more, hitting a one-year high.

Profit margins for refineries producing gasoline rose by over 12 percent, on course for their biggest daily percentage gain in six months, according to Reuters data. [nL2N1LA13D] [nL2N1LA0X8]

The four refineries shutting down have combined capacity to refine more than 840,000 barrels per day of crude.

Energy companies including Royal Dutch Shell Plc , Anadarko Petroleum Corp and Exxon Mobil Corp have evacuated staff from offshore oil and gas platforms in the storm's path. [nL2N1L91XY]

Around 167,000 barrels per day, or 9.6 percent, of crude output capacity in the Gulf was shut, the U.S. government said. Natural gas production of 472 million cubic meters per day, or 14.6 percent of output, also was halted, the U.S. reported.

The storm could also bring flooding to inland shale oil fields in southern Texas that produce more than one million barrels of oil a day.

EOG Resources Inc on Thursday said it has curtailed drilling and shut in some production in the Eagle Ford shale region. Noble Energy Inc and Statoil ASA also said it was evacuating some staff from production facilities in the region.[nL2N1LA190]

By Jim Forsyth

SAN ANTONIO, Aug 24 (Reuters) - U.S. gasoline prices surged to a three-week high on Thursday as Hurricane Harvey moved across the Gulf of Mexico and threatened to strike the heart of the country's oil refining industry when it comes ashore in Texas this weekend.

Communities in the path of the quickly strengthening storm began evacuating and energy firms shut refineries and offshore oil and gas platforms. Just under 10 percent of offshore U.S. Gulf of Mexico crude output capacity was shut down on Thursday, government data showed.

Harvey is forecast to come ashore as a Category 3 hurricane, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said, the third most powerful on the Saffir–Simpson scale, which would make it the strongest to hit the U.S. mainland in 12 years.

Such storms pack winds of up to 129 miles (208 km) per hour and Harvey would be the first Category 3 hurricane to make land in the United States since Hurricane Wilma struck Florida in 2005.

The NHC expects Harvey to move slowly over Texas and linger over the state for days, dumping as much 30 inches (76.2 cm) of rain on some areas.

"With this system's intensity and slow motion, it is the worst of both worlds," said John Tharp, a forecaster with Weather Decision Technologies in Norman, Oklahoma. "There will be major impacts along the coast and inland with periods of prolonged rain."

Harvey will cause a storm surge that will flood parts of the Texas coast as it makes landfall, the NHC said in an advisory.

The mayor of Texas coastal city Corpus Christi warned on Wednesday that flooding was his biggest concern and urged people to evacuate from low-lying areas.

"I hope people will listen to forecasters when they say 'beware of flash floods,'" Mayor Joe McComb said. "Flash floods can come quickly, and they can be deadly."

The city, a major oil refining center, has not issued any evacuation orders, he told reporters at a news conference, but its emergency operations center has been activated.

The NHC expects the storm to come ashore along the central Texas coast, an area that includes Corpus Christi and Houston, home to some of the biggest refineries in the country.

More than 45 percent of the country's refining capacity is along the U.S. Gulf Coast, and nearly a fifth of the nation's crude oil is produced offshore in the region.

Harvey has already disrupted U.S. oil supplies in the region.

Two oil refineries in Corpus Christi were shutting down ahead of the storm, and concern that Harvey could cause shortages in fuel supply drove benchmark gasoline prices to a three-week high.

The two refineries that have shut have combined capacity to refine more than 450,000 barrels per day of crude.

Energy companies including Royal Dutch Shell , Anadarko Petroleum and Exxon Mobil have evacuated staff from offshore oil and gas platforms in the storm's path. [nL2N1L91XY]

Around 167,000 barrels per day, or 9.6 percent, of crude output capacity in the Gulf was shut, the U.S. government said.

The storm could also bring flooding to inland shale oil fields in Texas that pump millions of barrels per day of crude.

Norwegian oil firm Statoil ASA said on Thursday it would evacuate staff from the Eagle Ford shale region in South Texas. The firm will close wells if there is a flooding risk, a spokesman said. [nL2N1LA190]

Texas Governor Greg Abbott declared a state of disaster on Wednesday for 30 counties, authorizing the use of state resources to prepare for the storm.

Coastal cities and counties distributed sandbags to residents as some businesses boarded up windows, and residents flocked to grocery stores to stock up on supplies, local media reported.

Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi issued a mandatory evacuation to all students who live on campus and canceled events.

HOUSTON, Aug 24 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil said on Thursday that it evacuated staff and shut its Galveston 209 platform and was also shutting in its Hadrian South subsea production system in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico ahead of Hurricane Harvey.

Roughly 9.5 percent of oil production in the Gulf of Mexico has been shut in, equating to around 167,200 barrels per day of oil, according to the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE).

* The U.S. gasoline crack spread , a key measure of refining margins, jumped nearly 7 percent on Thursday to $16.84 a barrel before modestly pairing gains.

* Royal Dutch Shell , Anadarko Petroleum and Exxon Mobil are curbing some oil and gas output in the Gulf of Mexico ahead of a storm expected to hit the Texas coast later this week.

Tropical storm Harvey heads for Texas, may become hurricane - Reuters News

{{20170824T083013.113+0000}}Tropical storm Harvey heads for Texas, may become hurricaneAug 24 (Reuters) - The Texas Gulf Coast was getting ready for the tropical storm Harvey to make landfall by Friday, bringing with it strong winds, heavy flooding and torrential rains.

Hurricane, tropical storm and storm surge watches were in effect for counties on the eastern coast of Texas as the storm moved across the Gulf of Mexico, where it may strengthen into a hurricane.

Winds up to 75 mph (120 km) and 15 inches of rain (40 cm) were forecast, according to the National Weather Service.

"Now is the time to check your emergency plan and take necessary actions to secure your home or business. Deliberate efforts should be underway to protect life and property," the weather service said in an statement early on Thursday.

By early Thursday morning, Harvey was about 410 miles (660 km) southeast of Port Mansfield, Texas, with maximum sustained winds of 45 miles per hour (70 kph), the U.S. National Hurricane Center said.

The storm may strengthen into a hurricane by the time it makes landfall near Corpus Christi on Friday, the National Weather Service said.

Governor Greg Abbott declared a state of disaster on Wednesday for 30 counties, authorizing the use of state resources to prepare for the storm. Harvey "poses a threat of imminent disaster, including severe flooding, storm surge and damaging winds," Abbott's statement said.

Cities and counties along the state's coastal region distributed sandbags to residents as some businesses boarded up windows. Coastal residents flocked to grocery stores to stock up on water and other supplies, local media reported.

Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi issued a mandatory evacuation to all students who live on campus and canceled events.

Royal Dutch Shell , Anadarko Petroleum and Exxon Mobil announced on Wednesday they were curbing some oil and gas output at facilities in the Gulf of Mexico ahead of the storm [nL2N1L91XY].

UPDATE 2-Oil companies evacuate workers as storm takes aim at Texas - Reuters News

{{20170824T032304.106+0000}}UPDATE 2-Oil companies evacuate workers as storm takes aim at Texas(Adds comments from Exxon Mobil in 4th paragraph.)

By Liz Hampton

HOUSTON, Aug 23 (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell , Anadarko Petroleum and Exxon Mobil announced they were curbing some oil and gas output on Wednesday at facilities in the Gulf of Mexico ahead of a storm expected to hit the Texas coast later this week.

The U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC) issued a hurricane watch Wednesday for much of the Texas coast, calling for slow-moving Tropical Depression Harvey to intensify as it nears landfall.

Shell said it was evacuating all personnel from the roughly 100,000 barrel-per-day (bpd) Perdido oil and gas production platform as a precaution. Anadarko said it had shut in production and was evacuating workers from its Boomvang, Gunnison, Lucius and Nansen platforms in the Gulf of Mexico.

Exxon was in the process of reducing production at its Hoover facility in the Gulf of Mexico, company spokeswoman Suann Guthrie said.

The company said it was also working on transportation plans for staged evacuation of its personnel from its offshore facilities, expected to be in the path of the storm, to shore.

The U.S. Gulf of Mexico is home to about 17 percent of the nation's crude oil output and 5 percent of dry natural gas output, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. More than 45 percent of the nation's oil refining capacity is along the U.S. Gulf Coast.

Harvey, which had top sustained winds of about 35 miles (55 km) per hour as it churned over Mexico's Bay of Campeche late Wednesday, could become a hurricane by Friday, the NHC said in an advisory.

Between 10 inches and 15 inches (25 cm to 38 cm) of rain are expected from the central Texas coast to southwest Louisiana, with some areas receiving up to 20 inches of rain, according to the Miami-based NHC.

"Heavy rainfall is likely to spread across portions of eastern Texas, Louisiana, and the lower Mississippi Valley from Friday through early next week and could cause life-threatening flooding," the NHC said.

Texas Governor Greg Abbott declared a state of disaster for 30 counties ahead of the storm.

In Corpus Christi, city officials warned residents to expect a storm surge of between four feet and six feet (1.83 m) and began distributing sand bags to local residents.

Other Gulf of Mexico oil and gas operators said they were watching developments closely but operations were unaffected.

Chevron on Wednesday afternoon said it had not evacuated any staff and BP Plc said normal operations were still underway. ConocoPhillips said it was making preparations but had not interrupted any operations.

UPDATE 1-Harvard researchers say Exxon misled public on climate science - Reuters News

{{20170823T201414.511+0000}}UPDATE 1-Harvard researchers say Exxon misled public on climate science(Adds background on study's funding, Exxon comment, researcher's comment)

By Emily Flitter

NEW YORK, Aug 23 (Reuters) - Two Harvard University researchers said in a study published on Wednesday they had collected data proving that Exxon Mobil Corp made "explicit factual misrepresentations" in newspaper ads it purchased to convey its views on the oil industry and climate science.

In an article in the journal Environmental Research Letters, researchers Geoffrey Supran and Naomi Oreskes said they examined 187 documents, including internal memos, peer-reviewed papers by Exxon scientists and "advertorials" that ran in The New York Times - paid advertisements in the style of opinion pieces. The researchers said they used a social science analysis method to turn statements in the documents into data points that could be counted and compared to each other.

Supran and Oreskes said that as early as 1979, Exxon scientists acknowledged burning fossil fuels was adding more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere and causing global temperatures to rise, but they said the company's position in newspaper ads remained significantly different by consistently asserting doubt about climate science.

The study was funded by the Rockefeller family philanthropies, which previously supported a campaign to prove Exxon knew more than it publicly admitted about climate change. That campaign used the slogan #ExxonKnew.

Exxon spokesman Scott Silvestri called the study "inaccurate and preposterous" and said the researchers' goal was to attack the company's reputation at the expense of its shareholders.

"Our statements have been consistent with our understanding of climate science," he said. He also noted that Oreskes spearheaded the #ExxonKnew campaign.

Oreskes said the Rockefeller family funding did not affect the study's outcome. She said the impetus for the study came from Exxon's responses to reports in InsideClimate News and the Los Angeles Times in September 2015 and October 2015, respectively, that Exxon's scientists had long known of the dangers fossil fuels posed to the earth's climate.

"They accused the journalists of cherry-picking," Oreskes said of Exxon's responses. "They also posted a collection of documents on their website. They said 'read the documents and make up your own mind.' We thought that was an excellent opportunity."

Oreskes and Supran pointed to a 2000 Exxon advertorial that said a U.S. government report on climate change put the "political cart before the horse" and was "based on unreliable models."

In his statement on Wednesday, Silvestri offered two examples from advertorials that Exxon had placed in The New York Times, both published in 2000, which he said showed the company did not try to cast doubt on climate change.

One statement read: "Enough is known about climate change to recognize it may pose a legitimate long-term risk and that more needs to be learned about it."

Nipco Plc raises stake in Nigerian fuel retailer  - Reuters News

{{20170823T155319.397+0000}}Nipco Plc raises stake in Nigerian fuel retailer LAGOS, Aug 23 (Reuters) - Nigerian fuel distributor Nipco Plc has bought another 3.23 percent stake in 11 Plc , the fuel retailer formerly known as Mobil Oil Nigeria, for 4.84 billion naira ($16 million) to increase its holding to 70 percent.

Nipco's investment subsidiary in October bought 60 percent of Mobil Oil Nigeria from Exxon Mobil Corp. , when the U.S. giant pulled out of downstream fuel distribution in Nigeria. [nFWN1CP0DJ]

Having amassed a stake of almost 67 percent, it wanted to increase that holding to around 70 percent. Under Nigerian takeover rules, it had to offer the same price of 417.12 naira per share to minority investors. [nL8N1JI4CU]

The downstream oil industry in Africa's biggest economy is consolidating as multinational oil firms sell out to focus on higher margin exploration and production following a drop in crude prices.

Nigeria exports nearly 2 million barrels of oil a day but imports the bulk of its refined products because its refining capacity is unable to meet the country's daily fuel needs of 40 million litres.

Mobil Oil Nigeria was founded in 1951 and operates more than 200 petrol stations in the country. It also owns three plants that manufacture lubricants, petroleum jelly, and insecticides in Nigeria's commercial capital of Lagos.

Supran and Oreskes said that while, as early as 1979, Exxon scientists acknowledged burning fossil fuels was adding more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere and causing global temperatures to rise, the company's position in newspaper ads remained significantly different by consistently asserting doubt about climate science.

Exxon spokesman Scott Silvestri said the researchers' study was "inaccurate and preposterous" and that their goal was to attack the company's reputation at the expense of its shareholders.

"Our statements have been consistent with our understanding of climate science," he said.

In an interview on Tuesday, Oreskes said the impetus for the study came from Exxon's responses to reports in InsideClimate News and the Los Angeles Times in September 2015 and October 2015, respectively, that Exxon's scientists had long known of the dangers fossil fuels posed to the earth's climate.

"They accused the journalists of cherry-picking," Oreskes said of Exxon's responses. "They also posted a collection of documents on their website. They said 'read the documents and make up your own mind.' We thought that was an excellent opportunity."

Oreskes and Supran pointed to ads such as a 1997 Mobil article that read "Let's face it: The science of climate change is too uncertain to mandate a plan of action that could plunge economies into turmoil." A 2000 advertorial said a U.S. government report on climate change put the "political cart before the horse" and was "based on unreliable models."

In his statement on Wednesday, Silvestri offered two examples from New York Times advertorials that Exxon bought, both published in the year 2000, which he said showed the company did not try to cast doubt on climate change.

"Enough is known about climate change to recognize it may pose a legitimate long-term risk and that more needs to be learned about it," one statement read.

{{20170823T084623.586+0000}}ABD'li petrol şirketi Chevron'un CEO'su görevini bırakacak, yeni CEO rafineri işlerinde uzman olabilir-KaynakErnest Scheyder

HOUSTON, 23 Ağustos (Reuters) - ABD'li petrol şirketi Chevron CEO'su John Watson'ın, Eylül ayı sonunda görevini bırakacağı bildirildi.

Konuya yakın bir kaynağın verdiği Reuters'a dün bilgiye göre Watson'ın yerine CEO'luğa büyük ihtimalle Yönetim Kurulu Başkan Yardımcısı Mike Wirth getirilecek.

Şirket yönetiminde beklenmeyen bu değişiklik, petrol ve doğalgaz üreticilerinin maliyetleri azaltma ve harcamaları kontrol altına almak için baskı altında bulunduğu bir dönemde gerçekleşiyor olacak.

CEO olması beklenen Wirth'in rafineri işletme konusunda tecrübesi bulunuyor.

Chevron yönetimindeki öngörülen bu değişiklik, rakip şirket Exxon Mobil Corp'un yaptıkları ile benzerlik gösteriyor. Exxon Mobil bu yılın başında rafineri işlerinde uzman bir yönetici olan Darren Woods'u CEO'luğa getirmişti.

Rafineri konusunda uzman isimlerin yöneticiliğe getirilmesi, uzmanlara göre büyük yatırım gerektiren petrol keşif işleri yerine hızlı nakit yaratan rafinasyon gibi alanlara ağırlık verileceğine ve şirketlerin temettüsünün artacağına işaret ediyor.

Enerji sektöründe Chevron'un diğer rakiplerinden Total ve Royal Dutch Shell şirketlerinin başkanları da petrol rafinasyon işlemlerine hakim yöneticilerden.

Le P-DG de Chevron va démissionner d'ici la fin du mois - sce - Reuters (French)

{{20170822T213902.023+0000}}Le P-DG de Chevron va démissionner d'ici la fin du mois - sceHOUSTON, 22 août (Reuters) - Le P-DG de Chevron John Watson va démissionner d'ici la fin du mois et il sera, selon toute vraisemblance, remplacé par Mike Wirth, actuel vice-président de la deuxième compagnie pétrolière américaine derrière Exxon Mobil , a dit à Reuters mardi une source proche du dossier.

Avant la clôture du marché actions américain, le Wall Street Journal avait le premier fait état de ce départ inattendu. L'action Chevron a terminé sur une hausse de 0,55% à 106,36 dollars, faisant moins bien que l'indice Dow Jones <.DJI> (+0,9%) dont elle fait partie.

Le porte-parole de Chevron a refusé de commenter l'information et ni John Watson ni Mike Wirth n'ont répondu à des requêtes de réaction.

Arrivé en janvier 2010 à la tête de Chevron, John Watson a privilégié la mise en oeuvre de projets qui étaient dans les tuyaux - comme des infrastructures GNL en Australie et une expansion des installations autour du golfe du Mexique - plutôt que de se lancer dans de grandes acquisitions.

Certains de ses projets se sont cependant avérés plus coûteux que prévu et des investisseurs estiment que Chevron est peut-être passé à côté d'opportunités de croissance.

L'action Chevron a augmenté de quelque 38% depuis la prise de fonctions de John Watson le 1er 2010, ce qui est mieux que le titre Exxon Mobil (+12,5%), mais nettement moins bien que le Dow Jones, qui a été multiplié par plus de deux sur la période.

BREAKINGVIEWS-Energy landscape is a battle for next Chevron CEO - Reuters Breakingviews

{{20170822T203303.625+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-Energy landscape is a battle for next Chevron CEO(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are her own.)

By Lauren Silva Laughlin

DALLAS, Aug 22 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Chevron is in the midst of changes. Chief Executive John Watson is planning to step down next month, according to Reuters, and he may be replaced by refining expert Michael Wirth. A new perspective may be warranted. Yet Chevron has weathered recent challenges decently. Any new boss, especially if home grown, will struggle with long-term industry headwinds.

If Wirth steps into the role Chevron will join rivals, including Exxon Mobil with its relatively new leader Darren Woods, in replacing old-school oil CEOs with people more familiar with downstream assets. With oil prices under pressure, the profitability of upstream drilling has dropped significantly. Oil chiefs have started to accept the idea that new discoveries and a shift of preferences and economics toward cleaner, more efficient, more climate-friendly sources of energy may prevent much in the way of increases. Last month Royal Dutch Shell boss Ben van Beurden said he wanted to ensure his company could handle "lower forever" oil prices if that's what materializes.

Chevron has felt the pain too. Revenue last year was only half of 2013's figure, and the company posted an annual loss. It has fared better than others, though, over both the long and short term. The company's stock price has increased roughly five percent over the last 10 years while competitors' shares have remained flat or fallen. Last quarter, Chevron's head start investing in the Permian shale in the United States started to pay off as it swung to profit and increased production.

Even so, earnings from downstream business were 40 percent bigger than those from upstream units last quarter. That poses longer term, structural problems. More than 80 percent of Chevron's assets are in upstream areas. The midstream business also depends on pulling hydrocarbons out of the ground. Whatever the focus on refining and the like, these other businesses still loom large.

The larger task for Chevron and rival oil majors is to rethink what being an energy company means. In one example, last week asset-management behemoth Vanguard, in a call with Reuters, said it would join other asset managers in asking companies to disclose more about the risks climate change poses, citing economics rather than ideology. It might take more than a different kind of oil-industry expertise to meet that kind of challenge.

CONTEXT NEWS

- Chevron Chief Executive John Watson is planning to step down from his role next month, according to Reuters, and will probably be replaced by Michael Wirth, the report said. The news was first reported by the Wall Street Journal, which added that the successor to Watson has not been finalized by the board and could change. Wirth is a refining specialist who was promoted to vice chairman at the beginning of the year.

LONDRES, 22 août (Reuters) - Total a ravi à Royal Dutch Shell la place de deuxième producteur de pétrole en mer du Nord avec son rachat des actifs norvégiens et britanniques de Maersk , qui illustre l'attrait que continue d'exercer cette zone de production pourtant largement arrivée à maturité.

L'opération de 7,45 milliards de dollars (6,3 milliards d'euros) a été largement saluée par les investisseurs et les analystes qui ont souligné qu'elle permettait à Total de rééquilibrer son portefeuille vers les pays développés après plusieurs opérations d'envergure dans des zones plus risquées comme l'Iran ou la Russie.

Elle permet aussi aux huit principales "majors" présentes en mer du Nord de repasser au dessus du seuil des trois quarts de la production totale qui y est réalisée.

Graphique : http://reut.rs/2g1Wzuq

Plusieurs d'entre elles ont toutefois cherché activement à se défaire de leurs gisements en mer du Nord, l'une des zones de production les plus matures au monde et où les développements sont compliqués par les coûts élevés de démantèlement des vieilles infrastructures.

Certains de ces actifs ont été achetés par des firmes d'investissement privées qui se sont nettement renforcées dans la zone, des acteurs Chrysaor et Siccar reprenant des gisements à Shell, à Engie ou à l'autrichien OMV .

Mais en dépit de près de 10 milliards de dollars d'opérations réalisées en mer du Nord au cours des deux dernières années, les société de capital investissement ("private equity") demeurent des acteurs secondaires avec moins de 10% de la production.

"Dans le contexte d'un marché mondial des cessions dominé par le pétrole non conventionnel américain et les sables bitumineux canadiens, une opération sur des actifs offshore conventionels apparaît comme une anomalie", relèvent dans une note des analystes d'UBS, qui ont relevé leur recommandation sur Total à "acheter" contre "neutre".

La banque d'investissement suisse souligne que les occasions de croissance externe en mer du Nord se raréfient car les grands groupes de services aux collectivités européens se sont désengagés de l'amont tandis que les "majors" ont vendus leurs actifs non stratégiques.

"La vente d'un autre actif en mer du Nord qui était sur le marché associé à l'engagement clair de Total dans la zone, souligne que la compétition pour des actifs pourrait rester forte en dépit de cours du pétrole déprimés", prévient UBS.

GRAPHIC-Total overtakes Shell in North Sea where appetite for assets remains high - Reuters News

{{20170822T130744.769+0000}}GRAPHIC-Total overtakes Shell in North Sea where appetite for assets remains high* Majors still control three quarter of output

* After $10 bln of deals, private equity still plays modest role

* North Sea still generates good price due low political risks

By Dmitry Zhdannikov

LONDON, Aug 22 (Reuters) - French oil major Total has overtaken rival Royal Dutch Shell to become the second-largest producer in the North Sea with its acquisition of Maersk's Norwegian and UK producing assets.

The $7.45 billion deal by Total was welcomed by the market, with analysts saying it helped the French company rebalance its portfolio by adding assets in developed countries after going for projects in riskier places such as Iran and Russia. [nL8N1L70XF]

The deal boosts the share of eight global oil majors in the North Sea - Statoil, Total, Shell, Exxon Mobil , Conoco , ENI and Chevron - to back above three quarters of total output.

Several oil majors have been actively looking to divest fields in the North Sea - one of the most mature global oil provinces where future developments will be complicated by high decommissioning costs of old infrastructure.

Some assets have been bought by private equity firms which have expanded significantly in the region, with companies such as Chrysaor and Siccar acquiring fields from Shell, Austria's OMV and France's Engie. [nL8N1ID244] [nL5N1FL1B4] [nL8N1D976X]

But despite around $10 billion worth of deals in the North Sea over the past two years, private equity firms remain fairly small players with their total share still below 10 percent.

On Tuesday, UBS analysts upgraded Total to "Buy" from "Neutral" after the Maersk deal, saying Total bought the assets at an average price of $7.3 per barrel of oil resources, implying a long-term Brent price of $62 per barrel.

"In the context of a global asset market dominated by U.S. unconventional and Canadian oil sands transactions this year, a conventional offshore deal stands out as an anomaly," UBS said.

It said that opportunities for inorganic growth in the North Sea were beginning to diminish because EU utilities have fully divested of the upstream sector while oil majors have also largely sold out their non-core portfolios.

"The sale of another North Sea focused portfolio that was on the market, combined with Total's clear commitment to the basin, emphasises that competition for assets could remain high in spite of depressed oil prices," UBS said.

UPDATE 2-Fire breaks out at Exxon's refinery in Rotterdam, Netherlands  - 路透新闻

{{20170821T231158.965+0000}}UPDATE 2-Fire breaks out at Exxon's refinery in Rotterdam, Netherlands (Adds Exxon statement, refinery details)

Aug 21 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp said on Monday a fire broke out at its refinery in Rotterdam but that there were no injuries and most of the facility remained operational.

The fire erupted in the powerformer unit of the complex and some flaring occurred to reduce pressure, Exxon said, adding it was cooperating with local emergency personnel.

The complex can process about 190,000 barrels per day and the rest of the refining units and a connected chemical plant were still online, Exxon said.

"We regret the incident and any inconvenience caused to the community," Exxon spokeswoman Ellen Ehmen said in an emailed statement.

The fire came the same day that a blaze broke out at a Royal Dutch Shell refinery in the Netherlands. That fire was quickly contained. [nL8N1L74G3]

Exxon last year started a $1 billion, three-year expansion of the Rotterdam refinery to boost production of lubricants and other chemicals. According to a proposal for the expansion filed with Dutch authorities, hydrocracking capacity at the plant would increase by 40 percent to about 70,000 barrels per day.

Shares of Exxon Mobil were unchanged on the New York Stock Exchange in after-hours trading after closing at $76.38.

CORRECTED-U.S. funds get tougher on climate and diversity, but not CEO pay - Reuters News

{{20170821T201215.475+0000}}CORRECTED-U.S. funds get tougher on climate and diversity, but not CEO pay(Corrects institute name in paragraph 6 to Investor Responsibility Research Center Institute, not Investor Responsibility Resource Center Institute)

By Ross Kerber

BOSTON, Aug 21 (Reuters) - Even as top U.S. asset managers BlackRock Inc and State Street Corp pressed companies on climate and diversity issues this year, they made few waves on another area of corporate governance: CEO pay.

Researcher Proxy Insight estimates BlackRock supported management in advisory "Say on Pay" votes at S&P 500 companies 97 percent of the time during the proxy season ended June 30, one percentage point lower than in the previous year, based on a review of voting tallies by eight outside funds that are voted by BlackRock.

Funds voted by a unit of State Street supported executive pay 94 percent of the time this year, also one percentage point lower than in the previous season, based on a similar review of early tallies. More complete filings are due in coming weeks.

The continued strong support helps explain how CEO pay keeps rising, part of a broader debate over inequality, even as large corporations changed their stances on climate and social issues under pressure from investors.

BlackRock for instance has already disclosed it switched sides and helped pass a measure on climate risk reporting at Exxon Mobil Corp's annual meeting in May. State Street says it voted against directors at 400 companies this year that had no female board members and showed no signs of changing, part of a campaign for gender diversity that also included the placement of the famed "Fearless Girl" statue on Wall Street.

Jon Lukomnik, head of the Investor Responsibility Research Center Institute, a frequent critic of pay designs, said the statistics reflect how it is often hard for large fund managers to vote against pay because the issues can be more complex than on other governance issues.

Factors that could influence a pay vote include a company's bonus metrics or the peers it measures pay against. "If you vote 'no' on executive comp, does it mean you don't like how it is structured? Or you don't like the total amount? It's more of a continuum," Lukomnik said. "When it's a close call, they tend to vote 'yes'."

The median S&P 500 CEO was paid $12.1 million last year, up from $11 million among the same group in the previous year, according to ISS Analytics.

To be sure, the S&P 500 index's 9.5 percent rise in 2016 made it easier for many boards to justify pay raises for their leaders. Ira Kay, a corporate pay consultant, said the fact that companies win the vast majority of the advisory votes on pay, even as they lose on other issues, shows their pay plans work as designed.

"The vast majority of shareholders at the vast majority of companies are highly satisfied with their pay and performance alignment," Kay said.

A spokesman for BlackRock declined to comment before its more complete voting data is disclosed in coming weeks. BlackRock has said it expects companies to tie pay to long-term performance and that it may vote against directors when companies have not demonstrated such a connection.

A State Street representative sent data showing that its funds supported pay plans about 94 percent of the time in the first six months of 2017, roughly the same rate as in the same period a year earlier, across more than 2,000 companies in each year.

Technically State Street funds voted "against" pay at more companies this year, 140, than in the first half of 2016 when it voted 'against' pay at 131 companies.

The higher number shows State Street's concerns about "quantum of pay," meaning the overall level of pay, said Rakhi Kumar, State Street's head of governance via e-mail.

BREAKINGVIEWS-Energy landscape is a battle for next Chevron CEO - Reuters Breakingviews

{{20170822T203303.625+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-Energy landscape is a battle for next Chevron CEO(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are her own.)

By Lauren Silva Laughlin

DALLAS, Aug 22 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Chevron is in the midst of changes. Chief Executive John Watson is planning to step down next month, according to Reuters, and he may be replaced by refining expert Michael Wirth. A new perspective may be warranted. Yet Chevron has weathered recent challenges decently. Any new boss, especially if home grown, will struggle with long-term industry headwinds.

If Wirth steps into the role Chevron will join rivals, including Exxon Mobil with its relatively new leader Darren Woods, in replacing old-school oil CEOs with people more familiar with downstream assets. With oil prices under pressure, the profitability of upstream drilling has dropped significantly. Oil chiefs have started to accept the idea that new discoveries and a shift of preferences and economics toward cleaner, more efficient, more climate-friendly sources of energy may prevent much in the way of increases. Last month Royal Dutch Shell boss Ben van Beurden said he wanted to ensure his company could handle "lower forever" oil prices if that's what materializes.

Chevron has felt the pain too. Revenue last year was only half of 2013's figure, and the company posted an annual loss. It has fared better than others, though, over both the long and short term. The company's stock price has increased roughly five percent over the last 10 years while competitors' shares have remained flat or fallen. Last quarter, Chevron's head start investing in the Permian shale in the United States started to pay off as it swung to profit and increased production.

Even so, earnings from downstream business were 40 percent bigger than those from upstream units last quarter. That poses longer term, structural problems. More than 80 percent of Chevron's assets are in upstream areas. The midstream business also depends on pulling hydrocarbons out of the ground. Whatever the focus on refining and the like, these other businesses still loom large.

The larger task for Chevron and rival oil majors is to rethink what being an energy company means. In one example, last week asset-management behemoth Vanguard, in a call with Reuters, said it would join other asset managers in asking companies to disclose more about the risks climate change poses, citing economics rather than ideology. It might take more than a different kind of oil-industry expertise to meet that kind of challenge.

CONTEXT NEWS

- Chevron Chief Executive John Watson is planning to step down from his role next month, according to Reuters, and will probably be replaced by Michael Wirth, the report said. The news was first reported by the Wall Street Journal, which added that the successor to Watson has not been finalized by the board and could change. Wirth is a refining specialist who was promoted to vice chairman at the beginning of the year.

GRAPHES-Total devance Shell en Mer du Nord, la concurrence reste vive - Reuters (French)

LONDRES, 22 août (Reuters) - Total a ravi à Royal Dutch Shell la place de deuxième producteur de pétrole en mer du Nord avec son rachat des actifs norvégiens et britanniques de Maersk , qui illustre l'attrait que continue d'exercer cette zone de production pourtant largement arrivée à maturité.

L'opération de 7,45 milliards de dollars (6,3 milliards d'euros) a été largement saluée par les investisseurs et les analystes qui ont souligné qu'elle permettait à Total de rééquilibrer son portefeuille vers les pays développés après plusieurs opérations d'envergure dans des zones plus risquées comme l'Iran ou la Russie.

Elle permet aussi aux huit principales "majors" présentes en mer du Nord de repasser au dessus du seuil des trois quarts de la production totale qui y est réalisée.

Graphique : http://reut.rs/2g1Wzuq

Plusieurs d'entre elles ont toutefois cherché activement à se défaire de leurs gisements en mer du Nord, l'une des zones de production les plus matures au monde et où les développements sont compliqués par les coûts élevés de démantèlement des vieilles infrastructures.

Certains de ces actifs ont été achetés par des firmes d'investissement privées qui se sont nettement renforcées dans la zone, des acteurs Chrysaor et Siccar reprenant des gisements à Shell, à Engie ou à l'autrichien OMV .

Mais en dépit de près de 10 milliards de dollars d'opérations réalisées en mer du Nord au cours des deux dernières années, les société de capital investissement ("private equity") demeurent des acteurs secondaires avec moins de 10% de la production.

"Dans le contexte d'un marché mondial des cessions dominé par le pétrole non conventionnel américain et les sables bitumineux canadiens, une opération sur des actifs offshore conventionels apparaît comme une anomalie", relèvent dans une note des analystes d'UBS, qui ont relevé leur recommandation sur Total à "acheter" contre "neutre".

La banque d'investissement suisse souligne que les occasions de croissance externe en mer du Nord se raréfient car les grands groupes de services aux collectivités européens se sont désengagés de l'amont tandis que les "majors" ont vendus leurs actifs non stratégiques.

"La vente d'un autre actif en mer du Nord qui était sur le marché associé à l'engagement clair de Total dans la zone, souligne que la compétition pour des actifs pourrait rester forte en dépit de cours du pétrole déprimés", prévient UBS.

GRAPHIC-Total overtakes Shell in North Sea where appetite for assets remains high - Reuters News

{{20170822T130744.769+0000}}GRAPHIC-Total overtakes Shell in North Sea where appetite for assets remains high* Majors still control three quarter of output

* After $10 bln of deals, private equity still plays modest role

* North Sea still generates good price due low political risks

By Dmitry Zhdannikov

LONDON, Aug 22 (Reuters) - French oil major Total has overtaken rival Royal Dutch Shell to become the second-largest producer in the North Sea with its acquisition of Maersk's Norwegian and UK producing assets.

The $7.45 billion deal by Total was welcomed by the market, with analysts saying it helped the French company rebalance its portfolio by adding assets in developed countries after going for projects in riskier places such as Iran and Russia. [nL8N1L70XF]

The deal boosts the share of eight global oil majors in the North Sea - Statoil, Total, Shell, Exxon Mobil , Conoco , ENI and Chevron - to back above three quarters of total output.

Several oil majors have been actively looking to divest fields in the North Sea - one of the most mature global oil provinces where future developments will be complicated by high decommissioning costs of old infrastructure.

Some assets have been bought by private equity firms which have expanded significantly in the region, with companies such as Chrysaor and Siccar acquiring fields from Shell, Austria's OMV and France's Engie. [nL8N1ID244] [nL5N1FL1B4] [nL8N1D976X]

But despite around $10 billion worth of deals in the North Sea over the past two years, private equity firms remain fairly small players with their total share still below 10 percent.

On Tuesday, UBS analysts upgraded Total to "Buy" from "Neutral" after the Maersk deal, saying Total bought the assets at an average price of $7.3 per barrel of oil resources, implying a long-term Brent price of $62 per barrel.

"In the context of a global asset market dominated by U.S. unconventional and Canadian oil sands transactions this year, a conventional offshore deal stands out as an anomaly," UBS said.

It said that opportunities for inorganic growth in the North Sea were beginning to diminish because EU utilities have fully divested of the upstream sector while oil majors have also largely sold out their non-core portfolios.

"The sale of another North Sea focused portfolio that was on the market, combined with Total's clear commitment to the basin, emphasises that competition for assets could remain high in spite of depressed oil prices," UBS said.

UPDATE 2-Fire breaks out at Exxon's refinery in Rotterdam, Netherlands  - 路透新闻

{{20170821T231158.965+0000}}UPDATE 2-Fire breaks out at Exxon's refinery in Rotterdam, Netherlands (Adds Exxon statement, refinery details)

Aug 21 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp said on Monday a fire broke out at its refinery in Rotterdam but that there were no injuries and most of the facility remained operational.

The fire erupted in the powerformer unit of the complex and some flaring occurred to reduce pressure, Exxon said, adding it was cooperating with local emergency personnel.

The complex can process about 190,000 barrels per day and the rest of the refining units and a connected chemical plant were still online, Exxon said.

"We regret the incident and any inconvenience caused to the community," Exxon spokeswoman Ellen Ehmen said in an emailed statement.

The fire came the same day that a blaze broke out at a Royal Dutch Shell refinery in the Netherlands. That fire was quickly contained. [nL8N1L74G3]

Exxon last year started a $1 billion, three-year expansion of the Rotterdam refinery to boost production of lubricants and other chemicals. According to a proposal for the expansion filed with Dutch authorities, hydrocracking capacity at the plant would increase by 40 percent to about 70,000 barrels per day.

Shares of Exxon Mobil were unchanged on the New York Stock Exchange in after-hours trading after closing at $76.38.

CORRECTED-U.S. funds get tougher on climate and diversity, but not CEO pay - Reuters News

{{20170821T201215.475+0000}}CORRECTED-U.S. funds get tougher on climate and diversity, but not CEO pay(Corrects institute name in paragraph 6 to Investor Responsibility Research Center Institute, not Investor Responsibility Resource Center Institute)

By Ross Kerber

BOSTON, Aug 21 (Reuters) - Even as top U.S. asset managers BlackRock Inc and State Street Corp pressed companies on climate and diversity issues this year, they made few waves on another area of corporate governance: CEO pay.

Researcher Proxy Insight estimates BlackRock supported management in advisory "Say on Pay" votes at S&P 500 companies 97 percent of the time during the proxy season ended June 30, one percentage point lower than in the previous year, based on a review of voting tallies by eight outside funds that are voted by BlackRock.

Funds voted by a unit of State Street supported executive pay 94 percent of the time this year, also one percentage point lower than in the previous season, based on a similar review of early tallies. More complete filings are due in coming weeks.

The continued strong support helps explain how CEO pay keeps rising, part of a broader debate over inequality, even as large corporations changed their stances on climate and social issues under pressure from investors.

BlackRock for instance has already disclosed it switched sides and helped pass a measure on climate risk reporting at Exxon Mobil Corp's annual meeting in May. State Street says it voted against directors at 400 companies this year that had no female board members and showed no signs of changing, part of a campaign for gender diversity that also included the placement of the famed "Fearless Girl" statue on Wall Street.

Jon Lukomnik, head of the Investor Responsibility Research Center Institute, a frequent critic of pay designs, said the statistics reflect how it is often hard for large fund managers to vote against pay because the issues can be more complex than on other governance issues.

Factors that could influence a pay vote include a company's bonus metrics or the peers it measures pay against. "If you vote 'no' on executive comp, does it mean you don't like how it is structured? Or you don't like the total amount? It's more of a continuum," Lukomnik said. "When it's a close call, they tend to vote 'yes'."

The median S&P 500 CEO was paid $12.1 million last year, up from $11 million among the same group in the previous year, according to ISS Analytics.

To be sure, the S&P 500 index's 9.5 percent rise in 2016 made it easier for many boards to justify pay raises for their leaders. Ira Kay, a corporate pay consultant, said the fact that companies win the vast majority of the advisory votes on pay, even as they lose on other issues, shows their pay plans work as designed.

"The vast majority of shareholders at the vast majority of companies are highly satisfied with their pay and performance alignment," Kay said.

A spokesman for BlackRock declined to comment before its more complete voting data is disclosed in coming weeks. BlackRock has said it expects companies to tie pay to long-term performance and that it may vote against directors when companies have not demonstrated such a connection.

A State Street representative sent data showing that its funds supported pay plans about 94 percent of the time in the first six months of 2017, roughly the same rate as in the same period a year earlier, across more than 2,000 companies in each year.

Technically State Street funds voted "against" pay at more companies this year, 140, than in the first half of 2016 when it voted 'against' pay at 131 companies.

The higher number shows State Street's concerns about "quantum of pay," meaning the overall level of pay, said Rakhi Kumar, State Street's head of governance via e-mail.

EXCLUSIVE-Bank jitters over Venezuela stall oil delivery to U.S. refiner - Reuters News

{{20170817T193246.966+0000}}EXCLUSIVE-Bank jitters over Venezuela stall oil delivery to U.S. refiner(Adds background on Venezuelan finances, paragraphs 2-6)

By Marianna Parraga

MEXICO CITY, Aug 17 (Reuters) - A tanker carrying a cargo of about 1 million barrels of Venezuelan heavy crude has been stranded for more than a month off the coast of Louisiana for lack of a bank letter of credit to discharge, three sources have told Reuters.

The cargo's fate adds to state-run oil company PDVSA's precarious financial position. Revenue from the company's oil sales, which have suffered because of low prices and declining production, account for more than 90 percent of the nation's exports.

Major banks are cutting exposure to Venezuela as a result of political upheaval in the South American country. Some have closed accounts linked to officials of the OPEC member who have had sanctions leveled against them by the U.S. government and have refused to provide correspondent bank services or trade in government bonds.

Credit Suisse this month barred operations involving certain Venezuelan bonds and is now requiring that business with President Nicolas Maduro's government and related entities undergo a reputation risk review.

The United States is considering further economic sanctions that would dry up the country's access to Wall Street. [nL1N1KD00M]

PDVSA and its joint ventures exported 638,325 barrels per day (bpd) to the United States in July, 22 percent less than the same month of 2016, according to Thomson Reuters Trade Flows data.

A GUARANTEE FOR DELIVERY

The tanker Karvounis carrying Venezuelan oil is anchored at South West Pass off the coast of Louisiana, according to Reuters vessel tracking data. PBF Energy Inc , the intended buyer of the cargo, has been trying unsuccessfully to find a bank willing to provide a letter of credit to discharge the oil, according to two trading and shipping sources.

Crude sellers typically request letters of credit from customers that guarantee payment within 30 days after a cargo is delivered. The documents must be issued by a bank and received before the parties agree to discharge.

It was not immediately clear which banks have denied letters of credit or if other U.S. refiners are affected.

PBF Energy spokesman Michael Karlovich would not confirm any details about the cargo, saying: "We treat commercial and logistics arrangements as business confidential information."

PDVSA did not reply to a request for comment.

The tanker loaded in late June at the Caribbean island of St. Eustatius where PDVSA rents storage tanks, and has been waiting for authorization to discharge since early July, according to four trading sources and Reuters data.

CASH BUYERS

PDVSA's cash flow has shrunk in recent years due to extended deals to barter its oil for refined products, services and loans. Chinese and Russian entities currently take about 40 percent of all PDVSA's exports as repayment for over $60 billion in loans to Venezuela and the company in the last decade, according to a Reuters analysis of its sales. This has left U.S. refiners among the few remaining cash buyers.

Some banks have continued working with Venezuela. In May, Goldman Sachs purchased $2.8 billion of Venezuelan debt bonds at steep discount, a move criticized by the Venezuelan opposition and other banks. [nL1N1KW1QL]

But as more banks look to reduce their exposure to Venezuela, the situation is affecting PDVSA's payments to bondholders and its routine oil sales and purchases, according to bank and trade sources. [nL1N1DM1OK] [nL1N1970BU]

The Karvounis was chartered by Trafigura [TRAFG.UL], the Reuters data shows. Since last year, the trading firm has been marketing an increasing volume of Venezuelan oil received from companies such as Russia's Rosneft , which lift and then resell PDVSA's barrels to monetize credits extended to Venezuela, according to traders and PDVSA's internal documents.

Some barrels get sold on the open market, others are supplied to typical PDVSA's customers including U.S Gulf Coast refiners.

PBF and PDVSA have a long-term supply agreement for Venezuelan oil signed in 2015 when PBF bought the 189,00-bpd Chalmette refinery from PDVSA and ExxonMobil Corp .

The U.S. refiner received three cargoes for a total of 1.58 million barrels last month, the lowest figure since February. Other U.S. refineries such as Phillips 66 did not receive any cargo.

In early August, PBF's Chalmette refinery received 514,000 barrels of Venezuelan DCO on tanker Ridgebury Sally B, the Reuters data say.

A second delivery got stuck on tanker Karvounis.

EXCLUSIVE-Bank jitters over Venezuela stall oil delivery to U.S. refiner - Reuters News

{{20170817T180430.729+0000}}EXCLUSIVE-Bank jitters over Venezuela stall oil delivery to U.S. refinerBy Marianna Parraga

MEXICO CITY, Aug 17 (Reuters) - A tanker carrying a cargo of about 1 million barrels of Venezuelan heavy crude has been stranded for more than a month off the coast of Louisiana for lack of a bank letter of credit to discharge, three sources have told Reuters.

The tanker's fate is just the latest sign of state-run oil company PDVSA's precarious financial position. Major banks are cutting exposure to Venezuela as a result of political upheaval in the South American country.

Some banks have closed accounts linked to officials of the OPEC member who have had sanctions leveled against them by the U.S. government and have refused to provide correspondent bank services or trade in government bonds. The United States is considering further economic sanctions that would dry up the country's access to Wall Street. [nL1N1KD00M]

The Suezmax tanker Karvounis carrying Venezuelan diluted crude oil is anchored at South West Pass off the coast of Louisiana, according to Reuters vessel tracking data. PBF Energy Inc , the intended recipient of the cargo, has been trying unsuccessfully to find a bank willing to provide a letter of credit to discharge the oil, according to two trading and shipping sources.

It was not immediately clear which banks have denied letters of credit or if other U.S. refiners are affected.

PBF Energy spokesman Michael Karlovich would not confirm any details about the cargo, saying: "We treat commercial and logistics arrangements as business confidential information."

PDVSA did not reply to a request for comment.

The tanker loaded in late June at the Caribbean island of St. Eustatius where PDVSA rents storage tanks, and has been waiting for authorization to discharge since early July, according to four trading sources and Reuters data.

Crude sellers typically request letters of credit from customers that guarantee payment within 30 days after a cargo is delivered. The documents must be issued by a bank and received before the parties agree to discharge.

PDVSA's cash flow has shrunk in recent years due to extended deals to barter its oil for refined products, services and loans. Chinese and Russian entities currently take about 40 percent of all PDVSA's exports as repayment for over $60 billion in loans to Venezuela and the company in the last decade, according to a Reuters analysis of its sales. This has left U.S. refiners among the few remaining cash buyers.

Credit Suisse this month barred operations involving certain Venezuelan bonds and is now requiring that business with President Nicolas Maduro's government and related entities undergo a reputation risk review. In May, Goldman Sachs purchased $2.8 billion of Venezuelan debt bonds at steep discount, a move criticized by the Venezuelan opposition and other banks. [nL1N1KW1QL]

Some barrels are offered on the open market, others are supplied to typical PDVSA's customers including U.S refiners.

PDVSA and its joint ventures exported 638,325 barrels per day (bpd) to the United States in July, 22 percent less than the same month of 2016, according to Thomson Reuters Trade Flows data.

UPDATE 1-Oil producers signal offshore return in latest Gulf of Mexico auction - Reuters News

{{20170816T181130.027+0000}}UPDATE 1-Oil producers signal offshore return in latest Gulf of Mexico auction(Adds statement from Wood Mackenzie analyst)

By Liz Hampton

HOUSTON, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Major oil producers pushed up high bids at a Gulf of Mexico offshore auction to $121 million on Wednesday, a nearly seven-fold increase from a year ago, as their return to deep water exploration gained momentum.

This compared with $18 million in high bids at the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management's (BOEM) Outer Continental Shelf auction last summer.

Winners will be announced after a 90-day review.

Some producers have signaled that they expect Gulf of Mexico projects to become more profitable now that they have trimmed operations to adapt to low oil prices. Offshore drilling typically requires higher prices for producers to break even.

Royal Dutch Shell claimed the largest number of blocks, with 19 high bids valued at a combined $25.1 million. Chevron Corp followed with 15 high bids totaling $27.9 million. Anadarko Petroleum Corp won 10 blocks for $10.6 million. Exxon Mobil Corp took seven blocks of land for $20.4 million.

Most of the bids were for deep water blocks, at depths of more than 1,600 meters. The auction drew interest from 27 oil companies, with 99 bids on 90 blocks in the Gulf of Mexico, according to the BOEM.

"The deepwater industry is emphasizing short-cycle, low-risk prospects above high-impact, wildcat drilling," said William Turner, a senior analyst at consultancy Wood Mackenzie.

Some bids by Chevron, Shell and Total were "a vote of confidence in higher-risk, standalone, developments with potential for higher rewards," he added.

The auction offered 14,177 blocks totaling 75.9 million acres, but only 508,000 received bids, according to the BOEM. This year's auction covered Western, Central and Eastern areas of the gulf. The year-earlier auction was only for the Western region.

The sale offered nearly 76 million acres of land off the shores of Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida.

A sale of offshore blocks in March attracted $275 million in winning bids, a similar surge from a year ago.

Wednesday's sale was the first of 10 planned as part of the new Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing Program for 2017 to 2022.

U.S. benchmark oil prices have held stubbornly below $50 a barrel for much of this year, despite efforts by global producers to curb production and boost prices.

Many parts of the Gulf of Mexico need oil above $50 a barrel for producers to cover costs, with the deepest parts of the Gulf requiring around $65 a barrel to break-even, according to Wood Mackenize.

UPDATE 2-Australia's Woodside cashed up for long-term growth as profit soars - Reuters News

{{20170816T070146.256+0000}}UPDATE 2-Australia's Woodside cashed up for long-term growth as profit soars* H1 profit jumps 49 pct to $507 mln

* Woodside sitting on $2.6 bln in cash, untapped debt

* Woodside eyes increased Scarborough stake

(Adds CEO, analyst comments)

By Sonali Paul

MELBOURNE, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Woodside Petroleum reported a 49 percent jump in half-year profit on Wednesday, buoyed by higher oil prices and lower costs, and said it was making progress on plans to develop its gas assets off Western Australia.

Australia's biggest independent oil and gas producer said it has a war chest of $2.6 billion in cash and untapped credit to develop stakes in the Scarborough and Browse fields off Western Australia, expand its Pluto liquefied natural gas (LNG) project and develop prospects in Myanmar and Senegal.

"We're living within our means," Coleman told analysts on a conference call. "We're moving our growth projects on nicely."

Those projects all face challenges, however, and even if they go ahead as planned, they will only bear fruit beyond 2021, with the company still short of near-term growth prospects.

"They're not without risk," said Citi analyst Dale Koenders.

Australia's biggest independent oil and gas producer posted a net profit for the six months to June of $507 million, up from $340 million a year ago, buoyed by higher realised prices and lower costs.

The company announced an interim dividend of 49 cents per share, up from 34 cents a share a year ago.

The result was below the average of four analysts' forecasts at around $534 million, but investors sent the company's shares up as much as 6 percent to a two-month high.

Coleman said Woodside is well-positioned to fill a gap in global LNG supply expected to emerge around 2022, but its growth plans hinge on complex talks with oil and gas majors like Shell , ExxonMobil Corp and Chevron Corp , whose priorities may lie elsewhere.

One way Woodside could help align the interests of the owners of gas sources and existing LNG infrastructure would be to increase its holding in the Scarborough field from 25 percent by engineering an exit from the project for ExxonMobil.

ExxonMobil, which wants to develop Scarborough as a floating LNG project, declined to comment on speculation that it is looking to sell its 50 percent share. The stake could fetch around $800 million, based on the price Woodside paid BHP for 25 percent.

Coleman said if it were up for sale, Woodside would be interested - just not in all of it.

"It's difficult for me to see Woodside carrying Scarborough 75 percent, so please don't scare our shareholders," he told Reuters in an interview.

UPDATE 3-Vanguard seeks corporate disclosure on risks from climate change - Reuters News

{{20170814T210233.921+0000}}UPDATE 3-Vanguard seeks corporate disclosure on risks from climate change(Adds details on Booraem's staff, outreach and voting)

By Ross Kerber

BOSTON, Aug 14 (Reuters) - Vanguard Group on Monday said it has urged companies to disclose how climate change could affect their business and asset valuations, reflecting how the environment has become a priority for the investment industry.

Under pressure from investors, Vanguard and other fund companies have pushed to pass several high-profile shareholder resolutions on climate risk at big energy firms like Exxon Mobil Corp and Occidental Petroleum Corp during the spring proxy season.

Vanguard manages about $4 trillion and is often the top shareholder in big U.S. corporations through its massive index funds - giving it a major voice in setting corporate agendas.

Vanguard, the biggest U.S. mutual fund firm by assets, had not supported climate activists on similar measures. But Glenn Booraem, Vanguard's investment stewardship officer, said in a telephone interview on Monday the issue as well as shareholder proposals have evolved.

"Our support for these proposals is not a matter of ideology, it's a matter of economics," he said. "To the extent there are significant risks to a company's long-term value proposition, we want to make sure there is long-term disclosure of those risks to the market."

Vanguard earlier this year changed its proxy voting policies to give more leeway to support resolutions tied to climate risk, but until now it has given few details about its thinking unlike rivals State Street Corp or BlackRock Inc .

Vanguard also plans to disclose more details about its talks with companies on issues such as gender diversity on corporate boards.

Booraem said Vanguard does not hear from many of its 20 million investors on governance. He said their views on the environment and diversity, run "along the entire spectrum. That's why we want to approach it from the economic perspective."

Booraem now oversees a staff of more than 20 people focused on governance matters, and said company executives are generally forthcoming about the subjects that once received little corporate attention. "Companies are increasingly receptive to the outreach," he said.

Booraem declined to discuss the reasoning behind Vanguard's votes at Exxon and elsewhere until the tallies are made public in filings due later this month.

He cautioned that upcoming filings detailing Vanguard's overall voting during the spring proxy season would not show much change compared to past years, and declined to discuss future votes it might cast. The firm previously did not support any climate proposals that were opposed by management, and only backed a few this year. Funds run by State Street backed climate resolutions about half the time last year, according to researcher Proxy Insight.

Vanguard's stance and promise of more disclosures prompted activist fund firm Walden Asset Management of Boston to withdraw a shareholder proposal for its upcoming fund meetings, requesting a review of Vanguard's proxy voting.

Walden is "pleased" with the changes, but they have not gone far enough, said Tim Smith, the firm's director of shareowner engagement. Walden will continue to press Vanguard and other fund managers on climate change and other issues, he said.

{{20170811T184705.789+0000}}UPDATE 1-Exxon Baytown FCCU 2 operating normally -sources(Adds company statement, background air blower)

HOUSTON, Aug 11 (Reuters) - The small gasoline-producing fluidic catalytic cracking unit at ExxonMobil Corp's 560,000 barrel-per-day Baytown, Texas, refiner was operating normally on Friday following a Thursday malfunction, said sources familiar with plant operations.

Exxon spokeswoman Charlotte Huffaker said an event at Baytown refinery reported to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality had ended with minimal impact to production. She did not identify the unit involved and declined to provide further details.

The 90,000 bpd FCCU 2 lost the primary air blower on Thursday for a brief period, triggering flaring at the refinery, according to a notice filed with the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality on Friday.

The air blower is a key piece of equipment on a cat cracker, the failure of which prevents the unit from performing the reactions between catalyst and gas oil to produce gasoline.

Indonesia mulls changes to crude price basket; Banyu Urip ICP eyed - Reuters News

{{20170810T114132.568+0000}}Indonesia mulls changes to crude price basket; Banyu Urip ICP eyedJAKARTA/SINGAPORE, Aug 10 (Reuters) - Indonesia is evaluating its existing crude oil benchmarks, and has identified the Banyu Urip grade as possibly one that could replace Arjuna ICP, a senior government official said.

"Relating to Banyu Urip crude to be the benchmark crude to replace Arjuna, at this time it's still being evaluated by the technical team," Ego Syahrial, Director General of Oil and Gas at the energy ministry, said.

The earliest decision could come in December, but not later than next June, Syahrial added.

In the meantime, Indonesia will keep its existing Indonesia Crude Price (ICP) formula unchanged.

Monthly ICPs for the key benchmark grades: Minas, Duri, Widuri, Cinta, Arjuna, Attaka, Belida and Senipah condensate are currently calculated by applying a differential to dated Brent quotes published by oil price agency S&P Global Platts.

Indonesia changed to its current pricing formula in July 2016, the first change to the formula since 2007. [nL4N1A61QI]

While Indonesia has not explicitly stated how it calculates its monthly price differential to dated Brent, market participants say the differentials track the average of price quotes published by Platts and Japanese energy information provider RIM Intelligence.

RIM Intelligence is the only oil pricing agency to publish a price for Banyu Urip crude. Platts did not immediately reply to a query on whether it would start a Banyu Urip price assessment.

The Banyu Urip field, operated by ExxonMobil and located in the Cepu block in East Java, first began exporting cargoes in early 2015. Output from the project stands around 200,000 barrels per day (bpd) and is crucial to Indonesia, which faces declining production from aging wells. [nJ9N1A702A]

"A switch from Arjuna makes sense because Banyu Urip has a bigger production," an analyst from a Western firm said.

The grade is also offered on the spot market more regularly than other benchmark Indonesian grades and has a broad customer base as refiners in Thailand, China, Singapore and Malaysia have purchased the grade, Thomson Reuters trade flows data shows.

HOUSTON, Aug 8 (Reuters) - Houston-area oil refineries were unaffected by heavy rains that caused flooding across wide areas of the city Monday night and Tuesday morning, the companies and industry sources said on Tuesday.

Rainfall totals over 7 inches (17.8 cms ) were recorded by the Harris County Flood Warning System in the past 24 hours. Houston police reported 24 rescues from high water by Tuesday evening.

Exxon Mobil Corp's Baytown, Texas, refinery; Royal Dutch Shell Plc's joint-venture Deer Park, Texas, refinery, LyondellBasell Industries' Houston refinery and Phillips 66's Sweeny, Texas, refinery were operating normally as of Tuesday afternoon, company representatives said.

Sources said Marathon Petroleum Corp's Galveston Bay and Texas City refineries in Texas City, Texas, were operating normally.

A spokesman for Marathon declined to discuss operations at the company's refineries in Texas City, as did a Valero Energy Corp spokeswoman asked about the company's Houston and Texas City refineries.

A Petrobras spokeswoman did not reply to a message about the company's Pasadena, Texas, refinery.

Athènes lance deux appels d'offres pétroliers et gaziers - Reuters (French)

{{20170807T132522.093+0000}}Athènes lance deux appels d'offres pétroliers et gaziersATHENES, 7 août (Reuters) - La Grèce a lancé deux appels d'offres lundi pour la prospection et l'exploitation de gisements de pétrole et de gaz offshore dans l'ouest et le sud du pays, a annoncé le ministère de l'Energie.

Cette décision intervient à la suite des marques d'intérêt manifestées par un consortium regroupant Total , Exxon Mobil et Hellenic Petroleum en vue d'explorer deux sites au large de la Crète, et par le groupe grec Energean pour un autre bloc situé dans la mer Ionienne.

Les groupes disposeront de 90 jours pour soumettre leur offre à Hellenic Hydrocarbons Resources Management (HHRM) à partir de la date de publication de l'appel d'offres dans le journal officiel de l'Union européenne.

La Grèce a mené plusieurs tentatives infructueuses au cours des 50 dernières années pour trouver d'importantes réserves de pétrole et de gaz. Depuis la crise de la dette, elle redouble d'efforts pour y parvenir, encouragée par les récentes découvertes de gaz au large d'Israël et de Chypre.

En mai, le gouvernement a confié une concession pour l'exploration de deux sites dans l'ouest du pays à Hellenic Petroleum, le premier raffineur du pays. Energean, un groupe privé, en a également obtenu une.

Energean est actuellement le seul producteur de pétrole offshore en Grèce. Sa production s'élevait à 3.500 barils par jour en 2016.

Greece launches new offshore oil and gas tenders  - Reuters News

{{20170807T123503.297+0000}}Greece launches new offshore oil and gas tenders ATHENS, Aug 7 (Reuters) - Greece launched two tenders on Monday for offshore oil and gas exploration and exploitation in the west and south of the country, the energy ministry said.

The move follows expressions of interest by a consortium of Total , Exxon Mobil and Hellenic Petroleum for exploration in two sites off the island of Crete, and by Greece's Energean for a block in the Ionian Sea in western Greece.

Investors will have 90 days to submit offers to the Hellenic Hydrocarbons Resources Management (HHRM) from when the announcement is published in the European Union's official gazette.

Greece has launched a program to discover more oil and gas, encouraged by recent large gas finds off Israel and Cyprus and spurred on by its protracted financial crisis.

In May it granted a concession to Hellenic Petroleum for onshore exploration at two sites in the west of the country, and to privately held Energean for another block.

Energean is currently the country's only offshore oil producer, in northeastern Greece, with an average production of 3,500 barrels per day last year.

RPT-Higher-cost crude could squeeze margins at U.S. refiners - 路透新闻

{{20170807T100005.097+0000}}RPT-Higher-cost crude could squeeze margins at U.S. refiners(Repeats with no changes)

By Erwin Seba

HOUSTON, Aug 7 (Reuters) - U.S. refiners could face a continued squeeze on profit margins in the months ahead as dwindling supplies of heavy crude from Venezuela and elsewhere are leading several to switch to higher-priced but easier-to-refine light, sweet crude.

The shift also could mean higher prices for consumers in the last weeks of the summer driving season and into the fall if refiners are able to pass along those higher costs to drivers, analysts said.

PBF Energy Inc , Valero Energy Corp , Phillips 66 and Marathon Petroleum Corp said in earning calls over the past two weeks they are running more light crude as a result of narrower discounts for heavy crude. ExxonMobil Corp also is running a heavier slate of light crude at a Gulf Coast plant. [nL1N1KN1AC] [nL1N1KI1IU]

Refiners' "margins have already been heavily impacted," said John Auers, executive vice president at refining consultancy Turner, Mason & Co. "They will be impacted in the third quarter" as well, Auers said. The final period's outlook could depend on whether the U.S. applies sanctions on Venezuelan imports, he added.

In part, the companies are reacting to high costs and anticipating weaker supplies of Venezuelan crude coming to the United States. Heavy crude prices also have been impacted by tax changes in Russia that have raised prices of its heavy crudes and by reduced production from Canada last quarter.

Through June, U.S. imports of Venezuelan crude declined 7.1 percent compared with the same six month period last year, to 654,078 barrels per day (bpd), according to Reuters data.

Light, sweet crude costs more than heavier oils, narrowing the discount that U.S. refiners, especially those along the Gulf Coast, have gained by configuring their plants to run heavy, sour crude over the past 20 years.

Marathon's second-quarter income from its refining and marketing operations fell in part due to "unfavorable crude oil and feedstock acquisition costs, primarily due to lower sweet/sour crude oil price differentials," the company said on Thursday.

PBF also said narrower heavy crude discounts contributed to its second quarter loss of $1.01 a share, compared to Wall Street expectations of a 2-cent a share gain.

Exxon is studying adding a light crude-processing unit at its Beaumont, Texas, refinery early in the next decade, spokeswoman Charlotte Huffaker said this week. It would be the second light-crude processing unit at the plant.

"These investments reflect the increased availability of abundant, affordable supplies of U.S. light crude," Huffaker said in an email. [nL1N1KQ04L]

Valero and Phillips beat analysts' estimates, Valero by 13 cents at $1.23 a share and Phillips by 5 cents at $1.06 a share.

Other factors could balance the higher crude cost in the coming months, such as strong global demand for U.S. refined products, said Andrew Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates in Houston.

"Prices are going up because we're seeing the impact of the cuts by OPEC and non-OPEC countries," Lipow said.

Neil Earnest, president of Dallas energy consultancy Muse, Stancil & Co, said changes in the price of crude could also affects refiners' margins ahead.

"They don't move in lockstep," Earnest said. "It may, however, impact a refiner who has customized a process to run heavy crude. That refiner may see narrower margins."

EXCLUSIVE-Exxon mulls Beaumont refinery crude unit addition - 路透新闻

{{20170804T041557.584+0000}}EXCLUSIVE-Exxon mulls Beaumont refinery crude unit addition(Adds detail, background)

By Erwin Seba

HOUSTON, Aug 3 (Reuters) - ExxonMobil Corp is considering expanding light crude processing capacity at its Beaumont, Texas, refinery with the addition of a third crude distillation unit, a company spokeswoman said on Thursday.

If approved, construction could begin on Unit C in 2019 and be completed in 2022, said Exxon spokeswoman Charlotte Huffaker. She declined to disclose the contemplated capacity or possible cost of the Unit C expansion.

"These investments reflect the increased availability of abundant, affordable supplies of U.S. light crude," Huffaker said.

The expansion would be part of the $20-billion 'Growing the Gulf' project announced in March by Exxon Chairman and Chief Executive Darren Woods.

While Exxon has mentioned potential expansion of light oil refining capacity at the Beaumont plant as part of that project, this is the first time the company has talked about Unit C and given a timeline for possible construction.

Since at least 2014, Exxon has been considering the addition of a large distillation unit that would boost Beaumont's crude oil refining capacity from 362,300 barrels per day (bpd) to between 700,000 and 850,000 bpd, sources told Reuters in 2014 and 2015.

The contemplated crude capacity expansion was put on hold in early 2016 due to cuts in capital spending, sources said at the time.

On Thursday night, sources familiar with Exxon's plans said the company was now looking at adding a large crude distillation unit at the refinery.

The two crude units currently at the Beaumont refinery are Units A and B.

The last major expansion of a U.S. refinery was the 5-year, $10-billion addition of a crude distillation unit and other units at Motiva Enterprises [MOTIV.UL] Port Arthur, Texas, refinery which more than doubled its size to 603,000 bpd. The expansion was completed in 2012.

The Motiva expansion was originally budgeted at $5 billion, but went through a year-long review in 2009. Last year, Exxon added 20,000 bpd in light crude refining capacity to Unit A at the Beaumont refinery, Huffaker said.

BP's west Africa partner Kosmos to list in London by end-September - Reuters News

{{20170802T104022.986+0000}}BP's west Africa partner Kosmos to list in London by end-SeptemberLONDON, Aug 2 (Reuters) - Kosmos Energy , which is exploring for gas offshore Senegal and Mauritania with oil major BP , will list on the London Stock Exchange by the end of September in a bid to attract more European investors, it said on Wednesday.

Kosmos, which has been listed in New York since 2011, announced a major gas find in partnership with BP off the coast of Senegal in May, boosting the area's reputation as one of the world's hotbeds for gas exploration.

The company also owns parts of licences to drill for oil offshore Suriname in South America close to where U.S. oil major Exxon Mobil and its partners recently decided to go ahead with a $4.4 billion oilfield megaproject. [nL3N1JD3UC]

Kosmos expects its London listing to attract more European investors seeking exposure to promising oil and gas exploration.

"There are a number of European investment funds and specialist international oil and gas investors that are currently unable to hold Kosmos' shares due to their listing outside of a European regulated market," the company said, explaining the rationale for its London secondary listing.

The process is expected to complete later in the third quarter, it said.

Kosmos estimates its licences offshore Senegal and Mauritania could hold more than 50 trillion cubic feet of gas resources and it continues to drill further.

"Kosmos offers exposure to an ongoing high-impact, three-well exploration campaign that could more than double its valuation – it is our favourite high-impact explorer," said analysts at RBC Capital Markets who rate the stock as 'outperform'.

ANALYSE-Warum Putin Vergeltung gegen US-Sanktionen scheut - Reuters (German)

{{20170802T095941.695+0000}}ANALYSE-Warum Putin Vergeltung gegen US-Sanktionen scheut* Experten: Wirtschaftlicher Gegenschlag eher unwahrscheinlich

* Putin hat die Präsidentschaftswahl 2018 im Auge

* Analyst: Russland braucht ausländische Investoren

- von Alexander Winning

Moskau, 02. Aug (Reuters) - Der russische Bär brüllt, aber er beißt nicht: Die Regierung in Moskau reagiert auf die neuen Wirtschaftssanktionen der USA bislang auffallend zurückhaltend. Zwar sorgt die Entscheidung, dass die Amerikaner 755 ihrer 1200 diplomatischen Mitarbeiter abziehen müssen, für Schlagzeilen. Vor harten wirtschaftlichen Vergeltungsmaßnahmen schreckt Präsident Wladimir Putin aber bislang zurück - und wird diese angesichts der schwächelnden Konjunktur nach Einschätzung von Experten auch nicht anordnen, um sich nicht ins eigene Fleisch zu schneiden.

Schon 2014, als die USA und die Europäische Union erste Sanktionen nach der russischen Annexion der Halbinsel Krim beschlossen, reagierte Moskau vergleichsweise sanft: Hauptsächlich wurden westliche Importe von Lebensmitteln begrenzt. "Der Kopf hat entschieden, nicht das Herz - und ich gehe davon aus, dass es diesmal genauso sein wird", sagt Analyst Chris Weafer vom Beratungshaus Macro-Advisory in Moskau. "Irgendetwas wird kommen, was den USA zu schaffen macht, aber nicht die Bemühungen des Kreml unterlaufen wird, internationale Investoren anzulocken und die Wirtschaft wachsen zu lassen."

Während das Bruttoinlandsprodukt in dem Schwellenland unter Putin lange um mehr als fünf Prozent jährlich zulegte, schrumpfte es sowohl 2015 als auch 2016. In diesem Jahr wird ein Plus von 1,4 Prozent erwartet. Putin braucht eine gute Wirtschaft im Rücken, um bei der Präsidentschaftswahl im März 2018 eine überzeugende Mehrheit zu erringen. Doch heimische Unternehmen zögern derzeit mit Investitionen. Sie sind verunsichert, inwieweit die neuen US-Strafmaßnahmen ihr Geschäft berührten, erklärt Putin-Berater Alexej Kudrin, früher Finanzminister seines Landes.

US-Präsident Donald Trump hatte am Wochenende angekündigt, er werde das Sanktionsgesetz trotz heftiger Kritik aus Europa unterschreiben. Die USA begründen die Strafmaßnahmen mit der Krim-Annexion und der mutmaßlichen russischen Einflussnahme auf den US-Präsidentschaftswahlkampf im vergangenen Jahr.

FIRMEN-KOOPERATIONEN VOR ALLEM IM ENERGIEBEREICH

Angesichts der Verunsicherung unter heimischen Unternehmen sind ausländische Investitionen umso wichtiger. Putin betonte zuletzt im Staatsfernsehen zwar, man könne Washington in "Bereichen, die empfindlich für die amerikanische Seite sind", treffen. Derzeit sei dies aber nicht notwendig. "Das würde nicht nur die russisch-amerikanischen Beziehungen belasten, es würde auch bei uns einigen Schaden anrichten", so der Präsident.

Beide Seiten arbeiten besonders in den Bereichen Energie und Luftfahrt zusammen. Der US-Konzern ExxonMobil etwa ist Partner der russischen Ölfirma Rosneft beim Ölfeld vor der ostsibirischen Insel Sachalin. Umgekehrt soll mit Rosneft gemeinsame Sache in Nordamerika und Mosambik gemacht werden. Der weltgrößte Titan-Produzent VSMPO-Avisma liefert bis zu 40 Prozent dieses vom US-Flugzeugbauer Boeing benötigten Rohstoffs. Beide betreiben zwei Gemeinschaftsunternehmen in Russland. Es gilt aber als unwahrscheinlich, dass Putin hier die Geschäftsbeziehungen beschädigen wird. Sein Land braucht den Zugang zu westlicher Technologie, um beispielsweise die Produktion seines größten Exportschlagers Öl zu halten.

"Ausländische Investitionen bringen nicht nur Geld, sondern auch immaterielle Vorteile wie ein besseres Management, Wissen, Technologietransfers", sagt William Jackson, Volkswirt beim Finanzhaus Capital Economics. "Das trägt zur Steigerung von Produktivität und dem Lebensstandard bei." Dessen dürfte sich Putin bewusst sein, der seine bislang hohen Zustimmungswerte auch besseren Lebensbedingungen für viele Russen während seiner ersten Amtszeit verdankt. "Putin wird auch im Schlaf ein Auge auf die Wähler haben", ist sich Analyst Weafer deshalb sicher.

TABLE-U.S. crude exports to remain at elevated levels in coming weeks - 路透新闻

{{20170801T174733.526+0000}}TABLE-U.S. crude exports to remain at elevated levels in coming weeksAug 1 (Reuters) - U.S. crude exports are set to be at elevated levels in coming weeks as Brent's premium over
U.S. crude recently widened to its most in two months.

Brent's premium over WTI  widened to as much as $2.92 a barrel on Friday, the most since May 22,
ahead of the expiration of the Brent September contract. Brokers added that competitive shipping rates to the East
from the U.S. Gulf has raised interest from foreign refiners.

Meanwhile, crude exports in the week to July 21 topped 1 million barrels per day, the most since the end of May
when it touched a record 1.3 million bpd, according to U.S. Energy Information Administration data.

Fragile economy stays Putin's hand in stand-off with U.S. - Reuters News

{{20170801T160716.555+0000}}Fragile economy stays Putin's hand in stand-off with U.S.* U.S. lawmakers approve new sanctions on Russia

* Russia responds by ordering U.S. cut diplomatic staff

* Weak economy prompts Putin to tread cautiously

* Russia holds presidential vote in 2018

By Alexander Winning

MOSCOW, Aug 1 (Reuters) - Russian leader Vladimir Putin is unlikely to risk an escalating round of tit-for-tat sanctions with Washington because the only measures that would hurt the United States would also endanger Russia's fragile economic recovery.

Russia last week ordered Washington to cut 755 of its 1,200 embassy and consular staff and said it was seizing two diplomatic properties, after U.S. lawmakers backed a new round of economic sanctions on Moscow. [nL5N1KM3ZT]

Though an eye-catching gesture, Russia's response does not pack the same punch as the U.S. penalties, which target Russian energy projects, make it harder for U.S. President Donald Trump to ease earlier sanctions, and could further restrict lending to Russia. [nL5N1KH694]

That partly reflects the fact that Russia has relatively few ways of hurting the United States, whose economy is around 14 times larger than Russia's.

It also reflects worries in the Kremlin about the health of the economy ahead of a presidential election in March.

In 2014, when the United States and European Union imposed an earlier round of sanctions over Moscow's annexation of the Crimea peninsula from Ukraine, the Kremlin's main response was to limit Western food imports, a comparatively soft measure.

"It was a case of the head overruling the heart and I expect exactly the same response this time," said Chris Weafer, senior partner at Macro-Advisory consultancy in Moscow. "Something which will cause some discomfort for the U.S. but which will not derail the Kremlin's efforts to attract international investors and grow the economy."

Weafer said Putin would probably take further retaliatory steps against Washington after Trump signs the new sanctions into law but he did not think the Kremlin would target U.S. firms with close ties to Russia.

Putin has not said whether he will fun for a fourth presidential term in 2018, but officials expect him to do so.

Whereas Putin oversaw several years of growth above 5 percent in his early presidential terms, the Russian economy contracted in 2015 and 2016 and is seen growing only 1.4 percent this year. [nL5N1KM53X]

Putin needs a strong economy if he is to win a convincing mandate, and the Kremlin has tried to show that Russia is open for foreign business despite tensions with the West.

Domestic Russian investors have only cautiously increased investment as the economy has recovered from recession, making foreign inflows more important.

An adviser to Putin, ex-finance minister Alexei Kudrin, told Reuters last week that domestic investors needed certainty that sanctions would not continue to be ratcheted up, otherwise the economic outlook would be weak. [nL5N1KG4OA]

RESTRICTING COOPERATION

Putin said in an interview aired on state TV on Sunday that Russia could restrict cooperation with Washington in "areas which would be sensitive to the American side" but he did not think that was yet necessary.

"That would not only hurt Russian-American relations, it would also inflict some damage on us," Putin said.

Analysts cite energy and aviation as two sectors where Russia and the United States work closely and where Russian penalties could affect U.S. firms.

U.S. energy giant ExxonMobil is a partner of Russian oil firm Rosneft in the Sakhalin 1 project off Russia's far east coast and has agreed to team up with Rosneft in North America and Mozambique. [nL8N1JB3HK]

Russia's VSMPO-Avisma, the world's largest titanium producer, supplies up to 40 percent of U.S. planemaker Boeing's titanium under long-term contracts, and the two firms have a joint venture in Russia.

In both cases, however, Putin is unlikely to bow to pressure from hawks in his administration and sever business ties.

Russia wants access to the technological know-how of firms like Exxon to help it maintain production of oil, its chief export, close to post-Soviet highs. It is also trying to revive its domestic aviation industry, which Boeing can help.

"What foreign investment does is that it not only brings money, it brings intangible benefits in terms of better management, knowledge, transfers of technology and that helps to raise productivity and living standards," said William Jackson, senior emerging market economist at Capital Economics.

Putin, who built his high approval ratings on the rapid rise in Russians' living standards during his first two terms, will be conscious of this when deciding on any further retaliation.

"So far Putin has been a lot more measured in his response than the demands of the nationalists," Weafer said.

For all his power, Putin "sleeps with one eye on the voters", Weafer added.

European oil majors seek to harness U.S. offshore wind - Reuters News

{{20170801T095756.002+0000}}European oil majors seek to harness U.S. offshore wind* Statoil, Shell, DONG Energy turn to U.S. offshore wind

* Oil firms bring big budgets, offshore tech and risk experience

* Projects will need major investment, supply chains

By Karolin Schaps and Susanna Twidale

LONDON, Aug 1 (Reuters) - Some European oil majors have made inroads into the emerging U.S. offshore wind energy market, aiming to leverage their experience of deepwater development and the crowded offshore wind arena at home.

Late entrants to the offshore wind game in Europe, which began with a project off Denmark 25 years ago and is now approaching maturity, they are looking across the Atlantic at what they view as a huge and potentially lucrative new market.

Norway's Statoil has won a licence to develop a wind farm of the New York coast, is marketing its new floating turbine to California and Hawaii and is retraining some oil and gas staff to work in its wind division.

Royal Dutch Shell bid for a lease offshore North Carolina earlier this year while Denmark's DONG Energy, a wind energy pioneer which agreed to sell its oil and gas business in May, is in a Massachusetts-based offshore wind consortium, holds a lease off the New Jersey coast and has opened an office in Boston.

Offshore wind generation began in the United States late last year, ironically after the election of President Donald Trump. He is sceptical about climate change, complains about subsidies for renewable energy and battled against an offshore wind farm near his Scottish golf resort.

However, a string of federal seabed leases were awarded before Trump took office and more are planned. [L5N1KM40R] The investment needed to get projects going is one of the biggest obstacles.

"Undeniably, offshore wind is a big boys' game because it requires large amounts of capital because scale is such an important cost driver," said Samuel Leupold chief executive of DONG Energy's offshore wind business.

While DONG has shifted decisively towards renewables, Statoil and Shell are still firmly rooted in fossil fuels and other major European oil companies, in common with their U.S. counterparts, have so far steered clear of U.S. offshore wind.

Washington estimates its potential at 2,000 gigawatts (GW), many times anticipated capacity in Europe of 25 GW by 2020, but U.S. federal subsidies expire at the end of 2019 and while they may be renewed by Congress, that is no means certain.

Costs in Europe have fallen to a level that enabled DONG to place a zero subsidy bid earlier this year, but offshore wind farms are still multi-billion dollar projects. A push into deeper U.S. waters and the bigger turbines needed to compete without subsidies will keep price tags high.[nL8N1JJ2OL]

EARLY DAYS

Trump signed an executive order in March expected to roll back his predecessor Barack Obama's plan requiring states to slash carbon emissions from power plants. There is also no carbon price mechanism across the United States like those in Europe and elsewhere, although there are two regional ones.

U.S. oil companies have some investments in solar and onshore wind, but when it comes to offshore wind, many say they are waiting for a time when government support is not needed.

"Chevron supports renewables that are scalable and can compete without subsidies," said Morgan Krinklaw, a spokesman for Chevron, which owns an onshore wind farm.

A report from analysts at Lazard in December pegged the cost of U.S. offshore wind at $118 MWh, around twice as much as onshore wind or combined-cycle gas turbines.

Asked to comment on that figure, Statoil, which is building its first floating wind turbine park off the Scottish coast, said costs were coming down and it was working to drive them down further, partly by redeploying existing staff.

The company has about 1,000 employees in the U.S. oil industry, said Stephen Bull, senior vice president of the company's wind business. "There's scope for us to plug into our existing oil and gas supply chain," he added, referring to existing contracts with equipment and service suppliers.

Statoil spokeswoman Elin Isaksen said she did not expect any of its offshore wind projects in the U.S. to have begun construction by 2019 and that it was too early to quote numbers for the New York project, while acknowledging there was, as yet, no supply chain.

"We expect to see – and will help - the supply chain evolve rapidly in step with the broader industry as offshore wind takes hold in the U.S. in the coming years," she said.

In Virginia, where Spanish utility Iberdrola's Avangrid has secured an offshore wind licence, a rich marine engineering heritage is expected to help local companies gain work. Smaller European oil and gas firms are also gaining work.

JDR Cable Systems, a British company that has traditionally supplied subsea power lines to oil and gas platforms, earlier this year won a $275 million contract to provide electric cables for the largest U.S. offshore wind farm off the Maryland coast.

"We are well placed to develop business in the U.S. because of the existing relationships we have in Europe," said John Price, global sales director for renewables at JDR.

State level decision-making on electricity procurement, the next stage of getting offshore wind off the ground, is helping.

Massachusetts, where DONG has secured a seabed license, last year issued a law requiring its utilities to buy up to 1.6 GW of offshore wind power by June 2027, with a tender to be held later this year.

DONG's North America wind power president Thomas Bostrom said it would bid in the Massachusetts power purchase tender in December and would not comment on costs ahead of that. He too, emphasised his company was playing the long game.

"As excited as we are for offshore wind in the U.S., we are still in the early days of the industry," Bostrom said.

Abschreibungen in Angola kosten BP Gewinn - Reuters (German)

{{20170801T081006.444+0000}}Abschreibungen in Angola kosten BP GewinnLondon, 01. Aug (Reuters) - Abschreibungen auf kostspielige, aber nicht erfolgreiche Öl-Erkundungen in Angola haben dem Ölmulti BP das zweite Quartal vermiest. Im Vergleich zum Jahresauftakt halbierte sich der Nettogewinn auf 684 Millionen Dollar, wie der britische Konzern am Dienstag mitteilte. Der Gewinnrückgang fiel jedoch weniger stark aus, als der Markt befürchtet hatte. Insgesamt hält sich bei BP angesichts des wieder steigenden Ölpreises die Zuversicht. In diesem Jahr sollen sieben neue Förderprojekte starten, so viele wie noch nie in einem Jahr. Im dritten Quartal werde die Produktion jedoch in etwa stabil bleiben, da sich neue Projekte und Ausfälle wegen Wartungsarbeiten die Waage hielten.

Die Kosten will BP-Chef Bob Dudley auch weiterhin unter Kontrolle halten. Während des Ölpreisverfalls hatten die Ölmultis teils drastische Sparprogramme aufgelegt. Davon profitieren sie nun, auch wenn der Ölpreis inzwischen wieder auf rund 50 Dollar angezogen ist. Dank dieser Erholung machen US-Konkurrenten wie Exxon und Chevron wieder Milliardengewinne.[nL5N1KJ5DG] Auch die großen europäischen Energie- und Ölkonzerne fahren wieder kräftige Gewinne ein.[nL5N1KI24Z]

July 31 (Reuters) - The Dow Jones Industrial Average hit a record closing high on Monday, helped by Boeing, while selling in Facebook, Alphabet and other technology companies checked the S&P 500 and pulled the Nasdaq lower.

The S&P 500 information technology <.SPLRCT> dipped 0.53 percent, with Facebook falling 1.86 percent and Alphabet , Google's parent company, down 1.34 percent.

"The bull market is sort of broadening out and people are taking a few profits off the table on some of these stocks that have done exceedingly well," said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives for Charles Schwab in Austin, Texas.

Boeing rose 0.49 percent and hit a record high of $242.46 after JPMorgan raised its price target on the world's biggest plane maker to $280 per share.

The market reacted little to news that U.S. President Donald Trump's communications director, Anthony Scaramucci, was leaving the job after little over a week, the latest staff upheaval to hit the Republican's six-month-old presidency. [nL1N1KM0ON]

In July, the S&P 500 rose 1.9 percent, the Dow added 2.5 percent and the Nasdaq gained 3.4 percent.

Apple Inc , which is expected to report quarterly results after the market close on Tuesday, dipped 0.51 percent.

Investors have been counting on earnings to support high valuations for equities. [nL1N1KJ1RJ]

S&P 500 earnings are expected on average to have grown 10.8 percent in the second quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

"The market in the last week has become jittery," said Dennis Dick, head of markets structure, proprietary trader at Bright Trading LLC in Las Vegas. "Money managers are looking to take profits and for any excuse to do so."

The Dow Jones Industrial Average <.DJI> rose 0.28 percent to end at 21,891.12 points and the S&P 500 <.SPX> lost 0.07 percent to 2,470.3. The Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> dropped 0.42 percent to 6,348.12.

Just four of the 11 major S&P sectors rose, with the financial index's <.SPSY> 0.62 percent rise leading the gainers.

July 31 (Reuters) - The S&P and the Nasdaq were trading lower on Monday morning as tech stocks weighed on the indexes, while the Dow touched a record high, boosted by Boeing Co . Facebook , Google parent Alphabet and Netflix , and Amazon , part of the high-flying "FANG" stocks, were all lower.

"We've been in a little bit of pull-back on some of the tech stocks for the last few days. I think it's just a matter of the fact that they have had a very strong run," said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives for Charles Schwab in Austin, Texas.

"The bull market is sort of broadening out and people are taking a few profits off the table on some these stocks that have done exceedingly well."

Shares of Boeing were up 2 percent, making it the top boost to the Dow, after J.P. Morgan analysts raised price target. [L4N1KM52Q]

Of the 289 S&P 500 companies that reported results until Friday, 73 percent of them beat analyst expectations. This is above the 71 percent average over the past four quarters, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Apple Inc , a part of the Dow, is expected to report quarterly results after market close on Tuesday and its performance may hold the sway over tech stocks this week.

At 10:49 a.m. ET (1449 GMT) the Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was up 63.54 points, or 0.29 percent, at 21,893.85, the S&P 500 <.SPX> was down 1.38 points, or 0.055823 percent, at 2,470.72 and the Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> was down 21.78 points, or 0.34 percent, at 6,352.90.

6 of the 11 major S&P sectors were lower, with the information technology's <.SPLRCT> 2.3 percent decline, making it the biggest drag.

On data front, contracts to buy previously owned homes rebounded in June after three straight monthly declines.

July 31 (Reuters) - U.S. stock indexes opened higher on Monday, with the Dow hitting a record high, as investors remained optimistic on corporate earnings in the second quarter.

Investors have been counting on earnings to support the relatively high valuations for equities, with the S&P 500 trading at about 18 times earnings estimates for the next 12 months, above its long-term average of 15 times. [nL1N1KJ1RJ]

Of the 289 S&P 500 companies that reported results until Friday, 73 percent of them beat analyst expectations. This is above the 71 percent average over the past four quarters, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

The S&P 500 slipped on Friday on negative reactions to earnings reports from high-profile names such as Amazon , Exxon and Starbucks and a drop in shares of tobacco companies.

"We had a choppy week last week, we had a very erratic week, so coming off a erratic week, we're getting some early morning premarket bargain hunting," said Andre Bakhos, managing director at Janlyn Capital LLC.

"We're not having anything coming that the markets can sink their teeth into."

Apple Inc , a part of the Dow, is expected to report quarterly results after market close on Tuesday and its performance may hold the sway over tech stocks this week.

At 9:37 a.m. ET (1337 GMT) the Dow Jones Industrial Average <.DJI> was up 61.07 points, or 0.28 percent, at 21,891.38, the S&P 500 <.SPX> was up 4.68 points, or 0.19 percent, at 2,476.78 and the Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> was up 18.28 points, or 0.29 percent, at 6,392.96.
