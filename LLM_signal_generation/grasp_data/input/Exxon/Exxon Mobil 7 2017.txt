By Sweta Singh and Ankur Banerjee

July 31 (Reuters) - U.S. stock indexes looked set to open higher on Monday as investors remained optimistic about corporate earnings in the second quarter and ahead of a clutch of economic data.

Investors have been counting on earnings to support the relatively high valuations for equities, with the S&P 500 trading at about 18 times earnings estimates for the next 12 months, above its long-term average of 15 times. [nL1N1KJ1RJ]

Of the 289 S&P 500 companies that reported results until Friday, 73 percent of them beat analyst expectations. This is above the 71 percent average over the past four quarters, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

The S&P 500 slipped on Friday on negative reactions to earnings reports from high-profile names such as Amazon , Exxon and Starbucks and a drop in shares of tobacco companies.

"We had a choppy week last week, we had a very erratic week, so coming off a erratic week, we're getting some early morning premarket bargain hunting," said Andre Bakhos, managing director at Janlyn Capital LLC.

Apple Inc , a part of the Dow, is expected to report quarterly results after market close on Tuesday and its performance may hold the sway over tech stocks this week.

Data vying for attention includes ISM Chicago Purchasing Managers' Index data that is expected at 9:45 a.m. ET. The reading, which is an indicator of the strength of U.S. manufacturing sector, is likely to show a slight dip in July.

The Federal Reserve of Dallas will release its monthly manufacturing index for July at around 10:30 a.m. ET.

Oil prices rose on Monday, putting July was on track to become the strongest month for the commodity this year. [O/R]

"What is causing the erratic behavior is a lack of the healthcare bill, any legislation coming from the Congress," Bakhos said.

"So right now, we're going to get some hesitation, hopefully until signs come out of Washington that things will be on the move."

The seven-year Republican quest to scrap Obamacare, a major campaign vow by President Donald Trump, lay in ruins last week after the Senate failed to dismantle the healthcare law.

Dow e-minis <1YMc1> were up 58 points, or 0.27 percent, with 19,868 contracts changing hands at 8:20 a.m. ET (1220 GMT). S&P 500 e-minis were up 3.25 points, or 0.13 percent, with 132,207 contracts traded. Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 13.5 points, or 0.23 percent, on volume of 26,173 contracts.

Scripps Network was up 1.23 percent at $87.98 premarket after Discovery Communications said it would buy the media company for $14.6 billion. [nASB0BBQK]

Charter Communications Inc up 8 percent after the U.S. cable operator said on Sunday it was not interested in buying wireless carrier Sprint Corp . [nL4N1KM1T1]

Shares of Snap Inc fell 3 percent in premarket trading as a share lockup ended, allowing for sales by early investors and pushing it further below its March initial public offering price.

UPDATE 1-Saudi's SABIC reports 25 pct fall in Q2 net profit - Reuters News

{{20170730T103427.867+0000}}UPDATE 1-Saudi's SABIC reports 25 pct fall in Q2 net profit(Adds CEO comments on Aramco project, earnings)

July 30 (Reuters) - Saudi Basic Industries Corp <2010.SE> (SABIC) missed estimates with a 25 percent fall in second-quarter net profit on Sunday as the world's fourth-largest petrochemicals maker reported higher selling costs and lower sales.

Net profit fell to 3.71 billion riyals ($989.3 million) in the three months to June 30 from a revised 4.96 billion a year earlier, the company said in a bourse statement.

That fell well short of the 4.6 billion riyals expected by analysts.

SABIC shares fell 1.2 percent in opening trade on the kingdom's stock exchange.

Chief Executive Yousef al-Benyan said profit fall stemmed from weaker performance at its Hadeed iron and steel unit.

"The impact of our Q2 comes from Hadeed, related to inventory and slow sales," Benyan told a news conference in Riyadh.

The drop in demand for steel was seasonal, driven by the Muslim holidays of Ramadan and Eid, he said, adding the company would try to reduce expenses and increase production.

"Hopefully in the third and fourth quarters the demand will pick up, because normally these (expenses and production) are impacted by these important occasions in the second quarter," Benyan said.

SABIC, which aims to be the world's third-biggest petrochemicals producer, said prior period figures had been restated.

Like most Saudi publicly listed firms, SABIC adopted IFRS accounting standards in January.

Its plastics, fertilisers and metals are used in construction, agriculture and manufacturing.

SABIC had expected this year to be positive in terms of economic growth in key markets. The firm's earnings shot up 80 percent in the first quarter buoyed by higher prices.

Benyan told Reuters in May the firm was evaluating acquisition opportunities in the range of $3 billion to $6 billion in petrochemicals, speciality chemicals and fertilisers and aims to do the first such deal in the fourth quarter of this year. [nL8N1I442]

SABIC's expansion is driven by the need to be closer to key markets and feedstock. Constraints in new gas supplies in Saudi Arabia are forcing petrochemical producers to look abroad for expansion.

The company is making progress towards a major investment in the United States with an affiliate of Exxon Mobil .

It is also pursuing its first project with oil giant Saudi Aramco, development of an oil-to-chemicals project in Saudi Arabia which analysts see as a breakthrough in the industry.

Benyan said he expected to announce more detail on the project by the end of the third quarter. ($1 = 3.7501 riyals)

Saudi's SABIC Q2 net profit declines 25 pct - Reuters News

{{20170730T060056.188+0000}}Saudi's SABIC Q2 net profit declines 25 pctJuly 30 (Reuters) - Saudi Basic Industries Corp <2010.SE> (SABIC), the world's fourth-biggest petrochemicals company reported a 25 percent decline in second-quarter net profit on Sunday, amid higher selling costs and lower sales.

SABIC made a net profit of 3.71 billion riyals in the three months to June 30, down from a revised 4.96 billion riyals in the year-earlier period, the company said in a bourse statement.

SABIC said prior period figures have been restated.

SABIC, like most Saudi publicly listed firms adopted IFRS accounting standards in January this year

SABIC, which aims to be Number 3 petrochemicals producer globally, attributed the profit fall to higher cost of sales and lower sales quantities.

The company's results are closely tied to oil prices and global economic growth because its products -- plastics, fertilisers and metals -- are used extensively in construction, agriculture, industry and the manufacturing of consumer goods.

SABIC had expected this year to be positive in terms of economic growth in key markets.

WRAPUP 2-Exxon Mobil profit disappoints Wall Street, Chevron shines - Reuters News

{{20170728T184730.213+0000}}WRAPUP 2-Exxon Mobil profit disappoints Wall Street, Chevron shinesBy Ernest Scheyder

HOUSTON, July 28 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp posted a rare earnings miss on Friday, the only international oil producer to do so last quarter, as production slipped in its African and Canadian operations.

Exxon's results were overshadowed by rival Chevron Corp , which easily exceeded Wall Street's expectations with a double-digit percentage increase in production.

Royal Dutch Shell Plc , Total SA and Statoil ASA this week delivered profits that topped expectations also.[nL5N1KI7KW][nL5N1KI0YM]

Chevron for years has downplayed profits to spend heavily on megaprojects in Australia, the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and elsewhere.

That spending now is boosting Chevron's profit, whereas Exxon has fewer projects about to come online and many of its older assets require more capital to maintain.

While profit rose sharply from a year earlier, the Irving, Texas-based company's production slipped about 1.0 percent.[nL1N1KJ0EC]

"Exxon continues to really struggle on getting its output up," said Edward Jones analyst Brian Youngberg.

"Chevron is going from a cash spender to a cash generator, even without commodity prices improving," he said.

Shares of Exxon fell about 2.0 percent to $79.17 in Friday afternoon trading while shares of Chevron gained more than 2.0 percent to $108.53 per share. Oil prices rose on Friday to a two-month high.[nL3N1KJ1EA]

Exxon's stock was the worst drag on the Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI>, while shares of Chevron led the index higher.

Both companies said they would continue to deploy drilling rigs and other equipment to the Permian Basin, the largest U.S. oilfield.

That expansion, along with similar plans by other U.S. shale peers, is likely to further irritate the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, which have tried with mixed success this year to tame an oversupply of crude oil.[nL5N1KF1S6][nL1N1IA0M4]

Exxon posted second-quarter net income of $3.35 billion, or 78 cents per share, compared to $1.7 billion, or 41 cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts expected earnings of 84 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

In Africa, where Exxon produces in Nigeria, Angola and elsewhere, production slipped 16 percent due to declining fields rates and project delays.

Imperial Oil Ltd , which is majority controlled by Exxon and operates in Canada's oil sands region, posted a net loss, denting Exxon's results from that country.[nL3N1KJ45W]

Exxon's Kearl oil sands operations in Alberta were partly offline, hurting Canadian production.

Still, Exxon sought to highlight the positive, stressing its growth opportunities in liquefied natural gas (LNG), especially in Qatar, where it has invested billions.

Despite a recent diplomatic row with its Gulf Arab neighbors, Qatar "is a very important partnership for us" and Exxon is "very interested" in expanding operations there, company executive Jeff Woodbury told investors on a Friday conference call.

Any expansion would be years away from boosting Exxon's results. Reuters reported earlier this month that Exxon Chief Executive Darren Woods has been lobbying Qatar to take part in LNG expansions.[nL8N1JW5NC]

CHEVRON SHINES

San Ramon, Calif.-based Chevron boosted output by 10 percent and cut its costs, part of what executives called a pivot to earnings growth.[nL1N1KJ0JB]

The company reported second-quarter net income of $1.45 billion, or 77 cents per share, compared to a net loss of $1.47 billion, or 78 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter.

Excluding one-time items, the company earned 91 cents per share. By that measure, analysts expected earnings of 87 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Chevron's cash flow dropped more than Exxon's, when compared to the same quarter last year, but with a steady stream of projects coming online, nearly all Wall Street analysts have said they prefer Chevron more than its Texas-based rival.

Chevron's Gorgon LNG project in Australia had suffered setbacks since coming online, including several temporary shutdowns earlier this year.[nL8N1IX43X][nL8N1IH3JO][nL3N1H43V8]

But those appear to be behind the company, and Chevron said its second LNG project in Australia, at Wheatstone, should be operational later this year, further boosting profit.

But those appear to be behind the company, and Chevron said its second LNG project in Australia, at Wheatstone, should be operational later this year, further boosting profit.

BREAKINGVIEWS-Exxon looks longingly at Chevron's primed pump - Reuters Breakingviews

{{20170728T171915.290+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-Exxon looks longingly at Chevron's primed pump(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are her own.)

By Lauren Silva Laughlin

NEW YORK, July 28 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Exxon Mobil is stuck playing catch-up. The $336 billion oil and gas company on Friday reported vastly improved second-quarter results compared to the same period last year. But fellow integrated major Chevron outpaced it as investments it made in the Permian Basin in West Texas earlier in the cycle are starting to pay off.

These helped Chevron turn a $1.5 billion loss in the three months to June in 2016 into a $1.5 billion profit this year. Its overall production rose by 250,000 barrels a day, equivalent to a 10 percent increase over the quarter, thanks in large part to a one-third jump in Permian output.

Moreover, it has reduced operating costs in the area by 37 percent since 2015. Chief Executive John Watson has also been investing more in the region, having closed seven deals so far this year which he reckons should yield a 30 percent internal rate of return. He is also eyeing as much as 200,000 acres for purchase before the end of 2018.

Darren Woods, who took over as Exxon chief executive at the start of the year, is not in as good a position; predecessor Rex Tillerson had not committed as many resources to the Permian before he left to become U.S. secretary of state. As a consequence, Exxon's U.S. E&P division fell well short of Goldman Sachs' expectations and the company is only just breaking ground on West Texas wells on land it bought earlier this year. Production at the company fell by 1 percent to 3.9 million barrels a day.

That's part of Woods' broader plan to boost capital expenditure and put its cash pile to work that should bring relatively quick results, assuming commodity prices allow. And Exxon does, at least, have a decent investment track record: the 6.7 percent return on capital employed, according to Thomson Reuters data, that analysts expect this year is best in class.

Trouble is, rivals including Chevron are starting to cut back spending as prices fall, just as oil floods the market. Exxon may end up being a smart contrarian. If not, it'll only be able to look longingly at its competitor's primed pumps.

UPDATE 2-Italy's Eni confident of dividend even with lower oil prices - Reuters News

{{20170728T160312.848+0000}}UPDATE 2-Italy's Eni confident of dividend even with lower oil prices* Adjusted net profit 463 mln euros vs 317 mln loss year ago

* Cash flow up 56 pct to 2.7 billion euros

* First half oil and gas output up 6.1 pct

* 2017 interim dividend of 0.4 euros

(Recasts lead, adds CEO comments, analyst)

By Stephen Jewkes

MILAN, July 28 (Reuters) - Italian oil major Eni said on Friday its dividend was safe even at lower oil prices thanks to a string of major discoveries underpinning output growth and cash generation for the years to come.

Eni , the most active of the foreign oil majors in Africa, has one of the best discovery records in the industry, with large gas fields in Mozambique and Egypt. More recently it also made an oil find in Mexico.

Under its so-called "dual exploration" strategy, the company aims to sell down stakes in fields it operates to raise cash to fund future development and support dividends.

"We have all the tools to cope with oil at $45 a barrel," CEO Claudio Descalzi told analysts on a second-quarter results call when asked about dividend sustainability.

"We are able to tackle this situation, and we won't be using scrip dividends," he said, referring to a practice where investors are offered shares in place of cash.

Eni, whose cash flow jumped 56 pct to 2.7 billion euros in the second quarter, has committed to paying a dividend in 2017 of 0.80 euros per share.

Investors in oil firms have been unnerved by weak oil prices, which have struggled to hold gains that followed a deal between the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and some other producers to cut crude production from January.

Prices climbed above $58 a barrel in January, recovering from the 2016 lows of just $27. But Brent has since slipped back and is now hovering around $52, leading banks to downgrade price forecasts and investor concerns about shareholder returns.

Eni, which has pledged to cut spending this year by about 18 percent, earmarked about 32 billion euros of investments in its four-year business plan in March.

Descalzi said there was room to reduce those investments if needed. "In the second half of the plan 50 percent of the capex is not yet committed ... we have flexibility," he said.

OUTPUT AHEAD

Eni, which will benefit from a ramp-up at Kazakhstan's giant Kashagan field, said it expected output this year to jump 5 percent to 1.84 million barrels per day as projects in Angola, Ghana, Indonesia and Egypt come on stream ahead of schedule.

Longer term, it expects output to rise 3 percent a year.

Eni said its discovery in the Gulf of Mexico could contain more than the 1.3 billion barrels of oil equivalent in place estimated so far. It said it would decide early next year whether to proceed with investment there.

"We own 100 percent of Mexico and it's clearly one of our future targets (for selling down)," Descalzi said.

Eni, which has agreed to sell stakes in its Mozambique and Egyptian fields to ExxonMobil and Rosneft , expects to raise 4 billion euros this year from disposals.

Santander oil analyst Jason Kenney, who was upbeat about Eni on a three- to five-year outlook, said the market had underestimated the value of Eni's dual exploration strategy.

"Investors have proved unwilling to support Eni for its valuable discovered resource potential," he said.

Shares in Eni closed up 0.3 percent, broadly in line with the European oil and gas sector <.SXEP>. Milan's blue-chip index <.FTMIB> closed down 0.9 percent.

** Chevron up ~2 pct after co beat the adj EPS estimate by nearly 5 pct, while Exxon down ~2 pct after it came in shy of adj EPS estimate by about 7 pct [nL1N1KJ0JB] [nL1N1KJ0EC]

** With Chevron, "compared to our estimate, half of the upstream earnings beat is driven by the lower than expected exploration expenses and the rest is due to better production volumes," analysts at Barclays wrote

** Additionally, in terms of upside vs median PTs, CVX currently offers gain potential of 10.5 pct vs just 4.6 pct for XOM

** While U.S. oil prices are down in 2017, they have rallied sharply in recent sessions, largely in the wake of a decline in U.S. inventories and OPEC's efforts to curb production

Lucro da petroleira Exxon quase dobra, mas fica abaixo de expectativas - Reuters (Portuguese, Brazil)

{{20170728T143654.135+0000}}Lucro da petroleira Exxon quase dobra, mas fica abaixo de expectativas28 Jul (Reuters) - A Exxon Mobil , maior petroleira com ações negociadas em bolsa do mundo, disse nesta sexta-feira que seu lucro trimestral quase dobrou devido a maiores margens em suas operações fora dos Estados Unidos, mas ainda assim os resultados ficaram abaixo das expectativas do mercado.

As ações da companhia, com sede em Irving, no Texas, caíram cerca de 1,9 por cento após a divulgação do resultado, em negociações antes da abertura do mercado.

Enquanto o portfólio da Exxon nos EUA, incluindo seus projetos de xisto, registrou perdas, as operações de gás e petróleo ao redor do mundo tiveram uma alta de 89 por cento na lucratividade.

A companhia vendeu mais gasolina e querosene no trimestre, impulsionando os ganhos, mas as vendas de químicos caíram em parte devido a custos com manutenção de unidades e margens fracas.

"Nosso trabalho é aumentar o valor no longo-prazo investindo em nosso portfólio integrado de oportunidades que podem ter sucesso independente das condições de mercado", disse o presidente da companhia, Darren Woods, em nota.

A companhia teve lucro líquido de 3,35 bilhões de dólares no segundo trimestre, ou 78 centavos de dólar por ação, ante 1,7 bilhão, ou 41 centavos por ação no mesmo período do ano passado. Analistas esperavam lucros de 84 centavos por ação, segundo pesquisa da Thomson Reuters.

A produção da companhia caiu 1 por cento, para 3,9 milhões de barris de óleo equivalente por dia.

POINT MARCHÉS-Wall Street ouvre en baisse, Amazon pèse - Reuters (French)

{{20170728T140709.533+0000}}POINT MARCHÉS-Wall Street ouvre en baisse, Amazon pèsePARIS, 28 juillet (Reuters) - Les indices de Wall Street ouvrent en recul vendredi pour une nouvelle séance dominée par les résultats, en particulier ceux d'Amazon dont la forte baisse du bénéfice impacte la tendance.

Vers 14h05 GMT, l'indice Dow Jones <.DJI> cède 26,43 points, soit 0,12%, à 21.770,12. Le Standard & Poor's 500 <.SPX>, plus large, perd 0,28% à 2.468,37 et le Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> recule de 0,39% à 6.357,53.

Les résultats trimestriels sont surveillés de près par les investisseurs pour savoir si la forte valorisation actuelle du marché est justifiée dans un contexte de faible inflation.

D'après Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, les bénéfices sont attendus en hausse de 10,7% au deuxième trimestre contre 8% prévus au début du mois.

Les craintes sur les capacités de Donald Trump à légiférer pour relancer la croissance reviennent sur le devant de la scène après le rejet par le Sénat américain d'un texte prévoyant une abrogation partielle de la loi sur l'assurance-maladie dite "Obamacare".

Une décision qui pourrait mettre fin aux efforts déployés depuis sept ans par le Parti républicain pour supprimer cette réforme emblématique de la présidence de Barack Obama, l'une des principales promesses de campagne de Donald Trump. [nL5N1KJ1HY]

"Il semble que l'Obamacare soit devenu un cauchemar pour Trump et pas une bonne nouvelle pour les marchés non plus", estime Naeem Aslam, analyste marchés chez ThinkMarkets.

Sur le plan des statistiques, la croissance de l'économie américaine a accéléré au deuxième trimestre avec la hausse de la consommation des ménages et de l'investissement des entreprises, ce qui confirme que le trou d'air des trois premiers mois de l'année était bien passager. [nL5N1KJ550]

ACTUALIZA 1-Exxon Mobil casi duplica su ganancia trimestral, pero incumple expectativas de Wall Street  - Reuters (Spanish)

{{20170728T140707.796+0000}}ACTUALIZA 1-Exxon Mobil casi duplica su ganancia trimestral, pero incumple expectativas de Wall Street (Amplía información)

28 jul (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp, el mayor productor de petróleo del mundo que cotiza en bolsa, dijo el viernes que sus ganancias trimestrales casi se duplicaron por los crecientes márgenes de sus operaciones fuera de Estados Unidos, pero los resultados incumplieron las expectativas de Wall Street.

Las acciones de la empresa con sede Irving, Texas, caían cerca de 2,8 por ciento en las primeras operaciones de Wall Street.

Si bien la cartera de Exxon en Estados Unidos, que incluye sus proyectos de esquisto, perdió dinero, las operaciones globales de gas y petróleo de la empresa registraron un aumento del 69 por ciento en sus ganancias.

La compañía vendió más gasolina y queroseno en el trimestre, pero las ventas de productos químicos cayeron debido en parte a costos de mantenimiento y unos márgenes débiles.

"Nuestro trabajo es aumentar valor a largo plazo con la inversión en nuestra cartera integral de oportunidades, que prospera independiente de las condiciones del mercado", dijo el presidente ejecutivo de la petrolera, Darren Woods, en un comunicado.

La compañía registró una utilidad neta de 3.350 millones de dólares, o 78 centavos por acción, en comparación con los 1.700 millones de dólares, o 41 centavos por acción, del mismo periodo de un año antes. Los analistas esperaban ganancias de 84 centavos por acción, según Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

La producción cayó un 1 por ciento a 3,9 millones de barriles de petróleo equivalente por día.

Los resultados se conocen en momentos en que Exxon lucha con sus accionistas y otros sectores por los problemas vinculados al cambio climático.

Exxon se ha visto envuelto en una fuerte disputa a raíz de unos documentos relacionados al cambio climático con el fiscal general del estado de Nueva York, Eric Schneiderman, quien busca sancionar al productor de petróleo por lo que asegura son revelaciones públicas engañosas.

Los accionistas de Exxon aprobaron en mayo una resolución en que piden a la compañía emitir un informe sobre cómo el cambio climático afecta las operaciones. La votación, que no era vinculante, se aprobó con el 62 por ciento de los votos emitidos y fue una inusual derrota para la gerencia de Exxon.

Exxon und Chevron machen dank Ölpreisanstieg Milliarden - Reuters (German)

{{20170728T132850.792+0000}}Exxon und Chevron machen dank Ölpreisanstieg MilliardenHouston, 28. Jul (Reuters) - Der deutlich erholte Ölpreis spült den großen US-Energiekonzernen wieder Milliarden in die Kassen. Der größte börsennotierte Multi Exxon verdoppelte im abgelaufenen Quartal seinen Gewinn nahezu, der Rivale Chevron schrieb nach einem Verlust im vergangenen Jahr wieder schwarze Zahlen. Auch die europäischen Konkurrenten fuhren wieder satte Gewinne ein.[nL5N1KI24Z] Derzeit liegt der Ölpreis bei rund 50 Dollar und damit um einiges höher als noch im Frühjahr 2016, als ein Barrel (159 Liter) lediglich 37 Dollar kostete. Hintergrund ist die vereinbarte Förderbremse der Organisation Erdöl exportierender Länder (Opec), die erst kürzlich bis März 2018 verlängert wurde.

Während des Ölpreisverfalls hatten die Ölmultis teils drastische Sparprogramme aufgelegt. Davon profitiert Chevron. Der Gewinn betrug 1,45 Milliarden Dollar nach einen Verlust von 1,47 Milliarden Dollar im Vorjahr. Konkurrent Exxon machte einen Gewinn von 3,35 Milliarden Dollar nach 1,7 Milliarden Dollar. Vor allem der Gewinn der weltweiten Öl- und Gasproduktion schoss in die Höhe. In den USA, wo auch aus Schiefer Öl und Gas gewonnen wird, schrieb Exxon jedoch rote Zahlen. Exxon-Aktien gaben im vorbörslichen Handel nach, Analysten hatten dem Konzern mehr zugetraut.

LEAD 1-Exxon Mobil-Bénéfice doublé mais inférieur au consensus - Reuters (French)

{{20170728T131204.595+0000}}LEAD 1-Exxon Mobil-Bénéfice doublé mais inférieur au consensus(Actualisé avec des précisions, cours de Bourse)

28 juillet (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil , première capitalisation pétrolière mondiale, a fait état vendredi d'un quasi-doublement de son bénéfice trimestriel grâce à la nette amélioration des marges de ses activités en dehors des Etats-Unis.

Pourtant, le bénéfice est inférieur au consensus, ce qui explique que l'action du groupe d'Irving (Texas) perdait 1,9% en avant-Bourse.

Si l'activité d'Exxon aux Etats-Unis, schistes compris, a perdu de l'argent, les opérations gazières et pétrolières internationales ont vu leur bénéfice bondir de 69%.

Le pétrolier a vendu plus d'essence et de kérosène durant le trimestre mais les ventes du segment chimie ont fléchi, en raison notamment de coûts de maintenance.

Le bénéfice est ressorti à 3,35 milliards de dollars (2,86 milliards d'euros) au deuxième trimestre, soit 78 cents par action, contre 1,7 milliard de dollars (41 cents) un an auparavant. Le consensus Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S donnait un bénéfice par action de 84 cents.

La production a baissé de 1% à 3,9 millions de barils équivalent pétrole par jour.

Exxon doit faire face à une offensive du procureur général de New York Eric Schneidermann qui estime que le pétrolier a trompé le public concernant la question des changements climatiques.

Les actionnaires d'Exxon ont adopté en mai une résolution qui impose à Exxon de soumettre un rapport sur les conséquences pour ses opérations des changements climatiques. Le vote, non contraignant, a constitué l'un des rares reverse qu'ait subi la direction.

EARNINGS-TICKER-Chevron macht wieder Gewinn - Reuters (German)

{{20170728T124053.734+0000}}EARNINGS-TICKER-Chevron macht wieder Gewinn28. Jul (Reuters) - Zahlreiche Firmen veröffentlichen dieser Tage ihre aktuelle Quartalsbilanz. Es folgt in Kurzform ein Überblick über einige Ergebnisse vom Freitag:

14.32 Uhr - Chevron hat im abgelaufenen Quartal wieder Gewinn gemacht. Hintergrund waren gesunkene Kosten und eine gestiegene Produktion. Der Nettogewinn des Ölkonzerns belief sich auf 1,45 Milliarden Dollar. Ein Jahr zuvor stand noch ein Verlust von 1,47 Milliarden Dollar in der Bilanz.

14.05 Uhr - Der Ölkonzern Exxon Mobil hat seinen Gewinn im abgelaufenen Quartal fast verdoppelt. Der Überschuss legte auf 3,35 Milliarden Dollar zu nach 1,7 Milliarden ein Jahr zuvor. Exxon förderte allerdings weniger Öl, die Produktion fiel ein Prozent.

13.38 Uhr - Steigende Ticketpreise und ein höheres Passagieraufkommen verhelfen American Airlines zu mehr Umsatz. Die Erlöse legten im abgelaufenen Quartal um 7,2 Prozent auf 11,11 Milliarden Dollar zu. Dennoch fiel der Nettogewinn auf 803 Millionen Dollar von zuvor 950 Millionen Dollar.

13.32 Uhr - Goodyear hat Mühe beim Verkauf seiner Reifen. Der Überschuss fiel im abgelaufenen Quartal um 27,2 Prozent auf 147 Millionen Dollar. Mit 3,69 Milliarden Dollar setzte der Konzern knapp fünf Prozent weniger um als vor einem Jahr.

12.51 Uhr - Der US-Pharmakonzern Merck & Co punktet mit seinem neuartigen Krebsmittel Keytruda. Dank der guten Verkäufe des Medikaments schoss der Nettogewinn im abgelaufenen Quartal um 61,5 Prozent auf 1,95 Milliarden Dollar nach oben. Der Umsatz stieg binnen Jahresfrist auf 9,93 von 9,84 Milliarden Dollar.

12.07 Uhr - Der Flugzeug- und Zugbauer Bombardier hat im abgelaufenen Quartal mit 4,1 Milliarden Dollar fünf Prozent weniger eingenommen als ein Jahr zuvor. Dennoch erzielte der kanadische Konzern einen bereinigten Nettogewinn von 39 Millionen Dollar. Im Vorjahreszeitraum war noch ein Verlust von 83 Millionen Dollar angefallen.

09.25 Uhr - Der Waschanlagenbauer Washtec hat im ersten Halbjahr den Umsatz um fast ein Viertel auf knapp 210 Millionen Euro gesteigert, während der Gewinn vor Steuern um mehr als 60 Prozent auf 25 Millionen Euro sprang. Im Gesamtjahr will das Unternehmen nun mindestens einen Umsatz von 420 Millionen Euro und eine Gewinnmarge von zwölf Prozent schaffen.

09.10 Uhr - Der Triebwerksbauer MTU Aero hat im zweiten Quartal bei Umsatz und Ergebnis die Erwartungen des Finanzmarktes übertroffen. Das Unternehmen erwirtschaftete einen operativen Gewinn von 164 (Prognose: 148) Millionen Euro und einen Umsatz von 1,286 (1,27) Milliarden Euro. Für das Gesamtjahr peilt es nun Erlöse von 5,3 statt 5,1 bis 5,2 Milliarden Euro an.

09.00 Uhr - Der französische Autokonzern Renault hat im ersten Halbjahr bei Absatz und Gewinn neue Rekorde eingefahren. Der operative Gewinn stieg um fast ein Fünftel auf 1,82 Milliarden Euro. Netto standen 2,4 Milliarden Euro zu Buche - nicht zuletzt dank eines hohen Gewinnbeitrags der Beteiligung Nissan<7201.T>, deren Ergebnis sich um mehr als 70 Prozent verbesserte.

08.27 Uhr - Der britische Telekomkonzern BT hat im abgelaufenen Quartal einen 42-prozentigen Einbruch des Vorsteuergewinns auf 418 Millionen Pfund (rund 468 Millionen Euro) hinnehmen müssen. Sonderlasten nach einem Bilanzskandal in Italien und einer Einigung mit der Deutschen Telekom und der französischen Orange waren dafür verantwortlich.

08.20 Uhr - Der Verkauf von Geschäftsteilen in Afrika kommt die britische Großbank Barclays teuer zu stehen. Durch die Trennung entstand in der Bilanz des ersten Halbjahres ein Verlust von 1,2 Milliarden Pfund, wie das Institut am Freitag mitteilte. Ohne diesen Sondereffekt lag der Halbjahresgewinn vor Steuern bei 2,3 Milliarden Pfund und damit 300 Millionen Pfund höher als im ersten Halbjahr 2016. Analysten hatten von den Briten allerdings einen Vorsteuergewinn von 2,7 Milliarden Pfund erwartet.

08.10 Uhr - Der französische Versorger Engie hat seinen Umsatz in der ersten Jahreshälfte leicht auf 33,1 Milliarden Euro gesteigert. Der Gewinn stagnierte bei fünf Milliarden Euro. Der Konzern bestätigte seine Jahresziele und sieht sich beim Umbau, der im kommenden Jahr abgeschlossen werden soll, über Plan.

08.00 Uhr - Die in Paris ansässige Mehrländer-Börse Euronext hat trotz der mauen Aktivität vieler Anleger im zweiten Quartal ihren Gewinn gesteigert. Das operative Ergebnis sei auf 79,2 (206: 77,7) Millionen Euro gestiegen, teilte der Betreiber von Kassa- und Derivate-Börsen in Paris, Amsterdam, Brüssel, London und Lissabon mit. Während andere Börsenbetreiber wie die Deutsche Börse teilweise von schwächeren Umsätzen berichtet hatten, stieg der tägliche Derivatehandel auf Euronext-Plattformen im zweiten Quartal um 27,3 Prozent.

07.50 Uhr - Die Fluggesellschaft Air France-KLM hat im zweiten Quartal von einem anziehenden Reisegeschäft profitiert und ihren Umsatz um 1,5 Prozent steigern können. Der operative Gewinn lag mit 496 Millionen Euro leicht über den Erwartungen von Branchenanalysten. Der französisch-niederländische Konzern veröffentlichte keine Jahresprognose, Analysten erwarten jedoch einen Jahresgewinn von rund 1,3 Milliarden Euro.

07.45 Uhr - Der französische Energieriese Electricite de France hat im ersten Halbjahr einen deutlichen Gewinnrückgang verkraften müssen. Das operative Ergebnis sei um ein Fünftel auf sieben Milliarden Euro abgerutscht, teilte das Unternehmen mit und machte dafür "unvorteilhafte Marktbedingungen" verantwortlich. Unter dem Strich blieb ein Gewinn von zwei Milliarden Euro - ein Minus von 3,7 Prozent. Seine Jahresziele bestätigte der Konzern.

07.40 Uhr - Der IT-Vermieter Grenke hat seinen Gewinn im ersten Halbjahr um fast 20 Prozent auf 78,8 Millionen Euro gesteigert und erhöht deshalb seine Prognose für das Gesamtjahr leicht. Es werde nun ein Jahresgewinn zwischen 118 und 124 Millionen Euro erwartet. Bislang war das Unternehmen von 113 bis 123 Millionen Euro ausgegangen.

07.32 Uhr - Der französische Gasekonzern Air Liquide hat im ersten Halbjahr Umsatz und Gewinn kräftig gesteigert. Unter dem Strich erwirtschaftete der Konkurrent des deutschen Linde-Konzerns in den ersten sechs Monaten 928 Millionen Euro, ein Plus von 14,5 Prozent. Der operstive Gewinn sprang sogar um mehr als 20 Prozent nach oben.

07.25 Uhr - Die spanische Großbank Santander hat dank eines brummenden Geschäfts in ihrem größten Markt Brasilien den Gewinn im zweiten Quartal um fast 40 Prozent auf 1,75 Milliarden Euro gesteigert. Das Institut hatte Anfang Juni den angeschlagenen heimischen Konkurrenten Banco Popular übernommen.

07.20 Uhr - Der erwartete Gewinnrückgang bei der französischen Großbank BNP Paribas fiel im zweiten Quartal dank Kostensenkungen und eines überraschend guten Geschäfts im Investmentbanking niedriger aus als erwartet. Der Nettogewinn von Frankreichs größtem börsennotierten Kreditinstitut sank zwischen April und Ende Juni um 6,4 Prozent auf knapp 2,4 Milliarden Euro. Von Reuters befragte Analysten hatten mit einem Gewinnrückgang auf 1,9 Milliarden Euro gerechnet.

07.10 Uhr - Der Spezialsoftwareanbieter Nemetschek hat im ersten Halbjahr seinen Umsatz um ein Fünftel auf 194 Millionen Euro gesteigert. Der operative Gewinn erreichte 51,7 Millionen Euro, was einer Rendite von 26,6 Prozent entspricht. Das Unternehmen beließ seinen Ausblick für das Gesamtjahr 2017 unverändert.

UPDATE 1-Exxon profit nearly doubles, but falls short of expectations - Reuters News

{{20170728T122937.641+0000}}UPDATE 1-Exxon profit nearly doubles, but falls short of expectations(Adds earnings comparison, stock, details)

By Ernest Scheyder

July 28 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp , the world's largest publicly traded oil producer, said on Friday its quarterly profit nearly doubled on surging margins at its operations outside the United States, but results fell shy of Wall Street's expectations.

Shares of Irving, Texas-based Exxon fell about 1.9 percent in premarket trading to $79.30.

While Exxon's U.S. portfolio, including its shale projects, lost money, Exxon's gas and oil operations across the world posted a 69 percent jump in profit.

The company sold more gasoline and kerosene in the quarter, boosting the bottom line as well, but sales of chemicals slipped due in part to plant maintenance costs and weak margins.

"Our job is to grow long-term value by investing in our integrated portfolio of opportunities that succeed regardless of market conditions," Chief Executive Darren Woods said in a statement.

The company posted second-quarter net income of $3.35 billion, or 78 cents per share, compared to $1.7 billion, or 41 cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts expected earnings of 84 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Production fell about 1.0 percent to 3.9 million barrels of oil equivalent per day.

The results come as Exxon battles its shareholders and others over climate change issues.

Exxon has been locked in an aggressive back-and-forth skirmish over climate change documents with New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who has sought to punish the oil producer for what he says are misleading public disclosures.[nL1N1IZ0N6]

Exxon's shareholders in May approved a resolution in May that called for the company to issue a report on how climate change affects operations. The vote, which was non-binding, passed with 62 percent of ballots cast and was a rare defeat for Exxon's management.[nL1N1IX15V]

What to Watch in the Day Ahead - Friday, July 28 - 路透新闻

To receive The Day Ahead, Eikon users can register at [DAY/US]. Thomson One users can register at RT/DAY/US. All times in ET/GMT)

The U.S Commerce Department issues its advanced second-quarter gross domestic product estimate, which is likely to have increased 2.6 percent compared with a 1.4 percent rise in the previous quarter. The Commerce Department will also report that advanced core PCE prices for the second quarter are forecast to rise 0.8 percent, but lower than a 2.0 percent rise in the first quarter. (0830/1230) The final reading of University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers Sentiment Index for July is expected to remain unchanged at 93.1 from the previous month. (1000/1400) The Labor Department issues the second quarter Employment Cost Index, which is likely to have gained 0.6 percent. (0830/1230)

Investor focus will be on the performance of Merck & Co Inc's high-profile cancer drug Keytruda as the drugmaker reports second-quarter results amid rising competition in the lung cancer market. Investors will also be looking for comments on the multiple myeloma trials, which were testing Keytruda in combination with Celgene's standard of care treatments, and were placed on clinical hold by the U.S regulator earlier this month. Meanwhile, AbbVie Inc also reports second quarter results that are likely to be helped by increased sales of its flagship drug, Humira. Investors will also look for comment on its cancer drug Imbruvica, which analysts expect to become an important revenue driver for the drugmaker.

Exxon Mobil Corp, the world's largest publicly traded oil producer, is expected to post a second quarter profit. Separately, U.S. oil producer Chevron Corp is also expected to post a second quarter profit.

Baker Hughes reports second quarter results. The world's second-largest oilfield services provider, created by Baker Hughes' merger with GE's oil and gas equipment operations, is expected to report quarterly revenue of $2.34 billion and a loss of 15 cents per share in its maiden quarterly release. Investors will be keen on knowing how the company plans to run its business in an uncertain oil market.

Barclays Plc reports first half earnings, with alleged misdeeds by bank executives past and present threatening to overshadow the lender's financial performance. Chief Executive Jes Staley faces a regulatory probe into his attempts to unmask a whistleblower, while the bank has hit headlines in recent months over the trial of its former CEO and others for conduct during its crisis-era Qatar bailout. From a business point of view investors may focus on whether Barclays repeats its dire first quarter bond trading performance, a problem which U.S. rivals saw continue into the period ended June.

Credit Suisse Group AG reports second quarter results. After raising 4 billion Swiss francs earlier this year to plug a hole in its balance sheet, Tidjane Thiam will give an update on his restructure of Switzerland's second-biggest bank two years into his tenure as CEO. Investors and analysts are keen to see healthy inflows at its core wealth management businesses, an improvement at its global markets trading division - the source of billions of dollars in losses last year - and progress in winding down its "bad bank".

Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co reports second quarter results. The U.S. tire maker is expected to report a drop in profit and revenue due to a decrease in its tire shipments. The company has been struggling with a decline in heavy-duty truck production in the United States as a result of oversupply in the market. The company has also been cutting costs and has hiked tire prices to counter higher raw material costs. Investors will look for updates on its long-term forecasts.

American Airlines Group Inc is expected to report strong second quarter financial results. The No. 1 U.S. airline in its June traffic report raised guidance on closely watched metrics including pre-tax margins and total revenue per available seat mile.

The Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis President Neel Kashkari participates in a moderated question-and-answer session before a Woodbury Area/St. Paul Chamber of Commerce event, Oakdale, Minneapolis. (1320/1720)

Canada's Bombardier Inc will report second quarter earnings amid industry speculation that the plane and train maker is poised to form new rail joint ventures with Germany's Siemens AG. Bombardier executives, however, are not expected to discuss recent media reports that the two companies could form separate joint ventures in signaling and rolling stock as early as August. Analysts will be watching for an update on the company's cash flow and whether Bombardier's guidance for 30 to 35 CSeries jet deliveries remains on track for 2017. Statistics Canada may report that the Canadian economy grew by 0.2 percent in May. The report is likely to support analysts' expectations that the economy maintained its momentum in the second quarter after a strong start to the year. (0830/1230)

Brazil's IGP-M price index for July, which includes wholesale and consumer prices, is forecast to fall 0.65 percent. The index had fallen 0.67 percent in June. The country's inflation has plunged as the economy struggles to recover from its worst recession on record. (0700/1100) The unemployment rate is expected to remain unchanged at 13.3 percent in June from the previous month.(0800/1200) Meanwhile, the country is expected to post a budget deficit of 19.25 billion reais in June compared with a deficit of 30.70 billion reais in May.(1000/1400) Chile's manufacturing output is expected to fall 1.1 percent in June from a year earlier.

EARNINGS-TICKER-Chevron macht wieder Gewinn - Reuters (German)

{{20170728T124053.734+0000}}EARNINGS-TICKER-Chevron macht wieder Gewinn28. Jul (Reuters) - Zahlreiche Firmen veröffentlichen dieser Tage ihre aktuelle Quartalsbilanz. Es folgt in Kurzform ein Überblick über einige Ergebnisse vom Freitag:

14.32 Uhr - Chevron hat im abgelaufenen Quartal wieder Gewinn gemacht. Hintergrund waren gesunkene Kosten und eine gestiegene Produktion. Der Nettogewinn des Ölkonzerns belief sich auf 1,45 Milliarden Dollar. Ein Jahr zuvor stand noch ein Verlust von 1,47 Milliarden Dollar in der Bilanz.

14.05 Uhr - Der Ölkonzern Exxon Mobil hat seinen Gewinn im abgelaufenen Quartal fast verdoppelt. Der Überschuss legte auf 3,35 Milliarden Dollar zu nach 1,7 Milliarden ein Jahr zuvor. Exxon förderte allerdings weniger Öl, die Produktion fiel ein Prozent.

13.38 Uhr - Steigende Ticketpreise und ein höheres Passagieraufkommen verhelfen American Airlines zu mehr Umsatz. Die Erlöse legten im abgelaufenen Quartal um 7,2 Prozent auf 11,11 Milliarden Dollar zu. Dennoch fiel der Nettogewinn auf 803 Millionen Dollar von zuvor 950 Millionen Dollar.

13.32 Uhr - Goodyear hat Mühe beim Verkauf seiner Reifen. Der Überschuss fiel im abgelaufenen Quartal um 27,2 Prozent auf 147 Millionen Dollar. Mit 3,69 Milliarden Dollar setzte der Konzern knapp fünf Prozent weniger um als vor einem Jahr.

12.51 Uhr - Der US-Pharmakonzern Merck & Co punktet mit seinem neuartigen Krebsmittel Keytruda. Dank der guten Verkäufe des Medikaments schoss der Nettogewinn im abgelaufenen Quartal um 61,5 Prozent auf 1,95 Milliarden Dollar nach oben. Der Umsatz stieg binnen Jahresfrist auf 9,93 von 9,84 Milliarden Dollar.

12.07 Uhr - Der Flugzeug- und Zugbauer Bombardier hat im abgelaufenen Quartal mit 4,1 Milliarden Dollar fünf Prozent weniger eingenommen als ein Jahr zuvor. Dennoch erzielte der kanadische Konzern einen bereinigten Nettogewinn von 39 Millionen Dollar. Im Vorjahreszeitraum war noch ein Verlust von 83 Millionen Dollar angefallen.

09.25 Uhr - Der Waschanlagenbauer Washtec hat im ersten Halbjahr den Umsatz um fast ein Viertel auf knapp 210 Millionen Euro gesteigert, während der Gewinn vor Steuern um mehr als 60 Prozent auf 25 Millionen Euro sprang. Im Gesamtjahr will das Unternehmen nun mindestens einen Umsatz von 420 Millionen Euro und eine Gewinnmarge von zwölf Prozent schaffen.

09.10 Uhr - Der Triebwerksbauer MTU Aero hat im zweiten Quartal bei Umsatz und Ergebnis die Erwartungen des Finanzmarktes übertroffen. Das Unternehmen erwirtschaftete einen operativen Gewinn von 164 (Prognose: 148) Millionen Euro und einen Umsatz von 1,286 (1,27) Milliarden Euro. Für das Gesamtjahr peilt es nun Erlöse von 5,3 statt 5,1 bis 5,2 Milliarden Euro an.

09.00 Uhr - Der französische Autokonzern Renault hat im ersten Halbjahr bei Absatz und Gewinn neue Rekorde eingefahren. Der operative Gewinn stieg um fast ein Fünftel auf 1,82 Milliarden Euro. Netto standen 2,4 Milliarden Euro zu Buche - nicht zuletzt dank eines hohen Gewinnbeitrags der Beteiligung Nissan<7201.T>, deren Ergebnis sich um mehr als 70 Prozent verbesserte.

08.27 Uhr - Der britische Telekomkonzern BT hat im abgelaufenen Quartal einen 42-prozentigen Einbruch des Vorsteuergewinns auf 418 Millionen Pfund (rund 468 Millionen Euro) hinnehmen müssen. Sonderlasten nach einem Bilanzskandal in Italien und einer Einigung mit der Deutschen Telekom und der französischen Orange waren dafür verantwortlich.

08.20 Uhr - Der Verkauf von Geschäftsteilen in Afrika kommt die britische Großbank Barclays teuer zu stehen. Durch die Trennung entstand in der Bilanz des ersten Halbjahres ein Verlust von 1,2 Milliarden Pfund, wie das Institut am Freitag mitteilte. Ohne diesen Sondereffekt lag der Halbjahresgewinn vor Steuern bei 2,3 Milliarden Pfund und damit 300 Millionen Pfund höher als im ersten Halbjahr 2016. Analysten hatten von den Briten allerdings einen Vorsteuergewinn von 2,7 Milliarden Pfund erwartet.

08.10 Uhr - Der französische Versorger Engie hat seinen Umsatz in der ersten Jahreshälfte leicht auf 33,1 Milliarden Euro gesteigert. Der Gewinn stagnierte bei fünf Milliarden Euro. Der Konzern bestätigte seine Jahresziele und sieht sich beim Umbau, der im kommenden Jahr abgeschlossen werden soll, über Plan.

08.00 Uhr - Die in Paris ansässige Mehrländer-Börse Euronext hat trotz der mauen Aktivität vieler Anleger im zweiten Quartal ihren Gewinn gesteigert. Das operative Ergebnis sei auf 79,2 (206: 77,7) Millionen Euro gestiegen, teilte der Betreiber von Kassa- und Derivate-Börsen in Paris, Amsterdam, Brüssel, London und Lissabon mit. Während andere Börsenbetreiber wie die Deutsche Börse teilweise von schwächeren Umsätzen berichtet hatten, stieg der tägliche Derivatehandel auf Euronext-Plattformen im zweiten Quartal um 27,3 Prozent.

07.50 Uhr - Die Fluggesellschaft Air France-KLM hat im zweiten Quartal von einem anziehenden Reisegeschäft profitiert und ihren Umsatz um 1,5 Prozent steigern können. Der operative Gewinn lag mit 496 Millionen Euro leicht über den Erwartungen von Branchenanalysten. Der französisch-niederländische Konzern veröffentlichte keine Jahresprognose, Analysten erwarten jedoch einen Jahresgewinn von rund 1,3 Milliarden Euro.

07.45 Uhr - Der französische Energieriese Electricite de France hat im ersten Halbjahr einen deutlichen Gewinnrückgang verkraften müssen. Das operative Ergebnis sei um ein Fünftel auf sieben Milliarden Euro abgerutscht, teilte das Unternehmen mit und machte dafür "unvorteilhafte Marktbedingungen" verantwortlich. Unter dem Strich blieb ein Gewinn von zwei Milliarden Euro - ein Minus von 3,7 Prozent. Seine Jahresziele bestätigte der Konzern.

07.40 Uhr - Der IT-Vermieter Grenke hat seinen Gewinn im ersten Halbjahr um fast 20 Prozent auf 78,8 Millionen Euro gesteigert und erhöht deshalb seine Prognose für das Gesamtjahr leicht. Es werde nun ein Jahresgewinn zwischen 118 und 124 Millionen Euro erwartet. Bislang war das Unternehmen von 113 bis 123 Millionen Euro ausgegangen.

07.32 Uhr - Der französische Gasekonzern Air Liquide hat im ersten Halbjahr Umsatz und Gewinn kräftig gesteigert. Unter dem Strich erwirtschaftete der Konkurrent des deutschen Linde-Konzerns in den ersten sechs Monaten 928 Millionen Euro, ein Plus von 14,5 Prozent. Der operstive Gewinn sprang sogar um mehr als 20 Prozent nach oben.

07.25 Uhr - Die spanische Großbank Santander hat dank eines brummenden Geschäfts in ihrem größten Markt Brasilien den Gewinn im zweiten Quartal um fast 40 Prozent auf 1,75 Milliarden Euro gesteigert. Das Institut hatte Anfang Juni den angeschlagenen heimischen Konkurrenten Banco Popular übernommen.

07.20 Uhr - Der erwartete Gewinnrückgang bei der französischen Großbank BNP Paribas fiel im zweiten Quartal dank Kostensenkungen und eines überraschend guten Geschäfts im Investmentbanking niedriger aus als erwartet. Der Nettogewinn von Frankreichs größtem börsennotierten Kreditinstitut sank zwischen April und Ende Juni um 6,4 Prozent auf knapp 2,4 Milliarden Euro. Von Reuters befragte Analysten hatten mit einem Gewinnrückgang auf 1,9 Milliarden Euro gerechnet.

07.10 Uhr - Der Spezialsoftwareanbieter Nemetschek hat im ersten Halbjahr seinen Umsatz um ein Fünftel auf 194 Millionen Euro gesteigert. Der operative Gewinn erreichte 51,7 Millionen Euro, was einer Rendite von 26,6 Prozent entspricht. Das Unternehmen beließ seinen Ausblick für das Gesamtjahr 2017 unverändert.

UPDATE 1-Exxon profit nearly doubles, but falls short of expectations - Reuters News

{{20170728T122937.641+0000}}UPDATE 1-Exxon profit nearly doubles, but falls short of expectations(Adds earnings comparison, stock, details)

By Ernest Scheyder

July 28 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp , the world's largest publicly traded oil producer, said on Friday its quarterly profit nearly doubled on surging margins at its operations outside the United States, but results fell shy of Wall Street's expectations.

Shares of Irving, Texas-based Exxon fell about 1.9 percent in premarket trading to $79.30.

While Exxon's U.S. portfolio, including its shale projects, lost money, Exxon's gas and oil operations across the world posted a 69 percent jump in profit.

The company sold more gasoline and kerosene in the quarter, boosting the bottom line as well, but sales of chemicals slipped due in part to plant maintenance costs and weak margins.

"Our job is to grow long-term value by investing in our integrated portfolio of opportunities that succeed regardless of market conditions," Chief Executive Darren Woods said in a statement.

The company posted second-quarter net income of $3.35 billion, or 78 cents per share, compared to $1.7 billion, or 41 cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts expected earnings of 84 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Production fell about 1.0 percent to 3.9 million barrels of oil equivalent per day.

The results come as Exxon battles its shareholders and others over climate change issues.

Exxon has been locked in an aggressive back-and-forth skirmish over climate change documents with New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who has sought to punish the oil producer for what he says are misleading public disclosures.[nL1N1IZ0N6]

Exxon's shareholders in May approved a resolution in May that called for the company to issue a report on how climate change affects operations. The vote, which was non-binding, passed with 62 percent of ballots cast and was a rare defeat for Exxon's management.[nL1N1IX15V]

What to Watch in the Day Ahead - Friday, July 28 - 路透新闻

To receive The Day Ahead, Eikon users can register at [DAY/US]. Thomson One users can register at RT/DAY/US. All times in ET/GMT)

The U.S Commerce Department issues its advanced second-quarter gross domestic product estimate, which is likely to have increased 2.6 percent compared with a 1.4 percent rise in the previous quarter. The Commerce Department will also report that advanced core PCE prices for the second quarter are forecast to rise 0.8 percent, but lower than a 2.0 percent rise in the first quarter. (0830/1230) The final reading of University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers Sentiment Index for July is expected to remain unchanged at 93.1 from the previous month. (1000/1400) The Labor Department issues the second quarter Employment Cost Index, which is likely to have gained 0.6 percent. (0830/1230)

Investor focus will be on the performance of Merck & Co Inc's high-profile cancer drug Keytruda as the drugmaker reports second-quarter results amid rising competition in the lung cancer market. Investors will also be looking for comments on the multiple myeloma trials, which were testing Keytruda in combination with Celgene's standard of care treatments, and were placed on clinical hold by the U.S regulator earlier this month. Meanwhile, AbbVie Inc also reports second quarter results that are likely to be helped by increased sales of its flagship drug, Humira. Investors will also look for comment on its cancer drug Imbruvica, which analysts expect to become an important revenue driver for the drugmaker.

Exxon Mobil Corp, the world's largest publicly traded oil producer, is expected to post a second quarter profit. Separately, U.S. oil producer Chevron Corp is also expected to post a second quarter profit.

Baker Hughes reports second quarter results. The world's second-largest oilfield services provider, created by Baker Hughes' merger with GE's oil and gas equipment operations, is expected to report quarterly revenue of $2.34 billion and a loss of 15 cents per share in its maiden quarterly release. Investors will be keen on knowing how the company plans to run its business in an uncertain oil market.

Barclays Plc reports first half earnings, with alleged misdeeds by bank executives past and present threatening to overshadow the lender's financial performance. Chief Executive Jes Staley faces a regulatory probe into his attempts to unmask a whistleblower, while the bank has hit headlines in recent months over the trial of its former CEO and others for conduct during its crisis-era Qatar bailout. From a business point of view investors may focus on whether Barclays repeats its dire first quarter bond trading performance, a problem which U.S. rivals saw continue into the period ended June.

Credit Suisse Group AG reports second quarter results. After raising 4 billion Swiss francs earlier this year to plug a hole in its balance sheet, Tidjane Thiam will give an update on his restructure of Switzerland's second-biggest bank two years into his tenure as CEO. Investors and analysts are keen to see healthy inflows at its core wealth management businesses, an improvement at its global markets trading division - the source of billions of dollars in losses last year - and progress in winding down its "bad bank".

Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co reports second quarter results. The U.S. tire maker is expected to report a drop in profit and revenue due to a decrease in its tire shipments. The company has been struggling with a decline in heavy-duty truck production in the United States as a result of oversupply in the market. The company has also been cutting costs and has hiked tire prices to counter higher raw material costs. Investors will look for updates on its long-term forecasts.

American Airlines Group Inc is expected to report strong second quarter financial results. The No. 1 U.S. airline in its June traffic report raised guidance on closely watched metrics including pre-tax margins and total revenue per available seat mile.

The Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis President Neel Kashkari participates in a moderated question-and-answer session before a Woodbury Area/St. Paul Chamber of Commerce event, Oakdale, Minneapolis. (1320/1720)

Canada's Bombardier Inc will report second quarter earnings amid industry speculation that the plane and train maker is poised to form new rail joint ventures with Germany's Siemens AG. Bombardier executives, however, are not expected to discuss recent media reports that the two companies could form separate joint ventures in signaling and rolling stock as early as August. Analysts will be watching for an update on the company's cash flow and whether Bombardier's guidance for 30 to 35 CSeries jet deliveries remains on track for 2017. Statistics Canada may report that the Canadian economy grew by 0.2 percent in May. The report is likely to support analysts' expectations that the economy maintained its momentum in the second quarter after a strong start to the year. (0830/1230)

Brazil's IGP-M price index for July, which includes wholesale and consumer prices, is forecast to fall 0.65 percent. The index had fallen 0.67 percent in June. The country's inflation has plunged as the economy struggles to recover from its worst recession on record. (0700/1100) The unemployment rate is expected to remain unchanged at 13.3 percent in June from the previous month.(0800/1200) Meanwhile, the country is expected to post a budget deficit of 19.25 billion reais in June compared with a deficit of 30.70 billion reais in May.(1000/1400) Chile's manufacturing output is expected to fall 1.1 percent in June from a year earlier.

{{20170725T122402.549+0000}}Trump'ın dış politika danışmanları arasında huzursuzluk kaynama noktasında John Walcott

WASHINGTON, 25 Temmuz (Reuters) - ABD Başkanı Donald Trump'ın önde gelen dış politika danışmanları arasında, politika ve bürokrasi ile ilişkilerde uğradıkları yenilgilerin yanı sıra görevlerinde bağımsız olmamanın yarattığı hoşnutsuzluk artıyor.

Yetkililer, dış politikada geleneksel "ABD önderliğini" savunan enternasyonalistler ile "Önce Amerika" yaklaşımını benimseyenler arasındaki çekişmelerin, hükümetteki dış politika ve istihbarat profesyonellerini bezdirdiğini söylüyorlar.

Dışişleri Bakanı Rex Tillerson'un dostlarıyla yaptığı sohbetlerde, "görevde bir yılı doldurursa kendisini talihli sayacağını" söylediği konuşuluyor.

Konuya yakın bir kaynak da Reuters'e "Tillerson kendi bakanlığında özerkliğe, bağımsızlığa ve denetime sahip olamamaktan ve görevini alışıldığı gibi yapamamaktan dolayı çok rahatsız olduğunu söyledi" dedi.

Tillerson'un görevden ayrılmasına ilişkin ise herhangi bir bilgiye sahip olmadığını da söyleyen aynı kaynak "Ancak durum iyiye gitmiyor, hatta bazı açılardan daha da kötüleşiyor" diye konuştu.

Tillerson'un görevden ayrılacağı yolundaki söylentiyi kesin bir dille reddeden sözcüsü R.C. Hammond ise, "Dünyanın Amerikan liderliğine çok acil ihtiyacı var ve Bakan da dikkatini buraya veriyor" dedi.

Suudi Arabistan, Birleşik Arap Emirlikleri, Bahreyn ve Mısır'ın geçen ay Katar'ı terörizmi finanse etmekle suçlayarak uyguladıkları boykot üzerine Tillerson bu ülkelerden ablukayı gevşetmelerini istemiş ve krizi sona erdirme yükümlüğünü her iki tarafa da paylaştırmıştı.

Tillerson'un bu açıklamasından yarım saat sonra ise Trump, Katar'ı önde gelen bir terör destekçisi olmakla suçlayarak, Katar'a uygulanan ambargoyu diğer Arap liderlerle birlikte hazırladıklarını ima eden ifadeler kullanmıştı.

Sözcü Hammond bu gelişmelerin ardından "Hükümet olarak akıl karıştıran sinyaller verdik, ama daha sonra durumu açıklığa kavuşturabildik" demişti.

Bu arada iki istihbarat görevlisi de ulusal güvenlik danışmanı H.R. McMaster'ın Beyaz Saray'da önemli dış politika konularındaki örgütsüzlük ve disiplinsizlikten şikayetçi olduğunu söylediler.

Kıdemli ulusal güvenlik yetkilileri, McMaster'in, yardımcısı Rusya direktörü Fiona Hill'in de katıldığı bir tutumla, Rusya Devlet Başkanı Vladimir Putin'e karşı sert tavır alınması yönündeki tavsiyesinin dikkate alınmamasından dolayı kırgın olduğunu söylüyorlar.

Trump, ABD istihbarat kurumlarının Rusya'nın 2016 başkanlık seçimine rakibi Hillary Clinton aleyhinde müdahale ettiği yolundaki görüşlerini dikkate almıyor.

Emekli bir korgeneral olan McMaster'ın Afganistan'da Taliban'la mücadele için daha çok asker gönderilmesi konusunun bitmek bilmeyen tartışmalarla uzamasından da rahatsız olduğu söyleniyor.

Dışişleri Bakanı olmadan önce Exxon Mobil Corp'un CEO'su olan Tillerson, yeni göreviyle eskisini karşılaştırması istendiğinde geçen ay şöyle konuşmuştu:

"(Exxon Mobil'de) son kararı veren bendim. Bu her zaman işleri kolaylaştırır, ne bekleyebileceğimi bilirdim ve çok eskiye dayanan disiplinli karar verme süreçlerimiz vardı. ABD hükümetinde ise böyle nitelikler yok."

By Ron Bousso

LONDON, July 21 (Reuters) - After a brief respite at the start of the year, the world's top oil and gas companies are set to double down on cost cutting as a recovery in crude prices after a three-year slump falters.

Corporate hopes were raised by a deal between members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other non-OPEC producers to cut production, which lifted oil prices above $58 a barrel in January, after they had slid to as low as $27 in 2016.

But Brent crude prices have since slipped back below $50 and banks have lowered price forecasts, amid surging output from the United States and other nations not bound by the global oil pact.

Investors are again focussing on the ability of top oil firms such as Exxon Mobil , Royal Dutch Shell and Total to live within their means and eke out profits when oil has failed to recover, as hoped, to $60.

The majors, often dubbed Big Oil, have already been through tough spending cuts since a collapse in crude prices since mid-2014 from above $100. They have shed thousands of jobs, scrapped projects, sold assets and squeezed service costs.

The painstaking effort has paid off.

Net income for Exxon, Chevron , Shell, BP , Total, Eni and Statoil is set to double on average in the quarter ending June 30 from a year earlier, even though oil prices are back as similar levels, according to analyst estimates compiled by Reuters.

By early 2017, management teams said their operations in 2017 would cover spending and dividend payouts at $60 a barrel, although for many firms this included using scrip programmes, when investors can opt for dividend payouts in shares not cash.

"MORE OF THE SAME"

But earlier savings may not now be enough, with Brent crude averaging below $50 in the second quarter and forecasts that the 2017 average will be $54. [O/POLL]

While net income for Q2 may climb year-on-year, the quarter-on-quarter picture is different. Compared to the first three months of the year, the second quarter will see net income fall by about 20 percent, according to analyst estimates.

"Given where oil prices are, 2017 is still a year of transition for these companies, and that is not necessarily supportive for investment," said Jason Kenney, head of pan-European oil and gas equity research at Banco Santander.

"The sector needs to continue doing more of the same," he said, referring to the ongoing need to reduce costs.

Dividend yield, the ratio between a firm's dividend payout and share price, has risen in recent weeks to near recent highs as share prices have slipped, underscoring investor concerns.

Shell, Statoil and Total kick off the Q2 earnings reports on Thursday, followed by Exxon and Chevron on Friday. BP reports on Aug. 1.

Majors were targetting break even at $55 a barrel and could further cut spending by delaying investments, simplifying offshore and other project designs and selling assets, Kenney said.

About two thirds of the industry's capital expenditure went to new projects, with the rest used to maintain existing output, Kenney added.

"OFF LIFE SUPPORT"

Company boards have taken different approaches to deal with the bumpy oil price recovery.

Exxon and Chevron have invested in U.S. shale oil in recent months, seeking to benefit from the relatively low development cost and the short time it takes to extract commercial oil.

Across the Atlantic, Shell, BP and Total have focussed more heavily on cutting costs of large, deepwater oil and gas projects to compete with the low-cost shale. [nL8N1JG4D4]

Analysts have rewarded some firms for their ongoing savings. Total holds 18 "strong buy" or "buy" recommendations, while Chevron has 17, among analysts polled by Reuters. Shell has 16.

Exxon holds the lowest number of "buy" recommendations at 8. Its high share price to earnings (P/E) ratio and a weaker production growth outlook make it less attractive, HSBC said.

Exxon shares are trading at a P/E ratio of 16.9, compared with Shell's 11.9 and BP's 10.3.

Oil majors have underperformed so far this year relative to the broader stock market . For some, that makes current valuations attractive. (See graphic: http://reut.rs/2twyZvW)

"The fundamental environment is looking quite good because this is an environment where (companies) can cut costs and reduce headcount and they don't have to develop anything," said Jonathan Waghorn, co-manager of the energy fund at Guinness Asset Management, which holds shares in Shell, BP, Total and Chevron. "They are off life support at $55 a barrel."

Saudi refinery operations not affected by transformer fire  - Reuters News

{{20170723T064229.333+0000}}Saudi refinery operations not affected by transformer fire KHOBAR, Saudi Arabia, July 23 (Reuters) - The Saudi Aramco Mobile Refinery (SAMREF) at Yanbu is operating normally after a fire hit a power transformer at the gate of the facility on Saturday, a spokesman for a Saudi government body was quoted as saying on the state news agency.

Operations are ongoing and have not been affected by the incident, which happened due to hot weather, Abdulrahman Al-Abdulqader, the spokesman for the Royal Commission for Jubail and Yanbu, which manages and operates industrial cities in Saudi Arabia. The fire broke out at 21:22 local time, according to the spokesman.

SAMREF is a joint venture between Saudi Aramco and U.S. Exxon Mobil which operates the 400,000 barrel per day (bpd) crude oil refinery in Yanbu on the Red Sea coast of Saudi Arabia.

A SAMREF spokesman could not be immediately reached for comment.

WEEKAHEAD

Investors, next week, will focus on the Federal Reserve's two-day policy meeting that will begin on Tuesday. Expectations that the U.S. central bank will leave key overnight borrowing costs unchanged partly fed the decline in short-term interest rate volatility. Markets will work through another spate of economic figures that include gross domestic product, data on labor costs, durable goods figures, consumer confidence index, single-family home prices and data on mortgage applications. On Friday, the gross domestic product for the second quarter is expected to have increased at a 2.6 percent annual rate. On the same day, the Employment Cost Index is likely to have gained 0.6 percent in the second quarter. On Tuesday, the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller composite index of 20 metropolitan areas, which measures U.S. single-family home prices, is expected to have increased 5.8 percent in May. In a separate report on the same day, the U.S. Conference Board is expected to show a drop in its consumer confidence index. The index is expected to have slipped to a reading of 116.5 in July, from 118.9 in June. The Mortgage Bankers Association's weekly index for mortgage applications is on the tap for Wednesday. On Thursday, overall orders for durable goods, items ranging from toasters to aircraft that are meant to last three years or more, are expected to have increased 2.6 percent in June.

A slew of Dow 30 companies, including chemicals conglomerate DuPont, industrial conglomerate United Technologies Corp, Scotch tape and Post-it notes maker 3M Co, Exxon Mobil Corp, Chevron and the heavy machinery manufacturer Caterpillar Inc are scheduled to report results next week. Exxon Mobil is expected to post profit in the second quarter on Friday. Chevron also reports its second-quarter results on the same day. DuPont is expected to report a rise in second-quarter profit on Tuesday, due to higher demand for seeds. As Dow and DuPont are nearing the completion of their deal, investors will keep an eye out for leadership of the combined company. 3M Co is also expected to report higher profit and revenue for the second-quarter on the same day, led by higher sales in its industrials unit, which makes industrial tapes and adhesives, and caters to automotive, aerospace, electronics and packaging industries. Meanwhile, Caterpillar is expected to report higher profit and revenue for the second quarter on Tuesday, helped by improving demand in the construction and energy industries. Separately, when United Technologies will post its second-quarter results on Tuesday, investors will be looking for updates on solving problems with its Pratt & Whitney engines, which have delayed delivery of some Airbus planes.

Amazon.com Inc is expected to report a rise in quarterly revenue on Thursday, helped by growth in its retail and cloud computing businesses. Investors will look for more details on Amazon's surprise $13.7 billion deal to buy upscale grocer Whole Foods Market, which could upend the already struggling U.S. retail industry. Investors will also focus on Amazon's current-quarter forecast, which will include sales from its annual Prime day shopping event that expanded to China, India and Mexico this year.

Facebook Inc reports second-quarter results on Wednesday. The social media giant is expected to post a rise in profit and revenue driven by its fast-growing mobile ad business. Facebook is searching for new types of advertising features to supplement its main revenue streams that it expects to cool off this year. Any update on its plans to beef up its features would be interesting.

On Tuesday, General Motors releases its second-quarter results, amid investor concern about declining demand in the United States. The company has already flagged higher-than-projected costs related to the sale of Opel to PSA. Ford Motor Co reports second-quarter results on Wednesday, the first since new CEO Jim Hackett took charge. He could elaborate on his plans to reevaluate Ford operations and speed decisions.

MasterCard Inc, the world's second-biggest payments processor is expected to report a rise in second-quarter profit on Thursday, with higher cross-border volumes growth. However, costs are expected to rise due to the two acquisitions it made in Q1, VocaLink and NuData Security. Investors will also look for any update on the card company's progress to start operations in China.

Eli Lilly & Co is likely to report higher second-quarter earnings on Tuesday, according to Thomson Reuters data, helped by strong sales of its diabetes treatments. Biogen Inc is also expected to report its second-quarter results before the bell on the same day. Investors will focus on the performance of Biogen's pricey new spinal muscular atrophy drug, Spinraza, amid slowing sales of its best-selling multiple sclerosis (MS) treatment Tecfidera. Meanwhile, Merck & Co. Inc will report its second-quarter results on Friday. Investor focus will be on the performance of the company's high-profile cancer drug Keytruda as the drugmaker reports second-quarter results amid rising competition in the lung cancer market. AbbVie Inc will also report second-quarter results on the same day, that is likely to be helped by increased sales of its flagship drug, Humira. Investors will also look for comment on its cancer drug Imbruvica, which analysts expect to become an important revenue driver for the drugmaker. Celgene Corp's second-quarter results scheduled for release on Thursday, are likely to be helped by sales of its blockbuster cancer drug, Revlimid, whose sales have slowed in the past few quarters.

Health insurer Anthem Inc reports second-quarter results before the bell on Wednesday in the wake of the failed Republican effort to overhaul or repeal Obamacare. Investors will look for comments from Anthem, which sells Blue Cross Blue Shield plans in 14 states, about the state of the health insurance industry. Mid-cap health insurer Centene Corp, which primarily focuses on government-sponsored plans, is set to report higher second-quarter earnings on Tuesday, due to acquisitions and increased membership. Investors will focus on how the health insurer keeps its medicaid business profitable amid changing dynamics of the health insurance industry under President Donald Trump's administration.

Boston Scientific Corp reports second-quarter results on Thursday. Investors will likely focus on Boston Scientific's heart device, Lotus valve system's performance in comparison to Medtronic Plc's CoreValve TAVI system. Analysts expect the company to outperform its large-cap med device peers as the company's robust pipeline products will contribute meaningfully to revenue.

AT&T is expected to post a fall in second-quarter revenue on Tuesday, as the largest U.S. TV provider looks to close its $85.4 billion acquisition of Time Warner. According to sources, AT&T will run its wireless and DirecTV satellite television businesses separately from Time Warner's media assets, analysts will be looking out for any commentary regarding this. On the wireless front, AT&T is likely to struggle to keep its subscribers amid stiff competition. Meanwhile, Verizon Communications Inc reports second-quarter results on Thursday. The No. 1 U.S. wireless carrier is expected to report its fifth straight quarter of revenue declines. The company, which has been facing stiff competition from smaller rivals such as T-Mobile and Sprint, are likely to lose customers to other players in the market.

Texas Instruments Inc reports second-quarter results on Tuesday. The chipmaker is expected to post a rise in quarterly revenue, helped by demand for analog and embedded chip products from the automotive and industrial markets.

Twitter Inc reports second-quarter results on Thursday. The microblogging service is expected to report its second fall in revenue in its latest quarter since its debut. Chief Executive Jack Dorsey, whose leadership has been questioned amidst stagnating user growth, is looking to shake things up for the company to cope with stiff competition from Facebook and Snapchat. However, Twitter reported better-than-expected growth in its monthly active users last quarter and any sign of that momentum continuing will be closely monitored as the company looks to woo users with a revamped interface and wider offerings.

Coca-Cola Co is expected to report second-quarter results on Wednesday. Coca-Cola is looking to cut costs, mainly by reducing 1,200 jobs, and invest in growing its non-carbonated beverage business amid falling demand for fizzy drinks globally. The company in April forecast a smaller decline in 2017 adjusted profit than it had previously expected.

McDonald's Corp is expected to report its second-quarter results on Tuesday. The company is seeking to reverse years of traffic declines at its U.S. restaurants with the introduction of cooked-to-order Quarter Pounders made from fresh beef, higher-end signature crafted sandwiches and mobile and kiosk ordering, while also testing home delivery. Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc also reports second-quarter results on the same day. Chipotle's fragile recovery from a string of food safety lapses in 2015 likely will overshadow Tuesday's quarterly financial report, which lands just days after the chain briefly closed a Virginia restaurant due to norovirus and a video of mice in a Dallas restaurant went viral.

Hershey Co reports second-quarter results on Wednesday. The Hershey Kisses and Cadbury chocolates maker's second-quarter sales is expected to grow as the company has been launching a flurry of new products to keep up with demand from snack-loving consumers in the United States, its home turf. The company has also been keeping a tight lid on costs to help mitigate loss from its China business.

General Dynamics Corp, the maker of Gulfstream jets, is expected to report higher revenue for the second quarter on Wednesday, helped by stable demand for its business jets in North America. Investors will look for an update on full-year financial forecast. U.S. weapons maker Northrop Grumman Corp is also expected to report higher profit and revenue for the second quarter on Wednesday, helped by higher sales in its aerospace unit, which makes parts for F-35 fighter jets, drones and spacecraft. Investors will look for an update on full-year financial forecast. Raytheon Co, the maker of Tomahawk missiles, is expected to report higher revenue in the second quarter on Thursday, as it sees increased demand for its products fueled by a pro-defense Trump administration and U.S. allies. Investors will look for an update on 2017 financial forecast. D.R. Horton Inc, the No.1 U.S. homebuilder is expected to report a rise in fourth-quarter revenue and profit on Wednesday, helped by higher home sales. An improving job market has supported U.S. housing demand but homebuilders continue to face land and labor shortages. Investors will look for the company's financial forecast and details on its pending deal with real estate developer Forestar Group Inc. On Tuesday, PulteGroup Inc, the third biggest U.S. homebuilder is expected to post increases in second-quarter profit and revenue as strong housing demand drives higher home sales. Investors will look for the details on the company's financial forecast.

Nasdaq, the transatlantic exchange operator, will report its second-quarter earnings on Wednesday. Net income is expected to rise, helped by higher trading revenue. Expenses are expected to fall. Nasdaq also bought Canadian stock trading venue CXC and news distribution company Marketwired last year and will continue to benefit from the acquisition. The exchange industry is in the midst of a wave of consolidation as companies seek to move more trading onto fewer technology platforms to boost profit margins.

The New York Times Co reports second-quarter results on Thursday. The newspaper publisher is expected to swing to a quarterly profit from a year-earlier loss, as it benefits from higher digital subscriptions. The Times has been investing in marketing to sign up more digital subscribers even as it cuts costs through restructuring that job cuts. It offered buyouts to some of its newsroom employees in May in an effort to streamline editing and production systems.

Citigroup holds its first day-long conference for investors since 2008 on Tuesday. Nearly a decade after Citigroup suspended "Investor Day" conferences during the financial crisis, bank executives say they are ready to again meet in an auditorium with big investors and securities analysts to talk about their strategy to boost shareholder returns. The conference comes after Chief Executive Mike Corbat failed to meet performance targets that he set in 2013 shortly after directors fired the previous CEO and put Corbat in charge.

Canada's second-largest oil and gas producer, Suncor Energy Inc, reports second-quarter earnings on Wednesday. Suncor has endured lower-than-expected oil prices and problems at the Syncrude oil sands plant, in which it is the majority owner. Investors will look for updates to Suncor's strategy and progress reports on Syncrude and the company's new Fort Hills and Hebron projects.

Alaska Air Group reports second-quarter results on Wednesday. Analysts expect Alaska Air's results to improve from the preceding quarter's steep earnings drop. The West Coast airline in December bought rival Virgin America in a $2.6 billion deal to become the fifth-largest U.S. carrier.

The main economic event in Canada next week will be monthly gross domestic product for May, released on Friday. The report will likely support analysts' expectations that the economy maintained its momentum in the second quarter after a strong start to the year. Stronger-than-expected growth could also underscore expectations that the Bank of Canada will hike interest rates again in the coming months.

ON MONDAY

Google's parent company, Alphabet Inc, is expected to report increases in second-quarter profit and revenue, helped by strong advertising sales on mobile devices and for video content. The company's cloud computing business has long trailed those of Amazon.com Inc and Microsoft Corp, although it has managed to win some major deals. Investors will look for updates on Google's plan to beef up its cloud business, as its dependence on search has been a worry.

Six ministers from OPEC and non-OPEC nations Kuwait, Venezuela, Algeria, Saudi Arabia, Russia and Oman as well as OPEC's secretary general will meet in St Petersburg, Russia to discuss the current situation in the oil market.

Halliburton Co is expected to report a profit in the second quarter, compared to a year-ago loss, helped by increased demand for its pressure pumping and well-construction services.

Investors will see whether Halliburton can keep up the optimistic tone set by market leader Schlumberger.

A newly established U.S.-UK trade and investment working group will hold its first meeting in Washington to scope out plans for a potential free trade agreement between the two countries after Brexit.

By Ron Bousso

LONDON, July 21 (Reuters) - After a brief respite at the start of the year, the world's top oil and gas companies are set to double down on cost cutting as a recovery in crude prices after a three-year slump falters.

Corporate hopes were raised by a deal between members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other non-OPEC producers to cut production, which lifted oil prices above $58 a barrel in January, after they had slid to as low as $27 in 2016.

But Brent crude prices have since slipped back below $50 and banks have lowered price forecasts, amid surging output from the United States and other nations not bound by the global oil pact.

Investors are again focussing on the ability of top oil firms such as Exxon Mobil , Royal Dutch Shell and Total to live within their means and eke out profits when oil has failed to recover, as hoped, to $60.

The majors, often dubbed Big Oil, have already been through tough spending cuts since a collapse in crude prices since mid-2014 from above $100. They have shed thousands of jobs, scrapped projects, sold assets and squeezed service costs.

The painstaking effort has paid off.

Net income for Exxon, Chevron , Shell, BP , Total, Eni and Statoil is set to double on average in the quarter ending June 30 from a year earlier, even though oil prices are back as similar levels, according to analyst estimates compiled by Reuters.

By early 2017, management teams said their operations in 2017 would cover spending and dividend payouts at $60 a barrel, although for many firms this included using scrip programmes, when investors can opt for dividend payouts in shares not cash.

"MORE OF THE SAME"

But earlier savings may not now be enough, with Brent crude averaging below $50 in the second quarter and forecasts that the 2017 average will be $54. [O/POLL]

While net income for Q2 may climb year-on-year, the quarter-on-quarter picture is different. Compared to the first three months of the year, the second quarter will see net income fall by about 20 percent, according to analyst estimates.

"Given where oil prices are, 2017 is still a year of transition for these companies, and that is not necessarily supportive for investment," said Jason Kenney, head of pan-European oil and gas equity research at Banco Santander.

"The sector needs to continue doing more of the same," he said, referring to the ongoing need to reduce costs.

Dividend yield, the ratio between a firm's dividend payout and share price, has risen in recent weeks to near recent highs as share prices have slipped, underscoring investor concerns.

Shell, Statoil and Total kick off the Q2 earnings reports on Thursday, followed by Exxon and Chevron on Friday. BP reports on Aug. 1.

Majors were targetting break even at $55 a barrel and could further cut spending by delaying investments, simplifying offshore and other project designs and selling assets, Kenney said.

About two thirds of the industry's capital expenditure went to new projects, with the rest used to maintain existing output, Kenney added.

"OFF LIFE SUPPORT"

Company boards have taken different approaches to deal with the bumpy oil price recovery.

Exxon and Chevron have invested in U.S. shale oil in recent months, seeking to benefit from the relatively low development cost and the short time it takes to extract commercial oil.

Across the Atlantic, Shell, BP and Total have focussed more heavily on cutting costs of large, deepwater oil and gas projects to compete with the low-cost shale. [nL8N1JG4D4]

Analysts have rewarded some firms for their ongoing savings. Total holds 18 "strong buy" or "buy" recommendations, while Chevron has 17, among analysts polled by Reuters. Shell has 16.

Exxon holds the lowest number of "buy" recommendations at 8. Its high share price to earnings (P/E) ratio and a weaker production growth outlook make it less attractive, HSBC said.

Exxon shares are trading at a P/E ratio of 16.9, compared with Shell's 11.9 and BP's 10.3.

Oil majors have underperformed so far this year relative to the broader stock market . For some, that makes current valuations attractive. (See graphic: http://reut.rs/2twyZvW)

"The fundamental environment is looking quite good because this is an environment where (companies) can cut costs and reduce headcount and they don't have to develop anything," said Jonathan Waghorn, co-manager of the energy fund at Guinness Asset Management, which holds shares in Shell, BP, Total and Chevron. "They are off life support at $55 a barrel."

FOKUS 1-US-Ölfeldausrüster Schlumberger will russischen Rivalen - Reuters (German)

{{20170721T122343.060+0000}}FOKUS 1-US-Ölfeldausrüster Schlumberger will russischen Rivalen* Schlumberger bietet für Eurasia Drilling

* Russische Wettbewerbshüter müssen noch zustimmen

* Schlumberger profitiert derzeit von US-Schieferölboom

(Neu: Schlumberger-Geschäftszahlen)

Moskau/Bangalore, 21. Jul (Reuters) - Ein halbes Jahr nach dem Regierungswechsel in den USA unternimmt der Ölfeldausrüster Schlumberger einen zweiten Anlauf zur Übernahme des russischen Branchenführers Eurasia Drilling Co (EDC). Dieser gab am Freitag die Veräußerung einer Mehrheitsbeteiligung von 51 Prozent an den Weltmarktprimus bekannt. Kommt der Deal zustande, wäre es der erste Zukauf eines amerikanischen Konzerns in der Branche auf dem russischen Markt seit der Verhängung von Sanktionen gegen Russland im Zuge der Ukraine-Krise im Jahr 2014.

EDC-Chef Alexander Djaparidse betonte die jahrelangen Geschäftsverbindungen mit dem US-Konzern und erklärte: "Ich heiße Schlumberger als unseren neuen Mehrheitsaktionär herzlich willkommen." Allerdings steht die Zustimmung der russischen Behörden noch aus. Ein Kreml-Sprecher lehnte eine Aussage dazu ab, ob Russland inzwischen mit Wohlwollen auf den US-Investor blickt. Schlumbergers erster Versuch im Jahr 2015 war daran gescheitert, dass die zuständige Behörde ihre Zustimmung mehrfach verschob. Damals wollte der US-Konzern knapp 46 Prozent der EDC-Anteile für 1,7 Milliarden Dollar kaufen.

Inzwischen ist aber der frühere Ölmanager Rex Tillerson US-Außenminister. In dieser Position ist der ehemalige Chef von Exxon Mobil mit dafür zuständig, Entscheidungen über Sanktionen zu treffen. Er gilt als russlandfreundlich und hat wiederholt die gegen das Land verhängten Strafmaßnahmen kritisiert.[nL5N1E74LZ][nL5N1KC0BT]

Zuletzt hatte der US-Senat neue Sanktionen gegen Russland beschlossen, was in der Energiebranche für einen Aufschrei sorgte. Warnungen vor eklatanten Auswirkungen auf die Öl- und Gasversorgung wurden laut.[nL5N1KA5HO] Um Gesetzeskraft zu erlangen, muss die Vorlage allerdings noch das Repräsentantenhaus passieren und von US-Präsident Donald Trump unterzeichnet werden.[nL8N1JC1VV] Für Trump ist das Thema Russland zu einer schweren Hypothek geworden, die seine bisherige Amtszeit belastet. Ein Sonderermittler und Parlamentsausschüsse untersuchen, ob es unzulässige Absprachen zwischen Trumps Wahlkampfteam und der Regierung in Moskau gab.[nL5N1KB1YP]

Für westliche Konzerne ist das Russland-Geschäft deswegen interessant, weil die dortigen Ölfirmen trotz der gesunkenen Preise an ihren Investitionen festhalten. Schlumberger profitierte zuletzt insbesondere vom Schieferölboom in den USA. Der Umsatz stieg im abgelaufenen Quartal um 4,2 Prozent auf 7,46 Milliarden Dollar, der Verlust reduzierte sich kräftig auf 74 Millionen Dollar nach 2,16 Milliarden Dollar vor einem Jahr.

WDHLG-FOKUS 1-Strafe gegen Exxon wegen Russland-Deals unter Tillerson - Reuters (German)

{{20170721T043203.671+0000}}WDHLG-FOKUS 1-Strafe gegen Exxon wegen Russland-Deals unter Tillerson(Wiederholung vom Vorabend)

* US-Regierung verhängt Strafe wegen Sanktionsverstößen

* Geschäfte wurden 2014 unter heutigem Außenminister getätigt

* Exxon wehrt sich juristisch gegen die Entscheidung - "Unfair"

Washington/Houston, 20. Jul (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil ist wegen Russland-Geschäften zu Zeiten von US-Außenminister Rex Tillerson als Chef des Ölmultis ins Visier der heimischen Behörden geraten. Das US-Finanzministerium verhängte eine Strafe von zwei Millionen Dollar wegen Sanktionsverstößen vor gut drei Jahren. Exxon habe damals die Vorschriften "rücksichtlos missachtet", erklärte das Ministerium am Donnerstag in einer ungewöhnlich ausführlichen Stellungnahme. Konkret wird Exxon vorgeworfen, dass führende Manager im Mai 2014 Vereinbarungen über Öl- und Gasprojekte zusammen mit dem Präsidenten des russischen Konkurrenten Rosneft, Igor Setschin, unterzeichneten - wenige Wochen, nachdem die USA wegen des Ukraine-Konflikts Sanktionen gegen Russland verhängt hatten.

Die US-Regierung hatte Setschin damals wegen seiner engen Verbindung zum russischen Präsidenten Wladimir Putin auf eine schwarzen Liste gesetzt. Die Sanktionen verbieten es in den USA Ansässigen, Geschäfte mit Personen auf dieser Liste zu tätigen. Die nun verhängte Strafe resultiert aus einer Untersuchung jener Vereinbarungen, die Exxon-Manager damals mit Setschin getroffen hatten. Exxon geht juristisch gegen die Strafe vor und bezeichnete die Entscheidung als "grundlegend unfair".

Tillerson hatte Exxon zehn Jahre lang geleitet, bevor er unter US-Präsident Donald Trump zum Außenminister ernannt wurde. In dieser Position ist er mit dafür zuständig, Entscheidungen über Sanktionen zu treffen. Er gilt als russlandfreundlich und hat wiederholt die gegen das Land verhängten Strafmaßnahmen kritisiert. Daran war auch ein Plan für ein Exxon-Rosneft-Gemeinschaftsunternehmen gescheitert. Rosneft-Chef Setschin bezeichnete Tillerson einmal als Freund, mit dem er gerne mal die Vereinigten Staaten auf dem Motorrad durchqueren wolle.[nL5N1E74LZ]

ПОВТОР-Минфин США оштрафовал Exxon Mobil на $2 млн за дела с Сечиным - Reuters (Russian)

{{20170721T040001.550+0000}}ПОВТОР-Минфин США оштрафовал Exxon Mobil на $2 млн за дела с СечинымВАШИНГТОН, 20 июл (Рейтер) - Министерство финансов США в четверг оштрафовало американский нефтяной концерн Exxon Mobil Corp и несколько его "дочек" на $2 миллиона за нарушение в мае 2014 года санкций против Игоря Сечина - главы крупнейшей нефтяной компании России Роснефть .

Пресс-секретарь Роснефти Михаил Леонтьев сказал, что не видит связи между этим событием и дальнейшим сотрудничеством Роснефти с Exxon.

Управление по контролю за иностранными активами Минфина США обнаружило, что Exxon Mobil добровольно не сообщила о нарушениях, и пришло к выводу, что "эти нарушения представляют собой вопиющий случай", говорится в сообщении, опубликованном на сайте ведомства (http://bit.ly/2vnvQf2).

Главы американских "дочек" нефтяного гиганта имели дело с теми, "чья собственность и имущественные интересы были заблокированы, в частности, подписав восемь юридических документов, связанных с нефтегазовыми проектами в России, с Игорем Сечиным, главой ОАО Роснефть" и еще одним лицом, попавшим под санкции, сообщил Минфин США.

Роснефть говорит, что американский регулятор не мог не знать о подписании документов в 2014 году.

"Три года документы находились в абсолютном доступе, и мы исключаем возможность, что OFAC про это не знал. Зная, как Exxon работает во всех вопросах с американскими санкциями, мы исключаем возможность, что Exxon не получил исчерпывающих для него разъяснений, пояснений и разрешенй от этого американского регулятора и его санкционных юристов", - сказал Леонтьев по телефону Рейтер.

UPDATE 3-Exxon sues U.S. over fine levied for Russia deal under Tillerson - Reuters News

{{20170720T230108.805+0000}}UPDATE 3-Exxon sues U.S. over fine levied for Russia deal under Tillerson(Recasts, adds material from lawsuit)

By Yeganeh Torbati and Ernest Scheyder

WASHINGTON/HOUSTON, July 20 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp sued the U.S. government on Thursday, blasting as "unlawful" and "capricious" a $2 million fine levied against it for a three-year-old oil joint venture with Russia's Rosneft .

The U.S. Treasury Department on Thursday morning slapped the world's largest publicly traded oil producer with the fine for "reckless disregard" of U.S. sanctions in dealings with Russia in 2014 when Secretary of State Rex Tillerson was Exxon's chief executive.

The lawsuit and the Treasury's unusually detailed statement on Exxon's conduct represented an extraordinary confrontation between a major American company and the U.S. government, made all the more striking because Exxon's former CEO is now in President Donald Trump's Cabinet.

Exxon took the government to court despite the fact that the fine, the maximum allowed, would have a minor impact on the company, which made $7.84 billion in profit last year.

The fine came after a U.S. review of deals Exxon signed with Rosneft, Russia's largest oil producer, weeks after Washington imposed sanctions on Moscow for annexing Ukraine's Crimea region.

Between May 14 and May 23, 2014, top U.S.-based Exxon executives signed eight documents with Igor Sechin, the head of state-run Rosneft, the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) said in the statement on its website.

OFAC said Exxon had "demonstrated reckless disregard for U.S. sanctions requirements" by signing the deals with Sechin just weeks after the United States blacklisted him, OFAC said in the three-page statement. (For the statement, see: http://bit.ly/2vnvQf2)

The Treasury imposed sanctions on Sechin in April 2014 as part of measures to pressure Russia over its intervention in Ukraine, saying Sechin had shown "utter loyalty" to Russian President Vladimir Putin.

The sanctions prohibit U.S. citizens or people in the United States from dealing with those on the blacklist, such as Sechin. Rosneft itself is subject to narrower U.S. sanctions that still allow Americans to deal with the company on some transactions.

Exxon said in a statement that OFAC's action was "fundamentally unfair," and sued the U.S. government in Texas in an effort to overturn the decision. The company is based in Irving, Texas.

In its 21-page complaint, Exxon argued that Sechin "was subject to sanctions only in his individual capacity" and that guidance from the Obama administration at the time made clear that the sanctions "applied only to the 'personal assets' of the sanctioned individuals and emphasized that the sanctions did not restrict business with the companies those individuals managed."

(For Exxon's complaint, see: http://exxonmobil.co/2uNRWdr)

TILLERSON NOT CONSULTED

Tillerson left Exxon late last year to become secretary of state after 10 years running the company. He is now responsible for U.S. foreign policy, which includes helping make sanctions decisions.

The State Department referred questions about the fine to Exxon and the Treasury. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert told reporters on Thursday that the agency was alerted to the fine on Wednesday.

A Treasury spokesman said OFAC engaged with Exxon's lawyers only, and "did not discuss this case with Secretary Tillerson."

Tillerson said in January that he would recuse himself from matters involving Exxon for one year after his December 2016 resignation, unless he is authorized to participate.

Though the State Department plays a major part in formulating sanctions policy, former U.S. officials and sanctions experts said it was unlikely the agency had a role in deciding the fine announced on Thursday, because it falls under OFAC's regulatory role.

The back-and-forth between the Treasury and Exxon over the 2014 dealings spanned both the Obama and Trump administrations, and started with a subpoena from OFAC to Exxon in July 2014, Exxon said in its complaint.

Exxon fully complied with guidance from Democratic former President Barack Obama's administration that ongoing oil and gas business activities with Rosneft were permitted, Exxon spokesman Alan Jeffers said in a statement.

The Treasury "is trying to retroactively enforce a new interpretation of an executive order" inconsistent with its prior guidance, Jeffers said. "OFAC's action is fundamentally unfair."

Exxon also cited a Treasury Department representative's comments in May 2014 that BP Plc Chief Executive Bob Dudley - an American citizen - could continue to participate in Rosneft board meetings so long as they related only to Rosneft's business.

In its statement explaining the fine, OFAC said that the Treasury Department representative's comments did not address Exxon's conduct. BP did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Publicly available guidance on the Treasury's website at the time of Exxon's dealings with Sechin said Americans should ensure they do not enter into contracts signed by sanctioned individuals, OFAC said.

And by dealing with Sechin, the company "caused significant harm" to U.S. sanctions on Russia, the agency said.

Because Rosneft itself is not off-limits to Americans, another company executive could have signed the contract with no sanctions risk to Exxon, said David Mortlock, who was a State Department and White House sanctions official under Obama.

"You could have Sechin standing over the guy's shoulder," said Mortlock, now an attorney at Willkie Farr & Gallagher LLP in Washington. "But the problem here is that it was signed by Sechin himself."

Exxon said that approach would have flown in the face of standard business practice.

"You don't ask your business partner to have someone else sign instead of the CEO," said Exxon spokesman Jeffers.

OPPOSITION TO SANCTIONS

Exxon has long opposed U.S. sanctions on Russia, saying they harm American business interests and actually help European rivals.

Tillerson said in 2014 that the company did not support sanctions because they are not effective "unless they are very well implemented."

Sanctions were a contentious topic at Tillerson's confirmation hearing last January. At the time, Republican and Democratic lawmakers were concerned that Trump, whose associates are now under investigation for their ties to Russia, would try to quickly lift U.S. sanctions on the country.

"When sanctions are imposed, they by their design are going to harm American business," Tillerson said during the hearing, in response to a question about his views on them.

He also said that Exxon "never directly lobbied against sanctions," a claim that was immediately challenged by senators who cited Exxon's own lobbying disclosure forms.

The case is Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Steve Munchin, et al, U.S. District Court, North District of Texas, No. 3:17-cv-1930.

FOKUS 1-Strafe gegen Exxon wegen Russland-Deals unter Tillerson - Reuters (German)

{{20170720T210812.729+0000}}FOKUS 1-Strafe gegen Exxon wegen Russland-Deals unter Tillerson(neu: Exxon klagt, Stellungnahme Finanzministerium, Kontext)

* US-Regierung verhängt Strafe wegen Sanktionsverstößen

* Geschäfte wurden 2014 unter heutigem Außenminister getätigt

* Exxon wehrt sich juristisch gegen die Entscheidung - "Unfair"

Washington/Houston, 20. Jul (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil ist wegen Russland-Geschäften zu Zeiten von US-Außenminister Rex Tillerson als Chef des Ölmultis ins Visier der heimischen Behörden geraten. Das US-Finanzministerium verhängte eine Strafe von zwei Millionen Dollar wegen Sanktionsverstößen vor gut drei Jahren. Exxon habe damals die Vorschriften "rücksichtlos missachtet", erklärte das Ministerium am Donnerstag in einer ungewöhnlich ausführlichen Stellungnahme. Konkret wird Exxon vorgeworfen, dass führende Manager im Mai 2014 Vereinbarungen über Öl- und Gasprojekte zusammen mit dem Präsidenten des russischen Konkurrenten Rosneft, Igor Setschin, unterzeichneten - wenige Wochen, nachdem die USA wegen des Ukraine-Konflikts Sanktionen gegen Russland verhängt hatten.

Die US-Regierung hatte Setschin damals wegen seiner engen Verbindung zum russischen Präsidenten Wladimir Putin auf eine schwarzen Liste gesetzt. Die Sanktionen verbieten es in den USA Ansässigen, Geschäfte mit Personen auf dieser Liste zu tätigen. Die nun verhängte Strafe resultiert aus einer Untersuchung jener Vereinbarungen, die Exxon-Manager damals mit Setschin getroffen hatten. Exxon geht juristisch gegen die Strafe vor und bezeichnete die Entscheidung als "grundlegend unfair".

Tillerson hatte Exxon zehn Jahre lang geleitet, bevor er unter US-Präsident Donald Trump zum Außenminister ernannt wurde. In dieser Position ist er mit dafür zuständig, Entscheidungen über Sanktionen zu treffen. Er gilt als russlandfreundlich und hat wiederholt die gegen das Land verhängten Strafmaßnahmen kritisiert. Daran war auch ein Plan für ein Exxon-Rosneft-Gemeinschaftsunternehmen gescheitert. Rosneft-Chef Setschin bezeichnete Tillerson einmal als Freund, mit dem er gerne mal die Vereinigten Staaten auf dem Motorrad durchqueren wolle.[nL5N1E74LZ]

EEUU dice que Exxon violó sanciones a Rusia en 2014, cuando Tillerson era su presidente ejecutivo - Reuters (Spanish)

{{20170720T200520.805+0000}}EEUU dice que Exxon violó sanciones a Rusia en 2014, cuando Tillerson era su presidente ejecutivoPor Yeganeh Torbati y Ernest Scheyder

WASHINGTON/HOUSTON, 20 jul (Reuters) - Estados Unidos reprendió el jueves a Exxon Mobil Corp por su "desacato temerario" de las sanciones impuestas a los negocios con Rusia en 2014, cuando el actual secretario de Estado, Rex Tillerson, era el presidente ejecutivo de la firma, y la multó con 2 millones de dólares.

ExxonMobil dijo que la decisión fue "fundamentalmente injusta" y demandó al gobierno en Texas con el objetivo de revertirla.

La multa fue impuesta tras una revisión de los acuerdos firmados por Exxon con el principal productor petrolero ruso, Rosneft , semanas después de que Washington impusiera sanciones a Moscú por la anexión de la región ucraniana de Crimea.

Entre el 14 y el 24 de mayo de 2014, altos ejecutivos de ExxonMobil rubricaron ocho documentos con Igor Sechin, presidente de la estatal Rosneft, aseguró la Oficina de Control de Activos Extranjeros del Departamento del Tesoro (OFAC, por sus siglas en inglés) en un comunicado en su sitio web.

ExxonMobil "demostró un desacato temerario de los requisitos incluidos en las sanciones estadounidenses" al firmar acuerdos con Sechin semanas después de que Washington lo incluyera en una lista negra, indicó la OFAC en un comunicado inusualmente largo de tres páginas con sus razonamientos.

El Tesoro anunció las sanciones en abril de 2014, como parte de las medidas aprobadas para presionar a Rusia por su intervención en Ucrania, asegurando que Sechin mostró una "lealtad absoluta" al presidente ruso, Vladimir Putin.

Tillerson abandonó ExxonMobil para convertirse en secretario de Estado tras 10 años al frente de la petrolera. Ahora es el responsable de la política exterior de Estados Unidos, un cargo que incluye colaborar en las decisiones sobre sanciones.

El monto de la multa es muy pequeño para ExxonMobil, que tuvo ganancias por 7.840 millones de dólares en 2016.

LEAD 1-Exxon à l'amende pour avoir contourné les sanctions contre Moscou - Reuters (French)

{{20170720T192746.646+0000}}LEAD 1-Exxon à l'amende pour avoir contourné les sanctions contre Moscou(Actualisé avec réaction Exxon)

WASHINGTON, 20 juillet (Reuters) - Le département du Trésor américain a condamné jeudi la société ExxonMobil et ses filiales américaines à payer une amende de deux millions de dollars (1,7 million d'euros) pour avoir contourné les sanctions contre la Russie, liées à son soutien aux rebelles ukrainiens, en mai 2014.

Le Bureau du contrôle des avoirs étrangers (OFAC) indique que la société ExxonMobil n'a pas révélé elle-même avoir transgressé les sanctions et estime qu'il s'agit d'une infraction flagrante.

ExxonMobil a dénoncé une décision "fondamentalement injuste" et déposé un recours contre le gouvernement de l'Etat du Texas dans l'espoir d'annuler la sanction.

Entre les 14 et 23 mai 2014, des dirigeants d'Exxon ont signé huit documents en lien avec des projets pétrolier et gazier en Russie avec Igor Setchine, le président de Rosneft OAO, dont les biens et les intérêts étaient bloqués par des sanctions américaines, a indiqué le Trésor américain.

Le porte-parole d'exxon, Alan Jeffers, a déclaré que l'administration Obama n'interdisait pas à l'époque de conclure des contrats avec Rosneft et Igor Setchine a signé les documents au nom de Rosneft, a-t-il souligné.

Le groupe pétrolier était alors dirigé par l'actuel secrétaire d'Etat américain, Rex Tillerson.

WDHLG-FOKUS 1-Strafe gegen Exxon wegen Russland-Deals unter Tillerson - Reuters (German)

{{20170721T043203.671+0000}}WDHLG-FOKUS 1-Strafe gegen Exxon wegen Russland-Deals unter Tillerson(Wiederholung vom Vorabend)

* US-Regierung verhängt Strafe wegen Sanktionsverstößen

* Geschäfte wurden 2014 unter heutigem Außenminister getätigt

* Exxon wehrt sich juristisch gegen die Entscheidung - "Unfair"

Washington/Houston, 20. Jul (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil ist wegen Russland-Geschäften zu Zeiten von US-Außenminister Rex Tillerson als Chef des Ölmultis ins Visier der heimischen Behörden geraten. Das US-Finanzministerium verhängte eine Strafe von zwei Millionen Dollar wegen Sanktionsverstößen vor gut drei Jahren. Exxon habe damals die Vorschriften "rücksichtlos missachtet", erklärte das Ministerium am Donnerstag in einer ungewöhnlich ausführlichen Stellungnahme. Konkret wird Exxon vorgeworfen, dass führende Manager im Mai 2014 Vereinbarungen über Öl- und Gasprojekte zusammen mit dem Präsidenten des russischen Konkurrenten Rosneft, Igor Setschin, unterzeichneten - wenige Wochen, nachdem die USA wegen des Ukraine-Konflikts Sanktionen gegen Russland verhängt hatten.

Die US-Regierung hatte Setschin damals wegen seiner engen Verbindung zum russischen Präsidenten Wladimir Putin auf eine schwarzen Liste gesetzt. Die Sanktionen verbieten es in den USA Ansässigen, Geschäfte mit Personen auf dieser Liste zu tätigen. Die nun verhängte Strafe resultiert aus einer Untersuchung jener Vereinbarungen, die Exxon-Manager damals mit Setschin getroffen hatten. Exxon geht juristisch gegen die Strafe vor und bezeichnete die Entscheidung als "grundlegend unfair".

Tillerson hatte Exxon zehn Jahre lang geleitet, bevor er unter US-Präsident Donald Trump zum Außenminister ernannt wurde. In dieser Position ist er mit dafür zuständig, Entscheidungen über Sanktionen zu treffen. Er gilt als russlandfreundlich und hat wiederholt die gegen das Land verhängten Strafmaßnahmen kritisiert. Daran war auch ein Plan für ein Exxon-Rosneft-Gemeinschaftsunternehmen gescheitert. Rosneft-Chef Setschin bezeichnete Tillerson einmal als Freund, mit dem er gerne mal die Vereinigten Staaten auf dem Motorrad durchqueren wolle.[nL5N1E74LZ]

ПОВТОР-Минфин США оштрафовал Exxon Mobil на $2 млн за дела с Сечиным - Reuters (Russian)

{{20170721T040001.550+0000}}ПОВТОР-Минфин США оштрафовал Exxon Mobil на $2 млн за дела с СечинымВАШИНГТОН, 20 июл (Рейтер) - Министерство финансов США в четверг оштрафовало американский нефтяной концерн Exxon Mobil Corp и несколько его "дочек" на $2 миллиона за нарушение в мае 2014 года санкций против Игоря Сечина - главы крупнейшей нефтяной компании России Роснефть .

Пресс-секретарь Роснефти Михаил Леонтьев сказал, что не видит связи между этим событием и дальнейшим сотрудничеством Роснефти с Exxon.

Управление по контролю за иностранными активами Минфина США обнаружило, что Exxon Mobil добровольно не сообщила о нарушениях, и пришло к выводу, что "эти нарушения представляют собой вопиющий случай", говорится в сообщении, опубликованном на сайте ведомства (http://bit.ly/2vnvQf2).

Главы американских "дочек" нефтяного гиганта имели дело с теми, "чья собственность и имущественные интересы были заблокированы, в частности, подписав восемь юридических документов, связанных с нефтегазовыми проектами в России, с Игорем Сечиным, главой ОАО Роснефть" и еще одним лицом, попавшим под санкции, сообщил Минфин США.

Роснефть говорит, что американский регулятор не мог не знать о подписании документов в 2014 году.

"Три года документы находились в абсолютном доступе, и мы исключаем возможность, что OFAC про это не знал. Зная, как Exxon работает во всех вопросах с американскими санкциями, мы исключаем возможность, что Exxon не получил исчерпывающих для него разъяснений, пояснений и разрешенй от этого американского регулятора и его санкционных юристов", - сказал Леонтьев по телефону Рейтер.

UPDATE 3-Exxon sues U.S. over fine levied for Russia deal under Tillerson - Reuters News

{{20170720T230108.805+0000}}UPDATE 3-Exxon sues U.S. over fine levied for Russia deal under Tillerson(Recasts, adds material from lawsuit)

By Yeganeh Torbati and Ernest Scheyder

WASHINGTON/HOUSTON, July 20 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp sued the U.S. government on Thursday, blasting as "unlawful" and "capricious" a $2 million fine levied against it for a three-year-old oil joint venture with Russia's Rosneft .

The U.S. Treasury Department on Thursday morning slapped the world's largest publicly traded oil producer with the fine for "reckless disregard" of U.S. sanctions in dealings with Russia in 2014 when Secretary of State Rex Tillerson was Exxon's chief executive.

The lawsuit and the Treasury's unusually detailed statement on Exxon's conduct represented an extraordinary confrontation between a major American company and the U.S. government, made all the more striking because Exxon's former CEO is now in President Donald Trump's Cabinet.

Exxon took the government to court despite the fact that the fine, the maximum allowed, would have a minor impact on the company, which made $7.84 billion in profit last year.

The fine came after a U.S. review of deals Exxon signed with Rosneft, Russia's largest oil producer, weeks after Washington imposed sanctions on Moscow for annexing Ukraine's Crimea region.

Between May 14 and May 23, 2014, top U.S.-based Exxon executives signed eight documents with Igor Sechin, the head of state-run Rosneft, the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) said in the statement on its website.

OFAC said Exxon had "demonstrated reckless disregard for U.S. sanctions requirements" by signing the deals with Sechin just weeks after the United States blacklisted him, OFAC said in the three-page statement. (For the statement, see: http://bit.ly/2vnvQf2)

The Treasury imposed sanctions on Sechin in April 2014 as part of measures to pressure Russia over its intervention in Ukraine, saying Sechin had shown "utter loyalty" to Russian President Vladimir Putin.

The sanctions prohibit U.S. citizens or people in the United States from dealing with those on the blacklist, such as Sechin. Rosneft itself is subject to narrower U.S. sanctions that still allow Americans to deal with the company on some transactions.

Exxon said in a statement that OFAC's action was "fundamentally unfair," and sued the U.S. government in Texas in an effort to overturn the decision. The company is based in Irving, Texas.

In its 21-page complaint, Exxon argued that Sechin "was subject to sanctions only in his individual capacity" and that guidance from the Obama administration at the time made clear that the sanctions "applied only to the 'personal assets' of the sanctioned individuals and emphasized that the sanctions did not restrict business with the companies those individuals managed."

(For Exxon's complaint, see: http://exxonmobil.co/2uNRWdr)

TILLERSON NOT CONSULTED

Tillerson left Exxon late last year to become secretary of state after 10 years running the company. He is now responsible for U.S. foreign policy, which includes helping make sanctions decisions.

The State Department referred questions about the fine to Exxon and the Treasury. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert told reporters on Thursday that the agency was alerted to the fine on Wednesday.

A Treasury spokesman said OFAC engaged with Exxon's lawyers only, and "did not discuss this case with Secretary Tillerson."

Tillerson said in January that he would recuse himself from matters involving Exxon for one year after his December 2016 resignation, unless he is authorized to participate.

Though the State Department plays a major part in formulating sanctions policy, former U.S. officials and sanctions experts said it was unlikely the agency had a role in deciding the fine announced on Thursday, because it falls under OFAC's regulatory role.

The back-and-forth between the Treasury and Exxon over the 2014 dealings spanned both the Obama and Trump administrations, and started with a subpoena from OFAC to Exxon in July 2014, Exxon said in its complaint.

Exxon fully complied with guidance from Democratic former President Barack Obama's administration that ongoing oil and gas business activities with Rosneft were permitted, Exxon spokesman Alan Jeffers said in a statement.

The Treasury "is trying to retroactively enforce a new interpretation of an executive order" inconsistent with its prior guidance, Jeffers said. "OFAC's action is fundamentally unfair."

Exxon also cited a Treasury Department representative's comments in May 2014 that BP Plc Chief Executive Bob Dudley - an American citizen - could continue to participate in Rosneft board meetings so long as they related only to Rosneft's business.

In its statement explaining the fine, OFAC said that the Treasury Department representative's comments did not address Exxon's conduct. BP did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Publicly available guidance on the Treasury's website at the time of Exxon's dealings with Sechin said Americans should ensure they do not enter into contracts signed by sanctioned individuals, OFAC said.

And by dealing with Sechin, the company "caused significant harm" to U.S. sanctions on Russia, the agency said.

Because Rosneft itself is not off-limits to Americans, another company executive could have signed the contract with no sanctions risk to Exxon, said David Mortlock, who was a State Department and White House sanctions official under Obama.

"You could have Sechin standing over the guy's shoulder," said Mortlock, now an attorney at Willkie Farr & Gallagher LLP in Washington. "But the problem here is that it was signed by Sechin himself."

Exxon said that approach would have flown in the face of standard business practice.

"You don't ask your business partner to have someone else sign instead of the CEO," said Exxon spokesman Jeffers.

OPPOSITION TO SANCTIONS

Exxon has long opposed U.S. sanctions on Russia, saying they harm American business interests and actually help European rivals.

Tillerson said in 2014 that the company did not support sanctions because they are not effective "unless they are very well implemented."

Sanctions were a contentious topic at Tillerson's confirmation hearing last January. At the time, Republican and Democratic lawmakers were concerned that Trump, whose associates are now under investigation for their ties to Russia, would try to quickly lift U.S. sanctions on the country.

"When sanctions are imposed, they by their design are going to harm American business," Tillerson said during the hearing, in response to a question about his views on them.

He also said that Exxon "never directly lobbied against sanctions," a claim that was immediately challenged by senators who cited Exxon's own lobbying disclosure forms.

The case is Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Steve Munchin, et al, U.S. District Court, North District of Texas, No. 3:17-cv-1930.

FOKUS 1-Strafe gegen Exxon wegen Russland-Deals unter Tillerson - Reuters (German)

{{20170720T210812.729+0000}}FOKUS 1-Strafe gegen Exxon wegen Russland-Deals unter Tillerson(neu: Exxon klagt, Stellungnahme Finanzministerium, Kontext)

* US-Regierung verhängt Strafe wegen Sanktionsverstößen

* Geschäfte wurden 2014 unter heutigem Außenminister getätigt

* Exxon wehrt sich juristisch gegen die Entscheidung - "Unfair"

Washington/Houston, 20. Jul (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil ist wegen Russland-Geschäften zu Zeiten von US-Außenminister Rex Tillerson als Chef des Ölmultis ins Visier der heimischen Behörden geraten. Das US-Finanzministerium verhängte eine Strafe von zwei Millionen Dollar wegen Sanktionsverstößen vor gut drei Jahren. Exxon habe damals die Vorschriften "rücksichtlos missachtet", erklärte das Ministerium am Donnerstag in einer ungewöhnlich ausführlichen Stellungnahme. Konkret wird Exxon vorgeworfen, dass führende Manager im Mai 2014 Vereinbarungen über Öl- und Gasprojekte zusammen mit dem Präsidenten des russischen Konkurrenten Rosneft, Igor Setschin, unterzeichneten - wenige Wochen, nachdem die USA wegen des Ukraine-Konflikts Sanktionen gegen Russland verhängt hatten.

Die US-Regierung hatte Setschin damals wegen seiner engen Verbindung zum russischen Präsidenten Wladimir Putin auf eine schwarzen Liste gesetzt. Die Sanktionen verbieten es in den USA Ansässigen, Geschäfte mit Personen auf dieser Liste zu tätigen. Die nun verhängte Strafe resultiert aus einer Untersuchung jener Vereinbarungen, die Exxon-Manager damals mit Setschin getroffen hatten. Exxon geht juristisch gegen die Strafe vor und bezeichnete die Entscheidung als "grundlegend unfair".

Tillerson hatte Exxon zehn Jahre lang geleitet, bevor er unter US-Präsident Donald Trump zum Außenminister ernannt wurde. In dieser Position ist er mit dafür zuständig, Entscheidungen über Sanktionen zu treffen. Er gilt als russlandfreundlich und hat wiederholt die gegen das Land verhängten Strafmaßnahmen kritisiert. Daran war auch ein Plan für ein Exxon-Rosneft-Gemeinschaftsunternehmen gescheitert. Rosneft-Chef Setschin bezeichnete Tillerson einmal als Freund, mit dem er gerne mal die Vereinigten Staaten auf dem Motorrad durchqueren wolle.[nL5N1E74LZ]

EEUU dice que Exxon violó sanciones a Rusia en 2014, cuando Tillerson era su presidente ejecutivo - Reuters (Spanish)

{{20170720T200520.805+0000}}EEUU dice que Exxon violó sanciones a Rusia en 2014, cuando Tillerson era su presidente ejecutivoPor Yeganeh Torbati y Ernest Scheyder

WASHINGTON/HOUSTON, 20 jul (Reuters) - Estados Unidos reprendió el jueves a Exxon Mobil Corp por su "desacato temerario" de las sanciones impuestas a los negocios con Rusia en 2014, cuando el actual secretario de Estado, Rex Tillerson, era el presidente ejecutivo de la firma, y la multó con 2 millones de dólares.

ExxonMobil dijo que la decisión fue "fundamentalmente injusta" y demandó al gobierno en Texas con el objetivo de revertirla.

La multa fue impuesta tras una revisión de los acuerdos firmados por Exxon con el principal productor petrolero ruso, Rosneft , semanas después de que Washington impusiera sanciones a Moscú por la anexión de la región ucraniana de Crimea.

Entre el 14 y el 24 de mayo de 2014, altos ejecutivos de ExxonMobil rubricaron ocho documentos con Igor Sechin, presidente de la estatal Rosneft, aseguró la Oficina de Control de Activos Extranjeros del Departamento del Tesoro (OFAC, por sus siglas en inglés) en un comunicado en su sitio web.

ExxonMobil "demostró un desacato temerario de los requisitos incluidos en las sanciones estadounidenses" al firmar acuerdos con Sechin semanas después de que Washington lo incluyera en una lista negra, indicó la OFAC en un comunicado inusualmente largo de tres páginas con sus razonamientos.

El Tesoro anunció las sanciones en abril de 2014, como parte de las medidas aprobadas para presionar a Rusia por su intervención en Ucrania, asegurando que Sechin mostró una "lealtad absoluta" al presidente ruso, Vladimir Putin.

Tillerson abandonó ExxonMobil para convertirse en secretario de Estado tras 10 años al frente de la petrolera. Ahora es el responsable de la política exterior de Estados Unidos, un cargo que incluye colaborar en las decisiones sobre sanciones.

El monto de la multa es muy pequeño para ExxonMobil, que tuvo ganancias por 7.840 millones de dólares en 2016.

LEAD 1-Exxon à l'amende pour avoir contourné les sanctions contre Moscou - Reuters (French)

{{20170720T192746.646+0000}}LEAD 1-Exxon à l'amende pour avoir contourné les sanctions contre Moscou(Actualisé avec réaction Exxon)

WASHINGTON, 20 juillet (Reuters) - Le département du Trésor américain a condamné jeudi la société ExxonMobil et ses filiales américaines à payer une amende de deux millions de dollars (1,7 million d'euros) pour avoir contourné les sanctions contre la Russie, liées à son soutien aux rebelles ukrainiens, en mai 2014.

Le Bureau du contrôle des avoirs étrangers (OFAC) indique que la société ExxonMobil n'a pas révélé elle-même avoir transgressé les sanctions et estime qu'il s'agit d'une infraction flagrante.

ExxonMobil a dénoncé une décision "fondamentalement injuste" et déposé un recours contre le gouvernement de l'Etat du Texas dans l'espoir d'annuler la sanction.

Entre les 14 et 23 mai 2014, des dirigeants d'Exxon ont signé huit documents en lien avec des projets pétrolier et gazier en Russie avec Igor Setchine, le président de Rosneft OAO, dont les biens et les intérêts étaient bloqués par des sanctions américaines, a indiqué le Trésor américain.

Le porte-parole d'exxon, Alan Jeffers, a déclaré que l'administration Obama n'interdisait pas à l'époque de conclure des contrats avec Rosneft et Igor Setchine a signé les documents au nom de Rosneft, a-t-il souligné.

Le groupe pétrolier était alors dirigé par l'actuel secrétaire d'Etat américain, Rex Tillerson.

Qatar LNG company postpones layoffs amid diplomatic crisis - Reuters News

{{20170719T145543.653+0000}}Qatar LNG company postpones layoffs amid diplomatic crisisBy Tom Finn

DOHA, July 19 (Reuters) - Majority state-owned Qatari gas producer Rasgas has postponed a round of job cuts after the diplomatic crisis which erupted between Qatar and its neighbours in early June, people familiar with the matter have told Reuters.

Staff at Rasgas were told earlier this year that they would be laid off in June, with the job cuts following last year's decision to merge RasGas with Qatargas, the two liquefied natural gas divisions of Qatar Petroleum [QATPE.UL]. [nL5N1E6047]

But in a company email last month staff were informed that the job cuts had been delayed, two Rasgas employees said.

It was not immediately clear whether the delay meant the entire merger had been postponed.

The move comes as Qatar works to cope with sanctions imposed by Saudi Arabia and other Arab states, striking trade deals and cancelling the leave of foreign expatriate workers in "essential government sectors" to help cope with the crisis. [nL8N1JJ4MU]

"The layoffs were postponed. No reason was given," said one of the employees, who declined to be named. A Rasgas spokeswoman was not available to comment.

Qatar Petroleum's chief executive said at the end of last year the merger of RasGas and Qatargas would help to cut operating costs by hundreds of millions of dollars at the world's largest LNG producer, and another group official familiar with the plan said hundreds of people would be laid off. [nL5N1E6047]

An official working at a Gulf energy company said Doha was apparently postponing the layoffs because it needed to focus the attention of leaders and managers on the diplomatic crisis, which has disrupted some imports into the country.

"I still think the job cuts will happen in the long run, as the Rasgas-Qatargas merger will go ahead and many of the jobs are duplicated across both organisations," said the official.

"This seems to be a case of 'we currently have bigger fish to fry than a fast merger'."

Last month Qatar announced plans to expand its LNG production capacity by 30 percent and build infrastructure to bolster its role as a major global supplier amid rising LNG output from Australia and the United States. [nL8N1JV3ML]

"With the political crisis and this output expansion, it is all hands on deck," said a Qatar Petroleum official.

RasGas currently has a production capacity of about 37 million tonnes a year of LNG, according to its website. It is a 70/30 percent joint venture between Qatar Petroleum and Exxon Mobil

UPDATE 1-ExxonMobil says will drop discussions over Indonesia's East Natuna gas field - Reuters News

{{20170718T092823.704+0000}}UPDATE 1-ExxonMobil says will drop discussions over Indonesia's East Natuna gas field* Pertamina says still committed to developing East Natuna block

* Govt may invite Exxon to discuss "incentives" for development

(Adds context, and comments from Pertamina executive and government official)

By Wilda Asmarini

JAKARTA, July 18 (Reuters) - The Indonesian unit of ExxonMobil on Tuesday said it "no longer wishes to continue further discussions or activity" involving the country's East Natuna natural gas block, believed to hold one of the world's largest reserves of untapped gas.

The firm's Vice President of Public and Government Affairs Erwin Maryoto told Reuters in an email the decision was taken after completing a "technology and market review".

Exxon's exit likely means further delays in developing a field that was first discovered in the 1970s. Difficulties with the field have included contract disputes and the remoteness of the block, which is on the southern edge of the South China Sea.

The East Natuna field holds approximately 46 trillion cubic feet of recoverable gas resources, according to Exxon, although it comes with a carbon dioxide content of more than 70 percent - which also increases the cost of extracting useable fuel.

State energy firm Pertamina had expected to sign a production sharing contract with ExxonMobil and Thailand's PTTEP for the project last year.

Syamsu Alam, Pertamina's upstream director, said the company has not been informed directly of Exxon's decision, but that it was committed to developing the East Natuna field, once a partner is found.

"Surely Pertamina wouldn't be able to develop the block alone, we need a partner," Alam told Reuters in a text message.

Indonesia's government has received a letter from the U.S. oil major on its decision to pull out of the gas block, Wiratmaja Puja, director general of oil and gas at the energy ministry, told reporters.

In the letter, Exxon said developing the block would be "uneconomical for the company under current terms", but it offered to help with technology and technical assistance for the project if needed, according to Puja.

Puja estimated that developing the project under current terms would make its gas too expensive, at about $10-15 per million British thermal units (mmBtu). That compares with spot prices for liquefied natural gas (LNG) in Asia that are currently less than $6 per mmBtu .

The government plans to invite Exxon to discuss the project again, saying it might offer "a special incentive" to make it economically viable, Puja said.

Malaysia's Petronas [PETRA.UL] and France's Total were previously involved with the East Natuna project, but they have both pulled out.

In the past, Pertamina's official has said that developing the East Natuna project could cost up to $40 billion.

UPDATE 1-Exxon's Beaumont, Texas refinery HCU running at full production -sources - 路透新闻

{{20170715T001350.768+0000}}UPDATE 1-Exxon's Beaumont, Texas refinery HCU running at full production -sources(Adds company comment, background on hydrocracker)

HOUSTON, July 14 (Reuters) - The hydrocracking unit (HCU) at ExxonMobil Corp's 362,300 barrel-per-day (bpd) Beaumont, Texas, refinery was running at full production 24 hours after restarting, said sources familiar with plant operations.

Exxon spokeswoman Charlotte Huffaker said on Friday operations at the Beaumont refinery were normal, but declined to discuss the status of individual units.

The 65,000-bpd HCU was shut on Monday to repair a leak, the sources said. The hydrocracker had returned to production on July 8 after being shut by a July 6 electrical malfunction at the refinery.

A hydrocracker uses hydrogen under high heat and pressure in the presence of catalyst to convert feedstock, usually gas oil into motor fuel, primarily diesel. Diesel produced by hydrocrackers has become a lucrative export for U.S. Gulf Coast refiners.

Behind the scenes, companies fight Trump on US steel tariffs - Reuters News

{{20170714T182206.808+0000}}Behind the scenes, companies fight Trump on US steel tariffsBy Ginger Gibson

WASHINGTON, July 14 (Reuters) - American manufacturers, energy companies and retailers reliant on cheap steel are quietly lobbying against President Donald Trump's desire to impose tariffs on steel imports ahead of possible decision by the U.S. Commerce Department next week.

Honoring a promise made in the 2016 election campaign, in April this year Trump initiated a "Section 232" review of the steel industry, a provision in the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 allowing for the imposition of tariffs or quotas on imports if they threaten national security. The provision has only been used to review imports twice before.

The Commerce Department could issue findings on the matter as early as next week, a decision that three lobbyists say has been delayed due to debate inside the administration.

Steel producers in the U.S., like U.S. Steel Corp and AK Steel stand to benefit from protectionist tariffs which would enable them to raise their prices.

But U.S. manufacturers and energy companies who use steel want to keep their costs down and say tariffs could costs jobs in their industries, while retailers need cheap steel for many facets of their business including shelving in their stores and warehouses, and to sell to consumers.

Any U.S. tariffs may also result in damage to unrelated industries if other countries retaliate by also imposing tariffs on American exports in sectors such as agriculture.

"Our member companies have quietly had these conversations with both members of the administration but also with the Hill," said Hun Quach, the vice president for international trade at the Retail Industry Leaders Association.

Those in favor of approving new tariffs include not only steel manufacturers, but some aligned unions. They have allies in Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, a former U.S. Steel lawyer who has promised to recuse himself from decisions regarding the industry.

PROS AND CONS

Mario Longhi, who until a few weeks ago was chief executive of U.S. Steel, said earlier this year that curbing cheap steel imports could restore jobs for 10,000 American steel workers.

The U.S. steel industry employed about 147,000 people in 2015, according to the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic analysis.

But manufacturers that need steel employ about 6.5 million people each year, and the construction industry supports another 6.3 million jobs.

Manufacturers argue that pushing up the cost of steel by imposing tariffs on imports ultimately hurts American consumers who will pay more for everyday goods made from steel, such as lawn mowers, washing machines, and microwaves.

When former President George W. Bush imposed steel tariffs in 2002, the move was found illegal by the World Trade Organization which permitted other countries to retaliate against American exports and Bush was forced to back down.

Studies by the free trade lobby group, the Consuming Industries Trade Action Coalition (CITAC), found that 200,000 workers in U.S. manufacturing lost their jobs as a result of the 2002 steel tariffs.

POLITICAL RISK

Pushing back against something that was a signature piece of Trump's campaign carries some political risk though and most companies would only elaborate on their lobbying efforts anonymously, saying they were making their case to Trump and lawmakers behind closed doors.

They see allies in Gary Cohn, the head of the National Economic Council and Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue.

"We've been quite vocal both on the Hill and in the administration," said a lobbyist for a large manufacturing company that uses both U.S. steel and imported steel, but who declined to speak on the record over concerns public statements could damage relationships with the White House.

Several companies have also been pressing members of Congress to advocate against tariffs with the administration on their behalf, said several lobbyists.

Several companies, including National Oilwell Varco Inc. , Ball Corporation , and Electrolux , submitted public comments to the Commerce Department arguing against tariffs.

The American Petroleum Industry, which represents the largest oil refiners and chemical companies including ExxonMobil , Shell Oil Company , Chevron and Dow Chemical Company , issued forceful comments against the proposed tariffs, as did the American Automotive Policy Council, which includes Ford Motor Co. and General Motors .

"The auto industry and the U.S. workers that the industry employs would be adversely affected and that this unintended negative impact would exceed the benefit provided to the steel industry," the American Automotive Policy Council said in a message echoed in other comments.

** SPX follows DJI <.DJI> into record territory after the blue-chip index resolved its holding pattern earlier in the week [nL1N1K30DT]

** With tech, up 3.6 pct WTD, leading way higher again, iShares S&P 500 Growth ETF /iShares S&P 500 Value ETF ratio has closed back over its 50-DMA. Chart: http://reut.rs/2tRxxTl

** Additionally, ratio attempting to resolve what appears to be 1-month bull flag pattern, to upside

** Given tech strong weekly rise, no surprise ratio rising again; sector IVW's heaviest weighting (36 pct of market value), followed by cons disc and health care (both about 16 pct each)

** Meanwhile, financials down 0.7 pct WTD [nL4N1K54HC] [nL1N1K31R7]. This as Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund failed to exceed its Mar high [nL1N1JW0D8]

** Financials IVE's heaviest sector weighting (28 pct), while ETF includes significant energy exposure (11 pct)

** Although, energy up 1.9 pct WTD, with potential building for positive trend change [nL1N1K50HB], weighting not enough to offset tech strength

** That said, tech sector faces stiff resistance only about 1-2 pct above its current level [nL1N1K40AB] [nL1N1K41F3], while SPX major resistance (2500 area), about 2 pct higher [nL1N1JY0KE]

** Nevertheless, as long as ratio holds above its 50-DMA, scope for growth to see fresh 17-year highs vs value in coming weeks

BUZZ- Energy ETF revs up to challenge resistance - Reuters News

** However, Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund's improving momentum picture suggests potential for significant turn in trend. This, as ETF now comes within 1-2 pct of key resistance

** Energy down 13.2 pct YTD, just slightly less severe decline than SPX's biggest loser, telecom's 15.6 pct loss

** That said, energy carries much greater weight within SPX given its $1.24 trln market cap vs telecom's $433 bln value

** XLE has been trending down in a well-defined bear channel since its late 2016 high. Chart: http://reut.rs/2tQX0MJ

** Indeed, earlier in Jul, ETF hit $63.29, a 16-month low

** However, daily MACD, which had been coiling, held above its early 2017 trough, suggesting building positive momentum

** XLE now looks to make another attempt to challenge key barriers at 8-month resistance line, now $65.80 area, just ahead of descending 50-DMA (now $65.98)

** ETF has consistently failed at this resistance, maintaining pattern of declining peaks and troughs

** Thus, close above resistance barriers can suggest trend turning; action then confirmed by thrust above $66.48 early-Jul high, MACD reclaiming study zero-line

** 200-DMA, now $70.32, can then be a magnet, an additional 6-pct rally above early-Jul high [nL1N1K30DT] [nL1N1JQ15Z]

** Failing to overwhelm resistance will once again maintain bear trend; XLE likely to remain a laggard, threaten $60.82 Fibo retracement and below

UPDATE 1-Exxon's Beaumont, Texas refinery restarting hydrocracker -sources - 路透新闻

{{20170713T214121.232+0000}}UPDATE 1-Exxon's Beaumont, Texas refinery restarting hydrocracker -sources(Adds details on hydrocracker's outage)

HOUSTON, July 13 (Reuters) - ExxonMobil Corp began restarting the hydrocracking unit (HCU) at its 362,300-barrel-per-day (bpd) Beaumont, Texas, refinery on Thursday afternoon, according to sources familiar with plant operations.

Exxon spokeswoman Charlotte Huffaker declined to comment, but said the company was meeting its contractual commitments.

The 65,000 bpd HCU was shut on Monday to repair a leak. The hydrocracker had only returned to production on Saturday after being shut by a July 6 electrical malfunction at the refinery.

Suriname signs offshore oil deals with ﻿Exxon, Hess and Statoil - Reuters News

{{20170713T205515.890+0000}}Suriname signs offshore oil deals with ﻿Exxon, Hess and StatoilPARAMARIBO, July 13 (Reuters) - Suriname's state oil company Staatsolie said on Thursday it signed production sharing contracts involving Exxon Mobil Corp , Hess Corp and Statoil ASA for two blocks off the coast of the South American nation.

The thirty-year exploration and production agreements involve the areas known as Block 59, to be developed by a consortium consisting of Exxon and Hess, and Block 60, to be developed by Statoil.

The area off the shoulder of South America has generated interest from oil companies after Hess and Exxon discovered crude off the coast of nearby Guyana.

Hess and Statoil already own stakes in Suriname oil projects.

Staatsolie will be able to take up to a 10 percent stake during the development and production phases.

Staatsolie has said that 2016 was one of the most difficult years in its 36-year history due to low oil prices, though the company managed to reach a gross profit of $13 million.

By Erwin Seba

HOUSTON, July 13 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp has been fined about $165,000 by U.S. regulators for safety lapses including inadequate training and equipment maintenance over an explosion that injured four workers at an aging Baton Rouge, Louisiana, refinery last year.

The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) issued nine citations, several of which echo previous cautions by federal agencies at two other Exxon plants. The citations, issued in May, were seen by Reuters this month.

A separate investigation by the U.S. Chemical Safety Board (CSB) is ongoing and its report on the incident is due by year-end.

Exxon said it is contesting the OSHA citations and fines.

The facility was faulted five years ago by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for failing to address corrosion on pipes and valves and for inadequate shutdown and emergency procedures provided to workers.

The Nov. 22, 2016 explosion on a sulfuric-acid alkylation unit that makes octane-boosting components of gasoline in the sprawling Baton Rouge refinery and chemical plant injured four workers, two of them severely. Two of the affected workers declined to comment; others could not be reached.

A worker on the alkylation unit removed the cover of a malfunctioning valve on an isobutane line and used a wrench to turn the value stem, Exxon reported to the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality in a letter. Volatile isobutane is converted in the alkylation unit to a component of gasoline.

As the operator turned the valve stem, portions of the valve fell out, releasing isobutane, according to the Exxon letter, which was ignited by a welding machine 70 feet away.

One worker was knocked off a scaffold next to the alkylation unit and left dangling over the fire, according to two sources. Another worker was burned over most of her body.

Exxon's safety procedures and training for operators on the alkylation unit were lacking, equipment was not properly maintained, and required inspections were not carried out within required time periods, according to a copy of the citations seen by Reuters.

"We cooperated with OSHA's investigation and shared extensive information and records," said Exxon spokeswoman Charlotte Huffaker. "We are contesting the citations and associated penalty."

Huffaker said "nothing is more important" to Exxon than maintaining a safe workplace for workers and residents near its facilities.

Eight of the nine citations were listed as serious, each carrying a fine of $12,675. The ninth, for failing to carry out external visual and ultrasonic inspections of piping, totaled $63,373.

The latter fine was higher because Exxon was cited in 2016 for violating the same inspection standard at a Baytown, Texas, refining and chemical plant complex, OSHA said in the citation.

In a report issued in May after a two-year investigation of a 2015 explosion at an 86-year-old Torrance, California, refinery then owned by Exxon, the CSB said the company lacked a procedure for operating a fluidic catalytic cracking unit in an idled mode, as was being done when the explosion took place.

Exxon sold the Torrance refinery to PBF Energy Inc in July 2016.

In 2012, the EPA inspected the Baton Rouge refinery as part of a risk management prevention program. It found Exxon had not examined in five years more than 1,000 underground pipes, many of which were corroded, according to the agency's report on the inspection. The EPA also said emergency and shutdown procedures failed to provide needed details for operators.

Huffaker said in an email that Exxon contested the violations, and said the EPA withdrew all but two of its findings. She did not specify the two violations but said Exxon resolved those issues.

UPDATE 1-Dutch court hearing pits Big Oil against Groningen locals - Reuters News

{{20170713T155010.733+0000}}UPDATE 1-Dutch court hearing pits Big Oil against Groningen locals(Adds company, government comments)

By Bart H. Meijer

THE HAGUE, July 13 (Reuters) - Angry Dutch residents living near the huge Groningen gas field demanded a total halt to production, accusing oil companies of causing house-damaging earth tremors and the government of lying at a hearing in the Netherlands' highest court on Thursday.

Two days of proceedings at the Council of State is considering appeals against a government plan to curb production at the massive field by an additional 10 percent from Oct. 1.

Residents want extraction at the field, which once supplied 10 percent of the European Union's gas needs, to be stopped altogether due to minor earthquakes that have damaged thousands of homes and buildings.

Gas production company NAM, a joint venture between oil majors Royal Dutch Shell and Exxon Mobil , has accepted responsibility for damage caused by the quakes, for which it is paying more than 1 billion euros ($1.14 billion).

However, opponents accused NAM and the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs, which sets production levels, of underestimating the dangers.

"We have consistently been lied to," lawyer Nette Kruzenga, representing a group of Groningen residents, told the court. "The NAM is only interested in maximizing production, and the government is ignoring its task to protect people."

The Dutch government has lowered production at Groningen several times over the past three years due to small earthquakes triggered by gas extraction. The latest cap, announced in May, would lower output to 21.6 billion cubic metres (bcm) per year, down from 53.9 bcm in 2013.

NAM said it was appealing against the cut because the decision ignored earlier agreed safety norms. The 50-50 Exxon-Shell joint venture has said it had been put in an impossible position having been told it could continue production, vital to supply millions of Dutch homes with gas for heating and cooking, but without guarantees it is meeting safety standards.

"We are on the same side as others in this case," NAM Director Gerald Schotman said in court. "This may seem contradictory, but we have a common interest: clarity about safety."

The Ministry of Economic Affairs said production in Groningen was necessary for the gas supply in the Netherlands and parts of Germany, Belgium and France and that the earlier cuts had already diminished risks.

But a relatively large number of light tremors last winter prompted more cuts.

"This decision was carefully prepared and well motivated," government lawyer Hans Besselink said. "It does justice to all parties involved."

It could take several months for a decision to be announced. ($1 = 0.8778 euros)

Dutch court hearing pits Big Oil against Groningen locals - Reuters News

{{20170713T115627.379+0000}}Dutch court hearing pits Big Oil against Groningen localsBy Bart H. Meijer

THE HAGUE, July 13 (Reuters) - Angry Dutch residents living near the huge Groningen gas field demanded a total halt to production, accusing oil giants of causing house-damaging earth tremors and the government of lying at a hearing in the Netherlands' highest court on Thursday.

Two days of proceedings at the Council of State is considering appeals against a government plan to curb production at the massive field by an additional 10 percent from Oct. 1.

Residents want extraction at the field, which once supplied 10 percent of the European Union's gas needs, to be stopped altogether due to minor earthquakes that have damaged thousands of homes and buildings.

NAM has accepted civil responsibility for damage caused by the quakes and is paying damages of more than 1 billion euros.

Gas production company NAM, a joint venture between oil majors Royal Dutch Shell and Exxon Mobile , said it has appealed against the proposed cut because the decision ignored earlier agreed safety norms.

Opponents accused NAM and the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs, which sets production levels, of underestimating the dangers of the gas extraction.

"We have consistently been lied to," lawyer Nette Kruzenga, representing a group of Groningen residents, told the court. "The NAM is only interested in maximizing production, and the government is ignoring its task to protect people."

The Dutch government has lowered production at Groningen several times over the past three years due to small earthquakes triggered by gas extraction.

The latest cap, announced in May, would lower output to 21.6 billion cubic metres (bcm) per year, down from 53.9 bcm in 2013.

The 50-50 Exxon-Shell joint venture has said it had been put in an impossible position having been told it could continue production, vital to supply millions of Dutch homes with gas for heating and cooking, but without guarantees it is meeting safety standards.

Russia's Rosneft plans to open Mozambique office - diplomat - Reuters News

{{20170713T102006.463+0000}}Russia's Rosneft plans to open Mozambique office - diplomatMOSCOW, July 13 (Reuters) - Rosneft is preparing to open an office in Mozambique, a senior Mozambican diplomat said, a further sign that the Russian oil major is eyeing oil and gas deals in Africa.

Mozambique's Ambassador to Russia Mario Saraiva Ngwenya also told Reuters that Mozambique expected to sign by the end of the year an agreement on the development terms of blocks that Rosneft and ExxonMobil were awarded in 2015.

"In the next few weeks there is a delegation from Rosneft visiting Maputo. Rosneft is preparing, planning to open an office in Mozambique," he said.

In 2015 Mozambique awarded Rosneft and Exxon three contract areas: A5-B in the Angoche Basin as well as Z5-C and Z5-D in the Zambezi Delta.

"The government of Mozambique is in a negotiating process with Rosneft. We expect to sign a public agreement on terms of development of those blocks before the end of 2017," the ambassador said.

Mozambique, which has been in the throes of a debt crisis, has large untapped natural gas reserves and has historically had close ties with Russia.

Rosneft, the world's largest listed oil producer by output, is trying to increase its gas output and has global ambitions as the Kremlin's energy champion.

In 2015, Rosneft said that liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports would be a primary development case if gas discoveries were sufficient in Mozambique.

Rosneft Chief Executive Igor Sechin worked as a Soviet translator in Africa, according to former classmates and fellow Soviet translators.

Rosneft declined comment when contacted by Reuters.

Oil majors face downgrades if crude prices don't pick up - S&P - Reuters News

{{20170712T140620.241+0000}}Oil majors face downgrades if crude prices don't pick up - S&PLONDON, July 12 (Reuters) - Big oil firms would face increased credit rating downgrade pressures if crude prices stayed below $50 a barrel on average until the end of 2018 and they did not compensate by cutting costs, S&P Global said on Wednesday.

S&P currently has downgrade warnings - or negative outlooks in rating agency parlance - on ExxonMobil , Chevron Corp and Total , while the other so-called 'majors' include Royal Dutch Shell and BP .

"If oil prices persistently trend below our price assumptions ($50/bbl on average until the end of 2018), downgrade pressure for many ratings would increase without material and sufficient further cost and capex efficiencies, disposals, or other countermeasures against weak credit metrics for a sustained period," S&P said in a report.

It added that moderately higher oil prices would help credit metrics, but that for most of the big firms -with the exception of Shell- it "remains to be seen" whether they could see upgrades without a strong and sustained rebound in crude prices.

Brent oil was trading at $48.34 a barrel on Wednesday. [O/R]

Oil majors' debt levels have ballooned with aggregate debt reaching nearly $300 billion in 2014, up from just under $200 billion in 2009 according to S&P's estimates.

UPDATE 2-Indonesia unlikely to need imported LNG until 2020 as output to rise - 路透新闻

{{20170712T105712.172+0000}}UPDATE 2-Indonesia unlikely to need imported LNG until 2020 as output to rise* Imports unlikely as ENI gas field output higher than expected

* Says country still has 16-18 uncommitted LNG cargoes for 2017

(Adds comments, details on Eni project)

By Wilda Asmarini and Bernadette Christina Munthe

JAKARTA, July 12 (Reuters) - Indonesia is unlikely to need to import liquefied natural gas (LNG) until at least 2020 due to robust gas production at home, a senior government official said on Wednesday, even as the government has pushed increased domestic gas consumption.

"Our production has turned out to be better than predicted," the country's Director General of Oil and Gas, Wiratmaja Puja, told reporters on Wednesday. "So there's a high possibility we won't need to import in 2019."

Puja was referring to higher-than-expected output from the Jangkrik gas field operated by Eni . The field was designed to produce 450 million cubic feet per day of gas but output could be up to 600 million cubic feet per day, he said.

Currently the world's fifth-biggest exporter of LNG, Indonesia has lost market share to new production from Australia and Qatar and as output is reserved for domestic needs. However, the domestic gas market has not developed as anticipated even after the government promoted the fuel to replace coal for power plants and as an industrial fuel. [nL3N18F3L8][nL4N19D1YD]

Power plant developers in Indonesia are still relying on cheaper coal, however, which has curtailed the development of gas infrastructure. [http://reut.rs/2tM1Ade]

Puja also called into question imports after 2020 when he mentioned BP's Tangguh Train 3 project will supply more gas to Indonesia from 2020 onwards.

"At the end of 2020 we won't need to import," he added.

The comments come even as Australia's Woodside Petroleum inked a contract in April to supply Indonesia's state-owned energy company Pertamina with LNG from 2019 to 2034. Pertamina also has a LNG import deal with U.S.-based Cheniere Energy Inc from 2018 and Exxon Mobil Corp from 2025. [nWNBS02BKK][nFWN1J20OM]

Puja suggested those supplies could be redirected to other LNG buyers in Asia, particularly Bangladesh. "We are pushing Pertamina to go global," he said.

When contacted by Reuters, Pertamina's Vice President for LNG, Didik Sasongko, supported that idea.

"We can use it for trading or to optimise Pertamina's LNG portfolio," Sasongko said, referring to the Cheniere deal. "There's flexibility on delivery," he said when asked about the Woodside imports.

Meanwhile, Puja said that Indonesia is looking for buyers for 16 to 18 uncommitted LNG cargoes for this year.

He expects an average of 50 to 60 uncommitted cargoes per year until 2035.

ACTUALIZA 2-Corte de apelaciones de EEUU anula decisión contra Venezuela por arbitraje Exxon Mobil - 路透新闻

{{20170711T184330.541+0000}}ACTUALIZA 2-Corte de apelaciones de EEUU anula decisión contra Venezuela por arbitraje Exxon Mobil(Actualiza con detalles)

Por Jonathan Stempel

NUEVA YORK, 11 jul (Reuters) - Una corte de apelaciones de Estados Unidos dijo el martes que la petrolera Exxon Mobil Corp no puede hacer cumplir un arbitraje internacional que le otorgó 1.600 millones de dólares por la nacionalización de activos en Venezuela en 2007, anulando una decisión de un tribunal menor.

En una votación de tres magistrados a favor y ninguno en contra, la Corte de Apelaciones del Segundo Circuito de Manhattan dijo que el juez se equivocó al excusar a Exxon de cumplir con requisitos de procedimiento para hacer cumplir la decisión de octubre de 2014, tomada por el Centro Internacional de Arreglo de Diferencias Relativas a Inversiones (CIADI).

La corte de apelaciones ordenó que la petición de Exxon para ejecutar el laudo sea rechazada sin perjuicio, permitiendo a la compañía buscar el cumplimiento de acuerdo con la Ley Federal de Inmunidad Soberana Extranjera.

"La aplicación de la (Ley Federal de Inmunidad Soberana Extranjera) FSIA (por su sigla en inglés) facilitará la uniformidad nacional en el procedimiento", escribió la juez del circuito, Susan Carney.

"Nos parece importante alinearnos con los valores de la previsibilidad y el control federal que los asuntos exteriores exigen, y la FSIA fue diseñada para ello", agregó.

El portavoz de Exxon, Todd Spitler, dijo que la compañía petrolera Irving, con sede en Texas, no estaba de acuerdo con la decisión de 3-0 y que están considerando otras opciones legales.

El Ministerio de Comunicación e Información del país petrolero sudamericano y la estatal Petróleos de Venezuela (PDVSA), así como sus representantes legales en Estados Unidos, no respondieron de inmediato a una solicitud de comentarios.

El caso comenzó cuando Venezuela tomó los activos de Exxon en los campos Cerro Negro, de la Faja Petrolífera del Orinoco, y el campo petrolero La Ceiba, dentro de un programa de nacionalización de la industria petrolera.

Según documentos legales, el 9 de marzo un comité de anulación del CIADI rechazó casi toda la sentencia que se refería al proyecto Cerro Negro, reduciendo el pago que debería hacer Venezuela a 188,3 millones de dólares desde los 1.600 millones de dólares iniciales.

La decisión del martes anula el laudo emitido en el 2015 por el juez estadounidense Paul Engelmayer en Manhattan.

La corte de apelaciones también dijo que la petición de Exxon debe ser rechazada sin perjuicio, lo que permite a la empresa buscar la ejecución en cumplimiento con el FSIA.

* Venezuela had seized Exxon assets in 2007

By Jonathan Stempel

NEW YORK, July 11 (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court said on Tuesday that Exxon Mobil Corp cannot enforce a large international arbitration award against Venezuela stemming from an asset seizure in 2007, when the country was nationalizing its oil industry.

The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan said a lower court judge erred in entering a judgment to enforce the $1.6 billion award, since reduced to about $188 million, announced in October 2014 by the World Bank's International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID).

It agreed with Venezuela's argument, which the U.S. government supported, that Exxon should have tried to enforce the award under the federal Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA), which offers more protections for sovereign defendants, rather than be permitted to use streamlined procedures.

"Applying the FSIA will facilitate national uniformity in procedure," Circuit Judge Susan Carney wrote. "Consistency as to enforcement seems to us importantly aligned with the values of predictability and federal control that foreign affairs demands and that the FSIA was designed to promote."

Exxon spokesman Todd Spitler said the Irving, Texas-based oil company disagreed with the 3-0 decision and is considering its legal options.

Venezuela and its U.S.-based lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The case arose from Venezuela's seizure of Exxon assets in the Cerro Negro and La Ceiba oil development ventures, when the country was nationalizing its oil industry.

Exxon had made its investments on a joint-venture basis with the state-owned Petroleos de Venezuela SA.

According to court papers, an ICSID annulment committee on March 9 threw out nearly all of the arbitration award that concerned the Cerro Negro project, reducing Venezuela's payout to $188.3 million from $1.6 billion.

Tuesday's decision voids a 2015 judgment by U.S. District Judge Paul Engelmayer in Manhattan.

The appeals court also said Exxon's petition should be dismissed without prejudice, allowing the company to seek enforcement in compliance with the FSIA.

The case is Mobil Cerro Negro Ltd et al v Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 15-707.

Corte de apelaciones EEUU anula fallo contra Venezuela que otorgaba 1.600 mln dlr a Exxon Mobil - 路透新闻

{{20170711T145258.619+0000}}Corte de apelaciones EEUU anula fallo contra Venezuela que otorgaba 1.600 mln dlr a Exxon MobilNUEVA YORK, 11 jul (Reuters) - Una corte de apelaciones de Estados Unidos aceptó un pedido de Venezuela para anular un fallo a favor de Exxon Mobil por 1.600 millones de dólares, en un caso que se remonta a la nacionalización de activos de la petrolera en 2007 durante el Gobierno de Hugo Chávez.

La corte consideró que el juez que dictó la sentencia original se equivocó al eximir a la petrolera estadounidense de cumplir algunos requisitos para hacer cumplir el fallo.

FBI director nominee Wray earned $9.2 million in law practice last year - 路透新闻

{{20170710T232919.841+0000}}FBI director nominee Wray earned $9.2 million in law practice last yearWASHINGTON, July 10 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump's nominee to head the FBI earned $9.2 million last year as a partner in an international law firm, where he worked for clients ranging from Credit Suisse Group and Wells Fargo to New Jersey Governor Chris Christie.

Disclosure forms produced for the Office of Government Ethics show Christopher Wray is also expected to receive millions more in payments when he leaves the King & Spalding law firm on his confirmation as director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

The forms and a letter from Assistant Attorney General Lee Lofthus, a designated ethics official for the Justice Department, were made public ahead of Wray's confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday. Wray would succeed James Comey, whom Trump fired in May.

Lofthus said in his letter that Wray would not receive a bonus, severance or contingency fees on leaving his firm but would receive a refund of his money in the firm's capital account and a final partnership share distribution, unless he decided to forfeit it.

To satisfy ethics concerns, Wray will not participate for one year in FBI matters that involve companies or people represented by his former law firm, Lofthus said in his letter. He also will not participate in matters involving his former clients for a year, unless he obtains a prior authorization.

Wray's financial disclosure forms show he provided legal services to a number of large international corporations, including Johnson & Johnson , Huntington Ingalls Industries , Georgia-Pacific and SunTrust Banks

He also provided legal services to Christie during the "Bridgegate" scandal in which two of the Republican governor's former associates were convicted of plotting to close down access lanes at the George Washington Bridge for nearly a week in 2013 in an act of political retribution.

If he is confirmed, Wray will have 90 days to dispose of millions of dollars worth of stock he owns in firms ranging from Apple Inc and American Airlines to Wal-Mart and Exxon Mobil , Lofthus said.

Wray served at the U.S. Justice Department from 2003 to 2005 under Republican President George W. Bush as an assistant attorney general in charge of its criminal division and oversaw the department's Enron task force.

{{20170710T133819.275+0000}}UPDATE 1-Exxon Beaumont refinery shuts hydrocracker due to leak -sources(Adds company declining to comment, background on unit)

HOUSTON, July 10 (Reuters) - ExxonMobil Corp's 362,300-barrel-per-day (bpd) Beaumont, Texas, refinery shut the hydrocracker on Sunday due to a leak found after the unit restarted on Saturday, sources familiar with plant operations said on Monday.

Exxon declined to discuss operations at the Beaumont refinery, but said the company continues to meet its contractual commitments, according to an emailed statement from a spokeswoman.

The 65,000 bpd hydrocracking unit restarted on Saturday after being shut by an electrical malfunction at the refinery on Thursday, the sources said. The length of time needed to repair the leak was unknown on Monday.

The hydrocracker uses hydrogen under high heat and pressure in the presence of a catalyst to produce motor fuel, primarily diesel, which has become a lucrative export for U.S. Gulf Coast refiners.

EXCLUSIVE-Pakistan sees bigger LNG profile; imports to surge by 2022 - 路透新闻

{{20170710T132321.946+0000}}EXCLUSIVE-Pakistan sees bigger LNG profile; imports to surge by 2022* LNG imports could top 30 mln tonnes by 2022 - Abbasi

* Pakistan could be among top-5 importers globally

* Consortium to decide in Sept on $700 mln LNG terminal

* Pakistan in talks on govt-to-govt LNG supply deals

By Drazen Jorgic

ISLAMABAD, July 10 (Reuters) - Pakistan says it could become one of the world's top-five buyers of liquefied natural gas (LNG), with Petroleum Minister Shahid Abbasi predicting imports could jump more than fivefold as private companies build new LNG terminals.

Outlining Pakistan's ambitious plans - which, if fully implemented, could shake up the global LNG market - Abbasi told Reuters that imports could top 30 million tonnes by 2022, up from just 4.5 million tonnes currently.

Cheaper than fuel oil and cleaner burning than coal, LNG suits emerging economies seeking to bridge electricity shortfalls and support growth on tight budgets.

"Within five years, I don't see any reason why we should not be beyond 30 million tonnes (in annual LNG imports). We will be one of the top five markets in the world," Abbasi said.

That kind of jump would represent one of the fastest growth stories in the energy industry, comparable to what China has done in many commodities - but there are doubts whether Pakistan can achieve its ambitions, given the complexity and cost of expansion projects.

"It's always possible, but seems very difficult as they will need much more (regasification) capacity and downstream pipeline capacity," said Trevor Sikorski at Energy Aspects, a London-based industry market researcher. "There are infrastructural issues and financial issues."

"Still, it is one of the key LNG growth markets, and its demand will help tighten up the market that has threatened to lurch into over supply."

Abbasi said no one took Pakistan seriously after a decade of botched attempts to bring LNG to the country, but this has changed with the construction of new LNG terminals and gas plants. He said foreign suppliers are now arriving in Pakistan - where energy shortages have prompted Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to promise he'll end the country's frequent blackouts.

"Before, we used to go out to talk to LNG suppliers. Now they're coming to us," Abbasi said.

"(LNG) is really what has saved the whole energy system. It has been a huge success in Pakistan and it will continue," he said after Sharif on Friday inaugurated a new Chinese-built LNG power plant that uses General Electric turbines.

GETTING CONNECTED

Pakistan built its first LNG terminal in 2015 and, after some delays, a second terminal is due to come online in October, doubling annual import capacity to about 9 million tonnes.

A consortium of Exxon Mobil , Total , Mitsubishi <8058.T>, Qatar Petroleum and Norway's Hoegh is expected to decide by September whether to build a third LNG terminal for about $700 million, Abbasi said.

Pakistan has dropped plans to finance up to two more terminals, as private companies have said they would finance these themselves and use Pakistan's existing gas network to sell directly to consumers.

"That's been the real success and that's where the growth will come from," Abbasi said, adding that about 10 million homes are linked to gas connections in Pakistan - a nation of around 200 million.

"In the last four years, we would have added two million additional connections. We are really ramping that up."

If Pakistan achieves its ambitious development goals, it could significantly erode market oversupply, which has helped pull down Asian LNG spot prices by more than 70 percent since 2014 to around $5 per million British thermal units (mmBtu).

Abbasi said Pakistan is in talks with Russia, Indonesia, Malaysia and Oman about government-to-government deals for up to three monthly LNG cargoes for its second terminal, which can import 600 million cubic feet of gas per day, equal to six cargoes a month.

"We have a basic idea of what the market is. So if we are able to better those prices through negotiated procurement, we will go with that, otherwise we might float some more tenders," Abbasi said.

Tenders for two of the terminal's six cargoes have already been won by trading house Gunvor and Italy's Eni , which have signed 5-year and 15-year deals, respectively. The contracts are worth about $5 billion over their lifetime. [nL8N1I43LO]

Qatar supplies most of the gas for Pakistan's first LNG terminal.

Abbasi said Pakistan is considering inviting private investors to build small-scale gas power plants to add another 3,000-4,000 megawatts to the network, on top of the three new LNG plants that will contribute 3,600 MW.

U.S. appeals court voids Exxon enforcement of Venezuela award - 路透新闻

{{20170711T144802.912+0000}}U.S. appeals court voids Exxon enforcement of Venezuela awardNEW YORK, July 11 (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court said on Tuesday that Exxon Mobil Corp cannot enforce a $1.6 billion international arbitration award against Venezuela stemming from a 2007 asset seizure, voiding a lower court judgment.

In a 3-0 vote, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan said a lower court judge erred in excusing Exxon from complying with procedural requirements to enforce the October 2014 award, which was made by the World Bank's International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes.

The appeals court directed that Exxon's petition to enforce the award be dismissed without prejudice, allowing the company to seek enforcement in compliance with the federal Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act.

FBI director nominee Wray earned $9.2 million in law practice last year - 路透新闻

{{20170710T232919.841+0000}}FBI director nominee Wray earned $9.2 million in law practice last yearWASHINGTON, July 10 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump's nominee to head the FBI earned $9.2 million last year as a partner in an international law firm, where he worked for clients ranging from Credit Suisse Group and Wells Fargo to New Jersey Governor Chris Christie.

Disclosure forms produced for the Office of Government Ethics show Christopher Wray is also expected to receive millions more in payments when he leaves the King & Spalding law firm on his confirmation as director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

The forms and a letter from Assistant Attorney General Lee Lofthus, a designated ethics official for the Justice Department, were made public ahead of Wray's confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday. Wray would succeed James Comey, whom Trump fired in May.

Lofthus said in his letter that Wray would not receive a bonus, severance or contingency fees on leaving his firm but would receive a refund of his money in the firm's capital account and a final partnership share distribution, unless he decided to forfeit it.

To satisfy ethics concerns, Wray will not participate for one year in FBI matters that involve companies or people represented by his former law firm, Lofthus said in his letter. He also will not participate in matters involving his former clients for a year, unless he obtains a prior authorization.

Wray's financial disclosure forms show he provided legal services to a number of large international corporations, including Johnson & Johnson , Huntington Ingalls Industries , Georgia-Pacific and SunTrust Banks

He also provided legal services to Christie during the "Bridgegate" scandal in which two of the Republican governor's former associates were convicted of plotting to close down access lanes at the George Washington Bridge for nearly a week in 2013 in an act of political retribution.

If he is confirmed, Wray will have 90 days to dispose of millions of dollars worth of stock he owns in firms ranging from Apple Inc and American Airlines to Wal-Mart and Exxon Mobil , Lofthus said.

Wray served at the U.S. Justice Department from 2003 to 2005 under Republican President George W. Bush as an assistant attorney general in charge of its criminal division and oversaw the department's Enron task force.

{{20170710T133819.275+0000}}UPDATE 1-Exxon Beaumont refinery shuts hydrocracker due to leak -sources(Adds company declining to comment, background on unit)

HOUSTON, July 10 (Reuters) - ExxonMobil Corp's 362,300-barrel-per-day (bpd) Beaumont, Texas, refinery shut the hydrocracker on Sunday due to a leak found after the unit restarted on Saturday, sources familiar with plant operations said on Monday.

Exxon declined to discuss operations at the Beaumont refinery, but said the company continues to meet its contractual commitments, according to an emailed statement from a spokeswoman.

The 65,000 bpd hydrocracking unit restarted on Saturday after being shut by an electrical malfunction at the refinery on Thursday, the sources said. The length of time needed to repair the leak was unknown on Monday.

The hydrocracker uses hydrogen under high heat and pressure in the presence of a catalyst to produce motor fuel, primarily diesel, which has become a lucrative export for U.S. Gulf Coast refiners.

EXCLUSIVE-Pakistan sees bigger LNG profile; imports to surge by 2022 - 路透新闻

{{20170710T132321.946+0000}}EXCLUSIVE-Pakistan sees bigger LNG profile; imports to surge by 2022* LNG imports could top 30 mln tonnes by 2022 - Abbasi

* Pakistan could be among top-5 importers globally

* Consortium to decide in Sept on $700 mln LNG terminal

* Pakistan in talks on govt-to-govt LNG supply deals

By Drazen Jorgic

ISLAMABAD, July 10 (Reuters) - Pakistan says it could become one of the world's top-five buyers of liquefied natural gas (LNG), with Petroleum Minister Shahid Abbasi predicting imports could jump more than fivefold as private companies build new LNG terminals.

Outlining Pakistan's ambitious plans - which, if fully implemented, could shake up the global LNG market - Abbasi told Reuters that imports could top 30 million tonnes by 2022, up from just 4.5 million tonnes currently.

Cheaper than fuel oil and cleaner burning than coal, LNG suits emerging economies seeking to bridge electricity shortfalls and support growth on tight budgets.

"Within five years, I don't see any reason why we should not be beyond 30 million tonnes (in annual LNG imports). We will be one of the top five markets in the world," Abbasi said.

That kind of jump would represent one of the fastest growth stories in the energy industry, comparable to what China has done in many commodities - but there are doubts whether Pakistan can achieve its ambitions, given the complexity and cost of expansion projects.

"It's always possible, but seems very difficult as they will need much more (regasification) capacity and downstream pipeline capacity," said Trevor Sikorski at Energy Aspects, a London-based industry market researcher. "There are infrastructural issues and financial issues."

"Still, it is one of the key LNG growth markets, and its demand will help tighten up the market that has threatened to lurch into over supply."

Abbasi said no one took Pakistan seriously after a decade of botched attempts to bring LNG to the country, but this has changed with the construction of new LNG terminals and gas plants. He said foreign suppliers are now arriving in Pakistan - where energy shortages have prompted Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to promise he'll end the country's frequent blackouts.

"Before, we used to go out to talk to LNG suppliers. Now they're coming to us," Abbasi said.

"(LNG) is really what has saved the whole energy system. It has been a huge success in Pakistan and it will continue," he said after Sharif on Friday inaugurated a new Chinese-built LNG power plant that uses General Electric turbines.

GETTING CONNECTED

Pakistan built its first LNG terminal in 2015 and, after some delays, a second terminal is due to come online in October, doubling annual import capacity to about 9 million tonnes.

A consortium of Exxon Mobil , Total , Mitsubishi <8058.T>, Qatar Petroleum and Norway's Hoegh is expected to decide by September whether to build a third LNG terminal for about $700 million, Abbasi said.

Pakistan has dropped plans to finance up to two more terminals, as private companies have said they would finance these themselves and use Pakistan's existing gas network to sell directly to consumers.

"That's been the real success and that's where the growth will come from," Abbasi said, adding that about 10 million homes are linked to gas connections in Pakistan - a nation of around 200 million.

"In the last four years, we would have added two million additional connections. We are really ramping that up."

If Pakistan achieves its ambitious development goals, it could significantly erode market oversupply, which has helped pull down Asian LNG spot prices by more than 70 percent since 2014 to around $5 per million British thermal units (mmBtu).

Abbasi said Pakistan is in talks with Russia, Indonesia, Malaysia and Oman about government-to-government deals for up to three monthly LNG cargoes for its second terminal, which can import 600 million cubic feet of gas per day, equal to six cargoes a month.

"We have a basic idea of what the market is. So if we are able to better those prices through negotiated procurement, we will go with that, otherwise we might float some more tenders," Abbasi said.

Tenders for two of the terminal's six cargoes have already been won by trading house Gunvor and Italy's Eni , which have signed 5-year and 15-year deals, respectively. The contracts are worth about $5 billion over their lifetime. [nL8N1I43LO]

Qatar supplies most of the gas for Pakistan's first LNG terminal.

Abbasi said Pakistan is considering inviting private investors to build small-scale gas power plants to add another 3,000-4,000 megawatts to the network, on top of the three new LNG plants that will contribute 3,600 MW.

Greece expects minimum $456 mln offers in gas grid sale - newspaper - 路透新闻

{{20170710T112813.771+0000}}Greece expects minimum $456 mln offers in gas grid sale - newspaperATHENS, July 10 (Reuters) - Greece expects potential investors will offer at least 400 million euros ($456 million) for a majority stake in its gas grid operator DESFA, Energy Minister George Stathakis said in an interview with Naftemporiki newspaper.

Greece, under pressure by EU lenders to conclude the sale as it has earmarked about 180 million euros of the proceeds in this year's budget, relaunched the tender in June after a 400 million euro deal with Azerbaijan state oil company SOCAR fell through over gas tariffs among other issues. [nA8N1G500J]

"We anticipate that the price will be the same or even bigger (compared with the previous tender)," Stathakis said in the interview published on Monday.

It has set a July 24 deadline for potential investors to submit initial expressions of interest.

Greece's privatisation agency HRADF owns 65 percent of DESFA and the country's biggest oil refiner Hellenic Petroleum the rest.

The country wants to promote itself as a European hub for the transit of gas from Asia and the eastern Mediterranean to Europe. It has launched a plan to find more oil and gas, spurred on by its protracted financial crisis and encouraged by recent large gas finds offshore Israel and Cyprus.[nL8N1IV1KF]

Stathakis said Greece could start earning the proceeds from offshore exploration around 2025.

Hellenic Petroleum and the country's sole oil producer, Energean , have secured licences to look for hydrocarbons in western Greece.

Oil majors Total and ExxonMobil have also applied for oil and gas exploration licences off the island of Crete. [nL8N1JK2LP] ($1 = 0.8779 euros)

Après l'Iran, Total pourrait remporter un gros contrat au Qatar - 路透新闻

{{20170710T104947.814+0000}}Après l'Iran, Total pourrait remporter un gros contrat au Qatar* Des sources à Doha disent que Total est favori

* Le Qatar et l'Iran sont sont rapprochés économiquement

* Total se veut neutre dans la crise diplomatique régionale

par Tom Finn, Ron Bousso et Dmitry Zhdannikov

DOHA/LONDRES, 10 juillet (Reuters) - Total , qui a signé la semaine dernière un accord avec l'Iran en vue de développer la phase 11 de South Pars, est également en pole position côté qatari pour exploiter le plus grand gisement de gaz naturel au monde, a-t-on appris lundi de deux sources proches de Doha.

Le groupe français est, selon ces sources, mieux placé que des concurrents comme ExxonMobil et Royal Dutch Shell dans la phase de développement de ce gisement situé à cheval entre les eaux territoriales de l'Iran et du Qatar.

Le Qatar, soucieux de contrer son isolement diplomatique dans la région, souhaite accélérer le développement de sa partie du gisement appelée North Field.

L'Arabie saoudite, les Emirats arabes unis, Bahreïn et l'Egypte ont rompu le 5 juin leurs relations puis fermé toutes frontières aériennes, maritimes et terrestres avec le petit Etat du Golfe, qu'ils accusent de liens avec le terrorisme et de rapprochement avec l'Iran, des allégations que Doha réfute. [nL8N1JY51N]

Le PDG de Total Patrick Pouyanné, qui refuse de prendre parti dans cette crise diplomatique, a signé le 3 juillet un accord avec l'Iran d'une durée de 20 ans pour un projet South Pars, dont le coût total pourrait atteindre 4,8 milliards de dollars, devenant devenu ainsi la première des majors pétrolières à revenir en Iran depuis la levée des sanctions commerciales. [nL8N1JU2Q3]

Patrick Pouyanné a dit avoir informé le Qatar de ses projets avec l'Iran. "Le bloc iranien où nous sommes censés produire jouxte le Qatar. Quand je me suis rendu à Doha j'en ai parlé avec les autorités et on m'a dit 'C'est OK. On vous connaît.'"

La stratégie d'ouverture de Total semble porter ses fruits.

"Je m'attends à ce que Total soit le mieux placé pour le nouveau projet (qatari), en raison des problèmes politiques en jeu et de ses récents accords dans South Pars (avec l'Iran)", a déclaré une source haut placée dans le Golfe.

D'un côté, travailler avec deux pays qui partagent un gisement gazier semble une évidence, mais de l'autre, cela n'est pas sans risques pour Total.

Outre l'Iran et le Qatar, Total a également de gros projets en Arabie Saoudite et aux Emirats arabes unis, ce qui souligne la complexité des ses investissements au Moyen-Orient.

DE POSSIBLES ÉCONOMIES DE COÛTS

Le Qatar, déjà premier exportateur mondial de gaz liquéfié, a levé en avril une interdiction sur le développement du gisement de North Field et a dit la semaine dernière vouloir accroître la capacité de production de gaz d'environ 30% à 100 milliards de mètres cubes. [nL8N1JV3O6]

L'initiative a été largement perçue comme une démonstration de force dans son conflit avec ses voisins du Golfe et l'Egypte.

Le Qatar est devenu une puissance gazière au cours de la dernière décennie grâce au concours des majors comme Exxon, Total et Shell.

Leurs projets ont généré des milliards de dollars de recettes pour le Qatar et ses partenaires occidentaux et l'accroissement prévue de la production de Doha va en faire un acteur encore plus incontournable car il contrôle déjà un tiers de la production mondiale actuelle de gaz naturel liquéfié (GNL).

Des sources ont déclaré à Reuters ce mois-ci qu'Exxon, Shell et Total avaient tous exprimé des marques d'intérêt pour permettre au Qatar d'augmenter sa production de gaz.

Sollicités sur le sujet, Exxon, Shell et Total n'ont pas souhaité s'exprimer.

Même sans ce nouvel appel d'offres qui doit encore être annoncé, le rôle de Total au Qatar devrait croître sensiblement car le groupe a décroché en 2016 une participation de 30% pendant 25 ans dans l'exploitation d'Al-Shaheen, le principal gisement pétrolier offshore du Qatar.

Total, qui reprendra l'exploitation du gisement à Maersk Oil le 14 juillet, prévoit d'investir deux milliards de dollars (1,75 milliard d'euros) dans le projet au cours des cinq prochaines années.

Les coûts de production de gaz de l'émirat étant parmi les plus bas au monde, être choisi par le Qatar offrirait à Total un avantage stratégique sur ses concurrents sur le marché mondial à forte croissance du GNL.

La participation du groupe français dans ce gisement des deux côtés de la frontière peut également lui permettre de réaliser des économies de coûts et une meilleure compréhension de la géologie des gisements, bien que Patrick Pouyanné ait déclaré qu'il n'y avait aucun mécanisme pour coordonner la production conjointement par les pays.

Le développement de la production au cours des 5 à 7 prochaines années pourrait coûter entre 14 et 18 milliards de dollars, selon le consultant Wood Mackenzie.

"Le Qatar pourrait également vouloir montrer qu'il est toujours favorable aux affaires en dépit des conflits diplomatiques actuels avec certains de ses voisins du Golfe", a-t-il déclaré.

Interrogé samedi aux rencontres économiques d'Aix-en-Provence, Patrick Pouyanné a dit ne pas vouloir prendre parti dans la crise diplomatique qui oppose le Qatar à ses voisins du Golfe. "Je suis qatari au Qatar, emirati aux Emirats, iranien en Iran. Je n'ai pas à choisir entre ces pays", a expliqué le PDG de Total. [nL8N1JY51N]

Total, İran'la ilişkisinden dolayı Katar gaz anlaşmalarında önde gidiyor - 路透新闻

{{20170710T104356.179+0000}}Total, İran'la ilişkisinden dolayı Katar gaz anlaşmalarında önde gidiyorTom Finn / Ron Bousso / Dmitry Zhdannikov

DOHA/LONDRA, 10 Temmuz (Reuters) - Fransız petrol şirketi Total'in dünyanın en büyük doğalgaz sahasına sahip olan Katar'ın üretimini artırmasını desteklemede öncü rol oynayabilecek çok elverişli bir konumda olduğu belirtiliyor.

Doha'nın bu konusundaki düşüncesini yakından bilen iki kaynağın verdiği bilgiye göre, paylaştıkları doğalgaz sahasının İran tarafında da faaliyeti gösteriyor olması, Total'in bu konumuna yardımcı oluyor.

Bu durum, Total'e, üretim artırma çalışmalarından ilk adaylar olarak, Exxon ve Shell gibi rakiplerinden daha avantajlı bir konum sağlıyor.

Katar, üretimini artırma girişimini, bölgesel bir diplomatik uzlaşmazlık nedeniyle içine itildiği ve giderek büyüyen izolasyona karşılık olarak yapacağını duyurmuştu. Total'in patronu Patrick Pouyanne, ortak doğalgaz rezervinin İran'a ait olan Güney Pars sahasını işletme anlaşmasını bu ay imzaladı. Bu anlaşmayla Total, İran üzerindeki yaptırımların kaldırılmasından bu yana bu ülkede faaliyete yeniden başlayan ilk büyük petrol şirketi oldu. [NL8N1JU2W4]

Pouayne, bu anlaşmanın ayrıntılarının belirlenmesi sürecinde,Katar'ı daima devrede tutmaya özen göstermişti.

Reuters'e açıklama yapan Pouyanne, "Elbette Katar'dan habersiz İran'da aynı sahalara girmeyeceğiz" dedi.

"İran'da bizim üretim yapacağımız blok Katar sınırına bitişik. Doha'ya gittiğimde bu konuyu Katar yetkilileriyle görüştüm ve bize, 'Sorun yok, biz siz tanıyoruz' dediler" dedi.

Pouyanne, Total'in her iki ülke açısından bilgi mahremiyetine titizlikle saygı gösterdiğini söyledi. Pouyanne'ın sınır ötesi stratejisi belli ki, daha şimdiden olumlu sonuçlar veriyor.

Körfez'den önde gelen bir enerji kaynağı, "Etkili olan siyasi sorunlar ve İran'ın Güney Pars sahası için yaptıkları yeni anlaşma nedeniyle, (Katar'ın) yeni projesinde en güçlü pozisyonda Total'in olacağını düşünüyorum" dedi.

Zengin bir doğalgaz yatağını paylaşan iki ülke ile birlikte çalışmak, elbette mantıklı. Ancak bu, Total için risk de taşıyor.

Suudi Arabistan, Birleşik Arap Emirlikleri, Bahreyn ve Mısır Katar'a siyasi ve ekonomik ambargo getirerek, terörizmi desteklemekten ve İran ile yakın ilişki kurmaktan vazgeçmesini istediler.

Suudi Arabistan'ın en büyük rakibi olan Katar, bu suçlamaları reddediyor.

Total'in, İran ve Katar'ın yanı sıra, Suudi Arabistan'da ve Birleşik Arap Emirlikleri'nde de büyük projeler yürütüyor olması, Ortadoğu'da yatırım yapmanın ne denli karmaşık olduğunu vurguluyor.

After Iran move, Total seen in pole position to snap up Qatar gas deals - 路透新闻

{{20170710T070002.137+0000}}After Iran move, Total seen in pole position to snap up Qatar gas deals* Sources in Doha say Total favoured for gas expansion

* Qatar and Iran have grown closer economically

* Saudis wants Qatar to sever diplomatic ties with Iran

By Tom Finn, Ron Bousso and Dmitry Zhdannikov

DOHA/LONDON, July 10 (Reuters) - Total is well placed to take a lead role in helping Qatar expand output from the world's largest gas field, largely thanks to its involvement in the Iranian side of the shared deposit, two sources familiar with Doha's thinking said.

That puts the French oil major ahead of rivals like Exxon and Shell in the early running for developing the expansion, which the tiny Gulf state announced as it seeks to counter growing isolation caused by a regional diplomatic rift.

Total boss Patrick Pouyanne signed a deal this month to develop the South Pars field, as Iran's part of the shared reserves are known, becoming the first oil major to return to the country since the lifting of sanctions. [nL8N1JU2W4]

As he was ironing out details of that agreement, he was careful to keep Qatar in the loop.

"Of course, I won't go to the same field in Iran without telling Qatar," Pouyanne told Reuters.

"The Iranian block where we are supposed to produce is next to the border with Qatar. When I travelled to Doha I discussed it with the (Qatari) authorities and they told us: 'It is ok - we know you'."

Pouyanne says Total strictly respects confidentiality of data vis-à-vis each country. The executive's cross-border strategy, however, appears to be paying early dividends.

"I would expect Total to be in the strongest position for the new (Qatari) project, because of the political issues at play and their recent deals in (Iran's) South Pars," one senior Gulf energy source said.

On one level, working with both countries who share a prized gas asset seems obvious. But it is not without risks for Total.

Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt have imposed political and economic sanctions on Qatar, demanding that it stops fostering terrorism and courting Iran, Riyadh's main rival. Qatar denies the accusations.

Besides Iran and Qatar, Total also has large projects in Saudi Arabia and the UAE, highlighting the complexity of investing in the Middle East. [nL8N1JW0KM]

COST SAVINGS POSSIBLE

Qatar, already the world's largest liquefied gas exporter, lifted a self-imposed ban on development of the North Field in April and last week it said it would raise gas output capacity by around 30 percent to 100 billion cubic metres.

The move was widely seen as a show of strength in its dispute with Gulf neighbours and Egypt. [nL8N1JV3LI]

Qatar has built its gas export power over the past decade with support from global oil majors including ExxonMobil , Total, and Royal Dutch Shell . [nL8N1JW0KM]

The projects have generated billions of dollars for Qatar and its Western partners and the planned expansion to its gas capacity would make Qatar even more dominant in the gas market, accounting for a third of current global LNG output.

Sources told Reuters earlier this month that Exxon, Shell and Total have all expressed interest in helping Qatar expand its gas facilities, with top executives travelling to Doha in recent weeks even after a spike in political tensions. [nL8N1JW5NC]

Exxon, Shell and Total declined to comment on plans to participate in Qatar's tenders to expand gas capacity, which are yet to be announced and will take several years to complete.

Even without those tenders, Total's role in Qatar is set to grow significantly after it won a 30 percent stake in 2016 in a new 25-year contract to operate its largest offshore Al-Shaheen oilfield.

Total, which will take over the field operation from Maersk Oil on July 14, plans to invest $2 billion in expanding the field over the next five years.

With Qatar's gas production costs among the lowest in the world, being a part of any expansion would give Total a strategic advantage over rivals in the fast-growing global LNG market.

Total's involvement in fields on both sides of the Qatari-Iranian border may also help save on costs and service contracts as well as better understand the fields' geology, although Pouyanne said there was no mechanism to coordinate production jointly by the countries.

The development of the new capacity over the next 5-7 years could cost between $14-$18 billion, according to consultant Wood Mackenzie.

"Qatar may also be keen to show it is still open for business despite the current diplomatic disputes with some of its Gulf neighbours," it said.

{{20170707T204140.722+0000}}UPDATE 1-Exxon Baytown refinery HCU overhaul to finish in Aug -sources(Adds details on overhaul)

HOUSTON, July 7 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp expects to finish the overhaul of the hydrocracking unit (HCU) at its 560,500 barrel-per-day (bpd) Baytown, Texas, refinery on schedule in early August, said sources familiar with plant operations.

An Exxon spokeswoman said on Friday in a statement that planned maintenance was underway at the Baytown refinery, but declined to say which units were involved in the work.

Work on the 25,000-bpd hydrocracker began on June 12. [nL1N1JA0XK]

Hydrocrackers use hydrogen under high heat and pressure in the presence of a catalyst to convert distillate feedstocks into motor fuels, primarily diesel. Diesel is a lucrative export for U.S. Gulf Coast refiners.

{{20170706T193542.564+0000}}UPDATE 1-Exxon shuts Beaumont, Texas hydrocracker for electrical repairs -sources(Adds company comment in paragraph 3)

HOUSTON, July 6 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp shut the hydrocracking unit (HCU) at its 362,300 barrel per day (bpd) Beaumont, Texas, refinery on Thursday for electrical repairs, sources familiar with plant operations said.

The 65,000 bpd HCU was shut after an electrical malfunction, the sources said. It was unknown how long the repairs would take to complete.

An Exxon spokeswoman declined to discuss operations at the Beaumont refinery, but said the company continues to meet its contractual commitments.

A hydrocracker uses hydrogen and a catalyst under high heat and pressure to produce motor fuel, primarily diesel, from gas oil or other feedstocks. Diesel is a lucrative export for U.S. Gulf Coast refiners.

Vietnam renews India oil deal in tense South China Sea - 路透新闻

{{20170706T144541.176+0000}}Vietnam renews India oil deal in tense South China Sea* India oil concession renewed for two years in disputed waters

* Drilling starts in another block that overlaps Chinese claim

* Vietnam and India share concerns over China

* China also worried at Vietnam's relationships with U.S., Japan

By Mai Nguyen, Nidhi Verma and Sanjeev Miglani

HANOI/NEW DELHI, July 6 (Reuters) - Vietnam has extended an Indian oil concession in the South China Sea and begun drilling in another area it disputes with China in moves that could heighten tensions over who owns what in the vital maritime region.

The moves come at a delicate time in Beijing's relations with Vietnam, which claims parts of the sea, and India, which recently sent warships to monitor the Malacca Straits, through which most of China's energy supplies and trade passes.

Vietnam granted Indian oil firm ONGC Videsh a two-year extension to explore oil block 128 in a letter that arrived earlier this week, the state-run company's managing director Narendra K. Verma told Reuters.

Part of that block is in the U-shaped 'nine-dash line' which marks the vast area that China claims in the sea, a route for more than $5 trillion in trade each year in which the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia and Taiwan also have claims.

A senior official of ONGC Videsh, who asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter, said interest in the block was strategic rather than commercial, given that oil development there was seen as high-risk with only moderate potential.

"Vietnam also wants us to be there because of China's interventions in the South China Sea," the official said.

Vietnam's state-run PetroVietnam declined to comment on the concession, which was first granted to India in 2006 but had been due to expire in mid-June.

Conflicting territorial claims over the sea stretch back many decades but have intensified in recent years as China and its rivals have reinforced their positions on the rocks and reefs they hold.

Far to the south of block 128, drilling has begun in a block owned jointly by Vietnam's state oil firm, Spain's Repsol and Mubadala Development Co [MUDEV.UL] of the United Arab Emirates.

Deepsea Metro I, operated by Odfjell Drilling Ltd. , has been drilling in the region since the middle of last month on behalf of Spain's Repsol SA , which also has rights to neighbouring block 07/03, Odfjell said.

Odfjell declined to comment on the specific location of its vessel, but shipping data from Thomson Reuters Eikon showed it was in oil block 136/3, which also overlaps China's claims.

Odfjell's Eirik Knudsen, V‎ice President for Corporate Finance and Investor Relations, referred further queries to Repsol, which declined to comment. PetroVietnam made no comment.

COMPETING MARITIME CLAIMS

When asked about the activity, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said China opposes anyone "carrying out unilateral, illegal oil and gas activities in waters China has jurisdiction over".

"We hope the relevant country can act on the basis of maintaining regional peace and stability and not do anything to complicate the situation," he told a briefing in Beijing.

Chinese General Fan Changlong cut short a visit to Vietnam and a friendship meeting at the China-Vietnam border was cancelled around the time the drilling began.

The centuries-old mistrust between China and Vietnam is nowhere more evident than in their competing maritime claims, despite their shared communist ideology and growing trade.

Asked about the most recent drilling, Vietnamese officials said their Chinese counterparts have started raising concerns about cooperation with both Repsol and ExxonMobil Corp. of the United States, which is developing the $10 billion "Blue Whale" gas concession off central Vietnam.

They said Chinese officials also expressed concern at Vietnam's evolving security relationships with the United States and Japan, both of which have offered moral support for its South China Sea claims and help for Vietnam's coastguard.

Tensions with China were being contained, however, and had not yet reached crisis proportions, they said.

"We know they are unhappy again, but we are resisting the pressure – it is a traditional part of our relations with Beijing," one official said privately. "Other parts of the relationship remain strong."

Underlining the relationship between India and Vietnam, Vietnamese deputy prime minister Pham Binh Minh told a forum in New Delhi this week that India was welcome to play a bigger role in Southeast Asia - and specifically the South China Sea.

Hanoi's growing defence and commercial ties with India are part of its strategy of seeking many partnerships with big powers while avoiding formal military alliances.

The pace has picked up since Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's administration took office in 2014 and sought to push back against China's expanding presence in South Asia by raising its diplomatic and military engagement in Southeast Asia.

India is providing naval patrol boats, satellite cover to monitor Vietnam's waters and training for its submarines and fighter pilots - more military support than it is giving to any other Southeast Asian country.

On the agenda are transfers of naval vessels and missiles under a $500 million defence credit line announced last year.

Next week, the navies of India, the United States and Japan will hold their largest joint exercises in the Bay of Bengal.

By Ron Bousso and Dmitry Zhdannikov

LONDON, July 5 (Reuters) - Three of the West's biggest energy corporations are lobbying Qatar to take part in a huge expansion of its gas production, handing Doha an unintended but timely boost in its bitter dispute with Gulf Arab neighbours.

The chief executives of ExxonMobil, Royal Dutch Shell and France's Total all met the emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, in Qatar before it announced a plan on Tuesday to raise output of liquefied natural gas (LNG) by 30 percent.

Company and industry sources told Reuters that the CEOs had expressed interest in helping Qatar with its ambition to produce 100 million tonnes of LNG annually - equivalent to a third of current global supplies - in the next five to seven years.

The companies already have large investments in countries on both sides of the dispute, and are keen to remain neutral after Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt severed ties with Doha on June 5. [nL8N1JW0KM]

Spokespeople from all three firms declined comment. However, a top executive from one energy major looking into expanding in Qatar said the huge business opportunity was worth the considerable political risk.

"There is only one policy here – you have to behave like a commercial corporation," the executive told Reuters. "You have to make your choices purely economically and be Qatari in Qatar, Emirati in the Emirates."

Energy sales have powered Qatar's rapid rise as a regional player since the late 1990s, and the oil majors' interest in the LNG expansion underline its longer-term economic muscle during the political row with its neighbours.

Chief executives Darren Woods of Exxon and Ben van Beurden of Shell both met the emir after the four Arab countries imposed the sanctions. Total chief Patrick Pouyanne has also visited Doha in recent weeks.

Qatar, the world's largest LNG supplier and second biggest gas exporter after Russia, has some of the lowest production costs. The plan was seen as an opening shot in a price war as Doha tries to defend its market share, especially against supplies from U.S. shale deposits where costs are higher.

WILLINGNESS TO INVEST

The four Arab countries, which have demanded Qatar stop fostering terrorism and courting Iran, said after meeting on Wednesday that Doha's response to their grievances had been negative.

Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir said the political and economic boycott would remain until Qatar improved its policies. Further steps would be taken at the appropriate time, he said.

Doha denies aiding terrorism and its foreign minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani, accused the four of "clear aggression" while adding that Qatar continued to call for dialogue to settle the dispute. [nL8N1JW27A] [nL8N1JW1Y1]

Exxon, Shell and Total have already invested extensively in Qatar, particularly in projects to liquefy gas, allowing it to be shipped by tanker to consumer markets where transport by pipeline is not feasible.

Woods met the emir on June 26, discussing "cooperation" with Qatar, where Exxon has been present since 1935, according to a statement carried by the state news agency.

Industry sources close to the talks said that "the Exxon CEO was very keen to join the new gas capacity expansion and expressed willingness to invest".

Woods replaced Rex Tillerson, under whom Exxon helped to build Qatar's LNG industry until he left to become U.S. Secretary of State earlier this year.

Exxon will be the largest foreign investor in Qatar in 2017, with most money going into LNG facilities, representing around seven percent of its global portfolio, according to consultancy WoodMackenzie.

Shell's Van Beurden was among the first foreign company leaders to visit Qatar after the crisis broke out, meeting the emir on June 14. This was followed several days later by a new deal under which Qatar will supply Shell, the world's largest LNG trader, with 1.1 million tonnes annually for five years starting in 2019.

Shell's operations in Qatar include Pearl GTL, the world's largest gas liquefaction plant. Its overall investments in the state represent around six percent of its global portfolio.

The three firms had been expecting Qatar to expand its LNG exports since it lifted a self-imposed moratorium on development of the North Field, the world's biggest natural gas field it shares with Iran, the sources said.

Oil and gas companies generally are no strangers to operating in risky areas. This week Total became the first Western energy firm to invest in Iran since the lifting of sanctions against the country. The project, phase 11 of Iran's South Pars development, draws gas from the same reservoir as Qatar's North Field.[nL8N1JU2W4]

Total chief Pouyanne discussed new opportunities in the LNG sector as well as the company's plans to develop the Al-Shaheen oil field on his trip to Doha, according to a senior source.

Qatar's LNG capacity could be boosted by up to 10 million tonnes per year relatively quickly and cheaply by optimising existing facilities and upgrading a small number of units, a process known as "debottlenecking", according to a senior industry source.

Beyond that, the expansion would require building new liquefaction terminals involving significant investments, which the energy giants can offer.

"Qatar LNG is really an important part of their overall portfolio, especially for Exxon but Total and Shell are also material LNG players there," Tom Ellacott, analyst at WoodMackenzie said.

"Qatar LNG is very competitive. Debottlenecking will be a relatively cheap option to increase capacity, but with the industry at a low point in the cost cycle, it may also be a good time to install new terminals."

par Chuck Mikolajczak

NEW YORK, 5 juillet (Reuters) - La rechute des cours du pétrole a freiné mercredi le Dow Jones et le S&P-500, qui ont fini sans grand changement à la Bourse de New York, alors que le Nasdaq a une nouvelle fois profité du dynamisme du secteur technologique.

Wall Street a par ailleurs largement ignoré le compte-rendu de la dernière réunion du comité de politique monétaire de la Réserve fédérale. Ces "minutes" publiées pendant la séance ont témoigné des tensions croissantes au sein de la Fed au sujet de la faiblesse persistante de l'inflation et de ses conséquences sur le rythme du resserrement monétaire aux Etats-Unis. [nL8N1JW58Z]

Alors que les marchés américains étaient fermés mardi en raison de la fête nationale aux Etats-Unis, les investisseurs ont aussi évité de prendre trop de risques avant la publication vendredi des chiffres mensuels de l'emploi américain.

L'indice Dow Jones <.DJI> a perdu 1,10 point (-0,01%), à 21.478,17. Le Standard & Poor's 500 <.SPX>, plus large et principale référence des investisseurs, a pris 3,53 points, soit 0,15%, à 2.432,54. Le Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC>, à forte composante technologique, a pour sa part fini en hausse de 40,80 points (+0,67%) à 6.150,86.

Les cours du pétrole ont nettement rechuté mercredi sur le marché new-yorkais Nymex après huit séances consécutives de hausse, leur plus longue phase de progression depuis février 2012. Le baril de brut léger américain a cédé plus de 4%. [nL8N1JW54R]

Dans son sillage, Exxon Mobil et Chevron ont abandonné respectivement 1,52% et 1,58%. Les deux géants du secteur pétrolier ont été parmi les principaux freins à la progression du Dow et du S&P-500.

L'indice sectoriel de l'énergie <.SPNY> (-2,01%) a connu son plus fort repli sur une séance depuis quasiment quatre mois.

Les valeurs technologiques <.SPLRCT> ont au contraire brillé, comme depuis le début de l'année, affichant la plus forte progression sectorielle du jour (+1,04%) dans le sillage d'Amazon (+1,86%), Microsoft (+1,34%), Alphabet (+1,39%), Facebook (+1,29%) ou encore Apple (+0,41%).

TESLA SANCTIONNÉ APRÈS SES VENTES SEMESTRIELLES

L'indice des valeurs technologiques a pris plus de 16% depuis le début de l'année et il a connu de brusques accès de volatilité ces dernières semaines en raison des valorisations élevées dans le secteur, qui nourrissent des interrogations.

"L'énergie, j'ai vraiment du mal à me laisser enthousiasmer", a dit Robert Phipps, directeur de Per Stirling Capital Management. "(Alors que) le secteur des technologies se présente comme celui où les coûts de production ne cessent de baisser."

Toujours dans le secteur des "techs", Micron Technology a gagné 4,7%. Le groupe de semi-conducteurs a démenti un article de presse selon lequel un incident grave dans l'une de ses usines taïwanaises avait pénalisé sa production.

Son concurrent Advanced Micro Devices a fait encore mieux avec un gain de 8,56%, les deux entreprises affichant les deux plus fortes hausses du S&P-500 et du secteur technologique.

Le numéro un mondial des semi-conducteurs Intel a pris 2,63%, plus forte hausse du Dow Jones.

Tesla a en revanche chuté de 7,24% à 327,09 dollars, sa plus forte baisse en une séance depuis juin 2016, dans des volumes plus de deux fois et demi supérieurs à leur moyenne quotidienne sur les trois derniers mois. Le constructeur de voitures électriques a annoncé lundi que ses livraisons au premier semestre s'étaient situées dans le bas de sa fourchette de prévisions en raison notamment de problèmes de batteries.

Le vendeur de pièces automobiles O'Reilly Automotive a pour sa part plongé de 18,89% en raison de ventes au deuxième trimestre largement inférieures à ses propres prévisions. Il a entraîné ses concurrents Autozone (-9,6%) et Advance Auto Parts (-11,15%).

Environ 6,52 milliards de titres ont été échangés sur les marchés actions américains contre une moyenne quotidienne de 7,19 milliards sur les 20 dernières séances.

La publication des "minutes" de la Fed n'a eu qu'un effet bref et limité sur le marché obligataire, qui a davantage réagi au recul plus prononcé que prévu des commandes à l'industrie en mai aux Etats-Unis. [nL8N1JW4AT]

"Les commandes à l'industrie ont fait baisser les rendements (des Treasuries) et puis évidemment nous avons vendu dans un premier temps après les minutes puis nous sommes revenus", dit Stanley Sun, stratégiste sur les taux d'intérêt chez Nomura Securities International. "Dans l'ensemble, ces minutes ont été relativement neutres."

Le rendement à 10 ans des emprunts du Trésor américain a reculé sous 2,33% contre plus de 2,34% la veille.

Le dollar n'a pour sa part quasiment pas bougé, légèrement en-dessous de 1,3350 pour un euro et à 96,26 face à un panier de devises de référence <.DXY>.

FACTBOX-Oil majors' investments in countries involved in Qatar row - 路透新闻

{{20170705T171954.500+0000}}FACTBOX-Oil majors' investments in countries involved in Qatar rowDUBAI, July 5 (Reuters) - The West's three biggest energy corporations are lobbying Qatar to take part in a huge expansion of its gas production, handing Doha an unintended but timely boost in its bitter dispute with Gulf Arab neighbours. [nL8N1JW2PB]

ExxonMobil, Royal Dutch Shell and Total already have large investments in countries on both sides of the dispute, and are keen not to take sides after Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt severed ties with Doha on June 5.

Here are some facts about international oil companies which operate in the Gulf countries involved in the rift:

EXXONMOBIL

** Qatar

The U.S. oil major's relationship with Qatar goes back to 1935 when it was known as Socony-Vacuum, and later Mobil.

It helped to develop the North Field, the world's biggest gas field, and supplied Qatar with technology to make it the top competitor in the LNG market.

Qatar's LNG production is divided between two companies, Qatargas and Rasgas. State oil company Qatar Petroleum (QP) owns a majority stake in both.

RasGas is 70 percent-owned by QP and 30 percent-owned by ExxonMobil, while Qatargas is owned by a consortium including QP, ExxonMobil, Total, Mitsui <8031.T>, Marubeni <8002.T>, ConocoPhillips and Royal Dutch Shell.

ExxonMobil is also the only foreign participant in two domestic gas projects, Al-Khaleej Gas and Barzan Gas.

** Saudi Arabia

ExxonMobil is one of the largest foreign investors in Saudi Arabia, with more than 3,000 Saudi nationals working in the joint ventures in which the U.S. oil major participates. These range from petrochemicals manufacturing to petroleum refining.

The company began working with Saudi Arabia in 1927 and owned a stake in the state oil giant Saudi Aramco before it was fully nationalised in the 1980s.

ExxonMobil has been a partner with Aramco in several major projects over the years including building the East-West Pipeline (Petroline) linking the Eastern Province fields with Yanbu on the Red Sea and the SAMREF refinery in Yanbu, which is equally-owned by Aramco and a subsidiary of Exxon.

It is also a partner with SABIC in two petrochemical joint ventures - Saudi Yanbu Petrochemical Company (YANPET), and Al-Jubail Petrochemical Company (KEMYA).

** The UAE

ExxonMobil was awarded the first oil concession in Abu Dhabi, now the capital of the UAE, in 1939.

Exxon is now developing the Upper Zakum offshore oilfield through a joint venture, Zakum Development Company (ZADCO), with Abu Dhabi National Oil Company. ADNOC has a 60 percent stake, while Exxon owns 28 percent and Japan's Jodco 12 percent.

The U.S. company also markets lubricants and petrochemicals for the Middle East and North Africa region out of its office in Dubai.

TOTAL

** Qatar

The French oil major has been working with Qatar since 1936 through cooperation with Qatar Petroleum in developing LNG, refining and petrochemicals projects.

Total is one of the main partners of Qatargas, the world's largest LNG producer, owning stakes in Qatargas 1 and Qatargas 2. It is a main shareholder in the Dolphin Energy pipeline which transfers natural gas from Qatar to the UAE and Oman.

It has joint ventures with Qatar Petroleum to develop the Al-Khalij and Al-Shaheen oil fields. Total Refining & Petrochemicals has stakes in both Qatar Petrochemicals Company (QAPCO), operating a petrochemical complex manufacturing ethylene and low-density polyethylene, and QATOFIN. Total is a partner in the Ras Laffan refinery and also sells lubricants.

** Saudi Arabia

Total has been present in Saudi Arabia for almost 40 years and is a main player in the downstream sector. The French company has a 51 percent stake in the Saudi Total Petroleum Products joint venture, which manufactures and retails lubricants and specialty products.

It owns a 37.5 percent stake in the SATORP joint ventre - a 400,000 barrels per day refining and petrochemicals complex in Jubail - with Saudi Aramco owning the remaining 62.5 percent.

** The UAE

Since 1939, Total has been working with the majority of Abu Dhabi's oil and gas operating companies and other energy firms: ADCO, ADMA-OPCO, ADGAS, GASCO, FERTIL, Taweelah A1, Shams 1 and Dolphin Energy.

It has a 10 percent stake in a 40-year onshore concession to help develop Abu Dhabi's biggest oilfields.

** Iran

Total signed a 20-year contract with Iran this week to develop the giant South Pars gas field, which it shares with Qatar. The deal is the first major Western energy investment since sanctions against Tehran were lifted.

Total will be the operator with a 50.1 percent stake in South Pars. The first stage will cost around $2 billion.

SHELL

** Qatar

Shell said it is the biggest international investor in Qatar, surpassing Exxon. It is in partnership with Qatar Petroleum in projects covering LNG production, gas to liquids (GTL), shipping, exploration and petrochemicals.

One of Shell's main investments in Qatar is Pearl Gas-to-Liquids in Ras Laffan, the largest GTL plant in the world.

The company also own a 30 percent stake in Qatargas 4, an integrated LNG production facility together with Qatar Petroleum, and is the shipping and maritime services provider for QatarGas Transport Company (Nakilat).

** Saudi Arabia

Shell has a diverse business with Saudi Arabia. It has a stake in SASREF, a 50:50 joint venture refinery at Jubail with a crude oil refining capacity of 305,000 bpd, and a partnership with SABIC through its SADAF joint venture.

It also has a joint venture that markets and sells Shell lubricants, and another that handles aviation re-fueling operations in the kingdom.

** The UAE

Shell currently does not own a direct stake in UAE's oil or gas fields as talks with ADNOC to renew its 40-year oil concession stalled. However, the company has its regional headquarters in Dubai, through which it manages its businesses in the Middle East.

** Other foreign companies such as Occidental have operations in both Qatar and the UAE, while ConocoPhillips also owns interests in Qatar and Saudi Arabia.

** Trading houses including the world's biggest names such as Vitol, Trafigura and Glencore also have business interests with all the countries locked in the political crisis.

** Asian countries such as China, India, South Korea and Japan are major buyers of crude, condensate and LNG from the Middle East producers.

By Ron Bousso and Dmitry Zhdannikov

LONDON, July 5 (Reuters) - The West's three biggest energy corporations are lobbying Qatar to take part in a huge expansion of its gas production, handing Doha an unintended but timely boost in its bitter dispute with Gulf Arab neighbours.

The chief executives of ExxonMobil, Royal Dutch Shell and France's Total all met the emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, in Qatar before it announced a plan on Tuesday to raise output of liquefied natural gas (LNG) by 30 percent.

Company and industry sources told Reuters that the CEOs had expressed interest in helping Qatar with its ambition to produce 100 million tonnes of LNG annually - equivalent to a third of current global supplies - in the next five to seven years.

The companies already have large investments in countries on both sides of the dispute, and are keen to remain neutral after Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt severed ties with Doha on June 5. [nL8N1JW0KM]

Spokespeople from all three firms declined comment. However, a top executive from one energy major looking into expanding in Qatar said the huge business opportunity was worth the considerable political risk.

"There is only one policy here – you have to behave like a commercial corporation," the executive told Reuters. "You have to make your choices purely economically and be Qatari in Qatar, Emirati in the Emirates."

Energy sales have powered Qatar's rapid rise as a regional player since the late 1990s, and the oil majors' interest in the LNG expansion underline its longer-term economic muscle during the political row with its neighbours.

Chief executives Darren Woods of Exxon and Ben van Beurden of Shell both met the emir after the four Arab countries imposed the sanctions. Total chief Patrick Pouyanne has also visited Doha in recent weeks.

Qatar, the world's largest LNG supplier and second biggest gas exporter after Russia, has some of the lowest production costs. The plan was seen as an opening shot in a price war as Doha tries to defend its market share, especially against supplies from U.S. shale deposits where costs are higher.

WILLINGNESS TO INVEST

The four Arab countries, which have demanded Qatar stop fostering terrorism and courting Iran, said after meeting on Wednesday that Doha's response to their grievances had been negative.

Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir said the political and economic boycott would remain until Qatar improved its policies. Further steps would be taken at the appropriate time, he said.

Doha denies aiding terrorism and its foreign minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani, accused the four of "clear aggression" while adding that Qatar continued to call for dialogue to settle the dispute. [nL8N1JW27A] [nL8N1JW1Y1]

Exxon, Shell and Total have already invested extensively in Qatar, particularly in projects to liquefy gas, allowing it to be shipped by tanker to consumer markets where transport by pipeline is not feasible.

Woods met the emir on June 26, discussing "cooperation" with Qatar, where Exxon has been present since 1935, according to a statement carried by the state news agency.

Industry sources close to the talks said that "the Exxon CEO was very keen to join the new gas capacity expansion and expressed willingness to invest".

Woods replaced Rex Tillerson, under whom Exxon helped to build Qatar's LNG industry until he left to become U.S. Secretary of State earlier this year.

Exxon will be the largest foreign investor in Qatar in 2017, with most money going into LNG facilities, representing around seven percent of its global portfolio, according to consultancy WoodMackenzie.

Shell's Van Beurden was among the first foreign company leaders to visit Qatar after the crisis broke out, meeting the emir on June 14. This was followed several days later by a new deal under which Qatar will supply Shell, the world's largest LNG trader, with 1.1 million tonnes annually for five years starting in 2019.

Shell's operations in Qatar include Pearl GTL, the world's largest gas liquefaction plant. Its overall investments in the state represent around six percent of its global portfolio.

The three firms had been expecting Qatar to expand its LNG exports since it lifted a self-imposed moratorium on development of the North Field, the world's biggest natural gas field it shares with Iran, the sources said.

Oil and gas companies generally are no strangers to operating in risky areas. This week Total became the first Western energy firm to invest in Iran since the lifting of sanctions against the country. The project, phase 11 of Iran's South Pars development, draws gas from the same reservoir as Qatar's North Field.[nL8N1JU2W4]

Total chief Pouyanne discussed new opportunities in the LNG sector as well as the company's plans to develop the Al-Shaheen oil field on his trip to Doha, according to a senior source.

Qatar's LNG capacity could be boosted by up to 10 million tonnes per year relatively quickly and cheaply by optimising existing facilities and upgrading a small number of units, a process known as "debottlenecking", according to a senior industry source.

Beyond that, the expansion would require building new liquefaction terminals involving significant investments, which the energy giants can offer.

"Qatar LNG is really an important part of their overall portfolio, especially for Exxon but Total and Shell are also material LNG players there," Tom Ellacott, analyst at WoodMackenzie said.

"Qatar LNG is very competitive. Debottlenecking will be a relatively cheap option to increase capacity, but with the industry at a low point in the cost cycle, it may also be a good time to install new terminals."

Le document devrait permettre d'en savoir plus sur l'évolution des débats au sein du FOMC, le comité de politique monétaire.

La Fed devrait procéder à une troisième hausse des taux cette année, bien que les investisseurs s'inquiètent du ralentissement de l'inflation, encore inférieure à l'objectif de 2% en rythme annuel qu'elle s'est fixé.

"Les marchés regarderont si les minutes suggèrent que le ralentissement de l'inflation est 'transitoire' et que le relèvement des taux est toujours d'actualité à moins que l'économie américaine ne ralentisse", explique Lukman Otunuga, analyste chez FXTN Research.

Les investisseurs auront pris connaissance à 14h00 GMT des chiffres des commandes à l'industrie en mai.

Les prix du pétrole reculent après huit séances consécutives de progression. Le Brent évolue autour des 49 dollars le baril et le brut léger américain (West Texas Intermediate, WTI) passe sous les 47 dollars.

ANALYSIS-Qatar signals LNG price war for market share in Asia - 路透新闻

{{20170705T092521.773+0000}}ANALYSIS-Qatar signals LNG price war for market share in Asia* Qatar plans to raise LNG output to 100 million tonnes a year

* Qatar is world's top LNG exporter, but competition is rising

* Producers fight over Asian market, which consumes 70 pct of LNG

* Qatar has helped it become the world's richest country

By Henning Gloystein and Mark Tay

SINGAPORE, July 5 (Reuters) - Qatar's plan to boost liquefied natural gas (LNG) output by 30 percent is the opening shot in a price war for customers in Asia pitting the Gulf state against competitors from the United States, Russia and Australia.

Qatar, facing regional isolation in a diplomatic dispute with its Gulf neighbours, took energy markets by surprise on Tuesday when it said it would raise its LNG production to 100 million tonnes per year - equivalent to a third of current global supplies - within the next five to seven years.

It suggests the wealthy kingdom is preparing for a lengthy battle with Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, who were due to meet on Wednesday to decide whether to continue sanctions they imposed on Qatar over accusations it was aiding terrorism and courting regional rival Iran. [nL8N1JV4H2]

Qatar's move will add gas to an already oversupplied market in a thinly disguised challenge to other exporters who are also raising their output.

With low production costs and infrastructure already in place, Qatar is well placed to come out on top, analysts say. Flooding the market with more LNG will help defend its place as the world's top exporter, a position challenged by Australia.

"Qatar is losing market share, so it could be about becoming number one again in LNG," said Neil Beveridge, senior oil and gas analyst at research and brokerage firm Sanford C. Bernstein.

FOCUS ON ASIA

LNG is super-cooled natural gas that is transported on tankers around the world.

Long a niche product, it has become an industry darling as natural gas is a cleaner fossil fuel than oil or coal and is also versatile, with potential uses ranging from power generation to heating and as a transport fuel.

U.S. and European oil majors such as Royal Dutch Shell and Chevron have invested huge sums over the last decade - often more than they have spent on oil - in an attempt to dominate the LNG market, especially through mega-projects in Australia such as Chevron's Gorgon or Shell's Prelude. [nL4N1D00MR]

The main battleground for LNG market share is Asia, which consumes 70 percent of the fuel and where it is seen as a key fuel to meet soaring energy demand without the rampant pollution that comes with coal.

The world's biggest LNG buyers are utilities, especially from Japan and South Korea. Sources at these utilities said they were surprised by Qatar's move.

"We would have to figure out why Qatar is planning to boost its output.. We don't have plans yet to import new LNG cargoes from Qatar," said Kim Young-ki, a spokesman at Korea Gas Corp. (KOGAS), one of the world's biggest single LNG buyers.

RAMPING UP PRODUCTION

Qatar's announcement came just a day after Iran signed its first deal with France's Total and China's state-owned oil company CNPC to produce gas from a field it shares with Qatar. [nL8N1JU2W4]

Beveridge, at Sanford C. Bernstein, said Qatar's move to raise output "could be a response to Total restarting development work" on Iran's side of the gas reserves.

Trying to cement its own market share, Russia's Gazprom the world's biggest single producer of natural gas, said late on Tuesday that it would start pumping gas to China through a new pipeline by late 2019, earlier than many expected. [nL8N1JW045]

China is already the top consumer of most commodities, including oil and coal, and as part of a huge investment programme to expand its LNG and pipeline infrastructure it is also on its way to become a top natural gas user.

Australia has invested hundreds of billions of dollars in a bid to overtake Qatar as the world's top LNG exporter by 2019, a challenge Qatar is now rising to.

Qatar, whose state-owned Qatar Petroleum has partnered with U.S. oil giant Exxon Mobil to produce its LNG, has a strong interest in defending its position.

LNG, as well as exports of condensate, a super-light form of crude oil that's a byproduct of gas extraction, have made Qatar rich despite a 70 percent fall in LNG prices and a more than 50 percent drop in oil prices since 2014.

Ramping up LNG exports to 100 million tonnes a year would, at current prices, reap revenues of around $30 billion, with another $6 billion coming from condensate.

That equates to $120,000 per person, helping Qatar to become the world's richest nation, according to the World Bank.

STIFF COMPETITION

The main producers challenged by Qatar's move are those who have yet to attract a final investment decision, especially in the United States.

So far only Cheniere exports U.S. LNG, but there are proposals with a total capacity of 150 million tonnes per year.

Chong Zhi Xin, at energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie, said Qatar's low cost LNG expansion "is pushing a lot of new projects out of the market".

Flooding the market with more LNG at a time of oversupply and when buyers are reluctant to sign on new long-term contracts – which have so far dominated supplies – is expected to boost trading in Asia's spot LNG market, which currently makes up just 15 percent of overall supplies, as more uncontracted supply gets exchanged according to short-term demand. [nL3N1J9338]

The winners in this aggressive fight for market share are consumers.

"Expansion of LNG capacity translates to lower for longer LNG prices," said Kerry Anne Shanks, head of Asia gas and LNG research at Wood Mackenzie. "That's good news for gas buyers."

(Adds background on LNG)

By Tom Finn and Rania El Gamal

DOHA, July 4 (Reuters) - Qatar announced plans for a steep rise in Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) production capacity on Tuesday that suggested it was ready for a protracted dispute with Gulf neighbours, but Doha said it was doing all it could to reach agreement.

Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Bahrain were due to meet on Wednesday to decide whether to continue sanctions they imposed on Qatar on accusations it was aiding terrorism and courting regional rival Iran. Doha denies the charges and has submitted to mediator Kuwait replies to 13 demands that the gathering will consider.

"What Qatar has given in goodwill and good initiative for a constructive solution, based on dialogue, we believe should be sufficient (to show) we have carried out our duties from our side," Qatari Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani told a news conference in Doha.

"There is a lot of progress that has been made on that front (countering terrorism financing)... but of course there is always room for improvement," he said, describing the sanctions as illegal steps under the pretext of fighting terrorism.

The three Gulf states and Egypt have severed diplomatic and transport ties with Doha in a dispute that has raised concern across the Middle East and beyond. Western states fear a lengthy dispute, besides threatening political instability, could upset supply chains in a region vital for energy supplies.

German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel told the same Doha news conference he felt Qatar had shown restraint in the row which began on June 5 when the Gulf states severed diplomatic and transport ties.

"We hope others will respond in a similar spirit.

Qatar says it is ready to meet any "reasonable" demands.

But the Gulf state, with a population of just over two million to Saudi Arabia's 31 million, may be reluctant to carry out conditions such as the closure of the al-Jazeera television station and removal of a Turkish military base - matters it considers impinge on Qatari sovereignty.

Qatar mounted what appeared to be a show of strength on Tuesday, when the state-owned Qatar Petroleum [QATPE.UL] announced plans to raise liquefied natural gas capacity by 30 percent. Its immediate effect will be to worsen a glut on the LNG market where Australia, the United States and Russia vie.

LNG is natural gas liquified at low temperatures to reduce its volume, thus allowing it to be transported by tanker where pipelines are not feasible.

Qatar Petroleum chief executive Saad al-Kaabi said the firm would increase gas production from its giant North Field, which it shares with Iran, by 20 percent after new gas development. In April, Qatar lifted a self-imposed ban on development of the North Field, the world's biggest natural gas field, and announced a new project to develop its southern section, increasing output in five to seven years. [nL5N1HB1RQ]

That new project will raise Qatar's total LNG production capacity by 30 percent to 100 million tonnes from 77 million tonnes per year in five to seven years, Kaabi said.

The decision will have international ramifications.

With such low production costs and LNG facilities closer to buyers in Europe and Asia, the Qatari move means U.S. producers could struggle to sell their LNG competitively and projects still needing finance could struggle to find investors. So far only Cheniere exports U.S. LNG, but there are project proposals with a total capacity of some 150 million tonnes/year.

Energy sales have driven Qatar's rapid rise as a regional player, with vast infrastructure projects and widening diplomatic influence as well as a role in the Syrian conflict that is viewed with suspicion by Gulf neighbours.

The Saudi Ambassador to Sudan Ali Hassan Jaafar, speaking at a news conference, said he hoped the Gulf crisis would end "in the coming hours" with the Qatari response to demands.

"We wish well for the people of Qatar and we hope that the rulers of Qatar return to their senses," he said. "We want stability in the Gulf region and in the Arab region. … If these demands are not fulfilled we will defend our security and stability and there will be other measures."

IRANIAN QUESTION

The LNG glut has already driven down prices. Asian spot LNG prices LNG-AS have fallen more than 40 percent this year to $5.50 per mmBtu and by 70 percent from peaks in 2014.

So far, the majority of LNG is supplied via long-term contracts between producers and users which allow little flexibility and in many cases also prevent importers from reselling cargoes. With supplies far outpacing demand, analysts expect more and more LNG to be freely traded.

Many producers have already started to offer contracts without resale or destination restrictions. [nL3N1J9338]

Kaabi, alluding to suggestions that the Gulf states may ask trading partners to choose between them and Doha, said the company's operations would not be affected by the crisis.

"Qatar Petroleum will continue working...If some companies decide they don't want to work with QP that's their choice. We will find other foreign companies to work with," he said.

Analysts said the move to boost production was partly to do with added competition in the LNG market, mainly from Australia, the United States and Russia.

"It is also to do with Iran now set to increase production on the South Pars field, which means they can up production from their side of the field (North Field) without destabilizing the geology of the field," said Oliver Sanderson, gas analyst at Thomson Reuters.

Some experts say that, while the Gulf States accuse Qatar of cooperating too closely with Iran, their sanctions could push it to closer cooperation with Tehran on gas production and exports from the shared field.

"Qatar needs the support of Iran now more than any time before. I don't believe it would be possible for Qatar to increase production without the cooperation with Iran, if in the long term the (political) situation stayed same as now," said Reza Mostafavi Tabatabaei, president of London-based ENEXD, a firm involved in oil and gas equipment in the Middle East.

"Also, major (oil) companies may be asked to choose between working in Qatar or Saudi/UAE and Egypt, otherwise there be sanctions against them. That's why I don't think that developing this project by Qatar now will be as easy as before, politically not financially," he added.

Qatar Petroleum's Kaabi said there is no cooperation with Iran on any project in the North Field, but the countries have a joint committee that meets yearly to discuss development of the field.

While QP owns a majority stake, energy firms including Total, Mitsui & Co <8031.T> and ConocoPhillips also possess small stakeholdings. RasGas is a 70/30 percent joint venture between QP and Exxon Mobil .

"Qatar has one of the lowest LNG production costs in the world. It has followed an astute policy of maximizing value from market prices around the world," said Ajay Singh, special advisor at Japan Petroleum Exploration Co and former gas executive at Shell. "For Qatar, LNG is everything."

DOHA, July 4 (Reuters) - Qatar announced plans for a steep rise in gas production capacity on Tuesday that suggested it was readying for a protracted dispute with Gulf neighbours, but said it was doing all it could to reach agreement.

Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Bahrain were due to meet on Wednesday to decide whether to continue sanctions they imposed on Qatar on accusations it was aiding terrorism and courting regional rival Iran.

RPT-WRAPUP 1-Qatar raises gas capacity amid Gulf dispute - 路透新闻

{{20170704T141935.271+0000}}RPT-WRAPUP 1-Qatar raises gas capacity amid Gulf dispute(.)

By Tom Finn and Rania El Gamal

DOHA, July 4 (Reuters) - Qatar announced on Tuesday it planned to raise liquefied natural gas (LNG) capacity by 30 percent in an apparent show of strength in its dispute with Gulf neighbours who have imposed political and economic sanctions on Doha.

The unexpected move came as Qatar appears to be preparing itself for greater economic independence should the dispute with Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Bahrain become protracted. Its immediate effect will be to worsen a glut on the LNG market where Australia, the United States and Russia vie.

The Gulf states and Egypt have severed diplomatic and transport ties with Doha, accusing it of supporting terrorism and courting regional rival Iran. Qatar denies the accusation.

The Arab states, who have presented Doha with a list of demands, meet on Wednesday to discuss how to end the crisis; or they could impose more sanctions, which may include asking trade partners to pick a side in the rift.

Qatar Petroleum's [QATPE.UL] chief executive said the firm would increase gas production from its giant North Field, which it shares with Iran, by 20 percent after new gas development. In April, Qatar lifted a self-imposed ban on development of the North Field, the world's biggest natural gas field, and announced a new project to develop its southern section, increasing output in five to seven years. [nL5N1HB1RQ]

That new project will raise Qatar's total LNG production capacity by 30 percent to 100 million tonnes from 77 million tonnes per year, CEO Saad al-Kaabi told a news conference.

"Once completed...this project will raise the production of the State of Qatar to about 6 million barrels of oil equivalent per day," Kaabi said.

With such low production costs and LNG facilities closer to buyers in Europe and Asia, the Qatari move means U.S. producers could struggle to sell their LNG competitively and projects still needing finance could struggle to find investors. So far only Cheniere exports U.S. LNG, but there are project proposals with a total capacity of some 150 million tonnes/year.

Energy sales have driven Qatar's rapid rise as a regional player, with vast infrastructure projects and widening diplomatic influence as well as a role in the Syrian conflict that is viewed with suspicion by Gulf neighbours. German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel said in Jeddah the stand-off between Qatar and its Arab neighbours would best be solved by an agreement across the region to prevent the financing of terrorism,

"We all know that (this support) is not organised by states, but often by private persons," he added. "But we must somehow succeed in ending support in the region for extremist and terrorist organisations."

IRANIAN QUESTION

The glut has already driven down prices. Asian spot LNG prices LNG-AS have fallen more than 40 percent this year to $5.50 per mmBtu and by 70 percent from peaks in 2014.

So far, the majority of LNG is supplied via long-term contracts between producers and users which allow little flexibility and in many cases also prevent importers from reselling cargoes. With supplies far outpacing demand, analysts expect more and more LNG to be freely traded.

Many producers have already started to offer contracts without resale or destination restrictions. [nL3N1J9338]

The political dispute started on June 5, roiling LNG trade and causing at least one tanker to change course and UK gas prices to spike. [nL1N1J51YY]

Kaabi said the company's operations would not be affected by the diplomatic crisis or sanctions.

"Qatar Petroleum will continue working...If some companies decide they don't want to work with QP that's their choice. We will find other foreign companies to work with," he said.

Analysts said the move to boost production was partly to do with added competition in the LNG market, mainly from Ausralia, the United States and Russia.

"It is also to do with Iran now set to increase production on the South Pars field, which means they can up production from their side of the field (North Field) without destabilizing the geology of the field," said Oliver Sanderson, gas analyst at Thomson Reuters.

Some experts say that, while the Gulf States accus Qatar of cooperating too closely with Iran, their sanctions could push it to cooperate with Tehran more on the gas production and exports from the shared field.

"Qatar needs the support of Iran now more than any time before. I don't believe it would be possible for Qatar to increase production without the cooperation with Iran, if in the long term the (political) situation stayed same as now," said Reza Mostafavi Tabatabaei, president of London-based ENEXD, a firm involved in oil and gas equipment in the Middle East.

"Also, major (oil) companies may be asked to choose between working in Qatar or Saudi/UAE and Egypt, otherwise there be sanctions against them. That's why I don't think that developing this project by Qatar now will be as easy as before, politically not financially," he added.

Qatar Petroleum's Kaabi said there is no cooperation with Iran on any project in the North Field, but the countries have a joint committee that meets every year to discuss development of the field.

He added that the company will be looking for international partners, declining to say when a tender would be issued.

Qatargas, the largest LNG-producing company in the world, and RasGas also operate projects on the North Field.

While QP owns a majority stake, energy firms including Total, Mitsui & Co <8031.T> and ConocoPhillips also possess small stakeholdings. RasGas is a 70/30 percent joint venture between QP and Exxon Mobil .

"Qatar has one of the lowest LNG production costs in the world. It has followed an astute policy of maximizing value from market prices around the world," said Ajay Singh, special advisor at Japan Petroleum Exploration Co and former gas executive at Shell. "For Qatar, LNG is everything."

RPT-WRAPUP 1-Qatar raises gas capacity amid Gulf dispute - 路透新闻

{{20170704T141426.363+0000}}RPT-WRAPUP 1-Qatar raises gas capacity amid Gulf dispute(Repeats to wider codes)

July 4 (Reuters) - Qatar announced on Tuesday it planned to raise liquefied natural gas (LNG) capacity by 30 percent in an apparent show of strength in its dispute with Gulf neighbours who have imposed political and economic sanctions on Doha.

The unexpected move came as Qatar appears to be preparing itself for greater economic independence should the dispute with Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Bahrain become protracted. Its immediate effect will be to worsen a glut on the LNG market where Australia, the United States and Russia vie.

The Gulf states and Egypt have severed diplomatic and transport ties with Doha, accusing it of supporting terrorism and courting regional rival Iran. Qatar denies the accusation.

The Arab states, who have presented Doha with a list of demands, meet on Wednesday to discuss how to end the crisis; or they could impose more sanctions, which may include asking trade partners to pick a side in the rift.

Qatar Petroleum's [QATPE.UL] chief executive said the firm would increase gas production from its giant North Field, which it shares with Iran, by 20 percent after new gas development. In April, Qatar lifted a self-imposed ban on development of the North Field, the world's biggest natural gas field, and announced a new project to develop its southern section, increasing output in five to seven years. [nL5N1HB1RQ]

That new project will raise Qatar's total LNG production capacity by 30 percent to 100 million tonnes from 77 million tonnes per year, CEO Saad al-Kaabi told a news conference.

"Once completed...this project will raise the production of the State of Qatar to about 6 million barrels of oil equivalent per day," Kaabi said.

With such low production costs and LNG facilities closer to buyers in Europe and Asia, the Qatari move means U.S. producers could struggle to sell their LNG competitively and projects still needing finance could struggle to find investors. So far only Cheniere exports U.S. LNG, but there are project proposals with a total capacity of some 150 million tonnes/year.

Energy sales have driven Qatar's rapid rise as a regional player, with vast infrastructure projects and widening diplomatic influence as well as a role in the Syrian conflict that is viewed with suspicion by Gulf neighbours.

UPDATE 2-Train derailment spills 20,000 gallons of Exxon's oil in Illinois  - 路透新闻

{{20170703T180935.566+0000}}UPDATE 2-Train derailment spills 20,000 gallons of Exxon's oil in Illinois (Updates with Exxon and Canadian National Railway statements)

July 3 (Reuters) - About 20,000 gallons (76,000 liters) of crude oil belonging to Exxon Mobil Corp was released after a Canadian National Railway Co freight train derailed on Friday at Plainfield, Illinois.

The cause of the derailment was unknown, a filing with the Illinois Emergency Management Agency said on Saturday.

Twenty cars of the south-bound Canadian National train carrying crude oil were involved in the derailment, while three of the cars leaked, CN spokesman Patrick Waldron said.

There were no injuries, fire or threat to public safety, Waldron said, adding the track has been repaired and trains have resumed operating through the area.

Environmental clean-up work is underway at the site of derailment and the investigation into the cause of the accident would continue into this week, he said.

Canadian National Railway says oil spills after train derails in U.S. - 路透新闻

{{20170703T090221.880+0000}}Canadian National Railway says oil spills after train derails in U.S.July 3 (Reuters) - Canadian National Railway Co said about 20,000 gallons of oil was released following a freight train derailment at Plainfield, the U.S. state of Illinois on Friday, according to a filing with state pollution regulators.

The cause of the derailment was unknown, a filing with the Illinois Emergency Management Agency said on Saturday.

Local media reports estimated the spill to be 45,000 gallons.

The incident occurred when 20 cars of a Canadian National Railway Co freight train, carrying crude for Exxon Mobil Corp to Louisiana, went off the tracks, the Chicago Tribune said in a report on Saturday, quoting officials.

"No one was injured in the derailment. Officials confirmed that oil leaked from two of the cars on the Canadian National freight train, and a possible third car was leaking oil," the report added. (Source: http://trib.in/2uAFObw)

According to a report on the news website of Northwest Herald, most of the derailed cars were cleared by Saturday and the rest were expected to be removed from the site by Sunday.

Cleanup operations of the spilled crude was expected to take a few days, the report said. (Source: http://bit.ly/2t846vY)

IT- und Internet-Konzerne dominieren die Börsen der Welt - 路透新闻

{{20170701T123507.927+0000}}IT- und Internet-Konzerne dominieren die Börsen der WeltFrankfurt, 01. Jul (Reuters) - Der Siegeszug der IT- und Internet-Wirtschaft an den Börsen hat einen Höhepunkt erreicht. Die fünf wertvollsten börsennotierten Unternehmen kamen Ende Juni aus der digitalen Welt, wie die Unternehmensberatung EY errechnet hat. Apple führt mit einer Marktkapitalisierung von 751 Milliarden Dollar die Rangliste weiter vor der Google-Holding Alphabet (636 Milliarden) an. Hinter Microsoft (532 Milliarden) auf Platz drei belegen erstmals der Online-Händler Amazon.com (463 Milliarden) und Facebook(438 Milliarden) die Ränge vier und fünf. Sie verdrängten Warren Buffetts Investmentholding von Berkshire Hathaway und den Ölriesen Exxon Mobil, der vom fünften auf den neunten Platz zurückgefallen ist.

"Die Auswirkungen der Digitalisierung werden immer stärker sichtbar und erfassen immer mehr Branchen und Lebensbereiche", erklärte EY-Deutschland-Chef Hubert Barth am Samstag. "Wir erleben eine fundamentale Umwälzung, die angetrieben wird von innovativen und zunehmend auch hoch profitablen Technologiekonzernen."

Stellten die USA vor einem halben Jahr noch die kompletten Top Ten der Börsen-Schwergewichte, sind nun zwei chinesische Unternehmen in die Phalanx eingebrochen - und auch sie kommen aus der Digitalbranche: die Internet-Händler Alibaba und Tencent<0700.HK> auf den Rängen sieben und zehn. Ende 2016 hatten sie noch auf den Plätzen 19 und 13 gelegen, seither sind ihre Börsenwerte um 62 beziehungsweise 46 Prozent nach oben geschnellt. Zum Vergleich: Die Marktkapitalisierung des iPhone-Herstellers Apple stieg seit Jahresbeginn um knapp 22 Prozent, die von Alphabet um 18 Prozent.

SAP IST WERTVOLLSTES DEUTSCHES UNTERNEHMEN

Unter den 300 teuersten Unternehmen der Welt zählt EY 36 IT-Konzerne - doch nur drei davon kommen aus Europa. Das könne zum Problem werden. "Die Digitalisierung schreitet in großen Schritten voran - und derzeit werden die Regeln in erster Linie von amerikanischen und asiatischen IT-Konzernen gemacht", betonte Barth. Das wertvollste europäische Unternehmen ist auf Platz 13 der Schweizer Nahrungsmittelgigant Nestle mit 272 Milliarden Dollar.

Erst auf Platz 56 weltweit folgt mit dem Softwareriesen SAP (126 Milliarden Dollar) die Nummer eins in Deutschland. Unter den Top 100 finden sich mit SAP, Siemens (Platz 68) Bayer (70) und nun auch der Allianz (93) vier börsennotierte deutsche Konzerne, Ende 2016 waren es noch sechs. BASF, die Deutsche Telekom und Daimler fielen zurück.

Insgesamt finden sich 23 europäische Unternehmen unter den 100 wertvollsten, 52 kommen aus den USA. "Europa ist stärker, als es das Börsenranking suggeriert", erklärte Barth. Der Kontinent habe eine industrielle Basis, die man etwa in den USA vergeblich suche. Auch in einer digitalisierten Welt würden produzierende Hightech-Unternehmen gebraucht.

UPDATE 3-U.S. warns businesses of hacking campaign against nuclear, energy firms - 路透新闻

{{20170701T032855.821+0000}}UPDATE 3-U.S. warns businesses of hacking campaign against nuclear, energy firms(Adds comments from nuclear power generators)

By Jim Finkle

TORONTO, June 30 (Reuters) - The U.S government warned industrial firms this week about a hacking campaign targeting the nuclear and energy sectors, the latest event to highlight the power industry's vulnerability to cyber attacks.

Since at least May, hackers used tainted "phishing" emails to "harvest credentials" so they could gain access to networks of their targets, according to a joint report from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and Federal Bureau of Investigation.

The report provided to the industrial firms was reviewed by Reuters on Friday. While disclosing attacks, and warning that in some cases hackers succeeded in compromising the networks of their targets, it did not identify any specific victims.

"Historically, cyber actors have strategically targeted the energy sector with various goals ranging from cyber espionage to the ability to disrupt energy systems in the event of a hostile conflict," the report said.

Homeland Security and FBI officials could not be reached for comment on the report, which was dated June 28.

The report was released during a week of heavy hacking activity.

A virus dubbed "NotPetya" attacked on Tuesday, spreading from initial infections in Ukraine to businesses around the globe. It encrypted data on infected machines, rendering them inoperable and disrupting activity at ports, law firms and factories. [L8N1JP55N]

On Tuesday the energy-industry news site E&E News reported that U.S. investigators were looking into cyber intrusions this year at multiple nuclear power generators.

Reuters has not confirmed details of the E&E News report, which said there was no evidence safety systems had been compromised at affected plants.

The activity described in the U.S. government report comes at a time when industrial firms are particularly anxious about threat that hackers pose to their operations.

Industrial firms, including power providers and other utilities, have been particularly worried about the potential for destructive cyber attacks since December 2016, when hackers cut electricity in Ukraine.

U.S. nuclear power generators PSEG , SCANA Corp and Entergy Corp said they were not impacted by the recent cyber attacks. SCANA's V.C. Summer nuclear plant in South Carolina shut down on Thursday due to a problem with a valve in the non-nuclear portion of the plant, a spokesman said.

Another nuclear power generator, Dominion Energy , said it does not comment on cyber security.

Two cyber security firms said on June 12 that they had identified the malicious software used in the Ukraine attack, which they dubbed Industroyer, warning that it could be easily modified to attack utilities in the United States and Europe. [L1N1J90J8]

Industroyer is only the second piece of malware uncovered to date that is capable of disrupting industrial processes without the need for hackers to manually intervene.

The first, Stuxnet, was discovered in 2010 and is widely believed by security researchers to have been used by the United States and Israel to attack Iran's nuclear program.

The U.S. government report said attackers conducted reconnaissance to gain information about the individuals whose computers they sought to infect so that they create "decoy documents" on topics of interest to their targets.

In an analysis, it described 11 files used in the attacks, including malware downloaders and tools that allow the hackers to take remote control of victim's computers and travel across their networks.

Chevron Corp , Exxon Mobil Corp and ConocoPhillips , the three largest U.S. oil producers, declined to comment on their network security.

REFILE-Brussels ponders deadly smoke after Grenfell Tower blaze - 路透新闻

{{20170630T144539.082+0000}}REFILE-Brussels ponders deadly smoke after Grenfell Tower blaze(Refiles to clarify breakdown of smoke-related deaths in paragraph 19)

* Draft report says no case for EU-wide rules on smoke

* European Commission says cannot confirm publication date

* Report was debated at meeting in May

By Barbara Lewis and Julia Fioretti

LONDON/BRUSSELS, June 29 (Reuters) - EU policymakers are unlikely to agree to Europe-wide rules on toxic smoke from burning building materials despite years of lobbying from fire fighters and safety experts, according to a draft report ordered by the region's executive seen by Reuters.

The debate has been going on in Brussels for at least four years, but this month's deadly fire at the Grenfell Tower apartment block in London has highlighted a lack of fire safety regulations across the 28-member bloc.

Officials at the European Commission, the European Union's executive, were already studying the draft version of a report on whether new smoke regulations for construction materials are needed before the June 14 blaze that killed at least 80 people.

The draft, dated May, was based on around 50 interviews with regulators, industry groups and fire services, led by BRE, a British-based organisation that carries out research and testing in the building sector.

It found that there "would be limited benefits from regulating for the toxicity of smoke from construction products" and that member states should continue to decide individually whether specific rules are necessary.

It also concluded that "regulation would increase barriers to trade, increase product costs and potentially remove some products from the market".

A final version should be ready by July 17, the draft said, although the Commission said it could not confirm that date.

The Commission had asked for the report to help resolve an argument between fire safety campaigners and the plastics industry.

"Member States are free to set their own requirements for building design and safety," a Commission spokeswoman said, when asked about the report and the possibility of new regulation.

Trade body Plastics Europe says there is no evidence new rules on the toxicity of smoke from building materials would save lives. But firefighters and other safety campaigners say labelling products according to their toxicity when burned is one simple way to address a lack of clear fire safety regulations for builders in the EU.

EU officials, fire safety and industry representatives debated the draft report in Brussels on May 16.

Among those present was Richard Hull, a professor of fire science at the University of Central Lancashire in England.

"If I go to my laboratory and I develop a new insulation material which is excellent in many respects but is lethally toxic when it burns, there's no restriction on me selling that as a building product," he said.

Plastics Europe, which represents companies such as ExxonMobil , Total and BASF , said new regulations would not be useful because there are multiple factors to consider when assessing the safety of a building.

"A smoke toxicity criterion for construction products will not per se guarantee more safety in the eventuality of a fire," Plastics Europe said.

Presently, the EU only sets standards to ensure construction materials can be shipped across borders within the bloc, although EU sources said the Commission had decided long before the Grenfell fire to draw up new rules to harmonise fire-safety tests for building facades.

Police investigating the cause of London's most deadly fire since World War Two have said it started in a faulty fridge and spread rapidly because of external cladding on the 24-storey building. The cladding used has since failed safety checks and prompted a review of the materials used on British buildings ranging from hospitals to hotels to apartment blocks. [nL8N1JL04P][nL8N1JP35L]

Hull said the use of more synthetic materials in construction has made smoke more toxic, with insulation products such as polyisocyanurate (PIR) producing high yields of hydrogen cyanide and carbon monoxide when burned.

Pressure group Fire Safe Europe says around 40 percent of deaths in fires are caused directly by smoke, while a further 20 percent are caused by a combination of severe burns and smoke.

The body brings together fire fighters, representatives of the concrete and cable industries, and equipment and insulation companies including Danish-listed Rockwool and Germany's Knauf Insulation.

"Smoke is playing a crucial role in modern fire behaviour. said Brussels firefighter Pieter Maes, who attended the May meeting. "We need to take it into account in our testing of materials, to understand how smoke production from a certain material can influence how fire spreads."

Czech Member of the European Parliament Pavel Poc told Reuters his Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats group would push the Commission for specific rules on smoke.

"Testing and labelling could give the consumers the chance to choose between more or less toxic materials," he said.
