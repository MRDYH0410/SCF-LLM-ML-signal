{{20170301T100634.567+0000}}UK union fears for jobs at Ford's Welsh engine plant LONDON, March 1 (Reuters) - Britain's biggest trade union fears that more than 1,000 jobs could be lost at Ford's engine plant in Wales despite reassurances from the U.S. carmaker that similar levels of employment will be needed in the coming years.

Ford, Britain's biggest engine builder, said last year it was scaling back investment due to lower than anticipated demand for one of its petrol engines, prompting the Unite union to call on the firm to provide a plan for how it would maintain output.

"It is our belief that... there is no future business plan for the plant, that our concerns are going to be realised, that two thirds of the plant, that's at least 1,160 jobs will be at risk," Andy Richards, Unite's Welsh Secretary told the BBC.

A spokesman at Ford told Reuters that the firm, which made around one third of Britain's total output of 2.4 million engines at Bridgend in 2015, was not planning significant cuts.

"The anticipated production volume of engines from Bridgend remains healthy in the upcoming years, with associated labour requirements expected to be similar to today's level," he said.

A meeting is due to take place on Wednesday between Ford and the unions, Richards told the BBC.

UPDATE 1-German automakers top U.S. magazine brand rankings - 路透新闻

{{20170301T010815.657+0000}}UPDATE 1-German automakers top U.S. magazine brand rankings(Adds Fiat Chrysler reaction)

By David Shepardson

WASHINGTON, Feb 28 (Reuters) - German automakers dominated
Consumer Reports' annual ranking of automotive brands released
on Tuesday, with Volkswagen AG's  Audi 
leading the pack, while U.S. brands continued to lag despite
gains for many.

Jake Fisher, director of auto testing at the magazine, said
German automakers rose largely due to improvements in
reliability. "Building one or two great vehicles is achievable,
but making a whole lineup of excellent ones is much more
difficult," Fisher said.

Volkswagen's Porsche unit and rival BMW AG  came in
second and third. General Motors Co's  Buick brand was the
highest-ranked U.S. mainstream brand in 10th, down from seventh
in 2016, while Ford Motor Co's namesake brand fell from 16th to
21th.

GM's Chevrolet brand moved up to 17th from 20th and its
Cadillac brand moved up to 18th from 24th.

Toyota Motor Corp's <7203.T> flagship brand fell from eighth
to 11th place, falling out of the top 10 for the first time in
recent years, after the magazine said its Tacoma pickup had
reliability issues.

Tesla Inc  was ranked eighth among auto brands after
previously not having enough models to be ranked.

Fiat Chrysler Automobiles'  Chrysler brand jumped
from 26th to 19th.

GM's Chevrolet Cruze was named best compact car, while its
Impala won best large sedan.

Other top picks included the Honda Ridgeline as best compact
pickup, Kia Optima best midsized sedan and Audi Q7 best luxury
SUV.

The Fiat brand remained last again among all brands rated,
and FCA's Jeep brand remained second-lowest overall. Consumer
Reports does not recommend any Fiat Chrysler vehicles, while it
recommends all Porsche, Mazda and BMW vehicles.

Fiat Chrysler said in a statement it welcomed feedback from
Consumer Reports "as it helps guide our product improvements."
The company added it is "aggressively pursuing both product and
launch-quality improvements."

Fisher said Fiat Chrysler models suffered from serious
reliability problems.

Brand           2017 rank             2016 rank
 Audi            1                     1

CORRECTED-COLUMN-Will Takata plea deal kill civil suits against automakers?: Frankel - 路透新闻

{{20170228T204238.985+0000}}CORRECTED-COLUMN-Will Takata plea deal kill civil suits against automakers?: Frankel(Corrects the figure in graf 7 from 8 million to 8 billion)

By Alison Frankel

NEW YORK, Feb 28 (Reuters) - Late this afternoon, the automakers Honda, Ford, Toyota, Nissan, Mazda and BMW will head to federal court in Miami to argue that a $1 billion plea agreement between the U.S. Justice Department and the airbag maker Takata Corporation should absolve them from liability for installing dangerous Takata airbags in tens of millions of cars sold in the U.S.

Takata admitted as part of the plea that it reported incorrect airbag test results to carmakers. So according to the automakers, they are properly viewed as victims of Takata's admittedly fraudulent scheme – not as perpetrators of their own deception of car buyers.

As my colleague Joe White has reported, Takata has agreed to set up an $850 million fund to compensate automakers for the cost of replacing recalled airbags. [nL2N1GC1E1]

Owners of the cars, who are suing the automakers for economic damages in consolidated litigation, have a rather different view of the implications of Takata's guilty plea, which was approved Monday by U.S. District Judge George Steeh of Detroit. Their lawyers, led by Peter Prieto of Podhurst Orseck, claim to have plenty of evidence that carmakers were independently aware of problems with Takata's airbags.

Takata's guilty plea, car owners argued in a status report filed Monday with U.S. District Judge Federico Moreno of Miami, proves nothing at all about what the carmakers themselves knew about flaws in the airbags, which were installed even after car owners began reporting dangerous ruptures.

"Despite this knowledge, the automotive defendants continued to equip their vehicles with Takata's ticking time bombs and misrepresent to the unsuspecting public that their vehicles were safe," car owners said in the status report.

BILLIONS AT STAKE

The dispute over the automakers' liability could be worth hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars. In addition to the cost of replacing faulty airbags – which could be nearly $8 billion, according to the judge who approved Takata's guilty plea - car owners contend Honda, Ford and the other carmakers owe them damages because car buyers overpaid for defective vehicles that have diminished in value.

Car owners also claimed in their latest consolidated complaint that they deserve punitive damages from automakers.

The automakers said in their status report to Miami judge Morena that Takata's admissions in its agreement with the Justice Department undermine car owners' claims for economic losses.

"The plea agreement confirms, among other things, that Takata engaged in a fraudulent scheme to keep the automotive defendants from knowing what Takata knew about the inflators and their potential to rupture," the carmakers said in a status report filed last week.

"Even before Takata's admission of guilt, plaintiffs had no way to prove they suffered actual economic loss, as the automotive defendants are offering, and will continue to offer, free replacements of recalled Takata inflators. In short, Takata's guilty plea makes the theory of plaintiffs' case even more implausible than it already was."

Plaintiffs' lawyers said in their retort Monday that Honda and the other carmakers had overstated the impact of the Takata plea deal, which, "neither excuses the automotive defendants' own reckless, deceptive conduct nor undermines the economic loss claims asserted against them."

The filing accused carmakers of opting to use Takata airbags to save time and money. In a response issued late Monday, Honda called the allegation that cost considerations led it to use a dangerous product "categorically false," adding that Takata's airbag components were not even consistently priced lower than those of competitors. (Honda also reiterated that Takata's guilty plea belies car owners' economic loss claims.)

"LIMITED" IMPACT?

Takata and its U.S. subsidiary, TK Holdings, meanwhile, argued in their status report to Judge Moreno that the parent corporation's admissions in its plea deal with the government should have "limited (if any) impact" on car owners' economic loss claims in the consolidated civil litigation.

As part of the plea deal, Takata agreed to establish a $125 million restitution fund for plaintiffs who were injured by defective airbags. Those claims are consolidated on a separate tracks from the economic loss claims.

Plaintiffs' lawyers in the civil litigation had theorized in a pair of filings Monday before the Detroit judge overseeing the Takata criminal case that the parent corporation would try to use the plea agreement to shield its U.S. subsidiary from liability for car owners' economic losses. Instead, Takata and its subsidiary urged Judge Moreno to dismiss economic loss claims against both of them.

At the moment, both sides' jockeying over the impact of the plea agreement is just posturing. All of the defendants have moved to dismiss the latest complaint by car owners. Those motions, which preceded the Takata plea deal, are pending before Judge Moreno. It's not clear, in other words, whether the judge will even consider Takata's admissions in deciding whether to keep the economic loss cases alive.

If plaintiffs survive dismissal motions, the automaker defendants may well ask the judge to grant them summary judgment based on Takata's guilty plea. Lead counsel Prieto seems to be already primed to respond.

"What the automakers knew and when they knew it is an issue of fact," he told me. "It's for the jury to decide."

German automakers top U.S. magazine brand rankings - 路透新闻

WASHINGTON, Feb 28 (Reuters) - German automakers dominated Consumer Reports' annual ranking of automotive brands released on Tuesday, with Volkswagen AG's Audi leading the pack, while U.S. brands continued to lag despite gains for many.

Jake Fisher, director of auto testing at the magazine, said German automakers rose largely due to improvements in reliability. "Building one or two great vehicles is achievable, but making a whole lineup of excellent ones is much more difficult," Fisher said.

Volkswagen's Porsche unit and rival BMW AG came in second and third. General Motors Co's Buick brand was the highest-ranked U.S. brand in 10th, down from seventh in 2016, while Ford Motor Co's Lincoln brand was 15th, up from 17th. The Ford brand fell from 16th to 21th.

GM's Chevrolet brand moved up to 17th from 20th and its Cadillac brand moved up to 18th from 24th.

Toyota Motor Corp's <7203.T> flagship brand fell from eighth to 11th place, falling out of the top 10 for the first time in recent years, after the magazine said its Tacoma pickup had reliability issues. Toyota's luxury Lexus unit fell from third to fourth.

Fuji Heavy Industries' <7270.T> Subaru unit fell from second to fifth, while Korean auto brand Kia jumped to sixth, up five spots, followed by Mazda Motor Corp <7261.T> in seventh.

Tesla Inc was ranked eighth among auto brands after previously not having enough models to be ranked. The California automaker was followed by Honda Motor Co's <7267.T> namesake brand in ninth.

Fiat Chrysler Automobiles' Chrysler brand jumped from 26th to 19th.

GM's Chevrolet Cruze was named best compact car, while its Impala won best large sedan.

Other top picks included the Honda Ridgeline as best compact pickup, Kia Optima best midsized sedan and Audi Q7 best luxury SUV.

Nissan Motor Co's <7201.T> luxury Infiniti brand moved up six spots to 16, while its Nissan brand fell one spot to 22.

Some German automakers struggled. The Volkswagen brand fell eight spots to 23rd and Daimler's Mercedes-Benz fell six spots to 20th.

The Fiat brand remained last again among all brands rated, and FCA's Jeep brand remained second-lowest overall. Consumer Reports does not recommend any Fiat Chrysler vehicles, while it recommends all Porsche, Mazda and BMW vehicles.

Fisher said Fiat Chrysler models suffered from serious reliability problems and are "not competitive" in most segments. The non-profit magazine has more than 8 million subscribers and surveys hundreds of thousands of car owners. Many shoppers consult the ratings, and automakers routinely tout favorable ratings in advertising.

UPDATE 1-Automakers urge new EPA chief to withdraw Obama car fuel-efficiency rules - 路透新闻

{{20170222T023652.635+0000}}UPDATE 1-Automakers urge new EPA chief to withdraw Obama car fuel-efficiency rules(Adds separate auto trade group filing formal petition)

By David Shepardson

WASHINGTON, Feb 21 (Reuters) - A trade association representing General Motors Co , Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T>, Volkswagen AG and nine other automakers on Tuesday asked new Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt to withdraw an Obama administration decision to lock in vehicle emission rules through 2025.

On Jan. 13, then-EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy finalized a determination that landmark fuel efficiency rules instituted by President Barack Obama should be finalized through 2025, a bid to maintain a key part of his administration's climate legacy.

Mitch Bainwol, president and chief executive of the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, said in a letter to Pruitt the decision was "the product of egregious procedural and substantive defects" and is "riddled with indefensible assumptions, inadequate analysis and a failure to engage with contrary evidence."

Automakers have argued that the rules could result in the loss of up to 1 million jobs because consumers could be less willing to buy the more fuel efficient vehicles since their engineering will result in higher price tags.

The EPA had until April 2018 to decide whether the 2025 standards were feasible but in November moved up its decision to Jan. 13, just before Obama left office.

Separately, the Association of Global Automakers, a trade group representing Honda Motor Co <7267.T>, Nissan Motor Co Ltd <7201.T>, Hyundai Motor Co <005380.KS> and others, said late Tuesday it had formally petitioned the EPA to withdraw the determination. The group argued in a separate letter to Pruitt Tuesday reviewed by Reuters that "EPA opted for political expediency" and "jammed through a final determination in the waning days of the lame-duck administration."

EPA spokeswoman Julia Valentine said the agency is reviewing the letter and declined to comment further. Pruitt told a Senate panel earlier he will review the Obama administration's decision.

The auto group requests follow a separate letter to President Donald Trump earlier this month from the chief executives of GM, Ford Motor Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV, along with the top North American executives at Toyota, VW, Honda, Hyundai, Nissan and others urging Trump to revisit the decision.

Automakers say the rules impose significant costs and are out of step with consumer preferences. Environmentalists say the rules are working, saving drivers thousands in fuel costs and should not be changed.

In 2011, Obama announced an agreement with automakers to raise fuel efficiency standards to 54.5 miles per gallon. This, the administration said, would save motorists $1.7 trillion in fuel costs over the life of the vehicles but cost the auto industry about $200 billion over 13 years.

The EPA said in July that because Americans were buying fewer cars and more SUVs and trucks, it estimated the fleet will average 50.8 mpg to 52.6 mpg in 2025.

McCarthy could not be reached Tuesday but said in her determination in January the rules are "feasible, practical and appropriate" and in "the best interests of the auto industry."

UPDATE 2-Daimler to start making Mercedez-Benz cars in Russia - 路透新闻

{{20170221T170430.593+0000}}UPDATE 2-Daimler to start making Mercedez-Benz cars in Russia* Plant will be Daimler's first car production in Russia

* First new project by Western auto firm since sanctions

* Tentative signs Russia auto market has turned corner

* Investment is worth more than 250 mln euros

(Updates with details on Russian auto market)

By Gleb Stolyarov and Edward Taylor

MOSCOW/FRANKFURT, Feb 21 (Reuters) - German automaker Daimler will open a plant near Moscow to make Mercedes-Benz cars, it announced on Tuesday, the first new investment by a major Western automaker since sanctions were imposed on Russia three years ago.

The plant will be Daimler's first to produce passenger vehicles in Russia. The firm said it would invest more than 250 million euros ($260 million) in the facility, and the first cars will leave the assembly line in 2019. [nR4N1G1016]

Daimler's investment follows the emergence of tentative signs of a recovery in the Russian car market, with Ford the first major foreign carmaker to see sales in Russia grow following three lean years. [ID:nL8N1G53HB]

Russia's Trade and Industry Ministry said in a statement that the Daimler plant will produce more than 20,000 Mercedes-Benz passenger cars and SUVS per year under an agreement that will run for nine years.

"Russia is of strategic importance for Mercedes-Benz and an attractive growth market," Markus Schäfer, Member of the Divisional Board of Mercedes-Benz Cars, Production and Supply Chain Management, said in a statement.

Russia had long been seen by major global automakers as a growth prospect that was once tipped to overtake Germany as Europe's biggest auto market.

However, new projects were put on hold in 2014, when the conflict in Ukraine and resulting international sanctions coincided with a sharp slump in the Russian economy.

Sanctions did not forbid investments in the auto sector, but caused a general chill in investor sentiment, and also threw up practical complications because financial transactions had to be restructured to avoid banks subject to sanctions.

General Motors pulled out of Russia two years ago. Auto sales overall have more than halved from a 2012 peak of almost 3 million a year. Mercedes last year sold 36,888 passenger vehicles, a drop of 11 percent year on year, according to the Association of European Business (AEB), a lobby group which tracks sales.

However, a slide in the value of Russia's rouble currency has also reduced automakers' local production costs, and in the past few months some producers have seen the decline in their sales slow as consumers start visiting showrooms again.

The Russian car market will finally stabilize this year and grow by 4 percent, AEB forecasts.

Daimler already builds trucks in central Russia in partnership with local manufacturer Kamaz, but until now has not had any passenger vehicle manufacturing in Russia.

The decision to build the new factory shows a global automaker has "faith in the Russian market, regardless of short-term circumstances", Alexander Morozov, Russia's deputy minister for trade and industry, was quoted as saying in a statement.

"It is a sign of the obvious attractiveness of Russia's auto industry to investors," Morozov said. ($1 = 57.6647 roubles)

* Ford's sales in Russia up 10 pct last year, beating rivals

* Russian market seen growing in 2017 after 4-year decline

* Ford sales now seen at 60,000 a year by 2020 - IHS

* U.S. rival General Motors quit Russia in 2015

By Jack Stubbs and Gleb Stolyarov

MOSCOW, Feb 19 (Reuters) - Ford has become the first major foreign carmaker in Russia to see sales grow after three bad years, potentially vindicating its decision to double down on a notoriously volatile market when rivals decided to cut and run.

Sales of cars in Russia have fallen by more than half since a 2012 peak of 2.9 million vehicles, due to an economic crisis brought on by low oil prices and Western sanctions. The market fell by 11 percent last year, and was down a further 5 percent in January from a year earlier.

Ford's big U.S. rival General Motors pulled out of Russia two years ago. But Ford chose not only to stay, but to keep investing, launching new models with modifications designed to suit the country's harsh driving conditions.

Since 2011, its joint venture with Sollers , a Russian partner, has ploughed $1.5 billion into making cars locally to local specifications.

Now Ford's sales have turned a corner and rose 10 percent last year, an achievement the company says is proof its strategy is at last paying off.

The 40,000 Fords sold in Russia last year are still barely more than a fifth of the almost 190,000 vehicles the company sold in 2008, before the global financial crisis brought the first of two collapses in the Russian car industry in less than a decade.

During the latest crisis, Ford's share of the market for foreign cars fell at the expense of Korean competitors Kia <000270.KS> and Hyundai <005380.KS>, which chose to shore up market share through aggressive pricing. But now their sales are still falling, while Ford's are on the rise.

The Russian market is "starting to turn", Ford CEO Mark Fields told Reuters last week, promising to stand by the company's investments in Russia. "Our intent is to build on that."

The Association of European Businesses lobby group forecasts the Russian car market to finally stabilise this year and grow by 4 percent. But it will still be years before a full rebound.

"Despite the economic turbulence, we didn't cut investments and delivered the initial plan to launch seven new vehicles with a significant level of localisation," Mark Ovenden, CEO of the Ford Sollers joint venture, told Reuters.

He noted that the company opened a $275 million engine plant in 2015, a year in which Ford's Russia sales nosedived 41 percent. The joint venture now operates four plants in Russia.

New models, such as the Fiesta hatchback and EcoSport SUV, have been adapted for Russian conditions of bad roads and extreme cold, with higher ground clearance, anti-corrosion finishes and engines adapted for lower grade fuel, Ovenden said.

Ford would not say when it thinks its Russian operations will earn money. A spokeswoman declined to comment on profitability in Russia, saying Ford does not break down its European operations by individual market.

Vladimir Bespalov, an analyst at Russia's VTB bank, said Ford's Russian operations were still loss-making but could be profitable as soon as 2018.

IHS analysts predict Ford's sales in Russia could rise to 60,000 vehicles by 2020. "But it's going to be a long, slow build up," said Tim Urquhart, principal analyst at IHS Automotive.

Even at such small numbers, sales growth in Russia would mark a bright spot for Ford's European operations after it warned last month that the impact of Britain's vote to leave the EU would put a $600 million dent in its 2017 earnings. [nL5N1FH4XV]

"POINT OF NO RETURN"

Russia has been one of the great dream markets for carmakers since the automobile was invented.

Ford first entered Russia in 1907 under the reign of Tsar Nicholas II, but foreign automakers were shut out during the Soviet era when Moscow built its own industry. Well into the 2000s, the market was still dominated by boxy Ladas built on a design licensed by the Soviets from Fiat in the 1960s, leaving huge pent-up demand for more comfortable and reliable models.

A decade after the Soviet Union fell, Ford opened Russia's first foreign car plant in St Petersburg in 2002. By the time of its sales peak in 2008, some Russian automotive experts predicted the Ford Focus could become Russia's new national car.

Although that ambition now seems far off, the decision to invest so heavily in building cars locally was one reason Ford decided to stay when GM left, said Bespalov.

"Ford passed the point of no return in terms of investment," he said. "Ford and GM were in different situations. For Ford the decision to continue to invest meant fewer losses than a decision to leave. For GM, it was the other way round."

Urquhart noted that GM had also been hurt worse than Ford globally by the 2009 downturn, giving it more reason to be cautious in the years that followed.

While Ford saw sales grew last year, other foreign car companies suffered further falls, in line with the wider market.

Kia, now Russia's second-biggest seller behind domestic top producer Avtovaz , fell by 9 percent, and third-place Hyundai fell by 10 percent. France's Renault , which sunk $1 billion into an initial 25 percent stake in now struggling Avtovaz in 2008, saw sales slide 3 percent last year. Sales of Volkswagens fell 5 percent.

IHS' Urquhart said it was still unclear whether Ford's bet on Russia would pay off in the long term, but its presence in Russia would help cement its position among the world's biggest car producers.

"If you want to be a global carmaker, you've got to be in the Russian market," he said.

UPDATE 1-Chief minister wins stormy confidence vote in India's carmaking state - 路透新闻

{{20170218T141340.613+0000}}UPDATE 1-Chief minister wins stormy confidence vote in India's carmaking state(Updates with trust vote, recasts throughout)

NEW DELHI, Feb 18 (Reuters) - The chief minister of India's southern state of Tamil Nadu won a confidence vote on Sunday after a brawl in the state assembly, triggered when the speaker rejected opposition calls for a secret ballot.

Edappadi Palanisamy won the vote by 121 to 11, which followed a weeks-long power struggle set off by the death of his party leader and former chief minister, filmstar-turned-politician Jayalalithaa Jayaram.

Palanisamy was elected leader of the AIADMK party, which holds a majority in the assembly, and sworn in as chief minister on Tuesday.

The assembly speaker then called a confidence vote, which opposition group DMK petitioned to be conducted via a secret ballot, arguing this would reveal deep divisions in the ruling party.

The speaker refused to grant the request and, after the brawl then broke out, ejected DMK lawmakers from the chamber, footage from Indian broadcasters showed.

One official was injured in the scuffle and was taken out on a stretcher, TV networks said.

The state of more than 70 million people, a magnet for foreign automakers and consumer electronics firms, has been in political limbo since Jayaram died on Dec. 6 without naming a successor. [nL4N1E1378]

The subsequent political turmoil, along with rising social unrest, has raised doubts over its attractiveness as a place to do business. [nL4N1FD4AR]

Following Jayaraman's death, her companion V. K. Sasikala was appointed interim general secretary of AIADMK and then sought to take over as leader.

But that bid ended this week when the federal Supreme Court convicted her of corruption and jailed her for four years. [nL4N1FZ2W4]

Known as the "Detroit of Asia", Tamil Nadu is India's second-largest manufacturing state. It hosts manufacturers including , Daimler , Hyundai <011760.KS>, Ford , Mitsubishi <8058.T>, Nissan <7201.T> and Renault .

Before his appointment as chief minister, Palanisamy served as public works minister, and is little known outside his home state.

Brawling breaks out in "Detroit of Asia" state legislature - 路透新闻

{{20170218T093014.110+0000}}Brawling breaks out in "Detroit of Asia" state legislatureNEW DELHI, Feb 18 (Reuters) - Lawmakers broke chairs and smashed microphones in a state legislature in southern India on Saturday as a weeks-long power struggle following the death of a regional politician intensified.

One official was injured in the scuffle among lawmakers inside the Tamil Nadu state assembly and was taken out on a stretcher, TV networks said.

The power struggle in the state of more than 70 million that has attracted foreign automakers and consumer electronics firms, comes amid rising social unrest that has raised doubts over its attractiveness as a place to do business. [nL4N1FD4AR]

The state of Tamil Nadu has been in turmoil since its leader, film star turned politician Jayaraman Jalalithaa, died on Dec. 6, 2016 without naming a successor. [nL4N1E1378]

Since then her close companion Sasikala has sought to take over the mantle of leadership of the AIADMK party, but earlier this week the federal Supreme Court convicted her of corruption and jailed her for four years. [nL4N1FZ2W4]

Hecklers surrounded the speaker for refusing to allow a secret ballot which the opposition group DMK believed would show up deep cracks in the ruling party. A DMK spokesman denied that his party colleagues created the ruckus.

Known as the "Detroit of Asia", Tamil Nadu is India's second-largest manufacturing state. It hosts manufacturers such as , Daimler , Hyundai <011760.KS>, Ford , Mitsubishi <8058.T>, Nissan <7201.T> and Renault .

EXCLUSIVE-GM plans to build, test thousands of self-driving Bolts in 2018 -sources - 路透新闻

{{20170217T195740.717+0000}}EXCLUSIVE-GM plans to build, test thousands of self-driving Bolts in 2018 -sourcesBy Paul Lienert

DETROIT, Feb 17 (Reuters) - General Motors Co plans to deploy thousands of self-driving electric cars in test fleets in partnership with ride-sharing affiliate Lyft Inc, beginning in 2018, two sources familiar with the automaker's plans said this week.

It is expected to be the largest such test of fully autonomous vehicles by any major automaker before 2020, when several companies have said they plan to begin building and deploying such vehicles in higher volumes. Alphabet Inc's Waymo subsidiary, in comparison, is currently testing about 60 self-driving prototypes in four states.

Most of the specially equipped versions of the Chevrolet Bolt electric vehicle will be used by San Francisco-based Lyft, which will test them in its ride-sharing fleet in several states, one of the sources said. GM has no immediate plans to sell the Bolt AV to individual customers, according to the source.

The sources spoke only on condition of anonymity because GM has not announced its plans yet.

GM executives have said in interviews and investor presentations during the past year they intend to mass-produce autonomous vehicles and deploy them in ride services fleets. However, GM officials have not revealed details of the scale of production, or the timing of the deployment of those vehicles.

In a statement on Friday, GM said: "We do not provide specific details on potential future products or technology rollout plans. We have said that our AV technology will appear in an on-demand ride sharing network application sooner than you might think."

Lyft declined to comment.

GM's crosstown rival Ford Motor Co has said it plans to begin building its first self-driving vehicles at a suburban Detroit plant in late 2020, for deployment in on-demand ride sharing fleets in 2021. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles is providing a small number of Chrysler Pacifica minivans to Waymo, which is converting them for self-driving tests.

GM's Maven car sharing operation likely will be involved with Lyft in developing a commercial ride sharing business around self-driving vehicles such as the Bolt AV, GM executive Mike Ableson told Reuters in a November interview.

"If you assume the cost of these autonomous vehicles, the very early ones, will be six figures, there aren't very many retail customers that are willing to go out and spend that kind of money," Ableson said. "But even at that sort of cost, with a ride sharing platform, you can build a business."

Chief Executive Mary Barra in mid-December said GM would begin building a fully autonomous version of the Bolt EV in early 2017 at its Orion Township plant north of Detroit.

GM is testing about 40 Bolt AVs in San Francisco and Scottsdale, Arizona, and plans to extend testing this year to Detroit, the automaker said in December. [nL1N1E81IU]

A year ago, GM paid $500 million for a minority stake in Lyft, the second-largest U.S. ride sharing firm after Uber. [nL3N14O3VA]

Before it closed the deal, Ableson said he and GM President Dan Ammann discussed with Lyft founders Logan Green and John Zimmer the prospect of jointly developing a ride sharing business with self-driving cars.

"We walked in not wanting so much to talk about the business today, but how do we work together to develop this idea of autonomous, on-demand networks in cities," Ableson said of the initial discussions with Lyft.

To make that business successful, Ableson said, requires the ability to engineer autonomous systems, to build self-driving vehicles in volume and to deploy them in a ride sharing fleet.

"If you take those three things, no one company has all three," Ableson said.

GM in early 2016 acquired Cruise Automation, a San Francisco startup, to help it accelerate development of self-driving cars. [nL1N16J0ZN] GM also launched a car sharing business, Maven, which has provided vehicles to Lyft.

"Cruise, Lyft, Maven are all bringing different parts of this singular solution around autonomous on-demand networks in urban environments," Ableson said.

UPDATE 1-New delinquent U.S. car loans at 8-year peak -NY Fed survey - 路透新闻

{{20170216T215305.999+0000}}UPDATE 1-New delinquent U.S. car loans at 8-year peak -NY Fed survey(Recasts first paragraph, adds details from NY Fed report)

NEW YORK, Feb 16 (Reuters) - More Americans fell behind on their car loan payments in the fourth quarter, bringing auto delinquencies to their highest since the height of the financial crisis, Federal Reserve Bank of New York data released on Thursday showed.

Car loans delinquent by 30 days or more grew to $23.27 billion, the most since $23.46 billion in the third quarter of 2008. They were up from $22.98 billion in the prior quarter.

Seriously delinquent auto loans whose payments were 90 days or more past due jumped to $8.24 billion in the fourth quarter, the highest since the third quarter of 2016, according to the survey.

Delinquency is a predictor on possible losses for carmakers, which often make low interest loans to attract buyers.

Last month, Ford Motor Co's finance arm said it expected a pickup in loan losses from historically low levels following a rise in delinquencies and car possessions.

"Credit losses have been at historically low levels for quite some time, and we continue to see credit losses increase toward more normal levels," Ford Credit said in a presentation of its fourth-quarter results and 2017 outlook.

The increase in late loan payments coincided with drivers loading up on debt to buy the latest car, trunk and SUV models, fueling expectations for record auto sales in 2017. [nL1N1FH0SC]

In the fourth quarter, $142 billion in car loans were generated, giving 2016 the most auto loan originations in the 18-year history of the data, the New York Fed said.

Auto debt hit $1.16 trillion, with a $93 billion rise over the year.

The increase in car loans was part of a broader growth in household debt in the fourth quarter which almost hit an all-time high in the fourth quarter, reaching $12.58 trillion, according to the survey.

Total debt was up $460 billion from a year ago and was just 0.8 percent below an all-time peak of $12.68 trillion in the third quarter of 2008, before the worst of the financial crisis and deep recession, the data showed.

Some 4.8 percent of all debt was in some stage of delinquency.

Mortgage debt totaled $8.48 trillion at the end of the last quarter, up $231 billion from a year earlier. Student loan debt stood at $1.31 trillion, up $78 billion from a year ago.

Auto union weighing "Buy American" campaign - 路透新闻

{{20170216T172239.740+0000}}Auto union weighing "Buy American" campaignDETROIT - Feb 16 (Reuters) - United Auto Workers President Dennis Williams said on Thursday the union plans to step up its efforts to convince U.S. consumers not to buy vehicles built in other countries, including those sold by the Detroit automakers.

"If it's not made in America, don't buy it," Williams said during a briefing for reporters at the union's Detroit headquarters, responding to a question about General Motors Co's Chevrolet Cruze hatchback, made in Mexico, and the Buick Envision sport utility, which GM imports from China.

The UAW is working on an advertising campaign promote the buy America message, Williams said. "Boycotts may be coming back," he said.

GM's Opel, Peugeot lagging rivals in strong European market -ACEA - 路透新闻

{{20170216T070004.145+0000}}GM's Opel, Peugeot lagging rivals in strong European market -ACEABERLIN, Feb 16 (Reuters) - General Motors and PSA Group posted weaker European sales in January than any other major carmaker as they discuss a possible purchase of GM's European auto operations by PSA.

A combination between GM and PSA would create a manufacturer with about 16 percent of the European passenger car market, ahead of French rival Renault and behind Germany's Volkswagen . [nL8N1G0330]

New passenger car registrations at PSA, including the Peugeot, Citroen and DS brands in the European Union and the European Free Trade Association rose 6.5 percent in January, compared with 5.3 percent for GM's Opel and Vauxhall brands, the Association of European Carmakers (ACEA) said on Thursday.

Conversely, Volkswagen (VW) group, nearly a year and a half after its emissions scandal came to light, racked up 10 percent growth last month, as did Renault, according to Brussels-based ACEA.

Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV even recorded a 15 percent rate of expansion while Ford came in at 9.5 percent.

Overall registrations in the region jumped 10 percent on extra selling days to 1.204 million vehicles from 1.094 million a year earlier, ACEA said.

Britain's largely foreign-owned car industry has thrived in recent years, but the vote to leave the European Union (EU) has cast doubt on future growth by raising the prospect of tariffs which would make UK plants less competitive.

Britain posted the lowest rate of growth among the seven largest EU markets in January at 2.9 percent, compared with around 10 percent expansion each in Germany, Italy, France and Spain.

In the high-margin segment, Germany's leading luxury nameplates Mercedes-Benz and BMW posted 16 percent and 11 percent growth respectively, faring better than VW's Audi brand at 3.1 percent, according to ACEA.

U.S. business in China warms to possible Trump trade policy shake-up - 路透新闻

{{20170215T000042.591+0000}}U.S. business in China warms to possible Trump trade policy shake-up* Reciprocity calls for same access and benefits for both countries

* Many Chinese sectors either off limits or severely restricted

* Beijing's "Made in China 2025" causing concerns

* Reciprocity needed to combat "techno-nationalism - McGregor

* China experts doubt Trump will rock the China boat

By Michael Martina and Matthew Miller

BEIJING, Feb 15 (Reuters) - "Reciprocity" has become the new buzzword in the U.S. business community in China, with some industry leaders saying they would welcome a tougher approach from the Trump administration in opening up the markets of the world's second-largest economy.

It's a striking shift within the American community here, which had long lobbied Washington against taking more aggressive policies, fearing they could draw retribution from China's leaders.

President Donald Trump's picks for Commerce Secretary and Trade Representative, Wilbur Ross and Robert Lighthizer, have in the past backed the reciprocity principle when it comes to China: that Beijing should provide the same access and benefits to American business in China that Washington gives the Chinese in the United States.

"Our membership has moved to some extent in that direction as well, in advocating a firmer posture with respect to China," said Lester Ross, chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China's policy committee.

He made the remarks in January after the group issued a report that found over 60 percent of the chamber's members had "little or no confidence that the Chinese government is committed to opening markets further in the next three years". [nL4N1F82ZV]

Many sectors of China's economy are either off limits or severely restricted to foreign investors.

Foreign banks in China, for example, account for less than 2 percent of total assets, according to the China Banking Regulatory Commission.

A 50-percent ownership cap for foreign life insurers, despite China's 2001 World Trade Organization commitments to lift it, has helped limit their market share to about 6 percent.

China's Anbang Insurance Group , on the other hand, has spent more than $8 billion acquiring U.S. assets, including the Waldorf Astoria Hotel and Strategic Hotels & Resorts. It is still waiting for regulatory approval to buy U.S. life insurer Fidelity & Guaranty Life for $1.6 billion. [nL4N1DM1FU] [nL1N1FS247]

"CHINA HAS OVERREACHED"

The same imbalances can be seen in sectors such as automotives, payment cards and technology.

China's Geely Holding Group [GEELY.UL] bought Volvo from Ford Motor Co. in 2010, but foreign companies are required to set up joint ventures to assemble vehicles in China, often transferring technology in the process.

While China's UnionPay has grown to become the world's largest payment card, according to the number of cards issued, U.S. credit card operators Visa and MasterCard have yet to be independently licensed to clear transactions in China, despite a 2012 WTO ruling mandating that Beijing open the sector.

Foreign technology hardware and service providers are bristling at requirements to meet the restrictive terms of newly minted cyber security regulations. Beijing's "Made in China 2025" plan also calls for a progressive increase in domestic parts used in priority sectors, such as advanced information technology and robotics to 70 percent by 2025.

James McGregor, Chairman of APCO Worldwide, Greater China, said the idea of some form of reciprocity is gaining traction, particularly in combating "techno-nationalism".

"You've got Chinese companies that have protected markets and make loads of money and then they are going out and doing international acquisitions that could destroy other companies," McGregor said. "Now China has overreached so much they have alienated much of the business community."

McGregor said U.S. policy makers had to figure out how to use America's openness and rule of law to deal with China, instead of allowing them to become vulnerabilities.

The question is how to craft a reciprocity policy without destabilising bilateral relations or triggering a retaliatory backlash against U.S. businesses in China.

Chinese state media has warned that U.S. businesses could be targets in any trade war that Trump may unleash - he has threatened to label China a currency manipulator and slap heavy tariffs on Chinese goods.

China's Ministry of Commerce did not respond to a request for comment on the issue of reciprocity.

But Tu Xinquan, a trade expert at Beijing's University of International Business and Economics, said Trump's options would be limited by his promises to create jobs.

"If you close the door to Chinese investments, that's not good for American employment," Tu said.

BAD POLICY

One way to achieve reciprocity would be to use the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) security review process to wall off industries where U.S. businesses face discrimination in China. But most experts see that as straying too far from the free market orthodoxy that has drawn investment and jobs to the United States for decades.

James Zimmerman, a Beijing-based lawyer with Sheppard Mullin and a former chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, said strict reciprocity would be bad policy and against the U.S. system of open investment.

"We need to be very careful what we ask for," Zimmerman said.

Proponents argue reciprocity does not violate free market principles, but is a needed intervention due to a market failure, much as the government uses antitrust policy to crack down on cartels.

Thilo Hanemann, in a Rhodium Group report to the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, said simple calls for reciprocity are "misguided". But, he added, if China's "commingling of commercial and political motives is not resolved, then a new chapter in U.S. – and global – competition policy activism may be required."

"If you assume the cost of these autonomous vehicles, the very early ones, will be six figures, there aren't very many retail customers that are willing to go out and spend that kind of money," Ableson said. "But even at that sort of cost, with a ride sharing platform, you can build a business."

Chief Executive Mary Barra in mid-December said GM would begin building a fully autonomous version of the Bolt EV in early 2017 at its Orion Township plant north of Detroit.

GM is testing about 40 Bolt AVs in San Francisco and Scottsdale, Arizona, and plans to extend testing this year to Detroit, the automaker said in December. [nL1N1E81IU]

A year ago, GM paid $500 million for a minority stake in Lyft, the second-largest U.S. ride sharing firm after Uber. [nL3N14O3VA]

Before it closed the deal, Ableson said he and GM President Dan Ammann discussed with Lyft founders Logan Green and John Zimmer the prospect of jointly developing a ride sharing business with self-driving cars.

"We walked in not wanting so much to talk about the business today, but how do we work together to develop this idea of autonomous, on-demand networks in cities," Ableson said of the initial discussions with Lyft.

To make that business successful, Ableson said, requires the ability to engineer autonomous systems, to build self-driving vehicles in volume and to deploy them in a ride sharing fleet.

"If you take those three things, no one company has all three," Ableson said.

GM in early 2016 acquired Cruise Automation, a San Francisco startup, to help it accelerate development of self-driving cars. [nL1N16J0ZN] GM also launched a car sharing business, Maven, which has provided vehicles to Lyft.

"Cruise, Lyft, Maven are all bringing different parts of this singular solution around autonomous on-demand networks in urban environments," Ableson said.

UPDATE 1-New delinquent U.S. car loans at 8-year peak -NY Fed survey - 路透新闻

{{20170216T215305.999+0000}}UPDATE 1-New delinquent U.S. car loans at 8-year peak -NY Fed survey(Recasts first paragraph, adds details from NY Fed report)

NEW YORK, Feb 16 (Reuters) - More Americans fell behind on their car loan payments in the fourth quarter, bringing auto delinquencies to their highest since the height of the financial crisis, Federal Reserve Bank of New York data released on Thursday showed.

Car loans delinquent by 30 days or more grew to $23.27 billion, the most since $23.46 billion in the third quarter of 2008. They were up from $22.98 billion in the prior quarter.

Seriously delinquent auto loans whose payments were 90 days or more past due jumped to $8.24 billion in the fourth quarter, the highest since the third quarter of 2016, according to the survey.

Delinquency is a predictor on possible losses for carmakers, which often make low interest loans to attract buyers.

Last month, Ford Motor Co's finance arm said it expected a pickup in loan losses from historically low levels following a rise in delinquencies and car possessions.

"Credit losses have been at historically low levels for quite some time, and we continue to see credit losses increase toward more normal levels," Ford Credit said in a presentation of its fourth-quarter results and 2017 outlook.

The increase in late loan payments coincided with drivers loading up on debt to buy the latest car, trunk and SUV models, fueling expectations for record auto sales in 2017. [nL1N1FH0SC]

In the fourth quarter, $142 billion in car loans were generated, giving 2016 the most auto loan originations in the 18-year history of the data, the New York Fed said.

Auto debt hit $1.16 trillion, with a $93 billion rise over the year.

The increase in car loans was part of a broader growth in household debt in the fourth quarter which almost hit an all-time high in the fourth quarter, reaching $12.58 trillion, according to the survey.

Total debt was up $460 billion from a year ago and was just 0.8 percent below an all-time peak of $12.68 trillion in the third quarter of 2008, before the worst of the financial crisis and deep recession, the data showed.

Some 4.8 percent of all debt was in some stage of delinquency.

Mortgage debt totaled $8.48 trillion at the end of the last quarter, up $231 billion from a year earlier. Student loan debt stood at $1.31 trillion, up $78 billion from a year ago.

Auto union weighing "Buy American" campaign - 路透新闻

{{20170216T172239.740+0000}}Auto union weighing "Buy American" campaignDETROIT - Feb 16 (Reuters) - United Auto Workers President Dennis Williams said on Thursday the union plans to step up its efforts to convince U.S. consumers not to buy vehicles built in other countries, including those sold by the Detroit automakers.

"If it's not made in America, don't buy it," Williams said during a briefing for reporters at the union's Detroit headquarters, responding to a question about General Motors Co's Chevrolet Cruze hatchback, made in Mexico, and the Buick Envision sport utility, which GM imports from China.

The UAW is working on an advertising campaign promote the buy America message, Williams said. "Boycotts may be coming back," he said.

GM's Opel, Peugeot lagging rivals in strong European market -ACEA - 路透新闻

{{20170216T070004.145+0000}}GM's Opel, Peugeot lagging rivals in strong European market -ACEABERLIN, Feb 16 (Reuters) - General Motors and PSA Group posted weaker European sales in January than any other major carmaker as they discuss a possible purchase of GM's European auto operations by PSA.

A combination between GM and PSA would create a manufacturer with about 16 percent of the European passenger car market, ahead of French rival Renault and behind Germany's Volkswagen . [nL8N1G0330]

New passenger car registrations at PSA, including the Peugeot, Citroen and DS brands in the European Union and the European Free Trade Association rose 6.5 percent in January, compared with 5.3 percent for GM's Opel and Vauxhall brands, the Association of European Carmakers (ACEA) said on Thursday.

Conversely, Volkswagen (VW) group, nearly a year and a half after its emissions scandal came to light, racked up 10 percent growth last month, as did Renault, according to Brussels-based ACEA.

Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV even recorded a 15 percent rate of expansion while Ford came in at 9.5 percent.

Overall registrations in the region jumped 10 percent on extra selling days to 1.204 million vehicles from 1.094 million a year earlier, ACEA said.

Britain's largely foreign-owned car industry has thrived in recent years, but the vote to leave the European Union (EU) has cast doubt on future growth by raising the prospect of tariffs which would make UK plants less competitive.

Britain posted the lowest rate of growth among the seven largest EU markets in January at 2.9 percent, compared with around 10 percent expansion each in Germany, Italy, France and Spain.

In the high-margin segment, Germany's leading luxury nameplates Mercedes-Benz and BMW posted 16 percent and 11 percent growth respectively, faring better than VW's Audi brand at 3.1 percent, according to ACEA.

U.S. business in China warms to possible Trump trade policy shake-up - 路透新闻

{{20170215T000042.591+0000}}U.S. business in China warms to possible Trump trade policy shake-up* Reciprocity calls for same access and benefits for both countries

* Many Chinese sectors either off limits or severely restricted

* Beijing's "Made in China 2025" causing concerns

* Reciprocity needed to combat "techno-nationalism - McGregor

* China experts doubt Trump will rock the China boat

By Michael Martina and Matthew Miller

BEIJING, Feb 15 (Reuters) - "Reciprocity" has become the new buzzword in the U.S. business community in China, with some industry leaders saying they would welcome a tougher approach from the Trump administration in opening up the markets of the world's second-largest economy.

It's a striking shift within the American community here, which had long lobbied Washington against taking more aggressive policies, fearing they could draw retribution from China's leaders.

President Donald Trump's picks for Commerce Secretary and Trade Representative, Wilbur Ross and Robert Lighthizer, have in the past backed the reciprocity principle when it comes to China: that Beijing should provide the same access and benefits to American business in China that Washington gives the Chinese in the United States.

"Our membership has moved to some extent in that direction as well, in advocating a firmer posture with respect to China," said Lester Ross, chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China's policy committee.

He made the remarks in January after the group issued a report that found over 60 percent of the chamber's members had "little or no confidence that the Chinese government is committed to opening markets further in the next three years". [nL4N1F82ZV]

Many sectors of China's economy are either off limits or severely restricted to foreign investors.

Foreign banks in China, for example, account for less than 2 percent of total assets, according to the China Banking Regulatory Commission.

A 50-percent ownership cap for foreign life insurers, despite China's 2001 World Trade Organization commitments to lift it, has helped limit their market share to about 6 percent.

China's Anbang Insurance Group , on the other hand, has spent more than $8 billion acquiring U.S. assets, including the Waldorf Astoria Hotel and Strategic Hotels & Resorts. It is still waiting for regulatory approval to buy U.S. life insurer Fidelity & Guaranty Life for $1.6 billion. [nL4N1DM1FU] [nL1N1FS247]

"CHINA HAS OVERREACHED"

The same imbalances can be seen in sectors such as automotives, payment cards and technology.

China's Geely Holding Group [GEELY.UL] bought Volvo from Ford Motor Co. in 2010, but foreign companies are required to set up joint ventures to assemble vehicles in China, often transferring technology in the process.

While China's UnionPay has grown to become the world's largest payment card, according to the number of cards issued, U.S. credit card operators Visa and MasterCard have yet to be independently licensed to clear transactions in China, despite a 2012 WTO ruling mandating that Beijing open the sector.

Foreign technology hardware and service providers are bristling at requirements to meet the restrictive terms of newly minted cyber security regulations. Beijing's "Made in China 2025" plan also calls for a progressive increase in domestic parts used in priority sectors, such as advanced information technology and robotics to 70 percent by 2025.

James McGregor, Chairman of APCO Worldwide, Greater China, said the idea of some form of reciprocity is gaining traction, particularly in combating "techno-nationalism".

"You've got Chinese companies that have protected markets and make loads of money and then they are going out and doing international acquisitions that could destroy other companies," McGregor said. "Now China has overreached so much they have alienated much of the business community."

McGregor said U.S. policy makers had to figure out how to use America's openness and rule of law to deal with China, instead of allowing them to become vulnerabilities.

The question is how to craft a reciprocity policy without destabilising bilateral relations or triggering a retaliatory backlash against U.S. businesses in China.

Chinese state media has warned that U.S. businesses could be targets in any trade war that Trump may unleash - he has threatened to label China a currency manipulator and slap heavy tariffs on Chinese goods.

China's Ministry of Commerce did not respond to a request for comment on the issue of reciprocity.

But Tu Xinquan, a trade expert at Beijing's University of International Business and Economics, said Trump's options would be limited by his promises to create jobs.

"If you close the door to Chinese investments, that's not good for American employment," Tu said.

BAD POLICY

One way to achieve reciprocity would be to use the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) security review process to wall off industries where U.S. businesses face discrimination in China. But most experts see that as straying too far from the free market orthodoxy that has drawn investment and jobs to the United States for decades.

James Zimmerman, a Beijing-based lawyer with Sheppard Mullin and a former chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, said strict reciprocity would be bad policy and against the U.S. system of open investment.

"We need to be very careful what we ask for," Zimmerman said.

Proponents argue reciprocity does not violate free market principles, but is a needed intervention due to a market failure, much as the government uses antitrust policy to crack down on cartels.

Thilo Hanemann, in a Rhodium Group report to the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, said simple calls for reciprocity are "misguided". But, he added, if China's "commingling of commercial and political motives is not resolved, then a new chapter in U.S. – and global – competition policy activism may be required."

BREAKINGVIEWS-Ford's $1 bln self-driving bet needs careful steer - 路透新闻

{{20170213T160448.150+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-Ford's $1 bln self-driving bet needs careful steer(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.)

By Antony Currie

NEW YORK, Feb 13 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Ford is recognizing that the race to develop a self-driving car isn't an autonomous one. America's second-largest automaker is investing $1 billion in artificial-intelligence startup Argo. It could prove to be one of the smarter moves by a traditional industry player to compete in driverless vehicles – as long as Ford manages to mesh its new partner's culture with its own.

The Motown manufacturer run by Mark Fields is taking a majority stake in Argo in return for plowing cash into the months-old firm over the next five years. The remainder of the stock not already owned by its founders and employees could prove to be a valuable weapon in the war for tech talent.

Ford, after all, currently trades around seven times 2018 earnings – and that's with the United States, the industry's most profitable market, at or near its peak. Parts maker Mobileye , whose computer-vision and machine-learning products are most akin to Argo's, trades at 17 times 2018 earnings and is growing fast. Google parent Alphabet , which owns self-driving firm Waymo, commands a multiple of 22 times expected net income. These are more appealing currencies than Ford stock.

Argo's co-founders, Bryan Salesky and Peter Rander, are both alums of Carnegie Mellon National Robotics Engineering Center, whose ranks are routinely raided by companies wanting to compete in autonomous cars. They previously occupied senior positions at Waymo and Uber [UBER.UL], respectively. That ought to give Ford some crucial extra insight into what two of the industry's most active interlopers are doing.

There's one more advantage. Suppliers have long captured a large slug of the most valuable aspects of the manufacturing chain. That's even more of a concern as new technologies proliferate – and helps explain some of the multiple gap between parts makers and their clients. Ford's Argo deal is one of the few that may secure ownership of some of the core self-driving know-how for an incumbent carmaker.

Argo, though, will take on the staff currently working on Ford's own virtual-driver program – and offer them stock. Those employed on other parts of the Blue Oval's autonomous-driving project will be left out, which means creating a two-tier employment system – and resentment.

Managing such clashing cultures is likely to be Ford's greatest challenge, and one that can't be put on autopilot.

CONTEXT NEWS

- Ford on Feb. 10 said it had agreed to invest $1 billion over the next five years in a new artificial-intelligence startup called Argo AI to boost its development of autonomous vehicles. Ford will also be the majority shareholder of the company and have two seats on the company's five-person board.

- Argo AI was founded by Bryan Salesky, who was a director in hardware development for Google's self-driving cars, and Peter Rander, who was engineering lead at Uber's advanced technologies center. Both men also are alumni of the Carnegie Mellon National Robotics Engineering Center.

- Ford's team working on its virtual-driver program will become employees of Argo AI. The overall autonomous vehicles platform, though, will remain within Ford.

Auto CEOs want Trump to order review of 2025 fuel rules - 路透新闻

{{20170213T145524.095+0000}}Auto CEOs want Trump to order review of 2025 fuel rulesBy David Shepardson

WASHINGTON, Feb 12 (Reuters) - The chief executives of 18 major automakers and their U.S. units urged President Donald Trump to revisit a decision by the Obama administration to lock in vehicle fuel efficiency rules through 2025.

In a letter sent late Friday and viewed by Reuters, the chief executives of General Motors Co , Ford Motor Co, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV, along with the top North American executives at Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T>, Volkswagen AG , Honda Motor Co <7267.T>, Hyundai Motor Co <005380.KS>, Nissan Motor Co <7201.T> and others urged Trump to reverse the decision, warning thousands of jobs could be at risk.

On Jan. 13, the head of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency finalized a determination that the landmark fuel efficiency rules instituted by then President Barack Obama should be locked in through 2025, a bid to maintain a key part of his administration's climate legacy.

As part of a 2012 regulation, EPA had to decide by April 2018 whether to modify the 2022-2025 model year vehicle emission rules requiring average fleet-wide efficiency of more than 50 miles per gallon through a "midterm review." The agency in November moved up the timetable for proposing automakers could meet the 2025 standards.

The auto CEO letter asked Trump to reopen the midterm review "without prejudging the outcome" and praised Trump's "personal focus on steps to strengthen the economy in the United States and your commitment to jobs in our sector."

Days after Trump was elected, automakers quickly appealed to Trump to review the rules, saying they impose significant costs and are out of step with consumer preferences.

Gloria Bergquist, a spokeswoman for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, said Sunday, automakers are "seeking a restoration of the process -- that's all. This is a reset."

The chief executives of Ford, GM and Fiat Chrysler also raised the issue in a White House meeting with Trump last month.

The letter warned the rules could "threaten future production levels, putting hundreds of thousands and perhaps as many as a million jobs at risk."

Environmentalists say the rules are working, saving drivers thousands in fuel costs and shouldn't be changed. Luke Tonachel of the Natural Resources Defense Council, said lowering the standards would "cost consumers more, increase our dependence on oil and put Americans at greater risk from a changing climate."

Trump EPA nominee Scott Pruitt told a Senate panel he will review the Obama administration's decision.

In 2011, Obama announced an agreement with automakers to raise fuel efficiency standards to 54.5 miles per gallon. This, the administration said, would save motorists $1.7 trillion in fuel costs over the life of the vehicles, but cost the auto industry about $200 billion over 13 years.

The EPA said in July that because Americans were buying fewer cars and more SUVs and trucks, it estimated the fleet will average 50.8 mpg to 52.6 mpg in 2025.

ANALYSIS-Japan's love of tiny cars sore spot as Trump, Abe meet - 路透新闻

{{20170210T000520.080+0000}}ANALYSIS-Japan's love of tiny cars sore spot as Trump, Abe meetBy Naomi Tajitsu, Norihiko Shirouzu and Bernie Woodall

TOKYO/DETROIT, Feb 9 (Reuters) - When Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe meets on Friday with U.S. President Donald Trump, Japan's bulging automotive trade surplus will be a sore spot, but the path to balancing auto exports and imports will be no easier than it was in the 1980s.

Trump may press Abe to do more to level the trade imbalance with Japan during a White House visit or a round of golf, [nL4N1FT2IA] [nL4N1FT2MC]. But the two leaders are unlikely to change the fact that the big cars and trucks that America makes do not sell in Japan.

Many Japanese consumers, faced with congested cities, favor tiny domestically-made vehicles, called kei cars, which make up more than a third of the market. Priced from around 1.1 million yen, or about $9,800, these cars have engines most Americans would consider inadequate for a motorcycle.

Even Japan's Toyota Motor Corp <7201.T> and Honda Motor Co <7267.T> cannot convince Japanese consumers to buy models that are popular in the United States. Small sport utility vehicles such as the Toyota RAV4 and Honda's CR-V are seen by Japanese consumers as too big.

Only about 13,000 vehicles from U.S. automakers sold in Japan in both 2016 and 2015, and of that about three-fourths were Jeep SUVs made by Fiat Chrysler Automobiles . Ford Motor Co announced last month that it is pulling out of the Japanese market entirely, after selling just 2,400 vehicles there in 2016. [nL3N15931P]

The Japanese auto market has shrunk not only in terms of vehicle size, but in sales volume. As a result, global automakers, including Japan's, are focused on boosting sales in China, the United States and growing emerging markets.

"It would take a painstaking fine-tuning of vehicle specs to suit American cars to those driving and other conditions and develop a strong distribution network to be able to gain traction in Japan. It is nothing short of a 20-year effort," said a Toyota executive who spoke on condition he not be named.

Jaguar Land Rover Japan Ltd Chief Executive Magnus Hansson said the low sales of U.S. cars in Japan did not mean it was a closed market, but rather reflected "a total and absolute lack of effort over 50 years" by Detroit.

Still, Japan remains an export hub for the big Japanese automakers. The U.S. Commerce Department this week reported that the U.S. trade deficit with Japan in 2016 was $68.9 billion, and of that total surplus, some $52.6 billion was in vehicles and automotive parts.

Japan's automakers have more than 90 percent of the Japanese market. Last year U.S. automakers controlled only 45 percent of their home market, the world's second-biggest after China.

A bigger factor than imports in the Detroit automakers' loss of U.S. market share since 1980 is the surge in investment by Japan's automakers in U.S. factories. Last year, 56 percent of the vehicles Toyota sold in the United States were made in America, the company said. Toyota said it employs more than 34,000 in the United States.

For years the growth of Japanese-owned auto factories in the U.S. heartland has helped cool trade tensions.

But Trump, a Republican, has turned up the heat by complaining about the trade surplus and accusing Japan of manipulating the value of the yen to disadvantage American-made goods.

On Thursday, a bipartisan group of senators from auto manufacturing states called on the new president "to address currency manipulation and auto-related non-tariff barriers."

They are not alone in urging changes to help bolster U.S. business.

"(Trump) must bring Abe up short on any cheery notion that business will continue as usual," said Kevin L. Kearns, head of the U.S. Business and Industry Council.

The group represents smaller U.S. manufacturers, many of which feed the U.S. auto industry.

Global automakers blame tax policy, Lunar New Year for China sales drop - 路透新闻

{{20170209T073645.946+0000}}Global automakers blame tax policy, Lunar New Year for China sales drop* Ford Jan sales fall 32 pct; GM fall 24 pct

* Biggest declines since at least 2015

* Tax cut on small-engined vehicles rolled back

By Jake Spring

BEIJING, Feb 9 (Reuters) - China vehicle sales in January fell by the largest margin since 2015 for several global automakers, with General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co blaming the roll back of a tax cut on small-engined vehicles and the Lunar New Year holiday.

Ford Motor said on Thursday that its sales fell 32 percent year-on-year, while GM said sales dropped 24 percent, making the biggest drop since the two automakers first began reporting data for retail sales of their vehicles in China in the second quarter of 2015.

China's central government raised the purchase tax on cars with engines of 1.6 litres or less to 7.5 percent this year from a special rate of 5 percent last year, a policy originally instituted to shore up sales in a weakening economy. It plans to return the rate to 10 percent in 2018.

"January was an unusual month with the earlier timing of the Chinese New Year holiday and the impact of the reduced tax incentive," Ford said in a statement citing Peter Fleet, head of sales for Asia Pacific. "Sales of vehicles not affected by the tax incentive were strong."

China annually takes a one-week holiday for the Lunar New Year, which typically distorts sales in January and February as the dates vary each year.

On Wednesday, Toyota recorded a 18.7 percent drop in January sales, its largest decline since March 2015.[nB9N1FA02I]

Nissan reported a 6.2 percent sales decline for the month, also citing seasonality and "the rush for car purchase in December 2016" before the tax policy changed.[nB9N1FA02K]

Honda, which has outstripped its US and Japanese competitors for the last two years, thanks in part to hot-selling sport-utility vehicles, said on Wednesday that sales grew 5.3 percent in January.[nB9N1FA02M]

The country's automakers association predicts sales in China, the world's largest auto market, will grow 5 percent this year, slowing from a 13.7 percent rise in 2016 that was achieved on the back of the tax cut.[nL4N1F13A4]

FACTBOX-Company shares mostly able to recover from Trump tweets - 路透新闻

{{20170208T185615.567+0000}}FACTBOX-Company shares mostly able to recover from Trump tweets(Adds Nordstrom share price is higher; adds details on Rexnord,
Toyota)

Feb 8 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump's tweets on various
companies have drawn much attention, but with the Dow <.DJI>,
S&P 500 <.SPX> and Nasdaq at or near record levels, the impact
on the shares of those companies has been mostly short-lived.

Following is a list of companies targeted in Trump's tweets:

Nordstrom Inc : The most recent tweet from Trump on
Wednesday was a departure from his prior criticisms in that it
related to his daughter Ivanka's business dealings and not his
political agenda. Trump said his daughter had been treated
"unfairly" by the company, which media outlets reported last
week was winding down its relationship with Ivanka's brand.
[nL1N1FT1FA] Shares of Nordstrom dropped 0.7 percent and spiked
in volume in a one-minute span on Wednesday but were last up 1.5
percent at a session high of $43.42 in early afternoon.

Rexnord Corp : Trump targeted the company in a Dec. 2
tweet for "moving to Mexico and rather viciously firing all of
its 300 workers." The stock shed 1.1 percent in the following
session but is up nearly 12 percent since the tweet and closed
at a 9-1/2 month high on Tuesday.

Boeing Co : The Dow component was targeted by Trump in
a Dec. 6 tweet that criticized costs for the Air Force One plane
manufactured by the company. Shares closed that session little

UPDATE 1-Geely's Volvo Car Group upbeat on 2017 after earnings jump - 路透新闻

{{20170208T075209.972+0000}}UPDATE 1-Geely's Volvo Car Group upbeat on 2017 after earnings jump* Annual operating profit 11 bln crowns, up from 6.6 bln

* Revenue of 180.7 bln up from 164.0 bln

* To add 700-800 staff at Gothenburg plant

(Adds CEO comment, background)

STOCKHOLM, Feb 8 (Reuters) - Volvo Car Group reported a jump in 2016 earnings and revenue on Wednesday and forecast higher sales this year helped by new models developed under Chinese owner Geely.

Operating earnings rose to 11.0 billion Swedish crowns ($1.24 billion) from 6.6 billion a year earlier.

The company was bought by China's Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co. from Ford Motor Co. in 2010.

It has invested in new models and plants to secure a niche in the premium auto market which is dominated by Daimler's Mercedes-Benz and BMW .

Gothenburg-based Volvo reported record high sales of 534,332 cars in 2016. One of Sweden's largest companies by sales and number of employees, Volvo has set an annual sales goal of 800,000 cars in the medium term.

That is seen as a sufficient level to ensure its place in the market and to sustain future investments.

"I foresee that 2017 will also be a record year in terms of sales," CEO Hakan Samuelsson said in a statement.

Samuelsson told Reuters he expected profitability to stay at a "very strong level" this year as the automaker continued to replace older models with the likes of its new XC60 and XC40 SUVs.

"This year will be a year with heavy industrial transformation," Samuelsson said. "Two new cars will come out and at the end of the year we will, for the first time, have an all-modern line-up of SUVs."

Global auto markets, not least a Chinese premium segment where Volvo has made inroads since Geely's acquisition, are seen helping sales of a model line-up that has added the new XC90 SUV and 90-series in recent years, he said.

Volvo also said it was looking to hire an additional 700 to 800 employees at its Torslanda plant in Gothenburg in western Sweden.

Last year Volvo also took steps toward an eventual listing, raising 5 billion crowns from Swedish institutional investors through the sale of newly issued preference shares, though Samuelsson repeated there were currently no plans for an IPO. [nL5N1EF0ZW]

"This is something for the owner," he said.

"We are focusing on improving the performance of the company and being transparent in our reporting."

Geely's Volvo sees record sales in 2017 as new models spur demand - 路透新闻

{{20170208T050001.340+0000}}Geely's Volvo sees record sales in 2017 as new models spur demandSTOCKHOLM, Feb 8 (Reuters) - Geely-owned Volvo Car Group said on Wednesday it expected sales to hit a fresh record this year after reporting sharply higher earnings and revenues for 2016 as strong demand for new models developed under Chinese ownership underpinned growth.

Operating earnings at Volvo, bought by Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co. from Ford Motor Co. in 2010, rose to 11.0 billion Swedish crowns ($1.24 billion) for full-year 2016 from 6.6 billion a year earlier.

Backed by its Chinese owner, Volvo has undertaken a vast investment plan in new models and plants to secure a viable niche in a premium auto market dominated by larger German rivals such as Daimler's Mercedes-Benz and BMW .

The company, one of Sweden's biggest companies by sales and number of employees, has set a goal of reaching sales of 800,000 cars in the medium term, a level seen sufficient to ensure its place in the market and sustain future investments.

Gothenburg-based Volvo struggled to make its mark under Ford ownership but sales have steadily increased in recent years on the back of strong demand for new models and hit a new record of 534,332 cars in 2016.

"The new models are successful, sales are at record levels and profits are up substantially," Chief Executive Hakan Samuelsson said in a statement.

"On the back of these achievements, I foresee that 2017 will also be a record year in terms of sales."

In light of the growing sales, Volvo said separately it was looking to hire an additional 700 to 800 employees at its Torslanda plant in Gothenburg, in western Sweden.

UPDATE 1-EXCLUSIVE-Italian diesel probe omitted key tests for Fiat Chrysler models - 路透新闻

{{20170207T215021.054+0000}}UPDATE 1-EXCLUSIVE-Italian diesel probe omitted key tests for Fiat Chrysler models(Adds Italian ministry comment)

By Laurence Frost and Silvia Aloisi

PARIS/MILAN, Feb 7 (Reuters) - Fiat Chrysler vehicles were allowed to skip key tests for illegal engine software during Italy's main emissions-cheating investigation in the wake of the Volkswagen scandal, according to the transport ministry's own report.

The report, presented to a European parliamentary committee in October but never officially published, will be seized upon by environmental groups pressing MEPs to vote on Thursday for tougher EU oversight of vehicle testing by national authorities.

"It's imperative that we break this cosy relationship between national testing authorities and their domestic carmakers," said Julia Poliscanova, a vehicle emissions specialist at Brussels-based campaign group Transport & Environment. "This problem is at the heart of Dieselgate."

The Italian report may raise questions for Fiat Chrysler (FCA) as it faces a U.S. criminal investigation for alleged emissions manipulation and German accusations that it, like VW , used "defeat devices" to confound nitrogen oxide (NOx) tests.

FCA on Monday became the third carmaker after VW and Renault to be referred to French prosecutors over the scandal. The Italian-American company denies breaking any laws, a spokesman reiterated, declining further comment. [nL5N1FR61Q]

The ministry findings, which have been circulated by some Italian opposition politicians and examined by Reuters, include complete sets of data for eight diesel cars made by BMW , Ford , Mercedes , Volkswagen and GM's Opel.

But for three of the seven FCA models also investigated - a Jeep Cherokee 2.0, Alfa Romeo Giulietta 1.6 and Lancia Ypsilon 1.3 - results are missing from an on-road measurement phase and a reversed version of the EU's standard "NEDC" lab test.

All seven FCA models also lack data for an "Artemis" test that adjusts the EU lab regime to reflect urban driving styles. The three skipped protocols are typically used to help unmask defeat devices by preventing them from detecting the test.

No explanation for the missing FCA results was offered in the document.

But transport ministry spokeswoman Luisa Gabbi told Reuters a "new definitive version" had been drafted to include more data for FCA models following further tests, and would be published in coming weeks.

"No key test has been omitted for FCA," she said.

Following VW's exposure in 2015 for U.S. diesel test-cheating, several European countries launched their own investigative test programmes.

Their results revealed on-road NOx emissions as high as 15 times the regulatory limits, as well as the widespread use of defeat devices that reduce exhaust treatment in some conditions.

LOOPHOLE

FCA is among carmakers including Renault and GM that have broadly invoked an EU legal loophole designed to allow such software only when it is necessary for safety or engine protection. All deny breaking the law.

In German and French testing, a Jeep Cherokee 2.0-litre similar to the model overlooked by Italian engineers emitted between 5.3 and 9.9 times the legal NOx limit under modified EU test cycles conducted in the lab or on the road.

Independent road testing of a Fiat 500L with the same 1.6-litre engine as the omitted Alfa Giulietta measured NOx levels more than 5.6 times the statutory 180 miligrammes per kilometre for Euro 5 engines, according to UK-based Emissions Analytics.

According to the Italian report, the FCA models were all analysed in Fiat's own labs under the supervision of ministry officials, while all other models were tested at an independent Istituto Motori facility.

The draft regulation before MEPs would bolster EU oversight of government testing authorities to address perceived conflicts of interest when they inspect and certify the cars of their own national manufacturing champions.

Brussels would get powers to carry out vehicle spot-checks and allow national authorities to peer-review one another's decisions. Under current rules, a vehicle certification is valid EU-wide but can be revoked only by the country that issued it.

Lawmakers on the European Parliament's internal market committee are expected to approve the draft with only minor amendments on Thursday, setting the stage for a plenary vote.

The European Commission, which drew up the proposals last year, is mediating in a related dispute after Germany accused Italian regulators of failing to act on evidence that FCA models including the Fiat 500X use banned defeat devices.

A spokeswoman for the EU executive declined to comment on the Italian diesel report but emphasized the need for change.

"Member states have so far wanted to keep exclusive responsibility," Lucia Caudet said. "But this system has failed."

UPDATE 3-GM fourth-quarter profit falls on currency losses; stock tumbles - 路透新闻

{{20170207T174014.163+0000}}UPDATE 3-GM fourth-quarter profit falls on currency losses; stock tumbles(Adds details on currency losses, CEO, CFO comments from conference call, updates share price)

By Bernie Woodall and Joseph White

DETROIT, Feb 7 (Reuters) - General Motors Co said on Tuesday that fourth-quarter net income fell partly on the strength of the dollar against the British pound and forecast flat 2017 profit per share, sending shares tumbling nearly 5 percent.

The drop in the stock also reflected concerns about rising inventories of unsold vehicles in the United States.

Despite investments in new technology, such as automated vehicles, and new sport utility vehicles and trucks, analysts said GM is unlikely to deliver significant growth in 2017 after two years of record profits.

Shares in rival automakers Ford Motor Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV also sank.

The latest results from GM, the third-largest global automaker, highlighted the challenges facing auto industry chiefs as an era of open trade and low interest rates that fed growth appeared to be ending.

During a conference call, GM Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra and Chief Financial Officer Chuck Stevens were asked if there would be any impact on the company if President Donald Trump succeeds in imposing new taxes on imported goods such as auto parts or vehicles.

"I've shared a lot of information about the dynamics in the auto industry," Barra said. "Right now it's a very constructive dialogue. The administration is really listening."

Stevens said the value of imported parts in its U.S. vehicles is less than many rivals.

"We support tax reform that would make the U.S. manufacturing base stronger. A border tax is one part," Stevens said. "There are a lot of moving pieces."

In North America, where GM earned the bulk of its profits, inventories of unsold vehicles at its U.S. dealers rose by one-third to 845,000 vehicles at the end of 2016. Stevens said the company had built up inventories ahead of product launches, and intends to bring them down through this year.

Its North American adjusted profit margins declined to 8.4 percent in the fourth quarter from 10 percent a year earlier. Adjusted North American profit margins for full-year 2016 were 10.1 percent, down from 10.3 percent in 2015.

Stevens said the company does not expect to break even in Europe this year, but will push to "get to that point in 2018."

Stevens suggested more restructuring could be on the way for its European operation. "We need to take renewed actions to get back on the path to a sustainable business," he said. "And we will."

Of the $500 million foreign currency exchange bite from fourth-quarter net income, about $300 million was from the decline in the value of the British pound after the vote to leave the European Union, GM said.

GM's fourth-quarter net income fell to $1.8 billion, or $1.19 per share, from $6.3 billion, or $3.92 a share, a year earlier.

Excluding one-time items, GM earned $1.28 a share, in the latest quarter, beating analysts' expectations of $1.17 per share.

GM forecast adjusted earnings per share at $6.00 to $6.50 a share in 2017, compared with $6.12 in 2016.

GM's 52,000 hourly U.S. workers represented by the United Auto Workers union will get an annual bonus of $12,000, up from $11,000 a year ago. This is based on GM's North American adjusted profit.

GM completed a $5 billion share repurchase authorization in 2016 and will finish a second authorization of $4 billion this year. A third buyback program of $5 billion announced last month "will be completed as expeditiously as possible," Stevens said on the conference call.

GM shares fell $1.75 to $35.07.

Ford plans to nearly double SUV models in U.S. by 2020 - 路透新闻

{{20170207T170001.052+0000}}Ford plans to nearly double SUV models in U.S. by 2020By Paul Lienert

DETROIT, Feb 7 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co plans to expand its lineup of sport utility and crossover vehicles in the United States to 13 models from seven by 2020, according to company officials and supplier sources, in response to rapid growth in SUV sales.

At least three of those future models have been approved for production in the past two years, sources said. Since 2014, the market share of sport utilities has increased from 32.6 percent to nearly 40 percent of total U.S. vehicle sales in 2016.

That shift is equivalent to more than 3 vehicle assembly plants worth of production annually, and is driving other automakers, including General Motors Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV , to direct more investment towards SUVs and trucks, industry executives said. [nL1N1F010Q]

"SUVs are the top-selling segment in the U.S.," said Mark LaNeve, Ford vice president of U.S. marketing, sales and service in a statement released late Monday. "That is why we are introducing five new SUVs in the U.S. by 2020," for the Ford brand.

Supplier sources said separately that a sixth new model would carry the Lincoln badge.

This fall, Ford will launch a redesigned 2018 version of its large Expedition SUV, which competes with the Chevrolet Tahoe and Suburban in one of the most lucrative market segments in the global auto industry. GM's lineup of large SUVs dominates the segment.

Ford Division, which makes the company's Ford-branded cars, said its current four-model SUV lineup, which includes the Escape, the Edge and the Explorer, will be joined over the next three years by the compact EcoSport, which will be imported from India in early 2018; the mid-size Bronco, which goes into production in late 2019 in Wayne, Michigan, and a battery-powered compact crossover with a 300-mile range that begins production in Flat Rock, Michigan, in 2019.

Ford Division officials did not disclose details on two other unidentified models. Supplier sources said those vehicles likely are new compact models, where consumer demand is greatest. One is based on the next-generation Focus small car, the sources said, while the other could be based on the next-generation of the subcompact Fiesta.

By 2020, Ford Division's SUV lineup will grow to nine entries, while the Lincoln brand will market four SUVs, all of which share underpinnings with companion Ford models, according to the sources.

The future Lincolns include redesigned versions of the Navigator, due this fall; the MKC in 2019, and the MKX in 2021, the sources said. A fourth model, an all-new mid-size entry which suppliers refer to alternately as the Aviator or MKD, is expected to share underpinnings in 2019 with the next-generation Explorer.

In addition, Ford plans to redesign the Escape in 2018, the Explorer in 2019 and the Edge in 2021, the sources said.

Ford has raised its share of SUV sales to 33.9 percent of its U.S. sales in 2016 but the automaker still lags behind GM.

GM's SUVs accounted for 36.6 percent of its U.S. sales last year, up a fraction from 36.2 percent in 2015.

SUVs represented 38.4 percent of total U.S. vehicle sales in 2016, up from 35.9 percent the previous year, according to Autodata.

UPDATE 1-UK new car sales rise in January, boosted by consumer demand - 路透新闻

{{20170206T093702.745+0000}}UPDATE 1-UK new car sales rise in January, boosted by consumer demand(Adds details, quotes)

LONDON, Feb 6 (Reuters) - British new car registrations rose 3 percent in January according to a car industry body's figures, spurred on by the first annual increase in demand from private consumers since March despite fears Brexit would hit sales.

A total of 174,564 new cars were registered last month in Europe's second largest market, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said on Monday, boosted by a five percent increase in sales to individual consumers.

Analysts predict the British car market will shrink by around five percent in 2017 after two years of record high demand and due to the Brexit-related fall in the pound pushing up the price of some models.

But the chief executive of one of Britain's biggest dealership chains Lookers told Reuters key economic fundamentals remained in place to drive demand.

"The deals are good, unemployment is low and they are the things that have driven growth," Andy Bruce said.

Demand from business customers for fleet cars, the biggest proportion of overall registrations, also returned to growth in January after falling marginally in December.

Bruce suggested that an increase in excise duty which will be paid on many new car sales due to come into force in April might be bringing forward some demand to the first three months of the year.

"There will be an element of pull-forward in my view that people will be clamouring to get what's available today rather than ordering cars that will fall into quarter two," he said.

{{20170206T091223.393+0000}}UK new car sales rise 3 percent in January LONDON, Feb 6 (Reuters) - British new car registrations rose 2.9 percent in January, a car industry body said on Monday, spurred on by the first annual increase in demand from private consumers for 10 months despite fears Brexit would cool sales.

Car sales hit 174,564 units last month in Europe's second largest market, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said on Monday, boosted by a 5 percent increase in sales to individual consumers.

Analysts predict the British car market will shrink by around 5 percent after two years of record high demand and due to the Brexit-related fall in the pound pushing up the price of some models and causing wider uncertainty.

UPDATE 1-Takata taps KSS as final bidder for restructuring deal - sources - 路透新闻

{{20170204T043930.345+0000}}UPDATE 1-Takata taps KSS as final bidder for restructuring deal - sources* U.S.-based parts supplier owned by China's Ningbo Joyson

* Takata at centre of global airbag recall, seeks financial rescue

* Takata struggles to supply replacement parts, repay recall costs

(Adds details on sponsor search process)

By Maki Shiraki and Paul Lienert

TOKYO/DETROIT, Feb 4 (Reuters) - Takata Corp <7312.T> has selected Chinese-owned Key Safety Systems (KSS), a U.S.-based auto parts supplier, as the final bidder to extend financial support for the Japanese airbag maker, three sources with knowledge of the process have told Reuters.

The steering committee leading the selection process told Takata's automaker clients that it has tapped KSS, owned by China's Ningbo Joyson <600699.SS>, to provide financial support for the company, the sources told Reuters on Saturday. Both Takata and KSS declined to comment.

Takata has been seeking financial backers through the selection process to help it deal with billions of dollars in costs related to the recall of millions of potentially defective airbag inflators that have been linked to at least 16 deaths globally.

Previously, Reuters and other media had reported that autoparts suppliers including Sweden's Autoliv Inc had been in the running to bid for Takata.

Takata set up a steering committee last year to lead the process of finding a backer, appointing investment bank Lazard ltd as an advisor on the search.

Established in 2004, Ningbo Joyson produces a range of car parts from steering wheels to electronic control units, and counts automakers Volkswagen , Ford Motor Co , and General Motors Co among its customers. It has been expanding its global operations, acquiring German supplier Preh Group in 2011 and KSS last year.

FEW DETAILS

A successful bid could see KSS take some form of control over Takata, which continues to struggle with the financial and corporate fallout of the automotive industry's biggest-ever product recall, which began in 2008.

Reuters had previously reported that KSS was preparing to bid for Takata with private equity firm Bain Capital.[nL4N1F85ZM]

With around 100 million of its potentially defective airbag inflators slated for recall, the company has sought help from rivals including Autoliv and Japan's Daicel Corp <4202.T> to supply replacement parts.

Last month, the company agreed to plead guilty to criminal wrongdoing in the United States, where the majority of airbag-related deaths have occurred, which resulted in a $1 billion fine. It also faces civil lawsuits. [nL1N1F3140]

Other people with knowledge of the restructuring process said no decision has been made on the details of Takata's restructuring.

Potential bidders for Takata have favoured a court-led turnaround of its Japanese operations, which would cap their exposure to Takata's existing liabilities, estimated by some analysts to be as high as $10 billion for recall costs alone.

Such an option could deal a huge blow to shareholders, including the founding Takada family, a major investor. Last week, the company in a statement said it opposed a court-led restructuring, which it says could disrupt its supply-chain and impact its ability to pay suppliers.

The company is considering a bankruptcy filing for its U.S. unit TK Holdings, sources told Reuters. [nL4N1D45WT]

Separate sources have told Reuters that automakers, which have been footing most of the recall costs, remain divided over whether a restructuring process should be court-ordered or a privately-arranged agreement.

While a court-ordered process would ensure transparency in identifying Takata's liabilities and offer automaker clients legal cover when convincing shareholders to approve any deal, sources say carmakers may stand to recoup more recall costs from Takata under a turnaround plan arranged out-of-court.

A senior executive at Honda Motor Co <7267.T>, Takata's biggest customer, on Friday declined to comment on its preference for a restructuring plan, but said any agreement should make the stable supply of replacement parts a priority. [nT9N1EA027]

UPDATE 3-U.S. business leaders express concerns to Trump about travel ban - 路透新闻

{{20170203T191950.226+0000}}UPDATE 3-U.S. business leaders express concerns to Trump about travel ban(Adds comments from Trump, Blackstone CEO)

By Emily Stephenson and David Shepardson

WASHINGTON, Feb 3 (Reuters) - Chief executives of major U.S. companies huddled with President Donald Trump at the White House on Friday and some of them expressed concern about a travel ban on people from seven Muslim-majority countries traveling to the United States.

Business leaders said afterward that the group, which included Jamie Dimon of JP Morgan Chase & Co and Indra Nooyi of PepsiCo Inc , discussed bank rules, tax reform, and objections to Trump's week-old ban.

Some companies are worried that the travel restrictions will impact their employees or create uncertainty that could rattle markets. Tech companies also have broader concerns about Trump's immigration policies because of the number of foreign workers they employ in the United States.

The U.S. business community has been divided in their approach on taxes and immigration, and some leaders are wary of working with a president who uses his platform to attack companies that vex him, such as threatening penalties for manufacturing outside the United States.

Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly delivered an update to the corporate leaders on the travel restrictions, which caused chaos at major U.S. airports and are now facing court challenges. [nL1N1FO0NZ]

"There was obviously concern by different people and explanations and that issue had to be covered and was covered," Blackstone Group Chief Executive Stephen Schwarzman, who leads the advisory group, said on Fox Business.

Participants including Elon Musk of Tesla Inc had said before the meeting that they would raise concerns with Trump about the travel crackdown.

The meeting, which also included Mary Barra of General Motors Co and Jim McNerney, formerly of Boeing Co , convened a business advisory panel that Trump announced in December.

Uber CEO Travis Kalanick quit the group under pressure from activists over the order. Musk defended his own decision to participate on Friday, saying that going to the meeting did not mean he agreed with Trump's actions. [nL1N1FN21P]

The White House said in a statement on Thursday evening that did not mention Uber that Trump "understands the importance of an open dialogue with fellow business leaders to discuss how to best make our nation's economy stronger."

Executives from Ford Motor Co also criticized the ban, but others, including General Motors and JPMorgan Chase have not taken a position.

SPLIT ON TAX REFORM

Trump has also met with executives from the U.S. pharmaceutical and auto industries as part of a push to step up U.S. job creation.

Division in the corporate world is also developing over taxes. Boeing Co and General Electric Co on Thursday joined a group in support of a congressional plan to tax all imports. But that plan, which does not have universal support among Republicans, is opposed by many U.S. retailers, which say it could raise prices for consumers.

"If you're a big U.S. manufacturer and exporter, you love it. And if you're a retailer bringing a lot of your stuff in, it has ramifications for you," Jack Welch, the former GE chief executive, said on Fox Business after the meeting. "It's not a simple issue."

Republican leaders say tax reform is a top priority, but they have acknowledged it could take until the end of 2017 or longer to finish legislation. [nL1N1FG27W]

"If I were a company, I'd be worried about tax reform," said Bernie Williams, chief investment officer at USAA Investment Solutions, in San Antonio.

The White House meeting with the group is also set to cover trade, regulatory relief and infrastructure.

U.S. CEOs to meet with Trump amid tension over his policies - 路透新闻

{{20170203T110001.721+0000}}U.S. CEOs to meet with Trump amid tension over his policiesBy Emily Stephenson and David Shepardson

WASHINGTON, Feb 3 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump will huddle with chief executives of major U.S. companies on Friday as the business community finds itself increasingly split over how to respond to his policies.

Uber CEO Travis Kalanick on Thursday quit the business leaders' group, a panel selected by Trump in December, under pressure from activists over Trump's week-old executive order halting travel to the United States for people from seven Muslim-majority countries. [nL1N1FN21P]

Executives from Ford Motor Co and Tesla Inc also criticized Trump's travel ban, but other advisory group members, including General Motors Co and JPMorgan Chase & Co have not taken a position.

Trump previously met with executives from the U.S. pharmaceutical and auto industries as part of a push to step up U.S. job creation.

U.S. companies of all political stripes want Trump, a Republican, to fulfill a campaign pledge to slash corporate taxes, but a schism has developed over how to do it.

The splits highlight business leaders' struggles to navigate a divisive political environment and a new president who does not hesitate to use his platform against companies that vex him.

The businessman-turned-politician has threatened companies that manufacture in Mexico with a 20 percent tax on imports and needled pharmaceutical executives to make more drugs in the United States. On Thursday, he publicly cheered South Korea's Samsung Electronics Co <005930.KS> for saying it might build a U.S. plant for its home appliances business.

Some investors want companies to speak up.

"I certainly don't think investors want people who run corporate America to be afraid of making smart business decisions," Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities, said in an interview on Thursday.

The sharpest outcry about Trump's travel restrictions, which caused chaos and protests at U.S. airports last weekend, came from tech companies, which have broad concerns about his immigration plans.

Uber criticized the ban but took heat from activists when its chief competitor, Lyft, appeared more vocal on the issue.

"Joining the group was not meant to be an endorsement of the president," Kalanick said in a memo explaining why he left Trump's advisory panel.

Tesla's Elon Musk said in a tweet on Thursday: "In tomorrow's meeting, I and others will express our objections to the recent executive order on immigration and offer suggestions for changes to the policy."

The White House said in a statement on Thursday evening that did not mention Uber that Trump "understands the importance of an open dialogue with fellow business leaders to discuss how to best make our nation's economy stronger."

SPLIT ON TAX REFORM

A more complicated division is developing over taxes. Boeing Co and General Electric Co on Thursday joined a group in support of a congressional plan to tax all imports. But that plan, which does not have universal support among Republicans, is opposed by many U.S. retailers, which say it could raise prices for consumers.

Republican leaders say tax reform is a top priority, but they have acknowledged it could take until the end of 2017 or longer to finish legislation. [nL1N1FG27W]

"If I were a company, I'd be worried about tax reform," said Bernie Williams, chief investment officer at USAA Investment Solutions, in San Antonio.

The White House meeting with the group, which also includes leaders of the Cleveland Clinic, PepsiCo Inc and IBM Corp , is set to cover tax and trade, regulatory relief and infrastructure.

Ford upbeat on local sales despite safety recall in South Africa - 路透新闻

{{20170203T074822.266+0000}}Ford upbeat on local sales despite safety recall in South AfricaCAPE TOWN, Feb 3 (Reuters) - U.S. auto-maker Ford said on Friday sales of its vehicles in South Africa remained resilient, despite a challenging start to the year as safety concerns led to the recall of thousands of vehicles, a senior company official said.

In January, Ford recalled around 4,500 Kuga SUVs sold in South Africa after dozens of reports of the vehicles catching fire spontaneously due to engine overheating. [nL5N1F63OE]

With a total of 6,634 vehicles sold last month, Ford sales were up 1.7 percent compared to the same month last year, while the company's overall market share was 14.5 percent, Ford said in a statement.

"We are encouraged by and grateful for the continued customer confidence in the Ford brand... despite the challenges relating to the safety recall announced in January for the 1.6-litre Kuga sold in South Africa in 2013 and 2014," said Gerhard Herselman, general manager for sales at Ford's sub-Saharan region.

He said Ford was committed to addressing customer concerns as it sought to limit the impact among affected customers who complain that Ford was tardy in its response to the Kuga problem.

South Africa's new vehicle sales rose 3.7 percent year-on-year to 50,333 units in January, data from the trade and industry department showed this week. [nJ8N1DH00B]

Australia new vehicle sales edge higher in Jan-VFACTS - 路透新闻

{{20170203T010001.091+0000}}Australia new vehicle sales edge higher in Jan-VFACTSSYDNEY, Feb 3 (Reuters) - Australian new vehicle sales edged higher in January, maintaining the momentum of last year's record pace as buyers continued to flock to sport utility vehicles.

The Australian Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries' VFACTS report out on Friday showed 84,910 new vehicles were sold in January, up 0.6 percent on the same month last year. Some 1.178 million vehicles were sold in 2016, an all-time high.

Private buyers returned to the market in force, taking 7.7 percent more SUVs than in January last year, as businesses and government sales pulled back.

"Coming off the back of another record sales year, we're pleased to see a modest gain, with private buyers active in the market," said FCAI chief executive, Tony Weber.

Total sales of SUVs were up 3.2 percent on last year, while passenger cars dipped 0.8 percent continuing a long-running switch between the two.

Sales of light commercial vehicles dipped 3.9 percent after a run of strong months, while sales in the heavy vehicle market jumped 20.9 percent.

Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T> retained first place on the sales ladder but with a reduced share of 14.8 percent. In contrast, Mazda Motor Corp <7261.T> had a barnstorming month to take 11.9 percent of the market.

The Holden unit of General Motors took third spot with 8.5 percent, topping Hyundai Motor <005380.KS> at 7.9 percent. Ford followed with 7.0 percent of the market.

UPDATE 1-Tata Motors says set for first TAMO brand car launch next month - 路透新闻

{{20170202T171013.360+0000}}UPDATE 1-Tata Motors says set for first TAMO brand car launch next month* TAMO cars to act as pilot for new technologies

* First TAMO-branded car to be launched in March

* Co to reduce number of car platforms to achieve scale, cut costs

(Adds details, comments from company executives)

By Aditi Shah and Euan Rocha

MUMBAI, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Indian carmaker Tata Motors said on Thursday it was set to launch the first car under its new TAMO brand next month, with the brand aimed at testing new technologies and enabling the company to become more responsive to changing market trends.

"This is about proof of concept ... about bringing new technologies and ideas fast to the market," Managing Director Guenter Butschek told reporters at an event in Mumbai.

"Eventually we will decide to take some of these concepts into the mainstream," he said.

Butschek did not disclose how much has been invested so far but the first car under the brand will be launched at the Geneva Motor show in March, the company said in a statement, without giving further details.

Trade magazine Autocar has said that the first TAMO car will be a two-seater, mid-engined sportscar, internally called the Futuro.

Tata Motors, which owns the British luxury carmaker Jaguar Land Rover, has previously faced criticism for being slow to react to changing trends and has lost market share as a result.

The company now expects TAMO to help it meet its target of becoming one of India's three biggest carmakers by the end of March 2019 as it helps reposition the brand image.

Organised like a start-up, TAMO could employ people from outside the industy who will focus on sourcing new technologies and forming partnerships to develop new transport concepts, the company said.

PRODUCTION OVERHAUL

Tata Motors, maker of the loss-making Nano small car, also said on Thursday it was restructuring its passenger vehicles business in India, which includes reducing the number of car platforms from six to two to improve production efficiencies.

The two modular platforms, to be introduced in 2018, will carry different powertrains including hybrid and electric, and a wide range of different body designs including hatchbacks, crossovers and sport-utility vehicles (SUVs).

The platforms will enable Tata Motors to widen its product range, taking it into market segments where it has previously not been, the company said, adding that it has seen a shift in demand towards premium hatchbacks and SUVs and away from saloon cars.

While some of Tata Motors' existing and recently-launched cars will be built on the new platform, the shift will naturally allow it to phase out older models that it does not see potential for, Butschek said.

The company is also reviewing its supplier base and plans to drastically reduce the number of suppliers, he said.

UPDATE 2-Autoliv shares fall as heavy investments drag down earnings - 路透新闻

{{20170202T143512.846+0000}}UPDATE 2-Autoliv shares fall as heavy investments drag down earnings* Sees FY adj margin of 8.5 pct vs consensus 8.8 pct

* Sees 2017 organic sales +4 pct vs consensus 4.7 pct

* Q4 organic sales +1 pct vs consensus +2.5 pct

* Says North American sales hit by weakness of some models

* Shares fall 7 pct

(Writes through with detail, background, share)

Feb 2 (Reuters) - Airbag and seatbelt maker Autoliv said 2017 would be a year of heavy investments after it won business from ailing Japanese rival Takata and forecast weaker than expected profitability, sending its shares down more than 7 percent.

Stockholm-based Autoliv's sales have grow as carmakers replace millions of Takata <7312.T> airbag inflators, a costly ramp-up that coincides with spending on emerging technologies such as autonomous driving and driver assistance systems.

"They delivered an outlook that's weaker than people had expected in terms of organic growth and margin," said Handelsbanken Capital Markets analyst Hampus Engellau. "And that shows that this entire year will be affected by them having to invest heavily in the business."

Autoliv said it expected an adjusted operating margin of around 8.5 percent this year on sales growth of about 4 percent on an organic basis, which strips out the impact of currency swings and acquisitions. A Reuters poll of analysts had forecast organic sales growth of 4.7 percent and a margin of 8.8 percent.

While Autoliv had previously flagged the need for investment, it said on Thursday net spending on R&D and engineering was expected to be at the high end of a range of 6.5-7.0 percent of sales, a significant increase over 2016.

It also saw capital spending at the high end of its forecast range.

Stockholm-listed shares in Autoliv fell 7.1 pct by 1319 GMT, sharply underperforming an index of European automotive stocks <.SXAP>.

Also weighing on the shares was a smaller than expected 1 percent increase in like-for-like sales in the fourth quarter, well short of the 2.5 percent seen by analysts, held back by a slowdown in North American business.

Autoliv said a sales slump in the region was driven by declines for some car models from automakers Ford , FCA and General Motors as well as lower sales of replacement inflators for airbags.

The company, which reports in U.S. dollars though it is based in Sweden, said fourth-quarter operating earnings fell to $239 million from $281 million a year ago, in line with the mean forecast of $238 mln in Reuters poll of analysts.

UPDATE 2-Canada January auto sales climb, set record for month - 路透新闻

{{20170201T224527.683+0000}}UPDATE 2-Canada January auto sales climb, set record for month(Adds analyst comment, estimate of total Canadian sales)

By Susan Taylor

TORONTO, Feb 1 (Reuters) - Canadian car and light truck sales rose 2.2 percent in January over last year to an all-time record for the month, DesRosiers Automotive Consultants said on Wednesday, as the big Detroit Three automakers posted gains that contrasted with U.S. declines.

Total sales in Canada climbed to 110,945 light vehicles in January, up from 108,572 in the same month last year, DesRosiers said, beating the previous record-setting January sales of 110,266 vehicles in 2002.

Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV's Canadian arm topped the industry in January, with 16.6 percent of the market, and Ford Motor Co's Canadian unit ran second, with a 15.5 percent market share, according to DesRosiers, which compiles industry market research and is considered one of Canada's leading auto analysts.

"It is too early to comment with certainty on how the market will perform this year, as January is rarely a reliable indicator, but this is at least a positive start," said Dennis DesRosiers, president of the consultancy.

FCA Canada said sales increased 2.0 percent in January, over the same month last year, to 18,443 vehicles. Higher-profit retail sales to individual consumers, which U.S. automakers are pushing, were 75 percent of sales, it said. Bulk fleet sales were 25 percent of its overall sales.

Ford Motor Co of Canada said sales increased 3.5 percent to 17,232 vehicles. Truck sales rose 6.1 percent to 15,371 vehicles, offsetting a 13.9 drop in car sales to 1,861 vehicles.

General Motors Co said its Chevrolet, GMC and Cadillac dealers in Canada sold 14,605 vehicles in January, up 1.5 percent from the same period last year. Sales of Chevrolet vehicles gained 4 percent, Buick models 40 percent and GM utility vehicles 14 percent, while Cadillac sales dropped 19 percent, it said.

Honda Canada Inc <7267.T> reported a 2.0 percent increase in January sales, to 10,173 vehicles, as Honda sales climbed 2.0 percent to 9,131 vehicles to offset a 2 percent drop in Acura sales, to 1,042 vehicles.

Monthly U.S. vehicle sales declined from strong year-ago levels as automakers scaled back bulk sales to focus on retail sales, but the numbers were still better than analysts expected.[nL1N1FM0Q7]

January sales fell 1.8 percent to 1.14 million vehicles, or a seasonally adjusted annualized rate of 17.61 million vehicles, down from 17.9 million vehicles a year earlier, according to Autodata. The annualized rate was roughly in line with a forecast of 17.55 million in a poll by Thomson Reuters.

Industry executives are optimistic 2017 U.S. sales could reach another record, lifted by policies expected from President Trump.

UPDATE 3-U.S. car, truck sales downshift in January; Toyota falls 11 pct - 路透新闻

{{20170201T210924.406+0000}}UPDATE 3-U.S. car, truck sales downshift in January; Toyota falls 11 pct(Adds final sales figures)

By Bernie Woodall

DETROIT, Feb 1 (Reuters) - U.S. car and light truck sales slipped 1.8 percent in January as automakers pulled back on bulk sales to rental, government and business fleets and concentrated on more profitable retail sales to individual consumers.

Fleet sales, particularly those to rental agencies, are skewed toward passenger cars, which are falling out of favor as consumers shift to sport utility vehicles and trucks.

"It is the year for trucks and crossovers (SUVs). That's what it's all about," said Judy Wheeler, head of U.S. sales for the Nissan <7201.T> brand. Nissan's Rogue SUV continued to be its top seller as sales soared 45.5 percent in January.

Autodata Corp showed that 62.6 percent of January U.S. sales were of SUVs and trucks, up from 58.2 percent a year ago.

January sales fell 1.8 percent to 1.14 million vehicles, or a seasonally adjusted annualized rate of 17.61 million vehicles, down from 17.9 million vehicles a year earlier, according to Autodata. The annualized rate was roughly in line with the forecast of 17.55 million in a poll of 40 economists by Thomson Reuters.

Industry executives are optimistic that sales could hit another record in 2017, with a boost from pro-growth economic and regulatory policies expected from President Donald Trump. Many forecasters had earlier predicted a decline in U.S. vehicle sales this year.

Even with U.S. consumer confidence falling in January, households remained upbeat about the labor market, suggesting the economy would continue to grow this year. [nL1N1FL0PD]

General Motors Co posted a 3.8 percent decline in January sales from a year ago, while crosstown rival Ford Motor Co said overall sales slipped by 0.6 percent.

Ford's high-margin F-Series pickup truck sales jumped by 12.5 percent, but passenger cars sales dropped 17.5 percent.

Honda Motor Co Ltd <7267.T> and Nissan Motor Co Ltd <7201.T> both had sales gains of 6 percent in January, but Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T> reported a surprising drop of 11 percent.

Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV said January sales slid 11 percent, reflecting a cut in deliveries to fleets. Sales of its Jeep brand of sport utilities fell 7 percent.

Still, the latest results highlighted the accelerating shift in consumer demand toward SUVs. Three Japanese-brand compact utility vehicles, the Honda CR-V, Nissan Rogue and Toyota RAV 4, each handily outsold last year's best-selling car, the Toyota Camry.

Automakers have been scrambling to ramp up capacity to build more SUVs, even as they cut production at car plants.

Some analysts cautioned against reading too much into January's results. December's surprisingly good showing pulled sales from January, normally the weakest month of the year in terms of sales volume, analysts said.

December consumer confidence reached its strongest in 15 years. [nL1N1EM0J8]

Waymo's self-driving cars improve performance in California tests - 路透新闻

{{20170201T200620.400+0000}}Waymo's self-driving cars improve performance in California testsBy Paul Lienert

Feb 1 (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc's Waymo said its fleet of self-driving vehicles logged more than 600,000 miles last year on public roads in California, while rival Tesla Inc reported operating autonomous vehicles for just 550 miles on public roads since last October, according to reports released on Wednesday by the state's Department of Motor Vehicles.

California requires auto companies and suppliers who test their self-driving vehicles on public roads to provide an annual compilation of miles traveled in autonomous mode and the number of "disengagements," or times the self-driving system was deactivated and control handed back to humans because of a system failure or a traffic, weather or road situation that required human intervention.

Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk has said the company plans to install new hardware and software to enable fully autonomous driving in Tesla vehicles before the end of the year. Tesla's four self-driving test vehicles compiled 550 miles, with a disengagement every 3.5 miles.

Waymo, the former Google auto unit that was renamed last fall, operated a fleet of 60 autonomous vehicles last year on California roads. While increasing miles traveled by 50 percent, it said the number of self-driving disengagements fell by 75 percent to 124, an average of one every 5,000 miles.

Automakers are testing autonomous vehicles in several states and on private tracks - activity that would not be covered by the California reporting requirement. Autonomous driving systems, like other artificial intelligence programs, become more reliable and accurate by accumulating data either from simulations or real world testing.

General Motors Co and its Cruise Automation affiliate logged nearly 10,000 miles in self-driving vehicles on California roads, many of them Chevrolet Bolts.

GM's Cruise tested a fleet of electric vehicles, including 20 Bolts and five Nissan Leafs, equipped with self-driving systems, noting the number of disengagements fell as miles traveled increased in the latter half of the year. GM/Cruise averaged a disengagement every 50 miles.

Nissan Motor Co <7267.T> tested a fleet that included three Leafs and two Infiniti Q50 sedans, logging 4,000 miles with a disengagement every 150 miles.

Ford Motor Co and Daimler AG's Mercedes-Benz said their self-driving vehicles logged fewer than 1,000 miles each last year in California, while Honda Motor Co <7267.T> and Volkswagen AG said they did not test self-driving vehicles on public roads in the state.

Besides California, three other states allow operation of self-driving vehicles on public roads and several others are considering similar legislation.

U.S. Jan auto sales seen down 3 pct, but industry still rolling - 路透新闻

{{20170201T140150.523+0000}}U.S. Jan auto sales seen down 3 pct, but industry still rollingBy Bernie Woodall

DETROIT, Feb 1 (Reuters) - Automakers on Wednesday are likely to report a 3 percent decline in U.S. auto sales for January after a surprisingly strong December stole some thunder from the start of the new year, industry analysts and economists said.

Still, with December's good showing pulling sales from January, normally the weakest month of the year in terms of sales volume, some analysts cautioned against putting too much emphasis on the month's annualized selling rate.

The 11 analysts polled by Reuters in Detroit showed expectations of an annualized selling rate of 17.4 million vehicles. A wider poll of 40 economists by Thomson Reuters showed estimates of 17.55 million vehicles on the annualized basis.

The overall U.S. auto market remained on a roll, with rising sales for the past seven years, and record highs for the past two, they said. Each month, auto sales are an early indicator of U.S. consumer spending.

Last year ended surprisingly strong. December U.S. sales were 18.43 million on a seasonally adjusted annualized basis, far outpacing expectations of 17.7 million vehicles.

A Reuters poll of industry analysts showed expectations that General Motors Co sales fell about 2 percent, and guesses ranged from down 9 percent to up 3 percent.

At Ford Motor Co , analysts expected, on average, that January sales dropped 3 percent, with estimates ranging from down 7 percent to up 2 percent.

Fiat Chrysler Automobiles sales were seen dropping 16 percent, and analysts forecast stretched from between 14 percent and 18 percent.

German carmakers see no way around post-Brexit tariffs - 路透新闻

{{20170131T135347.502+0000}}German carmakers see no way around post-Brexit tariffsBy Edward Taylor and Costas Pitas

FRANKFURT/LONDON, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Germany's auto industry is losing hope that trade tariffs with Britain can be avoided, several executives have told Reuters, despite warnings from British Prime Minister Theresa May that an overly tough stance on post-Brexit commerce would seriously harm the country's EU partners.

"Merkel may force us to walk away from UK profits for the sake of preventing further EU fragmentation," said a senior executive at a German luxury carmaker.

The executive, who asked not to be identified because of the subject's sensitivity, said Brexit looks increasingly likely to be "a disaster" for trade and for German manufacturers.

BMW , along with the Germany-based European arms of GM and Ford , which all have UK plants, know trade barriers would bring large, currently incalculable costs.

Under World Trade Organization (WTO) rules, British exports of complete vehicles could be subject to tariffs of up to 10 percent.

Ford, Britain's biggest engine maker, warned of 2.7 percent duties on engines ahead of last June's Brexit referendum.

Duties on components such as gear boxes and brakes shipped from Britain would likely vary around the 3.7 percent average currently levied by the EU on similar imports from third countries, according to the WTO, unless a preferential deal is struck.

May recently vowed to take Britain out of the EU single market that allows tariff-free trade in order to gain more control over immigration.

At the same time May argued for the "greatest possible" market access. But German Chancellor Angela Merkel responded that London should not get an attractive Brexit deal that might encourage other departures. [nB4N1DJ017]

GERMANS WORST HIT

Much is at stake for carmakers in general, and the Germans in particular. About every other car built in Britain is destined for another EU market. German-owned brands claim more than one-third of UK car sales.

Think tank Civitas estimates that if Britain leaves the EU without a trade deal, German automotive exporters would pay 1.8 billion pounds ($2.3 billion) in tariffs, nearly half the total 3.9 billion pounds faced by EU-based firms.

UK-built vehicles and parts, on the other hand, would be hit by tariffs of around 1.3 billion pounds, according to the group.

But German car bosses are unwilling to undermine Merkel's position. Merkel recently reiterated that EU governments would not negotiate Brexit terms until London had triggered the irreversible "article 50" leaving process, before adding pointedly that business leaders should show similar restraint.

That sentiment was quickly echoed by Matthias Wissmann, head of Germany's influential auto industry lobby, the VDA.

"Everything must be done to allow the unfettered flow of goods and services," he told reporters. "But there is one clear priority: we must stand together among the 27 EU member states."

Wissmann's counterpart at Britain's SMMT car industry group also warned UK lawmakers that BMW, Daimler and VW may not push too hard for free trade.

German carmakers see "Europe as more important than the UK market", SMMT chief Mike Hawes told a parliamentary committee in January. "They will align with what is best for Germany."

BMW employs in the region of 8,000 workers in Britain, including at its plants which export roughly 2.4 billion pounds of vehicles and engines, most notably a large majority of the Mini and Rolls-Royce cars assembled there.

Ford, which has warned against tariffs, builds engines in Dagenham and Bridgend for vehicles assembled in mainland Europe. GM builds Opel/Vauxhall Astras on Britain's west coast and expects Brexit to have wiped $400 million from 2016 earnings.

"We are worried," said a director at the German unit of a major global carmaker. "I don't expect there will be special deals for any industry."

TARIFFS UPON TARIFFS

Trade duties on components, which can cross the Channel several times before a vehicle is assembled, would require costly supply-chain upheaval to avoid a compounding of duties.

Raw castings from mainland Europe are machined into engine blocks at BMW's Hams Hall plant near Birmingham. Many are then shipped to Germany and fitted into cars destined for the UK.

In all, UK car plants purchase 59 percent of their components overseas, and two-thirds of those from the EU, the SMMT says. Even where cross-Channel supply chains stayed viable, border formalities would hurt delivery timings, raising warehousing costs and ultimately consumer prices.

Locally made components would become more attractive for British-built cars, but the UK assembly plants could find it harder to win new vehicle programmes in the first place.

Investing in an assembly line for the British market alone - rather than export - becomes viable only above an annual output of about 150,000 vehicles, industry experts explain.

For many models, Exane BNP analyst Dominic O'Brien said, "the UK market is not necessarily big enough to sustain its own dedicated plant." Again, consumer choice and prices suffer.

Some German carmakers have been more vocal in urging Britain to give ground, stressing attachment to their EU workers' freedom of movement.

"Not only free trade but also cross-border employment opportunities ... are of proven benefit to business," BMW said.

Still, huge unknowns remain, including French and German elections this year that could change the direction of Brexit.

Already there are some signs of dissent within the governing coalition between Merkel's conservative CDU and its Social Democrat SPD junior partner.

Brexit should be used to spur EU reform, not deter would-be leavers, SPD Economy Minister Sigmar Gabriel said last week.

"We should not purely focus on Brexit as a threat," he said. "Should we reach a good result in negotiations with the UK, it could serve as an example for a Europe of different speeds." ($1 = 0.8011 pounds)
