* Nasser set to retire on Sept. 1

By James Regan

SYDNEY, June 29 (Reuters) - BHP Billiton's Chairman Jac Nasser said on Thursday BHP's $20 billion investment in U.S. shale oil and gas six years ago was, in hindsight, a mistake.

BHP entered the shale business at the height of the fracking boom in 2011 and invested billions more developing the operations. The fall in oil prices since then has led to pre-tax writedowns of about $13 billion on the business.

Activist shareholder and hedge fund Elliott Management, holding 4.1 percent of BHP's London-listed shares, has been trying to gain support from other shareholders to persuade BHP to sell the shale oil and gas business.

"If you had to turn the clock back, and if we knew what we knew today, we wouldn't do it, of course we wouldn't do it, but go back and put yourself in our position at that time," Nasser told a business seminar, referring to the shale purchase.

"We bought exactly what we thought we were buying, but the timing was way off."

New York-based Elliott has directed a barrage of criticism at the global miner since releasing a list of changes in April it wants the company to implement. [nL3N1HI3HI]

Its list includes an exit from shale, removal of BHP's dual London and Australian stock listings and greater emphasis on shareholder returns.

Nasser would not comment on Elliott's proposal. But he defended BHP's performance, saying the company's shareholder returns were up 486 percent since BHP merged with Billiton Plc in 2001.

BHP Chief Executive Andrew Mackenzie told a conference in May the company was considering divesting some shale acreage, although it believed the assets were "well-placed for the future."

Australian wealth management group Escala and fund Tribeca Investment Partners have also campaigned for a revamp at BHP, calling for board changes and reviews of the energy operations.

Nasser, a former head of Ford Motor Co. is scheduled to retire as chairman on Sept. 1. The appointment of Nasser's successor, Ken MacKenzie, a former packaging industry executive, has been welcomed by Elliott as a "constructive step in bringing much needed change to the direction of BHP."

High-tech dashboards signal big changes for auto parts suppliers - 路透新闻

{{20170629T050002.570+0000}}High-tech dashboards signal big changes for auto parts suppliersBy Alexandria Sage

SAN FRANCISCO, June 29 (Reuters) - Peer at the instrument panel on your new car and you may find sleek digital gauges and multicolored screens. But a glimpse behind the dashboard could reveal what U.S. auto supplier Visteon Corp found: a mess.

As automotive cockpits become crammed with ever more digital features such as navigation and entertainment systems, the electronics holding it all together have become a rat's nest of components made by different parts makers.

Now the race is on to clean up the clutter.

Visteon is among a slew of suppliers aiming to make dashboard innards simpler, cheaper and lighter as the industry accelerates toward a so-called virtual cockpit - an all-digital dashboard that will help usher in the era of self-driving cars.

What's at stake is a piece of the $37-billion cockpit electronics market, estimated by research firm IHS Market to nearly double to $62 billion by 2022. Accounting firm PwC estimates that electronics could account for up to 20 percent of a car's value in the next two years, up from 13 percent in 2015.

Meanwhile, the number of suppliers for those components is likely to dwindle as automakers look to work with fewer companies capable of doing more, according to Mark Boyadjis, principal automotive analyst at IHS Markit.

"The complexity of engineering ten different systems from ten different suppliers is no longer something an automaker wants to do," Boyadjis said.

He estimates manufacturers eventually will work with two to three cockpit suppliers for each model, down from six to 10 today.

DIGITAL MAKEOVER

One of Visteon's solutions is a computer module dubbed "SmartCore." This cockpit domain controller operates a vehicle's instrument cluster, infotainment system and other features, all on the same tiny piece of silicon.

So far this year, the Detroit-based company has landed two big contracts for undisclosed sums. One, announced in April, is with China's second-largest automaker, Dongfeng Motor Corp. The other is with Mercedes-Benz , Reuters has learned. Mercedes did not respond to requests for comment. Another unnamed European automaker plans to use the system in 2018, according to Visteon.

Visteon is going all in on cockpit electronics, having shed its remaining automotive climate and interiors businesses in 2016. The bet so far is paying off. The company secured $1.5 billion in new business in the first quarter, helped by growth in China. Visteon's stock price is up more than 50 percent over the past year.

It's a major turnaround since Visteon was spun off from Ford Motor Co a decade ago. Visteon filed for bankruptcy protection in 2009 before emerging a year later.

"You have to be changing and adapting fast. If not, you're not going to keep up in this market," said Tim Yerdon, Visteon's head of global marketing. "It's about reinventing yourself to stay ahead."

DASHBOARD DEALS

Visteon's makeover hints at the coming battle between suppliers fighting for real estate in the digital cockpit. The trend is already triggering acquisitions, as companies look to boost their offerings to automakers.

Visteon in 2014 bought Johnson Controls' electronics business, which was also developing a domain controller. In March, Samsung <005930.KS> completed its $8-billion purchase of infotainment company Harman. France's Faurecia , a top seating and interiors supplier, last year purchased a 20 percent stake in Paris-based infotainment firm Parrot Automotive SAS in a deal that could make Faurecia the biggest shareholder by 2019.

Deal-making in the wider automotive sector has been at a fever pitch over the past two years fueled by the race to develop autonomous vehicle technology. [nL1N1HK206] Activity in the sector was worth $41 billion in 2016, according to PwC.

Analysts say German automakers are taking the lead in consolidating functions within the dashboard. Audi was the first to debut a virtual cockpit last year that combined its instrument cluster and infotainment system.

CHEAPER, LIGHTER, SMARTER

Streamlined dashboards can lead to cost reductions for manufacturers, who can save as much as $175 per car with an integrated cockpit, according to Munich-based management consulting firm Roland Berger.

They can also help with fuel efficiency. That's because vehicles are lighter when there are fewer behind-the-scenes computers, known as electronic control units (ECUs). Vehicles today contain 80 to 120 ECUs, numbers expected to fall sharply in coming years.

But perhaps the biggest motivation for fancy cockpits is sales. Drivers accustomed to the seamless technology of their smartphones are finding today's dashboard offerings clunky and non-intuitive. A J.D. Power study released this month found the most complaints from new vehicle owners stemmed from audio, communications, entertainment and maps systems.

Better cockpits could prove crucial to attracting younger consumers, who are not showing the same enthusiasm for cars, or even driving, that their parents did. Research company Mintel found that 41 percent of millennial car buyers are interested in having the latest technology in their vehicles.

Disjointed dashboards "are one of the most noticeable gaps in user experience - what you see right in front of you," said Andrew Hart of UK-based consultancy SBD Automotive.

On many car models, he said, audible warning systems to alert the driver to a potential collision are not in sync with the radio, meaning your favorite song could drown out the warning beep.

"That's a crazy example of something when you don't consolidate ECUs," Hart said.

Industry watchers say this and other safe-driving features are among the systems ripe for integration. Additional targets include rear-seat entertainment systems and so-called heads-up displays that project data such as the car's speed onto the windshield for easy viewing.

Back in Detroit, Visteon says it is in talks with carmakers in China and Europe for its domain controller, a technology it hopes can give it an edge over rivals such as Delphi , Robert Bosch [ROBG.UL], Continental , and Denso <6902.T>.

While it isn't clear who will prevail, electronics suppliers are seeing their products take on new importance as vehicles become more connected.

Five years ago, the dashboard was "a plastic molded cockpit that we stuffed electronics into," said Yerdon, Visteon's marketing chief. "Now it's more about an electronic architecture that's experience-driven, and we mold plastic around it."

Auto industry groups urge caution in changing NAFTA origin rules - 路透新闻

{{20170628T224452.124+0000}}Auto industry groups urge caution in changing NAFTA origin rulesBy David Lawder

WASHINGTON, June 28 (Reuters) - Auto industry trade groups said on Wednesday that tightening the rules of origin in the North American Free Trade Agreement could be disruptive and hurt the competitiveness of U.S., Mexican and Canadian auto plants.

Their testimony at a public hearing ahead of NAFTA renegotiations, expected to start Aug. 17, contrasted sharply with frequent comments from U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross that the trade pact's local content rules are an area that needs strengthening to avoid being used as a "back door" for Chinese auto parts.

Matt Blunt, president of the American Automotive Policy Council, said the current NAFTA 62.5 percent local content requirement was working just fine and "strikes the right balance" for encouraging local manufacturing investment and keeping the industry's costs competitive.

Blunt, whose group represents Detroit automakers General Motors, Ford and Fiat Chrysler urged a "very cautions and careful" approach for any origin rule changes and discussed the affects of stricter enforcement.

"It could make us less competitive as compared to our international peers and affect our ability to export," Blunt said.

"It could deny us access to supply chains which would drive up costs and could affect sales and ultimately employment within the industry."

Ross has said that NAFTA's rules of origin need tightening to avoid producers from outside the region to benefit from tariff-free access to the U.S. market. He also has noted that vehicles now have many new electronic components that were not contemplated when the pact was negotiated in the early 1990s.

But Blunt disputed that the origin rules were allowing China to benefit from NAFTA in a major way, arguing that Chinese components make up less than six percent of the value of North American-built vehicles.

His comments were seconded by representatives of other groups, including the Motor Equipment Manufacturers Association (MEMA), representing parts makers, the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, which includes Detroit and foreign automakers building vehicles in the United States, and the Association Global Automakers, a group that represents international automakers that sell into the U.S. market.

Leigh Merino, senior director of regulatory affairs for MEMA, said auto components and subsystems in particular depend on complex "ecosystem" of diverse parts suppliers and small changes to this "can be extremely disruptive."

Nonetheless, the trade groups said that they were not opposed to examining ways to improve the rules.

The NAFTA hearings, which allow industry groups and companies to express views on the U.S. negotiating objectives for the talks are expected to conclude on Thursday.

U.S. House panel spars over self-driving car rules - 路透新闻

{{20170627T174149.102+0000}}U.S. House panel spars over self-driving car rulesBy David Shepardson

WASHINGTON, June 27 (Reuters) - Republicans and Democrats in Congress sparred on Tuesday over U.S. states setting rules for testing and deployment of self-driving cars and a proposal to allow automakers and technology companies to bypass existing regulations in introducing autonomous cars.

Democrats on a U.S. House Energy and Commerce subcommittee said that the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) must play a more aggressive role in mandating self-driving car safety.

A Republican draft package of 14 bills would allow NHTSA to exempt up to 100,000 vehicles per year from federal motor vehicle safety rules, which currently prevent the sale of self-driving vehicles without human controls. It would also bar states from setting self-driving rules and prevent NHTSA from preapproving self-driving car technologies. [nL1N1JC229]

"We simply cannot have cars that stop at state lines," Representative Robert Latta said at a hearing of the subcommittee. "This isn't the government saying you have to get in a self-driving car. This is government make sure that industry can innovate."

Latta said he hoped to win committee approval of a bipartisan legislative package by the end of July.

General Motors Co , Alphabet Inc , Tesla Inc and others have been lobbying Congress to pre-empt rules under consideration in California and other states that could limit self-driving vehicle deployment.

Representative Frank Pallone, a Democrat, said that under the Republican proposal, states would be barred from regulating self-driving car safety "without a guarantee that NHTSA will step in" to set binding rules. "We need to be sure that we get this right and that safety is the first priority," Pallone said.

Democrats noted that the administration of President Donald Trump, a Republican, has not nominated a candidate to head NHTSA, which has a number of vacant senior positions. NHTSA did not sent an official to testify.

Two automaker trade associations said in testimony it is essential they do not face a "patchwork" of self-driving state rules. They said NHTSA will have to approve exemptions.

Republicans, citing competition from other countries and the rising number of traffic deaths, say it is urgent Congress approve sweeping legislation to ensure automakers and technology companies test the vehicles inside the United States.

The administration of former Democratic President Barack Obama last year unveiled voluntary guidelines on self-driving cars. Trump's Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao has vowed to quickly update those. [nL1N1J21LZ]

Nasser, a former head of Ford Motor Co. is scheduled to retire as chairman on Sept. 1. The appointment of Nasser's successor, Ken MacKenzie, a former packaging industry executive, has been welcomed by Elliott as a "constructive step in bringing much needed change to the direction of BHP."

High-tech dashboards signal big changes for auto parts suppliers - 路透新闻

{{20170629T050002.570+0000}}High-tech dashboards signal big changes for auto parts suppliersBy Alexandria Sage

SAN FRANCISCO, June 29 (Reuters) - Peer at the instrument panel on your new car and you may find sleek digital gauges and multicolored screens. But a glimpse behind the dashboard could reveal what U.S. auto supplier Visteon Corp found: a mess.

As automotive cockpits become crammed with ever more digital features such as navigation and entertainment systems, the electronics holding it all together have become a rat's nest of components made by different parts makers.

Now the race is on to clean up the clutter.

Visteon is among a slew of suppliers aiming to make dashboard innards simpler, cheaper and lighter as the industry accelerates toward a so-called virtual cockpit - an all-digital dashboard that will help usher in the era of self-driving cars.

What's at stake is a piece of the $37-billion cockpit electronics market, estimated by research firm IHS Market to nearly double to $62 billion by 2022. Accounting firm PwC estimates that electronics could account for up to 20 percent of a car's value in the next two years, up from 13 percent in 2015.

Meanwhile, the number of suppliers for those components is likely to dwindle as automakers look to work with fewer companies capable of doing more, according to Mark Boyadjis, principal automotive analyst at IHS Markit.

"The complexity of engineering ten different systems from ten different suppliers is no longer something an automaker wants to do," Boyadjis said.

He estimates manufacturers eventually will work with two to three cockpit suppliers for each model, down from six to 10 today.

DIGITAL MAKEOVER

One of Visteon's solutions is a computer module dubbed "SmartCore." This cockpit domain controller operates a vehicle's instrument cluster, infotainment system and other features, all on the same tiny piece of silicon.

So far this year, the Detroit-based company has landed two big contracts for undisclosed sums. One, announced in April, is with China's second-largest automaker, Dongfeng Motor Corp. The other is with Mercedes-Benz , Reuters has learned. Mercedes did not respond to requests for comment. Another unnamed European automaker plans to use the system in 2018, according to Visteon.

Visteon is going all in on cockpit electronics, having shed its remaining automotive climate and interiors businesses in 2016. The bet so far is paying off. The company secured $1.5 billion in new business in the first quarter, helped by growth in China. Visteon's stock price is up more than 50 percent over the past year.

It's a major turnaround since Visteon was spun off from Ford Motor Co a decade ago. Visteon filed for bankruptcy protection in 2009 before emerging a year later.

"You have to be changing and adapting fast. If not, you're not going to keep up in this market," said Tim Yerdon, Visteon's head of global marketing. "It's about reinventing yourself to stay ahead."

DASHBOARD DEALS

Visteon's makeover hints at the coming battle between suppliers fighting for real estate in the digital cockpit. The trend is already triggering acquisitions, as companies look to boost their offerings to automakers.

Visteon in 2014 bought Johnson Controls' electronics business, which was also developing a domain controller. In March, Samsung <005930.KS> completed its $8-billion purchase of infotainment company Harman. France's Faurecia , a top seating and interiors supplier, last year purchased a 20 percent stake in Paris-based infotainment firm Parrot Automotive SAS in a deal that could make Faurecia the biggest shareholder by 2019.

Deal-making in the wider automotive sector has been at a fever pitch over the past two years fueled by the race to develop autonomous vehicle technology. [nL1N1HK206] Activity in the sector was worth $41 billion in 2016, according to PwC.

Analysts say German automakers are taking the lead in consolidating functions within the dashboard. Audi was the first to debut a virtual cockpit last year that combined its instrument cluster and infotainment system.

CHEAPER, LIGHTER, SMARTER

Streamlined dashboards can lead to cost reductions for manufacturers, who can save as much as $175 per car with an integrated cockpit, according to Munich-based management consulting firm Roland Berger.

They can also help with fuel efficiency. That's because vehicles are lighter when there are fewer behind-the-scenes computers, known as electronic control units (ECUs). Vehicles today contain 80 to 120 ECUs, numbers expected to fall sharply in coming years.

But perhaps the biggest motivation for fancy cockpits is sales. Drivers accustomed to the seamless technology of their smartphones are finding today's dashboard offerings clunky and non-intuitive. A J.D. Power study released this month found the most complaints from new vehicle owners stemmed from audio, communications, entertainment and maps systems.

Better cockpits could prove crucial to attracting younger consumers, who are not showing the same enthusiasm for cars, or even driving, that their parents did. Research company Mintel found that 41 percent of millennial car buyers are interested in having the latest technology in their vehicles.

Disjointed dashboards "are one of the most noticeable gaps in user experience - what you see right in front of you," said Andrew Hart of UK-based consultancy SBD Automotive.

On many car models, he said, audible warning systems to alert the driver to a potential collision are not in sync with the radio, meaning your favorite song could drown out the warning beep.

"That's a crazy example of something when you don't consolidate ECUs," Hart said.

Industry watchers say this and other safe-driving features are among the systems ripe for integration. Additional targets include rear-seat entertainment systems and so-called heads-up displays that project data such as the car's speed onto the windshield for easy viewing.

Back in Detroit, Visteon says it is in talks with carmakers in China and Europe for its domain controller, a technology it hopes can give it an edge over rivals such as Delphi , Robert Bosch [ROBG.UL], Continental , and Denso <6902.T>.

While it isn't clear who will prevail, electronics suppliers are seeing their products take on new importance as vehicles become more connected.

Five years ago, the dashboard was "a plastic molded cockpit that we stuffed electronics into," said Yerdon, Visteon's marketing chief. "Now it's more about an electronic architecture that's experience-driven, and we mold plastic around it."

Auto industry groups urge caution in changing NAFTA origin rules - 路透新闻

{{20170628T224452.124+0000}}Auto industry groups urge caution in changing NAFTA origin rulesBy David Lawder

WASHINGTON, June 28 (Reuters) - Auto industry trade groups said on Wednesday that tightening the rules of origin in the North American Free Trade Agreement could be disruptive and hurt the competitiveness of U.S., Mexican and Canadian auto plants.

Their testimony at a public hearing ahead of NAFTA renegotiations, expected to start Aug. 17, contrasted sharply with frequent comments from U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross that the trade pact's local content rules are an area that needs strengthening to avoid being used as a "back door" for Chinese auto parts.

Matt Blunt, president of the American Automotive Policy Council, said the current NAFTA 62.5 percent local content requirement was working just fine and "strikes the right balance" for encouraging local manufacturing investment and keeping the industry's costs competitive.

Blunt, whose group represents Detroit automakers General Motors, Ford and Fiat Chrysler urged a "very cautions and careful" approach for any origin rule changes and discussed the affects of stricter enforcement.

"It could make us less competitive as compared to our international peers and affect our ability to export," Blunt said.

"It could deny us access to supply chains which would drive up costs and could affect sales and ultimately employment within the industry."

Ross has said that NAFTA's rules of origin need tightening to avoid producers from outside the region to benefit from tariff-free access to the U.S. market. He also has noted that vehicles now have many new electronic components that were not contemplated when the pact was negotiated in the early 1990s.

But Blunt disputed that the origin rules were allowing China to benefit from NAFTA in a major way, arguing that Chinese components make up less than six percent of the value of North American-built vehicles.

His comments were seconded by representatives of other groups, including the Motor Equipment Manufacturers Association (MEMA), representing parts makers, the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, which includes Detroit and foreign automakers building vehicles in the United States, and the Association Global Automakers, a group that represents international automakers that sell into the U.S. market.

Leigh Merino, senior director of regulatory affairs for MEMA, said auto components and subsystems in particular depend on complex "ecosystem" of diverse parts suppliers and small changes to this "can be extremely disruptive."

Nonetheless, the trade groups said that they were not opposed to examining ways to improve the rules.

The NAFTA hearings, which allow industry groups and companies to express views on the U.S. negotiating objectives for the talks are expected to conclude on Thursday.

U.S. House panel spars over self-driving car rules - 路透新闻

{{20170627T174149.102+0000}}U.S. House panel spars over self-driving car rulesBy David Shepardson

WASHINGTON, June 27 (Reuters) - Republicans and Democrats in Congress sparred on Tuesday over U.S. states setting rules for testing and deployment of self-driving cars and a proposal to allow automakers and technology companies to bypass existing regulations in introducing autonomous cars.

Democrats on a U.S. House Energy and Commerce subcommittee said that the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) must play a more aggressive role in mandating self-driving car safety.

A Republican draft package of 14 bills would allow NHTSA to exempt up to 100,000 vehicles per year from federal motor vehicle safety rules, which currently prevent the sale of self-driving vehicles without human controls. It would also bar states from setting self-driving rules and prevent NHTSA from preapproving self-driving car technologies. [nL1N1JC229]

"We simply cannot have cars that stop at state lines," Representative Robert Latta said at a hearing of the subcommittee. "This isn't the government saying you have to get in a self-driving car. This is government make sure that industry can innovate."

Latta said he hoped to win committee approval of a bipartisan legislative package by the end of July.

General Motors Co , Alphabet Inc , Tesla Inc and others have been lobbying Congress to pre-empt rules under consideration in California and other states that could limit self-driving vehicle deployment.

Representative Frank Pallone, a Democrat, said that under the Republican proposal, states would be barred from regulating self-driving car safety "without a guarantee that NHTSA will step in" to set binding rules. "We need to be sure that we get this right and that safety is the first priority," Pallone said.

Democrats noted that the administration of President Donald Trump, a Republican, has not nominated a candidate to head NHTSA, which has a number of vacant senior positions. NHTSA did not sent an official to testify.

Two automaker trade associations said in testimony it is essential they do not face a "patchwork" of self-driving state rules. They said NHTSA will have to approve exemptions.

Republicans, citing competition from other countries and the rising number of traffic deaths, say it is urgent Congress approve sweeping legislation to ensure automakers and technology companies test the vehicles inside the United States.

The administration of former Democratic President Barack Obama last year unveiled voluntary guidelines on self-driving cars. Trump's Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao has vowed to quickly update those. [nL1N1J21LZ]

Kia Motors tops JD Power quality study - 路透新闻

{{20170621T200051.813+0000}}Kia Motors tops JD Power quality studyJune 21 (Reuters) - Kia Motors <000270.KS> topped an initial quality study of new vehicles sold in the United States based on owner responses for the second consecutive year, business consultancy J.D. Power said on Wednesday.

Hyundai Motor's <005380.KS> Genesis cars came second in the survey, followed by Porsche, a sports luxury brand owned by Volkswagen AG, . [nPn44Sgdva]

Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV's Ram and U.S. automaker Ford Motor Co's namesake brand shared the fourth position.

Fiat, Jaguar Land Rover's luxury car brand Jaguar and Volvo were at the bottom.

BMW's Mini was the most improved brand, with owners reporting fewer problems than in 2016. Ford was also among the brands with strong improvement in quality, the study said.

ANALYSIS-For thousands of U.S. auto workers, downturn is already here - 路透新闻

{{20170621T193526.859+0000}}ANALYSIS-For thousands of U.S. auto workers, downturn is already hereBy Nick Carey

LORDSTOWN, Ohio, June 21 (Reuters) - Wall Street is fretting that the U.S. auto industry is heading for a downturn, but for thousands of workers at General Motors Co factories in the United States, the hard times are already here.

Matt Streb, 36, was one of 1,200 workers laid off on Jan. 20 - inauguration day for Republican U.S. President Donald Trump - when GM canceled the third shift at its Lordstown small-car factory here. Sales of the Chevrolet Cruze sedan, the only vehicle the plant makes, have nosedived as U.S. consumers switch to SUVs and pickup trucks.

Streb is looking for another job, but employers are wary because they assume he will quit whenever GM calls him back. "I get it," said Streb, who has a degree in communications, "but it's frustrating."

Layoffs at Lordstown and other auto plants point to a broader challenge for the economy in Midwestern manufacturing states and for the Trump administration.

The U.S. auto industry's boom from 2010 through last year was a major driver for manufacturing job creation. The fading of that boom threatens prospects for U.S. industrial output and job creation that were central to President Trump's victory in Ohio and other manufacturing states.

"This is about economics, not what Trump says," said Robert Morales, president of United Auto Workers (UAW) union Local 1714, which represents workers at GM's stamping plant at Lordstown. "Even if Trump went out and bought 10,000 Cruzes a month, he wouldn't get the third shift back here."

Last week the Federal Reserve said U.S. factory output fell 0.4 percent in May, the second decline in three months, due partly to a 2-percent drop in motor vehicles and parts production.

Mark Muro, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, has compiled data from government sources that show the auto industry punching higher than its weight in job creation in recent years - accounting for between 60 percent and 80 percent of all U.S. manufacturing jobs added in 2015 and 2016.

In the first quarter of this year, the auto industry accounted for less than 2 percent of the 45,000 manufacturing jobs created.

"There's no argument with the idea that auto has been pulling the manufacturing sled up the mountain for the last three or four years," Muro said. "If you take auto out, you're left with a very tepid outlook indeed."

Long-term auto layoffs could threaten the economies of communities and states directly affected, although after decades of boom and bust, many communities in the auto manufacturing heartland have diversified.

In Ohio's Mahoning Valley, which was battered by the collapse of the once-dominant steel industry, the boom in drilling for shale gas helps offset job cuts at auto plants.

Lordstown Mayor Arno Hill says the town salted away money during the boom to pay down its debts and new businesses are coming in, including a $900-million power plant being built in town that will burn cheap natural gas produced in the region.

GM makes up 40 percent of tax receipts versus 85 percent in the early 1990s, he said.

"GM is still the brightest star in the Mahoning Valley, but luckily we have diversified our economy," Hill said. "There is pain for the laid-off workers, but it won't hurt us as bad it used to."

Lordstown's workers have taken steps to blunt the impact of layoffs, with help from GM.

Matt Streb's wife is due to start work soon after getting a degree, while he hopes to return to a former job as a mailman. In the meantime, GM gave advance notice of job cuts so he saved extra money and has drastically cut his spending.

"The auto industry is cyclical and has always had its ups and downs," Streb said. "This is just another Lordstown downturn."

STALLING SEDAN SALES

The decline in U.S. auto sales is still minor compared to the dramatic collapse during the 2007-2009 financial crisis, when demand for new vehicles plunged to its lowest levels in decades.

However, the days when auto assembly and parts plants throughout the Midwest were running flat-out because of high demand for nearly every type of vehicle are over. Recent sales trends show consumers becoming more selective, shunning older models and especially smaller cars.

For much of the boom that ran from 2010 through to a record year in 2016 of 17.55 million new vehicles sold, the share of cars has declined versus "light trucks" - or pickup trucks, SUVs and crossovers.

After peaking at 51.32 percent of all sales in 2012, passenger cars fell to 40.4 percent of sales in 2016. That decline equates to the output of seven or eight vehicle assembly plants.

Through the first five months of this year, sedan sales fell 11 percent, even as the light truck category rose 4.7 percent.

To avoid profit-sapping discounts, and reverse a decline in prices of used vehicles, automakers are ordering more and deeper production cuts. [nL1N1JH0GP]

GM has laid off more than 5,000 workers so far this year - including 1,000 at its Fairfax plant in Kansas that makes the Chevrolet Malibu midsize sedan. GM has also laid off 1,100 workers at a plant in Lansing because it has ended production of the GMC Acadia SUV there.

More GM workers will be hit with temporary layoffs this summer. Lordstown will shut up shop for five weeks this summer, much longer than the usual two-week summer vacation closure.

Many laid-off GM workers are finding temporary employment at other facilities or taking permanent transfers to plants like its Arlington, Texas, facility where production of large sport utility vehicles continues unabated. However, those temporary postings require workers to relocate hundreds of miles from home.

Randy Freeman, president of UAW Local 652 which represents workers at GM's Grand River plant in Lansing, Michigan, which makes sedans, says he has been pleased by GM's efforts to rehire workers and relations with the automaker "are on an upward swing."

The threats to U.S. workers building sedans are not likely to ease, barring a spike in the price of gasoline. Ford Motor Co signaled its long-term pessimism about small-car demand in the United States by announcing plans on Tuesday to shift production of its Focus compact car model to China. The Michigan plant that builds the Focus currently is expected to switch to building trucks and SUVs in 2018. [nL1N1JH0GP]

At GM's Lordstown and Lansing Grand River plants, UAW representatives say they are focused on improving quality in the hope that GM will pick their plant when it's time to find a location for producing a new truck or SUV.

At Lordstown, for instance, union officials tout the fact the plant has just won a quality award for local innovation on a part that helps the Cruz run better.

"We're working hard to make the best product we can," said Glenn Johnson, president of UAW Local 1112 at Lordstown, "so we can raise our hands and say to GM 'look at what we can do."

UPDATE 7-Ford bets on low oil prices, moves Focus production to China - 路透新闻

{{20170620T220531.896+0000}}UPDATE 7-Ford bets on low oil prices, moves Focus production to China(Adds link to related Breakingviews article in Related Content section)

By Paul Lienert and David Shepardson

DETROIT/WASHINGTON, June 20 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co said on Tuesday it will move some production of its Focus small car to China and import the vehicles to the United States in a long-term bet on low oil prices and stable U.S.-China trade relations despite recent tensions.

The move suggests China could play a much larger role in future vehicle production for North America, perhaps eclipsing Mexico as a low-cost manufacturing source.

Ford painted the production shift from Mexico to China, slated for mid-2019, as a purely financial move that will save the company $500 million in reduced tooling costs.

But Ford also expects to ship about 80,000 vehicles to China this year, including the redesigned Lincoln Navigator luxury sport utility vehicle, which goes into production this fall at Ford's Kentucky truck plant.

Ford's decision to import its first vehicles from China to the United States is also the first major manufacturing investment decision made by new Chief Executive Jim Hackett, who succeeded Mark Fields in May. Discussion about the small-car production shift from Mexico to China began "a couple months ago" under Fields, said Joe Hinrichs, president of global operations.

The decision also signals a shift in strategy at Ford, which is responding to dwindling U.S. consumer demand for small cars in favor of more expensive and more profitable trucks and SUVs. Cars accounted for more than 50 percent of U.S. auto sales as recently as 2012, but have fallen to just 37 percent of sales this year.

Ford on Tuesday said it would invest $900 million at the Kentucky truck plant to build the redesigned Navigator and Ford Expedition. It has contingency plans to build more of the big SUVs at an Ohio plant if demand grows.

In January, after U.S. President Donald Trump repeatedly criticized Ford for shipping small-car manufacturing to Mexico, Ford said it would kill plans to build a $1.8 billion Focus plant in San Luis Potosi and instead produce the new Focus at an existing plant in Hermosillo.

"The Ford decision shows how flexible multinational companies are in terms of geography," U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in a statement.

Trump did not address the issue on Tuesday.

White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said Trump "wants to create a tax system (so) that companies want to come back and bring back jobs in manufacturing here in the United States."

Although it is cheaper to build and ship cars to the United States from Mexico than China, "this was not a variable cost decision," Hinrichs said in a briefing on Tuesday. "It allows us to free up a lot of capital" because Ford now has to retool only one plant - the existing Focus factory in Chongqing - rather than two to supply North America.

The current Focus will be phased out of production in Wayne, Michigan, in mid-2018, according to Hinrichs. The Wayne plant will begin building a new Ranger midsize truck in late 2018 and a Bronco midsize SUV in 2020.

Ford executives told Trump last year that moving production to Michigan of bigger vehicles that were more profitable would secure the Wayne plant's future - a decision later praised by Trump.

No U.S. jobs will be affected by shifting Focus production to China, Ford said, adding that it employs more U.S. hourly workers and builds more vehicles in the United States than any other automaker.

The United Auto Workers labor union declined to comment.

Hinrichs said "the capital saving outweighs the risk" of having to pay a potential border tax, or import tax, on the Chinese-built Focus.

Ford U.S. Focus sales have fallen 22 percent this year, as low gas prices have helped spur more buyers into larger vehicles. Ford's full-size F-series pickup truck remains the best-selling U.S. vehicle by a wide margin.

Unlike many consumer products, few Chinese-made vehicles are sold in the United States.

General Motors Co has been exporting Buick and Cadillac vehicles from China to the United States since last year, as has Volvo Cars, a unit of Chinese automaker Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd <0175.HK>.

Ford shares closed down 1.1 percent at $11.12 on the New York Stock Exchange.

BREAKINGVIEWS-Ford's new driver veers back onto old road - 路透新闻

{{20170620T194839.093+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-Ford's new driver veers back onto old road(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.)

By Antony Currie

NEW YORK, June 20 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Ford's new driver is veering back onto an old road. Detroit's second-largest carmaker on Tuesday unveiled Jim Hackett's first major decision since being named chief executive a month ago. He's shifting production of the next-generation Ford Focus compact car for the North America market to China from Mexico. There are some decent reasons for doing so, even if it risks irking President Donald Trump.

The decision is the brainchild of ousted former boss Mark Fields, according to the steer from Joe Hinrichs, the new president of global operations who Hackett sent out to make the announcement. The shift is a smart use of capital for a declining marque. Sales of the Focus have dropped 22 percent this year, after a 17 percent fall in 2016, as low oil prices have reinvigorated Americans' love for gas-guzzling – and higher-margin – SUVs and trucks.

So it makes little sense to invest too much money in production capacity. Fields had already decided in January to ditch plans to build a fresh Mexico plant for the new Focus, which goes on sale in 2019, opting to use an existing factory. That freed up some $500 million of capital. Moving manufacturing to an existing Focus plant in China will double that. And, says Hinrichs, "the capital saving outweighs the risk" of any border taxes the White House might impose.

That's a bold statement from a corporate icon, one that breathes life back into globalization. Trump, after all, rode his "America First" rhetoric to the White House. He lambasted Ford on the campaign trail for its initial plan to move production to Mexico, prompting the company's partial retreat in January.

That said, like Fields before him, Hackett is also touting plans to invest more in the United States – this time, $900 million to build Ford Explorers and Lincoln Navigators in Kentucky.

That might appease Trump. But nothing about Tuesday's news gives shareholders any more insight into what Hackett's longer-term plans are for the company. That's in large part a function of the carmaking business: rolling out new products takes three years or more, while new autonomous and connected-car initiatives are likely to contain more promise than monetizable substance for a while yet. If nothing else, Hackett's trip down memory lane is a reminder there's no quick and easy fix to what ails Ford.

CONTEXT NEWS

- Ford Motor on June 20 said it is shifting production for the North American market of the next generation of its Focus compact car to China from Mexico. The decision will save Ford around $500 million. That's on top of the $500 million of savings former Chief Executive Mark Fields expected in January when he canceled plans to build a dedicated plant in Mexico to assemble the car, instead deciding to base production at an existing facility in the country.

- During his presidential campaign last year, Donald Trump criticized the company's earlier decision to move Focus production to Mexico.

- Under the new plan, exports of the vehicle from China to the United States will start in 2019. Production of the current-model Focus at a plant in Wayne, Michigan, will be phased out in mid-2018.

- Ford is also investing $900 million in a Kentucky truck plant to build the Ford Expedition and Lincoln Navigator.

Ford Mexico sees no immediate impact on jobs after China Focus announcement - 路透新闻

{{20170620T150446.909+0000}}Ford Mexico sees no immediate impact on jobs after China Focus announcementMEXICO CITY, June 20 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co said on Tuesday it expects no immediate impact on employment levels due to the carmaker's announcement it would be exporting its next-generation Focus compact car from China to North America in 2019, rather than Mexico.

"We expect no immediate impact on our levels of employment as a result of this decision," Ford de Mexico said in a statement after being asked by Reuters how the announcement would affect its plant in Hermosillo in northern Mexico.

"We will continue producing the Fusion and the Lincoln MKZ and its hybrid versions in Hermosillo," it added.

Ford added that its business in Mexico would continue being a "major and critical" part of its North American operations.

Ford says new Focus cars to be initially sourced from China - 路透新闻

{{20170620T124836.053+0000}}Ford says new Focus cars to be initially sourced from ChinaJune 20 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co said on Tuesday it would begin production of its next-generation Focus small car in the second half of 2019 and most of the cars for the North American market would be initially sourced from China.

"The new North America Focus production plan saves $1 billion in investment costs versus the original plan...," the company said in a statement.

Ford had earlier said it planned to import the new Focus from its plant in Hermosillo, Mexico.

Ford also said it was investing $900 million in its Kentucky truck plant for upgrades to build the all-new Ford Expedition and Lincoln Navigator SUVs, which will begin arriving in dealerships this fall.

UPDATE 2-Fiat Chrysler CEO says 2018 targets unaffected by diesel troubles - 路透新闻

{{20170616T173943.330+0000}}UPDATE 2-Fiat Chrysler CEO says 2018 targets unaffected by diesel troubles* No provisions made for potential emissions fines

* CEO will not backtrack on decision to step down in 2019

* No investor pressure to change strategy if meets 2018 goals

(Adds details, quotes)

By Agnieszka Flak

VENICE, Italy, June 16 (Reuters) - Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) does not expect its diesel problems in the United States to have an impact on its short-term business targets to 2018, Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne said on Friday.

The U.S. Justice Department sued FCA last month, accusing the Italian-American automaker of illegally using software to bypass emission controls in 104,000 diesel vehicles sold since 2014, in a move that could potentially lead to heavy fines. [nL1N1IP14G]

The company has proposed a software update as part of certifying 2017 diesel models to allow them to go on sale and then use that fix to update the 104,000 vehicles on the road.

Asked whether it could take months to get U.S. authority approval for the software fix, as suggested by a U.S. Justice Department lawyer this week, Marchionne said "we are much closer than this". [nL1N1JB1I5]

"When we made the proposal, we were ready to implement the fix immediately ... now it depends on them," Marchionne told journalists on the sidelines of a meeting in Venice of the U.S.-Italy council. "We are talking to them ... we think we have a viable solution."

He said the company had not made any provisions for any potential fines, adding it was "impossible to try estimate".

Part of the 2018 business plan, which is centred around the revamp of its Jeep, Maserati and Alfa Romeo brands, is erasing all debt and accumulating at least 4 billion euros ($4.5 billion) of cash by the end of next year.

After failing to strike a much sought alliance for FCA, Marchionne has made executing the 2018 plan his core ambition before he steps down at the end of his tenure early in the following year.

When asked whether he could rethink his decision to quit in early 2019 given political and market uncertainties surrounding his company, Marchionne, who turns 65 on Saturday, said "No."

He said there was a "wide and deep bench" of possible internal candidates to succeed him, and did not exclude the possibility of his powers being divided among several managers, although added this would be up to the board to decide.

"My job is not easy, it's a bit loaded," he said.

Marchionne said the second quarter was going in line with expectations and confirmed the targets for the full year.

Widely credited with reviving one of Italy's top corporate names and rescuing U.S. Chrysler from bankruptcy, Marchionne has seen pressure mounting in recent months, with the U.S. market at its peak and legal challenges launched in the United States and in Europe over the company's emissions credentials.

His ambition to tie up with General Motors to share the costs of making cleaner and more autonomous vehicles has been repeatedly rebuffed. While Marchionne briefly flirted with the idea of a tie-up with Volkswagen , he reiterated on Friday that there were no talks with anyone at present.

He stressed, however, that a merger for FCA was "ultimately inevitable" to be able to compete, although it might not happen during his tenure.

"The only way you're going to get that is by mass, there is no other solution," he said. "Being small, cute is going to do nothing. Go home, go to a beauty parlour and do something else."

Asked whether FCA felt the same investor pressure that led to the sacking of his counterpart at U.S. rival Ford or that which prompted GM to leave Europe, Marchionne said the 2018 plan would be his judge. [nL4N1IR42T] [nL8N1J936F]

"As long as we deliver on those commitments, you will not get pressured ... people will love you," he said. "What they do to you in 2019 is a different story." ($1 = 0.8961 euros)

VW brand CEO sees new models driving profit and sales - 路透新闻

{{20170616T113341.904+0000}}VW brand CEO sees new models driving profit and sales* 2018 will be strong year thanks to new models -brand CEO

* VW unveils larger, technology-packed Polo

* New Polo to outsell Ford, PSA, Renault competitors -IHS

BERLIN, June 16 (Reuters) - Volkswagen is making headway with efforts to raise profitability at its troubled core brand and expects strong business next year thanks to a raft of new models, the division's top executive said.

The world's largest automaker's core division is being restructured with thousands of job cuts and retrenchments in parts and vehicle development as it struggles to fund a post-dieselgate shift to electric cars and new technologies.

More than 10 new models launched this year including the top-of-the-line Arteon fastback and a redesigned Polo subcompact, one of VW's all-time bestsellers, would stoke demand and underpin the turnaround, VW brand chief executive Herbert Diess told Reuters on Friday.

"We are making good progress," Diess said during an event to present the next-generation Polo. "2018 will be a strong year for VW," he said, adding a new product always helped margins.

VW brand's operating margin jumped to 4.6 percent in the first quarter from 0.3 percent a year earlier, still lagging French rivals PSA Peugeot Citroen and Renault but nearing its long-term 2025 target of 6 percent.

Diess said VW had a goal for 2017 to maintain the brand's first-quarter performance when operating profit surged to 869 million euros from 73 million a year ago.

"The most important thing is the product offensive in coming months," Diess said.

Wolfsburg-based VW is counting on the larger, technology-packed Polo model to revive its sluggish sales in the core European market where the brand's deliveries slid 0.2 percent in the January-to-May period to 726,000 cars.

The new Polo, priced from 12,975 euros ($14,500) and due to hit showrooms in October, will be the main volume product VW launches this year, preceding the all-new T-Roc, a Golf-sized sport utility vehicle (SUV) which is due out later in 2017.

A spokesman declined to specify the new Polo's on-road nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions and whether they met EU targets, saying VW at this point only had emissions estimates for the model which cannot be disclosed.

The advent of the new Polo will intensify the struggle for dominance in Europe's crowded subcompact segment where the VW model is going up against a redesigned Ford Fiesta and an upgraded Renault Clio, all vying for the top spot.

Research firm IHS Markit expects the VW model to win easily.

European deliveries of the Polo may jump a quarter to 368,158 cars by 2025 from 293,700 this year, compared with a 2.7 percent gain to 328,846 models for the Fiesta and a 32 percent plunge to 185,525 cars for the Clio, according to IHS.

Registrations of the Peugeot 208 model may surge a fifth to 277,067 cars, IHS said.

European car sales rise 7.7 pct in May, nearing pre-crisis levels - 路透新闻

{{20170616T060001.584+0000}}European car sales rise 7.7 pct in May, nearing pre-crisis levelsMILAN, June 16 (Reuters) - European car sales rose 7.7 percent in May from the same month a year ago, industry data showed on Friday, returning to growth after a dip in April and with nearly all auto manufacturers recording sales increases.

New passenger car registrations in the European Union and European Free Trade Association increased to 1.43 million vehicles last month, according to the Brussels-based Association of European Carmakers (ACEA).

"In volume terms, this result comes close to May 2007 levels, just before the economic crisis hit the auto industry," the industry group said in a statement.

European car sales returned to annual growth in 2014 after a six-year slump during which registrations fell to their lowest in decades. Demand has been growing most months since, as an improvement in consumer confidence, retail incentives and new product launches lured customers back to the showrooms.

The May increase comes after registrations dropped the previous month, given fewer trading days around Easter and thanks to a double-digit sales decline in Britain. [nL8N1IH6NJ]

May's growth was led by Japanese carmakers Suzuki <7269.T> and Toyota <7203.T>, up 21.4 percent and 19.6 percent respectively, and Germany's Daimler , up 14 percent.

Sales from the Fiat Chrysler Automobiles stable rose 11.9 percent, as a 47.8 percent jump for sporty Alfa Romeo models helped offset a 7.3 percent drop for its Jeep SUV brand.

France's Renault recorded a 10.4 percent rise in registrations, outpacing domestic rival PSA Group , whose sales increased 4.8 percent.

Sales at Volkswagen , Europe's biggest carmaker, rose 8.4 percent, both for the group and its core namesake brand, as the German company continues to recover from its diesel emissions test-rigging scandal. Its market share remained roughly stable year-on-year at 24.3 percent.

The only carmakers to report falling sales last month were Jaguar Land Rover, down 9.3 percent, Japanese carmakers Honda and Mazda, falling 14.5 percent and 2.3 percent respectively, and Opel Group, down 1.7 percent.

All five major national markets, except for the United Kingdom, recorded sales increases last month, led by Germany, where registrations increased 12.9 percent, and followed by Spain, where sales were up 11.2 percent. UK sales dropped 8.5 percent.

In the first five months of the year, European registrations increased 5.1 percent to 6.92 million vehicles, ACEA added.

* Tokyo bourse suspends trading in Takata shares

(Adds share suspension in Tokyo)

By Jessica DiNapoli and David Shepardson

NEW YORK/WASHINGTON, June 15 (Reuters) - Takata Corp <7312.T>, the Japanese company facing billions in liabilities stemming from its defective air bag inflators, is preparing to file for bankruptcy as early as next week as it works toward a deal for financial backing from U.S. auto parts maker Key Safety Systems Inc, sources said on Thursday.

Takata, one of the world's biggest automotive suppliers, has been working for months to complete a deal with Key Safety.

A person briefed on the matter told Reuters Key was expected to acquire Takata assets as part of a restructuring in bankruptcy.

The Nikkei business daily reported that a new company created under Key will purchase Takata operations for about 180 billion yen ($1.6 billion) and continue supplying air bags, seat belts and other products, leaving liabilities behind in a separate entity.

Takata declined to comment. Michigan-based Key, owned by Chinese supplier Ningbo Joyson <600699.SS>, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The Tokyo Stock Exchange said on Friday it had suspended trading in shares of Takata following media reports of preparations for a bankruptcy filing. At its previous close, it had a market value of $360 million.

Also at stake is $850 million owed by Takata to major global automakers under a settlement agreed to earlier this year stemming from the automotive industry's largest ever safety recall.

Sources familiar with the matter, who asked for anonymity because they were not authorized to speak with the media, said a final deal with Key may not be reached before Takata files for bankruptcy. The company plans to begin proceedings in both the United States and Japan, the sources said.

Major global car manufacturers have expressed concern about the company filing for bankruptcy without a deal in place because of disruption it could cause to the production of replacement air bag inflators. More than 65 percent of 46.2 million recalled Takata air bag inflators in the United States have not been repaired.

A U.S. judge said earlier this year the costs of replacing all of the faulty Takata inflators could be $8 billion. [nL2N1GD1AS]

Takata inflators can explode with excessive force, unleashing metal shrapnel inside cars and trucks.

In January, Takata agreed to plead guilty to criminal wrongdoing and to pay $1 billion to resolve a U.S. Justice Department investigation into ruptures of its air bag inflators linked to at least 16 deaths worldwide. They also have been blamed for more than 180 injuries worldwide. [nL1N1F31KX]

A federal grand jury in January indicted three former Takata executives for criminal wrongdoing in connection with the safety defect. [nL1N1F3140]

Takata has already paid a $25 million fine and $125 million to a victims' compensation fund, including for future incidents.

Takata has until early 2018 to pay the $850 million owed to automakers, or within five days of securing a financial backer. Then-U.S. Attorney Barbara McQuade said in January that if Takata filed for bankruptcy, the Justice Department would be a creditor in the restructuring.

Key was chosen by Takata earlier this year as the favored buyer for the company. Since then, Key has been working with Takata on a restructuring plan. [nL4N1HZ047]

Inflator recalls began around 2008 and involve around 100 million inflators around the world used in vehicles made by 19 automakers, including Honda Motor Co <7267.T>, Ford Motor Co , Volkswagen AG and Tesla Inc . Recalls are to continue through at least the end of 2019.

Last month, four automakers including Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T> agreed to a $553 million settlement to address class-action economic loss claims covering owners of nearly 16 million recalled vehicles with Takata inflators. [nL2N1IL1O0]

UPDATE 1-U.S. states could not set self-driving car rules under Republican plan - 路透新闻

{{20170615T223206.869+0000}}UPDATE 1-U.S. states could not set self-driving car rules under Republican plan(Adds comment from Republican lawmaker overseeing proposal)

By David Shepardson

WASHINGTON, June 15 (Reuters) - California and other states would be barred from setting their own rules governing design and testing of self-driving cars, while federal regulators would be blocked from demanding pre-market approval for autonomous vehicle technology, according to a U.S. House Republican proposal reviewed by Reuters on Thursday.

The draft legislation, while far from becoming law, still represents a victory for General Motors Co , Alphabet Inc , Tesla Inc and other automakers and technology companies seeking to persuade Congress and the Trump administration to pre-empt rules under consideration in California, New York and other states that could limit deployment of self-driving vehicles.

The industry also opposed an Obama administration proposal last year that raised the possibility of giving regulators the power to review and approve self-driving car technology before it was put into service, similar to the vetting by Federal Aviation Administration of new technology for aircraft.

The 45-page draft package of 14 bills would designate the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration as the lead agency for regulating self-driving cars, pre-empting state rules.

States could still set insurance and registration rules but could not use them as a way to regulate self-driving technologies. California has proposed changes to its self-driving car rules, but automakers said in April it has not gone far enough. [nL1N1JA1Z6]

One of the bills in the proposal would allow the U.S. Transportation Department to exempt up to 100,000 vehicles per year from U.S. federal motor vehicle safety rules, which currently prevent the sale of self-driving vehicles without steering wheels, pedals and other human controls.

Another would declare crash data, other testing and validation reports from automated cars turned over to U.S. regulators to be "confidential business information."

U.S. Representative Bob Latta, who chairs a key panel overseeing automobile regulation, called the draft legislation "an important step in establishing a framework to allow innovators to safely develop and test autonomous vehicles." He said Republicans want "to continue working with all parties in a bipartisan manner as we refine language and move towards a consensus package."

On Tuesday, a bipartisan trio of U.S. senators said they planned to introduce legislation to remove regulatory roadblocks to the introduction of self-driving cars.

Mitch Bainwol, head of the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, an auto trade group, told Congress on Wednesday it should work to eliminate state or local laws that could "unduly burden or restrict the use of self-driving vehicles in the future."

RPT-German postal service enlists Ford for electric vans drive - 路透新闻

{{20170614T103902.863+0000}}RPT-German postal service enlists Ford for electric vans drive(Repeats to add picture for media subscribers)

* Adds 2nd line of larger vehicles after launch of e-minivan

* Ford to supply components based on Transit model

* Deutsche Post to assemble, distribute to 3rd parties

* In-house EV push makes inroads into auto industry turf

* Aims to double annual output to 20,000 vans by yr-end

DUESSELDORF, Germany, June 14 (Reuters) - German logistics group Deutsche Post DHL Group is expanding its foray into electric delivery vans, signing Ford as a components supplier for a new line of larger vehicles, the companies said on Wednesday.

Deutsche Post initially developed an electric minivan dubbed Streetscooter for its own operations to avoid inner-city emissions after growth in online shopping resulted in increased parcel deliveries. But in April it took on carmakers by unveiling plans to step up production and sell to other delivery firms. [nL8N1HJ1JV]

For the larger van, Ford will supply vehicle technology based on the Transit model, with Deutsche Post keeping assembly, distribution and sales in-house, a Germany-based Ford spokesman told Reuters.

The new model is part of a plan to build another production site for the Streetscooter unit and double annual output to 20,000 vans by the end of the year.

"This step emphasises that Deutsche Post is an innovation leader. It will relieve the inner cities and increase people's quality of life," Deutsche Post executive board member Juergen Gerdes said in a statement.

Advances in manufacturing software are allowing auto industry newcomers such as Deutsche Post, Google and start-ups to tap suppliers to design, engineer and test new vehicle concepts without hiring thousands of engineering staff or investing billions in tooling and factories.

Deutsche Post, which is also building a country-wide network of maintenance and repair shops, wants a fleet of at least 2,500 of the new vans on the road by the end of 2018, it said.

The postal services group decided to build its own vans after it could not agree on a wider supply contract with established vehicle makers.

It is phasing out use of Volkswagen's Caddy vans in favour of Streetscooters, and going it alone with the electric van project has upset VW. [nL5N1CC4EB]

Toyota chief says may consider acquisitions to gain auto tech access - 路透新闻

{{20170614T080403.167+0000}}Toyota chief says may consider acquisitions to gain auto tech access* Sees need to go on offensive while preserving firm's strengths

* President concedes he may have focused on preserving status quo

* Toyota took longer to embrace self-driving cars, EVs than rivals

By Maki Shiraki

TOYOTA CITY, June 14 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T> may consider mergers or acquisitions to procure new automotive technologies, including self-driving technologies, the company's president said on Wednesday, adding that it had to compete more aggressively against its rivals.

At an annual shareholders meeting President Akio Toyoda said the world's second-biggest automaker, which took longer to warm to self-driving cars and electric vehicles (EVs) than its rivals, would be more aggressive in expanding in these areas, conceding he may have focused too much on preserving the status quo at the firm until now.

"The auto industry is undergoing big changes, and issues and ideas which we may have thought were far off in the future could affect us tomorrow. That's why we need to go on the offensive while also preserving our areas of strength," he said.

"We've been investing 1 trillion yen ($9.08 billion) each year for R&D, expanding capex and buying back shares, but this may not be enough. We need to consider all our options, including M&A, to survive in the future."

As the rise of self-driving cars increasingly blurs the lines between automakers and technology companies, global automakers are trying to expand their role beyond making cars into transportation service providers, raising their research and development budgets and investing heavily in technology companies.

Toyota has invested $1 billion in an artificial intelligence research institute, and has struck up technology partnerships with Microsoft Corp and Uber Technologies.

It has also opened up to more companies beyond its group suppliers, including tech company Nvidia Corp , to procure more software for its automated driving systems.

The automaker plans to launch a car in 2020 which can drive itself on highways. Meanwhile, rival Nissan Motor Co <7201.T> is already aiming to get cars that can drive autonomously on city streets in that same year and General Motors Co says it has begun to mass-produce self-driving test vehicles.

Toyota also has yet to ink a major capital tie-up with outside companies, after GM has scooped up U.S. autonomous driving technology company Cruise and partnered with ride services firm Lyft, while Ford Motor Co has acquired ride-sharing service Chariot.

Toyota late last year set up an electric car division, belatedly entering a market where Nissan, GM, Volkswagen AG and other automakers already have offerings, as it continues to bet on hydrogen fuel cell vehicles as the zero-emission car of the future.

U.S. senators unveil road map for self-driving car legislation - 路透新闻

{{20170613T202202.459+0000}}U.S. senators unveil road map for self-driving car legislationBy David Shepardson

WASHINGTON, June 13 (Reuters) - A bipartisan trio of U.S. senators said on Tuesday they planned to introduce legislation to remove regulatory roadblocks to the introduction of self-driving cars, including sorting out conflicts between state and federal rules.

Republican Senator John Thune, who chairs the Commerce Committee, Bill Nelson, the top Democrat on the panel, and Senator Gary Peters, a Michigan Democrat, said in a joint statement that existing federal vehicle regulations written over recent decades did not account for self-driving cars without a human driver behind the wheel.

Thune said the senators hoped to reach agreement based on "prioritizing safety, fixing outdated rules, and clarifying the role of federal and state governments."

Federal auto regulations pose significant legal hurdles that must be cleared before fully self-driving cars can be sold without steering wheels and gas pedals, a government report said last year.

The Senate Commerce Committee is holding a hearing on self-driving cars on Wednesday. Mitch Bainwol, head of the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, an auto trade group, will tell the panel that Congress should work to eliminate state or local laws that could "unduly burden or restrict the use of self-driving vehicles in the future."

The senators are joining a broader movement in Washington to respond to calls from Detroit and Silicon Valley for federal action to set rules for self-driving cars, rather than allowing states such as California to write potentially conflicting rules.

The chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee told Reuters last week he planned to unveil a package of legislation to overhaul federal rules governing self-driving vehicles. [nL1N1J31IM]

Companies such as Alphabet Inc , General Motors Co and Volkswagen AG are pursuing automated technologies and want unified federal regulations to replace outdated rules and make it simpler to develop and eventually sell the technology across the country.

In April, automakers and technology companies urged California to make changes to its proposed state regulations governing autonomous vehicles. Many oppose California's plan to require a state permit to deploy autonomous vehicles, which must meet performance and design criteria.

The U.S. Transportation Department said last week it would unveil revised self-driving guidelines within the next few months, responding to automakers' calls for regulations to sanction costly efforts to put autonomous vehicles on the road. [nL1N1J2157]

Vehicle crashes annually kill more than 35,000 people on U.S. roads and injure 2.4 million. The economic cost of vehicle crashes is at least $240 billion annually, the government says.

UPDATE 2-Opel CEO Neumann quits as PSA deal nears, may rejoin VW - 路透新闻

{{20170612T175638.515+0000}}UPDATE 2-Opel CEO Neumann quits as PSA deal nears, may rejoin VW* Neumann to stay on board until PSA deal closes

* E-car credentials make Neumann attractive for VW

* CFO Lohscheller to take over Opel helm

(Adds analyst comments, detail and background)

BERLIN, June 12 (Reuters) - General Motors' European division Opel is losing its top executive just as it prepares to be acquired by France's PSA Group , a move that could see the former Volkswagen manager rejoin the German behemoth.

Karl-Thomas Neumann, 56, who has restored Opel's image and reputation since taking the helm in March 2013, on Monday resigned from his post, making way for finance chief Michael Lohscheller to become the next CEO of the 155-year-old carmaker.

German-based Opel will be pressed by its new owners PSA to draw up a plan to return to profit once the acquisition, agreed in March valuing the GM division at 2.2 billion euros ($2.46 billion), closes later this year.

"Under Neumann's leadership we have made enormous progress in turning around Opel," GM President Dan Ammann said. The U.S. parent's European business also includes British brand Vauxhall.

VW is looking at rehiring Neumann, possibly to lead its Audi luxury division, where chief executive Rupert Stadler has come under fire for his handling of the emissions scandal, a source told Reuters on Sunday. [nL8N1J80DT]

A growing expansion by VW group into electric cars and digital services as part of a post-dieselgate strategic shift could be another reason to join for Neumann, a trained electronic engineer, analysts said.

"The prospects are good that he will move to Volkswagen," said Bankhaus Metzler analyst Juergen Pieper. "He's one of Germany's most distinguished car managers and VW is in great need for excellent people."

LASTING PROFIT

PSA wants Opel to return to lasting profit no later than by 2020 with operating margin goals of 2 percent that year and even around 6 percent by 2026 - a target never achieved under Neumann whose push for profitability was hampered by a weak Russian market and effects of Britain's Brexit decision.

"We will vigorously proceed along the agreed path and gain more clout as part of the PSA group," Lohscheller said.

Germany's Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung reported on Saturday that while Neumann views the sale to PSA as the right strategic step, he is concerned that the new owner is underestimating the growing importance of electric cars.

"These comments are interesting given we have previously noted our concerns around PSA's lack of investment in key future trends," said London-based Evercore ISI analyst Arndt Ellinghorst.

PSA only came eighth in a top-ten ranking compiled by Evercore of carmakers based on average R&D spending between 2014-2016, lagging rivals such as Ford , Renault and leader Volkswagen where Neumann was formerly in charge of group-wide electronics research.

Neumann said on Twitter he will stay as member of Opel's management board until the closing of the acquisition by PSA.

When he lost his post as head of VW's vast operations in China in 2012, sources at the carmaker said at the time he was too aspiring for the then-CEO Martin Winterkorn.

"VW boss (Matthias) Mueller has a more open leadership style that is not authoritarian," Pieper said. "That would facilitate Neumann's return."

UPDATE 3-Coalition of 13 states to challenge Trump on vehicle emission standards - 路透新闻

{{20170609T184505.738+0000}}UPDATE 3-Coalition of 13 states to challenge Trump on vehicle emission standards(Adds EPA, automaker reaction)

By David Shepardson

WASHINGTON, June 9 (Reuters) - New York State's attorney general and 12 other top state law enforcement officials said on Friday they would mount a vigorous court challenge to any effort to roll back vehicle emission rules by the Trump administration.

In March, President Donald Trump ordered a review of U.S. vehicle fuel-efficiency standards from 2022-2025 put in place by the Obama administration, saying they were too tough on the auto industry.

The push to weaken the rules by the Trump administration comes as automakers are worried that consumers shift to larger vehicles and low gas prices will make it expensive or impossible to meet the regulations. They also fear a prolonged fight with states over the rules could make revising their product plans difficult.

Democratic state officials have been increasingly aggressive in challenging Trump administration regulatory rollback efforts.

"In light of the critical public health and environmental benefits the standards will deliver, if EPA acts to weaken or delay the current standards for model years 2022-25, like California, we intend to vigorously pursue appropriate legal remedies to block such action," the state attorneys wrote in a letter to the Environmental Protection Agency including Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Iowa, Washington State, Oregon and Rhode Island.

An EPA spokesman said Friday the agency is reviewing the letter.

Automakers including General Motors Co , Ford Motor Co and Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T> say the Obama administration did not conduct a proper review to ensure those rules are feasible.

Automakers have met with Trump administration officials in recent months and hope to reach a deal with California and other states on vehicle fuel efficiency standards.

Gloria Bergquist, a spokeswoman for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a trade group, said automakers "urge everyone to avoid pre-judging the results" of the ongoing review. "A process is now under way again for a thoughtful and coordinated analysis,"

California has opposed weakening the rules, threatened to pursue tougher standards unilaterally and could mount a legal challenge.

The White House plans to hold negotiations with car companies, California and potentially other states. A deal would remove uncertainty for automakers, who need years of lead time to engineer future models and want uniform rules across all 50 states.

The Obama administration's rules, negotiated with automakers in 2011, were aimed at doubling average fleet-wide fuel efficiency to 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025. Under the 2011 deal, the 2022-2025 model year rules had to be finalized by April 2018. The Obama administration completed a review of the 2022-2025 rules days before leaving office.

Without a deal, automakers could be forced to meet one set of standards in California and a dozen states that have adopted its rules and other rules in the rest of the country.

In 2011, Obama said the rules would save motorists $1.7 trillion in fuel costs over the life of the vehicles, but cost the auto industry about $200 billion over 13 years.

Mexican state in Trump firing line says U.S. investment holding up - 路透新闻

{{20170609T000212.406+0000}}Mexican state in Trump firing line says U.S. investment holding upMEXICO CITY, June 8 (Reuters) - American investment has stayed steady in a Mexican state that was one of the first to suffer at the hands of U.S. President Donald Trump's drive to bring back jobs from Mexico, the region's economy minister said on Thursday.

Just a few weeks after his election in November, Trump announced he had struck a deal to stop about 1,000 jobs at U.S. manufacturer Carrier from being moved to its Mexican operations in the industrial state of Nuevo Leon, which borders Texas. [nL1N1DV2GT]

Soon afterward, carmaker Ford canceled a planned $1.6 billion plant in central Mexico, causing widespread alarm that Trump's interventions and threats to tear up the NAFTA trade agreement would lead to a collapse in investment in Mexico.

But Fernando Turner, the economy minister of Nuevo Leon, said U.S. companies still were committed to the state and that there had been no slowdown in investment by them because they understand the benefits of Mexico better than Trump does.

"American companies will educate him," he told Reuters.

Turner said U.S. firms were no longer talking about their investments to avoid incurring Trump's wrath.

"Until Trump changes his rhetoric ... there won't be a single global company from anywhere that wants to announce investment in Mexico. (But) they're going to do it," he said.

Nuevo Leon is home to some of the biggest companies in Mexico, including cement maker Cemex and conglomerate Alfa . It received a tenth of the foreign direct investment (FDI) to Mexico in 2016 - more than any other region, barring Mexico City.

Provisional government first quarter data showed FDI to Nuevo Leon fell to $585 million from a preliminary figure of $779 million in the same period last year. Nationally, however, the figure rose 0.6 percent to $7.9 billion in the quarter.

Trump's rhetoric has caused anger in Mexico, and Nuevo Leon last month unveiled an economic plan aiming to modernize the economy and reverse a brain drain to the United States.

CORRECTED-Automakers diverge on how fast to deploy automatic braking - 路透新闻

{{20170608T221431.435+0000}}CORRECTED-Automakers diverge on how fast to deploy automatic braking(Corrects number of model lines in which Fiat Chrysler offers automatic braking as optional equipment to nine instead of seven, paragraph 15)

By Joseph White

DETROIT, June 8 (Reuters) - Big automakers are rushing to launch self-driving cars as early as 2021, but the industry's major players are moving slowly when it comes to widespread deployment of a less expensive crash prevention technology that regulators say could prevent thousands of deaths and injuries every year.

Nissan Motor Co Ltd <7201.T> said on Thursday it would make automatic braking systems standard on an estimated 1 million 2018 model cars and light trucks sold in the United States, including high-volume models such as the Rogue and Rogue Sport compact sport utility vehicles, the Altima sedan, Murano and Pathfinder SUVs, LEAF electric car, Maxima sedan and Sentra small car. [nL3N1J51OO]

Nissan sold about 1.6 million vehicles in the United States last year.

Rival Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T> has said it will make so-called automatic emergency braking standard on nearly all its U.S. models by the end of this year. [nWNAB0AD2N]

Overall, however, most automakers are not rushing to make automatic brake systems part of the base cost of mainstream vehicles sold in the competitive U.S. market. The industry has come under pressure from regulators, lawmakers and safety advocates to adopt the technology, which can slow or stop a vehicle even if the driver fails to act.

So far, only about 17 percent of models tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety offered standard collision-avoiding braking, according to data supplied by the auto safety research group backed insurance industry. Many of the models with standard collision-avoiding brake systems are luxury vehicles made by European or Japanese manufacturers.

The systems require more sensors and software than conventional brakes, and automakers said they need time to engineer the systems into vehicles as part of more comprehensive makeovers.

Last year, 20 automakers reached a voluntary agreement with U.S. auto safety regulators to make collision-avoiding braking systems standard equipment by 2022. [nL2N16P1S5]

Safety advocates have petitioned the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to begin a regulatory process to require the technologies, but the agency has said the voluntary agreement will result in faster deployment than a formal rule-making process. NHTSA says the technology could eliminate one-fifth of crashes.

"Do the math. That's 5 million crashes every year - 20 percent reduction means 1 million less. Those are big numbers," Mark Rosekind, the NHTSA's then-administrator, told Reuters last year.

But customers would likely experience the benefits of the technology infrequently. The technology to enable a car to drive itself is far more costly, but industry executives foresee autonomous vehicles driving revenue-generating transportation services that could be attractive to investors.

General Motors Co offers automatic braking as optional equipment on about two-thirds of its models. The company did not say on Thursday how many vehicles have the technology as standard equipment. GM has not made public its plans to make the technology standard across its lineup.

"Any time you have a voluntary agreement you have a spectrum of implementation," Jeff Boyer, GM's vice president for safety, told Reuters earlier this week. Asked when GM would roll out standard automatic braking, Boyer said, "let's just say we honor the voluntary commitment."

Ford Motor Co "has a plan to standardize over time," the company said in a statement on Thursday. Currently, automatic braking systems are optional on several 2017 Ford and Lincoln models, and will be offered on certain 2018 models including the best-selling F-150 pickup truck.

Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV offers automatic braking as optional equipment in nine model lines, using cameras and radar to detect hazards ahead. The company has said it will meet the 2022 target for making the systems standard.

As 2018 models roll out during the second half of this year, more vehicles will offer automatic braking, said Dean McConnell, an executive with Continental AG 's North American business. Continental's automatic braking technology systems will be on certain Nissan models.

"We see it accelerating," he said. "It varies. There are some (automakers) that are being aggressive" and others that are waiting.

Nissan did not disclose how much prices for vehicles would rise to offset the cost of standard automatic emergency braking. The 2018 models will be launched later this year. Currently, Nissan, like most carmakers, offers automatic braking as part of a bundle of optional safety and technology features.

A 2017 Nissan Sentra compact sedan has a starting price of $17,875. To buy the car equipped with automatic braking requires spending another $6,820 for a Sentra SR with a premium technology package.

German auto technology suppliers Continental and Robert Bosch GmbH [ROBG.UL] will supply the systems, Nissan said.

BREAKINGVIEWS-Tesla shareholders reveal deep abiding faith  - 路透新闻

{{20170608T144331.559+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-Tesla shareholders reveal deep abiding faith (The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.)

By Antony Currie

NEW YORK, June 8 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Tesla's shareholders have revealed their faith is blind. Even after excluding the 22 percent stake owned by founder and Chief Executive Elon Musk, a proposal forcing all seven board members to stand for election every year was rejected at this week's annual meeting. Authorizing bad corporate governance makes little sense at a company with such a lofty valuation.

A total of 38.7 million shares – without Musk's 36 million – cleaved to the company line by voting down the plan put forward by the Connecticut Retirement Plans and Trust Fund. That left just 45 percent of the unaffiliated vote behind it.

Tesla's argument for the status quo rings hollow. It reckons directors risk being "distracted by special interests that seek only short-term returns" if each were to face re-election annually. But the company is losing money and has no cash to spare. Absent a highly unlikely sale, there's not much that a short-term-biased director could do.

Enough investors were nevertheless persuaded. That's surprising, especially considering recent history. Last year, about three-quarters of unaffiliated shareholders supported a proposal to eliminate the limited supermajority voting rules. That fell to 42 percent after factoring in Musk's block.

Yet Tesla's board could use a shakeup. Lead director Antonio Gracias, Steve Jurvetson and Musk's brother Kimbal all sit on the board at another Musk company, SpaceX, in which fellow director and venture capitalist Ira Ehrenpreis has invested. Gracias was also a director at SolarCity before Tesla bought it last year and runs a private-equity fund Musk backs, while Brad Buss spent seven years as SolarCity's finance chief.

That leaves just one member with no other obvious ties to the boss. Musk did, at least, say at Tuesday's meeting that he hopes to add some independent directors soon. Even so, shareholders are too accepting of Tesla's chummy board.

Of course, the company's stock also has surged over 60 percent over the past year. At a market value of $60 billion, it's worth more than both Ford and General Motors . Tesla also now trades at 30 times consensus earnings for 2020, according to Thomson Reuters data, implying astonishing growth in vehicle sales at eye-popping margins of at least 30 percent. The complete confidence of shareholders is as consistent in the market as it is at the ballot.

CONTEXT NEWS

- A majority of Tesla's independent shareholders on June 6 voted against a proposal at the carmaker's annual meeting to force board directors to stand for election each year, the company revealed in a regulatory filing on June 8. Tesla currently allows its seven directors to serve three-year terms.

- Tesla recommended shareholders vote against the proposal, put forward by the Connecticut Retirement Plans and Trust Fund, arguing it allows directors "to maximize the interests of the Company and our stockholders over the long-term, without being distracted by special interests that seek only short-term returns."

- Holders of 74.7 million shares voted against the proposal, while 32.7 million voted in favor. After stripping out Musk's 36.1 million shares, 38.5 million independent owners rejected the amendment.

- Tesla stock has increased 62 percent over the past 12 months. The company is worth almost $60 billion, 36 percent more than Ford and 15 percent more than General Motors.

Honda to focus on self-driving cars, robotics, EVs through 2030 - 路透新闻

{{20170608T060004.806+0000}}Honda to focus on self-driving cars, robotics, EVs through 2030* Honda aims to develop "level 4" autonomous cars by 2025

* Sets up electric car division to speed up development

* Mid-term plan highlights need to look beyond conventional cars

By Naomi Tajitsu

HAGA, Japan, June 8 (Reuters) - Japanese carmaker Honda Motor Co <7267.T> on Thursday spelled out for the first time its plans to develop autonomous cars which can drive on city streets by 2025, building on its strategy to take on rivals in the auto market of the future.

Unveiling its mid-term Vision 2030 strategy plan, Honda said it would boost coordination between R&D, procurement and manufacturing to tame development costs as it acknowledged it must look beyond conventional vehicles to survive in an industry which is moving rapidly into electric and self-driving cars.

Honda has already spelled out plans to market a vehicle which can drive itself on highways by 2020, and the new target for city-capable self-driving cars puts its progress slightly behind rivals like BMW .

"We're going to place utmost priority on electrification and advanced safety technologies going forward," Honda CEO Takahiro Hachigo said.

Developing new driving technologies, robotics- and artificial intelligence-driven services and new energy solutions also would be key priorities for Honda in the years ahead, the company said.

LEVELLING UP

Honda established a division late last year to develop electric vehicles (EVs) as part of its long-held goal for lower-emission gasoline hybrids, plug-in hybrids, EVs and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles (FCVs) to account for two-thirds of its line-up by 2030, from about 5 percent now.

By 2025, Honda plans to come up with cars with "level 4" standard automated driving functions, meaning they can drive themselves on highways and city roads under most situations.

Achieving such capabilities will require artificial intelligence to detect traffic movements, along with a battery of cameras and sensors to help avoid accidents.

BMW has said it would launch a fully autonomous car by 2021, while Ford Motor Co has said it will introduce a vehicle with similar capabilities for ride-sharing purposes in the same year. Nissan Motor Co <7201.T> is planning to launch a car which can drive automatically on city streets by 2020.

Honda has been ramping up R&D spending, earmarking a record 750 billion yen ($6.84 billion) for the year to March.

($1 = 109.6400 yen)

Ford offering short-term consumer auto leases through Canvas - 路透新闻

{{20170607T191813.175+0000}}Ford offering short-term consumer auto leases through CanvasBy Paul Lienert

DETROIT, June 7 (Reuters) - Silicon Valley's latest mobility startup, a short-term vehicle leasing company called Canvas, is backed by old-school muscle: Ford Motor Credit Co, the dealer and consumer financing arm of U.S. automaker Ford Motor Co .

From its San Francisco base, Canvas started offering variable-term leases with flexible payment options to Bay area customers in early May, with plans to eventually roll out the service to other cities.

Canvas's roots date back to an earlier startup called Breeze.

"Our mission is to identify, test and launch financial products that meet the changing needs of consumers," said Ned Ryan, co-founder of Breeze and chief executive officer of Canvas, in an interview.

The focus on consumers, including those who might not qualify for conventional auto leases or don't want to make long-term financial commitments, is a pivot from Breeze's original mission, which was to provide short-term vehicle leases to ride-sharing drivers who worked mainly for Uber and Lyft.

When both ride-sharing firms began offering lease plans of their own, including short-term financing deals through General Motors Co's Maven subsidiary, the potential market for Breeze thinned markedly and the company ceased operations in July 2016.

Seeing a related opportunity and a broader audience, Ford Credit acquired the assets of Breeze, along with many of its executives and employees, in November 2016 and rebranded the company as Canvas.

Ford Credit recognized "the need for financial services and technology to facilitate our future vision of mobile," said David McClelland, executive vice president of marketing and sales.

The Breeze acquisition gave Ford Credit access to a web-based platform and month-to-month vehicle "subscriptions" that bundle maintenance, insurance and roadside assistance, aimed at younger, non-traditional drivers.

Because Canvas buys used Ford vehicles coming off lease, it also gives the automaker a new source of revenue and another way to manage used-car values, which have plummeted in recent months.

Unlike Breeze, Canvas does not compete head-to-head with Maven, which offers ride-sharing drivers short-term leases on new Chevrolet Bolt EV electric vehicles and used GM vehicles, through such programs as Maven Gig and Lyft Express Drive.

Canvas is aiming at consumers who want "a simpler, more flexible alternative to car ownership," said Ryan. "We're addressing the void in the consumer space between daily rentals and long-term (financial) commitments."

The pitch, Ryan added, could not be more simple: "You just add the gas."

Ford offering new China price discounts, as sales fall in May - 路透新闻

{{20170607T083210.425+0000}}Ford offering new China price discounts, as sales fall in May* May sales -3 pct; Jan-May sales -11 pct

* New sales promotions put Ford on track for Q2 growth -statement

* Car models reaching end of life cycle drag on sales - analyst

By Jake Spring and Norihiko Shirouzu

BEIJING, June 7 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co said on Wednesday its China sales fell 3 percent year-on-year in May, the third decline so far this year, and indicated it would offer local customers discounts to help boost sales of its ageing lineup of cars.

Sales in May fell to 87,733 vehicles, while they fell 11 percent to 436,961 in the January-May period, the U.S. automaker said.

Despite the weak May figures, Ford sales are "on track" to grow for the second-quarter overall, said Peter Fleet, Ford's Asia Pacific sales chief, in a written statement.

"We've strengthened our marketing plan in China for the second quarter, with new and exciting customer promotions for Ford-branded vehicles," Fleet said.

The plan includes a "realigned Kuga (sport-utility vehicle) customer offer," the statement said, without elaborating. In the automotive industry, "promotions" and "offers" generally indicate price discounting.

China's auto market, the world's largest, faces slower growth this year as a tax incentive for small-engined cars is rolled back, with sales rising 4 percent for the market overall in the first four months of the year, according to the latest data available from the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers.

Sales at Ford's U.S. peer General Motors have also fallen this year, while Japanese rival Toyota Motor Corp's <7203.T> sales growth has slowed.

Fleet is set to become Asia-Pacific and China chief for Ford on July 1 in a global management shake-up after the dismissal of Chief Executive Mark Fields as the company's sales come under increasing pressure globally. [nL4N1IO2J0]

James Hackett, a former office furniture executive heading Ford's self-driving car unit, was named CEO last month with a slate of other leadership posts also set to change hands.

Several key models are reaching the end of their life cycles and dragging on sales, including the Kuga and EcoSport in China's fastest growing sport-utility segment as well as the Ford Focus sedan, said Yale Zhang, Shanghai-based managing director for consultancy Automotive Foresight.

Sales of all three models have fallen by double-digits year-on-year for January to May.

"From the second half and into next year they will launch some newer generation products and the situation will be better," Zhang said.

A new version of the Ford EcoSport will launch later this year in China, a Ford spokeswoman said.

UPDATE 1-BlackBerry downplays Toyota's use of rival software - 路透新闻

{{20170605T232713.674+0000}}UPDATE 1-BlackBerry downplays Toyota's use of rival software(Adds analyst comment, detail from BlackBerry)

By Alastair Sharp

TORONTO, June 5 (Reuters) - BlackBerry Ltd on Monday downplayed news that Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T> would adopt rival software for its future vehicle consoles, saying it was more focused on the faster-growing market for autonomous driving technology.

Automotive Grade Linux (AGL), a collaborative effort of some 100 technology companies and automakers, said last week that Toyota would start using its open-source software in Entune 3.0 consoles of its 2018 Camry sedans, before deploying it in most Toyota and Lexus vehicles sold in North America.

BlackBerry Chief Operating Officer Marty Beard said in a blog posting that he expected AGL - as well as regular Linux and Android - to take a share of the automotive infotainment market, where BlackBerry's QNX is a dominant supplier.

"None of these challenger platforms is close to displacing BlackBerry QNX in safety-critical modules, areas that are growing faster than infotainment in the modern software-defined car," Beard said in the blog post.

QNX is a leading supplier of software for consoles that deliver video, mapping, hands-free calling and internet services to vehicles, and is pitching for more business in the race toward autonomous driving. [nL1N1E12EX]

QNX was not Entune's main platform, but it did supply some peripheral infotainment software, BlackBerry spokeswoman Sarah McKinney said.

She also said she was not sure whether QNX would continue to be used in new versions of Entune 3.0.

Toyota is the first major automaker to adopt AGL, a project started five years ago to develop standardized open-source software for the auto industry.

Christopher Rommel, head of embedded technology research at VDC Research, said that a Linux-based industry standard could threaten QNX's strong position in infotainment, but that the BlackBerry unit has a history in smaller scale, real-time auto applications where Linux would struggle to compete.

"There's boundaries to where OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) want to put Linux or can put Linux based both on its memory requirements as well and latency and deterministic constraints," he said.

AGL's more than 100 members include Toyota, Ford Motor Co , Honda Motor Co <7267.T>, Mazda Motor Corp <7261.T>, Mercedes-Benz, Nissan Motor Co <7201.T>, Suzuki Motor Corp <7269.T> and Subaru. Other members include chipmakers and auto suppliers.

QNX said in October that it was working with Ford to develop increasingly automated vehicles, and executives have said they are in advanced discussions with several other major global automakers about similar partnerships.

BlackBerry downplays Toyota's move to rival software maker - 路透新闻

{{20170605T204039.667+0000}}BlackBerry downplays Toyota's move to rival software makerBy Alastair Sharp

TORONTO, June 5 (Reuters) - BlackBerry Ltd on Monday downplayed news that Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T> would stop using its QNX software to run vehicle consoles, saying it is more focused on the faster-growing market for autonomous driving technology.

QNX is a leading supplier of software for consoles that deliver video, mapping, hands-free calling and internet services to vehicles. Its software has been used in Toyota consoles for four years.

Automotive Grade Linux, a collaborative of some 100 technology companies and automakers, said on Wednesday that Toyota would start using its open-source software in Entune 3.0 consoles of its 2018 Camry sedans, and then deploy it in most Toyota and Lexus vehicles sold in North America.

Toyota is one of the first major automakers to adopt Automotive Grade Linux, a project known as AGL started five years ago to develop standardized open-source software for the auto industry.

Its more than 100 members include Toyota, as well as Ford Motor Co , Honda Motor Co <7267.T>, Mazda Motor Corp <7261.T>, Mercedes-Benz, Nissan Motor Co <7201.T>, Suzuki Motor Corp <7269.T> and Subaru. Chipmakers and other auto suppliers are also members.

AGL said that Toyota had actively contributed to developing its software platform and would share additional code as it rolls out its new infotainment system.

BlackBerry Chief Operating Officer Marty Beard said in a blog post on Monday that he expected AGL to take market share in the automotive infotainment market, along with regular Linux and Android.

"But none of these challenger platforms is close to displacing BlackBerry QNX in safety-critical modules, areas that are growing faster than infotainment in the modern software-defined car," Beard said.

BlackBerry's QNX division said in October that it was working with Ford Motor Co as it develops increasingly automated vehicles, and executives have said they are in advanced discussions with several other major global automakers about similar partnerships.

UPDATE 1-U.S. plans to update self-driving guidelines in coming months - 路透新闻

{{20170605T203529.396+0000}}UPDATE 1-U.S. plans to update self-driving guidelines in coming months(Adds comments from Transportation Secretary Chao)

By David Shepardson

DETROIT/WASHINGTON, June 5 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump's administration will unveil revised self-driving guidelines within the next few months, the head of the U.S. Transportation Department said on Monday, responding to automakers' calls for regulations that will eliminate barriers and allow autonomous vehicles on the road.

"The pressure is mounting for the federal government to do something" about autonomous vehicles, U.S. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao said on Monday in Detroit. However, Chao told reporters the federal government should be careful before setting binding rules to govern autonomous vehicles.

"We don't want rules that impede future technological advances," Chao said.

Chao was not specific about what her department's proposals would include, or how they would differ from policy guidance proposed by the Obama administration.

Companies including Alphabet Inc's self-driving car Waymo unit, General Motors Co , Ford Motor Co , Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL], Tesla Inc and other are aggressively pursuing automated vehicle technologies.

"We need a more concrete regulatory framework," Ken Washington, chief technology officer of Ford, said in Detroit. Automakers could use a clear set of rules to certify on their own that an autonomous vehicle is safe, as they can now with conventional vehicles, Washington said.

Ford Executive Chairman Bill Ford Jr said at a forum in Washington he feels "quite confident" that the hardware and software will be ready by 2021 for self-driving cars. But other big issues loom. "Things like ethics," Ford said, saying does the vehicle opt to save 10 pedestrians or the driver. Individual automakers cannot program separate ethics software for self-driving cars but must work together as an industry, Ford said.

Ron Medford, Waymo's director of safety, said in Detroit he expected autonomous cars would appear first in "managed fleet operations," not as vehicles sold to individuals.

Chao, in remarks prepared for delivery in Detroit, said the new rules would support industry innovation and aim to encourage "new entrants and ideas that deliver safer vehicles."

Automakers have met with Chao on several occasions in recent months and urged her to make changes to Obama-era automated vehicle rules. [nL2N1GBJ7J]

Republicans on the House Energy and Commerce Committee have also been working on a package of legislation to make it easier to get self-driving cars on the road. A U.S. Senate committee is also planning a new hearing this month on self-driving cars.

The Obama guidelines called on automakers to voluntarily submit details of self-driving vehicle systems to regulators in a 15-point "safety assessment" and urge states to defer to the federal government on most vehicle regulations.

Automakers have raised numerous concerns about the guidance, including that it requires them to turn over significant data, could delay testing by months and lead to states making the voluntary guidelines mandatory.

DETROIT/WASHINGTON, June 5 (Reuters) - The Trump administration will unveil revised self-driving guidelines within the next few months, the head of the U.S. Transportation Department said on Monday, responding to automakers' calls for regulations that will sanction their costly efforts to put autonomous vehicles on the road.

U.S. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao said in February she was reviewing self-driving vehicle guidance issued by the Obama administration in September, but on Monday said the new guidelines "will be released in the next few months, if not sooner." Chao said the new guidelines "will point to a path forward for the safe deployment of automated vehicles."

UK new car sales fall 8.5 pct in May ahead of election  - 路透新闻

{{20170605T081920.196+0000}}UK new car sales fall 8.5 pct in May ahead of election LONDON, June 5 (Reuters) - British new car registrations fell 8.5 percent last month, an industry body said on Monday, blaming the decline on the run-up to this week's national election and the effect of an April tax hike which boosted demand earlier in the year.

Car sales dropped to 186,265 vehicles in May, with a 14 percent slump in demand to consumers and a 5.3 percent drop in fleet business registrations, according to data from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT).

"We expected demand in the new car market to remain negative in May due to the pull-forward to March," SMMT Chief Executive Mike Hawes said, referring to a rise in vehicle excise duty which boosted demand before it came into effect in April.

"Added to this, the general election was always likely to give many pause for thought and affect purchasing patterns in the short term," he said.

Demand for diesel continued to fall last month with demand down 20 percent, as a series of tax hikes in London and possible levies in other cities continued to dampen demand. [nL8N1I71FS]

By David Shepardson and Susan Heavey

WASHINGTON, June 2 (Reuters) - Several major U.S. companies, including Wal-Mart Stores Inc , JP Morgan Chase & Co and IBM Corp , on Friday said their CEOs will remain in an influential presidential advisory group despite objecting to President Donald Trump's withdrawal from the Paris climate accord.

Citing the need to stay engaged with the administration, business leaders said they would remain in their advisory roles to continue working to influence White House policies.

Trump, a Republican, on Thursday said he would pull the United States from the landmark 2015 global agreement to fight climate change, drawing anger and condemnation from world leaders and heads of industry. [nL1N1IY0MV] [nL1N1IZ1BA]

"Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world," Musk said in a Twitter post on Thursday. He was a member of the business advisory group, known as the President's Strategic and Policy Forum. He also belonged to Trump's manufacturing jobs council.

Asked about CEOs' criticism of the U.S. withdrawal, White House spokesman Sean Spicer on Friday said some companies that expressed support for remaining in the agreement raised concerns about the emissions reduction targets.

Spicer, speaking to reporters at a daily news conference, added he does not know if Trump will replace Musk and Iger on the business council.

A spokesman for Wal-Mart Stores Inc , the largest U.S. retailer, said on Friday that Chief Executive Doug McMillon will remain on the business council.

McMillon said in a Facebook post late on Thursday he was "disappointed in today's news about the Paris Agreement. We think it's important for countries to work together to reduce greenhouse gas emissions."

IBM CEO Ginni Rometty will remain on the council, the company said on Friday as it reaffirmed its support for the Paris accord.

"IBM believes we can make a constructive contribution by having a direct dialogue with the administration – as we do with governments around the world," a company spokeswoman said.

Cleveland Clinic Chief Executive Toby Cosgrove will also remain on the council, a spokeswoman said.

Another prominent chief executive, Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase & Co , criticized Trump's decision. The company acknowledged Friday that he would not step down from Trump's business group.

"I absolutely disagree with the administration on this issue, but we have a responsibility to engage our elected officials to work constructively and advocate for policies that improve people's lives and protect our environment," Dimon said in a statement.

PepsiCo Inc Chief Executive Indra Nooyi is expected to remain on the council. The company said in a statement on Friday that while it is "disappointed with the announcement, we hope there is a way for the accord to move forward with the U.S. at the table."

'LET'S GET A BETTER DEAL'

Other chief executives also issued statements criticizing the decision to withdraw from the accord, including the heads of Facebook Inc , Alphabet Inc and Goldman Sachs .

General Electric Co CEO Jeff Immelt, who is on Trump's manufacturing council, said on Thursday he was disappointed in the decision and added: "Industry must now lead and not depend on government."

Immelt will remain on the council, a company spokeswoman said on Friday.

AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka, who is also on Trump's manufacturing council, called the withdrawal "a failure of American leadership." A union spokesman said on Friday that Trumka intends to remain on the council to serve "as a voice for working people." Boeing Co Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg also will remain on the manufacturing council, the company said.

Trump administration officials pushed back against company criticisms in television interviews on Friday.

National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn dismissed concerns about potential economic fallout from the climate deal withdrawal, such as the potential of other countries slapping tariffs on American manufacturers.

In an interview on CNBC on Friday, Cohn said the move was part of the administration's efforts to boost U.S. economic growth and help companies by increasing demand for U.S. goods, along with other efforts targeting regulations, taxes and infrastructure.

"If we can grow our economy, we're going to consume more and more products," he said. "We're going to need more manufacturing in the United States just to deal with domestic consumption."

The issue could resurface later this month when, according to an administration spokesman, the White House plans to hold a June 19 meeting with technology leaders.

Kellyanne Conway, a White House senior adviser, said on Fox News the deal would have "a statistically insignificant impact on the environment."

"If you really cared about that piece, and you're one of these CEOs crowing today, then you would say 'let's get a better deal,'" she said in the interview on Friday, adding that Trump had said he was open to future negotiations. [nL1N1IZ0VE]

Trump created the business advisory group in December before taking office to assist him in making policy decisions. The council is led by Stephen Schwarzman, chief executive of Blackstone Group LP .

Blackrock Inc Chief Executive Larry Fink said on Thursday he would continue to serve on Trump's business forum, despite reservations about the White House climate decision because he believes he can add to policy discussions and be a voice for investors.

General Motors Co said Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra also would remain on the presidential advisory panel, while it remained unclear whether Ford Motor Co's new chief executive, James Hackett, would join the group.

In February, Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] CEO Travis Kalanick quit the business advisory council amid internal pressure over Trump's immigration policies. [nL1N1FN21P]

Cleveland Clinic Chief Executive Toby Cosgrove will also remain on the council, a spokeswoman said.

Another prominent chief executive, Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase & Co , criticized Trump's decision, but suggested in a statement on Friday that he would not step down from Trump's business group.

"I absolutely disagree with the administration on this issue, but we have a responsibility to engage our elected officials to work constructively and advocate for policies that improve people's lives and protect our environment," Dimon said.

PepsiCo Inc Chief Executive Indra Nooyi is expected to remain on the council. The company said in a statement on Friday that while it is "disappointed with the announcement, we hope there is a way for the accord to move forward with the U.S. at the table."

'LET'S GET A BETTER DEAL'

Other chief executives also issued statements criticizing the decision to withdraw from the accord, including the heads of Facebook Inc , Alphabet Inc , Goldman Sachs and General Electric Co . GE's CEO, Jeff Immelt, is on Trump's manufacturing council.

AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka, who is also on Trump's manufacturing council, called the withdrawal "a failure of American leadership." A union spokesman said on Friday that Trumka intends to remain on the council to serve "as a voice for working people."

Trump administration officials pushed back against company criticisms in television interviews on Friday.

National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn dismissed concerns about potential economic fallout from the climate deal withdrawal, such as the potential of other countries slapping tariffs on American manufacturers.

In an interview on CNBC on Friday, Cohn said the move was part of the administration's efforts to boost U.S. economic growth and help companies by increasing demand for U.S. goods, along with other efforts targeting regulations, taxes and infrastructure.

"If we can grow our economy, we're going to consume more and more products," he said. "We're going to need more manufacturing in the United States just to deal with domestic consumption."

The issue could resurface later this month when, according to an administration spokesman, the White House plans to hold a June 19 meeting with technology leaders.

Kellyanne Conway, a White House senior adviser, said on Fox News the deal would have "a statistically insignificant impact on the environment."

"If you really cared about that piece, and you're one of these CEOs crowing today, then you would say 'let's get a better deal,'" she said in the interview on Friday, adding that Trump had said he was open to future negotiations. [nL1N1IZ0VE]

Trump created the business advisory group in December before taking office to assist him in making policy decisions. The council is led by Stephen Schwarzman, chief executive of Blackstone Group LP .

Blackrock Inc Chief Executive Larry Fink said on Thursday he would continue to serve on Trump's business forum, despite reservations about the White House climate decision because he believes he can add to policy discussions and be a voice for investors.

General Motors Co said Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra also would remain on the presidential advisory panel, while it remained unclear whether Ford Motor Co's new chief executive, James Hackett, would join the group.

In February, Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] CEO Travis Kalanick quit the business advisory council amid internal pressure over Trump's immigration policies. [nL1N1FN21P]

By Emily Flitter and Valerie Volcovici

NEW YORK/WASHINGTON, June 1 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday withdrawing the country from the Paris climate accord would stave off an economic crisis and protect American jobs - but many American companies seemed to disagree.

Criticism of his decision rolled in from blue-chip companies like Facebook Inc , Apple Inc , Ford Motor Co and Microsoft Corp , while the response from fossil fuel groups with the most to gain from a relaxation of U.S. carbon emissions standards was muted.

Tesla Inc Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk and Walt Disney Co CEO Robert Iger said they would leave White House advisory councils over Trump's decision. [nL3N1IY5QF]

In an interview on Thursday, the president of the World Coal Association, Benjamin Sporton, told Reuters that he had mixed feelings about Trump's announcement, adding he was eager to see a U.S. policy that actively promotes a place for coal in the global energy mix.

"What we really need to see, if the president wants to re-enter the deal, is that he can change the agreement to recognize the role of all sources of energy, including coal," Sporton said, adding his group had described to administration officials the benefits of remaining in the agreement.

The American Petroleum Institute, the oil and gas industry's biggest trade group, meanwhile, issued a statement saying it had never taken an official position on the Paris accord.

A number of its members, including Exxon Mobil Corp and ConocoPhillips , had publicly supported the deal.

"For us, our position on the Paris agreement... we need a framework like that to address the risks of climate change," Exxon Mobil CEO Darren Woods told reporters on the sidelines of the company's annual general meeting on Wednesday. [nL1N1IX15V]

Some other groups expressed measured support for Trump's decision, saying it provided an opportunity to fix problems with the deal.

"Manufacturers support the spirit of the Paris Agreement and the effort to address climate change through a fair international agreement. But as the president has acknowledged, certain elements of this deal were not equitable for U.S. manufacturers," said Ross Eisenberg, vice president for energy and resources policy at the National Association of Manufacturers, in a statement to Reuters.

A spokesman for Peabody Energy Corp , America's largest publicly traded coal miner, had said on Wednesday that the company would support a decision by Trump to withdraw from the Paris deal because the "accord is flawed on a number of levels."

Trump vowed during his campaign to pull the United States out of the Paris deal, arguing the pact would cost the United States trillions of dollars, kill jobs, and stymie economic growth without providing tangible benefit.

His critics have argued, however, that the risks of climate change require action, and that a shift to a low-carbon energy economy can create more jobs than it eliminates.

"A SETBACK"

Spokespeople for other extractive oil and mining groups, like the National Mining Association and the American Fuel & Petrochemicals Manufacturers, declined to comment on Trump's decision to withdraw from the Paris accord.

But a number of other business leaders derided it in forceful terms.

"Today's decision is a setback for the environment and for the U.S.'s leadership position in the world," said Goldman Sachs Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein in his first-ever tweet. [nL1N1IY2CK]

"Disappointed with today's decision on the Paris Agreement. Climate change is real. Industry must now lead and not depend on government," tweeted General Electric Co's Jeff Immelt.

Apple's CEO Tim Cook, meanwhile, posted to Twitter: "Decision to withdraw from the #ParisAgreeement was wrong for our planet" and "Apple is committed to fight climate change and we will never waver".

"Withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement is bad for the environment, bad for the economy, and it puts our children's future at risk," wrote Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg in a Facebook post.

UPDATE 3-Musk, Iger to quit Trump advisory councils after Paris accord decision - 路透新闻

{{20170602T014431.457+0000}}UPDATE 3-Musk, Iger to quit Trump advisory councils after Paris accord decision(Adds BlackRock CEO stays on Trump advisory council)

By David Shepardson

June 1 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk and Walt Disney Co CEO Robert Iger said on Thursday they would leave White House advisory councils after U.S. President Donald Trump said he would withdraw from the Paris climate accord.

Trump decided to pull the United States from the landmark 2015 global agreement designed to fight climate change despite entreaties from U.S. allies and corporate leaders in an action that fulfilled a major campaign pledge. [nL1N1IY0MV]

"Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world," Musk said in a Twitter post. He is a member of the President's Strategic and Policy Forum, a business advisory group, and Trump's manufacturing jobs council.

Musk said on Wednesday that he had done "all I can" to convince Trump to stay in the accord, and threatened to leave the presidential advisory councils if Trump announced a U.S. exit from the accord.

Iger wrote on Twitter that "as a matter of principle, I've resigned from the President's Council over the #ParisAgreement withdrawal." He is leaving the business advisory group.

Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] CEO Travis Kalanick quit the business advisory council in February amid pressure from activists and employees who opposed the administration's immigration policies.

Trump created the business advisory group in December before taking office to assist him in making policy decisions. The group is led by Stephen Schwarzman, chief executive of Blackstone Group LP and includes Indra Nooyi, the chief executive of PepsiCo Inc and Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase & Co .

Late on Thursday, BlackRock Inc Chief Executive Larry Fink said he would continue to serve on Trump's CEO Forum, despite reservations about the White House decision to withdraw from the Paris accord.

"I accepted the invitation to serve on the President's CEO Forum because I believe I can contribute to the policy dialogue in Washington and serve as a voice for investors," Fink said in a statement.

"I am a strong believer that our industry needs to have a voice with governments around the world," said Fink, whose company is the world's largest asset manager, with $5.4 trillion under management.

"I do not agree with all of the president's policies and decisions, including today's announcement to exit the U.S. from the Paris Agreement which I believe is a critical step forward in addressing climate change."

Asked about Musk's resignation, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross told Fox News that "anybody who read the agreement and understood it would realize that this was not really about climate, this was about U.S. money going to other countries and it didn't solve the climate problem."

Musk has met with Trump several times and spoken with him about the long-term goal of his company SpaceX for flights to Mars carrying humans.

The White House is planning to a hold a meeting with technology leaders on June 19, an administration spokesman said Wednesday.

General Motors Co said Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra would remain on the presidential advisory panel, adding that her participation "provides GM a seat at an important table to contribute to a constructive dialogue about key policy issues."

In 2013, GM signed a declaration joining other major companies arguing that responding to climate change was good business. The automaker said on Thursday that despite the withdrawal it "will not waver from our commitment to the environment."

It was unclear whether Ford Motor Co's new chief executive, James Hackett, would join Trump's panel.

Ford spokeswoman Christin Baker said on Thursday the No.2 U.S. automaker believes "climate change is real, and remain deeply committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions in our vehicles and our facilities."

UPDATE 1-Canadian auto sales surge to record high in May - 路透新闻

{{20170601T213149.685+0000}}UPDATE 1-Canadian auto sales surge to record high in May(Adds data for Ford and Fiat Chrysler, analyst commentary)

By Allison Lampert

MONTREAL, June 1 (Reuters) - Canadian auto sales hit a record high in May, with General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co on Thursday reporting double-digit increases, fueled by demand for crossovers and light trucks, according to analysts who compile the monthly data.

One economist attributed the record May sales to discounting among the large automakers in a fight for market share.

Automakers sold 216,861 vehicles in May, a number which "smashed all previous monthly records," and was up 11 percent compared with the same month a year earlier, Canadian auto analyst Dennis DesRosiers wrote in a note.

Year-to-date auto sales in Canada reached 835,582 units representing a 4.7 percent increase over the previous year, DesRosiers wrote.

Scotiabank senior economist Carlos Gomes attributed the strong May sales figures to discounting. "I would call it incentive heaven," he said by phone from Toronto.

Gomes said he now expects another record-breaking year for Canadian auto sales. He plans to revise his April forecast that said Canadian auto sales would decline slightly in 2017 to about 1.94 million vehicles, from a record-breaking 1.97 million units in 2016.

By contrast, in the United States, automakers reported sales fell 1 percent from a year ago. This brought the annualized sales pace down to 16.66 million cars and light trucks from 17.17 million vehicles a year ago, according to figures compiled by Motor Intelligence. [nL1N1IY12W]

"We're going to have to increase our Canadian forecast and reduce our U.S. forecast," Gomes said.

In Canada, Ford reported the sale of 34,486 vehicles, up 17 percent compared with the same month a year earlier and the best sales for a month of May since 1989.

General Motors said it sold 31,149 vehicles in Canada last month, a 36 percent rise compared with a year earlier, fueled by demand for crossovers and light trucks.

The company added that was its best performance for May in eight years. It contrasted with a 16.4 percent drop in sales in May 2016 versus the year-earlier period.

Fiat Chrysler said it sold 33,186 vehicles, up 5 percent from May 2016 and the highest monthly Canadian sales in its history.

U.S. plans to quickly update self-driving guidelines - 路透新闻

{{20170605T193855.936+0000}}U.S. plans to quickly update self-driving guidelinesBy David Shepardson

DETROIT/WASHINGTON, June 5 (Reuters) - The Trump administration will unveil revised self-driving guidelines within the next few months, the head of the U.S. Transportation Department said on Monday, responding to automakers' calls for regulations that will sanction their costly efforts to put autonomous vehicles on the road.

U.S. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao said in February she was reviewing self-driving vehicle guidance issued by the Obama administration in September, but on Monday said the new guidelines "will be released in the next few months, if not sooner." Chao said the new guidelines "will point to a path forward for the safe deployment of automated vehicles."

Chao was not specific about what her department's proposals would include, or how they would differ from policy guidance proposed by the Obama administration.

Companies including Alphabet Inc's self-driving car Waymo unit, General Motors Co , Ford Motor Co , Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL], Tesla Inc and other are aggressively pursuing automated vehicle technologies.

"We need a more concrete regulatory framework," Ken Washington, chief technology officer of Ford Motor Co, said in Detroit. Automakers could use a clear set of rules to certify on their own that an autonomous vehicle is safe, as they can now with conventional vehicles, Washington said.

Ford executive chairman Bill Ford Jr said at a forum in Washington he feels "quite confident" that the hardware and software will be ready by 2021 for self-driving cars. But other big issues loom. "Things like ethics," Ford said, saying does the vehicle opt to save 10 pedestrians or the driver. Individual automakers cannot program separate ethics software for self-driving cars but must work together as an industry, Ford said.

Ron Medford, Waymo's director of safety, said in Detroit he expected autonomous cars would appear first in "managed fleet operations," not as vehicles sold to individuals.

Chao, in remarks prepared for delivery in Detroit, said the new rules would support industry innovation and aim to encourage "new entrants and ideas that deliver safer vehicles."

Automakers have met with Chao on several occasions in recent months and urged her to make changes to Obama-era automated vehicle rules.

Republicans on the House Energy and Commerce Committee have also been working on a package of legislation to make it easier to get self-driving cars on the road. A U.S. Senate committee is also planning a new hearing this month on self-driving cars.

The Obama guidelines called on automakers to voluntarily submit details of self-driving vehicle systems to regulators in a 15-point "safety assessment" and urge states to defer to the federal government on most vehicle regulations.

Automakers have raised numerous concerns about the guidance, including that it requires them to turn over significant data, could delay testing by months and lead to states making the voluntary guidelines mandatory.

UK new car sales fall 8.5 pct in May ahead of election  - 路透新闻

{{20170605T081920.196+0000}}UK new car sales fall 8.5 pct in May ahead of election LONDON, June 5 (Reuters) - British new car registrations fell 8.5 percent last month, an industry body said on Monday, blaming the decline on the run-up to this week's national election and the effect of an April tax hike which boosted demand earlier in the year.

Car sales dropped to 186,265 vehicles in May, with a 14 percent slump in demand to consumers and a 5.3 percent drop in fleet business registrations, according to data from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT).

"We expected demand in the new car market to remain negative in May due to the pull-forward to March," SMMT Chief Executive Mike Hawes said, referring to a rise in vehicle excise duty which boosted demand before it came into effect in April.

"Added to this, the general election was always likely to give many pause for thought and affect purchasing patterns in the short term," he said.

Demand for diesel continued to fall last month with demand down 20 percent, as a series of tax hikes in London and possible levies in other cities continued to dampen demand. [nL8N1I71FS]

{{20170602T224001.121+0000}}UPDATE 3-Big U.S. companies stay on White House panel despite climate jolt* Some CEOs will not abandon presidential advisory boards

* Among them are CEOs of Wal-Mart, IBM, JPMorgan Chase

By David Shepardson and Susan Heavey

WASHINGTON, June 2 (Reuters) - Several major U.S. companies, including Wal-Mart Stores Inc , JP Morgan Chase & Co and IBM Corp , on Friday said their CEOs will remain in an influential presidential advisory group despite objecting to President Donald Trump's withdrawal from the Paris climate accord.

Citing the need to stay engaged with the administration, business leaders said they would remain in their advisory roles to continue working to influence White House policies.

Trump, a Republican, on Thursday said he would pull the United States from the landmark 2015 global agreement to fight climate change, drawing anger and condemnation from world leaders and heads of industry. [nL1N1IY0MV] [nL1N1IZ1BA]

"Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world," Musk said in a Twitter post on Thursday. He was a member of the business advisory group, known as the President's Strategic and Policy Forum. He also belonged to Trump's manufacturing jobs council.

Asked about CEOs' criticism of the U.S. withdrawal, White House spokesman Sean Spicer on Friday said some companies that expressed support for remaining in the agreement raised concerns about the emissions reduction targets.

Spicer, speaking to reporters at a daily news conference, added he does not know if Trump will replace Musk and Iger on the business council.

A spokesman for Wal-Mart Stores Inc , the largest U.S. retailer, said on Friday that Chief Executive Doug McMillon will remain on the business council.

McMillon said in a Facebook post late on Thursday he was "disappointed in today's news about the Paris Agreement. We think it's important for countries to work together to reduce greenhouse gas emissions."

IBM CEO Ginni Rometty will remain on the council, the company said on Friday as it reaffirmed its support for the Paris accord.

"IBM believes we can make a constructive contribution by having a direct dialogue with the administration – as we do with governments around the world," a company spokeswoman said.

Cleveland Clinic Chief Executive Toby Cosgrove will also remain on the council, a spokeswoman said.

Another prominent chief executive, Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase & Co , criticized Trump's decision. The company acknowledged Friday that he would not step down from Trump's business group.

"I absolutely disagree with the administration on this issue, but we have a responsibility to engage our elected officials to work constructively and advocate for policies that improve people's lives and protect our environment," Dimon said in a statement.

PepsiCo Inc Chief Executive Indra Nooyi is expected to remain on the council. The company said in a statement on Friday that while it is "disappointed with the announcement, we hope there is a way for the accord to move forward with the U.S. at the table."

'LET'S GET A BETTER DEAL'

Other chief executives also issued statements criticizing the decision to withdraw from the accord, including the heads of Facebook Inc , Alphabet Inc and Goldman Sachs .

General Electric Co CEO Jeff Immelt, who is on Trump's manufacturing council, said on Thursday he was disappointed in the decision and added: "Industry must now lead and not depend on government."

Immelt will remain on the council, a company spokeswoman said on Friday.

AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka, who is also on Trump's manufacturing council, called the withdrawal "a failure of American leadership." A union spokesman said on Friday that Trumka intends to remain on the council to serve "as a voice for working people." Boeing Co Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg also will remain on the manufacturing council, the company said.

Trump administration officials pushed back against company criticisms in television interviews on Friday.

National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn dismissed concerns about potential economic fallout from the climate deal withdrawal, such as the potential of other countries slapping tariffs on American manufacturers.

In an interview on CNBC on Friday, Cohn said the move was part of the administration's efforts to boost U.S. economic growth and help companies by increasing demand for U.S. goods, along with other efforts targeting regulations, taxes and infrastructure.

"If we can grow our economy, we're going to consume more and more products," he said. "We're going to need more manufacturing in the United States just to deal with domestic consumption."

The issue could resurface later this month when, according to an administration spokesman, the White House plans to hold a June 19 meeting with technology leaders.

Kellyanne Conway, a White House senior adviser, said on Fox News the deal would have "a statistically insignificant impact on the environment."

"If you really cared about that piece, and you're one of these CEOs crowing today, then you would say 'let's get a better deal,'" she said in the interview on Friday, adding that Trump had said he was open to future negotiations. [nL1N1IZ0VE]

Trump created the business advisory group in December before taking office to assist him in making policy decisions. The council is led by Stephen Schwarzman, chief executive of Blackstone Group LP .

Blackrock Inc Chief Executive Larry Fink said on Thursday he would continue to serve on Trump's business forum, despite reservations about the White House climate decision because he believes he can add to policy discussions and be a voice for investors.

General Motors Co said Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra also would remain on the presidential advisory panel, while it remained unclear whether Ford Motor Co's new chief executive, James Hackett, would join the group.

In February, Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] CEO Travis Kalanick quit the business advisory council amid internal pressure over Trump's immigration policies. [nL1N1FN21P]

RPT-Trump withdrawal from climate deal disappoints many U.S. companies - 路透新闻

{{20170602T110501.633+0000}}RPT-Trump withdrawal from climate deal disappoints many U.S. companies(Repeats story that ran late June 1 with no changes to text)

By Emily Flitter and Valerie Volcovici

NEW YORK/WASHINGTON, June 1 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday withdrawing the country from the Paris climate accord would stave off an economic crisis and protect American jobs - but many American companies seemed to disagree.

Criticism of his decision rolled in from blue-chip companies like Facebook Inc , Apple Inc , Ford Motor Co and Microsoft Corp , while the response from fossil fuel groups with the most to gain from a relaxation of U.S. carbon emissions standards was muted.

Tesla Inc Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk and Walt Disney Co CEO Robert Iger said they would leave White House advisory councils over Trump's decision. [nL3N1IY5QF]

In an interview on Thursday, the president of the World Coal Association, Benjamin Sporton, told Reuters that he had mixed feelings about Trump's announcement, adding he was eager to see a U.S. policy that actively promotes a place for coal in the global energy mix.

"What we really need to see, if the president wants to re-enter the deal, is that he can change the agreement to recognize the role of all sources of energy, including coal," Sporton said, adding his group had described to administration officials the benefits of remaining in the agreement.

The American Petroleum Institute, the oil and gas industry's biggest trade group, meanwhile, issued a statement saying it had never taken an official position on the Paris accord.

A number of its members, including Exxon Mobil Corp and ConocoPhillips , had publicly supported the deal.

"For us, our position on the Paris agreement... we need a framework like that to address the risks of climate change," Exxon Mobil CEO Darren Woods told reporters on the sidelines of the company's annual general meeting on Wednesday. [nL1N1IX15V]

Some other groups expressed measured support for Trump's decision, saying it provided an opportunity to fix problems with the deal.

"Manufacturers support the spirit of the Paris Agreement and the effort to address climate change through a fair international agreement. But as the president has acknowledged, certain elements of this deal were not equitable for U.S. manufacturers," said Ross Eisenberg, vice president for energy and resources policy at the National Association of Manufacturers, in a statement to Reuters.

A spokesman for Peabody Energy Corp , America's largest publicly traded coal miner, had said on Wednesday that the company would support a decision by Trump to withdraw from the Paris deal because the "accord is flawed on a number of levels."

Trump vowed during his campaign to pull the United States out of the Paris deal, arguing the pact would cost the United States trillions of dollars, kill jobs, and stymie economic growth without providing tangible benefit.

His critics have argued, however, that the risks of climate change require action, and that a shift to a low-carbon energy economy can create more jobs than it eliminates.

"A SETBACK"

Spokespeople for other extractive oil and mining groups, like the National Mining Association and the American Fuel & Petrochemicals Manufacturers, declined to comment on Trump's decision to withdraw from the Paris accord.

But a number of other business leaders derided it in forceful terms.

"Today's decision is a setback for the environment and for the U.S.'s leadership position in the world," said Goldman Sachs Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein in his first-ever tweet. [nL1N1IY2CK]

"Disappointed with today's decision on the Paris Agreement. Climate change is real. Industry must now lead and not depend on government," tweeted General Electric Co's Jeff Immelt.

Apple's CEO Tim Cook, meanwhile, posted to Twitter: "Decision to withdraw from the #ParisAgreeement was wrong for our planet" and "Apple is committed to fight climate change and we will never waver".

"Withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement is bad for the environment, bad for the economy, and it puts our children's future at risk," wrote Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg in a Facebook post.

UPDATE 3-Musk, Iger to quit Trump advisory councils after Paris accord decision - 路透新闻

{{20170602T014431.457+0000}}UPDATE 3-Musk, Iger to quit Trump advisory councils after Paris accord decision(Adds BlackRock CEO stays on Trump advisory council)

By David Shepardson

June 1 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk and Walt Disney Co CEO Robert Iger said on Thursday they would leave White House advisory councils after U.S. President Donald Trump said he would withdraw from the Paris climate accord.

Trump decided to pull the United States from the landmark 2015 global agreement designed to fight climate change despite entreaties from U.S. allies and corporate leaders in an action that fulfilled a major campaign pledge. [nL1N1IY0MV]

"Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world," Musk said in a Twitter post. He is a member of the President's Strategic and Policy Forum, a business advisory group, and Trump's manufacturing jobs council.

Musk said on Wednesday that he had done "all I can" to convince Trump to stay in the accord, and threatened to leave the presidential advisory councils if Trump announced a U.S. exit from the accord.

Iger wrote on Twitter that "as a matter of principle, I've resigned from the President's Council over the #ParisAgreement withdrawal." He is leaving the business advisory group.

Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] CEO Travis Kalanick quit the business advisory council in February amid pressure from activists and employees who opposed the administration's immigration policies.

Trump created the business advisory group in December before taking office to assist him in making policy decisions. The group is led by Stephen Schwarzman, chief executive of Blackstone Group LP and includes Indra Nooyi, the chief executive of PepsiCo Inc and Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase & Co .

Late on Thursday, BlackRock Inc Chief Executive Larry Fink said he would continue to serve on Trump's CEO Forum, despite reservations about the White House decision to withdraw from the Paris accord.

"I accepted the invitation to serve on the President's CEO Forum because I believe I can contribute to the policy dialogue in Washington and serve as a voice for investors," Fink said in a statement.

"I am a strong believer that our industry needs to have a voice with governments around the world," said Fink, whose company is the world's largest asset manager, with $5.4 trillion under management.

"I do not agree with all of the president's policies and decisions, including today's announcement to exit the U.S. from the Paris Agreement which I believe is a critical step forward in addressing climate change."

Asked about Musk's resignation, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross told Fox News that "anybody who read the agreement and understood it would realize that this was not really about climate, this was about U.S. money going to other countries and it didn't solve the climate problem."

Musk has met with Trump several times and spoken with him about the long-term goal of his company SpaceX for flights to Mars carrying humans.

The White House is planning to a hold a meeting with technology leaders on June 19, an administration spokesman said Wednesday.

General Motors Co said Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra would remain on the presidential advisory panel, adding that her participation "provides GM a seat at an important table to contribute to a constructive dialogue about key policy issues."

In 2013, GM signed a declaration joining other major companies arguing that responding to climate change was good business. The automaker said on Thursday that despite the withdrawal it "will not waver from our commitment to the environment."

It was unclear whether Ford Motor Co's new chief executive, James Hackett, would join Trump's panel.

Ford spokeswoman Christin Baker said on Thursday the No.2 U.S. automaker believes "climate change is real, and remain deeply committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions in our vehicles and our facilities."

His critics have argued, however, that the risks of climate change require action, and that a shift to a low-carbon energy economy can create more jobs than it eliminates.

"A SETBACK"

Spokespeople for other extractive oil and mining groups, like the National Mining Association and the American Fuel & Petrochemicals Manufacturers, declined to comment on Trump's decision to withdraw from the Paris accord.

But a number of other business leaders derided it in forceful terms.

"Today's decision is a setback for the environment and for the U.S.'s leadership position in the world," said Goldman Sachs Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein in his first-ever tweet. [nL1N1IY2CK]

"Disappointed with today's decision on the Paris Agreement. Climate change is real. Industry must now lead and not depend on government," tweeted General Electric Co's Jeff Immelt.

Apple's CEO Tim Cook, meanwhile, posted to Twitter: "Decision to withdraw from the #ParisAgreeement was wrong for our planet" and "Apple is committed to fight climate change and we will never waver".

"Withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement is bad for the environment, bad for the economy, and it puts our children's future at risk," wrote Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg in a Facebook post.

UPDATE 1-Canadian auto sales surge to record high in May - 路透新闻

{{20170601T213149.685+0000}}UPDATE 1-Canadian auto sales surge to record high in May(Adds data for Ford and Fiat Chrysler, analyst commentary)

By Allison Lampert

MONTREAL, June 1 (Reuters) - Canadian auto sales hit a record high in May, with General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co on Thursday reporting double-digit increases, fueled by demand for crossovers and light trucks, according to analysts who compile the monthly data.

One economist attributed the record May sales to discounting among the large automakers in a fight for market share.

Automakers sold 216,861 vehicles in May, a number which "smashed all previous monthly records," and was up 11 percent compared with the same month a year earlier, Canadian auto analyst Dennis DesRosiers wrote in a note.

Year-to-date auto sales in Canada reached 835,582 units representing a 4.7 percent increase over the previous year, DesRosiers wrote.

Scotiabank senior economist Carlos Gomes attributed the strong May sales figures to discounting. "I would call it incentive heaven," he said by phone from Toronto.

Gomes said he now expects another record-breaking year for Canadian auto sales. He plans to revise his April forecast that said Canadian auto sales would decline slightly in 2017 to about 1.94 million vehicles, from a record-breaking 1.97 million units in 2016.

By contrast, in the United States, automakers reported sales fell 1 percent from a year ago. This brought the annualized sales pace down to 16.66 million cars and light trucks from 17.17 million vehicles a year ago, according to figures compiled by Motor Intelligence. [nL1N1IY12W]

"We're going to have to increase our Canadian forecast and reduce our U.S. forecast," Gomes said.

In Canada, Ford reported the sale of 34,486 vehicles, up 17 percent compared with the same month a year earlier and the best sales for a month of May since 1989.

General Motors said it sold 31,149 vehicles in Canada last month, a 36 percent rise compared with a year earlier, fueled by demand for crossovers and light trucks.

The company added that was its best performance for May in eight years. It contrasted with a 16.4 percent drop in sales in May 2016 versus the year-earlier period.

Fiat Chrysler said it sold 33,186 vehicles, up 5 percent from May 2016 and the highest monthly Canadian sales in its history.

Most of 46.2 million recalled Takata inflators in U.S. not fixed - senator - 路透新闻

{{20170601T123001.248+0000}}Most of 46.2 million recalled Takata inflators in U.S. not fixed - senatorBy David Shepardson

WASHINGTON, June 1 (Reuters) - More than 65 percent of 46.2 million recalled Takata Corp <7312.T> airbag inflators in the United States have not been repaired, a U.S. senator said on Thursday, urging automakers to speed up the pace of repairs.

Senator Bill Nelson of Florida said only 15.8 million inflators out of 46.2 million inflators recalled to date have been repaired through mid-May, though nationwide recalls began in 2015. He was citing answers submitted from a National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) independent monitor.

About 8.8 million owners had received recall notices, Nelson said, but they were told no replacement parts were currently available.

The affected Takata inflators can explode with excessive force, unleashing metal shrapnel inside cars and trucks. They have been blamed for at least 16 deaths and more than 180 injuries worldwide.

Inflator recalls began around 2008 and involve around 100 million inflators around the world used in vehicles made by 19 automakers, including Honda Motor Co <7267.T>, Ford Motor Co , Volkswagen AG and Tesla Inc .

Last month, four automakers involved in the recalls agreed to a $553 million settlement covering owners of nearly 16 million vehicles with Takata airbag inflators, and agreed to take new steps to encourage owners to get recall repairs made. [nL2N1IL1O0]

Toyota Motor Corp's <7203.T> share of the settlement costs is $278.5 million, followed by BMW AG at $131 million, Mazda Motor Co <7261.T> at $76 million and Subaru Corp <7270.T> at $68 million.

Nelson noted the administration of President Donald Trump still had not nominated a candidate to lead NHTSA. "We're in desperate need of a leader who will commit to resolving this Takata mess," Nelson said in a statement.

In February, Takata pleaded guilty to U.S. charges of criminal wrongdoing and to pay $1 billion to resolve a federal investigation into its inflators.

The majority of the air bag-related fatalities and injuries have occurred in the United States, and most of them in Honda vehicles.

Automakers have recalled 46 million Takata air bag inflators in 29 million U.S. vehicles. By 2019, automakers will recall 64 million to 69 million U.S. inflators in 42 million total vehicles, NHTSA said in December.

Takata has been searching for more than a year for a financial sponsor to pay the replacement costs for its inflators which are at the center of the auto industry's biggest recall.
