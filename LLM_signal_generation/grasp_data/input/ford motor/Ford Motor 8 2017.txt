ANALYSIS-Mining's new normal: Tackling growth in the shadow of austerity - Reuters News

{{20170831T104713.191+0000}}ANALYSIS-Mining's new normal: Tackling growth in the shadow of austerity* BHP, Rio Tinto, Glencore back from commodities crash

* But investors eye payouts, debt cuts, safety - all at once

* Asset sales key for incoming BHP chairman MacKenzie

* BHP shale exit shows tightrope miners now face

By James Regan and Barbara Lewis

SYDNEY/LONDON, Aug 31 (Reuters) - Global mining heads may have thought they'd seen it all in the last five years, navigating a recovery after a commodities boom turned to bust. As the cycle turns, it brings a new challenge: tackling growth in an industry still scarred by its excesses.

It comes just in time for Ken MacKenzie, who starts as chairman of BHP , the world's biggest miner, on Sept. 1. Like peers Rio Tinto and Glencore , BHP has just racked up its best profit and cash flow in years on rising global demand for staples likes iron ore and coal. [nL4N1L75D4]

But this time, amid the cash piles, investors are reminding miners of messy mega-deals that cost previous executives their jobs. With activists like Elliott Management in their ranks, those investors want miners to balance investment in new and existing deposits with decent dividends, and a pledge to keep debt under control.

"Greater returns are warranted to some degree, and it's what everyone ultimately wants," said Bennelong Australian Equity Partners manager Julian Beaumont, who manages shares in BHP. "But at the same time there has to be discipline with enough capital available to grow and control debt."

Sober investment may be familiar territory for MacKenzie, a 53-year-old Canadian veteran of the packaging industry, who was hired in June to succeed former Ford Motor Co head Jac Nasser.

But close scrutiny of how he, BHP Chief Executive Andrew Mackenzie (no relation) and their peers at Rio and Glencore spend profits will be a test in mining's brave - lean - new world.

BHP, Rio and Glencore declined Reuters' requests for comment for this story.

DEBT FOCUS

Just a few years ago, with China's economy surging, miners went on a buying spree: the high water mark was Rio's acquisition of aluminium producer Alcan for $38 billion. About the same time, former BHP CEO Marius Kloppers was lining up an $80 billion spending budget.

Now, investors want cleaner balance sheets. Big projects are necessary - reserves must be replenished and are ever tougher to find. But ambitious ones like BHP's Jansen potash mine in Canada need to be tackled with partners - hence efforts to sell a $2 billion stake. [nL2N1LB15T]

"Commodities prices have helped with cash and we're seeing dividends, but things can turn very quickly, so I'd expect to see some prudence on their part," said Jason Beddow, chief executive at Argo Investments, which holds BHP and Rio shares. "I'd like to see them focus on paying down debt.

BHP's MacKenzie held around 100 meetings with shareholders, including Elliott, to sound out concerns before his official start as chairman, BHP has said.

In August Elliott became the second-biggest investor in BHP's London-listed arm, giving the fund the power to propose resolutions seeking board changes. Pressure from activists to shake up boardrooms cost the scalps of two BHP directors last week, both with long careers in oil and gas. [nL4N1L91QA]

Elliott declined Reuters' requests for comment for this article.

THE HARDEST LINE

The first in deep trouble when things went sour, Rio was also the quickest to recover.

Of the big three, Rio's shares are performing closest to benchmark indices and it now has the strongest balance sheet of the majors - something CEO Jean-Sebastien Jacques, appointed in July 2016, insists he will nurture with conservative targets on capital expenditure.

A number of fund managers contacted by Reuters for this article said Glencore had taken the hardest line in resisting richer payouts for investors. Glencore declared a flat first-half dividend, despite generating $2.5 billion in profits from higher coal, copper and other commodity prices.

Unlike the other mining bosses, Glencore's CEO Ivan Glasenberg is a major shareholder - but also one of the few remaining executives with a track record of opportunistic deals. For now, Glasenberg says his priority is keeping an investment grade rating by limiting debt and boosting returns. [nL5N1KM2XJ]

'IS THAT SMART?'

A key indicator for how miners handle the new investor ambience will be how BHP deals with its $20 billion foray into shale deposits in the United States, an asset bought a half-decade ago in a world of high oil prices. BHP is alone among the big three with assets in this field.

Widely diverging views on how BHP should handle this show how tough it may be to keep investors happy.

At the prodding of investors triggered by Elliott, BHP said in August the business was now under review and may be sold, at the right price. But with oil trading below $50 a barrel, sector consultants Rystad Energy estimated the division is worth only $5.1 billion.

"BHP wants to sell shale at the bottom of the cycle," said Ben Clark, a fund manager for TMS Capital who manages Rio shares, adding shareholders would see returns battered.

"Is that smart?"

UPDATE 1-Ford looks at self-driving systems for commercial trucks -executive - Reuters News

{{20170830T175135.982+0000}}UPDATE 1-Ford looks at self-driving systems for commercial trucks -executive(Adds background on autonomous driving technology)

By Paul Lienert

DETROIT, Aug 30 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co is considering deploying self-driving vehicle technology in larger commercial vehicles and is working with multiple partners to put its autonomous vehicles on the road, a senior Ford executive told Reuters on Tuesday.

"We've been talking with different partners in different industries" about potential applications for Ford's first self-driving vehicle in 2021, including ride-sharing and delivery services," Sherif Marakby, vice president of autonomous vehicles and electrification at Ford, said in an interview.

Marakby recently rejoined Ford from ride-services company Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL], where he oversaw development of self-driving vehicles. [nL4N1IR42T]

Ford Chief Executive Jim Hackett, who took over in May, is leading a review of the automaker's strategy, including its investments in electric and self-driving vehicles.

The company is already operating Transit vans in an "on-demand" shuttle service called Chariot, which is similar to Uber Technologies Inc's [UBER.UL] ride-hailing service, and eventually could outfit those vehicles with self-driving systems.

AUTONOMOUS PIZZA DELIVERY

Tesla Inc and some commercial truck makers are trying to develop self-driving trucks. Ford does not make Class 8, long-haul semi trucks, but the company does build light- and medium-duty F-series trucks and Transit vans that commercial customers use to deliver goods. [nL2N1LA0XJ]

Ford on Tuesday said it is teaming with Domino's Pizza to test Michigan consumers' reactions to having their meals delivered by self-driving vehicles. [nL2N1LE1GS]

It is working with "many other companies" to develop self-driving hardware, while its Pittsburgh-based Argo AI affiliate builds the "virtual driver" software, Marakby said.

Ford still plans to do much of its own systems integration work, he added. Some rival automakers have announced plans to share much of the engineering work and cost. Germany's BMW , for example, has partnered with Intel Corp , Delphi Automotive and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles .

"We're developing the technology and the (customer) interfaces to go to market directly with our partners," Marakby said. "We're open to other arrangements in the future."

There has been an explosion of interest in the past year in the development and potential deployment of self-driving vehicles - from car companies and component suppliers to technology giants and startups, as well as large corporations, universities and municipalities.

UPDATE 2-India cabinet approves raising levy on luxury cars, SUVs - Reuters News

{{20170830T140051.281+0000}}UPDATE 2-India cabinet approves raising levy on luxury cars, SUVs* Maximum levy to be hiked to 25 pct from 15 pct

* India's GST council to decide on timing of increase

* Audi says move to reduce sales, hurt revenues

(Adds comments from car makers Audi and Jaguar Land Rover)

NEW DELHI, Aug 30 (Reuters) - India's cabinet on Wednesday approved raising the maximum levy on luxury cars and sports utility vehicles (SUVs), drawing criticism from several car makers.

Rahil Ansari, India head of German luxury car maker Audi , said the move could lead to a double-digit dip in sales and force the company to rethink its plans for the country.

The levy is part of a nationwide goods and services tax (GST) launched last month to replace a multitude of provincial and national levies in the biggest tax reform in 70 years.

Under the new sales tax, vehicles are taxed at 18 percent or 28 percent with an additional levy of 15 percent on some types of cars.

The cabinet passed an executive order, or ordinance, to raise the maximum levy to 25 percent from 15 percent, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said.

"The ordinance is only an enabling law. This does not mean the cess (levy) will automatically increase," Jaitley said, adding that a panel of federal and state finance chiefs that form the GST council will decide on the timing and amount of increase.

Raising the levy will make luxury cars and SUVs more expensive and could hurt sales of companies like Mercedes-Benz, BMW , Volvo and Jaguar Land Rover, owned by Tata Motors . [nL4N1KT4B4]

Audi's Ansari said the move will be "detrimental", and force the company to raise prices and redraw its India plans.

"This is bound to adversely impact sales by possibly a double-digit reduction and will consequently reduce revenues for the company, dealers and perhaps also tax revenues for the government," Ansari said, adding that any increase should be postponed by 6 to 12 months.

Rohit Suri, managing director for Jaguar Land Rover in India said that since the implementation of GST, demand for luxury cars has been on the rise and a continuation of this would create jobs and enable more investments in local manufacturing.

"We earnestly hope the government and GST council will give due consideration to this matter and desist from raising the cess," Suri said.

Sales of auto makers such as Toyota Motor <7203.T>, Mahindra & Mahindra and Maruti Suzuki that sell SUVs in India could also be affected.

UPDATE 3-Harvey to hurt, then lift U.S. auto sales -analysts - Reuters News

{{20170829T192934.468+0000}}UPDATE 3-Harvey to hurt, then lift U.S. auto sales -analysts(Adds autos sales figures following Sandy in 2012)

By Nick Carey

DETROIT, Aug 29 (Reuters) - Tropical Storm Harvey is likely to briefly depress already slowing U.S. auto sales, but could eventually help boost demand as damaged cars are replaced, analysts said on Tuesday.

The catastrophic flooding in Houston, the fourth-largest U.S. city, could mean 2 percent fewer vehicles will be sold in August than previously expected, according to Edmunds.com.

"In subsequent months we'll likely see a slight localized bump in sales as the recovery takes hold and people are able to buy replacement vehicles," said Jessica Caldwell, executive director of industry analysis at Edmunds, in a statement.

Automakers were due to report August sales on Friday.

Before the storm, industry consultants JD Power and LMC had forecast sales for the month at a seasonally adjusted annualized rate of 16.6 million units, down nearly 3.5 percent from August 2016.

Auto loan applications in the Houston market have dropped roughly 80 percent since the storm came ashore on Friday, according to Cox Automotive's Dealertrack.

Cox Automotive said it had lowered its U.S. auto industry August sales forecast to a seasonally adjusted annualized rate of 16.3 million units from 16.6 million units.

After Superstorm Sandy caused widespread flooding in the New York metropolitan area in 2012, "we saw all of those lost sales made up in the subsequent few months and then some because of replacements for vehicles destroyed and damaged," Cox Automotive analyst Michelle Krebs said.

A sales rebound will depend on how quickly car owners file claims and the speed with which insurers process them, said Christopher Hopson, senior analyst at industry consultant IHS Markit.

"If the reaction is swift, we could start to see a pickup in sales as soon as late September or October," he said.

Hopson said insurers' swift response after Sandy in October 2012 fueled an almost immediate sales uptick.

Auto sales in New York in November 2012 rose 49 percent versus the previous year, according to Cox Automotive.

The Houston metropolitan market is the seventh largest in the United States, and ranks third in sales of large pickup trucks, which generate significant profits for the Detroit Three automakers, Krebs said.

General Motors Co , Ford Motor Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV went into August with hefty inventories of unsold pickups, and a post-storm sales bump could help clear out those trucks at higher prices.

It was not clear how many vehicles have been damaged by the storm.

Production at plants like Toyota Motor Corp's <7203.T> San Antonio, Texas, truck factory and a large GM-operated SUV plant in Arlington, Texas, have been unaffected, the companies said.

However, Volkswagen AG said on Tuesday that shipments of vehicles to the Port of Houston have been delayed because the facility is closed.

Auto dealerships around Houston have been flooded or had operations disrupted, industry officials said.

Mike Jackson, chief executive of AutoNation Inc , the largest U.S. auto retail chain, said on CNBC that 17 dealerships were closed following Harvey and that he did not know when they would reopen.

UPDATE 3-Renault-Nissan to build electric cars with China's Dongfeng - Reuters News

{{20170829T121044.045+0000}}UPDATE 3-Renault-Nissan to build electric cars with China's Dongfeng* Renault-Nissan, Dongfeng plan electric mini-SUV

* Partnership to use alliance tech, Dongfeng manufacturing

* Affordable EVs key to meeting new Chinese sales quotas

(Adds details of programme, background)

By Norihiko Shirouzu and Laurence Frost

BEIJING/PARIS, Aug 29 (Reuters) - The Renault-Nissan alliance has announced plans to build electric cars in China in a new venture with Dongfeng Motor <0489.HK>, joining the scramble by global automakers to meet Beijing's stringent quotas for zero-emission vehicles.

The venture, eGT New Energy Automotive Co, will develop an electric mini-SUV to go into production in 2019 by Dongfeng, the carmaking alliance said, for sale under the partners' own brands. Dongfeng already builds conventional vehicles with Nissan <7201.T> and its French parent Renault .

China, the world's biggest auto market, wants all-electric battery cars and plug-in hybrids to account for at least one-fifth of its vehicle sales by 2025, as policymakers grapple with alarming pollution levels in major cities. [nL4N1HX1HS]

Renault-Nissan so far leads the deployment of modern electric cars, thanks to the top-selling Nissan Leaf introduced in 2010 and Renault's Zoe subcompact launched two years later. But its leadership is being challenged by Tesla as well as more mainstream carmaker rivals.

Ford Motor Co said earlier this month it was exploring a joint venture with carmaker Anhui Zotye Automobile Co <000980.SZ> to build electric vehicles under a new brand, in competition with China manufacturing plans previously announced by Tesla, Daimler and General Motors . [nL4N1L82XX]

Renault and Nissan will each own a quarter of their venture with Dongfeng, which would hold the remaining 50 percent, the alliance said.

China's electrification push has changed the thinking of many automakers that had hitherto resisted investing heavily in pure-electric or rechargeable hybrid vehicles.

Hybrid pioneer Toyota <7203.T> had dismissed battery-only vehicles until it abruptly reversed course last year, confirming electric-car investment plans that largely reflect Beijing's demands. [nL4N1D81B5] [nL4N1DI2FS]

Renault-Nissan's move "confirms our common commitment to develop competitive electric vehicles for the Chinese market," alliance Chairman Carlos Ghosn said. The statement included no financial or product details.

However, Ghosn has previously discussed plans to "change the game" with a low-cost electric car priced below $8,000 after Chinese incentives - and ultimately without them. [nL8N1D43VA]

The programme is headed by Gerard Detourbet, who developed the conventionally powered Kwid budget SUV for India and is likely to use its architecture for the Chinese battery car, an alliance engineer with knowledge of the plans told Reuters.

China's latest quota proposals, due to take effect as soon as next year, would require 8 percent of automakers' sales to be battery electric or plug-in hybrids - rising to 10 percent in 2019 and 12 percent in 2020.

Beijing will present its final plans in coming days, German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung reported, adding penalties for non-compliance were likely to be softened after an outcry by global automakers. [nL8N1LF1GD] [nL8N1K44FT]

Ford teams with Domino's on self-driving pizza delivery test - Reuters News

{{20170829T040002.765+0000}}Ford teams with Domino's on self-driving pizza delivery testBy Paul Lienert

ANN ARBOR, Mich., Aug 29 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co and Domino's Pizza Inc in September will begin testing Michigan consumers' reactions to having their pies delivered by self-driving vehicles, the companies said on Tuesday.

It will not be the first experiment with advanced pizza delivery technology. Australia-based Domino's Pizza Enterprises , the Ann Arbor-based company's largest independent franchisee, has tested delivery to customers in New Zealand via drone and self-driving robot.

In a blog post last week, Sherif Marakby, head of Ford's autonomous and electric vehicles, signaled the automaker's broader ambitions, saying Ford planned to cooperate "with multiple partners" in deploying self-driving vehicles "designed to improve the movement of people and goods."

Previously, Ford executives had said the company expected to launch a self-driving shuttle for commercial ride-sharing fleets in 2021.

Domino's and Ford will deliver pizzas to randomly selected customers in the Ann Arbor area in a Ford Fusion Hybrid equipped with self-driving technology. The delivery vehicles initially will be piloted by human drivers.

Customers will be able to track the delivery process via GPS and will receive text messages on how to retrieve their pizzas once the dellivery vehicle has arrived.

A number of start-up delivery services, many of them funded by venture capital, have been experimenting with on-demand delivery of different packages, including groceries, prepared food and beverages. So have larger companies, from Uber Technologies [UBER.UL] to Amazon .[nL1N1E8065]

Opinion is still divided, however, on whether automation can help solve some vexing delivery problems, such as how to deliver pizzas economically to the fifth floor of a college dorm.

The Ford-Domino's test vehicle will not attempt to resolve that conundrum. It will stop outside the customer's house, so it will not provide true door-to-door delivery service.

"We're still focused on the last 50 feet," said Domino's spokeswoman Jenny Fouracre. "That's a big challenge - getting (the pizza) from the curb to the door."

BREAKINGVIEWS-Water woes may leave green-car hopes high and dry - Reuters Breakingviews

{{20170828T132758.020+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-Water woes may leave green-car hopes high and dry(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.)

By Antony Currie

NEW YORK, Aug 28 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Water problems could leave the burgeoning market for green cars high and dry. Ford is the latest to ramp up its electrification efforts with a planned joint venture with China's Anhui <000980.SZ>. Trouble is, the industry relies heavily on the Democratic Republic of Congo for cobalt to make electric vehicles' lithium-ion batteries.

Doing business in the DRC is challenging to begin with. In 2016 fresh violence erupted in parts of the country, displacing nearly a million people and raising fears of a revival of the civil war that raged for seven years at the turn of the century. Water woes add an extra level of difficulty.

Players like BHP Billiton need secure water supplies for their cobalt-mining operations. They also are big consumers of electricity, which is produced mostly by hydropower. With the Congo River running near 100-year lows after two years of drought, blackouts are a big risk.

Wastewater – the theme of the World Water Week conference that kicked off in Sweden on Sunday – is another problem. Adding untreated industrial sludge back into the river basin would make a bad situation worse: the majority of Congolese already lack access to safe drinking water.

Miscalculating water issues can be costly. Barrick Gold spent $5 billion on its Pascua Lama gold mine, which is still mothballed four years after a Chilean court forced its closure, citing pollution problems. BHP Billiton had to spend almost $2 billion on a desalination plant to ensure it had enough water for its operation in that country.

Electric vehicles will have to play a big role if governments and companies are to carry out the Paris climate-change accord and keep the globe's temperature increase below 2 degrees Celsius. The International Energy Agency estimates there will have to be 1.2 billion electric cars on the world's roads in 2060, up from just 2 million at the end of 2016.

Meeting that demand will require, by 2050, an almost 12-fold increase in the 121 million tonnes of cobalt mined last year, according to the World Bank. The DRC provided just over half that and holds almost 50 percent of global reserves of the metal, the World Bank estimates.

Cranking up production can generate billions of additional revenue for the impoverished country and help protect the global environment. Without adequate water, though, those opportunities will shrivel.

UPDATE 1-Harvey disrupts business, but some set to benefit - Reuters News

{{20170828T002103.618+0000}}UPDATE 1-Harvey disrupts business, but some set to benefit(Recasts, adds details)

By Dion Rabouin and Megan Davies

Aug 27 (Reuters) - Days before Hurricane Harvey barreled into the Texas coast on Friday, home improvement retailers were preparing truckloads of lumber, shingles and other materials that property owners in the storm-raked communities will need to rebuild.

The deliveries will have to wait, however, as 56 stores between Home Depot and Lowe's in southeast Texas remained closed as of Sunday amid widespread flooding. Once they reopen, the chains could be among the biggest beneficiaries of the post-storm recovery.

Lowe's has sent "500 truckloads" of supplies to the storm zone, said spokeswoman Sarah Lively. "We are reopening those stores as quickly as possible."

For the moment, the biggest storm to hit Texas in 50 years is posing a major disruption to one of the most important economic crossroads in the United States and the heart of its oil industry. Ports, railways and highways are closed or clogged, potentially blocking movement of key parts of the U.S. manufacturing supply chain.

Catastrophic flooding triggered by now Tropical Storm Harvey inundated Houston on Sunday, forcing residents of the fourth most populous U.S. city to flee their homes in anticipation of more days of "unprecedented" rainfall. [nL2N1LD06K]

The home improvement retailers, well versed in the business of disaster, are likely steps ahead of most companies.

At Home Depot, spokesman Matt Harrigan said preparations began "as soon as the storm was on the radar."

Both Home Depot and Lowe's said they have set up command centers to manage the response. Both companies also said they will freeze prices for lumber, roofing and other rebuilding materials for a time in the affected zone.

Other U.S. companies, including automakers, railroads and insurers, will likely be trying to send investors similar reassuring messages as trading starts on Monday.

BIG MARKET FOR TRUCKS

Texas is a significant vehicle market, particularly for highly profitable pickup trucks built by the big three Detroit automakers.

In the short term, the storm will hamper operations at dealers and could dampen August sales. But longer term, "it seems there has been enough flooding to damage thousands of light vehicles that will need replacing," said Nick Colas, an independent analyst based in New York City.

For insurers, the storm could be a mixed blessing.

"Insurers - from a long term point of view they can raise their rates, but some insurers, if they have a particular geographic or sector concentration can get really beaten up," said Michael Purves, chief global strategist at Weeden & Co.

"Maybe the winners are the companies that have the least damage but the most license to increase their premiums."

It was not clear on Sunday how the storm would affect supply chains for automakers and other manufacturers that depend on goods flowing to and from northern Mexico.

Ford Motor Co , General Motors Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV said on Sunday they had thus far not seen any impact or issues with getting parts across the storm zone but were monitoring the storm closely. The area of Mexico south of the storm zone is a major center for auto parts manufacturing.

BNSF Railway Co. and Union Pacific Corp , told customers they would likely curtail operations in flooded areas.

Tropical Storm Harvey disrupts businesses, but some may benefit - Reuters News

{{20170827T202534.343+0000}}Tropical Storm Harvey disrupts businesses, but some may benefitBy Dion Rabouin and Megan Davies

Aug 27 (Reuters) - Tropical Storm Harvey is challenging a wide range of industries beyond energy, including insurers, home improvement retailers and automakers, but some sectors may benefit.

The hurricane could weigh on energy stocks, be mixed for insurers and boost home improvement companies, analysts said on Sunday.

Home improvement companies Lowe's and Home Depot have temporarily frozen prices for lumber and roofing materials at stores in the area affected by Tropical Storm Harvey, even as flooding has forced the chains to close dozens of stores, the companies said on Sunday.

Home Depot has so far announced the closure of 42 stores while Lowe's has closed 14 stores in Houston and the surrounding area.

"Right now we have to play it by ear just to see what the conditions are going to be in those areas," said Sarah Lively, a spokeswoman for Lowe's. "We are reopening those stores as quickly as possible."

The companies are preparing for strong demand once the storm has passed and property owners can begin repairs. Both companies said building supplies had already been sent to nearby emergency response centers.

Lively said Lowe's had already sent "500 truckloads" of supplies to the impacted area. At Home Depot, spokesman Matt Harrigan said preparations began "as soon as the storm was on the radar."

Companies in other sectors are still assessing the impact of the storm, which washed over manufacturing supply lines and transportation routes that run from Mexico through southern Texas.

Ford Motor Co , General Motors Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV said on Sunday they had thus far not seen any impact or issues with getting parts across the storm zone but were monitoring the storm closely. The area of Mexico south of the storm zone is a major center for auto parts manufacturing.

Texas is a significant vehicle market, particularly for pickup trucks built by the big three Detroit automakers. In the short term, the storm is likely to hamper operations at dealers. But longer term, "it seems there has been enough flooding to damage thousands of light vehicles that will need replacing," said Nick Colas, an independent analyst based in New York City.

BNSF Railway Co. told customers on Friday it was halting train traffic in and out of its yard on Galveston Island, Texas, until further notice, company spokesman Gus Melonas said.

Union Pacific Corp , the No. 1 U.S. railroad, said late last week it would move rail cars in yards prone to flooding to high elevations and would curtail trains operating through areas likely to be hit by excessive winds and rain that will impact operations.

For insurers, the storm could be a mixed blessing.

"Insurers -- from a long term point of view they can raise their rates but some insurers, if they have a particular geographic or sector concentration can get really beaten up. Maybe the winners are the companies that have the least damage but the most license to increase their premiums," said Michael Purves, chief global strategist at Weeden & Co.

Harvey was expected to not have a big impact on the market as a whole.

"Markets, based on Asian trading, appear bullish. So I don't expect much of an impact on equities," said Jack Ablin, Chief Investment Officer, BMO Private Bank, a part of BMO Financial Group.

Colas said there would possibly be some chatter tomorrow about the effect of rebuilding on Q3/Q4 GDP, but said that would probably be small.

UPDATE 2-Ford poaches Key Safety CEO to run China business - Reuters News

{{20170824T085007.818+0000}}UPDATE 2-Ford poaches Key Safety CEO to run China business* Jason Luo to start with Ford on Sept 1

* Has been at helm of Key Safety for past 10 years

* Arrives as Ford launches new initiatives in China

(Recasts, adds analyst comment and Ford's China sales)

By Brenda Goh

SHANGHAI, Aug 24 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co has appointed Jason Luo, head of auto parts maker Key Safety Systems, to run its China operations, a move seen as signalling its resolve to revive sales in the world's biggest car market.

The U.S. automaker hopes Luo, the first executive from mainland China to hold its top job there, will reprise his work at KSS, where he engineered a significant surge in China revenue.

Ford's overall China sales were down 7 percent in the first half of the year, worse than the industry average of a 3.8 percent climb.

Foreign automakers in China are battling fierce competition from a swathe of local rivals, who are aggressively launching new models to grab market share. The market is also skewed by heavy government support for electric vehicles, prompting Ford to seek partners and expand local production.

The U.S. automaker announced last week it was considering setting up a venture with Anhui Zotye Automobile Co <000980.SZ> to build electric passenger vehicles in China under a new brand. [nL4N1L82XX]

Its Lincoln luxury unit also recently said it would start producing luxury SUVs in the country by 2019, and Ford is moving some production of its Focus small car to China.

Luo, who has spent the last decade at the helm of Michigan-based KSS, also has wide experience in M&A - overseeing its $920 million sale to China's Ningbo Joyson Electronic Corp <600699.SS> and the $1.6 billion purchase of the healthier assets of bankrupt Japanese airbag maker Takata Corp this year. [nL1N1JN00M]

"He's got the experience of elevating KSS into a global company and Ford wants to further localize, so it's not a surprise to see him come over," said Xing Lei, chief editor at China Automotive Review.

Luo has a bachelor of science degree in Mechanical Engineering from Beijing Institute of Technology, China and master degrees from U.S. universities.

The appointment will be effective Sept. 1.

He takes the reins from Peter Fleet, who has since July held both the China job as well as his current role of group vice president and president of Ford Asia Pacific.

BREAKINGVIEWS-Jeep sale would leave Marchionne nowhere to hide - Reuters Breakingviews

{{20170822T173656.818+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-Jeep sale would leave Marchionne nowhere to hide(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.)

By Antony Currie

NEW YORK, Aug 22 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Selling Jeep would leave Sergio Marchionne nowhere to hide. The Fiat Chrysler Automobiles chief executive advocates using M&A to stop carmakers wasting precious capital. Offloading the company's top brand to China's Great Wall Motor <601633.SS>, whose president has indicated interest, could raise billions. But it would leave an emaciated rump.

Great Wall's interest may stall in any event. With a market value of some $15 billion, it may struggle to secure financing or Beijing's approval for a deal larger than itself. Even if it succeeded, the Trump administration and the U.S. Congress are likely to balk at allowing such a large and iconic U.S. brand to end up in Chinese hands.

Fiat Chrysler, though, does need to do something. It is already the earnings straggler among the major automakers. Its pre-tax margin last year, at 2.8 percent, was the lowest of the group; Ford Motor and General Motors both cranked out just over 7 percent.

Things are improving as Marchionne shrugs off more of the debt that resulted in part from taking over Chrysler after the U.S. government-backed bankruptcy exit in 2009. But Fiat Chrysler is the only one of the top 12 that sell-side analysts reckon will fail to earn more than a 6 percent pre-tax margin in each of the next three years, according to Thomson Reuters data.

The $23 billion a Jeep sale might bring, according to Morgan Stanley, could be tempting, whether Great Wall or another carmaker ends up the buyer. It would clean up the balance sheet. Deep-pocketed players like Google , Apple and Intel are new rivals in the race towards autonomous driving. Lacking investment firepower, Marchionne has stayed largely on the technological sidelines, though last week he took his company into the Intel-Mobileye-BMW alliance .

Yet handing the keys to Jeep to a new owner would combust even the modest earnings that are currently anticipated. The brand may account for almost three-quarters of EBITDA next year, reckons Morgan Stanley. Ram trucks, Maserati and three captive parts makers are still profitable, but Alfa Romeo, Dodge and Chrysler are in the red. On top of that, the company still has more than $5 billion of both net debt and unfunded pensions.

Marchionne is due to step down next year to concentrate on running Ferrari. A radical move like selling Jeep would certainly leave a mark. But it would set up his last lap at what remained of Fiat Chrysler to be a dismal one.

CONTEXT NEWS

- Chinese carmaker Great Wall Motor on Aug. 22 reiterated its potential interest in acquiring part or all of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, Reuters reported, echoing a public statement by Great Wall a day earlier. As yet China's largest maker of sport-utility vehicles has not held talks or signed any deal with executives at the Italian-American maker of Alfa Romeos, Ram trucks and Jeeps, according to the report.

- Automotive News had initially reported the news, quoting Great Wall President Wang Fengying as saying she planned to contact FCA to discuss a deal for the Jeep brand.

UPDATE 1-Austria, carmakers agree to update software of 600,000 diesel cars - Reuters News

{{20170822T144509.164+0000}}UPDATE 1-Austria, carmakers agree to update software of 600,000 diesel cars(Adds detail, background)

VIENNA, Aug 22 (Reuters) - Austria's Transport Minister Joerg Leichtfried said on Tuesday he had agreed with carmakers to update the software of 600,000 diesel cars to reduce pollution following a similar deal struck in Germany after a large-scale emissions scandal.

Leichtfried said the deal also included extra payments to buyers of more environmentally friendly cars. He said that for potential buyers of electric cars all available financial help could add up to around 10,000 euros ($11,750) per vehicle.

The exact amount of incentives, which will come in addition to existing government sweeteners for e-car buyers, will be decided and paid by the carmakers depending on the model of the vehicle exchanged for an old car, the spokesman of Austrian car importers association Guenther Kerle said.

The Transport Ministry said representatives of Mercedes-Benz , BMW , Kia <000270.KS>, Ford , Renault , Porsche, Volkswagen , Audi, Seat, Skoda, Hyundai <011760.KS>, Mitsubishi Motors <7211.T> and Opel attended the meeting.

VW, Mercedes, Renault and possibly BMW will undertake the software updates, and the others will just take part in the incentives programme, the ministry said.

German politicians and car bosses agreed earlier this month to overhaul engine software on 5.3 million diesel cars to try to repair the industry's battered reputation. [nL5N1KO14A]

However, environmentalists said the plan - almost two years after Volkswagen admitted to cheating U.S. diesel emissions tests - was too little, too late.

The Austrian software update, which would take until spring next year and which carmakers say can reduce toxic nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions by 25-30 percent, is the same as in Germany, Kerle said.

Critics of the German plan have said software updates would only result in a cut of about 2-3 percent of emissions.

Leichtfried and Kerle said there was no agreement on hardware updates, but that this would be discussed at future meetings.

UPDATE 2-Ford, China's Zotye Auto plan JV to build electric vehicles - Reuters News

{{20170822T095909.726+0000}}UPDATE 2-Ford, China's Zotye Auto plan JV to build electric vehicles* Eyes 50-50 JV with Zotye Auto to create new brand

* Brand will sell all-electric vehicles in China

* Ford's sales are down 7 pct in China this year

(Updates to indicate pictures available)

By Brenda Goh

SHANGHAI, Aug 22 (Reuters) - Ford Motor is exploring setting up a joint venture with Chinese firm Anhui Zotye Automobile Co <000980.SZ> to build electric passenger vehicles in China under a new brand, tapping into a boom for such vehicles in the world's top auto market.

China, struggling with alarming pollution levels in major cities, is aggressively pushing plug-in vehicles and has poured in tens of billions in investment, research funding and subsidies, drawing many new automakers to launch projects.

Tesla , Daimler AG and General Motors are among firms that have already announced plans for making electric vehicles in China, which wants electric and plug-in hybrid cars to make up at least a fifth of the country's auto sales by 2025. [nL4N1HX1HS]

Ford, whose overall China sales are down 7 percent this year, said in a statement on Tuesday that it had signed a memorandum of understanding with Zotye Auto to build a new brand under which the electric vehicles will be sold. Both firms will hold a 50-50 stake in the JV, it said.

It did not provide details of financial commitments nor say by when it will take a firm decision on the JV.

Ford sees China as the fastest growing market in the world for new energy vehicles (NEV) and forecasts that segment to grow to six million vehicles per year by 2025, of which approximately four million would be all-electric.

The potential JV with Zotye Auto would represent a deepening of commitment to electric vehicles in China by Ford. In April, it outlined plans to offer by 2025 hybrid or fully electric versions of all models built in China with its domestic joint venture partner, Chongqing Changan Automobile Co Ltd <000625.SZ>. [nL3N1HR1V0]

However, it also said at the time that it would take a cautious approach to the market due to uncertainty about consumer interest and government policy.

Zotye, which Ford described as the market leader in China's all-electric small vehicle segment, sold more than 16,000 all-electric vehicles this year through July, representing a year-on-year growth of 56 percent, it said.

The privately-owned company, which is headquartered in China's coastal Zhejiang province, also makes sport utility vehicles and cargo trucks. On Monday, it reported a near six-fold jump in first-half profits. [nH9N1L1028]

Ford said it would release details about the brand, products and production volumes at a later date, pending a final agreement and regulatory approvals.

Ford says signs MoU with Chinese automaker to build electric vehicles in China - Reuters News

{{20170822T081859.866+0000}}Ford says signs MoU with Chinese automaker to build electric vehicles in ChinaSHANGHAI, Aug 22 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Company said on Tuesday it has signed a memorandum of understanding with Chinese firm Anhui Zotye Automobile Co <000980.SZ> to explore establishing a joint venture to build electric passenger vehicles in China.

It said in a e-mailed statement that the vehicles produced would be sold under a brand owned by the new joint venture in which both companies would hold a 50-50 stake.

Zotye, which Ford described as the market leader in China's all-electric small vehicle segment, sold more than 16,000 all-electric vehicles this year through July, representing a year-on-year growth of 56 percent, it said.

Ford becomes latest carmaker to launch UK scrappage scheme - Reuters News

{{20170822T075419.766+0000}}Ford becomes latest carmaker to launch UK scrappage schemeLONDON, Aug 22 (Reuters) - Ford on Tuesday became the latest carmaker to launch a car scrappage scheme in Britain, joining the likes of BMW and Mercedes-Benz , after months of procrastination from the government over whether to begin a national programme.

The U.S. automaker is offering customers a 2,000 pound ($2,580) discount off a range of many Ford models when they trade in their vehicles registered until the end of 2009.

BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Vauxhall, the British version of the Opel brand sold on the continent, have all launched similar schemes in recent weeks to incentivise motorists to reduce emissions by replacing their gas-guzzling models with greener cars.

The plans come after Britain once again delayed in July a decision over whether to introduce a nationwide or targeted vehicle scrappage scheme, with a consultation due to take place later this year, despite worries over emissions levels. [nL5N1KH21I]

"Ford shares society's concerns over air quality," its managing director in Britain Andy Barratt said on Tuesday.

"Removing generations of the most polluting vehicles will have the most immediate positive effect on air quality."

Ford, BMW, Vauxhall and Mercedes sell around 1 million cars in Britain, more than a third of all new car registrations.

The scrappage schemes will help support sales at a time when demand for new cars is beginning to slide substantially for the first time in around six years.

In July, new car registrations fell for the fourth consecutive month in a row, hit by a number of factors including uncertainty over Brexit and lack of clarity over future government plans around new levies on diesel models.

Britain's last government-backed scrappage scheme came in the wake of the financial crisis and ran for nearly a year from mid-2009, helping to support the car sector, which had been hit by nose-diving sales.

BlackBerry rally derailed as investors lose patience on turnaround - Reuters News

{{20170818T174741.201+0000}}BlackBerry rally derailed as investors lose patience on turnaroundBy Alastair Sharp

TORONTO, Aug 18 (Reuters) - BlackBerry Ltd shares have been plunging from their more than two-year high hit in June after lackluster earnings and competitive threats have raised doubts about prospects for a turnaround at the business software maker.

At Friday's price of about $8.70, BlackBerry's U.S.-traded shares have lost a quarter of their value since reaching a high of $11.74 on June 1.

The stock had rallied from a low of $6.65 in early March on hopes for the company's QNX industrial operating system for self-driving cars, but investors have started to reassess the yearslong effort by BlackBerry to move beyond the smartphones that made its name a household word.

"It's been a turnaround story now for about five years," said Joel Kulina, a technology-sector market maker for Wedbush Securities. "People don't have the patience."

Chief Executive Officer John Chen has spent years remaking BlackBerry as a software company focused on selling to automakers and other industrial businesses.

Revenue, which peaked at about $20 billion when BlackBerry was dominating the smartphone market, has fallen sharply. Analysts expect it to drop below $1 billion this year for the first time since 2004 and decline again in the following fiscal year.

"We're not going to jump in before we see some signs of turning the corner and establishing meaningful profitability," said wealth manager Chris Zaccarelli, whose Cornerstone Financial Partners in Huntersville, North Carolina, advises on $1.2 billion of assets.

In late June, BlackBerry reported quarterly earnings that missed analysts' forecasts due to an unexpected sales decline, ramping up pressure on the company to meet its goal of boosting software and services revenue by 10 percent to 15 percent this year.

BlackBerry declined to comment on the stock price, but QNX manager Grant Courville said it expected to sign deals with at least three major companies to get QNX into self-driving vehicles.

Last year BlackBerry announced a deal for Ford Motor Co to expand use of QNX, which is used mostly in car information and entertainment systems. The companies have provided few details on the arrangement.

QNX, which is already in most automobile "infotainment" systems, is one product that BlackBerry bulls talked up as the stock rallied earlier this year, saying the plans to expand its use in other parts of vehicles could generate significant revenue.

Yet investors "are figuring out that it isn't a straight path to a pot of gold" for QNX, said CIBC Markets analyst Todd Coupland.

Intel Corp poses one threat to QNX. The world's No. 1 chipmaker owns a rival operating system and this year paid $15.3 billion to buy Mobileye, a maker of sensors and cameras for self-driving vehicles.

Luxury carmaker Audi is using Intel's system in the safety-related electronic control unit for its 2018 A8 sedan, which will be one of the most advanced self-driving cars on the road.

Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T> last week joined a self-driving technology alliance whose members include Intel, Ericsson and Denso Corp <6902.T> but not BlackBerry.

BlackBerry's Courville discounted the threat from Intel. He said QNX was being used in at least six automotive programs based on Intel chips, some for self-driving vehicles.

Auto groups side with Canada, Mexico on NAFTA origin rules - Reuters News

{{20170817T213601.417+0000}}Auto groups side with Canada, Mexico on NAFTA origin rulesBy David Lawder and Anthony Esposito

WASHINGTON, Aug 17 (Reuters) - Auto industry groups from Canada, Mexico and the United States are pushing back against the Trump administration's demand for higher U.S. automotive content in a modernized North American Free Trade Agreement.

At talks underway this week in Washington, automaker and parts groups from all three countries were urging negotiators against tighter rules of origin, said Eduardo Solis, president of the Mexican Automotive Industry Association.

But U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer confirmed the industry's fears that the administration of President Donald Trump was seeking major changes to these rules to try to reduce the U.S. trade deficit with Mexico.

"Rules of origin, particularly on autos and auto parts, must require higher NAFTA content and substantial U.S. content. Country of origin should be verified, not 'deemed,'" Lighthizer said on Wednesday in opening remarks.

Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo and Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland both said they were not in favor of specific national rules of origin within NAFTA - a position that the industry agrees with.

"We certainly think a U.S.-specific requirement would greatly complicate the ability of companies, particularly small- and medium-size enterprises, to take advantage of the benefits of NAFTA," said Matt Blunt, president of the American Automotive Policy Council. The trade group represents Detroit automakers General Motors Co Ford Motor Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles .

His comments were echoed by Flavio Volpe, president of Canada's Automotive Parts Manufacturers Association.

"Anytime you say this list or a part of this list has to come from one specific country you're going to hurt all three countries," he said.

The United States had an autos and auto parts trade deficits of $74 billion with Mexico and $5.6 billion with Canada, both major components of overall U.S. goods trade deficits with its North American neighbors -- deficits that Lighthizer said could no longer continue.

Lighthizer's mention of tightening verification requirements is a reference to expanding the parts tracing list, which is used to determine whether companies meet the 62.5 percent North American content requirement for autos and 60 percent for components.

Devised in the early 1990s, the tracing list covers almost none of the sophisticated electronics found in today's cars and trucks, most of which come from Asia. Putting these on the tracing list could force suppliers to source these components from North America or pay tariffs on them. [nL1N1KW22J]

Volpe said any changes to this must also capture the North American system design work and software content for these components that is not currently included.

"A car today probably has 25 to 30 percent advanced electronics, software content in it. In 1994, it had zero or 1 percent," Volpe said. "Could you address the tracing to help you get to NAFTA compliance level by capturing some of the work that's being done in Silicon Valley or Waterloo, Canada? Yes."

John Bozzella CEO of the Association of Global Automakers, which represents international-brand carmakers, said NAFTA has allowed a major expansion of auto exports, with more than 1 million more vehicles built annually in the United States than in 1993.

"Negotiators should be mindful of this success as they work to modernize the agreement," Bozzella said, whose organization represents international brand carmakers with U.S. plants, including Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T>, Honda Motor Co Ltd <7267.T> and BMW .

UPDATE 2-Carmakers win brief reprieve from lawsuits over faulty Takata air bags - Reuters News

{{20170816T190244.196+0000}}UPDATE 2-Carmakers win brief reprieve from lawsuits over faulty Takata air bags(Adds details on the stay, background)

By Tracy Rucinski and Tina Bellon

Aug 16 (Reuters) - Automakers on Wednesday won a temporary reprieve from lawsuits filed by victims of defective air bags made by bankrupt Takata Corp <7312.T> that led to the largest-ever auto safety recall and at least 18 deaths.

The decision gives the Japanese auto supplier breathing room to work through its bankruptcy reorganization.

U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Brendan Shannon in Wilmington, Delaware, granted a 90-day halt on lawsuits brought by Hawaii, New Mexico, the U.S. Virgin Islands as well as individuals. He did not extend the shield to 48 federal cases that extend across several districts, saying the lawsuits had already advanced.

Takata <7312.T> argued for a six-month freeze on hundreds of lawsuits so management could complete a $1.6 billion sale of its viable operations, crucial to its reorganization, and replace air bag inflators that are subject to the biggest recall in automotive history.

Shannon said he was "extremely sensitive" to the plaintiffs' cases but believed a "breathing spell" for Takata was appropriate. The stay expires on Nov. 15.

At least 18 deaths and 180 injuries worldwide have been tied to a defect that causes Takata inflators to explode with excessive force, unleashing metal shrapnel inside vehicles. [nL1N1KI22B]

Major automakers including BMW AG , Ford Motor Co , Honda Motor Co Ltd <7267.T> and Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T>, argued in favor of the pause.

Takata and TK Holdings Inc, its U.S. unit, said they faced tens of billions of dollars in liabilities when they filed for bankruptcy protection in June, including claims from automakers that used its airbags and individuals who filed class-action lawsuits. [nL3N1JN07F]

Bankruptcy automatically stayed hundreds of lawsuits against TK Holdings for wrongful death, injuries, economic loss and breach of consumer protection laws stemming from the faulty airbags.

In July, the company asked the court to suspend lawsuits against automakers brought by airbag victims, and last week Takata separately filed for U.S. bankruptcy protection, or Chapter 15, in an effort to pause U.S. lawsuits against the parent. [nL1N1KV1JG]

The official bankruptcy committee that represents injured drivers said in court papers the injunction would have "human consequences" and prevent people from pursuing compensation.

The committee cited a 23-year-old New Jersey woman who became quadriplegic from brain injuries that a government investigator said were caused by a faulty Takata air bag.

The woman's lawyers estimated her economic loss would be $18 million, not including potential damages for pain and suffering.

The defective air bags have been linked to at least 18 deaths and 180 injuries worldwide.

The recall, the largest in automotive history, will eventually cover 125 million inflators, many of which still need to be replaced.

In January, Takata entered a settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice, setting aside $125 million to compensate consumers and $850 million in restitution for automakers. [nL1N1F3140]

UPDATE 1-Deutsche Post open to more electric van projects with Ford - Reuters News

{{20170816T095155.581+0000}}UPDATE 1-Deutsche Post open to more electric van projects with Ford* Deutsche Post, Ford present new StreetScooter Work XL van

* Deutsche Post says may sell Work XL model to third parties

* Says likely to pick second production site next month

(Adds further board member comment, details, background)

COLOGNE, Germany, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Deutsche Post said it would consider broadening an electric van alliance with U.S. carmaker Ford after teaming up to put zero-emissions delivery vans on the road.

Germany, the main market for the vehicles, is clamping down on toxic diesel fumes, and unveiled a 500 million euro ($587 million) fund this month to help municipalities invest in less polluting vehicles. [nL5N1KM2HR]

It would make sense to "think about further activities" with Ford, Deutsche Post board member Juergen Gerdes said on Wednesday, as the two companies presented their delivery van, the StreetScooter Work XL, for which Ford is supplying vehicle technology based on its Transit model. [nL8N1JB248]

Advances in manufacturing software are allowing auto industry newcomers such as Deutsche Post, Google and start-ups to tap suppliers to design, engineer and test new vehicle concepts without hiring thousands of engineering staff or investing billions in tooling and factories.

Deutsche Post initially developed an electric minivan dubbed StreetScooter for its own operations to avoid inner-city emissions after growth in online shopping resulted in increased parcel deliveries.

But in April it took on carmakers by unveiling plans to step up production and sell to other delivery firms. [nL8N1HJ1JV]

The group said on Wednesday it would eventually sell the new model being built with Ford components to third parties as well.

The model, which adds to the existing StreetScooter Work and Work L vans, is part of a plan to build another production site for the StreetScooter unit and double annual output to 20,000 vans by the end of the year.

Board member Gerdes said Deutsche Post would likely pick the location for the second production site next month.

Deutsche Post, which is also building a country-wide network of maintenance and repair shops, wants a fleet of at least 2,500 of the Work XL model on the road by the end of 2018.

BREAKINGVIEWS-Geely drives bumpy road toward global fame - Reuters Breakingviews

{{20170816T071951.696+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-Geely drives bumpy road toward global fame(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.)

By Pete Sweeney

HONG KONG, Aug 16 (Reuters Breakingviews) - China's Zhejiang Geely looks a prime candidate to become China's first truly international carmaker. That hope, plus surging domestic sales, has sent shares in Geely's Hong Kong-listed arm, Geely Automobile <0175.HK>, up more than 230 percent in a year. But the lure of overseas glory could distract. This company needs to keep winning at home.

It might seem odd that the Hangzhou-based company, whose founder claimed cars were just "four wheels and two sofas", would prove a market-beater, or end up owning stakes in Lotus and London Taxi. And yet boss Li Shufu is now dubbed "China's Henry Ford", and his company is one of China's most valuable publicly traded carmakers, worth $22 billion – more than Fiat Chrysler or Peugeot .

Graphic: Geely shares have outperformed Chinese rivals - and it is now more valuable than some global carmakers: http://reut.rs/2i3vIi9

On Wednesday, Geely Auto said first-half profit more than doubled to $649 million. Sales volume rose 89 percent to hit 621,731 units from January to July, thanks to popular new designs selling like hot cakes in China, even as the wider market grew just 2 percent.

It's impressive that Geely brands are so popular at home. This is a competitive arena with dozens of players. But momentum could quickly fade, and overseas sales cannot yet take up the slack. The company's vehicle exports make up less than 1 percent of total volume; they actually fell 64 percent in the first half.

Even so, growing overseas will be critical in the long term. To that end, Geely is developing a brand called Lynk & Co, a joint venture with Volvo whose cars will include a built-in ride-sharing button and other innovations. Geely is wisely pushing this "disruptive" brand at home first, where drivers love dashboard gee-gaws, then testing offshore markets.

Overly aggressive offshore expansion is a major risk; developing new auto brands is harder than generating headlines. Still, many industry-watchers doubted Li could make much of Volvo when he bought the Swedish brand from Ford for $1.8 billion in 2010, and at first cooperation was minimal. And yet Li's cautious approach to integration not only sustained the Swedes but has begun to benefit the parent. If he can keep within the speed limit, Geely could go all the way to global stardom.

CONTEXT NEWS

- Hong Kong-listed Geely Automobile Holdings said on Aug. 16 first-half net profit hit 4.3 billion yuan ($649 million), up 128 percent year on year. Total revenue rose to 39.4 billion yuan from 18.1 billion.

- Exports fell 64 percent to 3,848 units, making up just 0.7 percent of total sales.

German FinMin Schaeuble calls for stronger car industry regulation - Reuters News

{{20170815T183050.827+0000}}German FinMin Schaeuble calls for stronger car industry regulationBERLIN, Aug 15 (Reuters) - German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble, a leading member of Chancellor Angela Merkel's government, on Tuesday called for stronger regulation of the country's auto industry, which is embroiled in a widening emissions scandal.

Schaeuble told an event hosted by the Handelsblatt newspaper that the industry had made serious mistakes and must accept the consequences.

The future of the auto sector, Germany's biggest exporter and provider of some 800,000 jobs, has become a hot election issue as politicians blame executives and each other for the sector's battered reputation after Volkswagen admitted to cheating U.S. emissions tests almost two years ago.

UPDATE 1-Trump's NAFTA autos goals to collide with industry as talks start - Reuters News

{{20170814T173350.748+0000}}UPDATE 1-Trump's NAFTA autos goals to collide with industry as talks start(Adds Canada prepared to discuss strengthening of rules)

By David Lawder

WASHINGTON, Aug 14 (Reuters) - The Trump administration has set a collision course with the auto industry as it launches renegotiation of the 23-year-old NAFTA trade pact this week, aiming to shrink a growing trade deficit with Mexico and tighten the rules of origin for cars and parts.

More than any other industry, autos have been the focus of U.S. President Donald Trump's anger over the North American Free Trade Agreement, which he blames for taking car factories and jobs away from the United States to low-wage Mexico.

The U.S. trade deficit with Mexico in autos and auto parts reached $74 billion last year, the dominant component of an overall $64 billion U.S. deficit, according to Census Bureau data.

"The Trump administration has framed their NAFTA negotiating objectives around reducing the trade deficit with Mexico," said Caroline Freund, a senior trade fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. "If they don't touch autos, there's no way of getting at what they want."

Among tools that U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer may seek to boost U.S. auto employment is strengthening the rules of origin to shut out more parts from Asia, and possibly an unprecedented U.S.-specific content requirement for Mexican vehicles.

Lighthizer's negotiating objectives for NAFTA seek to "ensure the rules of origin incentivize the sourcing of goods and materials from the United States and North America," which has raised concerns among auto industry executives and trade groups that he will seek a deal that guarantees a certain percentage of production for the United States.

The industry is opposed to such a carve-out or to increasing the percentage of a vehicle's value that must come from the region above the current 62.5 percent - already the highest of any global trade bloc.

It says this would raise costs and disrupt a complex supply chain in which parts crisscross NAFTA borders, making North American car production competitive with Asia and Europe.

"Our members feel very strongly that rules of origin are not the tools to use to reshore jobs into the U.S.," said Ann Wilson, senior vice president of government affairs for the Motor and Equipment Manufacturers Association, a trade group representing auto parts makers.

Wilson and other industry advocates say a better way to boost U.S. manufacturing jobs is through policies aimed at expanding vehicle exports.

The issue is also sensitive in Canada, another major NAFTA auto producing center. Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland on Monday said she was prepared to discuss "some strengthening of the rules of origin" but made no commitments.

"We are also extremely mindful of the possibility that any changes... could have unintended consequences," she told reporters in Ottawa.[nL2N1L000M]

PARTS THRESHOLD

If U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross gets his way, it would be harder to reach the 62.5 percent content threshold because the "tracing list" of parts that count toward that goal would be modernized. He argues that current rules are too loose and allow a tariff-free "back door" for Chinese auto parts.

Parts that did not exist when the 300-plus-page list was devised in the early 1990s - largely electronics sourced from Asia such as console touch screens or hybrid-drive controllers - do not count against reaching the threshold. If they are put on the list, companies would have to source them from North America or pay tariffs.

If the content requirements become too onerous, automakers will simply skip compliance "and they'll just end up paying the duty," said Charles Uthus, vice president for international policy at the American Automotive Policy Council, a lobbying group for Ford Motor Co. , General Motors and Fiat Chrysler .

Foregoing all NAFTA tariff-free access benefits - which could happen if Trump is dissatisfied with the negotiations and decides to scrap the trade pact - would raise costs by about $4 billion-$5 billion a year, Ulthus added. Ford plans about $7 billion in total capital spending this year.

DISPUTE MECHANISM DISPUTED

Among the other contentious NAFTA issues that U.S., Canadian and Mexican negotiators will tackle starting on Wednesday in Washington is the future of a mechanism for resolving trade disputes.

The United States wants to eliminate a so-called "Chapter 19" provision, arguing that it fails to combat unfair subsidies of some Mexican and Canadian goods. Mexico and Canada have vowed to keep the provision.

U.S. negotiators will also seek a provision to deter currency manipulation, aiming to set a precedent for future trade negotiations, such as a revised U.S.-North Korean deal or a bilateral pact with Japan.

The negotiations face a tight timeline, with officials saying they want to finish by early next year to avoid ratification difficulties posed by elections in Mexico in July 2018 and in the United States in November 2018.

Freund said the negotiators should focus on a few key areas, given that a comprehensive update of NAFTA would take a lot more than six months.

"Ultimately I think they're going to get bogged down in all these details and pick two to three things and have a smaller agenda," she said.

RPT-Canadians shift to smaller, more frequent, auto loans repayments  - Reuters News

{{20170814T110007.536+0000}}RPT-Canadians shift to smaller, more frequent, auto loans repayments (Repeats story that ran on Friday with no change to headline or text)

By Allison Lampert

MONTREAL, Aug 11 (Reuters) - Canadians are making smaller payments more frequently on auto term loans as new financing offers lure buyers away from the typical monthly billing cycle, a trend public advocacy groups say could push consumers to purchase more expensive vehicles that they simply cannot afford.

"Because long-term car loans tend to involve lower monthly or bi-weekly payments, extended terms can encourage consumers to buy more car than they may be able to afford," said Kathryn Dunn, a spokeswoman for the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada

This new financing trend has made it easier for consumers to pile on debt, further extending already over-leveraged households.

According to Statistics Canada, households have amassed huge debt, with the ratio of debt to disposable income at a near record of 166.9 percent during the first quarter of 2017.

The increase comes at a time when the Bank of Canada is likely to raise interest rates again this year, after the first interest rate hike in seven years in July. [nL1N1K508A]

More than half of Canadians who borrow to buy new vehicles look to make payments every two weeks, with the arrival of their paychecks, said Robert Karwel, a senior manager for J.D. Power in Canada.

Some borrowers are opting to pay even more frequently with four percent making payments each week during the first half of 2017, up from 3.4 percent in 2015, the J.D. Power data show. "These terms don't allow you to pay off the car any faster, so it's questionable why it is being taken-up by customers," Karwel said. "We feel it has to do with the amount of stress the family budget is under."

Consumer appetite for weekly payments has been fueled by advertisements which tout smaller amounts that are paid in more frequent installments, said George Iny, director of the Automobile Protection Association, a Canadian consumer advocacy group. Iny said he believes the proportion of borrowers opting for weekly payments would be even higher than the data suggests, but some financial institutions accustomed to monthly and bi-weekly installments, have not yet produced the paperwork needed for such frequent payments. "Psychologically, the amount sounds lower. It allows you to buy without feeling guilty," he said.

Still, delinquency rates on Canada's C$120 billion ($94.7 billion) in auto loans remained low at 1.7 percent during the first quarter of 2017, relatively flat from the same period a year ago, according to June data from credit information company TransUnion.

ANALYSIS-China a sweet spot for U.S. companies' earnings in 2nd quarter - Reuters News

{{20170814T105453.101+0000}}ANALYSIS-China a sweet spot for U.S. companies' earnings in 2nd quarter(Updating with comment from U.S. officials on posible trade action by Trump administration)

By Adam Jourdan

SHANGHAI, Aug 14 (Reuters) - Trade tensions between Washington and Beijing may be running high but Corporate America is finding China to be a reliable source of profit growth this year.

Whether they sell construction equipment, semiconductors or coffee, many major U.S. companies have reported stronger second-quarter earnings and revenue from their Chinese operations in recent weeks.

They are benefiting from a Chinese economy that is growing at almost 7 percent, several times the rate of U.S. expansion, a Chinese housing boom, and a slide in the U.S. dollar, which makes American exports more competitive and increases dollar earnings once they are translated from foreign currencies.

Chinese President Xi Jinping's ambitious plan to build a new Silk Road that will improve links between China and dozens of countries in Asia and Europe, and includes many billions of dollars of new roads, bridges, railways and power plants – is also helping American firms to sell heavy equipment and other products.

Caterpillar Inc , a bellwether for industrial demand in China and beyond, reported its sales in Asia-Pacific rose 25 percent in the second quarter - thanks to China. Shipments of large excavators to Chinese customers more than doubled in the first half of the year.

"We now expect demand in China to remain strong through the rest of the year," Brad Halverson, Caterpillar's group president and chief financial officer, told investors.

Caterpillar's Japanese rivals Komatsu <6301.T> and Hitachi Construction Machinery Co <6305.T> reported similar strength in demand for heavy machinery. Komatsu's China sales almost doubled in the firm's April-June quarter. [nL3N1KJ2EP]

"China's grown pretty well relative to the U.S. over this period and the currency's relationship has changed in favor of the U.S. companies," said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at the Leuthold Group in Minneapolis.

DISCRIMINATION CLAIMS

Chinese companies are also benefiting from the robust domestic economy. For example, Chinese auto manufacturer Geely Automobile Holdings <0175.HK> announcing last week that its July sales climbed 89 percent from the year-earlier-month. Geely and many other major Chinese companies report their results in the next few weeks.

American companies in China have been collectively reporting better prospects even as they complain that the Chinese authorities are not allowing them enough access to parts of the Chinese market and discriminating against them as they seek to compete against Chinese rivals.

U.S. President Donald Trump's administration has been considering punitive tariffs against a range of Chinese goods but it has held off on taking action after Beijing backed tougher United Nations Security Council sanctions against North Korea earlier this month.

However, senior U.S. officials said over the weekend that Trump on Monday will order his top trade adviser to determine whether to investigate Chinese trade practices that force U.S. firms operating in China to turn over intellectual property. The move could eventually lead to steep tariffs on Chinese goods.

And despite some negatives in the Sino-U.S. relationship, a July report by the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai showed that 82 percent of U.S. companies in China expect revenues to increase this year, up from 76 percent a year ago.

"In general China is still a growth market for lots of US goods and services... the Chinese consumer is driving more and more the growth in China itself - that's a very positive shift in compositional growth for a lot of U.S. companies that do provide goods and services for consumers, as opposed to building skyscrapers," said Joe Quinlan, head of thematic investing at Bank of America, U.S. Trust.

In the chip industry, Skywork Solutions , which gets around two thirds of its revenue from China, said last month that China remained a strong growth story for the company.

And many other foreign companies are also doing well. The European liquor industry is benefiting from a resurgence in Chinese consumer demand.

Remy Cointreau, which battled a steep slowdown in China after Xi launched an anti-corruption drive in 2012 – hitting a lot of lavish wing and dining by businesses - said it saw a "clear improvement in consumption trends" this year.

"We see the fast-growing upper middle class driving strong consumption growth for our upmarket cognac brands," the company's Chief Financial Officer Luca Marotta said last month.

Closer to home, Kweichow Moutai <600519.SS>, the Chinese maker of the liquor baijiu and the world's largest alcohol firm by value, saw first half profits gain 27.8 percent.

Chinese stock market gains this year have in turn helped confidence among retail investors.

"I feel the wider economy is improving," said Ding Mingwei, 26, a manager at an education technology company in Shanghai.

Ding, who says his own investments are up this year, now plans to spend more on hotels, dining out and funding hobbies such as playing the guitar.

For some companies, China growth helped to offset problems elsewhere. Starbucks U.S. growth cooled in the third quarter but same-store sales for the coffee chain in China surged 7 percent.

Among the Japanese companies to benefit, Sony's <6758.T> sales in China were up just under 50 percent in the three months to June, making it the electronic group's fastest-growing geographic segment.

COMPETITION INTENSIFIES

There are some sectors that are proving a tougher slog for foreign companies.

Major international automakers, even those reporting increased revenues, have pointed to squeezed margins in one of the world's most competitive markets. U.S. automaker General Motors , for example, saw a strong April-June quarter, but said it faced "pricing challenges".

And some economists warn that it is unclear how long the Chinese economy and the markets can keep their buzz.

"The strong rebound is largely being driven by the property market and export growth, which both seem unsustainable," said Nomura Chief China Economist Yang Zhao in Hong Kong. He said he expects China's economic growth to cool by the fourth quarter.

* Ford Sollers, a Russia-based 50-50 joint venture of U.S. Ford Motors Co with Russian carmaker Sollers, will increase production at its car factory in Russia's north-west Leningrad region, Vedomosti daily reports, citing an unnamed representative of Ford Sollers and a person familiar with the company's plans.

* Production at the company's factory in the town of Vsevolozhsk, where Ford Sollers assembles Ford's Focus and Mondeo models, is set to increase by 25-30 percent this year, according to the company's new plan.

* The company decided to increase production mainly because of stronger sales on the Russian market. In the first seven months of this year, Ford Focus sales increased by 25 percent to 7,700 vehicles.

* Plans for higher output don't mean that Ford Sollers would hire more people, Vedomosti says.

ANALYSIS-China a sweet spot for U.S. companies' earnings in 2nd quarter - Reuters News

{{20170813T230001.975+0000}}ANALYSIS-China a sweet spot for U.S. companies' earnings in 2nd quarterBy Adam Jourdan

SHANGHAI, Aug 14 (Reuters) - Trade tensions between Washington and Beijing may be running high but Corporate America is finding China to be a reliable source of profit growth this year.

Whether they sell construction equipment, semiconductors or coffee, many major U.S. companies have reported stronger second-quarter earnings and revenue from their Chinese operations in recent weeks.

They are benefiting from a Chinese economy that is growing at almost 7 percent, several times the rate of U.S. expansion, a Chinese housing boom, and a slide in the U.S. dollar, which makes American exports more competitive and increases dollar earnings once they are translated from foreign currencies.

Chinese President Xi Jinping's ambitious plan to build a new Silk Road that will improve links between China and dozens of countries in Asia and Europe, and includes many billions of dollars of new roads, bridges, railways and power plants – is also helping American firms to sell heavy equipment and other products.

Caterpillar Inc , a bellwether for industrial demand in China and beyond, reported its sales in Asia-Pacific rose 25 percent in the second quarter - thanks to China. Shipments of large excavators to Chinese customers more than doubled in the first half of the year.

"We now expect demand in China to remain strong through the rest of the year," Brad Halverson, Caterpillar's group president and chief financial officer, told investors.

Caterpillar's Japanese rivals Komatsu <6301.T> and Hitachi Construction Machinery Co <6305.T> reported similar strength in demand for heavy machinery. Komatsu's China sales almost doubled in the firm's April-June quarter. [nL3N1KJ2EP]

"China's grown pretty well relative to the U.S. over this period and the currency's relationship has changed in favor of the U.S. companies," said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at the Leuthold Group in Minneapolis.

DISCRIMINATION CLAIMS

Chinese companies are also benefiting from the robust domestic economy. For example, Chinese auto manufacturer Geely Automobile Holdings <0175.HK> announcing last week that its July sales climbed 89 percent from the year-earlier-month. Geely and many other major Chinese companies report their results in the next few weeks.

American companies in China have been collectively reporting better prospects even as they complain that the Chinese authorities are not allowing them enough access to parts of the Chinese market and discriminating against them as they seek to compete against Chinese rivals.

The Trump administration has been considering punitive tariffs against a range of Chinese goods but it has held off on taking action after Beijing backed tougher United Nations Security Council sanctions against North Korea earlier this month.

And despite some negatives in the Sino-U.S. relationship, a July report by the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai showed that 82 percent of U.S. companies in China expect revenues to increase this year, up from 76 percent a year ago.

"In general China is still a growth market for lots of US goods and services... the Chinese consumer is driving more and more the growth in China itself - that's a very positive shift in compositional growth for a lot of U.S. companies that do provide goods and services for consumers, as opposed to building skyscrapers," said Joe Quinlan, head of thematic investing at Bank of America, U.S. Trust.

In the chip industry, Skywork Solutions , which gets around two thirds of its revenue from China, said last month that China remained a strong growth story for the company.

And many other foreign companies are also doing well. The European liquor industry is benefiting from a resurgence in Chinese consumer demand.

Remy Cointreau, which battled a steep slowdown in China after Xi launched an anti-corruption drive in 2012 – hitting a lot of lavish wing and dining by businesses - said it saw a "clear improvement in consumption trends" this year.

"We see the fast-growing upper middle class driving strong consumption growth for our upmarket cognac brands," the company's Chief Financial Officer Luca Marotta said last month.

Closer to home, Kweichow Moutai <600519.SS>, the Chinese maker of the liquor baijiu and the world's largest alcohol firm by value, saw first half profits gain 27.8 percent.

Chinese stock market gains this year have in turn helped confidence among retail investors.

"I feel the wider economy is improving," said Ding Mingwei, 26, a manager at an education technology company in Shanghai.

Ding, who says his own investments are up this year, now plans to spend more on hotels, dining out and funding hobbies such as playing the guitar.

For some companies, China growth helped to offset problems elsewhere. Starbucks U.S. growth cooled in the third quarter but same-store sales for the coffee chain in China surged 7 percent.

Among the Japanese companies to benefit, Sony's <6758.T> sales in China were up just under 50 percent in the three months to June, making it the electronic group's fastest-growing geographic segment.

COMPETITION INTENSIFIES

There are some sectors that are proving a tougher slog for foreign companies.

Major international automakers, even those reporting increased revenues, have pointed to squeezed margins in one of the world's most competitive markets. U.S. automaker General Motors , for example, saw a strong April-June quarter, but said it faced "pricing challenges".

And some economists warn that it is unclear how long the Chinese economy and the markets can keep their buzz.

"The strong rebound is largely being driven by the property market and export growth, which both seem unsustainable," said Nomura Chief China Economist Yang Zhao in Hong Kong. He said he expects China's economic growth to cool by the fourth quarter.

Canadians shift to smaller, more frequent, auto loans repayments  - Reuters News

{{20170811T232243.775+0000}}Canadians shift to smaller, more frequent, auto loans repayments By Allison Lampert

MONTREAL, Aug 11 (Reuters) - Canadians are making smaller payments more frequently on auto term loans as new financing offers lure buyers away from the typical monthly billing cycle, a trend public advocacy groups say could push consumers to purchase more expensive vehicles that they simply cannot afford.

"Because long-term car loans tend to involve lower monthly or bi-weekly payments, extended terms can encourage consumers to buy more car than they may be able to afford," said Kathryn Dunn, a spokeswoman for the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada

This new financing trend has made it easier for consumers to pile on debt, further extending already over-leveraged households.

According to Statistics Canada, households have amassed huge debt, with the ratio of debt to disposable income at a near record of 166.9 percent during the first quarter of 2017.

The increase comes at a time when the Bank of Canada is likely to raise interest rates again this year, after the first interest rate hike in seven years in July. [nL1N1K508A]

More than half of Canadians who borrow to buy new vehicles look to make payments every two weeks, with the arrival of their paychecks, said Robert Karwel, a senior manager for J.D. Power in Canada.

Some borrowers are opting to pay even more frequently with four percent making payments each week during the first half of 2017, up from 3.4 percent in 2015, the J.D. Power data show. "These terms don't allow you to pay off the car any faster, so it's questionable why it is being taken-up by customers," Karwel said. "We feel it has to do with the amount of stress the family budget is under."

Consumer appetite for weekly payments has been fueled by advertisements which tout smaller amounts that are paid in more frequent installments, said George Iny, director of the Automobile Protection Association, a Canadian consumer advocacy group. Iny said he believes the proportion of borrowers opting for weekly payments would be even higher than the data suggests, but some financial institutions accustomed to monthly and bi-weekly installments, have not yet produced the paperwork needed for such frequent payments. "Psychologically, the amount sounds lower. It allows you to buy without feeling guilty," he said.

Still, delinquency rates on Canada's C$120 billion ($94.7 billion) in auto loans remained low at 1.7 percent during the first quarter of 2017, relatively flat from the same period a year ago, according to June data from credit information company TransUnion.

UPDATE 2-Germany believes European Commission will propose electric car quotas - Reuters News

{{20170811T160810.254+0000}}UPDATE 2-Germany believes European Commission will propose electric car quotas(Adds detail and reaction from Merkel's conservatives)

BERLIN, Aug 11 (Reuters) - Germany believes the European Commission will propose quotas for electric cars in its next review of measures to cut emissions, a spokesman for the German environment ministry said on Friday.

The Commission said on Monday it had no plans to introduce quotas for electric cars for an automobile sector seeking to recover from the Volkswagen diesel scandal.

A spokeswoman for the German environment ministry, which is run by the Social Democrats (SPD) - the junior partner in Chancellor Angela Merkel's ruling coalition - said without quotas for electric cars the European Union could miss its carbon dioxide emissions targets.

The SPD, Merkel's main rival in September's election, wants a European-wide quota to accelerate the shift towards electric cars, the SPD's general secretary said on Friday.

"There must be ambitious targets, otherwise we won't make any headway," Hubertus Heil told Reuters.

He added that he was not, however, in favour of setting a specific date to take diesel motors out of service.

The SPD, which is lagging far behind Merkel's conservatives in opinion polls, is in favour of tax incentives to accelerate the switch to electric cars.

A plan laid out by SPD leader Martin Schulz said an obligatory minimum number of electric cars for Germany and Europe would give car markers incentives to develop new technologies. He did not suggest specific numbers.

Merkel has repeatedly warned against "demonising" diesel engines [nL5N1KH3YE].

The Stuttgarter Zeitung newspaper cited several members of Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU) as criticising the SPD's suggestions of a quota.

"Set quotas remind me of a planned economy and that has never been successful," Norbert Barthle, deputy transport minister and CDU member, was quoted as saying.

Britain said last month it would ban the sale of new petrol and diesel cars from 2040 in an attempt to reduce air pollution. The global auto industry debate could one day herald the end of more than a century of reliance on the combustion engine. [nL9N1GF06X]

UPDATE 1-Ford says it is cooperating in German diesel investigation - Reuters News

{{20170810T154457.638+0000}}UPDATE 1-Ford says it is cooperating in German diesel investigation(Recasts, adds Ford comment)

BERLIN, Aug 10 (Reuters) - Ford said German motor authorities were investigating a diesel-engined model of its mid-sized Mondeo car, adding that none of its cars was equipped with illegal emissions cheating software.

Ford Germany said in an emailed statement on Thursday that all its vehicles and engines, including those with its latest diesel engines, complied with current emissions guidelines and did not contain illegal software devices.

The carmaker said it had been contacted by Germany's KBA vehicle certification authority about its Mondeo 2.0 TCDi model and had pledged to cooperate with the German authority.

Germany's WirtschaftsWoche magazine was first to report that the U.S. carmaker's Mondeo model was being inspected by the KBA at the behest of the transport ministry for the possible use of cheating devices. [nL5N1KW5FN]

Germany's transport ministry was not immediately available for comment.

WirtschaftsWoche said the inspections were prompted by emissions test data that could indicate the use of such devices.

An unnamed institute has been commissioned to carry out the tests which are already underway, the weekly publication said.

WirtschaftsWoche cited Ford Germany chief Gunnar Herrmann as denying any wrongdoing. "No illegal shut-off devices were used in our diesel exhaust after-treatment systems," he told the magazine, adding that Ford had "neither cheated, nor used tricks".

The car industry has been under scrutiny since U.S. regulators exposed emissions test cheating by Volkswagen nearly two years ago. This led to wider revelations that diesel vehicles from most manufacturers release far more toxic nitrogen oxides (NOx) on the road than in tests.

Ford and Germany's three main carmakers - VW, Daimler and BMW - this week announced incentives to drivers who trade in older diesel models for new, cleaner models. [nL5N1KO3X9]

FACTBOX-Germany, carmakers agree steps to cut diesel pollution - Reuters News

{{20170810T143448.397+0000}}FACTBOX-Germany, carmakers agree steps to cut diesel pollution(Updates with details on Opel in paragraph 8)

Aug 10 (Reuters) - German ministers, regional politicians and car executives have agreed a package of measures aimed at cutting inner-city air pollution and averting bans on diesel cars. [nL5N1KO14A]

Following are some of the key points of the agreement:

SCRAPPAGE INCENTIVES

As a way to take older, polluting cars off the road, carmakers have agreed to offer trade-in deals for older diesel cars if customers then switch to newer, cleaner models.

Ford announced it will pay owners of vehicles with Euro-1, Euro-2 or Euro-3 emission-standard engines a bonus of between 2,000 and 8,000 euros ($2,348 to $9,394) if they trade in their old cars by end of 2017.

BMW said it would pay up to 2,000 euros.

Mercedes-Benz said it would offer customers in Europe up to 2,000 euros for trading in older diesels equipped with engines built to meet the Euro-1 to Euro-4 emissions standards in exchange for a newer Mercedes. A trade-in discount of 1,000 euros will be offered to customers buying an electric Smart car.

Volkswagen said it would offer trade-in discounts of between 2,000 and 10,000 euros for its own-brand cars, depending on the vehicle. For older diesel versions of the VW Golf, a 5,000 euro incentive is being offered.

VW's premium devision Audi said it would offer between 3,000 and 10,000 euros to trade in cars with Euro-4 engines for newer cars, while sister brand Porsche said it would offer up to 5,000 euros.

VW's Seat brand will offer trade-in discounts of between 1,750 euros and 8,000 euros depending on the model.

Opel said it would offer customers between 1,750 and 7,000 euros for trade-ins of cars with Euro-1 to Euro-4 engines, for a newer Opel.

ENGINE SOFTWARE

German carmakers have committed to updating engine management software to make emissions filtering systems operate more effectively. Carmakers had previously made liberal use of a "thermal window" loophole which allowed carmakers to throttle back exhaust emissions management systems in cold weather conditions.

The move will affect 5.3 million cars at a cost of around 500 million euros, with the measures to be funded solely by industry. That includes 2.5 million VW cars that have already been recalled for software updates. The government said the software changes would cut the nitrogen oxide emissions of the affected cars by 30 percent by the end of 2018.

However, environmental group DUH and a Stuttgart regional court have dismissed software updates as being inadequate solutions for tackling pollution. DUH has called the agreement "a grandiose failure", and said it would reduce nitrogen oxide missions by only 2 to 3 percent overall, since it affected less than 20 percent of Germany's 15 million diesel cars. The group said it would continue lawsuits in 16 cities.

Environment minister Barbara Hendricks, from the centre-left SPD, said voluntary software updates can only be a first step, with a more thorough technical update of cars needed to avoid bans in the longer run. [nL5N1KJ2XB]

HARDWARE UPGRADES

The government will continue discussions with carmakers on the possible need for more fundamental retrofits - including the addition of extra exhaust-cleaning systems. Such measures are much more expensive than software updates - with the potential costs estimated by analysts as high as 10 billion euros.

TOUGHER TESTING

Germany's KBA vehicle certification authority, which has faced criticism it is not sufficiently independent, will tighten controls of emissions, introducing spot tests of vehicles that have already been approved. The measures were announced when the transport ministry published a report on VW last month.

The agreement does not include a proposal to divide control of certification and emissions testing on the streets, which had been sought by the environment minister.

DIESEL FUND

The auto sector and the government will each contribute half to a 500 million euro fund aimed at helping local governments reduce pollution, including introducing systems to improve traffic flows and improve public transport. [nFWN1KI106]

SUBSIDIES

Support for electric buses increased to 100 million euros a year, plus extra backing for hybrid and natural gas buses. Financial incentives to help municipalities and taxi operators fund a switch to electric vehicles are being put in place.

Goal for next legislative period is to create a nationwide network of 50,000 charging points for electric vehicles as well as changes planned to property law to make it easier to install charging points in private buildings.

Support will be provided for trains powered by hydrogen and fuel cells as well as more cash for cycle paths. ($1 = 0.8516 euros)

Germany unsure if carmakers can claim tax relief over diesel clean-up - Reuters News

{{20170809T114027.853+0000}}Germany unsure if carmakers can claim tax relief over diesel clean-upBERLIN, Aug 9 (Reuters) - Germany needs more details on how carmakers plan to finance incentives for owners who ditch old diesels for cleaner cars before it can decide whether the companies can claim tax relief, a finance ministry spokesman said on Wednesday.

Volkswagen , BMW , Daimler and Ford have offered incentives to switch to cleaner cars.

"How these incentives are going to shape up is unclear," the spokesman said when asked if companies will be able to claim tax writeoffs. "So I can't give a tax assessment of how this will impact the tax burden of the companies."

RPT-Takata seeks to suspend air bag victims' lawsuits against carmakers - Reuters News

{{20170809T050001.433+0000}}RPT-Takata seeks to suspend air bag victims' lawsuits against carmakersBy Tom Hals and David Shepardson

WILMINGTON, Del./WASHINGTON, Aug 8 (Reuters) - Takata Corp's <7312.T> bankrupt U.S. business will ask a federal judge on Wednesday to suspend lawsuits against automakers that have been brought by people injured by its faulty air bag inflators, something that opponents say is an abuse of the law.

Takata and TK Holdings Inc, the company's U.S. unit, filed for bankruptcy in June and said they faced tens of billions of dollars in liabilities from its inflators, which are subject to the biggest recall in automotive history. [nL3N1JN07F]

Bankruptcy automatically stayed hundreds of lawsuits against TK Holdings for wrongful death, injuries, economic loss and breach of consumer protection laws. But in July the company sought a preliminary injunction to suspend lawsuits against automakers that use its inflators. [nL1N1K80VV]

Without the injunction, Takata said the litigation would distract management from completing the sale of the company's viable operations to Key Safety Systems for $1.6 billion and could threaten the supply of air bag inflators to replace recalled ones.

Plaintiffs' lawyers called the requested injunction "an abuse of the bankruptcy laws for the benefit of all of the world's largest automobile manufacturers." They said Takata's request would delay consideration of plaintiff's lawsuits for six months or more, which would be a very long time for the plaintiffs.

The official bankruptcy committee that represents injured drivers said in court papers the injunction would have "human consequences" and prevent people from pursuing compensation.

The committee cited the example of a 23-year-old New Jersey woman whose quadriplegia resulted from brain injuries that a government investigator said were caused by a faulty Takata air bag.

The woman's lawyers estimated her economic loss would be $18 million, which does not include potential damages for pain and suffering.

At least 18 deaths and 180 injuries worldwide have been linked to Takata air bags. Takata has said it expected 125 million vehicles worldwide to be recalled by 2019. [nL1N1KI22B]

Takata set aside $125 million to compensate those injured by its air bags as part of a guilty plea, but plaintiffs' lawyers argue it will not be enough.

Major automakers including BMW AG , Ford Motor Co , Honda Motor Co Ltd <7267.T> and Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T> sided with Takata in backing a six-month delay in lawsuits, arguing in a court filing that doing so would "advance the interests of their customers and the safety of the motoring public by increasing the likelihood" the Takata restructuring will succeed and "protect the supply of replacement inflators and diminish the risk of future deaths and injuries."

UPDATE 1-VW offers trade-ins up to 10,000 euros in diesel clean-up - Reuters News

{{20170808T161309.019+0000}}UPDATE 1-VW offers trade-ins up to 10,000 euros in diesel clean-up* VW brand, Audi, Porsche offering rebates

* VW brand, Audi also offer premiums for new-energy cars

* Rebates valid through end of year

(Adds executive comment, detail and background)

BERLIN, Aug 8 (Reuters) - Volkswagen is offering buyers trading in an older diesel car up to 10,000 euros ($11,810) off the price of a cleaner model, joining other automakers on Tuesday in a push to cut pollution.

Carmakers pledged such incentives last week in a deal with German officials to overhaul software in more than 5 million diesel cars to try to avert a ban on diesel fuelled vehicles after the emissions cheating scandal. [nL5N1KO14A]

Rebates announced on Tuesday across the VW group range from 2,000 to 10,000 euros at the core VW brand, 3,000 euros to 10,000 euros at its luxury division Audi and 5,000 euros at sportscar maker Porsche.

BMW , Daimler and Ford have also offered incentives to switch to newer, cleaner cars.

The VW incentives are valid to the end of the year and its customers can gain additional discounts of 1,000 to 2,380 euros for buying alternative energy cars including electric, hybrid and natural gas-powered vehicles, VW said.

VW's emissions test cheating - exposed by U.S. regulators almost two years ago - led to wider revelations that diesel vehicles from most manufacturers release far more toxic nitrogen oxides (NOx) on the road than in laboratory tests.

With possible driving bans looming in several major German cities and federal elections due next month, carmakers will be hard pressed to clean up diesel models, of which VW says there are 6.4 million on Germany's roads, to meet new Euro-4 and older European Union emissions standards.

"We cannot count on the state to help us in this phase," VW sales chief Juergen Stackmann said on a call. ($1 = 0.8467 euros)

FACTBOX-Germany, carmakers agree steps to cut diesel pollution - Reuters News

{{20170808T153025.209+0000}}FACTBOX-Germany, carmakers agree steps to cut diesel pollutionAug 8 (Reuters) - German ministers, regional politicians and car executives have agreed a package of measures aimed at cutting inner-city air pollution and averting bans on diesel cars. [nL5N1KO14A]

Following are some of the key points of the agreement:

SCRAPPAGE INCENTIVES

As a way to take older, polluting cars off the road, carmakers have agreed to offer trade-in deals for older diesel cars if customers then switch to newer, cleaner models.

Ford announced it will pay owners of vehicles with Euro-1, Euro-2 or Euro-3 emission-standard engines a bonus of between 2,000 and 8,000 euros ($2,348 to $9,394) if they trade in their old cars by end of 2017.

BMW said it would pay up to 2,000 euros.

Mercedes-Benz said it would offer customers in Europe up to 2,000 euros for trading in older diesels equipped with engines built to meet the Euro-1 to Euro-4 emissions standards in exchange for a newer Mercedes. A trade-in discount of 1,000 euros will be offered to customers buying an electric Smart car.

Volkswagen said it would offer trade-in discounts of between 2,000 and 10,000 euros for its own-brand cars, depending on the vehicle. For older diesel versions of the VW Golf, a 5,000 euro incentive is being offered.

VW's premium devision Audi said it would offer between 3,000 and 10,000 euros to trade in cars with Euro-4 engines for newer cars, while sister brand Porsche said it would offer up to 5,000 euros.

VW's Seat brand will offer trade-in discounts of between 1,750 euros and 8,000 euros depending on the model.

ENGINE SOFTWARE

German carmakers have committed to updating engine management software to make emissions filtering systems operate more effectively. Carmakers had previously made liberal use of a "thermal window" loophole which allowed carmakers to throttle back exhaust emissions management systems in cold weather conditions.

The move will affect 5.3 million cars at a cost of around 500 million euros, with the measures to be funded solely by industry. That includes 2.5 million VW cars that have already been recalled for software updates. The government said the software changes would cut the nitrogen oxide emissions of the affected cars by 30 percent by the end of 2018.

However, environmental group DUH and a Stuttgart regional court have dismissed software updates as being inadequate solutions for tackling pollution. DUH has called the agreement "a grandiose failure", and said it would reduce nitrogen oxide missions by only 2 to 3 percent overall, since it affected less than 20 percent of Germany's 15 million diesel cars. The group said it would continue lawsuits in 16 cities.

Environment minister Barbara Hendricks, from the centre-left SPD, said voluntary software updates can only be a first step, with a more thorough technical update of cars needed to avoid bans in the longer run. [nL5N1KJ2XB]

HARDWARE UPGRADES

The government will continue discussions with carmakers on the possible need for more fundamental retrofits - including the addition of extra exhaust-cleaning systems. Such measures are much more expensive than software updates - with the potential costs estimated by analysts as high as 10 billion euros.

TOUGHER TESTING

Germany's KBA vehicle certification authority, which has faced criticism it is not sufficiently independent, will tighten controls of emissions, introducing spot tests of vehicles that have already been approved. The measures were announced when the transport ministry published a report on VW last month.

The agreement does not include a proposal to divide control of certification and emissions testing on the streets, which had been sought by the environment minister.

DIESEL FUND

The auto sector and the government will each contribute half to a 500 million euro fund aimed at helping local governments reduce pollution, including introducing systems to improve traffic flows and improve public transport. [nFWN1KI106]

SUBSIDIES

Support for electric buses increased to 100 million euros a year, plus extra backing for hybrid and natural gas buses. Financial incentives to help municipalities and taxi operators fund a switch to electric vehicles are being put in place.

Goal for next legislative period is to create a nationwide network of 50,000 charging points for electric vehicles as well as changes planned to property law to make it easier to install charging points in private buildings.

Support will be provided for trains powered by hydrogen and fuel cells as well as more cash for cycle paths. ($1 = 0.8516 euros)

ANALYSIS-Autonomous cars race narrows on doubts about clear path to profit - Reuters News

{{20170808T093022.247+0000}}ANALYSIS-Autonomous cars race narrows on doubts about clear path to profit* Carmakers look to spread investment burden, risk

* Alliances with suppliers represent strategy shift

* Technology companies also looking to strike deals

* Graphic-Key players and alliances: http://tmsnrt.rs/2nYv7gc

By Edward Taylor and Paul Lienert

FRANKFURT/DETROIT, Aug 8 (Reuters) - BMW and Daimler , the world's top luxury carmakers, have announced alliances with suppliers, talking up the virtues of having a bigger pool of engineers to develop a self-driving car.

But another motive behind these deals, executives and industry experts told Reuters, is a concern that robocars may not live up to the profit expectations that drove an initial investment rush.

Carmakers are increasingly looking to forego outright ownership of future autonomous driving systems in favour of spreading the investment burden and risk.

The trend represents a clear shift in strategy from little more than a year ago when most automakers were pursuing standalone strategies focussed on tackling the engineering challenge of developing a self-driving car, rather than on the business case.

"Although it is a substantial market, it may not be worth the scale of investments currently being sunk into it," said a board member at one of the German carmakers, who declined to be identified because the matter is confidential.

Dozens of companies - including carmakers and tech firms like Google and Uber - are vying for a market which, according to consulting firm Frost & Sullivan, will only make up about 10 to 15 percent of vehicles in Europe by 2030. There are sure to be losers.

"It's impossible for me to believe there will be 50 successful autonomous vehicle software producers," said John Hoffecker, global vice chairman of Michigan-based consulting firm AlixPartners.

In July last year, BMW became the first major carmaker to abandon its solo development of self-driving cars in favour of teaming up with chipmaker Intel and camera and software manufacturer Mobileye to build a platform for autonomous cars technology by 2021.

The decision followed a trip by senior executives to visit startups and suppliers to gauge BMW's competitive position.

"Sitting at other companies, one rattles off the technological challenges and safety aspects, and you come to realise that many of us are swimming in the same sludge," Klaus Buettner, BMW's vice president autonomous driving projects, told Reuters.

"Everybody is investing billions. Our view was that it makes sense to club together to develop some core systems as a platform."

Daimler's Mercedes-Benz has since combined efforts with supplier Bosch [ROBG.UL], three months ago, while Japanese carmaker Honda <7267.T> has said it is open to alliances in the area of autonomous cars. [nL2N1II0L1][nL5N1HC1RX]

Even deep-pocketed tech companies are teaming up. San Francisco-based transport app operator Lyft and Alphabet Inc's self-driving car unit Waymo pooled their resources in May. [nL2N1IH02T]

SHARE THE BURDEN

Partial autonomy is already a reality in higher-end cars that keep in lane and adjust their speed in motorway driving. Each of the next stages - "eyes off", "mind off" and ultimately driverless autonomy - will likely take years to become reality.

Klaus Froehlich, BMW's board member responsible for development, said the company was likely to lose money with its first fully autonomous vehicles, just like it did with its first-generation electric cars. But developing the technology remains a necessity in order to stay relevant as a carmaker.

"It is an enabling technology, not a business case," he said about BMW's decision to develop autonomous vehicles. "But if the burden can be shared on a platform, I have nothing against that."

One of the most financially promising markets that autonomous technology will open up is driverless on-demand taxis, which may one day come to replace regular cabs and parts of public transport in large cities.

"Robotaxis" are expected to drive the wider market for car sharing and ride-hailing, which was worth $53 billion last year and could be worth $2 trillion by 2030, according to a McKinsey study published earlier this year.

Ford and General Motors are investing at least $2 billion each to develop self-driving vehicles for urban ride-sharing fleets beginning in 2021, competing with incumbents and start-ups.

The emergence of alliances involving the likes of BMW and Mercedes-Benz comes at a time when regulators are pushing for a creation of standards for the new technology, which has the potential to improve vehicle reflexes and cut accidents by up to 90 percent, according to Boston Consulting Group.

Industry experts say such standardisation could make it much harder to develop a product which stands out, calling into question the wisdom of high-stakes, go-it-alone strategies.

ALLIANCES, MERGERS

In September 2016, the U.S. Department of Transport and the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration released guidance for heavily automated vehicles.

The regulator urged carmakers to disclose how vehicle reflexes are programmed, particularly when cars are faced with a dilemma, such as choosing between hitting a cyclist or accelerating beyond legal speeds to avoid an accident.

"It is important to consider whether highly automated vehicles are required to apply particular decision rules in instances of conflicts between safety, mobility, and legality objectives," the guidance said.

"Algorithms for resolving these conflict situations should be developed transparently using input from federal and state regulators, drivers and passengers."

European regulators too are debating whether to standardise speeds and distances which autonomous cars need to adhere to while weaving in and out of traffic or joining lanes.

Pressure not to waste development costs is laying the groundwork for alliances and even mergers between the various companies supplying technology for autonomous cars, including makers of vehicles, software, computer chips, radar, camera and laser sensors and high-definition maps.

BMW, Mercedes and Audi put aside their rivalry and teamed up to buy mapping firm HERE, for example, in order to cut their dependence on Google.

What starts out as arms-length agreements designed to capture market share, much like code-sharing deals between airlines, may evolve further into takeovers once the next investment round is due, executives and advisers said.

"Will we see what is happening in aviation be adopted in automotive - where first we see alliances, collaborations and consortiums, and then we see full out market combinations?" asked Bill Curtin, head of mergers and acquisitions at global law firm Hogan Lovells.

UPDATE 8-Tesla seeks $1.5 bln junk bond issue to fund Model 3 production - Reuters News

{{20170807T221502.139+0000}}UPDATE 8-Tesla seeks $1.5 bln junk bond issue to fund Model 3 production(Adds comment from bond expert)

By Nick Carey and Paul Lienert

DETROIT, Aug 7 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc said on Monday it would raise about $1.5 billion through its first-ever offering of junk bonds as the U.S. luxury electric car maker seeks fresh sources of cash to ramp up production of its new Model 3 sedan.

The move to issue junk bonds - lower-quality investments that offer higher yields - represents a bet by Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk that bond investors will be as hungry as stock investors to back the company on expectations that its Model 3 will be a hit.

Tesla shares are up 67 percent this year, pushing the company's market value to about $60 billion, above that of top U.S. automakers General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co , even though Tesla has yet to make an annual profit.

"Bond investors, who typically don't love companies that don't make money, will be far more forgiving when it comes to Tesla," said bond expert Robbie Goffin, managing director of FTI Consulting, citing the company's stellar stock market value.

Tesla was to start pitching potential investors on Monday, IFR reported, citing lead bankers on the deal. [nL1N1KT0B2]

So far, Tesla has been raising money to pay its bills with a combination of equity offerings and convertible bonds, which eventually convert into shares. In March, the company raised $1.4 billion through a convertible debt offering.

Following the announcement, Standard & Poor's reaffirmed its negative outlook for the automaker and assigned a "B-" rating for the bond issue - deep into junk credit territory. S&P also maintained its "B-" long-term corporate credit rating on Tesla.

"We could lower our ratings on Tesla if execution issues related to the Model 3 launch later this year or the ongoing expansion of its Models S and X production lead to significant cost overruns," S&P said in a statement on the bonds.

Moody's assigned a junk "B3" rating to the bond issue and said the company's rating outlook was stable.

The rating agency said the overall company's "B2" rating was supported by the fact that if Tesla ends up in serious financial trouble, its brand name, products and physical assets would be of "considerable value" to other automakers.

The automaker's debt load increased significantly last year when it bought solar panel maker SolarCity.

CFRA equity analyst Efraim Levy said the bonds provide Tesla with funds "at least into mid-2018."

"There is a risk they could still run out of money," he said. "Then you'd go back to the equity markets and hope it's not too late" to raise more money.

BURNING CASH

The latest effective yield on single-B rated bonds maturing in seven to eight years, the class for a Tesla issue, is around 5.5 percent, according to Bank of America/Merrill Lynch Fixed Income Index data.

Tesla's bond will price later this week after several days of meetings with credit investors, who will weigh factors including the absence of a borrowing history, its lack of profit and its high cash-burn rate against its growth potential and its attractiveness as an environmentally friendly "green" issuer.

Ultimately, the depth of investor interest will determine the bond's interest rate.

Tesla is counting on the Model 3, its least pricey car, to become a profitable, high-volume manufacturer of electric cars. [nL4N1KP58G]

Tesla said last week that it had 455,000 net pre-orders for the Model 3, which has a $35,000 base price, and that the sedan was averaging 1,800 reservations per day since it launched late last month.

At the launch, Musk, however, warned that Tesla would face months of "manufacturing hell" as it increases production of the sedan.

Tesla had over $3 billion in cash on hand at the end of the June quarter, compared with $4 billion on March 31.

The company has said it expects capital expenditures of $2 billion in the second half of this year to boost production at its Fremont, California assembly plant and a battery plant in Reno, Nevada.

Tesla's cash burn has prompted short-sellers like Greenlight Capital's David Einhorn to bet against the Palo Alto, California company.

Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Barclays, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank and RBC are the book-runners on the bond offering, IFR reported.

Shares of Tesla closed down 0.5 percent at $355.17 on Monday.

UPDATE 1-Mexico auto exports rise in July, but pace of growth slows - Reuters News

{{20170807T192152.344+0000}}UPDATE 1-Mexico auto exports rise in July, but pace of growth slows(Recasts; adds details on sales, exports, comments)

MEXICO CITY, Aug 7 (Reuters) - Mexico's auto production and shipments rose again in July but at a slower pace as car sales in the United States, the top export market for those vehicles, fell for a fifth straight month, the Mexican Auto Industry Association (AMIA) said on Monday.

Mexico exported 243,056 cars in July, 7.8 percent more than the same month last year, said AMIA. That compares to a 12 percent year-on-year increase in June and a 13.9 percent jump in May.

Production in July was up 0.7 percent to 286,417 units, versus 4.9 growth in June and 17.3 percent in May.

"It seems to me that today we are facing a situation where our main markets are contracting ... So it's difficult to maintain the levels (of exports and production) we saw at the beginning of the year when we weren't seeing these types of drops," said AMIA President Eduardo Solis.

The annualized pace of U.S. car and light truck sales in July fell to 16.73 million vehicles, down from 17.8 million vehicles a year earlier, according to Autodata Corp, which tracks industry sales.

The Mexican government is bracing for renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with the United States and Canada, as U.S. President Donald Trump has insisted that a new pact must be fairer to his country's workers and companies.

Mexico's booming auto sector has benefited from NAFTA as major manufacturers have made the country a top export hub, attracted by cheap labor and free trade pacts with more than 40 nations.

CORRECTED-UPDATE 6-Tesla seeks $1.5 bln junk bonds issue to fund Model 3 production - Reuters News

{{20170807T184417.464+0000}}CORRECTED-UPDATE 6-Tesla seeks $1.5 bln junk bonds issue to fund Model 3 production(Corrects company affiliation of Efraim Levy to CFRA from S&P Capital in paragraph 13)

By Nick Carey

DETROIT, Aug 7 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc said on Monday it would raise about $1.5 billion through its first-ever high-yield junk bond offering, as the U.S. luxury electric car maker seeks fresh sources of cash to ramp up production of its new Model 3 sedan.

The debt offering marks Tesla's debut in the junk-bond market and the company will start road-shows on Monday, IFR reported, citing lead bankers on the deal. [nL1N1KT0B2]

Tesla has been riding high on investor expectations that its Model 3 will be a mass-market hit, with shareholders pushing its market value above that of General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co , the top two U.S. automakers that produce millions of cars each annually.

But Tesla has yet to make an annual profit and its stock is a favorite among short-sellers, who continue to bet Tesla will fall short of its shareholders' high hopes.

So far, Tesla has been raising money to pay its bills with a combination of equity offerings and convertible bonds, which eventually convert into shares. In March, the company raised $1.4 billion through a convertible debt offering.

Following the announcement, Standard & Poor's reaffirmed its negative outlook for the automaker and assigned a "B-" rating for the bond issue - deep into junk credit territory. S&P also maintained its "B-" long-term corporate credit rating on Tesla.

"We could lower our ratings on Tesla if execution issues related to the Model 3 launch later this year or the ongoing expansion of its Models S and X production lead to significant cost overruns," S&P said in a statement on the bonds.

Moody's assigned a junk "B3" rating to the bond issue and said the company's rating outlook was stable.

The rating agency said the overall company's "B2" rating was supported by the fact that if Tesla ends up in serious financial trouble, its brand name, products and physical assets would be of "considerable value" to other automakers.

"The major challenge facing the company during the next twelve months will largely be the considerable execution risks associated with the rapid ramp-up in production of a totally new vehicle," Mood's senior vice president Bruce Clark said in a statement.

The automaker's debt load increased significantly last year when it bought solar panel maker SolarCity.

CFRA equity analyst Efraim Levy said the bonds provide Tesla with funds "at least into mid-2018."

"There is a risk they could still run out of money," he said. "Then you'd go back to the equity markets and hope it's not too late" to raise more money.

BURNING CASH

The latest effective yield on single-B rated bonds maturing in seven to eight years, the class for a Tesla issue, is around 5.5 percent, according to Bank of America/Merrill Lynch Fixed Income Index data.

Tesla's bond will price later this week after several days of meetings with credit investors, who will weigh factors including the absence of a borrowing history, its lack of profit and its high cash-burn rate against its growth potential and its attractiveness as an environmentally-friendly "green" issuer.

Ultimately, the depth of investor interest will determine the bond's interest rate.

Elon Musk-led Tesla is counting on the Model 3, its least pricey car, to become a profitable, mass market manufacturer of electric cars. [nL4N1KP58G]

Tesla said last week that it had 455,000 net pre-orders for the Model 3, which has a $35,000 base price, and that the sedan was averaging 1,800 reservations per day since it launched late last month.

At the launch, Musk, however, warned that Tesla would face months of "manufacturing hell" as it increases production of the sedan.

Tesla had over $3 billion in cash on hand at the end of the June quarter, compared with $4 billion as of the previous quarter and $3.25 billion a year earlier.

The company has said it expects capital expenditures of $2 billion in the second half of this year to boost production at its Fremont, California assembly plant and a battery plant in Reno, Nevada.

Tesla's cash burn has prompted short-sellers like Greenlight Capital's David Einhorn to bet against the Palo Alto, California company.

Musk said last week the company was considering debt to expand cash on hand.

Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Barclays, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank and RBC are the book-runners on the bond offering, IFR reported.

Shares of Tesla, which have risen 67 percent this year, were down 9 cents at $356.82.

EU says no plans for electric cars quotas - Reuters News

{{20170807T102954.598+0000}}EU says no plans for electric cars quotasBRUSSELS, Aug 7 (Reuters) - The European Union on Monday said it had no plans to introduce quotas for electric cars for an automobile sector seeking to recover from the Volkswagen diesel scandal, a spokeswoman for the EU executive said.

"Generally speaking, the Commision is looking into ways to promote use of low carbon energy and transport, but none of them includes quotas for electric cars," the spokeswoman told reporters.

"We do not discriminate between different technologies."

The Commission was reacting to a report in German newspaper Handelsblatt that cited EU sources as saying the European Commission wanted to accelerate the retreat from combustion engines by setting a quota for low emission cars such as electric cars from 2025.

FACTBOX-U.S. states woo automakers with $17 bln in subsidies since 1976 - Reuters News

{{20170805T130848.114+0000}}FACTBOX-U.S. states woo automakers with $17 bln in subsidies since 1976Aug 4 (Reuters) - Over the past 40 years U.S. states have
been vying for new auto plants, with 17 states granting $17
billion in tax breaks, job training funds, infrastructure
development and other incentives to woo investment from domestic
and foreign automakers.

Here is a list of the subsidies, provided by Good Jobs
First, a Washington-based research group.

** Pennsylvania gave German automaker Volkswagen 
$100 million in incentives in 1976 to locate its first U.S.
factory in Westmoreland County.

** Michigan, home to General Motors Co , Ford Motor Co
 and the U.S. unit of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles ,
has granted $7.8 billion since 1984 to the so-called Detroit
Three, as well as to Mazda Motor Corp <7261.T>, when it was
still allied with Ford.

** Far and away the largest subsidy was the $2.3 billion in
state and local incentives given to GM in 2009 for its Orion
Township plant north of Detroit, which builds the Chevrolet Bolt
EV and the Sonic.

** Nevada has provided $1.6 billion in incentives since 2014
to two relatively young automakers: $1.3 billion to Tesla Inc
 for its battery factory outside Reno and $335 million
to would-be manufacturer Faraday Future for a since-canceled
plant north of Las Vegas.

** Mississippi and Tennessee have provided $1.6 billion and
$1.3 billion, respectively, in subsidies to Toyota Motor Corp
<7203.T>, Nissan Motor Co <7201.T> and VW.

** Nissan has solicited $1.8 billion in subsidies from both
Mississippi and Tennessee. Toyota has pulled $836 million from
Mississippi, Texas and Kentucky, while Honda Motor Co <7267.T>
won $389 million from Alabama and Indiana.

** Korean automaker Hyundai Motor Co <005380.KS>, which
controls Kia Motors Corp <000270.KS>, has received $645 million
in total from Alabama and Georgia.

** German automaker Mercedes-Benz, a unit of Daimler AG
<000270.KS>, received $457 million from Alabama and BMW
 $254 million from South Carolina.

UPDATE 1-UK car sales fall for fourth month in a row in July - Reuters News

{{20170804T090341.000+0000}}UPDATE 1-UK car sales fall for fourth month in a row in July(Adds more detail, quotes and context)

LONDON, Aug 4 (Reuters) - British new car registrations fell for a fourth consecutive month in July, the longest run of declines since 2011, in the latest sign of how uncertainty about Brexit is hitting Britain's economy, a car lobby group said on Friday.

Demand fell across business, fleet and private sales with total registrations down by 9.3 percent compared with July last year, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said.

In the first seven months of the year as a whole, private sales were down 5 percent, with business registrations down 0.2 percent and fleet sales up slightly at 0.1 percent, leaving total registrations down 2.2 percent.

"The fall in consumer and business confidence is having a knock-on effect on demand in the new car market and government must act quickly to provide concrete plans regarding Brexit," said SMMT Chief Executive Mike Hawes.

Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said on Thursday uncertainty around Britain's split with the European Union was weighing on the economy.

Samuel Tombs, an economist with Pantheon Macroeconomics, warned that "the downturn has further to run".

The hit to consumer sentiment from June's national election - in which Prime Minister Theresa May lost her parliamentary majority - could push registrations down further as sales tend to lag six months behind consumer confidence, he said.

Registrations for alternatively fuelled vehicles, however, soared 64.9 percent, the SMMT said.

The government said on July 26 that sales of petrol and diesel cars would be banned from 2040.

Munich mayor says diesel deal might not avert car ban - Reuters News

{{20170803T131634.951+0000}}Munich mayor says diesel deal might not avert car banBERLIN, Aug 3 (Reuters) - The mayor of Munich, home to carmaker BMW, expressed doubts on Thursday about whether a deal between German politicians and auto makers to cut pollution was enough to avert possible bans of diesel vehicles.

On Wednesday, politicians and top carmakers agreed at a crisis summit to overhaul engine software on 5.3 million diesel cars to try to repair the industry's battered reputation and avert potential bans in several cities. [nL5N1KO14A]

"I fear that the promised software updates for newer cars and financial support for the owners of old cars will not be enough to protect the health of people in the cities," Munich mayor Dieter Reiter said of the deal.

In June, Reiter said Munich would consider banning some diesel vehicles amid "shocking" nitrogen oxide emissions in the Bavarian capital, a move which helped fuel concern about the future of diesel engines in Germany. [nL8N1JB2J8]

Fritz Kuhn, the mayor of the city of Stuttgart which is also considering a ban, said he was disappointed about Wednesday's deal: "That can only be a first step, more must still come."

Environmentalists said the plan - almost two years after Volkswagen admitted to cheating U.S. diesel emissions tests - was too little, too late. They vowed to press ahead with legal action to push for bans.

However, Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt said he was hopeful that driving bans could be avoided, noting that carmakers had agreed to fund incentives to persuade consumers to trade in older diesel cars, in addition to software updates.

Evercore analysts said the deal had bought carmakers more time and cities would want to test whether it really reduced pollution before proceeding with unpopular bans.

"It will certainly take years to receive reliable data in order to make that call," they said.

Reiter said Munich would examine the effectiveness of the measures agreed on Wednesday with its own air pollution tests.

U.S. planned layoffs fall; hiring picks up in July -Challenger - Reuters News

{{20170803T113000.795+0000}}U.S. planned layoffs fall; hiring picks up in July -ChallengerBy Kimberly Chin

NEW YORK, Aug 3 (Reuters) - The number of planned layoffs at U.S. companies dropped in July to its lowest since November while job-opening announcements notched up, a sign that businesses are confident that the economy will continue to expand, a report released Thursday showed.

U.S. companies announced 28,307 planned job cuts in July, a 9 percent decline from 31,105 in June and the lowest since November, according to outplacement consultancy Challenger, Gray & Christmas Inc.

Overall, July's job cuts were down 37.6 percent from 45,346 a year earlier.

Meanwhile, employers made plans to hire 88,000 workers, the highest July total on record and the third-highest total of the year, according to the report.

"Maybe some of these hiring announcements are just some of the exuberance that comes late in an expansion," Challenger, Gray & Christmas Chief Executive Officer John Challenger said in an interview. "But it may also be that some of the decision makers who decide whether to build a new plant or launch a new product or hire new people are becoming more comfortable that the recession is not imminent."

Despite low unemployment, there is slack in the system, leaving ample opportunity for employers to pick up skilled workers, Challenger said.

The so-called U6 unemployment rate, which measures the share of discouraged, part-time or underemployed workers in the economy, is at 8.6 percent, higher than the unemployment rate of 4.3 percent.

Amazon.com Inc and Foxconn, the Taiwanese electronics supplier formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd <2317.TW> led July's surge in hiring-plan announcements.

Amazon announced intentions to hire 50,000 workers at its recruitment fair, while Foxconn said it would build a factory in Wisconsin and add 3,000 jobs in the next three years.

Although the retail sector has been the hardest-hit this year, there are signs it is crawling back.

Through the first seven months of this year, retailers have said they would add 245,616 new positions, 44 percent of all new jobs announced in 2017.

The Australian Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries' VFACTS report out on Thursday showed 92,754 new vehicles were sold in July, up 1.6 percent on the same month last year. Both months had the same number of selling days.

That was the highest total for a July month on record. Sales for the year to date were running at 692,306, up 0.4 percent on the same period of 2016.

Sales of sports utilities alone jumped 9.4 percent in July, with the small and medium segment in demand. Sales of light commercial vehicles edged up 0.8 percent after a run of very strong months, while the heavy vehicle market gained 14.5 percent.

Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T> retained first place on the sales ladder with 19.3 percent of the market, while Mazda Motor Corp <7261.T> had another upbeat month taking 10.3 percent.

Hyundai Motor <005380.KS> took third spot with 8.1 percent. The Holden unit of General Motors followed with 7.0 percent, ahead of Ford at 6.8 percent.

UPDATE 6-German carmakers in emissions deal to try to avert diesel bans - Reuters News

{{20170802T185708.156+0000}}UPDATE 6-German carmakers in emissions deal to try to avert diesel bans* Ministers, car bosses agree diesel pact to cut pollution

* Engine software to be updated on 5.3 mln cars in Germany

* Environmentalists seeking bans on diesel cars

(Adds Justice minister comments)

By Emma Thomasson and Andreas Cremer

BERLIN, Aug 2 (Reuters) - German politicians and car bosses agreed on Wednesday to overhaul engine software on 5.3 million diesel cars to cut pollution and try to repair the industry's battered reputation.

However, environmentalists said the plan - almost two years after Volkswagen admitted to cheating U.S. diesel emissions tests - was too little, too late, and vowed to press ahead with legal action aimed at banning polluting vehicles.

Chancellor Angela Merkel's government has come under mounting pressure for not doing enough to crack down on vehicle pollution and for being too close to powerful carmakers.

The issue has become a central campaign topic ahead of next month's national election, prompting the government to summon car bosses to try to avert moves in some cities to force bans on diesel vehicles. [nL5N1KJ2XB]

Justice Minister Heiko Maas said the agreement was only a first step, warning that bans on diesel vehicles could not be ruled out and urging car makers to focus more on consumers.

"The legal requirements for clean air remain in effect," he told Thursday editions of Germany's daily newspaper Bild.

Ministers have been wary of angering the owners of 15 million diesel vehicles and damaging an industry that is the country's biggest exporter and provides about 800,000 jobs.

Politicians stopped short of demanding costly mechanical modifications to engine and exhaust systems and said they had agreed for now on software updates for 5.3 million cars.

"We expect a new culture of responsibility from carmakers," Environment Minister Barbara Hendricks, from the centre-left Social Democrats, told a news conference, also adding the software updates were just a first step in cutting emissions.

"There is much to make good - to the environment, to people in cities, car owners and not least to the security of the car industry in Germany and its hundreds of thousands of jobs."

Hendricks criticised the VDA automakers lobby for putting out a statement proclaiming a deal two hours before ministers spoke to the media. She added the VDA's comment that the deal was "unique in Europe and the world" lacked humility.

The stakes have increased for German carmakers in recent weeks. Britain and France have announced plans to eventually ban all diesel and petrol vehicles and Tesla has launched its first mass-market electric car. [nL3N1KK05W] [nL5N1KH21I]

Meanwhile, top German manufacturers BMW , Daimler , Audi , Porsche and VW are being investigated by European regulators for alleged anti-competitive collusion.

LOST TRUST

The DUH environmental group said the initiative had failed as software updates would only result in a cut of about 2-3 percent of emissions of toxic nitrogen oxides (NOx), adding it would pursue court cases for diesel bans in 16 cities.

"Today's summit is bad news for hundred of thousands of people who will get sick and 10,600 who will die prematurely due to NOx each year," DUH head Juergen Resch said in a statement.

The VDA said the software updates should cut NOx emissions by 25-30 percent for those cars affected, reducing pollution at least as much as possible driving bans.

"The car industry knows it has lost a lot of trust. We must and will work on winning back that trust," VDA president Matthias Wissmann said.

Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt said a refusal by foreign carmakers to participate in the plan was "completely unacceptable".

Carmakers also agreed to fund incentives aimed at encouraging consumers to trade in older diesel cars that cannot be helped with software updates.

The VDA said the software updates would cost VW, Daimler and BMW together at least 500 million euros ($593 million), while scrapping incentives would be much more expensive.

Evercore analyst Arndt Ellinghorst said the costs were manageable for the industry, but cautioned: "What the agreement doesn't do is restore consumer confidence in diesel engines."

German car sales data on Wednesday showed diesel car sales fell 12.7 percent in July. Now diesel makes up only 40.5 percent of new car sales in Europe's largest car market, down from 46 percent at the end last year. [nL5N1KO2VF]

An opinion poll published on Wednesday by Die Welt newspaper showed 73 percent of Germans want politicians to take a tougher line with the car industry on air pollution.

VW's emissions test cheating - which was exposed by U.S. regulators - led to a string of revelations that showed diesel vehicles from most manufacturers release far more NOx gases on the road than in laboratory tests used to assess their safety.

But cutting back on NOx pollution is causing another headache for carmakers, which were betting on diesel technology to help cut carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions to meet climate change rules. Diesel engines are up to 20 percent more fuel efficient than petrol equivalents.

Falling sales of diesel cars have led to an increase in CO2 emissions, Germany's KBA motor authority said on Wednesday. Average emissions per vehicle rose 0.4 percent in July to 128.4 grams of carbon dioxide per kilometre, it said. [nL5N1KO2VF]

Auto workers' union rolls the dice at Nissan's Mississippi plant - Reuters News

{{20170802T174218.433+0000}}Auto workers' union rolls the dice at Nissan's Mississippi plantBy Nick Carey

CANTON, Miss., Aug 2 (Reuters) - For nearly a decade, the United Auto Workers union has tried to organize workers at Nissan Motor Co Ltd's <7201.T> assembly plant here, challenging the company's wages, safety record and commitment to treating African-American workers fairly.

Starting Thursday, the roughly 4,000 workers at one of Mississippi's largest industrial employers will cast their votes, affecting not only their own futures but the union's as well.

Another failure to organize a southern auto factory would leave the UAW weakened ahead of contract negotiations with the Detroit Three automakers in 2019, when many analysts forecast U.S. auto sales will be in a cyclical slump.

The organizing vote, which the UAW called for last month, has divided workers at the Canton plant, which builds Nissan Murano sport utility vehicles, commercial vans and Titan and Frontier pickup trucks.

Pro-union workers said the plant has a record of poor safety and complain that the company moved to a 401(k) defined contribution plan from a traditional plan.

"This is not about wages, I'm concerned about safety issues at the plant and about my pension," says Patricia Ruffian, 51. "They say if we vote for the union we're going to have nothing, we have to start from scratch, and that's not true."

The UAW also claims Nissan has illegally threatened workers that if they vote for the union, the plant will close. Based on those claims, the U.S. National Labor Relations Board has issued a number of complaints that Nissan has made that threat a number of times in recent years. The automaker denies the allegations. The outcome of the election could be contested, leading to a test of how the Trump-era NLRB will handle contentious labor issues.

Rodney Francis, director of Human Resources at Nissan's Canton plant, said, "Labor rights are about the right to organize, or not to organize. All we've been doing is providing employees with the facts so they can make an informed decision and at the end of the day this is about what they choose."

Nissan has strong supporters on the factory floor, who point to the history of problems at Detroit's unionized automakers and reject the UAW's arguments that black workers are not treated fairly.

"Black people are doing much better here since Nissan came," said Tony Jacobson, 52, who is black. He has worked at the plant since it opened in 2003 and makes $28 per hour - comparable to the top rate for unionized workers at General Motors Co or Ford Motor Co . "I'm trying to save our livelihoods, I don't want Canton to be like Detroit."

The UAW, like other large industrial unions, has struggled to expand membership as manufacturers have moved jobs overseas or to states like Mississippi that allow workers to shun union membership even in union shops.

The union has organized smaller auto suppliers in the U.S. south, but has failed for decades to organize all the workers at a major southern auto-assembly plant. Politicians in the region have used low unionization as a selling point to attract more manufacturing investment.

"If the union wins, it will encourage other in the South to unionize," Vanderbilt University labor analyst Daniel Cornfield said. "If the company wins, it will make it more difficult for the UAW to organize elsewhere in the South."

'CHANGED THE LANDSCAPE'

Scott Waller, president of the Mississippi Economic Council (MEC), the state's chamber of commerce, says Nissan has "changed the landscape" in Mississippi. Nissan was the first automaker to locate a major assembly plant in the state, but since Mississippi won the contest for the factory in 2000, it has secured significant investments by other automotive giants like Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T> and Continental AG .

The number of auto workers in the state rose to 18,000 in 2016, from 11,000 in 2010. Government statistics show the average Mississippi auto worker earned $50,510 in 2016, 34 percent above the state average.

A vote for union representation at Nissan's Canton plant "could affect that plant's ability to compete and Mississippi's ability to compete in the realm of economic development," Waller said.

Workers at Nissan's Canton plant earn less in total hourly wages and benefits than workers at unionized auto plants in the United States. See graphic http://tmsnrt.rs/2hnDyTr

The union has connected the pay issue to its argument that Nissan is undermining progress on civil rights.

"There's a huge race issue there, there's an issue of civil rights and the history of Mississippi plays into that narrative," UAW Secretary-Treasurer Gary Casteel said in an interview.

Dolphus Weary, co-chair of community organization Move Mississippi Forward and a long-term black campaigner for racial unity, said he doesn't see it that way. He recounts visiting a manufacturing plant in the 1960s where the only black workers were janitors.

When he visited Nissan's Canton plant, Weary says "my antenna were up looking for the same situation" but instead he found a plant where 46 percent of the managers were black.

"This is the new Mississippi," Weary says of the plant. "I don't think old arguments from 50 years ago will help move us forward."

But Reverend Isiac Jackson, pastor of the Liberty Missionary Baptist Church in Canton, said management at Nissan's plant has worked to prevent employees from voting on union representation, which is reminiscent of the time when Mississippi's leaders tried to prevent black citizens from voting.

"Now just let everybody vote," he said. "And if they vote against a union then everybody will go about their business."

German ministers, carmakers meet under pressure to tackle pollution - Reuters News

{{20170801T230001.946+0000}}German ministers, carmakers meet under pressure to tackle pollutionBERLIN, Aug 2 (Reuters) - German ministers and car executives will meet on Wednesday to try to find ways to cut diesel emissions and stave off moves by some cities to ban polluting vehicles.

Since Volkswagen admitted to cheating U.S. diesel emissions tests in September 2015, the German government has come under fire for not doing enough to crack down on vehicle pollution and for being too close to the country's powerful auto industry.

With national elections less than eight weeks away, and environmental groups making progress in the courts, the government is keen to show it is taking action.

But ministers are also wary of damaging an industry that is a major source of export income and provides about 800,000 jobs.

Industry and government sources said on Tuesday that carmakers would probably be spared making costly hardware changes to engines and would instead be required to carry out software updates to around 2 million vehicles. [nL5N1KN4C2]

Whether that will be enough to revive diesel vehicle sales or stop bans - like one planned for Stuttgart that was confirmed by a regional court last week - is another matter. [nL5N1KJ2XB]

"Software updates are better than nothing, but I have doubts this deal will persuade people to start buying diesels again," said Stefan Bratzel, head of the Center of Automotive Management think-tank near Cologne.

Volkswagen's (VW) emissions crisis led to a string of revelations that showed diesel vehicles from most manufacturers release far more toxic nitrogen oxides (NOx) on the road than in laboratory tests used to assess their safety.

That has hit sales of diesel vehicles in Germany, with buyers worried about potential driving restrictions, causing a big headache for carmakers that were betting on diesel technology to meet rules on lowering carbon dioxide emissions.

There are around 15 million diesel cars on Germany's roads, which contribute around 40 percent to NOx pollution in major cities, according to the DUH environmental lobby.

The stakes have increased in recent weeks. Britain and France have turned up the pressure on Berlin by announcing plans to eventually ban all diesel and petrol vehicles, while top German carmakers BMW , Daimler , Audi , Porsche and VW are being investigated by European regulators for alleged anti-competitive collusion.

"The car industry is wrapped up in a prolonged crisis of confidence," Bratzel said. "It's high time for automakers to make a contribution to get out of this mess."

UPDATE 2-Canada's July auto sales up 4.9 pct as sales decline in U.S. - Reuters News

{{20170801T225717.257+0000}}UPDATE 2-Canada's July auto sales up 4.9 pct as sales decline in U.S.(Adds industry figures, comment from president of Global Automakers of Canada)

By Nivedita Bhattacharjee and Nikhil Subba

Aug 1 (Reuters) - Canadian auto sales rose 4.9 percent in July as the industry benefited from strong economic growth, even as U.S. sales fell for a fifth consecutive month, according to data released on Tuesday.

Global Automakers of Canada President David Adams said he expects the growth to continue, which should enable Canada to post record full-year auto sales in 2017.

"The Canadian market is trended upwards," he said. "Part of it has been due to Canada's brightening economic fortunes."

Auto sales typically track macro indicators such as employment and economic growth. Canada's economy grew by 0.6 percent in May from a month earlier, Statistics Canada said last month, exceeding economists' forecasts for 0.2 percent growth.[nL1N1KJ0C7]

July's sales of 181,834 vehicles pushed the year-to-date total to 1.22 million, a gain of 5 percent from a year earlier, according to DesRosiers automotive report.

U.S. auto sales declined in July as sales of large pickups fell 4 percent and large sport utility vehicles tumbled 20 percent. [nL1N1KN0IC]

In Canada, light truck sales rose 8.3 percent to 123,603 during July. That helped offset a 1.7 percent decline in passenger car sales, which fell to 58,231, according to DesRosiers.

Light truck sales often rise when the economy is growing as they are used to transport industrial and manufactured goods.

General Motors Co said Canadian sales rose 22 percent to 25,852 vehicles. It has sold 131,000 units in the year to date in Canada, up 16 percent over the same period last year.

Ford Motor Co said it sold 27,669 vehicles in Canada in July, down 7.1 percent from a year earlier.

Fiat Chrysler Automobiles , maker of Dodge and Chrysler vehicles, posted a 3 percent drop in Canadian sales. They had declined 7 percent in June. [nL1N1JV0S8]

Automakers, regulators urge work on U.S. fuel rules review - Reuters News

TRAVERSE CITY, Mich., Aug 1 (Reuters) - A U.S. Environmental Protection Agency official and major auto industry lobbyists urged the government and automakers on Tuesday to consider innovative ideas to head off conflict over 2025 model-year fuel efficiency standards for U.S. automakers.

Christopher Grundler, director of the EPA's Office of Transportation and Air Quality, told an automotive conference that regulators should consider allowing automakers to get regulatory credits for vehicles that can operate in a more fuel-efficient mode or for selling electric vehicles to high-mileage ride-sharing fleets.

"Having this conversation about both the nearer term and longer term at the same time makes a lot of business and technical sense," Grundler said, adding that knowing where the emissions rules are going through 2030 could provide stability to automakers.

Grundler had a leading role in crafting the Obama administration rule requiring automakers to roughly double new- vehicle fuel efficiency - and cut greenhouse gas emissions - in stages between 2012 and 2025.

In March, President Donald Trump ordered a review of U.S. vehicle fuel-efficiency standards from 2022 to 2025 put in place under former President Barack Obama, saying they were too tough on the auto industry. The review must be finalized by April 2018.

In 2011, officials said the rules would save motorists $1.7 trillion in fuel costs over the life of the vehicles but cost the auto industry about $200 billion over 13 years.

The U.S. Transportation Department said last week it may revise fuel-efficiency requirements starting with the 2021 model year, a year earlier than previously disclosed, and was studying the impact of freezing standards through 2025. The White House has held meetings with automakers to discuss the 2025 review. [nL1N1KG0JS]

Under current rules, fleetwide average fuel economy is expected to be around 41 miles per gallon in 2021, compared with an average of nearly 50 miles per gallon in 2025.

California opposes weakening the rules and threatened to pursue tougher standards unilaterally. Other states have also pledged court fights. Automakers want a national standard that will allow them to plan investments in new vehicles and technology.

Mitch Bainwol, chief executive of the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a trade group representing General Motors Co , Volkswagen AG and others, said the only issue was how much requirements should rise.

"We all want to get to a compromise deal," Bainwol said. "We're not talking about a monumental shift in regulatory policy or outcomes."

Annette Hebert, a senior official with the California Air Resource Board, said her agency did not plan to relax its 2025 standards. California wants to hold talks with automakers on standards that reach beyond 2025.

"We need to have a sense of urgency about this," said John Bozzella, president of Global Automakers, a trade group representing foreign automakers including Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T> and Hyundai Motor Co <005380.KS> at the forum.

UPDATE 5-U.S. auto sales fall in July as carmakers slash rental fleet sales - Reuters News

{{20170801T194511.033+0000}}UPDATE 5-U.S. auto sales fall in July as carmakers slash rental fleet sales(Adds annualized sales pace for July; background on rental car fleet sales)

By Joseph White and Paul Lienert

DETROIT, Aug 1 (Reuters) - U.S. carmakers said on Tuesday they continued to slash low-margin sales to daily rental fleets in July as the overall pace of U.S. car and light truck sales fell for the fifth straight month.

The annualized pace of U.S. car and light truck sales in July fell to 16.73 million vehicles, down from 17.8 million vehicles a year earlier, according to Autodata Corp, which tracks industry sales.

Investors sold shares in the Detroit Three automakers on Tuesday. General Motors Co fell about 3.5 percent and Ford Motor Co slid about 2.5 percent.

Several major automakers, including GM, Ford, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles , Nissan Motor Co <7201.T> and Hyundai Motor Co<005380.KS> said they sharply reduced rental car sales in July, and they portrayed the decisions as putting profit ahead of sales volume.

Automakers have used low-margin sales to rental fleets to avoid factory shutdowns. With more flexible labor agreements, the Detroit automakers have shifted course. They are quicker to idle factories to reduce supply, and they are demanding higher prices, industry officials said. Fiat Chrysler has killed several models it once sold to fleets.

Big U.S. rental car companies such as Hertz Global Holdings Inc and Avis Budget Car Rental [CARXXB.UL] at the same time are restructuring their fleets as values decline for rental cars they resell, and as ride services such as Uber Technologies [UBER.UL] bite into their business. [nL1N1JN1E4]

In a more troubling sign for Detroit, combined sales of large pickups fell 4 percent, and sales of large sport utility vehicles declined by 20 percent. Only the Ford F-series, up 6 percent, improved on year-ago results among major truck models.

Declining sales could leave the Detroit Three with too many plants in North America, Jeff Schuster, a forecaster with LMC Automotive, said on Tuesday at an industry conference in Traverse City, Mich. The decline in July's annual sales pace from a year ago equates to the output of four assembly plants.

GM gained little ground in its effort to reduce inventories of unsold vehicles. The automaker had 104 days of supply at the end of July, down from 105 days at the end of June. GM has promised investors to reduce inventories to 70 days by year-end. [nL1N1KG0CT]

Ford said July sales fell 7.5 percent, but inventory fell to 77 days from 79 the previous month. Fiat Chrysler said sales dropped 10 percent.

Among the top Japanese companies, only Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T> reported a year-to-year gain, with sales up 4 percent. Honda Motor Co <7267.T> sales fell 1 percent, and Nissan sales fell 3 percent.

GM, Ford and Fiat Chrysler have said second-half financial results likely will be lower than first-half results, in part reflecting production cuts in North America and pricing pressures. [nL1N1KH12N]

* Treasury to announce refunding schedule on Wednesday

* Friday's employment report in focus

By Karen Brettell

NEW YORK, Aug 1 (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury yields fell on
Tuesday as weak auto sales raised concerns about slow economic
growth, before Friday's highly anticipated employment report for
July.

U.S. carmakers said on Tuesday they continued to slash
low-margin sales to daily rental fleets in July as General
Motors Co , Ford Motor Co  and Fiat Chrysler
Automobiles ,  struggled to curb a slide in
retail sales during the month. [nL1N1KN0IC]

Yields had risen before the sales reports.

"Weak auto sales really took the air out of bond sellers,"
said Jim Vogel, an interest rate strategist at FTN Financial in
New York.

Benchmark 10-year notes  rose 10/32 in price to
yield 2.26 percent, down from 2.29 percent late on Monday.

Services and non-manufacturing data on Thursday will be
watched for further indications of the strength of the U.S.
economy, with the main economic focus on Friday's employment
report.

The market is in "a holding pattern into payrolls and
average hourly earnings on Friday," said Ian Lyngen, head of
U.S. interest rate strategy at BMO Capital Markets in New York.

Data on Tuesday showed that a measure of U.S. factory
activity fell from a near three-year high, setting the economy
on a moderate growth path in the third quarter.

A separate report showed that inflation remains low. The
personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, excluding
food and energy, rose 0.1 percent in June after a similar gain
in May. In the 12 months through June, the so-called core PCE
price index increased 1.5 percent after advancing by the same
margin in May. [nLNN1JEDHP]

The Treasury Department's quarterly refunding announcement
on Wednesday will be scrutinized for any indication of how the
government plans to make up for a reduction in Federal Reserve
bond purchases once the U.S. central bank begins paring them.

Investors will also be focused on whether the government
plans to introduce a new ultra-long bond, or revive a 20-year
issue.

Yields on Treasury bills due on Oct. 5 <912796LW7=> spiked
on Tuesday on concerns that U.S. lawmakers may not raise the
debt ceiling before the government runs out of funds.

The Congressional Budget Office has said U.S. lawmakers need
to raise the debt ceiling by mid-October to avoid defaulting on
debt payments.

The Washington Post reported that talks between the White
House and the Senate's top Republican and Democrat broke up on
Tuesday without a resolution to raising the debt limit.

CORRECTED-UPDATE 8-Kremlin orders Washington to slash embassy staff in Russia - Reuters News

{{20170801T155756.109+0000}}CORRECTED-UPDATE 8-Kremlin orders Washington to slash embassy staff in Russia(Corrects paragraph 17 to show ambassador said local staff need to have served 15 years to be eligible to apply for special visas)

* Putin ordered U.S. to cut diplomatic staff by 755

* Kremlin says local staff can be included in total

* Majority of embassy staff are Russian citizens

* Kremlin seeks to avoid alienating Trump: analyst

By Maria Tsvetkova and Jack Stubbs

MOSCOW, July 31 (Reuters) - The Kremlin has ordered the United States to cut about 60 percent of its diplomatic staff in Russia but many of those let go will be Russian citizens, softening the impact of a measure adopted in retaliation for new U.S. sanctions.

The ultimatum issued by Russian President Vladimir Putin is a display to voters at home that he is prepared to stand up to Washington, but is also carefully calibrated to avoid directly affecting the U.S. investment he needs, or burning his bridges with his U.S. opposite number Donald Trump.

Putin said on Sunday Russia had ordered the United States to cut 755 of its 1,200 embassy and consulate staff by September, and was seizing two diplomatic properties.

The cuts will affect embassy and consular operations, but allowing the United States to choose who leaves means a smaller impact than expelling U.S. diplomats from Russia.

The measures were announced after the U.S. Congress overwhelmingly approved new sanctions to respond to Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and to punish Russia further for its 2014 annexation of Crimea from Ukraine. [nL5N1KJ35N] The White House said on Friday that Trump would sign the sanctions bill.

Speaking to troops in Tallinn, Estonia, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence called Russia's actions "drastic" but said Washington would continue with its sanctions until Moscow stopped its "destabilizing activities in Ukraine and elsewhere."

Trump did not comment on the expulsions on Monday. "Right now, we're reviewing our options, and when we have something to say, we'll let you know," his spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told reporters.

Staff at the U.S. embassy in Moscow were on Monday summoned to an all-hands meeting where Ambassador John F. Tefft briefed employees on the Russian decision - the toughest diplomatic demarche between the two countries since the Cold War.

"The atmosphere was like a funeral," said one person present, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he is not authorised to talk to the media.

PUNISHING CONGRESS, NOT TRUMP

Forcing the United States to scale back its diplomatic presence will reinforce Putin's reputation at home as a resolute defender of Russia's interests. That will help burnish his image before next year's presidential election, when he is expected to seek another term.

Putin said on Sunday he saw no sign of better relations with the United States, and held out the possibility of more measures to come.

The consequences of the Russian retaliation are not so stark that it would permanently alienate Trump, according to Alexander Baunov, a senior fellow at the Moscow Carnegie Center, a think tank.

By announcing his counter-measures before Trump signed the sanctions legislation into law, "Putin is sending a message that he is punishing Congress's America, and not Trump's America," Baunov wrote in a Facebook post.

"(Putin) has taken Trump out of the direct line of fire and spared his ego."

Absent from the Russian retaliation were any measures that directly target U.S. investment in Russia. U.S. bluechip companies such as Ford, Citi and Boeing have projects in the country, bringing the kind of investment the Kremlin needs to lift a sluggish economic recovery.

TOWN HALL MEETING

Embassy employees in Moscow on Monday anxiously waited to hear if they would keep their jobs. Tefft described the Russian decision as unfair, but provided no details about the cuts, a person at the meeting told Reuters.

The ambassador said Russian staff who were let go and had served at least 15 years could apply for a special immigration visa to the United States.

"People asked what Russian staff should do now, since a lot of Russian people working for the embassy are blacklisted and cannot find a job in Russian companies," said the person present.

One area likely to be cut is the office that issues visas to Russian citizens seeking to travel to the United States, according to a former U.S. ambassador to Moscow, Michael McFaul.

"If these cuts are real, Russians should expect to wait weeks if not months to get visas to come to U.S.," McFaul wrote in a Twitter post on Sunday.

Moscow's response included a vow to seize a U.S. warehouse in southern Moscow and a country villa, or dacha, on the outskirts of the city used by embassy staff on the weekends.

On Monday, a Reuters journalist saw five vehicles with diplomatic license plates, including a cargo truck, arrive at the dacha. The convoy was refused access.

Russian state news agency RIA quoted an unnamed foreign ministry source as saying the Americans failed to obtain environmental permits for the trucks to enter a conservation area around the site. [nL5N1KM6LO]

UPDATE 1-Germany to agree plan to cut diesel emissions-sources - Reuters News

{{20170801T132736.757+0000}}UPDATE 1-Germany to agree plan to cut diesel emissions-sources(Adds details, background)

By Markus Wacket

BERLIN, Aug 1 (Reuters) - The German government will not force the car industry to make costly changes to engines to cut diesel emissions but will settle for software updates for around 2 million vehicles, industry and government sources said on Tuesday.

The sources were speaking before a summit of politicians and car executives scheduled for Wednesday to discuss ways to cut inner-city pollution to try to head off bans on diesel cars -- a sensitive issue ahead of national elections next month.

The summit must also start to restore the reputation of one of Germany's major industries which has been badly tarnished since the Volkswagen emissions scandal broke in September 2015. [nL5N1KM2R7]

The auto industry has agreed to software updates for around 2 million cars that will cost around 300 million euros ($354 million), a government source said. An industry source said foreign car makers had not agreed to participate for now.

The deal suggests the industry has headed off demands for hardware upgrades that would cut more pollution but would also be much more expensive - with the potential costs as high as 10 billion euros.

The deal also foresees a range of other measures to reduce emissions, the sources said, such as subsidies for electric buses, taxis and other municipal vehicles, as well as a commitment to increase the number of charging stations.

The sector and the government will each contribute half to a 500 million euro fund aimed at helping local governments reduce pollution, blamed for causing respiratory diseases.

CITY BANS

The compromise might not cut emissions enough to stop bans of diesel cars in German cities - like the one in Stuttgart confirmed by a regional court last week. [nL5N1KJ2XB]

DUH, the environmental lobby group that brought the Stuttgart case, has said it wants moves to go beyond voluntary software updates or it will take further legal action.

Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives have come under fire from consumer and environmental groups as well as opposition lawmakers for their close links to carmakers.

"The car industry can always rely on the support of the government when things get difficult," said Timo Lange, a campaigner with LobbyControl, a non-profit group.

Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt rejected suggestions on Tuesday that he is too closely tied to the industry. [nL5N1KN231]

The Environment Ministry has already made clear that software improvements can only be a first step as they reduce nitrogen oxide emissions by about 25 percent on average.

The government is also demanding that auto makers finance their own schemes to encourage drivers to switch to newer, cleaner models, an implicit rejection of calls by some politicians for state subsidies.

On Tuesday, Ford announced it will pay owners of older vehicles designed to meet the Euro-1, Euro-2 or Euro-3 emission standards a bonus between 2,000 euros and 8,000 euros if they trade in their old cars and buy a new model by the end of 2017. ($1 = 0.8466 euros)
