By Paul Lienert

Oct 2 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co has formed a team to accelerate global development of electric vehicles, whose mission will be to "think big" and "make quicker decisions," an executive of the company said on Monday.

One aim of Ford's "Team Edison" is to identify and develop electric-vehicle partnerships with other companies, including suppliers, in some markets, according to Sherif Marakby, vice president of autonomous vehicles and electrification.

Global demand for electric vehicles has "a significant potential to increase" as governments implement EV mandates and quotas, Marakby said in an interview.

He said the group will be based in the Detroit area and work with regional Ford vehicle electrification teams in China and Europe.

China, India, France and the United Kingdom all have announced plans to phase out vehicles powered by combustion engines and fossil fuels between 2030 and 2040.

Marakby said Team Edison "will look holistically at the electric vehicle market."

"The idea is to think big, move fast and make quicker decisions" on EV production as demand increases and technology advances, he added.

Ford has not altered its previously announced plan to spend $4.5 billion over five years on electrified vehicles, including plug-in hybrids, Marakby said.

He declined to say how many new electric vehicles Ford expects to add in the future.

The new team will report to Ted Cannis, who has been named global director of electrification.

GM promises more electric vehicles, paid for by SUVs - Reuters News

{{20171002T160001.738+0000}}GM promises more electric vehicles, paid for by SUVsBy Joseph White

DETROIT, Oct 2 (Reuters) - Detroit automaker General Motors Co outlined plans on Monday to add 20 new battery electric and fuel cell vehicles to its global product lineup by 2023, financed by robust profits from sales of gasoline-fueled trucks and sport utility vehicles in the United States and China.

"General Motors believes in an all-electric future," GM global product development chief Mark Reuss said on Monday during a briefing at the company's suburban Detroit technical center.

Future generations of GM electric vehicles "will be profitable," Reuss said, but added it was not clear when GM could make all its new vehicle offerings zero-emission electric cars.

Regulators in China and some European countries have floated proposals to ban internal combustion engines by 2030 or 2040.

"We will continue to make sure our internal combustion engines will get more and more efficient," Reuss said.

GM shares were up more than 4 percent in midday New York trading on positive comments from Rod Lache, auto analyst at Deutsche Bank.

Automakers, including electric vehicle market leader Tesla Inc , lose money on electric cars because battery costs are still higher than comparable internal combustion engines.

GM funds its forays into new technology using a river of cash generated by old-technology vehicles popular with its core customer base in the United States heartland. In comparison, Tesla has burned through an estimated $10 billion in cash and has yet to show a full year profit.

GM earned more than 90 percent of its $12.5 billion in pretax profits last year in North America, amid robust demand for its lineup of large sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks. The company's profitable operations in China rely on consumer demand for an expanding lineup of gasoline powered SUVs.

GM has previously announced plans to make some of its future electric vehicles capable of driving themselves in robot taxi fleets. The company offered sneak peeks of three electric vehicle prototypes: a Buick brand sport utility vehicle, a sporty Cadillac wagon and a futuristic pod car wearing a Bolt badge.

GM collaborated with Korean battery maker LG Chem <051910.KS> to build the Bolt battery system. Company officials did not say what companies would supply batteries for the larger fleet of vehicles promised by 2023.

Fuel cell vehicles will also play a role in GM's future, the company said. GM showed on Monday a prototype of a rolling, hydrogen fueled platform called "SURUS" that could be used for multiple purposes.

The company plans to offer a fuel cell vehicle to retail customers within five years, it said. Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T>, Honda Motor Co <7267.T> and Hyundai Motor Co <005380.KS> already are marketing fuel cell vehicles in low volume.

GM Chief Executive Mary Barra said last month the company plans to introduce at least 10 new electric or hybrid vehicles to the Chinese market by 2020, and open a battery plant this year with Chinese partner SAIC Motor Corp Ltd 600104.SS.

China has set goals for electric and plug-in hybrid cars to make up at least a fifth of auto sales by 2025. Some of the electric vehicles GM will offer in China are among the 20 Reuss promised by 2023.[nL4N1LW25D]

GM also hinted that it may take new steps to expand the public infrastructure for rapid recharging of electric vehicles, without offering any details.

The No. 1 U.S. automaker joins several rivals, including German automakers Daimler AG, Volkswagen AG and BMW AG, that have pledged to accelerate development of electric vehicles, in response to proposals in China and several European countries to ban internal combustion engines by 2030 or 2040.

GM's announcement comes just two days before rival Ford Motor Co is scheduled to roll out a new strategic plan, and as Tesla Inc ramps up production of its high-volume Model 3 electric sedan.[nL5N1LT47Z]

UPDATE 1-U.S. senators announce deal on self-driving car legislation - Reuters News

{{20170928T014642.911+0000}}UPDATE 1-U.S. senators announce deal on self-driving car legislation(Adds joint statement, details of House bill, background)

By David Shepardson

WASHINGTON, Sept 27 (Reuters) - Two U.S. senators said late on Wednesday that they had reached a bipartisan deal on legislation aimed at easing hurdles to getting self-driving cars to drivers.

U.S. Senator John Thune, a Republican who chairs the Commerce Committee, and Senator Gary Peters, a Michigan Democrat, said they had reached a deal on the legislation that would be voted on by the committee on Oct. 4.

They said they planned to release the text on Thursday.

General Motors Co , Alphabet Inc , Ford Motor Co and others have lobbied for the legislation to speed deployment of self-driving cars without human controls by allowing federal regulators to approve their use if they deem them safe and barring states from blocking autonomous vehicles.

Current law prohibits vehicles without human controls

Two sources briefed on the matter said the bill would not include larger commercial trucks.

"We expect adoption of self-driving vehicle technologies will save lives, improve mobility for people with disabilities, and create new jobs," Thune and Peters said in a joint statement.

A similar bill that unanimously passed the U.S. House earlier this month also excluded vehicles above 10,000 pounds.

Senate aides have been negotiating for weeks over trucks and language in the bill that could preempt some state court lawsuits over the safety of self-driving vehicles.

The House measure, the first significant federal legislation aimed at speeding self-driving cars to market, would allow automakers get approval to sell up to 25,000 vehicles in the first year, rising to 100,000 by year three, as long as they could demonstrate the vehicles are at least as safe as current vehicles with human controls.

States could still set rules on registration, licensing, liability, insurance and safety inspections, but not performance standards.

Automakers would have to submit safety assessment reports to regulators, but the bill would not require pre-market approval of advanced vehicle technologies.

Automakers and some technology companies hope to begin deploying driverless vehicles around 2020. They have been pushing for new federal rules making it easier to deploy self-driving technology, but some consumer groups have sought additional safeguards.

States have issued a variety of rules in the absence of clear federal guidance, and automakers have complained that California's rules are too restrictive.

Advocates hope self-driving cars will reduce U.S. road deaths, which rose 7.7 percent in 2015, the highest annual increase since 1966. A 2014 study found U.S. traffic crashes cost society $836 billion annually, with human error behind 94 percent of crashes.

Detroit Three's to lose dominance of North American auto output in 2017-IHS - Reuters News

{{20170927T181323.337+0000}}Detroit Three's to lose dominance of North American auto output in 2017-IHSBy Joseph White

DETROIT, Sept 27 (Reuters) - North American vehicle production by the unionized Detroit Three automakers will fall behind the combined North American output of Tesla Inc and automakers from Europe and Asia for the first time this year, IHS Markit forecast on Wednesday.

In 2017, the Detroit Three could build 8.6 million vehicles in North America, while Tesla and foreign automakers build 8.7 million, IHS Markit analyst Joe Langley said on Wednesday.

By 2024, the gap will widen, with Asian and European automakers and Tesla combining to build about 9.8 million vehicles in North America. General Motors Co , Ford Motor Co and the North American operations of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV will combine to build 8.1 million vehicles, down 6 percent from this year.

Mexico is on track to increase its share of North American vehicle production, Langley said, moving to 4.5 million vehicles a year by 2024 from about 4 million vehicles currently.

The milestone for the growth of Tesla and foreign automakers in North America comes as the Trump administration is pushing to limit imports of vehicles from Mexico in negotiations to overhaul the North American Free Trade Agreement.

The declining share of North American vehicle production for the Detroit automakers also challenges U.S. and Canadian unions that represent their workers.

Canadian workers are on strike at a GM factory in Ontario to protest the automaker's decision to cut jobs and move to Mexico some production of sport utility models built there.

Foreign automakers over the past year have announced plans for a wave of new or expanded plants in North America, while Tesla is ramping up to build as many as 500,000 cars a year at its plant in Fremont, Calif. Often referred to as "transplants," the foreign-owned factories are poised to become the mainstream of the North American auto industry. [nL2N1M21EG]

Automakers are increasingly using factories in China or Mexico to build vehicles that used to be assembled solely in the United States, Langley said. He cited as an example Ford's decision to shift production of the Focus small car for North America to a Chinese assembly plant.

UPDATE 1-Ford, Lyft will partner to deploy self-driving cars - Reuters News

{{20170927T143505.051+0000}}UPDATE 1-Ford, Lyft will partner to deploy self-driving cars(Adds statement from General Motors on Ford announcement)

By Joseph White

DETROIT, Sept 27 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co said on Wednesday it will collaborate with Lyft to deploy Ford self-driving vehicles on the ride-services company's network in large numbers by 2021.

Ford and Lyft teams will begin working together to design software to allow Ford vehicles to communicate with Lyft's smartphone apps.

Ford self-driving test vehicles will be connected to Lyft's network, but at first, customers will not be able to use them, Sherif Marakby, Ford's vice president for autonomous vehicles and electrification, told Reuters. Ford will put human-driven vehicles on Lyft's network.

He did not say when Ford and Lyft expect to offer the first rides in self-driving cars.

"We're not building prototypes for the sake of building prototypes," Marakby said, adding Ford intends to ultimately put thousands of self-driving vehicles in use.

Ford's new Chief Executive Jim Hackett is scheduled to meet with investors on Tuesday to outline the Dearborn, Mich. automaker's strategy for boosting profitability. Ford shares are down 1.65 percent so far this year, while Detroit rival General Motors Co's shares have risen 15.6 percent, and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV shares are up 71 percent.

Hackett's plans to compete for revenue from mobility services, which include car sharing and ride hailing, will be one area of focus for investors. The Lyft partnership fills in a piece of the puzzle.

Ford also is testing delivery services using self-driving vehicles and a van shuttle service. The self-driving vehicles Ford will deploy through Lyft will use software developed by Argo AI, a company in which Ford is investing $1 billion over the next five years. [nL1N1FV1FS]

The company has said it will invest $700 million in a factory in Flat Rock, Michigan, to make it capable of building electric and self-driving vehicles.

Lyft has said it will offer an open platform for companies to deploy self-driving vehicles on its network, and has partnerships with self-driving vehicle technology startup Drive.ai and Alphabet Inc's Waymo self-driving car unit. [nL2N1IH02T]

GM has a 9 percent stake in Lyft, acquired for $500 million in January 2016. "Our relationship with GM has always been a non-exclusive relationship," Raj Kapoor, Lyft's chief strategy officer, told Reuters.

GM is also assembling the assets necessary to launch its own ride services using self-driving cars, building its Maven car-sharing unit and preparing to launch mass production of autonomous Chevrolet Bolt electric cars at a factory in suburban Detroit. [nL2N1L21XX]

"This does not affect our existing business relationship with Lyft," GM said in a statement on Ford's announcement. "GM's plan remains steadfast - we are on track to launch our self-driving technology first in a ride-sharing application."

By Paul Sandle

LONDON, Sept 26 (Reuters) - James Dyson, the billionaire British inventor of the bagless vacuum cleaner, said on Tuesday his company was working on developing an electric car to be launched by 2020.

Dyson said he was spending 2 billion pounds ($2.7 billion) to exploit his namesake company's expertise in solid-state battery technology and electric motors to be found in his innovative vacuum cleaners and other products like bladeless fans and air purifiers.

"Battery technology is very important to Dyson, electric motors are very important to Dyson, environmental control is very important to us," Dyson, aged 71, said at his company's flagship shop on London's Oxford Street.

"I have been developing these technologies consistently because I could see that one day we could do a car."

Dyson said a 400-strong team of engineers had already spent 2-1/2 years working on the hitherto secret car project in Malmesbury, Wiltshire. However, the car itself still has to be designed and the choice of battery to be finalised.

The company was backing solid-state rather than the lithium ion technology used in existing electric vehicles because it was safer, the batteries would not overheat, were quicker to charge and potentially more powerful, he said.

Dyson said his ambition to go it alone was driven by the car industry's dismissal of an idea he had of applying his cyclonic technology that revolutionised vacuum cleaners to handle diesel emissions in car exhaust systems in the 1990s.

"We are not a johnny-come-lately onto the scene of electric cars," he said. "It has been my ambition since 1998 when I was rejected by the industry, which has happily gone on making polluting diesel engines, and governments have gone on allowing it."

There had already been clues that Dyson was working on a car.

His company has been hiring executives from Aston Martin and last year the government said in a report it was helping to fund development work on an electric vehicle at the firm, although the entry was quickly changed.

Dyson said he was coming clean now because it was becoming harder to talk to subcontractors, government and potential new employees.

FAR EAST MARKET

But the car does not yet have a design nor a chassis, he said, and the company had not yet decided where it will be made, beyond ruling out working with the big car companies.

"Wherever we make the battery, we'll make the car, that's logical," he said. "So we want to be near our suppliers, we want to be in a place that welcomes us and is friendly to us, and where it is logistically most sensible.

"And we see a very large market for this car in the Far East."

Dyson gave no details of the concept for the vehicle, beyond saying it would not be like anything else already on the market.

"There's no point in doing one that looks like everyone else's," he said, adding that it would not be a sports car and it would not be "a very cheap" car.

Dyson, who was a prominent backer of the campaign for Britain to leave the European Union, has been able to fund the project through the profits of his holding company.

The Weybourne Group reported a 55 percent rise in pretax profit to 473 million pounds in 2016 on revenue of 2.53 billion pounds, according to accounts filed earlier this month. On Tuesday Dyson told his workforce, which includes more than 1,000 engineers, that the company finally had the opportunity to bring all its technologies together into a single product.

"Competition for new technology in the automotive industry is fierce and we must do everything we can to keep the specifics of our vehicle confidential," he said in an email.

James Dyson to build electric car by 2020 - Reuters News

{{20170926T154835.290+0000}}James Dyson to build electric car by 2020LONDON, Sept 26 (Reuters) - James Dyson, the billionaire inventor of the bagless vacuum cleaner, said his company was building a "radical" all-electric car for launch in 2020, with a commitment to spend 2 billion pounds ($2.7 billion) on solid-state battery technology and vehicle design.

Dyson said a 400-strong team of engineers had already spent two and a half years working on the secret project in Malmesbury, Wiltshire, developing the batteries that will power the in-house designed electric motor for the car.

He said on Tuesday he had not yet decided where the vehicle would be manufactured, although he had ruled out working with any existing auto companies.

Corporate donations for Harvey, Irma disaster relief near $225 mln - Reuters News

{{20170922T235955.092+0000}}Corporate donations for Harvey, Irma disaster relief near $225 mlnBy Ruthy Munoz

HOUSTON, Sept 22 (Reuters) - Corporate donations for Hurricanes Harvey and Irma relief funds totaled nearly $225 million by Friday and pledges continued to be made, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation said.

Automakers and energy companies, some of them affected by the most powerful storm to hit Texas' Gulf Coast in 50 years, are among the prominent corporate donors. Texas, the biggest oil-producing state, was pummeled by Harvey when it made landfall as a powerful Category 4 hurricane and proceeded to dump more than 50 inches of rain on the Houston region.

In all, around 90 businesses have donated at least $1 million each, Bailey Jacobs, a spokeswoman for the Chamber of Commerce Foundation.

Phillips 66 donated $4 million, an amount divided among the American Red Cross, Rebuild Texas Fund and United Way of Greater Houston, the company said in a statement. Mining and energy company BHP Billiton PLC's foundation donated $1.25 million to the American Red Cross, said James Ensor, BHP Billiton Foundation executive officer and president.

Some companies have donated to Rebuild Texas Fund, started by computer magnate Michael Dell in collaboration with OneStar Foundation. It received pledges for $68.6 million as of Friday, according to its website. The fund aims to raise $100 million to rebuild communities in Texas affected by Harvey. [nL2N1LB077]

BP donated 200,000 gallons of fuel to the city of Houston and Harris County's emergency management office to help with clean-up efforts and donated $750,000 for food, water, shelter and health services for flood victims, a spokesman said in a statement.

Automaker Ford Motor Co and its dealers donated more than $3.5 million in disaster relief and $500,000 to the Red Cross, a spokesman said in a statement. Chevrolet, a division of General Motors Co , donated $1 million to Habitat for Humanity, said spokesman James Cain. Ford, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles , GM and Hyundai Motor Co <005380.KS> offered discounts for customers needing to replace flooded vehicles, the companies said in separate releases.

Donations also are being funneled to storm-hit areas of Florida and the Caribbean.

"Companies are tailoring their responses to each disaster to ensure they are supporting the communities in need," said Chamber of Commerce Foundation spokesman Marc DeCourcey.

Celebrities contributing to hurricane relief efforts include Houston Texans' football player J.J. Watt, actor Sandra Bullock, and singers Beyonce Knowles and Janet Jackson. Watt's Houston Flood Relief Fund had $37 million worth of pledges on Friday, bringing the total of corporate and celebrity donations to over $300 million. [nL2N1LM0Z5]

UPDATE 1-Volvo rolls out compact SUV in latest upmarket move under Geely - Reuters News

{{20170921T142120.204+0000}}UPDATE 1-Volvo rolls out compact SUV in latest upmarket move under Geely* Volvo adds new smaller car to product range

* Offers customers option to pay by subscription

* Enters crowded but growing sector

(Adds quotes, details)

By Agnieszka Flak

MILAN, Sept 21 (Reuters) - Volvo Cars showed off its first compact SUV on Thursday with the launch of its XC40 model, the latest in a sweeping overhaul of the carmaker's line-up under Chinese ownership.

Volvo will seek to emulate the success of its larger XC90 and best-selling XC60 SUVs, which have put it on course for a fourth straight year of record sales.

The XC40, which will first be produced at Volvo's plant in Belgium and later also in China, is a direct competitor to the Audi Q3, BMW X1, Mercedes GLA and the Jaguar E-PACE.

Deliveries in Europe will start in the middle of the first quarter of 2018, in the United States by the end of March and in China by early May. In Germany the model will have a starting price of 31,350 euros ($37,354).

The XC40 will also launch Volvo's new subscription service, under which customers can pay a flat fee per month - in Europe of 699 euros ($833) - and get a new car every 24 months, just like with a mobile phone.

Since it was bought from Ford by Zhejiang Geely Holding Group [GEELY.UL] in 2010, Volvo has taken on larger rivals such as BMW and Daimler's Mercedes-Benz with new, more upmarket models.

"The XC40 is our first entry in the small SUV segment, broadening the appeal of the Volvo brand and moving it in a new direction," CEO Hakan Samuelsson said.

SUVs have been growing in popularity and are expected to make up almost half of all sales within the C, mid-size segment by 2020, data from IHS Markit shows, compared with just 20 percent a decade earlier.

"The XC40 is entering a crowded segment, but it's a segment that's still growing," said Ian Fletcher, an automotive analyst at IHS Markit.

RIDING HIGH

Volvo will be trying to appeal to customers looking for a high driving position, practicality and muscular looks of an SUV but with modest off-road capabilities and better efficiency.

"Volvo is ploughing its own furrow and is trying to offer an interesting alternative to the German carmakers," Fletcher said.

"This will appeal to city dwellers, people looking for some aspects of an SUV but with the cool Volvo styling."

Fletcher sees the XC40 selling around 100,000 units next year, rising to just under 120,000 the following year.

The XC40 will edge Volvo closer to its medium-term sales target of 800,000 cars, up from 534,332 last year and is the first model to come off a new modular vehicle architecture (CMA), which was developed with Geely in a bid to keep down costs and boost flexibility.

The Gothenburg-based company said in July all of its models launched after 2019 would be electric or hybrids.[nL8N1JW0JU]

After struggling under Ford, the comeback at Volvo has prompted market speculation of a potential initial public offering. Samuelsson reiterated a listing was "an option for our owner" but right now the company was not preparing an IPO. ($1 = 0.8393 euros)

Produced at Volvo's plant in Ghent, Belgium, the XC40 is a direct competitor to the Audi Q3, BMW X1, Mercedes GLA and the recently launched Jaguar E-PACE.

China is expected to be a significant market for the XC40 along with Europe, especially Volvo's home market in Sweden.

It is also expected to do well in the United States, where Volvo has seen a resurgence after a few years in the doldrums, Fletcher said.

Fletcher sees the XC40 selling around 100,000 units next year, roughly half the expected deliveries for the Audi Q3 and the BMW X1, but more than around 60,000 Jaguar E-PACE.

The XC40 will edge Volvo closer to its medium-term sales target of 800,000 cars, up from 534,332 last year and is the first model to come off a new modular vehicle architecture (CMA), which was developed with Geely in a bid to keep down costs and boost flexibility.

The CMA platform will underpin all other upcoming models in the 40 series, including fully electrified vehicles.

UPDATE 1-Ford to cut production at five North American vehicle plants - Reuters News

{{20170919T202602.061+0000}}UPDATE 1-Ford to cut production at five North American vehicle plants(Adds inventory data, employees affected)

By Joseph White

DETROIT, Sept 19 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co said on Tuesday it plans to idle five North American vehicle assembly plants for a total of 10 weeks to reduce inventories of slow-selling models.

The plants affected include three assembly plants in the United States and two in Mexico, the company said in a statement. The vehicle models include the Ford Fusion and Lincoln MKZ midsize sedans, the Ford Focus compact car, the Lincoln Continental and Ford Mustang, Ford Fiesta and the Ford Transit van.

Ford said the Cuautitlan assembly plant that builds the Fiesta would be idled for three weeks. The Hermosillo, Mexico plant that builds the Fusion and MKZ and the Flat Rock, Michigan, factory that assembles Continentals and Mustangs will be idled for two weeks each. The Michigan Assembly plant that builds the Focus will be idled for one week and the Kansas City assembly line that builds Transit vans will be down for two weeks. Ford did not give dates for the temporary shutdowns.

The factories involved employ more than 15,000 people, according to Ford's website. The company did not say how many of those workers would face temporary layoffs.

As of Sept. 1, Ford had 111 days' worth of unsold Mustangs, 87 days' supply of Fusions, and a 103 days' supply of Transit vans, according to Automotive News. Dealers had enough unsold Lincoln Continentals to last 162 days. Automakers aim for 65 to 70 days of inventory of most models.

Ford and rival General Motors Co have wrestled most of this year to rein in high inventories of passenger cars as consumers have shifted to buying pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles. Production cuts slice into revenue, but also could help the automakers avoid deeper price cuts on vehicles they can sell.

{{20170919T141123.899+0000}}Brazil auto sales seen accelerating in 2018 -industry groupSAO PAULO, Sept 19 (Reuters) - Growth of new automobile sales in Brazil next year should exceed the growth forecast for this year, the president of national automakers association Anfavea said on Tuesday, underscoring that a deep economic downturn has finally passed.

"All indicators give us the confidence to say the recovery has already arrived," Anfavea President Antonio Megale said at an industry event, adding that "2018 will be a year of great challenges, but we can say growth will be greater than 2017. We will return to levels closer to double digits."

This month Anfavea raised its estimate for new auto sales in 2017 to 7.3 percent growth, from a prior estimate of 4 percent.

UPDATE 5-Ford, Mahindra alliance reflects pressures on automakers - Reuters News

{{20170918T225317.198+0000}}UPDATE 5-Ford, Mahindra alliance reflects pressures on automakers* Potential cooperation to include product development, EVs

* Ford, Mahindra teams to work together for up to 3 years

* Second time the two automakers are set to work together

(Adds reasons for alliance in first paragraph)

By Swati Bhat and Joseph White

MUMBAI/DETROIT, Sept 18 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co and Indian vehicle maker Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd said on Monday they will launch a strategic alliance to counter challenges posed by fast-changing technology and global competition.

The agreement, which builds on a former alliance that was unwound in 2005, is another sign that Ford's Chief Executive Jim Hackett, who took over in May, has begun to steer the automaker in a different direction.

Ford and other global automakers are under pressure as policymakers demand they shift their product lines entirely to electric vehicles over the next two to three decades. One potential benefit to Ford of a partnership with Mahindra is access to lower cost electric vehicle designs and local suppliers it needs to compete in markets such as India.

Ford has less than a 3 percent market share in India, although its exports from India are expanding rapidly. Near term, Mahindra could help Ford lower its distribution costs or send production work to Ford's Indian plants.

At the same time, regional automakers such as Mahindra with ambitions to grow need access to technology, strong brands and global distribution networks that established companies like Ford can offer.

Hackett's decision to no longer go it alone in India follows a move to hire an outsider to run Ford's operations in China, and shift production of the Ford Focus for the U.S. market to China, instead of Mexico as previously planned. Hackett has also launched reviews of the company's luxury brand strategy and self-driving car development. [nL1N1KG0XO]

Ford and Mahindra said in a joint announcement they would seek ways to collaborate on a wide range of projects for up to three years. Financial terms were not disclosed. Ford shares rose 0.9 percent Monday.

Ford president of global markets, Jim Farley, and Ford's head of Asia Pacific operations, Peter Fleet, told Reuters on Monday that teams from the companies will start meeting next week to discuss ways to benefit in the short and medium term.

"We are focused on the now and near with this initiative. We want to work on the opportunities that are right in front of us," Farley said.

In the shorter term, Ford and Mahindra suggested they could benefit from collaborating on distribution of vehicles in India, pooling purchasing and collaborating on forays into ride services.

Ford and Mahindra had a partnership during the 1990s and early 2000s that involved cross share-holdings.

Ford does not break out results from India, but the company reported a pre-tax loss for the second quarter in Asian and Pacific markets outside of China.

Longer-term projects could include sharing technology or development efforts for electric vehicles, the companies said. For Ford, the Mahindra deal points to a new strategy for dealing with demands from policymakers in many major markets to phase out petroleum-fueled vehicles in favor of electric cars and trucks.

Ford, like global rivals, faces a challenge because electric vehicles engineered for the United States or Europe are too expensive for Indian or Chinese customers. Policymakers in China and India, as well as some European countries, have signaled they want the industry to phase out diesel and gasoline vehicles over the next two to three decades. [nL2N1LT08K]

FAST-GROWING MARKETS

By allying with Mahindra, Ford can work with the leader in the emerging low-cost electric vehicle market in India. In China, Ford said last month it would pursue a joint venture with Chinese low-cost electric vehicle maker Zotye.

"We will certainly be introducing the companies," Ford's Fleet said.

India is one of the world's fastest-growing car markets. Getting more companies to manufacture in India - both for its own market and for export - is critical for Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government, which needs to create millions of new jobs each year as the workforce expands.

However, global car makers like Fiat Chrysler , Volkswagen and General Motors have struggled in India, where nimbler rivals such as Maruti Suzuki and Hyundai Motor <005380.KS> have cornered roughly two-thirds of the market.

Turbulence in the Indian economy, and shifts in government policy on vehicle taxes and regulation have further complicated the situation for global automakers. Earlier in September, for example, India's cabinet approved an increase in the maximum levy on luxury cars and sport utility vehicles to as much as 25 percent - less than two months after deciding on a lower rate of 15 percent as part of the new nationwide goods and services tax. [nL4N1LG3HG]

In May, General Motors said it would stop selling cars in India at the end of this year. [nL4N1IK1ZS]

Mahindra and Ford said their prospective alliance would give Ford access to Mahindra's distribution network in India while Mahindra would benefit from Ford's market reach in other developing economies.

The U.S. company has already invested more than $2 billion in India and plans to spend more to set up a global engineering center in the southern city of Chennai to help adapt products for the local market and changing consumer trends. India has the second-highest number of Ford employees of any country, company officials said. [nL4N1D93H0]

Ford is among the top exporters of cars from India and manufactures and exports vehicles and engines from its plants in Chennai, Tamil Nadu and Sanand, Gujarat.

ANALYSIS-U.S. push for self-driving law exposes regulatory divide - Reuters News

{{20170915T151424.693+0000}}ANALYSIS-U.S. push for self-driving law exposes regulatory divideBy Tina Bellon

NEW YORK, Sept 15 (Reuters) - As the U.S. Congress moves quickly to pass the first federal law governing self-driving cars, some state and city officials are pushing back over fears that the measure will limit their ability to regulate vehicle safety at the local level.

The debate highlights the challenges of rolling out a new technology that does not fit neatly into an existing regulatory framework. States traditionally regulate the driver while the federal government regulates the car, but that division of labor may be hard to maintain when cars have no drivers.

Industry officials say a single, nationwide set of standards would speed the development of self-driving vehicle technology, ultimately lead to fewer highway deaths, and keep the United States in the forefront of automotive technology.

The U.S. House of Representatives unanimously approved the sweeping bill last week, and U.S. Senator John Thune said on Wednesday he wanted to move the bill out of committee by early October. [nL2N1LN1G5]

The federal bill bars states and cities from implementing "unreasonable restrictions" on the rollout of self-driving cars. Critics say the vague language could lead the industry to sue states over any regulations they consider overly burdensome.

"If Congress preempts state and local governments from enacting smart safety protections, the adoption of this amazing technology could be unnecessarily delayed by court challenges and state legislative action," said Leah Treat, director of the transportation bureau in Portland, Oregon, which is set to enact its own self-driving regulations by the end of the year.

In a Sept. 5 letter to U.S. congressional leaders, the National Governors Association, the National Conference of State Legislators and other groups said the federal rules encroached on state authority and urged federal lawmakers to change the bill's language.

The new measure authorizes manufacturers to put 25,000 self-driving cars on the road in the next year for testing. Those numbers would gradually increase, with a total of 275,000 vehicles permitted by 2021.

Critics of the federal bill said they generally support the development of self-driving technology but felt neglected and overruled by federal legislators.

"California, for example, has higher emission standards," said Jennifer Cohen, government affairs director for the Los Angeles Department of Transportation. "Does the federal preemption preclude us from enforcing these? Can we still protect our school zones?"

FEDERAL VS. STATE

Though fully-autonomous cars are still years away from widespread adoption, 25 states have already passed legislation or issued executive orders related to autonomous vehicles, according to the National Conference of State Legislators.

New York, for example, has taken a strict approach to testing, requiring self-driving cars to follow an approved route with a police escort. The state also has a law that requires drivers to have at least one hand on the wheel of any car, though it was suspended until April 2018 to accommodate autonomous vehicle testing.

Data-sharing is also a major flashpoint. Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto said earlier this year he was disappointed Uber, which is testing a fleet of autonomous vehicles there, has been hesitant to share data the city could use to improve traffic flow and infrastructure.

Uber said it would share some data starting this year on a voluntary basis, but Chan Lieu, a former director of governmental affairs at NHTSA who is now an advisor to the Self-Driving Coalition for Safer Streets, which includes Ford , Alphabet's Waymo, Volvo Cars, Uber [UBER.UL] and Lyft, said the companies would oppose broad data disclosure requirements.

There are privacy concerns, he said, as well as commercial fears of revealing trade secrets.

California currently requires the industry to hand over data on vehicle disengagements and collisions, and the National Association of City Transportation Officials has called for the federal government to adopt similar requirements.

Not all states are concerned about the federal bill. Arizona governor Douglas Ducey issued a 2015 executive order saying his state supported the self-driving industry and hoped the technology would bring new jobs to the state.

Arizona does not currently impose any restrictions on self-driving cars. Kevin Biesty, the deputy director for policy at Arizona's department for transportation, said the state largely trusted automakers to adapt their technology as concerns arise.

"One of the reasons we did not step forward and regulate is because the industry is changing so fast and what you release today might become obsolete in six months," he said.

Ford Sollers to hire 700 staff to meet car demand in Russia - Reuters News

{{20170915T075818.656+0000}}Ford Sollers to hire 700 staff to meet car demand in RussiaBERLIN, Sept 14 (Reuters) - Ford's Russian joint venture plans to hire more than 700 workers at its plant in Elabuga in Tatarstan to meet growing auto demand, especially for sport-utility vehicles (SUVs) and light commercial vans, the carmaker said on Thursday.

It will add a second shift to the factory for the first time in four years, with hirings due to start next month, to assemble Ford Kuga, Explorer and Transit models.

"Development of SUV and light commercial vehicle line-ups is the core of our strategy now," Ford Sollers Chief Executive Adil Shirinov said. "We are committed to growing our market share in 2018 as well."

Auto sales in Russia jumped 17 percent in August compared with year-earlier levels, the Association of European Businesses lobby said last week. [nR4N1LM01I]

REFILE-Renault, Toyota lead European car sales rise in August - Reuters News

{{20170914T060258.872+0000}}REFILE-Renault, Toyota lead European car sales rise in August(Refiles to remove extraneous text from headline, with no other changes to text)

BERLIN, Sept 14 (Reuters) - European car sales rose 5.5 percent in August, accelerating from an increase of 2.6 percent in July, according to industry data published on Thursday.

Registrations rose to 903,143 vehicles in the European Union (EU) and European Free Trade Association (EFTA) countries in August and to 1.19 million vehicles for July, Brussels-based industry body ACEA said.

For the first eight months of the year, registrations were up 4.4 percent to 10.56 million vehicles.

In the 28-nation EU excluding Malta, registrations climbed 5.6 percent to 865,047 vehicles in August, the best August performance in a decade, ACEA said.

Europe's largest carmaker, Volkswagen , which is still grappling with its diesel emissions scandal, saw August deliveries rise 2.8 percent, with its namesake brand down 4.4 percent.

Among the major manufacturers, Renault and Toyota <7203.T> saw the biggest monthly increases with 13 percent and 12.5 percent, followed by Fiat Chrysler with 9.8 percent.

Performance was mixed for the region's two biggest markets. Germany saw a 3.5 percent increase, while Britain registered a 6.4 percent drop, continuing a 9.3 percent fall seen in July.

UPDATE 1-Ford self-driving test van 'talks' to pedestrians via light signals - Reuters News

{{20170913T184546.879+0000}}UPDATE 1-Ford self-driving test van 'talks' to pedestrians via light signals(Adds quotes from event, background)

WASHINGTON, Sept 13 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co and Virginia Tech Transportation Institute are testing a way to enable self-driving vehicles to communicate their movements visually to pedestrians, cyclists and to human drivers, the researchers said on Wednesday.

The new communications method, which uses simple light signals to depict whether a self-driving vehicle is slowing or accelerating, has the potential to become a universal industry standard in all countries, Ford and institute researchers said.

The automaker set out to find "a way to replace the head nod or hand wave" to convey to pedestrians the intent of a driverless vehicle, according to John Shutko, Ford's human factors technical specialist.

Researchers rejected the use of displayed text because of potential language barriers, and symbols because of their low recognition.

Instead, they settled on visual signals from a light bar placed on the windshield of a Ford Transit Van. A solid white light shows the vehicle is in full autonomous mode, a blinking white light indicates acceleration and a pair of white lights moving side to side signals slowing and stopping.

The specially outfitted Transit Van logged 1,800 miles (2,900 km) in August, much of it in and around Arlington, Virginia, including urban intersections, parking lots and garages.

The aim of the exercise was to capture on video human reactions to both a self-driving vehicle and to the light signals from the windshield.

The van was piloted by a human driver, who wore a camouflaged "seat suit" to simulate a driverless vehicle. The vehicles drew some attention on social and local news media reports.

The research effort supports vehicle manufacturers and users, but also "anyone who walks, rides or drives alongside autonomous vehicles in the future," said Andy Schaudt, project director at the institute's Center for Automated Vehicle Systems.

Shutko said "the biggest failure mode" would be if every automaker had a different way of alerting pedestrians of driverless vehicles. The company is working with an industry group and other automakers "to try to gain global consensus."

Shutko said the company is conscious of the potential backlash to fully self-driving cars.

Ford has set a target of putting a self-driving shuttle into commercial ride-sharing fleets by 2021.

{{20170911T043648.412+0000}}PRESS DIGEST- New York Times business news - Sept 11Sept 11 (Reuters) - The following are the top stories on the New York Times business pages. Reuters has not verified these stories and does not vouch for their accuracy.

- When Apple Inc unveils its new top-of-the-line iPhone on Tuesday, it will also enter new territory on price: The latest phone will start at about $1,000, compared with the $769 minimum for its current top phone, the iPhone 7 Plus. http://nyti.ms/2gVZgKP

- Volkswagen AG , the German auto giant, is preparing for a swift expansion in its output of electric cars next year — and the biggest jump in production will be in China. General Motors Co is making China the hub of its electric car research and development. Renault-Nissan, the French and Japanese carmaker, and Ford Motor Co have hustled to set up joint electric-car ventures in China. http://nyti.ms/2ePdQTR

- In the wake of the disclosure on Thursday by Equifax Inc that hackers had compromised its collection of private information, potentially affecting 143 million Americans, The New York Times asked readers to tell their own tales of being hacked. Some previous victims of data breaches have also taken to Twitter. http://nyti.ms/2gVA2zW

- Construction cranes are a ubiquitous sight in Miami, symbols of a growing city towering hundreds of feet above its streets.

Ford's Lincoln brand plans electrified versions of all models by 2022 -sources - Reuters News

{{20170907T202115.224+0000}}Ford's Lincoln brand plans electrified versions of all models by 2022 -sourcesBy Paul Lienert

DETROIT, Sept 7 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co's premium Lincoln brand plans to offer hybrid gasoline-electric versions of all its U.S. models by 2022, according to three sources familiar with the plans.

Details could be announced as early as Oct. 3, when Ford Chief Executive Officer Jim Hackett plans to update investors on the automaker's strategy.

Company officials are also considering whether to introduce one or more all-electric Lincoln models, one source said. The proposed electrification scheme could be critical to Lincoln's future in China, which will require automakers to make electric vehicles an increasing percentage of their total sales.

The Lincoln hybrids are part of a broader Ford program to offer at least 18 new electric and hybrid models over the next five years, the sources said.

Lincoln aims to follow a path blazed this year by several European premium brands, including Daimler AG , Zhejiang Geely Holding Group's Volvo Cars [GEELY.UL], BMW and Jaguar Land Rover [TAMOJL.UL], all of which have announced plans to offer more hybrid and all-electric vehicles. [nL8N1LO3RS]

Global luxury brands are responding to competitive pressure from Elon Musk's Tesla Inc , and proposals by the Chinese government to mandate significantly higher levels of electric vehicle sales in the world's largest auto market.

The plan to offer a portfolio of Lincoln hybrid models was crafted before Hackett took over in May, the sources said.

Ford said in January 2016 it would spend $4.5 billion to electrify a portion of its U.S. fleet, including hybrid versions of the Mustang and the F-150, and at least 11 other models. The extent of its electrification effort, including details on specific new and redesigned models, has not previously been disclosed.

A Ford spokesman said the company would not comment on future products.

As the Lincoln brand rolls out redesigned versions of its existing models and introduces at least one new model, it is planning to introduce plug-in hybrid versions of those vehicles, beginning with the redesigned MKC crossover and the new Aviator crossover in 2019, the sources said.

The redesigned Lincoln Navigator utility vehicle, which goes on sale this autumn, is expected to add a conventional hybrid version in 2019.

Subsequent redesigned Lincoln models, including the MKZ sedan in 2020 and the Continental sedan and MKX crossover in 2022, are expected to include plug-in hybrid variants, the sources said.

Trump administration, states headed for showdown over fuel rules - Reuters News

{{20170906T155850.990+0000}}Trump administration, states headed for showdown over fuel rulesBy David Shepardson

WASHINGTON, Sept 6 (Reuters) - The Trump administration and major U.S. states appear to be headed for a showdown over landmark rules aimed at doubling the fuel efficiency of vehicles sold in the United States.

At an Environmental Protection Agency public hearing on Wednesday on the fuel rules in Washington, California air resources board official Annette Hebert warned that the state could withdraw from a nationwide vehicle emissions program if the EPA weakens the regulations or ignores the technical record. New York state also urged the administration not to weaken the rules.

"Science doesn't change based on election results," Hebert said, referring to the November election of Republican President Donald Trump.

In March, Trump ordered a review of U.S. vehicle fuel-efficiency standards from model year 2022 through 2025 established under the Obama administration, and suggested he would reduce regulatory requirements.

"The assault on the American auto industry is over," he told automakers in Michigan. [nL2N1GS1B0]

Automakers want the White House and California to reach agreement on revisions because a legal battle over the rules could result in lengthy uncertainly for the industry. They also want changes in the rules to address lower gas prices and a shift in U.S. consumer preferences to larger, less fuel-efficient vehicles.

Federal law prohibits states from setting their own vehicle emissions rules, except for California, which can seek waivers to federal policy under the Clean Air Act. Other states can choose to adopt California's rules.

Julia Rege of Global Automakers, a group representing automakers including Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T> and Hyundai Motor Co <005380.KS>, said at the hearing that automakers need national rules, and urged U.S. regulators and California to "be as actively involved in the process as before, and work to keep the national program intact."

With just over six months before the 2025 rules must be finalized, there have been no vehicle emission talks between California, automakers and U.S. officials. The White House has held talks with automakers about the review in recent months, Reuters reported last month. [nL1N1KG0JS]

In June, New York state's attorney general, Eric Schneiderman, and 12 other top state law enforcement officials said they would mount a court challenge to any effort to roll back vehicle emission rules. [nL1N1J60VG]

United Auto Workers legislative director Josh Nassar said at the hearing that the national program should be continued to "prevent chaos, lawsuits, uncertainty."

The Obama administration's rules, negotiated with automakers in 2011, were aimed at doubling average fleet-wide fuel efficiency to about 50 miles (80 km) per gallon by 2025.

The Obama administration said the rules would save motorists $1.7 trillion in fuel costs over the life of the vehicles but cost the auto industry about $200 billion over 13 years.

A number of environmental advocates and retired military leaders at the hearing urged U.S. regulators not to weaken the standards.

Automakers want changes.

"To keep costs reasonable for buyers and maximize future production levels and fleet turnover, it is vital to clearly focus on consumer preferences and market realities," said Chris Nevers, an official with the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a trade group representing General Motors Co , Toyota, Volkswagen AG and others.

U.S. regulators disclosed earlier that they may revise fuel efficiency requirements starting with the 2021 model year, a year earlier than Trump announced in March.

Brazil auto output rises 15 pct in August from July - Reuters News

{{20170906T144637.317+0000}}Brazil auto output rises 15 pct in August from JulySAO PAULO, Sept 6 (Reuters) - Automobile production in Brazil rose 15.4 percent and sales climbed 17.2 percent in August from July, the national automakers' association said on Wednesday, boosted by two extra weekdays and recovering consumer demand.

Automakers in Brazil produced about 260,300 new cars and trucks last month, while sales totaled about 216,500 vehicles, according to data released by industry group Anfavea. Compared to a year ago, when a stoppage at Volkswagen AG weighed on the industry, auto output jumped 45.7 percent and sales rose 17.8 percent.

Brazil was one of the world's five biggest auto markets until its current recession and it remains a major base of operations for Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV , Volkswagen, General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co .

U.S. to unveil revised self-driving car guidelines -sources - Reuters News

{{20170905T213657.909+0000}}U.S. to unveil revised self-driving car guidelines -sourcesBy David Shepardson

WASHINGTON, Sept 5 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump's administration is set to unveil revised self-driving vehicle guidelines next week in Michigan, responding to automakers' calls for elimination of legal barriers to putting autonomous vehicles on the road, sources briefed on the matter said on Tuesday.

U.S. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao was expected to unveil the revised guidelines next Tuesday at a self-driving vehicle testing facility in Ann Arbor, Michigan, four people briefed on the matter said.

A spokesman for Chao did not immediately comment. The White House Office of Management and Budget approved the undisclosed Transportation Department changes to the guidelines on Aug. 31, according a posting on a government website.

On Wednesday, the U.S. House of Representatives will vote on a sweeping proposal to speed deployment of self-driving cars without human controls and bar states from blocking autonomous vehicles. The measure could help many automakers and tech companies keep their pledges of getting self-driving cars on the market by 2020 or 2021.

The House will vote on the bill under fast-track rules that allow no amendments. A bipartisan group of U.S. senators working on similar legislation has not introduced a bill.

The bill, passed unanimously by a House panel in July, would allow automakers to obtain exemptions to deploy up to 25,000 vehicles without meeting existing auto safety standards in the first year. Over three years, the cap would rise to 100,000 vehicles annually.

The House measure would require automakers to provide regulators with safety assessment reports proposed in the 2016 self-driving guidelines, but would not require pre-market approval of advanced vehicle technologies.

Consumer advocates have called for giving the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration quicker access to crash data and more funding to oversee self-driving cars.

Automakers and technology companies, including General Motors Co and Alphabet Inc's self-driving unit Waymo, have sought easier federal rules for self-driving technology, while some consumer groups have pushed for more safeguards.

The Obama administration issued guidelines for self-driving cars in September 2016, calling on automakers to voluntarily submit details of self-driving vehicle systems in a 15-point "safety assessment" and urging states to defer to the federal government on most vehicle regulations.

Automakers raised numerous concerns about the Obama administration guidance, including the suggestion that automakers should submit systems to regulators for review before putting them on the market.

Companies including Waymo, GM, Ford Motor Co , Uber Technologies Inc , Tesla Inc and others are aggressively pursuing automated vehicle technologies.

UPDATE 1-Canada's August auto sales up 6.9 percent - Reuters News

{{20170905T201932.401+0000}}UPDATE 1-Canada's August auto sales up 6.9 percent(Adds details, background)

Sept 5 (Reuters) - Canadian auto sales rose 6.9 percent in August, according to data released on Tuesday, as the industry benefited from a robust economy and rising consumer confidence.

In a strong finish to the summer, about 183,945 units were sold last month in the country, a report from Global Automakers of Canada showed.

That number raises the year-to-date total units sold to 1.40 million, a gain of 5.3 percent from a year earlier, according to Canadian automotive research firm DesRosiers.(http://bit.ly/2wEzGkR)

"August was another tremendous month for the automotive industry generally," GAC President David Adams wrote in the report.

"Unless we hit some unexpected economic turbulence, it seems reasonable that Canada will achieve another new sales record in 2017."

In contrast, automakers reported a 1.9 percent fall in U.S. sales in August. [nL4N1LI4TT]

Auto sales typically track macro indicators such as employment and economic growth. Canada's economy grew at its best pace in nearly six years in the second quarter helped by robust consumer spending and strong energy exports. [nL2N1LF1VU]

Sales of trucks, which tend to rise when the economy is growing, made for 68 percent of overall sales, according to GAC's report.

General Motors Co said Canadian vehicle sales rose 28.5 percent in August from a year earlier, the eighth straight monthly increase.

The company has so far this year sold 205,329 vehicles in the region, up 18 percent. (http://bit.ly/2w2GneR)

Ford said it sold 2,299 units in August, which was a 5.8 percent decline from a year earlier.

Fiat Chrysler Automobiles , , maker of Dodge and Chrysler vehicles, posted a 9 percent drop in Canadian sales in the month. They had declined 3 percent in July. [nL1N1KN22V]

UPDATE 1-UK car sales fall again in August - Reuters News

{{20170905T084753.235+0000}}UPDATE 1-UK car sales fall again in August(Adds details, background)

By Costas Pitas

LONDON, Sept 5 (Reuters) - British new car sales fell for the fifth month in a row in August, the longest run of declines since 2011, a car industry body said on Tuesday, as uncertainty over Brexit and possible levies on diesel cars hit Europe's second-biggest market.

Sales fell by an annual 6.4 percent to 76,433 vehicles, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), with demand among businesses and individuals both slumping.

Diesel car registrations fell by 21.3 percent, whilst petrol sales rose 3.8 percent in a further sign that uncertainty over possible government-imposed penalties on the most polluting vehicles is putting off buyers.

But SMMT Chief Executive Mike Hawes said he expected demand to remain strong in September, which accounts for some 15 percent of annual sales as it is one of only two occasions each year when a new licence plate series is introduced to indicate the age of a vehicle.

"With the new 67-plate now available and a range of new models in showrooms, we anticipate the continuation of what are historically high levels of demand," Hawes said.

Several carmakers, representing around three-quarters of the market, have launched trade-in and scrappage schemes in recent weeks which should help to support the September selling month. [nL8N1LI1EF]

The SMMT expects full-year registrations to end the year down nearly 4 percent at 2.59 million units from 2.69 million in 2016, which was a record high.

UPDATE 4-Automaker shares rise as Texans must replace drowned cars - Reuters News

{{20170901T194422.435+0000}}UPDATE 4-Automaker shares rise as Texans must replace drowned cars(Adds seasonally adjusted annualized selling rate)

By Joseph White and Ankit Ajmera

DETROIT, Sept 1 (Reuters) - Shares of the Big Three Detroit automakers rose on Friday despite lackluster August sales, with investors focusing on a likely surge in demand as residents of the U.S. Gulf Coast replace flood-damaged cars and trucks.

Overall U.S. car and light truck sales fell in August to a seasonally adjusted annual selling pace of 16.03 million vehicles, according to WardsAuto, down from a 17.13 million vehicle pace a year ago. U.S. auto sales have been slowing for much of the year.

Still, analysts focused on the potential for Detroit automakers to cut inventories and stabilize used vehicle prices as Gulf Coast residents must replace tens of thousands of vehicles ruined by flood damage. Hurricane Harvey slammed into Texas last week and the storm caused historic flooding in Houston, the fourth largest city in the United States.

Ford sales fell 2.1 percent in August. Mark LaNeve, Ford Motor Co's U.S. sales chief, told analysts that following Hurricane Katrina in 2005 "we saw a very dramatic snapback" in demand.

It was not clear how many vehicles in the Houston area will be scrapped, LaNeve said, saying he had seen estimates ranging from 200,000 to 400,000 to 1 million. Ford's Houston dealers may have lost fewer than 5,000 vehicles, he said.

Ford is the No. 1 automaker in the Houston market with 18 percent share, according to IHS Markit. The company plans to ship used vehicles to Houston dealers, and has "every indication we would have to add some production" of new vehicles to meet demand, LaNeve said.

Investor concerns about inventories of unsold vehicles and falling used car prices have weighed on Detroit automakers' shares most of this year. Now, automakers can anticipate a jolt of demand from a big market that is a stronghold for Detroit brand trucks and SUVs.

"It's got to be a positive for the industry," LaNeve said.

Investors appeared to agree. General Motors Co shares rose as much as 3.3 percent to their highest since early March, and were trading up 2.9 percent ahead of the close at $37.60. Ford was up 3.3 percent at $11.39 and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV 's U.S.-traded shares were up nearly 5.2 percent $15.90, hitting their highest in more than five years. The Detroit automakers posted mixed August U.S. sales, with GM up 7.5 percent and Ford and Fiat Chrysler down. Japanese automaker Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T> improved sales by nearly 7 percent, Honda Motor Co's <7267.T> sales fell 2.4 percent.

GM got a lift from robust sales of crossovers across its four brands. The largest U.S. automaker by sales plans to move used vehicles into Houston, and expressed confidence it can reduce inventories to 850,000 or fewer vehicles by year end.

Big auto dealership chains also intend to move vehicles to Houston from other markets as residents get insurance checks for drowned cars. [nL2N1LH1HH]

"Hurricane Harvey did have an adverse effect on deliveries during the last week of August for every automaker but the key U.S. economic fundamentals remain supportive of strong vehicle sales," GM Chief Economist Mustafa Mohatarem said in a statement.

Fiat Chrysler's U.S. vehicle sales fell 11 percent to 176,033 units. The company partly citing a planned 23 percent cut in sales to rental car companies. [nPn25XpFna]

U.S. consumers kept migrating toward sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks. Toyota sold more than 43,000 redesigned RAV4 compact SUVs, up nearly 26 percent from a year ago. The RAV4 has displaced the Camry sedan as Toyota's best-selling vehicle year to date.

Volvo shares jump on truck maker's new margin target - Reuters News

{{20170901T121940.518+0000}}Volvo shares jump on truck maker's new margin targetSTOCKHOLM, Sept 1 (Reuters) - Shares in truck maker Volvo jumped more than 7 percent on Friday after the Swedish firm targeted the highest level of profitability since the sale of its car making arm to Ford nearly two decades ago.

Volvo, which competes with Germany's Daimler and Volkswagen , said late on Thursday that it will target an average operating margin above 10 percent over a business cycle.

The company has gone through years of restructuring and heavy cost cuts, which have led to a clear profitability boost over the past year.

Its double-digit margin target compares with an analysts' forecast for an operating margin of 9.7 percent in 2019, according to Thomson Reuters SmartEstimate. [nL5N1KA0L4]

"We are still in a strong part of the trucks cycle, which means that we should see further improvements from current levels," Handelsbanken Capital Market analyst Hampus Engellau said.

"And if the group is still not on the average today, the market concludes that we could have 1-2 years of continued structural improvements, reaching double-digit margins, possibly up towards 11-12 percent."

Shares in Volvo rose as much as 7.6 percent and were up 7.2 percent by 1215 GMT, taking their year-to-date gain to 37 percent as investors have been impressed by strong orders and improving margins.

Volvo said in a statement after the market close on Thursday it was now "in a phase where focus is on organic growth and improved profitability through continuous improvement and innovation."

The company's adjusted operating margin in the first half of this year was 9.4 percent, it said in July, up from 7 percent a year earlier.

Over the past 10 years, excluding a loss-making 2009 in the wake of the financial crisis, it has averaged an annual operating margin of around 6 percent.

Volvo previously had a profitability target where its different businesses, which include construction equipment and buses, were benchmarked annually against competitors.

"A clear and straightforward operating margin target supports the efforts to drive performance across the group," Volvo said in its statement.

Danske Bank said the new targets were "very bullish" and likely to boost consensus earnings estimates as well as dividend estimates.

* BHP, Rio Tinto, Glencore back from commodities crash

* But investors eye payouts, debt cuts, safety - all at once

* Asset sales key for incoming BHP chairman MacKenzie

* BHP shale exit shows tightrope miners now face

By James Regan and Barbara Lewis

SYDNEY/LONDON, Aug 31 (Reuters) - Global mining heads may have thought they'd seen it all in the last five years, navigating a recovery after a commodities boom turned to bust. As the cycle turns, it brings a new challenge: tackling growth in an industry still scarred by its excesses.

It comes just in time for Ken MacKenzie, who starts as chairman of BHP , the world's biggest miner, on Sept. 1. Like peers Rio Tinto and Glencore , BHP has just racked up its best profit and cash flow in years on rising global demand for staples likes iron ore and coal. [nL4N1L75D4]

But this time, amid the cash piles, investors are reminding miners of messy mega-deals that cost previous executives their jobs. With activists like Elliott Management in their ranks, those investors want miners to balance investment in new and existing deposits with decent dividends, and a pledge to keep debt under control.

"Greater returns are warranted to some degree, and it's what everyone ultimately wants," said Bennelong Australian Equity Partners manager Julian Beaumont, who manages shares in BHP. "But at the same time there has to be discipline with enough capital available to grow and control debt."

Sober investment may be familiar territory for MacKenzie, a 53-year-old Canadian veteran of the packaging industry, who was hired in June to succeed former Ford Motor Co head Jac Nasser.

But close scrutiny of how he, BHP Chief Executive Andrew Mackenzie (no relation) and their peers at Rio and Glencore spend profits will be a test in mining's brave - lean - new world.

BHP, Rio and Glencore declined Reuters' requests for comment for this story.

DEBT FOCUS

Just a few years ago, with China's economy surging, miners went on a buying spree: the high water mark was Rio's acquisition of aluminium producer Alcan for $38 billion. About the same time, former BHP CEO Marius Kloppers was lining up an $80 billion spending budget.

Now, investors want cleaner balance sheets. Big projects are necessary - reserves must be replenished and are ever tougher to find. But ambitious ones like BHP's Jansen potash mine in Canada need to be tackled with partners - hence efforts to sell a $2 billion stake. [nL2N1LB15T]

"Commodities prices have helped with cash and we're seeing dividends, but things can turn very quickly, so I'd expect to see some prudence on their part," said Jason Beddow, chief executive at Argo Investments, which holds BHP and Rio shares. "I'd like to see them focus on paying down debt.

BHP's MacKenzie held around 100 meetings with shareholders, including Elliott, to sound out concerns before his official start as chairman, BHP has said.

In August Elliott became the second-biggest investor in BHP's London-listed arm, giving the fund the power to propose resolutions seeking board changes. Pressure from activists to shake up boardrooms cost the scalps of two BHP directors last week, both with long careers in oil and gas. [nL4N1L91QA]

Elliott declined Reuters' requests for comment for this article.

THE HARDEST LINE

The first in deep trouble when things went sour, Rio was also the quickest to recover.

Of the big three, Rio's shares are performing closest to benchmark indices and it now has the strongest balance sheet of the majors - something CEO Jean-Sebastien Jacques, appointed in July 2016, insists he will nurture with conservative targets on capital expenditure.

A number of fund managers contacted by Reuters for this article said Glencore had taken the hardest line in resisting richer payouts for investors. Glencore declared a flat first-half dividend, despite generating $2.5 billion in profits from higher coal, copper and other commodity prices.

Unlike the other mining bosses, Glencore's CEO Ivan Glasenberg is a major shareholder - but also one of the few remaining executives with a track record of opportunistic deals. For now, Glasenberg says his priority is keeping an investment grade rating by limiting debt and boosting returns. [nL5N1KM2XJ]

'IS THAT SMART?'

A key indicator for how miners handle the new investor ambience will be how BHP deals with its $20 billion foray into shale deposits in the United States, an asset bought a half-decade ago in a world of high oil prices. BHP is alone among the big three with assets in this field.

Widely diverging views on how BHP should handle this show how tough it may be to keep investors happy.

At the prodding of investors triggered by Elliott, BHP said in August the business was now under review and may be sold, at the right price. But with oil trading below $50 a barrel, sector consultants Rystad Energy estimated the division is worth only $5.1 billion.

"BHP wants to sell shale at the bottom of the cycle," said Ben Clark, a fund manager for TMS Capital who manages Rio shares, adding shareholders would see returns battered.

"Is that smart?"

RPT-ANALYSIS-Mining's new normal: Tackling growth in the shadow of austerity - 路透新闻

{{20170831T210000.000+0000}}RPT-ANALYSIS-Mining's new normal: Tackling growth in the shadow of austeritySYDNEY/LONDON, Aug 31 (Reuters)

(Repeats story published Aug. 31, no changes in text)

* BHP, Rio Tinto, Glencore back from commodities crash

* But investors eye payouts, debt cuts, safety - all at once

By James Regan and Barbara Lewis

SYDNEY/LONDON, Aug 31 (Reuters) - Global mining heads may have thought they'd seen it all in the last five years, navigating a recovery after a commodities boom turned to bust. As the cycle turns, it brings a new challenge: tackling growth in an industry still scarred by its excesses.

It comes just in time for Ken MacKenzie, who starts as chairman of BHP , the world's biggest miner, on Sept. 1. Like peers Rio Tinto and Glencore , BHP has just racked up its best profit and cash flow in years on rising global demand for staples likes iron ore and coal. [nL4N1L75D4]

But this time, amid the cash piles, investors are reminding miners of messy mega-deals that cost previous executives their jobs. With activists like Elliott Management in their ranks, those investors want miners to balance investment in new and existing deposits with decent dividends, and a pledge to keep debt under control.

"Greater returns are warranted to some degree, and it's what everyone ultimately wants," said Bennelong Australian Equity Partners manager Julian Beaumont, who manages shares in BHP. "But at the same time there has to be discipline with enough capital available to grow and control debt."

Sober investment may be familiar territory for MacKenzie, a 53-year-old Canadian veteran of the packaging industry, who was hired in June to succeed former Ford Motor Co head Jac Nasser.

But close scrutiny of how he, BHP Chief Executive Andrew Mackenzie (no relation) and their peers at Rio and Glencore spend profits will be a test in mining's brave - lean - new world.

BHP, Rio and Glencore declined Reuters' requests for comment for this story.

DEBT FOCUS

Just a few years ago, with China's economy surging, miners went on a buying spree: the high water mark was Rio's acquisition of aluminium producer Alcan for $38 billion. About the same time, former BHP CEO Marius Kloppers was lining up an $80 billion spending budget.

Now, investors want cleaner balance sheets. Big projects are necessary - reserves must be replenished and are ever tougher to find. But ambitious ones like BHP's Jansen potash mine in Canada need to be tackled with partners - hence efforts to sell a $2 billion stake. [nL2N1LB15T]

"Commodities prices have helped with cash and we're seeing dividends, but things can turn very quickly, so I'd expect to see some prudence on their part," said Jason Beddow, chief executive at Argo Investments, which holds BHP and Rio shares. "I'd like to see them focus on paying down debt.

BHP's MacKenzie held around 100 meetings with shareholders, including Elliott, to sound out concerns before his official start as chairman, BHP has said.

In August Elliott became the second-biggest investor in BHP's London-listed arm, giving the fund the power to propose resolutions seeking board changes.

UPDATE 1-Car makers, retailers rush to open, restock Houston after Harvey - Reuters News

{{20170831T175625.335+0000}}UPDATE 1-Car makers, retailers rush to open, restock Houston after Harvey(Adds stock action for automakers, retailers)

By Nick Carey

DETROIT, Aug 31 (Reuters) - Houston area car retailers and automakers are rushing to reopen dealerships and beef up inventory to replace many thousands of vehicles damaged in flooding from Hurricane Harvey.

Pete DeLongchamps, vice president for manufacturer relations at Group 1 Automotive Inc , the third-largest U.S. auto dealer group, said the company prepared for the storm with a plan designed after Hurricane Katrina in 2005. This included moving moved inventory to higher ground and cleaning roof drains to avoid cave-ins.

Group 1 thus lost a "relatively small percentage" of inventory and reopened its roughly 25 dealerships in the Houston and Beaumont area by Thursday.

"Things have been moving fast and furious with a large number of tow-ins already," DeLongchamps said. "Our customers have lost a lot of vehicles we need to help them replace."

Harvey brought record flooding to Houston and killed at least 35 people. The storm is expected to briefly depress already slowing U.S. auto sales but could eventually help boost demand as damaged cars are replaced. Automakers report U.S. August sales on Friday. [nL2N1LF1FR]

Estimates for the number of Harvey-damaged vehicles needing replacement range up to 500,000.

By Thursday AutoNation Inc , the largest U.S. auto retail chain, had reopened its 17 Houston stores and is moving cars and trucks from other regions, company spokesman Marc Cannon said.

The company plans to move 500 to 1,000 used cars to an AutoNation USA used car store and stage a sale Sept 21-23, when many would-be buyers should have insurance checks to replace destroyed vehicles, Cannon said.

AutoNation is still assessing how many vehicles it lost, but it too moved vehicles to higher ground ahead of the storm.

General Motors Co spokesman Jim Cain said the number of damaged vehicles at dealerships "is relatively modest."

"But there are still several dealerships that are inaccessible, so the number will increase," he said. GM will move new and used vehicles to Houston, "but it won't be done until the infrastructure and our dealers are ready."

Ford Motor Co is still assessing damage and inventory needs, a spokeswoman said.

CarMax Inc , the biggest U.S. used car dealer, will reopen its six Houston area stores on Labor Day, spokeswoman Claire Hunter said. "We are mobilizing additional inventory to the region as we speak," Hunter said.

Paul Lips, chief operating officer at ADESA, a unit of KAR Auction Services Inc which with Manheim dominates the U.S. car auction industry, said Houston inventory is "dry and ready for sale."

"Once roads are clear and employees can return safely to work, we will reopen business as usual," he said.

Group 1's DeLongchamps said the high inventory levels that have been a concern for the U.S. auto industry this year amid slackening sales are now a positive.

As vehicles sell, the retailer plans to replenish inventory by drawing from surpluses at other dealers.

"We have one guy in our office here whose sole job is to match inventory to sales," in the Houston area, DeLongchamps said. "We call him the 'inventory czar.'"

In afternoon trading, AutoNation shares were up 4.5 percent, Group 1 was up 3.4 percent, while CarMax had risen 2 percent and KAR was up nearly 1 percent. GM shares were up 2 percent and Ford was up 1.2 percent.
