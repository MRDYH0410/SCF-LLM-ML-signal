Ford hires 400 engineers, mostly in Canada, as cars go high tech - 路透新闻

{{20170330T134002.462+0000}}Ford hires 400 engineers, mostly in Canada, as cars go high techSAN FRANCISCO, March 30 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co said on Thursday it was hiring 400 engineers, mostly in Canada, to work on connectivity software and hardware, part of a wider push to meet demand for more connected cars.

The 300 engineers in Canada and 100 in the United States will double the current size of the Detroit automaker's mobile connectivity engineering team. The company said it also plans to establish a new research and engineering center in Ottawa, Canada.

Connectivity is a key investment area for the auto industry as in-car technology catches up to that of smartphones. As more modems are built directly into cars, vehicles are able to access a richer array of digital services. Ford plans to equip 20 million cars with built-in modems in the next five years.

The new hires, many of whom are coming from BlackBerry Ltd's shuttered handset business, will work on infotainment, in-vehicle modems, gateway modules, handset integration, security, driver assist features and autonomous vehicles, Ford said.

The move by the Detroit carmaker underscores how many new jobs in the auto sector are for white-collar technology jobs related to connectivity, mobility or autonomous vehicles, versus traditional factory jobs.

Ford said on Tuesday it was investing $200 million for an advanced data center in Michigan to support advances in vehicle connectivity and future developments in autonomous vehicles.[nL2N1H50BR]

Rouble's rise eases pain for foreign carmakers in Russia - 路透新闻

{{20170330T101545.846+0000}}Rouble's rise eases pain for foreign carmakers in Russia* Stronger rouble reduces costs, supports dollar earnings

* Russian car sales seen growing 4 pct in 2017

* Russia is Europe's 5th biggest car market by sales

By Jack Stubbs and Gleb Stolyarov

MOSCOW, March 30 (Reuters) - Foreign carmakers in Russia are benefiting from a stronger, more stable rouble, which is reducing their costs and supporting earnings in dollar terms at a time when the once-booming local market is expected to return to growth after four tough years.

The companies, including German car group Volkswagen and Japan's Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T>, were some of the hardest hit by Russia's economic downturn, in which annual car sales more than halved from a 2012 peak of almost 3 million vehicles, and a sharp devaluation of the rouble raised prices for imported parts and sapped profits.

But Russian car sales are now forecast to grow by 4 percent in 2017, according to the Association of European Businesses lobby group.

Five of the world's biggest carmakers operating in Russia, which had a combined market share of around 38 percent last year, told Reuters the stronger rouble had improved their position in the country. This will help them to cope in a challenging and volatile market once seen overtaking Germany as Europe's biggest for automobiles.

"The rouble fluctuation is of course difficult in all directions. When it was shooting up or weakening like hell over the last few years we had difficulties ... we lost a lot of money there," Marcus Osegowitsch, head of Volkswagen's Russian business, said.

"Now of course the rouble is stronger again and we are managing. If it stays somewhere between 65 and 67 to the euro, this is fine for us."

The rouble has gained 8 percent against the dollar and 6 percent against the euro so far this year, supported by higher oil prices and Russia's nascent economic recovery. Year on year, the Russian currency is up almost 20 percent against the dollar. [nL5N1FA0YK]

General Motors quit Russia in 2015, partly due to the rouble devaluation, but industry analysts say those foreign players who have stuck out the crisis years could soon see their local operations return to profit.

"Foreign producers who suffered losses over the last two years now have the opportunity to return to profit thanks to the stronger rouble," VTB analyst Vladimir Bespalov said. "This could happen by late 2017 or early 2018."

Ford , which is enjoying an unexpected uptick in sales in Russia, has already lowered prices on four models produced by its joint-venture with local partner Sollers due to the rouble strengthening. [nL8N1FY5BD]

Competitors will similarly try to keep prices low, Bespalov said, in an effort to win back cautious buyers.

Representatives for Korean carmaker Kia Motors <000270.KS> and France's Renault , which owns a majority stake in Russia's top automaker Avtovaz along with its alliance partner Nissan <7201.T>, said the rouble's improved performance in 2017 was supporting sales and the market recovery.

"In the long term, the stronger rouble will positively affect our profitability," a Nissan spokesman said.

Avtovaz's production costs are less exposed to currency fluctuations than those of foreign carmakers, as the majority of its car components are produced domestically.

"In the last few months, the situation with the rouble rate has become more predictable, which has affected the behaviour of our clients," a Toyota spokeswoman said. "We are seeing a renewed readiness to buy a car."

Ford to announce Ontario engine program in boost to Canada automaking -sources - 路透新闻

{{20170330T000647.784+0000}}Ford to announce Ontario engine program in boost to Canada automaking -sourcesBy Allison Lampert and Nick Carey

MONTREAL, DETROIT March 29 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co will announce on Thursday production of a new engine in the Canadian province of Ontario, two sources familiar with the matter said, in an investment that would boost Canada's auto industry after years of job losses to Mexico and the United States.

The sources said the 7X engine, for large pickup trucks, is to be announced with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau at the Ford Essex Engine Plant in Windsor, Ontario, on Thursday morning.

It is part of the C$700 million ($525.05 million) in new investments secured during a 2016 agreement between Ford and its 7,000 unionized Canadian workers, the sources said. Investments in Windsor's two engine plants are expected to account for about C$600 million ($450.05 million). [nL1N1D41MC]

Spokesmen for Ford and Trudeau declined to comment.

Brian Maxim, a vice president at AutoForecast Solutions, said in a telephone interview that the 7.0-litre, V8 engine would have more torque and be more fuel efficient than the 6.8-litre V10 engine now built in Windsor and used in Ford's super- duty trucks, such as its F-250s.

Maxim said he expected Ford to produce about 125,000 units of the new engine per year, starting in 2019.

Ford's F-Series pickup trucks have been the best-selling model in the United States since 1982.

New investment in engine production in Canada was seen as vital because the large V8 and V10 motors now built by Ford in Windsor were expected to end production in four years.

Between 2001 and 2013, some 14,300 jobs were lost in vehicle manufacturing in Canada, according to Hamilton's Automotive Policy Research Centre. ($1 = 1.3332 Canadian dollars)

PREVIEW-BlackBerry, freed of handsets, looks to software for return to glory - 路透新闻

{{20170329T191713.813+0000}}PREVIEW-BlackBerry, freed of handsets, looks to software for return to gloryBy Alastair Sharp

TORONTO, March 29 (Reuters) - Although BlackBerry Ltd has extricated itself from the smartphone handsets that weighed on its recent fortunes, the Canadian firm faces a tough slog to convince skeptics it can return to its glory days through an enlarged software business.

The company, which will report fourth-quarter and full-year results on Friday, says it has no major gaps in its software portfolio, thanks to the integration of a string of recent acquisitions.

It concedes, however, that more work is needed to get those offerings into the healthcare and automotive industries and other sectors that it hopes will power future growth.

"The bottom line is: BlackBerry is a completely different beast than it was a decade ago," said Nicholas McQuire, a workplace IT analyst at CCS Insight, a consulting firm. "However, it still needs to educate enterprises, particularly prospects in markets outside its core regulated footprint on the 'new BlackBerry'," he said.

Investors are unsure how to value the company, waiting for guidance from Chief Executive Officer John Chen, who needs a late bump in sales to hit the 30 percent growth in software revenue BlackBerry targeted for its recently completed fiscal year.

BlackBerry's enterprise-value-to-forward-revenue ratio is 3.14, according to Thomson Reuters data, lower than the roughly 4.5 ratio enjoyed by Oracle Corp and Microsoft Corp , two of its closest peers now that Blackberry focuses on enterprise software.

The Waterloo, Ontario-based company is expected to barely break even in the fourth quarter and likely notch revenue of less than $1.4 billion in its fiscal year ended Feb. 28, 2017, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S estimates. At its peak, the smartphone pioneer was raking in more than $5.5 billion a quarter.

Blackberry's Toronto-listed shares were trading down 0.4 percent at C$9.40, while the benchmark Canadian share index <.GSPTSE> was up 0.3 percent.

BlackBerry declined to comment ahead of its earnings release.

The redesigned company has gone from selling its own phones with the servers and software that manage them for businesses and governments to securing an array of rival devices and the information that flows to and from them.

CYBER SECURITY, AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES

It is also targeting the burgeoning but fragmented market to connect sensors and other devices and has invested in other potentially high-growth areas including cyber security consulting and autonomous vehicles.

"It has pivoted in the right direction with some new and promising areas ahead of it, but these are nascent markets which will take time to materializes in its bottom line," McQuire said.

The company's 2015 purchases of Good Technology and WatchDox helped it secure a leading position in the enterprise mobility market, and its QNX industrial operating system is key to its self-driving vehicle ambitions. However, there is tough competition in these and other areas of interest.

"We have a no-moat rating for BlackBerry," said Ali Mogharabi, an analyst at Morningstar. "There's still a lot of uncertainty on how well they are going to progress in autonomous driving and other growth markets."

The company no longer has any responsibility for making or selling smartphones bearing its brand, after setting up late last year to take a cut on sales from the likes of Chinese smartphone maker TCL Communication, which will begin selling a BlackBerry-branded phone in April.

But given TCL is going to rely on the BlackBerry name to sell the KeyOne device, which it announced at a major technology conference last month, the separation may yet prove difficult.

Chen, who took over the helm of BlackBerry in late 2013, said in December the company would likely take another four or five quarters to halt the steady decline in its overall revenue, with software sales growth projected to slow to around 15 percent in the fiscal year that began in March.

"What would help is if these guys actually standardize the type of guidance and/or the detailed information they provide on their calls," Morningstar's Mogharabi said. "It's pretty tough to get a clear picture of where they are in the turnaround mode and the potential upside or downside going forward."

Ford says it will spend $295 million on two new recalls - 路透新闻

{{20170329T141804.564+0000}}Ford says it will spend $295 million on two new recallsBy David Shepardson

WASHINGTON, March 29 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co , the second largest U.S. automaker, on Wednesday announced two new recalls affecting 440,000 vehicles and expects to spend about $295 million to fix the issues.

The recalls include 211,000 vehicles in North America to replace potentially faulty side door latches and 230,000 vehicles for under-hood fire risks. Ford said it has reports of 29 fires but no injuries.

Ford said the cost of the recalls were included in its updated earnings guidance issued last week.

Last week, Ford warned it expects lower earnings per share in the first quarter and lower pretax profit in 2017 due to higher spending on commodities, warranties and investments and a drop in sales volumes especially fleet sales. [nL2N1H00MR]

The Dearborn automaker had previously recalled nearly 4 million vehicles for door latch issues in six separate recalls since 2014, including 2.4 million vehicles recalled in late 2016. In September, Ford said it was taking a $640 million charge for its expanded side-door latch recalls.

The new door latch recall includes 211,000 2014 model year Ford Fiesta, 2013-14 Ford Fusion and 2013-14 Lincoln MKZ vehicles. Ford said it not aware of any crashes or injuries associated with this issue. The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said in 2015 it had 1,102 reports related to the problem and Ford said it had 10,883 warranty claims related to door latch failures. Some owners told NHTSA they used ropes or tape or seatbelts to restrain doors.

The under-hood fire recall covers 230,000 2013-15 Ford Escape, Ford Fiesta ST, Ford Fusion and Ford Transit Connect vehicles equipped with 1.6-liter GTDI engines in North America.

Ford said a lack of coolant circulation could cause an engine to overheat, resulting in a crack in the cylinder head, which could result in a pressurized oil leak and raise the risk of a fire.

In October, NHTSA opened a preliminary investigation into 440,000 Ford 2011-2013 Edge SUVs over door latch warning light issues. The agency said Wednesday it is closing its investigation without seeking a recall.

UPDATE 1-Firms demand EU deal ensures their survival as May triggers Brexit - 路透新闻

{{20170329T131253.786+0000}}UPDATE 1-Firms demand EU deal ensures their survival as May triggers Brexit(Adds BMW, easyJet, car industry body)

By Costas Pitas

LONDON, March 29 (Reuters) - Carmakers and airlines easyJet and Ryanair demanded Britain secure a Brexit deal which preserves their access to Europe, warning any barriers to trade could risk the future of car plants and ground flights between the UK and the continent.

No-deal in Brexit talks is not an option, Britain's car industry body said on Wednesday after Theresa May formally launched divorce proceedings from the European Union, saying tariffs would raise costs and hit consumers.

Ford , Britain's biggest automotive engine-maker and Rolls-Royce and Mini-maker BMW both warned that unfettered access to the European Union remained crucial.

"Any deal must include securing tariff-free trade with the wider Customs Union and not just the EU27, whilst retaining access to the best talent and resources," Ford of Europe president Jim Farley said.

"It also is critical that a transitional period is put in place to ensure that customers are not penalized and to maintain free trade."

Ford builds vans in Turkey, which is not part of the EU but is in the EU customs union, whilst BMW builds its Mini cars at a central English plant in Oxford and is due to decide by the end of the year where to build its electric models.

Irish airline Ryanair said flights between Britain and the European Union risk being suspended in 2019 if Britain does not prioritise a new aviation deal whilst rival easyJet said it wanted a straightforward bilateral aviation agreement. [nL9N1FH00K]

"There is a distinct possibility that there may be no flights between the UK and Europe for a period of time after March 2019," Ryanair's chief marketing officer Kenny Jacobs said on Wednesday.

Most international firms which publicly expressed an opinion ahead of last June's referendum backed Britain remaining in the European Union, fearful of extra costs, trade barriers and unpredictable currency swings.

May has said she will take Britain out of the European single market but will seek the best possible access to the European markets and establish better trade ties with other nations.

Since the Brexit vote, some firms have announced major investments in Britain with Facebook saying it would hire more staff and Google announcing a new flagship building in London. [L5N1H452I]

But airlines are among those concerned that trading conditions vital to their operations could be lost.

Britain will have to renegotiate access to the single aviation market, whereby airlines based in the EU have the right to fly to and from any country in the bloc or even within other member states.

German media conglomerate Bertelsmann said on Tuesday it may have to reconsider London as the base for its intellectual property operations.

"We have made an impact analysis," Chief Executive Thomas Rabe said.

"In about a year's time we will have to come to a decision, when the impact of the Brexit will become more clear."

{{20170329T111914.846+0000}}Firms stack up Brexit warnings as May triggers divorce talks By Costas Pitas

LONDON, March 29 (Reuters) - Ford and Ryanair warned on Wednesday of the risks of Brexit including disruption to flights and tariffs on cars which could hurt Britain and damage businesses, on the day the prime minister was launching divorce proceedings from the EU.

U.S. carmaker Ford, Britain's biggest automotive engine-maker, low-cost airline Ryanair and German media group Bertlesmann issued warnings as Britain began two years of formal EU talks.

Ford , a major beneficiary of free trade across the continent where it builds cars in Germany and vans in Turkey, warned that Theresa May must retain unfettered trade.

"Any deal must include securing tariff-free trade with the wider Customs Union and not just the EU27, whilst retaining access to the best talent and resources," Ford of Europe president Jim Farley said.

"It also is critical that a transitional period is put in place to ensure that customers are not penalized and to maintain free trade."

UPDATE 7-Tesla deal boosts Chinese presence in U.S. auto tech - 路透新闻

{{20170328T215445.847+0000}}UPDATE 7-Tesla deal boosts Chinese presence in U.S. auto tech(Adds analyst comment)

By Paul Lienert

DETROIT, March 28 (Reuters) - China's Tencent Holdings Ltd <0700.HK> has bought a 5 percent stake in U.S. electric car maker Tesla Inc for $1.78 billion, the latest investment by a Chinese internet company in the potentially lucrative market for self-driving vehicles and related services.

Tencent's investment, revealed in a U.S. regulatory filing, provides Tesla with a deep-pocketed ally as it prepares to launch its mass-market Model 3. Tesla's shares rose 2.7 percent to $277.45 on Tuesday, closing in on Ford Motor Co as the second-most-valuable U.S. auto company behind General Motors Co .

Tencent also could help the U.S. company sell - or even build - cars in China, the world's largest auto market, analysts said.

"It certainly is a strong chess move for Tesla," said Jeff Schuster, senior vice president of forecasting for researcher LMC Automotive, citing the cash infusion and "help in navigating the Chinese market."

Tesla Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk on Tuesday tweeted: "Glad to have Tencent as an investor and adviser to Tesla." Musk did not say what he meant by "adviser" but in a separate tweet he noted Tesla had "very few" Model 3 orders from China, where the car has not been formally introduced.

The midsize Model 3 is due to go on sale later this year in the United States.

The deal expands Tencent's presence in an emerging investment sector that includes self-driving electric cars, which could enable such new modes of transportation as automated ride-sharing and delivery services, as well as ancillary services ranging from infotainment to e-commerce.

Those new technologies, and their potential to create new business models and revenue streams in the global transportation sector, have attracted billions in investment from China's three tech giants - Tencent, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd and Baidu Inc .

In an investor note, Morgan Stanley auto analyst Adam Jonas said on Tuesday that he "would not be surprised" to see Tencent and Tesla collaborate in the development and deployment of some of those technologies.

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the Chinese investment in Tesla, but President Donald Trump has been critical of U.S. automakers and of China trade policies.

Founded in 1998 by entrepreneur Ma Huateng, Tencent is one of Asia's largest tech companies, best known for its WeChat mobile messaging app. With a market capitalization of about $275 billion, it is roughly six times the size of 14-year-old Tesla, whose $45 billion market cap on Tuesday was only $1 billion shy of 114-year-old Ford.

Tencent was an early investor in NextEV, a Shanghai-based electric vehicle startup that since has rebranded itself as Nio, with U.S. headquarters in San Jose, not far from Tesla's Palo Alto base. Tencent also has funded at least two other Chinese EV startups, including Future Mobility in Shenzhen.

In addition, Tencent has invested in Didi Chuxing, the world's second-largest ride services company behind Uber, and in Lyft, Uber's chief U.S. rival.

Baidu has invested in Nio, as well as in Uber and Velodyne, a California maker of laser-based lidar sensors for self-driving cars. Alibaba's mobility investments include Didi and Lyft.

As Tesla is doing, many of the start-up companies backed by Tencent, Baidu and Alibaba are developing self-driving systems that eventually could be introduced in commercial ride-sharing fleets in the United States and China after 2020.

Tencent maintains a U.S. office in Palo Alto, in the heart of California's Silicon Valley. Beijing-based Baidu and Hangzhou-based Alibaba also maintain offices in Silicon Valley.

Tencent owns about 8.2 million shares in Tesla, the carmaker said. It is the fifth-largest shareholder, behind Musk and investment companies Fidelity, Baillie Gifford and T. Rowe Price.(http://bit.ly/2nvNeMI)

To help fund Model 3 production, Tesla raised about $1.2 billion by selling common shares and convertible debt earlier this month. Tencent said its shares were acquired as part of the early March equity sale and on the open market.

Musk had a stake of about 21 percent as of Dec. 31. [nL3N1GU3T5]

UPDATE 5-Trump applauds Ford's previous planned investment in Michigan plants - 路透新闻

{{20170328T194643.701+0000}}UPDATE 5-Trump applauds Ford's previous planned investment in Michigan plants(Adds state incentives approved, stock price, details of data center)

By Nick Carey and Susan Heavey

DETROIT/WASHINGTON, March 28 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co on Tuesday said it would invest $1.2 billion in three Michigan facilities and create 130 jobs in projects largely in line with a previous agreement with the United Auto Workers union, hours after U.S. President Donald Trump touted a "major investment" by the automaker on Twitter.

In January, Ford scrapped plans to build a $1.6 billion car factory in Mexico and instead added 700 jobs in Michigan following Trumps criticism that centered on trade and investing in America. [nL1N1ET0V9]

Ford said on Tuesday it would spend $850 million on a planned upgrade of a plant in Wayne, Michigan, for the Ford Bronco, an SUV model, and the Ford Ranger - a mid-size pickup truck. The company will also invest $150 million and create 130 or retain jobs at an engine plant in Romeo.

Both projects were part of 2015 negotiations with the UAW, when Ford said it would invest $9 billion in U.S. plants over four years.

Ford also said it would invest $200 million in a data center in Flat Rock to support advances in vehicle connectivity and future developments in autonomous vehicles, but it will not result in any new hourly jobs.

The move comes at a time when U.S. new car and truck sales are at an all-time high and investors are watching closely for signs of a possible downturn in the highly-cyclical industry.

"We're optimistic that we'll continue to see good economic growth for the U.S. in the near term," Joe Hinrichs, president of the Americas at Ford, told Reuters. "We feel very confident about our plan and our products and about investing in Michigan and the U.S."

Separately, the Michigan Economic Development Corporation (MEDC) approved nearly $30 million in state incentives for Ford over 15 years at a meeting Tuesday. Ford will use the incentives to partially defray the costs of the improvements.

The MEDC noted that Ford had considered locating some of the jobs in Mexico, where it is cheaper to employ workers. "Incentive assistance was necessary to ensure the project moves forward in Michigan," the MEDC said.

The announcement by Ford on Tuesday comes less than two weeks after Trump visited Detroit to promise more auto jobs for Michigan and other Midwestern U.S. states. [nL2N1GS1B0]

Trump pounced on Ford's announcement before the company could release its plans on Tuesday.

"Major investment to be made in three Michigan plants," Trump posted on Twitter early Tuesday. "Car companies coming back to U.S. JOBS! JOBS! JOBS!"

Trump has at times promoted job announcements at the White House that had been previously planned or announced. Last week he praised an investment decision by Charter Communications Inc that the company announced before he was elected. [nL2N1H1106]

Steve Rattner, who was an automotive policy adviser under President Barack Obama, remarked on Twitter that Trump was misleading people about jobs, saying "the big news ended up being only 130 jobs in (Michigan) that were announced back in 2015."

Ford said last week it expected higher investments, as well as other spending, to weigh on 2017 earnings. [nL2N1H00MR]

U.S. sales of new cars and trucks hit a record high of 17.55 million units in 2016. On Friday, industry consultants J.D. Power and LMC Automotive maintained their 2017 sales forecast of 17.6 million vehicles, an increase of 0.2 percent from 2016. [nL2N1H10FZ]

But they said automakers' incentive spending in the United States in the first half of March had hit a record for the month, breaking the previously set mark in March 2009 during the height of the Great Recession.

On Monday, Moody's Investors service said it expected U.S. new vehicle sales to dip in 2017 and warned of a "significant credit risk" for auto lenders as competition for loans intensifies. [nL2N1H30BT]

Trump has focused on U.S. automotive jobs, meeting with company executives as well as pressuring - and praising - them on Twitter. Executives have also said they hope his administration will pursue tax and regulatory policies that would benefit U.S. manufacturers. [nL1N1EZ1CP]

Trump has repeatedly suggested automakers will build new plants in the United States, but no company has plans to do so.

In late trading Tuesday, Ford shares were up 2.1 percent at $11.69.

Trump touts expected Ford announcement on plant investments - 路透新闻

{{20170328T105845.054+0000}}Trump touts expected Ford announcement on plant investmentsWASHINGTON, March 28 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump touted Ford Motor Co's expected announcement later on Tuesday about investments and jobs at its U.S. plants, saying the automaker would be making a major investment in three Michigan facilities.

Trump said in a tweet that the anticipated announcement showed "car companies coming back to U.S. JOBS!JOBS!JOBS!" It was not immediately clear, though, whether Ford was taking new steps or acting on previously planned or announced investments.

Trump's auto review may only slow march to better fuel efficiency - 路透新闻

{{20170323T213756.313+0000}}Trump's auto review may only slow march to better fuel efficiencyBy Nick Carey and Paul Lienert

DETROIT, March 23 (Reuters) - When U.S. President Donald Trump announced a review last week of tough Obama-era vehicle emissions and fuel-efficiency standards, he proclaimed that the "assault on the American auto industry is over."

But rules set by the Environmental Protection Agency may take a backseat to consumers demanding vehicles that guzzle less gas and automakers having to meet tougher standards if they want to export cars overseas, according to auto industry analysts.

In the end, U.S. carmakers may just gain a few more years to meet the more stringent targets that former President Barack Obama's administration negotiated with the companies in 2012, analysts said.

If Europe and China continue to toughen their emissions standards, "the U.S. might become an outlier," American Axle President Mike Simonte told Reuters on Thursday.

Trump's move was widely seen leading to a rollback or loosening of more stringent targets, which would slash vehicle exhaust emissions while effectively doubling average fuel economy to 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025.

Automakers have argued the rules for 2022-2025 are too expensive and could cost American jobs, so the Trump administration's review was seen as a win for them. [nL2N1GS1B0]

On a conference call Thursday with investors, Bob Shanks, Ford Motor Co's chief financial officer, said, "We are not seeking a rollback in any way. We just want to have a conversation around the levels we want to achieve."

Despite what the EPA may want, California and nine other states in the Zero Emission Vehicle program — eight in the northeast, plus Oregon — are expected to move ahead on Friday with the previously established targets. [nL2N1GS2KH]

Those states account for nearly 30 percent of U.S. auto sales.

The potential divide with the rest of the country could create a "two-tiered environment with two sets of regulations," said Mark Wakefield, managing director of AlixPartners' automotive practice. This "could drive costs higher if automakers have to build two versions of the same vehicle to meet the two different standards."

The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a trade group that sued to overturn the Obama-era rules on behalf of several big automakers, wrote the White House on Thursday urging talks to begin quickly with California to ensure that national standards remain in place.

"Automakers seek certainty, predictability and rationality – over time – from the regulatory process," the group's CEO Mitch Bainwol wrote. "EPA A DISTANT THIRD"

Kristin Dziczek, director of the Center for Automotive Research's labor and industry group, said U.S. automakers could find it hard to export cars to markets such as China and Europe with tougher regulatory regimes if the U.S. targets were rescinded.

"I don't think we're going to see a rollback," she said. "At most, I think we may see a slowing of the timetable" for implementing the tougher standards.

AlixPartners' Wakefield said if China, the world's largest market, continues pushing electric vehicles while America backpedals, it could lead to "some movement of investment from the U.S. to China, especially as the latter market continues to grow."

General Motors Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV referred Reuters to public comments made by the industry's lobbying group, the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers.

EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, a climate change skeptic, said the Obama administration estimated it would cost $200 billion over 13 years to comply with stricter standards, which he believes will lead to higher prices for consumers and jobs leaving the country.

Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas said the auto industry expected to miss the 2022-2025 targets regardless of who occupied the White House, but he believes the EPA's recent move may carry relatively little weight.

"Of all the things that are likely to drive fuel economy, I would rank the EPA a distant third on the list, behind consumer preferences and the direction of technology," he said.

United Auto Workers union President Dennis Williams said while around 60 percent of U.S. auto sales are currently trucks and SUVs, consumers value fuel-economy improvements for those vehicles.

"The automakers shouldn't make the mistake of sliding backward," Williams said. "We're here to protect our (union) members, but we understand that in doing so we also have to look at the future."

UPDATE 3-Higher investments, sales drop to weigh on Ford Q1 earnings - 路透新闻

{{20170323T152359.087+0000}}UPDATE 3-Higher investments, sales drop to weigh on Ford Q1 earnings(Adds CFO comments, background, Ford Credit profit forecast, updates stock price)

By Nick Carey

DETROIT, March 23 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co said on Thursday it expects lower earnings per share in the first quarter and lower pretax profit in 2017 due to higher spending on commodities, warranties and investments and a drop in sales volumes especially fleet sales.

Ford shares were down nearly 1 percent at $11.66 in late morning trading after the announcement, which preceded an investor presentation by the company's chief financial officer, Bob Shanks.

The presentation comes as the U.S. auto industry continues to see cars lose market share to trucks and SUVs, as low fuel prices have encouraged consumers to opt for larger vehicles that have become more fuel efficient in recent years.

"We think we can do more with trucks, we think we can do more with utility vehicles, we can do more with performance and we've got plans in place to do that," Shanks said. "We think this can lead to an even stronger position for us in the years ahead."

Ford said U.S. auto industry sales in 2017 should dip slightly to 17.7 million units, down from a record of 17.9 million in 2016. The company said sales should hit 17.5 million in 2018.

After a strong run in sales since emerging from the Great Recession earlier this decade, investors are watching to see whether the current boom cycle is losing steam.

Ford said it expects auto sales in China, the world's largest car market, to dip to 27.2 million this year from 27.5 million in 2016.

"We believe Ford's announcement today is the initial confirmation of our investment thesis that pricing is deteriorating in North America and in select international markets, particularly China," Buckingham Research Group analyst Joseph Amaturo wrote in a client note.

This will "cause earnings and cash flow for Ford and GM to deteriorate and fall short of investor expectations and more importantly company guidance," he wrote.

CFO Shanks said despite the expected dip in industry sales, "we're very comfortable that our overall business will improve."

Ford said it expects to earn between 30 cents and 35 cents per share in the first quarter. Analysts, on average, have expected earnings per share of 47 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

The company said its pretax profit forecast for 2017 was unchanged at $9 billion, against $10.4 billion in 2016, "driven by our planned investments in emerging opportunities, and to improve in 2018."

The company also maintained its forecast for a pretax profit of about $1.5 billion for Ford Credit, its financial services arm, in 2017 and said that profit would improve in 2018.

Analysts expect Ford to post pretax profit of $9.2 billion.

Ford said as of February it had 79 days of gross supply of vehicles on hand, down from 84 days of inventory a year earlier.

The company said it expects first quarter earnings per share of 30-35 cents, lower than what it earned a year earlier, blaming higher costs, lower volume and unfavorable exchange.

UK car production hit 17-year high in February - 路透新闻

{{20170323T000107.861+0000}}UK car production hit 17-year high in FebruaryLONDON, March 23 (Reuters) - British car production hit a 17-year high in February, extending a recent trend of surging output as a strong rise in exports once again compensated for a slump in demand at home, an industry body said on Thursday.

Overall production rose 8 percent to 153,041 cars last month, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), boosted by a 13 percent increase in sales to overseas markets.

The roughly 15 percent fall in the pound against the euro since the Brexit vote has helped to make British exports cheaper to many foreign buyers, although it has increased the cost of importing parts from the continent for UK-assembled models.

Britain's overwhelmingly foreign-owned car industry backed remaining in the European Union and is worried about the possible end to tariff-free business with Europe, its biggest export market, despite reassurances from Prime Minister Theresa May.

"We must avoid barriers to trade, whether tariff, customs or other regulatory obstacles, at all costs," said SMMT Chief Executive Mike Hawes.

"To do otherwise would damage our competitiveness and threaten the continued success of UK automotive manufacturing," he added.

UPDATE 3-Higher investments, sales drop to weigh on Ford Q1 earnings - 路透新闻

{{20170323T152359.087+0000}}UPDATE 3-Higher investments, sales drop to weigh on Ford Q1 earnings(Adds CFO comments, background, Ford Credit profit forecast, updates stock price)

By Nick Carey

DETROIT, March 23 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co said on Thursday it expects lower earnings per share in the first quarter and lower pretax profit in 2017 due to higher spending on commodities, warranties and investments and a drop in sales volumes especially fleet sales.

Ford shares were down nearly 1 percent at $11.66 in late morning trading after the announcement, which preceded an investor presentation by the company's chief financial officer, Bob Shanks.

The presentation comes as the U.S. auto industry continues to see cars lose market share to trucks and SUVs, as low fuel prices have encouraged consumers to opt for larger vehicles that have become more fuel efficient in recent years.

"We think we can do more with trucks, we think we can do more with utility vehicles, we can do more with performance and we've got plans in place to do that," Shanks said. "We think this can lead to an even stronger position for us in the years ahead."

Ford said U.S. auto industry sales in 2017 should dip slightly to 17.7 million units, down from a record of 17.9 million in 2016. The company said sales should hit 17.5 million in 2018.

After a strong run in sales since emerging from the Great Recession earlier this decade, investors are watching to see whether the current boom cycle is losing steam.

Ford said it expects auto sales in China, the world's largest car market, to dip to 27.2 million this year from 27.5 million in 2016.

"We believe Ford's announcement today is the initial confirmation of our investment thesis that pricing is deteriorating in North America and in select international markets, particularly China," Buckingham Research Group analyst Joseph Amaturo wrote in a client note.

This will "cause earnings and cash flow for Ford and GM to deteriorate and fall short of investor expectations and more importantly company guidance," he wrote.

CFO Shanks said despite the expected dip in industry sales, "we're very comfortable that our overall business will improve."

Ford said it expects to earn between 30 cents and 35 cents per share in the first quarter. Analysts, on average, have expected earnings per share of 47 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

The company said its pretax profit forecast for 2017 was unchanged at $9 billion, against $10.4 billion in 2016, "driven by our planned investments in emerging opportunities, and to improve in 2018."

The company also maintained its forecast for a pretax profit of about $1.5 billion for Ford Credit, its financial services arm, in 2017 and said that profit would improve in 2018.

Analysts expect Ford to post pretax profit of $9.2 billion.

Ford said as of February it had 79 days of gross supply of vehicles on hand, down from 84 days of inventory a year earlier.

{{20170323T000107.861+0000}}UK car production hit 17-year high in FebruaryLONDON, March 23 (Reuters) - British car production hit a 17-year high in February, extending a recent trend of surging output as a strong rise in exports once again compensated for a slump in demand at home, an industry body said on Thursday.

Overall production rose 8 percent to 153,041 cars last month, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), boosted by a 13 percent increase in sales to overseas markets.

The roughly 15 percent fall in the pound against the euro since the Brexit vote has helped to make British exports cheaper to many foreign buyers, although it has increased the cost of importing parts from the continent for UK-assembled models.

Britain's overwhelmingly foreign-owned car industry backed remaining in the European Union and is worried about the possible end to tariff-free business with Europe, its biggest export market, despite reassurances from Prime Minister Theresa May.

"We must avoid barriers to trade, whether tariff, customs or other regulatory obstacles, at all costs," said SMMT Chief Executive Mike Hawes.

"To do otherwise would damage our competitiveness and threaten the continued success of UK automotive manufacturing," he added.

REFILE-Car industry players diverge on timescale for self-driving cars - 路透新闻

{{20170316T185852.766+0000}}REFILE-Car industry players diverge on timescale for self-driving cars(Fixes spelling of CEO's name in paragraph 3 to Jen-Hsun Huang from Jens-Hsun Huang)

* Nvidia predicts carmakers will speed up self-driving push

* Bosch says progress could be several years slower

* Self-driving industry shaken up by Intel's Mobileye buy

By Georgina Prodhan

BERLIN, March 16 (Reuters) - Carmakers and suppliers gave widely differing timelines for the introduction of self-driving vehicles on Thursday, showing the uncertainties surrounding the technology as well as a split between cautious established players and bullish new entrants.

Chipmaker Nvidia , facing direct competition with the world's top chipmaker after Intel's $15 billion deal to buy autonomous driving technology firm Mobileye this week, gave the most optimistic predictions.

Chief Executive Jen-Hsun Huang forecast carmakers may speed up their plans in the light of technological advances and that fully self-driving cars could be on the road by 2025.

"Because of deep learning, because of AI (artificial intelligence) computing, we've really supercharged our roadmap to autonomous vehicles," he said in a keynote speech to the Bosch Connected World conference in Berlin.

Germany's Bosch [ROBG.UL], however, the world's biggest automotive supplier, gave a timetable as much as six years longer to get to the final stage before fully autonomous vehicles, and declined even to forecast when a totally self-driving car might take to the streets.

Progress is fraught by issues including who is liable when a self-driving car has an accident, bringing down the costs of sensor technology and guarding against hacking.

"Of course, we still have to prove that an autonomous car does better in driving and has less accidents than a human being," Bosch CEO Volkmar Denner told a news conference.

Nvidia has applied its market-leading expertise in high-end computer graphics to the intense visualisation and simulation needs of autonomous cars, and has been working on artificial intelligence - teaching computers to learn to write their own software code - for a decade.

"No human could write enough code to capture the vast diversity and complexity that we do so easily, called driving," said Huang.

Together with Bosch executives, Huang presented a prototype AI on-board computer that is expected to go into production by the beginning of the next decade. The computer will use Nvidia's processing power to interpret data gathered by Bosch sensors.

DEGREES OF AUTONOMY

On the way to fully self-driving cars, levels of autonomy have been defined, with most cars on the road today at level two and Tesla ready to switch from level four to five - full autonomy - as soon as it is permitted to do so.

Level three means drivers can turn away in well-understood environments such as motorway driving but must be ready to take back control, while level four means the automated system can control the vehicle in most environments.

Independent technology analyst Richard Windsor wrote in a note this week he doubted automakers would have autonomous vehicles leaving factories by a typical self-imposed deadline of 2020, mainly because the liability issue was unresolved.

"This is good news for the automotive industry which is notoriously slow to adapt to and implement new technology as it will have more time to defend its position against the new entrants," he wrote.

But Nvidia's Huang said he expected to have chips available for level three automated driving by the end of this year and in customers' cars on the road by the end of 2018, with level four chips following the same pattern a year later.

That is at least a year ahead of the plans of most carmakers that have an autonomous-driving strategy.

The head of autonomous driving at BMW told the conference the luxury carmaker was on its way to deliver a level three autonomous car in 2021, but could produce level four or five autonomous cars in the same year.

"We believe we have the chance to make level three, level four and level five doable," he said. He told Reuters the decision on which levels to release would depend in part on the market, and that cars with more autonomy might first be produced in small batches for single fleets.

Bosch said it saw level three vehicles being released with its on-board computer at the end of the decade, and level four driving not before 2025.

Uber [UBER.UL], Baidu and Google spin-off Waymo are testing self-driving taxis, while carmakers including Volvo, Audi and Ford expect to have level four cars on the road by 2020 or 2021.

Nvidia's Huang predicted those plans would speed up: "In the near future, you're going to see these schedules pull in."

UPDATE 1-Vietnam urges firms to stop YouTube and Facebook ads in protest over "fake content" - 路透新闻

{{20170316T105420.650+0000}}UPDATE 1-Vietnam urges firms to stop YouTube and Facebook ads in protest over "fake content"(Adds details of companies)

By My Pham

HANOI, March 16 (Reuters) - Vietnam on Thursday called on all companies doing business there to stop advertising on YouTube, Facebook and other social media until they find a way to halt the publication of "toxic" anti-government information.

At a meeting with the information and communication minister, companies including the local operations of Unilever , Ford and Yamaha Motor <7272.T> all committed to obey the call to suspend YouTube advertising.

Last month, the communist country began putting pressure on advertisers to try to get YouTube owner Google and other companies to remove content from foreign-based dissidents.

But Information and Communication Minister Truong Minh Tuan said the response had not yet been good enough. Although there were 8,000 anti-government videos on YouTube, Google had only blocked 42 and hadn't removed them completely, the ministry said.

"Today we call on all Vietnamese firms that are advertising not to abet them to take advertising money from firms to use against the Vietnamese government," Tuan told companies at a meeting in Hanoi.

"We also call on all internet users to raise their voice to Google and Facebook to prevent toxic, fake content violating Vietnamese law in the online environment."

YouTube reiterated its global policy of thoroughly reviewing government requests to block content they believe is illegal and restricting it where appropriate. Facebook gave no immediate response.

The Asia Internet Coalition, an industry association which includes both companies, said Vietnam and its businesses benefited greatly from the internet.

"It is critical for the Vietnamese government to protect the open nature of the internet, and put in place the right conditions that incentivize investment and nurture innovation," said Jeff Paine, the group's managing director.

For governments to complain to Google and Facebook about content published online is not new, but industry officials said there was less precedent for a state to try to put pressure on them through their advertisers.

Vietnam's state-owned Vinamilk , and flag carrier Vietnam Airlines suspended YouTube ads last month after the government told them their ads had appeared alongside inappropriate content.

Because of the computer-directed processes that pair adverts with their targeted audiences on social media, companies are not always aware of or have direct control over which specific videos an advert has been placed alongside.

Vietnam has come under fire from Western countries and human rights groups for its Decree 72 on social media - which bans information that it deems anti-government, damaging to national security or destroying national unity.

Despite the restrictions, content that ostensibly breaches the code's standards is still prolific.

While Vietnam makes up a very small part of the business operations of companies like Google and Facebook, it is one of Asia's fastest growing economies and a hot investment target for global consumer brands.

Within Vietnam itself, YouTube and Facebook account for two-thirds of digital media market share in Vietnam, according to Nguyen Khoa Hong Thanh, Operations Director at digital marketing agency Isobar Vietnam.

European car sales rise in February amid volume brand slump - 路透新闻

{{20170316T070004.596+0000}}European car sales rise in February amid volume brand slumpFRANKFURT, March 16 (Reuters) - European new car registrations rose 2.1 percent in February, even as large markets like Germany and volume brands like VW, Opel, Vauxhall and Peugeot posted lower sales, the Association of European Carmakers (ACEA) said on Thursday.

Car sales in the European Union and the countries of the European Free Trade Association reached 1,114,443 vehicles last month thanks to 6.2 percent rise in sales in Italy, a 15 percent increase in the Netherlands, and a 0.2 percent gain in demand for cars in Spain.

Large markets including Germany, France and Britain saw sales fall 2.6 percent, 2.9 percent and 0.3 percent respectively in what is traditionally a slow sales month.

Volkswagen's VW brand saw February sales fall 7 percent, while Peugeot saw sales drop 3.7 percent and Opel/Vauxhall recorded a fall of 1.2 percent in deliveries.

Among the top gainers was Fiat , with an 8.3 percent sales rise and Renault , which saw a 5.3 percent increase in registrations.

Among the premium brands, Mercedes-Benz recorded a 3.4 percent sales gain, outpacing rival Audi , which saw a 2.2 percent rise, while rival BMW saw registrations fall by 0.5 percent, ACEA figures showed.

While demand for passenger cars in the European Union alone increased only modestly by 2.2 percent, the 1,078,503 registrations comes close to February 2008 levels, just before the economic crisis hit, ACEA said.

UPDATE 3-Big win for automakers as Trump orders fuel economy standards review - 路透新闻

{{20170315T213255.696+0000}}UPDATE 3-Big win for automakers as Trump orders fuel economy standards review(Adds state AG pledging to fight changes, new auto task force, Barclays report)

By Nick Carey and David Shepardson

DETROIT/WASHINGTON, March 15 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Wednesday ordered a review of tough U.S. vehicle fuel-efficiency standards put in place by the Obama administration, handing a victory to auto industry executives and provoking criticism from Democrats and environmental groups.

In a move widely seen as a preamble to loosening fuel standards, Trump told an audience of cheering union workers, he would "ensure that any regulations we have protect and defend your jobs, your factories," and promised he would encourage growth in the U.S. auto sector.

"The assault on the American auto industry is over," Trump said, standing in front of a banner that read "Buy American-Hire American."

Trump added that the White House is "setting up a task force in every federal agency to identify and remove any regulation that undermines American auto production."

The backdrop and message underscored Trump's efforts to lock down support in industrial states such as Michigan that put him in the White House. Trump spoke at the site of the former Willow Run bomber factory in Ypsilanti, Michigan, which won fame for building an operational B-24 heavy bomber every 59 minutes during World War Two. Now, the site is being redeveloped as a testing ground for autonomous vehicles.

At a roundtable with industry leaders Trump made clear he expected automakers to hire more Americans in return, a theme that dominated his election campaign.

"We're going to do some wonderful work with you, but you're going to have to help us with jobs," he said.

Trump's event was attended by around 1,000 people, including automotive executives, United Auto Workers union President Dennis Williams - who sat next to Trump - and workers from Detroit's "Big Three" automakers: General Motors Co , Ford Motor Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCA) . Automakers lined up examples of vehicles they build in the United States for the president to see.

Auto industry executives have said they are hopeful the Trump administration will pursue tax and regulatory policies that would benefit U.S. manufacturers.

Reopening the fuel efficiency rules put in place by Democratic President Barack Obama days before he left office is one of the top items on the industry's agenda. Automakers, through their lobbying groups, have said the Obama rules were too expensive and could cost American jobs.

"These standards are costly for automakers and the American people," said Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt.

After one participant in Wednesday's meetings mentioned environmental concerns, Trump said he agreed but did not want an "extra thimbleful of fuel" to get in the way of growth.

In a meeting with top auto executives from U.S. and foreign automakers, Trump said the government needs to get out of the way of the auto industry building vehicles, a person who attended the meeting said.

Automakers are wary of being seen as out of touch with environmental concerns, or unwilling to invest in new technology. Ford, for example, used its Twitter account on Wednesday to highlight previously announced commitments to develop electric vehicles.

It could take a year for the review process to play out, and Wednesday's event was effectively a starting gun for intense lobbying efforts over how government policy will drive technology investment decisions in the auto sector.

Critics like Democratic U.S. Senator Edward Markey of Massachusetts said Trump's move could hurt consumers.

"Filling up their cars and trucks is the energy bill Americans pay most often, but President Trump's roll-back of fuel economy emissions standards means families will end up paying more at the pump," Markey added.

The president is not seeking to revoke California's authority to set vehicle efficiency rules even stricter than federal rules, including mandated sales of electric vehicles, as part of this move, a White House official said. The official did not rule out seeking to withdraw California's authority in the future. Pruitt, an ally of the fossil fuel industry, would not commit during his Senate confirmation hearing to allowing California to continue its own clean vehicle rules. [nL1N1F827W]

A group of 10 state attorneys general led by California and New York said on Wednesday they would fight attempts to weaken the rules.

California's attorney general late Tuesday filed legal papers in a federal court defending the Obama administration's decision to finalize the determination in January.

Barclays auto analyst Brian Johnson said in a research note that he expects the Trump administration review will lead to reductions in planned hikes in fuel efficiency standards after 2021.

The Obama administration's rules, negotiated with automakers in 2012, were aimed at doubling average fleetwide fuel efficiency to 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025, although the real-world mileage figures would be lower.

'THOUGHTFUL AND COORDINATED'

Automotive industry executives and lobbying groups were quick to praise the administration's announcement.

"The Trump administration has created an opportunity for decision-makers to reach a thoughtful and coordinated outcome predicated on the best and most current data," said Mitch Bainwol, chief executive of the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, an industry lobbying group.

Automakers have signaled they want the government to give manufacturers more credit toward achieving fuel efficiency targets for technologies such as "stop-start" systems that shut down a car's engine at a traffic light.

Regulators should also look at whether ride hailing and vehicle-to-vehicle communications systems designed to prevent accidents and alleviate road congestion could be counted toward the industry's greenhouse gas emissions goals, the automaker group proposed in comments to the EPA last year. The group represents a dozen automakers, including GM, Ford and FCA.

Under the 2012 agreement with the industry, the EPA was given until April 2018 to decide whether the standards were feasible under a "midterm review," but the agency moved up its decision to a week before Obama left office in a bid to maintain a key part of his administration's environmental legacy.

An EPA analysis indicated that compared with previous rules, the 2025 standards would result in savings of between $1,460 and $1,620 over the lifetime of a vehicle and payback for new technology required to meet the new standards of around five years.

The Obama administration said the rules would cost the auto industry $200 billion over 13 years, but save motorists $1.7 trillion over the life of the vehicles.

Trump plan to review vehicle fuel efficiency rules draws criticism - 路透新闻

{{20170315T153912.083+0000}}Trump plan to review vehicle fuel efficiency rules draws criticismBy David Shepardson

WASHINGTON, March 15 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump's plans to reassess strict U.S. vehicle fuel-efficiency standards put in place under former President Barack Obama drew criticism on Wednesday from Democrats and environmental groups who accused him of risking more carbon emissions and higher fuel costs.

The move by Trump - to be announced on a trip to the heart of America's auto industry in suburban Detroit - is a victory for automakers which say the current rules are too expensive, could cost jobs and are out of step with vehicles consumers want to buy.

But the Republican president will not seek to revoke California's authority to set vehicle efficiency rules even stricter than federal rules as part of this move, a White House official said. The official did not rule out seeking to withdraw California's authority in the future.

The Obama administration's rules, negotiated with automakers in 2012, were aimed at doubling average fleetwide fuel efficiency to 54.5 mpg by 2025. In January, shortly before Trump took office, Obama's Environmental Protection Agency locked that goal in place in a move that disappointed car manufacturers.

A White House official said Trump will announce that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency will reverse the Obama administration's action to lock in the standards and will spend a year reviewing whether those rules are feasible. The administration has made no decisions on how or if the standards should be revised, the official said.

Rhea Suh, president of the Natural Resources Defense Council environmental group, called the move another part of Trump's retreat from action to combat climate change.

"This change makes no sense," Suh said. "Mileage standards save consumers money at the gas pump, make Americans less dependent on oil, reduce carbon pollution and advance innovation. The current standards helped the auto companies move from bankruptcy to profitability, and there is no reason they cannot be met."

In Michigan, Trump will meet with chief executives from General Motors Co , Ford Motor Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV and top U.S. executives from Toyota Motor Corp, Daimler AG and others, and speak to autoworkers.

'WRONG WAY'

Democratic Senator Edward Markey of Massachusetts said Trump's move will lead to needless uncertainty for the auto industry.

"Filling up their cars and trucks is the energy bill Americans pay most often, but President Trump's roll-back of fuel economy emissions standards means families will end up paying more at the pump," Markey added.

Under the 2012 agreement with the industry, the EPA was given until April 2018 to decide whether the standards were feasible under a "midterm review," but the agency moved up its decision to a week before Obama left office in a bid to maintain a key part of his administration's environmental legacy.

Automakers say they need more flexibility to meet the rules amid low gas prices. Environmentalists have vowed to sue if the Trump administration weakens them.

California, the most populous U.S. state, has long drawn the ire of automakers for setting more aggressive environmental vehicle rules, including requiring zero emission cars.

Thirteen other states have adopted California rules that account for about 40 percent of U.S. vehicle sales.

California has a waiver under the Clean Air Act to set its own vehicle rules and has said it would vigorously fight any effort to revoke it.

Trump's EPA chief, Scott Pruitt, an ally of the fossil fuel industry, would not commit during his Senate confirmation hearing to allowing California to continue its own clean vehicle rules. [nL1N1F827W]

Each Detroit automaker will bring about 500 people to Trump's event on Wednesday, bused in from auto plants, technical centers and headquarters. The automakers said they wanted an array of union hourly workers, salaried office workers and engineers as well as executives at the event.

In the United States, which accounts for about 10 percent of global gasoline usage, demand hit a record in 2016, averaging 9.3 million barrels per day, surpassing 2007 levels, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Changes in fuel efficiency standards in the United States can dictate investment decisions due to the country's heavy consumption of the fuel.

Trump won't seek to roll back California vehicle authority - 路透新闻

{{20170315T090001.679+0000}}Trump won't seek to roll back California vehicle authorityBy David Shepardson

WASHINGTON, March 15 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump will announce the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency will revive a review of the feasibility of strict fuel efficiency standards through 2025, but will not seek to withdraw California's authority to set its own vehicle rules, a White House official said late on Tuesday.

Reuters reported on Monday the administration planned to announce the review on Wednesday as Trump heads to Michigan, home of the U.S. auto industry. [nL2N1GQ0FG]

A White House official briefing reporters said the Trump administration will spend the next year working on the review to determine if the 2022-2025 model-year rules are feasible. The administration has made no decisions on how or if the standards should be revised.

But the Trump administration is not picking an immediate fight with California, which has long drawn the ire of automakers for setting more aggressive environmental vehicle rules, including requiring zero emission cars.

In 2012, California, the most populous U.S. state, agreed to harmonize its vehicle emissions rules with Obama administration rules that were aimed at doubling average fleetwide fuel efficiency to 54.5 mpg by 2025. Thirteen other states have adopted California rules that account for about 40 percent of U.S. vehicle sales.

California has a waiver under the Clean Air Act to set its own vehicle rules and has said it would vigorously fight any effort to revoke it. The administration official did not rule out a potential effort to restrict California's authority at a future date but said the White House hoped to work collaboratively with the state on the review.

Securing America's Energy Future (SAFE), a non-partisan group of energy advocates and retired military leaders, urged the federal government, California and others to work together.

"There's no reason for environmentalists, automakers and conservatives to risk a nuclear war over these rules, which will result in zero progress for all sides," said SAFE's chief executive, Robbie Diamond.

In Michigan, Trump will meet with chief executives from General Motors Co , Ford Motor Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV and top U.S. executives from Toyota Motor Corp, Daimler AG and others, and speak to autoworkers.

EPA had had until April 2018 to decide whether the standards were feasible under a "midterm review," but moved up its decision to a week before President Barack Obama left office in January.

Automakers argue the vehicle emissions rules will impose significant costs and are out of step with consumer preferences. They say they need more flexibility to meet the rules amid low gas prices.

Environmentalists say the rules reduce fuel costs and greenhouse gases, and they have vowed to sue if the Trump administration weakens them.

UPDATE 4-Trump to announce review of vehicle emissions rules -sources - 路透新闻

{{20170313T212017.720+0000}}UPDATE 4-Trump to announce review of vehicle emissions rules -sources(Adds Nissan attending, official comment on California)

By David Shepardson

WASHINGTON, March 13 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump is set to formally announce a review of vehicle fuel efficiency rules locked in at the end of the Obama administration when he meets with automaker chiefs this week, according to two sources briefed on the matter.

The move by Trump would be a victory for automakers after months of pushing the new administration to reconsider the rules, which they say would be too expensive, could cost jobs and are out of step with vehicles consumers want to buy.

Trump will visit an autonomous vehicle testing facility in a Detroit suburb on Wednesday and meet there with chief executives of several U.S. automakers.

His administration has decided to review the feasibility of the vehicle emissions rules, which apply to the years 2022 through 2025, sources told Reuters last week. Former President Barack Obama moved to keep them in the final days of his administration.

Reuters reported on the planned announcement on March 3. A formal notice by U.S. regulators to restart the review is expected to be made public on Wednesday. [nL2N1GG1EC]

White House spokesman Sean Spicer said on Monday the trip is focused on "job creation and automobile manufacturing... highlighting the need to eliminate burdensome regulations that needlessly hinder meaningful job growth."

The chief executives of General Motors Co , Ford Motor Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV will meet with the president in Ypsilanti Township, Michigan, along with senior officials from Japanese and German automakers, including Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T>, Nissan Motor Co <7201.T> and Daimler AG .

Trump will hold a roundtable with CEOs and then make a speech to autoworkers and others.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency had until April 2018 to decide whether the standards were feasible under a "midterm review," but moved up its decision to a week before Obama left office in January.

Automakers argue the vehicle emissions rules, which would raise the fleet average fuel efficiency to more than 50 miles per gallon (mpg) by 2025 from 27.5 mpg in 2010, will impose significant costs and are out of step with consumer preferences. They argue they need more flexibility to meet the rules amid low gas prices.

Environmentalists, who favor the standards, say the rules will reduce fuel costs and greenhouse gases and have vowed to sue if the Trump administration weakens them.

Trade groups representing automakers, including General Motors, Volkswagen AG and Toyota, have asked the EPA to withdraw the determination finalizing the rules, which stem from a 2011 deal the industry reached with the U.S. government.

Changing the 2022-2025 fuel rules will require a lengthy regulatory process and environmentalists and Democratic state attorneys general are likely to sue if the Trump administration significantly weakens the requirements.

The Obama administration said in 2011 the changes would boost fuel efficiency to a fleet-wide average of 54.5 mpg, save motorists $1.7 trillion in total fuel costs over the life of the vehicles and cost the auto industry about $200 billion over 13 years. The fuel standards were a central part of Obama's legacy on addressing climate change.

In July, the EPA estimated the fleet would average only 50.8 mpg to 52.6 mpg in 2025 under the rules because Americans were buying more sport utility vehicles and trucks and fewer cars.

Automakers briefed on the meeting do not expect the EPA to take action this week to attempt to prevent California from setting its own vehicle emissions rules. A Trump administration official confirmed it does not intend to address California's authority this week.

Reuters reported last week the EPA is considering taking steps to reverse California's waiver under the Clean Air Act that allows it to set its own vehicle greenhouse gas emissions standards.

Trump has repeatedly met with automaker CEOs since taking office and made boosting employment, especially in the auto sector, a top priority.

UPDATE 1-Ford's Lincoln plans to produce luxury SUV in China by late 2019 - 路透新闻

{{20170313T071841.891+0000}}UPDATE 1-Ford's Lincoln plans to produce luxury SUV in China by late 2019* Lincoln vehicles currently imported into China

* Their sales jumped nearly 180 pct in 2016, says company

(Adds details from statement and background)

BEIJING, March 13 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co's luxury unit Lincoln plans to produce luxury SUVs in China by late 2019, as it steps up its move into the world's largest auto market and aims to catch up with German and U.S. rivals who already manufacture in the Asian nation.

The plan is to build an all-new sports utility vehicle (SUV) to suit Chinese tastes, Lincoln China said in a statement. Ford plans to use an existing assembly plant it jointly operates with Chongqing Changan Automobile Co Ltd <000625.SZ> to produce the Lincoln vehicles, a Ford spokesman in Shanghai said.

Lincoln vehicles are currently imported into China, and their sales have jumped nearly 180 percent in 2016, the statement said.

"The move to local production is a key next step in Lincoln's evolution in China and will complement continued imports from North America," it said.

The statement gave no other details about the plans. The Ford spokesman declined to give the model's anticipated production volume or describe the model other than to say it is an SUV.

The Changan-Ford joint venture is in the process of getting approval for this move to produce Lincoln vehicles locally in China, said the spokesman.

Lincoln China President Amy Marentic told Reuters in October that the brand was studying whether to produce cars locally in China. [nL1N1CH04F]

Lincoln was accelerating its entry into China with plans to have 65 Lincoln stores by the end of 2016, instead of previous plans of 60, with 80 planned for year-end 2017, she said.

Marentic said the company would also open five to 10 smaller sales branches to tap into fast-growing auto sales in lower-tier Chinese cities.

Ford names tech executive Lynn Vojvodich to board - 路透新闻

{{20170310T153456.369+0000}}Ford names tech executive Lynn Vojvodich to boardMarch 10 (Reuters) - U.S. automaker Ford Motor Co said on Friday it had elected former Salesforce.com Inc executive Lynn Vojvodich to its board of directors.

Vojvodich, who has also held roles at Microsoft Corp and tech venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, will begin her new role in April.

Vojvodich's expertise in the software industry will help Ford advance its customer experience strategy, the company said. [nBw74c3GVa]

Her appointment comes as Ford and other carmakers try to harvest data on how customers use their cars and profit from offering services beyond the sale of new vehicles.

Ford last year rolled out a mobility app called FordPass that allows vehicle owners and non-owners to search for parking spots and rent out their vehicles through car-sharing services. [nL2N14U0EM]

Automakers are also accelerating their push toward mobility, the term auto companies use to describe the next wave of personal transportation.

Mobility includes services ranging from ride-sharing to automated driving, both of which require software technology.

UPDATE 1-Volkswagen, Tata Motors plan to cooperate in India - 路透新闻

{{20170310T111856.336+0000}}UPDATE 1-Volkswagen, Tata Motors plan to cooperate in India* VW's Skoda to lead partnership project with Tata Motors

* Tata aims to launch products from the partnership in 2019

* India set to become the world's No.3 car market by 2020

(Adds details from press release of Tata, VW, background)

By Aditi Shah and Georgina Prodhan

NEW DELHI/FRANKFURT, March 10 (Reuters) - German carmaker Volkswagen said on Friday it had signed a memorandum of understanding to explore a partnership with India's Tata Motors to jointly develop auto components and vehicles for the Indian subcontinent and beyond.

The announcement, which confirms a Reuters story from Thursday, comes as both automakers look to hit the reset button in India after falling behind more nimble rivals such as Maruti Suzuki and Hyundai Motor Co <005380.KS>. [nL5N1GM5D9]

Goldman Sachs analyst Pramod Kumar said in a note on Thursday a tie-up could be "mutually beneficial" as the engine offerings of both companies complement each other and would help the alliance match up to competition.

Volkswagen (VW) said its Skoda unit would lead the project.

"The first step will address topics such as the application of specific market knowledge as well as local development expertise," VW said in its statement.

For VW, the tie-up would provide an opportunity to make more headway into India, which analysts say is expected to become the world's third-largest auto market behind the United States and leader China by 2020.

"By offering the appropriate products we intend to achieve sustainable and profitable growth in very different parts of the world," VW CEO Matthias Müller said in the statement.

India has proven to be a tough market to crack for many foreign automakers, given different demand trends across the country and rapid changes in customer preferences.

Besides VW, foreign automakers including General Motors and Ford Motor Co have struggled to ramp up sales in India, and are now pushing exports from the country to use idle manufacturing capacity. [nL4N1EW3OK] [nL8N1BE3M0]

Even domestic players such as Tata have struggled to quickly adapt to changing demand trends in India, where Maruti Suzuki and Hyundai control two-thirds of the market.

The partnership comes as Tata Motors tries to turnaround its loss-making domestic business by launching more modern vehicles, improving efficiencies and streamlining its organisation. [nL4N1FN2SJ]

"This is in alignment with Tata Motors' efforts to make itself 'FutuReady' by embracing new technologies, fostering higher platform efficiency and offering solutions that connect with the aspirations of our customers," managing director Guenter Butschek said in a separate statement on Friday.

Following a definitive agreement, the two companies plan to begin joint development work and, based on this, Tata Motors said it intended to launch products from the partnership in the Indian market starting in 2019.

NAFTA clouds investment hopes in Mexican state hit by Ford loss - 路透新闻

{{20170308T185521.057+0000}}NAFTA clouds investment hopes in Mexican state hit by Ford lossSAN LUIS POTOSI, Mexico, March 8 (Reuters) - The Mexican state that the Ford Motor Co abandoned after Donald Trump's election is courting Asian manufacturers to make up for the loss, but clearing up uncertainty over the future of NAFTA will be key to attracting new investment, its governor said.

In January when Ford canceled a $1.6 billion plant in San Luis Potosi it was a major victory for President Trump's campaign to force U.S. industry to bring jobs home, but it also sparked fears of a slump in foreign investment in Mexico.

Trump has threatened to ditch the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) between the United States, Mexico and Canada if he cannot rework it to his advantage, but Mexico's government has also said it could walk away from an unfavorable deal.

Juan Manuel Carreras, governor of the central state, said until Mexico and the United States establish the basis for future trade, drawing in major investors would be challenging.

"Once we have clarity on NAFTA, I'm sure Mexico and San Luis Potosi will have plenty of opportunities to attract new investment," Carreras said in an interview.

Mexican and U.S. officials have said NAFTA negotiations could begin from around mid-year onwards.

San Luis Potosi's economy minister Gustavo Puente Orozco, traveled to China and Singapore in February after Ford pulled out. He heralded some new investments from Asian suppliers, but it was not substantial enough to compensate for the loss.

Puente told Reuters 56 Japanese companies do business in San Luis Potosi, up from just three eight years ago. Still, nearly half the foreign direct investment in the state over the past 16 years have come from the United States, he said.

Suppliers in San Luis Potosi have grown cautious since Ford withdrew, and estimates on the potential cost to the state run into the hundreds of millions of dollars. [nL1N1EW1XY].

Ford attributed its decision to declining demand for small cars, though Trump lashed out at Ford when it unveiled the investment last year, and he took credit for its change of plan.

Mexico accounts for one-fifth of all vehicle production in North America and has attracted more than $24 billion in investment from the industry since 2010, according to the Michigan-based Automotive Research Center.

The country exports most of its car production to the United States, but Trump wants auto makers to invest more at home, and has threatened to impose high tariffs on cars made in Mexico.

INSIGHT-'It's like kumbaya': Trump's genial private meetings with CEOs jar with public attacks - 路透新闻

{{20170308T162816.153+0000}}INSIGHT-'It's like kumbaya': Trump's genial private meetings with CEOs jar with public attacks(Adds Trump's Wednesday meeting with infrastructure CEOs in paragraph 6)

By Ginger Gibson and David Shepardson

WASHINGTON, March 8 (Reuters) - When the bosses of some of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies headed to Washington in January to meet U.S. President Donald Trump, it had all the makings of a potentially hostile meeting.

Just weeks before, Trump had sent drug stock prices plummeting after accusing the companies of "getting away with murder" by charging too much for medicines.

But the Trump who greeted chief executives of Johnson & Johnson , Novartis , Merck , Eli Lilly , Celgene and Amgen on Jan. 31 was a surprisingly genial host who even gave them a personal tour of the Oval Office, according to several participants in the breakfast.

"There is no question that it was better than it could have been or we thought it could be," said one industry insider familiar with the meeting.

Trump did not repeat his public attacks on the industry. Instead, he focused on "outdated" regulations that drive costs up for drugmakers, according to participants interviewed by Reuters. The CEOs left with Trump's word that he would streamline regulations and reform the high U.S. corporate tax rate.

Since taking office on Jan. 20, Trump has held at least nine meetings with groups of business leaders, including automakers, airlines, retailers and health insurers. On Wednesday, he was hosting lunch for a group of New York real estate developers and private equity CEOs, during which possible private-public partnerships on infrastructure would be discussed, according to a person briefed on the meeting. [ID:nL2N1GL0ID]

In early morning or late-night tweets and in speeches, Trump has lambasted many of these companies for cost over-runs, or high prices, or foreign manufacturing, often knocking down their share prices. (See the effects of Trump's tweets on stock prices here http://tmsnrt.rs/2ibdFSF)

But Reuters interviews with nearly a dozen executives and lobbyists who have taken part in these meetings or have been briefed on them reveal a Trump who is very different from his uncompromising and demanding @realDonaldTrump Twitter handle.

When he meets the nation's top chief executives in person, he is a mix of charm and cajoling. This Trump is flexible and inquisitive, a schmoozer who remembers birthdays and often lavishes praise on their companies, said the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity so they could freely discuss private meetings.

This private side of Trump sheds light on why many CEOs have expressed confidence that the Republican president is good for business, despite his share-denting public attacks. As recently as Tuesday, Trump tweeted he was working on a system to increase competition in the health industry and lower drug pricing, sending pharma shares lower. [ID:nL2N1GK0SB]

In the White House meetings, Trump focuses much of his talk on cutting regulations, the sources said, underscoring one of his administration's key priorities - getting rid of rules imposed by his predecessor Barack Obama. He typically asks which regulations are holding businesses back from adding new jobs and promises to resolve the issues, executives say.

"He said one thing for the cameras and the door shuts and then it's like kumbaya," said one person who was briefed on a meeting between Trump and a group of CEOs.

"He likes to be seen as engaging and buddy buddy with other big important business leaders," said this person.

A former businessman, Trump runs his closed-door meetings with CEOs as if they were a corporate board meeting, attendees said. In contrast to his doctrinaire tweets, he likes to seek input from everyone at the table, and compared to former presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush, conversations are less scripted.

Trump's approach to these meetings is "one of listening and not lecturing", said a senior White House official who has participated in industry meetings.

An Amgen spokeswoman said Trump made it clear that he wanted to work with the company on U.S. job creation and biotech innovation. Representatives of the other drugmakers declined to comment.

SHOWING OFF THE DRAPES

Because so little is known about how Trump interacts privately with CEOs, trade groups and company officials have begun to swap tips on how to approach their meetings with him.

"There is this undercurrent of information sharing about what to expect, what to do," said one trade group official who prepared CEOs for a recent meeting with Trump. He said he has gotten a flurry of calls from other industries next in line for a White House visit.

At the end of most meetings, Trump leads CEOs into the Oval Office, showing off paintings, sculptures and the furniture, as well as the rug and curtains he has picked out. He also points out a bust of Martin Luther King Jr., which he inherited from Obama. Then he takes a group photo behind the desk.

"He becomes tour guide and brings them over to the Oval Office," the same official said. "He's very proud of the Oval Office."

The White House official said Trump recognized the "awe" of the Oval Office.

CHAIR FOR GM, BIRTHDAY WISH FOR FORD

Chief executives of Detroit's top three automakers - General Motors Co , Ford Motor Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV - were pleasantly surprised when they went to the White House for a breakfast with Trump on Jan. 24.

Since his election, Trump has frequently attacked the car companies for building in Mexico and warned U.S. firms would no longer be able to move U.S. jobs abroad "without consequences."

When Trump entered the Roosevelt Room, he greeted GM CEO Mary Barra with a playful tap on the shoulder as he gently prodded her to add jobs in the United States and later pulled out her chair before the meeting started, a review of the video transcripts of the first part of the meeting shows.

He greeted Ford CEO Mark Fields with a "Happy Birthday. It's his birthday ladies and gentlemen." Trump said it was a "great honor" to see Fiat Chrysler CEO Sergio Marchionne.

Trump did not specifically ask them to build plants in the United States - as he had tweeted he would before the meeting - but instead listened to their complaints about regulations and indicated a willingness to help them, people briefed on the meeting said.

Ford declined to comment and referred to Fields' comments to dealers in January that Trump had asked for a list of regulations that automakers wanted cut or kept.

Barra said in a speech last week that Trump "really listened" to the automakers, while Marchionne told reporters at the Geneva auto show on Tuesday that Trump was "quite willing to make our lives easier" in terms of compliance and taxes in order to encourage U.S. job creation.

Trump has been complimentary of his high-profile guests - and at times playful.

After Denise Morrison, chief executive of Campbell Soup , introduced herself in one of those meetings, Trump quickly responded: "Good soup."

At another, after Target Corp CEO Brian Cornell spoke, Trump responded by pronouncing the name of the company as "Tar-Jay," a common joke to make the retailer sound more fancy.

FACTBOX-Compare and contrast: Trump's tweets vs private comments to CEOs - 路透新闻

{{20170308T110004.252+0000}}FACTBOX-Compare and contrast: Trump's tweets vs private comments to CEOsBy David Shepardson

WASHINGTON, March 8 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump has gone on Twitter to lambaste a number of companies for cost over-runs, or high prices, or foreign manufacturing.

But Reuters interviews with executives and lobbyists who met with him at the White House reveal a Trump who is very different from his uncompromising and demanding @realDonaldTrump Twitter handle. [ID:nL2N1GF14K]

Here are some of the examples to illustrate the difference in tone:

What he tweeted about automakers:

Jan. 3 - General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across border. Make in U.S.A. or pay big border tax!

Jan. 5 - Toyota Motor said will build a new plant in Baja, Mexico, to build Corolla cars for U.S. NO WAY! Build plant in U.S. or pay big border tax.

What he told automakers at Jan. 24 White House meeting:

"We're reducing taxes very substantially and we're reducing unnecessary regulations. We are going to make the process much more simple for the auto companies and for everybody else that wants to do business in the United States."

What he tweeted about manufacturers:

Dec. 2 - Rexnord of Indiana is moving to Mexico and rather viciously firing all of its 300 workers. This is happening all over our country. No more!

Dec 6 - Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!

Dec. 12 - Lockheed Martin: The F-35 program and cost is out of control. Billions of dollars can and will be saved on military (and other) purchases after January 20th.

What he told manufacturers at Jan. 23 White House meeting:

"We're going to be cutting regulation massively ... The problem with the regulation that we have right now is that you can't do anything."

What he tweeted about drugmakers:

March 7 - I am working on a new system where there will be competition in the Drug Industry. Pricing for the American people will come way down!

What he told drugmakers on Jan. 31 White House meeting

"We're also gonna be streamlining the process, so that, from your standpoint, when you have a drug, you can actually get it approved if it works, instead of waiting for many, many years."

UPDATE 1-Kiekert AG to plead guilty in U.S. to bid rigging involving auto parts - 路透新闻

{{20170307T201835.793+0000}}UPDATE 1-Kiekert AG to plead guilty in U.S. to bid rigging involving auto parts(Adds comment from Kiekert)

WASHINGTON, March 7 (Reuters) - Kiekert AG, which makes car locks and door latches for auto makers, has agreed to plead guilty to bid rigging and to pay a $6.1 million fine, the U.S. Justice Department said on Tuesday.

Kiekert was part of a conspiracy to rig bids for parts sold to Ford Motor Co between mid-2008 and mid-2013, the department said.

The German company will plead guilty to one criminal count in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, the department said.

Kiekert said in a statement that it regretted the bid rigging and had taken steps to ensure there was no recurrence.

"Kiekert has conducted an extensive internal investigation and has cooperated actively and fully with the authorities at all times," the company said in a statement.

UPDATE 2-U.S. Democrats urge EPA not to reopen vehicle fuel efficiency rules - 路透新闻

{{20170307T184940.656+0000}}UPDATE 2-U.S. Democrats urge EPA not to reopen vehicle fuel efficiency rules(Adds comments from Fiat Chrysler CEO Sergio Marchionne, other senators, White House not commenting)

By David Shepardson

WASHINGTON, March 7 (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and 11 other Democrats said on Tuesday it was "critical" that the Trump administration leave in place new vehicle fuel efficiency rules, saying the higher standards were achievable.

Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, is expected to announce as early as this week the reopening of a review of the rules that were set by the Obama administration for the 2022-2025 period.

Automakers say the changes, which would raise the fleet average fuel efficiency to more than 50 miles per gallon by 2025 from 27.5 mpg in 2010, will impose significant costs and are out of step with consumer preferences. They argue they need more flexibility to meet the rules amid low gas prices.

Environmentalists, who favor the new standards, say they would reduce fuel costs and greenhouse gases and have vowed to sue if the Trump administration weakens them.

"These automobile emissions standards are economically feasible and technologically achievable for the auto industry," the Democratic senators, including Edward Markey of Massachusetts and former presidential candidate Bernard Sanders of Vermont, wrote in a letter to Pruitt. "It is critical that they remain in place."

EPA spokeswoman Cathy Milbourn declined to comment on the letter "since the agency has not announced how it will proceed on the vehicle emission standards." The White House also declined to comment.

Trade groups representing automakers, including General Motors Co , Ford Motor Co and Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T>, have asked the EPA to withdraw the rules, which stem from a 2011 deal the industry reached with the U.S. government.

The chief executives of GM, Ford, and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV , along with the top North American executives at Toyota, Volkswagen, Honda, Hyundai Motor Co <005380.KS> and others separately have urged President Donald Trump to revisit the decision.

The Obama administration in 2011 said the changes would save motorists $1.7 trillion in fuel costs over the life of the vehicles and cost the auto industry about $200 billion over 13 years.

In July, the EPA estimated the fleet would average 50.8-52.6 mpg in 2025 because Americans were buying more SUVs and trucks. It had until April 2018 to decide whether the standards were feasible under a "midterm review," but moved up its decision to a week before President Barack Obama left office.

The EPA is also considering taking steps to reverse California's waiver under the Clean Air Act that allows it to set its own vehicle greenhouse gas emissions standards. California has repeatedly vowed to vigorously contest any efforts to withdraw its authority, and in January the state hired former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder to represent it.

At the Geneva auto show, Fiat Chrysler Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne told reporters he opposed the Obama administration's decision to finalize the rules.

"We have simply asked that the case be reopened to understand what the consequences would be of the norms introduced five years ago," Marchionne said, adding that he expects to "see a positive reply in the coming days" from the Trump administration.

FACTBOX-Trump tweets have short-lived impact on stocks - 路透新闻

{{20170307T181721.858+0000}}FACTBOX-Trump tweets have short-lived impact on stocksNEW YORK, March 7 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's comments about various companies have drawn much attention, and his tweets on Tuesday marked a subtle shift in which they focused on a sector over a specific company.

But while the share prices of most companies that Trump singled out on Twitter have dropped immediately, the impact has been mostly short lived.

Following is a list of companies targeted in Trump's tweets:

DRUG COMPANIES Pfizer Inc , Merck & Co Inc , Amgen Inc and Gilead Sciences Inc : Trump sent a tweet on Tuesday before the market opened that he was "working on a new system where there will be competition in the Drug Industry. Pricing for the American people will come way down!"

Drugmakers' shares moved lower. Pfizer was down 1 percent at $34.02, and Merck fell 0.6 percent at $66.05. Both are Dow Jones industrial average components.

Amgen was off 0.9 percent at $177.88, and Gilead was 1.8 percent lower at $68.87. The PowerShares Dynamic Pharmaceutical ETF was down 1.3 percent.

EXXON MOBIL CORP : Trump congratulated the oil company in a tweet after the closing bell on Monday for an investment program that would create "45,000 construction & manufacturing jobs in the U.S. Gulf Coast region." Shares of the Dow component were down 0.8 percent at $82.19 on Tuesday.

BOEING CO : In a Dec. 6 tweet, Trump criticized costs of the Air Force One plane manufactured by the company. Shares of the Dow component closed that session little changed and since rallied nearly 19 percent through Monday's close.

UNITED TECHNOLOGIES CORP : Trump tweeted on Nov. 24 about working on a deal with the Dow component to keep jobs at its Carrier unit in Indiana. The stock gained 0.6 percent in the session following the Thanksgiving holiday and had advanced nearly 4 percent through Monday.

LOCKHEED MARTIN CORP : Trump tweeted on Dec. 12 that the U.S. defense company's F-35 fighter jet program was "out of control." Lockheed Martin shares fell 2.5 percent on the day of the tweet but have recovered since and were up 3.6 percent at Monday's close. The stock has outperformed the NYSE Arca Defense index <.DFII>, which has risen 1.4 percent over the same period.

GENERAL MOTORS CO : Trump on Jan. 3 threatened a "big border tax" on GM for making its Chevy Cruze model in Mexico. GM shares fell briefly in premarket trade following the tweets and recovered to finish the trading session up 0.9 percent. The stock since gained nearly 9 percent through Monday's close.

FORD MOTOR CO : Shares are up 5.5 percent since Trump tweeted late on Nov. 17 that the company would keep jobs in Kentucky.

TOYOTA MOTOR CORP <7203.T>: Trump, who campaigned on promises to keep manufacturing in the United States, tweeted on Jan. 5 that he would impose a fee if the Japanese automaker built its Corolla cars for the U.S. market in Mexico. Toyota's U.S.-listed shares ended the session down 0.6 pct and have slumped nearly 7 percent since then, as one of the few stocks targeted that has continued to struggle. [nL1N1EV1FV]

FIAT CHRYSLER AUTOMOBILES NV : Trump applauded the company on Twitter on Jan. 9 for plans to invest in Michigan and Ohio plants. Its U.S.-listed shares were down nearly 2 percent through Monday's close.

UPDATE 1-Brazil auto output recovers on better exports, outlook - 路透新闻

{{20170307T172332.117+0000}}UPDATE 1-Brazil auto output recovers on better exports, outlook(Adds details of exports, comments from Anfavea president)

By Alberto Alerigi

SAO PAULO, March 7 (Reuters) - Automakers in Brazil ramped up production in February, spurred by strong exports and expectations of recovering sales after a brutal four-year downturn in what had been the world's fourth-biggest car market.

Automobile production rose 14.7 percent in February from January and surged 39 percent from a year earlier, national automakers' association Anfavea said on Tuesday. Sales slipped 7.8 percent from January and fell 7.6 percent from February 2016.

Exports in the first two months of the year rose 73 percent from a year earlier to about 104,000 vehicles, the best start to a year on record. Brazil's auto exports have traditionally been concentrated on neighboring Argentina, but carmakers are pushing to improve access to markets such as Peru and Colombia.

Anfavea President Antonio Megale said exports increased across Latin America in January and February, but it was too early to tell if the pace would be sustained for the full year, which would bring Brazilian car exports to a seven-year high.

Employment in the auto industry also edged up in the month for the first time in three years, adding a few hundred jobs after shedding some 35,000 since the start of 2014. Auto factories in Brazil are still using less than half of installed capacity, as high unemployment and tight credit pinches demand.

Brazil's auto market, which has shrunk to the world's seventh largest according to Anfavea, remains a major base of operations for Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV , Volkswagen AG and General Motors Co .

According to Anfavea data, FCA was Brazil's top seller of new cars and light trucks in February, taking the title back from GM with around 24,700 sales, ahead of its U.S. rival's roughly 23,200 new registrations. VW sold about 17,200 vehicles.

Hyundai Motor Co <005380.KS> rose from sixth to fourth place with nearly 12,000 sales, surpassing 11,900 from Ford and about 11,100 from Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T>.

Democratic U.S. senators urge EPA not to reopen 2025 vehicle fuel rules - 路透新闻

{{20170307T150124.550+0000}}Democratic U.S. senators urge EPA not to reopen 2025 vehicle fuel rulesWASHINGTON, March 7 (Reuters) - A group of 12 U.S. senators, including Democratic leader Charles Schumer, on Tuesday urged the Trump administration not to reopen the 2022 through 2025 vehicle fuel efficiency rules.

The push follows a similar call by major environmental groups on Friday. After a push by major automakers including General Motors Co , Ford Motor Co and Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T>, EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt is expected to announce as early as this week that the Trump administration plans to reopen a review of the fuel efficiency rules that could result in a reduction in requirements for automakers.

Ford's European credit arm considers adding German banking licence due to Brexit  - 路透新闻

{{20170307T143236.423+0000}}Ford's European credit arm considers adding German banking licence due to Brexit GENEVA, March 7 (Reuters) - Ford's European credit arm FCE said on Tuesday it was considering applying for a German banking licence alongside its current British one, because the future of passporting is uncertain after Britain leaves the European Union.

Passporting allows for any financial firm to serve the whole EU region from a single base, cutting costs and red tape.

"As the future of passporting is uncertain post-Brexit, FCE is conducting a detailed study with a view to potentially applying for a banking licence in Germany in addition to the licence we currently hold in the U.K.," an FCE spokeswoman said.

Stakes high as Geely's Volvo replaces best-selling SUV - 路透新闻

{{20170307T100005.227+0000}}Stakes high as Geely's Volvo replaces best-selling SUVGENEVA, March 7 (Reuters) - Volvo Car Group unveiled its new XC60 SUV at the Geneva auto show on Tuesday, the latest launch in a sweeping overhaul of its model line-up under Chinese ownership that will be key to driving sales and earnings ahead of a possible listing.

Despite being launched almost a decade ago, the original XC60 has remained popular among buyers and been the automaker's best-selling model since 2009.

It accounts for roughly a third of Volvo's sales, leaving the new model with big shoes to fill as the carmaker looks to expand its niche in a premium market dominated by larger players such as Daimler's Mercedes-Benz and BMW .

"The XC60 is in one of the hottest premium segments globally, so getting the execution and launch right is imperative for the growth of the brand," said Bill Rinna, senior manager for North American forecasts at consultancy LMC Automotive.

"Globally, we expect the new XC60 to sell 175,000 units annually. Its two main competitors are not standing still however, as both the Audi Q5 and BMW X3 have or will be getting updates of their own."

Volvo sold just over 161,000 XC60s last year.

Over the past couple of years, the company has begun delivering new models developed since its purchase by China's Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co. from Ford Motor Co. in 2010, including the larger XC90 SUV and a new 90-series.

Volvo is banking on a joint platform developed under Geely's ownership for all but its smallest models - key to keeping down costs and improving flexibility for a small carmaker like Volvo.

Later this year, it is also launching the XC40 compact SUV, aiming to further capitalise on a strong market for SUVs.

"Now we are really entering into a segment that should deliver volume," Volvo Car Group Chief Executive Hakan Samuelsson told reporters.

"Before the end of the year we will have the biggest line-up of SUVs we've ever had."

After struggling under Ford, sales at one of Sweden's largest companies by sales and staff have risen sharply, hitting a record 534,332 cars last year.

Samuelsson has said he expects another record in 2017, the fourth straight if achieved, on the way to an annual target of 800,000 cars in the medium term.

Volvo has also taken steps toward a possible listing, raising 5 billion crowns ($557 million) through the sale of newly issued preference shares, though Samuelsson has said any flotation is a question for its owner. [nL5N1EF0ZW]

The new XC60 will be delivered with a range of powertrains, including a plug-in hybrid version, with production set to begin in mid-April at the carmaker's plant in Torslanda, on the outskirts of Gothenburg in western Sweden.

A semi-autonomous driver assistance system, which handles steering, acceleration and braking on well-marked roads at speeds up to 130 kilometres per hour, will be available as an option, it added.

($1 = 8.9834 Swedish crowns)

INTERVIEW-Tariff-free Brexit 'really important' for Ford's UK jobs  - 路透新闻

{{20170307T074659.665+0000}}INTERVIEW-Tariff-free Brexit 'really important' for Ford's UK jobs By Costas Pitas

GENEVA, March 7 (Reuters) - Tariff-free trade after Brexit is vitally important to maintaining jobs at Ford's British sites, its European boss told Reuters on Tuesday, amid growing concerns among unions about jobs losses at the U.S. carmaker's Welsh engine plant.

Ford, Britain's biggest automotive engine builder, said last year it was scaling back investment at the plant in Bridgend due to lower than anticipated demand for one of its petrol engines.

Last week, unions said Ford planned to axe 1,100 jobs at the site despite the U.S. carmaker saying there were no immediate plans for cuts.

Ford has denied Britain's decision to leave the European Union is a factor in the scaled back investment, but unions say uncertainty over the future trading relationship with the EU is harming the country's car industry.

Ford of Europe president Jim Farley told Reuters barrier-free trade was essential to protecting the firm's more than 14,000 British workers.

"For the future of those employees and for customers in the UK, a zero-tariff environment is really, really important," he said during an interview at the Geneva motor show.

"We will continue to insist that a zero-tariff environment is key for the future of those employees at Ford."

Ford's British-built engines could face tariffs of up to 2.7 percent, while vehicle imports could be hit by tariffs of up to 10 percent if Britain were to return to World Trade Organization trading rules.

BREAKINGVIEWS-Virtual-reality hype fades, 3D printing solidifies - 路透新闻

{{20170306T202017.160+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-Virtual-reality hype fades, 3D printing solidifies(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.)

By Robert Cyran

NEW YORK, March 6 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Virtual-reality hype is fading while 3D printing solidifies. Tepid sales, legal questions and immature technology are putting dreams of imminent immersive digital worlds on the back shelf. Meanwhile, steady progress is burning away disillusionment over digital manufacturing to order. Monday's announcement by Ford Motor to explore building large-scale car parts highlights the trend.

Creating new digital worlds is a seductive vision. Existing games and movies would seem flat and lifeless in comparison. Imposing digital images on the real world has more applications, ranging from improved IKEA couch assembly instructions to travelers seeing signs in their mother tongue.

That dream led Facebook to pay $3 billion in 2014 for headset-maker Oculus. Venture capitalists competed to inject $1.4 billion into Magic Leap, a $4.5 billion valued firm located in tech cold spot south Florida. And numerous electronics makers have rolled out gear.

The hangover is now hitting. While devices are no longer rare – Samsung <005930.KS> said earlier this year it has sold 5 million Gear headsets so far – that's a glacial pace compared to consumers' smartphone-adoption rate. There is little software available and the technology is a work in progress. Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg said recently it would take 10 years before virtual reality "gets to where we all want to go." Magic Leap has been dogged by questions of how real its virtual technology is. And intellectual property is a thorny question after Facebook and Oculus executives lost a $500 million lawsuit.

3D printing faced a similar boom and bust a few years ago. Companies like Stratasys and 3D Systems saw their valuations rocket as speculators fantasized of every household having a device to turn digital files into real-world objects. These stocks lost 85 percent of their value when consumers realized home printers were mostly useful for producing plastic knick-knacks.

Yet rapidly falling costs and steadily rising abilities are propelling additive manufacturing on the factory floor. Companies have long used 3D printing to rapidly make prototypes. Manufacturers are starting to use the technology to quickly make customized or small runs of items, cutting down on shipping costs while minimizing inventory. Ford on Monday joined Nike , Daimler and General Electric in the club.

The global market as a whole is still small – perhaps $5 billion annually according to Deloitte. This figure will surge, as 3D printing turns manufacturing into a more customized endeavor. For now, it's a triumph of matter over virtual mind.

CONTEXT NEWS

- Ford Motor said on March 6 it was testing 3D printing of large-scale car parts. The auto company is exploring applications for future production vehicles, as well as personalized car parts.

- Last summer, Daimler – the world's largest producer of trucks – said it would print spare parts including spring caps, air and cable ducts, clamps, mountings and control elements using 3D printing.

Honda to begin U.S. production of new 10-speed transmission - 路透新闻

{{20170306T201500.843+0000}}Honda to begin U.S. production of new 10-speed transmissionMarch 6 (Reuters) - Honda Motor Co Ltd <7267.T> said on Monday it had invested nearly $150 million in two U.S. plants for making 10-speed automatic transmission for front-wheel-drive vehicles.

The investment includes $100 million for a new assembly line and production modifications at Honda Precision Parts of Georgia LLC in Tallapoosa, Georgia, the Japanese automaker said. http://bit.ly/2mf9ny3

The company will invest $49 million in Honda Transmission Mfg. of America Inc in Russells Point, Ohio to provide new equipment and increased production capacity, Honda said.

"The new automatic transmission will go first into the 2018 Honda Odyssey," a Honda spokesman said, adding that other models to get the transmission are yet to be revealed.

Ford Motor Co and Detroit rival General Motors Co jointly developed a ten-speed automatic transmission that has recently been introduced on several U.S. rear-wheel-drive models, including the 2017 Ford F-150 pickup truck and the 2017 Chevrolet Camaro sports car.

VW to unveil self-driving car as part of post-dieselgate shift - 路透新闻

{{20170306T180001.154+0000}}VW to unveil self-driving car as part of post-dieselgate shiftGENEVA, March 6 (Reuters) - Volkswagen will show off a fully self-driving car at the Geneva auto show, as part of the German carmaker's drive to be at the forefront of new technologies in the wake of its diesel emissions scandal.

Europe's biggest carmaker has said it will invest billions of euros in electric cars, ride-hailing and automated driving, and launch over 30 electric models by 2025 as it battles to recover from its emissions test cheating. [nL8N1982BT]

The self-driving concept car called Sedric - a so-called Level 5 vehicle capable of fully automated operation - is a precursor for more such models from the Volkswagen (VW) group in years to come, Chief Executive Matthias Mueller said on Monday on the eve of car executives' annual gathering in Geneva.

VW is hiring top specialists and plans to spend several billions of euros on automated driving alone, Mueller said, without being more specific.

Sedric can carry 4 passengers and could be used for ride-sharing fleets as well as for individual consumers, VW said.

Internet giant Google was a forerunner in self-driving technology with its 2015 prototype vehicle, but has since been challenged by companies ranging from Uber [UBER.UL] to Apple , as well as traditional carmakers.

Manufacturers and their suppliers are working on different technology suites - including cameras, radar and laser imaging technology lidar - to enable vehicles to drive themselves, but it will take years for these vehicles to come to market.

Mercedes-Benz unveiled its fully autonomous F 015 luxury concept two years ago. But Toyota <7203.T> has said it does not expect to see Level 5 cars in widespread use for another 10-15 years, while Ford does not plan to offer such vehicles for consumers until 2025 or later.

UPDATE 1-GM shifts from bigger is better to less global, more profitable - 路透新闻

{{20170306T153919.094+0000}}UPDATE 1-GM shifts from bigger is better to less global, more profitable(Adds GM CEO comments)

By Joseph White

DETROIT, March 6 (Reuters) - General Motors Co's deal on Monday to sell its European operations to France's PSA Group doubles down on a bet that the company can win by being less global but more profitable in an auto industry increasingly dependent on software and services.

Without the German Opel and British Vauxhall brands, GM last year would have sold about 8.8 million vehicles, far behind Germany's Volkswagen AG and Japan's Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T> in the race to be the world's largest automaker.

Opel and Vauxhall combined sold nearly 1.2 million vehicles and generated $18.7 billion in revenue in 2016, about 11 percent of GM's total.

However, all of GM's activity in Europe - the investments in new model designs and cleaner engines, the efforts to make factories more efficient and the wages paid to 38,000 employees - has generated nothing but losses since 1999.

GM said on Monday that if it had not had Opel last year and had instead used the $2 billion shedding the unit will free up from its cash reserves to buy back stock, earnings per share would have risen 5 percent, even though revenue would have been 10 percent lower.

Meanwhile, business in North America has boomed. GM's home market operations were reborn as a smaller company due in part to the U.S. government-led bankruptcy in 2009, with fewer brands, fewer dealers, fewer employees and far less money owed to creditors and retirees.

Since 2009, cheap gasoline has powered a boom in sales of high-profit pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles, lifting GM's North American pretax profit margins to just above 10 percent in 2016.

To keep the North American profit machine revved up, GM must invest in new SUVs and trucks, as well as expensive technology to enable them to meet rising federal fuel economy targets.

Europe is demanding cleaner cars, too. But far less of the technology GM would buy to clean up European diesels and tiny gasoline engines would be useful in the United States, where larger gasoline engines – including eight-cylinder motors used in pickup trucks – dominate the market.

"Only 20 percent of the (European) portfolio overlapped with rest of General Motors' portfolio," Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra told analysts on Monday. That is why GM has concluded it cannot achieve significant economies of scale in emissions technology for Europe on its own.

PSA CEO Carlos Tavares is betting Opel's revenue and sales volume would help give his company, which makes Peugeot, Citroen and DS cars, an advantage against rivals such as Volkswagen and Renault SA . GM is in on that bet because it will receive warrants equivalent to a 4.2 percent non-voting stake in the French company. [nL5N1GG4YJ]

GM's decision to walk away from Western Europe highlights two other profound shifts since 2009, when the board scuttled a deal to sell Opel and Vauxhall to a group led by auto supplier Magna International and Russia's Sberbank.

The first is China, now the world's largest auto market, with roughly 28 million vehicles sold in 2016 and more growth forecast to come.

As China grows, GM will need to shift more vehicle engineering money and capital investment to feed that market, which could eventually replace much of the global sales volume sacrificed by the sale of Opel.

Buick, GM's primary brand in China, outsold Opel and Vauxhall in 2016. So did the Wuling brand of small commercial vehicles the company builds with partner Shanghai Automotive Industry Corp.

Also since 2009, automakers have begun racing to transform cars into electrified, intelligent devices that are paid for by the mile instead of purchased on installment plans.

Asked last month whether GM needed more radical restructuring to lift its share price, Barra said "the way that we are investing in the future, which I think is a huge opportunity, with transportation-as-a-service" and "the opportunity that technology has to transform this industry" could change how the company is valued.

GM does not need factories in Europe to offer ride services there, she said.

However, investors have not changed their views yet. Gary Silberg, head of KPMG's Americas automotive practice, said Silicon Valley companies such as Alphabet Inc and ride services leader Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] had the edge in the digital systems and the people needed to work with the terabytes of data required to make a car drive itself.

"The war for talent is absolutely essential to winning in the marketplace," Silberg said. And those adept in artificial intelligence systems "are not going to work for the auto industry."

GM demonstrated the industry's new economics last year when it agreed to pay $500 million, and potentially more, for tiny San Francisco robotic driving technology startup Cruise Automation. Ford Motor Co followed suit with a $1 billion deal to bring aboard and fund the future work of robotic vehicle startup Argo AI. [nL3N14O3VA] [nL1N1FV1FS]

GM's Barra has promised investors returns of 20 percent or more. The company said on Monday that after completing the European sale, it would have $2 billion to accelerate share repurchases, and capital spending would be reduced by about $1 billion a year.

The pressure on GM to deliver high returns to shareholders forces tough decisions, Barra and other senior GM executives have said. The decision to abandon Opel after nearly 80 years is the most momentous yet, and the success or failure of that bet could define her legacy.

"The war for talent is absolutely essential to winning in the market place," Silberg said. And those adept in artificial intelligence systems "are not going to work for the auto industry."

GM's Barra has told investors that GM would deliver 20 percent or better returns on invested capital, and hold capital spending roughly flat with current levels of $9 billion a year, putting extra cash into share buybacks.

Those constraints on capital force tough decisions, Barra and other senior GM executives have said. The decision to abandon Opel after nearly 80 years is the most momentous yet, and the success or failure of the bet could define Barra's legacy.

UK new car sales dip in February, pickup seen in March-SMMT - 路透新闻

{{20170306T091831.499+0000}}UK new car sales dip in February, pickup seen in March-SMMTLONDON, March 6 (Reuters) - British new car registrations fell by an annual 0.3 percent to 83,115 units in February, driven down by weaker demand from individuals and companies, but sales are expected to pick up in March, a car industry body said on Monday.

Private demand fell 4.4 percent to 36,018 units and business registrations declined 5.3 percent to 1,398 units. Fleet sales, typically to car rentals firms, rose 3.3 percent to 45,699 cars, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said.

Analysts predict the British car market, Europe's second largest, will shrink by about 5 percent in 2017 after two years of record demand, due to the Brexit-related fall in the pound pushing up the price of some models and wider economic uncertainty linked to Britain's split from the European Union.

Over the first two months of the year, registrations were up 1.8 percent at 257,679, SMMT said.

February is one of the quietest months of the year for the car market and SMMT Chief Executive Mike Hawes said he expected a bounce in March with the launch of 2017 number plates.

UPDATE 2-U.S. EPA expected to reopen vehicle emissions decision -source - 路透新闻

{{20170303T220732.786+0000}}UPDATE 2-U.S. EPA expected to reopen vehicle emissions decision -source(Adds GM CEO, environmental groups' reaction)

By David Shepardson

March 3 (Reuters) - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is expected to announce next week it would reopen a review of 2022-2025 vehicle emissions requirements after automakers urged the Trump administration to reverse a decision under former President Barack Obama, a source said on Friday.

Last week, trade groups representing General Motors Co , Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T>, Volkswagen AG , Ford Motor Co , Honda Motor Co <7267.T> and others formally asked new EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt to withdraw an Obama administration decision to lock in vehicle emission rules through 2025.

A person briefed on the matter who had seen the draft order restarting the review said it was expected to be unveiled next week. The source was not authorized to discuss contents of the order publicly.

The EPA notice is expected to say that the agency plans to work in tandem with the U.S. Transportation Department to set consistent standards for corporate average fuel efficiency and emissions limits, the source said.

A White House spokeswoman and an EPA spokesman declined to comment.

The EPA had until April 2018 to decide whether the 2022-2025 standards were feasible under a "midterm review" but in November moved up its decision to Jan. 13, just before Obama left office.

The auto group requests follow a separate letter to President Donald Trump earlier this month from the chief executives of GM, Ford Motor Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV , along with the top North American executives at Toyota, VW, Honda, Hyundai Motor Co <005380.KS>, Nissan Motor Co Ltd <7201.T> and others urging Trump to revisit the decision.

GM CEO Mary Barra told reporters on Tuesday that automakers were "looking to actually have the midterm review." She said the review needs to look "at all the different dynamics that are occurring."

Automakers say the rules impose significant costs and are out of step with consumer preferences. Environmentalists say the rules save drivers fuel costs and should not be changed.

In 2011, Obama announced an agreement with automakers to raise fuel efficiency standards to a fleet average of 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025. This, the administration said, would save motorists $1.7 trillion in fuel costs over the life of the vehicles but cost the auto industry about $200 billion over 13 years.

In July, EPA said because Americans were buying fewer cars and more SUVs and trucks, it now estimated the fleet will average 50.8 mpg to 52.6 mpg in 2025.

Earlier Friday, eight environmental organizations urged Pruitt not to reopen the issue. These included the Sierra Club, Union of Concerned Scientists, League of Conservation Voters and Natural Resources Defense Council.

"EPA should stay the course and look to the future, to protect our climate and the workers developing clean car technologies," council President Rhea Suh said in a statement.

NAFTA needs to be modernized - Mexican economy minister - 路透新闻

{{20170303T184038.717+0000}}NAFTA needs to be modernized - Mexican economy ministerDETROIT, March 3 (Reuters) - Mexico is prepared to negotiate changes to the North American Free Trade Agreement to modernize the 23-year-old open trade pact grouping the United States, Canada and Mexico, Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo said on Friday.

Guajardo said Mexico is prepared to discuss with the Trump administration and Canada revisions to NAFTA, such as including labor and environmental standards. Mexico "is willing to modernize NAFTA," he said.

However, Guajardo said Mexico will not accept tariffs. U.S. President Donald Trump has called for new border taxes on Mexican-made goods. "It makes no sense to introduce an agreement with border restrictions or tariffs," he said.

UPDATE 2-Mexico economy minister to meet with Ford, GM in Detroit - 路透新闻

{{20170303T005335.670+0000}}UPDATE 2-Mexico economy minister to meet with Ford, GM in Detroit(Adds details on last week's meeting, context)

MEXICO CITY, March 2 (Reuters) - Mexico's economy minister will travel to Detroit on Friday to meet with executives from automakers Ford Motor Co and General Motors Co , keeping a frenetic pace of meetings to deter President Donald Trump from punishing Mexican exports.

Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo will also meet with auto parts makers that have operations in Detroit and Mexico, the ministry said. He will discuss the state of U.S.-Mexico trade and the future of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).

Trump has vowed to exit NAFTA, the 1994 trade accord that also includes Canada, if he cannot get better terms for the United States. He has also drawn up plans to build a wall on the U.S. southern border and tax Mexican-made goods heading north to pay for it.

Wary of Trump's unpredictability, Mexico is not counting on talks with the White House to save it from a possible trade war. Instead, it hopes to build support among companies and U.S. states that most rely on business south of the border to pressure the president not to resort to drastic measures.

On Tuesday, Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray said Mexico would only stay in NAFTA if it suited the nation and he rejected the imposition of any tariffs or quotas. The countries have yet to start formal negotiations. [nL2N1GD1WQ]

"Thanks to NAFTA, Mexico and Michigan have built a dynamic trade relationship," the ministry said, noting that Mexico was Michigan's second biggest trade partner with more than $12 billion in exports to Mexico last year.

The United States sent its top diplomat Rex Tillerson and Department of Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly to Mexico City last week to tend to ties badly bruised by Trump's threats about NAFTA, the border wall and Mexican immigrants.

Their efforts were set back when Trump described deportations as "a military operation," forcing Kelly to make a public clarification.

One person familiar with the events said news of Trump's comments came just as Kelly and Tillerson were meeting with their counterparts, underscoring what Mexican officials see as the dangers of negotiating with the U.S. administration.

To calm the waters, the U.S. officials decided to add the clarification to Kelly's press statement after the meetings, the source said.

Job losses, low wages add to Venezuela economic hardship - 路透新闻

{{20170302T153709.120+0000}}Job losses, low wages add to Venezuela economic hardshipBy Eyanir Chinea

CARACAS, March 2 (Reuters) - On a recent morning, Venezuelan mother Rossana Suarez took her three children to work with her because school was canceled.

In an unfortunate twist, they would witness her being dismissed as a receptionist for a medical equipment company and joining the growing ranks of Venezuelans without formal employment.

"They did not give a reason. I swallowed hard and told my children not to cry," Suarez, 36, said under the midday sun outside an office of the Labor Ministry in Caracas where she and dozens of others waited from before dawn to lodge complaints.

"My oldest daughter asked me, 'Mom, how are we going to eat? You're the only one who works at home.'"

Multiple companies - local and foreign - are closing doors or cutting payrolls across Venezuela, which despite its oil wealth is suffering deep recession, triple-digit inflation and chronic shortages. [nL1N1CY13F]

According to Consecomercio, a major retail industry group, Venezuela in the past 18 months lost close to 1 million private sector jobs.

"Who is creating jobs? Nobody," said Consecomercio Vice President Alfonso Riera. "That unemployed population unfortunately is migrating to the street, informal work or worse."

Government critics say nationalizations of businesses and more than a decade of price and currency controls have crippled private enterprise, but President Nicolas Maduro says Venezuela is a victim of an "economic war" led by business leaders with U.S. help.

Venezuela has not reported official unemployment figures since April 2016, when the rate was at 7.3 percent.

A survey by three universities showed unemployment at the end of 2016 remained at that level. But the study also found 38 percent of those surveyed were working informal jobs ranging from buying and reselling goods to freelance work without benefits.

Only 28 percent said they were public employees and 27 percent had a job in the private sector.

Late socialist leader Hugo Chavez reformed labor regulations to reduce hours, extend maternity leave and make dismissals almost impossible. Maduro, his successor and a former union activist, has continued that.

Union sources said major companies such as food and beermaker Polar, carmaker Ford and bottler Cola-Cola Femsa all are reducing their workforce by negotiating redundancies and offering employees buyouts.

"People are taking the packages," said Jhonny Magdaleno, who leads a Polar union. He said workers were being offered the equivalent of $2,500 at the black market exchange rate.

"Production has fallen too much," he said. "The workers who are left are making 4,000 bolivars weekly ($1 at the black market rate). That doesn't even enable them to buy a pack of flour."

UPDATE 1-South Africa's consumer watchdog to probe Ford after Kuga recall - 路透新闻

{{20170302T081250.495+0000}}UPDATE 1-South Africa's consumer watchdog to probe Ford after Kuga recall(Adds Ford comment)

JOHANNESBURG, March 2 (Reuters) - South Africa's National Consumer Commission (NCC) said it has launched a probe into the local unit of U.S. automaker Ford over the recall of 4,500 Kuga SUVs after dozens of reports of the vehicles catching fire spontaneously.

Ford's Southern Africa President and chief executive Jeff Nemeth in January said the company could confirm 39 incidents of the cars catching fire, as well as one death, which Nemeth said was not directly linked to the defect.

Ford's South African unit said the company, a unit of the U.S. auto-maker Ford , would cooperate with the probe.

"The National Consumer Commission says that it has instituted an investigation into the activities of Ford Motor Company Southern Africa and its dealerships, for alleged prohibited conduct," the commission said in a statement seen on its website on Thursday.

"The NCC received more than 130 complaints against Ford SA relating to various issues, including the combusting of Kuga vehicles, since December last year," it said.

A spokeswoman for Ford's Southern Africa unit, Rella Bernardes said the firm had followed safety guidelines.

"We have received the notice from the NCC and will continue to fully cooperate with them on all fronts. At all times, we operate in line with the Safety Recall Guidelines in terms of the Consumer Protection Act, 2008," she said in a statement.

Overview

Ford Motor Co expects to axe over 1,100 jobs at its engine plant in Bridgend, Wales, in a five-year plan for the plant that makes small petrol engines for Ford, as well as more-powerful V6 and V8 engines for Jaguar Land Rover.

High inflation, slow wage growth and austerity measures during the next five years are likely to increase inequality in UK, the Institute for Fiscal Studies said on Thursday.

Investors in planned stock market flotations will get independent research about the company sooner under proposals made by Britain's Financial Conduct Authority on Wednesday.

British MPs from the foreign affairs committee called for a reappraisal of relations with Moscow, saying Britain should stop accusing Russia of war crimes in Syria, according to a report published by the committee on Thursday.

UPDATE 2-Automakers notch 3.2 pct gain in Canada sales in February - 路透新闻

{{20170301T222853.810+0000}}UPDATE 2-Automakers notch 3.2 pct gain in Canada sales in February(Adds comment, details from industry analyst)

By Alastair Sharp

TORONTO, March 1 (Reuters) - Automakers broadly notched decent growth in Canadian sales in February, data released by the companies and collated by an industry group showed on Wednesday, as growth in truck sales offset a slowdown in passenger car purchases.

The industry sold 123,032 new light vehicles in the month, a 3.2 percent gain from a year ago and a record for overall February sales, according to DesRosiers Automotive Consultants.

"2017 is off to a strong start," the industry analysts wrote, noting that truck sales grew 5.2 percent while passenger car sales slipped 2.1 percent.

Truck sales were a particular source of strength for Ford Motor Co , while fleet sales boosted overall numbers for Fiat Chrysler Automobiles , the automakers said in separate statements.

General Motors Co said it delivered 16,528 vehicles across its Chevrolet, Buick, GMC and Cadillac brands in the month, a 5 percent increase from a year earlier.

Ford said it sold 18,985 vehicles in Canada in the month, its best February performance since 2000 and a 3.2 percent increase from the 18,403 it sold in the same month a year ago.

That included 16,800 truck sales, with its popular F-Series notching its best-ever February sales, the company said in a statement.

Chrysler said it sold 19,115 vehicles in the month, a 2 percent increase from a year ago, with higher fleet sales helping offset a slip in retail activity.

Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T> said its total vehicle sales slipped 6.2 percent to 13,405, although sales of its higher-end Lexus and mainstay Corolla both jumped significantly.

Sales numbers rose for Honda Motor Co Ltd <7267.T> and Nissan Motor Co Ltd <7201.T> and slipped for Hyundai Motor Co <005380.KS> and Mitsubishi Motors Corp <7211.T>, DesRosiers said.

After several years of record vehicle sales in Canada and Mexico, purchases are expected to edge lower in 2017, according to Scotiabank analyst Carlos Gomes.

U.S. auto sales fell slightly in the month even as automakers stepped up discounting to sustain sales, major manufacturers reported on Wednesday. [nL2N1GE0OQ]

UPDATE 2-U.S. truck, SUV sales stay strong in February, but at a price - 路透新闻

{{20170301T213653.989+0000}}UPDATE 2-U.S. truck, SUV sales stay strong in February, but at a price(Adds final annualized selling pace; updated figures for SUV and pickup sales)

By Bernie Woodall and Nick Carey

DETROIT, March 1 (Reuters) - February U.S. auto sales, an indicator of consumer spending, fell slightly even as automakers stepped up discounting to sustain sales, major manufacturers reported on Wednesday.

Demand for cars, sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks in February dipped to an annualized pace of 17.6 million vehicles, compared with a robust 17.7 million a year earlier, according to Autodata Corp. [nL3N1GE5ZZ]

Shares of Detroit automakers General Motors Co , Ford Motor Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV all rose as the broader market surged more than 1 percent [.N].

However, analysts pointed to caution flags in the latest results, including discounts that hit 10 percent of the average selling price for February, according to three companies that track vehicle pricing.

"With the industry at 10 percent you are in a push market," said Mark Wakefield, head of the North American automotive practice for consultancy AlixPartners. "This is top cycle stuff." In a push market, manufacturers try to unload vehicles, rather than respond to the pull of consumer demand.

The challenge now for automakers is to avoid over-producing vehicles or launching a price war that could undermine profits, especially as rising interest rates make it more expensive to subsidize loans and leases, Wakefield said.

"It's that fine balance," he said. "How much can I push the boundary without prompting a reaction that pulls all of us down?"

The tension surfaced in another round of sniping on Wednesday between GM and Ford over which one was more dependent on discounts to prop up pickup truck sales.

On the plus side for automakers, U.S. consumers continued buying more SUVs and pickups, which generate higher profits.

Light trucks accounted for 62 percent of light vehicle sales in February. In 2016, that split was 59.5 percent in favor of trucks and SUVs, according to Autodata Corp. Over a full year, that shift would mean roughly two assembly plants' worth of cars had been replaced by SUVs or trucks.

February sales were mixed for the major automakers. GM beat most analysts' expectations with a 4.2 percent gain in new vehicle sales.

Ford sales declined by 4 percent, with its F-Series pickup trucks up 9 percent, SUVs rising 6 percent but cars sliding 24 percent from a year ago, the automaker said.

Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T>, No. 3 in U.S. sales volume, suffered a 7.2 percent drop as sales of the company's best-selling model, the Camry sedan, dropped 15 percent.

Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV sales fell 10 percent, as its largest-volume Jeep SUV brand dropped 15 percent.

Nissan Motor Co <7201.T> beat expectations on a 3.5 percent gain, led by a 54 percent surge for its Rogue small SUV.

Honda Motor Co <7267.T> sales rose 2.6 percent, helped by its trucks and SUVs, gaining 12 percent from a year earlier.

Ford, Fiat-Chrysler report higher February sales in Canada - 路透新闻

{{20170301T184755.073+0000}}Ford, Fiat-Chrysler report higher February sales in CanadaTORONTO, March 1 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles on Wednesday reported higher Canadian sales for February, with truck sales a particular strength for Ford and fleet sales boosting Chrysler's numbers.

Ford said it sold 18,985 vehicles in Canada in the month, its best February performance since 2000 and a 3.2 percent increase from the 18,403 it sold in the same month a year ago.

That included 16,800 truck sales, with its F-Series notching its best ever February sales, the company said in a statement.

Chrysler said it sold 19,115 vehicles in the month, a 2 percent increase from a year ago, with higher fleet sales helping offset a slip in retail activity.

After several years of record vehicle sales in Canada and Mexico, purchases are expected to edge lower in 2017, according to Scotiabank analyst Carlos Gomes.

U.S. auto sales fell slightly in February but remained strong as pickup trucks and SUVs continued a robust showing, based on the first three automakers to report monthly numbers on Wednesday. [nL2N1GE0OQ]

UPDATE 1-UK unions say Ford to axe 1,100 jobs at Welsh engine plant - 路透新闻

{{20170301T171611.347+0000}}UPDATE 1-UK unions say Ford to axe 1,100 jobs at Welsh engine plant(Updates after Ford meeting with unions)

LONDON, March 1 (Reuters) - Ford plans to axe 1,100 jobs at its engine plant in Wales, trade unions said on Wednesday, although the U.S. carmaker said there were no immediate plans for cuts nor had it confirmed any future losses.

Ford, the biggest maker of automotive engines in Britain, said last year it was scaling back investment due to lower than anticipated demand for one of its petrol engines but was not planning significant cuts.

However, the GMB and Unite unions said company bosses had confirmed in meetings on Wednesday that about 1,100 jobs would be lost over a five-year period, leaving a workforce of just 600 remaining on the Welsh site at Bridgend.

"The nightmare for our members at Bridgend has unfortunately come true," said Jeff Beck of the GMB. "This is a real kick in the teeth for our hard-working members at the Ford plant – as well as their families and the community as a whole."

Both unions said they would consult with their members and did not rule out strike action.

However, Ford, which made around a third of Britain's total output of 2.4 million engines at Bridgend in 2015, disputed the unions' statement.

"That's not correct. We're not in a position to confirm any job losses. We're certainly several years away from that," a Ford spokeswoman said. "We're proposing a joint working party with the Unite and GMB to identify future business needs.

"Demand is healthy and occupies the current workforce for the next two to three years. Beyond that we do see reduction in the forecasts, hence that's why we announced back in September that we are reducing the initial investment."

Unite's general secretary Len McCluskey called on the British government to intervene, and Prime Minister Theresa May said earlier on Wednesday that ministers would hold regular talks with Ford to make sure they could maintain the car producer's "success" in Britain after leaving the European Union. [nS8N1EY00Z]

"Ministers in this government have been engaging with various companies within the automotive sector, including Ford," May told parliament.

"We have had dialogue with Ford, we will continue to have a regular dialogue with Ford about the ways in which government can help to make sure that this success continues."

On Tuesday, Japanese carmaker Nissan <7201.T> said May's government had to come up "with a lot of different solutions" to ensure that Britain's automotive industry would remain competitive after the country left the EU.

It has said it would re-examine its investment strategy once the terms of Brexit become clear. [nL5N1GD4CQ]

GM, Ford beat February sales expectations; industry sales seen down - 路透新闻

{{20170301T150838.745+0000}}GM, Ford beat February sales expectations; industry sales seen downBy Bernie Woodall and Nick Carey

DETROIT, March 1 (Reuters) - February U.S. auto sales, an early-month indicator of consumer spending, fell slightly but remained strong as pickup trucks and SUVs continued a robust showing based on the first three automakers that reported on Wednesday.

General Motors Co , the top automaker in the U.S. market by sales, said the industry will show a 1 percent decline but still post a robust 17.5 million in sales on a seasonally adjusted annualized basis. That is less than the 17.7 million expected by 38 economists polled by Thomson Reuters.

GM beat most analysts' expectations with a 4.2 percent gain in new vehicle sales.

Ford Motor Co , No. 2 in the U.S. market by sales, said sales declined by 4 percent, but still beat most analysts' expectations. Sales for its F-Series pickup trucks rose 9 percent, SUVs were up 6 percent but car sales fell 24 percent from a year ago, the automaker said.

Nissan Motor Co <7201.T> also beat expectations, showing a 3.5 percent gain, led by a 54 percent surge for its Rogue small SUV.

Consumer discounts, which cut into corporate profits, rose in February, third-party industry watchers said, but the average new car selling price also was higher.

However, J.D. Power pointed out that the percentage of consumer discounts to the average selling price was 10.3 percent. It was the first time the measure topped 10 percent in February since the industry's worst year in 2009, J.D. Power said.

GM said retail sales for trucks and crossovers were up 18 percent and 15 percent, respectively. For its primary pickup, the Chevrolet Silverado, total and retail sales both jumped 17 percent, its best showing in February since 2007.

UK PM May says government is talking to Ford on automotive sector  - 路透新闻

{{20170301T125808.315+0000}}UK PM May says government is talking to Ford on automotive sector LONDON, March 1 (Reuters) - Prime Minister Theresa May said on Wednesday her government would hold regular talks with Ford to find ways to ensure its engine plant in Wales remains part of the car producer's "success" in Britain after leaving the European Union.

"Ministers in this government have been engaging with various companies within the automotive sector, including Ford and other companies," she told parliament.

"We now account for around a third of Ford's global engine production and Bridgend (engine plant) continues to be an important part of that. We have had dialogue with Ford, we will continue to have a regular dialogue with Ford about the ways in which government can help to make sure that this success continues."

UK union fears for jobs at Ford's Welsh engine plant  - 路透新闻

{{20170301T100634.567+0000}}UK union fears for jobs at Ford's Welsh engine plant LONDON, March 1 (Reuters) - Britain's biggest trade union fears that more than 1,000 jobs could be lost at Ford's engine plant in Wales despite reassurances from the U.S. carmaker that similar levels of employment will be needed in the coming years.

Ford, Britain's biggest engine builder, said last year it was scaling back investment due to lower than anticipated demand for one of its petrol engines, prompting the Unite union to call on the firm to provide a plan for how it would maintain output.

"It is our belief that... there is no future business plan for the plant, that our concerns are going to be realised, that two thirds of the plant, that's at least 1,160 jobs will be at risk," Andy Richards, Unite's Welsh Secretary told the BBC.

A spokesman at Ford told Reuters that the firm, which made around one third of Britain's total output of 2.4 million engines at Bridgend in 2015, was not planning significant cuts.

"The anticipated production volume of engines from Bridgend remains healthy in the upcoming years, with associated labour requirements expected to be similar to today's level," he said.

A meeting is due to take place on Wednesday between Ford and the unions, Richards told the BBC.

UPDATE 1-German automakers top U.S. magazine brand rankings - 路透新闻

{{20170301T010815.657+0000}}UPDATE 1-German automakers top U.S. magazine brand rankings(Adds Fiat Chrysler reaction)

By David Shepardson

WASHINGTON, Feb 28 (Reuters) - German automakers dominated
Consumer Reports' annual ranking of automotive brands released
on Tuesday, with Volkswagen AG's  Audi 
leading the pack, while U.S. brands continued to lag despite
gains for many.

Jake Fisher, director of auto testing at the magazine, said
German automakers rose largely due to improvements in
reliability. "Building one or two great vehicles is achievable,
but making a whole lineup of excellent ones is much more
difficult," Fisher said.

Volkswagen's Porsche unit and rival BMW AG  came in
second and third. General Motors Co's  Buick brand was the
highest-ranked U.S. mainstream brand in 10th, down from seventh
in 2016, while Ford Motor Co's namesake brand fell from 16th to
21th.

GM's Chevrolet brand moved up to 17th from 20th and its
Cadillac brand moved up to 18th from 24th.

Toyota Motor Corp's <7203.T> flagship brand fell from eighth
to 11th place, falling out of the top 10 for the first time in
recent years, after the magazine said its Tacoma pickup had
reliability issues.

Tesla Inc  was ranked eighth among auto brands after
previously not having enough models to be ranked.

Fiat Chrysler Automobiles'  Chrysler brand jumped
from 26th to 19th.

GM's Chevrolet Cruze was named best compact car, while its
Impala won best large sedan.

Other top picks included the Honda Ridgeline as best compact
pickup, Kia Optima best midsized sedan and Audi Q7 best luxury
SUV.

The Fiat brand remained last again among all brands rated,
and FCA's Jeep brand remained second-lowest overall. Consumer
Reports does not recommend any Fiat Chrysler vehicles, while it
recommends all Porsche, Mazda and BMW vehicles.

Fiat Chrysler said in a statement it welcomed feedback from
Consumer Reports "as it helps guide our product improvements."
The company added it is "aggressively pursuing both product and
launch-quality improvements."

Fisher said Fiat Chrysler models suffered from serious
reliability problems.

Brand           2017 rank             2016 rank

CORRECTED-COLUMN-Will Takata plea deal kill civil suits against automakers?: Frankel - 路透新闻

{{20170228T204238.985+0000}}CORRECTED-COLUMN-Will Takata plea deal kill civil suits against automakers?: Frankel(Corrects the figure in graf 7 from 8 million to 8 billion)

By Alison Frankel

NEW YORK, Feb 28 (Reuters) - Late this afternoon, the automakers Honda, Ford, Toyota, Nissan, Mazda and BMW will head to federal court in Miami to argue that a $1 billion plea agreement between the U.S. Justice Department and the airbag maker Takata Corporation should absolve them from liability for installing dangerous Takata airbags in tens of millions of cars sold in the U.S.

Takata admitted as part of the plea that it reported incorrect airbag test results to carmakers. So according to the automakers, they are properly viewed as victims of Takata's admittedly fraudulent scheme – not as perpetrators of their own deception of car buyers.

As my colleague Joe White has reported, Takata has agreed to set up an $850 million fund to compensate automakers for the cost of replacing recalled airbags. [nL2N1GC1E1]

Owners of the cars, who are suing the automakers for economic damages in consolidated litigation, have a rather different view of the implications of Takata's guilty plea, which was approved Monday by U.S. District Judge George Steeh of Detroit. Their lawyers, led by Peter Prieto of Podhurst Orseck, claim to have plenty of evidence that carmakers were independently aware of problems with Takata's airbags.

Takata's guilty plea, car owners argued in a status report filed Monday with U.S. District Judge Federico Moreno of Miami, proves nothing at all about what the carmakers themselves knew about flaws in the airbags, which were installed even after car owners began reporting dangerous ruptures.

"Despite this knowledge, the automotive defendants continued to equip their vehicles with Takata's ticking time bombs and misrepresent to the unsuspecting public that their vehicles were safe," car owners said in the status report.

BILLIONS AT STAKE

The dispute over the automakers' liability could be worth hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars. In addition to the cost of replacing faulty airbags – which could be nearly $8 billion, according to the judge who approved Takata's guilty plea - car owners contend Honda, Ford and the other carmakers owe them damages because car buyers overpaid for defective vehicles that have diminished in value.

Car owners also claimed in their latest consolidated complaint that they deserve punitive damages from automakers.

The automakers said in their status report to Miami judge Morena that Takata's admissions in its agreement with the Justice Department undermine car owners' claims for economic losses.

"The plea agreement confirms, among other things, that Takata engaged in a fraudulent scheme to keep the automotive defendants from knowing what Takata knew about the inflators and their potential to rupture," the carmakers said in a status report filed last week.

"Even before Takata's admission of guilt, plaintiffs had no way to prove they suffered actual economic loss, as the automotive defendants are offering, and will continue to offer, free replacements of recalled Takata inflators. In short, Takata's guilty plea makes the theory of plaintiffs' case even more implausible than it already was."

Plaintiffs' lawyers said in their retort Monday that Honda and the other carmakers had overstated the impact of the Takata plea deal, which, "neither excuses the automotive defendants' own reckless, deceptive conduct nor undermines the economic loss claims asserted against them."

The filing accused carmakers of opting to use Takata airbags to save time and money. In a response issued late Monday, Honda called the allegation that cost considerations led it to use a dangerous product "categorically false," adding that Takata's airbag components were not even consistently priced lower than those of competitors. (Honda also reiterated that Takata's guilty plea belies car owners' economic loss claims.)

"LIMITED" IMPACT?

Takata and its U.S. subsidiary, TK Holdings, meanwhile, argued in their status report to Judge Moreno that the parent corporation's admissions in its plea deal with the government should have "limited (if any) impact" on car owners' economic loss claims in the consolidated civil litigation.

As part of the plea deal, Takata agreed to establish a $125 million restitution fund for plaintiffs who were injured by defective airbags. Those claims are consolidated on a separate tracks from the economic loss claims.

Plaintiffs' lawyers in the civil litigation had theorized in a pair of filings Monday before the Detroit judge overseeing the Takata criminal case that the parent corporation would try to use the plea agreement to shield its U.S. subsidiary from liability for car owners' economic losses. Instead, Takata and its subsidiary urged Judge Moreno to dismiss economic loss claims against both of them.

At the moment, both sides' jockeying over the impact of the plea agreement is just posturing. All of the defendants have moved to dismiss the latest complaint by car owners. Those motions, which preceded the Takata plea deal, are pending before Judge Moreno. It's not clear, in other words, whether the judge will even consider Takata's admissions in deciding whether to keep the economic loss cases alive.

If plaintiffs survive dismissal motions, the automaker defendants may well ask the judge to grant them summary judgment based on Takata's guilty plea. Lead counsel Prieto seems to be already primed to respond.

"What the automakers knew and when they knew it is an issue of fact," he told me. "It's for the jury to decide."

German automakers top U.S. magazine brand rankings - 路透新闻

WASHINGTON, Feb 28 (Reuters) - German automakers dominated Consumer Reports' annual ranking of automotive brands released on Tuesday, with Volkswagen AG's Audi leading the pack, while U.S. brands continued to lag despite gains for many.

Jake Fisher, director of auto testing at the magazine, said German automakers rose largely due to improvements in reliability. "Building one or two great vehicles is achievable, but making a whole lineup of excellent ones is much more difficult," Fisher said.

Volkswagen's Porsche unit and rival BMW AG came in second and third. General Motors Co's Buick brand was the highest-ranked U.S. brand in 10th, down from seventh in 2016, while Ford Motor Co's Lincoln brand was 15th, up from 17th. The Ford brand fell from 16th to 21th.

GM's Chevrolet brand moved up to 17th from 20th and its Cadillac brand moved up to 18th from 24th.

Toyota Motor Corp's <7203.T> flagship brand fell from eighth to 11th place, falling out of the top 10 for the first time in recent years, after the magazine said its Tacoma pickup had reliability issues. Toyota's luxury Lexus unit fell from third to fourth.

Fuji Heavy Industries' <7270.T> Subaru unit fell from second to fifth, while Korean auto brand Kia jumped to sixth, up five spots, followed by Mazda Motor Corp <7261.T> in seventh.

Tesla Inc was ranked eighth among auto brands after previously not having enough models to be ranked. The California automaker was followed by Honda Motor Co's <7267.T> namesake brand in ninth.

Fiat Chrysler Automobiles' Chrysler brand jumped from 26th to 19th.

GM's Chevrolet Cruze was named best compact car, while its Impala won best large sedan.

Other top picks included the Honda Ridgeline as best compact pickup, Kia Optima best midsized sedan and Audi Q7 best luxury SUV.

Nissan Motor Co's <7201.T> luxury Infiniti brand moved up six spots to 16, while its Nissan brand fell one spot to 22.

Some German automakers struggled. The Volkswagen brand fell eight spots to 23rd and Daimler's Mercedes-Benz fell six spots to 20th.

The Fiat brand remained last again among all brands rated, and FCA's Jeep brand remained second-lowest overall. Consumer Reports does not recommend any Fiat Chrysler vehicles, while it recommends all Porsche, Mazda and BMW vehicles.

Fisher said Fiat Chrysler models suffered from serious reliability problems and are "not competitive" in most segments. The non-profit magazine has more than 8 million subscribers and surveys hundreds of thousands of car owners. Many shoppers consult the ratings, and automakers routinely tout favorable ratings in advertising.
