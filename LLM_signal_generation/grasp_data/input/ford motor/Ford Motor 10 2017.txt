WASHINGTON, Oct 27 (Reuters) - The U.S. National Highway Traffic-Safety Administration said Friday it is looking for input on how it can remove regulatory roadblocks to self-driving cars.

The auto safety agency said in a report that it wants to find any "unnecessary regulatory barriers" to self-driving cars "particularly those that are not equipped with controls for a human driver."

The agency also wants comments on what research it needs to conduct before deciding whether to eliminate or rewrite regulations. But it could take the agency years to complete the research and finalize rule changes, and advocates are pushing Congress to act.

NHTSA said in a statement it plans to issue a formal notice in the "near future requesting comment" on the hurdles. The agency hopes to make the notice public by the end of November.

Automakers must meet nearly 75 auto safety standards, many of which were written with the assumption that a licensed driver will be in control of the vehicle. The agency said last year that current regulations pose "significant" regulatory hurdles to vehicles without human controls.

In early October, a U.S. Senate committee unanimously gave the green light to a bill aimed at speeding the use of self-driving cars without human controls and would allow the agency to waive requirements.

General Motors Co , Alphabet Inc , Ford Motor Co and others have lobbied for the landmark legislation, while auto safety groups urged more safeguards and have pledged to keep fighting for changes.

The Senate Commerce Committee approved the bill, and the U.S. House passed a similar measure last month. Automakers would be able to win exemptions from NHTSA for safety rules for up to 80,000 vehicles annually within three years.

Under the Senate measure, NHTSA would have to write permanent rules on self-driving cars within a decade.

Ford's Argo self-driving unit buying lidar maker Princeton Lightwave - Reuters News

{{20171027T150001.021+0000}}Ford's Argo self-driving unit buying lidar maker Princeton LightwaveBy Paul Lienert

DETROIT, Oct 27 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co's Argo AI unit, which develops software for self-driving vehicles, is buying Princeton Lightwave, one of the oldest makers of lidar sensing devices that use laser light to help autonomous cars "see" nearby objects and obstacles.

Announcing the Princeton Lightwave acquisition in a blog post on Friday morning, Argo Chief Executive Officer Bryan Salesky said his company "won't be able to build" self-driving cars without lidar.

Argo wants to develop "affordable" lidar sensors with Princeton's help, he added.

The deal comes more than a year after Ford's $75 million investment in Velodyne, a better-known lidar startup whose sensor technology is still considered too expensive. [nL1N1AX0P0]

Argo did not disclose terms of the Princeton Lightwave deal.

Founded in 2000, New Jersey-based Princeton Lightwave is one of more than 20 global manufacturers of lidar.

Private and corporate investors have poured more than $700 million into startups developing lidar systems for self-driving cars, according to a Reuters analysis of publicly available investment data.

Princeton Lightwave is one of at least four of those startups to be acquired in the past two years. Others include Tyto Lidar, a small San Francisco Bay area company purchased by Uber Technologies [UBER.UL] in 2016, and Pasadena, California-based Strobe Inc, which General Motors Co bought earlier this month. [nL2N1MK0HR]

Ford acquired control of Argo in February and is investing $1 billion in the Pittsburgh-based company over five years. Argo is developing a software-based "virtual driver" system for the automaker. [nL1N1FV1FS]

UPDATE 1-U.S. probes Ford Fusion cars over steering wheels that may detach - Reuters News

{{20171027T142557.464+0000}}UPDATE 1-U.S. probes Ford Fusion cars over steering wheels that may detach(Adds Ford statement, earlier GM recalls for similar issues, background on recent Ford recall costs)

By David Shepardson

WASHINGTON, Oct 27 (Reuters) - The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said Friday it was opening a preliminary investigation into 841,000 Ford Motor Co vehicles over concerns the steering wheels may get detached while the cars are in motion.

The auto safety agency said it was investigating 2014-2016 model Ford Fusion cars after three reports of steering wheel bolts becoming loose, including one completely detaching as a driver attempted to turn into a gas station.

Ford said in an emailed statement Friday it was cooperating "with the agency on its investigation, as we always do."

The company's shares fell 2 percent in morning trading to $12.03.

Steering wheel recalls are rare but not unprecedented.

In 2011, General Motors Co in 2011 recalled 2,100 Cruze cars because the steering wheel could detach. GM also issued a separate recall for about 150 Buick Encore SUVs in 2013 to address steering wheels that could come off.

Last week, Ford said it was recalling 1.34 million 2015-17 Ford F-150 and 2017 Ford Super Duty trucks in North America to add water shields to side door latches at a cost of $267 million. The recall came after authorities in Canada asked Ford for answers in March after four reports of doors opening while people were driving.

Ford has now recalled more than 5 million vehicles for varying door latch-related issues since 2016, but the company said the issue in last week's door-latch recall was different from prior ones.

The company has previously disclosed plans to spend $935 million on other recalls announced since August 2016.

INTERVIEW-Top Thai auto parts maker looks overseas as home market slows - Reuters News

{{20171027T122013.380+0000}}INTERVIEW-Top Thai auto parts maker looks overseas as home market slowsBy Chayut Setboonsarng

BANGKOK, Oct 27 (Reuters) - Thailand's biggest auto parts maker Thai Summit Group is looking to a pick-up in revenues from abroad as its domestic market slows, a senior company official told Reuters on Friday.

"We are quite pessimistic about the Thai domestic (automobile) market," executive vice president Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit said in an interview.

"It's growing only at about 3-5 percent" due to high consumer debt and political uncertainty, he added.

Thanathorn is the son of company president and chief executive Somporn Juangroongruangkit.

Foreign sources of revenue currently account for 18-20 percent of Thai Summit's sales, but it expects that ratio to reach 30 percent in 3-5 years, with plants in the United States, India and South Africa driving growth. This year, Thai Summit expects total revenue of 79 billion baht ($2.4 billion).

Thanathorn said the privately-held company was looking to take advantage of the similarity in vehicles produced in Thailand and South Africa.

"Car makers usually import parts from Thailand to assemble cars in South Africa," he said. Local operators and the South African government want to source more parts domestically, so Thai Summit's strategy is to preempt this, he added.

The company will begin next year by renting a factory for light manufacturing and eventually build factories for heavier equipment by 2021, spending approximately $100-150 million.

SUVs, pick-up trucks and derivatives made in South Africa also receive tax benefits when exported to Europe thanks to a trade agreement, Thanathorn said, adding the country was a window to other African markets as well in the long run.

EXPORTS DOING WELL

Currently, the United States accounts for over half of Thai Summit's overseas revenue. Its plants in Michigan and Kentucky are expected to bring in $500 million next year. The company is aiming for U.S. revenue to reach $1 billion within five years.

Revenue from plants in India, meanwhile, is doubling each year, but from a low base of 1.5 billion baht.

Anticipating future trends in the automotive industry, Thai Summit has spent over 400 million baht on testing centres and research and development of lightweight technology.

Thanathorn said the company was producing an aluminium chassis for U.S. electric carmaker Tesla Inc.

Despite a weak domestic market, Thai auto exports are doing well, the executive said.

"Thai auto exports grow with the global economy," he said, adding a reduction in foreign investment into the country was due to weak demand rather than any loss of competitiveness.

"Cambodia, Vietnam and Myanmar do not have the capacity to pull investment away from Thailand," Thanathorn said, adding any investment from auto companies in Indonesia and the Philippines would be for market access rather than export capacity.

Thailand is the world's 13th largest auto exporter, selling over 60 percent of vehicles produced or 1.18 million in total last year. Auto exports account for about 10 percent of the economy and in September reached a two-year high. [nL4N1MT1ZG]

Thailand was dubbed the "Detroit of the East" after foreign automakers, particularly Japanese companies like Toyota Motor <7203.T>, Honda Motor <7267.T> and Isuzu <7202.T> set up shop in the 1980s, while Ford , Chrysler and General Motors chose the country mainly to manufacture one-tonne pickup trucks.

RPT-ANALYSIS-Wall Street loves electric cars, America loves trucks - Reuters News

{{20171027T110001.703+0000}}RPT-ANALYSIS-Wall Street loves electric cars, America loves trucks(Repeats with no changes to headline or text)

By Paul Lienert and Joseph White

DETROIT, Oct 27 (Reuters) - Wall Street may love the shares of Silicon Valley electric carmaker Tesla Inc , but Americans love big, fuel-thirsty trucks like Ford Motor Co's bestselling F-Series pickups and are paying ever higher prices to buy them.

The auto industry is at a crossroads, with the future of legacy automakers like Ford, General Motors Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV uncertain as governments float proposals to ban internal combustion engines over the next two decades.

But in the present, consumer enthusiasm for trucks and sport utility vehicles is strong, especially in the United States. And that is providing Ford, GM and other established automakers with billions in cash to mount a challenge to Tesla.

Tesla has ambitions to boost annual sales to 500,000 vehicles a year. But it is wrestling with the sort of production problems that old-line automakers have largely put behind them, and has reported a net loss of $666.7 million through the first six months of 2017. Analysts expect the company to post a third quarter net loss of $380.4 million when it reports results next Wednesday. [nL2N1N02OM]

Electric cars are money losers, which explains why global automakers have been slow to roll them out until now. But regulatory and consumer pressures are forcing established automakers to put more electric vehicles in their fleets over the next several years. In a cash-intensive industry, profits from pickups and SUVs may give them a competitive edge.

Ford said on Thursday that the average price of one of its F-series pickups rose $2,800 to an average $45,400 a truck in the third quarter. Sales of F-series trucks, which range from spartan work trucks to Platinum models with the features - and price tags - of a European luxury sedan, were up nearly 11 percent to 658,636 vehicles for the first nine months of this year.

GM has driven its share price up nearly 30 percent so far in 2017 as Chief Executive Mary Barra has talked up plans for putting self-driving, electric Chevrolet Bolts into ride services fleets within a few quarters.

Barra told investors on Tuesday improved profit margins on trucks were "one of the big drivers of the overall 8.3 percent margins" in the automaker's North American business during the latest quarter.

GM has forecast free cash flow for the full year of roughly $6 billion. That is $1 billion less than forecast earlier this year, but strong enough to fund the company's promise to develop 20 more electric vehicles by 2023 and send $7 billion back to shareholders. [nL2N1MD1YS]

GM, which emerged from a government funded bankruptcy eight years ago, now has $31.4 billion in available funds, including $17.3 billion in cash.

Ford lags behind GM in sales of battery electric models, but the company has said it will spend $5 billion developing battery electric and hybrid models. Ford's new Chief Executive Officer Jim Hackett has said the plans include shifting $500 million into electric vehicle development from internal combustion projects. [nL4N1ME3GX]

Ford's share price has been flat for the year as the No. 2 U.S. automaker ushered out former CEO Mark Fields. Still, it had $28 billion in cash and marketable securities as of Sept. 30.

Automakers also are becoming more confident they can make money on electric cars as battery costs come down.

Volkswagen AG's Audi brand is gearing up a fleet of electric models that the company expects will account for 25 percent of sales by 2025. In the United States, Audi plans to launch an electric SUV "in the sweet spot of the market" in 2019, Scott Keogh, head of Audi's U.S. operations, told Reuters on Thursday.

Sales of Audi's current lineup of SUVs "pay for what we want to do, which is lead the future," Keogh said.

Renault SA Chief Executive Carlos Ghosn expressed confidence earlier this month that electric cars will become "a significant contributor to our performance." [nL8N1MH0QX]

Tesla, by comparison to its legacy rivals, is market value rich, and cash poor. It had $3 billion in cash on hand at the end of the second quarter, and some analysts predict the automaker will have to raise more to cover the expected cash drain from the slow launch of the Model 3, which is lower priced than other Teslas and aimed at the market for $35,000 to $45,000 cars.

Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk has outlined ambitious plans to expand its network of factories and service facilities, including potentially an assembly plant in China and up to three more electric battery Gigafactories. He told investors in July the company could sell more shares to fund that expansion.

"I'm sure there will be some funding rounds that happen in the future," he said.

AUTOSHOW-Special delivery: Automakers make plug for electric vans - Reuters News

{{20171027T074825.808+0000}}AUTOSHOW-Special delivery: Automakers make plug for electric vans* Take-up of electric delivery vehicles seen faster than for cars

* E-commerce, pollution controls to drive electric van demand

* China demand for electric delivery vans set to "explode"

By Naomi Tajitsu

TOKYO, Oct 27 (Reuters) - In the rush towards electric vehicles, automakers are increasingly sparing a thought for the humble delivery van, an often overlooked segment with big growth potential given tightening pollution restrictions in urban areas.

Given lingering consumer concerns about cost and charging infrastructure, many in the industry expect it will take at least a decade for electric vehicles (EVs) to win over mainstream car owners.

But as e-commerce begins to dominate the retail sector and cities clamp down on pollution, more vehicle makers see opportunities for faster take-up of EVs as delivery vehicles, taxis and other business uses in dense, urban areas.

At the Tokyo Motor Show which opened to the public on Friday, Nissan Motor Co <7201.T>, an early embracer of EV technology and maker of the Leaf, the world's top-selling electric car, unveiled a concept model of its e-NV200 electric van with refrigeration capabilities, designed to transport chilled food to restaurants and homes.

"Imagine if you have city access challenges, how will you get food delivered to restaurants, and goods to customers?" said Ashwani Gupta, head of the light commercial business at the automaking alliance of Nissan and France's Renault SA .

"There's no other option but to go electric."

Nissan plans to launch the refrigeration model in Japan next year, Gupta said. Both Nissan and Renault already market electric vans in Europe.

Nissan is also looking to introduce the e-NV200 series in China in the near term as it expects demand will "explode" as big cities in the country effectively ban gasoline and diesel trucks and vans in an effort to crack down on emissions.

At the moment, the country's electric light commercial vehicle market has yet to be tapped by major foreign automakers, although Ford Motor Co wants to drive its truck-making China partner Jiangling Motors Corp (JMC) <000550.SZ> more towards electric commercial vans. [nL4N1ME2KZ]

Mitsubishi Fuso Truck and Bus Corporation, majority owned by Germany's Daimler AG , has also begun selling its eCanter electric light-duty truck in the United States, Europe and Japan, where it targets transport delivery services and convenient stores.

As increases demand for e-commerce creates more work for delivery services, Toyota Auto Body, a wholly owned subsidiary of Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T>, was thinking about the harried delivery van driver when it designed its LCV D-Cargo concept model.

"We set out to make the delivery truck more comfortable for drivers," said Ichiro Mukai, who worked on the model's design.

"In the past home deliveries mainly centred around larger parcels, but recently, a big increase in the number of deliveries has come just as people are getting smaller parcels delivered," he said, adding that this had increased the workload of drivers.

The model's futuristic design is based on Toyota's gasoline-hybrid minivan models marketed in Japan, and can be adapted to operate as an all-battery electric.

Removing the passenger seat entirely, the driver's seat configuration - which includes a retractable steering wheel and rounded seat corners - is designed to enable drivers to get in and out of the vehicle more quickly and easily.

A removable tablet device in the centre of the steering wheel enables drivers to easily locate parcels in the hold, where track shelving units and a wider door opening allows for easy access to parcels from outside the vehicle.

Geely's Volvo Cars posts 78 pct profit rise in Q3 - Reuters News

{{20171027T052641.472+0000}}Geely's Volvo Cars posts 78 pct profit rise in Q3STOCKHOLM, Oct 27 (Reuters) - Geely-owned Volvo Car Group reported a 78 percent rise in third-quarter operating earnings on Friday and said it saw strong sales growth in China and continued signs of recovery in the U.S. market.

Under Chinese ownership since being bought by Zhejiang Geely Holding Group from Ford in 2010, Volvo begun taking on larger rivals such as BMW and Daimler's Mercedes-Benz, carving out a niche in the premium market with a string of new models.

Volvo, one of Sweden's biggest companies by revenue, posted quarterly operating earnings of 3.7 billion Swedish crowns ($442 million ) against 2.1 billion crowns in the same quarter last year.

Net sales rose to 48.9 billion crowns, up from 41.3 billion crowns a year earlier, on the back of rising sales of its new 90-series and XC60 models, the company said in a statement.

Volvo also repeated its forecast for a fourth straight year of record sales in 2017.

"For the full year 2017, I anticipate continuous growth in line with the previous nine months," Volvo Chief Executive Hakan Samuelsson said in a statement.

"The results so far demonstrate that we are heading in the right direction."

ANALYSIS-Wall Street loves electric cars, America loves trucks - Reuters News

{{20171027T050002.872+0000}}ANALYSIS-Wall Street loves electric cars, America loves trucksBy Paul Lienert and Joseph White

DETROIT, Oct 27 (Reuters) - Wall Street may love the shares of Silicon Valley electric carmaker Tesla Inc , but Americans love big, fuel-thirsty trucks like Ford Motor Co's bestselling F-Series pickups and are paying ever higher prices to buy them.

The auto industry is at a crossroads, with the future of legacy automakers like Ford, General Motors Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV uncertain as governments float proposals to ban internal combustion engines over the next two decades.

But in the present, consumer enthusiasm for trucks and sport utility vehicles is strong, especially in the United States. And that is providing Ford, GM and other established automakers with billions in cash to mount a challenge to Tesla.

Tesla has ambitions to boost annual sales to 500,000 vehicles a year. But it is wrestling with the sort of production problems that old-line automakers have largely put behind them, and has reported a net loss of $666.7 million through the first six months of 2017. Analysts expect the company to post a third quarter net loss of $380.4 million when it reports results next Wednesday. [nL2N1N02OM]

Electric cars are money losers, which explains why global automakers have been slow to roll them out until now. But regulatory and consumer pressures are forcing established automakers to put more electric vehicles in their fleets over the next several years. In a cash-intensive industry, profits from pickups and SUVs may give them a competitive edge.

Ford said on Thursday that the average price of one of its F-series pickups rose $2,800 to an average $45,400 a truck in the third quarter. Sales of F-series trucks, which range from spartan work trucks to Platinum models with the features - and price tags - of a European luxury sedan, were up nearly 11 percent to 658,636 vehicles for the first nine months of this year.

GM has driven its share price up nearly 30 percent so far in 2017 as Chief Executive Mary Barra has talked up plans for putting self-driving, electric Chevrolet Bolts into ride services fleets within a few quarters.

Barra told investors on Tuesday improved profit margins on trucks were "one of the big drivers of the overall 8.3 percent margins" in the automaker's North American business during the latest quarter.

GM has forecast free cash flow for the full year of roughly $6 billion. That is $1 billion less than forecast earlier this year, but strong enough to fund the company's promise to develop 20 more electric vehicles by 2023 and send $7 billion back to shareholders. [nL2N1MD1YS]

GM, which emerged from a government funded bankruptcy eight years ago, now has $31.4 billion in available funds, including $17.3 billion in cash.

Ford lags behind GM in sales of battery electric models, but the company has said it will spend $5 billion developing battery electric and hybrid models. Ford's new Chief Executive Officer Jim Hackett has said the plans include shifting $500 million into electric vehicle development from internal combustion projects. [nL4N1ME3GX]

Ford's share price has been flat for the year as the No. 2 U.S. automaker ushered out former CEO Mark Fields. Still, it had $28 billion in cash and marketable securities as of Sept. 30.

Automakers also are becoming more confident they can make money on electric cars as battery costs come down.

Volkswagen AG's Audi brand is gearing up a fleet of electric models that the company expects will account for 25 percent of sales by 2025. In the United States, Audi plans to launch an electric SUV "in the sweet spot of the market" in 2019, Scott Keogh, head of Audi's U.S. operations, told Reuters on Thursday.

Sales of Audi's current lineup of SUVs "pay for what we want to do, which is lead the future," Keogh said.

Renault SA Chief Executive Carlos Ghosn expressed confidence earlier this month that electric cars will become "a significant contributor to our performance." [nL8N1MH0QX]

Tesla, by comparison to its legacy rivals, is market value rich, and cash poor. It had $3 billion in cash on hand at the end of the second quarter, and some analysts predict the automaker will have to raise more to cover the expected cash drain from the slow launch of the Model 3, which is lower priced than other Teslas and aimed at the market for $35,000 to $45,000 cars.

Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk has outlined ambitious plans to expand its network of factories and service facilities, including potentially an assembly plant in China and up to three more electric battery Gigafactories. He told investors in July the company could sell more shares to fund that expansion.

"I'm sure there will be some funding rounds that happen in the future," he said.

UPDATE 3-Sales of U.S. pickups lift Ford profit; self-driving test set for '18 - Reuters News

{{20171026T150140.492+0000}}UPDATE 3-Sales of U.S. pickups lift Ford profit; self-driving test set for '18(Adds detail on trucks, self-driving cars, comparison with GM plans, CEO and CFO comments)

By Nick Carey and Paul Lienert

DETROIT, Oct 26 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co reported a better-than-expected quarterly net profit on Thursday, driven largely by U.S. sales of its high-margin pickup trucks, and said it would begin to test self-driving cars in some cities next year.

A large part of the company's profits came from its F-Series pickup trucks, which have been the best-selling vehicle in North America for decades. Ford said the average transaction price for its trucks rose $2,800 to $45,400.

The company redesigned its larger F-series Super Duty pickups a year ago, and recently updated its standard F-150 trucks for model year 2018.

Ford said its North American margin rose to 8.1 percent from 5.8 percent a year earlier. Earlier this week, GM reported a third-quarter margin for North America of 8.3 percent. [nL2N1MZ0FE]

Ford plans to begin testing self-driving vehicles in some cities in 2018, Chief Executive Officer Jim Hackett disclosed on an earnings call with analysts on Thursday, but gave no details.

Ford also is developing new business partnerships with unnamed companies to use its self-driving vehicles in commercial applications other than ride hailing, Hackett said. He declined to confirm whether Ford still planned to put those vehicles into service by 2021, executives have said.

Rival General Motors Co said in recent weeks it plans to accelerate the commercial application of its self-driving Chevrolet Bolts, some of which could be in operation before 2020. GM also plans to introduce 20 electric vehicles by 2023.

Year to date, GM's stock is up nearly 30 percent, while Ford is down almost 1 percent. In mid-morning trade, Ford was up 0.3 percent to $12.08.

Wall Street has been underwhelmed by Ford, particularly by Hackett's caveat that most of the company's $14 billion in planned cost savings will not show up on Ford's bottom line until 2019 and 2020. [nL4N1ME3GX]

When asked by reporters about the flagging stock, Chief Financial Officer Bob Shanks said Ford has a "really good plan" for electric vehicles and self-driving car technology.

"I think the market will reward us," he said.

On the earnings call on Thursday, Shanks said Ford will "aggressively restructure the business as required to achieve our objectives ... We are prepared to do what we have to do." He did not provide details.

Apart from North America, the only other region that was profitable for Ford was Asia Pacific, where a record profit was driven by sales increases outside China. CFO Shanks said sales volumes, market share and margins were all down in China.

He said Ford's European operations would return to profitability in the fourth quarter and for the full year.

Ford said it had lower engineering, advertising and promotion expenses than in the third quarter.

The second largest U.S. automaker posted a quarterly net profit of $1.56 billion, or 39 cents per share, up more than 60 percent from $960 million, or 24 cents, a year earlier.

Excluding one-time items, Ford reported earnings per share of 43 cents, above Wall Street expectations of 32 cents.

Revenue rose to $36.45 billion from $35.94 billion a year earlier.

Ford said it now expects full-year earnings in a range of $1.75 to $1.85 per share. Previously it had looked for $1.65 to $1.85.

Alphabet looks to snowy Michigan to test self-driving cars - Reuters News

{{20171026T120002.080+0000}}Alphabet looks to snowy Michigan to test self-driving carsBy David Shepardson

WASHINGTON, Oct 26 (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc's self-driving car unit Waymo is expanding winter testing as it works to address a potential blind spot for autonomous vehicles: snowy and icy conditions.

Waymo said Thursday that Michigan is the sixth state where the self-driving car project will test autonomous vehicles. The company chose the state to see how vehicles will respond in snow, sleet, and ice.

Waymo has been testing vehicles in Texas, Arizona, Washington State, Nevada and California and starts in Michigan next week on public roads with a backup safety driver sitting in the driver seat if necessary.

"For human drivers, the mix of winter conditions affects how well you can see and the way your vehicle handles the road. The same is true for self-driving cars," said Waymo chief executive John Krafcik in a blog post. "Our ultimate goal is for our fully self-driving cars to operate safely and smoothly in all kinds of environments."

Waymo said it has conducted cold weather testing since 2012, including some around the Nevada and California border of Lake Tahoe, but the new testing in Metro Detroit may pose tougher challenges navigating snow slicked or icy roads crowded with commuters.

Waymo opened a development center in Novi, Michigan in May 2016, working with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV to integrate Waymo's self-driving technology into Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid minivans.

The new winter testing is in the back yard of Detroit's Big Three automakers. U.S. automakers have touted plans to get self-driving cars on the roads.

General Motors Co chief executive Mary Barra said Tuesday the Detroit automaker is working hard on self-driving cars and expects to deploy cars without backup drivers in "quarters not years."

Waymo has been mapping areas in Metro Detroit and wants to assess how its sensors perform in wet, cold conditions. One hurdle is self-driving car mapping software may have challenges in winter weather.

One challenge for Waymo may be human drivers. Many self-driving vehicles from numerous companies have been struck by inattentive or careless drivers in California, according to reports to filed with the state.

Microsoft Corp is expected to report a rise in first-quarter revenue as the company reaps the benefit of its push to the cloud, led by its flagship cloud computing platform, Azure.

World's biggest computer chipmaker Intel Corp is expected to post a rise in third-quarter profit, helped by continued stability in the PC market and strong growth in its data center business. Investors will be keeping a keen eye on the chipmaker's artificial intelligence and autonomous driving business.

Google's parent company Alphabet Inc is expected to announce a rise in third-quarter revenue, helped by strong mobile search traffic and larger-than-expected contribution from its non-search businesses like its YouTube, Play Store and Google Cloud.

Weekly jobless claims figures are up next on the economic calendar and are forecast to show a rise by 13,000 to 235,000 for the week ended Oct. 21. (0830/1230) Building permits data for September are also due for release after dropping 4.5 percent to 1.215 million the month before.

Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari gives welcome remarks before the Opportunity and Inclusive Growth Institute Fall Conference hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. (1030/1430)

Ford Motor Co announces third-quarter results. The automaker reported weak sales in Europe and China earlier this month, but saw its U.S. sales rising. On Oct. 3, CEO Jim Hackett said Ford plans to slash $14 billion in costs over the next five years and shift capital investment away from sedans and internal combustion engines to develop more trucks and electric and hybrid cars.

The European Central Bank's governing council meets in Frankfurt and will announce its interest rate decision. The central bank is expected to signal continued policy accommodation by keeping rates at record lows for longer. ECB President Mario Draghi will hold a press conference after the meeting. (0830/1230)

World's largest online retailer Amazon.com Inc is likely to report a rise in third-quarter revenue, driven by growth in its cloud computing and retail businesses. However, Amazon's bottom line continues to take a hit amid its costly expansion into new shopping categories and countries. Investors will be looking out for any updates on Amazon's $13.7 billion acquisition of Whole Foods Market as well as its fourth-quarter forecast.

American Airlines Group Inc, the No.1 U.S. airline, is likely to announce higher third-quarter revenue, helped by healthy demand during the summer travel season. However, the company's profit will take a hit because of the hurricanes, which resulted in nearly 8,000 canceled flights and cost about $75 million in pre-tax earnings. Southwest Airlines Co is expected to report a drop in third-quarter profit, partly due to canceled flights during recent hurricanes. However, revenue is expected to rise.

Charter Communications Inc is expected to report a rise in third-quarter revenue, helped by the growth of its residential customers. Last week, the cable company agreed on a multi-year programming deal with Viacom Inc to include its popular networks in its cable bundles. Investors and analysts will be on the lookout for commentary about any possible deals.

Microblogging website Twitter Inc is expected to continue declines in third-quarter revenue and profit. After Twitter failed to add users in the previous quarter, all eyes will be on whether the social network can boost its user growth. Slowing user growth and deals losses are adding to concerns around Twitter's ability to compete with giants like Facebook and Snapchat for advertising dollars, amidst a push towards video content.

Mattel Inc announces third-quarter results. While Barbie sales picked up following a disappointing second quarter, total doll sales are down, according to analysts. Investors will also be interested in comments on how the Toys "R" Us bankruptcy would affect Mattel, which gets about 10 percent of its revenue from the retailer.

When United Parcel Service Inc reports third-quarter earnings, analysts will look to see how much growth the company was able to capture in their international business, following the cyberattack on rival FedEx's TNT unit. Eyes will also be on guidance on the crucial peak season and impacts from hurricanes, which disrupted transportation across southeast U.S. in August and September.

Boston Scientific Corp, which will announce third-quarter results, is expected to report improved sales from its cardiovascular devices business. U.S. biotech Celgene Corp announces third-quarter results and investors will likely focus on the company's efforts to lower dependence on its flagship multiple myeloma drug Revlimid after it faces major setback as it abandons testing a drug to treat Crohn's disease. McKesson Corp, the biggest U.S. drug distributor, is expected to report year-over-year revenue growth when it releases second-quarter results. Investors, however, will be looking at the impact of falling generic drug prices and the moderating pace of branded drug price increases.

U.S.-based refiner Valero Energy Corp is expected to post a bigger profit helped by higher refining margins and partly from increased activity in the wake of Hurricane Harvey, while oil producer ConocoPhillips is also likely to swing to a third-quarter profit. Marathon Petroleum Corp is expected to post a higher profit, helped by favorable margins and tight cost control measures. Canadian oil and gas producer Husky Energy Inc reports third-quarter results. The company is pressing ahead with small thermal projects in western Canada as oil prices hover around $50 a barrel. MEG Energy Corp is expected to post a third-quarter loss. The Canadian oil sands company has its major operations in the Athabasca region and is planning expansions rather than starting new projects, as oil sands companies struggle with expensive production and volatile oil prices. Canadian light oil and gas producer Crescent Point Energy will also report third quarter results and is expected to post a small loss.

Data storage company Western Digital Corp is expected to post a first-quarter profit, from a loss last year, helped by a rise in demand for its flash memory chips. Western Digital recently lost its bid for Toshiba's memory chip unit to a rival consortium led by Bain Capital, creating a legal battle between the joint venture partners. This loss also puts at risk the future of NAND chip supply for the hard disk-drive maker.

Hershey Co, which reports third-quarter earnings, cut its forecast for full-year net sales growth in July even as it works to cut costs and launch new and reinvented candy products. The company is also reported to be bidding for Nestle's U.S. confectionery business, which was put on the block earlier this year.

Union Pacific Corp announces third-quarter results and analysts will want to see how their results have been impacted by major hurricanes that disrupted transportation in Texas and Florida.

Dunkin' Brands Group Inc reports third-quarter results. Traffic to Dunkin's mainstay U.S. Dunkin' Donuts cafes have fallen for five quarters in a row. The company has said it will offer a variety of local and national promotions, but will not aggressively discount to match McDonald's $1 coffee specials, which have been helping the fast-food giant gain traffic.

Hotel operator Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc is expected to report a decline in third-quarter revenue and profit after completing the spinoff of Park Hotels and Resorts and Hilton Grand Vacations this year. Hilton has benefited from an uptick in corporate demand, as companies spend more based on improved business sentiment following Donald Trump's election as president in November.

BP Midtsream Partners, a unit of British energy company BP Plc debuts on the New York Stock Exchange, under the symbol BPMP. It expects to raise up to $893 million from its initial public offering.

Gold miner Newmont Mining Corp reports third-quarter results, which are expected to show an increase in revenue from the same period last year. The Greenwood Village, Colorado-based company raised its output estimates in July, based on better yields from its mines in North America and Africa, saying it expects to produce 5-5.4 million ounces of gold this year. Newmont is flush with $3.1 billion in cash and may also discuss plans to sweeten its dividend to attract new investors. Diversified Canadian miner Teck Resources is expected to report a nearly five-fold jump in third-quarter earnings, boosted by higher prices for coal, zinc and copper, although a stronger Canadian dollar could take the shine off results. The market will be interested in Teck's outlook for the metallurgical coal market and will also be looking for any comments regarding a dispute between its partners at the Fort Hills oil sands project, which is slated to produce its first oil later this year.

As Shaw Communications Inc reports fourth-quarter earnings, investors will be eager to see how the Canadian cable company's growing wireless business and revamped television product performed in the quarter. They will also expect Shaw to also outline its forecast for next year as it battles rival telecom company Telus Corp.

Canadian fertilizer company Potash Corp of Saskatchewan Inc reports third-quarter results and any update on its planned merger with Agrium Inc is likely to be the focus.

Maple Leaf Foods Inc, one of Canada's biggest pork producers, is expected to report bigger year-over-year third-quarter profit, as it benefits from greater efficiencies from new and expanded plants. Investors will be interested for any hints on how the company may deploy capital, after recently branching into plant-based proteins.

Brazilian statistics agency IBGE releases September's producer price index data. The country's central bank releases current account numbers and is expected to post a $250 million deficit in September. The Mexican national statistics agency will report September's trade balance data, following a $1.283 billion deficit in August.

Green groups pressure automakers on U.S. fuel efficiency rules - Reuters News

{{20171024T214719.210+0000}}Green groups pressure automakers on U.S. fuel efficiency rulesBy David Shepardson

WASHINGTON, Oct 24 (Reuters) - The Sierra Club, Greenpeace USA and Public Citizen and other environmental and consumer advocacy groups plan to turn up the pressure on Wednesday in their campaign to stop automakers from lobbying the Trump administration to weaken fuel efficiency requirements.

The groups wrote last month to auto executives at Ford Motor Co , General Motors Co , Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV , Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T>, Volkswagen AG and others urging them to "discontinue any and all efforts to weaken or delay the implementation" of the 2025 fuel efficiency standards.

"The auto industry should be leaders in increasing efficiency and clean technology innovation, and now is not the time to go backwards. To do so would be dangerously misguided and have profound consequences," they wrote.

The letters said the groups planned a national campaign to publicize the auto industry's work with the Trump Administration to weaken fuel efficiency standards. The groups planned to kick off the effort Wednesday with a media event with U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse dubbed "Forward, Not Backward: Stop the Rollback of Our Clean Car Standards."

The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers said it would not stop trying to convince U.S. regulators to lower fuel efficiency mandates approved in the final weeks of the Obama administration.

The carmakers said the costs would be onerous and the standards did not reflect how cheap gasoline was affecting consumer demand. They stopped short of asking for a specific reduction in requirements through 2025. [nL2N1MH1RC]

Automakers "are dedicated to continued gains in fuel efficiency and carbon reductions" the alliance said in a letter reviewed by Reuters, adding no one should "prejudge" the review's outcome.

Ford wrote the environmental groups on Oct. 5 saying the company shares the goal "of reducing greenhouse gas emissions" but did not agree to any specific demands.

Automakers have urged changes that would make it easier for them to comply with fuel economy standards, including flexibility in the use of a system of credits under the program.

In June, New York state's attorney general and 12 top law enforcement officials from other U.S. states said they would mount a court challenge if the administration tried to roll back vehicle emission rules. [nL1N1J60VG]

The Obama administration finalized rules in 2012 to double the fleetwide average fuel economy to 54.5 mpg by 2025, but the EPA revised it to 51.4 mpg based on a rising number of trucks.

UPDATE 1-Auto industry tells Trump 'We're winning with NAFTA' - Reuters News

{{20171024T205853.033+0000}}UPDATE 1-Auto industry tells Trump 'We're winning with NAFTA'(Adds comments by GM and Fiat Chrysler, last two paragraphs)

By David Shepardson

WASHINGTON, Oct 24 (Reuters) - Major automakers, suppliers and auto dealers launched a new coalition on Tuesday to urge U.S. President Donald Trump not to withdraw from the North American Free Trade Agreement.

Auto trade associations representing major carmakers including General Motors Co , Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T>, Volkswagen AG , Hyundai Motor Co <005380.KS> and Ford Motor Co are part of the coalition dubbed "Driving American Jobs." The group is behind an advertising campaign to convince the White House and voters that the NAFTA pact has been crucial in boosting U.S. automotive sector production and jobs.

Trump has threatened to withdraw from the trade agreement among the United States, Canada and Mexico, which is heavily utilized by automakers that have production and supply chains spread across the three countries. [nL2N1MS0XB]

In the most recent round of talks to renegotiate NAFTA last week, Trump proposed changes to the rules of origin for autos, which are used to determine how much of a vehicle is made in a certain place. The proposed rules were viewed as untenable for automakers, as well as Mexico and Canada.

The auto industry joins the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and other large business groups that have become more vocal in recent weeks about Trump's efforts to change the 23-year-old accord, saying the changes would hurt American jobs.

The auto coalition, which includes the Motor & Equipment Manufacturers Association and American International Automobile Dealers Association, said ending NAFTA, which underpins $1.2 trillion in annual trade between the three countries, would put U.S. auto sector jobs at risk.

They pointed to $9.5 billion in new investments announced this year by the auto and auto parts sector and feature the personal stories of auto sector employees throughout America - from plant workers to auto dealership personnel.

"We need you to tell your elected officials that you don't change the game in the middle of a comeback. We're winning with NAFTA," the group said on its website.

The Chamber of Commerce accused the Trump administration of trying to sabotage the talks with "poison pill proposals," including demands for more favorable treatment for the U.S. side on car production, and a "sunset clause" to force regular negotiations. [nL2N1MM0LE]

U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said earlier this month the Trump administration was focused on trying to get an agreement that was fair but said he had "seen no indication that our partners are willing to make any changes that will result in a rebalancing and a reduction in these huge trade deficits."

The campaign comes amid rising concern that the Trump administration could opt early next year to withdraw after giving six months' notice, a move that could expose automakers who are building trucks in Mexico to high tariffs and impose new tariffs on parts and cars made throughout North America.

Trump told the Fox Business Network in an interview that aired Sunday he thinks the deal will "probably" be renegotiated, but said he will withdraw if it is not fair. "We can't allow the world to look at us as a whipping post. Not going to happen anymore," he said.

Under NAFTA, at least 62.5 percent of the material in a car or light truck made in the region must be from North America to be able to enter the marketplace tariff-free.

The Trump administration has proposed raising the amount of NAFTA content in autos to 85 percent and securing 50 percent of the total for the United States.

On Tuesday, GM Chief Financial Officer Chuck Stevens said the automaker sees "some risks" in the NAFTA negotiations. "That's why we're so heavily engaged to assure that the outcome is beneficial" to the industry.

Separately, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne said the company has designed its future truck production strategy so that trucks currently made in Mexico could be made in the United States if NAFTA is scuttled.

Auto industry tells Trump 'We're winning with NAFTA' - Reuters News

{{20171024T110020.286+0000}}Auto industry tells Trump 'We're winning with NAFTA'By David Shepardson

WASHINGTON, Oct 24 (Reuters) - Major automakers, suppliers and auto dealers are launching a new coalition on Tuesday to urge U.S. President Donald Trump not to withdraw from the North American Free Trade Agreement.

Auto trade associations representing General Motors Co Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T>, Volkswagen AG , Hyundai Motor Co <005380.KS>, Ford Motor Co and nearly every other major automaker, are part of the coalition dubbed "Driving American Jobs" and backing an advertising campaign to convince the White House and voters that the agreement has been crucial in boosting U.S. automotive sector production and jobs.

Trump has threatened to withdraw from the trade deal with U.S., Canada and Mexico, which is heavily utilized by automakers who have production and supply chains spread across the three countries.

In the most recent round of talks to renegotiate NAFTA last week, Trump proposed changes to the rules of origin for autos, which are used to determine how much of an auto is made in a certain place. The proposed rules were viewed as untenable for automakers, as well as Mexico and Canada.

The auto industry joins the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and other large business groups that have become more vocal in recent weeks about Trump's efforts to change the 23-year-old accord, saying they would be detrimental to American jobs.

The auto coalition, which includes the Motor & Equipment Manufacturers Association and American International Automobile Dealers Association, said ending NAFTA, which underpins $1.2 trillion in annual trade between the three countries, would put U.S. auto sector jobs at risk.

They pointed to $9.5 billion in new investments announced this year by the auto and auto parts sector and feature the personal stories of auto sector employees throughout America - from plant workers to auto dealership personnel.

"We need you to tell your elected officials that you don't change the game in the middle of a comeback. We're winning with NAFTA," the group said on its website.

The campaign comes amid rising concern that the Trump administration could opt early next year to withdraw after giving six months notice, a move that could expose automakers to high tariffs who are building trucks in Mexico and impose new tariffs on parts and cars made throughout North America.

President Donald Trump told the Fox Business Network in an interview that aired Sunday he thinks the deal will "probably" be renegotiated, but said he will withdraw if it is not fair. "We can't allow the world to look at us as a whipping post. Not going to happen anymore," Trump said.

The Chamber of Commerce accused the Trump administration of trying to sabotage the talks with "poison pill proposals," including demands for more favorable treatment for the U.S. side on car production, and a "sunset clause" to force regular negotiations. [nL2N1MM0LE]

U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said earlier this month the Trump administration was focused on trying to get an agreement that was fair but said he had "seen no indication that our partners are willing to make any changes that will result in a rebalancing and a reduction in these huge trade deficits."

Under NAFTA, at least 62.5 percent of the material in a car or light truck made in the region must be from North America to be able to enter the marketplace tariff-free.

The Trump administration has proposed raising the amount of NAFTA content in autos to 85 percent and securing 50 percent of the total for the United States.

BREAKINGVIEWS-Tesla could hit second gear with Shanghai factory - Reuters Breakingviews

{{20171023T020718.326+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-Tesla could hit second gear with Shanghai factory(The authors are Reuters Breakingviews columnists. The opinions expressed are their own.)

By Antony Currie and Christopher Beddor

NEW YORK/WASHINGTON, Oct 23 (Reuters Breakingviews) - A factory in Shanghai could help Tesla shift into second gear. It would give Elon Musk's $58 billion electric-car company a better shot at catching up to or keeping pace with rivals in the fast-growing market. Any deal, though, is apt to have some roadblocks.

China presents a large but perplexing opportunity for all foreign automakers. The country is now the biggest market for passenger cars. Though growth has been slowing, sales increased 3.3 percent in September from a year ago. Worsening air quality, however, has prompted Beijing to consider a possible ban on gasoline-only cars.

Many customers for now prefer gas-guzzling SUVs. And there are plenty of domestic competitors developing battery technology, such as Anhui Zotye Automobile <000980.SZ>, which recently struck an alliance with Ford . Tesla, for all its U.S. hype, has just around a 3 percent share of China's electric-vehicle market. It faces competition from Volvo , which is scrapping petrol-only vehicles from 2019, Daimler and General Motors .

There are nagging problems at home, too. Tesla produced just 260 of its new Model 3s in the third quarter, far short of the more than 1,500 that were targeted. Musk talked of "production hell" on the road to building half a million vehicles next year, or roughly five times as many as the company is likely to manage in 2017. A factory in China should in theory alleviate some of the strain, while reducing costs and customer wait times.

The manufacturing facility deal reported by the Wall Street Journal on Sunday would not alleviate a core problem, however. Cars produced in a factory wholly owned and located within Shanghai's free trade zone probably will be subject to the country's 25 percent import tax.

The only way to evade the levy would be a joint venture with a Chinese partner. Tesla, an unprofitable enterprise currently valued at 30 times expected EBITDA for the next year, so far has been reluctant to tie such a knot because of legitimate concerns about technology transfer. And yet it's hard to imagine how its mass-market models can be competitive in China with the tariff included. As useful as a local factory would be, it may give Tesla limited acceleration.

CONTEXT NEWS

- Tesla has reached an agreement with Shanghai officials to set up a manufacturing facility in the city's free trade zone, according a Wall Street Journal report published on Oct. 22, citing unnamed sources.

- The electric-car company said in June that it would "clearly define" its production plans in China by the end of the year. According to the news report, Tesla would likely still face 25 percent import duties on its factory-produced cars sold in China.

UPDATE 1-U.S. auto reliability dented by new technology; electric cars fare better - report - Reuters News

{{20171019T194806.178+0000}}UPDATE 1-U.S. auto reliability dented by new technology; electric cars fare better - report(Adds Tesla comment. Recasts throughout.)

By Joseph White

DETROIT, Oct 19 (Reuters) - New technology to stream music into dashboards or boost fuel efficiency is making cars less reliable, although electric cars such as the Tesla Model 3 and the Chevrolet Bolt should fare better than many conventional models, Consumer Reports magazine said on Thursday.

The magazine said its survey of 640,000 vehicles showed that all-new vehicles or models with newly updated technology are more likely than older models to have a "wonky engine, a jerky transmission, or high-tech features that fail outright."

Electric cars do away with many of the mechanical systems that prompt consumer complaints about conventional cars, the magazine said. Tesla Inc's Model 3, despite recent production problems, should have "average" reliability because it relies on technology already used on the older Tesla Model S, Jake Fisher, the magazine's head of automotive testing said on Thursday at a meeting of the Detroit Automotive Press Association.

The Bolt is the most reliable car in General Motors Co's Chevrolet brand, he said.

Tesla in a statement on Thursday criticized Consumer Reports because it previously declared the Model S "to be the best car ever and then revoked the rating after being questioned by Tesla skeptics." As for the Model 3, Tesla said "it's important to note that Consumer Reports has not yet driven a Model 3, let alone do they know anything substantial about how the Model 3 was designed and engineered."

The magazine's annual survey of new vehicle reliability predicts which cars will give owners fewer or more problems than their competitors, based on data collected. Its scorecard is influential among consumers and industry executives.

For the fifth straight year, Japanese automaker Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T> placed first in the magazine's ranking with the most reliable vehicles on average. General Motors Co's Cadillac brand was last among 27 brands ranked. Tesla ranked 21st on the list.

With many new cars, customers complain about problems with continuously variable transmissions and eight- and nine-speed gear boxes designed to boost fuel mileage, Fisher said.

Hard to use infotainment systems also continue to annoy customers, Fisher said. But over-the-air updates are helping automakers alleviate problems more quickly, he said.

Tesla's Model 3 gets an 'average' as new tech dents auto reliability - Consumer Reports - Reuters News

{{20171019T164500.870+0000}}Tesla's Model 3 gets an 'average' as new tech dents auto reliability - Consumer ReportsBy Joseph White

DETROIT, Oct 19 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc's new Model 3 sedan is likely to have "average" reliability despite production snags because it uses older technology rather than newer innovations that are causing problems for automakers, Consumer Reports magazine said on Thursday.

The magazine said its survey of 640,000 vehicles showed that all-new vehicles or models with newly updated technology are more likely than older models to have a wonky engine, a jerky transmission, or high-tech features that fail outright.

The magazine's annual survey of new vehicle reliability predicts which cars will give owners fewer or more problems than their competitors, based on data collected. Its scorecard is influential among consumers and industry executives.

For the fifth straight year, Japanese automaker Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T> placed first in the magazine's ranking with the most reliable vehicles on average. General Motors Co's Cadillac brand was last among 27 brands ranked. Tesla ranked 21st on the list.

The magazine's prediction that the Tesla Model 3, which has faced production bottlenecks, will have average reliability illustrates the challenges automakers face.

The Model 3 is the luxury electric vehicle maker's newest car, and Consumer Reports said it had no data on the vehicle. But it relies largely on technology the carmaker has used on its Model S sedan, which has been in production since 2012, and Consumer Reports said predicted reliability for that car is now "above average."

"Electric vehicles are inherently less complicated than gasoline or hybrid alternatives. The Model 3 is the least complicated Tesla yet," Consumer Reports said.

With many new cars, customers complain about problems with continuously variable transmissions and eight- and nine-speed gear boxes designed to boost fuel mileage, the magazine said.

Hard to use infotainment systems also continue to annoy customers. Consumer Reports said its survey found that owners of models in the first year of production reported twice as many complaints about vehicle electronics.

"More often than not, our data suggests it's prudent for consumers to wait for the technology to mature," Jake Fisher, head of Consumer Reports auto testing, said in a statement ahead of a presentation in Detroit.

Automakers are moving quickly to fix problems, the magazine said. After Korean automaker Hyundai Motor Co <005380.KS> got hit with complaints about the transmission on its 2016 Hyundai Tucson sport utility vehicle, the company took action that reduced complaints about the 2017 model by more than half, Consumer Reports said.

In July, Consumer Reports restored a top rating in its class for Tesla's Model S after the company updated the braking system. [nL3N1KG4MF]

UPDATE 3-Ford to recall 1.34 mln trucks in N.America for door latch fix - Reuters News

{{20171018T200227.320+0000}}UPDATE 3-Ford to recall 1.34 mln trucks in N.America for door latch fix(Adds details on bulletin to dealers, Ford comment)

By David Shepardson

WASHINGTON, Oct 18 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co said on Wednesday it would recall 1.34 million 2015-17 Ford F-150 and 2017 Ford Super Duty trucks in North America to add water shields to side door latches at a cost of $267 million.

The No.2 U.S. automaker said the safety recall is due to a frozen door latch or a bent or kinked actuation cable in the affected vehicles, that may result in a door not opening or closing.

A Ford spokeswoman, Elizabeth Weigandt, said customers would be notified next month but did not have a timetable for when parts will be available. Dealers will install water shields over the door latches and inspect and repair door latch cables if needed.

Ford has now recalled more than 5 million vehicles for varying door latch-related issues since 2016, but the company said the issue in the new recall is different from prior ones.

The company in November 2016 sent a bulletin to dealers that warned some 2015-2017 Ford F-150 trucks could have inoperative latches during freezing temperatures. The bulletin told dealers to install a rain shield to address the problem. The company initially alerted dealers in 2015 about the issue.

Weigandt said Ford's decision to issue a recall is driven by data. "When the data indicates a safety recall is needed, we move quickly," she said.

Ford said the cost of the new recall would be reflected in its fourth-quarter results. Ford said it continues to expect full-year adjusted earnings in the range of $1.65 to $1.85‍​ per share.

The company said it was not aware of any accidents or injuries associated with the issue but said because of the fault, the door may appear closed, increasing the risk of the door opening while driving.

Ford has previously disclosed plans to spend $935 million on other recalls announced since August 2016.

In March, Ford said it would spend $295 million to recall 211,000 vehicles in North America to replace potentially faulty side door latches and 230,000 vehicles for under-hood fire risks.

Ford previously recalled nearly 4 million vehicles for door latch issues in six separate recalls since 2014, including 2.4 million vehicles recalled in August 2016.

In September 2016, Ford said it was taking a $640 million charge for its expanded side-door latch recalls.

Ford shares fell 0.7 percent to $12.19 in late trading Wednesday.

Ford, PSA led European car sales decline in September - Reuters News

{{20171017T060002.028+0000}}Ford, PSA led European car sales decline in SeptemberPARIS, Oct 17 (Reuters) - French carmaker PSA Group and U.S. competitor Ford led a 2 percent decline in European car sales last month, according to industry data published on Tuesday.

September registrations fell to a combined 1.466 million cars in the European Union and European Free Trade Area (EFTA), the Brussels-based Association of European carmakers said.

Combined sales of PSA brands fell more than 5 percent, with Peugeot, DS and Opel/Vauxhall all recording year-on-year declines. Paris-based PSA acquired Opel earlier this year and began reporting registrations for the German brand in August.

Ford sales dropped 13 percent to 93,288 cars, while EU market leader Volkswagen saw its registrations slip 1.1 percent, weighed down by the VW brand's 3.2 percent drop.

Asian carmakers fared better last month, with Toyota's <7203.T> sales up 1.9 percent and Nissan <7201.T> recording a 3.3 percent gain. Hyundai <005380.KS> rose 2.1 percent as affiliate Kia <000270.KS> jumped 6.5 percent.

Toyota to test self-driving, talking cars by about 2020 - Reuters News

{{20171016T102603.750+0000}}Toyota to test self-driving, talking cars by about 2020TOKYO, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T> on Monday said it would begin testing self-driving electric cars around 2020, which will use artificial intelligence (AI) to engage with drivers, as the company competes with tech firms to develop new vehicles.

The car, whose concept model was unveiled earlier this year at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, will be able to converse with drivers, while building up knowledge of users' preferences, habits and emotions through deep learning, the company said.

"By using AI technology, we want to expand and enhance the driving experience, making cars an object of affection again," said Makoto Okabe, general manager of Toyota's EV business planning division.

Facing competition from rival automakers and tech companies to produce self-driving, intelligent cars, Toyota has committed $1 billion through 2020 to develop advanced automated driving and AI technology.

The Concept-i model, a battery-electric car which will have a cruising range of 300 kilometres (180 miles) on a single charge, will be able to estimate the emotions and alertness of drivers by reading their expressions, actions and tone of voice.

Using this information, the vehicle will be able to take over driving responsibilities when necessary -- after assessing the driver is too tired to drive safely, for example -- and also interact with the driver and passengers.

Facing a future where car ownership may be overtaken by new mobility services, automakers are ramping up investment to develop AI capabilities to enhance the driving experience.

Ford Motor Co earlier this year invested $1 billion in Argo AI, a start-up set up by former employees of Uber Technologies' self-driving car development team, to develop an on-demand self-driving car service. General Motors Co has also been investing in AI start-ups.

Honda Motor Co <7267.T.> and Softbank Corp <9984.T> announced last year that they were teaming up to use humanoid robotic technology in cars to enable them to communicate with drivers.

U.S. demands regional steel, aluminum in NAFTA auto rules -sources - Reuters News

{{20171013T222743.510+0000}}U.S. demands regional steel, aluminum in NAFTA auto rules -sources(Recasts throughout, adds details on U.S. proposal, steel impact)

By David Lawder

ARLINGTON, Va., Oct 13 (Reuters) - The Trump administration is demanding the use of North American-made steel, aluminum, copper and plastic resins in cars and trucks sold under North American Free Trade Agreement rules, as it seeks to give U.S. industry a boost.

People briefed on the matter said U.S. negotiators issued the proposal, which could force automakers to shift sourcing of some components to North America from Asia, during talks on Friday to overhaul NAFTA.

It calls for the inclusion of steel, aluminum and other raw materials on a so-called NAFTA tracing list for auto parts, according to the sources, referring to the mechanism by which the regional content level of cars, trucks and large engines is monitored and verified under the trade agreement.

The list would be greatly expanded under the U.S. proposal to cover a vast and complex web of automotive components, essentially eliminating the concept of "deemed originating," under which parts not listed get a free pass to tariff-free NAFTA access, no matter their origin.

In addition to the metals and plastics, the list would now include sophisticated automotive electronics, electric vehicle batteries and other parts not on the tracing list because they did not exist when NAFTA was negotiated by Canada, Mexico and the United States in the early 1990s.

If Washington prevails, the components would now need to be sourced from North America to count toward proposed sharply higher content levels, or companies would need to pay U.S. tariffs of around 2.5 percent on them.

People briefed on the U.S. proposal said it would lift the regional content threshold to 85 percent from the current 62.5 percent, with a 50 percent minimum U.S. content level. [nL2N1MO0U5]

A spokeswoman for the U.S. Trade Representative's office declined to comment on the auto industry proposal.

U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross has vowed to close "loopholes" in the parts list that he says allow too many cheap auto parts from Asia and other regions to enter the United States.

Ross has already sought to protect the U.S. steel and aluminum industries from subsidized imports with national security reviews that could lead to import restrictions.

Steel industry trade groups from all three NAFTA countries in June issued a joint statement calling for any renewal of the trade pact to require North American steel use in manufactured goods. [nL1N1J21D1]

However, two people briefed on the talks said the U.S. proposal stops short of labor unions' call for "melted and poured" North American steel, which would have precluded the use of raw steel from elsewhere that has been rolled or otherwise processed on the continent.

Automakers in North America largely already use North American steel but currently get no content value credit for it. Adding it to the tracing list would get a typical vehicle hundreds of dollars closer to meeting the goal.

But any such gains would be offset largely by the higher overall content thresholds and the need to find other sources for electronics, said Kristin Dziczek, a trade and labor economist with the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Michigan.

Dziczek and auto industry groups say that the U.S. content proposal was likely to backfire, with automakers and suppliers simply choosing to pay the 2.5 percent U.S. tariffs for passenger cars and many parts, sourcing more of them from China or other Asian countries.

"That could be the preferred trading route if NAFTA becomes too strict," she added.

UPDATE 1-Ford offers repairs to prevent exhaust leaks in 1.4 mln Explorers - Reuters News

{{20171013T191037.014+0000}}UPDATE 1-Ford offers repairs to prevent exhaust leaks in 1.4 mln Explorers(Adds stock price, class action lawsuit approved but not in effect)

By David Shepardson

WASHINGTON, Oct 13 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co said on Friday it will offer free repairs to North American owners of more than 1.4 million Explorer sport utility vehicles to help ensure that carbon monoxide and other exhaust gases cannot get into the vehicles, following the U.S. government's decision to upgrade an investigation in July.

Several U.S. police agencies have raised concerns about potentially deadly carbon monoxide gas entering the cabins of Ford Explorers that had been adapted for law enforcement uses. Federal regulators have said they are aware of more than 2,700 complaints for exhaust odors as well as reports of three crashes and 41 injuries that may be linked to exposure to carbon monoxide among police and civilian 2011-2017 Explorer vehicles.

Ford said its investigation has not found "carbon monoxide levels that exceed what people are exposed to every day" in the 1.4 million civilian vehicles. There is no U.S. government standard for in-vehicle carbon monoxide levels. Ford says it believes the vehicles are safe and is making the offer, which it is not classifying as a recall, in response to customer concerns.

The second largest U.S. automaker said starting November 1, dealers will reprogram the air conditioner, replace the liftgate drain valves and inspect sealing of the rear of the vehicle. The fix covers about 1.3 million U.S. vehicles and about 100,000 in Canada and Mexico.

Ford declined to comment on the potential financial impact of the service offer that will last through the end of 2018.

Ford shares fell 0.7 percent to $12.04 in afternoon trading.

The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) in July upgraded and expanded a probe into 1.33 million Ford Explorer SUVs over reports of exhaust odors in vehicle compartments and exposure to carbon monoxide.

Police agencies have reported two crashes that may be linked to carbon monoxide exposure and a third incident involving injuries related to carbon monoxide exposure.

NHTSA said it is evaluating preliminary testing that suggests carbon monoxide levels may be elevated in certain driving scenarios.

Ford has issued four technical service bulletins related to the exhaust odor issue to address complaints from police fleets and other owners.

In July, Ford said it would pay to repair police versions of its Ford Explorer SUVs to correct possible carbon monoxide leaks that may be linked to crashes and injuries after some police reports temporarily halted use of the vehicles over carbon monoxide concerns.

The city of Austin, Texas said in July it would remove all 400 of the city's Ford Explorer SUVs from use for additional testing and repairs after the city said 20 police officers were found with elevated levels of carbon monoxide. The department returned the vehicles to service after repairs and testing.

In 2016, Ford agreed to settle a U.S. class-action lawsuit involving 1 million 2011-2015 Explorer SUVs over exhaust odor complaints, including reimbursements of up to $500 for repairs and the company agreed to make repairs. That settlement was approved in June but has not taken effect because of a penidng appeal.

EXCLUSIVE-U.S. seeks to include steel, aluminum in NAFTA autos rules-sources - Reuters News

{{20171013T161138.471+0000}}EXCLUSIVE-U.S. seeks to include steel, aluminum in NAFTA autos rules-sources(Adds details, analyst comment)

By David Lawder

WASHINGTON, Oct 13 (Reuters) - The Trump administration is seeking to use NAFTA to boost the U.S. steel and other basic materials industries by proposing stricter automotive content rules that require the use of North American-made steel, aluminum, copper and plastic resins.

Three people who were briefed on the matter said that the U.S. rules of origin proposal would put these materials on the North American Free Trade Agreement's auto parts tracing list for the first time.

The list is used to verify the regional content level of vehicles and parts so that they can qualify for tariff-free shipment to all three NAFTA countries.

U.S. negotiators submitted their rules of origin proposal to Mexican and Canadian counterparts on Friday. Other sources briefed on the talks said the proposal includes raising the threshold for overall North American value content for cars, trucks and large engines to 85 percent from the current 62.5 percent and a first-ever U.S.-specific content requirement of 50 percent. [nL2N1MO0U5]

A spokeswoman for the U.S. Trade Represntative's office declined to comment on the autos proposal.

U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross has vowed to close "loopholes" in the parts list that he says allow too many cheap auto parts from Asia and other regions to enter the United States.

The proposal would also give a boost to the steel and aluminum industries that Ross has sought to protect from subsidized imports with national security reviews.

In some ways, the proposed steel, aluminum, copper and plastics requirement would help vehicle and parts makers meet the higher thresholds. Auto plants in North America already largely use North American steel and aluminum, but the metals' value does not count towards reaching the threshold because it is not on the tracing list.

But the bigger problem is that President Donald Trump's administration also wants the auto parts tracing list expanded to include many components in modern cars and trucks that did not exist when NAFTA was first negotiated in the early 1990s, such as sophisticated electronics that largely come from Asia.

Gains from tracing steel and aluminum would be offset by the higher overall content thresholds and the need to find other sources for electronics, said Kristin Dziczek, a trade and labor economist with the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Michigan.

Dziczek and auto industry groups say that the U.S. content proposal is likely to backfire, with automakers and suppliers simply choosing to pay the 2.5 percent U.S. tariffs for passenger cars and many parts, sourcing more of them from China and other low wage countries in Asia.

"That could be the preferred trading route if NAFTA becomes too strict, and that means content could come from any country with most favored nation status," she added.

U.S. unveils proposal to boost autos content in NAFTA -sources - Reuters News

{{20171013T140715.474+0000}}U.S. unveils proposal to boost autos content in NAFTA -sourcesWASHINGTON, Oct 13 (Reuters) - The United States on Friday formally unveiled proposals to boost the amount of regional content that autos must contain to qualify for NAFTA tariff-free access, three sources familiar with the negotiations told Reuters on Friday.

The sources were not immediately able to provide details of the proposal, one of the Trump administration's key demands at talks to modernize the North American Free Trade Agreement.

Canada and Mexico, the other two members of the pact, oppose the idea.

BEIJING, Oct 13 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co saw its China vehicle sales make the barest of increases in September, extending a tough run in the world's largest auto market even as global rivals have logged robust gains.

The U.S. automaker has lacked a high-volume brand of affordable entry cars for China and has been criticised for slow decision-making that has cost it share in a market where consumer tastes change quickly.

In response, it has brought in a new China head, Jason Luo, a Chinese-born American formerly at U.S.-based air bag maker Key Safety Systems, tasked with building closer ties with Ford's local partners and working more effectively with regulators.

The U.S. carmaker sold 112,902 vehicles in China last month, an increase of some 430 from the same period a year earlier.

By contrast, rivals Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T>, Honda Motor Co <7267.T> and Nissan Motor Co Ltd <7201.T> saw gains of 14 percent or more while General Motors posted an increase of 7 percent.

Overall vehicles sales in China rose 5.7 percent in September - a fourth straight month of growth. [nL4N1MN2DM]

Like many other global automakers, Ford is also looking to revamp its strategy towards electric vans and cars to keep up with Beijing's push for cleaner new-energy vehicles (NEV). [nL4N1ME2KZ]

The country has set strict quotas for NEVs which carmakers must meet by 2019, a move that is prompting a flurry of electric car deals and new launches of electric and hybrid models. Ford said it was looking to set up an electric car venture with Chinese firm Anhui Zotye Automobile Co <000980.SZ> in August.

UPDATE 3-GM to scale back production at Detroit sedan plant  - Reuters News

{{20171012T162309.516+0000}}UPDATE 3-GM to scale back production at Detroit sedan plant (Adds GM statement, recasts first paragraph)

By Nick Carey and David Shepardson

DETROIT/WASHINGTON, Oct 12 (Reuters) - General Motors Co said on Thursday it plans to scale back production at an assembly plant in Detroit starting later this month as it tries to deal with declining U.S. sedan sales

GM said in a statement that effective Oct. 20 its Detroit-Hamtramck plant "will operate under a reduced production schedule."

"This action will help maintain more stable production," the No. 1 U.S. carmaker said.

The statement followed reports that GM plans to shut the plant for about six weeks from mid-November and lay off about 1,500 workers then cut production roughly 20 percent once operations resume, according to a source familiar with the plans.

That output cut would lead to around 200 lost jobs. The move was originally reported by the Wall Street Journal. (http://on.wsj.com/2yiJWSh)

General Motors declined to comment on those reports.

The Hamtramck plant makes four poorly performing sedan models, including the Buick LaCrosse, sales of which are down 21.5 percent year to date, and the Chevrolet Impala, which is down 31.8 percent.

Both GM and rival Ford Motor Co have struggled to rein in high inventories of passenger cars as consumers have shifted to buying pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles. Consultants have blamed a large portion of the U.S. auto industry's excessive inventories of unsold vehicles on GM.

Domestic manufacturers "continue to face steep competition in the passenger car segment and production must be aligned with waning sales in order to reduce the elevated amounts of inventory," Buckingham Research Group analyst Joseph Amaturo wrote in a client note about the Hamtramck news.

Earlier this year, GM eliminated the plant's second shift, saying it was laying off around 1,200 workers.

GM has reduced the number of shifts at five plants. The automaker announced last month that it would cut the third shift at its plant in Spring Hill, Tennessee, as of late November.

A GM spokesman said there are no plans to reinstate any of those shifts at this time.

Although the eliminated shifts employed 6,000 hourly and salaried workers, GM's actual layoffs have been smaller. A spokesman said GM has let go 2,300 temporary workers and 800 hourly, union-represented workers have been laid off, for a total of 3,100 job cuts so far.

GM has found alternative work for 2,900 affected hourly workers.

Production cuts slice into revenue but also could help automakers avoid deeper price cuts on vehicles they can sell.[nL2N1M022H]

General Motors shares were down 0.9 percent at $45.04 in early afternoon trading.

Oxford to become first UK city to ban petrol and diesel cars from centre - Reuters News

{{20171012T110657.387+0000}}Oxford to become first UK city to ban petrol and diesel cars from centreBy Costas Pitas

LONDON, Oct 12 (Reuters) - The university city of Oxford has unveiled plans to ban petrol and diesel cars from its centre as part of the most radical set of proposals so far in Britain to curb pollution.

Whilst London is rolling out an "ultra low emission zone", which will see the most gas-guzzling vehicles pay daily charges to enter the city centre from 2020, Oxford's "Zero Emission Zone" will ban emitting vehicles from entering part of the city centre from that date.

Since German carmaker Volkswagen admitted in 2015 to cheating U.S. emissions tests, politicians around the world have unveiled plans to clamp down on diesel vehicles in a bid to improve air quality and meet more stringent targets.

"All of us who drive or use petrol or diesel vehicles through Oxford are contributing to the city's toxic air," said city council board member John Tanner.

"Everyone needs to do their bit – from national government and local authorities to businesses and residents – to end this public health emergency."

Oxford will also introduce reduced parking fees for electric vehicles and electric-taxi ranks.

In the first stage of its plans from 2020, taxis, cars, light commercial vehicles and buses which are non zero-emission, will be banned from six streets in the city centre, including near the world-famous Oxford Union debating society.

The zone will be gradually widened to include more streets and further vehicle types until 2035 when all emitting vehicles, including lorries, will be banned from the centre.

Local politicians will draw up the final plans after a consultation closes on Nov. 26.

Britain has said it will ban the sale of all new diesel and petrol cars from 2040, replicating plans by France and the mayors of Paris, Madrid, Mexico City and Athens, who aim to ban diesel vehicles from their city centres by 2025.

UPDATE 1-China monthly vehicle sales rise again; may miss annual target -industry body - Reuters News

{{20171012T075836.129+0000}}UPDATE 1-China monthly vehicle sales rise again; may miss annual target -industry body* China Sept vehicle sales +5.7 pct, YTD +4.5 pct

* Fourth consecutive month of rising sales

* China may not hit 5 pct annual growth forecast- industry body

* NEV Sept sales +79.1 pct, set to hit annual target

(Adds details on new full-year target, new energy vehicle sales)

BEIJING, Oct 12 (Reuters) - China's vehicles sales rose in September for a fourth straight month, an industry body said on Thursday, but added that the market may struggle to hit a forecast for 5 percent annual growth set earlier in the year.

The world's largest auto market may not hit growth levels estimated by the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers in January, "but 4 percent and above should be pretty much a sure thing", said Shi Jianhua, CAAM's deputy secretary general.

Vehicle sales in China have rebounded since June, but CAAM's caution on full-year growth underlines challenges in the market, which saw a slow start to the year due to tax incentives on smaller-engined cars being phased out.

China vehicle sales touched 2.71 million units in September, up 5.7 percent from a year ago, CAAM data showed.

That took year-to-date sales to 20.2 million vehicles, up 4.5 percent against the same period in 2016. Vehicle sales in the country rose 13.7 percent last year.

Recent sales have been relatively strong - growing 5.3 percent in August, 6.2 percent in July and 4.5 percent in June - underpinned by stronger overall economic growth and increased incentives for buyers, market watchers said.

Most global carmakers are seeing positive sales in China: Japan's Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T>, Honda Motor Co <7267.T>, Nissan Motor Co Ltd <7201.T> and U.S. carmaker General Motors posted higher growth this week. [nL4N1ML2CD]

Ford Motor Co , set to report September sales later this week, has lagged its global peers in China this year.

CAAM data showed sales of new energy vehicles (NEV) shot up 79.1 percent in September amid a government push to support the sector and shift away from traditional petrol engine cars in the long term. NEV sales so far this year have totalled 398,000, up 37.7 percent against 2016.

China is expected to meet a sales target of 700,000 NEV units this year, CAAM official Chen Shihua said at a briefing in Beijing, referring to all-electric battery vehicles as well as plug-in petrol-electric hybrids.

The country has set strict quotas for NEVs which carmakers must meet by 2019, a move that is prompting a flurry of electric car deals and new launches of electric and hybrid models as firms look to ensure they do not fall short.

U.S. dealer lobby head criticizes automakers' bonus program - Reuters News

{{20171010T163000.861+0000}}U.S. dealer lobby head criticizes automakers' bonus programBy Nick Carey

DETROIT, Oct 10 (Reuters) - The head of the National Automobile Dealers Association (NADA) on Tuesday criticized automakers' use of so-called stair-step bonus programs, calling them harmful to U.S. auto dealers, to consumer confidence and brand loyalty.

In a speech in Detroit, NADA Chairman Mark Scarpelli said the practice results in "wild discrepancies and fluctuations" in vehicles prices between different dealers, as well as a "lack of consistency, lack of transparency, and lack of explanation" that lead directly to a "lack of trust" in auto dealers and in vehicle brands, he said

Stair-step bonuses are paid out to dealers on an escalating scale as they hit progressively higher sales targets. Dealers that fall short of targets receive nothing.

In the past, dealers and dealer groups have criticized Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV , Nissan Motor Co Ltd <7201.T> and Ford Motor Co for using stair-step programs.

NADA commissioned a study into automakers' stair-step programs by Boston-based consultancy Analysis Group, Scarpelli said, whose results it will share with automakers and use them as the basis for discussion.

The NADA, a trade association that represents around 16,500 auto dealers, has an influential presence in Washington, built largely on dealers' engagement with and support for local members of Congress.

Scarpelli's speech comes at a time when major automakers and their dealers are coming off a strong run in U.S. new-vehicle sales that lasted from the end of the Great Recession and culminated in record sales of 17.55 million units in 2016.

This year's sales figures are expected to dip slightly, putting pressure on carmakers and their dealers to sell off high levels of inventory.

At a time the industry likely finds itself in the middle of a "lengthier sales plateau," Scarpelli said, it is critical for dealers and manufacturers to work together.

In his speech Scarpelli also cited rising concerns from auto dealers about "increasing attempts by their manufacturer partners to run their stores" and mandate investments in expensive, and possibly unnecessary, facility upgrades.

UPDATE 1-Brazil auto industry sees 2018 sales, output growth over 10 pct - Reuters News

{{20171009T214244.384+0000}}UPDATE 1-Brazil auto industry sees 2018 sales, output growth over 10 pct(Adds details, context, investment news)

By Alberto Alerigi Jr.

SAO PAULO, Oct 9 (Reuters) - Auto industry leaders projected sales and output growth of more than 10 percent in Brazil next year at an industry event on Monday, underscoring hopes for a rebounding market as Mercedes-Benz announced new investments in bus and truck plants.

Antonio Megale, the head of industry group Anfavea, said global automakers in Brazil would likely produce some 3 million vehicles next year, up from an estimated 2.7 million this year but well below the 3.7 million made at the market's 2013 peak.

Vehicle sales should also pick up from 7.3 percent growth forecast this year to double-digit growth next year, he said at the Congresso Autodata Perspectivas 2018 event in Sao Paulo, adding to hopes for a market that shrank 40 percent in the last three years.

"We're past the trickiest part of the crisis," he said. "Healthy sales growth along with strong exports mean we will have better production numbers."

Adding to enthusiasm, the Mercedes-Benz unit of Daimler AG announced plans to invest 2.4 billion reais ($750 million) from 2018 to 2022 in Brazilian plants making bus and truck chassis.

Mercedes-Benz executives said in a statement that the upgrades to factories would prepare the company for a rebound in commercial vehicle sales, led by a surging farm sector and signs of recovery in mining, fuel distribution and meat processing.

The top executive for General Motors Co in Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay, Carlos Zarlenga, said at the event that his company was also planning to invest more in the region.

"We're not done with the investment announcements and we'll have more soon," he told the audience. ($1 = 3.18 reais)

UPDATE 2-GM to buy sensor-tech firm Strobe to speed up self-driving car push - Reuters News

{{20171009T155330.865+0000}}UPDATE 2-GM to buy sensor-tech firm Strobe to speed up self-driving car pushBy Nick Carey

DETROIT, Oct 9 (Reuters) - No. 1 U.S. automaker General Motors Co said on Monday it would buy Strobe Inc, which uses LIDAR technology to help self-driving cars identify objects at a distance, to boost its push into the market for self-driving vehicles.

LIDAR is one of the major sensor technologies used in autonomous vehicles. There is fierce competition between large automakers to bring autonomous, or self-driving, vehicles to market first.

Fully self-driving vehicles are expected to hit the market in a limited form by around 2020. GM and its U.S. rival Ford Motor Co have both publicly stated that they aim to have fully self-driving cars on sale by 2021.

"Strobe's LIDAR technology will significantly improve the cost and capabilities of our vehicles so that we can more quickly accomplish our mission to deploy driverless vehicles at scale," Kyle Vogt, chief executive of GM's Cruise Automation unit, said in a statement.

GM did not say how much it was paying for Strobe.

Vogt said last week that the unit was making "rapid progress" toward deploying self-driving cars. [L2N1ME18X]

By Nick Carey

DETROIT, Oct 9 (Reuters) - No. 1 U.S. automaker General Motors Co said on Monday it would buy Strobe Inc, which uses LIDAR technology to help self-driving cars identify objects at a distance, to speed up development of autonomous vehicles and slash sensor costs.

LIDAR is one of the major sensor technologies used in autonomous, or self-driving vehicles, and there is fierce competition between large automakers to bring the cars to market first.

Fully self-driving vehicles are expected to hit the market in a limited form by around 2020. GM and its U.S. rival Ford Motor Co have both publicly stated that they aim to have fully self-driving cars on sale by 2021. "This acquisition is a game changer for GM and Cruise," because of the cost savings it will bring," Kyle Vogt, chief executive of GM's Cruise Automation unit, said.

"We've made this acquisition because we aim to speed our path to market," he added.

Strobe's new microchip LIDAR system would significantly enhance the capabilities of the self-driving cars GM was developing, Vogt said in a blog post and on a conference call with reporters.

By reducing the entire sensor down to a single chip, Strobe's system should reduce the cost of each LIDAR on its self-driving cars by 99 percent, he said.

The technology provided not just a distance measurement for an object on the road - vehicles, people and objects - but also measured that object's velocity.

"This is really important for self-driving cars, especially in challenging situations," Vogt said.

Vogt did not disclose financial terms, but said 11 full-time Strobe employees would join Cruise as part of the deal.

He said last week that the unit was making "rapid progress" toward deploying self-driving cars in part through testing vehicles on the crowded streets of San Francisco. [L2N1ME18X]

Ford taps Silicon Valley startup to build transportation software - Reuters News

{{20171009T151323.332+0000}}Ford taps Silicon Valley startup to build transportation softwareBy Paul Lienert

Oct 9 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co has begun to develop new transportation service applications using a software platform developed by Autonomic Inc, a small Silicon Valley startup.

One of the first such businesses is a "microtransit" service called Non-Emergency Medical Transport, launched this summer by Ford and Michigan-based Beaumont Hospital. Patients can schedule pickups and appointments from a mobile app that was built on the Autonomic software platform, said Sundeep Madra, Autonomic's chief executive officer and co-founder.

Vehicle manufacturers are exploring a wide array of digital services to supplement their existing businesses, including ride-hailing, car-sharing and delivery of food and goods. However, when it comes to developing consumer-facing smartphone apps and the data systems behind them, automakers have lagged Silicon Valley rivals.

Ford in the past month has announced partnerships with Domino's and Lyft, using self-driving vehicles developed by Ford and its Argo affiliate. [nL2N1M80X2] The Dearborn, Michigan automaker is also experimenting with a service called Chariot that offers access to van rides.

Ford CEO Jim Hackett mentioned the automaker's investment in Autonomic during a presentation to investors last week. The 15-month-old company is developing "an open platform for transportation" on which Ford plans to build new in-vehicle and mobility-related services with a variety of partners, Hackett said.

If Ford elects to build its own ride-hailing or fleet management businesses, the Autonomic software platform could enable digital payment processing and customer identification, as well as directing the flow of data between the vehicle and the customer, according to a source familiar with the automaker's plans.

Using the Autonomic software platform as a base, along with data from the vehicles, Ford and its partners then could build and charge consumers for products and services, said Marcy Klevorn, Ford president of mobility.

Klevorn cited FordPass as an earlier example of a software platform that has enabled Ford to provide digital services to subscribers, from parking to payments.

In an investor briefing on Tuesday, Jim Farley, Ford president of global markets, said the most important part of the company's strategy in self-driving vehicles "is a diverse group of revenue streams . . . not just one revenue stream like ride- hailing, but multiple revenue streams," including providing digital content to vehicle occupants.

Denso to invest $1 bln in Tennessee plant, create 1,000 jobs - Reuters News

{{20171006T152807.081+0000}}Denso to invest $1 bln in Tennessee plant, create 1,000 jobs(.)

By Nick Carey

DETROIT, Oct 6 (Reuters) - Japanese auto parts supplier Denso Corp <6902.T> plans to invest $1 billion in its Maryville, Tennessee plant to develop vehicle electrification and safety systems, creating around 1,000 jobs.

This is the latest in a series of announcements from automakers rushing to bring a large number of electric vehicle models to market in the coming years.

Policymakers in key markets such as China are pushing a shift to electric cars from internal combustion engines over the next two to three decades, while relatively new rival Tesla Inc is gaining momentum, pressuring traditional automakers to crank up plans for fully electric vehicles.

Denso said in a statement the investment would expand multiple production lines at the facility to produce advanced safety, connectivity and electrification products for hybrid and electric vehicles. The new jobs will include production workers, technicians and engineers.

"We are seeing dramatic shifts in the role of transportation in society, and this investment will help position us to meet those changing demands," Kenichiro Ito, chairman of Denso's North American board, said in a statement.

In 2015 the auto supplier announced a $400 million investment in Maryville and the creation of 500 jobs.

Last week, Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T> announced a joint venture with partner Mazda Motor Corp <7261.T> to develop electric vehicle technology. Toyota will take a 90 percent stake in the joint venture while Mazda and Denso, Toyota's biggest supplier, will each take 5 percent. [nL4N1M91ER]

No. 1 U.S. automaker General Motors Co said this week it would add 20 new battery electric and fuel cell vehicles to its global lineup by 2023. [nL2N1MD1YS]

A day later, Ford Motor Co said it planned to slash $14 billion in costs over the next five years and shift capital investment away from sedans and internal combustion engines to develop more trucks and electric and hybrid cars.

Ford delays Fiesta recall in China due to spare part issues -media - Reuters News

{{20171006T095919.652+0000}}Ford delays Fiesta recall in China due to spare part issues -mediaBEIJING, Oct 6 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co has postponed a planned recall of its Fiesta ST cars in China, the world's top auto market, due to delays in the delivery of spare parts for repairs, state media Xinhua reported on Friday.

The recall, involving 435 imported cars produced from Feb. 15, 2013 to Nov. 11, 2014, will start on Nov. 20, more than two months behind schedule, it said citing the company.

The vehicles will be pulled from the market due to defects in the engine cooling system, which could lead to leaks of coolant and a risk of engine fire, it said.

While the scale of the recall is small compared with other incidents, the issue is the latest misstep in China by the No. 2 U.S. automaker. [nL4N1ME2KZ][nL1N1CX0FZ] [nB9N1KU02L]

In August, China's General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine said Ford would recall 37,734 Explorer SUVs due to steering wheel dust cover problems.

According to the Xinhua report, the company said owners should contact dealers as soon as the recall starts to have the component replaced.

RPT-INSIGHT-Awaiting better days, multinationals keep Venezuela units alive - barely - Reuters News

{{20171006T050702.479+0000}}RPT-INSIGHT-Awaiting better days, multinationals keep Venezuela units alive - barelyBy Eyanir Chinea and Corina Pons

VALENCIA, Venezuela, Oct 6 (Reuters) - Venezuelan auto worker Celso Nunez spends his days moonlighting as a mover and trading salvaged building materials in his worn-out red pick-up.

His employer, Ford Motor Co , does not mind.

In fact, it is paying him to stay off the job.

With Venezuela's economy in shambles, Ford has furloughed Nunez and 1200 colleagues at its moribund plant here in Valencia, Venezuela's third-largest city. The company said it wants to call them back when times are better.

Nunez hasn't reported for work in ten months, save for a few days in September to work on a prototype for a new cargo truck. But he still collects a quarter of his weekly salary of 50,000 bolivars, the equivalent of just $1.70 at the widely used black-market exchange rate.

The father of two teenagers counts himself lucky.

"Ford has given me stability ... to help my family," said Nunez, proudly wearing his blue factory shirt after a recent meeting at the plant about the new prototype.

"We know it's not their fault, it's the national situation."

Ford is among roughly 150 multinationals still hanging on in Venezuela. The once-prosperous OPEC nation is now in the fourth year of a recession caused by a fall in oil prices and, economists say, failed policies of its socialist government.

A dearth of raw materials and plummeting demand has led many to halt or vastly scale back production, furloughing many employees in a country where labor laws ban mass layoffs.

A handful of companies, including Clorox , Kimberly-Clark , General Mills , General Motors and Harvest Natural Resources , have given up entirely, abandoning assets or selling them cheap.[nL1N1DG0JM]

Most multinationals, however, say they want to keep at least a minimum presence to be ready for a future upturn in Venezuela, home to the world's largest proven oil reserves.

In Valencia, retrenchment by multinationals including Fiat Chrysler , Colgate Palmolive , Johnson & Johnson and Nestle SA have rendered the city a near ghost town.

Last week, Nestle suspended operations at a baby food plant there, blaming a lack of supplies. In a statement, Nestle said it continues to pay the plant's 80 workers and remains committed to Venezuela and about 3200 employees at other factories there.

DUST ON SEMI-ASSEMBLED CARS

At Ford, the company said its Valencia factory had assembled about 400 cars through August of this year, compared with 17,000 units in 2012. Still, the No. 2 U.S. automaker said in an e-mail it "has no plans to leave the country."

The drastically reduced work schedules, it added, is a way to "adapt to the local market's needs."

Ford began selling cars in dollars in 2015 so it could buy parts without requesting hard currency via government exchange controls. Other automakers followed suit, but have not been able to sell many cars because few Venezuelans can afford them.

Venezuela's car assembly output slumped to 2,849 units in 2016 from a record 172,418 units in 2007, according to auto industry group Cavenez. Sales, including imports, plunged to 3,008 last year from 491,899 in 2007.

At dealerships including Ford, Chrysler and Toyota, Venezuelan-made luxury vehicles sit without buyers, priced as much as $20,000 more than in other countries. Costs are inflated by imported parts and few economies of scale, analysts said.

To stay afloat in such conditions, Ford and other multinationals have shortened shifts, reduced payrolls and focused on cheaper products, according to unions and company officials.

The cutbacks make for scenes like that at the Fiat Chrysler plant in Valencia, where dust gathers on semi-assembled 2016 Jeep Cherokees, still missing windshields and mirrors.

On a recent day, about 20 employees stood at the entrance to the plant, which sold more than 25,000 units in 2007 but only about 150 this year.

About 60 percent of workers stay home, earning a fraction of their salaries. The rest come in but are confined to maintenance and administrative activities, employees and union leaders said.

Despite the tough conditions, Fiat Chrysler has told employees it does not plan to close, said Henry Ospina of the Fiat Chrysler union.

"But there is anxiety," he said.

A Fiat Chrysler spokesman said the company was making "its best efforts to keep production at levels adequate to the availability of inputs and components." The company declined further comment.

"PSEUDO-EMPLOYEES," FREE FOOD

Though many multinational workers said they feel like "pseudo-employees," they fare better than most unemployed Venezuelans, who struggle to buy food and medicine. Payments from state welfare programs lag the triple-digit inflation.

As of April 2016, half of Venezuela's working population was either jobless or employed only in part-time, "informal" jobs, like street vending, according to the last available official statistics.

Compounding the pain, consumer spending slumped by 15 percent last year and is expected to decline by yet another 25 percent this year, according to local consulting group Ecoanalitica.

Venezuelan businesses are enduring their worst moment in decades, with at least two in every 10 factories halted, according to a Conindustria, the country's main industry association.

President Nicolas Maduro's government defends policies, like widely-criticized currency controls, that many businesses say wrecked the economy. He blames the halving of international oil prices since 2014, which slashed Venezuela's revenues.

Maduro also accuses foreign firms of intentionally limiting investment and production as part of an "economic war" waged by political opponents and the United States.

The Information Ministry did not respond to a request for comment.

At some multinationals, furloughed employees are still allowed to eat lunch at cafeterias of halted plants - a big perk at a time of increasing hunger.

Fiat Chrysler serves up staples like chicken, rice, pasta and plantains daily to 60 of its 800 workers. A schedule prioritizes the neediest.

Similar arrangements exist at Colgate-Palmolive and Johnson & Johnson.

"It's one meal I don't have to pay for at home," said Pedro Rodriguez, 44, who has worked just six days this year at Fiat Chrysler, his employer of two decades.

"There are colleagues who only eat half the meals and take the other half home because the situation is tough."

TIRES AS SEVERANCE

To get around strict layoff rules, many multinationals have offered voluntary buyouts.

Ford launched a "voluntary separation program" in 2016 that about 800 employees, or 40 percent of its workforce, signed onto. Many use the severance payments to start businesses like bakeries or selling construction materials, workers said.

But many of these ventures are now struggling, too.

At Fiat Chrysler, a severance offer included four new tires, each of which is worth the equivalent of a monthly factory wage in Venezuela. As of August, 23 workers had accepted: some planned to sell their tires and use the proceeds to emigrate.

Elsewhere in Valencia, multinationals have struggled to adapt to other government rules, including strict price controls for some products like milk and soap. The prices rarely keep up with inflation.

For instance, a Colgate-Palmolive soap plant has been shut since February. Workers there said company officials told them it could not cover costs if it sold soap at the mandated price, equal to less than $0.01 per soap bar at the black-market exchange rate.

Colgate-Palmolive in Venezuela did not respond to requests for comment.

Workers said Colgate recently restarted production of price-controlled toothpaste, packaged in brown cardboard. The recycled boxes are cheaper than its usual red packaging.

Earlier, it stopped producing children's flavors and toothpaste with whitener, reducing its portfolio of 300 products to less than a dozen, said union representative Felix Bello.

Johnson & Johnson, which once sold everything from mouthwash to moisturizers, now only produces panty liners, a feminine hygiene product.

Still, the U.S. drugmaker agreed not to lay off any of its 157 Venezuelan factory employees.

Only three of the factory's seven production lines are in operation, said union representative Jaime Guevara. Workers not on the production line do maintenance work.

"Johnson & Johnson has a responsibility to our employees and the communities in which we live and work," a company spokeswoman said.

NEW YORK, Oct 5 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Ford boss Jim Hackett's plan to catch up with rival GM on electric and self-driving vehicles starts with $14 bln of cost cuts. China may be in pole position as it considers banning gasoline cars entirely. But plenty of factors could delay mass adoption of new technology.

INTERVIEW-As Ford pushes into electric vehicles, U.S. union aims to save jobs - Reuters News

{{20171005T183608.426+0000}}INTERVIEW-As Ford pushes into electric vehicles, U.S. union aims to save jobsBy Nick Carey

DETROIT, Oct 5 (Reuters) - The United Auto Workers is talking with Ford Motor Co about ways to avoid layoffs as the No. 2 U.S. automaker builds more electric vehicles, a senior union official told Reuters on Thursday.

Ford told investors Tuesday it planned to slash $14 billion in costs over the next five years and shift investments away from internal combustion engines and sedans to develop more trucks, plus electric and hybrid cars. [L4N1ME3GX] [L2N1MD12P]

"We've been doing our due diligence to find out how much it (electrification) means to us," UAW Vice President Jimmy Settles, head of the union's Ford department said in a telephone interview. "We put them on notice early on that we want to be part of this process."

"Up to this point they (Ford) have been agreeable that it's in the best interest of the company and also our members for us to be part of the process," he added.

Ford's push into electric comes after Detroit rival General Motors Co unveiled plans to add 20 new battery electric and fuel cell vehicles to its global lineup by 2023. [L2N1MD1YS]

Ford's presentation to investors this week under new chief executive Jim Hackett, included a slide touting a 30 percent reduction in "hours per unit" to build electric vehicles.

Fewer hours mean fewer workers.

German automaker Daimler AG warned last month that electric Mercedes models would initially be just half as profitable as conventional alternatives - forcing the group to find savings by outsourcing more component manufacturing, which may in turn threaten German jobs. [nL5N1LS5EL]

The UAW's Settles said he had met one-on-one with Hackett, a former CEO of office furniture maker Steelcase Inc and in a meeting with union leaders in recent weeks.

He said Hackett's message had been that he wants to find new opportunities for UAW workers as electrification evolves.

"The assembly may be different, but he's not looking to eliminate any jobs," Settles said of Hackett. "He's been consistent in what he's saying and I'm optimistic he means it."

The UAW vice president said the union and automaker had assembled teams to discuss future jobs, including for production workers and skilled trades workers, Settles said.

Settles said Ford's announcement in March that it would invest $200 million on a new data center in Michigan could create new union-represented, technology-related jobs.

"We need further communications on what it means in terms of jobs," he said.

Ford has completed 85 percent of its 2015 union contract target of creating or retaining 8,500 union jobs by 2019 and could hit 100 percent by the end of 2017, Settles said.

A Ford spokeswoman said the company and the UAW are in "constant communications about the business."

Brazil auto output falls 9.2 pct in September from August - Reuters News

{{20171005T145052.697+0000}}Brazil auto output falls 9.2 pct in September from AugustSAO PAULO, Oct 5 (Reuters) - Automobile production in Brazil fell 9.2 percent and sales dropped 8 percent in September from August, the national automakers' association said on Thursday, due in part to three fewer working days last month.

Automakers in Brazil produced about 236,900 new cars and trucks last month, while sales totaled some 199,200 vehicles, according to data released by industry group Anfavea. Compared to a year ago, auto output rose 39.1 percent and sales increased 24.5 percent.

Brazil was one of the world's five biggest auto markets until its current recession and it remains a major base of operations for Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV , Volkswagen AG , General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co .

UPDATE 1-UK car sales set for first annual decline since 2011 after September slump - Reuters News

{{20171005T091913.621+0000}}UPDATE 1-UK car sales set for first annual decline since 2011 after September slump(Adds details, quotes, background, figures)

By Costas Pitas

LONDON, Oct 5 (Reuters) - British new car registrations on Thursday appeared on course for their first annual fall since 2011 after a 9.3 percent tumble in September, a month which normally accounts for around 15 percent of demand.

Sales were hurt by business and political uncertainty as Britain prepares to leave the EU and confusion over government plans on diesel and petrol cars, which could include new levies or restrictions, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said.

Sales totaled 426,170 vehicles with demand falling across the board, SMMT data showed, leaving year-to-date registrations down 3.9 percent.

"This decline will cause considerable concern," SMMT Chief Executive Mike Hawes said.

"Business and political uncertainty is reducing buyer confidence, with consumers and businesses more likely to delay big ticket purchases."

Demand has fallen year on year since April due to a combination of factors including an increased vehicle excise duty, weaker consumer confidence and record sales in 2015 and 2016.

But September is normally a strong month for car sales, partly due to the fact licence plates indicating the age of a vehicle change on March 1 and Sept. 1.

Demand for diesel cars slumped 21.7 percent and petrol fell 1.2 percent. Sales to fleet business buyers declined 10.1 percent and to consumers fell by 8.8 percent.

Howard Archer, chief economist at consultancy EY ITEM Club, said the decline in fleet demand, which accounts for around half of all car demand, was of particular concern.

"This indicates that businesses have become more reluctant to replace or add to their fleets amid weakened economic activity and a highly uncertain outlook," he said.

Only demand for alternative fuel vehicles, namely electric and hybrid plug-in vehicles, rose, increasing by 41 percent albeit from a very low base.

The depth of the slump in September comes despite almost all major car companies offering thousands of pounds off new models with scrappage schemes, trade-in programmes and discounts.

UK car sales set for first annual decline since 2011 after September slump - Reuters News

{{20171005T081534.659+0000}}UK car sales set for first annual decline since 2011 after September slumpLONDON, Oct 5 (Reuters) - British new car registrations fell 9.3 percent in September, a key month of the year which normally accounts for up to 20 percent of annual demand, making it highly likely that sales this year will be down for the first time since 2011.

Sales totalled cars 426,170 vehicles last month with demand falling across the board, data from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) showed on Thursday.

Demand for diesel cars slumped 21.7 percent and petrol fell 1.2 percent, while sales to fleet business buyers declined 10.1 percent and among consumers fell by 8.8 percent.

September is normally a strong month for car sales, due to the six-monthly change in the licence plate series indicating the age of vehicles, but demand in Europe's second-biggest market has slumped over the last few months.

Sales have fallen year-on-year since April due to a combination of factors including increased vehicle excise duty, possible new levies on diesel cars, weaker consumer confidence partly due to uncertainty around Brexit, and comparisons with record sales in 2015 and 2016.

"September is always a barometer of the health of the UK new car market so this decline will cause considerable concern," said SMMT Chief Executive Mike Hawes.

"Business and political uncertainty is reducing buyer confidence, with consumers and businesses more likely to delay big ticket purchases."

UK new car sales fell 9 percent in key month of September-data - Reuters News

{{20171005T043000.595+0000}}UK new car sales fell 9 percent in key month of September-dataLONDON, Oct 5 (Reuters) - New car registrations in Britain fell by 9.2 percent in September, making it highly likely that sales this year will be down for the first time since 2011, according to preliminary numbers from an industry body.

September is normally a strong month for car sales, due to the six-monthly change in the licence plate series indicating the age of vehicles, but demand in Europe's second-biggest market has slumped over the last few months.

Sales have fallen year-on-year since April due to a combination of factors including increased vehicle excise duty, weaker consumer confidence, partly due to uncertainty around Brexit, and comparisons with record sales in 2015 and 2016.

Diesel car sales have been worst hit as consumers fear new levies and possible restrictions on their use in urban areas as the government continues to consult on ways to reduce pollution.

September's expected drop in sales would add to the fall of 2.4 percent between January and August, according to data from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders.

The slump comes despite almost all major car firms offering thousands of pounds off some new models with scrappage schemes, trade-in programmes and discounts to boost sales last month. [nL8N1LI1EF]

"Consumer and business confidence falls in the wake of economic and political uncertainty, and confusion over air quality plans," the SMMT said.

It is due to publish final numbers at 0800 GMT on Thursday.

UPDATE 3-U.S. Senate panel puts self-driving cars in fast lane - Reuters News

{{20171004T222750.462+0000}}UPDATE 3-U.S. Senate panel puts self-driving cars in fast lane(New throughout, adds Teamsters reaction, GM report)

By David Shepardson

WASHINGTON, Oct 4 (Reuters) - A U.S. Senate panel on Wednesday unanimously gave the green light to a bill aimed at speeding the use of self-driving cars without human controls, a measure that also bars states from imposing regulatory road blocks.

The bill still must clear a Senate vote, but it appears on track to passage. This should rev up profits for automakers, technology companies and ride service providers, hastening the day when their robot cars can carry passengers on the same U.S. roads as cars driven by people.

General Motors Co , Alphabet Inc , Ford Motor Co and others have lobbied for the landmark legislation, while auto safety groups urged more safeguards and have pledged to keep fighting for changes.

However the measure will not speed the process for self-driving commercial trucks, which remain in a slower lane despite support from several Republican senators.

The Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee approved the bill, and the U.S. House of Representatives unanimously passed a similar measure last month. Automakers would be able to win exemptions from safety rules that require human controls. States could set rules on registration, licensing, liability, insurance and safety inspections, but not performance standards.

Senator John Thune, the Republican who chairs the Commerce Committee, said the bill "underscores the bipartisan desire to move ahead with self-driving vehicle technology.... The safety and economic benefits of self-driving vehicles are too critical to delay."

Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat, sought to amend the bill to require human controls in case of emergency, but dropped that proposal. Some senators argued it would be more dangerous to allow human drivers to seek to take over driverless cars.

Even with the legislative victory, developers of self-driving technology face technical challenges. There are also the complications of driverless vehicles sharing the road with human drivers. GM told California its self-driving cars were involved in six crashes in September. The accidents were all minor, and the automaker has blamed them on human drivers and one bicyclist who hit its self-driving vehicles. [nL2N1MF1RO]

Neither the House nor the Senate bill would speed approval of self-driving technology for vehicles over 10,000 pounds, a step pushed by trucking organizations. Labor unions raised safety and employment concerns, and Democrats resisted that part of the proposal.

Teamsters President Jim Hoffa said the "safe development of advanced heavy trucking technology must encapsulate the life-and-death issues that are specific to that industry, not consider such consequences as an inconvenient after-thought." He said Congress should also consider U.S. jobs.

Tesla Inc , Alphabet, Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] and others have said they are working on self-driving trucks.

After lengthy negotiations, congressional aides added language to the bill aimed at preserving legal rights to sue over defective vehicles. This resolved a dispute that threatened to derail the bill.

Within three years, the bill would allow automakers to each sell up to 80,000 self-driving vehicles annually if they could demonstrate they are as safe as current vehicles. Auto safety advocates complained it lacked sufficient safeguards.

The phase-in schedule was revised to initially allow 15,000 per manufacturer in the first year and up to 80,000 after three years, down from 50,000 to start and up to 100,000 in three years. It would eliminate the cap after four years.

The bill grants the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) authority to exempt vehicles from federal safety requirements and the agency would have to make a determination within six months of getting a request.

The Self-Driving Coalition, a group of automakers, tech firms and advocates for the disabled, said the legislation "will help ensure that the United States leads the world in self-driving innovation."

Under the measure, NHTSA must write permanent rules on self-driving cars within a decade and regulators must study how to encourage U.S. production of self-driving equipment and also look at the impact of self-driving vehicles on infrastructure, traffic congestion and fuel consumption.

Companies would need to disclose what information self-driving cars are collecting about individuals and how it is used. Companies would need to disclose if consumers could opt out of data collection.

U.S. Senate panel approves self-driving car legislation - Reuters News

{{20171004T144325.606+0000}}U.S. Senate panel approves self-driving car legislationWASHINGTON, Oct 4 (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate Commerce Committee on Wednesday unanimously approved a bill to speed self-driving cars to market without human controls and bar states from imposing regulatory road blocks.

The bill still must be approved by the full Senate. The U.S. House passed a similar version last month unanimously. General Motors Co , Alphabet Inc , Ford Motor Co and others have lobbied for the landmark legislation. Despite some Republicans complaint, the Senate bill does not include large commercial trucks after labor unions raised safety and employment concerns.

UPDATE 3-Honda to cut Japanese production by a quarter as domestic sales stagnate - Reuters News

{{20171004T134404.000+0000}}UPDATE 3-Honda to cut Japanese production by a quarter as domestic sales stagnate* Honda to stop producing at Sayama plant north of Tokyo

* Japan sales have not increased as expected - CEO

* Says slimmed down operations will allow more focus on EVs

(Adds industry context)

By Naomi Tajitsu

TOKYO, Oct 4 (Reuters) - Honda Motor Co <7267.T> plans to end production at its Sayama plant in Japan by 2022, cutting capacity by around 24 percent in its shrinking domestic market as it shifts focus to electric cars (EVs) and other new technologies.

The automaker has seen stagnant domestic sales and said on Wednesday it was streamlining its Japanese operations as it takes a more nimble approach to development and manufacturing in the face of fierce competition from carmakers and technology companies to make EVs and self-driving cars.

"As we focus more on adopting electrification and other new technologies, we want to hone our vehicle manufacturing expertise in Japan and expand it globally," CEO Takahiro Hachigo told a press conference.

While automobile plant closures are rare in Japan, Honda, like its global rivals, is facing pressure to cut costs in legacy businesses, including countries where sales and profits are weak, in order to fund expansions in China and development of new technology.

Earlier this week, Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T> ended production at its production plant in Australia, while Ford Motor Co said it would cut $14 billion in costs in the next five years. [nL4N1ME3GX]

General Motors Co earlier this year sold its European operations to France's PSA Group while it also plans to exit India and other countries where sales have been struggling.

Hachigo has been trying to revive a culture of innovation at Japan's No. 3 automaker, after a number of major recalls in recent years as well as lacklustre product offerings, partly because it focused so much on increasing volumes and profit. [nL4N1LO36S]

Honda said it would consolidate production at the ageing Sayama plant in Saitama Prefecture north of Tokyo, into its Yorii plant in the same prefecture by the end of the 2022 financial year.

The move would cut overall domestic annual production capacity to around 810,000 units, the same as Honda's current output levels, which are around 76 percent of its current production capacity of 1.06 million vehicles.

"Domestic sales haven't increased as much as we were expecting and it has become difficult to boost exports," Hachigo said.

Following consolidation, Honda said the Yorii plant will produce EVs and serve as a major centre for developing manufacturing technology for electric cars. It will also produce other vehicles including larger-sized global models.

While the automaker cuts capacity at home, it plans to open a new plant by 2019 in China, where it has seen explosive growth. Honda also has been expanding capacity in North America and just recently announced plans to expand output of its Accord sedan at one of its plants in Ohio. [nL2N1LZ0NF]

Overall, global annual production would remain largely unchanged at around 5.06 million units, it said.

Honda has struggled to expand sales at home in the past few years, facing stiff competition from popular offerings including Toyota's Prius gasoline hybrid and Nissan Motor Co.'s <7201.T>, Note compact hatchback.

In the year ended March, it sold 668,000 units domestically, almost the same as in the previous year. Overall, passenger car sales in Japan have been decreasing in past years due to a greying population while interest in car ownership among young people has been falling.

Hachigo also said he was confident Honda was following proper procedures for final vehicle inspection for the Japanese market.

He said the company was complying with a request from Japan's transport ministry for inspection records after Nissan said on Monday it would recall 1.2 million vehicles due to procedural irregularities with its final inspection processes. [nL4N1MF0FF]

BREAKINGVIEWS-Ford's clever electric van plan in China - Reuters Breakingviews

{{20171004T052332.610+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-Ford's clever electric van plan in China(The authors are Reuters Breakingviews columnists. The opinions expressed are their own.) (Refiles to add graphic.)

By Pete Sweeney and Katrina Hamlin

HONG KONG, Oct 4 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Ford's new China plan could start with a big strategic shift, insiders told Reuters: making electric commercial vehicles. New policy restrictions on diesel engines open a window of opportunity to take a crack at a market currently dominated by local players. Electric delivery vans might help Ford meet government quotas, and the platforms could be reused in sports utility vehicles popular among mainland consumers. A lot will depend on Ford's local partner - and a secure battery supply.

Beijing is trying to cut back on grim urban air pollution, reduce oil imports, and incubate local electric vehicle champions. Under official pressure, manufacturers are preparing to crank out EVs. For foreign automakers like Ford, the problem is that their most popular models tend to be large SUVs; they worry they will be forced to produce EVs that nobody buys.

Ford's solution appears to be a sneak attack on an adjacent market: the millions of mid-sized trucks and delivery vans plying Chinese streets, most belching smog. As aggressive as Beijing's targets are for electrifying passenger cars, officials want to replace commercial clunkers even faster, and are rapidly regulating them off the roads.

Mandatory fleet upgrades could help the American giant revive sales in the People's Republic, down 6 percent year-to-date in August. Much of that decline came from a joint venture making ordinary passenger cars, whereas the partnership with Jiangling Motor Corp <000550.SZ> - which builds Ford's Everest SUV, among others - saw sales grow 16 percent. Depending on how regulators interpret new rules, EVs produced by Ford and JMC might count toward Beijing's requirement that 10 percent of annual sales come from "new energy vehicles" by 2019. And a platform that can deliver pallets of fruit juice would probably serve perfectly well as an SUV chassis too.

However, JMC and Ford will have to bring models to market quicker than rivals. Here secure access to battery supply may prove decisive. Some domestic carmakers have already invested in lithium mines and battery factories, worried that there won't be enough to go around. Ford can probably get where it's going, but best keep the pedal to the metal.

CONTEXT NEWS

- Ford Motor plans to slash $14 billion in costs over the next five years, Chief Executive Officer Jim Hackett told investors on Oct. 3, adding that the U.S. automaker would shift capital investment away from sedans and internal combustion engines to develop more trucks and electric and hybrid cars.

- Ford is considering revamping its China strategy and detaching it from the "One Ford" strategy to focus on developing electric commercial vans and trucks, Reuters reported on Oct. 3, quoting two insiders. The new initiative would involve pushing its truck-making partner Jiangling Motors Corp more towards electric vans, the report said.

- Ford's China sales are forecast to decline 4.6 percent this year, by number of vehicles sold, according to LMC Automotive. That is down from double-digit percentage growth five years ago.

- China is introducing quotas to promote so-called "new energy vehicles". Carmakers will need to amass credits for NEVs equivalent to 10 percent of annual sales by 2019, China's industry ministry said on Sept. 28. That level would rise to 12 percent for 2020.

- China's capital Beijing plans to ban diesel trucks burning dirtier classes of diesel from Sept. 21, 2019, state media reported on Sept. 18, citing a government document.

- In August, the Ministry of Environmental Protection ordered certain companies in 28 cities to halve their use of diesel trucks in winter, when pollution is at its worst, Reuters reported. The restrictions follow bans earlier this year on transporting coal by diesel trucks in major port cities.

Australia new vehicle sales dip in Sept, commercial still strong - Reuters News

{{20171004T010000.975+0000}}Australia new vehicle sales dip in Sept, commercial still strongSYDNEY, Oct 4 (Reuters) - Australian new vehicle sales took a dip in September after a run of record months, though continued strength in the commercial sector augured well for business spending in the economy.

The Australian Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries' VFACTS report out on Wednesday showed 100,200 new vehicles were sold in September, down 2.4 percent on the same month last year. Both months had the same number of selling days.

Sales for the year to date were still running 0.2 percent ahead of the same period in 2016.

Sales of passenger cars extended their long decline with a fall of 9.3 percent in September, and even the red-hot sports utilities sector took a breather with a dip of 1.3 percent.

Yet demand for commercial vehicles showed no signs of waning with the light sector up 8.1 percent and heavy vehicles jumping 15.4 percent on September last year.

Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T> retained first place on the sales ladder with a reduced share of 17.3 percent of the market, while Mazda Motor Corp <7261.T> made a strong showing by taking an unusually high 10.3 percent.

Hyundai Motor <005380.KS> held third spot with 8.1 percent, followed by Mitsubishi <7211.T> at 7.1 percent. The Holden unit of General Motors trailed with 6.9 percent, ahead of Ford at 6.8 percent.

UPDATE 4-Ford to cut costs $14 bln, invest in trucks, electric cars -CEO - Reuters News

{{20171003T224845.849+0000}}UPDATE 4-Ford to cut costs $14 bln, invest in trucks, electric cars -CEO(Adds comments on timing of cost savings, Hackett comments on electric car profitability)

By Joseph White and Paul Lienert

DETROIT, Oct 3 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co plans to slash $14 billion in costs over the next five years, Chief Executive Officer Jim Hackett told investors on Tuesday, adding that the No. 2 U.S. automaker would shift capital investment away from sedans and internal combustion engines to develop more trucks and electric and hybrid cars.

Most of those savings will not show up on Ford's bottom line until 2019 and 2020, Hackett and other Ford executives said, reflecting the industry's long product engineering lead times.

Ford will be open to more partnerships to spread the costs and risks of simultaneously developing new technology and services while churning out profit from selling trucks and sport utility vehicles in North America, Hackett said during a nearly two-hour presentation. He cited a partnership with ride services company Lyft to deploy future Ford self-driving cars, an alliance with Indian automaker Mahindra and a potential alliance with Chinese electric vehicle maker Zotye. [nL4N1LZ2UI]

The automaker reaffirmed a goal of achieving 8 percent automotive operating margins and generating returns that exceed the cost of capital. Ford will provide a financial forecast for 2018 in January. Ford Chief Financial Officer Bob Shanks said it could take until 2020 or later to achieve the 8 percent margin goal.

Other automakers have warned that shifting to all-electric vehicles could undercut profit margins. "I don't think we should walk off a ledge where we destroy the earnings power of the company," Hackett said, saying Ford is planning for a third of vehicles to still have internal combustion engines by 2030 - the year some European governments have proposed banning petroleum fueled cars.

Hackett, former CEO of office furniture maker Steelcase Inc , took the top post at Ford in May after his predecessor Mark Fields was pushed out. At the time, Hackett promised to tell investors after 100 days how he would improve the "fitness" of Ford to compete as the auto industry becomes more digital, more electric and less wedded to selling one vehicle at a time to individuals.

Ford shares were little changed after hours as Hackett and other executives presented their outlook. Ford shares had risen 2.1 percent on Tuesday, up with other automotive stocks as the industry reported the highest sales pace in a dozen years. However, the company's share price is down 30 percent since July 2014. [nL2N1ME1KL]

Hackett has signed off on a series of moves, including a plan to shift production of Ford Focus compact cars from Michigan to China. He also hired a company outsider, Jason Luo, to lead Ford's business in China, the world's largest car market, where Ford is revamping operations and looking to expand partnerships in electric vehicles. [nL4N1MD26Z]

Ford is playing catch up in some areas. By 2019, Ford plans to equip all U.S. models with built-in modems and to install mobile internet connections in 90 percent of global vehicles by 2020, Hackett said.

Rival General Motors Co has been installing built-in mobile broadband connections in its U.S. vehicles since 2015 and now has about 7 million 4G LTE connected vehicles on the road globally, a spokesman said on Tuesday.

Of Ford's $14 billion in promised cost reductions over five years, $10 billion will come from material costs and $4 billion from reduced engineering costs, Hackett said.

"We have too much cost across our business," Hackett said.

By 2022, Ford plans to cut spending on future internal combustion engines by a third, or about $500 million, putting that money instead into expanded electric and hybrid vehicle development, on top of $4.5 billion previously announced. Ford had already promised 13 new electric or hybrid vehicles within the next five years.

Ford is "looking to build sustainably profitable BEV (battery electric vehicle) business" in segments where "we have a strong revenue presence," Jim Farley, head of global markets, told investors.

Farley also said Ford is looking "carefully" at marginally profitable or unprofitable operations in Europe and Latin America, and could look to partnerships in those markets.

Electric vehicles will mean auto factories can have a final assembly area that is half the size, requires half the capital investment and 30 percent fewer labor hours per car, said Joe Hinrichs, president of global operations.

GM on Monday said it planned to launch 20 new all-electric vehicles by 2023. [nL2N1MD1YS]

One way to cut costs will be to offer fewer variations of Ford's models, Hackett said. The slow-selling Ford Fusion midsize sedan can now be ordered in 35,000 combinations of features, colors and powertrain options. The future model will come in just 96 combinations, meaning fewer parts to design, produce and store in inventory, Ford showed in a presentation.

He said Ford also will cut the time it takes to engineer a new car by 20 percent, and invest in "factories of the future" that will occupy less space and use more robots.

{{20171003T224043.632+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-Ford CEO bets ambitious retool on big cost cuts(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.)

By Antony Currie

NEW YORK, Oct 3 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Ford's new chief executive is betting his ambitious retool on big cost cuts. Jim Hackett, who jumped into the driver's seat in May, wants to slash $14 billion of fat by 2022 and switch $7 billion of investment to trucks and SUVs from cars. That should boost earnings, helping speed development of electric and autonomous vehicles. The plan will have to fire on all cylinders, though, to catch up with competitors.

The huge changes in costs and capital allocation is a stunning indictment of not just predecessor Mark Fields' three years running America's second-largest automaker but Alan Mulally's reign, too. It implies that neither fully fixed the poor capital and investment decisions that almost sent Ford into bankruptcy in last decade's financial crisis. There are, for example, 35,000 different combinations a customer can choose when ordering a Fusion sedan; Hackett is reducing that to 96. He's also reducing to 12 from 17 the number of different internal combustion engines Ford offers, freeing up an extra $500 million a year for electrification.

Expense savings alone could generate a huge profit boost for a company that has often missed earnings estimates and posted declining pretax margins, allowing GM to take pole position. If the entire $14 billion were, once taxed, to go straight to the bottom line, it would more than double last year's net income. Favoring larger vehicles over cars will boost margins, too.

These steps, if successful, will enable Hackett to develop the car of the future by ramping up spending on things like electric batteries, machine learning, autonomous driving and big data.

Trouble is, he's not providing much more clarity than Fields did with many of his projects. In some respects, that's understandable: it's unclear when these advancements will change the way people drive – and how the industry makes money.

But BMW has been more forthcoming about its progress. And GM is promising to double its electric lineup and hints it may be able to put robotaxis on the road within a couple of years. That raises the bar for rivals, especially for one that has disappointed investors in recent years. If Hackett cannot show he's making headway on new technology or stumbles in his attempts to pare back costs, Ford may have to go back to the drawing board.

{{20171003T214955.668+0000}}UPDATE 2-Canada's September auto sales up 7.7 percent(Adds details from Global Automakers and Ford)

Oct 3 (Reuters) - Canadian auto sales rose 7.7 percent in September, driven by strong demand for trucks, which made up for nearly 70 percent of total sales in the country.

About 186,837 vehicles were sold in the month, bringing the total number of units sold to 1.59 million so far this year, according to a report published by Global Automakers of Canada.

"It was not that many years ago when 1.59 million in sales represented a good year for total annual sales, let alone sales through the end of the third quarter," said David Adams, president of GAC.

General Motors Co said its vehicle sales rose 7 percent to 27,237 vehicles in the month, while Ford reported a 2.4 percent rise to 30,899 units. (http://bit.ly/2khprR7)

However, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles , , maker of Dodge and Chrysler vehicles, reported a 6 percent drop in Canada sales for the month. [nL2N1ME0SD]

US STOCKS-Major indexes hit record highs 2nd day; autos, airlines jump - Reuters News

{{20171003T204004.453+0000}}US STOCKS-Major indexes hit record highs 2nd day; autos, airlines jump* GM, Ford up after strong September auto sales

* Indexes up : Dow 0.4 pct, S&P 0.2 pct, Nasdaq 0.2 pct

(Updates to close)

By Caroline Valetkevitch

NEW YORK, Oct 3 (Reuters) - The three major U.S. stock indexes and the Russell 2000 posted record high closes for the second straight day on Tuesday, helped by gains in airlines and as carmakers rose after strong September vehicle sales.

Major automakers posted higher U.S. new vehicle sales in September as consumers in hurricane-hit parts of the country rushed to replace flood-damaged cars. [nL2N1ME0OD]

General Motors' shares rose 3.1 percent and hit a record intraday high, while Ford's stock was up 2.1 percent.

Airline shares were among the biggest positives in the S&P 500. Delta Air Lines , also the S&P 500's top percentage gainer, jumped 6.6 percent after it reported that its "cargo ton miles" metric rose 9.4 percent in September from a year earlier.

Shares of United Continental gained 6.1 percent while the S&P 1500 airlines index <.SPCOMALI> was up 5.5 percent

The news was the latest evidence of economic growth. The signs, including factory data on Monday, have helped lead the market to recent record highs and boosted shares of economically sensitive companies including in materials and industrials. [nL2N1MD20D]

"We're seeing moves into economically sensitive stocks, which is an indication that investors believe some of the favorable economic data that's coming out," said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama.

At the same time, investors have put aside some of their recent concerns, such as tensions between the United States and North Korea, he said.

The S&P industrials index <.SPLRCI> was up 0.5 percent and among sectors with the biggest gains on Tuesday.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average <.DJI> rose 84.07 points, or 0.37 percent, to close at 22,641.67, the S&P 500 <.SPX> gained 5.46 points, or 0.22 percent, to 2,534.58 and the Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> added 15.00 points, or 0.23 percent, to 6,531.71.

All three hit record closing highs, along with the Russell 2000 small-cap index <.RUT>, which has been lifted recently by optimism about tax law overhaul prospects.

Investors are also looking at upcoming quarterly earnings from major U.S. companies to help justify lofty market valuations.

Third-quarter earnings for S&P 500 companies are expected to have risen 5.5 percent from a year earlier, according to Thomson Reuters research, after rising a stronger-than-expected 12.3 percent in the second quarter.

Lennar Corp's shares jumped 4.8 percent following a higher-than-expected quarterly profit from the No. 2 U.S. homebuilder. [nL4N1ME23C]

Shares of TravelCenters of America rose 8.4 percent after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc acquired a 38.6 percent stake in TravelCenters' competitor, Pilot Flying J. [nL2N1ME0FV]

Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.30-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.20-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

About 5.9 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges. That compares with the 6.3 billion daily average for the past 20 trading days, according to Thomson Reuters data.

UPDATE 4-Hurricane recovery helps boost U.S. September new auto sales - Reuters News

{{20171003T202915.488+0000}}UPDATE 4-Hurricane recovery helps boost U.S. September new auto sales(Adds official industry tally for September, closing stock prices)

By Nick Carey

DETROIT, Oct 3 (Reuters) - Major automakers on Tuesday posted higher U.S. new vehicle sales in September as consumers in hurricane-hit parts of the country replaced flood-damaged cars, extending a rally in their shares that began when Hurricane Harvey hit southeast Texas in late August.

Analysts and industry consultants had predicted hurricanes Harvey and Irma would provide automakers with their first monthly gains in 2017. Sales had been weak after a strong run since 2010 that culminated in record sales of 17.55 million units in 2016. [nL2N1M90YP]

But others warned high inventory levels and record consumer discounts remained a concern moving forward.

The seasonally adjusted annualized rate of U.S. car and light truck sales in September rose to 18.57 million units from 17.72 million units a year earlier, according to Autodata Corp, which tracks industry sales.

While U.S. sales rose beyond the storm zones, according to automakers and dealers, much of the September gains came after Hurricane Harvey hit Texas. Replacing cars during the recovery in southeast Texas and Florida will boost U.S. new and used auto sales through at least November, according to industry consultants.

General Motors Co stock rose more than 3 percent to its highest level since its 2010 post-bankruptcy initial public offering, and Ford Motor Co closed up more than 2 percent at $12.34.

While the hurricane recovery drove sales, "this will be a short-lived party," said Michelle Krebs, executive analyst for online sales site Autotrader.

Up to 500,000 cars were damaged or destroyed during Harvey and another 200,000 cars during Irma, according to industry estimates.

GM's sales jumped nearly 12 percent versus September 2016 as a 43 percent increase in sales of crossovers and a 10 percent rise for pickup trucks offset an 11 percent decline for passenger cars.

The No. 1 U.S. automaker's inventory fell to 76 days' supply last month from 88 days in August, a positive development since analysts have blamed the automaker for much of the industry's oversupply of unsold new vehicles. GM is moving closer to its goal of around 70 days' supply by the end of the year.

The "overall strength of the U.S. economy is the main force driving the market," said GM chief economist Mustafa Mohatarem, with recovery in hurricane-damaged areas "spurring new and used vehicle sales."

GM said new car sales to consumers were up 14 percent in the region that includes Texas.

Industrywide, new car sales in the Houston area, the fourth-most populous U.S. city, soared 109 percent in the three weeks after Hurricane Harvey compared with the three weeks before the storm, according to car shopping website Edmunds.

'STRONG END OF THE MONTH'

Ford sales rose 8.7 percent in September, with those to consumers up 4.4 percent and lower-margin fleet sales up 25.1 percent. F-Series pickup truck sales soared 21.4 percent, benefiting from the popularity of pickups in Texas.

Demand was up around the country and "particularly strong" in Houston, Ford's U.S. sales chief, Mark LaNeve, said on a conference call. Florida was off because of the lingering effects of Irma but "was coming on strong at the end of the month."

Galpin Motors President Beau Boeckmann told Reuters his dealerships experienced solid Labor Day sales "but what was great was that we continued to see momentum throughout the month."

Boeckmann said new Ford sales were up 28 percent in September, while Honda sales rose 20 percent. Galpin, with 11 dealer franchises in Southern California, is Ford's No. 1 U.S. dealer and Honda's No. 2.

Toyota Motor Corp's <7203.T> September sales increased nearly 15 percent, with strong gains for SUVs and trucks. Sales of the revamped 2018 midsize Camry sedan were up 13 percent in its first full month of sales.

Honda Motor Co Ltd's <7267.T> September sales rose almost 7 percent, with its recently revamped midsize Accord sedan up nearly 10 percent.

Toyota and Honda are betting the new sedans win market share as their Detroit rivals shift focus to SUVs, crossovers and pickups. [nL1N1K511L]

Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCA) reported a 10 percent decline in sales, driven by a 41 percent drop in lower-margin fleet sales. The company is cutting back on fleet sales. FCA's sales to consumers rose 0.3 percent.

Nissan Motor Co Ltd's <7201.T> September sales rose 9.5 percent. Judy Wheeler, vice president of U.S. sales, said while Houston area sales were up around 11 percent, results in most of its regions were also higher "so it wasn't just the hurricanes that affected us."

GM and Ford stocks helped boost U.S. indexes to new highs on Tuesday. [.N]

Since Harvey made landfall, GM stock has risen 24 percent, Ford is up 16 percent and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV has rocketed 44 percent.

Auto safety advocates criticize U.S. self-driving car legislation - Reuters News

{{20171003T195511.067+0000}}Auto safety advocates criticize U.S. self-driving car legislationBy David Shepardson

WASHINGTON, Oct 3 (Reuters) - A coalition of auto safety advocates criticized a bill before the U.S. Congress that would allow automakers eventually to sell up to 100,000 self-driving vehicles annually if they could demonstrate they are as safe as current vehicles.

The measure, the first significant federal legislation aimed at speeding self-driving cars to market, would allow automakers to win exemptions from safety standards for self-driving cars without human controls and bar states from imposing performance requirements.

Last week, U.S. Senator John Thune, a Republican who chairs the Commerce Committee, and Senator Gary Peters, a Michigan Democrat, said they had reached a bipartisan deal on the legislation.

The Senate Commerce Committee will vote on the measure on Wednesday, but may also vote on whether to include larger trucks. The U.S. House unanimously passed a similar bill in early September that did not include vehicles above 10,000 pounds (4.5 tonnes).

Current law prohibits vehicles without human controls.

"The public will be the crash-test dummy for this dangerous experiment," former National Highway Traffic Safety Administration chief Joan Claybrook told a conference call with reporters on Tuesday, arguing the auto industry "is essentially trying to deregulate auto safety."

Jason Levine, who heads the Center for Auto Safety, said on the call there was an "absence of corporate caution in the rush to be first to get self-driving cars on the road."

General Motors Co , Alphabet Inc , Ford Motor Co and others have lobbied for the legislation to speed deployment of self-driving cars without human controls.

States could still set rules on registration, licensing, liability, insurance and safety inspections, but not performance standards.

The bill grants the NHTSA authority to exempt vehicles from existing federal safety requirements and the agency would have to make a determination within six months of getting a request.

It is not clear how the agency would make that assessment, given limited current testing on U.S. roads. The fatality rate in 2015 was 1.12 deaths and 78 injuries per 100 million miles traveled.

The bill is backed by groups including the Association of People with Disabilities, that say self-driving vehicles "have the potential to transform how Americans, with and without disabilities, move about their communities."

The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a trade group, said on Tuesday that NHTSA's authority was not affected by the bill. "Given that human error contributes to nine out of 10 crashes, advancing self-driving technologies right now is critical to enhancing future roadway safety," spokesman Wade Newton said.

* Tech stocks extend rally

* Indexes up : Dow 0.27 pct, S&P 0.04 pct, Nasdaq 0.05 pct

(Adds analyst comment, updates prices)

By Ankur Banerjee and Gayathree Ganesan

Oct 3 (Reuters) - All the three main U.S. stock indexes hit fresh record highs on Tuesday, buoyed by a rally in tech stocks and gains in Ford Motor and General Motors after the carmakers reported strong September sales.

Seven of the 11 major S&P indexes were higher, led by technology <.SPLRCT> and consumer discretionary <.SPLRCD> sectors.

Major automakers posted higher U.S. new vehicle sales in September, as consumers in hurricane-hit parts of the country rushed to replace flood-damaged cars. [nL2N1ME0OD]

However, the market traded in a narrow range as investors awaited upcoming quarterly earnings from big names to help justify the lofty valuations.

Third-quarter earnings for S&P 500 companies are expected to increase 5.5 percent from a year earlier, according to Thomson Reuters research, after rising a better-than-expected 12.3 percent in the second quarter.

"Tech has been in leadership for the first nine months of this year," said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities in New York.

The sector is stabilizing as seasonal rotation ends and investors are looking at the stocks as opportunities now, he said.

The markets have been scaling new highs and on Monday found support from factory data that pointed to underlying strength in the U.S. economy. [nL2N1MD20D]

The encouraging data helped world shares touch their latest record highs on Tuesday, while lifting the dollar to its loftiest in 1-1/2 months. [nL8N1ME1FK]

"The first two days of October seem to be a continuation of what happened in the last two weeks of September ... we're gradually grinding higher in the month of October," said Hogan.

At 11:07 a.m. EDT, the Dow Jones Industrial Average <.DJI> was up 61.05 points, or 0.27 percent, at 22,618.65, while the S&P 500 <.SPX> was up 0.97 points, or 0.04 percent, at 2,530.09.

The Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> was up 3.25 points, or 0.05 percent, at 6,519.97.

General Motors' shares rose 3.7 percent to a record high of $43.32 in morning trading, while Ford's stock was up 2.05 percent at $12.34.

But rival Tesla Inc was down 2 percent after the luxury electric vehicle maker said its planned ramp-up for the new Model 3 mass-market sedan faced production bottlenecks. [nL4N1MD4G4]

Lennar Corp's shares rose about 3 percent following a higher-than-expected quarterly profit from the No.2 U.S. homebuilder.

Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,455 to 1,286. On the Nasdaq, 1,368 issues rose and 1,358 fell.

BREAKINGVIEWS-Ford is playing catch-up with General Motors - Reuters Breakingviews

{{20171003T150427.448+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-Ford is playing catch-up with General Motors(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.)

By Antony Currie

NEW YORK, Oct 3 (Reuters Breakingviews) - The race to be the first to deliver mass-produced electric and autonomous vehicles is heating up – and in Detroit, Ford is running a distant second. America's second-biggest automaker is set to unveil its latest strategy after markets close on Tuesday. But General Motors has already outpaced its rival.

At 7.8 times next year's earnings, Ford trades at a premium to GM's 7.1 times, even after its stock tanked by more than a third under former Chief Executive Mark Fields. Skepticism about GM's post-bankruptcy turnaround offset Ford's missed earnings targets, declining profitability and confusion about its plans for a connected, self-driving future.

New boss Jim Hackett's big fix has gotten off to a poor start. On Monday, Ford announced it was setting up a new unit, Team Edison, to "think big," "make quicker decisions" and "think holistically" about electric cars. Within hours, GM bested that, saying it would have 20 electric and hybrid vehicles on the road by 2023.

Ford's rival has also been tuning up expectations about driverless cars. Executives argue it's the only automaker running tests in an urban setting – San Francisco. It may have some robotaxis ready to hit the road before summer 2019, reckons Deutsche Bank. Running a fleet of driverless sedan-size cabs could allow carmakers to bring in multiples of the average revenue of $35,000 a car they currently get.

Ford's relatively stronger position in smaller cars than GM has become a liability as Americans have switched back to SUVs and trucks. Focusing its line-up – and by extension cutting costs – and outlining how it can compete in robotaxis should be high on Hackett's agenda. That ought to include explaining how Ford's transit vans might figure in driverless cities, points out Barclays.

Autonomous and electric vehicles may not hit the roads en masse or be profitable for years. And whatever Hackett cooks up, Ford is unlikely to get near the valuation multiple of Tesla , even after the latter's third-quarter production of its Model 3 came in at less than a fifth of its target.

Nonetheless, the stakes are high. Automakers need to show they know roughly where they're going without squandering capital. GM, with its shares hitting a record high, gets the joke. If Hackett cannot show Ford does, too, its premium to GM is under imminent threat.

CONTEXT NEWS

- Ford Motor will unveil new Chief Executive Jim Hackett's strategy for the automaker after stock markets close on Oct. 3.

- Ford has formed a team to speed up development of electric cars, with a brief to "think big," "make quicker decisions" and "look holistically" at the market, Sherif Marakby, vice president of autonomous vehicles and electrification, said on Oct. 2.

- General Motors the same day outlined plans to put 20 electric-battery and fuel-cell vehicles on the roads by 2023. These would include most if not all of the at least 10 hybrid or electric cars Chief Executive Mary Barra has pledged to introduce to the Chinese market by 2020.

- GM's shares closed at a record high $42.15 on Oct. 2, driven higher by a Deutsche Bank research note saying the automaker plans to have autonomous ride-sharing service in operation by 2020.

- Tesla delivered 26,150 cars in the third quarter, the electric-car maker reported on Oct. 2. Of these, 220 were the new Model 3. A total of 260 Model 3s were built in the quarter, well below the target of 1,500.

REFILE-Automakers' U.S. September sales lifted by hurricanes - Reuters News

{{20171003T144055.920+0000}}REFILE-Automakers' U.S. September sales lifted by hurricanes(Fixes typo in first paragraph)

By Nick Carey

DETROIT, Oct 3 (Reuters) - Major automakers posted higher U.S. new vehicle sales in September, as consumers in hurricane-hit parts of the country, in particular southeast Texas, rushed to replace flood-damaged cars.

Analysts and industry consultants had predicted that hurricanes Harvey and Irma would provide automakers with their first monthly sales gain in 2017. [nL2N1M90YP]

But others warned that high inventory levels and record consumer discounts remained a concern moving forward.

Sales at No. 1 U.S. automaker General Motors Co jumped nearly 12 percent versus September 2016 as a 43 percent increase in sales of crossovers and a 10 percent rise for pickup trucks offset an 11 percent decline for passenger cars.

GM inventory fell to 76 days supply last month from 88 days in August, a positive development since analysts have blamed the automaker for much of the industry's oversupply of unsold new vehicles. GM is moving closer to its goal of around 70 days supply by the end of the year.

The "overall strength of the U.S. economy is the main force driving the market," said GM chief economist Mustafa Mohatarem, with recovery in hurricane-damaged areas "spurring new and used vehicle sales."

New car sales in the Houston area, the fourth most populous in the United States, jumped 109 percent in the three weeks after Hurricane Harvey compared with the three weeks before the storm, according to car shopping website Edmunds.

Some industry consultants have estimated up to 500,000 cars were damaged or destroyed during Harvey.

But Jessica Caldwell, Edmunds executive director of industry analysis, said automakers were struggling to reduce inventories in the rest of the country.

Ford Motor Co's sales rose 8.7 percent in September, with those to consumers up 4.4 percent and lower-margin fleet sales up 25.1 percent. F-Series pickup truck sales soared 21.4 percent.

Toyota Motor Corp's <7203.T> September sales were up nearly 15 percent, with strong gains for SUVs and trucks. Sales of the revamped 2018 Camry sedan were up 13 percent in the vehicle's first full month of sales.

Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCA) reported a 10 percent decline in sales, driven by a 41 percent drop in lower-margin fleet sales. The company is cutting back on fleet sales.

FCA said retail sales to consumers rose 0.3 percent from with September 2016.

Nissan Motor Co Ltd's <7201.T> sales rose 9.5 percent in September.

In early trading, Ford shares were up 2.1 percent to $12.34 and GM was up nearly 3 percent to $43.37.

EXCLUSIVE-One Ford, two systems: U.S. carmaker revamps China strategy amid EV push - Reuters News

* May push e-trucks, e-vans in China using JV - source

(Adds scheduled Ford presentation to analysts in paragraph 9)

By Norihiko Shirouzu and Joseph White

BEIJING/DETROIT, Oct 3 (Reuters) - U.S. automaker Ford Motor Co is overhauling its China plans as its global "One Ford" strategy is holding it back in the world's biggest auto market, two high-ranking company insiders told Reuters.

The review of its China operations, part of a broader strategy re-think under new CEO Jim Hackett, will likely see Ford focus on electric commercial vans, which China is encouraging in its polluted and congested city centres, as well as electric cars.

A shift to e-vans and e-trucks in China would also fit with Ford's reckoning that a best play globally for electrification and autonomous driving might be in commercial and delivery vehicles - a part of the market where it is already strong in the United States and Europe.

The "One Ford" strategy - which helped the automaker's turnaround under former CEO Alan Mulally - doesn't fit all situations, the two insiders said, particularly in China and India, two crucial markets where Ford's sales have slowed.

"That's why nobody internally talks about "One Ford" (in those markets) anymore," said one of the insiders, who are familiar with Ford's Chinese strategy. Neither wanted to be named as they are not authorized to speak with reporters.

In a sign that Ford is turning away from what is essentially a global push of its Ford and Lincoln brands, the Dearborn, Michigan automaker wants to drive its truck-making China partner Jiangling Motors Corp (JMC) <000550.SZ> more towards electric commercial vans.

Such a move is "potentially lucrative" as China's big cities effectively ban gas and diesel trucks and vans, and "none of the foreign automakers has made any major investment or strategic move in this emerging electric commercial vehicle segment," said Yale Zhang, head of Shanghai-based consultancy Automotive Foresight.

Sherif Marakby, Ford's vice president of autonomous vehicles and electrification, told Reuters he couldn't comment on specific partnerships that haven't been announced. "But we are absolutely open to (EV) partnerships in different markets, and we continue to talk to other companies and Tier One suppliers. Don't be surprised to see more partnerships in electric vehicles in different markets," he said.

Hackett was scheduled to give a presentation to analysts in New York later on Tuesday.

In India, Ford and local automaker Mahindra and Mahindra said last month they will launch a strategic alliance in a market shifting to vehicle electrification.

CHINA-SPECIFIC

In August, Ford said it was considering a joint venture with Anhui Zotye Automobile Co <000980.SZ> to build electric vehicles in China under a new brand, tapping Zotye's low-cost electric-vehicle (EV) technology. One of the insiders said Ford was seeking Chinese regulatory approval for this.

It has also brought in Jason Luo, a Chinese-born American, from U.S.-based air bag maker Key Safety Systems to run its China operations. He has been tasked, one of the insiders said, with building closer ties with local partners including JMC and Changan Automobile Co <000625.SZ>, working more effectively with regulators, and responding faster to changing consumer tastes.

"One big issue at Ford China is our decision-making process is too slow," one of the knowledgeable insiders said. "We try to manage everything, all aspects of the business under "One Ford"," and that hobbled the company's ability to move quickly, costing market share.

Ford's China sales are forecast to decline 4.6 percent this year, according to LMC Automotive, a far cry from double-digit growth just five years ago.

SLOW LANE

Ford has no affordable electric plug-in cars for the Chinese market, despite it being little secret that Beijing planned new quotas for all-electric battery cars and heavily electrified plug-in hybrid vehicles. Those quotas were announced late last month. [nL4N1M92KV]

Nor does Ford have a high-volume brand of affordable entry cars for China - such as the Baojun cars sold by rival General Motors Co and its China partner SAIC Motor Corp <600104.SS>. Launched in 2010, Baojun sold more than 2 million vehicles last year.

With JMC, its nearly one-third-owned venture with JMC Group, Ford was slow to expand the light commercial vehicle maker into low-cost entry passenger cars - a market that has now become saturated with Chinese-branded cars and foreign-operated China-only brands like Baojun and Nissan Motor Co's <7201.T> Venucia.

Ford's missteps in China were partly through a rigid adherence to the "One Ford" mantra and a lack of local knowledge, one of the insiders said, noting company executives sent into China often lacked the cultural ties to work with Chinese regulators, policymakers and partners.

Also, China's market, consumer tastes and government policies shift rapidly, the person said.

"Ford is having difficulty keeping up with 'China speed'. Everything here moves so fast."

UPDATE 1-GM promises more electric vehicles, paid for by SUVs - Reuters News

{{20171002T210913.159+0000}}UPDATE 1-GM promises more electric vehicles, paid for by SUVs(Adds GM share price reaching post-IPO high, details on Deutsche Bank comments)

By Joseph White

DETROIT, Oct 2 (Reuters) - Detroit automaker General Motors Co outlined plans on Monday to add 20 new battery electric and fuel cell vehicles to its global lineup by 2023, financed by robust profits from sales of gasoline-fueled trucks and sport utility vehicles in the United States and China.

"General Motors believes in an all-electric future," GM global product development chief Mark Reuss said during a briefing at the company's suburban Detroit technical center.

Future generations of GM electric vehicles "will be profitable," Reuss said, but added it was not clear when GM could make all its new vehicle offerings zero-emission electric cars.

GM shares closed on Monday at $42.15, the highest level since the company's 2010 post-bankruptcy initial public offering.

Investors pushed up GM shares ahead of the electric vehicle announcement on a Deutsche Bank comment that the automaker plans to deploy autonomous vehicles in ride services by 2020.

GM indicated last month it is nearly ready to begin mass production of autonomous Chevrolet Bolt vehicles. [nL2N1MD17E][nL1N1EA21I]

Regulators in China and some European countries have floated proposals to ban internal combustion engines by 2030 or 2040.

"We will continue to make sure our internal combustion engines will get more and more efficient," Reuss said.

Automakers, including electric vehicle market leader Tesla Inc , lose money on electric cars because battery costs are still higher than comparable internal combustion engines.

GM funds its forays into new technology using cash generated by old-technology vehicles popular with its core customer base in the U.S. heartland. In comparison, Tesla has burned through an estimated $10 billion in cash and has yet to show a full-year profit.

GM earned more than 90 percent of its $12.5 billion in pretax profits last year in North America, amid robust demand for its lineup of large sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks. The company's profitable operations in China rely on consumer demand for an expanding lineup of gasoline-powered SUVs.

GM has previously announced plans to make some of its future electric vehicles capable of driving themselves in robot taxi fleets. The company offered sneak peeks of three electric vehicle prototypes: a Buick brand sport utility vehicle, a sporty Cadillac wagon and a futuristic pod car wearing a Bolt badge.

GM collaborated with Korean battery maker LG Chem <051910.KS> to build the Bolt battery system. Company officials did not say what companies would supply batteries for the larger fleet of vehicles promised by 2023.

Fuel cell vehicles will also play a role in GM's future, the company said. GM showed on Monday a prototype of a rolling, hydrogen-fueled platform called SURUS that could be used for multiple purposes.

The company plans to offer a fuel cell vehicle to retail customers within five years, it said. Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T>, Honda Motor Co <7267.T> and Hyundai Motor Co <005380.KS> already are marketing fuel cell vehicles in low volume.

GM Chief Executive Mary Barra said last month the company plans to introduce at least 10 new electric or hybrid vehicles to the Chinese market by 2020, and open a battery plant this year with Chinese partner SAIC Motor Corp Ltd <600104.SS>.

China has set goals for electric and plug-in hybrid cars to make up at least a fifth of auto sales by 2025. Some of the electric vehicles GM will offer in China are among the 20 Reuss promised by 2023.[nL4N1LW25D]

GM also hinted that it may take new steps to expand the public infrastructure for rapid recharging of electric vehicles, without offering any details.

The No. 1 U.S. automaker joins several rivals, including German automakers Daimler AG, Volkswagen AG and BMW AG, that have pledged to accelerate development of electric vehicles.

GM's announcement comes two days before rival Ford Motor Co is scheduled to roll out a new strategic plan, and as Tesla ramps up production of its high-volume Model 3 electric sedan.[nL5N1LT47Z]

All times in ET/GMT) Lennar Corp, the No. 2 U.S. homebuilder, is expected to report an increase in revenue for the third quarter, as demand for housing remains robust. However, quarterly profit is expected to drop. Investors will look for an update on the company's commentary on impacts from the recent hurricanes and financial forecast. In September, Lennar said it expected hundreds of home deliveries in Florida, Georgia and South Carolina to be delayed.

Reports from U.S. auto manufacturers are expected to show the annual motor vehicle sales pace rising to a seasonally adjusted 16.90 million units in September from 16.14 million units in August. Analysts are expecting a bump in sales as car owners replace damaged vehicles in southeast Texas and Florida, which were battered by hurricanes Harvey and Irma. But, questions remain over whether automakers will make sufficient production cuts or lower inventory as sales for the full year are still expected to be below the industry's record-setting year in 2016. (1030/1430)

Ford's new CEO Jim Hackett has scheduled an investor meeting in New York. Hackett had earlier told investors he would outline a new strategy for the automaker after about 100 days in charge. Ford shares are down 11 percent this year amid doubts about the company's strategy to weather a downturn in the U.S. market, and longer-term challenges from Tesla, regulators and Silicon Valley self-driving car ventures.

By Paul Lienert

Oct 2 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co has formed a team to accelerate global development of electric vehicles, whose mission will be to "think big" and "make quicker decisions," an executive of the company said on Monday.

One aim of Ford's "Team Edison" is to identify and develop electric-vehicle partnerships with other companies, including suppliers, in some markets, according to Sherif Marakby, vice president of autonomous vehicles and electrification.

Global demand for electric vehicles has "a significant potential to increase" as governments implement EV mandates and quotas, Marakby said in an interview.

He said the group will be based in the Detroit area and work with regional Ford vehicle electrification teams in China and Europe.

China, India, France and the United Kingdom all have announced plans to phase out vehicles powered by combustion engines and fossil fuels between 2030 and 2040.

Marakby said Team Edison "will look holistically at the electric vehicle market."

"The idea is to think big, move fast and make quicker decisions" on EV production as demand increases and technology advances, he added.

Ford has not altered its previously announced plan to spend $4.5 billion over five years on electrified vehicles, including plug-in hybrids, Marakby said.

He declined to say how many new electric vehicles Ford expects to add in the future.

The new team will report to Ted Cannis, who has been named global director of electrification.

GM promises more electric vehicles, paid for by SUVs - Reuters News

{{20171002T160001.738+0000}}GM promises more electric vehicles, paid for by SUVsBy Joseph White

DETROIT, Oct 2 (Reuters) - Detroit automaker General Motors Co outlined plans on Monday to add 20 new battery electric and fuel cell vehicles to its global product lineup by 2023, financed by robust profits from sales of gasoline-fueled trucks and sport utility vehicles in the United States and China.

"General Motors believes in an all-electric future," GM global product development chief Mark Reuss said on Monday during a briefing at the company's suburban Detroit technical center.

Future generations of GM electric vehicles "will be profitable," Reuss said, but added it was not clear when GM could make all its new vehicle offerings zero-emission electric cars.

Regulators in China and some European countries have floated proposals to ban internal combustion engines by 2030 or 2040.

"We will continue to make sure our internal combustion engines will get more and more efficient," Reuss said.

GM shares were up more than 4 percent in midday New York trading on positive comments from Rod Lache, auto analyst at Deutsche Bank.

Automakers, including electric vehicle market leader Tesla Inc , lose money on electric cars because battery costs are still higher than comparable internal combustion engines.

GM funds its forays into new technology using a river of cash generated by old-technology vehicles popular with its core customer base in the United States heartland. In comparison, Tesla has burned through an estimated $10 billion in cash and has yet to show a full year profit.

GM earned more than 90 percent of its $12.5 billion in pretax profits last year in North America, amid robust demand for its lineup of large sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks. The company's profitable operations in China rely on consumer demand for an expanding lineup of gasoline powered SUVs.

GM has previously announced plans to make some of its future electric vehicles capable of driving themselves in robot taxi fleets. The company offered sneak peeks of three electric vehicle prototypes: a Buick brand sport utility vehicle, a sporty Cadillac wagon and a futuristic pod car wearing a Bolt badge.

GM collaborated with Korean battery maker LG Chem <051910.KS> to build the Bolt battery system. Company officials did not say what companies would supply batteries for the larger fleet of vehicles promised by 2023.

Fuel cell vehicles will also play a role in GM's future, the company said. GM showed on Monday a prototype of a rolling, hydrogen fueled platform called "SURUS" that could be used for multiple purposes.

The company plans to offer a fuel cell vehicle to retail customers within five years, it said. Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T>, Honda Motor Co <7267.T> and Hyundai Motor Co <005380.KS> already are marketing fuel cell vehicles in low volume.

GM Chief Executive Mary Barra said last month the company plans to introduce at least 10 new electric or hybrid vehicles to the Chinese market by 2020, and open a battery plant this year with Chinese partner SAIC Motor Corp Ltd 600104.SS.

China has set goals for electric and plug-in hybrid cars to make up at least a fifth of auto sales by 2025. Some of the electric vehicles GM will offer in China are among the 20 Reuss promised by 2023.[nL4N1LW25D]

GM also hinted that it may take new steps to expand the public infrastructure for rapid recharging of electric vehicles, without offering any details.

The No. 1 U.S. automaker joins several rivals, including German automakers Daimler AG, Volkswagen AG and BMW AG, that have pledged to accelerate development of electric vehicles, in response to proposals in China and several European countries to ban internal combustion engines by 2030 or 2040.

GM's announcement comes just two days before rival Ford Motor Co is scheduled to roll out a new strategic plan, and as Tesla Inc ramps up production of its high-volume Model 3 electric sedan.[nL5N1LT47Z]
