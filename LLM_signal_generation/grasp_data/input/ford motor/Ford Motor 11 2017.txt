{{20171129T224312.203+0000}}Fitch sees U.S. auto sales for 2018 at 16.8 mln unitsBy Nick Carey

DETROIT, Nov 29 (Reuters) - Fitch Ratings said it expects U.S. new vehicle sales to drop slightly in 2018, which "could weigh a bit" on General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co because of the importance of their home market on their overall earnings performance.

Fitch expects auto sales to hit 16.8 million units in 2018. Auto consultancy LMC recently raised its 2017 full-year forecast to 17.2 million units from 17.1 million units.

"Although Fitch's outlook for the U.S. auto sector is stable, downside risks are increasing," senior director Stephen Brown wrote in a note.

Despite the risk for GM and Ford, Brown wrote both automakers should "perform solidly" in 2018.

Near term, Brown wrote that geopolitical risks such as the ongoing renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) "that could negatively impact the sector are rising."

Longer term, new technologies such as electric vehicles and self-driving cars could create new competitors that may "upend the industry's status quo," he added.

U.S. new auto sales rose from the end of the Great Recession through to 2016 when they hit an annual record of 17.55 million units.

But a saturated market, thanks partly to a glut of nearly new used vehicles, has forced automakers to hike discounts to entice consumers to buy this year and full-year 2017 total sales are expected to decline slightly to a little over 17 million units versus 2016.

LMC expects car sales to dip slightly to 17 million units in 2018 and 16.8 million units in 2019.

Automakers pledge ethical minerals sourcing for electric cars - Reuters News

{{20171129T130010.520+0000}}Automakers pledge ethical minerals sourcing for electric carsBERLIN, Nov 29 (Reuters) - Leading carmakers including Volkswagen and Toyota <7203.T> pledged on Wednesday to uphold ethical and socially responsible standards in their purchases of minerals for an expected boom in electric vehicle production.

Demand for minerals such as cobalt, graphite and lithium is forecast to soar in the coming years as governments crack down on vehicle pollution and carmakers step up their investments in electric models.

To cover its plans for more than 80 new models by 2025, Volkswagen (VW) alone is looking for partners in China, Europe and North America to provide battery cells and related technology worth more than 50 billion euros ($59 billion). [nL5N1LS53O]

Talks with major cobalt producers, including Glencore , at VW's Wolfsburg headquarters last week ended without a deal. [nL8N1NY2K1]

More than half of the world's cobalt comes from the Democratic Republic of Congo, a country racked by political instability and legal opacity, and where child labour is used in mines.

On Wednesday, a group of 10 leading passenger-car and truck manufacturers announced an initiative to jointly identify and address ethical, environmental, human and labour rights issues in raw materials sourcing.

The partnership dubbed "Drive Sustainability" consists of VW, Toyota Motor Europe, Ford , Daimler , BMW , Honda <7267.T>, Jaguar Land Rover , Volvo Cars <0175.HK> and truckmakers Scania and Volvo .

The alliance "will assess the risks posed by the top raw materials (such as mica, cobalt, rubber and leather) in the automotive sector," said Stefan Crets of the CSR Europe business network.

"This will allow Drive Sustainability to identify the most impactful activities to pursue" to address issues within the supply chain.

UPDATE 1-WPP in talks with client Ford over future advertising work - Reuters News

{{20171128T191914.707+0000}}UPDATE 1-WPP in talks with client Ford over future advertising work(Adds Ford statement)

LONDON, Nov 28 (Reuters) - WPP said on Tuesday it was in talks with Ford Motor Company , a major client, about their future partnership after the carmaker said it was considering its internal and external advertising model.

Britain's WPP, led by the high profile businessman Martin Sorrell, said in a statement it had been verbally informed that Ford was considering its future ad model and "want to enter into a further agreement with WPP for a period to be agreed in 2018".

Ford said in a statement it valued the creative men and women at WPP.

"They are trusted partners and curators of the Ford brand," it said. "As we are across the Ford business, we are exploring options to improve the fitness of our marketing and advertising operations. No decisions have been made."

WPP has been hit this year by a slowdown in spending from some clients and a new wave of competition that has forced the big ad groups to turn more aggressive when bidding for new contracts.

WPP, which includes such names as Vodafone, Chanel, Unilever and BP on its client roster, said it was in discussion with Ford on the next steps.

Shares in WPP had rallied on the news and closed up 2.6 percent.

RPT-UPDATE 2-U.S. vice president meets with U.S. automakers on NAFTA - Reuters News

{{20171127T223635.772+0000}}RPT-UPDATE 2-U.S. vice president meets with U.S. automakers on NAFTA(Repeats to widen distribution without changes to headline or text)

By Ginger Gibson

WASHINGTON, Nov 27 (Reuters) - U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and the administration's top trade official met with the chief executives of General Motors and Fiat Chrysler , and a senior manager from Ford , on Monday to discuss trade and the renegotiation of NAFTA.

The meeting was held to cover "trade, commerce and manufacturing policy and how it impacts their business" and was scheduled to include National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, Pence's office said.

Automakers have found themselves at the center of disputes over renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) between the United States, Canada and Mexico as the administration of President Donald Trump pushes for more rules on auto imports that the American manufacturers have opposed.

Automakers have been lobbying the administration to abandon proposals that would require more parts for automobiles be made in one of the three countries so as to avoid hefty tariffs.

"We view the modernization of NAFTA as an important opportunity to update the 23-year-old agreement and set the stage for an expansion of U.S. auto exports," Matt Blunt, the president of the American Automotive Policy Council, said after the meeting.

Blunt said that the automakers appreciated "the opportunity to directly address the industry's concerns with the administration's rule of origin proposal."

General Motors chief executive Mary Barra and Fiat Chrysler chief executive Sergio Marchionne were expected to attend the meeting, while Ford's Americas President Joe Hinrichs was set to attend.

Lighthizer is overseeing the renegotiation of NAFTA on behalf of the Trump administration. The latest round of negotiations ended last week with little progress. [nL3N1NR4K2]

Mexico and Canada rejected the U.S. proposal to raise the minimum threshold for autos to 85 percent North American content from 62.5 percent as well as to require half of vehicle content to be from the United States.

Shell and carmakers aim to go the distance with highway charging - Reuters News

{{20171127T000101.344+0000}}Shell and carmakers aim to go the distance with highway charging* Companies sign deal to deploy ultra-fast charging points

* Charging will take as little as five minutes for some cars

* Says IONITY chargers will extend range of electric vehicles

By Ron Bousso

LONDON, Nov 27 (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell has partnered with top carmakers to deploy ultra-fast chargers on Europe's highways, stealing a march on rivals in the race to remove one of the biggest obstacles facing the electric car sector.

Shell's agreement with IONITY - a joint venture between BMW , Daimler , Ford and Volkswagen - will initially bring high-powered docks to 80 highway sites in 2019, it said in a statement.

Power giants including France's Engie and Germany's E.ON , as well as niche players such as U.S. start-up ChargePoint, are all building vehicle-charging networks in Europe, but Shell says the IONITY technology is key to addressing the problem of journey distances. [nL8N1LF39T]

While electric vehicles still account for only a small fraction of the global car market, the pace of growth and a sustained period of low crude prices is prompting oil companies to reassess century-old business models as the world move towards cleaner modes of transportation.

Under Shell's most aggressive projections the company expects the global electric vehicle fleet to grow from about 1 percent of the entire auto fleet today to 10 percent by 2025, displacing oil demand equating to about 800,000 barrels per day.

Rival BP said in August that it was talking to electric car manufacturers on deals to offer battery recharging docks at its stations. [nL5N1KN3Z4]

RANGE BOOST

The number of electric vehicle charging points in Europe nearly tripled from 2014 to 2017 to reach almost 120,000, according to the European Alternative Fuels Observatory.

However, manufacturers have struggled to offer solutions for getting drivers to go beyond short journeys, mostly within cities, because of battery limitations, a lack of charging stations and long charging times.

With the IONITY technology, cars with advanced charging capacity of up to 350 kilowatts will take as little as five to eight minutes to charge, Shell said. It can take several hours to charge a regular electric car today.

"Customers want to go on long journeys in their electric vehicles and feel confident that there are reliable, comfortable and convenient places to charge them quickly," said Shell's head of retail Istvan Kapitany.

The 80 charging stations will be deployed in Belgium, Britain, France, the Netherlands, Austria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia.

With an additional 20 stations expected to be added in Germany, about a quarter of Shell's stations along highways in Europe will offer high-power electric charging within two years, Kapitany told Reuters.

Shell will invest in changing power supplies to its stations to meet growing demand, he said, declining to disclose the size of the investment or terms of the IONITY deal.

The IONITY partners joined forces with a plan to build a pan-European network of 400 charging stations by 2020. [nL8N1N91RV]

The initiative is latest in a number of small Shell investments in charging technology in recent months, including the acquisition of Dutch-based NewMotion, owner of one of Europe's largest charging networks. [nL8N1MN41Y]

UPDATE 2-Britain to hike levy on diesel cars - Reuters News

{{20171123T112202.057+0000}}UPDATE 2-Britain to hike levy on diesel cars(Adds car industry body response)

LONDON, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Britain will increase the tax paid by those driving new diesel cars that do not meet the latest emissions standards from next year, in the latest blow to the hard-pressed sector.

Sales of diesel cars have fallen 15 percent so far this year in Europe's second-biggest autos market, whilst demand for petrol has increased 3 percent, as buyers shun diesel models fearful of more levies and regulatory crackdowns.

Since the 2015 Volkswagen emissions cheating scandal, a number of major cities including Madrid, Paris and Athens have announced plans particularly focused on cutting diesel emissions including bans, fines and restrictions.

On Wednesday, Britain said it would hike Vehicle Excise Duty (VED) for those registering a new diesel car for the first time from April next year which do not meet more stringent pollution requirements, likely to affect most new buyers.

"The tax system can play an important role in protecting our environment," Finance Minister Philip Hammond told parliament in his annual budget statement.

"We owe it to our children that the air they breathe is clean."

The change will add 20 pounds ($27) to the cost of VED for smaller models which fail to meet more stringent standards whilst those driving some larger vehicles could pay hundreds of pounds more.

The extra cost will not apply to next-generation clean diesels which are certified as meeting emissions limits in real driving conditions, the government said.

But a car industry body said it would take time to bring forward the latest technology and the measure would do nothing to decrease the number of older, more polluting vehicles on Britain's roads.

"It's unrealistic to think that we can fast-track the introduction of the next generation of clean diesel technology which takes years to develop, in just four months," said Mike Hawes, the chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders.

"This budget will also do nothing to remove the oldest, most polluting vehicles from our roads in the coming years."

Hammond said the money raised from the additional tax would fund a 220-million pound Clean Air Fund to support local plans to improve air quality.

The change will add 20 pounds ($27) to the cost of VED for smaller models which fail to meet more stringent standards whilst those driving some larger vehicles could pay hundreds of pounds more.

The extra cost will not apply to next-generation clean diesels which are certified as meeting emissions limits in real driving conditions, the government said.

But a car industry body said it would take time to bring forward the latest technology and the measure would do nothing to decrease the number of older, more polluting vehicles on Britain's roads.

"It's unrealistic to think that we can fast-track the introduction of the next generation of clean diesel technology which takes years to develop, in just four months," said Mike Hawes, the chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders.

"This budget will also do nothing to remove the oldest, most polluting vehicles from our roads in the coming years."

Hammond said the money raised from the additional tax would fund a 220-million pound Clean Air Fund to support local plans to improve air quality.

Britain to hike levy on most polluting diesel cars  - Reuters News

{{20171122T132104.675+0000}}Britain to hike levy on most polluting diesel cars LONDON, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Britain will increase the amount of taxation paid by those driving diesel cars that do not meet more stringent emissions standards, finance minister Philip Hammond said on Wednesday.

Vehicle Excise Duty (VED) is paid by British drivers with one rate applying in the first year dependent on emissions levels and a flat rate taking effect from the second year onwards.

"From April 2018, the first-year VED rate for diesel cars that don't meet the latest standards will go up by one band," Hammond said on Wednesday in his annual budget statement.

He said the money would fund a 220-million pound Clean Air Fund to support local plans to improve air quality.

UPDATE 3-Canada, Mexico to rebuff U.S. over NAFTA goals as talks bog down - Reuters News

{{20171121T004424.860+0000}}UPDATE 3-Canada, Mexico to rebuff U.S. over NAFTA goals as talks bog down(Adds comments by Canadian official, Mexican presidential candidate's campaign, Ontario farm minister)

By Sharay Angulo and Ana Isabel Martinez

MEXICO CITY, Nov 20 (Reuters) - Canada and Mexico will rebuff the United States over its demand for tougher NAFTA automotive content rules, top officials said on Monday as negotiations to renew the treaty bogged down with only a few months to go.

U.S. President Donald Trump is threatening to quit NAFTA, which has reshaped the continent's auto sector over the past 23 years, unless major changes can be made to return manufacturing jobs to the United States.

Canadian and Mexican negotiators will address the U.S. auto demands on Tuesday, the final day of the fifth round of talks to update the North American Free Trade Agreement, chief Mexican negotiator Ken Smith told reporters.

Although the talks are due to wrap up in March 2018 after a seventh and final round, they are deadlocked over a series of hard-line proposals the United States unveiled at the fourth round last month.

"It's definitely slowed down from the previous round," said a Canadian source with direct knowledge of the talks. "There has been no progress in the contentious chapters."

Canadian and Mexican officials have complained repeatedly about what they see as U.S. inflexibility. A spokeswoman for the U.S. Trade Representative declined to comment.

Negotiators say they need to finish their work before campaigning for Mexico's presidential election formally begins at the end of March.

The campaign team for the leftist former mayor of Mexico City and early front-runner, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, on Monday repeated calls for the NAFTA talks to be postponed until after the July presidential vote. [nL1N1NQ1Y4]

The Canadian source said the sixth round would be held in Montreal at the end of January 2018.

Mexico and Canada fear Trump will follow through on a promise to pull out of NAFTA, causing disruption and economic damage. The Canadian dollar edged lower against its U.S. counterpart on Monday, in part because of concerns about the negotiations. [nL1N1NQ0O2]

Alarmed U.S. politicians and industry groups have started to put concerted pressure on the White House not to take drastic moves they say would cause job losses.

"Support for NAFTA from the American private sector, and also members of Congress, and even Republican governors, is starting to get very vocal, which we view very positively," said Moises Kalach, head of the international negotiating arm of Mexico's CCE business lobby.

Jeff Leal, farm minister for the powerful Canadian province of Ontario, said in an interview he believed the increasingly vocal U.S. protests would help those who wanted to keep NAFTA.

FRICTION OVER AUTO CONTENT STANDARDS

Canada and Mexico are particularly unhappy about the U.S. push for tougher autos content. Vehicles and auto parts account for most of the $64 billion U.S. trade deficit with Mexico, a sore spot for Trump.

The Trump administration wants half of the content of all North American-built autos be produced in the United States and that the regional vehicle content requirement be increased to 85 percent from 62.5 percent.

Canada and Mexico dismiss the idea as unworkable and plan to respond with presentations on how such a move would damage the North American auto industry, people briefed on the talks said.

A Mexican auto industry representative with knowledge of the talks called the U.S. proposal "insane" on Sunday.

"There is no product made in North America that meets this rule of origin requirement," said Matt Blunt, president of the American Automotive Policy Council, which represents Ford Motor Co , General Motors Co and Fiat Chrysler .

In San Antonio, Texas, a senior U.S. official told a Senate panel that the administration wanted to rebalance the large automotive trade deficit with Mexico.

India-based automaker Mahindra wants to sell electric vehicles in U.S. - Reuters News

{{20171120T220802.625+0000}}India-based automaker Mahindra wants to sell electric vehicles in U.S.By Paul Lienert

DETROIT, Nov 20 (Reuters) - Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd , one of India's oldest vehicle manufacturers, is testing autonomous tractors, trucks and cars, while moving closer to bringing electric vehicles to the United States, Chairman Anand Mahindra said on Monday.

The company, which opened a new North American headquarters north of Detroit on Monday, is considering when to begin U.S. sales of the vehicles, Anand Mahindra said in an interview.

It is also weighing whether the vehicles should carry the Mahindra brand or those of its affiliates Pininfarina, the famed Italian design house; and Ssangyong Motor Co <003620.KS>, a Korean manufacturer of utility and crossover vehicles, he added.

Mahindra & Mahindra bought Ssangyong in 2011 and Pininfarina in 2015. The Indian parent is collaborating with both companies on the development of electric vehicles, including premium models for Pininfarina that likely would compete with Tesla Inc . Anand Mahindra suggested that Ssangyong and Pininfarina electric vehicles might be sold in both the United States and China.

Earlier this year, Autocar India reported that Pininfarina was developing a family of electric vehicles for China's Hybrid Kinetic Group, as well as its own electric supercar. The magazine also reported that Ssangyong planned to launch an all-electric crossover vehicle in Korea in 2019.

In early November, Ssangyong said it had received approval to begin testing of autonomous vehicles in Korea, but did not say when it planned to produce them.

Anand Mahindra said his company, one of the world's largest tractor manufacturers, had been testing self-driving models since it bought a minority stake in Japan's Mitsubishi Agriculture Machinery in 2015. Mahindra & Mahindra operates several U.S. tractor assembly plants.

While work on the self-driving vehicles is still in the early stages, Mahindra & Mahindra has been building electric vehicles in India since the mid-1990s, when it developed a small fleet battery-powered, three-wheeled rickshaws for use in Delhi, the chairman said.

Mahindra & Mahindra bought Reva Electric Car Co, a small Bangalore-based manufacturer, in 2010 and transformed it into Mahindra Electric Mobility Ltd, which designs and builds compact electric vehicles for the Indian market.

In mid-September, the company renewed ties with Ford Motor Co through a new alliance that envisions sharing of technology, product development and parts sourcing, especially on electric vehicles.

The companies had a short-lived joint venture, Mahindra Ford India Ltd, established in 1995. Ford took control of the venture in 1998 and renamed it Ford India.

BREAKINGVIEWS-Uber-Volvo deal scrapes self-driving surface - Reuters Breakingviews

{{20171120T175644.500+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-Uber-Volvo deal scrapes self-driving surface(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.)

By Antony Currie

NEW YORK, Nov 20 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Volvo's deal to provide 24,000 vehicles to Uber [UBER.UL] just scrapes the surface of what can be made from self-driving cars. The deal, if fully consummated, could pump some $1 billion into the Chinese-owned, Sweden-based automaker's tanks, according to the Wall Street Journal – just shy of the current retail price of the XC90 SUVs heading Uber's way. That's a decent chunk – but hawking other services ought to account for multiples of a vehicle's sale price in the car industry of the future.

Autonomous cars have the potential to radically change the business model. At present, the likes of Volvo, General Motors and Ford only make money when they sell cars. Fold in some financing fees and the average revenue per new vehicle is around $35,000 in the United States – and the average customer only buys one every few years. Compare that with operating a fleet of robo-taxis, which bring in a revenue stream spread over several years.

It's not the only way to fuel up profit from self-driving vehicles, though. Passengers may want to hook up to the internet, watch TV or movies. Data from such activities, as well as from where customers go and how the car operates, could have financial value. Bundle it all up, and the potential lifetime revenue of a driverless car could be $500,000, one auto industry director told Breakingviews – roughly 11 times what Uber may be paying for the vehicles themselves.

What remains unclear is how that gets divvied up. Neither Volvo nor Uber has a big presence in connectivity and content, so keeping passengers entertained would call for partnerships, or diversification. Uber's autonomous Volvos currently used in a pilot scheme still need a backup driver, increasing costs. And competitors are alert to the opportunity. GM, for example, may have its own fleet of robo-taxis up and running in San Francisco in a couple of years. Volvo's new deal is a significant moment – but it will soon look like a mere drop in the tank.

UPDATE 1-Volvo Cars to supply Uber with up to 24,000 self-driving cars - Reuters News

{{20171120T173804.116+0000}}UPDATE 1-Volvo Cars to supply Uber with up to 24,000 self-driving cars(Adds Breakingviews link)

By Niklas Pollard and Heather Somerville

STOCKHOLM/SAN FRANCISCO, Nov 20 (Reuters) - Uber plans to buy up to 24,000 self-driving cars from Volvo, marking the transition of the U.S. firm from an app used to summon a taxi to the owner and operator of a fleet of cars.

The non-binding framework deal could offer San Francisco-based Uber a way to overcome setbacks at its autonomous driving division in Silicon Valley's race to perfect self-driving systems.

Combining Volvo's cars with Uber's self-driving system builds on their nearly three-year relationship and comes as Uber's autonomous driving unit has been hit by a lawsuit over trade secrets and the departure of top talent.

Automakers, ride-hailing firms and tech startups have been forging loose alliances in an effort to advance self-driving technology and claim a piece of what is expected to be a multi-billion-dollar business.

Geely-owned Volvo said in a statement on Monday it would provide Uber with its flagship XC90 SUVs equipped with autonomous technology as part of a non-exclusive deal from 2019 to 2021. A Volvo spokesman said it covered up to 24,000 cars.

The self-driving system that would be used in the Volvo cars - which have yet to be built - is under development by Uber's Advanced Technologies Group.

Should Uber buy all 24,000 cars, it would be Volvo's largest order by far and the biggest sale in the autonomous vehicle industry, giving Uber, which is losing more than $600 million a quarter, its first commercial fleet of cars.

A new Volvo XC90 typically retails from a starting price of around $50,000.

Uber has been testing prototype Volvo cars for more than a year, with safety drivers in the front seat to intervene if the self-driving system fails, in Tempe, Arizona and Pittsburgh. "Our goal was from day one to make investments into a vehicle that could be manufactured at scale," Jeff Miller, Uber's head of automotive alliances, said.

The cars, in theory, would be available through the Uber app to pick up passengers without a driver.

"It only becomes a commercial business when you can remove that vehicle operator from the equation," Miller said.

No financial details were disclosed for the purchase, which would be a massive new investment for Uber and mark a change from Uber's long-standing business model where contractor drivers buy or lease and maintain their own cars.[NL2N1L91P3]

Miller said a small number of cars would be purchased using equity and others would be bought using debt financing.

The deal builds on a $300 million alliance Volvo announced with Uber last year focused on collaborating on the design and financing of cars with self-driving systems, which require different steering and braking features and sensors.[nL8N1AZ2V2]

"We get support developing this car," Volvo Cars Chief Executive Hakan Samuelsson said in an interview. "It's also a big commercial deal."

LYFT RIVALRY

Volvo, which has been under Chinese ownership since it was bought by Zhejiang Geely Holding Group from Ford in 2010, plans to make the SUVs at its Torslanda plant in western Sweden, and Samuelsson said they would be sold at roughly the same profit margin as Volvo sells through dealers.

Uber's rival Lyft has this year struck a research partnership with Alphabet Inc's unit Waymo and secured deals with Ford Motor Co and startups Nutonomy and Drive.ai to incorporate self-driving cars into its fleet. [NL2N1LN2G6] [nL2N1M80X2]

Volvo's agreement with Uber and Ford's with Lyft show the pressure on automakers to avoid becoming obsolete in a world of increased automation, and on ride-services companies to start automating to cut driver costs and turn profits.

Volvo is one of Sweden's biggest manufacturers by revenue, and has forecast a fourth straight year of record sales in 2017.

RPT-Canada, Mexico to question U.S. auto content demands at NAFTA talks - Reuters News

{{20171120T120001.187+0000}}RPT-Canada, Mexico to question U.S. auto content demands at NAFTA talks(Repeats with no changes)

By David Lawder and Sharay Angulo

MEXICO CITY, Nov 20 (Reuters) - Canada and Mexico will not make counterproposals to U.S. demands for tougher NAFTA automotive content rules but instead will offer rebuttals and pepper American negotiators with technical questions on Monday, people familiar with the talks said.

Canada will make a presentation arguing U.S. demands would cause serious damage to U.S. as well as North American automotive manufacturing, a Canadian source with knowledge of the negotiations said.

The rebuttal is expected to come on Monday as negotiators resume discussions on automotive rules of origin in the fifth round of talks to update the 23-year-old North American Free Trade Agreement between the United States, Canada and Mexico.

The Trump administration last month stunned its NAFTA partners by unveiling demands that half of the value content of all North American-built autos be produced in the United States and that the regional vehicle content requirement be sharply increased to 85 percent from the current 62.5 percent.

The demands are aimed at meeting U.S. President Donald Trump's NAFTA goals of stemming the flow of U.S. carmaking jobs to low-wage Mexico and reversing a $64 billion U.S. trade deficit with its southern neighbor.

"In terms of the automotive sector, the United States´ proposal is insane," said a Mexican auto industry representative with knowledge of the talks. "You cannot counter-propose such madness."

The Canadian negotiating team's presentation will "provide information about how the U.S. rules of origin proposal for autos would damage the continental industry in general and the United States in particular," the Canadian source said.

"If you move the content requirement to 80 percent, or even to a number lower than that, it will hit the supply chains. You would then have to deal with potentially ill-equipped suppliers that are maybe more expensive," the source added.

A spokeswoman for the U.S. Trade Representative's office on Sunday declined to comment on the talks.

Flavio Volpe, president of Canada's Automotive Parts Manufacturers Association, also said Canada and Mexico would try to convince U.S. officials that the proposals would damage North American competitiveness and lead to fewer auto assembly and parts jobs on the continent.

Volpe told Reuters that his group has been briefing Canadian negotiators on the effects of the U.S. proposals. Its analysis found that even if some assembly operations are returned to the United States, these job gains will be more than offset by parts production moving to Asia and other low-cost production areas.

Many car manufacturers and parts makers will simply forego NAFTA free-trade benefits and pay the 2.5 percent U.S. tariff on many components, he added.

His U.S. counterpart, the Motor and Equipment Manufacturers Association, last month unveiled a study showing that the United States would lose up to 24,000 auto parts manufacturing jobs from higher NAFTA content requirements and up to 50,000 if NAFTA is terminated. [nL2N1MN0G4]

The Mexican auto industry representative said the country's negotiators would likely ask more technical questions about the U.S. automotive content demands during discussions on Monday and Tuesday. The industry would not back down from its opposition to the U.S. proposal, he added.

Another source close to the negotiations said Mexico and Canada consider the U.S. proposal "unviable" and disagree with the concept.

"So we are not in a situation of being able to go over numbers. It is not about analyzing the figures that they put on the table and us returning with other figures," the source said.

{{20171120T060001.734+0000}}Canada, Mexico to question U.S. auto content demands at NAFTA talksBy David Lawder and Sharay Angulo

MEXICO CITY, Nov 20 (Reuters) - Canada and Mexico will not make counterproposals to U.S. demands for tougher NAFTA automotive content rules but instead will offer rebuttals and pepper American negotiators with technical questions on Monday, people familiar with the talks said.

Canada will make a presentation arguing U.S. demands would cause serious damage to U.S. as well as North American automotive manufacturing, a Canadian source with knowledge of the negotiations said.

The rebuttal is expected to come on Monday as negotiators resume discussions on automotive rules of origin in the fifth round of talks to update the 23-year-old North American Free Trade Agreement between the United States, Canada and Mexico.

The Trump administration last month stunned its NAFTA partners by unveiling demands that half of the value content of all North American-built autos be produced in the United States and that the regional vehicle content requirement be sharply increased to 85 percent from the current 62.5 percent.

The demands are aimed at meeting U.S. President Donald Trump's NAFTA goals of stemming the flow of U.S. carmaking jobs to low-wage Mexico and reversing a $64 billion U.S. trade deficit with its southern neighbor.

"In terms of the automotive sector, the United States´ proposal is insane," said a Mexican auto industry representative with knowledge of the talks. "You cannot counter-propose such madness."

The Canadian negotiating team's presentation will "provide information about how the U.S. rules of origin proposal for autos would damage the continental industry in general and the United States in particular," the Canadian source said.

"If you move the content requirement to 80 percent, or even to a number lower than that, it will hit the supply chains. You would then have to deal with potentially ill-equipped suppliers that are maybe more expensive," the source added.

A spokeswoman for the U.S. Trade Representative's office on Sunday declined to comment on the talks.

Flavio Volpe, president of Canada's Automotive Parts Manufacturers Association, also said Canada and Mexico would try to convince U.S. officials that the proposals would damage North American competitiveness and lead to fewer auto assembly and parts jobs on the continent.

Volpe told Reuters that his group has been briefing Canadian negotiators on the effects of the U.S. proposals. Its analysis found that even if some assembly operations are returned to the United States, these job gains will be more than offset by parts production moving to Asia and other low-cost production areas.

Many car manufacturers and parts makers will simply forego NAFTA free-trade benefits and pay the 2.5 percent U.S. tariff on many components, he added.

His U.S. counterpart, the Motor and Equipment Manufacturers Association, last month unveiled a study showing that the United States would lose up to 24,000 auto parts manufacturing jobs from higher NAFTA content requirements and up to 50,000 if NAFTA is terminated. [nL2N1MN0G4]

The Mexican auto industry representative said the country's negotiators would likely ask more technical questions about the U.S. automotive content demands during discussions on Monday and Tuesday. The industry would not back down from its opposition to the U.S. proposal, he added.

Another source close to the negotiations said Mexico and Canada consider the U.S. proposal "unviable" and disagree with the concept.

"So we are not in a situation of being able to go over numbers. It is not about analyzing the figures that they put on the table and us returning with other figures," the source said.

UPDATE 1-U.S. rejects Ford petition to delay recall of 3 million vehicles - Reuters News

{{20171118T003538.186+0000}}UPDATE 1-U.S. rejects Ford petition to delay recall of 3 million vehicles(Adds Mazda reaction, timing of review period)

By David Shepardson

WASHINGTON, Nov 17 (Reuters) - The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said on Friday it was rejecting a petition by Ford Motor Co to delay recalling about 3 million vehicles with potentially defective air bag inflators to conduct additional testing.

The agency said it did not find the request by the second largest U.S. automaker "reasonable under the circumstances or supported by the testing and data it has collected to date."

Takata inflators can explode with excessive force, unleashing metal shrapnel inside cars and trucks. At least 18 deaths and 180 injuries worldwide have been tied to the defect that led Takata Corp to file for bankruptcy protection in June and prompted at least 19 automakers to issue recalls.

NHTSA also rejected a similar petition filed by Mazda Motor Co <7261.T> covering about 6,000 vehicles. Mazda said in a statement it "takes our customers' safety as a single-minded top priority and continues to work hand-in-hand with NHTSA."

The public can comment on NHTSA's decision until Dec. 18 on both Ford and Mazda's petitions. Mazda said it would "provide further information once NHTSA issues its final determination."

Ford did not immediately say if it planned to challenge the agency's decision. "We will cooperate with the agency, as we always do," spokeswoman Elizabeth Weigandt said in an email. The vehicles in question include the 2007-11 Ford Ranger, 2006-12 Fusion and Lincoln MKZ, 2006-11 Mercury Milan, and 2007-10 Ford Edge and Lincoln MKX.

In July, NHTSA said new testing prompted Takata to declare inflators defective in Ford, Nissan Motor Co <7201.T> and Mazda vehicles in some driver-side air bags. Nissan agreed to a recall of 515,000 vehicles. [nL1N1KC0ST]

NHTSA agreed in 2016 to a request by General Motors Co to delay a recall of 2.5 million vehicles with Takata air bag inflators as the Detroit automaker conducts additional testing to determine if the vehicles need replacement inflators.

Separately, a report issued on Friday by an independent monitor of the Takata recalls said more than 10 million U.S. vehicles and 18.5 million faulty Takata air bag inflators remain unrepaired in the largest ever auto recall.

Takata has said it expects to have recalled 125 million vehicles worldwide by 2019.

The report said 43.1 million Takata airbag inflators were under recall in 31.5 million vehicles today, with scheduled expansion to about 65 million inflators by the end of 2018. Of those, 24.6 million inflators in 20 million vehicles have been repaired.

In 2019, another 4.1 million vehicles will be recalled to replace interim inflators.

FACTBOX-Automakers get serious about electric cars - Reuters News

{{20171117T170343.037+0000}}FACTBOX-Automakers get serious about electric carsNov 17 (Reuters) - Volkswagen's leaders on Friday approved a five-year spending plan that aims to further the German carmaker's goal of transforming itself into a leading force in electric cars.

Europe's largest carmaker by unit sales will spend more than 34 billion euros ($40 billion) on electric cars, autonomous driving and new mobility services by the end of 2022. [nL8N1NN3IV]

Several carmakers have unveiled plans to mass produce electric vehicles, spurred on by government crackdowns on engine emissions, falling battery costs and an increasing range of electric cars.

China has set strict quotas for electric and plug-in hybrid cars that come into effect from 2019. It has a target of 2 million so-called new-energy vehicle (NEV) sales by 2020 and has signalled that longer term it will phase out the sale of conventional petrol-engine cars.

Here are carmakers' plans for a technology that has only played a marginal role until now:

Tesla Motors Inc – Next year could be make or break for the Californian pure-play electric vehicle maker, which just launched its first mass-market car, the Model 3. The company made just 260 Model 3 sedans in the third quarter due to what it called production bottlenecks. It had planned to build more than 1,500. This month it pushed back its target for volume production by about three months, saying it was difficult to predict how long it would take to fix production bottlenecks. It now expects to build 5,000 Model 3s per week by late in the first quarter of 2018, instead of its original target date of December. [nL2N1N72DJ]

On Thursday, the Palo Alto-based company also unveiled a prototype electric big-rig truck, the Tesla Semi, which it expects to start producing in 2019, and showed off a Roadster electric sports car, which it said will be available in 2020. [nL1N1NM1N4]

Toyota <7203.T> - The Japanese carmaker says it wants all its vehicles to be zero emission by 2050. It has championed its hybrid Prius and has focused much of its efforts on hydrogen vehicle technology. But it says it is not "anti-EV" and is spending heavily on technologies such as the solid-state battery, which has the potential to cut the cost of making electric cars and which Toyota is racing to commercializes by the first half of the 2020s. [nL4N1N23K3]

VW Group – Spurred on by its diesel emissions crisis, Europe's biggest carmaker says it will roll out 80 new electric cars by 2025 across its group brands which include Skoda, SEAT and Audi. VW Group is aiming for 2-3 million electric vehicle sales by 2025. All its models will have electric versions by 2030. The first big test will be the I.D., VW's answer to Tesla's Model 3.

Renault-Nissan <7201.T> – The French-Japanese alliance so far leads the deployment of modern electric cars - 490,000 to date - thanks to the top-selling Nissan Leaf introduced in 2010 and Renault's Zoe subcompact launched two years later. Twelve new pure-electric models will be on the road by 2022 as the alliance seeks to defend its head-start. Nissan has sold 250,000 Leafs and is aiming for a fifth of its vehicles to be zero emission by 2020. But the group is also hedging its bets by developing the hybrid gasoline-electric Nissan Note e-Power. [nL5N1LW0TK]

General Motors – The U.S. automaker plans to launch a new family of electric vehicles in 2021 that will cost less to build and make a profit, Chief Executive Mary Barra told investors this week. She said GM aims to be selling a million electric vehicles a year by 2026, many of them in China. GM still makes most of its profits from selling big, gasoline powered trucks and SUVs to Americans. Its electric Chevrolet Bolt is seen as a serious contender for Tesla. [nL1N1NL0VD]

Ford – The U.S. automaker plans to invest $5 billion in electric vehicles by 2022 and introduce at least 13 electric or hybrid models worldwide in the next five years including a small SUV built in its home state of Michigan offering an estimated range of 300 miles on one charge. It is cutting spending on future internal combustion engines but still plans for a third of vehicles to have internal combustion engines by 2030 - the year some European governments have proposed banning petroleum-fueled cars. Ford has not given any electric vehicle production targets. [nL4N1ME3GX]

Daimler – The company is investing 10 billion euros in electric and hybrid technology and is preparing to launch the EQ electric car. It aims for 100,000 annual electric car sales by 2020. By 2022, Mercedes plans to offer an electric version of every model it sells, with a total of at least 50 electric or hybrid models for sale. The Smart brand will stop offering combustion-engined variants altogether in 2020. [nL5N1H622Z]

BMW – A pioneer in electric cars, BMW launched the i3 in 2013 but sales have been relatively low and management has wrestled with whether to go all-out on electrification. That changed in September when the German manufacturer vowed to achieve mass production by 2025 with 12 fully electric models, with a range of up to 700 kilometres. BMW aims to deliver 100,000 electric cars this year globally. [nL8N1LO3RS]

Fiat – CEO Sergio Marchionne was for years a vocal sceptic of electric cars and their high battery costs, once telling people not to buy the electric Fiat 500e because he was losing money on each car. But in July he told analysts he had "joined the rest of the crew", a change of heart driven partly by the diesel emissions crisis. For now, his most concrete plans involve Fiat Chrysler's luxury, low volume brand Maserati which he wants to be half electric by 2022. [nL1N1HY1A7]

Volvo Cars – All Volvo car models launched after 2019 will be electric or hybrids, the Chinese-owned premium manufacturer said in July, making it the first major traditional carmaker to set a date for phasing out vehicles powered solely by the internal combustion engine. [nL8N1JW0JU]

China's Geely targets Russian market with new Belarus plant - Reuters News

{{20171117T155005.934+0000}}China's Geely targets Russian market with new Belarus plantBy Andrei Makhovsky and Gleb Stolyarov

MINSK/MOSCOW, Nov 17 (Reuters) - A joint venture between Belarus and Chinese carmaker Geely on Friday unveiled a plant producing Belarussian-made vehicles, targeting the Russian market.

The investment is a measure of growing political ties between China and Belarus, a country envisaged as a gateway for China to the European Union, part of China's giant investment initiative known as One Belt One Road.

China is a welcome source of funds for Belarus, which relies heavily on Russian money to keep its Soviet-style economic model afloat and strongman president Alexander Lukashenko in power.

China is building a new airport in Minsk, energy infrastructure and a commercial park known as Great Stone just outside the capital.

Lukashenko said the plant embodied his dream of having cars produced in Belarus and promised to sign a decree stimulating car sales in the country.

"Our friends responded to my request and helped to create this beautiful plant," said Lukashenko, according to the state agency BelTA.

The plant, 70 km (44 miles) from Minsk, aims to produce 25,000 and 35,000 cars in 2018 and 2019 respectively and has the capacity to make 60,000 cars per year.

"Ninety percent of the cars produced will be targeted at the Russian market," the company said in a statement.

The Belarussian authorities have spoken previously of plans to expand the plant to increase production to 120,000 cars.

But for the first nine months of this year, Geely sold only about 1,700 cars in Russia, and sales volumes fell 55 percent compared to 2016.

According to Russian analysts, the plant, which will take advantage of Belarus's membership of the Russian-dominated Eurasian Customs Union, will be able to increase sales.

But even so, analysts downplayed the ability of the Russian market to absorb more Chinese cars.

"The market is growing, but it depends on prices and the range. In any case they will not be able to sell 30,000 per year," said Sergey Udalov, deputy head of consultancy Autostat.

"I think it is possible to increase sales to 10,000, but I do not think they will be able to sell more."

The plant is not Belarus's first attempt to establish its own car production. Previous efforts included investment from Ford and Skoda, but these projects folded.

U.S. car maker Ford to invest over 750 mln euros in Valencia plant - Reuters News

{{20171117T095850.946+0000}}U.S. car maker Ford to invest over 750 mln euros in Valencia plantMADRID, Nov 17 (Reuters) - U.S. car manufacturer Ford announced on Friday it would invest more than 750 million euros ($885 million) in its Spanish plant in the eastern region of Valencia to produce the new model of its Kuga SUV.

The Valencia plant employs over 8,000 people and, in addition to the Kuga, makes the Mondeo, S-Max and Galaxy cars and two models of van - mostly for export. Kuga represents around half of the production of the Valencia plant.

Ford has invested around 3 billion euros in the installations over the past six years, making Valencia one of the two largest assembly operations in Ford's global manufacturing system, alongside the Chongqing factory in China.

"This significant investment underlines Ford's commitment to Spain as one of its most important manufacturing sites in Europe," the Detroit-based company said in a statement.

The investment in the Spanish plant continues a trend of auto production moving south or east in Europe, where wages tend to be lower.

Spain's car industry, including auto parts manufacturers, employs just under 300,000 people, according to official statistics. It accounts for around 7 percent of the country's economic output, according to the vehicle manufacturing association Anfac. ($1 = 0.8475 euros)

(Adds VW investments, model expansion plans, sales chief comment)

By Andreas Cremer

BERLIN, Nov 16 (Reuters) - Volkswagen launched its new Virtus model on Thursday to tap Brazil's highest-volume segment as part of a recovery plan that analysts said will help it regain ground on rivals General Motors and Fiat in South America's largest car market.

The German carmaker said the launch of the new model in Sao Paulo was part of a plan to spend about 1.8 billion euros ($2.12 billion) to roll out 20 new models in Brazil by 2020.

Returning to profit in markets such as Brazil, the United States and Russia is vital for Volkswagen as it pushes to revive the core VW brand that accounted for more than half the group's 7.8 million auto sales in the first nine months but only 19 percent of underlying profit.

The world's biggest automaker last week announced 560 million euros of investment in Argentina to build the first sport-utility vehicle (SUV) in Brazil's neighbour. It hopes the launch of 20 new models in South America by 2020 will restore it to profitability in the region. [nL1N1NG0XF]

"We will do everything possible in coming years to win back the leading position of VW" in Brazil, VW brand sales chief Juergen Stackmann said.

VW, which slashed about 7,000 jobs in South America in past years and shrunk its dealer network, has said it wants to reduce the average age of the brand's Brazilian lineup to less than five years by 2020 from eight years in 2015.

Brazil was one of the world's five biggest auto markets until the 2014-16 downturn and remains a major base of operations for Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV , GM , VW and Ford .

Analysts said VW had been slow in the past few years to refresh models in Brazil and set slightly higher prices than mainstream peers which overhauled lineups in the passenger-car heavy Brazilian market more quickly.

"It's not unrealistic to say that VW had not been refreshing things very quickly," said IHS Markit analyst Stephanie Brinley. Price premiums "are difficult to translate into a (Brazilian) market that doesn't have capacity for a higher price at all."

To cut costs and be able to lower prices, VW fully developed the Virtus in Brazil, giving proof of its post-dieselgate strategy to cede more power from its Wolfsburg headquarters to regions and brands.

VW admitted in September 2015 that it had used illegal software to cheat U.S. diesel emissions tests, sparking the biggest business crisis in its 80-year history and saddling it with a $30 billion bill. [nL8N1MA1FK]

The new four-door Virtus, to be built at Anchieta near Sao Paulo, is one of the first cars to be spawned from a new localised version of the MQB modular platform that underpins most of the VW group's small and medium front-wheel-drive models.

The carmaker said it spent 660 million euros modernising the 60-year-old factory, VW's first plant outside Germany, where the Virtus and Polo will be assembled.

Market research firm IHS expects VW's new models to help narrow the sales gap with market leaders Chevrolet and Fiat.

VW brand sales of passenger cars and light commercial vehicles in Brazil may jump 44 percent to 413,776 units by 2023 from an estimated 286,745 next year, IHS said.

By comparison, IHS expects sales of Fiat to grow only 26 percent to 475,686 cars while it sees sales of Chevrolet rising 18 percent to 444,744 models.

"Brazil may not be the highest-margin market but it's a huge market with vast potential for VW," said NordLB analyst Frank Schwope who has a "Buy" rating on the stock. ($1 = 0.8493 euros)

BERLIN, Nov 16 (Reuters) - Volkswagen launches its new Virtus model on Thursday to tap Brazil's highest-volume segment as part of a recovery plan that analysts said will help it regain ground on rivals General Motors and Fiat in South America's largest car market.

Returning to profit in markets such as Brazil, the United States and Russia is vital for Volkswagen as it pushes to revive the core VW brand that accounted for more than half the group's 7.8 million auto sales in the first nine months but only 19 percent of underlying profit.

To tap rebounding demand in price-sensitive Brazil, VW will on Thursday unveil the "Virtus" compact sedan in Sao Paulo, the carmaker said, after starting deliveries in the country of the redesigned Polo subcompact, one of its all-time bestsellers, and a roomier, bigger Up! minicar.

"Renewing our product portfolio in Brazil is absolutely essential," VW brand chief executive Herbert Diess told a conference in Berlin on Nov. 9.

VW, which slashed about 7,000 jobs in South America in past years and shrunk its dealer network, wants to reduce the average age of the brand's Brazilian lineup to less than five years by 2020 from eight years in 2015, Diess said.

CORRECTED-UPDATE 3-GM challenges Tesla with promise of profitable electric cars  - Reuters News

{{20171115T190117.951+0000}}CORRECTED-UPDATE 3-GM challenges Tesla with promise of profitable electric cars (Corrects to remove reference to 2021 as the date in which GM plans to put a shared autonomous vehicle into commercial service in 14th paragraph)

By Paul Lienert and Nick Carey

Nov 15 (Reuters) - General Motors Co plans to launch a new family of electric vehicles in 2021 that will cost less to build and make a profit for the U.S. No. 1 automaker, Chief Executive Mary Barra told investors on Wednesday.

Her plans represent a direct challenge to money-losing electric vehicle specialist Tesla Inc , which is struggling to get its more affordable, high-volume Model 3 launched and recently reported its largest-ever quarterly loss. [nL2N1N72DJ]

"We are committed to a future electric vehicle portfolio that will be profitable," Barra said at the Barclays Global Automotive Conference in New York.

Electric and autonomous vehicles - known in the industry as EVs and AVs - are widely seen as the keystones of future transport, but Tesla, Ford Motor Co and other manufacturers are still working out how to make money on them.

GM is looking to break out of that pattern by developing an all-new electric vehicle platform that will accommodate multiple sizes and segments, to be sold by different GM brands in the United States and China, Barra said, adding new details to GM's aggressive electrification strategy.

In early October, GM said it planned to launch 20 new electric vehicles by 2023, but did not provide specifics. [nL2N1MD1YS]

In comparison, rival Ford has said it plans to introduce 13 "electrified" vehicles - mostly hybrid gasoline-electric models - by 2022. [nL4N1ME3GX]

GM's shares were down 0.4 percent at $42.84 in midday trade. Tesla and Ford shares were also down slightly in a broadly lower market.

CHEAPER BATTERY

Barra said GM aims to be selling 1 million electric vehicles a year by 2026, many of them in China, which has set strict production quotas on such vehicles. On Monday, GM's China chief said the automaker and its joint-venture partners will be able to meet the country's 2019 electric vehicle requirements without purchasing credits from other companies. [nL3N1NJ344]

GM's cost reduction efforts on electric vehicles center on a new battery system that will be more than 30 percent cheaper than the one that powers the Chevrolet Bolt.

The company aims to cut the cost of its lithium-ion batteries to less than $100 per kilowatt-hour from $145 per kilowatt-hour by 2021, which would bring the overall cost of electric vehicles much closer to comparable gasoline-engine models.

GM said the new batteries would hold more energy and charge quicker. The company is aiming to boost electric vehicle range to more than 300 miles (483 km) with the new batteries. The current Bolt is rated at 238 miles between charges.

Barra said GM will have the ability to manufacture high volumes of the new batteries at plants in the United States and China. She said GM projects sales of 1 million electric vehicles a year by 2026. So far, the company has sold about 17,000 Bolts.

GM's new electric vehicle platform in 2021 will serve as a base for at least nine derivatives, ranging from a compact crossover to a large seven-passenger luxury sports utility vehicle and a large commercial van. It will also provide the underpinning for a shared autonomous vehicle (AV) that GM plans to put into commercial service.

Before the new platform arrives, GM plans to introduce three new electric vehicles by 2020, including two crossovers, that will share basic components with the Bolt, Barra said. She described GM as "the only fully integrated developer of AVs with true scale capability."

"We are not capital constrained in our EV or AV development," she added.

GM is generating strong profit from selling trucks and sport utility vehicles in the United States, and Barra reaffirmed a promise to investors that GM's core North American vehicle business should achieve 10 percent pre-tax profit margins.

U.S. House members oppose Trump administration auto trade rules proposal - Reuters News

{{20171115T183001.960+0000}}U.S. House members oppose Trump administration auto trade rules proposalBy David Shepardson

WASHINGTON, Nov 15 (Reuters) - A bipartisan group of more than 70 members of the U.S. House of Representatives urged the Trump administration on Wednesday not to boost current production requirements on vehicle content for autos produced in the region under the North American Free Trade Agreement.

Under the trade deal, at least 62.5 percent of the material in a car or light truck made in the region must be from North America to be able to enter the marketplace tariff-free.

The Trump administration has proposed raising the proportion of NAFTA content to 85 percent and securing 50 percent of the total for the United States.

The House members include many from auto-producing states such as Representative Mark Sanford of South Carolina, Steve Cohen of Tennessee, Mike Bishop of Michigan and Terri Sewell of Alabama. In a letter seen by Reuters, they wrote that the push by U.S. negotiators "would eliminate the competitive advantages provided to the U.S. auto industry under the current NAFTA rules – or lead to rejection by Canada and Mexico and the end of the agreement."

The letter added that "either outcome would adversely affect the U.S. auto industry - reducing sales, production, and exports and harming U.S. workers in the process."

Talks to overhaul NAFTA are to resume on Wednesday in Mexico City and run through Nov. 21. Trump has sharply criticized the almost 24-year-old trade agreement and called for significant changes, including the addition of a "sunset" provision. Mexico this week said it was preparing contingency plans in the event the talks did not conclude with an agreement.

The U.S. demands to reserve the lion's share of automotive manufacturing for the United States helped cast a pall over the talks to revamp the accord underpinning $1.2 trillion in annual trilateral trade.

The United States had an autos and auto parts trade deficit of $74 billion with Mexico and $5.6 billion with Canada, both major components of overall U.S. goods trade deficits with its North American neighbors -- deficits that U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer has said could no longer continue.

Lighthizer has said the United States wants new measures to ensure "substantial U.S. content" for autos.

Sanford said "tightening the current rule of origin standard, which is already the highest of any trade agreement worldwide, seems like a recipe for disaster."

Global automakers including General Motors Co ), Ford Motor Co , Fiat Chrysler Automobiles , Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T> and Volkswagen all have plants in low-cost Mexico.

STRATIM details its platform to manage fleets for share car services - Reuters News

{{20171114T140001.301+0000}}STRATIM details its platform to manage fleets for share car servicesBy Nick Carey

DETROIT, Nov 14 (Reuters) - Software startup STRATIM is tracking more than 1 million vehicles in car- or ride-sharing services for around 50 customers in North America, including major automakers, to help them boost usage and keep their vehicle fleets in working order, the company said on Tuesday.

STRATIM gave its first public update on Tuesday on its software platform for such services, which help manage vehicle fleets, keep cars in good working order, fueled up and generating sufficient revenue.

San Francisco-based STRATIM's platform is operating in 20 U.S. cities and its clients include General Motors Co's Maven car sharing and rental unit, Ford Motor Co's Chariot shuttle service, Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T> and BMW AG .

Major automakers are racing to roll out alternatives to private car ownership including ride sharing amid the rise of Uber and Lyft Inc, as well as to develop commercially viable self-driving cars.

The rush is based on the notion that instead of buying cars - the auto industry's business model for a century - consumers in the future will generate revenue through car usage.

One challenge for automakers is how to monitor or manage fleets of vehicles when their core traditional business is building cars. STRATIM says it may be part of the answer.

Keeping shared cars in service is key to boosting profit margins as fleet management services can, for instance, provide alerts on when to fuel a car, fix a cracked windshield or replace a flat tire, STRATIM Chief Executive Sean Behr told Reuters.

"It doesn't matter how great your vehicle or self-driving car is if you can't reliably keep it on the street to pick up customers, the best technology in the world is not going to save you," he said.

Companies such as Waymo, Alphabet Inc's self-driving car unit, face the same fleet-management challenge.

Earlier this month AutoNation Inc announced a multi-year partnership where the largest U.S. auto retail chain will maintain and repair Waymo's self-driving fleet. [nL4N1N848F]

In June, Waymo also signed a multi-year agreement with Avis Budget Group Inc for the car rental firm to service its growing autonomous vehicle fleet. [nL1N1JN1E4]

DriveNow, the car-sharing business operated by BMW and car rental agency Sixt SE , has been expanding into cities across Europe. [nL8N1ID3SH]

STRATIM's Behr said the ride-sharing industry is still in its infancy, but is growing rapidly. This quarter his company expects to complete 150,000 car services versus 16,000 in the same quarter in 2016.

"The people who can best maintain those Waymos, Ubers or Mavens ... are ultimately the companies that will have the right kind of margins and will be around for the long haul," he said.

UPDATE 1-Ohio workers vote against union at Chinese auto supplier plant - Reuters News

{{20171110T041709.558+0000}}UPDATE 1-Ohio workers vote against union at Chinese auto supplier plant(Updates with result of vote; adds comments from union and labor expert)

By Nick Carey

Nov 9 (Reuters) - Workers at a Chinese-owned auto glass plant in southwestern Ohio voted heavily against union representation, the United Auto Workers (UAW) said on Thursday, in a major blow for the union's strategy for organizing foreign-owned auto factories.

UAW's defeat comes after a stinging loss it suffered in the U.S. Deep South in August.

The vote, which began on Wednesday, involved roughly 1,500 workers at the Fuyao Glass Industry Group Co Ltd <600660.SS> plant in Moraine, a Dayton suburb that was once home to a large, unionized General Motors Co assembly plant.

The union lost by a nearly two-to-one margin, with 868 votes against union representation and 444 votes for.

"Fuyao workers fighting for a voice in their workplace were unable to win against a barrage of anti-labor tactics and intimidation by management at the Ohio glass plant," the UAW said in a statement.

The UAW needed a win after losing a bitterly contested vote at a Nissan Motor Co Ltd <7201.T> plant in Mississippi in August, which extended a decades-long record of failure to organize a major automaker's plant in the U.S. South. [nL1N1KR04I]

The vote also came amid an expanding U.S. Justice Department probe into alleged misuse of funds at UAW training centers funded by the Detroit automakers. [nL2N1N8232]

Fuyao, a Chinese automotive glass supplier whose global customers include General Motors Co, Ford Motor Co , Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV , Daimler AG and Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T>, opened the plant in Moraine in 2016 as part of a broader $1 billion expansion in the United States. [nL2N1CC2EJ]

Though UAW membership has crept up since the end of the Great Recession, it is around half of what it was in 1998 and well below a peak of 1.5 million members in 1979. The Detroit automakers and their suppliers have slashed workforces at UAW-represented factories over the past 30 years as they have automated and lost sales to European and Asian rivals.

This year could be the first in which North American vehicle production by the unionized Detroit Three automakers falls to less than half of total vehicle output in the region, according to IHS Markit. [nL2N1M81RG]

(http://tmsnrt.rs/2znJWBW)

At Fuyao's Ohio factory, the UAW told workers it could help secure better safety and higher pay.

Rich Rankin, head of the UAW region covering Ohio and Indiana, said workers at the Fuyao plant start at $10 an hour, much less than the $22 an hour they can make at two other unionized automotive glass plants in his region.

He said he grew up hearing about U.S. companies that would go abroad and pay workers low wages in poor conditions.

"It's amazing to me that this is now happening to U.S. workers in America's manufacturing heartland," he said on Tuesday.

The battle over unionizing at what was once a union-represented GM plant in a state with nearly 50,000 active UAW members drew politicians on both sides.

U.S. Senator Sherrod Brown, a Democrat, wrote to Fuyao in October saying its success is "contingent on creating a safe and supportive working environment".

Meanwhile, 15 Ohio Republican state representatives wrote an open letter urging employees to reject "outside forces" trying to come into the Chinese supplier's Ohio factory.

Harley Shaiken, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, specializing in labor and the global economy, said while workers had real grievances at the plant, rules preventing unions from talking to workers inside factories played in Fuyao's favor.

"The employer in this case moved aggressively against the unionizing driver," he said. "In the current climate of fear among U.S. workers of job losses or plants moving elsewhere, that carried the day."

Ford, Ekso team up for 'bionic' auto workers - Reuters Health Industry Briefing

{{20171109T223121.145+0000}}Ford, Ekso team up for 'bionic' auto workersFORD-EKSO/WORKERS (PIX):Ford, Ekso team up for 'bionic' auto workers

WAYNE, Mich., Nov 9 (Reuters) - Robots have replaced many U.S. manufacturing workers, but new mechanical exoskeletons being tested by Ford Motor Co may help factory workers to function like bionic people, reducing the physical damage of millions of repetitive tasks over many years.

The U.S. automaker said on Thursday that workers at two U.S. factories are testing upper-body exoskeletons developed by Richmond, California-based Ekso Bionics Holdings Inc, which are designed to reduce injuries and increase productivity.

The four EksoVests were paid for by the United Auto Workers union, which represents hourly workers at Ford, and the automaker plans tests for the exoskeleton in other regions including Europe and South America. The cost of the exoskeletons, which were developed as part of a partnership between Ford and Ekso, was undisclosed.

Two workers at each of the company's Wayne and Flat Rock factories have been testing the exoskeletons since May.

The lightweight vest supports workers while they perform overhead tasks, providing lift assistance of up to 15 pounds (6.8 kg) per arm through a mechanical actuator that uses torque to take the stress off a worker's shoulders.

If you try one on, if feels like an empty backpack, but it enables you to hold a weight such as a heavy wrench straight out in front of you indefinitely and without strain.

Ekso began by developing exoskeletons for the military and medical fields, but branched out in manufacturing and construction in 2013.

Paul "Woody" Collins, 51, a worker at Ford's Wayne plant, has been at the automaker for 23 years and has worn an EksoVest since May. He attaches bolts and parts to the undersides of Ford Focus and C-Max models, raising his hands above his head around 1 million times a year.

Since wearing the vest, he has stopped having to put ice and heat on his neck three or four days a week and finds he has energy after work instead of feeling exhausted.

Russ Angold, Ekso's chief technology officer, said the aim is to get workers used to the technology before moving eventually into "powered" exoskeletons that "will help with lift and carry" work.

"The idea is to demonstrate this isn't science fiction, it's real and it has real value," Angold said on Thursday. "As we prove its value, we will be able to expand into other tasks."

The No. 2 U.S. automaker has been studying for years how to lower its workers' injury rates and the exoskeleton venture is the latest step in that process.

From 2005 to 2016, Ford recorded an 83 percent decrease in injuries or incidents that resulted in days away, work restrictions or job transfers, to a rate of 1.55 incidents per 100 full-time employees.

That is a little over half the rate of 2.9 cases per 100 workers for private employers in 2016, according to U.S. government data.

"We have made great progress, but shoulders are still our number one injury and they take a lot of time to heal," Marty Smets, the Ford ergonomics engineer in charge of testing the exoskeletons, said on Thursday..

Collins, the Ford worker in Wayne, was supposed to wear the vest only until August, but has now asked to keep it.

"If they want it back now, they're going to have to fight me to get it off," he said.

Ford, Ekso team up for 'bionic' auto workers - Reuters News

{{20171109T222652.261+0000}}Ford, Ekso team up for 'bionic' auto workersBy Nick Carey

WAYNE, Mich., Nov 9 (Reuters) - Robots have replaced many U.S. manufacturing workers, but new mechanical exoskeletons being tested by Ford Motor Co may help factory workers to function like bionic people, reducing the physical damage of millions of repetitive tasks over many years.

The U.S. automaker said on Thursday that workers at two U.S. factories are testing upper-body exoskeletons developed by Richmond, California-based Ekso Bionics Holdings Inc , which are designed to reduce injuries and increase productivity.

The four EksoVests were paid for by the United Auto Workers union, which represents hourly workers at Ford, and the automaker plans tests for the exoskeleton in other regions including Europe and South America. The cost of the exoskeletons, which were developed as part of a partnership between Ford and Ekso, was undisclosed.

Two workers at each of the company's Wayne and Flat Rock factories have been testing the exoskeletons since May.

The lightweight vest supports workers while they perform overhead tasks, providing lift assistance of up to 15 pounds (6.8 kg) per arm through a mechanical actuator that uses torque to take the stress off a worker's shoulders.

If you try one on, if feels like an empty backpack, but it enables you to hold a weight such as a heavy wrench straight out in front of you indefinitely and without strain.

Ekso began by developing exoskeletons for the military and medical fields, but branched out in manufacturing and construction in 2013.

Paul "Woody" Collins, 51, a worker at Ford's Wayne plant, has been at the automaker for 23 years and has worn an EksoVest since May. He attaches bolts and parts to the undersides of Ford Focus and C-Max models, raising his hands above his head around 1 million times a year.

Since wearing the vest, he has stopped having to put ice and heat on his neck three or four days a week and finds he has energy after work instead of feeling exhausted.

Russ Angold, Ekso's chief technology officer, said the aim is to get workers used to the technology before moving eventually into "powered" exoskeletons that "will help with lift and carry" work.

"The idea is to demonstrate this isn't science fiction, it's real and it has real value," Angold said on Thursday. "As we prove its value, we will be able to expand into other tasks."

The No. 2 U.S. automaker has been studying for years how to lower its workers' injury rates and the exoskeleton venture is the latest step in that process.

From 2005 to 2016, Ford recorded an 83 percent decrease in injuries or incidents that resulted in days away, work restrictions or job transfers, to a rate of 1.55 incidents per 100 full-time employees.

That is a little over half the rate of 2.9 cases per 100 workers for private employers in 2016, according to U.S. government data.

"We have made great progress, but shoulders are still our number one injury and they take a lot of time to heal," Marty Smets, the Ford ergonomics engineer in charge of testing the exoskeletons, said on Thursday..

Collins, the Ford worker in Wayne, was supposed to wear the vest only until August, but has now asked to keep it.

"If they want it back now, they're going to have to fight me to get it off," he said.

UPDATE 2-NAFTA uncertainty could delay corporate investment - Magna CEO - Reuters News

{{20171109T163546.767+0000}}UPDATE 2-NAFTA uncertainty could delay corporate investment - Magna CEO(Recasts with CEO comments)

By Akshara P and Allison Lampert

Nov 9 (Reuters) - Canadian auto parts maker Magna International Inc's chief executive said on Thursday that uncertainty over NAFTA and proposed U.S. corporate tax cuts could prompt companies to suspend investment or pour capital into the United States.

U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to withdraw from the North American Free Trade Agreement among the United States, Canada and Mexico, which is heavily used by automakers that have production and supply chains spread across the three countries.

"I think anybody that is contemplating any big investments over the long term is probably either waiting or they are going to be biased to invest more in the U.S. until there's an outcome here," CEO Don Walker said on an analysts call, when asked about the impact of NAFTA talks on automakers.

But he said Magna had not changed the way it deploys capital because of NAFTA renegotiations or proposed U.S. corporate tax cuts.

Trump has proposed changes to the rules of origin for autos, which are used to determine how much of a vehicle is made in a certain place. The proposed rules were viewed as untenable for automakers, as well as Mexico and Canada. [nL2N1MZ1RA]

On Thursday, Magna raised its full-year sales forecast for the third time this year on strength from outside North America, but warned that part of its transmission business could soften after 2017.

Magna Chief Financial Officer Vince Galifi told analysts that the company anticipates "some softening" in unconsolidated sales over the next couple of years from its Getrag business, which makes transmissions in locations such as Europe and China.

The softening "relates to a market shift from manual transmissions to automatic," in addition to certain customer growth plans now being forecast lower than previously expected, he said.

Magna shares fell 2.1 percent in Thursday trade. On Wednesday, shares in rival auto parts maker Linamar Corp fell more than 13 percent after reporting lower-than-expected earnings. [nL3N1NE5LW]

"Regardless of the lower than previously anticipated unconsolidated net sales, we still expect significant growth in Getrag's business over the next few years," Galifi said.

Ontario-headquartered Magna said it now expects 2017 total sales of $38.3 billion to $39.5 billion, compared with its previous forecast of $37.7 billion to $39.4 billion.

Total third-quarter sales grew 7 percent on an annual basis to $9.50 billion, as stronger demand in Europe and Asia offset a 5 percent decline in North America, where U.S. auto sales are expected to weaken in 2017. For details: [nASB0BSPS]

Magna, which also assembles cars under contract from motor vehicle manufacturers, counts General Motors Co , Volkswagen AG , BMW and Ford Motor Co as its biggest customers.

Magna also announced plans to buy back 35.8 million shares.

By Matthew Miller and Adam Jourdan

BEIJING/SHANGHAI, Nov 9 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump can return to the United States claiming to have snagged over $250 billion in deals from his maiden trip to Beijing. Whether those deals live up to the lofty price tag is another question altogether.

Watched by Trump and China's President Xi Jinping at a signing ceremony in Beijing, U.S. planemaker Boeing Co , General Electric Co and chip giant Qualcomm Inc sealed lucrative multi-billion dollar deals.

"This is truly a miracle," China's Commerce Minister Zhong Shan said at a briefing in Beijing.

The quarter of a trillion dollar haul underscores how Trump is keen to be seen to address a trade deficit with the world's second-largest economy that he has long railed against and called "shockingly high" on Thursday.

But U.S. businesses still have many long-standing concerns to complain about, including unfettered access to the China market, cybersecurity and the growing presence of China's ruling Communist Party inside foreign firms.

William Zarit, chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, said the deals pointed to "a strong, vibrant bilateral economic relationship" between the two countries.

"Yet we still need to focus on levelling the playing field, because U.S. companies continue to be disadvantaged doing business in China."

U.S. tech companies like Facebook Inc and Google are mostly blocked in China. Automakers Ford Motor Co and General Motors must operate through joint ventures, while Hollywood movies face a strict quota system.

"(These deals) allow Trump to portray himself as a master dealmaker, while distracting from a lack of progress on structural reforms to the bilateral trade relationship," Hugo Brennan, Asia analyst at risk consultancy Verisk Maplecroft, said in a note.

PUMP IT UP

Some huge deals were announced. Among them is a 20-year $83.7 billion investment by China Energy Investment Corp in shale gas developments and chemical manufacturing projects in West Virginia, a major energy producing state that voted heavily for Trump in the 2016 election. [[nL3N1NF375]

"The massive size of this energy undertaking and level of collaboration between our two countries is unprecedented," West Virginia Secretary of Commerce H. Wood Thrasher said in a statement.

It marks the first major overseas investment for the newly founded China Energy, which formed from the merger of China Shenhua Group, the country's largest coal producer and China Guodian Corp, one of China's top five utilities.

However, as is often the case during state visits, many of the deals were packaged as "non-binding" agreements, gave scant details or rolled over existing tie-ups, helping pump up the headline figure.

"I am somewhat sceptical of such a large number," Alex Wolf, senior emerging markets economist at Aberdeen Standard Investments, told the Reuters Global Markets Forum, adding that the overall tone of the visit so far had been "positive".

"I suspect they might be primarily MOUs (memorandum of understandings) instead of actual contracts and the actual contract amount may be substantially less."

Qualcomm signed non-binding agreements worth $12 billion with Xiaomi, OPPO and Vivo, three Chinese handset makers that the firm said it had "longstanding relationships" with. Qualcomm already earns more than half of its revenues in China.

Boeing announced a deal with state-run China Aviation Suppliers Holding Co to sell 300 Boeing jets with a valuation of $37 billion at list prices, though analysts said it was unclear how many of these were new orders. [L3N1NF2VA]

"Interesting to see how many of those are past agreements/purchase orders repackaged. Beijing is a master of selling the same agreement 10 times," former Mexican ambassador to China Jorge Guajardo posted on Twitter.

XI VOWS TRANSPARENCY

Speaking alongside Trump in Beijing as they announced the deals, Xi said the Chinese economy would become increasingly open and transparent to foreign firms, including those from the United States, and welcomed U.S. companies to participate in his ambitious "Belt and Road" infrastructure-led initiative.

Trump made clear he blamed his predecessors, not China, for allowing the U.s. trade deficit to get "out of kilter", and repeatedly praised Xi, calling him "a very special man".

"But we will make it fair and it will be tremendous for both of us," Trump said.

Xi smiled widely when Trump said he does not blame China for the deficit.

Asked whether the big package of deals would go some way towards helping fix American trade concerns in China, executives were cautiously optimistic.

"Generally the sense was that this is all a good thing, and that's great," said Gentry Sayad, a Shanghai-based lawyer who attended the trade delegation event in Beijing.

"Now let's see what really happens and whether or not the agreements signed during this trip can become a basis for a better bilateral trade relationship going forward."

Trump's $250 bln China "miracle" adds gloss to off-kilter trade - Reuters News

By Matthew Miller and Adam Jourdan

BEIJING/SHANGHAI, Nov 9 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump can return to the United States claiming to have snagged over $250 billion in deals from his maiden trip to Beijing. Whether those deals live up to the lofty price tag is another question altogether.

Watched by Trump and China's President Xi Jinping at a signing ceremony in Beijing, U.S. planemaker Boeing Co , General Electric Co and chip giant Qualcomm Inc sealed lucrative multi-billion dollar deals.

"This is truly a miracle," China's Commerce Minister Zhong Shan said at a briefing in Beijing.

The quarter of a trillion dollar haul underscores how Trump is keen to be seen to address a trade deficit with the world's second-largest economy that he has long railed against and called "shockingly high" on Thursday.

Trump has ratcheted up his criticism of China's massive trade surplus with the United States - $34.6 billion in September - calling it "embarrassing" and "horrible" last week.

But many long-standing concerns that U.S. businesses have in China remain, including unfettered access to the China market, cybersecurity and the growing presence of China's ruling Communist Party inside foreign firms.

"This (deal) shows that we have a strong, vibrant bilateral economic relationship, and yet we still need to focus on levelling the playing field, because U.S. companies continue to be disadvantaged doing business in China," William Zarit, chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, told Reuters.

U.S. tech companies like Facebook Inc and Google are mostly blocked in China. Automakers Ford Motor Co and General Motors must operate through joint ventures, while Hollywood movies face a strict quota system.

PUMP IT UP

As is often the case during state visits, many of the deals were packaged as "non-binding" agreements, gave scant details or rolled over existing tie-ups, helping pump up the headline figure.

Qualcomm signed non-binding deals worth $12 billion with Xiaomi, OPPO and Vivo, three Chinese handset makers the firm said it had "longstanding relationships" with. Qualcomm already earns more than half of its revenues in China.

Boeing signed $37 billion in commercial deals, although initial details were scarce. [nS6N1MZ029]

"Interesting to see how many of those are past agreements/purchase orders repackaged. Beijing is a master of selling the same agreement 10 times," former Mexican ambassador to China Jorge Guajardo posted on Twitter.

Trump did, however, press Xi hard on improving the trade balance between the two countries on Thursday.

"The United States has to change its policies because they have gotten so far behind on trade with China and frankly with many other countries," he told reporters, adding previous U.S. administrations had allowed it to get "out of kilter".

"We have to fix this," he said.

Asked whether the big package of deals would go some way towards helping fix American trade concerns in China, executives were cautiously optimistic.

"Generally, the sense was that this is all a good thing, and that's great," said Gentry Sayad, a Shanghai-based lawyer who took part in the delegation in Beijing. "Now let's see what really happens."

Ohio workers vote on unionization at Chinese supplier plant - Reuters News

{{20171109T060335.834+0000}}Ohio workers vote on unionization at Chinese supplier plantBy Nick Carey

Nov 9 (Reuters) - Workers at a Chinese-owned auto glass plant in southwestern Ohio will finish voting on Thursday on whether to join the United Auto Workers, in a test of the union's strategy for organizing foreign-owned auto factories after a stinging loss in the U.S. Deep South in August.

The vote, which began on Wednesday, involves roughly 1,500 workers at the Fuyao Glass Industry Group Co Ltd <600660.SS> plant in Moraine, a Dayton suburb that was once home to a large, unionized General Motors Co assembly plant.

The UAW needs a win after losing a bitterly contested vote at a Nissan Motor Co Ltd <7201.T> plant in Mississippi in August, which extended a decades-long record of failure to organize a major automaker's plant in the U.S. South. [nL1N1KR04I]

The vote also comes amid an expanding U.S. Justice Department probe into alleged misuse of funds at UAW training centers funded by the Detroit automakers. [nL2N1N8232]

Fuyao, a Chinese automotive glass supplier whose global customers include General Motors Co , Ford Motor Co , Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV , Daimler AG and Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T>, opened the plant in Moraine in 2016 as part of a broader $1 billion expansion in the United States. [nL2N1CC2EJ]

Though UAW membership has crept up since the end of the Great Recession, it is around half of what it was in 1998 and well below a peak of 1.5 million members in 1979. The Detroit automakers and their suppliers have slashed workforces at UAW-represented factories over the past 30 years as they have automated and lost sales to European and Asian rivals.

This year could be the first in which North American vehicle production by the unionized Detroit Three automakers falls to less than half of total vehicle output in the region, according to IHS Markit. [nL2N1M81RG]

(http://tmsnrt.rs/2znJWBW)

At Fuyao's Ohio factory, the UAW has told workers it can help them secure better safety and higher pay.

Rich Rankin, head of the UAW region covering Ohio and Indiana, said workers at the Fuyao plant start at $10 an hour, much less than the $22 an hour they can make at two other unionized automotive glass plants in his region.

He said he grew up hearing about U.S. companies that would go abroad and pay workers low wages in poor conditions.

"It's amazing to me that this is now happening to U.S. workers in America's manufacturing heartland," he said on Tuesday.

The battle over unionizing at what was once a union-represented GM plant in a state with nearly 50,000 active UAW members has brought in politicians on both sides.

U.S. Senator Sherrod Brown, a Democrat, wrote to Fuyao in October saying its success is "contingent on creating a safe and supportive working environment."

Meanwhile, 15 Ohio Republican state representatives wrote an open letter urging employees to reject "outside forces" trying to come into the Chinese supplier's Ohio factory.

Harley Shaiken, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, specializing in labor and the global economy, said on Wednesday that Ohio's history of unionization might be one of the few factors working in the UAW's favor.

But Shaiken said that rules preventing unions from talking to workers inside factories meant that employers have "vast resources and leverage to create an atmosphere of fear" for workers ahead of unionizing votes.

"It's not a level playing field, as the unions aren't even allowed in the stadium," Shaiken added.

LPC: Auto parts maker Chassix seeks fix for struggling dividend loan - Reuters News

{{20171108T235132.213+0000}}LPC: Auto parts maker Chassix seeks fix for struggling dividend loanBy Andrew Berlin

NEW YORK, Nov 8 (Reuters) - US auto parts manufacturer Chassix is exploring revisions to a US$320m leveraged loan backing a dividend to shareholders, following investors' lack of interest amid concerns over declining earnings, according to three sources familiar with the matter.

Lead arranger JP Morgan is discussing reducing the size of the loan and the dividend payment and juicing pricing to lure buyers, who are wary of piling debt onto a company that has seen earnings drop since emerging from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection two years ago.

Chassix's Ebitda, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, dropped 4.7% in 2016 and is projected to fall a further 14.3% this year, two additional sources said. The company is still experiencing a run-off of business from its restructuring that will impact revenues, which are tethered to a cyclical end market.

"The company exited [bankruptcy] in 2015, and performance is still declining as some business rolls off," an investor said. "They seem to have a good book of business, but this can go away if car sales decline, plus price concessions to original equipment manufacturers are always present."

STOP SHORT

The deal marks Chassix's debut in the US$939bn leveraged loan market. It is the company's first trip to the capital markets since emerging in July 2015 from a four-month stint in bankruptcy court in part precipitated by capacity constraints at its manufacturing plant in Bristol, Indiana that drove losses.

The company, which supplies chassis and powertrain components to auto manufacturers including General Motors, Ford and FCA, emerged from bankruptcy protection owned by its former bondholders including Cerberus Capital Management and Oaktree Capital Management. Platinum Equity, the private equity firm that owned the company prior to the filing, transferred its equity to the funds as part of the restructuring process.

Chassix did not respond to requests for comment. JP Morgan and spokespersons for Cerberus and Oaktree declined to comment.

Proceeds from the seven-year term loan, as originally proposed, along with balance sheet cash, were earmarked to fund a US$260m cash distribution to the new owners, repay existing debt and cover fees and expenses. The financing includes a US$125m five-year asset-based revolving credit facility that will be undrawn at close. Investors were expected to commit to the original deal by November 2.

The company is considering downsizing the loan to US$200m-US$225m, and the dividend by a similar amount, the three sources said. It may also hike pricing to as much as 550bp over Libor, from the 475bp-500bp range at launch in mid-October, and further discount the offering price to 98, from 99, the sources added. There will likely be other structural changes.

The original deal would have put the company's debt-to Ebitda at 2.3 times, based on US$138m of projected 2017 adjusted Ebitda, compared to roughly 0.4 times currently, according to two of the sources. With a loan of around US$215m, debt-to-Ebitda would drop to 1.6 times.

Chassix was formed in 2013 through the merger of Diversified Machine Inc and SMW Automotive, LLC.

The company is rated B2/B by Moody's and Standard & Poor's, respectively, while the proposed loan is rated B3/B.

Ford, China's Zotye Auto invest $756 mln in electric vehicle JV - Reuters News

{{20171108T122628.102+0000}}Ford, China's Zotye Auto invest $756 mln in electric vehicle JVHONG KONG, Nov 8 (Reuters) - Ford Motor and China's Anhui Zotye Automobile <000980.SZ> have agreed to invest a combined $756 million to set up a 50-50 joint venture in China to build electric passenger vehicles, both companies said on Wednesday.

The new joint venture, Zotye Ford Automobile Co. Ltd, plans to build a manufacturing plant in Zhejiang province and will sell all-electric vehicles under a new Chinese brand, tapping into a boom for such vehicles in the world's top auto market, Ford Motor said in a statement.

"Zotye Ford will introduce a new brand family of small all-electric vehicles," Ford group vice president Peter Fleet said in the statement. "We will be exploring innovative vehicle connectivity and mobility service solutions for a new generation of young city-dwelling Chinese customers."

The JV deal was signed during U.S. President Donald Trump's visit to China as the two countries inked commercial deals worth about $9 billion. [nL3N1NE3PY]

In addition to the new JV, Ford and Zotye will explore offering mobility services to consumers in China as local demand for such solutions continues to grow, Ford's statement added.

China, struggling with alarming pollution levels in major cities, is aggressively pushing plug-in vehicles and has poured in tens of billions of yuan in investment, research funding and subsidies, drawing many new automakers to launch projects.

RPT-INSIGHT-Peak oil? Majors aren't buying into the threat from renewables - Reuters News

{{20171108T120002.956+0000}}RPT-INSIGHT-Peak oil? Majors aren't buying into the threat from renewables(Repeats for additional clients with no changes to text)

By Ernest Scheyder and Ron Bousso

HOUSTON/LONDON, Nov 8 (Reuters) - Two decades ago, BP set out to transcend oil, adopting a sunburst logo to convey its plans to pour $8 billion over a decade into renewable technologies, even promising to power its gas stations with the sun.

That transformation - marketed as "Beyond Petroleum" - led to manufacturing solar panels in Australia, Spain and the United States and erecting wind farms in the United States and the Netherlands.

Today, BP might be more aptly branded "Back to Petroleum" after exiting or scaling back its renewable energy investments. Lower-cost Chinese components upended its solar panel business, which the firm shed in 2011. A year later, BP tried to sell its U.S. wind power business but couldn't get a buyer.

"We made very big bets in the past," BP Chief Executive Bob Dudley told Reuters in an interview. "A lot of those didn't work. We're not sure yet what will be commercially acceptable."

The costly lesson of the biggest foray yet by an oil major into renewable energy was not lost on rival firms.

Even as governments and environmentalists forecast a peak in oil demand within a generation - and China and India say they may eventually ban gasoline and diesel vehicles - leaders of the world's biggest oil firms are not buying the argument that their traditional business faces any imminent threat.

A Reuters analysis of clean energy investments and forecasts by oil majors, along with exclusive interviews with top oil executives, reveal mostly token investments in alternative energy. Today, renewable power projects get about 3 percent of $100 billion in combined annual spending by the five biggest oil firms, according to energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie.

BP, Chevron , Exxon Mobil , Royal Dutch Shell and Total are instead milking their drilling and processing assets to finance investor payouts now and bolster balance sheets for the future. They believe they can enter new energy sectors later by acquiring companies or technologies if and when others prove them profitable.

"There is no sign of peak demand right now," said Chevron CEO John Watson, an economist by training, who is retiring in early 2018. "For the next 10 or 20 years, we expect to see oil demand growth."

The International Energy Agency forecasts a 10 percent rise in oil demand through 2040, reflecting the consensus among oil firms. The earliest estimate for peak oil demand from any oil company is late next decade, by Shell CEO Ben van Beurden.

History shows energy transitions - from wood to coal to oil - take a long time. Coal's contribution to world energy consumption peaked recently at 28 percent and remains above the share from natural gas, though just below oil's one-third.

Profit, if any, from the majors' decades-long interest in renewable energy ventures is unclear. None of the largest oil companies disclose earnings from their solar, wind or biofuels ventures.

Investors such as Alasdair McKinnon, portfolio manager at Scottish Investment Trust, believe oil will sustain shareholders far into the future.

"There isn't a viable alternative to fossil fuels on the horizon," he said. "We're not buying into the long-term demand destruction for oil."

The confidence in oil's future relies largely on rising consumption from emerging economies. Exxon forecasts that transportation will require 25 percent more fuel by 2040, propelled by growth in Asia. Chevron's analysis of the India and Nigeria markets, meanwhile, concludes that infrastructure needed for electric cars is unlikely to be built.

Cars account for about a fifth of oil consumption, BP estimates. So if electric vehicles do eventually capture mass markets, oil firms would still expect growing demand from the air, rail and trucking industries.

Natural gas - now a smaller business than oil for most majors - can grow to nearly a quarter of all energy used by displacing coal in power generation and through expanded uses in chemicals, these companies forecast. Natural gas can also fuel the power needed for electric cars.

Although Shell forecasts peak oil demand coming earlier than its rivals, it is preparing for that prospect mostly with massive natural gas investments. The firm last year spent $54 billion acquiring BG Group, which derives half its production from gas. Chevron, Exxon and Shell recently have spent billions of dollars on new liquefied natural gas projects across the globe.

Exxon declined to comment for this article.

SHORT-SIGHTED STRATEGY?

Critics of oil majors' cautious renewable strategy - including some big investors - say the firms are being short-sighted in their trust that change will come slow, or that one fossil fuel will gradually replace another. Just as cheap natural gas is supplanting coal, even cheaper wind or solar eventually will displace gas, they argue.

South Australia is soon to become a proving ground for a project could pave the way for renewable power to supplant fossil fuels for peak electricity - a combined wind farm and grid-scale battery storage facility, by electric-car maker Tesla Inc and operator Windlab Ltd.

Fossil fuel companies need to quickly reorient themselves to the low returns of the solar and wind industries, said Jules Kortenhorst, a former Shell executive who runs the Rocky Mountain Institute, a nonprofit energy research organization.

"You cannot flip a switch on a Monday morning from being one to another," he said. "Paychecks in the oil and gas industry are based on fundamentally believing that the world cannot see economic growth without fossil fuels."

To achieve the same share of the renewables market that the largest publicly-traded oil companies now hold in oil and gas would require an investment of about $350 billion over the next 18 years, estimates Wood Mackenzie. Such spending would cut into the generous dividends that oil firms' shareholders have come to expect.

"We think it will be a real challenge for these companies to change their business model," said Nathan Fabian, director of policy at Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI), a United Nations-backed group.

PRI has guidelines calling for investment analysis that weighs environmental, social and governance issues. Its principles have been adopted by investors with $70 trillion in assets under management.

SMALL SCALE RENEWABLES INVESTMENTS

Oil companies have made relatively modest investments a wide range of renewable technologies. Chevron has a smattering of mostly small wind and solar ventures; Shell invests in sugar-cane ethanol in South America, wind farms in the United States and electric-car charging stations in Europe; and BP still owns the U.S. wind farms it once tried to sell.

John Browne - who as BP's CEO two decades ago helped launch the early investments in renewables - said he still believes the renewable power will grow.

"It will take time," he said in an interview with Reuters last month. "And they have time."

Shell pledged to invest up to $1 billion a year by 2020 in what it calls "new energies."

Total said this year it would spend $500 million annually on developing alternatives. But soon after that announcement, it unveiled its $7.5 billion acquisition of Maersk Oil, part of a plan to pump more crude from Norway's North Sea.

Total CEO Patrick Pouyanne in October explained the focus on economics at an October oil conference in London.

"When you ask our customers what their priority is, either in developed economies or in emerging countries, price comes first," he said. A hasty shift to renewables, he said, "could bring great economic and social damage to our 6 billion customers."

Exxon Mobil is backing research into biofuels, joining with gene modification firm Synthetic Genomics to coax algae to produce more lipids, an oil substitute. It hasn't detailed its investment but said the effort remains far from commercialization. By comparison, Exxon this year spent $5.6 billion on U.S. shale oil assets.

BATTERY-POWERED CARS, PLANES

Some of the oil industry's largest customers are planning a shift to renewable alternatives, especially in transportation, which accounts for about a quarter of annual energy consumption.

Ford Motor Co earlier this fall disclosed it would aim, by 2030, to derive a third of its sales from battery-powered cars and another third from gas-electric hybrids. [nL4N1ME3GX]

A startup backed by Boeing Co and JetBlue Airways Corp recently announced plans for a small hybrid jet by 2022, using batteries from Tesla and battery supplier Panasonic Corp <6752.T>. [nL2N1MG1HZ]

Yet oil firms continue to forecast aggressive growth in liquid fuels. Exxon predicts 90 percent of the transportation industry will rely on petroleum through 2040.

INSIGHT-Peak oil? Majors aren't buying into the threat from renewables - Reuters News

{{20171108T060002.732+0000}}INSIGHT-Peak oil? Majors aren't buying into the threat from renewablesBy Ernest Scheyder and Ron Bousso

HOUSTON/LONDON, Nov 8 (Reuters) - Two decades ago, BP set out to transcend oil, adopting a sunburst logo to convey its plans to pour $8 billion over a decade into renewable technologies, even promising to power its gas stations with the sun.

That transformation - marketed as "Beyond Petroleum" - led to manufacturing solar panels in Australia, Spain and the United States and erecting wind farms in the United States and the Netherlands.

Today, BP might be more aptly branded "Back to Petroleum" after exiting or scaling back its renewable energy investments. Lower-cost Chinese components upended its solar panel business, which the firm shed in 2011. A year later, BP tried to sell its U.S. wind power business but couldn't get a buyer.

"We made very big bets in the past," BP Chief Executive Bob Dudley told Reuters in an interview. "A lot of those didn't work. We're not sure yet what will be commercially acceptable."

The costly lesson of the biggest foray yet by an oil major into renewable energy was not lost on rival firms.

Even as governments and environmentalists forecast a peak in oil demand within a generation - and China and India say they may eventually ban gasoline and diesel vehicles - leaders of the world's biggest oil firms are not buying the argument that their traditional business faces any imminent threat.

A Reuters analysis of clean energy investments and forecasts by oil majors, along with exclusive interviews with top oil executives, reveal mostly token investments in alternative energy. Today, renewable power projects get about 3 percent of $100 billion in combined annual spending by the five biggest oil firms, according to energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie.

BP, Chevron , Exxon Mobil , Royal Dutch Shell and Total are instead milking their drilling and processing assets to finance investor payouts now and bolster balance sheets for the future. They believe they can enter new energy sectors later by acquiring companies or technologies if and when others prove them profitable.

"There is no sign of peak demand right now," said Chevron CEO John Watson, an economist by training, who is retiring in early 2018. "For the next 10 or 20 years, we expect to see oil demand growth."

For a graphic showing BP's fossil fuel and renewable energy forecasts, see: http://tmsnrt.rs/2h4vGHd

The International Energy Agency forecasts a 10 percent rise in oil demand through 2040, reflecting the consensus among oil firms. The earliest estimate for peak oil demand from any oil company is late next decade, by Shell CEO Ben van Beurden.

History shows energy transitions - from wood to coal to oil - take a long time. Coal's contribution to world energy consumption peaked recently at 28 percent and remains above the share from natural gas, though just below oil's one-third.

Profit, if any, from the majors' decades-long interest in renewable energy ventures is unclear. None of the largest oil companies disclose earnings from their solar, wind or biofuels ventures.

Investors such as Alasdair McKinnon, portfolio manager at Scottish Investment Trust, believe oil will sustain shareholders far into the future.

"There isn't a viable alternative to fossil fuels on the horizon," he said. "We're not buying into the long-term demand destruction for oil."

The confidence in oil's future relies largely on rising consumption from emerging economies. Exxon forecasts that transportation will require 25 percent more fuel by 2040, propelled by growth in Asia. Chevron's analysis of the India and Nigeria markets, meanwhile, concludes that infrastructure needed for electric cars is unlikely to be built.

Cars account for about a fifth of oil consumption, BP estimates. So if electric vehicles do eventually capture mass markets, oil firms would still expect growing demand from the air, rail and trucking industries.

Natural gas - now a smaller business than oil for most majors - can grow to nearly a quarter of all energy used by displacing coal in power generation and through expanded uses in chemicals, these companies forecast. Natural gas can also fuel the power needed for electric cars.

Although Shell forecasts peak oil demand coming earlier than its rivals, it is preparing for that prospect mostly with massive natural gas investments. The firm last year spent $54 billion acquiring BG Group, which derives half its production from gas. Chevron, Exxon and Shell recently have spent billions of dollars on new liquefied natural gas projects across the globe.

Exxon declined to comment for this article.

SHORT-SIGHTED STRATEGY?

Critics of oil majors' cautious renewable strategy - including some big investors - say the firms are being short-sighted in their trust that change will come slow, or that one fossil fuel will gradually replace another. Just as cheap natural gas is supplanting coal, even cheaper wind or solar eventually will displace gas, they argue.

South Australia is soon to become a proving ground for a project could pave the way for renewable power to supplant fossil fuels for peak electricity - a combined wind farm and grid-scale battery storage facility, by electric-car maker Tesla Inc and operator Windlab Ltd.

Fossil fuel companies need to quickly reorient themselves to the low returns of the solar and wind industries, said Jules Kortenhorst, a former Shell executive who runs the Rocky Mountain Institute, a nonprofit energy research organization.

"You cannot flip a switch on a Monday morning from being one to another," he said. "Paychecks in the oil and gas industry are based on fundamentally believing that the world cannot see economic growth without fossil fuels."

To achieve the same share of the renewables market that the largest publicly-traded oil companies now hold in oil and gas would require an investment of about $350 billion over the next 18 years, estimates consultancy Wood Mackenzie. Such spending would cut into the generous dividends that oil firms' shareholders have come to expect.

"We think it will be a real challenge for these companies to change their business model," said Nathan Fabian, director of policy at Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI), a United Nations-backed group.

PRI has guidelines calling for investment analysis that weighs environmental, social and governance issues. Its principles have been adopted by investors with $70 trillion in assets under management.

SMALL SCALE RENEWABLES INVESTMENTS

Oil companies have made relatively modest investments a wide range of renewable technologies. Chevron has a smattering of mostly small wind and solar ventures; Shell invests in sugar-cane ethanol in South America, wind farms in the United States and electric-car charging stations in Europe; and BP still owns the U.S. wind farms it once tried to sell.

John Browne - who as BP's CEO two decades ago helped launch the early investments in renewables - said he still believes the renewable power will grow.

"It will take time," he said in an interview with Reuters last month. "And they have time."

Shell pledged to invest up to $1 billion a year by 2020 in what it calls "new energies."

Total said this year it would spend $500 million annually on developing alternatives. But soon after that announcement, it unveiled its $7.5 billion acquisition of Maersk Oil, part of a plan to pump more crude from Norway's North Sea.

Total CEO Patrick Pouyanne in October explained the focus on economics at an October oil conference in London.

"When you ask our customers what their priority is, either in developed economies or in emerging countries, price comes first," he said. A hasty shift to renewables, he said, "could bring great economic and social damage to our 6 billion customers."

Exxon Mobil is backing research into biofuels, joining with gene modification firm Synthetic Genomics to coax algae to produce more lipids, an oil substitute. It hasn't detailed its investment but said the effort remains far from commercialization. By comparison, Exxon this year spent $5.6 billion on U.S. shale oil assets.

BATTERY-POWERED CARS, PLANES

Some of the oil industry's largest customers are planning a shift to renewable alternatives, especially in transportation, which accounts for about a quarter of annual energy consumption.

Ford Motor Co earlier this fall disclosed it would aim, by 2030, to derive a third of its sales from battery-powered cars and another third from gas-electric hybrids. [nL4N1ME3GX]

A startup backed by Boeing Co and JetBlue Airways Corp recently announced plans for a small hybrid jet by 2022, using batteries from Tesla and battery supplier Panasonic Corp <6752.T>. [nL2N1MG1HZ]

Yet oil firms continue to forecast aggressive growth in liquid fuels. Exxon predicts 90 percent of the transportation industry will rely on petroleum through 2040.

BP projects the world's auto fleet doubling to 1.8 billion vehicles by 2035, with only 75 million of those powered by electricity.

"We'll see if (electric cars) can be delivered in a way that doesn't require large subsidies" from governments, Chevron's Watson told Reuters. "That's what we're seeing now."

REFILE-Continental European, UK car sales go separate ways - Reuters News

{{20171106T105843.741+0000}}REFILE-Continental European, UK car sales go separate ways(change of coding, no change to text)

PARIS, Nov 6 (Reuters) - Western European car registrations rose 4.6 percent in October as surging demand for new vehicles in France and southern Europe more than made up for a sharp UK sales decline, according to industry data compiled by LMC automotive.

Registrations rose to 1.095 million cars from 1.047 million a year earlier, the consulting firm said on Monday. Its numbers are based on a combination of published national data and estimates for some smaller markets that have yet to report.

The seasonally adjusted annualised rate (SAAR) of Western European sales declined 0.9 percent from September levels to 14.036 million cars, LMC said.

"France, Spain and Italy have seen significant gains amid strong economic fundamentals in the eurozone, while low consumer and business confidence in the UK has resulted in another month of disappointing sales," LMC analyst David Oakley said.

Registrations rose 13.7 percent in France and Spain and 7.1 percent in Italy, according to data published in recent days. But UK car sales plunged 12.2 percent, the country's SMMT industry group reported on Monday, amid uncertainties over Brexit as well as government policy on diesels. [nEONHB10SH]

Sales in Germany, the region's biggest market, rose 3.9 percent in October from already high 2016 levels. Western European sales are up 2.9 percent for the year so far, LMC said.

UK new car registrations plunge 12.2 pct in October - SMMT - Reuters News

{{20171106T091159.628+0000}}UK new car registrations plunge 12.2 pct in October - SMMTLONDON, Nov 6 (Reuters) - British new car registrations fell 12.2 percent in October as demand fell across all parts of the market, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said on Monday.

Sales totalled 158,192, leaving registrations in the year to date down 4.6 percent compared with 2016.

"Declining business and consumer confidence is undoubtedly affecting demand in the new car market but this is being compounded by confusion over government policy on diesel," said SMMT chief executive Mike Hawes.

UK car sales in October down for seventh consecutive month - Reuters News

{{20171106T053000.522+0000}}UK car sales in October down for seventh consecutive monthLONDON, Nov 6 (Reuters) - British new car sales in October fell by about 12 percent year on year, marking a seventh consecutive month of decline, preliminary data released by an industry body showed on Monday.

Sales were hurt by a decline in business and consumer confidence, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said.

Demand for diesel cars slumped by about 30 percent, the industry body said.

The SMMT urged the government to use this month's autumn budget to restore stability to the market and encourage the purchase of the latest low emission vehicles.

UPDATE 1-Carmakers plan 400 Europe car charging stations by 2020 - Reuters News

{{20171103T102654.472+0000}}UPDATE 1-Carmakers plan 400 Europe car charging stations by 2020* To open 20 stations to the public this year

* To expand to 100 stations in 2018

* Electric cars and chargers: http://tmsnrt.rs/2jmqNcC

(Recasts, adds context, details)

FRANKFURT, Nov 3 (Reuters) - A group of mainly German carmakers will open ultra-fast electric vehicle charging stations this year and plans a pan-European network of 400 by 2020, hoping to narrow Tesla's lead.

News about the initiative, first flagged a year ago, had been long anticipated as governments push for improvements in infrastructure that would encourage drivers to switch to electric cars. [nL1N1DU18Q]

IONITY, a joint venture of BMW AG , Daimler AG , Ford Motor Co and Volkswagen with its Audi and Porsche brands, plans to open 20 stations to the public this year in Germany, Norway and Austria. They will be 120 km (75 miles) apart and run in partnership with Tank & Rast [LINDOTA.UL], Circle K and OMV .

"The first pan-European HPC network plays an essential role in establishing a market for electric vehicles," IONITY's CEO Michael Hajesch said on Friday. He added that the fast-charging stations would also offer digital-payment capability.

IONITY is still in talks with charging station suppliers and a decision is expected soon, a spokeswoman said, declining to say how much the joint venture would invest.

Installing thousands of High-Power Charging (HPC) stations across the globe will require billions of dollars in investment and offer an opportunity to manufacturers. The car consortium's new fast chargers will cost about 200,000 euros ($233,000) each, sources said previously. [nL5N1EZ1OG]

Companies ranging from engineering conglomerates such as Siemens to small specialists like ChargePoint are all hoping for a slice of the pie. [nL8N1LF39T]

IONITY will expand its network to 100 stations in 2018, each one enabling several drivers of different car brands to charge their vehicles at the same time.

Anxiety over whether battery-powered cars have the range to reach their destination is inhibiting some drivers from switching from petrol or diesel models.

But with U.S. all-electric challenger Tesla stealing a lead, established brands are teaming up to ensure that electric vehicles (EVs) can get quickly back on the road.

Each charging point will have a capacity of 350 kW, and will use an existing European standard, the Combined Charging System, to reduce charging times compared to existing systems.

A half-hour charge will give a Tesla driver about 270 km in extra driving range - roughly half the time it would take to get a similar boost at a 50 kW charge point that is now the industry standard. ($1 = 0.8587 euros)

Carmakers launch pan-European charging network - Reuters News

{{20171103T070001.503+0000}}Carmakers launch pan-European charging networkFRANKFURT, Nov 3 (Reuters) - A group of mainly German car makers said on Friday it had formed a joint venture to build out a pan-European network of 400 fast charging stations for electric vehicles by the year 2020.

The venture, called IONITY, is backed by BMW AG , Daimler AG , Ford Motor Co and Volkswagen with its Audi and Porsche brands, the companies said in a statement.

Anxiety over whether battery-powered cars have the range to reach their destination is inhibiting some drivers from switching from traditional petrol- or diesel-powered models.

But with U.S. all-electric challenger Tesla stealing a lead, established brands are teaming up to ensure that electric vehicles (EVs) can get quickly back on the road after hooking up to a High-Power Charging (HPC) station.

"The first pan-European HPC network plays an essential role in establishing a market for electric vehicles," IONITY's CEO Michael Hajesch said. He added that the fast-charging stations would also offer digital-payment capability.

IONITY, to be headquartered in Munich, will open its first 20 charging stations to the public this year in Germany, Norway and Austria. These would be 120 km (75 miles) apart, and run in partnership with Tank & Rast, Circle K and OMV .

The network will be expanded to 100 stations in 2018, each one enabling several drivers of different car brands to charge their vehicles at the same time.

Each charging point will have a capacity of 350 kW, and will use the an existing European standard, the Combined Charging System, to reduce charging times compared to existing systems. The system is not tied to brands, which should make EVs more appealing to drivers, IONITY said.

{{20171103T020112.755+0000}}Australia new vehicle sales rebound in Oct - industrySYDNEY, Nov 3 (Reuters) - Australian new vehicle sales rebounded in October as demand in the commercial sector remained red hot, auguring well for business spending in the economy.

The Australian Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries' VFACTS report out on Friday showed 95,763 new vehicles were sold in October, up 2.6 percent on the same month last year. Both months had the same number of selling days.

That was a record for an October month and left sales for the year to date running 0.5 percent ahead of the same period in 2016.

Demand for commercial vehicles showed no signs of waning with the light sector up a hefty 18.5 percent and heavy vehicles jumping 13.7 percent on October last year.

Sales of passenger cars extended their long decline with a fall of 3.8 percent in October, while sports utilities bounced 1.2 percent after a rare decline the previous month.

Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T> retained first place on the sales ladder with an expanded share 18.6 percent of the market, while Hyundai Motor <005380.KS> had a strong month to grab 9.2 percent.

Mazda Motor Corp <7261.T> held third spot with 8.4 percent, followed by the Holden unit of General Motors on 8.1 percent. Ford took 6.0 percent, followed by Mitsubishi <7211.T> at 5.8 percent.

U.S. probe into UAW training center funds extends to GM, Ford - Reuters News

{{20171102T210519.049+0000}}U.S. probe into UAW training center funds extends to GM, FordBy David Shepardson

WASHINGTON, Nov 2 (Reuters) - General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co confirmed Thursday they are cooperating with an expanded Justice Department probe into alleged misspending at United Auto Workers union training centers funded by U.S. automakers.

The investigation became public in July, when federal prosecutors accused a former Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV vice president of making $1.2 million in improper payments to a former union vice president and his wife. Four people have been charged in the Fiat Chrysler probe. [nL2N1L41OB]

The Detroit News reported on Thursday that prosecutors issued subpoenas about training centers financed by GM and Ford and said investigators are looking at charities operated by senior union officials at the companies.

"We are cooperating with the inquiry," Ford spokeswoman Kelli Felker said.

General Motors is conducting an internal investigation into the matter. "We are fully cooperating with the investigation," GM spokesman Pat Morrissey said.

The National Training Center (NTC) is a separate entity from the UAW that receives no union dues, but the alleged abuses "dishonored the union and the values we have upheld for more than 80 years," the union said in July.

Ford added that it is "confident in the UAW-Ford National Programs Center leadership team."

The investigation into union leaders and executives at Fiat Chrysler has resulted in charges against the company's former vice president of employee relations, Alphons Iacobelli. He was charged with making $1.2 million in improper payments to a former union vice president and his wife. Iacobelli has pleaded not guilty.

The government also charged that Jerome Durden, a former Fiat Chrysler official, conspired to divert over $4.5 million in training center funds intended to pay for training for union members. Durden pleaded guilty on Aug. 8 to conspiracy and preparing false tax returns and faces up to 37 months in prison under a plea deal.

Virdell King, 65, of Detroit, a former UAW official responsible for negotiating the contract between Fiat Chrysler and the union, pleaded guilty in August to violating labor law.

The head of the Detroit FBI, David Gelios, has said "years of fraud and corruption within a select group of the FCA and UAW hierarchy continue to be eroded through the diligence and collaboration of law enforcement."

Fiat Chrysler Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne in a statement said the "deplorable" conduct "had nothing whatsoever to do with the collective bargaining process" and the "egregious acts were neither known to nor sanctioned by (Fiat Chrysler)."

UPDATE 3-AutoNation announces Waymo fleet repair deal, shares jump - Reuters News

{{20171102T145558.253+0000}}UPDATE 3-AutoNation announces Waymo fleet repair deal, shares jump(Recasts lead, adds CEO commentary, updates stock trading, adds details)

By Nick Carey and Ankit Ajmera

Nov 2 (Reuters) - U.S. auto retailer AutoNation Inc announced a multi-year partnership on Thursday to support Alphabet Inc's Waymo self-driving car unit, including vehicle maintenance and repairs as the company adds new brands into its fleet, sending its shares up 13 percent to a high for the year.

That news was accompanied by a better-than expected third-quarter profit as AutoNation performed well despite the impact of hurricanes during the quarter.

There is fierce competition between large automakers to bring self-driving cars to market first. The pact between Waymo and Ft. Lauderdale, Florida-based AutoNation is the latest in a series of recent partnerships the self-driving unit has formed.

Fully self-driving vehicles are expected to hit the market in a limited form by around 2020, in vehicle fleets rather than owned by individuals until the price of the technology involved becomes more affordable for consumers.

General Motors Co and rival Ford Motor Co have both said they aim to sell fully self-driving cars by 2021.

AutoNation said its stores will maintain and repair Waymo's self-driving Chrysler Pacifica hybrid vehicle fleet, plus additional brands as Waymo expands. [nPnP0HZ0a]

"The ambition is to grow with Waymo," AutoNation Chief Executive Mike Jackson told Reuters. "The only way to get a return on a truly autonomous system is on a shared vehicle, where there is an extended life cycle."

That requires service through the manufacturer's warranty period and beyond, Jackson said.

Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV is part of an alliance with Waymo to develop self-driving cars based on a test fleet of Chrysler Pacifica hybrid minivans in Phoenix, Arizona.

In June, Waymo signed a multi-year agreement with Avis Budget Group Inc for the car rental firm to manage its growing autonomous vehicle fleet. [nL1N1JN1E4]

Jackson said he was open to acquisitions, but not necessarily of new car dealerships.

"We are focused on building our USA" used-vehicle stores, he said. "We are expanding our collision business."

Profit in the quarter was better than expected, as the impact of recent storms wasn't as bad as feared. The company said Hurricane Irma negatively impacted its aftertax earnings by 8 cents per share.

Net income from continuing operations fell to $97.6 million or $1.00 per share in the quarter ended Sept. 30, from $107.8 million or $1.05 per share, a year earlier. [nPn3cT5Bla]

Total revenue fell 2.4 percent to $5.43 billion.

Analysts on average had expected third-quarter profit of 84 cents per share on revenue of $5.58 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

In morning trading, AutoNation shares were up 13 percent at $53.81.

UPDATE 4-Trucks, SUVs drive U.S. October new vehicle sales - Reuters News

{{20171101T201101.092+0000}}UPDATE 4-Trucks, SUVs drive U.S. October new vehicle sales(Adds industry wide seasonal sales rate for October)

By Nick Carey

DETROIT, Nov 1 (Reuters) - Major automakers posted mixed U.S. new vehicle sales in October on Wednesday, though America's love affair with high-margin pickup trucks and SUVs remained in full bloom as larger, pricier vehicles fared better than passenger cars.

Auto industry publication WardsAuto put the seasonally-adjusted annualized rate (SAAR) for light vehicle sales in October at a robust level of 18 million units.

But after a long boom cycle, carmakers are still ill-prepared for the slight decline in sales anticipated for full-year 2017 and have taken too few steps to trim production, said Doug Mehl, a partner in consultancy A.T. Kearney's automotive practice.

"When you make a new vehicle you have volume assumptions tagged to it and who wants to be the guy who says 'I'm going to make less of this really cool model'?" Mehl said. "But eventually the market is the reality and it's going to force companies one way or other here."

General Motors Co reported a sales drop of 2.2 percent for the month, with consumer sales down 6.6 percent. Sales of high-margin pickup trucks, sport utility vehicles and crossovers all rose.

GM also cut its inventory of unsold vehicles - a source of concern for the market - slightly. The automaker has worked to reduce its volume of excess inventory, including through significant production shutdowns in the third quarter. GM had said its inventory would rise in October.

"We are heading into the fourth quarter with good momentum, thanks to a strong U.S. economy and very strong pickup and crossover sales," said Kurt McNeil, GM vice president for U.S. sales operations.

GM slightly reduced consumer discounts as a percentage of average transaction prices to 13.5 percent, from 13.7 percent in the third quarter.

Industry experts believe consumer discounts above 10 percent of the average transaction price are unhealthy as they erode resale values and are unsustainable in the long term.

Consultants J.D. Power and LMC said last week that based on preliminary October sales numbers, discounts have exceeded 10 percent in 15 of the last 16 months.

SOME UP, SOME DOWN

The U.S. auto industry posted record sales of 17.55 million vehicles in 2016. New sales received a strong boost in September as consumers replaced vehicles damaged in southeast Texas by Hurricane Harvey the previous month. [nL2N1ME0SD]

Full-year 2017 sales are expected to be slightly lower than 2016.

Ford Motor Co said vehicle sales rose 6.2 percent in October, driven largely by a 15.9 percent jump for its high-priced F-Series pickup trucks. Strong demand pushed the average price tag for an F-Series truck up $4,000 from the previous October to $47,300.

High-margin pickup trucks were a dominant factor in Ford's solid third-quarter results. [nL2N1N10HB]

Mark LaNeve, Ford's U.S. sales chief, said the upgraded F-Series line "really has been a spectacular success," adding the market would remain "competitive" into 2018.

Ford's low-margin fleet sales rose 14.6 percent in October.

Toyota Motor Corp's <7203.T> sales rose 5.2 percent in October as strong pickup truck and SUV sales offset a 12.7 percent drop in sedans and a 27.9 percent slide in luxury Lexus sedans.

Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCA) reported a 13 percent sales decline. Consumer sales were down 4 percent, while fleet sales tumbled 43 percent, in line with the company's strategy to reduce low-margin sales to car rental agencies.

FCA has pushed to sell more profitable SUVs and pickup trucks, which helped lift its North American profit margin to 8 percent in the third quarter. [nL8N1MZ44E]

Nissan Motor Co Ltd's <7201.T> U.S. October sales increased 8.4 percent, helped by a 12.9 percent jump in pickups, SUV and crossover sales.

But sales at Nissan's luxury Infiniti brand fell 8.1 percent, as luxury models dropped 16.2 percent.

Nissan's U.S. sales chief, Judy Wheeler, said the last two months of the year will be marked by fierce competition.

"Everyone gets extremely aggressive as we get into these last two months of the year ... and everyone will be trying to out-shout each other," she said. "So I think it's a question of how do we separate ourselves" from the crowd.

Honda Motor Co Ltd <7267.T> bucked the trend as a 6.3 percent increase in passenger cars offset a 3.9 percent decline in SUV sales for an overall increase of nearly 1 percent.

GM shares were down 0.2 percent at $42.91 on Wednesday afternoon while Ford shares rose 0.7 percent to $12.35. Fiat Chrysler increased 1.4 percent to $17.60 in U.S. trading.

Luxury auto brands are scrambling to avoid a Blue U.S. Christmas - Reuters News

{{20171101T193642.833+0000}}Luxury auto brands are scrambling to avoid a Blue U.S. ChristmasBy Nick Carey

DETROIT, Nov 1 (Reuters) - When financial markets surge to new records, sales of luxury cars usually rise, too. Instead, October U.S. auto sales reports on Wednesday showed that a collapse in sales of luxury sedans is accelerating.

Consumers have gradually shifted over to luxury sport utility vehicles from sedans in the last decade, but the trend - which has occurred in both the non-luxury and luxury segments of the auto market - was particularly pronounced in October.

Sales of Daimler AG's Mercedes-Benz S-Class, long a global benchmark for large, premium sedans, plunged 49 percent in October, and are down 24.8 percent for the year to date. General Motors Co's Cadillac brand said it sold just 779 of its CTS sedans in October. Demand for that car, designed to compete with German luxury sedans, is down nearly 33 percent for the year.

Cadillac's best-selling model this year is the XT5 compact SUV, which has more than doubled sales from a year ago.

The shift within the luxury vehicle market away from sedans toward SUVs of all sizes is forcing some of the most prestigious brands to scramble to add SUV models to their lineups or boost SUV production to meet demand.

"In the short term, there will be pressure to add (consumer) incentives, cut production or both," said Cox Automotive analyst Michelle Krebs. "And we just don't see an end in sight to this trend."

The Dow Jones Industrial Average <.DJI> has been trading at all-time highs [.N], usually a good sign for luxury sedans, but as major automakers reported new U.S. vehicle sales for October on Wednesday [nL2N1N718J], sales for passenger cars continued their slide while luxury SUV and crossover sales rose again. (http://tmsnrt.rs/2inGn3Y)

According to Kelley Blue Book data, in 2007 luxury sedans made up 7.6 percent of U.S. new vehicle sales, while luxury SUVs made up 4.2 percent. Through September this year, luxury SUVs made up just over 7 percent of the market, compared with 4.9 percent for luxury sedans.

In the short term, luxury brands could use holiday season sales promotions to clear slow-selling sedans off dealer lots, analysts said. Toyota Motor Corp's <7203.T> Lexus brand said on Wednesday it will launch its "December to Remember" year-end sales promotion for the 18th straight year.

HIGH-MARGIN VEHICLES

Longer-term, luxury car makers have to restructure their model lineups, which have for decades reflected conventional thinking that the "flagship" of a luxury vehicle brand is a big sedan.

Industry executives and analysts said luxury brands will launch more SUVs. BMW AG and Mercedes-Benz are both expanding their U.S. sport utility vehicle plants.

Some luxury sedans will disappear from lineups, but not all. Lexus, for instance, is launching a redesigned version of its flagship LS sedan in the United States in 2018, starting at around $75,000.

Established luxury car brands must reckon with the impact of Tesla Inc's electric vehicles, which have redefined the boundaries for advanced technology.

Offering a little more horsepower is not enough to draw in many customers, said Scott Keogh, head of Audi's U.S. operations. "There really isn't a new stimulus" for owners of current models to trade in their vehicles, he said.

"Audi buyers ... want the latest and greatest," he said. That is one reason why the brand, owned by Volkswagen AG , plans to launch an electric sport utility in the United States by 2019.

Sam Fiorani, vice president of AutoForecast Solutions, said automakers are keen to encourage eager consumers to buy luxury SUVs and crossovers as those models face less stringent fuel regulations and are far more profitable than sedans.

"There's still a significant portion of the market that wants a car," Fiorani said, "but I'm sure there were people who preferred a horse to a car at one point."

Randy Parker, U.S. head of Nissan Motor Co Ltd's <7201.T> luxury Infiniti brand, said much depends on the U.S. economy and gasoline prices, but luxury brands "with a really robust SUV and crossover portfolio will ... win in the next few years."

As investment dollars shift to SUV models, poor performers among luxury sedans will "fall by the wayside" said Bill Rinna, senior manager for North American forecasts at consultancy LMC Automotive.

"Are some of your stalwarts going away?" he said. "I don't believe so."

UPDATE 2-Trucks drive Canadian auto sales growth in October - Reuters News

{{20171101T191809.300+0000}}UPDATE 2-Trucks drive Canadian auto sales growth in October(Rewrites throughout with GAC report details, analyst quote)

Nov 1 (Reuters) - Canadian auto sales rose 6.3 percent in October, according to industry data released on Wednesday, with light trucks continuing to be the bestseller in the country.

About 164,214 vehicles were sold in the month, bringing the total to 1.76 million so far this year, a report published by Global Automakers of Canada (GAC) showed.

Sales of light truck sales, which accounted for about 70 percent of total sales, increased 13.6 percent in the month, while passenger car sales dropped nearly 8 percent.

"As Canadian vehicle sales continue to climb to record highs, much of the growth has recently shifted to leasing, prompting a moderation in auto loan growth," Scotiabank's auto industry specialist Carlos Gomes said.

Auto loans to more creditworthy clients continue to gain momentum, signaling an improvement in the credit profile of Canadians, Gomes said.

Auto sales typically track macro indicators such as employment and economic growth. Canada's economy posted the fastest growth of the Group of Seven major economies in the first half of 2017.

General Motors Co's vehicle sales in Canada rose 26.5 percent to 26,847, while rival Ford Motor Co posted a decline of 2 percent.

Demand for Chevrolet brand drove GM's numbers, while Ford said the 21,081 automobiles sold in the month were largely F-Series trucks.

Fiat Chrysler Automobiles , maker of Dodge and Chrysler vehicles, said sales slumped 12 percent to 17,211, but was still the third best selling automaker.

UPDATE 1-UK car execs tell prime minister they need clarity on Brexit transition - Reuters News

{{20171101T191759.841+0000}}UPDATE 1-UK car execs tell prime minister they need clarity on Brexit transition(Adds details, quotes,)

By Costas Pitas

LONDON, Nov 1 (Reuters) - British car executives told British Prime Minister Theresa May on Wednesday that there was an urgent need for clarity on the proposed transition period after Britain leaves the European Union.

The automotive industry has been heralded as a manufacturing success story by the government, with production reaching a 17-year high in 2016 and the sector employing over 800,000 people.

But the overwhelmingly foreign-owned industry, dominated by Indian's Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) and Japan's Nissan <7201.T>, is worried Brexit will add tariffs and customs checks to its exports, risking the viability of plants.

BMW's board member for sales Ian Robertson, Aston Martin Chief Financial Officer Mark Wilson, JLR Chief Executive Ralf Speth, McLaren Auomotive Chief Executive Mike Flewitt and Bentley boss Wolfgang Duerheimer were among those invited to meet May at her office on Wednesday.

"The meeting focused on our members' Brexit priorities - in particular, the urgent need for clarity on the proposed transition agreement as business needs certainty to invest," the trade body, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, said in a statement.

Executives highlighted the importance of frictionless future customs arrangements, the need to maintain a common certification system with the European Union and access to European labour, a source present in the room told Reuters.

The source said May and business minister Greg Clark did not offer guarantees but were aware of the issues at hand.

"They can't make commitments because the negotiations aren't done," the source said when asked about what May said. "They understood and recognise it."

At least one executive also said they had an upcoming investment decision to make, the source said.

A spokesman at May's office said May and Clark repeated assurances that they would seek the best deal possible for the sector.

"The prime minister and the business secretary reiterated the government's aim for an ambitious economic partnership with the EU, as well as an implementation period that ensures businesses only have to adapt to one set of changes," he said.

Low prices, bad weather seen curbing U.S. Plains wheat seeding - Reuters News

{{20171101T185954.960+0000}}Low prices, bad weather seen curbing U.S. Plains wheat seedingBy Julie Ingwersen

CHICAGO, Nov 1 (Reuters) - U.S. winter wheat acreage for harvest in 2018 could shrink further from 2017's 108-year low as poor returns deterred farmers from planting the crop this autumn and excessive rains disrupted the plans of those that did.

While the world is awash in wheat, U.S. production fell to a 15-year low in 2017 and the high-quality wheat grown in parts of the country remains vulnerable to shortages. A drought this year in key growing areas sent spring wheat futures soaring.

Gary Millershaski, who farms in west-central Kansas, is cutting the percentage of his acres devoted to wheat, even though he has added more land.

"There's just not the money in it," Millershaski said. "Years ago, we used to be straight 50 percent wheat," he said, adding that wheat only makes up 38 to 40 percent of his current acreage.

Kansas is the biggest wheat producer of all the states but its winter wheat acres could fall as much as 10 percent from a year ago, said Justin Gilpin, chief executive officer of the Kansas Wheat Commission.

Oklahoma, the No. 3 winter wheat producer this year, could see a similar reduction, said Kim Anderson, an agricultural economist at Oklahoma State University.

"The one thing that would be a welcome surprise is if we had no drop. Generally the consensus is we will have some amount of lower wheat seeding," said Dan O'Brien, a Kansas State University agricultural economist.

In central Kansas, cash prices for wheat are $3.20 to $3.40 per bushel - below the cost of production for some growers, O'Brien said, as plentiful global supplies eat into U.S. exports and keep overall prices under pressure.

Many farmers in the Plains have shifted acres to more profitable crops such as corn, soybeans and cotton, and that trend is likely to continue in 2018, the economists said.

In Kansas, farmers planted 5.5 million acres (2.2 million hectares) of corn in 2017, the most since the 1930s, and a record-high 5.15 million acres of soybeans. Wheat plantings fell to 7.6 million acres, the second lowest acreage in U.S. Department of Agriculture records dating back to 1919.

On top of the poor economics, farmers have had to contend with heavy rains that left fields too muddy to use the heavy equipment used to plant wheat and harvest corn and soy. For farmers who plant wheat directly after harvest, known as "double-cropping", that has been a double blow.

"With corn harvest delayed, (we are) not going to see as much double-crop behind corn, Gilpin said.

Wheat planting in Kansas as of Oct. 22 was the slowest on record, according to the USDA. By Oct. 29, the crop was 84 percent planted - still behind the five-year average of 93 percent. [US/WHE]

For Millershaski, the heavy rains pushed back planting by about three weeks, until mid-October. Then, worried the wheat would not have time to develop enough before winter, he planted about 60 to 65 pounds (27-30 kg) of seed per acre, compared with his normal rate of about 35 pounds.

"That doubled our seed costs per acre pretty quick," he said.

CORRECTED-UPDATE 1-Trucks, SUVs dominate in mixed U.S. October vehicle sales - Reuters News

{{20171101T154145.658+0000}}CORRECTED-UPDATE 1-Trucks, SUVs dominate in mixed U.S. October vehicle sales(In paragraph 16, corrects Fiat Chrysler third-quarter North American profit margin to 8 percent from 8.3 percent)

By Nick Carey

DETROIT, Nov 1 (Reuters) - Major automakers posted mixed U.S. new vehicle sales in October on Wednesday, though America's love affair with high-margin pickup trucks and SUVs still bloomed as larger, pricier vehicles continued to fare better than passenger cars.

General Motors Co reported an overall sales drop of 2.2 percent for the month, with consumer sales down 6.6 percent. High-margin pickup truck, SUV and crossover sales were all up at the largest U.S. automaker.

GM reduced its inventory of unsold vehicles in the month by 7,000 vehicles to 813,000. The automaker has been whittling away at its large volume of unsold vehicles, a source of concern for the market. GM had advised that its inventory would rise in October.

"We are heading into the fourth quarter with good momentum, thanks to a strong U.S. economy and very strong pickup and crossover sales," GM's vice president for U.S. sales operations, Kurt McNeil, said in a statement.

GM slightly reduced consumer discounts as a percentage of the average transaction price, to 13.5 percent from 13.7 percent in the third quarter.

Industry experts believe consumer discounts in excess of 10 percent of the average transaction price are unhealthy for the market as they erode resale values and are unsustainable in the long term.

Industry consultants J.D. Power and LMC said last week that based on preliminary sales numbers including October, discounts have exceeded 10 percent in 15 of the last 16 months.

The U.S. auto industry is coming off a strong run that culminated in record sales of 17.55 million units in 2016. New sales got a strong lift in September as consumers replaced vehicles damaged in southeast Texas by Hurricane Harvey the previous month. [nL2N1ME0SD]

Full-year 2017 sales are still expected to be down slightly versus 2016.

Ford Motor Co posted a 6.2 percent gain in vehicle sales in October, driven largely by a 15.9 percent jump in sales of its popular, high-priced F-Series line of pickups. Strong demand pushed the average price tag for an F-Series truck up $4,000 from the previous October to $47,300.

High-margin pickup trucks were a dominant factor in the better-than-expected results Ford posted last week. [nL2N1N10HB]

On a conference call, Ford's U.S. sales chief, Mark LaNeve, said the upgraded F-Series line "really has been a spectacular success" and said the market would remain "competitive" through the end of 2017 and into 2018.

Ford's low-margin fleet sales rose 14.6 percent in October.

Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T> said its sales rose 5.2 percent in October, as strong pickup truck and SUV sales offset a 12.7 drop in Toyota sedans and a 27.9 percent decrease in luxury Lexus sedans.

Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCA) reported a 13 percent sales decline. The automaker's sales to consumers were down 4 percent, while fleet sales slid 43 percent, in line with the company's strategy to reduce low-margin sales to car rental agencies.

FCA has pushed to sell more profitable SUVs and pickup trucks, which helped lift its North American profit margin to 8 percent in the third quarter. [nL8N1MZ44E]

Nissan Motor Co Ltd's <7201.T> sales increased 8.4 percent for the month, driven by a 12.9 percent jump in pickups, SUV and crossover sales. Sales of its popular Rogue crossover model soared 43 percent in October.

But sales at Nissan's luxury Infiniti brand fell 8.1 percent, driven largely by a 16.2 percent drop in luxury sedan sales.

GM shares were up 0.5 percent at $43.21 while Ford rose more than 1.3 percent to $12.43 and Fiat Chrysler rose 1.7 percent to $17.64 in U.S. trading.

DETROIT, Nov 1 (Reuters) - Major automakers posted mixed U.S. new vehicle sales in October on Wednesday, though America's love affair with high-margin pickup trucks and SUVs was unrelenting as passenger cars continued to be abandoned for larger, more comfortable vehicles.

General Motors Co reported an overall sales drop of 2.2 percent for the month, with consumer sales down 6.6 percent. High-margin pickup truck, SUV and crossover sales were all up at the largest U.S. automaker.

Renesas to provide chips for Toyota's self-driving cars - Reuters News

{{20171031T165021.738+0000}}Renesas to provide chips for Toyota's self-driving carsBy Nick Carey

DETROIT, Oct 31 (Reuters) - Renesas Electronics Corp <6723.T> said on Tuesday it will provide semiconductors for self-driving cars that Japanese automaker Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T> plans to bring to market in 2020.

Automakers are racing to be the first to market with commercially viable self-driving vehicles.

Renesas said it will provide a chip to Toyota - the R-Car system-on-chip - that will serve as an "electronic brain" or as advanced driver-assistance systems. The company will provide a separate chip for automotive control.

The first chip will provide "highly accurate intelligence on the vehicle's position within its environment" and will also make "real-time decisions on vehicle control and active safety maneuvers based on sensor data," Renesas said.

The second chip, called RH850, will "control driving, steering, and braking functions based on the judgments" made by the R-Car system-on-chip.

Fully self-driving vehicles are expected to hit the market in a limited form by around 2020. U.S. automakers General Motors Co and rival Ford Motor Co have both publicly stated that they aim to have fully self-driving cars on sale by 2021.

Renesas' chips will be used with an engine control unit that will be provided by Denso Corp <6902.T>, Toyota's largest supplier.

"We are partnering with Denso and Renesas, who bring superior technology and expertise to this project, with the aim to accelerate the development of autonomous-driving vehicles and encourage early adoption," Ken Koibuchi, Executive General Manager at Toyota Motor Corporation, said in a statement.
