July 31 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co Chief Executive Jim Hackett is reviewing the automaker's operations in India and other markets, as well as Ford's future product programs including plans to build a self-driving commercial vehicle in 2021, according to company officials and other sources familiar with that review.

Hackett, who took over as CEO in May, has told investors he is working on a 100-day review of Ford's operations but has so far provided few details of the process, except to indicate that it is looking at the automakers' luxury vehicle strategy, the future of its small vehicles and investments in emerging markets.

Ford Chief Financial Officer Bob Shanks told Reuters in an interview that the review covers a range of issues, including Ford's strategy for India.

"We have a lot of work to do (as) we address issues of how to fix India," Shanks said. "Everything is on the table."

General Motors Co in May said it would stop selling cars in India but continue to produce vehicles there for export. [nL4N1IK1ZS] Shanks said no decisions have been made and noted that Ford has a larger business in India than GM did. "We are very cognizant that will be the third-largest market in the world," he said.

"Some big decisions will be made," Shanks said, but he cautioned Ford may not disclose all those decisions at the end of the 100-day review.

Hackett is addressing challenges that have contributed to a nearly 8 percent decline in Ford's share price this year.

The review of the Lincoln luxury brand includes whether current plans will meet former CEO Mark Fields' ambitious targets for growth and revenue, people familiar with the process said.

Ford has set a target of putting a self-driving shuttle into commercial ride-sharing fleets by 2021. Hackett is reviewing the investment and timing for that project, the sources said.

Hackett also assessing whether to reduce and consolidate production of models such as the Fiesta subcompact and two midsized sedans that are built in multiple locations around the world, but are experiencing slowing demand.

One proposal would shift production of the next-generation Mondeo mid-sized sedan from Europe to Mexico, where it would share an assembly line with its sibling, the Ford Fusion, avoiding the cost of retooling two plants.

Shortly after he took charge, Hackett approved a proposal to shift production of the next-generation Focus for North America from Mexico to China, saving the company an estimated $500 million by consolidating two factories into one.

Hackett also is said to be questioning a plan to build at least half a dozen future models, including replacements for the Ford Mustang and Explorer and Lincoln Continental, on a new flexible platform that is designed to accommodate both front- and rear-wheel-drive vehicles.

UPDATE 1-Ford to repair U.S. police vehicles after carbon monoxide concerns - Reuters News

{{20170729T014912.339+0000}}UPDATE 1-Ford to repair U.S. police vehicles after carbon monoxide concerns(Adds details on investigation by federal regulator, details from Ford statement)

By David Shepardson

WASHINGTON, July 28 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co said Friday it will pay to repair police versions of its Ford Explorer SUVs to correct possible carbon monoxide leaks that may be linked to crashes and injuries after U.S. regulators escalated an investigation into 1.33 million vehicles.

Ford said it will cover the costs of specific repairs in every Police Interceptor Explorer SUVs that may be tied to after-market installation of police equipment. The company said the modifications may have left holes in the underbody of the vehicles.

"If the holes are not properly sealed, it creates an opening where exhaust could enter the cabin," Ford said in a statement.

Ford acted amid concerns by some police departments about the safety of officers. The city of Austin, Texas said Friday it was removing all 400 of the city's Ford Explorer SUVs from use.

Several Texas media outlets cited a city memo that said 20 police officers have been found with elevated levels of carbon monoxide and three have not returned to work.

Ford said it has not found any elevated levels of carbon monoxide in regular Ford Explorers, but NHTSA is investigating reports of exhaust odors in those vehicles. Ford did not say how much it expected to pay to repair police vehicles and said its investigation is ongoing.

On Thursday, the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said it was upgrading and expanding a probe into 1.33 million Ford Explorer SUVs over reports of exhaust odors in vehicle compartments. [nL1N1KJ023]

Police have reported two crashes that may be linked to carbon monoxide exposure and a third incident involving injuries related to carbon monoxide exposure.

The auto safety agency said it was also aware of more than 2,700 complaints that may be linked to exhaust orders and possible exposure to carbon monoxide and 41 injuries among police and civilian vehicles in the probe covering 2011-2017 model year Ford Explorer sport utility vehicles.

Ford has issued four technical service bulletins related to the exhaust odor issue to address complaints from police fleets and other owners, NHTSA and Ford said.

NHTSA said it is evaluating preliminary testing that suggests carbon monoxide levels may be elevated in certain driving scenarios.

NHTSA said it recently learned that the police version of the Ford Explorer was experiencing exhaust manifold cracks.

The agency said the reported injuries include "loss of consciousness, with the majority indicating nausea, headaches, or light-headedness."

{{20170728T022754.337+0000}}UPDATE 2-U.S. upgrades probe into 1.33 mln Ford Explorers over exhaust odors(Adds background on other incidents, comments from agency)

By David Shepardson

WASHINGTON, July 27 (Reuters) - The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is upgrading and expanding a probe into 1.33 million Ford Explorer SUVs over reports of exhaust odors in vehicle compartments and exposure to carbon monoxide that may be linked to crashes and injuries.

The auto safety agency said in a statement on Thursday it was aware of more than 2,700 complaints and three crashes that may be linked to exposure to carbon monoxide and 41 injuries among police and civilian vehicles in the probe covering 2011-2017 model year Ford Explorer sport utility vehicles.

Ford has issued numerous technical service bulletins related to the exhaust odor issue to address complaints from police fleets and owners, NHTSA said.

Ford did not immediately comment.

The probe was opened in 2016 and upgraded on Thursday to an engineering analysis, a step before the agency can formally demand an automaker conduct a recall if it believes vehicles pose an unreasonable risk to safety.

NHTSA said it "is actively working with law enforcement agencies that use these vehicles to determine if this issue is related to a potential safety defect."

The agency said it had "no substantive data or actual evidence," such as a blood test "supporting a claim that any of the alleged injury or crash allegations were the result of carbon monoxide poisoning."

But NHTSA has obtained preliminary testing that suggests carbon monoxide levels may be elevated in certain driving scenarios, "although the significance and effect of those levels remains under evaluation."

The agency said it was examining vehicles used by the Austin, Texas, police department and "using professional grade detectors to monitors carbon monoxide under different driving scenarios."

KXAN-TV in Austin reported this month that Austin police had pulled 40 Explorers from service and more than a half dozen officers became ill after reporting exposure to carbon monoxide.

NHTSA has conducted field inspections of vehicles and crashes involving police units that occurred while the officers were on duty.

NHTSA also said it recently learned that the Police Interceptor version of the Ford Explorer was experiencing exhaust manifold cracks, "which appear to present a low level of detectability, and may explain the exhaust odor."

The agency said the reported injuries include "loss of consciousness, with the majority indicating nausea, headaches, or light-headedness."

Police have reported two crashes that may be linked to carbon monoxide exposure, including a rollover incident, and a third incident involving injuries related to carbon monoxide exposure.

UPDATE 2-Honda says Florida crash death may be linked to Takata air bag inflator - Reuters News

{{20170727T220449.855+0000}}UPDATE 2-Honda says Florida crash death may be linked to Takata air bag inflator(Adds attempt to reach Takata, NHTSA investigating, Honda comment)

By David Shepardson

July 27 (Reuters) - Honda Motor Co <7267.T> said on Thursday that a Takata airbag inflator ruptured in car crash last week in Florida, in what could be the 19th death worldwide linked to faulty airbags recalled as part of the largest automotive safety campaign in history.

The Japanese automaker said the driver of a 2002 Honda Accord was killed in Holiday, Florida, after the inflator ruptured. An official cause of death has not been announced.

Last week, authorities in Australia said the death of a Sydney man earlier this month was likely the result of a faulty Takata airbag inflator.

At least 18 deaths and 180 injuries worldwide have been tied to the defect that led Takata Corp to file for bankruptcy protection last month. Takata inflators can explode with excessive force, unleashing metal shrapnel inside cars and trucks.

Last week's crash involved a 34-year-old woman who died around 6:40 p.m. on Wednesday in a head-on collision near St. Petersburg when a 19-year-old driving a 1999 Pontiac Firebird turned into her path, according to local media reports.

The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration sent an investigator to Florida.

The inflator in 2002 Accords has been recalled since 2011 and Honda said it had mailed 21 recall notices over several years to registered owners of this vehicle. Ten notices had been sent to the current registered owner, but the repairs were never completed, Honda said.

"This is more evidence that the recall is failing and not enough is being done to find the affected vehicles and fix them," U.S. Senator Bill Nelson of Florida said in a statement.

Honda said it has adequate replacement parts and urged owners "to seek repair as soon as possible," adding that older vehicles, especially 2001-2003 Honda vehicles, pose the greatest safety risk.

Last year, NHTSA urged owners to stop driving about 300,000 2001-2003 Honda vehicles until they were fixed. NHTSA said some 2001-2003 vehicles had as much as a 50 percent chance of a dangerous air bag inflator rupture in a crash.

Of the deaths linked to Takata inflators, 17 involved Honda vehicles since May 2009, including five in Malaysia using a different type Takata inflator. One death occurred in a Ford Motor Co vehicle in South Carolina in December 2015.

Scott Caudill, chief operating officer of TK Holdings, Takata's U.S. unit, has said Takata recalled, or expected to recall, about 125 million vehicles worldwide by 2019, including more than 60 million in the United States.

UK car industry says clarity needed now as Brexit weighs - Reuters News

{{20170726T230101.815+0000}}UK car industry says clarity needed now as Brexit weighsBy William Schomberg

LONDON, July 27 (Reuters) - Britain's car-makers and traders are starting to feel the strains of Brexit, and output this year is likely fall short of the industry's expectations, the head of the leading UK group in the sector said.

Mike Hawes, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, said the government needed to say now what its plans were for the sector when Britain left the European Union in 2019.

The number of cars made in Britain in June slumped by almost 14 percent year on year to 136,901, the SMMT said on Thursday.

That left first half output in a sector that supports more than 800,000 jobs down nearly 3 percent at 866,656 units.

Although that represented the second-highest January-June performance in 12 years and a pick-up was likely later in the year, output in 2017 would probably be closer to 1.8 million units than a previous forecast of 1.9 million, Hawes said.

Britain's car industry has boomed in recent years with global manufacturers investing heavily in the country as a base for selling to the rest of the EU and beyond. More than half of the cars exported from Britain go to the EU.

But last year's decision by voters to leave the bloc has left the industry exposed. The bloc has tariffs of 10 percent on car imports, posing a risk if Britain leaves in under two years' time with no new trade deal in place.

The impact of the referendum on the country's consumers is another problem for car-makers. Households have been pinched by a sharp rise in inflation, caused in large part by the fall in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote.

Cars made for the domestic market were down nearly 10 percent in the first six months of 2017 while exports - which account for nearly 80 percent of output - were roughly stable, SMMT figures showed.

"Undoubtedly, the situation has changed," Hawes said.

The SMMT's long-held target of increasing production to just under 2 million units in 2020 was also in doubt, with changing assumptions about individual company decisions on their models also a factor.

Britain could miss the target by 10 percent if it fails to secure an interim deal with the EU, Hawes said.

The SMMT, like other British industry groups, wants the country to stay in the EU's single market and customs union as it transitions to a future trading relationship with the EU, something the government is ruling out.

"The government has been in listening mode but now it must put on the table the concrete plans that will assure the future competitiveness of the sector," Hawes said.

A fall in investment this year was another sign of Brexit concerns, even if some of the drop had been expected after strong levels in recent years, he said.

The industry also faces the challenge of shifting away from petrol- and diesel-fuelled cars. On Wednesday, the government said it would ban such vehicles from 2040 to promote electric cars. [nL5N1KH21I]

UPDATE 5-Ford results foreshadow tougher times for Detroit automakers - Reuters News

{{20170726T190400.391+0000}}UPDATE 5-Ford results foreshadow tougher times for Detroit automakers(Adds CFO comments)

By Nick Carey and Paul Lienert

DETROIT, July 26 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co on Wednesday joined rival General Motors Co in reporting higher-than-expected second-quarter profits, and in the next breath warning of a rougher ride for the rest of the year.

Ford said full-year pre-tax profit, automotive operating margins and cash flow would be lower than 2016 results, sending the company's shares down 2.1 percent.

Rival GM on Tuesday reported headline profits that beat analysts' estimates, but warned that profits for the second half of the year will likely be lower than the first half, as the company scales back scale back North American production to cut its burgeoning inventories. [nL1N1KG0CT]

Ford and GM's results present a counterpoint to other big U.S. companies reporting strong profits, including heavy equipment maker Caterpillar Inc , aircraft maker Boeing Co and telecommunications power AT&T Inc . [nL3N1KH4VH]

Investors worry that for Detroit's automakers, the second quarter marks a peak and profits are headed downhill. Thousands of workers at GM's U.S. factories are dealing with short- and long-term layoffs as production of slow-selling sedans is throttled back.

Ford's new Chief Executive, Jim Hackett, on Wednesday promised investors a rethink of Ford's spending, marketing and investment strategy within his first 100 days, focusing on the company's approach to emerging markets, small cars and its Lincoln luxury brand.

In the meantime, Ford is contending with sliding sales and rising costs. Ford's global sales fell by 43,000 vehicles in the quarter, and the company Ford said its full-year margin in North America, its most profitable market, would be lower than in 2016 due to $1.2 billion in additional commodity costs, costlier price cuts and engineering expenses.

Ford Chief Financial Officer Bob Shanks told Reuters on Wednesday the company would be concerned if the United States imposed new tariffs on imported steel, as the Trump Administration is considering. "It would give producers here the opportunity to raise prices," he said.

Ford reported second-quarter net income of $2.04 billion, or 51 cents per share, up from nearly $2 billion, or 49 cents per share, a year earlier. A big contributor was a lower tax rate of 15 percent, half the level analysts had expected.

Excluding one-time items, Ford earned 56 cents a share, and on that basis analysts, on average, looked for 43 cents.

It forecast full-year adjusted earnings per share in a range from $1.65 to $1.85, above the $1.51 expected by Wall Street, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. However, the company has already booked 96 cents a share in adjusted profit - more than half its full-year target. GM has also generated more than half its full year target of $6 to $6.50 a share.

BREAKINGVIEWS-New Ford boss leaves shareholders stuck in traffic - Reuters Breakingviews

{{20170726T144807.481+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-New Ford boss leaves shareholders stuck in traffic(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.)

By Antony Currie

NEW YORK, July 26 (Reuters Breakingviews) - The first earnings report after taking office usually offers a new boss the perfect excuse for ditching the predecessor's financial targets with near impunity. Ford Chief Executive Jim Hackett, though, decided against using his 65th day running the Glass House to carry out such a kitchen-sinking. He instead chose to leave the carmakers' shareholders stuck in traffic.

For starters, only a whopping tax break allowed the company to handily beat second-quarter estimates. The 10.2 percent rate it paid, after taking advantage of some deferred benefits from past overseas losses, boosted earnings per share to 56 cents, way ahead of the consensus-matching 43 cents its more usual 30 percent levy would have produced.

On top of that, tapping more of those deferred tax assets ought to drive 2017 earnings up to between $1.65 and $1.85 a share, compared with analysts' estimates of $1.51 a share. On one level, that's fine: these so-called DTAs should be used whenever possible. But Ford usually couches its progress – and its outlook – first and foremost in terms of pre-tax income.

Abandoning that practice allowed Ford to mask what could be as much as a 14 percent drop in its earlier guidance of $9 billion in 2017 pre-tax earnings. That ruse was wholly unnecessary since many analysts were already assuming the previous target was too high and even factoring in cuts next year.

It's not an auspicious start for a CEO brought in to speed up change and profit at America's second-largest vehicle producer. And it partly explains why the stock is currently just 1 percent higher than when he took over from Mark Fields, who was ousted in May after a more than one-third drop in the company's value during his time behind the wheel.

Hackett talks a big game about improving Ford, not least its decision-making processes, the way it invests capital and the mobility unit he used to run that works on autonomous-driving and connected cars. So far, though, words are all investors have to go by. He will quickly need to do better than this to navigate the stock out of the mire.

CONTEXT NEWS

- Ford Motor on July 26 reported second-quarter net income of $2 billion, or 51 cents a share. Excluding one-off items, the company earned 56 cents a share. The consensus estimate of sell-side analysts was for earnings of 43 cents a share.

- The carmaker's results were helped by an adjusted tax rate of just 10.2 percent, compared with 31.4 percent in the same period last year. This included $421 million from realizing deferred tax assets in businesses outside the United States.

- The company also said it has revised upwards its expected earnings to between $1.65 and $1.85 a share, ahead of sell-side expectations of $1.51 a share. That is due to the annual tax rate dropping to 15 percent, compared with analysts' consensus estimate of 30 percent.

UPDATE 3-Lower tax rate fuels Ford beat, seen boosting 2017 net profit - Reuters News

{{20170726T134832.013+0000}}UPDATE 3-Lower tax rate fuels Ford beat, seen boosting 2017 net profit(Adds analyst comment, details of results, updates stock price)

By Nick Carey and Paul Lienert

DETROIT, July 26 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co on Wednesday reported a better-than-expected quarterly net profit due to a lower tax rate and increased U.S. sales of more-profitable pickup trucks, but forecast a slightly lower 2017 pre-tax profit, sending its shares down 2.3 percent.

Against a backdrop of declining sales for the U.S. auto industry, Ford leaned heavily on consumer discounts during the quarter and the value of its unsold vehicles rose. Ford warned its full-year automotive operating margin and cash flow would be lower than in 2016.

The No. 2 U.S. automaker said, however, a reduced tax rate would boost its full-year net profit. The results are the first for Chief Executive Jim Hackett since Ford ousted his predecessor in late May and elected him to the top spot.

Hackett has promised a broad-reaching review of Ford's operations within his first 100 days.

Analysts are concerned about the high discounts that Ford and other automakers are relying on to sell cars and high supplies of unsold vehicles.

Ford's global sales were down 43,000 vehicles in the quarter, with 8,000 of that coming in the U.S. market. Ford said its full-year margin in North America would be lower than in 2016 due to rising commodity costs and engineering expenses.

Rival General Motors Co on Tuesday reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit, helped by cost-cutting, and promised to scale back production to cut its burgeoning inventories. [nL1N1KG0CT]

Ford said it now expect full-year adjusted earnings per share in a range from $1.65 to $1.85, above the $1.51 expected by Wall Street, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

But Chief Financial Officer Bob Shanks said this would be largely due to a 2017 tax rate of 15 percent as Ford pulls forward deferred tax losses from outside the United States and could be affected by U.S. market conditions. Wall Street had expected an effective tax rate of 30 percent for 2017.

Shanks said Ford's pre-tax profit would be slightly lower than the $9 billion Ford has previously forecast, after a record of $10.4 billion in 2016.

In a research note for clients, Buckingham Research Group analyst Joseph Amaturo wrote that stripping out the impact of the lower tax rate, the midpoint of Ford's full-year earnings outlook is below analyst expectations.

"We recommend investors remain on the sidelines given our concerns for lower U.S. industry volumes... and continued pricing pressure we expect for the back half of the year, which likely puts profitability under pressure," he wrote.

Ford shares were down 25 cents or 2.3 percent at $11.02.

Ford's CFO said the company has canceled plans to build the next generation of its compact Focus model in South America. For the North American market, Ford announced last month that it would move production of the Focus to China from Mexico.

The company reported second-quarter net income of $2.04 billion, or 51 cents per share, up from just under $2 billion, or 49 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, the No. 2 U.S. automaker reported earnings per share of 56 cents, and on that basis analysts, on average, looked for 43 cents.

Revenue for the quarter rose to $39.9 billion from $39.5 billion.

BRIEF-Ford Motor reports Q2 earnings per share of $0.51 - Reuters News

{{20170726T112213.962+0000}}BRIEF-Ford Motor reports Q2 earnings per share of $0.51DETROIT, July 26 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co on Wednesday reported a higher quarterly net profit that beat expectations because of a lower effective tax rate than the same period a year earlier and increased sales of more profitable pickup trucks in the U.S. market.

The Dearborn, Michigan-based company reported second-quarter net income of $2.04 billion, or 51 cents per share, up from just under $2 billion, or 49 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, the No. 2 U.S. automaker reported earnings per share of 56 cents, and on that basis analysts, on average, looked for 43 cents.

UPDATE 1-Australian watchdog takes Ford local unit to court over transmission complaints - Reuters News

{{20170726T024728.262+0000}}UPDATE 1-Australian watchdog takes Ford local unit to court over transmission complaints* Ford accused of misleading conduct after transmission complaints

* Watchdog seeks financial penalties and redress for customers

* Ford rejects allegations

(Adds comments from ACCC Chairman)

July 26 (Reuters) - Australia's consumer watchdog said on Wednesday it has started court proceedings against Ford Motor Co's local unit, accusing the company of engaging in misleading or deceptive conduct when responding to customer complaints.

Ford refused to provide a refund or replacement vehicle to customers reporting transmission problems that included excessive shuddering, loss of gear selection and sudden loss of power, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) said in a statement.

The complaints concerned three vehicles - the Focus, Fiesta and EcoSport, it said, adding that it was seeking court-imposed financial penalties and redress for customers.

Ford Australia said in a statement that it rejected the allegations and would be challenging the ACCC's claims, adding that it provides refunds and replacements in accordance with consumer law.

"As each of these issues has been identified, the Ford team has investigated and worked with customers to implement manufacturing and repair solutions," Ford Australia said.

ACCC Chairman Rod Sims said Ford told affected customers the transmission issues were caused by the way drivers handled the vehicle, even though the company was aware of systemic issues dating back to at least 2013.

Sims said Ford's conduct was unconscionable and that it sold surrendered vehicles to wholesalers and customers without disclosing the performance issues.

The U.S. Federal Open Market Committee announces its decision on interest rate on the second day of its meeting.

No change to U.S. interest rates was expected.

Facebook Inc is expected to post a rise in second-quarter profit and revenue, driven by its fast-growing mobile ad business. The social media giant is searching for new types of advertising features to supplement its main revenue streams that it expects to cool off this year. Any update on its plans to beef up its features would be interesting.

Ford Motor Co reports second-quarter results, the first since new CEO Jim Hackett took charge. He could elaborate on his plans to reevaluate Ford's operations.

Coca-Cola Co reports second-quarter results. Coca-Cola is looking to cut costs, mainly by reducing 1,200 jobs, and invest in growing its non-carbonated drink business amid falling demand for fizzy drinks globally. The company in April forecast a smaller decline in 2017 adjusted profit than it had previously expected.

The U.S. Commerce Department's new single-family home sales numbers are expected to rise to 0.615 million units in June, from 0.610 million the month before. (1000/1400) The Mortgage Bankers Association's weekly index for mortgage applications is also expected. The index was up 6.3 percent in the previous week. (0700/1100)

Hershey Co's second-quarter sales are expected to grow as the Hershey Kisses and Cadbury chocolates maker has been launching a flurry of new products to keep up with demand from snack-loving consumers in the United States, its home turf. The company has also been keeping a tight lid on costs to help mitigate loss from its China business.

U.S. health insurer Anthem Inc reports second-quarter results in the wake of the failed Republican effort to overhaul or repeal Obamacare. Investors will look for comments from Anthem, which sells Blue Cross Blue Shield plans in 14 states, about the state of the health insurance industry.

Edwards Lifesciences Corp reports second-quarter results with investors looking for the company to maintain the momentum seen in the first quarter, when it exceeded Wall Street expectations on surging sales of transcatheter heart valve replacements and raised its full-year earnings forecast. Vertex Pharmaceuticals will report second-quarter results, a week after the drugmaker reported much better-than-expected data from trials of three different triple combination treatments for rare lung disease, cystic fibrosis. Investors will also focus on sales and forecast of its already approved cystic fibrosis therapies, Kalydeco and Orkambi, that can treat up to 40 percent of patients with the disease.

Nasdaq Inc will report its second-quarter earnings, which are expected to rise on higher trading revenue. The transatlantic exchange operator's expenses are expected to fall. Nasdaq bought Canadian stock trading venue CXC and news distribution company Marketwired last year and will continue to benefit from the acquisitions. The exchange industry is in the midst of a wave of consolidation as companies seek to move more trading onto fewer technology platforms to boost profit margins.

D.R. Horton Inc reports third-quarter results. The No.1 U.S. homebuilder is expected to report a rise in its quarterly revenue and profit, helped by higher home sales. An improving job market has supported demand for housing in the United States but homebuilders continue to face land and labor shortage. Investors would look for the company's financial forecast and its deal with real estate developer Forestar Group Inc.

Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc reports second-quarter earnings. The U.S. hotel operator is expected to report a decline in revenue as it completed the spinoff of Park Hotels and Resorts and Hilton Grand Vacations this year. Hilton has benefited from an uptick in corporate demand as companies spend more based on improved business sentiment following Donald Trump's election as U.S. president in November. Investors will look for the company's comments on its forecast.

Boeing Co is expected to report a second-quarter profit, rebounding from a loss a year ago that reflected charges for its 787, 747 and tanker aircraft programs. But revenue is expected to decline as Boeing cuts aircraft production in light of slower widebody aircraft sales and a shift to a new model of the 777.

U.S. weapons maker Northrop Grumman Corp is expected to report higher profit and revenue for the second quarter, helped by higher sales in its aerospace unit, which makes parts for F-35 fighter jets, drones and space craft. Northrop and other defense stocks have surged this year, helped by heightened geopolitical instability and a pro-defense outlook by U.S. President Donald Trump. Investors will look for an update on full-year financial forecast. General Dynamics Corp, the maker of Gulfstream jets, tanks and U.S. Navy ships, is expected to report higher revenue for the second quarter, helped by stable demand for its business jets in North America. Investors will look for an update on full-year financial forecast.

U.S. oil producer Hess Corp is slated to report a quarterly loss on weak oil prices. The company in April launched the initial public offering of Hess Midstream Partners LP for its pipelines and related assets.

Payment processor PayPal Holdings is expected to report a jump in second-quarter profit as it expands partnerships and acquires new services to gain advantage over rivals. Analysts also expect PayPal to raise its annual guidance and provide an update on its recent partnerships with companies such as Apple, JPMorgan and Citi.

Analysts expect Alaska Air Group to report improved second-quarter results from last quarter's steep earnings drop. The West Coast carrier in December acquired rival Virgin America in a $2.6 billion deal to become the fifth-largest U.S. carrier.

Suncor Energy, Canada's second-largest oil and gas producer, reports second-quarter results. Suncor has endured lower-than-expected oil prices and ongoing problems at the Syncrude oil sands plant in northern Alberta, in which it is the majority owner. Investors will be looking for updates to Suncor's strategy and progress reports on Syncrude, and its new Fort Hills and Hebron projects.

Barrick Gold Corp reports second-quarter financial results. The world's largest gold miner saw challenges at several mines during the quarter which have potential to pinch earnings or production. Leaching restrictions were ordered at the company's Veladero mine in Argentina following a cyanide spill, while an export ban in Tanzania has hit hard Barrick's majority-owned Acacia Mining. Goldcorp Inc also reports second-quarter results. The world's third-biggest gold producer by market value is expected to report a profit, compared with a loss in the same quarter a year ago, on the back of higher production. Investors are likely to focus on the operational performance of Goldcorp's biggest mines, which have suffered setbacks in the past two years, and the company's recent spate of purchase and sale transactions.

UPDATE 2-U.S. may revise 2021 fuel efficiency standards, freeze targets - Reuters News

{{20170725T181540.294+0000}}UPDATE 2-U.S. may revise 2021 fuel efficiency standards, freeze targets(Adds comment from environmental group, Trump administration meetings with automakers, more details of review)

By David Shepardson

WASHINGTON, July 25 (Reuters) - The U.S. Transportation Department said on Tuesday it may revise auto fuel efficiency requirements starting with the 2021 model year, a year earlier than previously disclosed, and could adopt lower standards through 2025.

In March, President Donald Trump ordered a review of U.S. vehicle fuel-efficiency standards from model year 2022 through 2025 established under the Obama administration. U.S. regulators said in a notice published Tuesday they are preparing a new environmental impact statement and could decide to freeze 2021 standards through 2025, rather than raising them every year.

The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a trade group representing General Motors Co , Volkswagen AG , Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T> and others, said in a statement the environmental review "must happen regardless of what future standards are."

The group argues "facts need to drive public policy, including data on consumer sales, gas prices and costs of technology" in determining the final standards.

The Obama administration's rules, negotiated with automakers in 2011, were aimed at doubling average fleet-wide fuel efficiency to about 50 miles per gallon by 2025.

The Obama administration said the rules would save motorists $1.7 trillion in fuel costs over the life of the vehicles but cost the auto industry about $200 billion over 13 years.

Under the 2011 deal, the 2022-2025 model year rules must be finalized by April 2018. Trump reopened a review of those rules after automakers said the Obama administration did not conduct a proper review to ensure the rules are feasible.

Under federal law, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration must set "maximum feasible" Corporate Average Fuel Economy requirements, while considering "technological feasibility, economic practicability... and the need of the United States to conserve energy."

The White House recently invited automakers to attend meetings with officials to talk about the review, officials briefed on the matter said.

Sierra Club's Andrew Linhardt said freezing the fuel efficiency standards could "hurt the American people just to pad the pockets of big oil and auto executives."

NHTSA said in its notice Tuesday it will consider a number of options - including continuing the 2021 requirements through 2025, rather than requiring yearly increases.

Under current rules, fleetwide average fuel economy is expected to be around 41 miles per gallon in 2021, compared to an average of nearly 50 miles per gallon in 2025.

The agency also said it is considering giving automakers additional flexibility for prior model years to meet requirements.

UPDATE 1-'Blade Runner' sequel a siren song for director Villeneuve - Reuters News

{{20170722T214740.077+0000}}UPDATE 1-'Blade Runner' sequel a siren song for director Villeneuve(Adds comments from Ford, details of new footage)

By Piya Sinha-Roy

SAN DIEGO, July 22 (Reuters) - Canadian director Denis Villeneuve had fended off numerous requests to direct big-budget sequels until he was approached to make a follow-up to Ridley Scott's 1982 neo-noir sci-fi film "Blade Runner."

"I accepted to do 'Blade Runner' because it was meaningful," Villeneuve, the director of last year's cerebral alien sci-fi film "Arrival," told Reuters.

"The resonance of the first movie in my life, the love I have for it, it's worth it to take that risk," he added.

"Blade Runner 2049," in theaters on Oct. 6, will pick up 30 years after the events of the first movie, when human-like robots were hunted by police in a dystopian Los Angeles.

"We created a world that is an extension of the first movie, a projection of its future, where some laws and some rules will be in relationship with the first movie and not with today," Villeneuve said.

The first film followed Harrison Ford as "blade runner" Rick Deckard, an expert on hunting the humanoid Replicant robots living on earth illegally, against a backdrop of a futuristic Los Angeles depicted as a hybrid of Eastern and Western cultural influences.

In a new trailer released this week, the sequel returns to a dystopian California after the ecosystem has broken down, where a Los Angeles police officer (Ryan Gosling) stumbles upon a secret that could jeopardize society and seeks out Deckard, who has been missing for 30 years.

Villeneuve, Ford and Gosling were joined by other cast members on Saturday at San Diego's annual Comic-Con as they discussed the sequel and debuted new footage that showed a world where Replicants and humans live alongside each other, but not in harmony.

"The original film explored the ethics of the creation of the Replicants and their utility and we further developed those themes in this story," Ford said.

Villeneuve told Reuters that he had worked with Ford to evolve the character of Deckard.

"There's a melancholia that I like in the first movie that we kept alive in Deckard, and something taciturn, not someone who talks a lot, and a sadness to the character that is there and existential doubt," the director said.

The sequel will stay close to the original film's themes of identity and memory, Villeneuve added.

"I don't think the movie will necessarily say interesting things about our future, apart from the fact we're still there, but it'll say things about today, for sure," he said.

UPDATE 2-Ford to petition to avoid U.S. recall of 2.5 mln vehicles - Reuters News

{{20170721T202239.947+0000}}UPDATE 2-Ford to petition to avoid U.S. recall of 2.5 mln vehicles(Adds Mazda statement, closing Ford stock price)

By David Shepardson

WASHINGTON, July 21 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co will petition to avoid a U.S. recall of about 2.5 million vehicles with Takata <7312.T> air-bag inflators that the Japanese auto supplier declared defective last week, U.S. regulators and the automaker said on Friday.

Separately, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said Nissan Motor Co <7201.T> agreed to recall 515,394 2007-2011 Versa cars after Takata declared 2.7 million vehicles to have potentially defective inflators.

Ford spokesman John Cangany said the automaker will file a petition requesting "to continue testing and analyzing our inflators." The NHTSA said the petition will seek an exemption from the recall because Ford believes the issue is inconsequential.

Ford said the issue covers 2.5 million vehicles, including the 2007-11 Ranger, 2006-12 Fusion and Lincoln MKZ, 2006-11 Mercury Milan, and 2007-10 Ford Edge and Lincoln MKX. Ford previously said it covered about 2.2 million vehicles.

Last week, the NHTSA said that new testing prompted Takata to declare inflators defective in Ford, Nissan and Mazda Motor Corp <7261.T> vehicles in some driver-side air bags built from 2012 through 2015.

The NHTSA said in a statement on Friday that "testing data shows that the propellant in this inflator is degrading and on the path towards potential ruptures in the future. There are no reported ruptures in the real-world or in testing."

Takata air bag inflators are already linked to 17 deaths and more than 180 injuries worldwide, and the recalls will eventually cover about 125 million inflators.

Nissan said last week it would recall 627,000 Versa cars from the 2007-12 model years, including 515,000 in the United States "out of an abundance of caution."

Nissan said testing of 895 inflators showed no ruptures, while one "exhibited an elevated internal pressure." Takata said the inflators potentially could rupture "after several years of exposure to high absolute humidity."

Mazda said last week the issue impacts just 6,000 of 2007-09 B-series trucks that were built under a previous Ford partnership. The company said on Friday that it also plans to file a petition to avoid a recall.

Ford shares fell 1.5 percent on Friday to close at $11.53.

The automakers have 30 days to submit their petitions, and the NHTSA will then take public comment before making a decision.

More than 65 percent of 46.2 million previously recalled Takata airbag inflators in the United States have not been repaired. The issue is the largest-ever auto-safety recall, covering 17 automakers.

Takata filed for bankruptcy protection in June.

U.S. Navy to commission first "Ford-class" carrier on July 22 - Reuters News

{{20170720T212416.389+0000}}U.S. Navy to commission first "Ford-class" carrier on July 22July 20 (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Defense said the Navy will commission its first "Ford-class" aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald R. Ford, on Saturday at its base in Norfolk, Virginia - three years behind schedule and billions over budget.

U.S. President Donald Trump will deliver the principal address at Naval Station Norfolk, the DoD said in a statement. (http://bit.ly/2tuInzU)

Trump said in March that the newest generation of Ford-class carriers - the most expensive warships ever built - will remain the centerpiece of projecting American power abroad.

He has vowed to expand the number of carriers the United States fields from 10 to 12. [nL2N1GL1MD]

The new carrier is the lead ship of the Ford-class of "super -carriers", the first new class in more than 40 years, and will replace the current Nimitz-class carriers.

The Navy also said it would spend $43 billion in total to build the first three ships in the class, including the USS John F. Kennedy and the USS Enterprise.

The warships are being built by Huntington Ingalls Industries Inc .

UPDATE 1-Continental to buy 8-10 pct stake in mapping firm HERE - Magazin - Reuters News

{{20170720T131235.233+0000}}UPDATE 1-Continental to buy 8-10 pct stake in mapping firm HERE - Magazin(Adds comment from Ford, detail and background)

BERLIN, July 20 (Reuters) - German car manufacturing supplier Continental is in talks to acquire an 8-10 percent stake in the digital mapping firm HERE which is now controlled by Germany's leading carmakers, Manager Magazin said on Thursday, citing unnamed company sources.

The talks are nearing conclusion and a contract is due to be signed in September, it added.

Continental declined to comment on what it described as speculation.

Carmakers BMW , Daimler and Volkswagen bought HERE for 2.8 billion euros ($3.22 billion) in 2015 from Finnish telecoms group Nokia as they push ahead with investments in self-driving cars.

Last year Chinese digital mapping company NavInfo <002405.SZ>, Tencent <0700.HK> and Singapore's sovereign wealth fund GIC took a 10 percent stake in HERE, with the German carmakers pledging to reduce their own stakes. [nL5N1EM0PB]

But HERE needs more capital to expand its network of high-precision maps and has been in talks with other investors. Talks with U.S. carmaker Ford are most advanced, Manager Magazin said, without being more specific.

A spokesman for Ford Europe declined comment on speculation. ($1 = 0.8705 euros)

UPDATE 1-Volvo Cars profit rises, plans tech-sharing Geely venture - Reuters News

{{20170720T083101.600+0000}}UPDATE 1-Volvo Cars profit rises, plans tech-sharing Geely venture(Adds technology venture, CEO comment)

By Niklas Pollard

STOCKHOLM, July 20 (Reuters) - Sweden's Volvo Cars sold more vehicles in Europe and China in the first half that helped drive up earnings 21 percent and said it would set up a joint venture with its Chinese parent to share technology with other brands in the Geely group.

Under Chinese ownership since being bought by Zhejiang Geely Holding Group from Ford in 2010, Volvo has taken on larger rivals such as BMW and Daimler's Mercedes-Benz with new premium models.

Volvo Car Group, one of Sweden's biggest companies by revenue, posted operating earnings of 6.8 billion Swedish crowns ($820 million) for the six months to June 30, against 5.6 billion crowns in the same period last year.

Revenues rose to 99.1 billion crowns, up from 84.2 billion crowns, and the company said it remained confident sales this year would exceed the record high set only last year.

The company aims to reach sales of 800,000 cars within the next few years. It sold 277,641 Volvos in the first half, up 8.2 percent from a year ago, as strength in China and Europe offset a lingering U.S. slump.

Delivery problems have dogged Volvo in the United States this year, contributing to a 7 percent drop in first-half sales there. It does not have a manufacturing base in North America but is building a U.S. plant to boost supply.

Volvo said it expected an upturn in the second half of the year and aimed to deliver "solid full-year growth" in the United States as tight global supply of its XC90 model eased and its new XC60 mid-size SUV hit the U.S. market.

"The demand from customers is really there," Samuelsson told Reuters. "In the second half, we will have the XC60 launched and that is really for the U.S. market an even bigger car."

TECHNOLOGY SHARING

In a step towards closer ties with other brands controlled by its Chinese owner, Volvo said it was creating a joint venture with Zhejiang Geely to share technology.

Volvo, Geely Auto <0175.HK> and LYNK & CO, a brand established last year and positioned between Volvo and Geely in price, would share vehicle architecture and engine technology via cross licensing arrangements managed by the venture.

"We will unlock significant benefits across our portfolio by sharing both technologies and next-generation vehicle architectures," Zhejiang Geely Chairman Li Shufu said in a statement.

"I am confident these synergies can be achieved while preserving the separate identities and strategic autonomy of our different automotive brands," he said.

Samuelsson said the deal would provide Volvo with greater development resources and speed up introduction of new technology in areas such as components for electric vehicles.

"And, maybe most importantly, we can lower the material cost because we will have a higher volume for the common components and will source them jointly," he told Reuters.

With earnings and sales rising, speculation has been growing that an initial public offering (IPO) is on the cards.

Last year, Volvo took a step towards listing, raising 5 billion crowns from Swedish institutional investors through the sale of newly issued preference shares. But it said it had no immediate plans for an IPO.

"We try to act as a listed company, but currently we are not planning an IPO," Samuelsson said.

($1 = 8.2879 Swedish crowns)

STOCKHOLM, July 20 (Reuters) - Volvo Car Group reported a 21 percent rise in first-half earnings on Thursday, helped by higher turnover in Europe and China, keeping it on track for record full-year sales.

Under Chinese ownership since being bought by Zhejiang Geely Holding Group from Ford in 2010, Volvo has begun to take on larger rivals such as BMW and Daimler's Mercedes-Benz, carving out a niche in the premium market with a string of new models.

Volvo, one of Sweden's biggest companies by revenue, posted operating earnings of 6.8 billion Swedish crowns ($820 million) for the six months to June 30, against 5.6 billion crowns in the same period last year.

Net sales rose to 99.1 billion crowns, up from 84.2 billion crowns.

"Globally, we expect the pace of growth generated in the first half of the year to continue. We are confident we will report another record year in terms of sales," Volvo Chief Executive Hakan Samuelsson said in a statement.

The company aims to reach sales of 800,000 cars within the next few years. It sold 277,641 Volvos in the first half, up 8.2 percent from a year ago, as strength in China and Europe offset a lingering U.S. slump.

Samuelsson said the company expects an upturn in the second half of the year to deliver "solid full-year growth" in the United States.

"Delivery constraints affected first-quarter sales," he said, "but a return to growth during the second quarter and the impending start of delivery of the new XC60 mid-size SUV point to a stronger finish." ($1 = 8.2879 Swedish crowns)

Ford's "golden noses" seek edge in slowing China car market - Reuters News

{{20170719T230004.450+0000}}Ford's "golden noses" seek edge in slowing China car market* Chinese don't like 'new car' smell, strong odours

* At Ford, assessors check smell of all materials

* Automakers seek out any edge in competitive, slowing mkt

By Adam Jourdan

NANJING, China, July 20 (Reuters) - While Western drivers like the 'new car' smell fresh off the production line, Chinese would rather their cars didn't smell of anything - a cultural divide that's testing car makers seeking an edge to revive sales in the world's biggest auto market.

At Ford Motor Co , for example, 18 smell assessors - dubbed "golden noses" - at its research plant outside the eastern city of Nanjing test the smell of each material that goes inside a Ford car to be sold in China and around Asia.

The China smell test isn't unique, but illustrates the lengths automakers go to to attract buyers in markets where consumer attitudes vary widely.

"In North America, people want a new car smell and will even buy a 'new car' spray to make older cars feel new and fresh. In China it's the opposite," says Andy Pan, supervisor for material engineering at the Ford facility, which employs around 2,300 people.

The smell of a new car in China can have an outsized effect. A J.D. Power report last year showed that unpleasant car smells were the top concern for Chinese drivers, ahead of engine issues, road noise or fuel consumption.

The smell assessors at Ford, whose China sales are down 7 percent this year, [nL3N1JX1R8] [nL4N1K22BG] carry out 300 tests a year, a third more than their counterparts in Europe. They rate the odour of all materials used in a car from "not perceptible" to "extremely disturbing".

Pungent materials - from carpets to seat covers and steering wheels - are noted as smelling of anything from "burnt tire" and "bad meat" to "moth balls" or "dirty socks". Some are sent back to the supplier.

Seats for Ford cars in China are stored in perforated cloth bags to keep them ventilated before being installed, as opposed to plastic wrapping in the U.S. market where consumers are less concerned about chemical smells.

"The smell inside the car can often be pretty pungent," said Tom Lin, a 24-year-old high-school teacher in Zhejiang province, who bought a local Roewe brand car last October. He said there was still a bit of an odour six months later.

"With the next car I buy, I'm going to take more care to check out any odd smells," he said.

EXTRA EDGE

To be sure, smell is just one factor for automakers to get right in China, where picky buyers are always looking for fresh car models and Beijing is making a big drive towards new energy vehicles. [nL8N1K44FT]

In a slower market - consultancy IHS forecasts vehicle sales will slip slightly this year - firms are looking for an extra edge to appeal to consumers, beyond price discounts, says IHS analyst James Chao.

Local rivals Geely Automobile <0175.HK> and BYD Co Ltd <002594.SZ> tout their in-car air filters to protect drivers from China's harmful air pollution, and BMW says it is adding larger touch screens and tweaking colours to appeal to Chinese buyers.

Smell is key though, reflecting a wider concern in China about chemicals and pollution.

"When I lived in the United States I might look at the suspension or the engine," said Don Yu, China general manager at CGT, which makes materials to cover car seats and dashboards for General Motors , Volkswagen and Ford.

"In China, though, people open the car and sit inside, if the smell isn't good enough they think it will jeopardize their health."

For Ford's "golden noses" that means a strict routine. Testers undergo a tough selection process, proving themselves on blind smell tests before being chosen.

"We have to have very healthy habits; we can't smoke, we can't drink," says one of the team, 33-year-old Amy Han, adding she avoids spicy food and doesn't wear nail polish, strong perfume or even a leather jacket to keep her smell sense sharp.

UPDATE 1-U.S. House panel approves broad proposal on self-driving cars - Reuters News

{{20170719T202332.093+0000}}UPDATE 1-U.S. House panel approves broad proposal on self-driving cars(Adds automakers, California, Michigan legislative reaction, Senate work on bill)

By David Shepardson

WASHINGTON, July 19 (Reuters) - A U.S. House panel on Wednesday approved a sweeping proposal by voice vote to allow automakers to deploy up to 100,000 self-driving vehicles without meeting existing auto safety standards and bar states from imposing driverless car rules.

Representative Robert Latta, a Republican who heads the Energy and Commerce Committee subcommittee overseeing consumer protection, said he would continue to consider changes before the full committee votes on the measure, expected next week. The full U.S. House of Representatives will not take up the bill until it reconvenes in September after the summer recess.

The measure, which would be the first significant federal legislation aimed at speeding self-driving cars to market, would require automakers to submit safety assessment reports to U.S. regulators, but would not require pre-market approval of advanced vehicle technologies.

Automakers would have to show self-driving cars "function as intended and contain fail safe features" to get exemptions from safety standards but the Transportation Department could not "condition deployment or testing of highly automated vehicles on review of safety assessment certifications," the draft measure unveiled late Monday said.

The issue has taken new urgency because road deaths in the United States rose 7.7 percent in 2015 over the previous year to 35,200, the highest annual jump since 1966. Traffic deaths climbed nearly 8 percent in the first nine months of 2016, government data showed.

Current federal motor vehicle safety rules prevent the sale of self-driving vehicles without human controls. Automakers must meet nearly 75 auto safety standards, many of which were written with the assumption that a licensed driver will be in control of the vehicle.

General Motors Co , Alphabet Inc , Ford Motor Co , Tesla Inc and others have been lobbying Congress to pre-empt rules under consideration in California and other states that could limit self-driving vehicle deployment.

States could still set rules on registration, licensing, liability, insurance and safety inspections, but could not set self-driving car performance standards, under the proposal.

California state assemblyman Freddie Rodriguez questioned "why Washington would want us here in the states to not look at the safety standards – it should be up to every state."

Representative Debbie Dingell, a Democrat from Michigan, said the bill creates a "strong but flexible regulatory framework" that seeks to avoid "a patchwork" of different state rules.

Auto dealers want the final bill to clarify that the measure would not preempt state dealer franchise laws that generally bar automakers from selling vehicles directly to consumers.

Democrats praised the bipartisan proposal but said they want more changes before the full committee takes it up, including potentially adding other auto safety measures.

The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a trade group, said it is "pleased that the legislation is moving forward, and expect to see areas fine-tuned in the legislation."

Consumers Union, a public advocacy group, said the bill needs more changes and must "ensure that automakers demonstrate automated vehicles' safety and don't put consumers at greater risk in a crash." The group opposes "restricting states' safety authority without strong federal safety standards in place."

The administration of former President Barack Obama last year unveiled voluntary guidelines on self-driving cars that asked automakers to submit a 15-question safety assessment. President Donald Trump's transportation secretary, Elaine Chao, said she plans to update those in the coming months.

Separately, Republican Senator John Thune, who is working with Democrats, said Wednesday he hopes to release a draft self-driving car reform bill before the end of July.

NAFTA exit, border tax would raise U.S. carmakers' costs- study - Reuters News

{{20170719T170000.931+0000}}NAFTA exit, border tax would raise U.S. carmakers' costs- studyBy Nick Carey

DETROIT, July 19 (Reuters) - A U.S. exit from NAFTA or implementation of a border tax would result in many billions of dollars in additional costs for automakers and their suppliers and add hundreds of dollars to each car's production costs, according to a study released on Wednesday.

"Vitality in the motor vehicle sector hinges on a globally integrated supply chain," said Xavier Mosquet, a Detroit-based senior partner at Boston Consulting Group (BCG) and the study's lead author. "By introducing new tariffs, a border tax and a retreat from NAFTA would greatly impede the industry's relatively smooth and cost-effective flow of goods across borders in North America and around the world."

Republican U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to exit the North American Free Trade Agreement if it is not renegotiated in favor of the United States. Talks with Mexico and Canada on revisions to the treaty, which came into effect in 1994, are due to start in mid-August.

Just this week, the Trump administration launched the first salvo in the renegotiation of the treaty, saying its top priority for the talks was shrinking the U.S. trade deficit with Canada and Mexico. [nL1N1K8149]

According to the BCG study, commissioned by the U.S. Motor & Equipment Manufacturers Association, leaving NAFTA would have severe implications for the sector. The study estimated U.S. tariffs in a range from 20 percent to 35 percent would add $16 billion to $27 billion annually to costs at automakers and their suppliers.

A 20 percent tariff would increase the production cost per vehicle by $650, the study found.

A border adjustment tax, which would impose a tax on imports while favoring domestic production, has been proposed in the Republican-controlled U.S. Congress, but its future looks shaky as Trump has refused to endorse it and many Republicans in the House and Senate are opposed.

The BCG study found a 15 percent border tax would result in a net tax increase of $22 billion annually for automakers and their suppliers, which would translate into an increase of $1,000 per vehicle in manufacturing costs for the top 12 carmakers selling vehicles in America.

U.S. House panel approves broad proposal on self-driving cars - Reuters News

{{20170719T161359.457+0000}}U.S. House panel approves broad proposal on self-driving carsBy David Shepardson

WASHINGTON, July 19 (Reuters) - A U.S. House panel on Wednesday approved a sweeping proposal by voice vote to allow automakers to deploy up to 100,000 self-driving vehicles without meeting existing auto safety standards and bar states from imposing driverless car rules.

Representative Robert Latta, a Republican who heads the Energy and Commerce Committee subcommittee overseeing consumer protection, said he would continue to consider changes before the full committee votes on the measure, expected next week. The full U.S. House of Representatives will not take up the bill until it reconvenes in September after the summer recess.

The measure, which would be the first significant federal legislation aimed at speeding self-driving cars to market, would require automakers to submit safety assessment reports to U.S. regulators, but would not require pre-market approval of advanced vehicle technologies.

Automakers would have to show self-driving cars "function as intended and contain fail safe features" but the Transportation Department could not "condition deployment or testing of highly automated vehicles on review of safety assessment certifications," the draft measure unveiled late Monday said.

The issue has taken new urgency because road deaths in the United States rose 7.7 percent in 2015 over the previous year to 35,200, the highest annual jump since 1966. Traffic deaths climbed nearly 8 percent in the first nine months of 2016, government data showed.

Current federal motor vehicle safety rules prevent the sale of self-driving vehicles without human controls. Automakers must meet nearly 75 auto safety standards, many of which were written with the assumption that a licensed driver will be in control of the vehicle.

General Motors Co , Alphabet Inc , Ford Motor Co , Tesla Inc and others have been lobbying Congress to pre-empt rules under consideration in California and other states that could limit self-driving vehicle deployment.

States could still set rules on registration, licensing, liability, insurance and safety inspections, but could not set self-driving car performance standards, under the proposal.

Auto dealers want the final bill to clarify that the measure would not preempt state dealer franchise laws that generally bar automakers from selling vehicles directly to consumers.

Consumers Union, a public advocacy group, said Wednesday the bill needs more changes and must "ensure that automakers demonstrate automated vehicles' safety and don't put consumers at greater risk in a crash." The group opposes "restricting states' safety authority without strong federal safety standards in place."

The administration of former President Barack Obama last year unveiled voluntary guidelines on self-driving cars that asked automakers to submit a 15-question safety assessment. President Donald Trump's transportation secretary, Elaine Chao, said she plans to update those in the coming months.

CORRECTED-Labor unions, Democrats pressure Trump ahead of NAFTA priorities statement - Reuters News

{{20170717T195416.573+0000}}CORRECTED-Labor unions, Democrats pressure Trump ahead of NAFTA priorities statement(In paragraph nine, corrects Debbie Dingell's title to representative from senator)

By Lesley Wroughton

WASHINGTON, July 17 (Reuters) - U.S. labor union leaders and Democratic lawmakers on Monday reminded U.S. President Donald Trump they expect him to keep election campaign promises to protect American workers in NAFTA talks, but they stopped short of demanding termination of the 1994 trade pact with Canada and Mexico.

Their comments came hours before U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer was to outline the administration's priorities for the talks. Under U.S. "fast-track" rules, the administration must release the priorities 30 days before negotiations begin.

President Richard Trumka of the AFL-CIO, an umbrella organization of unions representing 12.5 million workers, said the North American Free Trade Agreement had been an "unequivocal failure" and should be completely renegotiated.

"We will do everything we can to make this a good agreement and to hold the president at this word and make sure we get a renegotiation," he told a conference call with reporters.

"If it comes out that it is not a good deal, no deal is better than a bad deal," said Trumka.

The document outlining White House priorities was expected on Monday afternoon, said House Democrat Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut, a leading voice against trade legislation on Capitol Hill.

The Trump administration has so far offered few specifics, other than expressing its desire to modernize the pact to increase U.S. manufacturing jobs and cut the trade deficit.

Some provisions from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which Trump abandoned, are likely to serve as a model for NAFTA revisions, especially on issues such as labor, environment, intellectual property rights and state-owned enterprise.[nL1N1K519Z]

Democratic Representative Debbie Dingell from Michigan. which is home to large automakers like Ford , General Motors and Fiat Chrysler , said she offered to work with the administration if it was serious about the talks.

Dingell in the past has called for U.S. trade deals to contain explicit provisions to deter currency manipulation by trading partners.

NAFTA has quadrupled trade among the three countries, surpassing $1 trillion in 2015. Over a decade to 2010, however, the United States lost nearly 6 million manufacturing jobs. The U.S. trade balance with Mexico also swung from a small surplus in 1994 to deficits that have exceeded $60 billion for most of the past decade.

Bob Martinez, who heads the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, said labor unions should be present at the NAFTA negotiating table.

"I am requesting such," said Martinez. "Any renegotiation that starts off with the current trade template found in TPP is unacceptable," he said.

Marijuana shipment disguised as spare tires in new cars -U.S. officials  - Reuters News

{{20170717T195210.475+0000}}Marijuana shipment disguised as spare tires in new cars -U.S. officials By Bernie Woodall

July 17 (Reuters) - About $1 million worth of smuggled marijuana was discovered last week in the spare tire compartments of newly assembled Ford Fusion sedans imported into the United States from Mexico, U.S. officials said on Monday.

The smuggling was uncovered on Wednesday when workers at a Ford dealer in Kent, Ohio found the marijuana in a new Fusion, said Major Dale Kelly of the Portage County Sheriff's Office by phone.

In all, 15 Mexican-made Ford cars, each packed with marijuana instead of a spare tire, made it to Ohio by rail, the Drug Enforcement Agency said. The sheriff's office said that the shipment crossed over the Mexican border in Arizona.

None of the cars, each packed with 32 pounds (14.5 kg) of marijuana, made it to consumers, Balzano said.

The marijuana was likely supposed to be collected at the rail station or in transit, Bob Balzano, resident agent-in-charge of the DEA in Youngstown, Ohio, said by phone.

After reaching Ohio by rail, nine of the 15 cars were then taken by truck to auto dealerships in Ohio and one went to a dealer in Pennsylvania, Balzano said. Five other cars never left the rail yard in Lordstown, Ohio.

Of the 15 cars, 14 were Ford Fusion sedans and one was a Lincoln MKZ sedan, Balzano said.

The marijuana was tightly packed into crescents, so that when two halves were put together, they created a circular shape like a tire.

Ford Motor Co spokeswoman Kelli Felker said the U.S. automaker was working with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and U.S. Customs. "We have confirmed that this is not happening at our plant or at our internal shipping yards," she said.

A similar smuggling attempt was discovered in March in Minnesota, where BNSF Railway police found 217 pounds of marijuana in seven vehicles, according to a Facebook posting by the police in Dilworth, Minnesota. Balzano said they were also Ford Fusion sedans shipped from Mexico.

Behind the scenes, companies fight Trump on US steel tariffs - Reuters News

{{20170714T182206.808+0000}}Behind the scenes, companies fight Trump on US steel tariffsBy Ginger Gibson

WASHINGTON, July 14 (Reuters) - American manufacturers, energy companies and retailers reliant on cheap steel are quietly lobbying against President Donald Trump's desire to impose tariffs on steel imports ahead of possible decision by the U.S. Commerce Department next week.

Honoring a promise made in the 2016 election campaign, in April this year Trump initiated a "Section 232" review of the steel industry, a provision in the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 allowing for the imposition of tariffs or quotas on imports if they threaten national security. The provision has only been used to review imports twice before.

The Commerce Department could issue findings on the matter as early as next week, a decision that three lobbyists say has been delayed due to debate inside the administration.

Steel producers in the U.S., like U.S. Steel Corp and AK Steel stand to benefit from protectionist tariffs which would enable them to raise their prices.

But U.S. manufacturers and energy companies who use steel want to keep their costs down and say tariffs could costs jobs in their industries, while retailers need cheap steel for many facets of their business including shelving in their stores and warehouses, and to sell to consumers.

Any U.S. tariffs may also result in damage to unrelated industries if other countries retaliate by also imposing tariffs on American exports in sectors such as agriculture.

"Our member companies have quietly had these conversations with both members of the administration but also with the Hill," said Hun Quach, the vice president for international trade at the Retail Industry Leaders Association.

Those in favor of approving new tariffs include not only steel manufacturers, but some aligned unions. They have allies in Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, a former U.S. Steel lawyer who has promised to recuse himself from decisions regarding the industry.

PROS AND CONS

Mario Longhi, who until a few weeks ago was chief executive of U.S. Steel, said earlier this year that curbing cheap steel imports could restore jobs for 10,000 American steel workers.

The U.S. steel industry employed about 147,000 people in 2015, according to the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic analysis.

But manufacturers that need steel employ about 6.5 million people each year, and the construction industry supports another 6.3 million jobs.

Manufacturers argue that pushing up the cost of steel by imposing tariffs on imports ultimately hurts American consumers who will pay more for everyday goods made from steel, such as lawn mowers, washing machines, and microwaves.

When former President George W. Bush imposed steel tariffs in 2002, the move was found illegal by the World Trade Organization which permitted other countries to retaliate against American exports and Bush was forced to back down.

Studies by the free trade lobby group, the Consuming Industries Trade Action Coalition (CITAC), found that 200,000 workers in U.S. manufacturing lost their jobs as a result of the 2002 steel tariffs.

POLITICAL RISK

Pushing back against something that was a signature piece of Trump's campaign carries some political risk though and most companies would only elaborate on their lobbying efforts anonymously, saying they were making their case to Trump and lawmakers behind closed doors.

They see allies in Gary Cohn, the head of the National Economic Council and Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue.

"We've been quite vocal both on the Hill and in the administration," said a lobbyist for a large manufacturing company that uses both U.S. steel and imported steel, but who declined to speak on the record over concerns public statements could damage relationships with the White House.

Several companies have also been pressing members of Congress to advocate against tariffs with the administration on their behalf, said several lobbyists.

Several companies, including National Oilwell Varco Inc. , Ball Corporation , and Electrolux , submitted public comments to the Commerce Department arguing against tariffs.

The American Petroleum Industry, which represents the largest oil refiners and chemical companies including ExxonMobil , Shell Oil Company , Chevron and Dow Chemical Company , issued forceful comments against the proposed tariffs, as did the American Automotive Policy Council, which includes Ford Motor Co. and General Motors .

"The auto industry and the U.S. workers that the industry employs would be adversely affected and that this unintended negative impact would exceed the benefit provided to the steel industry," the American Automotive Policy Council said in a message echoed in other comments.

UPDATE 1-New Honda Accord charges into a slumping U.S. sedan market - Reuters News

{{20170714T170059.769+0000}}UPDATE 1-New Honda Accord charges into a slumping U.S. sedan market(Adds details on 2018 Accord, Honda executive comments)

By Nick Carey

DETROIT, July 13 (Reuters) - Honda Motor Co Ltd <7267.T> on Friday will unveil its newest-generation Accord, one of four re-engineered midsize sedans that Asian automakers are betting on to win market share as Detroit rivals shift focus to SUVs, crossovers and pickup trucks.

The new Accord, like rival Toyota Motor Corp's <7203.T> all-new Camry launching this month, offers more horsepower, safety technology like standard collision-avoiding braking, styling that pays homage to German sports sedans, and better fuel economy although Honda did not release figures.

In a nod to driving enthusiasts, Honda will offer manual transmission as an option in two versions of the 2018 Accord, instead of only automatic shift in most midsize cars. Certain new Accords will be available with a new 10-speed auto shift, which Honda called a first for a front-wheel drive car.

The new Accord's infotainment system can be upgraded over a Wi-Fi network, although functions such as braking or engine performance will not be upgradable over the air, Honda said.

The Accord and Camry are pillars of their manufacturers' U.S. businesses, each selling well over 300,000 vehicles a year. In the coming months, Nissan Motor Co Ltd <7201.T> is expected to launch a new Altima midsize sedan, and Hyundai Motor Co <005380.KS will launch a new Sonata midsize car. All are popular marques that will be promoted heavily.

Honda Senior Vice President Jeff Conrad said in Detroit on Friday he expected the Accord to sustain its current sales level, estimated at around 350,000 cars this year, despite the overall decline in sedan sales.

"We think the addition of new product is going to make people stop and take a look" at the sedan segment, Conrad said, in reference to the models hitting the market this fall.[nL4N1K13D4]

With General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co cutting sedan production, and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV abandoning the segment, Honda and its Asian rivals could boost sales with updated models, dealers said.

"They could take share from other brands, which is traditionally what happens when a new product is launched," said Pete DeLongchamps, vice president for manufacturer relations at Group 1 Automotive Inc , the third-largest U.S. auto dealer group.

Passenger car sales have steadily declined since 2012 when they made up 51.2 percent of the U.S. market. Sedans have sagged to a 38.1 percent share in the first half of this year. IHS Markit said U.S. consumer loyalty to SUVs and pickup trucks has risen since 2012, but declined for sedans. (For a graphic, see: http://tmsnrt.rs/2tNZJ9J)

RPT-U.S. growth fund managers still bullish on Tesla after shares tumble - Reuters News

{{20170714T110001.471+0000}}RPT-U.S. growth fund managers still bullish on Tesla after shares tumble(Repeats story published earlier July 14, no changes)

By David Randall

NEW YORK, July 14 (Reuters) - Growth fund managers who have long held shares in Tesla Inc said they were still confident in the electric car maker even after production problems sent the stock diving more than 15 percent from its all-time high.

Fund managers from Janus Henderson, Baron, and Tanaka said they still believed in Tesla, whose pricey valuation and 51 percent gain for the year to date have made it a target of noted short-sellers such as Greenlight Capital's David Einhorn and Kynikos Associates' Jim Chanos.

The stock tumbled from its record high of $386.99 after the company said July 3 that it had experienced production delays and delivered about 47,100 vehicles in the first half of the year, at the low end of its own forecasts. Tesla shares fell to $323.41 on Thursday.

"This is not the first nor the last quarterly Tesla disappointment or miss," said David Chung, a portfolio manager at Denver-based Janus Henderson funds. "I think longer-term investors like us recognize that we are still early in this sector and this is a truly special company and exceptional CEO."

Chung said the stock valuation remained reasonable based on his estimates of the company's 2020 fiscal year, in which its Model 3 sedan, now in production, will be fully ramped up.

Chung said he expected the company would sometimes miss estimates sometimes, but Musk has earned the benefit of the doubt given the quality of existing models. The company is well on track to have a significant mass market presence within the next three years, Chung added.

The first Model 3 rolled off Tesla's assembly line a few days ago, though the company has yet to announce when it will begin regular shipments of pre-ordered vehicles.

Tesla investors have high hopes for the $35,000 sedan, the company's first foray into the mass market and a key indicator of whether its electric vehicles can become popular enough to displace established rivals like General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co .

The company expects the Model 3 to help it deliver 6 times its annual volume and turn a profit.

Yet the company has also been plagued by production delays that prompted it to miss previous forecasts, leading some analysts to cut their outlook.

"We continue to be cautious relative to the potential for a slower than guided start to Model 3 assembly, and newly believe that the potential for Model3 pre-orders cancellations may increasingly become a point of investor concern," noted Ryan Brinkman, an analyst at JPMorgan, who has an underweight rating on the company and a $190 price target on its shares.

Short sellers have targeted Tesla, which analysts expect to turn its first full-year profit in 2019. Approximately 17 percent of its shares are now being shorted, according to Thomson Reuters data, a level that has remained level throughout the year even as short sellers annual losses have topped $3.8 billion [L1N1I4170].

"In terms of conviction, they seem to be very strong because they are taking it on the chin and keep on going on," said Ihor Dusaniwsky, head of research at S3 Partners, a financial analytics firm in New York.

Graham Tanaka, portfolio manager of the New York-based Tanaka Growth fund, said Tesla short sellers were not factoring in potential improvements and growth of the battery division. The company began production of Model 3 batteries at its Gigafactory in Nevada in January, which should reduce costs and improve the lifespan of batteries with greater scale of production, Tanaka said.

"They're going to be making better batteries at a cheaper price than any of the competition," he said.

By Nick Carey

DETROIT, July 13 (Reuters) - Honda Motor Co Ltd <7267.T> on Friday will unveil its newest-generation Accord, one of four re-engineered midsize sedans that Asian automakers are betting on to win market share as Detroit automakers shift focus to SUVs, crossovers and pickup trucks.

The new Accord, like rival Toyota Motor Corp's <7203.T> all-new Camry launching this month, is expected to offer major improvements in fuel economy, technology, styling and safety, according to Honda's U.S. dealers.

Honda declined to discuss details ahead of Friday's event in Detroit.

The Accord and Camry are pillars of their manufacturers' U.S. businesses, each selling well over 300,000 vehicles a year. In the coming months, Nissan Motor Co Ltd <7201.T> is expected to launch a new Altima midsize sedan, and Hyundai Motor Co <005380.KS will launch a new Sonata midsize car. Both are popular marques that will be promoted heavily.

"There has been no new news on the midsize sedan side for three years and we think this is a great opportunity to bring attention back to the segment," said Jack Hollis, Toyota's head of marketing for North America. [nL4N1K13D4]

Year to date, U.S. passenger car sales are down 11.4 percent and sales of midsize sedans are down 14.2 percent. Still, Americans bought 7.1 million sedans in 2016. With General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co cutting sedan production, and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV abandoning the segment, Honda and its Asian rivals could boost sales with updated models, dealers said.

"They could take share from other brands, which is traditionally what happens when a new product is launched," said Pete DeLongchamps, vice president for manufacturer relations at Group 1 Automotive Inc , the third-largest U.S. auto dealer group.

"NOT FINDING A PLACE WITH CONSUMERS"

The Accord for years was Honda's top-selling model in the United States. Within the past year, U.S. sales of the Honda CR-V compact utility vehicle have eclipsed the aging Accord as Honda has expanded production capacity for the former. [nL1N1CI1GM]

Passenger car sales have steadily declined since 2012 when they made up 51.2 percent of the U.S. market. Sedans have sagged to a 38.1 percent share in the first half of this year. IHS Markit said U.S. consumer loyalty to SUVs and pickup trucks has risen since 2012, but declined for sedans. (For a graphic, see: http://tmsnrt.rs/2tNZJ9J)

The new Accord and Camry "may stem the decline," said IHS Markit's Tom Libby. "I don't think they will cause a marked reverse."

Improvements to the Accord should boost sales at Galpin Honda in San Fernando, California, general manager Ed Hartoonian said. The dealership sells about 500 Accords and Civics, combined, per month and Accord sales are up nearly 13 percent so far this year, he said.

"As a dealer we can't ask for much more."

UPDATE 3-Global automakers call on China to ease "impossible" electric car rules - Reuters News

{{20170714T085222.876+0000}}UPDATE 3-Global automakers call on China to ease "impossible" electric car rules* Foreign carmakers demand delay to NEV quotas - letter

* Regulator stuck to strict quotas in draft in June

* China pushing NEV market to compete with US, Europe, Japan

* Carmakers demand ability to buy electric car credits

(Adds no comment from China ministry and analyst comment)

By Jan Schwartz and Adam Jourdan

HAMBURG/SHANGHAI, July 14(Reuters) - Global automakers have urged China to delay and soften planned quotas for sales of electric and hybrid cars, saying its proposals will be impossible to meet and would severely disrupt their businesses, according to a letter seen by Reuters.

The June 18 letter addressed to the head of China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, is the most cohesive pushback yet from the industry against ambitious targets for so-called new energy vehicles in the world's biggest auto market.

Keen to combat air pollution, China is planning to set goals for electric and plug-in hybrid cars to make up at least a fifth of Chinese auto sales by 2025, with a staggered system of quotas beginning in 2018. [nL4N1HX1HS]

Beijing also sees the policy as a means to help the domestic car industry to compete with foreign rivals that have decades more experience in internal combustion engines.

The strict new rules plus planned harsh penalties for non-compliance, such as the cancellation of licences to sell non- electric cars in China, has the potential to cause much pain for some automakers in the market.

"This will hit the industry pretty hard, especially well-known companies," said Liping Kang, senior manager at the Innovation Center for Energy and Transportation, a Beijing-based think tank.

Although Chinese Premier Li Keqiang and German Chancellor Angela Merkel agreed last month that concessions would be made, the ministry later released draft regulations upholding the strict sales quotas. [nL3N1JA3H7]

"The proposed rules' ambitious enforcement date is not possible to meet," the letter from U.S., European, Japanese and Korean auto industry bodies said.

"At a minimum, the mandate needs to be delayed a year and include additional flexibilities."

The ministry declined to comment.

The targets demand firms sell electric or plug-in hybrid vehicles to generate "credits" equivalent to 8 percent of total sales by 2018, 10 percent by 2019 and 12 percent by 2020.

EQUAL TREATMENT

The auto industry bodies also asked for China to reconsider some of the penalties for not achieving the quotas, such as plans to ban carmakers from importing and producing non-new energy vehicles altogether.

They also called for equal treatment of Chinese and foreign makers. Currently foreign carmakers are excluded from getting full subsidies for new energy vehicles and batteries, leaving manufacturers such as Tesla at a disadvantage.

"This preference for domestic automakers over import automakers undermines the environmental goals of the regulation, puts imports at a competitive disadvantage, and risks opening China up to international trade disputes," the letter said.

Chinese manufacturers are the biggest producers of electric vehicles worldwide, making 43 percent of the total last year, according to consultancy McKinsey & Co.

The letter was signed by the American Automotive Policy Council, the European Automobile Manufacturers Association, the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association and the Korea Automobile Manufacturers Association.

European carmakers such as Daimler have responded to the Chinese proposals by announcing plans to ramp up local production of electric cars, while Tesla has said it is in talks with the Shanghai Municipal government to try to avoid a 25 percent tariff on imported vehicles. [nL1N1JJ0WG]

Foreign manufacturers also want more credit given to plug-in hybrid cars, and for carmakers to be allowed to "bank" credits accrued from already sold cars as well as to "carry forward" credits into subsequent model years.

The letter was first reported by Germany's WirtschaftsWoche magazine. [nL8N1K42J0]

Fiat Chrysler, Toyota, Daimler lead European car sales rise - Reuters News

{{20170714T060003.109+0000}}Fiat Chrysler, Toyota, Daimler lead European car sales riseBERLIN, July 14 (Reuters) - European car sales edged up 2.1 percent in June, with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and Toyota <7203.T> posting strong gains amid mixed signals from the region's top five markets, according to industry data published on Friday.

Registrations rose to 1.54 million cars last month in the European Union (EU) and European Free Trade Association (EFTA) countries, Brussels-based industry body ACEA said, from 1.51 million a year earlier. Half-year sales were up 4.6 percent to 8.46 million autos.

In the 28-nation EU excluding Malta, registrations climbed 2.1 percent to 1.49 million vehicles, the highest level since 2007, the last year before the region's six-year slump.

Among major automotive groups, Toyota recorded the biggest monthly rise with a 12.9 percent gain, followed by Fiat Chrysler with 7.9 percent and Daimler with 4.2 percent.

Still grappling with its diesel emissions scandal, Volkswagen , Europe's largest carmaking group, saw deliveries rising 2.7 percent. Growth was held back by a 0.5 percent gain at the core namesake brand and a 1.4 percent drop at luxury division Audi .

French rivals PSA Peugeot Citroen and Renault grew 3.9 and 3 percent respectively while General Motors' Opel division declined 6.9 percent as it nears its acquisition by PSA.

Registrations fell in the region's two largest markets Germany and Britain, by 3.5 percent and 4.8 percent, while Italy, France and Spain posted gains of 12.9 percent, 1.6 percent and 6.5 percent respectively, according to ACEA.

U.S. FCC approves new spectrum for vehicle radar systems - Reuters News

{{20170713T181622.204+0000}}U.S. FCC approves new spectrum for vehicle radar systemsBy David Shepardson

WASHINGTON, July 13 (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Communications Commission on Thursday approved allocating a larger consolidated block of spectrum for use by motor vehicle and aircraft radar systems to help avoid crashes.

The FCC first approved 1 GHz of spectrum in 1995 for motor vehicles to use radar that allowed for the introduction of collision avoidance and adaptive cruise control systems that are credited with preventing tens of thousands of crashes annually.

Thursday's decision expands the band that vehicle radars can operate to 5 GHz of spectrum and will improve lane departure warning, blind spot detection systems, automatic braking and pedestrian detection, the FCC said.

In 2016, some 20 automakers reached a voluntary agreement with U.S. auto safety regulators to make collision-avoiding braking systems standard equipment by 2022, a move that could eliminate 1 million crashes a year.

FCC Chairman Ajit Pai said the agency was giving automakers "the bandwidth needed" to allow "proven technologies that enable services like collision avoidance, blind spot monitoring, and lane change assistance" and allow for "new innovations."

Automakers will exit some other smaller portions of spectrum used for some radar systems as part of the expansion after 2022, the FCC said.

The vote harmonizes vehicle spectrum with European rules that could allow automakers to bring technologies to the U.S. market faster, the FCC said.

The decision will also lead to improved aviation safety by boosting foreign object debris detection radars on airport runways and aircraft wingtip radars that can help avoid collisions with objects while moving on airport grounds.

The move was prompted by a petition filed by German auto supplier Robert Bosch GmbH [ROBG.UL] in 2012. Continental AG said the expanded spectrum will allow for "better range separation, range accuracy, angular accuracy, and reliable object discrimination."

FCC Commissioner Michael O'Rielly voted for the change but noted automakers were granted another block of spectrum in 1999 for vehicle-to-vehicle communications, but it has gone largely unused.

In December, the U.S. Transportation Department proposed requiring future new cars and trucks to be able to "talk" to one another, but it has not been finalized.

Automakers are pursuing technologies to assist drivers in avoiding crashes while working on fully self-driving cars.

U.S. traffic deaths jumped 8 percent in the first nine months of 2016, following a spike in 2015 when road deaths had their highest full-year increase since 1966. In 2015, total U.S. traffic crashes rose by 4 percent to 6.3 million.

Foreign carmakers call on China to soften electric car quotas - Reuters News

{{20170713T135803.996+0000}}Foreign carmakers call on China to soften electric car quotasFRANKFURT, July 13 (Reuters) - Global automotive manufacturers have appealed to the Chinese government to soften proposals for electric and hybrid car quotas, a letter seen by Reuters showed.

The letter is a joint protest against China's new energy vehicles (NEVs) proposals, which include a goal for hybrid and electric cars to make up at least a fifth of vehicle sales by 2025 with a staggered system of quotas beginning in 2018. [nL4N1HX1HS]

The letter, addressed to China's Minister of Industry and Information Technology, dated June 18, was signed by the American Automotive Policy Council (AAPC), the European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA), the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association (JAMA) and the Korea Automobile Manufacturers Association (KAMA). "Because we have common concerns with the proposed NEV rules, we have joined together to offer, with utmost respect, six recommended modifications that address those concerns while still meeting the goals of those rules and other related policies," the letter said.

Carmakers have requested a delay to the quota implementation date, asked for the system of credits to become more flexible, and for China to reconsider penalties for not reaching the quotas.

It also called for equal treatment of Chinese and foreign makers of electric cars and batteries.

Carmakers demand changes to China's electric car quota - WirtschaftsWoche - Reuters News

{{20170713T104854.810+0000}}Carmakers demand changes to China's electric car quota - WirtschaftsWocheFRANKFURT, July 13 (Reuters) - The world's four biggest automotive industry associations have written to China's government to demand it change its plans for strict sales quotas for electrically powered vehicles, German weekly magazine WirtschaftsWoche reported, citing the letter.

The associations, based in Europe, the United States, Japan and South Korea and representing around 70 percent of global car production, also called for the quotas to be postponed by at least one to three years, the magazine said on Thursday.

China last month upheld the sales quotas for electric cars in draft regulation, ignoring concessions that had been agreed between Chinese Premier Li Keqiang and German Chancellor Angela Merkel. [nL3N1JA3H7]

The draft says that automakers must sell enough electric or plug-in hybrid vehicles to generate "credits" equivalent to 8 percent of sales by 2018, 10 percent by 2019 and 12 percent by 2020 -- criteria many in the industry deem too ambitious.

The number of credits per car is based on the level of electrification.

According to WirtschaftsWoche, the industry associations are demanding that the Chinese government includes less harsh penalties for failing to reach the sales quota, and that it tailors the quota to each carmaker's production volume to avoid putting companies that make a smaller number of vehicles at a disadvantage.

UPDATE 2-U.S. says 2.7 mln additional Takata air bag inflators to be recalled - 路透新闻

{{20170711T195840.195+0000}}UPDATE 2-U.S. says 2.7 mln additional Takata air bag inflators to be recalled(Adds details on testing, new death disclosed Monday)

By David Shepardson

WASHINGTON, July 11 (Reuters) - The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said Tuesday that new testing is prompting Takata Corp <7312.T> to declare 2.7 million air bag inflators defective in Ford Motor Co , Nissan Motor Co <7201.T> and Mazda Motor Corp <7261.T> vehicles.

Takata air bag inflators are already linked to 17 deaths and more than 180 injuries worldwide, and the recalls will eventually cover about 125 million inflators. The auto safety agency said new testing is prompting the recall of some driver-side air bags built from 2015 through 2012.

Nissan said it will recall 627,000 Versa cars from 2007-2012 model years, including 515,000 in the United States "out of an abundance of caution." It will notify owners within 60 days with additional instructions.

Ford spokesman John Cangany said the issue covers about 2.2 million Ford vehicles, and the company has five days to respond to the Takata filing. The automaker is "aware of Takata's submission, and we have been in regular contact with the agency on the issue. Importantly, we aren't aware of any incidents, and test data doesn't suggest any issues," he said.

Mazda said the new recall impacts just 6,000 B-series trucks.

More than 65 percent of 46.2 million previously recalled Takata airbag inflators in the United States have not been repaired. The issue is the largest ever auto safety recall covering 17 automakers. Takata filed for bankruptcy protection in June.

Takata inflator ruptures occur after long-term exposure to high humidity, NHTSA has said.

Prior Takata recalls have involved air bag inflators without a drying agent. The new 2.7 million air bag inflators being recalled involve a drying agent, but Takata said testing showed ruptures could still take place.

"Takata has told the public that their line of air bag inflators with moisture absorbent was safe. This recall now raises serious questions about the threat posed by all of Takata's ammonium nitrate-based airbags," U.S. Senator Bill Nelson said in a statement. "If even more are found to be defective, it will take us from the biggest recall ever to something that could become mind-boggling."

Honda Motor Co <7267.T> said Monday it had confirmed an 11th U.S. death involving one of its vehicles tied to a faulty Takata air bag inflator. [nL1N1K1146]

Takata expects to recall by 2019 about 125 million vehicles worldwide, including more than 60 million in the United States, Scott Caudill, chief operating officer of TK Holdings, Takata's U.S. unit, said in June.

U.S. House panel to unveil self-driving car legislation soon -aide - 路透新闻

{{20170711T100001.436+0000}}U.S. House panel to unveil self-driving car legislation soon -aideBy David Shepardson

WASHINGTON, July 11 (Reuters) - U.S. House Republicans expect to introduce bills later this week that would bar states from setting their own rules for self-driving cars and take other steps to remove obstacles to putting such vehicles on the road, a spokeswoman said.

The legislative action comes as major automakers are joining forces with auto suppliers and other groups to prod Congress into action.

Last month, a U.S. House of Representatives Energy and Commerce subcommittee held a hearing on a Republican draft package of 14 bills that would allow U.S. regulators to exempt up to 100,000 vehicles a year per manufacturer from federal motor vehicle safety rules that prevent the sale of self-driving vehicles without human controls.

Blair Ellis, a spokeswoman for the committee, said on Monday it was likely that legislation would be introduced this week and a formal hearing on the bills would occur next week.

Republican U.S. Representative Robert Latta said last month he hoped to win committee approval of a bipartisan legislative package by the end of July.

The draft measures would bar states from setting self-driving rules and prevent the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration from pre-approving self-driving car technologies.

Democrats say the NHTSA must play a more aggressive role in mandating self-driving car safety.

The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a group representing General Motors Co , Volkswagen AG , Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T> and others, and the Association of Global Automakers, representing major foreign automakers including Honda Motor Co <7267.T> and Hyundai Motor Corp <005380.KS>, are forming the Coalition for Future Mobility to press Congress to act.

The group, which includes the Motor & Equipment Manufacturers Association, National Federation of the Blind and Securing America's Future Energy, a group of corporate officials and retired military leaders, plans to begin airing radio ads on Tuesday portraying the legislation as "liberating innovation for self-driving vehicles."

GM, Alphabet Inc , Tesla Inc and others have been lobbying Congress to pre-empt rules under consideration in California and other states that could limit self-driving vehicle deployment.

The administration of former Democratic President Barack Obama last year unveiled voluntary guidelines on self-driving cars. President Donald Trump's transportation secretary, Elaine Chao, has said she plans to quickly update those.

UPDATE 2-Honda confirms 11th U.S. death tied to ruptured Takata air bag inflator - 路透新闻

{{20170710T181405.289+0000}}UPDATE 2-Honda confirms 11th U.S. death tied to ruptured Takata air bag inflator(Adds judge naming special master to oversee Takata compensation funds)

By David Shepardson

WASHINGTON, July 10 (Reuters) - Honda Motor Co <7267.T> said on Monday it had confirmed an 11th U.S. death involving one of its vehicles tied to a faulty Takata Corp <7312.T> air bag inflator.

The Japanese automaker said the incident occurred in Florida in June 2016 when an individual was working on repairs on a 2001 Honda Accord and the air bag ruptured. At least 17 deaths and 180 injuries worldwide are now tied to the defect that prompted the largest ever auto safety recall and led Takata to file for bankruptcy protection last month.

Takata inflators can explode with excessive force, unleashing metal shrapnel inside cars and trucks

The Honda Accord was among a group of more than 300,000 unrepaired recalled Honda vehicles equipped with inflators with a substantial risk of rupturing. Honda said the vehicle's registered owners had received at least 12 recall notices but never got recommended repairs.

The individual working on the vehicle in Florida died a day after sustaining injuries when the air bag deployed.

Last year, the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) urged owners to stop driving the "unsafe" cars until they were fixed. NHTSA said 2001-2003 model Honda and Acura vehicles have as high as a 50 percent chance of a dangerous air bag inflator rupture in a crash.

Of the deaths linked to Takata's inflators, 16 took place in Honda vehicles since May 2009, including five in Malaysia using a different type Takata inflator, while one death occurred in a Ford Motor Co vehicle in South Carolina in December 2015.

Separately, a federal judge in Detroit on Monday said he planned to name law professor Eric D. Green to oversee $975 million in compensation funds for Takata air bag victims and automakers.

Green, who teaches at Harvard, has served as a mediator in many major cases, including the U.S. Microsoft antitrust case, and currently serves as a Justice Department monitor overseeing the implementation of billions of dollars in consumer relief linked to settlements with banks stemming from the 2007-2009 financial crisis.

Scott Caudill, chief operating officer of TK Holdings, Takata's U.S. unit, said in a court affidavit last month in its bankruptcy filing that the company "faces insurmountable claims" relating to the recalls and owes billions of dollars to automakers.

He disclosed that Takata has recalled, or expects to recall, by 2019 about 125 million vehicles worldwide, including more than 60 million in the United States.

Let's make a deal: Automakers, U.S. auctions align to prop up used car prices - 路透新闻

{{20170707T114022.832+0000}}Let's make a deal: Automakers, U.S. auctions align to prop up used car pricesBy Nick Carey

CARLETON, Mich., July 7 (Reuters) - Two lanes apart at a noisy, fast-paced auto auction near Detroit, two vehicles show why major U.S. automakers have a problem with used cars.

In one lane of the Manheim auction facility, a black 2015 Chevy Malibu sedan with barely 20,000 miles on it sold for just over $13,000, less than half its original sticker price. In the other lane, a white 2013 Chevy Silverado pick-up truck sold for $11,500 - despite having 200,000 miles on the odometer.

America's renewed lust for new SUVs and trucks instead of smaller cars is already hurting major auto companies, which posted their fourth consecutive month of declining new vehicle sales.[nL1N1JU104]

But millions cars that were leased two or three years ago, many of them used compact and midsized cars with low mileage, are heading toward auction lots and used car dealerships.

For a graphic, click http://tmsnrt.rs/2pe1E2x

That surge in supply threatens to depress prices for new and used vehicles, raising the risk of losses for automakers and finance companies on lease deals. It also undercuts the value of cars customers want to trade in for a new vehicle. [nL1N1I40JA]

So major carmakers, including General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co , are aligning with auto auction houses with aggressive moves to make sure they are getting the best prices for their vehicles. Such maneuvers include transporting the automobiles to where the greater demand is based on real-time pricing data, spending more to spruce up used cars and slowing the pace which leased cars get moved to used car lots or auction houses.

Auto auction houses such as Manheim in southeastern Michigan are where the romance of new car marketing goes to die. The dominant player in the U.S. auction market along with rival KAR Auction Services Inc , Manheim treats vehicles like commodities, grading them on a fine-tuned scale from one (poor) to five (excellent) that provides dealers with certainty and transparency.

"If a dealer sees a 2015 Ford Fusion with a rating of 4.3, they know what to pay for it and what they can sell it for," said Matt Trapp, a Manheim vice president on a tour of the auction, scanning tags on vehicles with his smartphone to pull up a multitude of transactions for that make, model, year, condition and mileage.

"If you don't want to overbid on this one, wait a minute and another will be right along," he said.

Increasingly, the auction houses and automakers are collaborating to try to raise the scores, and the prices, of vehicles running through auctions. Auction houses have offered add-on reconditioning services on used vehicles for decades, but after the lean years following the Great Recession, demand is rising for those higher-margin services.

Manheim's chief economist Jonathan Smoke says "we can help determine the optimal way to sell their vehicle, which includes location, timing," the level of reconditioning and whether to opt for a physical auction or online auction. Online auctions account for 30 percent of sales at Manheim versus 10 percent three years ago, he added.

$2,700 SEPARATES MEMPHIS AND MIAMI

Armed with detailed, real-time pricing data that was not available during the last downturn, auctioneers can now help automakers figure out where a used car could fetch the best price.

Manheim has an expanded logistics arm that can aggregate cars for transport to the place they'll fetch the highest price at auction, or arrange their sale before they even move.

Jason Ferreri, KAR's executive vice president of online services, said this is happening "significantly more often."

Neither he nor Manheim officials would give specifics. In April, KAR agreed to buy DRIVIN, a data aggregator that matches vehicle inventory to dealer demand, whose founders include Brad Keywell and Eric Lefkofsky, the co-founders of Groupon Inc , for $43 million in stock. [nL1N1HR0D3]

Ferreri said the deal was in response to automakers' demands for greater data services amid the influx of off-lease vehicles. This real-time pricing data helps the companies steer the used cars toward higher demand.

For example, the national price for a 2015 Chevrolet Malibu with average mileage the week of June 11 was $15,514, according to data compiled for Reuters by car-shopping website CarGurus.

In Memphis, that Malibu cost nearly 9 percent above the national average fair price, but in Miami it would sell for more than 9 percent below that price, representing a difference of $2,700.

Manheim's Matt Trapp, whose territory includes the U.S. northeast, says around 40 percent of vehicles coming off leases are returned to dealers within around five hours' drive of New York City. Many are now being shipped to other regions.

In New Jersey, for instance, one in three off-lease vehicles now leaves the state, Trapp says.

"I am not seeing a glut of used cars hitting the market," said Mike Gentry, who buys cars for 20 dealerships in northwest Ohio and attended the Manheim auction outside Detroit. "Automakers have set a floor for pricing and when they can't get that price they ship them 500 miles to where they can get a better price."

MORE PRICING TOOLS IN THE GARAGE

GM spokesman Jim Cain said the company is relying on "a lot more tools" including certified pre-owned vehicles "to support resale values." A Ford spokesman said the company has adopted a "disciplined approach" to maintaining used car values.

Those tools include slowing the flow of vehicles to the used market, which they can afford in the short term as their balance sheets are strong.

"With off-lease vehicles we are not seeing all of them coming to market, some of them are being held back," National Automobile Dealers Association chief economist Steven Szakaly told reporters on a conference call on Thursday.

Automakers also allow their franchised dealers to take first pick of vehicles just coming off a lease before they go to auction. These are usually sold as "certified pre-owned" cars that come with a factory warranty, and a higher price tag than a run-of-the-mill used car.

For vehicles that have suffered wear and tear, auction houses are now preparing for what Manheim's Mandy Savage calls a "tsunami" that will hit the market in the coming years.

At Manheim's body shop here in Carleton, Savage, the facility's general manager, says 90 percent of the vehicles being painted or undergoing small fixes are cars that have just come off lease. Automakers are increasingly willing to spend $500 to boost a car's resale value by $750, she said.

"This is not an art," she said. "It's a science."

But Mark Wakefield, head of the North American automotive practice for consultancy AlixPartners, said propping up used car values makes sense, but automakers will have to do more to stem the flow of used cars longer-term by trimming inventory levels.

"I expect to see more production cuts," he said.

U.S. planned layoffs slow in June - Challenger - 路透新闻

{{20170706T113000.828+0000}}U.S. planned layoffs slow in June - ChallengerBy Kimberly Chin

July 6 (Reuters) - The number of planned layoffs at U.S. firms fell in June to its lowest level of the year as employers opted to hold onto existing jobs in a tight labor market where skilled laborers are harder to find, a report released on Thursday showed.

U.S. companies announced 31,105 planned job cuts in June, a 6.0 percent decline from 33,092 in May, according to outplacement consultancy firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas Inc.

The previous month's figure was downwardly revised from 51,692 after Ford Motor Co reported it would cut 1,400 workers, not 20,000, as initially reported.

Overall, June's job cuts were down 19.3 percent from a year earlier, when 38,536 layoffs were announced in June 2016.

"Some companies are not making their layoffs this year, which they might have done if the labor pool wasn't so stretched, especially for skilled labor," John Challenger, chief executive officer of Challenger, Gray and Christmas, told Reuters.

With the unemployment rate at 4.3 percent, its lowest since May 2001, employers are having a harder time finding the talent they need so they keep existing workers, Challenger said.

The slowdown in layoff activity in June is reflected in the year-to-date totals as well, with the number of planned workforce reductions falling by 28 percent to 227,000 in the first six months of 2017 from more than 313,000 in the first half of 2016.

The technology sector, for instance, reported 23,813 job cuts for the first six months of the year, down 52.5 percent from 50,161 announced in the first half of 2016.

One notable exception is in the retail sector, where announced layoffs in the first half of 2016 are the highest since the recession as big chains such as Macy's Inc close stores and companies restructure to focus on online sales.

The sector had announced 60,127 job cuts through June, a 42 percent increase from the 42,095 cuts reported through the first half of 2016. This represents the highest number of layoffs in the first half since 2009, according to Challenger.

Though the retail sector reported over 5,000 store closings this year, the worst of the layoffs may be behind. Challenger said retailers typically trim their staff in the first quarter after the holiday season before they start to expand again.

U.S. cars a tough sell in S.Korea even as Trump targets trade deal - 路透新闻

{{20170706T080550.206+0000}}U.S. cars a tough sell in S.Korea even as Trump targets trade dealBy Hyunjoo Jin

SEOUL, July 6 (Reuters) - U.S. auto imports from the likes of General Motors and Ford Motor must become more chic, affordable or fuel-efficient to reap the rewards of President Donald Trump's attempts to renegotiate a trade deal with key ally South Korea, officials and industry experts in Seoul say.

Meeting South Korean President Moon Jae-in last week in Washington, Trump said the United States would do more to address trade imbalances with South Korea and create a level playing ground for U.S. businesses, especially carmakers, in the world's 11th largest auto market by sales. [nL1N1JR0T2]

While imports from automakers including Ford, Chrysler and GM more than doubled last year largely thanks to free trade deal which took effect in 2012, sales account for just 1 percent of a market dominated by more affordable models from local giants Hyundai Motor Co <005380.KS> and affiliate Kia Motors Corp <000270.KS>.

Imports make up just 15 percent of the overall Korean auto market, and are mainly more luxurious models from German automakers BMW and Daimler AG's Mercedes-Benz, which also benefit from a trade deal with the European Union.

"Addressing non-tariff barriers would not fundamentally raise the competitiveness of U.S. cars," a senior Korean government official told Reuters, declining to be identified because of the sensitivity of the subject.

"What we really want to say to the United States is: make good cars, make cars that Korean consumers like."

TASTE BARRIER

In Korea, U.S. imports are seen as lagging German brands in brand image, sophistication and fuel economy, industry experts say. U.S. imports do have a competitive advantage in electric cars: Tesla Motors' electric vehicles are seen as both environmentally friendly and trendy, while GM has launched a long-range Bolt EV.

U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross had cited a quota in the current trade deal as an obstacle to boosting imports.

The quota allows U.S. automakers to bring in each year 25,000 vehicles that meet U.S., not necessarily Korean, safety standards. Should GM, for example, decide to bring in more than its quota of one model - the Impala sedans - it would cost up to $75 million to modify the cars to meet Korean safety standards, the company told its local labour union.

Asked about non-tariff barriers, a spokesman at GM's Korean unit said removing them could expand the range of models the company can bring in from the United States.

No U.S. company, however, has yet to make full use of the quota, industry data shows. GM, the most popular U.S. brand, sold only 13,150 U.S.-made vehicles last year.

U.S. cars could also see the benefits of a renegotiated trade deal at a time when diesel-powered cars offered by Volkswagen's are losing appeal following cheating on emissions tests. However, they still need to appeal to the locals, experts say.

"Upgrading their vehicles and meet the luxurious taste of consumers is more important than complaining about non-tariff barriers," said Kim Pil-soo, a professor of engineering at Daelim University College near Seoul.

UPDATE 2-Ford's China sales bounce back in June as tax impact fades  - 路透新闻

{{20170706T062025.246+0000}}UPDATE 2-Ford's China sales bounce back in June as tax impact fades * Ford China sales up 15 pct in June to more than 100,000 vehicles

* Phasing out of tax cut has hurt auto market, especially in Q1

* Ford level of discounting in China in line with industry

(Writes through with details)

By Jake Spring and Norihiko Shirouzu

BEIJING, July 6 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co said its China sales surged 15 percent in June, their strongest pace of the year, and it was optimistic about the outlook for the second half as the industry puts the phasing out of a tax cut behind it.

Peter Fleet, Ford's Asia-Pacific chief, said the first quarter had been difficult after a purchase tax on small-engine cars rose to 7.5 percent from 5 percent previously.

Although Ford's China sales declined 7 percent in the first-half from the same period a year ago, they were up 7 percent in the second quarter.

Sales for June alone climbed to more than 100,000 vehicles with deliveries of sedans including the Escort and Mondeo, which were hurt by the tax increase, improving.

"I would expect to see for the third quarter strong single digit percentage growth (for) the industry. That's certainly how it looks to us based on the run rate and how the month of July has opened up," Fleet said in an interview.

Ford's level of discounting tracked an overall 4 percent price decline for the industry so far this year.

"I'm not interested in driving our prices down to drive market share," Fleet said.

Year-on-year comparisons will "get a bit tricky" in the fourth quarter because sales rose so fast at the end of 2016 as consumers rushed to buy cars before the purchase tax went up, he added.

The purchase tax on small-engine cars is set for another increase back to its normal 10 percent rate in 2018.

Ford aims to focus its efforts on the sport-utility vehicle market, the fastest growing segment in China, with plans to launch a new version of the EcoSport small SUV later this year.

Outside of China, Ford continues to post positive sales growth in Southeast Asia, India and Australia, he said.

Tesla's Model S fails to ace some tests in IIHS evaluation - 路透新闻

{{20170706T040118.533+0000}}Tesla's Model S fails to ace some tests in IIHS evaluationJuly 6 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc's Model S did not get the top score in certain tests by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS), the agency said on Thursday.

Chevrolet Impala, Ford Motor Co's Taurus and Tesla's Model S were the three sedans that got "only an acceptable rating" in a test designed to simulate what happens when the front driver-side corner of a vehicle strikes a tree or another vehicle, the IIHS said.

Ford's Lincoln Continental, the Mercedes-Benz E-Class and Toyota Motor Corp's <7203.T> Avalon received the highest rating overall, the agency said.

In the test, the seat belt in Tesla's Model S was not effective and could lead to the driver's head striking the steering wheel hard through the air bag, according to the report.

Tesla's Model S received the highest rating in IIHS's crash testing in every category except one, the small overlap front crash test, where it received the second highest rating available, a Tesla spokesperson said in an email.

"IIHS and dozens of other private industry groups around the world have methods and motivations that suit their own subjective purposes," the spokesperson said.

Tesla said the most objective and accurate independent vehicle safety test is done by the U.S. government, which found Model S and Model X to have the lowest probability of injury of any cars that it has ever tested.

In order to get the top IIHS rating, automakers must have a frontal crash prevention system with automatic braking capabilities to prevent a rear-end collision.

The vehicles must stop or slow down without driver intervention before hitting a target in tests at 12 or 25 miles per hour among other factors, IIHS said.

Toyota said in a statement it is committed to developing safe and reliable vehicles.

General Motors Co declined to comment, while Ford and Mercedes were not immediately available for comment.

The IIHS is a research arm of the insurance industry, and its crash tests are increasingly influential in guiding vehicle safety design. Automakers strive for top ratings in IIHS tests as they do on federal crash tests.

China's Baidu taps 50 partners to help advance self-driving - 路透新闻

{{20170705T160840.758+0000}}China's Baidu taps 50 partners to help advance self-drivingBy Paul Lienert

DETROIT, July 5 (Reuters) - Baidu Inc , the top Chinese internet search firm, has formed a broad alliance to promote self-driving cars, pitting its Apollo platform against Alphabet Inc's system, it said on Wednesday, in hopes of getting the vehicles on the road in China by 2019.

The alliance includes partnerships with automakers, suppliers, startups, universities and local governments and is built around Baidu's Apollo self-driving platform, which was developed at its tech center in California's Silicon Valley. Apollo is aimed at Alphabet's Waymo self-driving package. [nL1N1JJ12L]

Among the key development partners on Apollo are Nvidia Corp , which specializes in microprocessors and artificial intelligence, and mapping expert TomTom NV .

In mid-morning trade, Nvidia shares were up 2.6 percent to $142.94 and Baidu U.S. shares rose 2.3 percent to $184.15. In Amsterdam, TomTom was up 3.2 percent to 8.85 euros.

Ford Motor Co and Daimler AG also are partners, Baidu said, as well as supplier Delphi Automotive and chipmaker Intel Corp .

Baidu said at a briefing in Beijing it is partnering with five Chinese vehicle manufacturers, including Chery Automobile [CHERY.UL], BAIC Motor <1958.HK>, FAW Group Corp [SASACJ.UL], Chongqing Changan Automobile <000625.SZ> and Great Wall Motor <601633.SS>. All but Great Wall are state-owned.

German suppliers Robert Bosch [ROBG.UL], Continental Automotive and ZF Friedrichshafen [ZFF.UL] are also part of the alliance.

Baidu has said its goal is to get self-driving vehicles on the road in China, possibly by 2019, and eventually in other markets, including the United States.

Baidu is an investor in Nio, a Silicon Valley electric vehicle startup also backed by China's Tencent Holdings <0700.HK> and Lenovo <0992.HK>. Nio hopes to put its first self-driving cars on U.S. roads in 2020.

Two weeks ago, top officials from Baidu and Chery met in Silicon Valley to sign an agreement to collaborate on the development of intelligent, internet-connected vehicles, according to a source familiar with the companies' plans.

Chery has installed Baidu's self-driving software in several prototype cars in China and they could further deepen their relationship to include manufacturing.

UK car sales fall in June for third month in a row - 路透新闻

{{20170705T081659.902+0000}}UK car sales fall in June for third month in a rowLONDON, July 5 (Reuters) - British new car registrations fell by an annual 4.8 percent in June, the first time in six years sales have fallen for three months in a row as the market cools from record highs, an industry body said on Wednesday.

A total of 243,454 vehicles were sold last month according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) as demand among individual consumers dropped 7.8 percent and business fleet demand fell 2.4 percent.

In the first half of the year, demand dropped 1.3 percent with the SMMT expecting full-year numbers to decline by 2.6 percent to 2.62 million sales, according to a forecast published earlier this year.

Sales hit a record high last year, boosted by cheap credit and strong consumer confidence which has fallen after a rise in inflation, the inconclusive outcome of June's national election and as Brexit talks begin.

A vehicle duty tax rise which came into effect in April also distorted the market this year, pushing up sales to an all-time high in March before a subsequent slump of 20 percent in April.

UPDATE 1-Geely's Volvo to go all electric with new models from 2019 - 路透新闻

{{20170705T075357.493+0000}}UPDATE 1-Geely's Volvo to go all electric with new models from 2019* All new models to be electric or hybrids from 2019

* To launch five new electric cars in 2019-2021

(Adds CEO comment, detail, background)

By Niklas Pollard

STOCKHOLM, July 5 (Reuters) - All Volvo car models launched after 2019 will be electric or hybrids, the Chinese-owned company said on Wednesday, making it the first major traditional automaker to set a date for phasing out vehicles powered solely by the internal combustion engine.

The Sweden-based company will continue to produce pure combustion-engine Volvos from models launched before that date, but its move signals the eventual end of nearly a century of Volvos powered solely that way.

While electric and hybrid vehicles are still only a small fraction of new cars sales, they are gaining ground at the premium end of the market, where Volvo operates and where Elon Musk's Tesla Motors has been a pure-play battery carmaker from day one. As technology improves and prices fall, many in the industry expect mass-market adoption to follow.

"This announcement marks the end of the solely combustion engine-powered car," Volvo Cars CEO Hakan Samuelsson said.

The company, owned by Zhejiang Geely Holding Group [GEELY.UL], said five new models set to be launched in 2019 through 2021 - three of them Volvos and two Polestar-branded - would all be fully electric.

"These five cars will be supplemented by a range of petrol and diesel plug in hybrid and mild hybrid 48-volt options on all models," Volvo said. "This means that there will in future be no Volvo cars without an electric motor."

The electric models will be produced at Volvo plants world-wide - it has factories in Europe and China and is building one in the United States - while development costs will be met from within its existing budget, Samuelsson told Reuters.

"This also means we won't be doing other things. We of course will not be developing completely new generations of combustion engines," he said about future investment needs.

Volvo has invested heavily in new models and plants since being bought by Geely from Ford in 2010, establishing a niche in a premium auto market dominated by larger rivals such as Daimler's Mercedes-Benz and BMW .

Part of its strategy has also been to embrace emerging technologies that allow higher performance electric vehicles as well as, eventually, self-driving cars.

Only last month, Volvo said it would reshape its Polestar business into a standalone brand, focused on high-performance electric cars aimed at competing with Tesla and the Mercedes AMG division. [nL8N1JI0NV]

Volvo has also said it will build its first fully electric car in China based on its architecture for smaller cars which will be available for sale in 2019 and exported globally.

Still, Volvo is not alone among traditional carmakers in pushing strongly into electrics and plug-ins – or among premium brands in resorting to 48V mild hybrid systems to lower fuel consumption and CO2 emissions from their combustion-engine cars.

Among them, BMW plans to introduce an electric version of its popular 3 series in September to meet the challenge from Tesla, Handelsblatt reported last month. [nL8N1JP5HI]

Volvo has also taken steps towards an eventual listing, raising 5 billion crowns from Swedish institutional investors through the sale of newly issued preference shares last year, though the company has said no decision on an IPO has been made.

"It is still an option and a question for our owner," Samuelsson said.

CORRECTED-Geely's Volvo to go all electric with new models from 2019 - 路透新闻

{{20170705T061838.390+0000}}CORRECTED-Geely's Volvo to go all electric with new models from 2019(Corrects in paragraph 5 to say models will be fully electric)

STOCKHOLM, July 5 (Reuters) - Geely-owned Volvo Car Group said on Wednesday all new models launched from 2019 will be fully electric or hybrids, spelling the eventual end to nearly a century of Volvos powered solely by the internal combustion engine.

The Gothenburg-based company will continue to produce pure combustion-engine Volvos from models launched before that date, but said it would introduce cars across its model line-up that ranged from fully electric cars to plug-in hybrids.

Volvo's plans make it the first major traditional automaker to set a date for the complete phase-out of combustion-engine-only models though electrification has long been a buzzword across the industry and Elon Musk's Tesla Motors has been a pure-play battery carmaker from day one.

"This announcement marks the end of the solely combustion engine-powered car," Volvo Cars Chief Executive Hakan Samuelsson said in a statement.

Five new models set to be launched in 2019 through 2021 - three of them Volvos and two Polestar-branded - will all be fully electric.

"These five cars will be supplemented by a range of petrol and diesel plug in hybrid and mild hybrid 48-volt options on all models," Volvo said.

"This means that there will in future be no Volvo cars without an electric motor."

Volvo has invested heavily in new models and plants since being bought by Zhejiang Geely Holding Group from Ford Motor Co. in 2010, establishing a niche in a premium auto market dominated by larger rivals such as Daimler's Mercedes-Benz and BMW .

Part of its strategy has also been to embrace emerging technologies which allow higher performance electric vehicles as well as, eventually, self-driving cars.

Only last month, Volvo said it would reshape its Polestar business into a standalone brand, focused on high-performance electric cars aimed at competing with Tesla and the Mercedes AMG division. [nL8N1JI0NV]

Volvo has also taken steps towards an eventual listing, raising 5 billion crowns from Swedish institutional investors through the sale of newly issued preference shares last year, though the company has said no decision on an IPO has been made.

Australia new vehicle sales surge to record in June - 路透新闻

{{20170705T021618.739+0000}}Australia new vehicle sales surge to record in JuneSYDNEY, July 5 (Reuters) - Australian new vehicle sales jumped to a record in June, a second straight month of bumper results that augured well for consumer demand across the economy.

The Australian Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries' VFACTS report out on Wednesday showed 134,171 new vehicles were sold in June, up 4.4 percent on the same month last year. Both months had the same number of selling days.

June is typically a strong month as dealers clear stock for the end of the financial year.

Sales of sports utilities alone surged 11.7 percent in June, with the upper large segment rising almost 21 percent. Sales of light commercial vehicles climbed 12.2 percent while the heavy vehicle market gained 9.2 percent.

The willingness to splash out on big-ticket items follows upbeat reports on retail sales for both April and May and points to a likely rebound in consumption for the second quarter after a muted start to the year.

Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T> retained first place on the sales ladder with 18.3 percent of the market, while Mazda Motor Corp <7261.T> had another strong month taking 9.3 percent.

Hyundai Motor <005380.KS> took third spot with an improved share of 9.1 percent. The Holden unit of General Motors tied with Mitsubishi <7211.T> on 6.9 percent, while Ford trailed with 6.6 percent.

UPDATE 1-Canadian auto sales jump in June, racking up another record - 路透新闻

{{20170704T211051.544+0000}}UPDATE 1-Canadian auto sales jump in June, racking up another record(Adds automakers, quote, details)

OTTAWA, July 4 (Reuters) - Canadian auto sales set another record in June, making for a solid performance in the first half of the year as customer demand for light trucks was strong, despite a decline in passenger car sales, data showed on Tuesday.

Automakers sold 203,500 vehicles in June, up 6.5 percent from the year before and a record performance for the month, Canadian auto analyst Dennis DesRosiers wrote in a note.

Since the start of the year, car makers have sold 1.04 million vehicles in Canada, up 5 percent from the same time frame a year ago and the first time over a million new vehicles have been purchased in the first half of the year, DesRosiers said.

In contrast, U.S. auto sales fell for a fourth consecutive month in June, despite hefty consumer discounts, the major automakers reported on Monday. [nL1N1JU104]

While car sales in Canada have posted a record in nearly every month of 2017 so far, it is not immune to the different picture that is forming in the United States, DesRosiers said.

"Surpassing 2016 as an all-time record setting year may not be a foregone conclusion should Canada start to follow that trend in the latter half of the year," DesRosiers.

Light truck sales increased 8.8 percent year-to-date, while passenger car sales were down 2 percent, according to DesRosiers.

The increase in sales of pickup trucks points to improving business investment prospects in the country's energy sector, said Scotiabank senior economist Carlos Gomes.

Gomes recently raised his 2017 Canadian sales forecast to 2 million vehicles from 1.94 million as the Prairie provinces recover from the drop in oil prices that began in 2014.

Ford Motor Co said on Tuesday it sold 32,777 vehicles in Canada last month, up 14.1 percent from the year before as sales of its sport utility vehicles (SUV) rose.

General Motors Co sold 27,151 vehicles last month, up 4.2 percent from a year ago as dealerships also saw increased demand for pickup trucks and compact SUVs.

For the first six months of the year, total sales were up 15.6 percent, GM said, the strongest first half of the year since 2008, just before the global financial crisis hit.

Fiat Chrysler bucked the trend with total sales of 26,926 vehicles in June, down 7 percent from the year before as sales of its Jeep brand declined.

UPDATE 3-U.S. auto sales fall for fourth straight month in June - 路透新闻

{{20170703T201527.697+0000}}UPDATE 3-U.S. auto sales fall for fourth straight month in June(Adds official data, recasts first paragraph)

By Nick Carey

DETROIT, July 3 (Reuters) - Major automakers on Monday reported a fourth consecutive month of lower U.S. new vehicle sales for June and came in below analyst expectations, despite hefty consumer discounts and looser loan terms, providing fresh evidence that 2017 will fall short of last year's record year for the industry.

Automakers' shares rose, however, as retail sales to consumers were relatively stable at the U.S. automakers, with General Motors Co asserting that the industry was set for a stronger finish to the year.

Industry consultant Autodata put the industry's seasonally adjusted annualized rate of sales at 16.51 million units, which was the lowest rate since February 2015. It came in below Wall Street expectations of 16.6 million vehicles and 2 percent lower than the June 2016 figure.

U.S. consumers continued to shun passenger cars in favor of larger pickup trucks, SUVs and crossovers. Passenger car sales were also hurt as some automakers, including GM, have moved to reduce relatively low-margin sales to rental agencies.

The U.S. auto industry has been bracing for a downturn after hitting a record 17.55 million new vehicles sold in 2016. A glut of nearly new used vehicles poses competition for new vehicle sales and automakers have relied increasingly on consumer discounts and loosened lending terms.

Car shopping website Edmunds said the average length of a car loan reached a record high of 69.3 months in June.

"It's financially risky, leaving borrowers exposed to being upside down on their vehicles for a large chunk of their loans," said Jessica Caldwell, Edmunds' executive director of industry analysis.

GM said its sales fell about 5 percent versus June 2016, but that the industry would see stronger sales in the second half of 2017 versus the first half.

"U.S. total sales are moderating due to an industry-wide pullback in daily rental sales, but key U.S. economic fundamentals clearly remain positive," said GM chief economist Mustafa Mohatarem. "Under the current economic conditions, we anticipate U.S. retail vehicle sales will remain strong for the foreseeable future."

Ford Motor Co said its June sales were hit by lower fleet sales to rental agencies, businesses and government entities, which fell 13.9 percent, while sales to consumers were flat.

Wall Street analysts worry that the millions of low mileage, off-lease vehicles poised to hit the market between now and the end of 2019 will weigh on future new vehicle sales.

Ford vice president for U.S. marketing, sales and service Mark LaNeve said on a conference call that the automaker has seen little evidence that its competitors are reducing their reliance on leasing to clinch a sale.

GM shares added 1.8 percent on Monday, while Ford shares rose 3.3 percent.

Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCA) said June sales decreased 7 percent versus the same month a year earlier.

Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T> said sales rose 2.1 percent versus June 2016 and said it saw strong gains in the RAV4, a light SUV, sales of which increased 24.7 percent. Sales of another SUV, the 4Runner, rose 16.6 percent.

But sales at Toyota's Lexus luxury car brand fell 5.4 percent on the year.

Nissan Motor Co Ltd <7201.T> said its U.S. sales increased 2 percent. But while truck, SUV and crossover sales jumped 19.5 percent, sedan sales dropped 12.1 percent.

In the past few years, Americans have increasingly shunned smaller passenger cars in favor of larger vehicles.

Honda Motor Co Ltd <7267.T> said sales for June were up 0.8 percent.

DETROIT, July 3 (Reuters) - Major automakers on Monday posted mixed U.S. new vehicle sales figures for June, with the U.S. automakers reporting lower numbers while the major Japanese automakers said their sales were up versus the same month in 2016.

Automakers' shares rose as retail sales to consumers were relatively stable at the U.S. automakers, with General Motors Co asserting that the industry was set for a stronger finish to the year. Wall Street expectations were for a fourth straight month of declining sales in June.

The U.S. auto industry has been bracing for a downturn after hitting a record 17.55 million new vehicles sold in 2016. A glut of nearly new used vehicles poses competition for new vehicle sales and automakers have relied increasingly on high consumer discounts and loosened lending terms.

Major automakers post mixed U.S. June sales figures - 路透新闻

{{20170703T143320.964+0000}}Major automakers post mixed U.S. June sales figuresBy Nick Carey

Detroit, July 3 (Reuters) - General Motors Co , Ford Motor Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV posted declines in U.S. new vehicle sales for June on Monday, while major Japanese automakers reported stronger figures as demand for pickup trucks and crossovers offset a decline in sedan sales.

Automakers' shares rose as overall industry sales still came in above Wall Street expectations.

The U.S. auto industry is bracing for a downturn after hitting a record 17.55 million new vehicles sold in 2016. Analysts had predicted that overall, U.S. vehicle sales would fall in June for the fourth consecutive month.

As the market has shown signs of cooling, automakers have hiked discounts and loosened lending terms.

Car shopping website Edmunds said on Monday the average length of a car loan reached an all-time high of 69.3 months in June.

"It's financially risky, leaving borrowers exposed to being upside down on their vehicles for a large chunk of their loans," said Jessica Caldwell, Edmunds' executive director of industry analysis.

GM said its sales fell about 5 percent versus June 2016, but that the industry would see stronger sales in the second half of 2017 versus the first half.

GM shares were up 2.4 percent in morning trading, while Ford rose 3.3 percent and FCA shares jumped 6 percent.

"U.S. total sales are moderating due to an industry-wide pullback in daily rental sales, but key U.S. economic fundamentals clearly remain positive," said GM chief economist Mustafa Mohatarem. "Under the current economic conditions, we anticipate U.S. retail vehicle sales will remain strong for the foreseeable future."

Ford said its sales for June were hit by lower fleet sales to rental agencies, businesses and government entities, which fell 13.9 percent, while sales to consumers were flat.

On a media call, Ford executives said an initial read of automakers' sales figures indicated a seasonally adjusted annualized rate of around 17 million new vehicles for the month, which would be better than 16.6 million units analysts had predicted.

FCA said June sales decreased 7 percent versus the same month a year earlier.

Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T> said sales rose 2.1 percent versus June 2016 and said it saw strong gains in the RAV4, a light SUV, sales of which increased 24.7 percent. Sales of another SUV, the 4Runner, rose 16.6 percent.

But sales at Toyota's Lexus luxury car brand fell 5.4 percent on the year.

REFILE-RPT-High-tech dashboards signal big changes for auto parts suppliers - 路透新闻

{{20170630T173926.323+0000}}REFILE-RPT-High-tech dashboards signal big changes for auto parts suppliers(Corrects spelling of IHS Markit in fifth paragraph)

By Alexandria Sage

SAN FRANCISCO, June 29 (Reuters) - Peer at the instrument panel on your new car and you may find sleek digital gauges and multicolored screens. But a glimpse behind the dashboard could reveal what U.S. auto supplier Visteon Corp found: a mess.

As automotive cockpits become crammed with ever more digital features such as navigation and entertainment systems, the electronics holding it all together have become a rat's nest of components made by different parts makers.

Now the race is on to clean up the clutter.

Visteon is among a slew of suppliers aiming to make dashboard innards simpler, cheaper and lighter as the industry accelerates toward a so-called virtual cockpit - an all-digital dashboard that will help usher in the era of self-driving cars.

What's at stake is a piece of the $37-billion cockpit electronics market, estimated by research firm IHS Markit to nearly double to $62 billion by 2022. Accounting firm PwC estimates that electronics could account for up to 20 percent of a car's value in the next two years, up from 13 percent in 2015.

Meanwhile, the number of suppliers for those components is likely to dwindle as automakers look to work with fewer companies capable of doing more, according to Mark Boyadjis, principal automotive analyst at IHS Markit.

"The complexity of engineering ten different systems from ten different suppliers is no longer something an automaker wants to do," Boyadjis said.

He estimates manufacturers eventually will work with two to three cockpit suppliers for each model, down from six to 10 today.

DIGITAL MAKEOVER

One of Visteon's solutions is a computer module dubbed "SmartCore." This cockpit domain controller operates a vehicle's instrument cluster, infotainment system and other features, all on the same tiny piece of silicon.

So far this year, the Detroit-based company has landed two big contracts for undisclosed sums. One, announced in April, is with China's second-largest automaker, Dongfeng Motor Corp. The other is with Mercedes-Benz , Reuters has learned. Mercedes did not respond to requests for comment. Another unnamed European automaker plans to use the system in 2018, according to Visteon.

Visteon is going all in on cockpit electronics, having shed its remaining automotive climate and interiors businesses in 2016. The bet so far is paying off. The company secured $1.5 billion in new business in the first quarter, helped by growth in China. Visteon's stock price is up more than 50 percent over the past year.

It's a major turnaround since Visteon was spun off from Ford Motor Co a decade ago. Visteon filed for bankruptcy protection in 2009 before emerging a year later.

"You have to be changing and adapting fast. If not, you're not going to keep up in this market," said Tim Yerdon, Visteon's head of global marketing. "It's about reinventing yourself to stay ahead."

DASHBOARD DEALS

Visteon's makeover hints at the coming battle between suppliers fighting for real estate in the digital cockpit. The trend is already triggering acquisitions, as companies look to boost their offerings to automakers.

Visteon in 2014 bought Johnson Controls' electronics business, which was also developing a domain controller. In March, Samsung <005930.KS> completed its $8-billion purchase of infotainment company Harman. France's Faurecia , a top seating and interiors supplier, last year purchased a 20 percent stake in Paris-based infotainment firm Parrot Automotive SAS in a deal that could make Faurecia the biggest shareholder by 2019.

Deal-making in the wider automotive sector has been at a fever pitch over the past two years fueled by the race to develop autonomous vehicle technology. [nL1N1HK206] Activity in the sector was worth $41 billion in 2016, according to PwC.

Analysts say German automakers are taking the lead in consolidating functions within the dashboard. Audi was the first to debut a virtual cockpit last year that combined its instrument cluster and infotainment system.

CHEAPER, LIGHTER, SMARTER

Streamlined dashboards can lead to cost reductions for manufacturers, who can save as much as $175 per car with an integrated cockpit, according to Munich-based management consulting firm Roland Berger.

They can also help with fuel efficiency. That's because vehicles are lighter when there are fewer behind-the-scenes computers, known as electronic control units (ECUs). Vehicles today contain 80 to 120 ECUs, numbers expected to fall sharply in coming years.

But perhaps the biggest motivation for fancy cockpits is sales. Drivers accustomed to the seamless technology of their smartphones are finding today's dashboard offerings clunky and non-intuitive. A J.D. Power study released this month found the most complaints from new vehicle owners stemmed from audio, communications, entertainment and maps systems.

Better cockpits could prove crucial to attracting younger consumers, who are not showing the same enthusiasm for cars, or even driving, that their parents did. Research company Mintel found that 41 percent of millennial car buyers are interested in having the latest technology in their vehicles.

Disjointed dashboards "are one of the most noticeable gaps in user experience - what you see right in front of you," said Andrew Hart of UK-based consultancy SBD Automotive.

On many car models, he said, audible warning systems to alert the driver to a potential collision are not in sync with the radio, meaning your favorite song could drown out the warning beep.

"That's a crazy example of something when you don't consolidate ECUs," Hart said.

Industry watchers say this and other safe-driving features are among the systems ripe for integration. Additional targets include rear-seat entertainment systems and so-called heads-up displays that project data such as the car's speed onto the windshield for easy viewing.

Back in Detroit, Visteon says it is in talks with carmakers in China and Europe for its domain controller, a technology it hopes can give it an edge over rivals such as Delphi , Robert Bosch [ROBG.UL], Continental , and Denso <6902.T>.

While it isn't clear who will prevail, electronics suppliers are seeing their products take on new importance as vehicles become more connected.

Five years ago, the dashboard was "a plastic molded cockpit that we stuffed electronics into," said Yerdon, Visteon's marketing chief. "Now it's more about an electronic architecture that's experience-driven, and we mold plastic around it."

What's at stake is a piece of the $37-billion cockpit electronics market, estimated by research firm IHS Markit to nearly double to $62 billion by 2022. Accounting firm PwC estimates that electronics could account for up to 20 percent of a car's value in the next two years, up from 13 percent in 2015.

Meanwhile, the number of suppliers for those components is likely to dwindle as automakers look to work with fewer companies capable of doing more, according to Mark Boyadjis, principal automotive analyst at IHS Markit.

"The complexity of engineering ten different systems from ten different suppliers is no longer something an automaker wants to do," Boyadjis said.

He estimates manufacturers eventually will work with two to three cockpit suppliers for each model, down from six to 10 today.

DIGITAL MAKEOVER

One of Visteon's solutions is a computer module dubbed "SmartCore." This cockpit domain controller operates a vehicle's instrument cluster, infotainment system and other features, all on the same tiny piece of silicon.

So far this year, the Detroit-based company has landed two big contracts for undisclosed sums. One, announced in April, is with China's second-largest automaker, Dongfeng Motor Corp. The other is with Mercedes-Benz , Reuters has learned. Mercedes did not respond to requests for comment. Another unnamed European automaker plans to use the system in 2018, according to Visteon.

Visteon is going all in on cockpit electronics, having shed its remaining automotive climate and interiors businesses in 2016. The bet so far is paying off. The company secured $1.5 billion in new business in the first quarter, helped by growth in China. Visteon's stock price is up more than 50 percent over the past year.

It's a major turnaround since Visteon was spun off from Ford Motor Co a decade ago. Visteon filed for bankruptcy protection in 2009 before emerging a year later.

"You have to be changing and adapting fast. If not, you're not going to keep up in this market," said Tim Yerdon, Visteon's head of global marketing. "It's about reinventing yourself to stay ahead."

DASHBOARD DEALS

Visteon's makeover hints at the coming battle between suppliers fighting for real estate in the digital cockpit. The trend is already triggering acquisitions, as companies look to boost their offerings to automakers.

Visteon in 2014 bought Johnson Controls' electronics business, which was also developing a domain controller. In March, Samsung <005930.KS> completed its $8-billion purchase of infotainment company Harman. France's Faurecia , a top seating and interiors supplier, last year purchased a 20 percent stake in Paris-based infotainment firm Parrot Automotive SAS in a deal that could make Faurecia the biggest shareholder by 2019.

Deal-making in the wider automotive sector has been at a fever pitch over the past two years fueled by the race to develop autonomous vehicle technology. [nL1N1HK206] Activity in the sector was worth $41 billion in 2016, according to PwC.

Analysts say German automakers are taking the lead in consolidating functions within the dashboard. Audi was the first to debut a virtual cockpit last year that combined its instrument cluster and infotainment system.

CHEAPER, LIGHTER, SMARTER

Streamlined dashboards can lead to cost reductions for manufacturers, who can save as much as $175 per car with an integrated cockpit, according to Munich-based management consulting firm Roland Berger.

They can also help with fuel efficiency. That's because vehicles are lighter when there are fewer behind-the-scenes computers, known as electronic control units (ECUs). Vehicles today contain 80 to 120 ECUs, numbers expected to fall sharply in coming years.

But perhaps the biggest motivation for fancy cockpits is sales. Drivers accustomed to the seamless technology of their smartphones are finding today's dashboard offerings clunky and non-intuitive. A J.D. Power study released this month found the most complaints from new vehicle owners stemmed from audio, communications, entertainment and maps systems.

Better cockpits could prove crucial to attracting younger consumers, who are not showing the same enthusiasm for cars, or even driving, that their parents did. Research company Mintel found that 41 percent of millennial car buyers are interested in having the latest technology in their vehicles.

Disjointed dashboards "are one of the most noticeable gaps in user experience - what you see right in front of you," said Andrew Hart of UK-based consultancy SBD Automotive.

On many car models, he said, audible warning systems to alert the driver to a potential collision are not in sync with the radio, meaning your favorite song could drown out the warning beep.

"That's a crazy example of something when you don't consolidate ECUs," Hart said.

Industry watchers say this and other safe-driving features are among the systems ripe for integration. Additional targets include rear-seat entertainment systems and so-called heads-up displays that project data such as the car's speed onto the windshield for easy viewing.

Back in Detroit, Visteon says it is in talks with carmakers in China and Europe for its domain controller, a technology it hopes can give it an edge over rivals such as Delphi , Robert Bosch [ROBG.UL], Continental , and Denso <6902.T>.

While it isn't clear who will prevail, electronics suppliers are seeing their products take on new importance as vehicles become more connected.

Five years ago, the dashboard was "a plastic molded cockpit that we stuffed electronics into," said Yerdon, Visteon's marketing chief. "Now it's more about an electronic architecture that's experience-driven, and we mold plastic around it."
