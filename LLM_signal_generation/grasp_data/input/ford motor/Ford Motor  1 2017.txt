U.S. Jan auto sales seen down 3 pct, but industry still rolling - 路透新闻

{{20170201T140150.523+0000}}U.S. Jan auto sales seen down 3 pct, but industry still rollingBy Bernie Woodall

DETROIT, Feb 1 (Reuters) - Automakers on Wednesday are likely to report a 3 percent decline in U.S. auto sales for January after a surprisingly strong December stole some thunder from the start of the new year, industry analysts and economists said.

Still, with December's good showing pulling sales from January, normally the weakest month of the year in terms of sales volume, some analysts cautioned against putting too much emphasis on the month's annualized selling rate.

The 11 analysts polled by Reuters in Detroit showed expectations of an annualized selling rate of 17.4 million vehicles. A wider poll of 40 economists by Thomson Reuters showed estimates of 17.55 million vehicles on the annualized basis.

The overall U.S. auto market remained on a roll, with rising sales for the past seven years, and record highs for the past two, they said. Each month, auto sales are an early indicator of U.S. consumer spending.

Last year ended surprisingly strong. December U.S. sales were 18.43 million on a seasonally adjusted annualized basis, far outpacing expectations of 17.7 million vehicles.

A Reuters poll of industry analysts showed expectations that General Motors Co sales fell about 2 percent, and guesses ranged from down 9 percent to up 3 percent.

At Ford Motor Co , analysts expected, on average, that January sales dropped 3 percent, with estimates ranging from down 7 percent to up 2 percent.

Fiat Chrysler Automobiles sales were seen dropping 16 percent, and analysts forecast stretched from between 14 percent and 18 percent.

German carmakers see no way around post-Brexit tariffs - 路透新闻

{{20170131T135347.502+0000}}German carmakers see no way around post-Brexit tariffsBy Edward Taylor and Costas Pitas

FRANKFURT/LONDON, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Germany's auto industry is losing hope that trade tariffs with Britain can be avoided, several executives have told Reuters, despite warnings from British Prime Minister Theresa May that an overly tough stance on post-Brexit commerce would seriously harm the country's EU partners.

"Merkel may force us to walk away from UK profits for the sake of preventing further EU fragmentation," said a senior executive at a German luxury carmaker.

The executive, who asked not to be identified because of the subject's sensitivity, said Brexit looks increasingly likely to be "a disaster" for trade and for German manufacturers.

BMW , along with the Germany-based European arms of GM and Ford , which all have UK plants, know trade barriers would bring large, currently incalculable costs.

Under World Trade Organization (WTO) rules, British exports of complete vehicles could be subject to tariffs of up to 10 percent.

Ford, Britain's biggest engine maker, warned of 2.7 percent duties on engines ahead of last June's Brexit referendum.

Duties on components such as gear boxes and brakes shipped from Britain would likely vary around the 3.7 percent average currently levied by the EU on similar imports from third countries, according to the WTO, unless a preferential deal is struck.

May recently vowed to take Britain out of the EU single market that allows tariff-free trade in order to gain more control over immigration.

At the same time May argued for the "greatest possible" market access. But German Chancellor Angela Merkel responded that London should not get an attractive Brexit deal that might encourage other departures. [nB4N1DJ017]

GERMANS WORST HIT

Much is at stake for carmakers in general, and the Germans in particular. About every other car built in Britain is destined for another EU market. German-owned brands claim more than one-third of UK car sales.

Think tank Civitas estimates that if Britain leaves the EU without a trade deal, German automotive exporters would pay 1.8 billion pounds ($2.3 billion) in tariffs, nearly half the total 3.9 billion pounds faced by EU-based firms.

UK-built vehicles and parts, on the other hand, would be hit by tariffs of around 1.3 billion pounds, according to the group.

But German car bosses are unwilling to undermine Merkel's position. Merkel recently reiterated that EU governments would not negotiate Brexit terms until London had triggered the irreversible "article 50" leaving process, before adding pointedly that business leaders should show similar restraint.

That sentiment was quickly echoed by Matthias Wissmann, head of Germany's influential auto industry lobby, the VDA.

"Everything must be done to allow the unfettered flow of goods and services," he told reporters. "But there is one clear priority: we must stand together among the 27 EU member states."

Wissmann's counterpart at Britain's SMMT car industry group also warned UK lawmakers that BMW, Daimler and VW may not push too hard for free trade.

German carmakers see "Europe as more important than the UK market", SMMT chief Mike Hawes told a parliamentary committee in January. "They will align with what is best for Germany."

BMW employs in the region of 8,000 workers in Britain, including at its plants which export roughly 2.4 billion pounds of vehicles and engines, most notably a large majority of the Mini and Rolls-Royce cars assembled there.

Ford, which has warned against tariffs, builds engines in Dagenham and Bridgend for vehicles assembled in mainland Europe. GM builds Opel/Vauxhall Astras on Britain's west coast and expects Brexit to have wiped $400 million from 2016 earnings.

"We are worried," said a director at the German unit of a major global carmaker. "I don't expect there will be special deals for any industry."

TARIFFS UPON TARIFFS

Trade duties on components, which can cross the Channel several times before a vehicle is assembled, would require costly supply-chain upheaval to avoid a compounding of duties.

Raw castings from mainland Europe are machined into engine blocks at BMW's Hams Hall plant near Birmingham. Many are then shipped to Germany and fitted into cars destined for the UK.

In all, UK car plants purchase 59 percent of their components overseas, and two-thirds of those from the EU, the SMMT says. Even where cross-Channel supply chains stayed viable, border formalities would hurt delivery timings, raising warehousing costs and ultimately consumer prices.

Locally made components would become more attractive for British-built cars, but the UK assembly plants could find it harder to win new vehicle programmes in the first place.

Investing in an assembly line for the British market alone - rather than export - becomes viable only above an annual output of about 150,000 vehicles, industry experts explain.

For many models, Exane BNP analyst Dominic O'Brien said, "the UK market is not necessarily big enough to sustain its own dedicated plant." Again, consumer choice and prices suffer.

Some German carmakers have been more vocal in urging Britain to give ground, stressing attachment to their EU workers' freedom of movement.

"Not only free trade but also cross-border employment opportunities ... are of proven benefit to business," BMW said.

Still, huge unknowns remain, including French and German elections this year that could change the direction of Brexit.

Already there are some signs of dissent within the governing coalition between Merkel's conservative CDU and its Social Democrat SPD junior partner.

Brexit should be used to spur EU reform, not deter would-be leavers, SPD Economy Minister Sigmar Gabriel said last week.

"We should not purely focus on Brexit as a threat," he said. "Should we reach a good result in negotiations with the UK, it could serve as an example for a Europe of different speeds." ($1 = 0.8011 pounds)

RPT-INSIGHT-How Toyota, Target, Best Buy are fighting back against Republican border tax push - 路透新闻

{{20170131T110002.361+0000}}RPT-INSIGHT-How Toyota, Target, Best Buy are fighting back against Republican border tax push(Repeats to widen distribution)

By Ginger Gibson and David Shepardson

WASHINGTON, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Days before a group of Republican lawmakers were due to discuss their party's controversial proposal to tax all imports, Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T> sent an urgent message to its U.S. dealers - tell the politicians the tax would seriously hurt car buyers.

Some of Toyota's 1,500 dealers heeded the call and contacted members of the House of Representatives' tax-writing Ways and Means Committee, urging them to rethink their proposal, according to people familiar with the effort. Imposing a 20 percent tax on imports would force consumers to pay potentially thousands of dollars more for vehicles, they warned.

The Japanese automaker's mobilization of its army of dealers underscores the growing alarm among some of the world's largest companies that sell imported goods in the United States. They fear a big tax on imports would hurt their sales and profits and put them at a disadvantage to rivals more reliant on U.S.-made products.

"Cost is going to go up, as a result demand is going to go down. As a result, we're not going to able to employ as many as people as we do today. That's my biggest fear," Toyota's North America CEO Jim Lentz said in an interview.

Toyota dealers employ more than 97,000 people in the United States.

While companies and industry groups frequently lobby Congress, the threat of an import tax has mobilized an unusually broad swath of firms at home and abroad. That lobbying effort is taking place largely out of the public eye partly to avoid potential conflict with President Donald Trump, who has attacked companies for manufacturing abroad for U.S. consumers.

Earlier this month Trump targeted Toyota, threatening to impose a hefty fee on the world's largest automaker if it builds its Corolla cars for the U.S. market at a plant in Mexico.

The White House said last week that a border tax is one option under review to pay for a wall with Mexico, although what exactly Trump is planning to do is still not clear. He has pledged to impose a "big border tax" on Mexican imports.

The plan proposed by House Republicans would cut corporate income tax to 20 percent from 35 percent, exclude export revenue from taxable income and impose the 20 percent tax on imports.

Companies that rely heavily on imports say a border tax will outweigh the benefit of a lower headline corporate tax.

As car dealers are reaching out to members of Congress in their districts, Toyota and other automakers are lobbying lawmakers in states where they have large manufacturing plants and employ thousands of workers.

The No. 3 vehicle seller in the United States behind General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co , Toyota imports about 1.2 million vehicles to the U.S. market annually, half of its 2.4 million U.S. sales. It employs 40,000 people directly.

BABY SUPPLIES AND BEER

Toyota and the automakers are not alone in this lobbying effort.

Target Corp's chief executive, Brian Cornell, traveled to Washington to meet members of the House Ways and Means Committee. He told them an import tax could impact consumers' ability to buy essential goods, such as baby supplies that are made overseas and imported to the United States, according to a person familiar with the talks. Target spokeswoman Dustee Jenkins confirmed the visit.

The largest U.S. electronics retailer, Best Buy , headquartered down the road from Minneapolis-based Target, has circulated a flyer to lawmakers. It cites an analyst forecast that a 20 percent tax would wipe out the company's projected annual net income of $1 billion and turn it into a $2 billion loss.

The flyer, a copy of which was seen by Reuters, argues that foreign Internet sellers like China's Alibaba.com would be able to avoid the tax by making sales online and shipping to U.S. consumers directly, "undercutting U.S. businesses."

Company officials have been handing out the flyer to lawmakers and their staff on Capitol Hill, Best Buy spokesman Jeff Shelman confirmed.

Constellation Brands , which brews Corona and Modelo in Mexico, has been pushing lawmakers to exempt products like Mexican beer in any border tax "because it's inherently a Mexican product," CEO Rob Sands said on an earnings call.

But if that effort fails, Constellation is prepared to buy more raw materials from the United States instead of Mexico, Sands said.

Koch Industries [KCHIN.UL], the second-largest private U.S. company according to Forbes, said in a statement a border tax would have a "devastating" impact on consumers. The company, owned by Republican donors Charles and David Koch, includes oil refining and manufacturing interests.

Tim Phillips, the president of Americans for Prosperity, a conservative political group founded by the billionaire brothers, told Reuters the powerful group has started to educate its network of activists about the tax, so they can lobby against it. AFP says it has two million activists.

LOVE AND HATE

Not everyone in corporate America is worried about a new border tax.

Several aerospace companies including Boeing Co , United Technologies Corp and Raytheon Co said in earnings calls last week that a border tax could be positive for net exporters like them.

"We see the aerospace sector as fundamentally having an advantage in that regard," Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg said.

The American International Automobile Dealers Association (AIADA), however, called the proposal "heart stopping," in a letter last week to 9,500 dealers selling vehicles like Toyota, Volkswagen , and BMW .

Opponents of the border tax may have already found some allies.

Republican Representative Trey Gowdy of South Carolina, where BMW has a large plant, said the importance of foreign automakers such as BMW and Toyota to the economy needs to be considered when making laws.

"I cannot overstate how significant that industry is to my state," Gowdy said in an interview, adding that he and his wife both drive Toyotas.

WRAPUP 1-Ford, Goldman CEOs criticize Trump travel curbs - 路透新闻

{{20170130T194337.787+0000}}WRAPUP 1-Ford, Goldman CEOs criticize Trump travel curbsBy Olivia Oran and David Shepardson

Jan 30 (Reuters) - The chief executives of Goldman Sachs Group and Ford Motor Co joined the criticism of President Donald Trump's order to halt arrivals from several Muslim-majority countries, as equity markets fell and the dollar slipped on Monday.

The initial response over the weekend from U.S. corporate leaders to Trump's order curtailing travel from seven Muslim-majority countries had been fragmented and muted outside the technology sector.

However, on Monday, after a weekend of confusion over how the travel restrictions would be enforced, more companies and unions went public with concerns, although most avoided direct attacks on Trump's policy. [nL1N1FK0M0]

United Parcel Service Inc , for example, said it "supports policies that enable the legal movement of people across borders, while also understanding the need to protect national security."

Goldman Sachs Group Inc Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein was the first major Wall Street CEO to weigh in against the administration's travel ban. Other financial industry leaders followed on Monday with expressions of concern about the travel order. [nL4N1FK1W8]

"This is not a policy we support, and I would note that it has already been challenged in federal court, and some of the order has been enjoined at least temporarily," Blankfein said in a voicemail to employees on Sunday. If the temporary freeze became permanent, he said, it could create "disruption" for the bank and its staff, according to a transcript seen by Reuters.

Ford Executive Chairman Bill Ford Jr. and Chief Executive Mark Fields said in a statement to employees that the company does not support what it called a new U.S. travel ban. [nL1N1FK11M]

"We do not support this policy or any other that goes against our values as a company," they said, adding that Ford is not aware of any employees directly affected by the policy.

General Motors Co's head of human resources told employees in a memo that a few GM employees are from countries affected by the travel order, and added, "at General Motors, we value and respect individual differences."

Equity markets sold off amid uncertainty over what broader impact the travel ban and the disruption it created could have. [nL4N1FK26T] The dollar fell more than 1 percent against the Japanese yen. [nL1N1FK184]

FOCUS ON AUTO INDUSTRY

Trump has focused on the auto industry to promote more manufacturing jobs in industrial states that were critical to his electoral college victory. He met with the heads of the Detroit Three automakers, including Fields, last week.

Ford's situation illustrates the balancing act for companies in many sectors. Ford - like Wall Street banks and other big manufacturers - has much to gain from working with Trump to overhaul the federal tax code and revamp regulation. Fields has cited those potential gains in explaining Ford's decisions to cancel investments in Mexico that Trump had attacked.

Fields met twice with Trump last week to talk about economic issues. Trump harshly Ford criticized during the campaign for moving some production to Mexico, but he has praised the automaker in recent weeks for announcing new U.S. investments.

However, Ford has employees who could be affected by immigration curbs, and does business in countries that are majority Muslim, or whose leaders have expressed disapproval of Trump's policy. Ford is based in Dearborn, Michigan, home to one of the largest Arab-American populations in the United States.

Separately, the head of the United Auto Workers union, Dennis Williams, said on Monday the UAW "denounces any policy that judges people based on their religion or nation of origin." Williams, who represents Detroit Three factory workers, has previously supported Trump's moves to renegotiate or scrap open trade deals.

Tesla Motors Inc CEO Elon Musk asked followers to read the immigration order and propose "specific amendments." He said he would seek a consensus among members of a business advisory council that is expected to meet with President Trump this week.

In a response to a comment on his Twitter feed, Musk wrote, "There is no possibility of retraction, but there is possibility of modification ..."

Starbucks Corp Chief Executive Officer Howard Schultz took a different approach to the travel ban, saying on Sunday that the coffee shop chain planned to hire 10,000 refugees over five years in 75 countries. [nL4N1FK0CD]

The hiring efforts would start in the United States by initially focusing on individuals who have served with U.S. troops as interpreters and support personnel in countries where the military has asked for such support, Schultz said.

Some big industrial companies and financial industry players stayed clear of the controversy.

The U.S. hedge fund industry was virtually silent on the immigration restrictions. Representatives for most major firms —including Bridgewater Associates, Renaissance Technologies, Millennium Management and Two Sigma Investments — did not respond to requests for comment over the weekend.

Private equity firms, including Blackstone Group LP , whose CEO, Stephen Schwarzman, chairs Trump's advisory panel of business leaders, also would not comment on the travel ban.

Fiat Chrysler Group NV , Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T> and Honda Motor Co <7267.T> declined to comment on the immigration order.

UPDATE 2-Ford Motor criticizes Trump immigration order - 路透新闻

{{20170130T181014.493+0000}}UPDATE 2-Ford Motor criticizes Trump immigration order(Adds Goldman reaction, UPS and FedEx statements, Musk comments)

By David Shepardson

WASHINGTON, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co on Monday criticized President Donald Trump's controversial immigration order, becoming one of the highest profile U.S. manufacturers to question the decision to temporarily ban travelers coming from seven predominantly Muslim countries.

The leader of Goldman Sachs also criticized the order and FedEx and UPS said they were reviewing its impact. The chief of Tesla has said he would ask members of a business advisory council to come up with potential changes to recommend to the White House.

Ford Executive Chairman Bill Ford Jr. and Chief Executive Officer Mark Fields said in a statement to employees that the company does not support what it called a new U.S. travel ban.

"We do not support this policy or any other that goes against our values as a company," they said, adding that Ford is not aware of any employees directly affected by the policy.

Ford's statement came the same day that Goldman Sachs Group Inc Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein became the first major Wall Street chief to say he did not support the immigration policy. [nL4N1FK1W8]

Fields met twice with Trump last week to talk about economic issues. Ford was harshly criticized by Trump during the campaign for moving some production to Mexico, but he has praised the automaker in recent weeks for announcing new U.S. investments.

Ford is based in Dearborn, Michigan, home to one of the largest Arab-American populations in the United States.

General Motors Co , Fiat Chrysler Group NV , Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T> and Honda Motor Co <7267.T> have declined to comment on the immigration order.

GM Executive Vice President Mark Reuss, asked about the Trump order at an event, said only that "GM is a global company."

Tesla Motors Inc CEO Elon Musk used his Twitter account on Sunday to ask followers to read the immigration order and propose "specific amendments." He said he would seek a consensus among members of a business advisory council that is expected to meet with President Trump this week.

In a response to a comment on his Twitter feed, Musk wrote, "There is no possibility of retraction, but there is possibility of modification ..."

It was not clear on Monday what role Musk would play in organizing a response by the 19 members of the business advisory council. He did not reply to emails seeking comment.

CEOs of several technology companies have criticized the White House order suspending the U.S. refugee program and barring travelers from seven Muslim-majority countries.

Until Monday, executives of many U.S. companies outside Silicon Valley had remained silent or issued cautious statements highlighting their commitments to a diverse workforce. [nL1N1FK0M0]

Logistics companies FedEx Corp and United Parcel Service Inc issued statements Monday saying they were reviewing the policy's impact. FedEx said it is "actively working to seek clarification as quickly as possible."

UPS said it is reviewing the implications of the order for its employees around the world, and said it "supports policies that enable the legal movement of people across borders, while also understanding the need to protect national security."

UPDATE 1-Trump travel ban stirs faint corporate outcry beyond Silicon Valley - 路透新闻

{{20170130T135600.455+0000}}UPDATE 1-Trump travel ban stirs faint corporate outcry beyond Silicon Valley(Adds comments from Goldman Sachs' chief executive)

By Devika  Krishna Kumar and Ross Kerber

NEW YORK/BOSTON, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Most U.S. corporate
bosses have stayed silent on President Donald Trump's
immigration curbs, underscoring the sensitivities around
opposing policies that could provoke a backlash from the White
House.

While the leaders of Apple Inc , Google 
and Facebook Inc  emailed their staff to denounce the
suspension of the U.S. refugee program and the halting of
arrivals from seven Muslim-majority countries, many of their
counterparts in other industries either declined comment or
responded with company statements reiterating their commitment
to diversity.

The difference in response shows the pressure large swathes
of corporate America faces to avoid tussling publicly with the
new administration. [nL1N1EW19P]

Companies such as aircraft maker Boeing Co  and
automakers Ford Motor Co  and General Motors Co  have
already had run-ins with Trump over other issues, and they have
much at stake in policy decisions that the administration will
make on tax, trade and regulatory matters.

Before office, Trump attacked Boeing over the cost of the
future Air Force One program. Boeing Chief Executive Officer
Dennis Muilenburg met with him earlier this month and said he
and Trump had made progress on the Air Force One issue and the
potential sale of fighter aircraft. [nL1N1F710E]

Representatives from Boeing, General Motors and Ford
declined to comment on Trump's immigration curbs.

Wall Street, meanwhile, is hoping the new administration
will ease some of the regulations introduced in the wake of the
2007-08 financial crisis and adopt a lighter touch in their
enforcement.

Industries including banking, healthcare and auto
manufacturing "see themselves on the cusp of a new era of
deregulation, and they do not want to do anything that would
offend the new emperor," said Cornelius Hurley, director of
Boston University's Center for Finance, Law & Policy.

So far, Lloyd Blankfein, the chief executive of Goldman
Sachs , is the only major U.S. bank boss to speak out
directly against the executive order.

"This is not a policy we support," Blankfein said in a
message sent to staff on Sunday evening. "Being diverse is not
optional; it is what we must be."

Representatives of Citigroup Inc , Bank of America Corp
 and Morgan Stanley  declined to comment on Trump's
immigration order.

Wells Fargo & Co  said in a statement that it was
reviewing the executive order and its implications for staff and
its business.

JPMorgan Chase & Co's  Operating Committee, which
includes CEO Jamie Dimon, sent a note to staff saying it was
reaching out to all employees affected and noted that the
country was, "strengthened by the rich diversity of the world
around us."

To be sure, some CEOs were more outspoken.

Nike Inc  CEO Mark Parker said the company did not
support the executive order.

"Nike believes in a world where everyone celebrates the
power of diversity," he said in a statement. "Those values are
being threatened by the recent executive order in the U.S.
banning refugees, as well as visitors, from seven
Muslim-majority countries."

Brent Saunders, CEO of U.S. drugmaker Allergan Plc ,
tweeted: "Oppose any policy that puts limitations on our ability
to attract the best & diverse talent."

But many boardrooms kept quiet. Representatives for some
energy companies, including Exxon Mobil Corp , for
example, declined to comment.

GOOD CORPORATE CITIZENS

As the idea of corporate social responsibility has taken
root, so companies have increasingly championed a range of
causes, including gay rights, diverse workplaces and a global
view.

Many in corporate America are still trying to work out how
to deal with a new government that takes a more conservative
stance on some social issues and has an anti-globalization
platform.

Those non-tech companies that did issue statements over the
weekend tended to emphasize their role as good corporate
citizens rather than openly criticize Trump's policies.

Starbucks Corp  CEO Howard Schultz has put the
coffee chain in the national spotlight before, asking customers
not to bring guns into stores and urging conversations on race
relations.

In a letter to employees, he said Starbucks was developing
plans to hire 10,000 refugees over five years across dozens of
countries, but he did not directly criticize Trump's order.

"I am hearing the alarm you all are sounding that the
civility and human rights we have all taken for granted for so
long are under attack," he wrote.

In his statement, General Electric Co  CEO Jeff Immelt
told staff that the company would engage with the U.S.
government.

"We will continue to make our voice heard with the new
administration and Congress, and reiterate the importance of
this issue to GE and to the business community overall," he
wrote.

One of the most immediate ways for corporate bosses to
communicate with Trump about the immigration order will be the
first meeting of his advisory panel of business leaders next
week.

Of the 19 leaders on that panel, only two, Elon Musk, who
founded Tesla Motors Inc  and SpaceX, and Travis
Kalanick, CEO of Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL], have spoken
out against Trump's immigration curbs.

A spokeswoman for Stephen Schwarzman, the billionaire chief
executive of Blackstone Group LP  whom Trump tasked to set
up and chair the panel, declined to comment.

Trump had targeted both the tech industry and Wall Street
during his presidential campaign, but once elected, he tapped
former investment bankers, hedge fund managers and private
equity investors to join his administration.

With friends in high places, Wall Street may have less
reason to be as outspoken about the new restrictions.

"Bankers have direct access to this White House," said Erik
Gordon, who teaches at the University of Michigan's Ross School
of Business. "They don't have to protest publicly."

RPT-Back to zero: Companies use 1970s budget tool to cut costs as they hunt for growth - 路透新闻

{{20170130T120002.111+0000}}RPT-Back to zero: Companies use 1970s budget tool to cut costs as they hunt for growth(Repeats without changes for wider distribution)

By Tim McLaughlin

BOSTON, Jan 30 (Reuters) - The number of U.S. companies using a budgeting tool made famous in the 1970s by former U.S. President Jimmy Carter is surging as they turn their spending habits upside down to boost profits and to re-invest in their businesses.

The upswing in zero-based budgeting (ZBB) signals that a broader cross-section of U.S. companies anticipate turbulence in their revenue growth. They face more pressure on profits, too, as wages and interest rates increase, and a stronger dollar makes their products more expensive overseas.

In consumer staples, where sales growth is often capped in the low-to-mid single digits, Campbell Soup Co , Kellogg Co , and Oreo cookie maker Mondelez International Ltd have already rolled out ZBB programs that promise billions of dollars in savings.

Other industries, including finance, energy and manufacturing, are now following suit. Use of ZBB in 2017 is expected to increase dramatically in the United States and around the globe, according to consulting experts. Bain & Company reported last year in a survey of 406 North American companies that 38 percent of that group would use ZBB, up from just 10 percent in 2014.

"ZBB has taken on a life of its own," said Greg Portell, a partner at consulting firm A.T. Kearney.

A ZBB approach requires corporate managers to justify each line item of spending in their budgets, or even build their budgets from scratch. That is a departure from the typical process of using the previous year's budget as a starting point and adjusting it based on revenue and inflation projections, for example.

It often cracks down on the size of a company's real estate footprint, corporate travel, terms of international assignments, redundant technology and outside consultants. Employees get cut, too.

But there are risks. One is that companies focus too keenly on restraining spending and not on reinvestment that promotes new products and revenue growth.

"You continuously have to ask what are strategic costs and how can we invest behind the things that drive the highest volume," said Jason Heinrich, a partner in Bain & Company's Chicago office.

FEELING THREATENED

ZBB first gained widespread attention in the late 1970s, when Carter, as president, said he would apply the budgeting principles to federal spending. It never fully got off the ground, however, and Ronald Reagan abandoned it when he became president in 1981.

Its recent resurgence is due in part to Brazilian buyout firm 3G Capital, which used ZBB when it combined H.J. Heinz with Kraft Foods in 2015.

The combined Kraft Heinz now has the best profit margins among its peers with an estimated year-over-year gross margin expansion of 258 basis points, better than twice the average among rivals, according to Morgan Stanley. Kraft Heinz's stock sports a 2.5-point price-to-earnings-multiple premium over its peers.

3G's success is one reason the highest adoption rate of ZBB is in the consumer staples sector, which has banked on cost cutting to offset weak sales growth. In the current fourth quarter reporting season, the consumer staples sector is on track to report profit of 6.3 percent off revenue growth of just 3.2 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data.

Contrast that with the consumer discretionary sector where sales are seen rising 5 percent but profit just 1.1 percent.

Greg Kuczynski, a consumer staples analyst at asset manager Janus Capital, said ZBB is also being used by some to head off agitation from activist shareholders or even takeovers, like the Kraft Heinz deal.

"So many of them feel threatened," he said. "They're desperately implementing ZBB packages."

Now the approach is spreading to energy, finance, health care and manufacturing. Cheniere Energy Inc , Huntington Bancshares Inc , Baxter International Inc and Ford Motor Co are some of the latest devotees.

"If a company uses zero-based budgeting, I have more confidence it can take out cost faster than peers who do not," said Marc Scott, who helps run the $1 billion American Century All-Cap Growth Fund .

TOUGHER THAN IT LOOKS

Not everyone is sold on it. It can be an uncomfortable adjustment for managers and companies have to be careful not to alienate customers and business partners, according to analysts.

The biggest risk is that companies concentrate only on cutting costs, and don't put some of that money back to work behind businesses with the potential for growth. One unintended consequence is cutting a product's marketing budget only to see a rival boost spending for their product and grab market share.

"It's not so simple as some of our other competitors out there make you believe, which has been roughly translated into, 'Let's cut all the costs as long as we can get away with it to show you better margins for a short period of time. But I can't promise you any growth along the way,'" Unilever Chief Executive Paul Polman told investors in November.

Even Kraft Heinz has had trouble generating consistent growth. Its organic net sales, which excludes the impact of currency fluctuations and other items, declined by 1 percent in the three-month period that ended Oct 2.

Still, the cost cutting has caught the attention of investors, particularly when companies scrap product lines that add little value.

American Century's Scott said ZBB was a factor when he evaluated kidney dialysis provider Baxter International, which has used ZBB principles to cancel several programs that added little value.

He began building a position in late 2015 when Baxter traded below $35 a share, according to Thomson Reuters data. The fund now owns about 540,000 shares and the stock trades around $46.

"It was just another feather in their cap," Scott said about Baxter's use of ZBB. "It's not a huge growth play, but we expect their profit margins to nearly double in a couple of years."

REFILE-Ford braced for $600 mln Brexit currency hit in 2017 - Reuters News

{{20170127T183533.098+0000}}REFILE-Ford braced for $600 mln Brexit currency hit in 2017(Removes tag from headline, text unchanged)

By Laurence Frost

PARIS, Jan 27 (Reuters) - Ford's 2017 earnings will be hit by a delayed currency impact of at least $600 million from Britain's referendum vote to leave the EU, the U.S. carmaker told Reuters on Friday, putting last year's record European profit levels beyond reach.

Currency hedges that had shielded Ford from the pound's slump following the June 23 Brexit referendum are expiring in the first three months of 2017, Ford of Europe boss Jim Farley said in an interview.

"When Brexit happened we were fully hedged for the first quarter with the stronger pre-Brexit exchange rate," Farley said. "As we enter the rest of the year, especially the second half, we now face the full effects of the weaker sterling."

UPDATE 1-Ford sees return to Russian market growth in 2017 - Reuters News

{{20170127T171527.429+0000}}UPDATE 1-Ford sees return to Russian market growth in 2017(Adds detail, comment, background)

PARIS, Jan 27 (Reuters) - Ford expects the embattled Russian car market to return to growth this year as improved stability in exchange rates and prices brings customers back into showrooms.

Russian price inflation for new cars has eased in the past six months, Ford of Europe chief Jim Farley said on Friday, spurring demand for cars and especially SUVs.

"We're just starting to see those green shoots and it's really related to the strength of the currency and its knock-on effect on inflation," he told Reuters.

The Russian market has shrunk by more than half from its 2012 peak of 2.9 million vehicles, sapped by the rouble's decline in response to weaker oil prices and international sanctions.

While rival General Motors halted production in 2015, Ford has dug in, launching new models and defying last year's further 11 percent market drop with a 10 percent sales gain.

The Moscow-based AEB industry association now predicts 4 percent growth in car sales this year, ending the four-year slump. [nL5N1F227P]

An upturn in Russia would mark a bright spot for Ford of Europe, which also warned on Friday that the impact of Britain's vote to leave the EU would put a $600 million dent in its 2017 earnings as its sterling currency hedges expire. [nL5N1FH4LE]

Ford expects the Russian market to turn positive "towards the end of the year", Farley said. "Within the next 24 months we see the Russian market recovering."

Its Ford Sollers venture and France's Renault - which recently invested fresh capital in Lada-maker Avtovaz and has gained market share - are poised to benefit.

German luxury carmaker Daimler is also weighing up a Russian plant investment as the market outlook improves.

"We are in dialogue with the Russian government in order to check whether the economic requirements for local passenger car production are fulfilled," spokeswoman Sofia Stauber said.

Ford device to boost connectivity in its models without modems - Reuters News

{{20170127T050100.951+0000}}Ford device to boost connectivity in its models without modemsSAN FRANCISCO, Jan 26 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co said on Friday it would sell a plug-in device to enable features like remote start, security alerts, a Wifi hotspot and vehicle location assistance on 2010-2016 model year Ford and Lincoln cars.

The device would compete with similar products sold by other companies, including devices from AT&T and Verizon that add a Wifi hotspot to older model cars.

The SmartLink technology in the Ford device allows models that do not come pre-equipped with a modem to be more connected, enabling doors to be locked and unlocked remotely and supplying engine management alerts, the company said in a statement.

The after-market device, which plugs into the car's OBD II port below the steering wheel, would be sold at dealerships beginning this summer. Ford did not disclose a price.

All U.S. cars built after 1996 model year are mandated by law to have an OBD II port, which has historically been used for onboard diagnostics. Carmakers worry third-party devices can interfere with their own embedded systems, introduce security bugs, and exploit data they say is their own, such as the car's health or miles driven.

COLUMN-How companies should respond to Trump's attacks – and praises - Reuters News

{{20170126T211942.512+0000}}COLUMN-How companies should respond to Trump's attacks – and praises(Bruce F. Freed is president of the Center for Political Accountability. Charles E.M. Kolb is a member of the CPA board. Kolb was president of the Committee for Economic Development from 1997 to 2012 and served as deputy assistant for domestic policy to President George H.W. Bush from 1990 to 1992.)

By Bruce F. Freed and Charles E.M. Kolb

Jan 26 (Reuters) - In a meeting with automakers on the fourth day of his presidency, Donald Trump appeared eager to cooperate with executives. But that tone was in stark contrast to his messaging on Twitter and at a pre-presidential news conference, where he targeted some businesses for attack and embraced others.

Trump assailed the pharmaceutical industry at his Jan. 11 news conference, saying drug companies "are getting away with murder." Key drug stocks immediately plummeted.

The following day, Trump tweeted that Americans should "Buy L.L. Bean," after thanking an L.L. Bean board and family member for her political support. With his tweet, he put an iconic Yankee company in the crosshairs of a polarized national discourse.

Whether Trump has been testing messages to use as president or launching a regular practice, he has used his own "bully pulpit" to put some businesses on notice and to commend others. This approach is raising questions about what some economists call "crony capitalism" and also about quid-pro-quo politics, and it's shaking up company executives who might otherwise be optimistic about pledges of economic growth.

Seven years ago, the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision freed companies to engage in political spending. The cost of elections keeps surging with the 2016 presidential cycle nearing $7 billion, up from $6.3 billion in 2012. Today, how will U.S. companies respond to rising concerns about bullying or favoritism in federal government intervention, and will Trump's L.L. Bean endorsement provide a greater incentive to engage politically?

U.S. corporate leaders from Carrier (HVAC manufacturing) to Boeing (aircraft manufacturing) and Ford (auto manufacturing) have been among those targeted by Trump as he presses his job-growth agenda. On Jan. 11, the nine top pharmaceutical companies in the S&P 500 by market cap lost a staggering $24.6 billion in 20 minutes during Trump's press conference, according to one analysis. Trump said the drug companies charge the government too much for medicines.

On Jan. 12, Trump tweeted about L.L. Bean, which an anti-Trump group called Grab Your Wallet had added to its list of companies targeted for boycotting. An L.L. Bean official quickly reminded inquiring news media that the company makes "no political endorsements or contributions," despite the fact that board member Linda Bean donated thousands of dollars to a political action committee that supported Trump.

A dynamic, growth-oriented capitalist system requires a level playing field in which companies focus on how best to compete in the marketplace, not in the political arena or with political money. A number of economists believe crony capitalism brings harmful uncertainty to U.S. companies. And there is academic research suggesting an association between government-induced risk and companies' increased political donations.

How, then, would U.S. companies respond to a new president's bully pulpit? When he urges millions of Twitter followers to buy a company's products in the wake of its board member's political contributions, will business leaders see it as a quid-pro-quo endorsement?

Or will they listen instead to the skeptical Trump who boasted on the campaign trail of giving money to politicians to get them to "do whatever the hell you want them to do," while calling the existing campaign finance system "broken"?

These aren't idle questions, given what we're seeing in company contributions to the Trump inauguration. According to news reports, Trump-target Boeing pledged $1 million. Chevron, which has a deep stake in the incoming administration's energy and regulatory policies, gave $500,000. And AT&T, which is seeking to merge with Time Warner, has acknowledged that it contributed.

It's too early to tell what factors the new president and new Congress will take into account in making decisions about businesses. In the meantime, in the interest of promoting economic growth along with their own protection, businesses can take concrete steps to protect themselves, shareholders and our democracy.

Being transparent about when they give political money and adopting clear policies for this spending are two of the most significant safeguards companies can adopt at a time when one of Citizens United's central promises has not been fulfilled.

In his Citizens United opinion for the court's majority, Justice Anthony Kennedy unshackled companies to engage in almost unfettered political spending while asserting that modern technology has the potential to make "disclosures rapid and informative." The latter promise has not been met.

In large part due to Citizens United and other court rulings, the U.S. election cycle in 2016 broke spending records. Driving much of the record costs were outside groups not formally connected to either political party, including organizations not required under U.S. law to disclose their donors. These latter groups' secretive political funds often are called "dark money." Because these organizations may keep their donors anonymous, they are particularly attractive to like-thinking corporations and others who want to keep their donations under the radar.

The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, for example, a powerful business trade association, is allowed under U.S. law to keep the sources of its political spending hidden. It spent almost $30 million on influencing 2016 House and Senate races. So-called "social welfare" groups run ads about hot issues, sometimes attacking candidates, and they are also permitted to hide donor identities. All told, political dark money was projected to add up to at least $132 million in 2016.

Unfortunately, the promise of broad, effective disclosure that the Supreme Court embraced in Citizens United still seems remote. It is impossible to measure the total largesse of rivers of corporate political giving intended to influence elections.

It is possible, however, by looking at disclosed spending, to get a sense of scale of corporate political engagement at another level: in the states, where more and more companies are turning for action. In the 2014 election cycle, business interests spent $1.1 billion on state candidates and committees. By comparison, in the same period labor groups spent $215 million and ideological or single-issue groups spent $137 million.

When companies are transparent about their political contributions, they can protect against payments that might cause a backlash in our fiercely divided political climate, or an ill-considered payment that can damage their reputation. A clear policy on political spending can protect them against public or private pressure from a political candidate, allowing them to cite company policy in order to say "no."

These steps are getting mainstream traction from companies acting on their own. According to a recent nonpartisan report examining the S&P 500, 305 of these companies were disclosing some or all of their political payments. One hundred and eleven had policies requiring board oversight of political spending. And 143 had placed some level of restriction on their political spending.

It looks like Trump will continue to use his bully pulpit to shame and blame companies, and concerns about crony capitalism will keep growing. If this happens, companies can protect themselves and their integrity by following guidance from Business Roundtable, which encourages company boards to oversee political spending and consider adopting a policy on disclosure. It's modest advice, but it may help companies in the eye of Trump's next storm.

UPDATE 4-Ford sees lower 2017 profits, takes hit from pensions, Mexico - Reuters News

{{20170126T194001.011+0000}}UPDATE 4-Ford sees lower 2017 profits, takes hit from pensions, Mexico(Adds comments from CFO interview in paragraphs 7-9)

By Bernie Woodall

DETROIT, Jan 26 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co on Thursday reported a fourth-quarter loss, citing an accounting change to pensions and costs for abandoning a factory in Mexico, which President Donald Trump had attacked on the road the White House.

Ford also reaffirmed its forecast that 2017 profits would be lower, which contrasted with more upbeat forecasts from Detroit rivals General Motors Co [nL1N1F018Q] and the U.S. operations of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV . [nL5N1FG3EG]

Ford shares were down 3 percent at $12.41.

Ford's fourth-quarter results took a $200-million hit from costs related to canceling a $1.6-billion small car plant in Mexico that had become a target for Trump during his campaign last year. [nL1N1ET0V9]

Ford said overall it will save $500 million by consolidating small car production planned for the new assembly factory at an existing plant in Mexico. [nL1N1EW1XY]

The company said the decision was driven by slack demand and weak pricing for small cars, but Ford executives said they were encouraged by Trump's promises of corporate tax cuts and regulatory relief. [nL1N1ET0V9]

Since last fall, Ford has cautioned that its 2017 profit will be pressured by investments in electrified vehicles, autonomous vehicles and big data systems that would power ride hailing and other services. This year will be the most expensive year in developing those emerging areas, Shanks said in an interview with Reuters.

"We see this as being a one-year phenomenon in terms of the impact because of the timing of the investment, the degree of the investments that we're making in the new part of our business," he said.

Shanks said Ford will not turn a profit on these businesses in aggregate until next decade, but they ultimately could yield profit margins higher than 20 percent.

Ford's results and its downbeat outlook point to other challenges for the Dearborn, Michigan automaker beyond plant investments.

Ford's North American auto operations, which account for about 90 percent of pre-tax profit, had adjusted profit margins for the quarter of 8.5 percent, up from 8.2 percent a year earlier.

GM, however, reported 11.2 percent adjusted profit margin in North America in the third quarter, and has said it will easily eclipse its more than 10-percent margin target for the region for 2016. GM reports earnings on Feb. 7.

Ford's 2016 North American pretax profit margin was 9.7 percent, from 10.2 percent in 2015. Ford CFO Shanks said the North American margin would have been 10.3 percent last year if not for a $570 million recall expense.

In Europe, Ford reported a record pretax profit of $1.2 billion for the year, while GM is in the red in Europe.

For the fourth quarter, Ford reported a loss of $783 million, or 20 cents a share, for the fourth quarter of 2016 because of a $3 billion non-cash accounting remeasurement announced last week, which is related to low interest rates. [nFWN1FA0HV]

Ford's revenue fell 4 percent to $38.7 billion in the quarter. The company said its pretax profit for 2016 was $10.4 billion, second to a record $10.8 billion reached in 2015.

After taxes, the pension remeasurement took a $2 billion bite out of Ford's net income. Excluding one-time items, Ford's profit was 30 cents a share, matching the estimates of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

BREAKINGVIEWS-Detroit can power-steer around political obstacles - Reuters Breakingviews

{{20170126T180311.244+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-Detroit can power-steer around political obstacles(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.)

By Antony Currie

NEW YORK, Jan 26 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Detroit is under scrutiny from Washington. New President Donald Trump told the bosses of Fiat Chrysler , Ford and General Motors on Tuesday that he wants more U.S. factories and jobs. In theory that could hobble the industry. But the Big Three have a few tricks up their sleeves.

Trump's threat of a potential 35 percent tariff on vehicles made overseas and sold in America would affect 7.5 million units a year if taken to its extreme. That would require 38 new factories, assuming each could handle 200,000 units a year, at a cost of $1.6 billion each, based on what Ford was planning to spend on the plant in Mexico it canceled earlier this month. That's $60 billion in total.

However, the chances are that Mexico will remain Trump's primary target. Car production there accounts for around a fifth of NAFTA output, according to research firm LMC Automotive. It's the only place manufacturers can profitably build a lot of the smaller cars they sell in the United States and Canada. Shifting the U.S. Big Three's Mexican output of 1.5 million cars a year back home could require eight new factories costing $13 billion – more than half their combined annual pre-tax income, but a lot less than the worst case.

Yet even that probably overstates the concern. Demand for smaller vehicles has been waning in favor of bigger cars, SUVs and trucks mostly produced in the United States – already helping the automakers add U.S. jobs. The industry's existing factories stateside also have spare capacity to build some 500,000 more vehicles a year, LMC reckons.

All three big Motown manufacturers have already painted these developments in ways that curry favor with Trump. They should also gain from his plans to slash the corporate tax rate to as little as 15 percent from the current headline 35 percent. Major exporters like Ford would get extra benefit if congressional Republicans' proposed border adjustments are adopted. Any loosening of the previous administration's fuel-economy standards should help, too.

The carmakers can also turn autonomous-driving technology to their advantage. They're still playing catch-up with rivals and Silicon Valley in a capital-intensive business. Highlighting and even increasing their investments and hiring in this area, while pointing out the declining sales of Mexican-made cars, could play well in their boardrooms and the Oval Office alike. It's one way they can power-steer around political obstacles.

CONTEXT NEWS

- Ford Motor on Jan. 26 reported a fourth-quarter loss of $783 million after taking a $2 billion after-tax charge driven by lower discount rates for the company's pension liabilities and other post-retirement benefit obligations. Ford had already announced the charge on Jan. 20.

- Excluding the charge, earnings of 30 cents a share matched the consensus estimate of sell-side analysts. Revenue of $38.7 billion was $1.6 billion lower than in the final three months of 2015.

- For the full 2016 year, Ford's revenue was up slightly on 2015 at $152 billion, while adjusted pre-tax income was $10.4 billion, 3.7 percent lower than in 2015. Ford reiterated that it expects to earn less in 2017.

- President Donald Trump on Jan. 24 said he wants carmakers to open more factories in the United States. He made the comment in a meeting with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne, Ford boss Mark Fields and General Motors CEO Mary Barra.

UPDATE 1-Pressured by Trump, Mexico ready to discuss NAFTA rules in U.S. talks - Reuters News

{{20170125T000716.477+0000}}UPDATE 1-Pressured by Trump, Mexico ready to discuss NAFTA rules in U.S. talks(Adds White House comment)

By Dave Graham

MEXICO CITY, Jan 24 (Reuters) - Under pressure from President Donald Trump, Mexico is preparing to discuss changes to trade rules about a product's country of origin to try to avoid a disruptive fight with the United States over commerce.

As the two countries begin a difficult new relationship, Mexico sees possible common ground with Trump on the "rules of origin" of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) that binds the two countries and Canada, several sources said.

Rules of origin are regulations setting out where trade products are sourced from. Although formal negotiations about NAFTA have not begun, the rules could eventually be altered to favor U.S. industry over competitors from outside North America, particularly in Asia.

Changes to those rules could help align Mexico with Trump's industrial strategy of boosting U.S. manufacturing jobs and dovetail with the Mexican government's calls to strengthen North American competitiveness.

It could also help pave the way for a broader deal with Trump over border security and immigration, Mexican officials believe.

Talks about NAFTA rules of origin will be a "very important" point of discussion between the two countries now that Trump is in office, a Mexican official said.

A White House official said: "As a general rule, it is in the best interests of the U.S. to insist on strong rules of origin provisions in pursuing bilateral negotiations. Lax rules of origin in proposed treaties like the now defunct Trans-Pacific Partnership shrink and weaken our supply chain and contribute to the offshoring of American jobs."

Mexican Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray and Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo will hold talks with top Trump officials in Washington on Wednesday and Thursday, where security, migration and trade will be discussed. [nL1N1EC0OK] [nL1N1F12EU]

Fears of economic disaster have haunted Mexico since Trump won the presidency in November threatening to tear up NAFTA, impose protectionist tariffs and build a wall on the United States' southern border to halt illegal immigration.

While Mexico is reluctant to alter the 1994 trade accord, officials concede that some changes may be necessary to help keep trade open with the United States, which absorbs 80 percent of its exports.

"What we want is to maintain free access for Mexican products, without restrictions, without tariffs and quotas," Videgaray, the spearhead of the government's outreach to Trump, said on Monday.

LESSER EVIL

Speaking on condition of anonymity, two Mexican government officials and four other people familiar with ongoing discussions said Mexico saw rules of origin as an important avenue to brokering a deal with Trump, provided a fair compromise can be reached.

In trade agreements, content rules or rules of origin are often used to determine import duties.

Under NAFTA, 62.5 percent of the material in a car or light truck made in Mexico must be from North America to be able to enter the United States tariff free.

If the countries agree in negotiations, that percentage could be increased, potentially giving an advantage to U.S. industry at the expense of Asian competitors.

For Mexico, changing the rules of origin could be a lesser evil than Trump's threat to impose a 35 percent tax on certain goods made by foreign companies in Mexico for sale in the United States.

Trump's pressure on U.S. automakers such as Ford to build more cars at home worries Mexico, where the industry has been one of the main drivers of growth and accounted for 18.5 percent of manufacturing GDP in 2015.

Trump on Tuesday told the chief executives of the Big Three U.S. automakers - General Motors , Ford and Fiat Chrysler - that he wants to see more auto plants in the United States.

Mexico warned it could pull out of NAFTA if a renegotiation of the pact does not benefit it. [nL1N1FE4AM]

Trump's team is behind the push for changes in the origin rules, seeing it as a means of reducing imports from China, two of the Mexican sources familiar with the matter said.

Trump's nominee for Commerce Secretary, Wilbur Ross, spoke of the importance of content rules in protecting the automotive industry during Senate hearings last week, and Canadian media reported that Ross had told Canada rules of origin would be central to NAFTA talks. [nL4N1F844A]

U.S. HARD LINE

NAFTA rules of origin apply to goods made in any of the three countries. Two Mexican sources said the Trump administration could push for national content requirements that would ensure that the United States benefits from changes in rules of origin, and not just the NAFTA region as a whole.

However, that would be more complex to manage, they added.

So as not to hurt companies, any changes would need to be phased in gradually, and the more items that were targeted, the trickier negotiations would be, one of the sources said.

Any deal would need to ensure rules changes applied to all countries, not just to Mexico, one Mexican official said.

Of the foreign carmakers in Mexico, Toyota <7203.T> might be able to handle a higher NAFTA content ratio better than others. Its Camry car, for example, has very high North American and U.S. content.

Other Japanese automakers such as Mazda <7261.T> have a larger proportional reliance on Asia-based suppliers.

Kristin Dziczek, a labor analyst at the Center of Automotive Research, said deepening rules of origin could have some impact on U.S. jobs and would hit some foreign automakers harder - especially those that produce more parts and vehicles outside North America.

The NAFTA rules are in place to prevent China or other lower wage countries from being able to produce the majority of content in a vehicle and export it to another country to assemble it without paying tariffs.

U.S. automakers have not backed tougher rules of origin previously because they wanted flexibility on sourcing parts.

UPDATE 5-Trump talks to U.S. automakers, pushes for new American plants - Reuters News

{{20170124T224858.308+0000}}UPDATE 5-Trump talks to U.S. automakers, pushes for new American plants(Adds details of talks, comments from participant, expert, updates stock prices)

By David Shepardson and Roberta Rampton

WASHINGTON, Jan 24 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump urged the chief executives of the Big Three U.S. automakers on Tuesday to build more cars in the country, pressing his pledge to bring jobs to America and discourage the car industry from investing in Mexico.

Trump, who has threatened to impose 35 percent tariffs on imported vehicles, opened a White House meeting with General Motors Co CEO Mary Barra, Ford Motor Co's Mark Fields and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV's Sergio Marchionne by saying he wanted to see more auto plants in the United States.

In return, the new Republican president has vowed to cut regulations and taxes to make it more attractive for businesses to operate in the United States. He promised during his campaign to be a job-creating president and stressed that message in his inaugural address last Friday.

"We have a very big push on to have auto plants and other plants - many other plants," he told reporters at the start of the meeting. "It's happening. It's happening big league."

Matt Blunt, who heads a U.S. automaker trade association and attended the meeting, told Reuters that Trump asked what his administration could do "on domestic and trade policy that would help make the United States more competitive and strengthen the ability of automakers to add production here."

The hour-long meeting was the latest sign of Trump's uncommon degree of intervention for a U.S. president into corporate affairs as he has repeatedly pressured automakers and other manufacturers to "buy American and hire American."

It was the first time the heads of the big three automakers met jointly with a U.S. president since a 2011 session with Barack Obama to tout a deal to nearly double fuel efficiency standards by 2025. Automakers have urged the Trump administration to rethink those aggressive mandates.

The auto executives on Tuesday raised the issue of the fuel efficiency rules, trade policy and other regulatory matters, another person briefed on the meeting said. Marchionne told reporters afterward that Trump did not give them specifics on what regulations he would cut.

The companies also discussed autonomous and electric vehicles and Trump asked about advanced vehicles, the person said.

EXCESS CAPACITY

With flattening U.S. auto sales and excess capacity in the United States, U.S. automakers have been reluctant to open new U.S. auto plants in recent years. GM and Ford last built new U.S. assembly plants in 2004, while Fiat Chrysler opened a new transmission plant in Indiana in 2014.

Kristin Dziczek, an analyst at the Michigan-based Center for Automotive Research, said automakers still had excess capacity in North America after suffering in the 1990s and 2000s from overcapacity and shifts in market share.

Building a new plant would take three or more years and cost at least $1 billion, industry experts said.

Automakers have expanded operations at existing U.S. plants to meet rising demand for trucks and SUVs. GM, Ford, Fiat Chrysler and foreign automakers have announced new U.S. jobs and investments in recent weeks.

Coinciding with Tuesday's meeting, Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T> said it would add 400 jobs and invest $600 million in an Indiana plant, aiming to boost production of a popular SUV by 10 percent. [nL4N1FE2UN]

Ford's Fields said automakers wanted to work with Trump to create a "renaissance in American manufacturing" and that Trump's economic priorities were encouraging, including his move on Monday to formally bow out of the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership trade pact championed by Obama.

"The mother of all trade barriers is currency manipulation. And TPP failed in meaningfully dealing with that, and we appreciate the president's courage to walk away from a bad trade deal," Fields told reporters after the meeting.

Barra said there was a "huge opportunity" to work together with the government to "improve the environment, improve safety and improve the jobs creation."

U.S. automakers have collectively added more than 78,000 jobs since 2009, the year when GM and Chrysler, now a unit of Italian-American Fiat Chrysler, filed for bankruptcy as part of government bailouts during the U.S. recession. They have invested more than $40 billion in U.S. facilities during that period.

BUSINESS CASE

Despite the vocal pressure from Trump, the companies are unlikely to truly change their existing business plans for now, said Sam Fiorani, vice president of global vehicle forecasting with AutoForecast Solutions.

"We need to have more concrete policies from the president," he said. "Automakers will make decisions on whether there is a solid business case. Does it make more sense to build outside the U.S. or to build in the U.S.?"

GM said in 2014 it would invest $5 billion in Mexico through 2018, a move that would allow it to double its production capacity, and Barra has said the automaker is not reconsidering the plan.

While automakers are adding U.S. jobs, they are also cutting U.S. production of small cars. On Monday, GM ended two shifts of production of small cars in Ohio and Michigan, cutting about 2,000 jobs.

Barclays auto analyst Brian Johnson said in a note on Tuesday that "automakers will be willing to make a deal that would bring back jobs to the U.S. in return for a slower ramp of (fuel efficiency) targets and related state-level mandates."

Auto stocks rose on Tuesday. U.S.-listed shares of Fiat Chrysler gained 5.84 percent to $10.88, while Ford was up 2.44 percent to $12.61 and GM rose 0.96 percent to $37.

While Mexico is reluctant to alter the 1994 trade accord, officials concede that some changes may be necessary to help keep trade open with the United States, which absorbs 80 percent of its exports.

"What we want is to maintain free access for Mexican products, without restrictions, without tariffs and quotas," Videgaray, the spearhead of the government's outreach to Trump, said on Monday.

LESSER EVIL

Speaking on condition of anonymity, two Mexican government officials and four other people familiar with ongoing discussions said Mexico saw rules of origin as an important avenue to brokering a deal with Trump, provided a fair compromise can be reached.

In trade agreements, content rules or rules of origin are often used to determine import duties.

Under NAFTA, 62.5 percent of the material in a car or light truck made in Mexico must be from North America to be able to enter the United States tariff free.

If the countries agree in negotiations, that percentage could be increased, potentially giving an advantage to U.S. industry at the expense of Asian competitors.

For Mexico, changing the rules of origin could be a lesser evil than Trump's threat to impose a 35 percent tax on certain goods made by foreign companies in Mexico for sale in the United States.

Trump's pressure on U.S. automakers such as Ford to build more cars at home worries Mexico, where the industry has been one of the main drivers of growth and accounted for 18.5 percent of manufacturing GDP in 2015.

Trump on Tuesday told the chief executives of the Big Three U.S. automakers - General Motors , Ford and Fiat Chrysler - that he wants to see more auto plants in the United States.

Mexico warned it could pull out of NAFTA if a renegotiation of the pact does not benefit it. [nL1N1FE4AM]

Trump's team is behind the push for changes in the origin rules, seeing it as a means of reducing imports from China, two of the Mexicans familiar with the matter said.

Trump's nominee for Commerce Secretary, Wilbur Ross, spoke of the importance of content rules in protecting the automotive industry during Senate hearings last week, and Canadian media reported that Ross had told Canada rules of origin would be central to NAFTA talks. [nL4N1F844A]

U.S. HARD LINE

NAFTA rules of origin apply to goods made in any of the three countries. Two Mexican sources said the Trump administration could push for national content requirements that would ensure that the United States benefits from changes in rules of origin, and not just the NAFTA region as a whole.

However, that would be more complex to manage, they added.

So as not to hurt companies, any changes would need to be phased in gradually, and the more items that were targeted, the trickier negotiations would be, one of the sources said.

Any deal would need to ensure rules changes applied to all countries, not just to Mexico, one Mexican official said.

Of the foreign carmakers in Mexico, Toyota might be able to handle a higher NAFTA content ratio better than others. It Camry car, for example, has very high North American and U.S. content.

Other Japanese automakers such as Mazda have a larger proportional reliance on Asia-based suppliers.

Kristin Dziczek, a labor analyst at the Center of Automotive Research, said deepening rules of origin could have some impact on U.S. jobs and would hit some foreign automakers harder - especially those that produce more parts and vehicles outside North America.

The NAFTA rules are in place to prevent China or other lower wage countries from being able to produce the majority of content in a vehicle and export it to another country to assemble it without paying tariffs.

U.S. automakers have not backed tougher rules of origin previously because they wanted flexibility on sourcing parts.

RPT-UPDATE 1-Reopening NAFTA could revive debate over what makes a car 'American' - Reuters News

{{20170124T120001.379+0000}}RPT-UPDATE 1-Reopening NAFTA could revive debate over what makes a car 'American'(Repeats story with no changes to headline or text)

By Bernie Woodall

DETROIT, Jan 23 (Reuters) - Some of the most popular and profitable vehicles sold in the United States by Detroit's automakers are imported from Mexico, a reality that highlights the risks for the auto industry as the Trump administration pushes to overhaul trade policy.[nL1N1FD126]

President Donald Trump has scheduled a breakfast on Tuesday with the chief executives of Detroit automakers General Motors Co , Ford Motor Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV to talk about bringing more manufacturing jobs to the United States, the White House said on Monday. [nL1N1FD1OX]

Trump campaigned on a pledge to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and said on Monday he would meet leaders of NAFTA partners Mexico and Canada at an "appropriate time" to get the process started. [nL1N1FD1W8]

Auto industry officials expect Trump to urge Canada and Mexico to agree to new tougher "rules of origin" that would require a higher percentage of North American content to be considered tariff free. Under NAFTA, at least 62.5 percent of a passenger car or light truck's net cost must originate in North America - defined as the United States, Canada or Mexico - to avoid tariffs.

Separately, the U.S. government since 1994 tracked the percentage of a vehicle's content that is made in the United States and Canada, and required automakers to disclose those percentages on labels put on vehicles sold in the United States. The Chevrolet Traverse and the Honda Accord made in Ohio had 80 percent U.S. and Canadian content in 2016, for example. The Ram pickup had 59 percent U.S. and Canadian content, according to government data compiled in the 2016 American Automobile Labeling Act report.

Trump has not made specific proposals for reworking NAFTA, but he has called for manufacturers to buy and build more products in the United States.

Automakers have a lot at stake in preserving the status quo.

GM, the biggest U.S. automaker, imported about 315,000 of its full-size Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickup trucks from Mexico last year. That represents about 40 percent of the 2016 U.S. sales of the highly profitable models. Overall, GM builds 14 percent of the vehicles it sells in the United States in Mexico, according to data from LMC Automotive, a consulting firm.

Fiat Chrysler makes nearly half of its Ram full-size pickups, its most popular model, in Mexico, according to data from IHS Markit obtained by Reuters.

Ford earlier this month won praise from Trump for cancelling plans to build a $1.6 billion factory in Mexico. But Ford still plans to build one of its top-selling cars, the Fusion sedan, in Mexico, as well as the future generation of its Focus small car.

Overall, nearly 2 million vehicles were shipped to the United States from Mexico in 2016 by all automakers, and that volume is expected to rise by 14.5 percent this year, according to an IHS Markit forecast.

IHS Markit would not comment on the data Reuters obtained from a third party.

Trump has threatened to slap a 35 percent tariff on vehicles imported from Mexico. But the Center for Automotive Research, an auto industry think tank in Ann Arbor, Michigan, said in a study released this month the tariff could cut U.S. auto sales by 450,000 vehicles per year and cost 6,700 vehicle assembly jobs across North America.

A separate study by LMC Automotive also concluded that U.S. car and light truck sales could suffer if the administration takes a "highly protectionist and isolationist stance." However, if the administration cuts taxes and enacts an infrastructure spending plan, auto sales could rise by 300,000 to 500,000 vehicles a year, LMC forecast.

Trump calls for more U.S. auto jobs, factories ahead of CEO meeting - Reuters News

{{20170124T112918.316+0000}}Trump calls for more U.S. auto jobs, factories ahead of CEO meetingBy David Shepardson

WASHINGTON, Jan 24 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday will push the chief executives of General Motors Co , Ford Motor Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV to increase production in the United States and boost American employment.

"I want new plants to be built here for cars sold here!" Trump said in a tweet ahead of the breakfast meeting with automakers, saying he would discuss U.S. jobs with the chief executives.

Trump has criticized automakers for building cars in Mexico and elsewhere and has threatened to impose 35 percent tariffs on imported vehicles.

The meeting is the latest sign of Trump's uncommon degree of intervention for a U.S. president into corporate affairs as he has repeatedly jawboned automakers and other manufacturers to "buy American and hire American."

It will be the first time the CEOs of the big three automakers meet jointly with a U.S. president since a July 2011 session with then-president Barack Obama to tout a deal to nearly double fuel efficiency standards to 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025. Fiat Chrysler is the Italian-American parent of the former Michigan-based Chrysler.

White House spokesman Sean Spicer on Monday said Trump "looks forward to hearing their ideas about how we can work together to bring more jobs back to this industry."

U.S. and foreign automakers have been touting plans to boost American jobs and investments in the face of Trump's comments. The Republican president made attacks on Ford's Mexico investments a cornerstone of his campaign.

Automakers have praised Trump's policies, but emphasized that the recent employment moves were the result of business, not political decisions, that had mostly been in the works for a long period.

Ford launches brand to sell auto parts to fix competitors' vehicles - Reuters News

{{20170124T050100.870+0000}}Ford launches brand to sell auto parts to fix competitors' vehiclesBy Bernie Woodall

DETROIT, Jan 24 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co , in a bid for a piece of the rapidly growing global auto parts market, is launching a new brand called Omnicraft to sell parts to Ford dealers and independent repair shops to fix competitors' vehicles.

Omnicraft joins Ford's established Motorcraft which makes parts for Ford vehicles.

Frederiek Toney, president of Ford's customer service division, said the global business for automotive parts, which is now estimated at more than $500 billion, and service will expand by 70 percent in the next six years or so.

Toney would not say how much of the global market Ford wants to capture, but said that in 10 years the company would be pleased if 10 percent to 15 percent of its parts sales were from Omnicraft.

Suppliers will make the parts, and Ford will sell them at a profit, but says they will be competitively priced, in part to attract independent repair shops as well as its own dealers.

Having the parts for non-Ford vehicles will allow dealers to increase repair and service business, as well as offer an opportunity to convince owners to look over new Ford cars and trucks while they are at the dealership.

At first, Omnicraft parts will be sold at Ford and Lincoln dealerships, of which there are 3,200 in the United States and 10,500 globally. Omnicraft will be active in Ford's major markets around the world, Toney said.

As the average age of vehicles increases, especially in mature markets like the United States and Europe, there is more of a need for auto parts, said Toney, "which is no secret. It behooves us to try to compete for the life cycle of ownership" and not to focus as Ford has on the early years of that cycle.

In the U.S. market, the average age of a vehicle on the road is more than 11 years.

UPDATE 4-Trump pulls U.S. out of Pacific trade deal, loosening Asia ties - Reuters News

{{20170124T005749.684+0000}}UPDATE 4-Trump pulls U.S. out of Pacific trade deal, loosening Asia ties(Adds background, paragraphs 6-7)

By Steve Holland and Ayesha Rascoe

WASHINGTON, Jan 23 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump formally withdrew the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal on Monday, distancing America from its Asian allies, as China's influence in the region rises.

Fulfilling a campaign pledge to end American involvement in the 2015 pact, Trump signed an executive order in the Oval Office pulling the United States out of the 12-nation TPP.

Trump, who wants to boost U.S. manufacturing, said he would seek one-on-one trade deals with countries that would allow the United States to quickly terminate them in 30 days "if somebody misbehaves."

"We're going to stop the ridiculous trade deals that have taken everybody out of our country and taken companies out of our country," the Republican president said as he met with union leaders in the White House's Roosevelt Room.

The TPP accord, backed heavily by U.S. business, was negotiated by former Democratic President Barack Obama's administration but never approved by Congress.

Obama had framed TPP, which excluded China, as an effort to write Asia's trade rules before Beijing could, establishing U.S. economic leadership in the region as part of his "pivot to Asia."

China has proposed a Free Trade Area of the Asia Pacific and has also championed the Southeast Asian-backed Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership.

Trump has sparked worries in Japan and elsewhere in the Asia-Pacific with his opposition to the TPP and his campaign demands for U.S. allies to pay more for their security.

His trade stance mirrors a growing feeling among Americans that international trade deals have hurt the U.S. job market. Republicans have long held the view that free trade is a must, but that mood has been changing.

"It's going to be very difficult to fight that fight," said Lanhee Chen, a Hoover Institution fellow who was domestic policy adviser to 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney. "Trump is reflecting a trend that has been apparent for many years."

Harry Kazianis, director of defense studies at the Center for the National Interest think tank in Washington, said Trump must now find an alternative way to reassure allies in Asia.

"This could include multiple bilateral trade agreements. Japan, Taiwan and Vietnam should be approached first as they are key to any new Asia strategy that President Trump will enact," he said.

Trump is also working to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement to provide more favorable terms to the United States, telling reporters he would meet leaders of NAFTA partners Mexico and Canada to get the process started. [nL1N1FC1I2]

BUSINESS LEADERS

The new president met with a dozen American manufacturers at the White House on Monday, pledging to slash regulations and cut corporate taxes - but warning them he would take action on trade deals he felt were unfair. [nL1N1FD126]

Trump, who took office on Friday, has promised to bring factories back to the United States - an issue he said helped him win the Nov. 8 election. He has not hesitated to call out by name companies he thinks should bring outsourced production back home.

He said those businesses that choose to move plants outside the country would pay a price. "We are going to be imposing a very major border tax on the product when it comes in," Trump said.

He asked the group of chief executives from companies including Ford Motor Co , Dell Technologies Inc , Tesla Motors Inc and others to make recommendations in 30 days to stimulate manufacturing, Dow Chemical Co Chief Executive Officer Andrew Liveris told reporters.

Liveris said the CEOs discussed the border tax "quite a bit" with Trump, explaining "the sorts of industry that might be helped or hurt by that."

"Look: I would take the president at his word here. He's not going to do anything to harm competitiveness," Liveris said. "He's going to actually make us all more competitive."

At part of the meeting observed by reporters, Trump provided no details on how the border tax would work.

The U.S. dollar fell to a seven-week low against a basket of other major world currencies on Monday, and global stock markets were shaky amid investor concerns about Trump's protectionist rhetoric. [nL1N1FD1YV]

"A company that wants to fire all of its people in the United States, and build some factory someplace else, and then thinks that that product is going to just flow across the border into the United States - that's not going to happen," he said.

CUT TAXES AND REGULATIONS

The president told the CEOs he would like to cut corporate taxes to the 15 percent to 20 percent range, down from current statutory levels of 35 percent - a pledge that will require cooperation from the Republican-led U.S. Congress.

But he said business leaders have told him that reducing regulations is even more important.

"We think we can cut regulations by 75 percent. Maybe more," Trump told business leaders.

"When you want to expand your plant, or when Mark wants to come in and build a big massive plant, or when Dell wants to come in and do something monstrous and special – you're going to have your approvals really fast," Trump said, referring to Mark Fields, CEO of Ford.

Fields said he was encouraged by the tone of the meeting.

"I know I come out with a lot of confidence that the president is very, very serious on making sure that the United States economy is going to be strong and have policies - tax, regulatory or trade - to drive that," he said.

Trump told the executives that companies were welcome to negotiate with governors to move production between states.

UPDATE 1-Reopening NAFTA could revive debate over what makes a car 'American' - Reuters News

{{20170123T232938.715+0000}}UPDATE 1-Reopening NAFTA could revive debate over what makes a car 'American'(Adds link to graphic, IHS Markit comment)

By Bernie Woodall

DETROIT, Jan 23 (Reuters) - Some of the most popular and profitable vehicles sold in the United States by Detroit's automakers are imported from Mexico, a reality that highlights the risks for the auto industry as the Trump administration pushes to overhaul trade policy.[nL1N1FD126]

President Donald Trump has scheduled a breakfast on Tuesday with the chief executives of Detroit automakers General Motors Co , Ford Motor Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV to talk about bringing more manufacturing jobs to the United States, the White House said on Monday. [nL1N1FD1OX]

Trump campaigned on a pledge to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and said on Monday he would meet leaders of NAFTA partners Mexico and Canada at an "appropriate time" to get the process started. [nL1N1FD1W8]

Auto industry officials expect Trump to urge Canada and Mexico to agree to new tougher "rules of origin" that would require a higher percentage of North American content to be considered tariff free. Under NAFTA, at least 62.5 percent of a passenger car or light truck's net cost must originate in North America - defined as the United States, Canada or Mexico - to avoid tariffs.

Separately, the U.S. government since 1994 tracked the percentage of a vehicle's content that is made in the United States and Canada, and required automakers to disclose those percentages on labels put on vehicles sold in the United States. The Chevrolet Traverse and the Honda Accord made in Ohio had 80 percent U.S. and Canadian content in 2016, for example. The Ram pickup had 59 percent U.S. and Canadian content, according to government data compiled in the 2016 American Automobile Labeling Act report.

Trump has not made specific proposals for reworking NAFTA, but he has called for manufacturers to buy and build more products in the United States.

Automakers have a lot at stake in preserving the status quo.

GM, the biggest U.S. automaker, imported about 315,000 of its full-size Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickup trucks from Mexico last year. That represents about 40 percent of the 2016 U.S. sales of the highly profitable models. Overall, GM builds 14 percent of the vehicles it sells in the United States in Mexico, according to data from LMC Automotive, a consulting firm.

Fiat Chrysler makes nearly half of its Ram full-size pickups, its most popular model, in Mexico, according to data from IHS Markit obtained by Reuters.

Ford earlier this month won praise from Trump for cancelling plans to build a $1.6 billion factory in Mexico. But Ford still plans to build one of its top-selling cars, the Fusion sedan, in Mexico, as well as the future generation of its Focus small car.

Overall, nearly 2 million vehicles were shipped to the United States from Mexico in 2016 by all automakers, and that volume is expected to rise by 14.5 percent this year, according to an IHS Markit forecast.

IHS Markit would not comment on the data Reuters obtained from a third party.

Trump has threatened to slap a 35 percent tariff on vehicles imported from Mexico. But the Center for Automotive Research, an auto industry think tank in Ann Arbor, Michigan, said in a study released this month the tariff could cut U.S. auto sales by 450,000 vehicles per year and cost 6,700 vehicle assembly jobs across North America.

A separate study by LMC Automotive also concluded that U.S. car and light truck sales could suffer if the administration takes a "highly protectionist and isolationist stance." However, if the administration cuts taxes and enacts an infrastructure spending plan, auto sales could rise by 300,000 to 500,000 vehicles a year, LMC forecast.

UPDATE 2-Trump to meet with U.S. auto CEOs amid jobs push - Reuters News

{{20170123T210734.659+0000}}UPDATE 2-Trump to meet with U.S. auto CEOs amid jobs push(Adds background on investments, details)

By David Shepardson

WASHINGTON, Jan 23 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump will have breakfast on Tuesday with the chief executives of General Motors Co , Ford Motor Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV as he pressures automakers to boost American employment.

White House spokesman Sean Spicer said Trump "looks forward to hearing their ideas about how we can work together to bring more jobs back to this industry." Trump has criticized automakers for building cars in Mexico and elsewhere and has threatened to impose 35 percent tariffs on imported vehicles.

The meeting is the latest sign of Trump's uncommon degree of intervention for a U.S. president into corporate affairs as he has repeatedly jawboned automakers and other manufacturers to "buy American and hire American."

It will be the first time the CEOs of the big three automakers meet jointly with a U.S. president since a July 2011 session with President Barack Obama to tout a deal to nearly double fuel efficiency standards to 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025. Fiat Chrysler is the Italian-American parent of the former Michigan-based Chrysler.

U.S. and foreign automakers have been touting plans to boost American jobs and investments in the face of Trump's comments. The Republican president made attacks on Ford's Mexico investments a cornerstone of his campaign.

Automakers have praised Trump's policies, but emphasized that the recent employment moves were the result of business, not political decisions, that had mostly been in the works for a long period.

Early this month, Ford scrapped plans to build a $1.6 billion plant in Mexico and said it would invest $700 million in a factory in Michigan. Ford will still move production of Focus small cars to Mexico but will cut total production of the cars by consolidating their assembly in an existing Mexican plant. [nL1N1ET0OD]

Ford CEO Mark Fields, who was among business leaders meeting with Trump on Monday, said earlier this month that Ford would have made the same investment decision even if Trump had not been elected.

Last week, GM confirmed it would invest an additional $1 billion in its U.S. factories this year and would move some parts production from Mexico to the United States that was previously handled by a supplier. The investments are in addition to $2.9 billion the automaker announced last year, GM said. [nL4N1F74EB]

GM said the $1 billion investment would create or retain 1,500 jobs. GM CEO Mary Barra joined a Trump economic issue advisory panel last month.

Earlier this month, Fiat Chrysler said it would invest $1 billion to modernize two plants in the U.S. Midwest and create 2,000 jobs, and possibly move production of a Ram heavy-duty pickup truck to Michigan from Mexico. [nL1N1EY0GC]

FUEL EFFICIENCY

The auto executives are likely to raise concerns about higher fuel efficiency standards and the potential impact on border adjustment taxes.

Fiat Chrysler faces investigations by the EPA and Justice Department after it was accused this month by the EPA of illegally using hidden software to allow excess diesel emissions to go undetected in about 104,000 U.S. cars and trucks, the result of a probe that stemmed from regulators' investigation of rival Volkswagen AG .

The company vowed to work with the Trump "administration to present its case and resolve this matter fairly and equitably."

Trump tells manufacturers he will cut regulations, taxes - Reuters News

{{20170123T154436.587+0000}}Trump tells manufacturers he will cut regulations, taxesBy Roberta Rampton

WASHINGTON, Jan 23 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump met with a dozen prominent American manufacturers at the White House on Monday, promising them he would slash regulations and cut corporate taxes, but warning them of penalties if they moved production outside the country.

Trump, who took office on Friday, promised to bring manufacturing plants back to the United States during his campaign, and has not hesitated to call out by name companies that he thinks should bring outsourced production back home.

He told the chief executives of Ford, Dow Chemical, Dell Technologies, Tesla and others that he would like to cut corporate taxes to the 15 percent to 20 percent range, down from current statutory levels of 35 percent - a pledge that will require cooperation from the Republican-led U.S. Congress.

But he said business leaders have told him that reducing regulations is even more important.

"We think we can cut regulations by 75 percent. Maybe more," Trump told business leaders in the Roosevelt Room.

"When you want to expand your plant, or when Mark wants to come in and build a big massive plant, or when Dell wants to come in and do something monstrous and special – you're going to have your approvals really fast," Trump said, referring to Mark Fields, CEO of Ford, who sat around the boardroom style table.

The new president told companies that they were welcome to negotiate with governors to move production between states, but said those businesses that choose to move factories outside the country would pay a price.

"We are going to be imposing a very major border tax on the product when it comes in," Trump said.

"A company that wants to fire all of its people in the United States, and build some factory someplace else, and then thinks that that product is going to just flow across the border into the United States - that's not going to happen," he said.

Trump was scheduled to hold a meeting later on Monday with labor leaders and U.S. workers, the White House said.

Trump, a Republican who took over from former Democratic President Barack Obama, was also expected to sign executive orders to renegotiate the free trade agreement between the United States, Canada and Mexico, and to formally withdraw the United States from the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership.

Between winning the presidential election in November and taking office, Trump hosted a number of U.S. CEOs in meetings in New York, including business leaders from defense, technology and other sectors. He also met with leaders of several labor unions, including the AFL-CIO.

Trump, a real estate developer, has particularly focused on manufacturing, lamenting during his inaugural address on Friday about "rusted-out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our nation" and vowing to boost U.S. industries over foreign ones.

{{20170123T143317.112+0000}}Trump to company executives: We think we can cut regulations by 75 pctWASHINGTON, Jan 23 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump told leaders of companies ranging from defense manufacturer Lockheed Martin Corp to sportswear apparel maker Under Armour Inc on Monday that he believed his administration could cut U.S. regulations governing companies by 75 percent or more.

In a meeting with about 10 senior executives at the White House, Trump also reiterated his pledge to impose a hefty border tax on companies that want to import products to the United States after moving American manufacturing facilities abroad. But, he added, those that want to set up factories in the United States will see quick approvals to build.

UPDATE 3-Mexican peso's slump hits Kansas City Southern profit - Reuters News

{{20170120T150205.648+0000}}UPDATE 3-Mexican peso's slump hits Kansas City Southern profit(Adds comments from executives)

By Nick Carey

CHICAGO, Jan 20 (Reuters) - Kansas City Southern on Friday reported a lower quarterly net profit that missed Wall Street estimates by a wide margin as a historic drop in the Mexican peso after the election of President-elect Donald Trump affected the regional U.S. railroad's operations in Mexico.

Just hours before Trump was due to take office in Washington, Kansas City Southern alluded to his criticism of mostly U.S. companies that manufacture goods in Mexico for shipment to the United States - he has singled out automakers for particular criticism, threatening tariffs or a "border tax" on the vehicles they make.

In a conference call with analysts, Chief Executive Patrick Ottensmeyer noted the "political and economic uncertainty" that surrounds the incoming Trump administration and noted that the company was posting results on the day of his inauguration.

"Obviously the political and economic uncertainty is probably first and foremost on most of our minds, and the irony of us reporting earnings on the inauguration day of the 45th President is not entirely lost on us," Ottensmeyer said.

He told analysts that "there are still many questions" about the future of U.S.-Mexican trade relations.

"While we've gotten some indication of the direction of the new administration through the nomination of most of the key trade policy makers, we still don't have definitive answers to several of those questions," Ottensmeyer said.

Trump's trade team is taking shape, but said the railroad was still awaiting "definitive answers" on how the new president will proceed.

Trump has threatened to roll back the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), though it is unclear how that would be done.

One of Kansas City Southern's selling points to investors has been its extensive network in Mexico. When Ford Motor Co announced earlier this month that it was abandoning plans for a plant there and would invest in Michigan instead, the railroad's shares fell 4 percent.

Company executives said Ford's announcement was "disappointing," but added they had seen no indication from other automakers that they would follow suit.

Kansas City Southern said 60 percent of its cross-border business with Mexico is southbound - consisting of car parts, industrial materials, grains and consumer goods. A smaller portion, 40 percent, comes north from Mexico and is mostly consumer goods and finished vehicles.

The Kansas City-based company reported fourth-quarter net income of $120.1 million or $1.12 per share, down from $133.4 million or $1.23 per share a year earlier. Analysts had expected earnings per share of $1.17.

Just over a month ago, analysts had estimated that the railroad would post earnings of $1.22 per share. Kansas City Southern said its earnings would have been 3 percent higher without the impact of the peso.

The railroad's revenue was flat at $598.5 million.

In early Friday trading, company shares were up 3.6 percent at $87.50.

UPDATE 3-Takata bidders plan court-led turnaround for Japan business - source - Reuters News

{{20170119T111752.566+0000}}UPDATE 3-Takata bidders plan court-led turnaround for Japan business - source* Takata has said wants private process for global operations

* Management considering bankruptcy proceedings for U.S. unit

* Autoliv, Key Safety Systems are two remaining bidders - Nikkei

* Takata shares close down 17.3 pct

(Releads with bidders planning court-led turnaround)

By Naomi Tajitsu

TOKYO, Jan 19 (Reuters) - Bidders for Japan's Takata Corp <7312.T> are pushing for a court-mediated turnaround for the embattled air bag maker's domestic business, a source said, a strategy the company opposes and news of which sent its shares tumbling 17 percent.

Takata is in the process of selecting a financial backer as it faces billions of dollars in costs to replace as many as around 100 million potentially defective air bag inflators that have been linked to at least 16 deaths globally. [nL1N1F3140]

Earlier in the day, the Nikkei newspaper reported that Swedish air bag maker Autoliv Inc , and a group led by U.S. auto parts supplier Key Safety Systems (KSS), the two preferred bidding groups for Takata, planned to present their proposals for a court-led restructuring of the Japan operations as early as this week. The source confirmed the plan.

Potential bidders for Takata have long favoured a court-led turnaround of its Japanese operations, which would cap their exposure to Takata's existing liabilities, estimated by some analysts at as high as $10 billion for recall costs alone.

They have also pressed Takata on a bankruptcy filing for its U.S. unit, which the company is considering, sources have told Reuters. [nL4N1D45WT]

Takata, though, has said it would prefer a private, out-of-court process for its operations to ensure the ongoing supply of replacement inflators. Under such an arrangement, Takata's share value may not be completely wiped out, which could be favourable to shareholders including the founding Takada family.

Worries of court involvement drove Takata shares down 17.3 percent to close at 717 yen in their biggest one-day fall in nine-and-a-half months. Before Thursday's slide, the shares had risen more than 150 percent over the prior two months, partly on speculation of an imminent settlement in a U.S. criminal investigation.

The Japan operations account for around 12 percent of Takata's total operating income.

In a statement, Takata said it had nothing to disclose following the newspaper report.

A financial source briefed on the matter told Reuters that U.S. buyout firm Bain Capital was bidding with KSS and Japan's Daicel Corp <4202.T> to rescue Takata. A Bain spokeswoman declined to comment on whether it remained in the running to sponsor Takata. Daicel also declined to comment.

SHARING OF COSTS

A steering committee appointed by Takata nearly a year ago has retained investment bank Lazard Ltd to advise the search for a financial sponsor for the troubled company, which is at the centre of the world's biggest automotive safety recall.

The process to find a backer has been complicated by the fact that the parts maker faces a number of liabilities stemming from the recalls, which began around 2008.

Automakers affected by the recalls, including Honda Motor Co <7267.T>, Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T>, and Ford Motor Co , have been paying for the costs to recall the inflators.

If Takata were to be held solely responsible for the recall, it could be on the hook for around $10 billion, according to estimates from industry experts.

While court involvement may mean car makers may be reimbursed smaller amounts as recall costs by Takata, the Nikkei said they still support such a path because it will provide them with legal cover when convincing shareholders to approve any deal.

"Takata has said its preference was for an out-of-court settlement with creditors, but that doesn't mean that this is how things may turn out," an executive at a Japanese automaker and a Takata client said.

While its financial future remains in limbo, Takata is also struggling to manufacture the massive supply of replacement inflator parts needed for the recalls, and has enlisted competitors, including Autoliv, ZF TRW and Daicel, to help with production.

Last week, Takata agreed to plead guilty to U.S. criminal charges that it manipulated inflator test data provided to its automaker clients, and pay a $1 billion fine which includes compensation paid to victims and automakers. [nL1N1F3140]

Automakers have said that the compensation outlined in the U.S. settlement would do little to cover their recall costs.

"It's just a drop in the bucket compared with the recall costs we have been paying," an official at another Japanese automaker said.

EPA nominee will review vehicle emissions rules - Reuters News

{{20170118T210838.139+0000}}EPA nominee will review vehicle emissions rulesBy David Shepardson

WASHINGTON, Jan 18 (Reuters) - Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt, U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's choice to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, said on Wednesday he will review the Obama administration's recent decision to lock in fuel efficiency rules.

On Friday, outgoing EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy finalized a determination that the landmark fuel efficiency rules instituted by President Barack Obama should be locked in through 2025, a bid to maintain a key part of his administration's climate legacy.

"It merits review and I would review that," Pruitt said during a contentious Senate confirmation hearing, questioning the decision of McCarthy to finalize the determination just two weeks after the public comment period closed on Dec. 30.

Pruitt said separately he would not commit to allowing California to continue its own clean vehicle rules under a 2009 decision by the Obama administration.

Major U.S. and foreign automakers have appealed to Trump, who has been critical of Obama's climate policies, to review the rules requiring them to nearly double fleet-wide fuel efficiency by 2025, saying they impose significant costs and are out of step with consumer preferences.

As part of a 2012 regulation, EPA had to decide by April 2018 whether to modify the 2022-2025 model year vehicle emission rules requiring average fleet-wide efficiency of more than 50 miles per gallon.

In 2011, Obama announced an agreement with major automakers to raise fuel efficiency standards to 54.5 miles per gallon. This, the administration said, would save motorists $1.7 trillion in fuel costs over the life of the vehicles, but cost the auto industry about $200 billion over 13 years.

The EPA said in July that because Americans were buying fewer cars and more SUVs and trucks, it estimated the fleet will average 50.8 mpg to 52.6 mpg in 2025. In November, the agency moved up the timetable for proposing that automakers can meet the 2025 standards.

McCarthy said her determination, a legally binding decision to maintain the fuel efficiency rules, rested on an extensive technical record. She said the rules are "feasible, practical and appropriate" and in "the best interests of the auto industry."

Senator James Inhofe, an Oklahoma Republican, on Wednesday said McCarthy's determination was an "extreme action" that "broke the deal" with automakers.

Legal experts have said it will be more difficult for the Trump administration and Congress to undo the determination than to unwind other regulatory actions issued by the Obama administration during its final months in office.

The 2025 determination is not a new regulation, so the EPA under Trump would likely have to go through an extensive process before withdrawing it and could face lawsuits from environmental groups if that step was taken.

Separately. California's new Democrat Senator Kamala Harris asked Pruitt whether he would commit to upholding the California waiver. Pruitt did not say outright that he would uphold the waiver, which allows California to pursue its own emission standards that are more stringent than the federal rules.

WRAPUP 1-Wal-Mart, GM reaffirm jobs long planned, Trump says thanks - Reuters News

{{20170117T223444.619+0000}}WRAPUP 1-Wal-Mart, GM reaffirm jobs long planned, Trump says thanksBy Nandita Bose

Jan 17 (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc and General Motors Co on Tuesday became the latest companies to win praise from President-elect Donald Trump for adding U.S. jobs and investment, even though much of their plans were previously announced.

Wal-Mart will add 10,000 jobs this year while GM announced $1 billion in investment that would create 1,500 U.S. jobs.

Trump, who takes office on Friday, has repeatedly singled out and criticized U.S. companies across industries for not doing more to keep jobs in the United States and has put pressure on them to hire more U.S. workers. [nL1N1EZ0NU] [nL1N1F701D]

"Thank you to General Motors and Walmart for starting the big jobs push back into the U.S.!" Trump said in a tweet on Tuesday reacting to the moves.

Bringing manufacturing back to the United States was a major theme in Trump's presidential campaign. In a separate tweet he said, "With all of the jobs I am bringing back into the U.S. (even before taking office), with all of the new auto plants coming back into our country ... I believe the people are seeing 'big stuff'."

Announcements by Wal-Mart and GM come as both companies are cutting jobs in the country, and their hiring, which was planned for some time, represent a small increase in their total U.S. workforce.

German drugs and agriculture group Bayer and U.S. seeds company Monsanto Co also pledged on Tuesday to maintain its more than 9,000 U.S. jobs and add 3,000 new U.S. high-tech positions. [nW1N1DA0GH] [nL5N1F76LQ]. Both companies announced plans to create thousands of high-tech U.S. jobs previously when they announced their merger.

Some of America's largest companies including General Motors, Lockheed Martin Corp and United Technologies Corp have been publicly rebuked by Trump on Twitter. Many others are worried they may be his next target - especially if they have significant overseas manufacturing, have cut U.S. jobs or raised prices for consumers.

Trump's criticism of Ford Motor Co on Twitter turned to praise after the carmaker scrapped a planned Mexican car factory and added 700 jobs in Michigan earlier this month. [nL1N1ET0V9]

It has also forced overseas companies that sell in the U.S. market to lift their U.S. investment. Hyundai Motor Group <005380.KS> said it plans to increase investment in the United States by 50 percent to $3.1 billion over five years and may build a new plant. [nL4N1F72KK]

NOT NEW

Both Wal-Mart and GM's new U.S. job plans are also part of previously announced investment plans.

Wal-Mart said it would create 10,000 jobs, equal to less than 1 percent of its U.S. workforce, this year as part of a $6.8 billion capital spending plan announced in October. [nL4N1F73X6]

General Motors said it would invest an additional $1 billion in its U.S. factories and move some production from Mexico - moves that would create or retain 1,500 jobs. As of December 2015, it employed 97,000 U.S. workers. [nL4N1F74BR] [nL1N1F71C9]

GM's announcements also reflected existing plans, not new decisions, company officials and the United Auto Workers union said on Tuesday. The UAW in a statement said the announcement "continues GM investments that have emerged as a result of the 2015 national bargaining agreement" between the union and the automaker.

Both companies have also been cutting jobs recently.

Wal-Mart has been letting thousands of U.S. employees go so it can focus more on e-commerce and putting more staff on the sales floor. GM has also announced plans to lay off about 3,300 employees at three factories in recent months.

Most of Wal-Mart's 10,000 new employees, including hourly workers, department managers and supervisors, will be in 59 new stores that will be opened in the fiscal year beginning in February. The retailer opened 130 stores in the current fiscal year.

RPT--Wilbur Ross, Trump's Commerce pick, offshored 2,700 jobs since 2004  - Reuters News

By Andy Sullivan

WASHINGTON, Jan 17 (Reuters) - Billionaire Wilbur Ross, chosen by Donald Trump to help implement the president-elect's trade agenda, earned his fortune in part by running businesses that have offshored thousands of U.S. jobs, according to Labor Department data attained by Reuters.

As a high-stakes investor a decade ago, Ross specialized in turning around troubled manufacturing companies at a time when the U.S. economy was losing more than 100,000 jobs yearly due to global trade. A Senate confirmation hearing on his nomination to become commerce secretary is set for Wednesday.

Supporters say Ross saved thousands of U.S. jobs by rescuing firms from failure. Data attained by Reuters through a Freedom of Information Act request shows that rescue effort came at a price: textile, finance and auto-parts companies controlled by the private-equity titan eliminated about 2,700 U.S. positions since 2004 because they shipped production to other countries, according to a Labor Department program that assists workers who lose their jobs due to global trade. [For a graphic click http://tmsnrt.rs/2iYIJWa ]

The figures, which have not previously been disclosed, amount to a small fraction of the U.S. economy, which sees employment fluctuate by the tens of thousands of jobs each month. But Ross's track record clashes with Trump's promise to protect American workers from the ravages of global trade.

Recently, Trump claimed credit for saving 800 jobs at a Carrier Corp. factory in Indiana, even touring the plant to shake hands with employees. He has targeted Ford Motor Co and other automakers to keep hundreds of jobs inside the U.S. borders.

That disconnect could draw attention at his hearing, one of many scheduled this week for Cabinet nominees ahead of Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration.

"He is not the man to be protecting American workers when he's shipping this stuff overseas himself," said Don Coy, who lost his job at the end of 2016 when a company Ross created - International Automotive Components Group - closed a factory in Canton, Ohio and shifted production of rubber floor mats to Mexico, eliminating the final 16 jobs in a factory that once employed 450 workers.

Ross resigned from the IAC board of directors in November 2014 and was named chairman emeritus.

Ross did not respond to several requests for comment. His offshoring activities are not unusual in an era when globalization has lowered international trade barriers. Auto-parts maker Delphi Corp., for example, has offshored 11,700 U.S. jobs since 2004, while textile makers have offshored at least 17,000 jobs since then, the Labor Department said.

As IAC shuttered its Canton plant in the final months of 2016, Ross argued on behalf of Trump that free-trade agreements hurt the United States.

"When Ford offshores new production facilities to Mexico, that both boosts the Mexican economy and reduces investment in this country," he wrote in September in a Washington Post opinion piece penned with Peter Navarro, another Trump economic adviser who has been tapped to direct a White House trade council.

In a bid to reverse offshoring, Trump has threatened to impose "a big border tax" on automakers that choose to build cars in Mexico rather than the United States and has talked of resetting free-trade deals such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).

A Trump transition spokesperson said personnel decisions at Ross's auto-parts and textile companies were driven by the need to put operations near customers and keep U.S. plants competitive, echoing arguments made by other auto industry executives who face pressure from Trump.

"Few people have done as much to defend American jobs and negotiate good deals for American workers as Wilbur Ross," said the spokesperson, who asked not to be named.

The offshoring figures for Ross's companies came from the Labor Department's Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) program, which provides retraining benefits to some workers who lose their jobs due to outsourcing or cheap imports. The program does not cover everybody who is hurt by global trade: service-sector workers were not eligible until 2009, and those who don't apply for the program don't show up in its records.

Only 1.6 million factory workers qualified for TAA benefits between 2001 and 2010, a time when the United States shed 6 million manufacturing jobs.

Despite Trump's campaign rhetoric about countries like Mexico and China taking U.S. jobs, the TAA figures show globalization has claimed fewer jobs in recent years. The program covered roughly 80,000 workers last year, down from about 340,000 in 2009. [For a graphic, click http://tmsnrt.rs/2iYGJgR ]

CUTTING JOBS TO SAVE OTHERS

Ross amassed a fortune, estimated by Forbes magazine at $2.5 billion, by buying up companies in struggling industries and returning them to profitability. Labor leaders such as United Steelworkers president Leo Gerard have said that Ross over the years saved thousands of manufacturing jobs.

In one case, Ross bought two struggling North Carolina fabric makers out of bankruptcy to create International Textile Group (ITG) in 2004, as textile import quotas were being phased out. Between 2005 and 2011, the company laid off 1,268 U.S. workers as it set up operations in Mexico, China and Nicaragua, TAA records show. ITG CEO Ken Kunenberger told Reuters that those job reductions were primarily due to competition from cheap imports.

ITG now operates six U.S. plants, down from nine in 2007, according to its annual reports. Ross sold the company in October for an undisclosed sum.

Ross also created International Automotive Components Group in 2007 to buy up auto-parts makers around the world as the industry struggled with overcapacity and slowing sales. TAA filings show IAC eliminated 853 U.S. jobs because it shifted work from the United States to Mexico.

"We tried every trick in the book to get them to stay but they just weren't interested," said Tim Scott, who served on the city council in Carlisle, Pennsylvania when IAC decided to close its plant there in 2009, shifting work to Mexico and Tennessee.

An IAC spokesperson said the company has expanded in Mexico to be near the automakers that buy its parts, a common business strategy in the sector.

IAC has expanded its workforce in Mexico and Canada by 42 percent to 8,500 since 2008, and by 10 percent in the United States to 11,000 over the same period, spokesman David Ladd said.

In another venture, Ross combined several mortgage lenders into Homeward Residential Holdings Inc. in 2007, just as the housing market was collapsing.

Homeward laid off 596 employees in Florida and Texas and shifted their work to India in 2012, according to TAA filings. That was a sizeable portion of the company's global workforce, which it pegged at 2,800 a few months after the layoffs were announced.

Ross sold Homeward in October 2012 for $750 million, which delivered a further return on top of $900 million in profits the company had already generated.

"Homeward has been profitable in each year of its existence," he said in a press release.

General Motors to announce $1 bln in U.S. investment - Reuters News

{{20170117T025020.980+0000}}General Motors to announce $1 bln in U.S. investmentBy David Shepardson

WASHINGTON, Jan 16 (Reuters) - General Motors Co will announce as early as Tuesday long-held plans to invest about $1 billion in its U.S. factories, following recent criticism of the company by President-elect Donald Trump, a person briefed on the matter told Reuters late on Monday.

The largest U.S. automaker is making the decision for business and not political reasons, said the person, who asked not to be identified.

The investment will help GM create or retain more than 1,000 jobs, while the automaker also plans to tout other efforts to boost U.S. employment, including adding engineers, the person added.

GM General Counsel Craig Glidden told the Wall Street Journal, which reported the company's plans earlier on Monday, that any investment the company might disclose had been long planned and was not a response to Trump's criticism.

GM declined comment on the investment to Reuters.

Since the beginning of this year, GM has come under heavy criticism from Trump for building vehicles in Mexico, as have other automakers. On Jan. 3, Trump threatened to impose a "big border tax" on GM for making some of its Chevrolet Cruze compact cars in Mexico.

At a news conference last week, Trump cited recent U.S. investments by other automakers and said "General Motors will be following, and I think they will be."

Trump, who campaigned hard on bringing manufacturing jobs back to the United States, said in an interview with German newspaper Bild published on Monday that he would impose a border tax of 35 percent on German car companies' vehicles imported to the U.S. market.

Earlier this month he criticized Toyota Motor Corp's <7203.T> plans to move production of the Corolla to Mexico from Canada.

Auto sales have been rising since 2009 and hit a new record in 2016. Automakers have recently been touting American investments, but say the investments have not been in response to Trump.

Last week, Japan's Toyota said it would invest $10 billion in the United States over the next five years, while Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV said it would invest $1 billion to modernize two plants in the Midwest, creating 2,000 jobs.

Ford Motor Co announced this month it would cancel a planned $1.6 billion factory in Mexico and would invest $700 million at a Michigan plant.

GM's "general plan is to build where we sell and we're focused on what we're doing in the United States," Chief Executive Mary Barra said in an interview with Reuters on the sidelines of an event in Washington on Monday. "We're a global company so we're going to continue that focus."

Barra, who told Reuters she planned to attend Trump's inauguration on Friday, said GM wants to work with him. "I do believe we have more in common than we have areas that we aren't aligned."

GM, which has more than 40 manufacturing sites in the United States, last year announced $2.9 billion in U.S. investments

But even as GM invests in U.S. plants, it has also been making job cuts. In recent months, GM announced plans to lay off about 3,300 employees at three factories.

It said in November it would cut about 2,000 jobs when it ends the third shift at its Lordstown, Ohio and Lansing, Michigan plants in January. Last month it said it planned to cancel the second shift and cut nearly 1,300 jobs from its Detroit-Hamtramck assembly plant in March.

FACTBOX-Global carmakers' operations in Mexico - Reuters News

{{20170116T153621.038+0000}}FACTBOX-Global carmakers' operations in MexicoJan 16 (Reuters) - U.S. President-elect Donald Trump warned German car companies he would impose a border tax of 35 percent on vehicles imported to the U.S. market from Mexico, singling out luxury carmaker BMW for criticism following previous broadsides aimed at General Motors, Ford and Toyota. [nL5N1F61VQ]

Mexico accounts for a fifth of all vehicle production in North America and has attracted more than $24 billion in auto investment since 2010, according to the Michigan-based Center for Automotive Research.

Auto assembly is projected to more than double in size between 2010 and 2020 as carmakers invest around $13 billion to move 3.3 million units of capacity from Japan, Germany and South Korea. Carmakers are attracted by Mexico's unique free trade position as well as lower labour costs.

Below are some facts on the operations of the main global carmakers with plants in Mexico. Production figures are according to the Mexican Automotive Industry Association.

NISSAN <7201.T>

2015 production: 822,948 vehicles

Nissan is the largest automaker operating in Mexico. It built its first overseas plant in Mexico 50 years ago and now produces mainly its entry-level Versa and Sentra sedans there. It exports roughly half of its output to the United States, where it also has production plants. Nissan and Renault Chief Executive Carlos Ghosn said this month he was watching the incoming Trump administration closely and would respond to whatever policies it adopts. [nL4N1EW49O]

GENERAL MOTORS

2015 production: 690,446

Trump has criticised GM for building cars in Mexico while laying off workers in the United States. GM said in 2015 it would invest $350 million to produce its next-generation Chevrolet Cruze compact cars in Mexico, as part of a $5 billion investment in its Mexican plants announced in 2014, creating 5,600 jobs. It has defended the arrangement as part of its strategy to serve global customers. In November, GM said it planned to lay off 2,000 employees at two U.S. auto plants in early 2017. When asked earlier this month about the company's plans for investments in Mexico, GM CEO Mary Barra said she could not comment, but emphasised a willingness to cooperate with the incoming Trump administration.

FIAT-CHRYSLER

2015 production: 503,589

Fiat Chrysler CEO Sergio Marchionne said this month that uncertainty over Trump's trade and tax policies could lead automakers to delay investments in Mexico, and confirmed plans to create 2,000 jobs at his company's U.S. factories with an investment of $1 billion. He said he had not made a decision on whether to move production of certain Ram heavy-duty pickups from Mexico to the Unites States. "If tomorrow morning President-elect Trump decides to impose a border tax on anything that comes up from Mexico, then we'll have to adjust," he said. [nL1N1EY0GC]

VOLKSWAGEN

2015 production: 457,517

Volkswagen has had a plant in Mexico for 50 years and is not shifting any jobs to Mexico from the United States. It has around 16,500 employees in Mexico, who built 345,000 engines as well as cars in 2015. In the United States, it has around 3,200 workers at its plant in Chattanooga, Tennessee which built 87,000 cars in 2015. It plans to invest $7 billion in the United States between 2015 and 2019. Its Audi luxury car brand opened a $1.3 billion factory in Mexico last year, its first in the country and eventually slated to be its only source globally for its Q5 SUVs. It plans initial production of 150,000 cars a year.

FORD

2015 production: 433,752

Ford scrapped a planned $1.6 billion Mexican car factory this month and added 700 jobs at a cost of $700 million in Michigan following criticism by Trump. It said it was a response to a decline in North American demand for small cars like those that would have been made at the plant, and CEO Mark Fields said Ford would have made the same decision even had Trump not been elected. Ford still plans to shift production from Michigan of its Focus compact car to an existing plant in Mexico. [nL1N1EW1XY]

HONDA <7267.T>

2015 production: 203,657

Honda has two auto plants in Mexico, which together build around 100,000 motorcycles a year as well as cars. Vehicles made in Mexico comprise less than 10 percent of Honda's total U.S. vehicle sales. Honda said in October it was shifting production of the new generation of its CR-V sport utility vehicle to the United States from Mexico. But its president said it had no immediate plans to curb production in Mexico, preferring to wait until after Trump's inauguration.

MAZDA <7261.T>

2015 production: 182,357

Mazda began producing cars in Mexico in 2014, with production of the Mazda3 sedan for the United States. Vehicles made in Mexico comprise around 30 percent of Mazda's total U.S. vehicle sales.

TOYOTA <7203.T>

2015 production: 104,810

Toyota plans to raise output from its plant in Baja California, Mexico to around 160,000 units by 2018. It is also building a plant in Guanajuato city which will have an annual capacity of 200,000 when it comes online in 2019. Trump took on Toyota earlier this month, warning the world's largest automaker that it would face a "big border tax" if it exported Mexico-built cars to the U.S. market. Toyota President Akio Toyoda said in response: "We're always considering ways to increase production in the United States, regardless of the political situation." Vehicles made in Mexico comprise less than 10 percent of Toyota's total U.S. vehicle sales. But it has said its Guanajuato plant under construction in Mexico will produce the entry-level Corolla sedan, a vehicle segment currently produced at its plants in Mississippi, Missouri, and Ontario, Canada.

Toyota plans to invest $10 billion in the United States over the next five years, the same as in the previous five years. [nL4N1EW042]

KIA <000270.KS>, HYUNDAI <005380.KS>

Kia is building a $1 billion plant in Mexico, with a capacity of 300,000 vehicles a year, to cater for demand from North and South America. Affiliate Hyundai also plans to build its Accent small car at the Kia factory this year, two people familiar with the matter have told Reuters, shifting output out of high-cost South Korea. It will be the first Hyundai car to be made in Mexico.

BMW

BMW is building a new plant in Mexico, where it plans to invest $2.2 billion by 2019 for annual production of 150,000 cars, with the output intended for the world market. It also has sizeable factories in the United States, where it builds higher-margin SUVs for export to Asia and Europe.

DAIMLER

Daimler has said it plans to begin assembling Mercedes-Benz vehicles in 2018 from a $1 billion facility shared with Renault-Nissan , <7201.T> in Aguascalientes in Mexico.

UPDATE 1-Ford S.Africa recalls Kugas after cars burst into flames - Reuters News

{{20170116T151642.163+0000}}UPDATE 1-Ford S.Africa recalls Kugas after cars burst into flames(Adds quotes, details)

CAPE TOWN, Jan 16 (Reuters) - U.S. auto-maker Ford will recall 4,500 Kuga SUVs sold in South Africa after dozens of reports of the vehicles catching fire spontaneously, the head of the company's South Africa unit said on Monday.

In a joint statement with the National Consumer Commission (NCC), Ford's Southern Africa President and chief executive Jeff Nemeth said the company could confirm 39 incidents of the cars catching fire.

"We are not aware of any injuries that have resulted from our engine compartment fires," Nemeth told a media briefing.

He said early investigations revealed that fires in the Kuga 1.6 litre model, imported from Spain, were likely due to overheating caused by a lack of coolant circulation which could lead to a crack in the cylinder head and oil leaks.

If oil reached a hot engine component it could catch fire, Nemeth said. Ford officials said at the briefing that hot weather in South Africa could be a contributing factor.

The voluntary recall of the 4,500 cars is down from a previous estimate of 6,300, and will only affect Kuga models built between December 2012 and February 2014.

Nemeth refused to reveal the cost of the recall to Ford, which will replace affected components on the cooling system, update software and conduct tests on cylinder heads. In October, the company's North American arm recalled 400,000 units of the Ford Escape - the U.S. version of the Kuga - also due to engine problems. [nFWN1CW122] "A product that poses any risk to our consumers does not have a place in our market place," NCC commissioner Ebrahim Mohamed said at the briefing.

ANALYSIS-China, Europe drive shift to electric cars as U.S. lags - Reuters News

{{20170115T140001.242+0000}}ANALYSIS-China, Europe drive shift to electric cars as U.S. lagsBy Laurence Frost

DETROIT, Jan 15 (Reuters) - Electric cars will pick up critical momentum in 2017, many in the auto industry believe - just not in North America.

Tighter emissions rules in China and Europe leave global carmakers and some consumers with little choice but to embrace plug-in vehicles, fuelling an investment surge, said industry executives gathered in Detroit this past week for the city's annual auto show.

"Car electrification is an irreversible trend," said Jacques Aschenbroich, chief executive of auto supplier Valeo , which has expanded sales by 50 percent in five years with a focus on electric, hybrid, connected and self-driving cars.

In Europe, green cars benefit increasingly from subsidies, tax breaks and other perks, while combustion engines face mounting penalties including driving and parking restrictions.

China, struggling with catastrophic pollution levels in major cities, is aggressively pushing plug-in vehicles. Its carrot-and-stick approach combines tens of billions in investment and research funding with subsidies, and regulations designed to discourage driving fossil-fueled cars in big cities. [nL4N1F21Z7]

The road ahead for electric vehicles (EVs) in the United States, however, could have more hairpin curves.

Regulators in California and a group of other U.S. states are pushing ahead with state-level rules mandating rising quotas for electric, or "zero emission" vehicles.

But plug-in registrations in the United States fell in 2015, and the market share of electric-only vehicles declined further to 0.37 percent in 2016, as cheap fuel drove demand for gas-guzzling sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks. [nL1N1F010Q][nL1N1EZ1MT]

President-elect Donald Trump has pledged to roll back environmental and climate rules. Groups representing established automakers asked Trump to review Obama administration fuel economy targets out to 2025, even before the outgoing administration formally signed them into effect on Friday. [nL1N1F30SU]

Automakers have also asked Trump to work toward a single, national set of rules to govern automotive greenhouse gas emissions, a move that could spark legal challenges to electric car quotas in California and other states on grounds they present a separate standard.

"THE WORLD IS GOING ELECTRIC"

Still, industry executives in Detroit said hitting the brakes on electric vehicles in the United States would not relieve the pressure to bring them to market, because China and Europe are forging ahead with policies to expand sales of plug-in cars.

That is why Ford is moving forward with previously announced plans to invest $4.5 billion for plug-in vehicles by 2020, Chief Executive Mark Fields said earlier this month.

"The industry is changing, the infrastructure's starting to build, and that's why our view is (that) within the next 15 years we'll see more electrified offerings … than we'll see gasoline-powered," Fields said as he unveiled a $700 million plan to build a battery SUV and other plug-in vehicles in Flat Rock, Michigan. [nL1N1ET0V9]

To drive the shift to electric, industry executives said they needed more help from governments.

In China, Europe and the United States, automakers are advocating new infrastructure money go to public electric car charging networks.

In the United States, EV manufacturers are pushing for the continuation of a $7,500 federal tax subsidy for consumers who buy a fully electric car. Even if Trump were to try to eliminate it, it would take time as Congress would have to act.

"There is not a disagreement that the world is going electric," California Air Resources Board Chair Mary Nichols said on the sidelines of the auto show, noting that all vehicle makers were now investing in electric models across their entire product lines. The debate, she said, was "over timing, not the goal."

The Chinese electric car market cast its shadow over the Detroit auto show, where manufacturers showed off plug-in hybrid and electric models that will likely do scant business in the United States.

IHS Automotive predicts Chinese plug-in deliveries will hit 1 million in 2019, four years before the United States. China pulled ahead in 2015 with a fourfold sales surge before adding 55 percent last year to 348,000 vehicles, with the United States at 138,000.

"Look to China rather than the U.S. for the future of electric cars," Gerard Detourbet, a Renault-Nissan executive leading low-cost plug-in development, said recently. "China is compelled to act that's the main difference."

UPDATE 1-Mexico will 'immediately' respond to any US border tax -minister - Reuters News

{{20170113T205838.169+0000}}UPDATE 1-Mexico will 'immediately' respond to any US border tax -minister(Adds minister comment on Trump, Toyota, investment figure)

MEXICO CITY, Jan 13 (Reuters) - Mexico must be ready to respond immediately with its own tax measures if the incoming administration of President-elect Donald Trump imposes a border tax, the economy minister said on Friday, warning such protectionism may trigger a global recession.

Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20, has promised a "major border tax" on companies that shift jobs outside the United States, and such a measure could hobble Mexico's exports to its top trading partner. [nL1N1F11XR]

"It is clear we need to be prepared to immediately neutralize the impact of such a measure," Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo said in an interview on Mexican television.

"And it is very clear how - take a fiscal action that clearly neutralizes it," he said.

Trump has repeatedly attacked Mexico over trade, jobs and immigration since he first launched his run for the White House in 2015, driving the peso currency to historic lows and unnerving investors, especially in the auto sector.

Guajardo said Trump's proposed tax "was a problem for the entire world" and that it "would have a wave of impacts that could take us into a global recession."

Nonetheless, the minister said he expected foreign direct investment in Mexico this year to total around $25 billion, with investment in the energy and telecommunications sectors expected to more than make up for the loss of a planned $1.6 billion Ford Motor Co. factory that the company said this month it is cancelling. Trump had strongly criticized the plan, but Ford said its decision was not the result of pressure from Trump. [nL1N1ET0OD]

Guajardo also praised the government of Japan and Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T> for their "reasonable" response to Trump's threat to impose a significant border tax if the company does not stop making its Corolla model in Mexico for the U.S. market. Toyota said last week the automaker has no immediate plans to curb production in Mexico. [nL1N1EV1FV]

"Toyota has 10 plants in the United States... and employs more than 130,000 Americans. If I were Mr. Trump, I'd treat them with more respect," Guajardo said.

He added that he expects total foreign direct investment during the six-year term of President Enrique Pena Nieto, which ends in late 2018, to average $30 billion annually.

Guajardo has previously warned that U.S. corporate tax cuts proposed by Trump, as well as the border tax, could undermine foreign investment in Latin America's No. 2 economy. [nL1N1EU1D8]

Mexico slapped a tax on U.S. high fructose corn syrup in the early 2000s after the United States refused to allow free trade in Mexican sugar.

UPDATE 2-U.S. EPA locks in 2025 fuel efficiency rules - Reuters News

{{20170113T153858.626+0000}}UPDATE 2-U.S. EPA locks in 2025 fuel efficiency rules(Adds environmental reaction, more details on rules)

By David Shepardson

WASHINGTON, Jan 13 (Reuters) - U.S. Environmental Protection Agency chief Gina McCarthy on Friday finalized a determination that the landmark fuel efficiency rules instituted by President Barack Obama should be locked in through 2025, a bid to maintain a key part of his administration's climate legacy.

Major U.S. and foreign automakers have appealed to President-elect Donald Trump, who has been critical of Obama's climate policies, to review the rules requiring them to nearly double fleet-wide fuel efficiency by 2025, saying they impose significant costs and are out of step with consumer preferences.

As part of a 2012 regulation, EPA had to decide by April 2018 whether to modify the 2022-2025 model year vehicle emission rules requiring average fleet-wide efficiency of more than 50 miles per gallon. In November, the agency moved up the timetable for proposing that automakers can meet the 2025 standards.

McCarthy said in a statement her determination, a legally binding decision to maintain the fuel efficiency rules, rests on an extensive technical record.

McCarthy said in her determination the rules are "feasible, practical and appropriate" and in "the best interests of the auto industry."

She told automakers the EPA could consider adopting new rules "to provide additional incentives for very clean technologies or flexibilities that could assist manufacturers with longer term planning."

In 2011, Obama announced agreement with major automakers to raise fuel efficiency standards to 54.5 miles per gallon. This, the administration said, would save motorists $1.7 trillion in fuel costs over the life of the vehicles, but cost the auto industry about $200 billion over 13 years.

In July, EPA said because Americans were buying fewer cars and more SUVs and trucks, it now estimated the fleet will average 50.8 mpg to 52.6 mpg in 2025.

Gloria Bergquist, a spokeswoman for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a trade association representing General Motors Co , Ford Motor Co , Toyota Motor Corp<7203.T> , Volkswagen AG and others, criticized the decision.

"Our fundamental priority remains striking the right balance to continue fuel economy gains and carbon reduction without compromising consumer affordability and vital auto-sector jobs," she said.

Automakers hope to work with regulators and California, Bergquist said, "to see whether we can find a prudent compromise path forward that avoids an unnecessary and counterproductive regulatory collision."

Environmental groups praised the decision.

Ken Kimmell, president of the Union of Concerned Scientists, said the standards were working.

"Automakers have the technologies to continue their progress in a cost-effective way. It will keep us on track to reduce oil use by 2.4 million barrels a day, cut global warming emissions and keep American-made vehicles competitive in a rapidly-changing global market," he said.

Legal experts have said it will be more difficult for the Trump administration and Congress to undo the determination than to unwind other regulatory actions issued by the Obama administration during its final months in office.

The 2025 determination is not a new regulation, so the EPA, under Trump, would likely have to go through an extensive process before withdrawing the determination, and could face lawsuits from environmental groups if they took that step.

Sierra Club Executive Director Michael Brune said in a statement "a new administration is no reason to shift progress to reverse."

Back home: Honda brings Civic sedan to Japan in branding push - Reuters News

{{20170113T020002.412+0000}}Back home: Honda brings Civic sedan to Japan in branding push* Honda to sell Civic sedan in Japan for first time since 2010

* Honda considering making Civic in Japan for U.S. export

* Civic is Honda's best-selling car in the United States

By Naomi Tajitsu

TOKYO, Jan 13 (Reuters) - Honda Motor Co <7267.T> is bringing the Civic sedan back home after seven years, betting buoyant overseas demand for the model would help drive sales in Japan and allow the automaker to shake off its domestic image as a maker of only minivans and compacts.

Allocating manufacturing capacity for the Civic in Japan may also enable Honda to free up production space in the United States, where the market for sedans is shrinking in favour of SUVs, at a time when U.S. President-elect Donald Trump is pushing automakers to make more cars in the country.

Honda on Friday said it would market the 2016 Civic sedan in Japan from summer, selling the locally made model in the country for the first time since 2010 - the year it stopped domestic production due to sluggish sales. The carmaker will also consider producing Civics in Japan for U.S. export.

Kimiyoshi Teratani, who heads Honda's Japan operations, said he hoped the Civic would help the firm regain its reputation as a maker of "sporty cars with attitude" in Japan, after years of focusing on popular entry level models and multi-purpose vehicles including the N-Box minicar and the Odyssey minivan.

"We've become known as a company specialising in minivans and 'kei' cars, and we realised our offering of 'Honda-esque' cars has become increasingly weak," he told reporters in Tokyo.

"The Civic may not be the NSX (Honda's supercar also marketed under the Acura brand), but it's another model we'd like to use to raise our brand image," he said.

Introduced in 1972, the Civic has sold 24 million units worldwide and is Honda's best-selling model in the United States, the automaker's biggest market.

The Civic posted record annual sales in 2016 in the world's No.2 auto market after the latest revamped version of the sedan was named the North American Car of the Year last year. Previous versions of the sedan had been criticised for their lack of reliability and uninspiring design.

However, given waning U.S. sedan demand, Honda has said it would consider shuffling its production portfolio in favour of its SUV models in the United States. [nL8N1DA3M9]

Teratani declined to comment on when the company may start manufacturing the Civic sedan in Japan for U.S. exports.

"We'd like to consider political developments and circumstances before determining the best way forward," he said.

Increasing U.S.-bound auto exports may rankle Trump, who has threatened automakers including Ford Motor Co. and Toyota Motor Corp. <7203.T> with high border taxes on cars imported from Mexico, a growing auto production hub. [nL1N1EZ1CP]

Ford expands Takata air bag recall, now affects 3 million vehicles  - Reuters News

{{20170112T154854.860+0000}}Ford expands Takata air bag recall, now affects 3 million vehicles DETROIT, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co said on Thursday it will recall about 816,000 vehicles as it widened previous actions affecting models with Takata Corp <7312.T> air bags.

The move brings the number of vehicles with Takata air bag inflators recalled around the world by Ford to 3 million, most of them in the United States and Canada.

The fresh recall by Ford follows one on Monday by Honda Motor Co <7267.T> for about 1.3 million vehicles in the United States. That brought the total of U.S.-registered Honda vehicles recalled for Takata issues to about 11.4 million.

Globally, Honda has recalled 51 million Takata air bag inflators, and a smaller number of Honda brand and luxury Acura brand vehicles, because some of the models have been involved in more than one recall for the inflators.

Many of the vehicles involved in the Ford and Honda recalls this week were included in previous recalls for slightly different reasons, such as the location of the air bags. The recalls this week were both for passenger-side front air bags.

Honda also recalled about 900 Gold Wing motorcycles for Takata air bag issues in the United States, bringing the total of U.S.-registered Gold Wing motorcycles recalled to about 3,600.

There have been 11 reported deaths in the United States due to defective Takata air bags, ten of which involved Honda vehicles and one a Ford vehicle. All 11 deaths involved driver-side air bags.

UPDATE 2-U.S. EPA locks in 2025 fuel efficiency rules - Reuters News

{{20170113T153858.626+0000}}UPDATE 2-U.S. EPA locks in 2025 fuel efficiency rules(Adds environmental reaction, more details on rules)

By David Shepardson

WASHINGTON, Jan 13 (Reuters) - U.S. Environmental Protection Agency chief Gina McCarthy on Friday finalized a determination that the landmark fuel efficiency rules instituted by President Barack Obama should be locked in through 2025, a bid to maintain a key part of his administration's climate legacy.

Major U.S. and foreign automakers have appealed to President-elect Donald Trump, who has been critical of Obama's climate policies, to review the rules requiring them to nearly double fleet-wide fuel efficiency by 2025, saying they impose significant costs and are out of step with consumer preferences.

As part of a 2012 regulation, EPA had to decide by April 2018 whether to modify the 2022-2025 model year vehicle emission rules requiring average fleet-wide efficiency of more than 50 miles per gallon. In November, the agency moved up the timetable for proposing that automakers can meet the 2025 standards.

McCarthy said in a statement her determination, a legally binding decision to maintain the fuel efficiency rules, rests on an extensive technical record.

McCarthy said in her determination the rules are "feasible, practical and appropriate" and in "the best interests of the auto industry."

She told automakers the EPA could consider adopting new rules "to provide additional incentives for very clean technologies or flexibilities that could assist manufacturers with longer term planning."

In 2011, Obama announced agreement with major automakers to raise fuel efficiency standards to 54.5 miles per gallon. This, the administration said, would save motorists $1.7 trillion in fuel costs over the life of the vehicles, but cost the auto industry about $200 billion over 13 years.

In July, EPA said because Americans were buying fewer cars and more SUVs and trucks, it now estimated the fleet will average 50.8 mpg to 52.6 mpg in 2025.

Gloria Bergquist, a spokeswoman for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a trade association representing General Motors Co , Ford Motor Co , Toyota Motor Corp<7203.T> , Volkswagen AG and others, criticized the decision.

"Our fundamental priority remains striking the right balance to continue fuel economy gains and carbon reduction without compromising consumer affordability and vital auto-sector jobs," she said.

Automakers hope to work with regulators and California, Bergquist said, "to see whether we can find a prudent compromise path forward that avoids an unnecessary and counterproductive regulatory collision."

Environmental groups praised the decision.

Ken Kimmell, president of the Union of Concerned Scientists, said the standards were working.

"Automakers have the technologies to continue their progress in a cost-effective way. It will keep us on track to reduce oil use by 2.4 million barrels a day, cut global warming emissions and keep American-made vehicles competitive in a rapidly-changing global market," he said.

Legal experts have said it will be more difficult for the Trump administration and Congress to undo the determination than to unwind other regulatory actions issued by the Obama administration during its final months in office.

The 2025 determination is not a new regulation, so the EPA, under Trump, would likely have to go through an extensive process before withdrawing the determination, and could face lawsuits from environmental groups if they took that step.

Sierra Club Executive Director Michael Brune said in a statement "a new administration is no reason to shift progress to reverse."

Back home: Honda brings Civic sedan to Japan in branding push - Reuters News

{{20170113T020002.412+0000}}Back home: Honda brings Civic sedan to Japan in branding push* Honda to sell Civic sedan in Japan for first time since 2010

* Honda considering making Civic in Japan for U.S. export

* Civic is Honda's best-selling car in the United States

By Naomi Tajitsu

TOKYO, Jan 13 (Reuters) - Honda Motor Co <7267.T> is bringing the Civic sedan back home after seven years, betting buoyant overseas demand for the model would help drive sales in Japan and allow the automaker to shake off its domestic image as a maker of only minivans and compacts.

Allocating manufacturing capacity for the Civic in Japan may also enable Honda to free up production space in the United States, where the market for sedans is shrinking in favour of SUVs, at a time when U.S. President-elect Donald Trump is pushing automakers to make more cars in the country.

Honda on Friday said it would market the 2016 Civic sedan in Japan from summer, selling the locally made model in the country for the first time since 2010 - the year it stopped domestic production due to sluggish sales. The carmaker will also consider producing Civics in Japan for U.S. export.

Kimiyoshi Teratani, who heads Honda's Japan operations, said he hoped the Civic would help the firm regain its reputation as a maker of "sporty cars with attitude" in Japan, after years of focusing on popular entry level models and multi-purpose vehicles including the N-Box minicar and the Odyssey minivan.

"We've become known as a company specialising in minivans and 'kei' cars, and we realised our offering of 'Honda-esque' cars has become increasingly weak," he told reporters in Tokyo.

"The Civic may not be the NSX (Honda's supercar also marketed under the Acura brand), but it's another model we'd like to use to raise our brand image," he said.

Introduced in 1972, the Civic has sold 24 million units worldwide and is Honda's best-selling model in the United States, the automaker's biggest market.

The Civic posted record annual sales in 2016 in the world's No.2 auto market after the latest revamped version of the sedan was named the North American Car of the Year last year. Previous versions of the sedan had been criticised for their lack of reliability and uninspiring design.

However, given waning U.S. sedan demand, Honda has said it would consider shuffling its production portfolio in favour of its SUV models in the United States. [nL8N1DA3M9]

Teratani declined to comment on when the company may start manufacturing the Civic sedan in Japan for U.S. exports.

"We'd like to consider political developments and circumstances before determining the best way forward," he said.

Increasing U.S.-bound auto exports may rankle Trump, who has threatened automakers including Ford Motor Co. and Toyota Motor Corp. <7203.T> with high border taxes on cars imported from Mexico, a growing auto production hub. [nL1N1EZ1CP]

Ford expands Takata air bag recall, now affects 3 million vehicles  - Reuters News

{{20170112T154854.860+0000}}Ford expands Takata air bag recall, now affects 3 million vehicles DETROIT, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co said on Thursday it will recall about 816,000 vehicles as it widened previous actions affecting models with Takata Corp <7312.T> air bags.

The move brings the number of vehicles with Takata air bag inflators recalled around the world by Ford to 3 million, most of them in the United States and Canada.

The fresh recall by Ford follows one on Monday by Honda Motor Co <7267.T> for about 1.3 million vehicles in the United States. That brought the total of U.S.-registered Honda vehicles recalled for Takata issues to about 11.4 million.

Globally, Honda has recalled 51 million Takata air bag inflators, and a smaller number of Honda brand and luxury Acura brand vehicles, because some of the models have been involved in more than one recall for the inflators.

Many of the vehicles involved in the Ford and Honda recalls this week were included in previous recalls for slightly different reasons, such as the location of the air bags. The recalls this week were both for passenger-side front air bags.

Honda also recalled about 900 Gold Wing motorcycles for Takata air bag issues in the United States, bringing the total of U.S.-registered Gold Wing motorcycles recalled to about 3,600.

There have been 11 reported deaths in the United States due to defective Takata air bags, ten of which involved Honda vehicles and one a Ford vehicle. All 11 deaths involved driver-side air bags.

RPT-Ford bets on Mustang to power up China profits - Reuters News

{{20170111T120002.150+0000}}RPT-Ford bets on Mustang to power up China profits(Repeats earlier story with no changes to text)

By Norihiko Shirouzu

BEIJING, Jan 11 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co is betting on one of its most distinctively American models, the Mustang muscle car, to boost the company's sales and profits in China.

Ford began selling the Mustang in China in early 2015, and it is a niche vehicle, selling at a rate of about 3,000 cars a year. Still, that makes the Mustang, which starts at 399,800 yuan ($57,670) the top-seller in a sporty car segment against more expensive vehicles like the Audi TT and the Nissan Skyline GT-R. Mustang last year outsold the Chevrolet Camaro from General Motors Co by nearly 15 to one.

With styling that harks back to 1960s Detroit muscle cars, the Mustang stands out in a Ford lineup dominated by practical sedans and sport utility vehicles. Ford's sales in China grew by 50 percent in 2013 and 20 percent in 2014, but in 2015 the pace slowed to 3 percent. In 2016, Ford added the Lincoln luxury brand to its China lineup and expanded sales by 14 percent.

Industry analysts said Ford's China market profits and profitability were relatively healthy, with operating margins for Ford's joint ventures with Chongqing Changan Automobile Co Ltd (000625.SZ) and Jiangling Motors Corp (JMC) (000550.SZ) in the 14-16 percent range over the past three years.

But competition in the world's largest car market continues to heat up as global automakers, from GM to Volkswagen AG to Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T>, add more models to product ranges. Indigenous Chinese automakers, too, are launching models that can compete more head-on with global carmakers' products.

Ford officials said the company's China operations did not have specific profit objectives but were trying to keep margins in their current "healthy" range.

"In terms of having a pricing power on your brand, you want people to be choosing your brand for rational reasons, but if you could also (combine) that with emotional reasons, that's when you get some pricing power," Peter Fleet, Ford's executive in charge of sales and marketing for the Asia-Pacific region told Reuters.

The Mustang and the F-150 Raptor, a high performance version of Ford's F-150 large pickup truck, provide the emotion, he said.

The formula works for Dong Zirui, a 27-year-old small rental car business owner in the northeastern China city of Tangshan who bought a Mustang late last year.

"The Mustang is a rear-wheel-drive car," said Dong who decided to buy the Mustang when he spotted photos of it online. "It's a savage when you try some drifting stunts with the car." But Dong said he can fit his wife and young son in the car when he needs to.

Dealers say the Mustang brings in two types of buyers to Ford stores: younger drivers, mostly younger than 30 years of age, from upper-middle class families, who have recently finished their studies and have financial support from their parents, as well as drivers in their 30s and 40s who have work or life experience outside China.

"Ford has a cleaner sheet in China, so there might be an opening for those halo cars to help the company improve its brand image," said James Chao, Asia-Pacific chief for consulting and research firm IHS Markit Automotive, referring to China being a relatively young market.

As Chinese consumers typically make car purchasing decisions based on word-of-mouth advice from their family and friends, Mustang buyers can be influential opinion leaders for Ford.

Guo Xin, a 30-year-old rally car racer and stunt driver for films and commercials in Beijing, said he liked the Mustang so much that in 2011 he helped form a Mustang Club of China which now has some 2,000 members.

"Growing up I used to see the Mustang in movies," said Guo who drives a 2006 Mustang and also owns a 1966 Mustang.

Guo's classic Mustang would turn heads even in Detroit. But he cannot take it out on public roads. Used cars brought in from outside China cannot be registered in the country.

European carmakers hope to catch Tesla with faster e-car chargers - Reuters News

By Christoph Steitz

FRANKFURT, Jan 11 (Reuters) - Europe's biggest carmakers are drawing on the full force of the continent's industrial prowess to build a network of ultra-fast charging stations as they look to stoke demand for electric cars and break Tesla's stranglehold on the market.

The long time it takes to charge batteries is one of the main disadvantages of electric cars compared to conventional cars with gasoline tanks that can be filled up in seconds.

Until now, drivers of electric cars have had to leave their vehicles plugged in for hours at a charging station for a journey between cities, making many long range journeys impractical.

Installing new, faster chargers would spur the overall market, and also help the traditional car manufacturers close the gap with Tesla, the Silicon Valley-based e-car leader, which maintains its own network of charging stations. Tesla's chargers are the fastest in the industry, and are incompatible with existing electric cars made by rivals.

The carmakers are roping in experts from the European power and engineering industry, including Germany's Innogy , E.ON and Siemens and Portugal's Efacec, which are all working on the technology, people familiar with the matter told Reuters.

The new 350 kilowatt (kW) chargers would be nearly three times as powerful as Tesla's.

"This is a structured and concerted effort across sectors to tackle the infrastructure issue in a real way," one of the sources said.

A spokesman for Ford, speaking on behalf of the consortium, said talks with possible partners had started, adding he expected several energy providers to be part of the planned network, without elaborating further.

Tesla's tech billionaire CEO Elon Musk has hinted that the company will not be outdone, tweeting that 350 kW chargers are a "children's toy". A Germany-based spokeswoman for the company declined to comment beyond Musk's remarks.

But first, technicians have to solve the problem of conveniently charging them up.

Europe already has a network of nearly 72,000 public charging stations for electric cars, but most are so slow they take hours for a meaningful charge.

The International Energy Agency says only about 5,800 European charging stations are "fast", which it defines as charging at a rate of 43 kW or more, the equivalent of operating 90 washing machines simultaneously.

The fastest chargers in widespread use on the continent so far are the more than 1,800 installed so far by Tesla. At 120 kW, they still need half an hour to give a car enough juice to drive 270 km.

As the market for electric cars grows, traditional car makers are going to find it easier to catch up with Tesla, said Graham Evans, automotive analyst at IHS Markit.

"Tesla doesn't really have anyone to answer to, they are independent," he said. "(But) I think that further out the big (automakers) are in a better position to capitalise because of their more extensive resources."

Installing thousands of fast chargers across the globe will require billions of dollars in investment and offer an opportunity to manufacturers. The car consortium's new fast chargers will cost about 200,000 euros ($210,000) each.

U.S. market leader ChargePoint upped the ante last week by announcing stations of up to 400 kW that will be available from July.

Navigant Research analyst Lisa Jerram said the number of players in the nascent market to build ultra-fast charging stations makes it difficult to call out a winner yet.

"Development is underway on these chargers so there isn't a leader at this point," she said.

So far, makers of charging stations are focused mainly on getting exposure and market share by installing as many as possible. But sooner or later, investors are going to want to see profits, which means that cost will come to matter more.

That holds true even for Tesla, which is starting to adjust its business model as the industry grows up.

Tesla cars ordered up until this week have come with free electricity from its charging stations. But owners who order their cars after Jan. 15 will have to pay to power them up once they reach a limit, although the company says the price will always be cheaper than gasoline. [nFWN1D80TG]

"Burning money as a result of the market and technology not being ready is unlikely to be rewarded by shareholders," said Thomas Deser, senior fund manager at Union Investment.

Ford bets on Mustang to power up China profits - Reuters News

{{20170111T050104.981+0000}}Ford bets on Mustang to power up China profitsBy Norihiko Shirouzu

BEIJING, Jan 11 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co is betting on one of its most distinctively American models, the Mustang muscle car, to boost the company's sales and profits in China.

Ford began selling the Mustang in China in early 2015, and it is a niche vehicle, selling at a rate of about 3,000 cars a year. Still, that makes the Mustang, which starts at 399,800 yuan ($57,670) the top-seller in a sporty car segment against more expensive vehicles like the Audi TT and the Nissan Skyline GT-R. Mustang last year outsold the Chevrolet Camaro from General Motors Co by nearly 15 to one.

With styling that harks back to 1960s Detroit muscle cars, the Mustang stands out in a Ford lineup dominated by practical sedans and sport utility vehicles. Ford's sales in China grew by 50 percent in 2013 and 20 percent in 2014, but in 2015 the pace slowed to 3 percent. In 2016, Ford added the Lincoln luxury brand to its China lineup and expanded sales by 14 percent.

Industry analysts said Ford's China market profits and profitability were relatively healthy, with operating margins for Ford's joint ventures with Chongqing Changan Automobile Co Ltd (000625.SZ) and Jiangling Motors Corp (JMC) (000550.SZ) in the 14-16 percent range over the past three years.

But competition in the world's largest car market continues to heat up as global automakers, from GM to Volkswagen AG to Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T>, add more models to product ranges. Indigenous Chinese automakers, too, are launching models that can compete more head-on with global carmakers' products.

Ford officials said the company's China operations did not have specific profit objectives but were trying to keep margins in their current "healthy" range.

"In terms of having a pricing power on your brand, you want people to be choosing your brand for rational reasons, but if you could also (combine) that with emotional reasons, that's when you get some pricing power," Peter Fleet, Ford's executive in charge of sales and marketing for the Asia-Pacific region told Reuters.

The Mustang and the F-150 Raptor, a high performance version of Ford's F-150 large pickup truck, provide the emotion, he said.

The formula works for Dong Zirui, a 27-year-old small rental car business owner in the northeastern China city of Tangshan who bought a Mustang late last year.

"The Mustang is a rear-wheel-drive car," said Dong who decided to buy the Mustang when he spotted photos of it online. "It's a savage when you try some drifting stunts with the car." But Dong said he can fit his wife and young son in the car when he needs to.

Dealers say the Mustang brings in two types of buyers to Ford stores: younger drivers, mostly younger than 30 years of age, from upper-middle class families, who have recently finished their studies and have financial support from their parents, as well as drivers in their 30s and 40s who have work or life experience outside China.

"Ford has a cleaner sheet in China, so there might be an opening for those halo cars to help the company improve its brand image," said James Chao, Asia-Pacific chief for consulting and research firm IHS Markit Automotive, referring to China being a relatively young market.

As Chinese consumers typically make car purchasing decisions based on word-of-mouth advice from their family and friends, Mustang buyers can be influential opinion leaders for Ford.

Guo Xin, a 30-year-old rally car racer and stunt driver for films and commercials in Beijing, said he liked the Mustang so much that in 2011 he helped form a Mustang Club of China which now has some 2,000 members.

"Growing up I used to see the Mustang in movies," said Guo who drives a 2006 Mustang and also owns a 1966 Mustang.

Guo's classic Mustang would turn heads even in Detroit. But he cannot take it out on public roads. Used cars brought in from outside China cannot be registered in the country.

UPDATE 1-Ford affirms 2017 to be less profitable than 2016 - Reuters News

By Bernie Woodall

DETROIT, Jan 10 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co on Tuesday confirmed that it would be less profitable in 2017 than last year, even as cross town rival General Motors Co on the same day gave a much more upbeat forecast that surpassed Wall Street expectations.

Ford, the second largest U.S. automaker, affirmed that it was on track to deliver about $10.2 billion in adjusted pretax profit in 2016, matching a forecast it gave previously. [nL2N1BQ06W] [nL1N1DI1K5].

Ford shares initially rose 0.5 percent in extended trading but by early Tuesday evening were flat with their closing value of $12.85. GM shares were also trading near their close of $37.35, up 3.7 percent from the previous day.

Ford said profit would improve in 2018 but in 2017 the company would be pressured as it increased spending on "emerging opportunities" including self-driving cars and a rise in other costs.

The company last week said it was on course to deliver a "high-volume, fully autonomous vehicle for ride sharing in 2021" and a fully electric small SUV with a range of at least 300 miles on a full charge.

GM, the largest U.S. automaker, said it expected 2017 earnings per share in a range of $6 to $6.50. Analysts had, on average, predicted the company would post EPS this year of $5.76, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. [nL1N1F018Q]

Ford on Tuesday declared a first-quarter regular dividend of $0.15 per share and a $200 million supplemental cash dividend, or an additional $0.05 per share. The regular dividend matched that of the first quarter of 2016, but the supplemental dividend was below the $0.25 per share payout announced a year ago.

Chief Executive Mark Fields in comments to Wall Street analysts at a meeting webcast from Detroit said the adjusted operating effective tax rate in 2016 was expected to be 32 percent. That was up from an expectation a few months ago for a 2016 tax rate of 28.5 percent, said Ford Chief Financial Officer Bob Shanks.

Shanks said that for 2017, Ford expected the adjusted operating tax rate to be about 30 percent.

BREAKINGVIEWS-Fiat and GM show limits of shareholder optimism - Reuters Breakingviews

{{20170110T211140.421+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-Fiat and GM show limits of shareholder optimism(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.)

By Antony Currie

NEW YORK, Jan 10 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and General Motors are showing the limits of shareholder optimism about their industry. The surge in sales of high-margin, U.S.-made trucks and SUVs is not only boosting their profit and stock prices. It should also help keep the "America-first" concerns of President-elect Donald Trump at bay. Longer-term challenges, though, are keeping most carmakers' valuations deflated.

Mary Barra, chief executive of GM, America's largest carmaker, told investors on Tuesday that earnings in 2016 will be at the high end of previous forecasts and will grow next year. Ford expects its earnings to fall. Meanwhile, shares in FCA, the Italian-American concern run by Sergio Marchionne, have sped ahead by almost 50 percent since the day before the U.S. election - followed by Peugeot at over 20 percent and GM only a little shy of that figure.

The rally has been stoked by hopes that Trump will cut corporate taxes and by rising sales of the chunky vehicles that appeal to U.S. drivers when fuel prices are relatively low. Record U.S. vehicle sales of 17.5 million last year were only a tad higher than in 2015. But SUVs and trucks accounted for almost 60 percent, up from 56 percent 12 months earlier, according to Kelley Blue Book. And that trend is expected to continue.

Most carmakers are playing catch-up to leaders Fiat and GM. True, Ford's F-150 truck remains the U.S. market's best-selling vehicle, but the manufacturer has sidelined other brands in recent years. At the North American International Auto Show in Detroit on Monday, executives revealed they're bringing back the Ranger pickup truck and the Bronco SUV of O.J. Simpson car-chase fame. Nissan <7201.T>, Toyota <7203.T>, Honda <7267.T> and others are ramping up, too.

Even after recent gains, however, Fiat Chrysler trades at just 6.4 times estimated 2017 earnings, according to Thomson Reuters data. That puts it ahead of GM, which boasts better pre-tax margins. But trading below 10 times earnings suggests investors expect these companies to shrink.

The two are, though, symbols of their industry. Only Honda and Toyota trade above the 10 times yardstick, and only barely. Investors see too many risks. Rising consumer-borrowing costs may hit sales this year, for example. And the big automakers have not yet solved the longer-term existential problem presented by the shift to technology-heavy autonomous and driverless cars. In such investment conditions, driving cautiously makes sense.

UPDATE 3-GM gives robust '17 profit outlook, boosting shares - Reuters News

{{20170110T204200.860+0000}}UPDATE 3-GM gives robust '17 profit outlook, boosting shares(Adds background, updates shares)

By Nick Carey

DETROIT, Jan 10 (Reuters) - No. 1 U.S. automaker General Motors Co on Tuesday gave an upbeat profit outlook for 2017 that was significantly above Wall Street forecasts, countering analysts' concerns that the U.S. car industry peaked in 2016 after several years of record or near-record sales, sending its shares up nearly 4 percent.

GM said it expects its earnings for 2016 at the high end of its previous forecast and that profits will rise 2017.

"We see from a (U.S.) macroeconomic point of view pretty robust underpinnings for another good year, absent some external shock to the system," GM president Dan Ammann told reporters at a press conference.

Driving GM's results are solid U.S. economic fundamentals and strong sales of profitable trucks and sport utility vehicles (SUVs).

The Detroit-based automaker said it expects 2017 earnings per share in a range of $6 to $6.50. Analysts have, on average, predicted the company post EPS this year of $5.76, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

GM said it expects full-year 2016 EPS at the high end of its previously announced range of $5.50 to $6. Analysts currently expect 2016 EPS of $6.01, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

In September, rival U.S. automaker Ford Motor Co lowered its 2016 pre-tax profit forecast, blaming a charge related to a vehicle recall. Ford has been trading at 6.29 times earnings, above GM, which has been trading at 4.12 times earnings.

GM shares were up 3.8 percent at $37.38 in afternoon trading, after earlier hitting their highest level in almost two years. Ford shares rose 2 percent after GM's profit outlook announcement.

Over the next three years, GM said that more profitable crossovers, trucks and SUVs that have dominated sales for several years due to lower gas prices, will "increase significantly" to 52 percent of GM sales volumes from 2017 to 2020, versus 38 percent over the previous six years.

The company also announced a $5-billion increase to its share buyback program and additional planned cost savings of $1 billion. The increase in GM's 2017 EPS will in part reflect the impact of the increased share repurchase program.

GM executives said, by 2019 the company expects $2 billion in pre-tax profits from its financial arm, its parts business and its new mobility ventures including OnStar and Maven.

The company said it should generate about $6 billion in free cash flow in 2017.

The automaker's bullish forecast comes at a time when the industry has been emphasizing investments in the United States following attacks by President-elect Donald Trump for building vehicles in Mexico. [nL1N1EZ1CP]

Fiat Chrysler Automobiles announced on Sunday it would spend $1 billion to retool factories in Ohio and Michigan to build new Jeep sport utility vehicles, as well as a pickup truck, and potentially move production of a Ram heavy-duty pickup truck to Michigan from Mexico.

Last week, Ford scrapped plans to build the $1.6-billion Focus plant in Mexico and said it would invest $700 million in a factory in Michigan. [nL1N1ET0OD]

When asked about the company's plans for investments in Mexico, GM CEO Mary Barra said she could not comment, but emphasized a willingness to cooperate with the incoming Trump administration.

"We think there's many things we can do … working with the administration that are going to make America great again that will strengthen business, that will strengthen growth, which will strengthen jobs," Barra said.

"Make America Great Again" was Trump's slogan during the 2016 U.S. general election campaign.

Automakers tout new diesels despite Volkswagen's troubles - Reuters News

{{20170110T200809.797+0000}}Automakers tout new diesels despite Volkswagen's troublesBy David Shepardson

DETROIT, Jan 10 (Reuters) - Automakers unveiled several new diesel models at the Detroit auto show this week, hoping to dispel the doubts created by Volkswagen's diesel emissions scandal and revive interest in a technology that offers benefits under fuel economy regulations.

Ford Motor Co said it would offer a diesel version of its best-selling F-150 pickup truck for the first time in 40 years, while General Motors Co said Sunday it will offer a diesel version of its compact GMC Terrain SUV.

Last year, GM announced it will start selling diesel versions of it Chevrolet Equinox and Chevrolet Cruze car, while in November Mazda Motor Co <7261.T> said it would start selling a diesel version of its 2017 CX-5 SUV in the United States later this year.

Automakers are pushing diesels in part because they offer higher mileage and better performance, particularly for heavier vehicles, than gasoline engines. The fuel economy boost helps automakers comply with federal greenhouse gas limits. The improvements in towing and acceleration are attributes automakers believe they can sell.

"I think we'd be very stupid to forego the benefits of diesel," Daimler AG chief executive Dieter Zetsche told reporters at the auto show.

With their CO2 emissions 15 to 20 percent below equivalent gasoline engines, he said, diesels will "continue to be very relevant" to efforts to meet climate goals.

In April, Daimler said the U.S. Justice Department had asked the carmaker to investigate its emissions certification process for vehicles including its Mercedes brand.

Diesels account for a small fraction of U.S. sales, but more than half of all passenger vehicle sales in Europe. Diesel vehicles represented less than 1 percent of all light-duty vehicle sales in the United States last year, according to hybridcars.com.

Overall diesel sales in the U.S. fell nearly 30 percent in the United States in 2016, as Volkswagen AG stopped selling diesel models in late 2015 after admitting it had rigged diesel engines to pass government emissions tests.

The company on Tuesday confirmed it is negotiating a settlement of a criminal investigation with the U.S. Justice Department and expects to pay $4.3 billion in penalties and plead guilty to criminal misconduct. [nFWN1F00YS]

VW brand chief Herbert Diess reiterated to reporters on Sunday night in Detroit the brand has no plans to resume sales of diesels. VW is focusing on gasoline-powered vehicles and electric vehicle offerings.

Diesels accounted for about a quarter of VW brand sales before the scandal erupted. VW U.S. brand sales were down nearly 8 percent in 2016.

Regulatory problems have saddled diesel technology with "an incredibly bad reputation" and made the vehicles "an incredibly undesirable product, although its usefulness is beyond doubt," Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV chief executive Sergio Marchionne said on the sidelines of the Detroit auto show, without referring to the VW scandal by name.

Marchionne said the automaker is spending 500 million euros to meet new European diesel emissions standards.

"What's going to kill diesel is this continuous drain on capital and this continuous skepticism about its value to society," he said.

Diesel advocates were optimistic about the technology's future after the announcements.

"These announcements send a strong message that diesel remains an important option for meeting the future vehicle needs of U.S. drivers," said Allen Schaeffer, the Executive Director of the Diesel Technology Forum.

Diesels offer strong performance and good fuel economy, GM said, and the automaker is not having trouble getting its engines approved by federal regulators.

"We're really good at it," said Mark Reuss, the automaker's executive vice president for product development. "It's not a bet the farm thing, it's an option."

INSIGHT-U.S. companies have new business risk - being labeled "anti-American" by Trump - Reuters News

{{20170110T195414.618+0000}}INSIGHT-U.S. companies have new business risk - being labeled "anti-American" by TrumpBy Lauren Hirsch and Mike Stone

NEW YORK/WASHINGTON, Jan 10 (Reuters) - Some U.S. companies are reviewing potential mergers while others are rethinking job cuts or looking at their manufacturing operations in China for fear of being cast as "anti-American" by President-elect Donald Trump, according to Wall Street bankers, company executives and crisis management consultants.

Having seen some of America's largest companies, including General Motors Co , Lockheed Martin Corp and United Technologies Corp , bluntly and publicly rebuked by Trump on Twitter, many others are worried they may be his next target - especially if they have significant overseas manufacturing, have had U.S. job cuts or price increases for consumers.

"Any business that leaves our country for another country, fires its employees, builds a new factory or plant in the other country, and then thinks it will sell its product back into the U.S. without retribution or consequence is WRONG!" Trump, who assumes office on Jan. 20, tweeted in December.

Trump campaigned on an "America First" anti-globalization platform that promised the return of thousands of U.S. manufacturing jobs to economically depressed areas.

That nationalist rhetoric and Trump's willingness to use his Twitter account as a cudgel has so rattled some companies that they are putting on hold mergers and acquisitions that may involve significant job cuts or moving production or tax domicile abroad, out of fear that such deals could be seen as "unpatriotic", several top Wall Street bankers said.

Bermuda-based White Mountains Insurance Group Ltd had been in talks to sell itself in a transaction that would have been structured as an inversion - where a U.S.-based buyer would move its tax domicile overseas.

However, the deal fell apart after the November election partly because potential buyers worried that leaving the U.S. tax home would be seen as "anti-American," three people with knowledge of the matter said. Potential buyers also found the target less attractive because of the likelihood of lower U.S. corporate taxes under the Trump administration, the people said.

Representatives of the $3.8 billion company declined to comment.

At least two other insurance deals have also fallen apart since the election for similar reasons, said the people, who declined to elaborate and asked not to be named because the matter is not public.

Trump's aggressive anti-China rhetoric has also given some companies pause.

James Park, chief executive of wearable fitness device maker Fitbit Inc , said he expects all companies that have significant manufacturing operations in China, including his own firm, to prepare contingency plans.

Trump has threatened to hit China and Mexico with high tariffs and named vocal China critic Peter Navarro to lead a new White House office overseeing U.S. trade policy.

"Whether it's taking higher costs into account or operationally preparing for moving manufacturing (out of China), companies are thinking about what to do," Park said in an interview.

WATCHING TRUMP'S TWEETS

Companies are also beefing up their Twitter monitoring for any Trump tweets that could affect them and engaging public relations firms for advice on potential lines of attack and how to respond if they were to come, several U.S. chief executives as well as half a dozen corporate advisers told Reuters.

"Back in December the board was already asking questions: 'What's the plan in terms of what happens if he comes after us, are we ready? The board is asking us if we have a PR firm at the ready, if we have a person monitoring his Twitter," said a top executive at a large U.S. defense contractor.

"Our plan is to not get into a fight, and concede immediately. The reality is that we're trying to stay below the radar," the executive said, asking not to be named because of the sensitivity of the issue.

Since his election in November, Trump has ramped up criticism of companies from Ford Motor Co , Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T> and GM, to United Tech and Rexnord Corp over manufacturing in Mexico for U.S. consumers or moving U.S. jobs abroad.

Trump also slammed Lockheed Martin and Boeing Co for what he called "out of control" costs on their weapons programs.

Both Lockheed and Boeing have said they will work to drive down costs of the programs, while Ford scrapped plans to build a $1.6 billion plant in Mexico, and United Tech's Carrier unit is keeping half of the 2,100 U.S. jobs it was to shift to Mexico.

Government relations and public relations advisers say they have received a number of calls from companies wanting help in assessing if they have any red flags that could draw Trump's ire.

Advisers say these potentially include outsourcing of manufacturing, consumer price increases and lower tax rates than peer companies.

"We have literally had about a dozen clients ask us how they should be thinking about this in the last few weeks," said George Sard, chairman and CEO of strategic communications firm Sard Verbinnen & Co, adding that he is seeing concern from companies in a wide range of industries.

"The week after the election it was non-stop meetings and conference calls and analysis," said Kent Jarrell, crisis and litigation communication expert at APCO Worldwide. "It's almost like a whole new Trump practice is developing."

Corporate leaders, say the advisers, can no longer focus only on maximizing shareholder value; they must now also weigh national interest.

"CEOs are talking to their boards saying we've got to be viewed pro-America. If something is more on the margin – like layoffs, or moving manufacturing, then they are not going to do it," said one Fortune 500 CEO, who said he had spoken with other U.S. companies.

TAKING A PAGE FROM TRUMP PLAYBOOK

Sard, of Sard Verbinnen & Co, said that while companies are well advised not to get into a Twitter war with Trump, his firm is advising clients to "learn from his playbook" and be prepared to communicate directly with shareholders, employees, and customers through blogs and social media.

There is already evidence that companies are quickly adjusting to the new Trump era. Firms have been more vocal in publicizing job creation and they have sometimes let Trump claim credit.

Fiat Chrysler Automobiles , the No. 3 automaker in the United States, announced plans on Sunday to create 2,000 U.S. jobs. The timing was partly influenced by CEO Sergio Marchionne's desire to get the news out ahead of any possible criticism from Trump for the automaker's overseas manufacturing, a person familiar with the company's thinking said.

Trump has in the past few weeks attacked FCA's two Detroit rivals, as well as Japan-based Toyota, for their manufacturing operations in Mexico and threatened to impose stiff border taxes on any imports.

In December, SoftBank Group Corp <9984.T>, majority owner of Sprint Corp , unveiled a $50 billion U.S. investment at the Trump Tower in Manhattan. Trump and SoftBank head Masayoshi Son made the announcement together, and Trump later tweeted: "He would never do this had we (Trump) not won the election!"

"You never want to be against the president - especially not one as vocal as (Trump)," the Fortune 500 CEO said.

UPDATE 1-Automakers overhaul product plans to bet more on SUVs - Reuters News

{{20170110T171022.379+0000}}UPDATE 1-Automakers overhaul product plans to bet more on SUVs(Adds link to graphic)

By Alexandria Sage

DETROIT, Jan 10 (Reuters) - Global automakers are reworking their product strategies and investments for the United States to bring more sport utility vehicles to showrooms amid a sharp turn away from small- and medium-sized cars, executives at Detroit's auto show say.

Carmakers from Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T> to General Motors Co to Volkswagen AG are adding more SUVs to their product plans, amid forecasts that SUVs and pickup trucks could soon make up two-thirds of U.S. light vehicle sales, up from 56 percent in 2015 and just under 60 percent last year.

"The shift to trucks is profound," said Mike Jackson, chief executive of AutoNation Inc , the largest U.S. auto dealership chain.

Sedans are not only losing sales volume, but automakers and dealers are offering bigger discounts to move them out of showrooms, industry executives said. Profit margins on SUVs and trucks are fatter.

The average incentive for a midsize car in September was 14.1 percent, according to Kelley Blue Book, compared with 7.4 percent for a midsize crossover.

The shift has forced some automakers to slash production capacity dedicated just a few years ago to small cars, and put a new emphasis on designing vehicles and assembly plants that can switch quickly from building cars to SUVs.

Volkswagen's Audi unit, for example, builds a small Q2 SUV and its A3 sedan on the same assembly line, Dietmar Voggenreiter, head of sales and marketing for Audi, said in an interview. "We will always have an SUV and a sedan" on the same production line, he said.

Automakers are bringing SUVs into segments that previously were only for cars.

Case in point is Nissan Motor Co's <7201.T> Rogue Sport, revealed on Monday at the North American International Auto Show, an Americanized version of the small Qashqai SUV Nissan has sold for several years in Europe and Asia.

"The increasing shift of cars to crossovers finally drove our decision to bring this car to the U.S.," said Michael Bunce, vice president of product strategy for Nissan's U.S. arm.

The Rogue Sport will be sold alongside the slightly larger Rogue, appealing to consumers who previously would have had only small cars to choose from.

The cars to SUV shift is hitting luxury brands, as well.

At German luxury automaker BMW last year, about 43 percent of U.S. sales were SUVs. In December, that percentage neared 50, said Ian Robertson, the German luxury brand's global sales chief.

"I think that tells you where the trend is in the U.S., probably on a 50-50 level," Robertson told Reuters.

At Toyota Motor Co <7203.T>, SUVs and trucks will account for about 63 percent of U.S. sales in 2017, said North America CEO Jim Lentz, predicting its RAV4 SUV could top the Camry this year as its best-selling U.S. vehicle.

Honda Motor Co <7267.T> is working to expand production of SUVs for the U.S. market, shifting production of the Acura MDX sport utility to a factory in Ohio to make room for additional production of higher volume Pilot SUVs and Ridgeline pickup trucks, Chief Executive Takahiro Hachigo said.

Cheap gasoline is emboldening some automakers to add more SUVs based on body-on-frame pickup truck designs - after years of shifting SUVs to lighter, car-like unitized body construction.

Ford Motor Co is reviving its Bronco SUV. It was last built in 1996 after gaining notoriety as the vehicle used during O.J. Simpson's police pursuit. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV on Sunday outlined plans to bring back a body on frame SUV for its Jeep line.

SEDAN SLOWDOWN

The focus on SUVs leaves carmakers who have an overcapacity of sedans in a weak position. Ford's announcement last week to scrap a planned Mexico factory was attributed to falling U.S. demand for sedans. [nL1N1ET0V9]

"The sedan market is under real pressure. If you don't have SUVs in all categories you are in serious difficulty," warned Lex Kerssemakers, CEO of Volvo Cars USA, whose flagship U.S. model is the XC90 SUV.

Lexus global chief Tokuo Fukuichi said the idea of building a luxury car brand around a large sedan such as the Lexus LS unveiled in Detroit is now "under assault."

Mark Reuss, head of global product development, said the automaker is looking for ways to offer attributes of SUVs in more designs that are more innovative than the square-backed vehicles that dominate the category now.

"You'll see them in the next year," he said, vehicles that offer "an alternative to a box."

Cheap gasoline is emboldening some automakers to add more SUVs based on body-on-frame pickup truck designs - after years of shifting SUVs to lighter, car-like unitized body construction.

Ford Motor Co is reviving its Bronco SUV. It was last built in 1996 after gaining notoriety as the vehicle used during O.J. Simpson's police pursuit. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV on Sunday outlined plans to bring back a body on frame SUV for its Jeep line.

SEDAN SLOWDOWN

"The sedan market is under real pressure. If you don't have SUVs in all categories you are in serious difficulty," warned Lex Kerssemakers, CEO of Volvo Cars USA, whose flagship U.S. model is the XC90 SUV.

Lexus global chief Tokuo Fukuichi said the idea of building a luxury car brand around a large sedan such as the Lexus LS unveiled in Detroit is now "under assault."

Mark Reuss, head of global product development, said the automaker is looking for ways to offer attributes of SUVs in more designs that are more innovative than the square-backed vehicles that dominate the category now.

"You'll see them in the next year," he said, vehicles that offer "an alternative to a box."

RPT-ANALYSIS-Two faces of GM: Electric for the city, trucks for the heartland - Reuters News

{{20170110T120002.133+0000}}RPT-ANALYSIS-Two faces of GM: Electric for the city, trucks for the heartland(Repeating for additional clients with no changes to text)

By Paul Lienert and Joseph White

DETROIT, Jan 9 (Reuters) - General Motors Co Chief Executive Mary Barra says often that the auto industry will change more during the next decade than it has in the past half-century, as she highlights how GM will keep up.

In 2016, it has invested nearly $1 billion to buy a self-driving car technology startup, Cruise Automation; invested $500 million into ride services company Lyft; launched a new car-sharing brand, Maven, and a new electric car, the Chevrolet Bolt.

The automaker is also expanding the array of services available via the high-speed mobile internet connections embedded in millions of GM vehicles.

None of those high-profile moves, however, are likely to have much near-term impact on the No. 1 U.S. automaker's bottom line.

For now and for years to come, GM will make money the way it did 60 years ago: By selling large vehicles built on steel frames, with V8 engines driving the rear wheels. In 1957, that technology was sold as a Chevy Bel Air. Today, it is packaged as a Chevrolet Silverado pickup truck or a Cadillac Escalade SUV.

The company makes more than 90 percent of its profits, before interest and taxes, in its North American auto operations. The bulk of those profits come from sales of trucks and SUVs, analysts and company executives said.

"That business model has worked and continues to work," GM President Dan Ammann told Reuters. "We believe that model will keep going, particularly in places where we are strongest, for a long time."

GM is pursuing a two-pronged strategy, aimed at the increasingly divergent segments of its home market.

In big cities along the coasts, GM is widening its efforts to capture urban consumers who are shifting away from traditional vehicle ownership and some day may get around by summoning self-driving cars with a smartphone.

"We're at the very infancy of that," Ammann said.

Ride sharing today accounts for less than 1 percent of all miles traveled in the United States. But if buying rides by the mile takes off, it could be a "significant" opportunity, he said.

Earlier this week, GM's Cadillac luxury division launched in New York what it said was the industry's first service allowing customers to pay a monthly fee to drive any of the brand's models.

GM has a different plan for the heartland – the red states that backed Donald Trump for president, where trucks and SUVs sell by the hundreds of thousands and electric cars sell by the hundreds - or less.

GM is investing billions in U.S. factories to expand production of large trucks and SUVs.

Defending the V8 truck franchise is critical to GM. More than 90 percent of GM's pickup trucks are sold with V8 engines, said Dan Nicholson, head of the company's propulsion systems engineering operations.

As of now, he said, GM does not have a V8 that can comply with the 2025 emissions standards - put in place by the outgoing Obama administration - without turning off customers who like the trucks as the are.

The Alliance for Automobile Manufacturers, which includes GM, is lobbying the incoming Trump administration to revise those standards.

GM is meanwhile working on improving the fuel efficiency of its V8 engines, Nicholson said, but current fuel economy rules could force the company to limit availability and raise the price of trucks equipped with the larger engines.

Rival Ford Motor Co, with its F-150 pickup, has already made the transition to V6 turbo engines - which now sell in larger volumes than its V8 trucks - along with aluminum body panels that reduce weight and boost fuel economy.

DUAL AUDIENCES, MESSAGES

GM's dual marketing strategies - one for the heartland, the other for the coasts - will be on display at the Detroit Auto Show this week.

The automaker will feature new SUV models including a large Chevrolet Traverse and a revamped GMC Terrain compact SUV. On Chevrolet's show stand, the electric Bolt hatchback will be presented as one of the brand's family of SUVs, along with the hulking Chevrolet Suburban.

At a scheduled Jan. 10 presentation, GM also will have a dual message for investors: Trucks make the money, and the investments in alternatives to that business are still modest and pose no threat to GM's promises of profitability.

The automaker has assured investors it will boost pre-tax profit margins to 9 to 10 percent by early in the next decade, and buy back $9 billion worth shares for the period 2015-2017.

The company's current results need no explanation, Amman told Reuters. "It's a very strong performance," he said.

For urban customers, and an increasing number of younger customers who are less interested in car ownership, GM is preparing alternatives at a measured pace.

The electric Bolt illustrates GM's approach. Tesla Motors Inc Chief Executive Elon Musk has said he intends to build 500,000 of his planned Model 3 electric sedans annually by 2020. That would be about six times the number of battery electric cars sold in the U.S. last year, based on data from the Electric Drive Transportation Association, a trade group.

Suppliers have said that GM, by contrast, plans to build about 20,000 to 30,000 of its Chevrolet Bolt electric vehicles annually. Many are expected to serve in Lyft ride hailing fleets.

GM officials have not said how many Bolts the company will build. But Mike Abelson, GM's vice president for strategy and global portfolio planning, told Reuters that it will err on the side of building too few than too many to suit consumer demand.

"We'd rather have the problem of working fast to increase volume" than building too many cars that languish on dealer lots, he said.

UNCERTAIN FUTURE

The Bolt is now a centerpiece of GM's efforts to appeal to urban audiences – which includes investors on Wall Street and regulators in California. The bulk of U.S. electric car sales are in California because the state requires automakers to deliver an escalating number of "zero-emission vehicles" each year.

Coastal dwellers buy a relatively small share of the gasoline-powered vehicles GM sells in the U.S. The automaker's market share in California is just 9.9 percent, compared to about 17 percent in the nation as a whole, according to IHS Markit data.

"We're 10 percent in San Francisco. In New York, we're below 7 percent," said Julia Steyn, head of GM's new Maven ride services unit.

Maven is offering short-term loans of GM vehicles in a growing number of cities where GM's market share is below the nationwide average.

"We're getting new customers," Steyn said.

Compare GM's California market share to the 27.4 share, according to IHS Markit, that GM enjoys in Indiana, where people buy four-door Silverado pickups as family transportation.

Maven has about 8,000 vehicles in its fleet. GM sells more than eight times that many vehicles in a month.

Asked when Maven will be a significant contributor to GM's revenues - currently more than $150 billion a year - Steyn laughed.

"Let me live until 2021," she said. "I'll tell you then."

France's Le Pen says would seek Trump-style repatriation of car plants - Reuters News

{{20170110T085424.603+0000}}France's Le Pen says would seek Trump-style repatriation of car plantsPARIS, Jan 10 (Reuters) - Far-right French presidential candidate Marine Le Pen said on Tuesday she would seek to repatriate production of French motor vehicles and other industrial goods - just as President-elect Donald Trump hopes to do in the United States.

Trump has threatened to slap tariffs on cars made abroad, saying the practice costs American jobs. He has praised Ford Motor Co's decision last week to scrap a plan to build a plant in Mexico, and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles' confirmation of plans to create 2,000 jobs at its U.S. factories.

Asked whether she would like to see the same thing happen with French manufacturers Renault and PSA Peugeot Citroen , the National Front (FN) leader said: "He (Trump) is putting in place measures I have been demanding for years."

Speaking on France 2 Television, she described the policy as "economic patriotism, (and) intelligent protectionism."

"I don't mind explaining to French companies that they can not escape tax that they should be paying in France, that they cannot go offshore without suffering the consequences ... A choice has to be made, a choice of patriotism.

Both Renault and Peugeot have significant cars and parts-making activities in Spain and eastern Europe.

Other candidates in France's spring presidential election have praised Trump's attitude on Ford, including Socialist Arnaud Montebourg and left-wing independent Jean-Luc Melenchon.

Le Pen's protectionist and anti-globalisation agenda has helped win her widespread support in her campaign. Most opinion polls show her contesting, but losing, the second and final round of the presidential election in May with Francois Fillon who represents conservative party The Republicans.

Industrial policy is one of the key differences between the two. Fillon has a liberal programme aimed at rolling back state involvement in corporate life.

On Dec. 1 he advocated selling government holdings in major companies, saying the government's near-20 percent stake in Renault was pointless and could not prevent it from building factories abroad. [nL8N1DW478

Q&A-What does Trump's 'big border tax' threat really mean? - Reuters News

{{20170109T223559.721+0000}}Q&A-What does Trump's 'big border tax' threat really mean?WASHINGTON, Jan 9 (Reuters) - In a series of tweets, President-elect Donald Trump has recently threatened several companies with "big border tax" if they expand manufacturing facilities abroad for products to be sold into the United States, but he has provided few details.

Whether he is talking about a tax or a tariff is unclear, experts said, reacting to Trump's terse warnings to United Technologies Corp , General Motors Co , Ford Motor Co and Japan's Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T>.

Trump has said U.S. companies that shut manufacturing plants and lay off workers only to open new facilities abroad would pay a 35 percent tax or tariff on products they ship back to the U.S. market.

Asked about the issue on a conference call with reporters on Monday, Trump transition team spokesman Sean Spicer said the president-elect had been focused on U.S.-based employers that "move overseas for the express purpose of selling back to the U.S. market with non-U.S. workers. ... That continues to stand."

Further details were not immediately available.

Q: Could Trump impose his own import tax on U.S. companies?

A. No. Congress writes the tax laws and the revenue-raising power of the federal government is held primarily by the House of Representatives under the Constitution. Tax laws are enforced by the Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service.

Q: Could Trump impose a tariff on his own?

A. Perhaps, but he would likely face a legal challenge. Like taxes, tariffs are also revenue-raising measures.

New York University School of Law tax professor Daniel Shaviro said the president's power to impose tariffs on his own was "highly contested. ... Targeting one particular company would certainly add to the legal, as well as the policy concerns."

Shaviro said selective tariffs on individual companies, including foreign-based ones, would likely draw a challenge through the World Trade Organization and trigger retaliation.

Brooklyn Law School professor Rebecca Kysar wrote in an op-ed last week in the New York Times that Trump was floating the idea of a 5 to 10 percent imports tariff imposed by executive action. She said that would be unconstitutional, citing the origination clause that vests revenue-raising power in Congress.

Q: Is Trump signaling support for a border tax in Congress?

A. Some experts said Trump's tweets might mean he supports an unprecedented export-boosting approach to corporate taxation that is being proposed by Republicans in the House of Representatives, including House Speaker Paul Ryan.

Known as border adjustability, the approach is intended to help U.S. manufacturers by favoring exports over imports. As laid out in Ryan's "Better Way" agenda, companies would pay no tax on revenues from exports and would be unable to deduct the cost of imports from their taxable income.

Advocates said if that approach became law, it would attract investment to the United States, provide incentives to manufacturers to maintain or expand their U.S. facilities, and dissuade companies from leaving the country. But some tax experts are skeptical it will be approved by Congress.

Q: Are Trump's tweets in line with the border adjustability plan?

A. Not exactly. His comments have stirred anxiety in business circles about the possibility of a special penalty tax on U.S. companies that send jobs overseas. By contrast, the House Republican proposal would treat all imported products equally, whether produced by U.S. or foreign-owned companies.

Q: Where does Trump get the 35 percent figure he cites for the tax or tariff he has warned U.S. companies that shut manufacturing plants only to open new facilities abroad will pay on products they ship back to the U.S. market.

?

A. That is not clear either. Experts said the president-elect may be referring in his tweets to the current 35 percent U.S. corporate income tax rate. That would also differ from the House Republican plan, which would impose a 20 percent tax on imports.

While some experts said Trump could follow the House Republican approach and subject all imports to a lower tax rate, others said Trump had indicated an interest in using different tax rates to penalize or reward certain business behaviors.

For example, a tax reform plan released by Trump in September called for cutting the corporate tax rate to 15 percent but added a potentially important caveat: "This rate is available to all businesses, both small and large, that want to retain the profits within the business."

Q: When might we know more about Trump's plans?

A. Trump himself could offer more details at any time, including at a news conference scheduled for Wednesday. Some expect House Republicans to unveil initial tax reform legislation by the end of February. That timetable could slip as Republicans and their staff discuss sweeping reforms with the Trump transition team, analysts said.

FACTBOX-Automakers reveal new models at the Detroit auto show - Reuters News

{{20170109T223406.500+0000}}FACTBOX-Automakers reveal new models at the Detroit auto show(Adds more models, details)

Jan 9 (Reuters) - Global automakers kicked off 2017 displaying a wide array of future vehicles at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit. Luxury sedans and small sport utility vehicles jostled for the spotlight along with electric cars and diesel-powered pickup trucks. When it came to industry profits, the trucks and SUVs were at center-stage.

Here are some of the notable vehicle debuts at the Detroit show, which opens to the public on Saturday, January 14.

* Nissan Rogue Sport. A 5-passenger SUV that will be slightly smaller than the Nissan <7201.T> Rogue, which has become the top-selling model in the company's U.S. lineup. Rogue was the top-selling non-pickup truck in the U.S. in December. It will go on sale in the spring. This is part of Nissan's response to U.S. consumers' growing preference for SUVs of all sizes.

* Kia Motors Co <000270.KS> Stinger. The Stinger is a new 5-passenger fastback sport sedan. Kia said it would produce the Stinger after showing a concept version of it earlier. The car was designed in Frankfurt. It will go on sale in the U.S. market in late 2017.

* Lexus LS. Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T> debuted the first Lexus LS 400 sedan in Detroit at the 1989 auto show. On Monday, the brand unveiled the fifth generation of its big sedan to a market that is turning away from the traditional concept that a luxury brand's "flagship" model must be a sedan, instead of a sport utility vehicle. The brand also is showing a compact crossover concept called UX.

* BMW 5-series. BMW AG has already taken the wraps off the look of the new 5-series, which competes with the Mercedes E-class and Audi A6. The German luxury automaker displayed a plug-in hybrid version of the car for the first time in Detroit. Like its competitors, the 5-series is losing ground to SUVs - and the Tesla Model S electric sedan - among affluent U.S. buyers. BMW also is showing a compact X2 crossover concept.

* Honda Odyssey. Just in time for millennials starting to have the baby boom generation's grandchildren, Honda Motor Co <7267.T> debuted a new generation of its Odyssey minivan. The minivan segment has shrunk since the former Chrysler Corp pioneered the concept of a boxy family hauler in the 1980s, but sales in the segment rose 8 percent last year.

* Ford F-150. Ford Motor Co will give the 2018 model of the best-selling vehicle in the United States some modest appearance changes, and more significantly, new technology to reduce fuel consumption. For the first time, Ford will offer a diesel engine option in the F-150. The company is not releasing fuel economy estimates for that engine. A new 3.3-liter six-cylinder engine will also be offered and fuel-saving technology that shuts down the engine at a stop light will be available.

* Chevrolet Traverse. General Motors Co highlighted two redesigned sport utility vehicles in Detroit, including a new generation of the Chevrolet Traverse, a family hauling SUV that will compete with the likes of the Ford Explorer, Honda Pilot, Toyota Highlander and Jeep Grand Cherokee.

* Toyota Camry. The best-selling passenger car in the United States for the past 15 years got a major makeover. Camry sales fell 9.5 percent in 2016 from the year before, reflecting pressure from the shift to SUVs. Overall, mid-sized sedan sales in the United States fell 10 percent. Toyota <7203.T> has been giving its mainstream models more expressive styling and advanced technology, to counter a long-held image for dull reliability. The 2018 Camry is expected to reflect that direction.

* Mercedes-Benz E Class Coupe. Daimler AG's mainstream brand has redesigned its mid-size E Class Coupe. It also showed a facelifted version of the GLA compact crossover, as well as a redesigned Smart Electric Drive.

* Audi Q8. Audi, the high-volume luxury brand of Volkswagen AG showed a concept of a new, large sport utility vehicle in Detroit. It is also unveiling a facelifted version of its SQ5 mid-size SUV and redesigned A5 cabriolet.

* Volkswagen Tiguan. The mid-size Tiguan crossover utility vehicle has been redesigned. VW is also displaying yet another revival of its classic Microbus, this time as a battery-powered electric concept called I.D. Buzz.

* Infiniti QX50. Nissan's luxury brand is showing a concept version of its redesigned QX50 mid-size SUV.

* GMC Terrain. The brand's compact SUV gets its first major redesign, sharing major components with the redesigned Chevrolet Equinox.

UPDATE 3-GM gives robust '17 profit outlook, boosting shares - Reuters News

{{20170110T204200.860+0000}}UPDATE 3-GM gives robust '17 profit outlook, boosting shares(Adds background, updates shares)

By Nick Carey

DETROIT, Jan 10 (Reuters) - No. 1 U.S. automaker General Motors Co on Tuesday gave an upbeat profit outlook for 2017 that was significantly above Wall Street forecasts, countering analysts' concerns that the U.S. car industry peaked in 2016 after several years of record or near-record sales, sending its shares up nearly 4 percent.

GM said it expects its earnings for 2016 at the high end of its previous forecast and that profits will rise 2017.

"We see from a (U.S.) macroeconomic point of view pretty robust underpinnings for another good year, absent some external shock to the system," GM president Dan Ammann told reporters at a press conference.

Driving GM's results are solid U.S. economic fundamentals and strong sales of profitable trucks and sport utility vehicles (SUVs).

The Detroit-based automaker said it expects 2017 earnings per share in a range of $6 to $6.50. Analysts have, on average, predicted the company post EPS this year of $5.76, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

GM said it expects full-year 2016 EPS at the high end of its previously announced range of $5.50 to $6. Analysts currently expect 2016 EPS of $6.01, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

In September, rival U.S. automaker Ford Motor Co lowered its 2016 pre-tax profit forecast, blaming a charge related to a vehicle recall. Ford has been trading at 6.29 times earnings, above GM, which has been trading at 4.12 times earnings.

GM shares were up 3.8 percent at $37.38 in afternoon trading, after earlier hitting their highest level in almost two years. Ford shares rose 2 percent after GM's profit outlook announcement.

Over the next three years, GM said that more profitable crossovers, trucks and SUVs that have dominated sales for several years due to lower gas prices, will "increase significantly" to 52 percent of GM sales volumes from 2017 to 2020, versus 38 percent over the previous six years.

The company also announced a $5-billion increase to its share buyback program and additional planned cost savings of $1 billion. The increase in GM's 2017 EPS will in part reflect the impact of the increased share repurchase program.

GM executives said, by 2019 the company expects $2 billion in pre-tax profits from its financial arm, its parts business and its new mobility ventures including OnStar and Maven.

The company said it should generate about $6 billion in free cash flow in 2017.

The automaker's bullish forecast comes at a time when the industry has been emphasizing investments in the United States following attacks by President-elect Donald Trump for building vehicles in Mexico. [nL1N1EZ1CP]

Fiat Chrysler Automobiles announced on Sunday it would spend $1 billion to retool factories in Ohio and Michigan to build new Jeep sport utility vehicles, as well as a pickup truck, and potentially move production of a Ram heavy-duty pickup truck to Michigan from Mexico.

Last week, Ford scrapped plans to build the $1.6-billion Focus plant in Mexico and said it would invest $700 million in a factory in Michigan. [nL1N1ET0OD]

When asked about the company's plans for investments in Mexico, GM CEO Mary Barra said she could not comment, but emphasized a willingness to cooperate with the incoming Trump administration.

"We think there's many things we can do … working with the administration that are going to make America great again that will strengthen business, that will strengthen growth, which will strengthen jobs," Barra said.

"Make America Great Again" was Trump's slogan during the 2016 U.S. general election campaign.

DETROIT, Jan 10 (Reuters) - Automakers unveiled several new diesel models at the Detroit auto show this week, hoping to dispel the doubts created by Volkswagen's diesel emissions scandal and revive interest in a technology that offers benefits under fuel economy regulations.

Ford Motor Co said it would offer a diesel version of its best-selling F-150 pickup truck for the first time in 40 years, while General Motors Co said Sunday it will offer a diesel version of its compact GMC Terrain SUV.

Last year, GM announced it will start selling diesel versions of it Chevrolet Equinox and Chevrolet Cruze car, while in November Mazda Motor Co <7261.T> said it would start selling a diesel version of its 2017 CX-5 SUV in the United States later this year.

Automakers are pushing diesels in part because they offer higher mileage and better performance, particularly for heavier vehicles, than gasoline engines. The fuel economy boost helps automakers comply with federal greenhouse gas limits. The improvements in towing and acceleration are attributes automakers believe they can sell.

"I think we'd be very stupid to forego the benefits of diesel," Daimler AG chief executive Dieter Zetsche told reporters at the auto show.

With their CO2 emissions 15 to 20 percent below equivalent gasoline engines, he said, diesels will "continue to be very relevant" to efforts to meet climate goals.

In April, Daimler said the U.S. Justice Department had asked the carmaker to investigate its emissions certification process for vehicles including its Mercedes brand.

Diesels account for a small fraction of U.S. sales, but more than half of all passenger vehicle sales in Europe. Diesel vehicles represented less than 1 percent of all light-duty vehicle sales in the United States last year, according to hybridcars.com.

Overall diesel sales in the U.S. fell nearly 30 percent in the United States in 2016, as Volkswagen AG stopped selling diesel models in late 2015 after admitting it had rigged diesel engines to pass government emissions tests.

The company on Tuesday confirmed it is negotiating a settlement of a criminal investigation with the U.S. Justice Department and expects to pay $4.3 billion in penalties and plead guilty to criminal misconduct. [nFWN1F00YS]

VW brand chief Herbert Diess reiterated to reporters on Sunday night in Detroit the brand has no plans to resume sales of diesels. VW is focusing on gasoline-powered vehicles and electric vehicle offerings.

Diesels accounted for about a quarter of VW brand sales before the scandal erupted. VW U.S. brand sales were down nearly 8 percent in 2016.

Regulatory problems have saddled diesel technology with "an incredibly bad reputation" and made the vehicles "an incredibly undesirable product, although its usefulness is beyond doubt," Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV chief executive Sergio Marchionne said on the sidelines of the Detroit auto show, without referring to the VW scandal by name.

Marchionne said the automaker is spending 500 million euros to meet new European diesel emissions standards.

"What's going to kill diesel is this continuous drain on capital and this continuous skepticism about its value to society," he said.

Diesel advocates were optimistic about the technology's future after the announcements.

"These announcements send a strong message that diesel remains an important option for meeting the future vehicle needs of U.S. drivers," said Allen Schaeffer, the Executive Director of the Diesel Technology Forum.

Diesels offer strong performance and good fuel economy, GM said, and the automaker is not having trouble getting its engines approved by federal regulators.

"We're really good at it," said Mark Reuss, the automaker's executive vice president for product development. "It's not a bet the farm thing, it's an option."

INSIGHT-U.S. companies have new business risk - being labeled "anti-American" by Trump - Reuters News

{{20170110T195414.618+0000}}INSIGHT-U.S. companies have new business risk - being labeled "anti-American" by TrumpBy Lauren Hirsch and Mike Stone

NEW YORK/WASHINGTON, Jan 10 (Reuters) - Some U.S. companies are reviewing potential mergers while others are rethinking job cuts or looking at their manufacturing operations in China for fear of being cast as "anti-American" by President-elect Donald Trump, according to Wall Street bankers, company executives and crisis management consultants.

Having seen some of America's largest companies, including General Motors Co , Lockheed Martin Corp and United Technologies Corp , bluntly and publicly rebuked by Trump on Twitter, many others are worried they may be his next target - especially if they have significant overseas manufacturing, have had U.S. job cuts or price increases for consumers.

"Any business that leaves our country for another country, fires its employees, builds a new factory or plant in the other country, and then thinks it will sell its product back into the U.S. without retribution or consequence is WRONG!" Trump, who assumes office on Jan. 20, tweeted in December.

Trump campaigned on an "America First" anti-globalization platform that promised the return of thousands of U.S. manufacturing jobs to economically depressed areas.

That nationalist rhetoric and Trump's willingness to use his Twitter account as a cudgel has so rattled some companies that they are putting on hold mergers and acquisitions that may involve significant job cuts or moving production or tax domicile abroad, out of fear that such deals could be seen as "unpatriotic", several top Wall Street bankers said.

Bermuda-based White Mountains Insurance Group Ltd had been in talks to sell itself in a transaction that would have been structured as an inversion - where a U.S.-based buyer would move its tax domicile overseas.

However, the deal fell apart after the November election partly because potential buyers worried that leaving the U.S. tax home would be seen as "anti-American," three people with knowledge of the matter said. Potential buyers also found the target less attractive because of the likelihood of lower U.S. corporate taxes under the Trump administration, the people said.

Representatives of the $3.8 billion company declined to comment.

At least two other insurance deals have also fallen apart since the election for similar reasons, said the people, who declined to elaborate and asked not to be named because the matter is not public.

Trump's aggressive anti-China rhetoric has also given some companies pause.

James Park, chief executive of wearable fitness device maker Fitbit Inc , said he expects all companies that have significant manufacturing operations in China, including his own firm, to prepare contingency plans.

Trump has threatened to hit China and Mexico with high tariffs and named vocal China critic Peter Navarro to lead a new White House office overseeing U.S. trade policy.

"Whether it's taking higher costs into account or operationally preparing for moving manufacturing (out of China), companies are thinking about what to do," Park said in an interview.

WATCHING TRUMP'S TWEETS

Companies are also beefing up their Twitter monitoring for any Trump tweets that could affect them and engaging public relations firms for advice on potential lines of attack and how to respond if they were to come, several U.S. chief executives as well as half a dozen corporate advisers told Reuters.

"Back in December the board was already asking questions: 'What's the plan in terms of what happens if he comes after us, are we ready? The board is asking us if we have a PR firm at the ready, if we have a person monitoring his Twitter," said a top executive at a large U.S. defense contractor.

"Our plan is to not get into a fight, and concede immediately. The reality is that we're trying to stay below the radar," the executive said, asking not to be named because of the sensitivity of the issue.

Since his election in November, Trump has ramped up criticism of companies from Ford Motor Co , Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T> and GM, to United Tech and Rexnord Corp over manufacturing in Mexico for U.S. consumers or moving U.S. jobs abroad.

Trump also slammed Lockheed Martin and Boeing Co for what he called "out of control" costs on their weapons programs.

Both Lockheed and Boeing have said they will work to drive down costs of the programs, while Ford scrapped plans to build a $1.6 billion plant in Mexico, and United Tech's Carrier unit is keeping half of the 2,100 U.S. jobs it was to shift to Mexico.

Government relations and public relations advisers say they have received a number of calls from companies wanting help in assessing if they have any red flags that could draw Trump's ire.

Advisers say these potentially include outsourcing of manufacturing, consumer price increases and lower tax rates than peer companies.

"We have literally had about a dozen clients ask us how they should be thinking about this in the last few weeks," said George Sard, chairman and CEO of strategic communications firm Sard Verbinnen & Co, adding that he is seeing concern from companies in a wide range of industries.

"The week after the election it was non-stop meetings and conference calls and analysis," said Kent Jarrell, crisis and litigation communication expert at APCO Worldwide. "It's almost like a whole new Trump practice is developing."

Corporate leaders, say the advisers, can no longer focus only on maximizing shareholder value; they must now also weigh national interest.

"CEOs are talking to their boards saying we've got to be viewed pro-America. If something is more on the margin – like layoffs, or moving manufacturing, then they are not going to do it," said one Fortune 500 CEO, who said he had spoken with other U.S. companies.

TAKING A PAGE FROM TRUMP PLAYBOOK

Sard, of Sard Verbinnen & Co, said that while companies are well advised not to get into a Twitter war with Trump, his firm is advising clients to "learn from his playbook" and be prepared to communicate directly with shareholders, employees, and customers through blogs and social media.

There is already evidence that companies are quickly adjusting to the new Trump era. Firms have been more vocal in publicizing job creation and they have sometimes let Trump claim credit.

Fiat Chrysler Automobiles , the No. 3 automaker in the United States, announced plans on Sunday to create 2,000 U.S. jobs. The timing was partly influenced by CEO Sergio Marchionne's desire to get the news out ahead of any possible criticism from Trump for the automaker's overseas manufacturing, a person familiar with the company's thinking said.

Trump has in the past few weeks attacked FCA's two Detroit rivals, as well as Japan-based Toyota, for their manufacturing operations in Mexico and threatened to impose stiff border taxes on any imports.

In December, SoftBank Group Corp <9984.T>, majority owner of Sprint Corp , unveiled a $50 billion U.S. investment at the Trump Tower in Manhattan. Trump and SoftBank head Masayoshi Son made the announcement together, and Trump later tweeted: "He would never do this had we (Trump) not won the election!"

"You never want to be against the president - especially not one as vocal as (Trump)," the Fortune 500 CEO said.

UPDATE 1-Automakers overhaul product plans to bet more on SUVs - Reuters News

{{20170110T171022.379+0000}}UPDATE 1-Automakers overhaul product plans to bet more on SUVs(Adds link to graphic)

By Alexandria Sage

DETROIT, Jan 10 (Reuters) - Global automakers are reworking their product strategies and investments for the United States to bring more sport utility vehicles to showrooms amid a sharp turn away from small- and medium-sized cars, executives at Detroit's auto show say.

Carmakers from Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T> to General Motors Co to Volkswagen AG are adding more SUVs to their product plans, amid forecasts that SUVs and pickup trucks could soon make up two-thirds of U.S. light vehicle sales, up from 56 percent in 2015 and just under 60 percent last year.

"The shift to trucks is profound," said Mike Jackson, chief executive of AutoNation Inc , the largest U.S. auto dealership chain.

Sedans are not only losing sales volume, but automakers and dealers are offering bigger discounts to move them out of showrooms, industry executives said. Profit margins on SUVs and trucks are fatter.

The average incentive for a midsize car in September was 14.1 percent, according to Kelley Blue Book, compared with 7.4 percent for a midsize crossover.

The shift has forced some automakers to slash production capacity dedicated just a few years ago to small cars, and put a new emphasis on designing vehicles and assembly plants that can switch quickly from building cars to SUVs.

Volkswagen's Audi unit, for example, builds a small Q2 SUV and its A3 sedan on the same assembly line, Dietmar Voggenreiter, head of sales and marketing for Audi, said in an interview. "We will always have an SUV and a sedan" on the same production line, he said.

Automakers are bringing SUVs into segments that previously were only for cars.

Case in point is Nissan Motor Co's <7201.T> Rogue Sport, revealed on Monday at the North American International Auto Show, an Americanized version of the small Qashqai SUV Nissan has sold for several years in Europe and Asia.

"The increasing shift of cars to crossovers finally drove our decision to bring this car to the U.S.," said Michael Bunce, vice president of product strategy for Nissan's U.S. arm.

The Rogue Sport will be sold alongside the slightly larger Rogue, appealing to consumers who previously would have had only small cars to choose from.

The cars to SUV shift is hitting luxury brands, as well.

At German luxury automaker BMW last year, about 43 percent of U.S. sales were SUVs. In December, that percentage neared 50, said Ian Robertson, the German luxury brand's global sales chief.

"I think that tells you where the trend is in the U.S., probably on a 50-50 level," Robertson told Reuters.

At Toyota Motor Co <7203.T>, SUVs and trucks will account for about 63 percent of U.S. sales in 2017, said North America CEO Jim Lentz, predicting its RAV4 SUV could top the Camry this year as its best-selling U.S. vehicle.

Honda Motor Co <7267.T> is working to expand production of SUVs for the U.S. market, shifting production of the Acura MDX sport utility to a factory in Ohio to make room for additional production of higher volume Pilot SUVs and Ridgeline pickup trucks, Chief Executive Takahiro Hachigo said.

Cheap gasoline is emboldening some automakers to add more SUVs based on body-on-frame pickup truck designs - after years of shifting SUVs to lighter, car-like unitized body construction.

Ford Motor Co is reviving its Bronco SUV. It was last built in 1996 after gaining notoriety as the vehicle used during O.J. Simpson's police pursuit. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV on Sunday outlined plans to bring back a body on frame SUV for its Jeep line.

SEDAN SLOWDOWN

The focus on SUVs leaves carmakers who have an overcapacity of sedans in a weak position. Ford's announcement last week to scrap a planned Mexico factory was attributed to falling U.S. demand for sedans. [nL1N1ET0V9]

"The sedan market is under real pressure. If you don't have SUVs in all categories you are in serious difficulty," warned Lex Kerssemakers, CEO of Volvo Cars USA, whose flagship U.S. model is the XC90 SUV.

Lexus global chief Tokuo Fukuichi said the idea of building a luxury car brand around a large sedan such as the Lexus LS unveiled in Detroit is now "under assault."

Mark Reuss, head of global product development, said the automaker is looking for ways to offer attributes of SUVs in more designs that are more innovative than the square-backed vehicles that dominate the category now.

"You'll see them in the next year," he said, vehicles that offer "an alternative to a box."

RPT-ANALYSIS-Two faces of GM: Electric for the city, trucks for the heartland - Reuters News

{{20170110T120002.133+0000}}RPT-ANALYSIS-Two faces of GM: Electric for the city, trucks for the heartland(Repeating for additional clients with no changes to text)

By Paul Lienert and Joseph White

DETROIT, Jan 9 (Reuters) - General Motors Co Chief Executive Mary Barra says often that the auto industry will change more during the next decade than it has in the past half-century, as she highlights how GM will keep up.

In 2016, it has invested nearly $1 billion to buy a self-driving car technology startup, Cruise Automation; invested $500 million into ride services company Lyft; launched a new car-sharing brand, Maven, and a new electric car, the Chevrolet Bolt.

The automaker is also expanding the array of services available via the high-speed mobile internet connections embedded in millions of GM vehicles.

None of those high-profile moves, however, are likely to have much near-term impact on the No. 1 U.S. automaker's bottom line.

For now and for years to come, GM will make money the way it did 60 years ago: By selling large vehicles built on steel frames, with V8 engines driving the rear wheels. In 1957, that technology was sold as a Chevy Bel Air. Today, it is packaged as a Chevrolet Silverado pickup truck or a Cadillac Escalade SUV.

The company makes more than 90 percent of its profits, before interest and taxes, in its North American auto operations. The bulk of those profits come from sales of trucks and SUVs, analysts and company executives said.

"That business model has worked and continues to work," GM President Dan Ammann told Reuters. "We believe that model will keep going, particularly in places where we are strongest, for a long time."

GM is pursuing a two-pronged strategy, aimed at the increasingly divergent segments of its home market.

In big cities along the coasts, GM is widening its efforts to capture urban consumers who are shifting away from traditional vehicle ownership and some day may get around by summoning self-driving cars with a smartphone.

"We're at the very infancy of that," Ammann said.

Ride sharing today accounts for less than 1 percent of all miles traveled in the United States. But if buying rides by the mile takes off, it could be a "significant" opportunity, he said.

Earlier this week, GM's Cadillac luxury division launched in New York what it said was the industry's first service allowing customers to pay a monthly fee to drive any of the brand's models.

GM has a different plan for the heartland – the red states that backed Donald Trump for president, where trucks and SUVs sell by the hundreds of thousands and electric cars sell by the hundreds - or less.

GM is investing billions in U.S. factories to expand production of large trucks and SUVs.

Defending the V8 truck franchise is critical to GM. More than 90 percent of GM's pickup trucks are sold with V8 engines, said Dan Nicholson, head of the company's propulsion systems engineering operations.

As of now, he said, GM does not have a V8 that can comply with the 2025 emissions standards - put in place by the outgoing Obama administration - without turning off customers who like the trucks as the are.

The Alliance for Automobile Manufacturers, which includes GM, is lobbying the incoming Trump administration to revise those standards.

GM is meanwhile working on improving the fuel efficiency of its V8 engines, Nicholson said, but current fuel economy rules could force the company to limit availability and raise the price of trucks equipped with the larger engines.

Rival Ford Motor Co, with its F-150 pickup, has already made the transition to V6 turbo engines - which now sell in larger volumes than its V8 trucks - along with aluminum body panels that reduce weight and boost fuel economy.

DUAL AUDIENCES, MESSAGES

GM's dual marketing strategies - one for the heartland, the other for the coasts - will be on display at the Detroit Auto Show this week.

The automaker will feature new SUV models including a large Chevrolet Traverse and a revamped GMC Terrain compact SUV. On Chevrolet's show stand, the electric Bolt hatchback will be presented as one of the brand's family of SUVs, along with the hulking Chevrolet Suburban.

At a scheduled Jan. 10 presentation, GM also will have a dual message for investors: Trucks make the money, and the investments in alternatives to that business are still modest and pose no threat to GM's promises of profitability.

The automaker has assured investors it will boost pre-tax profit margins to 9 to 10 percent by early in the next decade, and buy back $9 billion worth shares for the period 2015-2017.

The company's current results need no explanation, Amman told Reuters. "It's a very strong performance," he said.

For urban customers, and an increasing number of younger customers who are less interested in car ownership, GM is preparing alternatives at a measured pace.

The electric Bolt illustrates GM's approach. Tesla Motors Inc Chief Executive Elon Musk has said he intends to build 500,000 of his planned Model 3 electric sedans annually by 2020. That would be about six times the number of battery electric cars sold in the U.S. last year, based on data from the Electric Drive Transportation Association, a trade group.

Suppliers have said that GM, by contrast, plans to build about 20,000 to 30,000 of its Chevrolet Bolt electric vehicles annually. Many are expected to serve in Lyft ride hailing fleets.

GM officials have not said how many Bolts the company will build. But Mike Abelson, GM's vice president for strategy and global portfolio planning, told Reuters that it will err on the side of building too few than too many to suit consumer demand.

"We'd rather have the problem of working fast to increase volume" than building too many cars that languish on dealer lots, he said.

UNCERTAIN FUTURE

The Bolt is now a centerpiece of GM's efforts to appeal to urban audiences – which includes investors on Wall Street and regulators in California. The bulk of U.S. electric car sales are in California because the state requires automakers to deliver an escalating number of "zero-emission vehicles" each year.

Coastal dwellers buy a relatively small share of the gasoline-powered vehicles GM sells in the U.S. The automaker's market share in California is just 9.9 percent, compared to about 17 percent in the nation as a whole, according to IHS Markit data.

"We're 10 percent in San Francisco. In New York, we're below 7 percent," said Julia Steyn, head of GM's new Maven ride services unit.

Maven is offering short-term loans of GM vehicles in a growing number of cities where GM's market share is below the nationwide average.

"We're getting new customers," Steyn said.

Compare GM's California market share to the 27.4 share, according to IHS Markit, that GM enjoys in Indiana, where people buy four-door Silverado pickups as family transportation.

Maven has about 8,000 vehicles in its fleet. GM sells more than eight times that many vehicles in a month.

Asked when Maven will be a significant contributor to GM's revenues - currently more than $150 billion a year - Steyn laughed.

"Let me live until 2021," she said. "I'll tell you then."

France's Le Pen says would seek Trump-style repatriation of car plants - Reuters News

{{20170110T085424.603+0000}}France's Le Pen says would seek Trump-style repatriation of car plantsPARIS, Jan 10 (Reuters) - Far-right French presidential candidate Marine Le Pen said on Tuesday she would seek to repatriate production of French motor vehicles and other industrial goods - just as President-elect Donald Trump hopes to do in the United States.

Trump has threatened to slap tariffs on cars made abroad, saying the practice costs American jobs. He has praised Ford Motor Co's decision last week to scrap a plan to build a plant in Mexico, and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles' confirmation of plans to create 2,000 jobs at its U.S. factories.

Asked whether she would like to see the same thing happen with French manufacturers Renault and PSA Peugeot Citroen , the National Front (FN) leader said: "He (Trump) is putting in place measures I have been demanding for years."

Speaking on France 2 Television, she described the policy as "economic patriotism, (and) intelligent protectionism."

"I don't mind explaining to French companies that they can not escape tax that they should be paying in France, that they cannot go offshore without suffering the consequences ... A choice has to be made, a choice of patriotism.

Both Renault and Peugeot have significant cars and parts-making activities in Spain and eastern Europe.

Other candidates in France's spring presidential election have praised Trump's attitude on Ford, including Socialist Arnaud Montebourg and left-wing independent Jean-Luc Melenchon.

Le Pen's protectionist and anti-globalisation agenda has helped win her widespread support in her campaign. Most opinion polls show her contesting, but losing, the second and final round of the presidential election in May with Francois Fillon who represents conservative party The Republicans.

Industrial policy is one of the key differences between the two. Fillon has a liberal programme aimed at rolling back state involvement in corporate life.

On Dec. 1 he advocated selling government holdings in major companies, saying the government's near-20 percent stake in Renault was pointless and could not prevent it from building factories abroad. [nL8N1DW478

Q&A-What does Trump's 'big border tax' threat really mean? - Reuters News

{{20170109T223559.721+0000}}Q&A-What does Trump's 'big border tax' threat really mean?WASHINGTON, Jan 9 (Reuters) - In a series of tweets, President-elect Donald Trump has recently threatened several companies with "big border tax" if they expand manufacturing facilities abroad for products to be sold into the United States, but he has provided few details.

Whether he is talking about a tax or a tariff is unclear, experts said, reacting to Trump's terse warnings to United Technologies Corp , General Motors Co , Ford Motor Co and Japan's Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T>.

Trump has said U.S. companies that shut manufacturing plants and lay off workers only to open new facilities abroad would pay a 35 percent tax or tariff on products they ship back to the U.S. market.

Asked about the issue on a conference call with reporters on Monday, Trump transition team spokesman Sean Spicer said the president-elect had been focused on U.S.-based employers that "move overseas for the express purpose of selling back to the U.S. market with non-U.S. workers. ... That continues to stand."

Further details were not immediately available.

Q: Could Trump impose his own import tax on U.S. companies?

A. No. Congress writes the tax laws and the revenue-raising power of the federal government is held primarily by the House of Representatives under the Constitution. Tax laws are enforced by the Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service.

Q: Could Trump impose a tariff on his own?

A. Perhaps, but he would likely face a legal challenge. Like taxes, tariffs are also revenue-raising measures.

New York University School of Law tax professor Daniel Shaviro said the president's power to impose tariffs on his own was "highly contested. ... Targeting one particular company would certainly add to the legal, as well as the policy concerns."

Shaviro said selective tariffs on individual companies, including foreign-based ones, would likely draw a challenge through the World Trade Organization and trigger retaliation.

Brooklyn Law School professor Rebecca Kysar wrote in an op-ed last week in the New York Times that Trump was floating the idea of a 5 to 10 percent imports tariff imposed by executive action. She said that would be unconstitutional, citing the origination clause that vests revenue-raising power in Congress.

Q: Is Trump signaling support for a border tax in Congress?

A. Some experts said Trump's tweets might mean he supports an unprecedented export-boosting approach to corporate taxation that is being proposed by Republicans in the House of Representatives, including House Speaker Paul Ryan.

Known as border adjustability, the approach is intended to help U.S. manufacturers by favoring exports over imports. As laid out in Ryan's "Better Way" agenda, companies would pay no tax on revenues from exports and would be unable to deduct the cost of imports from their taxable income.

Advocates said if that approach became law, it would attract investment to the United States, provide incentives to manufacturers to maintain or expand their U.S. facilities, and dissuade companies from leaving the country. But some tax experts are skeptical it will be approved by Congress.

Q: Are Trump's tweets in line with the border adjustability plan?

A. Not exactly. His comments have stirred anxiety in business circles about the possibility of a special penalty tax on U.S. companies that send jobs overseas. By contrast, the House Republican proposal would treat all imported products equally, whether produced by U.S. or foreign-owned companies.

Q: Where does Trump get the 35 percent figure he cites for the tax or tariff he has warned U.S. companies that shut manufacturing plants only to open new facilities abroad will pay on products they ship back to the U.S. market.

?

A. That is not clear either. Experts said the president-elect may be referring in his tweets to the current 35 percent U.S. corporate income tax rate. That would also differ from the House Republican plan, which would impose a 20 percent tax on imports.

While some experts said Trump could follow the House Republican approach and subject all imports to a lower tax rate, others said Trump had indicated an interest in using different tax rates to penalize or reward certain business behaviors.

For example, a tax reform plan released by Trump in September called for cutting the corporate tax rate to 15 percent but added a potentially important caveat: "This rate is available to all businesses, both small and large, that want to retain the profits within the business."

Q: When might we know more about Trump's plans?

A. Trump himself could offer more details at any time, including at a news conference scheduled for Wednesday. Some expect House Republicans to unveil initial tax reform legislation by the end of February. That timetable could slip as Republicans and their staff discuss sweeping reforms with the Trump transition team, analysts said.

FACTBOX-Automakers reveal new models at the Detroit auto show - Reuters News

{{20170109T223406.500+0000}}FACTBOX-Automakers reveal new models at the Detroit auto show(Adds more models, details)

Jan 9 (Reuters) - Global automakers kicked off 2017 displaying a wide array of future vehicles at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit. Luxury sedans and small sport utility vehicles jostled for the spotlight along with electric cars and diesel-powered pickup trucks. When it came to industry profits, the trucks and SUVs were at center-stage.

Here are some of the notable vehicle debuts at the Detroit show, which opens to the public on Saturday, January 14.

* Nissan Rogue Sport. A 5-passenger SUV that will be slightly smaller than the Nissan <7201.T> Rogue, which has become the top-selling model in the company's U.S. lineup. Rogue was the top-selling non-pickup truck in the U.S. in December. It will go on sale in the spring. This is part of Nissan's response to U.S. consumers' growing preference for SUVs of all sizes.

* Kia Motors Co <000270.KS> Stinger. The Stinger is a new 5-passenger fastback sport sedan. Kia said it would produce the Stinger after showing a concept version of it earlier. The car was designed in Frankfurt. It will go on sale in the U.S. market in late 2017.

* Lexus LS. Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T> debuted the first Lexus LS 400 sedan in Detroit at the 1989 auto show. On Monday, the brand unveiled the fifth generation of its big sedan to a market that is turning away from the traditional concept that a luxury brand's "flagship" model must be a sedan, instead of a sport utility vehicle. The brand also is showing a compact crossover concept called UX.

* BMW 5-series. BMW AG has already taken the wraps off the look of the new 5-series, which competes with the Mercedes E-class and Audi A6. The German luxury automaker displayed a plug-in hybrid version of the car for the first time in Detroit. Like its competitors, the 5-series is losing ground to SUVs - and the Tesla Model S electric sedan - among affluent U.S. buyers. BMW also is showing a compact X2 crossover concept.

* Honda Odyssey. Just in time for millennials starting to have the baby boom generation's grandchildren, Honda Motor Co <7267.T> debuted a new generation of its Odyssey minivan. The minivan segment has shrunk since the former Chrysler Corp pioneered the concept of a boxy family hauler in the 1980s, but sales in the segment rose 8 percent last year.

* Ford F-150. Ford Motor Co will give the 2018 model of the best-selling vehicle in the United States some modest appearance changes, and more significantly, new technology to reduce fuel consumption. For the first time, Ford will offer a diesel engine option in the F-150. The company is not releasing fuel economy estimates for that engine. A new 3.3-liter six-cylinder engine will also be offered and fuel-saving technology that shuts down the engine at a stop light will be available.

* Chevrolet Traverse. General Motors Co highlighted two redesigned sport utility vehicles in Detroit, including a new generation of the Chevrolet Traverse, a family hauling SUV that will compete with the likes of the Ford Explorer, Honda Pilot, Toyota Highlander and Jeep Grand Cherokee.

* Toyota Camry. The best-selling passenger car in the United States for the past 15 years got a major makeover. Camry sales fell 9.5 percent in 2016 from the year before, reflecting pressure from the shift to SUVs. Overall, mid-sized sedan sales in the United States fell 10 percent. Toyota <7203.T> has been giving its mainstream models more expressive styling and advanced technology, to counter a long-held image for dull reliability. The 2018 Camry is expected to reflect that direction.

* Mercedes-Benz E Class Coupe. Daimler AG's mainstream brand has redesigned its mid-size E Class Coupe. It also showed a facelifted version of the GLA compact crossover, as well as a redesigned Smart Electric Drive.

* Audi Q8. Audi, the high-volume luxury brand of Volkswagen AG showed a concept of a new, large sport utility vehicle in Detroit. It is also unveiling a facelifted version of its SQ5 mid-size SUV and redesigned A5 cabriolet.

* Volkswagen Tiguan. The mid-size Tiguan crossover utility vehicle has been redesigned. VW is also displaying yet another revival of its classic Microbus, this time as a battery-powered electric concept called I.D. Buzz.

* Infiniti QX50. Nissan's luxury brand is showing a concept version of its redesigned QX50 mid-size SUV.

* GMC Terrain. The brand's compact SUV gets its first major redesign, sharing major components with the redesigned Chevrolet Equinox.

Ford says Bronco SUV, Ranger midsize pickup truck to return in U.S. - Reuters News

{{20170109T144921.880+0000}}Ford says Bronco SUV, Ranger midsize pickup truck to return in U.S.DETROIT, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co will return to its U.S. model lineup the Bronco, a truck-like SUV, and the midsize pickup truck Ranger, the company said on Monday at the Detroit auto show.

Both new products will be made at the Michigan Assembly Plant outside Detroit, where the Focus compact sedan is made. Ford had previously said the Focus would be made at a plant in Mexico.

Both models are part of Ford's response to the growing attraction of U.S. consumers toward SUVs and pickup trucks and away from sedans.

Trump praises Ford, Fiat for U.S. investments - Reuters News

{{20170109T142849.714+0000}}Trump praises Ford, Fiat for U.S. investmentsWASHINGTON, Jan 9 (Reuters) - President-elect Donald Trump praised Ford Motor Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV for announcing new investments in the United States after he made U.S. auto production a key part of his campaign.

Ford announced last week it would abandon plans to build a $1.6 billion plant in Mexico and invest $700 million in a Michigan plant over four years, while Fiat Chrysler said Sunday it will invest $1 billion and add 2,000 jobs at plants in Ohio and Michigan to build new SUVs and pickup trucks. Both companies have said they made the decision for business reasons and not because of pressure from Trump.

RPT-UPDATE 4-Fiat Chrysler ups the ante as automakers respond to Trump - Reuters News

{{20170109T120001.965+0000}}RPT-UPDATE 4-Fiat Chrysler ups the ante as automakers respond to Trump(Repeats with no changes to text)

By Bernie Woodall and David Shepardson

DETROIT, Jan 8 (Reuters) - Fiat Chrysler Automobiles on Sunday said it will invest $1 billion to modernize two plants in the U.S. Midwest and create 2,000 jobs, upping the ante as automakers respond to threats from President-elect Donald Trump to slap new taxes on imported vehicles.

FCA's announcement that it would retool factories in Ohio and Michigan to build new Jeep sport utility vehicles, including a pickup truck, and potentially move production of a Ram heavy-duty pickup truck to Michigan from Mexico, also highlighted the auto industry's keen interest in getting relief from tough fuel economy rules enacted by the outgoing Obama administration.

General Motors Co Chief Executive Mary Barra on Sunday said tax reform and "streamlining regulations ... are just two areas that would be extremely beneficial" for Trump to address. Trump has criticized GM for building cars in Mexico while laying off workers in the United States.

Barra, who is on an advisory committee to Trump, told reporters that decisions about where to build specific vehicles are made "two, three four years ago". Overall, she said of Trump, "we have much more in common than we have different".

Barra had a conversation with Trump on Tuesday, a person briefed on the call told Reuters. Barra declined to discuss her conversations with Trump.

Many automakers plan to use the annual North American International Auto show in Detroit, which started on Saturday, to tout investments in the United States and a commitment to U.S. employment against the backdrop of Trump's criticism of automakers for shipping vehicles into the U.S. from Mexico.

Daimler AG Chief Executive Dieter Zetsche on Sunday said during an auto show event that the German automaker plans to invest another $1.3 billion to expand sport utility vehicle (SUV) production at a factory in Alabama.

Automakers are girding for rounds of questions about Mexican investments and U.S. jobs in the wake of Trump's harsh criticism of automakers.

Most of the major automakers in the U.S. have substantial vehicle making operations in Mexico, as well as complex networks of parts makers that supply their factories in the U.S. and support jobs and investment in states such as Ohio and Michigan.

FCA's investment decisions were not related to Trump's recent attacks Ford Motor Co , GM and Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T> for building cars for the U.S. market in Mexico, people familiar with company's moves said on Sunday. [nL1N1EV1FV]

The company had already signaled plans to expand truck and SUV production at its U.S. plants, and discontinued production of small and medium-sized cars in two U.S. factories.

FCA executives did not confer with Trump before making the decision on the new big SUVs and a Jeep pickup truck, according to a person familiar with the company's thinking.

The same source said FCA CEO Sergio Marchionne wanted to get out the news about adding jobs and investment in the United States in case the company encounters more criticism from Trump.

Still, Fiat Chrysler's announcement landed as global auto industry executives gathered for the annual auto show in a climate of growing uncertainty about the trade and regulatory policies the new Republican administration will pursue.

Trump, who will be inaugurated on Jan. 20, has talked about rolling back environmental regulations, and supporting corporate tax cuts - moves automakers would welcome.

He has just as explicitly warned that he will move to raise the costs of importing vehicles from Mexico, a policy industry executives said could hurt their businesses.

PLAYING UP U.S. INVESTMENTS

Since Trump's election, automakers and other companies have played up their investments in the United States.

Last week, Ford scrapped plans to build a $1.6 billion plant in Mexico and invest $700 million in a factory in Michigan. Ford will still move production of Focus small cars to Mexico, but will instead cut total production of the cars by consolidating their assembly in an existing Mexican plant. [nL1N1ET0OD]

Hinrich Woebcken, chief executive of the North America Region for German automaker Volkswagen AG , told Reuters on Sunday the automaker plans to invest $7 billion in the United States between 2015 and 2019 and will start building its new Atlas SUV in Tennessee later this year.

Volkswagen has had a plant in Mexico for 50 years and it is not shifting any jobs to Mexico from the United States.

"We do not make our investment decisions based on administrative cycles. Our business is really an 8-, 12-, 14-year horizon when we look at investments," Woebcken said on the sidelines of the Detroit auto show.

FCA said a plant in Warren, Michigan, near Detroit, would make the Jeep Wagoneer and Jeep Grand Wagoneer SUVs, while a Toledo, Ohio, factory would produce the Jeep pickup.

The company said the production plans in Ohio and Michigan were "subject to the negotiation and final approval of incentives by state and local entities".

U.S. consumers have increasingly shifted toward SUVs and pickup trucks and away from sedans in recent years, as gasoline prices have remained relatively low.

A year ago, Marchionne said FCA would cease production of two sedans and focus on SUVs and pickups.

Marchionne said in a statement on Sunday that the lineup changes were due to that consumer shift.

"We continue to reinforce the U.S. as a global manufacturing hub" for SUVs and pickup trucks, he added.

FACTBOX-Automakers reveal new models at the Detroit auto show - Reuters News

{{20170108T232402.414+0000}}FACTBOX-Automakers reveal new models at the Detroit auto show(Adds additional model debuts for Volkswagen, FCA/Waymo)

Jan 8 (Reuters) - Global automakers will kick off 2017 by displaying a wide array of future vehicles at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit. This year, luxury sedans and small sport utility vehicles will jostle for the spotlight along with electric cars and diesel-powered pickup trucks. When it comes to industry profits, the trucks and SUVs will be at center stage.

Here are some of the notable vehicle debuts expected at the Detroit show, which opens to the public on Saturday, Jan. 14.

* Lexus LS. Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T> debuted the first Lexus LS 400 sedan in Detroit at the 1989 auto show. On Monday, the brand will unveil the fifth generation of its big sedan to a market that is turning away from the traditional concept that a luxury brand's "flagship" model must be a sedan, instead of a sport utility vehicle.

* BMW 5-series. BMW AG has already taken the wraps off the look of the new 5-series, which competes with the Mercedes E-class and Audi A6. The German luxury automaker plans to display a plug-in hybrid version of the car for the first time in Detroit. Like its competitors, the 5-series is losing ground to SUVs - and the Tesla Model S electric sedan - among affluent U.S. buyers.

* Fiat Chrysler and Waymo. Fiat Chrysler and Waymo, the self driving car unit of Silicon Valley's Alphabet Inc unveiled one of the self-driving Chrysler Pacifica minivans developed under an alliance.

* Volkswagen. Volkswagen will display a prototype for an eight-passenger, electric microbus, called the I.D. Buzz. It is the latest in a series of show cars designed to kindle consumer interest in a 21st Century version of the classic microbus that helped to propel the VW brand's growth in the United States during the 1960s.

* Honda Odyssey. Just in time for millennials starting to have the baby boom generation's grandchildren, Honda Motor Co <7267.T> is expected to debut in Detroit a new generation of its Odyssey minivan. The minivan segment has shrunk since the former Chrysler Corp pioneered the concept of a boxy family hauler in the 1980s, but sales in the segment rose 8 percent last year.

* Ford F-150. Ford Motor Co will give the 2018 model of the best-selling vehicle in the United States some modest appearance changes, and more significantly, new technology to reduce fuel consumption. For the first time, Ford will offer a diesel engine option in the F-150. The company is not releasing fuel economy estimates for that engine. A new 3.3 liter six cylinder engine will also be offered and fuel-saving technology that shuts down the engine at a stop light will be available.

* Chevrolet Traverse. General Motors Co is highlighting two redesigned sport utility vehicles in Detroit, including a new generation of the Chevrolet Traverse, a family hauling SUV that will compete with the likes of the Ford Explorer, Honda Pilot, Toyota Highlander and Jeep Grand Cherokee.

* Toyota Camry. The best-selling passenger car in the United States for the past 15 years gets a major makeover. Camry sales fell 9.5 percent in 2016 from the year before, reflecting pressure from the shift to SUVs. Overall, mid-sized sedan sales in the United States fell 10 percent. Toyota has been giving its mainstream models more expressive styling and advanced technology, to counter a long-held image for dull reliability. The 2018 Camry is expected to reflect that direction.

* Audi SUV. Analysts expect Audi, the high-volume luxury brand of Volkswagen AG, to show a new, large sport utility vehicle in Detroit. The mainstream Volkswagen brand, meanwhile, is expected to highlight a new generation of its compact Tiguan sport utility.

* Nissan. Nissan Motor Co <7201.T> is expected on Monday to debut a new small SUV for the U.S. market as well as a redesigned QX50 compact SUV for the Infiniti luxury brand.

CORRECTED-RPT-Automakers, suppliers team up to share costs of self-driving cars - Reuters News

{{20170108T184813.983+0000}}CORRECTED-RPT-Automakers, suppliers team up to share costs of self-driving cars(In 9th paragraph, corrects cost of Delphi turn-key system to $5,000 from $8,000)

By Paul Lienert and Alexandria Sage

LAS VEGAS, Jan 8 (Reuters) - Automotive suppliers and automakers are expanding alliances to develop self-driving car technology that can serve multiple automakers, as the race to put such vehicles on the road separates companies that can go it alone from those that need help sharing the financial and technical burdens.

While some companies, such as Tesla Motors , General Motors and Ford Motor , are trying to develop proprietary driverless systems, a larger group of automakers appears to have decided it makes more sense to develop self-driving technology in collaboration with suppliers – as many other features such as anti-lock brakes or radar-enabled cruise control already are.

"What's going on in the industry right now is like a hyper version of musical chairs - and the music is still playing," said Gill Pratt, chief executive officer of Toyota Research Institute. "Everyone is changing partners."

Several suppliers - notably Mobileye , Nvidia and Delphi Automotive - are among the more popular technology partners in the self-driving race, with multiple alliances around the globe.

"If you want to build a truly autonomous car, this is a task for more than one player," said Amnon Shashua, chief executive of Mobileye, an Israeli-based supplier of mapping and vision-based sensing systems.

"The technological challenges are immense," Shashua told Reuters. "I would compare it to sending a man to the moon."

Mobileye supplies cameras, chips and software for driver assist systems - the building blocks for self-driving cars - to more than two dozen manufacturers around the globe. The company was an early supplier of vision systems to Tesla, but the two companies had an acrimonious and public breakup last summer after the driver of a Tesla Model S was killed while operating his vehicle using Tesla's Autopilot system. [nL8N1BS35L]

Since the break with Tesla, Mobileye has secured two critical partnerships to develop self-driving systems: With German automaker BMW and U.S. chipmaker Intel , and with longtime supplier Delphi .

The Delphi-Mobileye alliance involves a turn-key system that the partners plan to offer to smaller automakers that lack the resources to develop such systems on their own. It will be ready for production by 2019, said Jeff Owens, Delphi's chief technology officer, with a projected wholesale cost of about $5,000.

The alliance with BMW and Intel is expected to draw additional vehicle manufacturers and suppliers, according to Elmar Frickenstein, BMW's senior vice president for automated driving.

"We would like to create a standard system for everybody to use by 2021," Frickenstein said. "That would share the costs and speed up the process of development and adoption."

Eventually, BMW and its partners could offer self-driving hardware and software sets or an entire driverless system on a non-exclusive basis to companies ranging from Uber [UBER.UL] to Google , Frickenstein said.

A blueprint for collaboration is BMW's joint ownership with Daimler AG and Volkswagen AG's Audi of Here, the mapping company acquired in late 2015 from Nokia . Since then, both Intel and Mobileye have teamed with Here to pool and share data.

Chipmaker Nvidia also is ramping up its partnerships in self-driving technology and systems, this week announcing deals with Audi and Here, as well as German suppliers ZF [ZFF.UL] and Bosch [ROBG.UL].

"We're not looking to develop a proprietary system," said Dirk Hoheisel, the member of Bosch's board of management who oversees autonomous driving. "We want to work with others to develop a standard platform and open standards for self-driving systems, especially around data and mapping."

While pursuing similar partnerships with suppliers, Audi sees its role as a vehicle manufacturer evolving to that of systems integrator.

"There's not one supplier out there who can provide the whole solution - no one who knows everything, every part of what's needed to make an autonomous car," said Alejandro Vukotich, Audi's head of development for driver assistance systems.

Some key components of self-driving systems - cybersecurity, for instance - should remain the responsibility of vehicle manufacturers, said Guillaume Devauchelle, head of innovation and scientific development at French supplier Valeo .

But carmakers also will continue to rely on suppliers to provide specific self-driving technologies, he said.

"There will be a mix because it's quite a complex system (with) sensing, data fusion, artificial intelligence, connectivity, man-machine interface and so on," Devauchelle said. "Those are big blocks."

Amazon's Alexa moves in on Google's Android system - Reuters News

{{20170107T000125.803+0000}}Amazon's Alexa moves in on Google's Android systemBy Julia Love

Jan 6 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc's digital assistant appeared almost everywhere at the CES technology show this week in Las Vegas, even making an unexpected appearance on rival Google's Android system.

Companies ranging from appliance maker Whirlpool Corp to Ford Motor Co unveiled products featuring Alexa, the digital assistant from Amazon that responds to voice commands.

Most strikingly, Chinese firm Huawei Technologies Co [HWT.UL], which manufactures smartphones running on the Android operating system produced by Alphabet Inc's Google, announced that its flagship handset will come with an app that gives users access to Alexa in the United States.

The adoption of Alexa by a prominent Android manufacturer indicates that Amazon may have opened up an early lead over Google as the companies race to present their digital assistants to as many people as possible, analysts said.

Many in the technology industry believe that such voice-powered digital assistants will supplant keyboards and touch screens as a primary way consumers interact with devices.

While the shift is only in the early stages, Google must establish a strong presence quickly, particularly on Android devices, to maintain its dominance in internet search, said analyst Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research.

"To the extent that voice becomes more important and something other than Google's voice assistant becomes the most popular voice interface on Android phones, that's a huge loss for Google in terms of data gathering, training its AI (artificial intelligence), and ultimately the ability to drive advertising revenue," he said.

Alexa debuted on the Amazon Echo smart speaker, and Amazon is establishing a broad array of hardware and software partnerships around it. The competing Google Assistant launched last year on the company's Pixel smartphone, after appearing on Google's messaging app, and has begun to roll out to third-party devices as well. Graphics processor maker Nvidia Corp announced at CES that its Shield television will feature the assistant.

While Google has expressed an interest in bringing its assistant to other Android smartphones, the decision to debut the feature on its own hardware may have strained relations with manufacturers, Dawson said.

"It highlights just what a strategic mistake it can be for services companies to make their own hardware and give it preferential access to new services," he said.

A spokeswoman for Google declined to comment.

While Amazon has a head start, Google is no by no means out of the race, given the strength of its internet search technology. The Google Assistant can already field queries that Alexa cannot, said Sergei Burkov, chief executive of Alterra.ai, an artificial intelligence company.

"A huge part of an assistant is search," he said. "Google is a search company. Amazon is not."

UPDATE 1-Ford plant turns 'cemetery' as Trump wrenches Mexican autos - Reuters News

{{20170106T232047.931+0000}}UPDATE 1-Ford plant turns 'cemetery' as Trump wrenches Mexican autos(Adds government comment on threats to investment)

By Christine Murray

SAN LUIS POTOSI, Mexico, Jan 6 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co's abrupt move to scrap a planned $1.6 billion car plant in central Mexico has spooked a network of suppliers who bet on a growing customer base and dramatized the risk that Donald Trump's agenda poses to the country's broader economy.

Many auto parts makers had started to expand in anticipation of Ford's plant in the state of San Luis Potosi, where industry is "easily 70 percent" dependent on the auto sector, said Julian Eaves, managing director of Preferred Compounding de Mexico, a U.S.-owned maker of rubber compounds operating here.

"It's going to have a huge impact on the local community," said Eaves.

The loss to the economy, Eaves calculates, could run into the hundreds of millions of dollars, and maybe even into the billions, over the next five years, as manufacturing, contracting and indirect jobs all fall short of plans. Officials say they are still analyzing the economic impact of the Ford decision.

The hemorrhaging may be just the beginning of Mexico's pain from Trump's vows to shake up trade and bring manufacturing jobs back north when he takes office on Jan. 20. [nL1N1ET0V9]

Ford ascribed its move to a decline in North American demand for small cars like the ones it planned to make in San Luis Potosi. But Trump had been lambasting Ford for its Mexico operations, months before he was elected president in November.

Trump upped the ante on Thursday, threatening to slap a "border tax" on Japanese automaker Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T> for cars it sells to the United States from a new plant in Mexico, fueling fears of an all-out offensive by his government on Mexican industry. [nL1N1EV1FV]

Mexico's government on Friday "categorically" rejected any attempt to use threats to influence investment decisions in Mexico, saying it wanted to boost the competitiveness of North America. It did not mention Trump or Toyota in its brief statement. [nL1N1EW1XF]

In a matter of days, Ford's retreat has turned the factory site into a barren plain bereft of its economic promise.

"It now looks like a cemetery," said Fernando Rosales, 28, a hydraulic hoses contractor preparing to abandon the site. "(There is) only death here, we are all leaving."

Ford's decision also puts the brakes on Detroit automakers' push to build small cars in Mexico to reduce labor costs, while using higher-paid U.S. workers for larger, more expensive vehicles.

Not far from the doomed Ford site, other major players from the global automotive industry are in the midst of multi-million dollar investments, including General Motors Co , which Trump has also repeatedly berated for investing in Mexico.

German carmaker BMW is assembling a $1 billion plant, and a few miles from the Ford site, Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co is busy building a $550 million tire facility.

The U.S. president-elect's broadsides against Mexico have shown how exposed companies in the supply chain are to the whims of U.S. automakers under pressure not to offshore production.

Shares in Kansas City Southern , one of the main railroad operators in Mexico, fell following news of the Ford cancellation and have lost 3.3 percent since Tuesday morning.

Between 40 and 50, mostly foreign-owned, suppliers were ready to come and supply the San Luis Potosi plant, said Sergio Resendez of real estate broker Colliers International.

"This was going to catapult us," Gustavo Puente, the state economy minister of San Luis Potosi, said of the plant Ford originally announced in April of last year. Ford told him the plan was off about an hour before it went public with the news, he said.

Around 12 to 14 of the suppliers had already invested money buying land or signed a contract with developers, said Resendez of Colliers, though Puente suggested the number was fewer.

"It's a very, very complicated hole," Resendez said. "The suppliers, depending on their level of advancement, will lose money. They had already made big investments."

'KICK IN THE TEETH'

At the Ford premises, shocked and dejected workers packed up construction materials and prepared to leave.

"This is a massive kick in the teeth," Rosalio Rocha, 52, a construction worker on the site from a nearby town said.

"It looks like he is going to keep going on about it," he added, referring to Trump.

Some of the ground at the 280-hectare site had already been leveled and the skeletons of two large, white buildings stood out against a rusty brown and green backdrop.

Workers said they had heard plans for an industrial park opposite the site for suppliers had also been suspended. The park's developers were not immediately available to comment.

The auto sector is at the heart of a Mexican industrial boom since the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) between it, the United States and Canada, a deal Trump has threatened to renegotiate in favor of the United States or scrap entirely.

"It hurts because we're partners in trade, culture, sports, we're partners in everything," said Puente, the San Luis Potosi economy minister. "It hurts because they - he - is pushing a policy that wants to break those ties."

About half of the foreign direct investment (FDI) to Mexico since the start of the century has come from the United States, where it sends around 80 percent of its goods exports.

Carmaking is no exception.

Mexico produced 3.22 million autos in the first 11 months of last year, and exported 2.55 million, local industry group AMIA said. Fully 77 percent of the exports went to the United States.

Some Mexican states have come to depend on autos almost entirely for growth. In San Luis Potosi, 15,000-17,000 new direct jobs are expected to be created in 2017, all in the auto sector, according to federal labor delegate Edgar Duron. The total does not include the Ford plant, which had been expected to create thousands of additional jobs in coming years.

The San Luis Potosi state government had already paid part of the 1 billion pesos ($47 million) it owed under a contract to support the Ford plant, Puente said, without specifying how much. The federal government said Ford would reimburse the sum.

Projects, both private and public, are underway to spend hundreds of millions of pesos to expand the city's airport and build a new bus line in expectation of a busier future.

But the real fear in Mexico is that, as Trump himself tweeted after the Ford decision, "This is just the beginning."

Outside the Goodyear plant in San Luis Potosi, 46-year-old Marcos Rodriguez, an engineer working on the facility, said that Mexico should assume that other sites are at risk.

"Here there's a lot of equipment inside, so I think it would be a little more difficult," he said. "(But) can they cancel it? I think they can."

FACTBOX-Trump tweets jolt shares of targeted companies - Reuters News

{{20170106T204422.668+0000}}FACTBOX-Trump tweets jolt shares of targeted companiesJan 6 (Reuters) - Donald Trump's threat to impose a fee on Toyota Motor in a tweet Thursday made the automaker the latest in a series of companies targeted by the U.S. president-elect. Some of the companies have seen volatile price spikes in their shares after the tweets.

Following is a list of companies targeted in Trump's tweets.

Toyota Motor Corp: Trump, who campaigned on promises to keep manufacturing business in the United States, tweeted that he would impose a fee if the Japanese automaker built its Corolla cars for the U.S. market in Mexico. [nL1N1EV1FV] Toyota's U.S.-listed shares <7203.T> fell 0.6 percent on Thursday and were down just 0.3 percent on Friday.

General Motors Co : Trump on Tuesday threatened a "big border tax" on GM for making its Chevy Cruze model in Mexico. GM's shares fell briefly in premarket trade following the tweets, but reversed course to finish the day up 6.5 percent. Upbeat sales data on Wednesday further buoyed the stock for the automaker's best two-day performance early November. The stock has given back some of the gains and is now up 4.4 percent since Tuesday.

Lockheed Martin Corp : Trump on Dec. 12 tweeted about the U.S. defense company's F-35 fighter jet program, calling it "out of control." Lockheed Martin shares dropped more than 3 percent in the following two sessions, the worst two-day performance for the stock in five weeks.

Lockheed's stock is up 0.4 percent since then, but has underperformed the broad S&P 500 index. It has outperformed the NYSE Arca Defense index <.DFII>, which has slipped 0.3 percent, over the same time frame.

Rexnord Corp : Trump on Dec. 2 tweeted over Rexnord's plans to move operations to Mexico and fire U.S. workers. Rexnord shares fell more than 1 percent after the tweet. The shares had dropped nearly 8 percent in the two sessions prior to the tweet after Rexnord announced a convertible offering; they are up 2.6 pct since the tweet.

Other companies Trump has targeted in his tweets include another top automaker, Ford Motor Co , and other defense-related and aerospace companies, United Technologies Corp. and Boeing Co .

Ford plant turns 'cemetery' as Trump wrenches Mexican autos - Reuters News

{{20170106T195506.331+0000}}Ford plant turns 'cemetery' as Trump wrenches Mexican autosBy Christine Murray

SAN LUIS POTOSI, Mexico, Jan 6 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co's abrupt move to scrap a planned $1.6 billion car plant in central Mexico has spooked a network of suppliers who bet on a growing customer base and dramatized the risk that Donald Trump's agenda poses to the country's broader economy.

Many auto parts makers had started to expand in anticipation of Ford's plant in the state of San Luis Potosi, where industry is "easily 70 percent" dependent on the auto sector, said Julian Eaves, managing director of Preferred Compounding de Mexico, a U.S.-owned maker of rubber compounds operating here.

"It's going to have a huge impact on the local community," said Eaves.

The loss to the economy, Eaves calculates, could run into the hundreds of millions of dollars, and maybe even into the billions, over the next five years, as manufacturing, contracting and indirect jobs all fall short of plans. Officials say they are still analyzing the economic impact of the Ford decision.

The hemorrhaging may be just the beginning of Mexico's pain from Trump's vows to shake up trade and bring manufacturing jobs back north when he takes office on Jan. 20. [nL1N1ET0V9]

Ford ascribed its move to a decline in North American demand for small cars like the ones it planned to make in San Luis Potosi. But Trump had been lambasting Ford for its Mexico operations, months before he was elected president in November.

Trump upped the ante on Thursday, threatening to slap a "border tax" on Japanese automaker Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T> for cars it sells to the United States from a new plant in Mexico, fueling fears of an all-out offensive by his government on Mexican industry. [nL1N1EV1FV]

"He's gonna keep on trying to do something, and that's the alarming part," Eaves said.

In a matter of days, Ford's retreat has turned the factory site into a barren plain bereft of its economic promise.

"It now looks like a cemetery," said Fernando Rosales, 28, a hydraulic hoses contractor preparing to abandon the site. "(There is) only death here, we are all leaving."

Ford's decision also puts the brakes on Detroit automakers' push to build small cars in Mexico to reduce labor costs, while using higher-paid U.S. workers for larger, more expensive vehicles.

Not far from the doomed Ford site, other major players from the global automotive industry are in the midst of multi-million dollar investments, including General Motors Co , which Trump has also repeatedly berated for investing in Mexico.

German carmaker BMW is assembling a $1 billion plant, and a few miles from the Ford site, Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co is busy building a $550 million tire facility.

The U.S. president-elect's broadsides against Mexico have shown how exposed companies in the supply chain are to the whims of U.S. automakers under pressure not to offshore production.

Shares in Kansas City Southern , one of the main railroad operators in Mexico, fell following news of the Ford cancellation and have lost 3.3 percent since Tuesday morning.

Between 40 and 50, mostly foreign-owned, suppliers were ready to come and supply the San Luis Potosi plant, said Sergio Resendez of real estate broker Colliers International.

"This was going to catapult us," Gustavo Puente, the state economy minister of San Luis Potosi, said of the plant Ford originally announced in April of last year. Ford told him the plan was off about an hour before it went public with the news, he said.

Around 12 to 14 of the suppliers had already invested money buying land or signed a contract with developers, said Resendez of Colliers, though Puente suggested the number was fewer.

"It's a very, very complicated hole," Resendez said. "The suppliers, depending on their level of advancement, will lose money. They had already made big investments."

'KICK IN THE TEETH'

At the Ford premises, shocked and dejected workers packed up construction materials and prepared to leave.

"This is a massive kick in the teeth," Rosalio Rocha, 52, a construction worker on the site from a nearby town said.

"It looks like he is going to keep going on about it," he added, referring to Trump.

Some of the ground at the 280-hectare site had already been leveled and the skeletons of two large, white buildings stood out against a rusty brown and green backdrop.

Workers said they had heard plans for an industrial park opposite the site for suppliers had also been suspended. The park's developers were not immediately available to comment.

The auto sector is at the heart of a Mexican industrial boom since the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) between it, the United States and Canada, a deal Trump has threatened to renegotiate in favor of the United States or scrap entirely.

"It hurts because we're partners in trade, culture, sports, we're partners in everything," said Puente, the San Luis Potosi economy minister. "It hurts because they - he - is pushing a policy that wants to break those ties."

About half of the foreign direct investment (FDI) to Mexico since the start of the century has come from the United States, where it sends around 80 percent of its goods exports.

Carmaking is no exception.

Mexico produced 3.22 million autos in the first 11 months of last year, and exported 2.55 million, local industry group AMIA said. Fully 77 percent of the exports went to the United States.

Some Mexican states have come to depend on autos almost entirely for growth. In San Luis Potosi, 15,000-17,000 new direct jobs are expected to be created in 2017, all in the auto sector, according to federal labor delegate Edgar Duron. The total does not include the Ford plant, which had been expected to create thousands of additional jobs in coming years.

The San Luis Potosi state government had already paid part of the 1 billion pesos ($47 million) it owed under a contract to support the Ford plant, Puente said, without specifying how much. The federal government said Ford would reimburse the sum.

Projects, both private and public, are underway to spend hundreds of millions of pesos to expand the city's airport and build a new bus line in expectation of a busier future.

But the real fear in Mexico is that, as Trump himself tweeted after the Ford decision, "This is just the beginning."

Outside the Goodyear plant in San Luis Potosi, 46-year-old Marcos Rodriguez, an engineer working on the facility, said that Mexico should assume that other sites are at risk.

BREAKINGVIEWS-Carmakers rattled by Backseat-Driver-in-Chief - Reuters Breakingviews

{{20170106T191154.952+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-Carmakers rattled by Backseat-Driver-in-Chief(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.)

By Antony Currie

NEW YORK, Jan 6 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Carmakers are getting rattled by the Backseat-Driver-in-Chief. President-elect Donald Trump's attacks on General Motors and Toyota <6201.T> over imports have soured the industry's mood ahead of its big annual Detroit jamboree next week. They also have revived fears of rising costs just as a slowing market and autonomous driving jolt financial prospects.

By some metrics, automakers are humming along nicely. U.S. sales hit a record high of 17.55 million last year. And the share prices of most of the major manufacturers have increased by as much as a fifth since Nov. 7, the day before American voters picked Trump to steer the country.

The probability of lower U.S. corporate tax rates has helped power the market improvement. Revenue at Ford Motor , General Motors and Fiat Chrysler is expected to be virtually flat between now and 2019, according to estimates culled by Thomson Reuters. Only Honda <7267.T>, Nissan <7201.T> and Renault might grow the top line at double-digit rates.

Even that may be optimistic, however. In the United States, the most profitable market, car resale values have been falling. Rising interest rates will make borrowing more expensive. And manufacturers already have been offering, at 12.2 percent of the average purchase price, the highest incentives since the financial crisis to entice customers, according to Barclays.

Virtually all carmakers are jacking up their R&D spending to make vehicles more fuel efficient, connected and autonomous. The industry is rife with tech-related investments, partnerships and joint ventures. There's little to show for the capital allocation so far. The first pilot program for driverless taxis, for example, is run in Pittsburgh by ride-hailing upstart Uber using Volvos.

While Trump's Twitterventions are unsettling, they may also help a bit. Scrapping a new plant in Mexico allows Ford not just to appease the next commander-in-chief but also its shareholders. The decision should cut costs allocated to build the Focus, a low-margin small car whose sales declined almost 17 percent last year.

The bigger hazard would be tariffs and tax breaks imposed by Trump and the Republican-led Congress, which render much of the industry's Mexico operations unprofitable. Higher costs and damaged sales could require the movement of some production back north of the border. The last thing the auto industry needs is another big obstacle in the road.

UPDATE 1-General Motors moving forward on sale of Indian car plant to China's SAIC - Reuters News

{{20170106T152444.203+0000}}UPDATE 1-General Motors moving forward on sale of Indian car plant to China's SAIC(Adds GM comment, details, background)

By Sudarshan Varadhan and Aditi Shah

NEW DELHI, Jan 6 (Reuters) - A subsidiary of China's top carmaker SAIC Motor Corp <600104.SS> plans to acquire certain General Motors manufacturing assets in India, a filing with the country's competition watchdog showed on Friday.

The assets, which could give the Chinese automaker a toehold in the Indian car market, will be acquired via an Indian subsidiary of SAIC that is yet to be incorporated, according to the filing with the Competition Commission of India.

As part of a side deal, General Motors also plans to buy out SAIC's 9.2 percent stake in SAIC General Motors Investment - a joint venture it formed with the Chinese automaker in 2009 to expand its presence in emerging markets like India, a separate filing showed.

GM, in an emailed response to a Reuters query following the filing, said discussions with SAIC on the sale of Halol - its plant in the Western state of Gujarat - were progressing well and that the two parties were working to secure necessary approvals.

"We'll share any progress at the appropriate time," GM said.

It was not immediately clear whether the two deals are being structured as some sort of asset swap, or whether there would be payments made by both parties for the assets. A spokeswoman for SAIC declined to comment.

Sources familiar with the matter had told Reuters last April that the Chinese carmaker was in discussions to buy GM's Gujarat plant and had been evaluating car models to launch in India. [nL3N16U43O]

GM said in 2015 that it planned to stop production at one of its two plants in India by mid-2016 and consolidate operations at one location. The Detroit carmaker's Halol plant can manufacture up to 110,000 vehicles a year. GM also runs a plant in Talegaon in the western state of Maharashtra that has a capacity of about 170,000 vehicles a year.

Several foreign carmakers like GM, Volkswagen AG and Ford Motor have struggled to ramp up sales in India, expected to be the world's third-largest car market by 2020, and are now pushing exports from the country to utilize idle manufacturing capacity.

Sagging sales and a regulatory crackdown on diesel-powered vehicles had forced GM to redraw its plans in India.[nL4N1AA0FR]

In July, GM said it was re-evaluating a planned $1 billion investment in India and had put on hold moves to bring a new car platform to the country that would have helped it better compete against market leader Maruti Suzuki .

Between April and November, GM's India sales fell 19 percent to 17,868 vehicles, while total passenger vehicle sales in India rose 10 percent over the same period, industry data showed.

UPDATE 1-China sales vroom in 2016 for global automakers; dull 2017 looms - Reuters News

{{20170106T084827.498+0000}}UPDATE 1-China sales vroom in 2016 for global automakers; dull 2017 looms(Adds 2017 forecasts, comments, other details)

* Honda leads with fastest growth, +24 pct in 2016

* Toyota China sales +8.2 pct, predicts 2017 sales almost flat

* Ford 2016 China sales +11.9 pct; Nissan +8.4 pct

* China auto market to slow in 2017 as tax cut tapered

By Jake Spring and Norihiko Shirouzu

BEIJING, Jan 6 (Reuters) - Global automakers reported a surge in China sales last year as consumers rushed to take advantage of a tax cut on small-engine cars, but cautioned 2017 would be tougher for the industry as the incentive is rolled back and the broader economy slows.

Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T>, Ford Motor Co and Nissan Motor Co Ltd <7201.T> on Friday each reported sales growth of 8 percent or better for 2016, although Honda Motor Co Ltd <7267.T> led the pack with a 24 percent growth. [nL4N1EU26S]

Toyota, which reported an 8.2 percent rise in China sales last year, sees growth slowing in 2017 as slightly higher taxes keep some buyers away from the world's biggest auto market. It expects to sell at least 1.2 million vehicles, steady from 2016.

"We are not being strictly volume focused. We would like to do so (increase volumes) while boosting car quality and keep our customer base satisfied with our products and service," a Beijing-based Toyota spokesman told Reuters.

While Honda expects to sell more vehicles in China this year, it forecast a significantly slower growth rate of 7.4 percent, roughly in line with a slowing economy. [nL4N1EE1MX]

Demand for cars in China got a shot in the arm in 2016 ahead of a planned expiry of lower taxes at year-end. Sales will come under pressure this year, but not fall sharply, given a decision to slowly roll back the incentive instead of abruptly ending it.

The purchase tax on cars with engines of 1.6 litres or smaller in China, at 5 percent now, will rise to 7.5 percent this year before returning to 10 percent in 2018. [nL4N1EV24N]

Overall passenger car sales in China could have dropped 2 percent this year had the tax cut expired on Dec. 31, but are now expected to grow by 3-5 percent, consultancy Automotive Foresight said.

Analysts, however, cautioned that car sales could fall in the first quarter as consumers fearing the policy would end in 2016 moved ahead their purchases instead of waiting until 2017.

"In late 2016 we definitely saw pull forward effects in engines below 1.6 litre. This will effect the Q1 negatively," a sales executive at a major foreign automaker told Reuters.

HONDA SPEEDS AHEAD

Honda posted the biggest growth in China sales last year among automakers reporting Friday, powered by a steady stream of new models, mainly in the hot sport-utility vehicle segment.

Vehicle sales by Honda rose to 1.25 million in 2016, while Ford reported a growth of 11.9 percent to 1.24 million vehicles.

But with premium Lincoln brand car sales, which are not consistently included in monthly data releases, Ford's sales totalled 1.27 million, giving it an edge over Toyota and Honda.

All three, however, continued to lag Nissan Motor Co Ltd <7201.T> in China sales. Nissan's sales grew 8.4 percent to 1.35 million vehicles in the country last year.

General Motors Co and Volkswagen continue to be the market leaders in China. On Thursday, GM and its joint venture partners reported sales of 3.87 million vehicles in China for 2016, up 7.1 percent. [nL4N1EV24N]

The full-year figures come in spite of sales slipping for several brands in the final month, with GM, Honda and Toyota all reporting a year-on-year drop for December with news China was not completely ending its tax incentive making its impact felt.

Sales surge for global carmakers in China, Honda overtakes rivals - Reuters News

{{20170106T062307.597+0000}}Sales surge for global carmakers in China, Honda overtakes rivalsBy Jake Spring

BEIJING, Jan 6 (Reuters) - Sales surged for global automakers in China in 2016 as consumers rushed to buy cars to make the most of a tax incentive, with Honda Motor Co Ltd <7267.T> seeing a particularly brisk pace of business ahead of Ford and Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T>.

Toyota has traditionally led Honda in China - the world's largest auto market - but last year Honda sped past with a year-on-year sales growth of 24 percent to 1.25 million vehicles, helped by a steady stream of fresh models particularly in the hot sport-utility vehicle segment.

Toyota reported an 8.2 percent rise in 2016 sales. The automaker expects to sell at least 1.2 million vehicles this year, roughly flat with 2016.

Ford reported a growth in China sales of 11.9 percent to 1.24 million vehicles in 2016, not including sales of its premium Lincoln brand, according to a Reuters calculation.

All three companies, however, continued to lag sales by Nissan <7201.T> in China. Nissan's sales grew 8.4 percent to 1.35 million vehicles in the country last year.

Earlier this week, General Motors Co and its joint venture partners reported sales of 3.87 million vehicles in China for 2016, up 7.1 percent, cementing the country's position as the U.S. automaker's top market for a fifth consecutive year.

Demand for cars in the Asian country got a shot in the arm last year from China's move to cut taxes on small-engine cars.

The tax incentive, which halved the purchase tax on cars with engines of 1.6 litres or smaller to 5 percent, is now being rolled back. The tax will rise to 7.5 percent this year before returning to 10 percent in 2018 - a move analysts say will prevent a steep drop in sales growth. [nL4N1EV24N]

UPDATE 3-Trump hits Toyota in latest broadside against carmakers and Mexico - Reuters News

{{20170105T231133.334+0000}}UPDATE 3-Trump hits Toyota in latest broadside against carmakers and Mexico(Adds attempt to reach Trump spokeswoman, more automaker investments, closing stock price)

By David Shepardson

WASHINGTON, Jan 5 (Reuters) - U.S. President-elect Donald Trump targeted Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T> on Thursday, threatening to impose a hefty fee on the world's largest automaker if it builds its Corolla cars for the U.S. market at a plant in Mexico.

"Toyota Motor said will build a new plant in Baja, Mexico, to build Corolla cars for U.S. NO WAY! Build plant in U.S. or pay big border tax," Trump said in a post on Twitter.

It was Trump's latest broadside against automakers building cars in Mexico and first against a foreign automaker. The president-elect's attacks on investments by companies in Mexico have cast a shadow over cross-border production networks central to more than $583 billion a year in trade between the two countries.

The value of the Mexican peso has skidded amid fears that Trump's policies would harm Latin America's second-biggest economy -- and declined Thursday after Trump's tweet. [nL1N1EV0ML]

Toyota, which announced plans to build a new Mexican facility in Guanajuato in April 2015, said it would not take away from U.S. employment.

"Toyota looks forward to collaborating with the Trump administration to serve in the best interests of consumers and the automotive industry," Toyota spokesman Scott Vazin said.

Trump's tweet confuses Toyota's existing Baja plant with the planned $1 billion plant in Guanajuato, where construction got under way in November. A Trump spokeswoman did not return a request seeking additional comment.

Baja produces around 100,000 pickup trucks and truck beds annually. The Guanajuato plant will build Corollas and have an annual capacity of 200,000 when it comes online in 2019, shifting production of the small car from Canada.

The Japanese automaker's American Depositary Receipts fell after Trump's tweet and closed down 0.6 percent at $120.44 on the New York Stock Exchange.

Toyota President Akio Toyoda said in Japan on Thursday that the automaker has no immediate plans to curb production in Mexico, preferring to wait until after Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration before deciding whether to make any changes.

"We will consider our option as we see what policies the incoming president adopts," Toyoda said at an industry gathering in Tokyo on Thursday before Trump's tweet, when asked whether his company was considering any changes to a production plant the automaker was building in Mexico.

Automakers in the United States have been slammed by Trump for building cars in lower-cost factories south of the border, which he said costs American jobs. Pressure to curb that production intensified this week after Ford Motor Co scrapped plans to build a $1.6 billion assembly plant in Mexico after Trump harshly criticized the investment. [nL1N1ET0V9]

Ford, however, still plans to shift production of small cars to Mexico from Michigan, even as it uses $700 million from the planned Mexico investment to expand its operations in Flat Rock, Michigan, and add 700 jobs.

During the campaign, Trump criticized barriers to U.S. auto exports to Japan and said the U.S. government did not do enough to open the market to more American-made vehicles.

"Until you open your markets, you're not selling any more cars over here," Trump said of Japan in an August 2015 interview with the Detroit News. "That's going to force people to build in the United States."

Toyota has extensive U.S. investments, operates 10 U.S. plants in eight states and builds more than 1.3 million vehicles in the United States annually.

Between 1994 and 2013, U.S. auto factory jobs dropped by a third while jobs in Mexico rose almost five-fold over the same period as lower-wage production boomed.

Mexico now accounts for 20 percent of all vehicle production in North America and has attracted more than $24 billion in auto investment since 2010, according to the Ann Arbor, Michigan-based, Center for Automotive Research.

Based on current investment plans, Mexico's auto production capacity will grow by another 50 percent over the next five years, according to the center, which draws funding from the auto industry.

It said Toyota imported fewer vehicles from Mexico than any other major automaker building cars there last year. Detroit's Big Three automakers collectively exported more than 1.1 million vehicles to the United States from Mexico in 2016, while Toyota sent about 47,000 Mexican-made vehicles to the United States.

Trump has also said General Motors Co could become subject to tariffs on Mexico-made cars for the U.S. market, and that he would like to renegotiate terms of the North American Free Trade Agreement signed with Canada and Mexico, or scrap it altogether.

Trump criticized GM for importing Mexican-made versions of the Chevrolet Cruze, even as the automaker is laying off 1,200 workers in Ohio this month who assemble the car.

UPDATE 1-France's far-right FN scrambles to raise cash for election battle - Reuters News

{{20170105T170459.608+0000}}UPDATE 1-France's far-right FN scrambles to raise cash for election battle(Adds judicial investigation)

By Simon Carraud and Ingrid Melander

PARIS, Jan 5 (Reuters) - France's far-right National Front is struggling to raise millions of euros it needs to fund its presidential election campaign, but leader Marine Le Pen vowed: "We will find one bank somewhere in the world that is willing to lend us that money."

Le Pen - who has been tipped to make it through to the second-round runoff in May - accused French banks of playing politics by refusing to lend money to her party, suggesting it was being marginalised because of its far-right policies.

The National Front (FN) said in December it needed to raise 27 million euros ($28 million) to fund its campaigning for the presidential and parliamentary elections in April-June. [nL5N1EH3UR]

It has borrowed about 6 million euros from a political fundraising association headed by Le Pen's estranged father and FN founder Jean-Marie - an ironic twist given she threw him out of the party in 2015.

"We have additional funding to find. We'll find it," Le Pen told reporters on Wednesday. "It's half (of what we need), but we'll find it," she said, without specifying how much of the 27 millions euros the party had raised so far.

"We'll end up finding it. We will find one bank somewhere in the world that is willing to lend us that money," she said.

Separately, Russia has started legal proceedings to recover a 9-million-euro loan from the FN after the Moscow-based bank from which the party borrowed the money in 2014 had its operating licence revoked because it held insufficient capital. The impact this will have on the party's finances is unclear.

Asked by journalists if her party was knocking on Russian banks' doors again to ease its funding squeeze, Le Pen said: "I'm looking everywhere, including in the United States, including in Britain, absolutely everywhere."

There is a lot at stake for Le Pen, who has sought to moderate the image of her anti-immigration and eurosceptic party to broaden its appeal, and has the support of around a quarter of French voters according to opinion polls.

Le Pen said that, unlike mainstream parties, the FN had not managed to secure any loans from French banks. "French banks are playing a political role," she said.

The French Banking Federation declined to comment.

DONATIONS CAP

Political parties often look to bank loans to bolster their war chests as under French law donations are capped at 7,500 euros per person, per year, and cannot come from companies or foreigners.

The financial risk for banks is limited, since candidates who gather more than 5 percent of the votes get almost half of their campaign spending reimbursed by the state.

Le Pen's party has struck a deal with her father for his funding association Cotelec to lend it about 6 million euros in tranches before the presidential election in April-May, her campaign director David Rachline told Reuters in December.

"The deal (on the loan) was concluded months ago," Rachline said, without giving further details.

Jean-Marie Le Pen set up Cotelec in 1988, when he was FN leader, to help finance the party's campaigns.

The split between Le Pen senior and his daughter, who took the helm of the party in 2011, ended up with the father being kicked out of the party after he described the Holocaust as "a detail" of Second World War history.

As for the older loan, Russia's state Deposit Insurance Agency (DIA) told the RNS news agency in December it had acquired the right to recover the defunct First Czech Russian Bank's assets.

"Before the bank's operating license was revoked, the right to claim under the credit agreement with the French National Front party was ceded to a third party. Currently, this transaction is being disputed in court," Russia's RNS quoted the DIA as saying.

Reuters could not reach the DIA for comment.

FN Treasurer Wallerand de Saint-Just said he was not concerned about the case and added that he was unclear about the details.

Separately, the FN is facing a judicial investigation that was opened by the Paris prosecutor in December over the employment of assistants to the party's lawmakers in the European Parliament, a judicial source said on Thursday.

The inquiry was opened on suspicion of breach of trust, fraud and concealed employment, the source said. It followed a complaint by the European Parliament which suspected the assistants were working for the party as a whole rather than solely for the lawmakers.

De Saint-Just denied any wrongdoing by the FN.

UPDATE 1-Political doubt dampens recovery hopes of Brazil auto sector - Reuters News

{{20170105T165513.845+0000}}UPDATE 1-Political doubt dampens recovery hopes of Brazil auto sector(Adds details, forecasts)

By Alberto Alerigi

SAO PAULO, Jan 5 (Reuters) - Brazil's auto sector has revised downwards its expectations for a rebound in vehicle sales this year to just 4 percent from the high single digits, the Anfavea automakers association said on Thursday, with political uncertainty and a recession still weighing on a market that saw sales slump 20 percent last year.

Anfavea President Antonio Megale said that while production of vehicles in Brazil would jump by 11.9 percent this year to 2.4 million units, sales of new vehicles would only creep up 4 percent to 2.13 million units.

Exports are forecast to climb 7 percent this year to 558,000 units, he said, helped by stronger sales to Colombia, Chile and Ecuador. A trade deal with Argentina helped boost exports last year by 25 percent.

"We had a forecast for a much stronger number (for sales) but we have reduced it to 4 percent because of the economic situation and, principally, because of the political environment that we are facing," Megale told a news conference.

Megale had said late last year that he expected a sales increase for the industry as a whole this year in the high single digits.

Yet corruption allegations implicating Brazilian President Michel Temer and his party are casting doubt on his ability to remain in office and causing cracks in his coalition, amid growing calls for early elections.

That could destabilize a return to economic growth expected this year and derail Temer's agenda of restoring fiscal discipline, which has been welcomed by business leaders and foreign investors. [nL1N1EB0O9]

The tepid rebound in auto sales this year comes after a painful 2016 as Brazil's worst recession in more than a century slashed demand for new vehicles.

Anfavea said sales of newly produced cars in Brazil fell by 20.2 percent in 2016 to 2.05 million units, while production slumped 11.2 percent.

In a sign of recovery, vehicle sales in December rose by 14.7 percent month on month, the association said.

The recovery in sales is unlikely to spell a major return to hiring by the sector, Megale said, as the industry as a whole has about 50 percent idle capacity.

Anfavea's more modest growth forecast for this year was in line with a prediction by the car dealership association Fenabrave that sales would grow 2.3 percent in 2017.

TOKYO, Jan 5 (Reuters) - The presidents of Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T> and Honda Motor Co Ltd <7267.T> said they have no immediate plans to curb production in Mexico, preferring to wait until after Donald Trump's inauguration as U.S. President this month before deciding whether to make any changes.

Automakers in the U.S. have been slammed by Trump for building cars in lower-cost factories south of the border, which he said costs American jobs. Pressure to curb that production intensified this week after Ford Motor Co scrapped plans to build a $1.6 billion assembly plant in Mexico after Trump harshly criticized the investment. [nL1N1ET0V9]

"We will consider our option as we see what policies the incoming president adopts," Toyota President Akio Toyoda said on Thursday at an industry gathering in Tokyo, when asked whether his company was considering any changes to a production plant the automaker is building in Mexico.

"We produce cars in Mexico for markets including North America and Europe and we have no immediate plan to change this," Honda's president and chief executive officer, Takahiro Hachigo, said at the event to mark the New Year.

Trump has also said General Motors Co could become subject to tariffs on Mexico-made cars for the U.S. market, and that he would like to renegotiate terms of the North American Free Trade Agreement signed with Canada and Mexico.

Toyota, Honda and Nissan Motor Co Ltd <7201.T>, Japan's top three automakers, have production facilities both in the United States and in Mexico, while Toyota and Honda also operate plants in Canada. Much of the vehicles produced in Mexico and Canada and exported to the United States - the single biggest market for Japanese automakers.

Toyota produces a total of around 100,000 pick-up trucks and truck beds each year at its plant in the state of Baja California, and plans to raise output to around 160,000 units by 2018. It is also building a plant in Guanajuato city which will have an annual capacity of 200,000 when it comes online in 2019.

Honda has two auto plants in Mexico, one in Celaya city and the other in Guadalajara city that together build around 260,000 cars and 100,000 motorcycles a year.

In the year ended March, Nissan produced around 800,000 vehicles at its three plants in Mexico, nearly half of which were sold in the United States.

UK new car sales hit record high in 2016 but signs of slowdown ahead - SMMT  - Reuters News

{{20170105T091650.013+0000}}UK new car sales hit record high in 2016 but signs of slowdown ahead - SMMT LONDON, Jan 5 (Reuters) - British new car registrations hit a record 2.69 million units in 2016 despite concerns from some analysts that June's Brexit vote would dent sales but demand will fall by around 5 percent this year, a car industry body said on Thursday.

Full-year sales rose 2.3 percent in 2016 but year-on-year registrations fell in December by 1.1 percent, only the third annual drop in nearly five years, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said.

Demand from individual consumers has fallen in every month since April with overall growth supported by strong rises in business demand.

However, in December fleet demand fell for the first time in nearly a year, suggesting that it will be difficult to match last year's performance in 2017.

Ford expands Alexa use, heating up auto personal assistant battle - Reuters News

{{20170105T040014.267+0000}}Ford expands Alexa use, heating up auto personal assistant battleBy Alexandria Sage

LAS VEGAS, Jan 4 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co is expanding the use of Amazon.com Inc's Alexa personal assistant in its vehicles to allow drivers to talk to their cars - demanding anything from a nearby cheeseburger to a weather forecast - marking a leap by the Detroit automaker to incorporate a technology initially targeted for home use.

The expanding alliance between Ford and Amazon, announced on Wednesday at the CES tech show in Las Vegas, underscores the importance to both automakers and internet commerce companies of connecting consumers on the move to a richer array of digital services.

Don Butler, Ford's executive director of connected vehicle and services, told Reuters the technology represented the "deepest integration of any OEM (carmaker) inside a vehicle with Alexa."

The two companies are talking about how to take the Alexa partnership further, according to Butler. "Digital assistant is one tool that is increasingly prevalent in the industry," he said.

Rival General Motors Co plans to roll out IBM's Watson artificial intelligence software in its OnStar system early next year in order to market services to drivers in their cars [nL1N1CV2HI].

Similarly, Daimler's Mercedes-Benz will use Alphabet Inc's Google Assistant , a rival product, to let car owners interact with their vehicles from home via Google Home.

Ford's move follows its October announcement that it would use Alexa in three of its vehicle models by the end of 2016 to allow drivers to communicate with their smart home devices, such as heaters, lights or security systems. [nL2N1C52DJ]

Automotive personal assistants are being studied by every major automaker, according to Gartner research director Michael Ramsey, who said: "There's a lot of vetting going on."

One company that stands to benefit is Nuance Communications Inc . The supplier to Ford, GM and other carmakers provides natural language speech command technology to allow drivers to speak more or less conversationally to digital assistants.

Nineteen percent of the 160 million cars that use Nuance's technology over the past 15 years have come out just in the past year, said Fatima Vital, Nuance's senior director of marketing automotive.

One major decision auto companies must make is whether to give consumers a version of the smartphone systems they already use - Apple Inc's CarPlay or Google's Android Auto - or a third option. By using their own systems, carmakers can retain full control of valuable data that otherwise could be captured by Apple and Google from vehicles.

SHARED APP PLATFORM Currently, personal assistants are enabled using either phones as their mode of connectivity, such as at Ford, or through modems built directly into vehicles, as GM and the German automakers have done.

Ford plans to have 10 million vehicles in North America and 20 million globally equipped with embedded modems by 2020.

Ford cars will talk with Alexa through a new mobile app connected to SmartDeviceLink, an open-source platform that allows developers to create apps compatible with all automakers within the system, avoiding the need to adapt them to the specifications of each carmaker individually.

Carmakers and their suppliers who have joined Ford in the SmartDeviceLink ecosystem, announced Wednesday, are Toyota <7203.T>, Peugeot , Mazda <7261.T>, Suzuki <7269.T>, Elektrobit, Luxoft and Xevo.

{{20170105T010954.476+0000}}EXCLUSIVE-Amazon, Forever 21 vying for bankrupt American Apparel -sources(Adds graphic, condition of company at Charney's firing)

By Jessica DiNapoli and Lauren Hirsch

Jan 4 (Reuters) - Online retailer Amazon.com Inc and teen apparel store chain Forever 21 Inc are among the companies weighing offers to acquire bankrupt American Apparel LLC, people familiar with the talks said on Wednesday.

The bankruptcy auction of Los Angeles-based American Apparel, which made its branding theme "Made in the U.S.A", will determine the future of a major clothing manufacturing plant in California, one of the most expensive U.S. states in terms of labor costs.

Keeping jobs in the United States has become a hot button political issue since the presidential election. Ford Motor Co on Tuesday reversed plans for a $1.6 billion factory in Mexico and said it would add 700 jobs in Michigan after receiving criticism from President-elect Donald Trump. [nL1N1ET0OD]

See graphic here: (http://tmsnrt.rs/2gTjMhS)

Amazon and Forever 21, as well as California-based apparel maker Next Level Apparel and brand licensor Authentic Brands Group LLC, are in talks with American Apparel and its financial advisers about submitting offers ahead of a deadline on Friday, the people said.

Any successful offer would have to top a $66 million stalking horse bid by Canadian apparel maker Gildan Activewear Inc , which American Apparel agreed to when it filed for bankruptcy in November.

Gildan's offer included an option to keep American Apparel's manufacturing plants in southern California, which employ about 3,500 workers, making American Apparel one of the biggest garment makers in the United States.

But Gildan plans to preserve only some of the California production should its bid prevail, the sources said. Many of Gildan's production facilities are in low-cost countries.

An outcome in the auction is expected next week, the sources said, asking not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential.

American Apparel declined to comment. Amazon, Forever 21, Next Level Apparel and Authentic Brands did not respond to requests for comment.

A Gildan spokesman said in an email on Wednesday that it is putting together all the necessary information from its due diligence to best position itself in the auction.

Amazon's acquisition of American Apparel would be a major push for the e-commerce company into branded fashion and apparel. The Seattle-based company began to launch private label brands last year.

Forever 21, founded by Korean-American Do Won Chang, is known for its low retail prices, helped by lower labor costs abroad. American Apparel's first bankruptcy in 2015 was due in part to its relatively high labor costs.

"SWEATSHOP-FREE"

American Apparel went into bankruptcy for the second time last November with about $177 million in debt. Former Chief Executive Dov Charney founded the company in the late 1990s, when most garment-making was moving offshore.

For years this contrarian strategy worked. American Apparel's "sweatshop-free" label was a hit with young people, helping make the brand a part of popular culture.

Part of American Apparel's name recognition also stemmed from Charney himself, who was outspoken on immigration and fair wage issues, but was plagued by sexual harassment claims, which he has denied. The company was also famous for its sexually charged advertising.

A 2009 run-in with Immigration and Customs Enforcement over the legal employment status of 1,800 employees sent American Apparel on a downward trajectory, according to court documents from the company's 2015 bankruptcy.

American Apparel had to fire these employees, more than a quarter of its manufacturing workforce. The layoffs caused production delays and a 90 percent year-on-year drop in profits in 2009, according to the documents.

Charney was ousted in 2014, and the company's finances deteriorated further, plus it struggled with an unsustainable debt load. It filed for bankruptcy in October 2015, and emerged in February 2016, only to seek bankruptcy protection once again in November 2016.

American Apparel has notified its workers that they could be losing their jobs as early as this month.

Gildan makes most of its garments offshore, with close to 90 percent of its 42,000 employees in low-cost Caribbean and Central American countries. In California, the minimum wage is scheduled to rise to $15 per hour in 2022 for firms with 26 employees or more.

Gildan has yarn-spinning and distribution centers in cheaper parts of the United States, including North Carolina and Georgia. Gildan's bid for American Apparel does not include the retail chain's approximately 110 stores.

Australia new vehicle sales hit a record for 2016-VFACTS - Reuters News

{{20170105T010000.966+0000}}Australia new vehicle sales hit a record for 2016-VFACTSSYDNEY, Jan 5 (Reuters) - Australia boasted another record year of new vehicle sales in 2016 with the market showing a distinct shift in preference to pick up trucks and sport utility vehicles, while all the growth was driven by business demand.

The Australian Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries' VFACTS report out on Thursday showed 1.178 million vehicles were sold last year, 2 percent higher than in 2015.

"Calendar year 2016 marks the seventh year in a row that the Australian new car market has topped 1 million sales, and this result posts the industry's third record in four years," said FCAI chief executive, Tony Weber.

Light commercial vehicles took 18.5 percent of the market in 2016, up from 17.2 percent the year before, a bullish sign for business investment.

Indeed, sales to businesses increased by 13 percent over the year, while rental sales rose 6 percent. In contrast, private sales fell by 5.8 percent and government sales by 1.4 percent.

Weber noted Toyota's Hilux topped the sales charts over the year, the first time a pickup truck won that honour.

For December alone, sales amounted to 98,763 vehicles a dip of 0.9 percent on December 2015. Sales of light commercial vehicles jumped 8.5 percent compared to December 2015, while passenger vehicles and SUVs slipped.

Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T> retained first place on the sales ladder for both December and the year. It took 17.8 percent for 2016, unchanged from the previous year.

Mazda Motor Corp <7261.T> held second spot for the year with 10 percent of the market, pipping Hyundai Motor at 8.6 percent.

The Holden unit of General Motors saw its share slip almost a full percentage point to 8.0 percent, while Ford held 6.9 percent of the market.

UPDATE 2-Canada auto sales hit new highs in 2016 on pickups, SUVs: analysts - Reuters News

{{20170104T233937.222+0000}}UPDATE 2-Canada auto sales hit new highs in 2016 on pickups, SUVs: analysts(Adds General Motors sales, commentary from analysts)

By Allison Lampert

MONTREAL, Jan 4 (Reuters) - Canadian auto sales hit record highs in 2016 because of consumer demand for pickups and SUVs, despite ending the year on a weaker note that could continue this year, analysts said on Wednesday, citing automakers' data.

Automakers sold around 1.95 million units in Canada last year, up about 3 percent from another record year, 2015, auto analyst Dennis DesRosiers and Scotiabank Senior Economist Carlos Gomes wrote in notes to clients on Wednesday afternoon.

December sales in Canada declined around 3 percent on an annual basis because of weaker demand for cars, they wrote.

But after three years of increasing Canadian auto sales, Gomes does not expect another record in 2017 as manufacturers raise prices due to the comparative weakness of the Canadian dollar, which closed today at $1.3308, or 75.14 U.S. cents. [nL1N1EU1PK]

"Purchases have consistently climbed to new annual records since 2013, but are likely to trend lower over the coming year, pressured by some deterioration in vehicle affordability," Gomes wrote.

Ford Motor Co , the top seller in Canada, said 2016 was its best year for Canadian sales since 1989, largely because of demand for its F-Series pickups. The automaker said in a statement it sold 304,618 vehicles in Canada in 2016, up 9.4 percent in 2015.

General Motors Co delivered 267,341 vehicles in 2016, up 1.5 percent from the previous year, while Fiat Chrysler Automobiles reported a 4 percent decline in sales last year from 2015.

Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T> said its Canadian sales rose 4.2 percent in 2016 to 217,792 vehicles, driven by higher sales of trucks, along with luxury and hybrid cars.

Analysts had said they expected auto manufacturers overall would set another Canadian market record in 2016, with sales rising to around 1.96 million vehicles from 1.90 million units in 2015.

In December, Canadian auto sales declined 2.6 percent, on an annual basis, to 125,600 units, DesRosiers wrote.

"December sales have been on a downward trend in recent years and it was no different in 2016," he wrote.

In the United States, sales of new cars and trucks likely set new records for December and the full year, automakers said on Wednesday, and investors bid up shares in the sector as strong consumer confidence and stable fuel prices bolstered the industry's outlook. [nL1N1EU0KF]

UPDATE 4-U.S. December auto sales surprisingly strong, 2016 sets new high - Reuters News

{{20170104T225108.018+0000}}UPDATE 4-U.S. December auto sales surprisingly strong, 2016 sets new high(Adds December sales results for GM, Ford and Toyota)

By Bernie Woodall

DETROIT, Jan 4 (Reuters) - U.S. sales of new cars and trucks hit a record high in 2016, automakers said on Wednesday, and investors bid up shares in the sector as strong consumer confidence and relatively low fuel prices bolstered the industry's outlook.

Shares of General Motors Co rose 5.5 percent and Ford Motor Co <7203.T>, to predict that this year's sales will be near 2016's record levels.

U.S. consumer confidence reached levels not seen in 15 years in December. [nL1N1EM0J8] Auto sales are an early indicator of consumer spending, and account for about a fifth of U.S. retail spending.

GM's December sales rose 10 percent, Ford was up 0.3 percent and Toyota increased 2 percent. All three automakers' results, lifted by strong demand for pickup trucks and SUVs, beat Wall Street expectations.

Ford said it sold 87,512 F-Series pickups in December, the lineup's best overall sales month in 11 years. The F-series was the best-selling model line in the United States last year, for the 40th year in a row.

Rogue, a compact SUV from Nissan Motor Co, <7201.T> in December was the fourth best-selling model in the U.S. market and showed a sales increase of 53 percent from a year earlier.

Pickups and SUVs accounted for 59.5 percent of 2016 auto sales, up from 55.8 percent in 2015.

Pickup trucks and compact SUVs held the first six spots in the monthly top-selling models list, as reported by the automakers. [nL4N1EU3Z5]

Strong consumer discounts, also called sales incentives, also helped December's sales.

December consumer discounts averaged about $4,000 per vehicle, up by about $500 from a year earlier, according to J.D. Power data provided to Reuters.

Discounts erode automakers' profits but GM said the average transaction price for its vehicles rose $740 from November to $36,386 in December, reflecting in part strong sales of large SUVs such as the Chevrolet Tahoe. That is important to investors because Detroit's automakers make the bulk of their global profits from sales of trucks and SUVs in North America.

Industry executives have cautioned for several months that the U.S. market's post-financial crisis recovery was due for a slowdown, but such concerns seem to be easing.

"Key economic indicators, especially consumer confidence, continue to reflect optimism about the U.S. economy and strong customer demand continues to drive a very healthy U.S. auto industry," said Mustafa Mohatarem, GM's chief economist.

Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV FCAU.N> was a laggard in December, as its sales slid 10 percent. FCA's Jeep brand reported sales down 6 percent.

Ford Motor Co on Tuesday reversed plans for a $1.6 billion factory in Mexico and said it would add 700 jobs in Michigan after receiving criticism from President-elect Donald Trump. [nL1N1ET0OD]

Amazon and Forever 21, as well as California-based apparel maker Next Level Apparel and brand licensor Authentic Brands Group LLC, are in talks with American Apparel and its financial advisers about submitting offers ahead of a deadline on Friday, the people said.

Any successful offer would have to top a $66 million stalking horse bid by Canadian apparel maker Gildan Activewear Inc , which American Apparel agreed to when it filed for bankruptcy in November.

Gildan's offer included an option to keep American Apparel's manufacturing plants in southern California, which employ about 3,500 workers, making American Apparel one of the biggest garment makers in the United States.

But Gildan plans to preserve only some of the California production should its bid prevail, the sources said. Many of Gildan's production facilities are in low-cost countries.

An outcome in the auction is expected next week, the sources said, asking not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential.

American Apparel declined to comment. Amazon, Forever 21, Next Level Apparel and Authentic Brands did not respond to requests for comment.

A Gildan spokesman said in an email on Wednesday that it is putting together all the necessary information from its due diligence to best position itself in the auction.

Amazon's acquisition of American Apparel would be a major push for the e-commerce company into branded fashion and apparel. The Seattle-based company began to launch private label brands last year.

Forever 21, founded by Korean-American Do Won Chang, is known for its low retail prices, helped by lower labor costs abroad. American Apparel's first bankruptcy in 2015 was due in part to its relatively high labor costs.

"SWEATSHOP-FREE"

American Apparel went into bankruptcy for the second time last November with about $177 million in debt. Former Chief Executive Dov Charney founded the company in the late 1990s, when most garment-making was moving offshore.

For years this contrarian strategy worked. American Apparel's "sweatshop-free" label was a hit with young people, helping make the brand a part of popular culture.

Part of American Apparel's name recognition also stemmed from Charney himself, who was outspoken on immigration and fair wage issues, but was plagued by sexual harassment claims, which he has denied. The company was also famous for its sexually charged advertising.

A 2009 run-in with Immigration and Customs Enforcement over the legal employment status of 1,800 employees sent American Apparel on a downward trajectory, according to court documents from the company's 2015 bankruptcy.

American Apparel had to fire these employees, more than a quarter of its manufacturing workforce. The layoffs caused production delays and a 90 percent year-on-year drop in profits in 2009, according to the documents.

Charney was ousted in 2014, by which time the company was struggling with declining sales and an unsustainable debt load. It filed for bankruptcy in October 2015, and emerged in February 2016, only to seek bankruptcy protection once again in November 2016.

American Apparel has notified its workers that they could be losing their jobs as early as this month.

Gildan makes most of its garments offshore, with close to 90 percent of its 42,000 employees in low-cost Caribbean and Central American countries. In California, the minimum wage is scheduled to rise to $15 per hour in 2022 for firms with 26 employees or more.

Gildan has yarn-spinning and distribution centers in cheaper parts of the United States, including North Carolina and Georgia. Gildan's bid for American Apparel does not include the retail chain's approximately 110 stores.

{{20170104T183602.690+0000}}Ford's Canadian sales rise in December, leap 9.4 percent in 2016MONTREAL, Jan 4 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co on Wednesday reported slightly higher Canadian sales of autos and trucks for December and called 2016 its best year of sales since 1989, driven by demand for SUVs and pickups.

Ford said in a statement it sold 304,618 vehicles in Canada in 2016, up 9.4 percent compared with 278,531 units in 2015. For December, the automaker reported the sale of 19,759 vehicles, up 0.7 percent compared with 19,623 vehicles during the same month in 2015.

Analysts had expected Canada's manufacturers overall would set another record in 2016, with sales rising to around 1.96 million vehicles from 1.90 million units in 2015.

In the United States, General Motors Co on Wednesday reported an unexpected 8 percent rise in auto sales while Ford also beat forecasts, indicating that 2016 results will beat a record high set in 2015. [nL1N1EU0KF]

CORRECTED-UPDATE 1-GM Dec U.S. sales up 10 pct, sees record for industry in 2016 - Reuters News

{{20170104T165735.837+0000}}CORRECTED-UPDATE 1-GM Dec U.S. sales up 10 pct, sees record for industry in 2016(Corrects headline to 2016 and first paragraph to show GM sales in month up 10 percent, not 8 percent)

By Bernie Woodall

DETROIT, Jan 4 (Reuters) - General Motors Co on Wednesday reported an unexpected 10 percent rise in December U.S. auto sales while Ford Motor Co also beat forecasts, indicating that 2016 results will beat a record high set in 2015.

"Key economic indicators, especially consumer confidence, continue to reflect optimism about the U.S. economy, and strong customer demand continues to drive a very healthy U.S. auto industry," said Mustafa Mohatarem, GM's chief economist.

"We believe the U.S. auto industry remains well positioned for sales to continue at or near record levels in 2017."

Analysts polled by Reuters expected GM's December U.S. sales to increase by about 3.5 percent from a year earlier. Ford's December U.S. sales increased 0.3 percent while Wall Street estimated a decline of about 2.5 percent.

The better-than-expected results helped boost shares of GM , up 4.4 percent, and Ford up 4.2 percent.

GM said December industry sales will be a robust 18.2 million vehicles on a seasonally adjusted annualized basis, far exceeding the 17.7 million vehicles forecast by 35 economists polled by Thomson Reuters.

Ford Chief Executive Officer Mark Fields said on Tuesday the auto industry and Ford will be helped by "pro-growth" policies expected by the incoming administration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. [nL1N1ET0OD]

GM and Ford notched the gains as they kept inventory at healthy levels.

GM ended the year with 71 days of inventory, meeting its target of about 70 days of supply. Ford ended with 70 days of U.S. inventory. Analysts were concerned that GM's inventory levels were high, but the data showed otherwise.

Ford was led by the F-Series pickup truck, which rose 2.7 percent to 87,512. The model line was the top-selling pickup truck in the United States for a 40th consecutive year.

Japan's Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T> reported a 2 percent gain. Analysts expected a decline of 1 percent to 4 percent.

Fiat Chrysler Automobiles' sales slid 10 percent while analysts looked for a decrease of between 10 percent and 15 percent. The fall was partly due to production ending on several sedan models.

However, sales at its Jeep brand, which has been its strongest since the 2008-2009 recession, fell 6 percent in December. Jeep Cherokee sales fell 25 percent as rivals fielded new models in the increasingly competitive midsize SUV segment.

Investors will watch to see if consumer discounts, which cut into company profits, are also at a record high, which analysts expected.

Nissan Motor Co's <7201.T> sales rose 10 percent in December, led by its luxury brand Infiniti, which gained 20.6 percent. [nL4N1EU2V3]

Automakers could post record 2016 U.S. sales on Wednesday - poll - 路透新闻

{{20170104T141054.680+0000}}Automakers could post record 2016 U.S. sales on Wednesday - pollBy Bernie Woodall

DETROIT, Jan 4 (Reuters) - Major automakers in the U.S. market are expected to show robust December auto sales on Wednesday, perhaps high enough for 2016 results to break the record high set the previous year, according to a poll by Thomson Reuters.

December auto sales are forecast at an average 17.7 million vehicles on a seasonally adjusted annualized basis, according to a Thomson Reuters poll of 35 economists. If sales reach that level in December, 2016 will set a new annual record.

Investors will watch to see if consumer discounts, which cut into company profits, are also at a record high, which analysts expect.

December sales will also give a hint of what is in store in 2017. Industry consultants LMC Automotive and J.D. Power forecast 2017 sales between 17.4 million and 17.5 million, just below what is expected for 2016.

Ford Motor Co Chief Executive Officer Mark Fields said on Tuesday he expected auto sales to be helped by "pro-growth" policies expected by the incoming administration of President-elect Donald Trump. [nL1N1ET0OD]

Most automakers including the top three U.S.-based companies General Motors Co , Ford and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles will report by mid-morning Wednesday.

Nissan Motor Co's <7201.T> luxury brand Infiniti said earlier Wednesday its December U.S. sales totaled 18,200 vehicles, up 20 percent from a year earlier. U.S. full-year Infiniti sales rose 4 percent to 153,500 vehicles. Globally, Infiniti sold 230,000 vehicles in 2016, an increase of 7 percent from a year earlier. [nL4N1EU2V3]

Analysts polled by Reuters expect GM's December U.S. sales to increase by about 3.5 percent from a year earlier, while Ford declines about 2.5 percent and Fiat Chrysler drops between 10 percent and 15 percent.

Japan's Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T> sales are expected to decline between 1 percent and 4 percent from December 2015, according to analysts.

WRAPUP 2-Chided by Trump, Ford scraps Mexico factory, adds Michigan jobs - Reuters News

{{20170103T222558.330+0000}}WRAPUP 2-Chided by Trump, Ford scraps Mexico factory, adds Michigan jobs(Adds quote from Mexican official, expected Michigan investment, closing share prices)

* Ford says decision in part a 'vote of confidence' in Trump

* Trump also hits GM over making Chevrolet Cruze cars in Mexico

By Bernie Woodall and David Shepardson

FLAT ROCK, Mich./WASHINGTON, Jan 3 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co on Tuesday scrapped a planned Mexican car factory and added 700 jobs in Michigan following criticism by Donald Trump, as the U.S. president-elect turned his attention toward rival General Motors Co with the threat of a "big border tax" over compact cars made in Mexico.

Ford CEO Mark Fields called the move "a vote of confidence" in Trump, but primarily a response to a decline in North American demand for small cars like those that would have been made at the Mexican plant. He said Ford would have made the same decision even if Trump had not been elected.

Ford will cancel plans unveiled in April to spend $1.6 billion to build the new plant in San Luis Potosi, Mexico, a project Trump urged the automaker to abandon and called an "absolute disgrace" during the election campaign.

The No. 2 U.S. automaker also said it would invest $700 million to expand the Flat Rock, Michigan factory and would make new electric, hybrid and autonomous vehicles there.

Trump's efforts to browbeat the U.S. car industry show he may go further than other modern presidents to try to influence corporate decisions, especially those related to trade and investment.

In a Twitter post hours before Ford's announcement, Trump wrote, "General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across border. Make in U.S.A. or pay big border tax!" GM, the largest U.S. automaker, said making some of the Cruze cars in the plant in Coahuila, Mexico was part of its strategy to serve global customers, not sell those vehicles in the United States.

Trump's GM tweet was his latest broadside aimed at an American company over jobs, imports and costs even before he takes office on Jan. 20.

Mexico's government said it regrets Ford's decision and has ensured that the company will reimburse San Luis Potosi state for any costs associated with the investment.

"Obviously, this isn't a good decision for us," said Mexico's economy minister, Ildefonso Guajardo. [nE1N1DI020]

Ford said it still will shift production from Michigan of its Focus compact car to an existing plant in Hermosillo, Mexico. Fields said he expects Michigan to give incentives for Ford's investment in Flat Rock.

Ford spokeswoman Jennifer Flake said the automaker will save $500 million by not opening the new plant in the near term, but will have some undisclosed costs to retool the other Mexican plant to build the Focus.

Ford shares closed up about 3.8 percent. GM shares rose about 0.9 percent.

TRUMP NOTIFIED

Top Ford executives personally notified Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence of their decision. Fields praised tax and regulatory proposals advocated by Trump and his fellow Republicans who control Congress.

"Our view is that we see a more positive U.S. manufacturing business environment under President-elect Trump and the pro-growth policies and proposals that he's talking about, so this is a vote of confidence for President-elect Trump and some of the policies that they may be pursuing," Fields said.

Union workers gathered at the Flat Rock factory cheered Fields' announcement. Hiring of the 700 new workers there will probably start in 2018 with the majority of it in 2020, Fields said.

Trump said during the presidential campaign that if elected he would not allow Ford to open the new plant in Mexico and would slap hefty tariffs on imported Ford vehicles. Trump also accused Mexico of sending criminals and rapists into the United States and vowed to build a border wall to combat illegal immigration.

Since winning the Nov. 8 election, Trump has targeted a wide range of American companies also including United Technologies Inc , Boeing Co and Lockheed Martin Corp . Trump also has touted decisions by companies to keep some production in the United States, including United's Carrier unit in Indiana.

Trump previously vowed to hit companies that shift production from America to other countries with a 35 percent tax on their exports into the United States. He also has denounced the North American Free Trade Agreement between the United States, Mexico and Canada.

Fields said there were no negotiations between Ford and the incoming president over canceling the Mexico plant or investing in Michigan.

Ford will build a battery electric SUV with a 300-mile (482-km) driving range at the Michigan plant by 2020, and will launch production there by 2021 of a fully autonomous vehicle without a steering wheel or a brake pedal for use in ride services fleets. Ford also plans new hybrid versions of its F-150 pickup truck, Mustang and police vehicles by 2020.

GM said it sold about 190,000 Cruze cars in the United States in 2016. All of the sedan versions sold in the United States, about 185,500, were built at its Lordstown, Ohio plant. About 4,500 hatchback Cruze versions were assembled in Mexico and sold in the United States.

* Dollar hits 14-year high following robust economic data

* Verizon rises on Citigroup upgrade

* Indexes end up: Dow 0.60 pct, S&P 0.85 pct, Nasdaq 0.85 pct

(Updates to close)

By Noel Randewich

Jan 3 (Reuters) - Wall Street rose sharply on Tuesday as a post-election rally extended into the new year, helped by gains in Verizon Communications and technology companies Alphabet and Facebook.

U.S. stocks have surged over the past two months on expectations that President-elect Donald Trump will stimulate the economy with tax cuts and infrastructure spending and slash regulations in the financial industry.

"The market is picking up where it left off since the Trump presidency," said Thomas Wilson, senior investment manager at Brinker Capital. "What you are seeing is the market moving up in anticipation of fiscal expansion."

However, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average trading near the never-before-reached 20,000 mark, some investors warned that additional strong gains would be unlikely in the short term. They want to see evidence that Trump's campaign-trail promises will be approved by Republican lawmakers concerned about widening the federal budget deficit.

"The president-elect can't just wave a magic wand," said Warren West, principal at Greentree Brokerage Services in Philadelphia. "He has to deal with Congress, and Congress hasn't proved to be able to agree with itself."

The Dow came within a hair's breadth of the historic 20,000 milestone in December but it has since fallen back. The average rose to as much as 19,938.53 earlier in the session on Tuesday, helped by Walt Disney .

Ford Motor jumped 3.79 percent. The carmaker said it would cancel a planned $1.6-billion factory in Mexico and invest $700 million at a Michigan factory, after Trump had harshly criticized the Mexico investment plan. [nL1N1ET0OD]

Oil prices hit an 18-month high before turning negative and falling more than 2 percent. [nL4N1ET070] The S&P energy index <.SPNY> rose 1.15 percent, with Exxon Mobil up 0.70 percent. [nL1N1ET0JR]

The U.S. dollar touched a 14-year high after data showed U.S. factory activity accelerated to a two-year high in December.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average <.DJI> climbed 119.16 points, or 0.6 percent, to end at 19,881.76 points and the S&P 500 <.SPX> gained 0.85 percent to 2,257.83.

The Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> added 0.85 percent to 5,429.08.

Verizon gave the biggest boost to the S&P 500, rising 2.25 percent after Citigroup upgraded the stock to "buy."

Also boosting the S&P 500, Google parent-company Alphabet rose 1.96 percent and Facebook added 1.57 percent.

The S&P health index <.SPXHC> rose 1.40 percent, with Merck & Co up 2.17 percent and Gilead Sciences rising 3.56 percent.

The S&P utilities index <.SPLRCU> dipped 0.30 percent, the only index down among 11 S&P sectors.

Marathon Petroleum rose 5.12 percent after the company said it would explore a spinoff of its retail business, caving to pressure from activist investor Elliott Management. [nL4N1ET25W]

Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 3.24-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.79-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&P 500 posted 17 new 52-week highs and 1 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 121 new highs and 26 new lows.

MEXICO CITY, Jan 3 (Reuters) - Mexico's economy minister said on Tuesday he did not believe that Ford Motor Co.'s decision to cancel its planned $1.6 billion factory in San Luis Potosi state will trigger a series of similar decisions.

Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo told local radio that the decision was specific to Ford's changing demand as well as the company's stance towards U.S. President-elect Donald Trump.

Ford, the second largest U.S. automaker, said it would build new electric, hybrid and autonomous vehicles at the Flat Rock, Michigan plant and add 700 jobs.

By Noel Randewich

Jan 3 (Reuters) - Wall Street rose on Tuesday as a post-election rally extended into the new year, even as some investors warned they need to see results from President-elect Donald Trump before pushing stock prices significantly higher.

U.S. stocks have surged over the past two months on expectations that Trump will stimulate the economy with tax cuts and infrastructure spending and slash regulations in the financial industry.

Now with the Dow Jones Industrial Average trading near the never-before-reached 20,000 mark, some investors say additional strong gains are unlikely in the short term. They want to see evidence that Trump's campaign-trail promises will be approved by Republican lawmakers concerned about widening the federal budget deficit.

The S&P 500 rose by over 1 percent on Tuesday before giving up most of those gains, suggesting the rally is losing steam, said Warren West, principal at Greentree Brokerage Services in Philadelphia.

"The president-elect can't just wave a magic wand. He has to deal with Congress, and Congress hasn't proved to be able to agree with itself," West said.

The Dow came within a hair's breadth of the historic 20,000 milestone in December but it has since fallen back. The average rose to as much as 19,938.53 earlier in the session on Tuesday, helped by Walt Disney .

Ford Motor rose 3.80 percent. The carmaker said it would cancel a planned $1.6 billion factory in Mexico and invest $700 million at a Michigan factory, after Trump had harshly criticized the Mexico investment plan. [nL1N1ET0OD]

The U.S. dollar touched a 14-year high after data showed U.S. factory activity accelerated to a two-year high in December.

At 2:42 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average <.DJI> was up 0.17 percent to 19,795.71 points and the S&P 500 <.SPX> had gained 0.38 percent to 2,247.41. The Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> added 0.32 percent to 5,400.56.

The S&P health index <.SPXHC> rose 1.06 percent, with Merck & Co up 2.16 percent and Gilead Sciences rising 3.39 percent.

The S&P utilities index <.SPLRCU> dipped 0.39 percent.

Verizon gave the biggest boost to the S&P 500, rising 1.95 percent after Citigroup upgraded the stock to "buy."

Marathon Petroleum rose 5.2 percent after the company said it would explore a spinoff of its retail business, caving to pressure from activist investor Elliott Management. [nL4N1ET25W]

Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.99-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.17-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&P 500 posted 17 new 52-week highs and 1 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 112 new highs and 21 new lows.

UPDATE 4-Ford scraps plan for $1.6 bln plant in Mexico after Trump criticism - Reuters News

{{20170103T192635.889+0000}}UPDATE 4-Ford scraps plan for $1.6 bln plant in Mexico after Trump criticism(Adds Mark Fields comment saying decision not result of Trump pressure)

By Bernie Woodall and David Shepardson

FLAT ROCK, Mich./WASHINGTON, Jan 3 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co said Tuesday it will cancel a planned $1.6 billion factory in Mexico and invest $700 million at a Michigan factory, after President-elect Donald Trump had harshly criticized the Mexico investment plan.

The second largest U.S. automaker said it would build new electric, hybrid and autonomous vehicles at the Flat Rock, Michigan plant and add 700 jobs.

Ford Chief Executive Mark Fields said the decision to cancel the new Mexico factory was the result of sagging demand for small cars in North America and not because Trump was elected president. He told Fox Business that the automaker would have made the same decision even if Trump had not been elected.

"There was no quid pro quo because there was no negotiation" with Trump over the decision to cancel the plant, Fields said.

Fields told reporters the decision related to the need to "fully utilize capacity at existing facilities" amid declining sales of small and medium sized cars such as the Focus and Fusion.

Fields also endorsed "pro growth" tax and regulatory policies advocated by Trump and the Republican-led Congress. "This is a vote of confidence for President-Elect Trump and some of the policies he may be pursuing," Fields said.

Trump repeatedly said during the election campaign that if elected he would not allow Ford to open the new plant in Mexico, which he called an "absolute disgrace" and would slap hefty tariffs taxes on imported Ford vehicles.

Ford executive chairman Bill Ford Jr. told reporters he spoke with Trump to notify him of the decision. The company said the decision was influenced by Trump's policy goals such as lowering taxes and regulations but that there were no negotiations over the decision announced on Tuesday.

By contrast, Trump's team held talks with United Technologies Corp in November before the company agreed to keep about 800 jobs at its Carrier air conditioning unit in Indiana out of 2,100 set to go to Mexico. Trump has also held high profile meetings with the chief executives of Boeing and Lockheed Martin to talk about the cost of military contracts.

Also on Tuesday, Trump threatened to impose a "big border tax" on General Motors Co for making some of its Chevrolet Cruze cars in Mexico. [nL1N1ET0DB]

The New York businessman, who has vowed to bring back American jobs that have been outsourced overseas and be tough on illegal immigration from Mexico, takes office on Jan. 20.

Fields said Ford will build a battery electric SUV with a 300-mile driving range at the Michigan plant by 2020 -- taking on companies like Tesla Motors Inc , Volkswagen AG and GM -- and will launch production there by 2021 of a fully autonomous vehicle without a steering wheel or a brake pedal for use in ride services fleets.

Ford also plans new hybrid versions of its F-150 pickup truck, Mustang and police vehicles by 2020 as the auto industry faces rising fuel efficiency mandates.

Ford will add 700 jobs at the Flat Rock plant, Fields said, to cheers from union workers gathered at the factory for the announcement.

TRUMP PREDICTION

Ford in April announced it would invest $1.6 billion in the new plant in San Luis Potosi, Mexico to build small cars. The company said it will shift production from Michigan of its Focus to an existing plant in Hermosillo, Mexico.

When Trump announced his campaign in June, 2015, he said Ford would cancel its planned Mexico investments. "They'll say,'Mr. President we've decided to move the plant back to the United States — we're not going to build it in Mexico.' That's it. They have no choice," Trump said.

Trump tweeted a link on Tuesday to a story about the decision.

Ford shares rose 3.3 percent to $12.54, up $0.41 a share, while the Mexican peso fell on Tuesday to touch its weakest level in seven weeks. [nL1N1ET0QS]

Ford said it will add two new unnamed products at its Michigan Assembly Plant in Wayne, Michigan, where the Focus is manufactured today.

WRAPUP 2-Chided by Trump, Ford scraps Mexico factory, adds Michigan jobs - Reuters News

{{20170103T222558.330+0000}}WRAPUP 2-Chided by Trump, Ford scraps Mexico factory, adds Michigan jobs(Adds quote from Mexican official, expected Michigan investment, closing share prices)

* Ford says decision in part a 'vote of confidence' in Trump

* Trump also hits GM over making Chevrolet Cruze cars in Mexico

By Bernie Woodall and David Shepardson

FLAT ROCK, Mich./WASHINGTON, Jan 3 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co on Tuesday scrapped a planned Mexican car factory and added 700 jobs in Michigan following criticism by Donald Trump, as the U.S. president-elect turned his attention toward rival General Motors Co with the threat of a "big border tax" over compact cars made in Mexico.

Ford CEO Mark Fields called the move "a vote of confidence" in Trump, but primarily a response to a decline in North American demand for small cars like those that would have been made at the Mexican plant. He said Ford would have made the same decision even if Trump had not been elected.

Ford will cancel plans unveiled in April to spend $1.6 billion to build the new plant in San Luis Potosi, Mexico, a project Trump urged the automaker to abandon and called an "absolute disgrace" during the election campaign.

The No. 2 U.S. automaker also said it would invest $700 million to expand the Flat Rock, Michigan factory and would make new electric, hybrid and autonomous vehicles there.

Trump's efforts to browbeat the U.S. car industry show he may go further than other modern presidents to try to influence corporate decisions, especially those related to trade and investment.

In a Twitter post hours before Ford's announcement, Trump wrote, "General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across border. Make in U.S.A. or pay big border tax!" GM, the largest U.S. automaker, said making some of the Cruze cars in the plant in Coahuila, Mexico was part of its strategy to serve global customers, not sell those vehicles in the United States.

Trump's GM tweet was his latest broadside aimed at an American company over jobs, imports and costs even before he takes office on Jan. 20.

Mexico's government said it regrets Ford's decision and has ensured that the company will reimburse San Luis Potosi state for any costs associated with the investment.

"Obviously, this isn't a good decision for us," said Mexico's economy minister, Ildefonso Guajardo. [nE1N1DI020]

Ford said it still will shift production from Michigan of its Focus compact car to an existing plant in Hermosillo, Mexico. Fields said he expects Michigan to give incentives for Ford's investment in Flat Rock.

Ford spokeswoman Jennifer Flake said the automaker will save $500 million by not opening the new plant in the near term, but will have some undisclosed costs to retool the other Mexican plant to build the Focus.

Ford shares closed up about 3.8 percent. GM shares rose about 0.9 percent.

TRUMP NOTIFIED

Top Ford executives personally notified Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence of their decision. Fields praised tax and regulatory proposals advocated by Trump and his fellow Republicans who control Congress.

"Our view is that we see a more positive U.S. manufacturing business environment under President-elect Trump and the pro-growth policies and proposals that he's talking about, so this is a vote of confidence for President-elect Trump and some of the policies that they may be pursuing," Fields said.

Union workers gathered at the Flat Rock factory cheered Fields' announcement. Hiring of the 700 new workers there will probably start in 2018 with the majority of it in 2020, Fields said.

Trump said during the presidential campaign that if elected he would not allow Ford to open the new plant in Mexico and would slap hefty tariffs on imported Ford vehicles. Trump also accused Mexico of sending criminals and rapists into the United States and vowed to build a border wall to combat illegal immigration.

Since winning the Nov. 8 election, Trump has targeted a wide range of American companies also including United Technologies Inc , Boeing Co and Lockheed Martin Corp . Trump also has touted decisions by companies to keep some production in the United States, including United's Carrier unit in Indiana.

Trump previously vowed to hit companies that shift production from America to other countries with a 35 percent tax on their exports into the United States. He also has denounced the North American Free Trade Agreement between the United States, Mexico and Canada.

Fields said there were no negotiations between Ford and the incoming president over canceling the Mexico plant or investing in Michigan.

Ford will build a battery electric SUV with a 300-mile (482-km) driving range at the Michigan plant by 2020, and will launch production there by 2021 of a fully autonomous vehicle without a steering wheel or a brake pedal for use in ride services fleets. Ford also plans new hybrid versions of its F-150 pickup truck, Mustang and police vehicles by 2020.

GM said it sold about 190,000 Cruze cars in the United States in 2016. All of the sedan versions sold in the United States, about 185,500, were built at its Lordstown, Ohio plant. About 4,500 hatchback Cruze versions were assembled in Mexico and sold in the United States.

By Noel Randewich

Jan 3 (Reuters) - Wall Street rose sharply on Tuesday as a post-election rally extended into the new year, helped by gains in Verizon Communications and technology companies Alphabet and Facebook.

U.S. stocks have surged over the past two months on expectations that President-elect Donald Trump will stimulate the economy with tax cuts and infrastructure spending and slash regulations in the financial industry.

"The market is picking up where it left off since the Trump presidency," said Thomas Wilson, senior investment manager at Brinker Capital. "What you are seeing is the market moving up in anticipation of fiscal expansion."

However, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average trading near the never-before-reached 20,000 mark, some investors warned that additional strong gains would be unlikely in the short term.

MEXICO CITY, Jan 3 (Reuters) - Mexico's economy minister said on Tuesday he did not believe that Ford Motor Co.'s decision to cancel its planned $1.6 billion factory in San Luis Potosi state will trigger a series of similar decisions.

Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo told local radio that the decision was specific to Ford's changing demand as well as the company's stance towards U.S. President-elect Donald Trump.

Ford, the second largest U.S. automaker, said it would build new electric, hybrid and autonomous vehicles at the Flat Rock, Michigan plant and add 700 jobs.

Jan 3 (Reuters) - Wall Street rose on Tuesday as a post-election rally extended into the new year, even as some investors warned they need to see results from President-elect Donald Trump before pushing stock prices significantly higher.

U.S. stocks have surged over the past two months on expectations that Trump will stimulate the economy with tax cuts and infrastructure spending and slash regulations in the financial industry.

Now with the Dow Jones Industrial Average trading near the never-before-reached 20,000 mark, some investors say additional strong gains are unlikely in the short term. They want to see evidence that Trump's campaign-trail promises will be approved by Republican lawmakers concerned about widening the federal budget deficit.

The S&P 500 rose by over 1 percent on Tuesday before giving up most of those gains, suggesting the rally is losing steam, said Warren West, principal at Greentree Brokerage Services in Philadelphia.

"The president-elect can't just wave a magic wand. He has to deal with Congress, and Congress hasn't proved to be able to agree with itself," West said.

The Dow came within a hair's breadth of the historic 20,000 milestone in December but it has since fallen back. The average rose to as much as 19,938.53 earlier in the session on Tuesday, helped by Walt Disney .

UPDATE 4-Ford scraps plan for $1.6 bln plant in Mexico after Trump criticism - Reuters News

{{20170103T192635.889+0000}}UPDATE 4-Ford scraps plan for $1.6 bln plant in Mexico after Trump criticism(Adds Mark Fields comment saying decision not result of Trump pressure)

By Bernie Woodall and David Shepardson

FLAT ROCK, Mich./WASHINGTON, Jan 3 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co said Tuesday it will cancel a planned $1.6 billion factory in Mexico and invest $700 million at a Michigan factory, after President-elect Donald Trump had harshly criticized the Mexico investment plan.

The second largest U.S. automaker said it would build new electric, hybrid and autonomous vehicles at the Flat Rock, Michigan plant and add 700 jobs.

Ford Chief Executive Mark Fields said the decision to cancel the new Mexico factory was the result of sagging demand for small cars in North America and not because Trump was elected president. He told Fox Business that the automaker would have made the same decision even if Trump had not been elected.

"There was no quid pro quo because there was no negotiation" with Trump over the decision to cancel the plant, Fields said.

Fields told reporters the decision related to the need to "fully utilize capacity at existing facilities" amid declining sales of small and medium sized cars such as the Focus and Fusion.

Fields also endorsed "pro growth" tax and regulatory policies advocated by Trump and the Republican-led Congress. "This is a vote of confidence for President-Elect Trump and some of the policies he may be pursuing," Fields said.

Trump repeatedly said during the election campaign that if elected he would not allow Ford to open the new plant in Mexico, which he called an "absolute disgrace" and would slap hefty tariffs taxes on imported Ford vehicles.

Ford executive chairman Bill Ford Jr. told reporters he spoke with Trump to notify him of the decision. The company said the decision was influenced by Trump's policy goals such as lowering taxes and regulations but that there were no negotiations over the decision announced on Tuesday.

By contrast, Trump's team held talks with United Technologies Corp in November before the company agreed to keep about 800 jobs at its Carrier air conditioning unit in Indiana out of 2,100 set to go to Mexico. Trump has also held high profile meetings with the chief executives of Boeing and Lockheed Martin to talk about the cost of military contracts.

Also on Tuesday, Trump threatened to impose a "big border tax" on General Motors Co for making some of its Chevrolet Cruze cars in Mexico. [nL1N1ET0DB]

The New York businessman, who has vowed to bring back American jobs that have been outsourced overseas and be tough on illegal immigration from Mexico, takes office on Jan. 20.

Fields said Ford will build a battery electric SUV with a 300-mile driving range at the Michigan plant by 2020 -- taking on companies like Tesla Motors Inc , Volkswagen AG and GM -- and will launch production there by 2021 of a fully autonomous vehicle without a steering wheel or a brake pedal for use in ride services fleets.

Ford also plans new hybrid versions of its F-150 pickup truck, Mustang and police vehicles by 2020 as the auto industry faces rising fuel efficiency mandates.

Ford will add 700 jobs at the Flat Rock plant, Fields said, to cheers from union workers gathered at the factory for the announcement.

TRUMP PREDICTION

Ford in April announced it would invest $1.6 billion in the new plant in San Luis Potosi, Mexico to build small cars. The company said it will shift production from Michigan of its Focus to an existing plant in Hermosillo, Mexico.

When Trump announced his campaign in June, 2015, he said Ford would cancel its planned Mexico investments. "They'll say,'Mr. President we've decided to move the plant back to the United States — we're not going to build it in Mexico.' That's it. They have no choice," Trump said.

Trump tweeted a link on Tuesday to a story about the decision.

Ford shares rose 3.3 percent to $12.54, up $0.41 a share, while the Mexican peso fell on Tuesday to touch its weakest level in seven weeks. [nL1N1ET0QS]

Ford said it will add two new unnamed products at its Michigan Assembly Plant in Wayne, Michigan, where the Focus is manufactured today.
