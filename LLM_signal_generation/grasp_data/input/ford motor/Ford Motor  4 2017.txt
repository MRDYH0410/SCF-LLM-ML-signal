UPDATE 1-GM writes down Venezuela operations after authorities seize plant - 路透新闻

{{20170502T152635.615+0000}}UPDATE 1-GM writes down Venezuela operations after authorities seize plant(Adds details on falling auto production, more details of GM incident)

By David Shepardson

May 2 (Reuters) - General Motors Co said on Tuesday it would take a charge of up to $100 million after a judge ordered the seizure of its plant in Valencia last month, a move that prompted the halting of its operations in Venezuela.

The largest U.S. automaker said it was deconsolidating its business in the country following the seizure of its Valencia plant on April 18 by judicial authorities, which led GM to fire 2,700 workers. [nL1N1HS221] The plant had not produced a car since the beginning of 2016 because of parts shortages and strict currency controls.

GM, the market leader in Venezuela for 35 years, said executives have expressed a willingness "to talk with government officials and union leaders about the circumstances under which it could be possible to start production and employ some number of workers with a new, viable business model."

Total auto production in Venezuela fell to a historic low of 2,849 cars in 2016, about 75 percent less than the year before, according to Venezuela's automotive industry group.

In the first two months of 2017, total Venezuelan auto production was just 240 vehicles, down 50 percent over the same period last year.

Declining auto production comes amid rising protests. On Tuesday, Venezuela's opposition was blocking streets to decry unpopular leftist President Nicolas Maduro's decision to create a new super-body known as a "constituent assembly," a move they say is a veiled attempt to cling to power by avoiding elections.

Venezuela's car industry has been hit by a lack of raw materials stemming from complex currency controls.

Nearly all vehicles built in Venezuela in the first two months this year were assembled by Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T>, which said last month its plant was operating normally. But the company said it was "only producing based on orders that come in."

In early 2015, Ford Motor Co wrote off its investment in Venezuela when it took an $800 million pretax writedown. The company does not currently produce vehicles in Venezuela.

The South American nation's economic crisis has hurt many other U.S. companies, including food makers and pharmaceutical firms. A growing number of them, like GM, have removed their Venezuelan operations from their consolidated accounts.

GM, Ford and Toyota all post U.S. sales declines in April - 路透新闻

{{20170502T141109.749+0000}}GM, Ford and Toyota all post U.S. sales declines in AprilBy Nick Carey

DETROIT, May 2 (Reuters) - General Motors Co, Ford Motor Co and Toyota Motor Corp, the top three automakers in the United States, on Tuesday all posted lower new vehicle sales in April in a fresh sign the long boom cycle for the auto industry is losing steam.

GM shares fell 3.5 percent while Ford was off 4.5 percent.

No. 1 U.S. automaker GM reported a 6 percent decline in April sales to 244,406 vehicles, but said the month continued to see strong growth for crossovers and trucks.

Over the past couple of years, U.S. consumers have increasingly shunned cars in favor of larger crossovers, SUVs and trucks.

New vehicle sales have risen ever since the end of the Great Recession, hitting a record of 17.55 million units in 2016. But as consumer appetite for new cars has waned, automakers have raised discounts to get vehicles off dealer lots.

GM said the average transaction price for its vehicles rose in the first quarter and that its consumer discounts were equivalent to 11.7 percent of the transaction price. The automaker also said its inventory level had risen to 100 days of supply at the end of April versus around 70 days at the end of 2016.

GM has said it will bring inventories down by the end of 2017, but the most recent level has created concern among analysts.

Ford, the No. 2 U.S. automaker, said sales were down 7.2 percent in April, with sales to consumers down 10.5 percent. Car sales dropped 21 percent and trucks declined 4.2 percent, while SUV sales rose 1.2 percent.

Toyota <7203.T> said sales fell 4.4 percent in April, with its luxury Lexus brand posting an 11.1 percent drop. U.S. car sales at the Japanese automaker were down 10.4 percent, while truck sales were up 2.1 percent.

Manufacturers, Wall Street getting Trump's ear in first 100 days - 路透新闻

{{20170427T162534.105+0000}}Manufacturers, Wall Street getting Trump's ear in first 100 daysBy Jason Lange

WASHINGTON, April 27 (Reuters) - Manufacturers and Wall Street have led the quest for business access to President Donald Trump in his first 100 days in office, with media companies and Silicon Valley seldom entering the presidential bubble, a Reuters review found.

Since inauguration day on Jan. 20, top executives from at least 186 companies have visited with Trump or senior advisers at the White House or on presidential trips, including those to Mar-a-Lago, the private, seaside Florida club where he spends many weekends.

Some of the meetings have been reported in the press. But Reuters analyzed more than 900 White House press pool reports to give the first big picture view, albeit an incomplete one, of who has had the most and least success at bending the president's ear.

Such access can be crucial for companies, with Trump regularly passing judgment and making proposals on business issues such as trade, taxes, immigration and regulation.

The review showed Trump listening closely to some segments of Corporate America, though perhaps neglecting the dynamic technology and entertainment sectors, both powerful U.S. export industries.

Tim Cook, CEO of Apple Inc , and other tech leaders met with Trump before his inauguration. [nL1N1E90NI]

Access sometimes means influence, but it was likely too soon to tell, after less than 100 days, whether Trump's actions have disproportionately favored big manufacturers and Wall Street.

Industrial power-houses have led the way on access, including companies with the clout to make significant hiring decisions: Ford Motor Co CEO Mark Fields has met with Trump at least four times; General Motors CEO Mary Barra, at least four times; and Boeing representatives, at least three times.

The Reuters review helps fill a blank in the Trump record that opened in mid-April when he put the White House visitor logs off-limits to the public. They had been mostly public under Obama.

Transparency advocates have warned that Trump's decision will make it harder to hold him accountable. [nL1N1HM0KQ] [nL1N1HI1PS]

"A public record of who has the president's ear is more important than it has ever been," said John Wonderlich, executive director of the Sunlight Foundation, a nonprofit good-government advocacy group.

The review showed about half of the companies that have made it into the Trump inner circle through April 21, day 92 of his presidency, were manufacturers or financial firms - asset managers, insurers and banks ranging from Wall Street giants such as Citigroup to small community banks.

Financier Stephen Schwarzman, who chairs a presidential advisory forum of business leaders, is CEO of the Blackstone Group , the largest manager of private equity and real estate assets. He was spotted by the press pool aboard Air Force 1 on Feb. 3 when the president was traveling to Mar-a-Lago. Schwarzman also attended at least three meetings with Trump and other executives.

Almost all of Trump's meetings were group encounters with 10 or more executives sitting down with the president and White House officials in events billed as listening sessions, roundtable discussions or town halls.

A few were more intimate encounters, such as on March 18, when Ike Perlmutter, CEO of Marvel Entertainment, a Walt Disney Corp. subsidiary, met with the president in Mar-a-Lago before having dinner with the president, first lady Melania Trump and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross.

Perlmutter, however, was one of few executives from media companies seen by pool reporters in meetings with Trump.

Information technology firms, which enjoyed significant access to former President Barack Obama, have had less access to Trump than legacy manufacturers such as auto and steel makers. IBM CEO Ginni Rometty attended three meetings with Trump, but was one of only a few CEOs from big tech firms seen at the White House.

Manufacturers and financiers also enjoyed access to the White House under Obama, according to a Reuters review in December 2015 of White House visitor logs.

The recent Reuters review is not comprehensive since the press pool, though dogged and alert, may have missed some of Trump's meetings with business leaders.

The pool is a rotation of journalists from several outlets, including Reuters, who follow Trump and get briefings from White House officials on some, but not all of his meetings.

UPDATE 3-Ford profit beats estimates; maintains 2017 profit outlook - 路透新闻

{{20170427T135521.936+0000}}UPDATE 3-Ford profit beats estimates; maintains 2017 profit outlook(Adds details on quarter, updates stock price)

By Nick Carey

DETROIT, April 27 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co reported a lower quarterly net profit on Thursday but beat analyst expectations amid higher commodity, engineering and recall costs, and a drop in vehicle sales

Ford shares were down slightly at $11.54 in early trade.

The No. 2 U.S. automaker, which reiterated its pretax profit forecast for 2017, warned investors in late March that higher costs and lower sales volumes would hurt quarterly earnings.

Chief Financial Officer Bob Shanks told reporters at the company's headquarters in Dearborn, Michigan, that additional costs made this the "toughest quarter" for 2017.

Shanks said Ford's results for the rest of the year would be "about flat to a little bit better" compared with 2016.

The company's results come at a time of uncertainty for the U.S. auto industry following disappointing sales in March. [nL2N1HE0JN]

While sales of new vehicles have risen since the end of the Great Recession and hit 17.55 million units in 2016, analysts expect a slight sales decline in 2017. Ford said Thursday it expects industrywide sales to decrease a little this year and in 2018.

Ratings agencies have warned of worsening credit and there are concerns millions of nearly new leased vehicles due to flood the market over the next couple of years will depress used-car values and hurt U.S. automakers' sales.

Shanks said Ford's own used-car values at its finance arm were down 7 percent compared to the same quarter in 2016, but said customers' credit scores remained high and we "feel really good about where credit is."

"Clearly we're moving to a different stage of the cycle, but we think based on what we know that we've got it covered," he said.

Ford's costs during the first quarter were hurt by two recalls in North America, one to replace potentially faulty side door latches and the other for under-hood fire risks. The company said it expects to spend $295 million to fix those problems. [nL2N1H60PE]

Ford expects commodity costs to be around $1 billion higher this year. Shanks said around half of that will be due to higher steel prices.

Ford maintained its expectation for a full-year 2017 pretax profit of around $9 billion, down from a record of $10.4 billion in 2016.

The company reported a first-quarter net profit of $1.6 billion, or 40 cents a share, down 36 percent from $2.5 billion, or 61 cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts had, on average, expected earnings per share for the quarter of 35 cents.

Automotive revenue rose to $36.5 billion from $35.3 billion a year earlier. Analysts had expected $34.7 billion.

Automakers to meet with U.S. transportation, EPA chiefs - 路透新闻

{{20170426T211557.788+0000}}Automakers to meet with U.S. transportation, EPA chiefsBy David Shepardson

WASHINGTON, April 26 (Reuters) - Major automakers are set to meet Thursday with the head of the U.S. Transportation Department and Environmental Protection Agency as the agencies begin a review of federal fuel efficiency rules that are a major piece of the climate change policy enacted by the Obama administration.

U.S. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao and EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt will meet with board members Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a trade group representing General Motors Co , Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T>, Volkswagen AG , Ford Motor Co , Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV , Daimler AG and others, three people briefed on the matter said Wednesday.

An alliance spokeswoman declined to comment Wednesday, while the EPA and the Transportation Department did not immediately comment.

In March, President Donald Trump ordered a review of U.S. vehicle fuel-efficiency standards from 2022-2025 put in place by the Obama administration, effectively reopening a process the Obama administration had ended ahead of an April 2018 deadline.

In 2011, Obama said the rules would save motorists $1.7 trillion in fuel costs over the life of the vehicles, but cost the auto industry about $200 billion over 13 years. Automakers have said that cost estimate is low.

California regulators, who had worked with the Obama administration on the current national fuel efficiency standards, have opposed weakening the rules.

California has threatened to pursue tougher standards unilaterally and could mount a legal challenge. New York has also threatened a fight if the Trump administration rolls back the Obama standards.

Earlier this month, Mitch Bainwol, chief executive of the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, said automakers hope to reach a deal with California and the Trump administration over vehicle fuel efficiency standards.

Automakers want "rational, predictable, stable policy," not a rollback of the existing standards, Bainwol said.

The White House plans to hold negotiations with car companies and California over the fuel rules, but none have been scheduled since Trump met with autoamakers in Michigan on March 15 in a sesssion that included Chao and Pruitt.

Automakers need years of lead time to engineer future models and want uniform rules across all 50 states to reduce the cost and complexity of compliance.

Without a deal, automakers could be forced to meet one set of standards in California and about a dozen states that have adopted its rules and other rules in the rest of the country.

The Obama administration's rules, negotiated with automakers in 2011, were aimed at doubling average fleet-wide fuel efficiency to 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025. Under the 2011 deal, the 2022-2025 model year rules must be finalized by April 2018.

To receive The Day Ahead, Eikon users can register at [DAY/US]. Thomson One users can register at RT/DAY/US. All times in ET/GMT)

Google parent Alphabet Inc is expected to report a rise in quarterly revenue as advertisers spend more to reach out to a wider range of users. While advertising still accounts for the lion's share of revenue, the company has been looking to diversify its business beyond advertising and focus on other areas such as hardware and cloud business, where it sees a lot of growth potential. The company is expected to release its results after the closing bell.

Microsoft Corp is expected to report a rise in profit for the fourth straight quarter, according to Thomson Reuters data. Microsoft's flagship cloud product, Azure, and its Office 365 software suite have contributed to a burgeoning cloud business, and analysts expect growth to continue. The company's personal computing business should also see some improvement, helped by stabilizing demand.

Durable goods data for March is expected to show a slight decline to 1.2 percent from 1.8 percent in February. (0830/1230) Weekly jobless claims data is expected to show a higher reading of 245,000 from 244,000 in the previous week. (0830/1230) The Commerce Department will issue its "Advance Economic Indicators Report", which includes advance wholesale inventories and advance retail inventories excluding autos for March. (0830/1230) The National Association of Realtors will release its pending home sales for March. The monthly pending sales change is expected to have contracted 1 percent from a 5.5 percent rise in February. (1000/1400) The KC Fed Composite Index for April is expected soon after. (1100/1500)

The European Central Bank is scheduled to hold a press conference following the governing council monetary policy meeting in Frankfurt. (0930/1330) Intel Inc, the world's largest chipmaker, is expected to report a rise in quarterly revenue. Intel's $14.7 billion acquisition of Mobileye in March puts the company at the forefront of the driverless car industry. However, the company still faces a challenge in turning its core businesses around. Bright spots exist in the data center group business and Intel has so far been successful at maintaining its manufacturing lead in the chip industry.

Ford Motor Co is scheduled to report lower earnings per share in the first quarter and lower pretax profit in 2017 due to higher spending on commodities, warranties and investments as well as a drop in sales volumes, especially fleet sales. According to the company, U.S. auto industry sales in 2017 are likely to dip slightly to 17.7 million units from a record of 17.9 million in 2016. The company said sales should hit 17.5 million in 2018.

Amazon Inc is expected to report a rise in quarterly revenue, as the online retailer's dominance in the e-commerce marketplace, as well as continued investments in its data centers, warehouses and video content take hold. Amazon's continued cash burn, however, puts it at odds with its profit-seeking investors, and some analysts say that more disappointing operating income guidance could put some pressure on the stock.

Seeds and chemicals maker Dow Chemical Co, which is merging with DuPont, is expected to report a surge in first-quarter profit, mainly as its year-ago results included a $835 million charge to settle a decade-long lawsuit. The company has also said that improving economic growth worldwide would boost demand in its consumer-focused businesses such as packaging, consumer care and electronics. Investors will seek details of asset sales required to win regulatory clearance for Dow's merger with DuPont.

Package delivery company UPS reports first-quarter results before the bell. Much like its rival FedEx, UPS has seen its margins pressured by e-commerce deliveries, which typically are not as geographically concentrated as business deliveries. Conference call with Chairman and Chief Executive Officer David Abney and Chief Financial Officer Richard Peretz will follow.

Bristol-Myers Squibb Co will report first-quarter results before market opens. The drugmaker's result is likely to be hurt by a strong dollar. Investors will want a better picture of whether the company's cancer drug Opdivo can perform better in future studies in combination with other drugs and whether the company can rebound following trial setbacks for its flagship drug.

Johnson Controls Inc, which makes air conditioning and heating equipment and automotive batteries, is expected to report higher revenue and profit for the second quarter, helped by the acquisition of fire protection and security company Tyco International Plc last year. Investors will look for an update on the company's full-year financial forecast.

Raytheon Co, the maker of Patriot missile systems, is expected to report higher revenue for the first quarter ended March 31, helped by higher sales and better margins for its Intelligence and Information Systems segment, which provides software and engineering services for homeland security and other national and tactical intelligence systems. Investors will look for comments on 2017 financial forecast and business environment under President Donald Trump.

Drugmaker AbbVie Inc, which announced the failure of two key studies testing its cancer drug last week, is expected to report its results for the first quarter before the bell. The focus will be on AbbVie's flagship blockbuster treatment Humira as the company battles to block the launch of biosimilar competition from Amgen Inc.

Celgene Corp will report its first-quarter results before market opens. Analysts expect the U.S. biotechnology company's results to benefit from price increases of its flagship multiple myeloma drug, Revlimid, as well as its psoriasis drug Otezla. Drug pricing has become a lightning rod for criticism with several drugmakers coming under federal investigation for steep price increases.

CME Group is expected to report a rise in first-quarter profit helped by a fall in operating expenses. One of the world's biggest exchanges, plans to close two operations in London by year end after they ran up losses of more than $100 million as customers preferred using its U.S. operations.

Marathon Petroleum Corp is expected to report a loss in the first-quarter, compared with a year-ago profit, as it processed fewer barrels of crude oil during the quarter due to scheduled refinery maintenance activities. Investors will seek details of the refiner's outlook for inventories of refined products, and margins.

Under Armour Inc is scheduled to report its first-quarter results. The sportswear maker has forecast 2017 sales well below analysts' estimates, a sign that the company is finding it tough to replicate its past rapid growth as competition intensifies. Both Under Armour and larger rival Nike are having to contend with slowing demand for athletic apparel in North America, while Under Armour also seems to be losing out on innovation to Nike, whose VaporMax has quickly become one of 2017's most sought-after sneakers.

Boutique investment bank Lazard Ltd is expected to report a rise in first-quarter profit on higher fees from advising on deals. A slowdown in dealmaking amid worries about China and sliding oil prices weighed on Lazard's profit in the year-ago quarter. The firm is expected to show a 26 percent rise in fees from M&A advisory, when it reports results.

GoPro Inc is expected to report its second straight rise in quarterly revenue, as the action camera maker restructures itself in a bid to return to profitability. Amid production issues for its Hero 5 cameras and Karma drones, GoPro cut jobs and closed its entertainment business. The company will also incur costs from the restructuring in the quarter. Investors and analysts will look for guidance on GoPro's product roadmap for 2017.

GrubHub Inc is expected to report a rise in quarterly revenue. The company, which faces competition from Amazon's Prime Now and Yelp's Eat24, has been investing heavily in its delivery services to attract more people.

Potash Corp of Saskatchewan, the third-largest global producer of potash fertilizer, is expected to report a slightly more profitable first quarter than a year ago, as prices creep higher off multi-year lows. Any progress on completing a pending merger with rival Agrium will be of interest to investors. The deal is under consideration by U.S. and Canadian regulators.

Crescent Point Energy Corp is expected to post a smaller quarterly loss when it reports results. Separately, Canada's No. 1 oil and gas producer, Suncor Energy holds a conference call to discuss first quarter results, followed by its annual general meeting later in the day.

The province of Ontario will release its budget and is expected to balance its books in the current fiscal year after running deficits every year since 2008-09, when the economy was hit by the global financial crisis. Investors will look for any further moves to address affordability issues in Toronto's housing market after the provincial government announced a number of controlling measures this week, including a 15 percent tax on property purchases by foreign buyers in Toronto and the surrounding area.

Brazil's Producer Price Index for March is expected. (0900/1300) Mexico's trade balance figures for March is expected to show a slightly higher reading of $950 million from $684 million in February. (0900/1300)

Fiat Chrysler may add more self-driving supplier partners -CEO - 路透新闻

{{20170426T181335.044+0000}}Fiat Chrysler may add more self-driving supplier partners -CEOBy Agnieszka Flak and Paul Lienert

MILAN/DETROIT, April 26 (Reuters) - Fiat Chrysler Automobiles may seek more supplier partners to help it develop and build self-driving vehicles, Chief Executive Officer Sergio Marchionne said on Wednesday.

The Jeep and Ram brands are strong enough to exist as standalone entities outside FCA, Marchionne also said on a conference call with analysts after the company reported record first-quarter results. But he did not elaborate on whether there were any plans for a spin-off of either, like with Ferrari.

The automaker reported an 11 percent jump in first-quarter operating profit, boosted by strong sales in North America, its most profitable market. Shares jumped about 10 percent on the news. [nL8N1HY4VK]

FCA currently has a partnership with Alphabet Inc's Waymo self-driving unit. Marchionne said Waymo has an "unbeatable solution" to help build self-driving vehicles, including versions of the Chrysler Pacifica hybrid minivan, but that FCA is looking at additional partners.

"Between now and the next three years, we need to provide viable solutions to take people around," Marchionne said, citing Waymo's new test program in Phoenix offering ride sharing in self-driving Pacificas. [nL1N1HX00V]

But FCA is considering more partners "because banking all of our solutions on one possible outcome is going to be disastrous," Marchionne said. FCA continues to work with Waymo "in a very intense way," he said, but "we need to look at optionality in more than one dimension" to build self-driving cars.

FCA is retooling several U.S. plants to produce redesigned versions of the popular Jeep Wrangler and Ram 1500 pickup later this year and early next. Marchionne said the company would continue to produce several versions of the current models for several months in 2018 after the new versions begin production.

New models from premium brands Maserati and Alfa Romeo should help boost FCA's gross margins. Marchionne said Alfa, long a cash drain on the company, could be profitable in the fourth quarter, while Maserati has returned double-digit margins over the past three quarters. Both brands have launched new luxury utility vehicles in the United States.

Marchionne said FCA hopes to resolve emissions certification issues "in a few weeks" with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the California Air Resources Board.

In the meantime, he said FCA will try to meet future emissions regulations without relying so heavily on diesel engines, but with a combination of gasoline engines and electric motors.

Automakers want California to revise Volkswagen charging station plan - 路透新闻

{{20170426T173724.728+0000}}Automakers want California to revise Volkswagen charging station planBy David Shepardson

WASHINGTON, April 26 (Reuters) - Major automakers and other groups are raising objections to the way Volkswagen AG wants to spend $2 billion on electric vehicle infrastructure and projects, as part of the German automaker's atonement for diesel emissions cheating.

Volkswagen plans to install hundreds of EV charging stations nationwide as part of the 10-year plan. About $800 million of the total will be spent in California as part of a settlement with the government after the German automaker admitted to secretly installing cheating software in 580,000 diesel vehicles allowing them to emit excess pollution.

The California Air Resources Board is considering whether to approve the $200 million spending plan for the first 30 months and is reviewing the 120 comments submitted, said spokesman Dave Clegern.

Automakers object to the proposed locations of some charging stations in areas that already have many electric vehicles and have concerns about competitive advantages VW could get from the program. An environmental group said more of the stations should be built in low-income areas.

Also, Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T>, Honda Motor Co <7267.T> and Hyundai Motor Co <005380.KS> wrote a joint letter urging California to require Volkswagen to spend a "significant portion" of the money on hydrogen fuel cell fueling stations, saying the current commitment by California to get 100 such stations in place by 2020 is "not on track."

In its initial California spending plan, Volkswagen wants to allocate $120 million to build more than 400 highway and community EV charging stations by 2019 in high-traffic areas. Several automakers said in their comments that they would prefer that the new charging stations be installed instead in areas that have little electric vehicle traffic.

Ford Motor Co said it "has reservations about having a key electrification driver dependent on and ultimately controlled by one automotive competitor." Ford added VW should target areas where "demonstrated market interest does not already exist."

BMW AG said Volkswagen "should not be afforded an implicit comparative advantage through its ability to control day-to-day operations of consumer charging events" such as waiting times, pricing and billing.

Under the agreement with California and the Justice Department, funds spent on education and outreach must be brand-neutral and cannot feature Volkswagen vehicles. Charging stations must be accessible to all vehicles.

The three automakers who want Volkswagen to spend more on building hydrogen fueling stations are trying to sell fuel cell vehicles.

Volkswagen declined to comment on the automaker letters, but said its goal is to "make it easy for as many (zero emission vehicle) drivers as possible to enjoy the collective charging networks available."

The Sierra Club in a letter to California urged VW to "rethink its infrastructure proposal to include more investments in community-based charging in disadvantaged communities."

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency this month approved VW's initial $300 million spending plan for EV projects outside California through 2019, including having 450 charging stations in place by then.

VW will also launch a $44 million "Green City" initiative to pilot future concepts. It expects the city to be Sacramento.

In December, Volkswagen agreed to add three additional electric vehicle models in California by 2020 and must sell an average of 5,000 electric vehicles annually through 2025 in the state.

Automakers ask California to ease rules for self-driving car tests - 路透新闻

{{20170425T231350.476+0000}}Automakers ask California to ease rules for self-driving car testsBy David Shepardson

WASHINGTON, April 25 (Reuters) - Automakers on Tuesday urged the state of California to further ease its proposed regulations for autonomous vehicles, saying the state did not respond to their earlier objections by making enough revisions to its planned set of rules for self-driving cars.

At a public hearing in Sacramento monitored via webcast, automakers urged California to drop some additional proposed regulations and leave much of the oversight to the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. But safety and consumer advocates urged the state to adopt strict oversight, and an official from San Francisco said cities should have more local control.

A number of automakers have said they plan to begin deploying self-driving vehicles, some in commercial fleets, by 2020-2021.

Paul Scullion, a manager at the Association of Global Automakers, said California's proposed regulations go "too far."

The group opposes California's plan to require a permit to deploy autonomous vehicles, which must meet performance and design criteria. "We do not think requiring a permit to deploy is the right approach," Scullion said. Global Automakers said it opposes California's proposal that it could withdraw permits to deploy vehicles even if they met federal requirements.

Ron Medford, director of safety at Alphabet Inc's self-driving unit Waymo, urged California to quickly issue final rules "to provide manufacturers with the certainty that they need."

Brian Soublet, deputy director of the California Department of Motor Vehicles, said the agency will review written comments before unveiling final rules.

Andre Welch, a Ford Motor Co official, asked the state to lift the proposed prohibition on testing self-driving vehicles weighing more than 10,000 pounds, such as multi-passenger shuttles.

Existing California regulations require self-driving test vehicles to have conventional manual controls such as steering wheels and pedals, as well as a backup driver. California moved to change the rules as many states said they would allow testing of vehicles without conventional controls.

In March, California's Department of Motor Vehicles revised proposed rules to allow testing by the end of the year of autonomous vehicles without human backup drivers.

After objections from automakers, the proposal was revised to drop requirements that local communities approve testing and that companies generate a year of testing data before being allowed to deploy vehicles on public roads.

Among those who called for strict oversight of self-driving cars were Consumers for Auto Reliability and Safety. "We do not trust the auto manufacturers or the tech industry to protect the public in the absence of federal motors vehicle safety standards," said the group's president Rosemary Shahan.

The group Consumer Watchdog called for stricter state rules, noting that there were not yet any federal standards for self-driving cars. In written comments, the group said relying on federal standards would amount to a "meaningless house of cards."

In February, U.S. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao said she was reviewing self-driving vehicle guidance issued by the Obama administration. Those guidelines call on automakers to voluntarily submit details of self-driving vehicle systems to regulators in a 15-point "safety assessment."

California has proposed requiring companies submit a copy of a voluntary assessment submitted to NHTSA. David Strickland, a lawyer representing a group of self-driving advocates including Google, Ford and Uber [UBER.UL] opposed California's proposal, saying it effectively makes the assessment mandatory.

Tom Maguire, an official at San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency, said in some cases the proposed rules "rely too heavily on manufacturers' self certification of their safety technology." The agency believes cities should have the authority to deny deployment and determine when and how testing occurs.

General Motors Co official Paul Hemmersbaugh said California should drop plans to include separate privacy rules for driverless cars. The company said California's proposed liability rules could make automakers liable regardless of fault for any crash. He said that would be "unduly punitive" and could have a "chilling effect on testing and deployment of self-driving cars."

UPDATE 3-Greenlight Capital: GM investors will 'vote with their wallets' - 路透新闻

{{20170425T201947.342+0000}}UPDATE 3-Greenlight Capital: GM investors will 'vote with their wallets'(Adds GM statement, paragraph 2, adds GM closing stock price)

By Svea Herbst-Bayliss and Nick Carey

BOSTON/DETROIT, April 25 (Reuters) - Greenlight Capital, which has been pressuring General Motors Co to restructure its share class, said on Tuesday it believed the automaker's shareholders will vote in their best financial interests and support the hedge fund's two-class stock proposal and nominees for the board.

A representative for GM said Greenlight's proposal to create two classes of stock represents an "unacceptable risk and is not in the best interests of shareholders."

In a broad-ranging letter to investors about the first quarter of 2017, seen by Reuters, Greenlight also said it had added three new long positions and exited several short positions. Greenlight is run by billionaire investor David Einhorn.

Greenlight added bets on Conduent Inc , Perrigo Co Plc and an unnamed European financial institution. The hedge fund said it lost money on bets against three Canadian banks.

Greenlight has contended for some time that GM shares are undervalued and says it has a plan to boost the automaker's valuation.

A spokesman for Greenlight, Jonathan Gasthalter, declined to comment.

Einhorn proposed in late March that the U.S. automaker create one class of stock that pays a dividend and one that does not, but would be tied to GM's potential growth. [nL3N1H54NI]

No other GM shareholder has backed Einhorn's proposal, with Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc remaining conspicuously silent.

Moody's Investors Service and S&P Global Ratings said such a structure could hurt the automaker's credit rating.

Einhorn has since floated three nominees for GM's board and accused the automaker of misrepresenting his plan to rating agencies, a claim GM has rejected. [nL1N1HK0KL]

"We believe others recognize that the stock is deeply undervalued and when shareholders grasp the math and the extent of GM's behavior, they will vote with their wallets and for needed change at the Board level," the letter dated April 25 said.

GM shares closed 0.2 percent higher at $33.99 on Tuesday.

Greenlight also said that Tesla Inc , the electric carmaker that earlier this month briefly passed GM as the most valuable U.S. automaker [nL1N1HI1EI], was overvalued.

Greenlight said in the letter that sooner or later what it called the Tesla bubble was bound to burst. "There was no catalyst that we know of that burst the dot-com bubble in March 2000, and we don't have a particular catalyst in mind here," the letter said. "That said, the top will be the top and it's hard to predict when it will happen."

UPDATE 2-Continental to step up spending on electric car drives - 路透新闻

{{20170425T155636.683+0000}}UPDATE 2-Continental to step up spending on electric car drives* To invest 300 mln euros more in electric drives by 2021

* To reduce spending on hydraulic, mechanical engine parts

* Expects shift to electric cars after 2025

* Sees Powertrain revenues growing to 10 bln euros in 2019

(Adds analyst comment, detail and shares.)

BERLIN/FRANKFURT, April 25 (Reuters) - Car components maker Continental AG is set to invest an extra 300 million euros ($326 million) in electric drives by 2021 but also remains committed to its combustion-based powertrain business, the company said on Tuesday.

The world's second biggest supplier to vehicle manufacturers by sales, Continental is also strengthening its expertise in automotive electronics as customers such as Volkswagen , Daimler and Ford raise their investments in electric and self-driving technologies.

By raising spending on development of new products such as charging systems and battery management components, Continental may generate an additional 2 billion euros in sales by 2025, Chief Executive Elmar Degenhart said.

But the Hanover-based group also pledged to go on developing new products and systems for combustion-based power trains until at least 2025 when it expects demand for electric vehicles to start taking off on the back of continuing reductions in battery prices.

"Flexibility will be the name of the game in the next five to 10 years," Degenhart said on a conference call to outline its so-called Strategy 2020 plan for its Powertrain division.

Continental had said in January it was reviewing its strategy for the division after earnings at the business, whose products include transmission control units and fuel pumps, failed to meet expectations.

The company, which is also a leading supplier of tyres and other rubber products, expects the market share of fully or at least semi-electrified cars to grow to about 60 percent of all vehicles by 2030 from around 35 percent in 2025.

Demand for diesel cars has been declining across Europe, their main market, ever since the Volkswagen emissions scandal broke in September 2015, which led Continental to review strategy at the Powertrain division.

Some investors had hoped for management to make structural changes at the division such as a reduction in business lines or even a sale of some of the diesel-related products, which include common-rail fuel injection systems.

But Continental has refrained from making any radical changes even though the market share of diesel cars is falling faster than expected, pointing out that diesel-related sales account for less than 2 percent of the group's turnover.

"This is a slightly disappointing announcement for anyone who expected big change at Continental," Bernstein analyst Max Warburton said.

Continental's share price fell 2.7 percent to 201.15 euros, making the stock the biggest loser in Germany's benchmark DAX [0#.GDAXI] index.

The group said it expected the Powertrain business, which accounts for close to a fifth of the 40.5 billion euros of group revenues, to increase its annual sales to around 8 billion euros this year and 10 billion euros in 2019. ($1 = 0.9205 euros)

Automotive supplier breaks ground on rare new Detroit factory - 路透新闻

{{20170424T200004.884+0000}}Automotive supplier breaks ground on rare new Detroit factoryBy Nick Carey

DETROIT, April 24 (Reuters) - U.S. auto parts maker Flex-N-Gate will build a plant in Detroit in what local officials described on Monday as the first new investment by an automotive supplier in decades for Motor City, the cradle and former beating heart of the car industry.

"This is the largest automotive supplier investment in Detroit in more than 20 years," Mayor Mike Duggan said at a groundbreaking ceremony under a light blue spring sky on Detroit's northeast side. "We're starting to compete and win again."

Urbana, Illinois-based Flex-N-Gate will invest $95 million in the plant, which will employ 400-700 people and supply parts to Ford Motor Co . It is scheduled to open in the first quarter of 2018.

Flex-N-Gate owner Shahid Khan said Ford was the "great impetus" behind locating the plant in Detroit and said it aims to employ locals. Workers would earn up to $27 per hour including benefits and the plant will use state-of-the-art automated technology "in order to pay people a living wage," he said.

The supplier makes plastic exterior parts, especially front ends, and headlights.

A Ford spokeswoman said the company would not provide "specific production details at this time" on which models the plant's parts would be used.

Pakistan-born Khan, who also owns the National Football League's Jacksonville Jaguars, came to the United States decades ago to study mechanical engineering at the University of Illinois.

Auto plants once proliferated across Detroit, and many today are empty red-brick hulks. Only General Motors Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCA) still have operational plants in the city.

Over decades of decline, Detroit's population fell to 700,000 from a peak of 1.8 million people in 1950, reflected in the many vacant and decaying homes in the area around the future Flex-N-Gate plant.

Since going through bankruptcy earlier this decade, Detroit has experienced a slight renaissance with businesses and artists moving in.

The plight of American manufacturing, as well as immigration, were the focus of Republican President Donald Trump's election campaign. Trump has criticized automakers for building cars in Mexico and talked up announcements of U.S. investments by Ford, GM and FCA, including some that had been announced before he took office.

Khan said the decision to invest in Detroit predated Trump's presidency. But he said that in the U.S. automotive industry today, "you have to have a social conscience. You can do that and still make investments like this."

RPT-Tesla's big Model 3 bet rides on risky assembly line strategy - 路透新闻

{{20170424T110004.102+0000}}RPT-Tesla's big Model 3 bet rides on risky assembly line strategy(Repeats to additional customers with no changes to text)

By Alexandria Sage

April 24 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc Chief Executive Elon Musk took many risks with the technology in his company's cars on the way to surpassing Ford Motor Co's market value.

Now Musk is pushing boundaries in the factory that makes them.

Most automakers test a new model's production line by building vehicles with relatively cheap, prototype tools designed to be scrapped once they deliver doors that fit, body panels with the right shape and dashboards that don't have gaps or seams.

Tesla, however, is skipping that preliminary step and ordering permanent, more expensive equipment as it races to launch its Model 3 sedan by a self-imposed volume production deadline of September, Musk told investors last month.

Musk's decision underscores his high-risk tolerance and willingness to forego long-held industry norms that has helped Tesla upend the traditional auto industry. While Tesla is not the first automaker to try to accelerate production on the factory floor, no other rival is putting this much faith in the production strategy succeeding.

Musk expects the Model 3 rollout to help Telsa deliver five times its current annual sales volume, a key target in the automaker's efforts to stop burning cash.

"He's pushing the envelope to see how much time and cost he can take out of the process," said Ron Harbour, a manufacturing consultant at Oliver Wyman.

Investors are already counting on Tesla's factory floor success, with shares soaring 39 percent since January as it makes the leap from niche producer to mass producer in far less time than rivals.

There are caution signs, however. The production equipment designed to produce millions of cars is expensive to fix or replace if it doesn't work, industry experts say. Tesla has encountered quality problems on its existing low-volume cars, and the Model 3 is designed to sell in numbers as high as 500,000 vehicles a year, raising the potential cost of recalls or warranty repairs.

"It's an experiment, certainly," said Consumer Reports' Jake Fisher, who has done extensive testing of Tesla's previous Models S and X. Tesla could possibly fix errors quicker, speeding up the process, "or it could be they have unsuspected problems they'll have a hard time dealing with."

Musk discussed the decision to skip what he referred to as "beta" production testing during a call last month with an invited group of investors. Details were published on Reddit by an investor on the call. (https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/5zrb7t/tsla_investor_call_notes/).

He also said that "advanced analytical techniques" – code word for computer simulations - would help Tesla in advancing straight to production tooling.

Tesla declined to confirm details of the call or comment on its production strategy.

The auto industry's incumbents have not been standing still. Volkswagen AG's Audi division launched production of a new plant in Mexico using computer simulations of production tools – and indeed the entire assembly line and factory - that Audi said it believed to be an industry first. That process allowed the plant to launch production 30 percent faster than usual, Audi said.

An Audi executive involved in the Mexican plant launch, Peter Hochholdinger, is now Tesla's vice president of production.

MAKING TOOLS FASTER

Typically, automakers test their design with limited production using lower grade equipment that can be modified slightly to address problems. When most of the kinks are worked out, they order the final equipment.

Tesla's decision to move directly to the final tools is in part because lower grade, disposable equipment known as "soft tooling" ended up complicating the debut of the problem-plagued Model X SUV in 2015, according to a person familiar with the decision and Tesla's assembly line planning.

Working on a tight deadline, Tesla had no time to incorporate lessons learned from soft tooling before having to order the permanent production tooling, making the former's value negligible, the source said.

"Soft tooling did very little for the program and arguably hurt things," said the person.

In addition, Tesla has learned to better modify final production tools, and its 2015 purchase of a Michigan tooling company means it can make major equipment 30 percent faster than before, and more cheaply as well, the source said.

Financial pressure is partly driving Tesla's haste. The quicker Tesla can deliver the Model 3 with its estimated $35,000 base price to the 373,000 customers who have put down a $1000 deposit, the closer it can log $13 billion.

Tesla has labored under financial pressure since it was founded in 2003. The company has yet to turn an annual profit, and earlier this year Musk said the company was "close to the edge" as it look toward capital spending of $2-2.5 billion in the first half of 2017.

Tesla has since gotten more breathing room by raising $1.2 billion in fresh capital in March [nL2N1GU03D] and selling a five per cent stake to Chinese internet company Tencent Holdings Ltd <0700.HK> .

Musk has spoken to investors about his vision of an "alien dreadnought" factory that uses artificial intelligence and robots to build cars at speeds faster than human assembly workers could manage.

But there are limits to what technology can do in the heavily regulated car business. For example, Tesla will still have to use real cars in crash tests required by the U.S. government, because federal rules do not allow simulated crash results to substitute for data from a real car.

{{20170424T050001.735+0000}}Tesla's big Model 3 bet rides on risky assembly line strategyBy Alexandria Sage

April 24 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc Chief Executive Elon Musk took many risks with the technology in his company's cars on the way to surpassing Ford Motor Co's market value.

Now Musk is pushing boundaries in the factory that makes them.

Most automakers test a new model's production line by building vehicles with relatively cheap, prototype tools designed to be scrapped once they deliver doors that fit, body panels with the right shape and dashboards that don't have gaps or seams.

Tesla, however, is skipping that preliminary step and ordering permanent, more expensive equipment as it races to launch its Model 3 sedan by a self-imposed volume production deadline of September, Musk told investors last month.

Musk's decision underscores his high-risk tolerance and willingness to forego long-held industry norms that has helped Tesla upend the traditional auto industry. While Tesla is not the first automaker to try to accelerate production on the factory floor, no other rival is putting this much faith in the production strategy succeeding.

Musk expects the Model 3 rollout to help Telsa deliver five times its current annual sales volume, a key target in the automaker's efforts to stop burning cash.

"He's pushing the envelope to see how much time and cost he can take out of the process," said Ron Harbour, a manufacturing consultant at Oliver Wyman.

Investors are already counting on Tesla's factory floor success, with shares soaring 39 percent since January as it makes the leap from niche producer to mass producer in far less time than rivals.

There are caution signs, however. The production equipment designed to produce millions of cars is expensive to fix or replace if it doesn't work, industry experts say. Tesla has encountered quality problems on its existing low-volume cars, and the Model 3 is designed to sell in numbers as high as 500,000 vehicles a year, raising the potential cost of recalls or warranty repairs.

"It's an experiment, certainly," said Consumer Reports' Jake Fisher, who has done extensive testing of Tesla's previous Models S and X. Tesla could possibly fix errors quicker, speeding up the process, "or it could be they have unsuspected problems they'll have a hard time dealing with."

Musk discussed the decision to skip what he referred to as "beta" production testing during a call last month with an invited group of investors. Details were published on Reddit by an investor on the call. (https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/5zrb7t/tsla_investor_call_notes/).

He also said that "advanced analytical techniques" – code word for computer simulations - would help Tesla in advancing straight to production tooling.

Tesla declined to confirm details of the call or comment on its production strategy.

The auto industry's incumbents have not been standing still. Volkswagen AG's Audi division launched production of a new plant in Mexico using computer simulations of production tools – and indeed the entire assembly line and factory - that Audi said it believed to be an industry first. That process allowed the plant to launch production 30 percent faster than usual, Audi said.

An Audi executive involved in the Mexican plant launch, Peter Hochholdinger, is now Tesla's vice president of production.

MAKING TOOLS FASTER

Typically, automakers test their design with limited production using lower grade equipment that can be modified slightly to address problems. When most of the kinks are worked out, they order the final equipment.

Tesla's decision to move directly to the final tools is in part because lower grade, disposable equipment known as "soft tooling" ended up complicating the debut of the problem-plagued Model X SUV in 2015, according to a person familiar with the decision and Tesla's assembly line planning.

Working on a tight deadline, Tesla had no time to incorporate lessons learned from soft tooling before having to order the permanent production tooling, making the former's value negligible, the source said.

"Soft tooling did very little for the program and arguably hurt things," said the person.

In addition, Tesla has learned to better modify final production tools, and its 2015 purchase of a Michigan tooling company means it can make major equipment 30 percent faster than before, and more cheaply as well, the source said.

Financial pressure is partly driving Tesla's haste. The quicker Tesla can deliver the Model 3 with its estimated $35,000 base price to the 373,000 customers who have put down a $1000 deposit, the closer it can log $13 billion.

Tesla has labored under financial pressure since it was founded in 2003. The company has yet to turn an annual profit, and earlier this year Musk said the company was "close to the edge" as it look toward capital spending of $2-2.5 billion in the first half of 2017.

Tesla has since gotten more breathing room by raising $1.2 billion in fresh capital in March [nL2N1GU03D] and selling a five per cent stake to Chinese internet company Tencent Holdings Ltd <0700.HK> .

Musk has spoken to investors about his vision of an "alien dreadnought" factory that uses artificial intelligence and robots to build cars at speeds faster than human assembly workers could manage.

But there are limits to what technology can do in the heavily regulated car business. For example, Tesla will still have to use real cars in crash tests required by the U.S. government, because federal rules do not allow simulated crash results to substitute for data from a real car.

Toyota, Fiat Chrysler lead European car sales gain - 路透新闻

{{20170419T060014.880+0000}}Toyota, Fiat Chrysler lead European car sales gainPARIS, April 19 (Reuters) - European car sales rose 10.9 percent in March, led by buoyant demand in the region's top five markets and strong gains for Toyota <7203.T>, Fiat Chrysler and Nissan <7201.T>, according to industry data published on Wednesday.

Registrations rose to 1.937 million cars last month in the European Union and European Free Trade Association (EFTA) countries, Brussels-based industry body ACEA said, from 1.746 million a year earlier. That took first-quarter sales to 4.26 million cars, an 8.2 percent gain.

Toyota recorded the biggest monthly advance among major auto brands, with an 18.8 percent sales increase, closely followed by Fiat Chrysler with 18.2 percent and Nissan with 17.7 percent.

Volkswagen , the regional market leader, lost ground as its March registrations rose by a market-lagging 6.2 percent. France's PSA Group also underperformed with a 6.7 percent sales increase. Domestic rival Renault fared better, with a 14.4 percent gain in deliveries.

Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Spain all posted auto sales growth of between 7 percent and 18 percent, based on national registrations published earlier this month.

AUTOSHOW-Ford taking cautious approach to China electric vehicle market - 路透新闻

{{20170419T042712.758+0000}}AUTOSHOW-Ford taking cautious approach to China electric vehicle marketBy Joseph White

SHANGHAI, April 19 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co is taking a cautious approach to producing electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles for the Chinese market, citing uncertainty about consumer interest and government policy, despite a rush by carmakers to jump into the sector.

"You don't get any prizes for being first to market," said Trevor Worthington, Ford's vice president for product development in Asia Pacific. The challenge is to offer electrified vehicles "at the right time".

Ford earlier this month outlined plans to offer by 2025 hybrid or fully electric versions of all models built in China with its domestic joint venture partner, Chongqing Changan Automobile Co Ltd <000625.SZ>.

However, Ford executives said how many such vehicles are built and sold will depend on factors including government subsidies, regulatory policy and when battery-electric cars can match the cost and fast refuelling of gasoline vehicles.

During a meeting with reporters ahead of the Shanghai auto show on Wednesday, Worthington and Mazen Hammoud, the automaker's Asia Pacific powertrain director, said battery recharging would be a critical issue.

"Our goal needs to be something on the order of less than half an hour" to deliver an 80 percent charge, said Hammoud. Ultimately, "the goal needs to be similar to refuelling a gasoline vehicle. We are a long way from that."

Worthington also said Ford has a "team of people who meet with the government every week" to discuss the still evolving policies designed to promote vehicle electrification.

Reuters reported in March, citing industry executives, that China was considering easing proposed quotas aimed at producing more electric vehicles [nL3N1GQ4AT]. China has strongly supported and subsidized electric vehicles, but is gradually swapping out incentives for hard targets automakers must meet.

Worthington added Ford intended to bring to market what Chinese officials call "new energy vehicles" in a cost efficient way. He also expressed confidence the Chinese government would not push regulations that harm the industry.

"We provide huge employment," he said. "I don't think they are going to do things to make it impossible for the joint ventures to survive and thrive."

* Toyota re-thinks early electric car scepticism

By Jake Spring and Norihiko Shirouzu

SHANGHAI, April 18 (Reuters) - China's auto industry is charging ahead with aggressive plans to electrify cars even as policymakers scale back subsidies aimed at building sales from relatively low levels and consider tapping the brakes on sales quotas for plug-in cars.

Industry executives will use the Shanghai Motor Show, which opens to the public on Friday, to show off numerous battery electric and plug-in hybrid models. But behind the scenes, many are worried that batteries capable of delivering the same driving range as gasoline cars are still too expensive.

While green energy car sales have risen dramatically on the back of government policies, making China the world's leading market in this segment, electric cars have otherwise generated little consumer interest. They make up less than 2 percent of China's overall auto market of 28 million vehicles sold last year.

The dominant players in China's electric vehicle market are local, including state-owned Beijing Automotive Group, and Warren Buffett-backed BYD <1211.HK><002594.SZ>. Most cars are relatively cheap with limited range.

Beijing's central government has floated proposals to require automakers to substantially boost sales of so-called "new energy vehicles" (NEVs), or risk being penalized. But at the same time, it is cutting subsidies on green cars by a fifth this year, a move that could deepen manufacturers' losses on such models and discourage consumers from buying them.

Policymakers say reducing subsidies gradually to 2020 will wean automakers off government support and create a self-sustained market for electric vehicles. Industry officials and experts reckon tightening fuel efficiency regulations through 2020 will compel car makers to rely more on electrification to boost average fuel efficiency despite the drop-off in subsidies.

ACT NOW

Industry executives say long term, they expect China will insist on more electric vehicles, and to be ready, they must invest in developing those vehicles now.

"We're not holding back anything. The requirements whether they get changed or adjusted or whatever, the bottom line is clear that electrification is going to play a bigger and bigger role ... in China and other markets as well," Ford Motor Co CEO Mark Fields told reporters at a pre-show event this month.

Industry executives expect Beijing to ask automakers operating in China ultimately to generate green car credits equivalent to 12 percent of annual sales volume with NEVs by around 2020, with each green vehicle getting a different number of credits depending on the level of electrification and driving range.

Automakers and government officials have been bargaining over China's electric vehicle policy for years.

In the latest draft policy released in September, Beijing proposed a requirement that they generate credits equivalent to 8 percent of automakers' sales next year by selling battery electric or plug-in hybrid vehicles, rising to 10 percent in 2019 and 12 percent in 2020. More recently, the government has indicated that timetable could slip. [nL3N1GL230]

Whatever target the government sets, automakers would have little choice but to comply. China is the world's biggest auto market by far, and growth is set to continue this year, albeit at a slower 5 percent, according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers.

That is why even as automakers fight electric vehicle mandates in the United States, they are scrambling to develop more plug-in electric hybrids and electric battery cars for China.

NEW MODELS

Ford, for example, says that by 2018 it will launch in China a plug-in hybrid sedan called the Mondeo Energi, a version of the low-volume Ford Fusion Energi offered in the United States. It also plans to bring an all-electric sport-utility vehicle to China over the next five years.

General Motors Co , one of the largest automakers in the Chinese market, plans to launch at least 10 NEVs by 2020. To support the growth of its NEV line-up, GM has built a battery assembly plant in Shanghai which should be ready to deliver battery packs next year.

Volkswagen plans to have 13 additional NEVs by 2020 based on its current generation of technology, following on plug-in hybrid versions of the Phideon sedan, due to be unveiled later on Tuesday, and the Audi A6L sedan. The VW brand aims to further launch 10 electric vehicles between 2020 and 2025.

The German manufacturer also hopes to form a joint venture just for NEVs with Anhui Jianghuai Automobile Group (JAC) <600418.SS>, and any models from that partnership would be on top of those plans, a spokesman told Reuters. VW said in January the first VW-JAC car could be produced next year.

China's drive for electric vehicles, driven in part to combat often suffocating urban smog, has put pressure on Japan's Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T> to re-think its earlier scepticism about battery-electric technology. Toyota has said it will locally build plug-in hybrids and sell them in China, starting in 2018, although it has not said when all-electric car models would hit Chinese showrooms.

To be sure, even as automakers renew commitments to produce more NEVs, it's not clear how aggressively they would push those cars in the marketplace.

"All automakers in China are still trying to understand the implications of the more stringent fuel efficiency regulations and whether to increase production of qualifying NEVs or purchase NEV credits from other automakers, including their partners," said James Chao, Shanghai-based Asia-Pacific chief of consulting firm IHS Markit Automotive.

Uber's vice president of global vehicle programs leaves company - 路透新闻

{{20170418T014535.081+0000}}Uber's vice president of global vehicle programs leaves companyApril 17 (Reuters) - Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] said on Monday that its vice president of global vehicle programs, who played a role in the company's self-driving car program, has left the company.

Neither Uber nor the executive, Sherif Marakby, said why he was leaving. The former Ford Motor Co executive joined Uber just last April to help with its autonomous vehicle project in Pittsburgh.

"Self-driving is one of the most interesting challenges I've worked on in my career, and I'm grateful to have contributed to what will soon be a safer future for everyone," Marakby said in an emailed statement.

The departure is the latest of several high-profile exits from the ride-hailing company. [nL3N1HJ5KH]

Uber has been rocked by a number of setbacks lately, including accusations of sexual harassment from a former female employee and a video showing Chief Executive Travis Kalanick harshly berating an Uber driver.

It has also been sued by Alphabet Inc's Waymo unit for stealing some of its self-driving technology, an accusation Uber denies.

The company is seeking a chief operating officer to help Kalanick manage it, repair its tarnished image and improve its culture.

Separately, the privately held company made public some of its financials on Friday, revealing that it was generating more revenue but still making large losses. [nL1N1HM0RM]

RPT-Chinese automakers SAIC, Geely turn up heat on global rivals - 路透新闻

{{20170417T220024.549+0000}}RPT-Chinese automakers SAIC, Geely turn up heat on global rivals(Repeats item first published on Monday with no changes to text)

By Joseph White and Norihiko Shirouzu

SHANGHAI, April 18 (Reuters) - Global automakers face fresh threats to their profits in China from domestic automakers SAIC and Geely, which are launching new models and marketing strategies to challenge better-known foreign brands in the world's largest car market.

The country's biggest automaker, Shanghai Automotive Industry Corp (SAIC), wants to double sales of its fully owned domestic brands this year - albeit from a low base - executives told a group of reporters on Monday.

"China success is the base of overseas market success," said Zhang Liang, product portfolio planning director for SAIC Motor's passenger vehicles operation.

Zhang said SAIC's MG and Roewe - brands based on technology acquired from bankrupt British car maker MG Rover - plan a total of five car models and nine sport utility vehicles, and would aim to offer quality comparable to global brands such as Nissan, but at a lower price.

A concept shown to reporters for an MG sports coupe it will exhibit at this week's Shanghai auto show could pass for a Jaguar.

"I worry for them," Zhang said of the global brands. "You see local technology getting stronger and stronger."

SAIC, controlled by Shanghai's municipal government, has toiled for years in the shadow of its foreign partners, Volkswagen AG and General Motors Co , who are obliged by Beijing to form joint ventures with a local automaker for their China operations.

Those two joint ventures accounted for about 16.5 percent of the Chinese passenger car market last year, compared with just 1.3 percent share for SAIC's own brands.

However, those 50-50 alliances with GM and VW have generated floods of cash that SAIC has ploughed into hiring European designers to give its future MG vehicles more flair.

It has spent 2.25 billion yuan ($327 million) on new research and engineering facilities in Shanghai, where company engineers are working with the same suppliers as their foreign rivals to improve the safety, quality and reliability of MG and Roewe models.

In one lab, Roewe and MG vehicles are shaken on machines that simulate rough roads. In another lab, cars are frozen, then subjected to broiling simulated desert heat, while engineers evaluate the performance of engines and climate control systems.

With the help of suppliers such as Mobileye NV, an Israeli autonomous vehicle firm Intel is buying for $15 billion, SAIC plans to offer advanced safety systems such as automatic emergency braking, as established rivals do.

EUROPEAN STYLING, CHINESE COSTS

Rival Zhejiang Geely Holding Group [GEELY.UL], through its ownership of Swedish luxury automaker Volvo Cars, is pursuing a similar strategy of marrying European styling and developed market safety and quality engineering to Chinese production costs, primarily through its new Lynk & Co brand, company executives told Reuters.

Geely on Sunday evening staged an elaborate party at Shanghai's West Bund Art Center to debut the production version of its forthcoming sport utility vehicle and a prototype for its "03" model, a sedan to go with a planned sporty coupe.

Geely president An Conghui told Reuters in an interview that Lynk & Co would allow Geely to compete head-on with global automakers both in China and overseas. Lynk & Co has said it plans to sell vehicles in the United States and Europe after launching in China.

Geely brand models currently are priced up to about 150,000 yuan ($22,000). Lynk & Co cars should sell for up to 250,000 yuan - in the heart of the mainstream segment that accounts for about 45 percent of Chinese passenger vehicle sales and that is now dominated by foreign brands such as Volkswagen, GM, Ford Motor Co , Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T> and Honda Motor Co Ltd <7267.T>. The brand could move higher in price, or lower, depending on how consumers respond, he said.

"It is not easy for Chinese makers to break into this segment in the past," An said. "But now with Lynk & Co in place we want to really go into this segment and compete with foreign brands."

SAIC, Geely and other rising Chinese automakers such a Great Wall <601633.SS> and Chery Automobile Co Ltd [CHERY.UL] have a long way to go to achieve the sales levels of the U.S., European, Japanese and Korean brands in China.

Chinese consumers are wary of the quality and safety of domestic brand vehicles, and dispelling those fears would take time and money, SAIC and Geely executives said.

Lynk & Co will offer what executives called a "lifetime" warranty, and also plan to allow consumers to pay for access to a vehicle on a subscription basis - by the month or mile - instead of committing to a purchase. ($1 = 6.8830 Chinese yuan renminbi)

Chinese automakers SAIC, Geely turn up heat on global rivals - 路透新闻

{{20170417T134246.447+0000}}Chinese automakers SAIC, Geely turn up heat on global rivalsBy Joseph White and Norihiko Shirouzu

SHANGHAI, April 17 (Reuters) - Global automakers face fresh threats to their profits in China from domestic automakers SAIC and Geely, which are launching new models and marketing strategies to challenge better-known foreign brands in the world's largest car market.

The country's biggest automaker, Shanghai Automotive Industry Corp (SAIC), wants to double sales of its fully owned domestic brands this year - albeit from a low base - executives told a group of reporters on Monday.

"China success is the base of overseas market success," said Zhang Liang, product portfolio planning director for SAIC Motor's passenger vehicles operation.

Zhang said SAIC's MG and Roewe - brands based on technology acquired from bankrupt British car maker MG Rover - plan a total of five car models and nine sport utility vehicles, and would aim to offer quality comparable to global brands such as Nissan, but at a lower price.

A concept shown to reporters for an MG sports coupe it will exhibit at this week's Shanghai auto show could pass for a Jaguar.

"I worry for them," Zhang said of the global brands. "You see local technology getting stronger and stronger."

SAIC, controlled by Shanghai's municipal government, has toiled for years in the shadow of its foreign partners, Volkswagen AG and General Motors Co , who are obliged by Beijing to form joint ventures with a local automaker for their China operations.

Those two joint ventures accounted for about 16.5 percent of the Chinese passenger car market last year, compared with just 1.3 percent share for SAIC's own brands.

However, those 50-50 alliances with GM and VW have generated floods of cash that SAIC has ploughed into hiring European designers to give its future MG vehicles more flair.

It has spent 2.25 billion yuan ($327 million) on new research and engineering facilities in Shanghai, where company engineers are working with the same suppliers as their foreign rivals to improve the safety, quality and reliability of MG and Roewe models.

In one lab, Roewe and MG vehicles are shaken on machines that simulate rough roads. In another lab, cars are frozen, then subjected to broiling simulated desert heat, while engineers evaluate the performance of engines and climate control systems.

The long, rough ride ahead for "Made in America" - 路透新闻

{{20170417T110011.248+0000}}The long, rough ride ahead for "Made in America"By Nick Carey

RUSTON, Louisiana, April 17 (Reuters) - Mini motorcycle and go-kart maker Monster Moto made a big bet on U.S. manufacturing by moving assembly to this Louisiana town in 2016 from China.

But it will be a long ride before it can stamp its products "Made in USA."

The loss of nearly one out four U.S. factories in the last two decades means parts for its bike frames and engines must be purchased in China, where the manufacturing supply chain moved years ago.

"There's just no way to source parts in America right now," said Monster Moto Chief Executive Alex Keechle during a tour of the company's assembly plant. "But by planting the flag here, we believe suppliers will follow."

Monster Moto's experience is an example of the obstacles American companies face as they, along with President Donald Trump, try to rebuild American manufacturing. U.S. automakers and their suppliers, for example, have already invested billions in plants abroad and would face an expensive and time-consuming transition to buy thousands of American-made parts if President Trump's proposed "border tax" on imported goods were to become law.

When companies reshore assembly to U.S. soil – in Monster Moto's case that took two years to find a location and negotiate support from local and state officials – they are betting their demand will create a local supply chain that currently does not exist.

For now, finding U.S.-based suppliers "remains one of the top challenges across our supplier base," said Cindi Marsiglio, Wal-Mart Stores Inc's vice president for U.S. manufacturing and sourcing. Wal-Mart partnered with Monster Moto and several other U.S. companies in a drive to increase spending on American-made goods by $250 billion by 2023 in response to consumer demand for American-made goods.

Their experience has shown Americans' patriotic shopping habits have limits, namely when it comes to price.

Take Monster Moto's bikes, which sell for between $249 to $749. Keechle, the CEO, says he can't raise those prices for fear his price sensitive prospective customers will turn to less expensive rivals made in China.

"Consumers won't give you a free pass just because you put 'Made in USA' on the box," Keechle says. "You have to remain price competitive."

Keeping a sharp eye on labor costs in their factory is one thing these U.S. manufactures can control. They see replacing primarily lower-skilled workers on the assembly line with robots on American factory floors as the only way to produce here in a financially viable, cost-competitive way. It's a trend that runs against the narrative candidate Donald Trump used to win the U.S. Presidency.

Since taking office, Trump has continued promises to resurrect U.S. manufacturing's bygone glory days and bring back millions of jobs. On March 31, Trump directed his administration to clamp down on countries that abuse trade rules in a bid to end to the "theft of American prosperity." [nW1N1GM01Z]

But it's more complicated on the ground for companies like Monster Moto.

"It's almost as if people think you can just unplug manufacturing in one part of the world and plug it in to the U.S. and everything's going to be fine," said David Abney, Chief Executive Officer of package delivery company United Parcel Service Inc , which helped Monster Moto reconfigure its supply chain to bring its Chinese-made parts to Ruston.

"It's not something that happens overnight," he said.

A White House official said that the Trump administration's efforts to encourage manufacturers to reshore production will be focused on cutting regulations and programs to provide new skills to manufacturing workers.

"We recognize that the manufacturing jobs that come back to America might not all look like the ones that left," a White House official said, "and we are taking steps to ensure that the American workforce is ready for that."

MAKING ROBOTS GREAT AGAIN

In Monster Moto's cavernous warehouse in Ruston, boxes of imported parts that are delivered at one end then become bikes on a short but industrious assembly line of a few dozen workers.

A solitary, long-bearded worker by the name of Billy Mahaffey fires up the bikes to test their engine and brakes before a small group of workers puts them in boxes declaring: "Assembled in the USA."

Helped by that label, Monster Moto has experienced a recent boom in demand from major customers that include Wal-Mart. The company expects to double production to 80,000 units and increase its assembly workers - who make $13 to $15 an hour - to 100 from around 40 in 2017.

The most likely components Monster Moto could produce in America first are black, welded-metal frames for bikes and go-karts, but they would have to automate production because human welders would be too expensive.

"We can't just blow up our cost structure," said Monster Moto President Rick Sukkar. "The only way to make it work in America is with robotics."

The same principle applies for much larger manufacturers, such as automotive supplier Delphi Automotive PLC's . Chief Financial Officer Joe Massaro told analysts in February that 90 percent of the company's hourly workforce is in "best-cost countries."

When asked about shifting production to the United States from Mexico, Massaro said depending on what happens to trade rules "it would have to be much more of the sort of the automated type manufacturing operations just given… the labor differential there."

That trend is already showing up in data compiled by Economic Policy Institute, a Washington-based think-tank. According to senior economist Rob Scott, not only did America lose 85,000 factories, or 23.5 percent of the total, from 1997 to 2014, but the average number of workers in a U.S. factory declined 14 percent to 44 in 2014 from 1997. According to Scott, much of the decline in workers was due to automation. For a graphic, click http://tmsnrt.rs/2oaz5mD

"We're going to see more automation in this country because it makes good sense economically for every company," said Hal Sirkin, a managing director at the Boston Consulting Group. "You can spend a lot of time bemoaning it, but that's not going to change."

Manufacturers say automated production requires fewer, but more skilled workers such as robot programmers and operators. The National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) estimates because of the "skills gap" there are 350,000 unfilled manufacturing jobs today in a sector that employs over 12 million people.

In Ruston, Mayor Ronny Walker bet on Monster Moto by guaranteeing the company's lease because he wants to diversify the city's economy, and envisions suppliers setting up alongside Monster Moto's assembly plant.

"Could it take a long time to bring manufacturing back here? Sure," he says. "But you have to start somewhere."

UPDATE 3-Apple receives permit in California to test self-driving cars -DMV - 路透新闻

{{20170414T234657.869+0000}}UPDATE 3-Apple receives permit in California to test self-driving cars -DMV(Adds detail on Apple's letter to NHTSA)

By Jessica Resnick-Ault

April 14 (Reuters) - Apple Inc has secured a permit to test autonomous vehicles in California, fueling speculation that it is working on self-driving car technology in a crowded arena of companies hoping to offer those cars to the masses.

The permit allows it to conduct test drives in three vehicles with six drivers, the state Department of Motor Vehicles said on Friday. The vehicles are all 2015 Lexus RX450h, according to the DMV.

Although it has never openly acknowledged it is looking into building an electric car, Apple has recruited dozens of auto experts in recent years, and the permit pulls the curtain back a bit on any possible plan.

"This does confirm what's long been rumored: that Apple is at least toying with the idea of getting into the autonomous game in some capacity," said Chris Theodore, president of consultancy Theodore & Associates, and a former vice president at Ford Motor Co and Chrysler.

The permit does not mean Apple is definitely building a car. "This is not necessarily automobiles as initially rumored, but software or possibly hardware associated with autonomous technology," Theodore said.

An Apple spokesman declined to comment directly on the filing, pointing back to a statement the company made in November when it wrote to the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) on the subject of regulating self-driving vehicles.

"The company is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation," Apple's director of product integrity, Steve Kenner, wrote in that five-page letter. [nL1N1DY0GP]

Apple executives have been coy about their interest in cars. Chief Executive Tim Cook has suggested that Apple wants to move beyond integration of Apple smartphones into vehicle infotainment systems. [nFWN1CV146]

Apple joins a growing list of traditional carmakers, technology companies, and small start ups to test drive cars in California - all vying to be the first to have commercially viable vehicles on the roads.

Companies that have been issued permits also include Alphabet Inc's Google unit, Ford Motor Co , Volkswagen AG , Daimler AG , Tesla Motors Inc and General Motors Co .

Many companies have said the first cars will launch in 2020 but some experts believe it may take much longer due to regulatory challenges.

Shares of Apple closed down 0.5 percent at $141.05 on Thursday.

Ford Q1 China sales slump more than one-fifth as tax cut rolled back - 路透新闻

{{20170413T040507.191+0000}}Ford Q1 China sales slump more than one-fifth as tax cut rolled back* Ford March sales down 21 pct; Jan-March down 21 pct

* China Q1 overall vehicle sales up 7 pct

* Over 70 pct of Ford vehicles benefited from tax cut

By Jake Spring

BEIJING, April 13 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co said on Thursday that its China vehicle sales fell by 21 percent in the first quarter compared with a year ago, after a tax cut on small-engined vehicles was rolled back.

Ford trailed many of its competitors in China in the first quarter with Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T>, Honda Motor Co Ltd <7267.T> and others disclosing sales increases and the automakers' association reporting a 7 percent rise for overall sales.

Many in the industry had feared that consumers rushing to buy small-engine cars before a tax increase at the end of 2016 would lead to weaker sales in the first few months of 2017.

Roughly 70-75 percent of Ford cars sold in China qualified for the tax cut, which applies to vehicles with engine capacity of 1.6 litres or below, Ford Chief Executive Mark Fields told reporters in Shanghai on Saturday ahead of the release of Ford's March figures.

"We've always planned for the fact that (in) the first quarter there would be payback from the pull forward of sales into the fourth quarter (before the incentive was reduced)," Fields said, adding that sales would improve for the rest of the year.

Ford's March sales fell 21 percent year-on-year to 90,457.

The purchase tax for small-engined cars climbed to 7.5 percent this year from 5 percent in 2016 after the government stepped in to stimulate slumping sales. The tax will rise to the normal 10 percent rate next year.

Ford said in a written statement that its sales of vehicles that do not benefit from the purchase tax incentive rose by double digits.

UPDATE 5-In proxy fight, Greenlight says GM misrepresented its stock plan - 路透新闻

{{20170412T225537.979+0000}}UPDATE 5-In proxy fight, Greenlight says GM misrepresented its stock plan* Greenlight: GM misled ratings agencies on two-class share plan

* GM says any such claim "baseless and irresponsible"

* S&P Global Ratings sticks to original assessment of proposal

* No other GM investors have yet backed Greenlight proposal

* Greenlight slate of GM board nominees includes Leo Hindery

(Adds BREAKINGVIEWS item to Related Content)

By Nick Carey and Svea Herbst-Bayliss

DETROIT/BOSTON, April 12 (Reuters) - Greenlight Capital nominated three directors to General Motors Co's board on Wednesday and accused the company of misrepresenting to ratings agencies the prominent hedge fund's proposal to split the automaker's common stock into two classes.

Greenlight manager David Einhorn told Reuters on Wednesday the automaker has refused to allow him to present his proposal to credit agencies for a formal review of how the plan would affect the company's credit risk.

"We think the credit rating process has been unfairly manipulated," Einhorn said. "We call on GM to allow us to work directly with the credit rating agencies."

GM fired back that any suggestion the automaker had failed to share Greenlight's proposal in full with the ratings agencies was "baseless and irresponsible."

Einhorn went public with a proposal in late March that the U.S. automaker create one class of stock that pays a dividend and one that does not, but would be tied to GM's potential growth. [nL3N1H54NI]

The move would lower the company's cost of capital, improve financial flexibility and boost market capitalization by as much as $38 billion, Einhorn said.

No other GM shareholder has yet backed Einhorn's proposal, with Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc remaining conspicuously silent.

GM has rebuffed Einhorn's proposal, saying it would not help the automaker "sell more cars, drive higher profitability, or generate greater cash flow." Both Moody's and Standard & Poor's have declared such a structure could hurt its credit rating.

When asked whether Einhorn's claims on Wednesday changed anything, an S&P Global Ratings spokesman referred Reuters to the agency's previous opinion from late March.

The views of the rating agencies are a key element in the proxy fight that will play out over the next several weeks, unless GM and Einhorn can reach a settlement.

In the interview, Einhorn said his plan would also allow GM to preserve more of its cash reserves, at a time when some analysts are concerned the U.S. auto industry is heading into a cyclical slowdown.

"Our proposal is an elegant way to unlock that kind of value without drawing on the cash resources of the company," Einhorn said.

Greenlight Capital has owned GM shares on and off for five years and now has a 4.9 percent stake, including options.

GM stock has performed poorly versus its peers and compared with the broader market. GM shares traded on Wednesday afternoon at $34 - just a dollar above the IPO price when the company went public in 2010 after a government-led bankruptcy.

DISPUTE INTENSIFIES

The disagreement became a full-fledged proxy fight on Wednesday as Greenlight said GM's advisers had no interest "in performing an objective analysis" of Einhorn's proposal.

In a regulatory filing, Greenlight said GM had then "substantially altered" the term sheet for its proposal before handing it to the ratings agencies and that this different version included "various misrepresentations" of the plan.

GM said in a statement: "The rating agencies' public statements issued regarding the Greenlight proposal clearly indicate that they understood the idea in all its facets, and would represent a credit negative if implemented. Any suggestion to the contrary is baseless and irresponsible."

Greenlight on Wednesday nominated former AT&T Broadband Chief Executive Officer Leo Hindery, longtime Greenlight research director Vinit Sethi and Consol Energy Inc Chairman William Thorndike to the automaker's board of directors.

Einhorn himself was not on the proposed slate.

Sethi was involved in talks with GM on Greenlight's proposal going back to last September.

Einhorn's fund has returned an annualized 16 percent since the firm's launch in 1996 but its gains have been more muted recently with an increase of only 1.5 percent in the first three months of 2017.

Einhorn's fight with GM marks the first time since taking on Apple Inc in 2013 that the closely watched fund manager has pressed management publicly to make changes, taking a page from the playbooks of so-called activist hedge funds like Jana Partners and Pershing Square Capital Management.

GM has not yet published a date for its annual shareholder's meeting, but in previous years it has usually been held in the first half of June.

A majority of investors surveyed by Evercore ISI just after Einhorn disclosed his proposal said it would not raise GM's value. [nL2N1H823X]

Greenlight's filing comes just two days after luxury electric car maker Tesla Inc surpassed GM to become the highest-valued U.S. automaker despite selling around 76,000 vehicles last year to GM's 10 million. [nL1N1HI1EI]

UPDATE 2-Tesla's Musk tells disgruntled shareholders: Buy Ford - 路透新闻

{{20170412T203029.897+0000}}UPDATE 2-Tesla's Musk tells disgruntled shareholders: Buy Ford(Adds tweets from Tesla CEO Elon Musk about Ford, investors, updates share price)

By Alexandria Sage and Nick Carey

SAN FRANCISCO/DETROIT, April 12 (Reuters) - A group of Tesla Inc investors has urged the luxury electric car maker to add two new independent directors to its board, without ties to Chief Executive Elon Musk, to "provide a critical check on possible dysfunctional group dynamics."

A defiant Musk took to Twitter on Wednesday afternoon to suggest the investors buy stock in Ford Motor Co instead. The Ford family controls the Detroit automaker through two classes of stock.

In a letter dated Monday, five investment groups including the California State Teachers Retirement System, Hermes Equity Ownership Services and CtW Investment Group urged Tesla to have all of its directors re-elected annually.

"We expect that as companies make the transition to publicly-traded status, the governance structures and practices in place at the time of the IPO will evolve to align with the company's changing strategy," the letter reads. "However, Tesla's seven-member board is largely unchanged from its pre-IPO days."

Led by the enigmatic Musk, Tesla recently became the most valuable U.S. car company, passing General Motors Co for the top spot. [nL1N1HI1EI]

Tesla's market value has since slipped to just shy of GM's. As of Wednesday, the market cap of the Silicon Valley automaker was $50.3 billion, while GM's was $50.8 billion.

"This investor group should buy Ford stock," Musk posted on Twitter on Wednesday afternoon. "Their governance is amazing..."

Musk then said on Twitter that he would follow up soon on an earlier promise to appoint more independent directors, "but this (investor) group has nothing to do with it."

Over the past month, Tesla stock has surged 35 percent as investors bet that Musk will revolutionize the automobile and energy industries. The shares closed down 3.8 percent at $296.84 in Wednesday's trading on Nasdaq, however.

Among those on Tesla's board is Kimbal Musk, the CEO's brother, and Brad Buss, who served as chief financial officer at SolarCity Corp, which the electric car maker acquired last year.

The $2 billion stock deal for the money-losing installer of residential solar power systems, prompted a 13 percent fall in Tesla's share price after Musk outlined it last June.

The Palo Alto, California-based company is rushing to launch its mass-market Model 3 sedan in the second half of this year and quickly ramp up its factory to hit a production target of 500,000 cars per year in 2018.

Last year Tesla sold 76,230 vehicles, missing its target of at least 80,000 cars sold. By comparison, GM sold 10 million cars and Ford sold 6.7 million.

Automakers unveil new SUVs at New York auto show but also focus on EVs - 路透新闻

{{20170412T195135.022+0000}}Automakers unveil new SUVs at New York auto show but also focus on EVsBy David Shepardson

NEW YORK, April 12 (Reuters) - Automakers unveiled new sport utility vehicles at the New York auto show on Wednesday, boosted by low fuel prices and increasing demand, but said they were also moving ahead with new U.S. electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles for the U.S. market.

Ford Motor Co showed off a redesigned Lincoln Navigator luxury SUV with an aluminum body that cuts nearly 200 pounds (90.72 kg) off its weight.

Subaru Corp <7270.T> unveiled a concept seven-passenger Ascent SUV Concept, meanwhile, saying it planned to start selling the large SUV in 2018, and General Motors Co showed off a new larger seven-passenger Buick Enclave.

Not to be outdone, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV took the wraps off a new limited version of its Jeep Grand Cherokee SUV, with 707 horsepower and a 6.2-liter V-8 engine, while Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T> showed off a concept SUV aimed at outdoorsy millennials called "FT-4X" for "Future Toyota."

SUVs accounted for nearly 40 percent of total U.S. vehicle sales in 2016, up from 32.6 percent in 2014, as a growing number of Americans ditched cars for more fuel-thirsty larger vehicles.

President Donald Trump has said he will revisit strict 2022-2025 vehicle fuel efficiency requirements set by the Obama administration, a move that may reduce future requirements.

But after investing substantial sums in electric vehicles, automakers say they are not backing off their plans to compete in the EV market segment.

Ford alone is investing $4.5 billion to introduce 13 new electric and hybrid vehicles over the next five years, Chief Executive Officer Mark Fields told reporters at the New York show.

Honda Motor Co <7267.T> unveiled a new Clarity electric vehicle and plug-in hybrid version at the show and the Japanese automaker said it sees electric or hybrid vehicles accounting for two thirds of all sales worldwide by 2030.

Nissan Motor Co <7201.T>, meanwhile, said it will unveil a new version of its electric Leaf later this year with a longer battery range than its current version.

Volkswagen , the world's biggest automaker, said it will sell at least three new electric vehicles by 2020, partly due to an agreement with California aimed at settling its diesel emissions cheating scandal.

Automakers hope to reach U.S. deal on 2025 vehicle emissions - 路透新闻

{{20170412T004721.381+0000}}Automakers hope to reach U.S. deal on 2025 vehicle emissionsBy David Shepardson

NEW YORK, April 11 (Reuters) - A trade group for automakers said on Tuesday it hopes to reach a deal with California and the Trump administration over vehicle fuel efficiency standards.

Mitch Bainwol, chief executive of the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a trade group representing General Motors Co , Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T>, Volkswagen AG and others, said at a forum ahead of the New York auto show that automakers were not seeking a rollback of existing standards.

"What we want is rational, predictable, stable policy," he said. Automakers hope "that over time responsible parties will come together and have an honest conversation about what the data is."

In March, President Donald Trump ordered a review of U.S. vehicle fuel-efficiency standards from 2022-2025 put in place by the Obama administration, saying they were too tough on the auto industry.

But California opposed weakening the rules, threatened to pursue tougher standards unilaterally and could mount a legal challenge. New York has also threatened a fight.

The White House plans to hold negotiations with car companies and California. A deal would remove uncertainty for automakers, who need years of lead time to engineer future models and want uniform rules across all 50 states.

The Obama administration's rules, negotiated with automakers in 2011, were aimed at doubling average fleet-wide fuel efficiency to 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025. Under the 2011 deal, the 2022-2025 model year rules must be finalized by April 2018.

"The talk the of rollback is fallacious. What we are talking here is the nature of the slope," Bainwol said. "We will get to the Obama numbers (54.5 mpg). We will get beyond the Obama numbers. The question is when and how."

Without a deal, automakers could be forced to meet one set of standards in California and about a dozen states that have adopted its rules and other rules in the rest of the country.

Environmentalists say the rules are saving consumers billions of dollars in fuel. Dave Cooke, a vehicle analyst at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said in a blog that "fuel economy regulations have been critical in moving the needle towards energy efficiency — the auto industry is historically resistant to change, pushing back on safety improvements like air bags and seat belts."

In 2011, Obama said the rules would save motorists $1.7 trillion in fuel costs over the life of the vehicles, but cost the auto industry about $200 billion over 13 years.

UPDATE 1-Ford executive predicts U.S. SUV boom will continue - 路透新闻

{{20170411T001726.328+0000}}UPDATE 1-Ford executive predicts U.S. SUV boom will continue(Adds background on SUVs)

NEW YORK, April 10 (Reuters) - A top Ford Motor Co executive said on Monday industry-wide sales of sport utility vehicles will continue to rise in the United States as the country's second-largest U.S. automaker gets ready to unveil a refreshed 2018 Ford Explorer SUV.

The market share of SUVs has increased to nearly 40 percent from 32.6 percent of total U.S. vehicle sales in 2016.

Mark LaNeve, Ford's vice president of U.S. marketing, sales and service told reporters at an event on Monday ahead of this week's New York International Auto Show that the company expects that figure to rise to 45 percent of industry sales within five to seven years.

Automakers are "responding to consumer demand," LaNeve said, citing the growing number of SUVs automakers are introducing. Ford last refreshed the Explorer in 2015.

Low fuel prices and improving fuel efficiency among SUVs have helped prod more Americans into buying SUVs and pickup trucks in recent years and put pressure on car sales. Many automakers like Volkswagen AG are shifting focus in the United States from cars to SUVs.

Ford has said it plans to unveil five new SUVs in the United States by 2020. Reuters reported in February that a sixth new model would carry the Lincoln badge. [nL1N1FR19W]

The company is also launching a redesigned 2018 model year version of its larger Expedition SUV. Both the new Expedition and Explorer will go on sale this fall.

Tesla becomes most valuable U.S. car maker, edges out GM - 路透新闻

{{20170410T163140.149+0000}}Tesla becomes most valuable U.S. car maker, edges out GMBy Noel Randewich

SAN FRANCISCO, April 10 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc on Monday briefly became the most valuable U.S. car maker, reaching a market capitalization of as much as $51.105 billion, higher than General Motors's .

Helped by an analyst's recommendation, the luxury electric car maker's stock rose as much as 3.15 percent to a new record high of $313.73, and its market value was at one point larger than GM's, which was $51.095 billion, before it dropped behind again.

Over the past month, Tesla has surged 35 percent as investors bet that it and Chief Executive Elon Musk will revolutionize the automobile and energy industries.

Tesla's market capitalization is now equivalent to $102,000 for every car it plans to make in 2018, or $667,000 per car sold last year. By comparison, GM's market capitalization is equivalent to $5,000 per car it sold in 2016.

Proponents believe Tesla will become a carbon-free energy and transportation heavyweight and they argue its valuation is reasonable based on long-term expectations for Tesla's growth.

They also point to opportunities from Tesla's acquisition last year of money-losing solar panel installer SolarCity and Tesla's Nevada battery cell plant aimed at driving down manufacturing costs.

"Even with all the risks, we think growth investors can't afford to ignore this stock," wrote Piper Jaffray analyst Alexander Potter in a report on Monday, upgrading Tesla to "overweight" from "neutral".

Skeptics believe Tesla's growth targets are unrealistic and that it is at risk of being overtaken by GM, Ford and other deep-pocketed manufacturers that are ramping up their own electric-vehicle offerings.

Jeffrey Gundlach, who oversees more than $105 billion in assets at Los Angeles-based DoubleLine Capital, told Reuters last week: "As a car company alone, Tesla is crazy high valuation. As a battery company - one that expands and innovates substantially - maybe the valuation can work." [nL2N1HC279]

The Silicon Valley car company is rushing to launch its mass-market Model 3 sedan in the second half of 2017 and quickly ramp up its factory to reach a production target of 500,000 cars per year in 2018. Last year it sold 76,230, missing its target of at least 80,000 vehicles. By comparison, GM sold 10 million cars and Ford sold 6.7 million.

UPDATE 1-Toyota makes $1.33 bln investment in Kentucky plant - 路透新闻

{{20170410T122012.009+0000}}UPDATE 1-Toyota makes $1.33 bln investment in Kentucky plant(Adds background)

April 10 (Reuters) - Japanese automaker Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T> said it is spending $1.33 billion in its Kentucky plant as part of a plan to invest $10 billion in the United States over the next five years.

The investment in the plant, Toyota's largest, comes amid uncertainty over U.S. President Donald Trump's trade policies that could affect certain Japanese firms' capital expenditure plans.

Trump criticized the automaker earlier this year and said he would impose a hefty fee if it built its Corolla cars for the U.S. market at a plant in Mexico. [nL1N1EV1FV]

Toyota joins a host of automakers including Fiat Chrysler Automobiles , Honda Motor Co <7267.T> and Daimler AG that have announced investments in the United States since Trump won the U.S. election.

Even U.S. car manufacturers Ford Motor Co and General Motors have announced plans to spend more domestically.

"Toyota's decision to invest $1.3 billion in their Kentucky plant is further evidence that manufacturers are now confident that the economic climate has greatly improved under my administration", Trump said in the statement issued by Toyota. [nPn9RPv7La]

Toyota said that the investment would help in its new production process that would allow for a more flexible production environment, helping its build better cars and respond quicker to customers.

The Kentucky plant employs about 8,200 workers and Toyota recently booted the count by more than 700 ahead of the launch of the new version of Camry.

UPDATE 1-Ford plans to launch Ranger pickup truck in China in 2018 - 路透新闻

{{20170407T093412.782+0000}}UPDATE 1-Ford plans to launch Ranger pickup truck in China in 2018(Adds details on production plans, F-150 Raptor, China pickup policy)

BEIJING, April 7 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co plans to launch its mid-size Ranger pickup truck in China in 2018, hoping to draw more Chinese consumers, who generally prefer sport-utility vehicles (SUVs), towards a new segment of cars.

Ford would import the Ranger to China and currently has no plans to manufacture it locally, a spokeswoman said.

The Chinese government's pilot program to relax policies that restrict pickup trucks from driving in urban areas is a potential boon for Ford, whose F-series pickup truck has been a bestseller in the United States for more than 30 years.

At present, the Ranger is targeting markets outside the United States. However, Ford plans to reintroduce the model, which is smaller than the F-150, the entry-level F-series truck, in the country.

Last year, Ford announced plans to sell the high-end Raptor version of the F-150 in China, to gauge demand in a relatively undeveloped segment and change the image of the pickup as a low-end workhorse in China. The first Raptor F150s will be delivered to customers on Saturday.

The pickup offerings come as wealthy Chinese motorists look to buy larger cars, with SUVs driving growth in Chinese automobile sales amid weak demand for sedans.

U.S. trade group hacked with Chinese software ahead of Xi summit - 路透新闻

{{20170406T130001.570+0000}}U.S. trade group hacked with Chinese software ahead of Xi summitBy Joseph Menn

SAN FRANCISCO, April 6 (Reuters) - A sophisticated hacking group that pursues Chinese government interests broke into the website of a private U.S. trade group ahead of Thursday's summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, according to researchers.

The hackers left a malicious link on web pages where members of the National Foreign Trade Council (NFTC) register for upcoming meetings, according to researchers at Fidelis Cybersecurity and a person familiar with the trade group.

The nonprofit NFTC is a prominent advocate on international trade policy, with corporate members including Wal-Mart Stores Inc , Johnson & Johnson , Amazon.com Inc , Ford Motor Co and Microsoft Corp .

The malicious link deployed a spying tool called Scanbox, which would have recorded the type and versions of software running on the computers of those exposed to it, said Fidelis researcher John Bambenek. Such reconnaissance is typically followed by new attacks using known flaws in the detected software, especially older versions.

Scanbox has only been used by groups associated with the Chinese government, Fidelis said, and was recently seen on a political site aimed at Uyghurs, an ethnic minority under close government scrutiny in China.

The breach was detected about five weeks ago by a NFTC director who is a customer of Fidelis, the security company said. Both the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the NFTC were notified and the malicious link removed, and Fidelis said it had no evidence of NFTC members being infected.

The FBI and the NFTC declined to comment. A spokesman for the Chinese foreign ministry did not respond to a request for comment.

Bambenek said he believed the attack was classic espionage related to international trade talks, rather than a violation of a 2015 agreement between former U.S. President Barack Obama and Xi to end spying for commercial motives.

The summit starting on Thursday is the first meeting between Xi and Trump, who blamed China on the campaign trail for the loss of many U.S. jobs and vowed to confront the country's leaders on the matters of trade and currency manipulation.

"I think it's traditional espionage that happens ahead of any summit," said Bambenek. "They would like to know what we, the Americans, really care about and use that for leverage."

Other security firms agreed that wholesale theft of U.S. intellectual property has not returned.

Instead, FireEye Inc and BAE Systems Plc said that the hacking group identified by Fidelis, called APT10, has recently attacked government and commercial targets in Europe.

FireEye researcher John Hultquist said heavy industries in Nordic countries have been hacked more often as Beijing switches priorities.

"They are certainly taking those resources and pushing them to other places where they can still get away with this behavior," Hultquist said.

RPT-After weak March sales, concerns rise over U.S. auto market outlook - 路透新闻

{{20170406T124419.966+0000}}RPT-After weak March sales, concerns rise over U.S. auto market outlook(Repeats with no changes in text)

By Nick Carey and Joseph White

DETROIT, April 5 (Reuters) - Car dealers on Wednesday added to concerns about the state of the U.S. auto industry and how tough any downturn might be if its six-year recovery has ended.

In a conference call with media and analysts, officials of the National Automobile Dealers Association said they expected sales of cars and light trucks in the United States to dip to 17.1 million vehicles this year, high by historical standards but below 2016's record 17.55 million vehicles.

The NADA call came just two days after disappointing industry figures for March that showed an annualized sales rate of around 16.6 million units. [nL2N1HB0T2]

NADA chairman Mark Scarpelli, an Illinois car dealer, echoed concerns of some Wall Street analysts that values for used sedans were dropping as more vehicles were turned in when leases ended.

"It's a big number," Scarpelli said, referring to the numbers of leased cars headed to used car lots. "But it's not an insurmountable number." Falling values for these used cars are a problem for car makers and their finance companies, not dealers, Scarpelli said, because auto retailers can return the cars to the banks or manufacturers.

Wholesale car auction company Manheim predicts 3.6 million vehicles will come off lease in 2017 followed by 4.1 million in 2018. If historical patterns hold up, around 4.3 million cars will come off lease in 2019.

"Off-lease returns still remain the wild card," said Pete DeLongchamps, vice president of manufacturer relations at auto retail chain Group 1 Automotive Inc .

Investors are also watching rising interest rates, inventories of unsold vehicles and the generosity of profit-eroding discounts that automakers are offering to close deals. Those indicators are largely negative.

According to Cox Automotive data, consumer discounts were up 14.6 percent on the year in March. In their sales forecasts in the last two months, automotive consultancy firms J.D. Power and LMC have said discounts hit levels not seen since the recession in 2009.

Signs that the auto cycle is at its peak have weighed on the shares of Detroit automakers, casting a shadow over an industry central to President Donald Trump's pledge to rebuild American manufacturing. [nL2N1H40BN]

General Motors Co shares are down 1.6 percent for the year, lagging broader market indexes, and Ford Motor Co shares are down nearly 7 percent. Shares in Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV are up nearly 11 percent, but the company's market value is just $12.3 billion - about a quarter the value of electric car maker Tesla Inc .

WIDE RANGE OF FORECASTS

Forecasts for U.S. auto demand range widely, underscoring industry uncertainty.

Ford stuck this week to a forecast that 2017 sales would rise to 17.7 million vehicles while the NADA and other forecasters expect them to hover around 17 million. Consultancy AlixPartners expects U.S. new vehicle sales to reach 17.5 million this year, but forecasts a drop to 16.6 million in 2018 and 15.2 million in 2019 before a slow recovery.

Industry executives point to solid consumer confidence, low interest rates, rising transaction prices and an old car fleet on America's roads, where the average vehicle is over 11 years old, as they give voice to guarded optimism.

If the U.S. auto market downshifted to a 16 million vehicle annualized pace for more than 45 days, that would be a concern, said GM's head of North American operations, Alan Batey.

"I don't think we are going to see it," he said.

Wall Street will be watching to see how quickly automakers respond to slow sales and rising inventories heading into the summer months. One way to cut stocks of unsold cars is to extend traditional summer assembly plant shutdowns.

Mark Wakefield, head of AlixPartners' automotive practice in the Americas region, said car production has already has come down, a sign that industry is showing more discipline than in past cycles.

"The real test comes when an (automaker) defects in a large way and starts going for share and volume and dropping prices dramatically," Wakefield said. "What do the others do and how does the market manage itself?"

UPDATE 1-Ford to launch plug-in car in China next year, electrify most by 2025  - 路透新闻

{{20170406T064544.052+0000}}UPDATE 1-Ford to launch plug-in car in China next year, electrify most by 2025 (Adds hybrid name, other details, context)

By Jake Spring

BEIJING, April 6 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co said it would launch a plug-in hybrid car in China in 2018 and a fully electric sport-utility vehicle in the next five years, as it works toward electrifying most of its lineup in the world's biggest auto market by 2025.

This comes at a time when Beijing is urging automakers to sell more electric vehicles, laying out strict fuel economy targets and subsidizing certain new energy vehicle models, in a bid to cut air pollution and promote technological innovation.

"The time is right for Ford to expand our EV (electric vehicle) lineup and investments in China," Ford Chief Executive Mark Fields said in a statement on Thursday.

The U.S. automaker, which makes cars in China through a joint venture with Chongqing Changan Automobile Co <000625.SZ>, said it plans for 70 percent of Ford brand vehicles sold in China to be conventional hybrids, plug-in hybrids or full battery electric by 2025.

Ford said it would launch its first hybrid that is locally made with Changan, the Mondeo Energi sedan, early next year.

After weak March sales, concerns rise over U.S. auto market outlook - 路透新闻

{{20170405T214713.078+0000}}After weak March sales, concerns rise over U.S. auto market outlookBy Nick Carey and Joseph White

DETROIT, April 5 (Reuters) - Car dealers on Wednesday added to concerns about the state of the U.S. auto industry and how tough any downturn might be if its six-year recovery has ended.

In a conference call with media and analysts, officials of the National Automobile Dealers Association said they expected sales of cars and light trucks in the United States to dip to 17.1 million vehicles this year, high by historical standards but below 2016's record 17.55 million vehicles.

The NADA call came just two days after disappointing industry figures for March that showed an annualized sales rate of around 16.6 million units. [nL2N1HB0T2]

NADA chairman Mark Scarpelli, an Illinois car dealer, echoed concerns of some Wall Street analysts that values for used sedans were dropping as more vehicles were turned in when leases ended.

"It's a big number," Scarpelli said, referring to the numbers of leased cars headed to used car lots. "But it's not an insurmountable number." Falling values for these used cars are a problem for car makers and their finance companies, not dealers, Scarpelli said, because auto retailers can return the cars to the banks or manufacturers.

Wholesale car auction company Manheim predicts 3.6 million vehicles will come off lease in 2017 followed by 4.1 million in 2018. If historical patterns hold up, around 4.3 million cars will come off lease in 2019.

"Off-lease returns still remain the wild card," said Pete DeLongchamps, vice president of manufacturer relations at auto retail chain Group 1 Automotive Inc .

Investors are also watching rising interest rates, inventories of unsold vehicles and the generosity of profit-eroding discounts that automakers are offering to close deals. Those indicators are largely negative.

According to Cox Automotive data, consumer discounts were up 14.6 percent on the year in March. In their sales forecasts in the last two months, automotive consultancy firms J.D. Power and LMC have said discounts hit levels not seen since the recession in 2009.

Signs that the auto cycle is at its peak have weighed on the shares of Detroit automakers, casting a shadow over an industry central to President Donald Trump's pledge to rebuild American manufacturing. [nL2N1H40BN]

General Motors Co shares are down 1.6 percent for the year, lagging broader market indexes, and Ford Motor Co shares are down nearly 7 percent. Shares in Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV are up nearly 11 percent, but the company's market value is just $12.3 billion - about a quarter the value of electric car maker Tesla Inc .

WIDE RANGE OF FORECASTS

Forecasts for U.S. auto demand range widely, underscoring industry uncertainty.

Ford stuck this week to a forecast that 2017 sales would rise to 17.7 million vehicles while the NADA and other forecasters expect them to hover around 17 million. Consultancy AlixPartners expects U.S. new vehicle sales to reach 17.5 million this year, but forecasts a drop to 16.6 million in 2018 and 15.2 million in 2019 before a slow recovery.

RPT-EXCLUSIVE-China's Great Wall Motor eyes plant in Mexico states hit by Trump -sources - 路透新闻

{{20170405T131751.781+0000}}RPT-EXCLUSIVE-China's Great Wall Motor eyes plant in Mexico states hit by Trump -sources(Repeats with no changes to text)

By Alexandra Alper and Norihiko Shirouzu

MEXICO CITY/BEIJING, April 5 (Reuters) - Chinese automaker Great Wall Motor Co Ltd <601633.SS><2333.HK> is considering building an auto plant in two Mexican states hit by U.S. President Donald Trump's drive to make American companies invest at home, sources said.

Great Wall Motor, which describes itself as China's largest SUV and pickup manufacturer, is interested in building a plant in Nuevo Leon in northern Mexico or the central state of San Luis Potosi, three people familiar with the matter said.

Under pressure from Trump to keep jobs in the United States, Ford Motor Co in January canceled a $1.6 billion plant in San Luis Potosi, while heating and air conditioning firm Carrier in December scaled back plans to move production to Nuevo Leon.

Great Wall Motor officials met with Mexico's top railroad firms, Ferrocarril Mexicano (Ferromex), part of Grupo Mexico , as well as Kansas City Southern de Mexico [KCSM.UL], to evaluate the states' connectivity, according to a source and two documents seen by Reuters.

One of the sources said the company was in direct talks with Nuevo Leon's government.

Another source said the automaker was also eyeing a U.S.-based plant but gave no further detail on locations.

A senior Great Wall Motor executive, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the choice between U.S. and Mexican locations would depend on trade issues involving the United States, Mexico and China.

Great Wall Motor and Ferromex did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A spokesman for Kansas City Southern de Mexico confirmed Great Wall Motor officials met the company, but declined to provide further details.

A pledge by the Chinese firm could bolster Mexico's efforts to reduce dependence on U.S. trade and investment as Trump threatens to rip up the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and rails against U.S. firms moving jobs south.

China, a low-cost manufacturing rival to Mexico, has traditionally invested little in Latin America's second largest economy. But there are signs that could be changing.

In February, China's Anhui Jianghuai Automobile (JAC Motor) and distributor Chori Company unveiled plans with a firm part-owned by Mexican tycoon Carlos Slim to invest over $200 million in a car plant in the central state of Hidalgo. [nL1N1FM26F]

According to one of the sources, construction on the Great Wall Motor plant could get underway next year and cost about $500 million. It would produce some 250,000 autos a year for the American and Mexican markets and seek to use Chinese inputs, the person added.

UPDATE 1-UK new car sales reach record high in March - 路透新闻

{{20170405T092756.506+0000}}UPDATE 1-UK new car sales reach record high in March(Adds quotes, details)

By Costas Pitas

LONDON, April 5 (Reuters) - British new car registrations rose to a record high in March as customers brought forward purchases to beat an April tax rise, a car industry body said, overcoming expectations of a slump after two years of record highs.

New car sales rose 8.4 percent last month to 562,337, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said, despite forecasts that demand would fail to surpass recent years of booming sales and be hit by Brexit.

Some consumers and businesses sought to avoid paying an increase in excise duty which came into force from April 1 for the most polluting vehicles, the SMMT said, adding it expected demand to fall in the next few months.

"This bumper performance probably means we will see a slowdown in April," said SMMT chief executive Mike Hawes. March, generally the top-selling month of the year, is one of only two occasions when new licence plates are issued.

"Looking ahead to the rest of the year, we still expect the market to cool only slightly given broader political uncertainties as there are still attractive deals on offer."

Demand for diesel cars rose only 1.6 percent compared with a more than 13 percent rise for petrol vehicles, suggesting some buyers may be put off by the prospect of additional taxes on diesel models. [nL5N1HC1HL]

Overall, low interest rates continue to support demand in Europe's second biggest car market, where around 80 percent of sales are made using a personal contract purchase (PCP), whereby a buyer effectively rents a vehicle, typically for two to three years.

At the end of the period they have to decide whether to buy the car outright or switch to a new model and continue making monthly payments, which the chief executive of one Britain's biggest car dealerships Lookers told Reuters was helping support demand.

"There are probably 1.4 million people coming off PCP this year and the easiest thing for them to do is just to have another one," said Andy Bruce, who predicts full-year registrations will marginally rise.

"The long-term trend in new and used car sales is driven by GDP and population growth, so inevitably it's going to keep rising unless there's some sort of economic downturn."

UAW says membership rose 1.8 pct in 2016 - 路透新闻

{{20170404T190141.482+0000}}UAW says membership rose 1.8 pct in 2016By David Shepardson

WASHINGTON, April 4 (Reuters) - Membership in the United Auto Workers union rose by 7,300 workers in 2016 to 415,963, the seventh straight year of small gains for the American labor union.

The Detroit-based union said in a filing with the U.S. Labor Department that membership rose 1.8 percent last year.

The UAW's ranks are down dramatically from the more than 700,000 members it had in 2002 and from its all-time high of nearly 1.5 million members in 1979.

The declines have come as U.S. automakers have reduced hourly employment and the UAW has struggled to organize workers at U.S. auto plants operated by Japanese, German and Korean automakers.

The UAW represents about 150,000 workers at General Motors Co , Ford Motor Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV . The union also represents workers at auto suppliers and in many other industries.

Since falling to a low of 355,191 in 2009, UAW membership has risen 17 percent.

UAW President Dennis Williams told reporters recently the union's finances have improved as membership has continued to grow.

The UAW reported assets of nearly $1 billion and liabilities of $135.6 million. The Labor Department filing includes a new $130.3 million ability to help fund an independent retiree health care trust for UAW staff announced in late 2015.

In January, the U.S. Labor Department said overall U.S. labor union membership rate fell to 10.7 percent in 2016, down 0.4 percentage point -- the lowest level since the government started keep track in 1983.

The overall number of workers in a union declined by 240,000 to 14.6 million last year.

Tesla traded at $301.74 at mid-day and had a market capitalization of $49.1 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data, compared with $51.1 billion for GM.

U.S. business seeks action, not trade war, in Xi-Trump summit - 路透新闻

{{20170404T111809.124+0000}}U.S. business seeks action, not trade war, in Xi-Trump summit* U.S. business community supports targeted trade actions on China

* Steel prices, access to China market at issue

* Doubts remain over whether Trump has a coordinated China policy

* Industry not expecting deals, but watching tone of summit

* China tops list of countries with trade surpluses with U.S.

By Michael Martina and Diane Bartz

BEIJING/WASHINGTON, April 4 (Reuters) - Although worried about the prospect of a trade war, American businesses operating in China nonetheless want President Donald Trump to wring some concessions on market access from China's leader Xi Jingping when the two meet this week.

Trump warned in a tweet last week the meetings at his Mar-a-Lago resort on Thursday and Friday will be "very difficult" and "American companies must be prepared to look at other alternatives."

Trump has said he wants U.S. companies to stop investing in China and instead create jobs at home. He has also accused China of manipulating its currency to boost exports.

Critics within U.S. industry have accused China of unfair government subsidies to its companies, and of flooding the U.S. market with cheap products from steel to solar panels, while restricting foreign investment over vast swathes of the world's second-biggest economy.

But they also worry Trump's policies on China are not entirely clear, with his trade team still not in place, and may be subject to a 'grand bargain' involving other issues such as North Korea.

Trump is set to enter the meeting without several key advisors, including his pick for trade negotiator, Robert Lighthizer who has yet to be confirmed by Congress. His nominee as ambassador to China, Iowa Governor Terry Branstad, has also yet to be confirmed, while several posts in the U.S. State Department that formulate Asia policy remain unfilled.

"With this in mind, it is hard to imagine that there will be much in the way of concrete accomplishments at this summit, or even that there has been any significant interagency discussion on strategy leading up to it," said Randal Phillips, Mintz Group's Beijing-based managing partner for Asia and the former chief CIA representative in China.

'ACTIONS, NOT WORDS'

Some of the largest U.S. companies have contributed to the billions of dollars of foreign direct investment that have poured into China over the past two decades, creating hundreds of thousands of jobs. They include tech companies like Apple, which makes much of its iPhone in China, automakers such as General Motors and Ford, heavy machinery firms like Caterpillar, retailers like Starbucks and makers of shaving foam and detergent, like Procter & Gamble.

U.S. steel producers want Trump to press Xi on Chinese steel prices, according to a source who has been in discussions with the administration in advance of the summit.

U.S. automakers complain about a disparity in tariffs: The United States has a 2.5 percent tariff on auto imports, China's is 25 percent.

But the stakes are perhaps highest for American technology firms, who worry that China's new cyber-security law, which takes effect in June, sets potentially discriminatory standards for multinationals.

The Information Technology & Innovation Foundation (ITIF), a think-tank whose board includes representatives from Apple, IBM Google and other tech heavyweights, has urged the Trump administration to pressure China to "stop rigging markets". It warned that possible retaliation from Beijing was not a reason for inaction.[nL3N1GT2ZS]

Trump has staked out various positions on China as president in his tweets, phone calls and statements.

In a phone call with Xi after taking office, Trump gave ground on one of Beijing's most sensitive issues – the status of Taiwan - after earlier suggesting he might not stick to Washington's long-held "one China" policy.

Trump signed two executive orders on trade on Friday, one to improve import tariff collection and another to study the causes of the U.S. trade deficit. Trump said at the White House signing ceremony he and Xi were "going to get down to some serious business" and vowed that "the theft of American prosperity" by foreign countries would end.

Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Zheng Zeguang said on Friday the U.S.-China trade imbalance was mostly the result of differences in the two countries' economic structures and noted China had a trade deficit in services.

China tops the list of countries who have trade surpluses with the United States, with a $347 billion surplus last year.

TRADE WARS

Some in the U.S. business community worry about tit-for-tat retaliation in trade disputes with China.

Jacob Parker, vice president of China operations at the U.S.-China Business Council, said the two presidents need to take "positive actions that would lead to a more durable relationship, not retaliatory actions that would lead to a trade war".

The list of commercial issues between the two countries was so long, it would be impossible to make a major dent in them with one meeting, he said.

China is the largest export market for U.S. soybean producers, accounting for 62 percent of U.S. soy exports in 2016 with a value of over $14 billion, leading some experts to suggest the sector could be particularly vulnerable to retaliation.

Steve Censky, chief executive of the American Soybean Association, told Reuters he hopes Trump will take a "prudent" approach to the trade relationship and address any issues in a "workman-like manner", recognising that both countries have a lot to lose if the relationship suffers.

William Zarit, chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China met senior Trump administration officials in February, and said "it was clear they were very familiar with the issues facing American companies in China, perhaps more so than previous administrations".

But several corporate lobbyists, representing a range of companies expressed concern Trump's lack of attention to detail could prove counterproductive when it comes to the intricacies of the massive trade and investment relationship.

"It's not yet clear whether ... this is a White House that wants to fundamentally reset the terms of the relationship or tinker at the edges and declare a public relations win," said a China expert at a Washington business lobby who asked not to be named.

UPDATE 3-GM gives details of contacts with Einhorn, CEO Barra's pay - 路透新闻

{{20170403T222738.034+0000}}UPDATE 3-GM gives details of contacts with Einhorn, CEO Barra's pay(Adds details of contacts with Einhorn, board nominees)

By Nick Carey

DETROIT, April 3 (Reuters) - General Motors Co on Monday outlined in a regulatory filing contacts with billionaire hedge fund manager David Einhorn who went public last week with a plan to boost GM's value and announced its slate of board nominees, all of whom currently serve on the board.

Einhorn, who runs hedge fund Greenlight Capital, has proposed that GM create two classes of stock, one that pays a dividend and one that does not, to boost the No. 1 U.S. carmaker's share price.

GM has rejected the proposal and rating agencies have said it would negatively affect the company's credit rating. Other investors in the carmaker have also given the proposal from Einhorn, who runs Greenlight Capital, a frosty reception. [nL2N1H823X]

Einhorn has said he would take his plan to GM shareholders through a proxy contest where he hopes to win board seats, though he has not released any names.

According to GM's proxy filing, Einhorn first reached out to the company last August, and followed with a number of in-person meetings, teleconferences and calls, including with GM chief executive Mary Barra.

GM said it also analyzed Einhorn's proposal including discussions with rating agencies.

In December GM's board reviewed analyses of Einhorn's proposal conducted by management and financial advisers and "determined that it was not in the best interests" of GM or shareholders.

Greenlight, which has a 4.9 percent stake in GM including options, declined to comment.

In the filing GM also said that Barra's salary, bonus and awards declined more than 20 percent in 2016 to $22.6 million from $28.6 million in 2015.

The company said this reflected a one-time retention bonus of nearly $11.2 million in stock options in 2015.

GM reported a pretax profit of $12.5 billion in 2016, up from $10.8 billion in 2015.

Last week No. 2 U.S. automaker Ford Motor Co said its chief executive Mark Fields' salary, bonus and stock awards rose 8 percent to $18.8 million in 2016, while pretax profit for the automaker fell slightly from a record high in 2015. [nL2N1H80N0]

In late February Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV said chief executive Sergio Marchionne received $11.6 million (10.83 million euros) in pay and benefits for 2016. [nL2N1GE01C]

UPDATE 1-GM leads March sales in Canada as automakers report record month - 路透新闻

{{20170403T213013.430+0000}}UPDATE 1-GM leads March sales in Canada as automakers report record month(Adds total Canadian sales, and sales from Nissan and Honda)

TORONTO, April 3 (Reuters) - Automakers sold a record number of vehicles in Canada during March, with General Motors Canada leading in sales volume and posting its best monthly sales performance since 2008.

Overall Canadian sales were driven by an 11.1 percent increase in consumer demand for pickups and sport utility vehicles during the month, which more than offset a 0.3 percent dip in passenger car sales.

Carmakers sold 187,540 vehicles last month, a 7.1 percent increase over the same period last year, which at the time was the best March since 1988, according to industry data from Desrosiers Automotive Consultants.

Sales growth for the first three months of 2017 was 4.6 percent.

GM Canada, which makes Chevrolet and GMC vehicles, reported double-digit sales growth, selling 30,115 total vehicles in March, an increase of 22.9 percent from a year ago when it sold 24,498 cars and trucks.

Fiat Chrysler Automobiles , which makes Dodge and Chrysler brands, posted a marginal sales rise, with 26,531 cars and trucks sold during the month, compared with 26,469 a year ago.

Ford Motor Co sold a total of 26,487 cars and trucks in Canada last month, up from 26,447, a 0.2 percent rise.

In the United States, monthly figures came in below market expectations, adding to concerns that the boom in U.S. auto sales may be waning. Shares of the three big automakers fell on Monday, with FCA falling nearly 5 percent, GM down 3.4 percent, and Ford closing 1.7 percent lower. [nL2N1HB0T2]

Other automakers also reported a significant increase in Canadian sales, including Nissan Motor Co Ltd <7201.T>, which sold 14,523 vehicles, representing a 26.7 percent jump. Honda Canada <7267.T> reported an 18.7 percent rise, selling 17,392 vehicles.

UPDATE 3-U.S. March auto sales indicate long boom cycle may be waning - 路透新闻

{{20170403T191406.721+0000}}UPDATE 3-U.S. March auto sales indicate long boom cycle may be waning(Adds industry wide data, context)

By Nick Carey

DETROIT, April 3 (Reuters) - Major U.S. automakers' sales figures for March came in below market expectations and gave early evidence that America's long, robust boom cycle for car sales may finally be losing steam.

General Motors Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV shares both fell almost 4 percent, while Ford Motor Co was off 3 percent.

Auto industry publication WardsAuto put the seasonally-adjusted annualized rate (SAAR) for light vehicle sales in March at 16.53 million units. Industry consultant Autodata put industry SAAR at 16.62 million units for March.

That was below the 17.3 million analysts polled by Reuters had expected, and the first time since August that the SAAR - a crucial industry metric - had fallen below 17 million.

March "was a tough, tough, tough market," said Judy Wheeler, vice president of U.S. sales at Nissan Motor Co Ltd <7201.T>, which reported a 3.2 percent increase in March sales. "It's going to be an aggressive year and I think everybody realizes that."

Industry experts are increasingly concerned about rising inventory levels and consumer discounts as automakers push harder to sell their products. A pricing war in the market could undermine automakers' profits.

Last week, Moody's warned that flattening U.S. auto sales pose a significant credit risk for auto lenders. [nL2N1H30BT]

Karl Brauer, executive publisher at auto industry consultancy Kelley Blue Book said while overall sales looked "healthy" in March discounts "have risen across the board, even on the same truck and SUV models that used to sell themselves."

Nissan's Wheeler said Nissan's internal data showed consumer discounts were $441 higher per vehicle than a year ago and inventory levels were on the rise.

Nissan trucks, SUVs and crossovers were up 26 percent and had hit record highs, especially its high-selling Rogue crossover.

Car sales in America have risen since end of the Great Recession and hit a record last year of 17.55 million.

Trucks and SUVs pushed sales at some major automakers higher in March at the expense of cars as American consumers continued to shun smaller vehicles amid low gasoline prices.

GM reported a 2 percent increase in sales to just over 256,000 vehicles, with sales of its Tahoe and Suburban SUV models seeing their best sales month since 2008.

Sales at Ford Motor Co fell more than 7 percent to 236,000 vehicles, with fleet sales to rental agencies, businesses and government entities down nearly 17 percent on the year. Sales of Ford's F-Series pickup trucks rose 10 percent on the year.

The F-Series has been the best-selling model in the United States since 1982 and is a key profit generator for the No. 2 U.S. automaker.

Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T> reported a 2.1 percent decrease in sales. Fiat Chrysler said sales were down 5 percent on the year, though its popular Ram pickup was up 6 percent.

Honda Motor Co Ltd <7267.T> reported an overall decline in sales of 0.7 percent versus March 2016, but said truck sales were up 8.4 percent.

GM shares were down 3.8 percent at $34.03 and Ford was off 3 percent at $11.29. Fiat Chrysler shares were down 5.9 percent in New York trading at $10.28.

The news also weighed on car retailer stocks. The March sales offered the market a glimpse of the overall health of middle-class American consumers. [nL2N1H826P]

Car retailer Penske Auto Group was down 1.5 percent and Group 1 Automotive was down 3.3 percent on Monday morning.

Tesla traded at $301.74 at mid-day and had a market capitalization of $49.1 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data, compared with $51.1 billion for GM.

Tesla on Monday said it delivered a record 25,000 electric vehicles in the first quarter. It plans to begin production this summer of the mass-market Model 3 sedan.

U.S. business seeks action, not trade war, in Xi-Trump summit - 路透新闻

{{20170404T111809.124+0000}}U.S. business seeks action, not trade war, in Xi-Trump summit* U.S. business community supports targeted trade actions on China

* Steel prices, access to China market at issue

* Doubts remain over whether Trump has a coordinated China policy

* Industry not expecting deals, but watching tone of summit

* China tops list of countries with trade surpluses with U.S.

By Michael Martina and Diane Bartz

BEIJING/WASHINGTON, April 4 (Reuters) - Although worried about the prospect of a trade war, American businesses operating in China nonetheless want President Donald Trump to wring some concessions on market access from China's leader Xi Jingping when the two meet this week.

Trump warned in a tweet last week the meetings at his Mar-a-Lago resort on Thursday and Friday will be "very difficult" and "American companies must be prepared to look at other alternatives."

Trump has said he wants U.S. companies to stop investing in China and instead create jobs at home. He has also accused China of manipulating its currency to boost exports.

Critics within U.S. industry have accused China of unfair government subsidies to its companies, and of flooding the U.S. market with cheap products from steel to solar panels, while restricting foreign investment over vast swathes of the world's second-biggest economy.

But they also worry Trump's policies on China are not entirely clear, with his trade team still not in place, and may be subject to a 'grand bargain' involving other issues such as North Korea.

Trump is set to enter the meeting without several key advisors, including his pick for trade negotiator, Robert Lighthizer who has yet to be confirmed by Congress. His nominee as ambassador to China, Iowa Governor Terry Branstad, has also yet to be confirmed, while several posts in the U.S. State Department that formulate Asia policy remain unfilled.

"With this in mind, it is hard to imagine that there will be much in the way of concrete accomplishments at this summit, or even that there has been any significant interagency discussion on strategy leading up to it," said Randal Phillips, Mintz Group's Beijing-based managing partner for Asia and the former chief CIA representative in China.

'ACTIONS, NOT WORDS'

Some of the largest U.S. companies have contributed to the billions of dollars of foreign direct investment that have poured into China over the past two decades, creating hundreds of thousands of jobs. They include tech companies like Apple, which makes much of its iPhone in China, automakers such as General Motors and Ford, heavy machinery firms like Caterpillar, retailers like Starbucks and makers of shaving foam and detergent, like Procter & Gamble.

U.S. steel producers want Trump to press Xi on Chinese steel prices, according to a source who has been in discussions with the administration in advance of the summit.

U.S. automakers complain about a disparity in tariffs: The United States has a 2.5 percent tariff on auto imports, China's is 25 percent.

But the stakes are perhaps highest for American technology firms, who worry that China's new cyber-security law, which takes effect in June, sets potentially discriminatory standards for multinationals.

The Information Technology & Innovation Foundation (ITIF), a think-tank whose board includes representatives from Apple, IBM Google and other tech heavyweights, has urged the Trump administration to pressure China to "stop rigging markets". It warned that possible retaliation from Beijing was not a reason for inaction.[nL3N1GT2ZS]

Trump has staked out various positions on China as president in his tweets, phone calls and statements.

In a phone call with Xi after taking office, Trump gave ground on one of Beijing's most sensitive issues – the status of Taiwan - after earlier suggesting he might not stick to Washington's long-held "one China" policy.

Trump signed two executive orders on trade on Friday, one to improve import tariff collection and another to study the causes of the U.S. trade deficit. Trump said at the White House signing ceremony he and Xi were "going to get down to some serious business" and vowed that "the theft of American prosperity" by foreign countries would end.

Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Zheng Zeguang said on Friday the U.S.-China trade imbalance was mostly the result of differences in the two countries' economic structures and noted China had a trade deficit in services.

China tops the list of countries who have trade surpluses with the United States, with a $347 billion surplus last year.

TRADE WARS

Some in the U.S. business community worry about tit-for-tat retaliation in trade disputes with China.

Jacob Parker, vice president of China operations at the U.S.-China Business Council, said the two presidents need to take "positive actions that would lead to a more durable relationship, not retaliatory actions that would lead to a trade war".

The list of commercial issues between the two countries was so long, it would be impossible to make a major dent in them with one meeting, he said.

China is the largest export market for U.S. soybean producers, accounting for 62 percent of U.S. soy exports in 2016 with a value of over $14 billion, leading some experts to suggest the sector could be particularly vulnerable to retaliation.

Steve Censky, chief executive of the American Soybean Association, told Reuters he hopes Trump will take a "prudent" approach to the trade relationship and address any issues in a "workman-like manner", recognising that both countries have a lot to lose if the relationship suffers.

William Zarit, chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China met senior Trump administration officials in February, and said "it was clear they were very familiar with the issues facing American companies in China, perhaps more so than previous administrations".

But several corporate lobbyists, representing a range of companies expressed concern Trump's lack of attention to detail could prove counterproductive when it comes to the intricacies of the massive trade and investment relationship.

"It's not yet clear whether ... this is a White House that wants to fundamentally reset the terms of the relationship or tinker at the edges and declare a public relations win," said a China expert at a Washington business lobby who asked not to be named.

UPDATE 3-GM gives details of contacts with Einhorn, CEO Barra's pay - 路透新闻

{{20170403T222738.034+0000}}UPDATE 3-GM gives details of contacts with Einhorn, CEO Barra's pay(Adds details of contacts with Einhorn, board nominees)

By Nick Carey

DETROIT, April 3 (Reuters) - General Motors Co on Monday outlined in a regulatory filing contacts with billionaire hedge fund manager David Einhorn who went public last week with a plan to boost GM's value and announced its slate of board nominees, all of whom currently serve on the board.

Einhorn, who runs hedge fund Greenlight Capital, has proposed that GM create two classes of stock, one that pays a dividend and one that does not, to boost the No. 1 U.S. carmaker's share price.

GM has rejected the proposal and rating agencies have said it would negatively affect the company's credit rating. Other investors in the carmaker have also given the proposal from Einhorn, who runs Greenlight Capital, a frosty reception. [nL2N1H823X]

Einhorn has said he would take his plan to GM shareholders through a proxy contest where he hopes to win board seats, though he has not released any names.

According to GM's proxy filing, Einhorn first reached out to the company last August, and followed with a number of in-person meetings, teleconferences and calls, including with GM chief executive Mary Barra.

GM said it also analyzed Einhorn's proposal including discussions with rating agencies.

In December GM's board reviewed analyses of Einhorn's proposal conducted by management and financial advisers and "determined that it was not in the best interests" of GM or shareholders.

Greenlight, which has a 4.9 percent stake in GM including options, declined to comment.

In the filing GM also said that Barra's salary, bonus and awards declined more than 20 percent in 2016 to $22.6 million from $28.6 million in 2015.

The company said this reflected a one-time retention bonus of nearly $11.2 million in stock options in 2015.

GM reported a pretax profit of $12.5 billion in 2016, up from $10.8 billion in 2015.

Last week No. 2 U.S. automaker Ford Motor Co said its chief executive Mark Fields' salary, bonus and stock awards rose 8 percent to $18.8 million in 2016, while pretax profit for the automaker fell slightly from a record high in 2015. [nL2N1H80N0]

In late February Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV said chief executive Sergio Marchionne received $11.6 million (10.83 million euros) in pay and benefits for 2016. [nL2N1GE01C]

UPDATE 1-GM leads March sales in Canada as automakers report record month - 路透新闻

{{20170403T213013.430+0000}}UPDATE 1-GM leads March sales in Canada as automakers report record month(Adds total Canadian sales, and sales from Nissan and Honda)

TORONTO, April 3 (Reuters) - Automakers sold a record number of vehicles in Canada during March, with General Motors Canada leading in sales volume and posting its best monthly sales performance since 2008.

Overall Canadian sales were driven by an 11.1 percent increase in consumer demand for pickups and sport utility vehicles during the month, which more than offset a 0.3 percent dip in passenger car sales.

Carmakers sold 187,540 vehicles last month, a 7.1 percent increase over the same period last year, which at the time was the best March since 1988, according to industry data from Desrosiers Automotive Consultants.

Sales growth for the first three months of 2017 was 4.6 percent.

GM Canada, which makes Chevrolet and GMC vehicles, reported double-digit sales growth, selling 30,115 total vehicles in March, an increase of 22.9 percent from a year ago when it sold 24,498 cars and trucks.

Fiat Chrysler Automobiles , which makes Dodge and Chrysler brands, posted a marginal sales rise, with 26,531 cars and trucks sold during the month, compared with 26,469 a year ago.

Ford Motor Co sold a total of 26,487 cars and trucks in Canada last month, up from 26,447, a 0.2 percent rise.

In the United States, monthly figures came in below market expectations, adding to concerns that the boom in U.S. auto sales may be waning. Shares of the three big automakers fell on Monday, with FCA falling nearly 5 percent, GM down 3.4 percent, and Ford closing 1.7 percent lower. [nL2N1HB0T2]

Other automakers also reported a significant increase in Canadian sales, including Nissan Motor Co Ltd <7201.T>, which sold 14,523 vehicles, representing a 26.7 percent jump. Honda Canada <7267.T> reported an 18.7 percent rise, selling 17,392 vehicles.

UPDATE 3-U.S. March auto sales indicate long boom cycle may be waning - 路透新闻

{{20170403T191406.721+0000}}UPDATE 3-U.S. March auto sales indicate long boom cycle may be waning(Adds industry wide data, context)

By Nick Carey

DETROIT, April 3 (Reuters) - Major U.S. automakers' sales figures for March came in below market expectations and gave early evidence that America's long, robust boom cycle for car sales may finally be losing steam.

General Motors Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV shares both fell almost 4 percent, while Ford Motor Co was off 3 percent.

Auto industry publication WardsAuto put the seasonally-adjusted annualized rate (SAAR) for light vehicle sales in March at 16.53 million units. Industry consultant Autodata put industry SAAR at 16.62 million units for March.

That was below the 17.3 million analysts polled by Reuters had expected, and the first time since August that the SAAR - a crucial industry metric - had fallen below 17 million.

March "was a tough, tough, tough market," said Judy Wheeler, vice president of U.S. sales at Nissan Motor Co Ltd <7201.T>, which reported a 3.2 percent increase in March sales. "It's going to be an aggressive year and I think everybody realizes that."

Industry experts are increasingly concerned about rising inventory levels and consumer discounts as automakers push harder to sell their products. A pricing war in the market could undermine automakers' profits.

Last week, Moody's warned that flattening U.S. auto sales pose a significant credit risk for auto lenders. [nL2N1H30BT]

Karl Brauer, executive publisher at auto industry consultancy Kelley Blue Book said while overall sales looked "healthy" in March discounts "have risen across the board, even on the same truck and SUV models that used to sell themselves."

Nissan's Wheeler said Nissan's internal data showed consumer discounts were $441 higher per vehicle than a year ago and inventory levels were on the rise.

Nissan trucks, SUVs and crossovers were up 26 percent and had hit record highs, especially its high-selling Rogue crossover.

Car sales in America have risen since end of the Great Recession and hit a record last year of 17.55 million.

Trucks and SUVs pushed sales at some major automakers higher in March at the expense of cars as American consumers continued to shun smaller vehicles amid low gasoline prices.

GM reported a 2 percent increase in sales to just over 256,000 vehicles, with sales of its Tahoe and Suburban SUV models seeing their best sales month since 2008.

Sales at Ford Motor Co fell more than 7 percent to 236,000 vehicles, with fleet sales to rental agencies, businesses and government entities down nearly 17 percent on the year. Sales of Ford's F-Series pickup trucks rose 10 percent on the year.

The F-Series has been the best-selling model in the United States since 1982 and is a key profit generator for the No. 2 U.S. automaker.

Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T> reported a 2.1 percent decrease in sales. Fiat Chrysler said sales were down 5 percent on the year, though its popular Ram pickup was up 6 percent.

Honda Motor Co Ltd <7267.T> reported an overall decline in sales of 0.7 percent versus March 2016, but said truck sales were up 8.4 percent.

GM shares were down 3.8 percent at $34.03 and Ford was off 3 percent at $11.29. Fiat Chrysler shares were down 5.9 percent in New York trading at $10.28.

The news also weighed on car retailer stocks. The March sales offered the market a glimpse of the overall health of middle-class American consumers. [nL2N1H826P]

Car retailer Penske Auto Group was down 1.5 percent and Group 1 Automotive was down 3.3 percent on Monday morning.

UPDATE 2-Ford CEO Mark Fields' compensation rose 8 percent in 2016 - 路透新闻

{{20170331T141456.617+0000}}UPDATE 2-Ford CEO Mark Fields' compensation rose 8 percent in 2016(Adds details, background on industry sales)

By Nick Carey

DETROIT, March 31 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co Chief Executive Officer Mark Fields' salary, bonus and stock awards rose 8 percent to a total of $18.8 million in 2016, while pretax profit for the automaker fell slightly from 2015's record high, it said on Friday.

Including pensions and perks, Fields made $22.1 million, up nearly 19 percent from $18.6 million. His pension award was nearly $2 million higher in 2016 than in the previous year.

The company said the compensation increase stemmed partly from performance bonuses based on a single-year target for 2016 and a portion of a goal for the three years through 2018.

Fields, 56, became CEO in the summer of 2014.

The company earned a pretax profit of $10.4 billion in 2016, down slightly from $10.8 billion in 2015.

Last week, the automaker said it expected lower earnings per share in the first quarter and a drop in pretax profit in 2017 to $9 billion due to increased spending on commodities, warranties and investments and a drop in sales volume. [nL2N1H00MR]

After a strong run in sales for automakers since they emerged from the Great Recession earlier this decade, investors are watching to see whether the current boom cycle is losing steam.

U.S. sales of new cars and trucks hit a record high of 17.55 million units in 2016. Automakers are set to release sales for March on Monday.

Ford also said on Friday that Executive Chairman Bill Ford, 59, received a salary, bonus and stock awards totaling $11.1 million in 2016, up 10 percent from 2015. His pension award rose about 5 percent to $1.45 million.

The company said the bigger pension awards resulted from two factors outside its control: fluctuating interest rates and changes to government-issued mortality tables.

Last month Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV said CEO Sergio Marchionne received $11.6 million (10.83 million euros) in pay and benefits for 2016. [nL2N1GE01C]
