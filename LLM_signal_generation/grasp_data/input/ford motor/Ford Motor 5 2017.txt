{{20170530T153756.457+0000}}BUZZ-RBC sees bond proxy correlations dissolving** RBC analyst Jonathan Golub writes that bond proxies (telecom, utilities, REITs) "tend to offer investors a smoother ride" with lower beta and volatility, but notes that this relationship has recently "broken down"

** However, Golub notes bond proxies are still acting like bonds, selling off on days when market interest rates rise

** Sees opportunity in tight labor market and normalization of Fed policy to alleviate risk by focusing on high dividend stocks outside these sectors

** Recommends shift in asset allocations from stock/bond mix toward equities

** Identifies Symantec , TransDigm , L Brands , Ford and Mattel as the 5 stocks outside of bond proxies with the highest dividend yields

Acquisitions accelerate as tech giants seek to build AI smarts - 路透新闻

{{20170526T191938.011+0000}}Acquisitions accelerate as tech giants seek to build AI smartsBy Julia Love

SAN FRANCISCO, May 26 (Reuters) - A total of 34 artificial intelligence startups were acquired in the first quarter of this year, more than twice the amount of activity in the year-ago quarter, according to the research firm CB Insights.

Tech giants seeking to reinforce their leads in artificial intelligence or make up for lost ground have been the most aggressive buyers. Alphabet Inc's Google has acquired 11 AI startups since 2012, the most of any firm, followed by Apple Inc , Facebook Inc and Intel Corp , respectively, according to CB Insights.

The companies declined to comment on their acquisition strategies. A spokesman for Apple did confirm the company's recent purchase of Lattice Data, a startup that specializes in working with unstructured data.

The first quarter also saw one of the largest deals to date as Ford Motor Co invested $1 billion in Argo AI, founded by former executives on self-driving teams at Google and Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL]. [nL1N1FV1FS] [nL1N1FY0O6]

Startups are looking to go deep on applications of artificial intelligence to specific fields, such as health and retail, industry observers say, rather than compete directly with established companies.

"What you will see is very big players will build platform services, and startup communities will migrate more to applied intelligent apps," said Matt McIlwain, managing director of Madrona Venture Group.

Healthcare startup Forward, for example, is using artificial intelligence to crunch data that can inform doctors' recommendations.

"For people who really want to focus on core AI problems, it makes a lot of sense to be in bigger companies," said Forward Chief Executive Officer Adrian Aoun, who previously worked at Google. "But for folks who really want to prove a new field, a new area, it makes more sense to be separate."

Artificial intelligence companies that do remain independent field a steady stream of suitors: Matthew Zeiler, chief executive of Clarifai, which specializes in image and video recognition, said he has been approached about a dozen times by prospective acquirers since starting the company in late 2013.

Clarifai's pitch to customers such as consumer goods company Unilever Plc and hotel search firm Trivago is bolstered by its narrow focus on artificial intelligence.

"(Google) literally competes with almost every company on the planet," Zeiler said. "Are you going to trust them with being your partner for AI?"

Tech giants have been locked in a bidding war for academics specializing in artificial intelligence. Startups rarely have the capital to compete, but a company with a specialized mission can win over recruits, said Vic Gundotra, chief executive of AliveCor, which makes an AI-driven portable heart monitor.

"They say, 'I want to come here and work on a project that might save my mother's life,'" Gundotra said.

UPDATE 4-New Ford CEO relies on veterans to reboot profits - 路透新闻

{{20170525T160015.451+0000}}UPDATE 4-New Ford CEO relies on veterans to reboot profits(Rewrites, updates share price)

By Sweta Singh and Joseph White

BENGALURU/DETROIT, May 25 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co on Thursday reshuffled senior management and brought back a former executive from Uber Technologies Inc, signaling its new chief executive officer will rely on tested company veterans to turn Ford around rather than outside talent.

James Hackett, named CEO on Monday, has said he wants to streamline Ford's hierarchy and speed up decision-making, as the No. 2 U.S. automaker faces threats from Silicon Valley's self-driving technology and resurgent rival General Motors Co in its traditional markets. [nL1N1IQ14I]

Ford said it hired Sherif Marakby as its new vice president in charge of its autonomous and electric vehicle efforts. Marakby had been hired away from ride-hailing company Uber [UBER.UL], where he was vice president of global vehicle programs. Prior to joining Uber last year, Marakby was at Ford for more than 25 years and worked on hybrid and electric vehicles.

The automaker said it will also combine its purchasing and product development operations under Hau Thai-Tang, previously head of global purchasing. Thai-Tang, 50, will have the task of simultaneously accelerating vehicle development and reining in costs as rival GM unleashes a volley of models aimed at the heart of Ford's product lineup.

Raj Nair, currently Ford's executive vice president of product development and chief technical officer, will take over as president, North America, effective June 1, the company said. He will be responsible for operations that generate about 90 percent of Ford's global profits.

In other moves, Ford named Steven Armstrong as head of Europe, Middle East and Africa and Peter Fleet as chief of Asia Pacific and China.

Armstrong is currently chief operating officer for Ford of Europe, while Fleet is in charge of sales and marketing for the Asia-Pacific region.

Last week, the company announced plans to cut 1,400 white-collar positions and is expected to make significant cost cuts in the coming months.

Hackett, who replaced Mark Fields, is the latest in a line of non-family CEOs given a mandate to change the management culture at one of the auto industry's oldest institutions. [nL4N1IO2J0]

Ford shares fell 1.7 percent to $10.77. The stock is down about 36 percent since Fields took over three years ago at the peak of the U.S. auto industry's recovery from the crisis of the last decade.

RPT-ANALYSIS-Lack of new launches leaves Ford playing catchup with GM - 路透新闻

{{20170525T131002.015+0000}}RPT-ANALYSIS-Lack of new launches leaves Ford playing catchup with GM(Repeats story published earlier on Thursday)

By Paul Lienert

DETROIT, May 25 (Reuters) - James Hackett spent the last year plotting Ford Motor Co's long-term self-driving car strategy. In his first week as chief executive, he has more immediate concerns: stopping a skid in North American sales and fending off a market share grab by resurgent archrival General Motors Co .

The U.S. No. 2 automaker is stuck in a product drought that shows no signs of easing until 2019, according to two sources who track Detroit's launch plans. Given the auto industry's long product cycles, it is not clear what Hackett can do immediately to get Ford out of its predicament, which can be traced back to decisions by former CEOs.

Hackett was tapped to run the company's autonomous car and ride-sharing unit a year ago. On Monday he unexpectedly found himself at the helm of the whole company as Ford axed CEO Mark Fields. [nL4N1IO2J0]

He now has to face up to a void of new vehicles, partly caused by former CEO Alan Mulally, who focused much of the company's resources on an expensive 2014 redesign of Ford's crown jewel, the F-Series pickup.

That safeguarded America's longtime best-selling vehicle, but it prevented Ford from developing other hits. Given that it typically takes three to four years for a new or redesigned vehicle to get into production, the full effect of Mulally's narrow focus is now being felt.

Mulally also gambled heavily on making an expensive shift to aluminum from steel to lighten up trucks and make them more fuel efficient, a bet that looks questionable in retrospect, as gas prices have remained far lower than anyone expected.

If Fields had immediately started pulling forward product launches when he took over from Mulally in July 2014, the first of those would likely reach the market in the autumn of 2018 at the earliest. As it is, Ford must wait until early 2019 for its first big slug of new models to hit showrooms.

There is not much Hackett can do about that. Any product moves he makes today would not likely show up in the market before 2021.

"Ford needs to move faster," said RBC auto analyst Joseph Spak.

Hackett, only three days into his new job, has not yet laid out his plans for Ford publicly.

Ford spokesman Michael Levine side-stepped questions of a short-term product drought. "We're bullish on our strong pipeline of all-new cars, trucks and SUVs coming in the next five years," he told Reuters. "What's more, the vehicles that we are launching ... will continue to deliver high transaction prices and good business."

PROFIT PER VEHICLE

For much of the past decade, Ford has benefited from management and marketing problems at GM, including GM's 2009 bankruptcy and a safety scandal that hobbled the company in 2014.

Now, however, Ford confronts a crosstown rival largely free of debt and focused on grabbing market share from Ford, particularly in the truck and SUV segments which account for most of both companies' profits.

GM, the No. 1 U.S. automaker, is in the midst of a prolific four-year patch of new vehicle launches, many approved by Mary Barra, the company's former head of global product development who was named CEO in January 2014.

In hindsight, GM benefited from its bankruptcy, as it emerged essentially debt-free and able to spend more on new products. Ford did not seek bankruptcy during last decade's auto industry crisis, and instead borrowed heavily to survive it, leaving it short on cash to invest in new vehicles.

That result of that disparity is now becoming evident. A Reuters analysis shows that over the past two years GM has surpassed Ford in pretax profit per vehicle in North America. In 2016, Ford made $2,981 per vehicle, calculated by dividing pretax earnings by the number of vehicles sold, compared with $3,044 for GM. And GM plans to solidify that lead by rolling out a volley of new models aimed at the heart of Ford's lineup.

GM has invested billions of dollars over the past three years to overhaul many of its best-selling truck and SUV models, including the full-size Chevrolet Suburban and Cadillac Escalade SUVs that dominate their sector and typically boast pretax margins of $20,000 or more.

GM also has boosted its share of the U.S. truck market with the 2014 launch of the mid-size Chevrolet Colorado and GMC Canyon pickups. Ford's rival to the Colorado - an all-new Ranger pickup - is not expected to debut until early 2019.

Over the past five years, both companies have spent roughly the same - about 8 percent to 10 percent of revenue - on capital equipment, engineering, and research and development, Reuters analysis shows. But GM has brought far more new and redesigned vehicles to market in the United States in the past three years.

"GM seems to be getting more for its money and realizing the results sooner," said Joe Langley, an analyst with IHS Markit.

MISSED OPPORTUNITY

Earlier this month, Ford's U.S. sales and marketing chief Mark LaNeve acknowledged the company had missed an opportunity by "not participating in" the mid-size truck and compact crossover segments where GM is well positioned.

Ford also has lagged in redesigning its eight-year-old Expedition and Navigator SUVs, which go up against GM's Suburban and Escalade, and finally will be overhauled this fall.

One of the biggest challenges for Ford will come next year, when its market-leading F-150 truck will be challenged by GM's redesigned Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickups.

A year after that, GM is expected to launch new heavy-duty editions of the Silverado and Sierra to challenge Ford's F-Series Super Duty, which is one of the industry's most profitable vehicles.

Altogether, GM plans five launches in 2018 and eight in 2019, according to industry sources familiar with the company's plans. In comparison, Ford expects to unveil only two redesigned vehicles in 2018 and will only reach some kind of parity with six launches in 2019.

REFILE-Ford to name new heads for Europe, Asia - FT - 路透新闻

{{20170525T112242.766+0000}}REFILE-Ford to name new heads for Europe, Asia - FT(Corrects to "heads" from "head" in headline)

May 25 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co , which earlier this week named turnaround expert James Hackett as its chief executive officer, will announce replacements for some of its key executive positions as early as Thursday, the Financial Times reported, citing sources.

The No.2 U.S. automaker will name Steven Armstrong as the new head of Europe, Middle East and Africa and Peter Fleet as the new head of Asia Pacific and China, according to three people familiar with the plans, FT said. (http://on.ft.com/2qiTSVE)

Ford is under pressure from investors over its slumping stock price and its ability to counter threats from longtime rivals and Silicon Valley.

Hackett, who replaced Mark Fields, is the latest in a line of non-family CEOs brought in with a mandate to change the management culture at one of the auto industry's oldest institutions. [nL4N1IO2J0]

The company announced plans to cut 1,400 white-collar positions last week and is expected to look at further significant cost cuts in the coming months.

ANALYSIS-Lack of new launches leaves Ford playing catchup with GM - 路透新闻

{{20170525T050002.090+0000}}ANALYSIS-Lack of new launches leaves Ford playing catchup with GMBy Paul Lienert

DETROIT, May 25 (Reuters) - James Hackett spent the last year plotting Ford Motor Co's long-term self-driving car strategy. In his first week as chief executive, he has more immediate concerns: stopping a skid in North American sales and fending off a market share grab by resurgent archrival General Motors Co .

The U.S. No. 2 automaker is stuck in a product drought that shows no signs of easing until 2019, according to two sources who track Detroit's launch plans. Given the auto industry's long product cycles, it is not clear what Hackett can do immediately to get Ford out of its predicament, which can be traced back to decisions by former CEOs.

Hackett was tapped to run the company's autonomous car and ride-sharing unit a year ago. On Monday he unexpectedly found himself at the helm of the whole company as Ford axed CEO Mark Fields. [nL4N1IO2J0]

He now has to face up to a void of new vehicles, partly caused by former CEO Alan Mulally, who focused much of the company's resources on an expensive 2014 redesign of Ford's crown jewel, the F-Series pickup.

That safeguarded America's longtime best-selling vehicle, but it prevented Ford from developing other hits. Given that it typically takes three to four years for a new or redesigned vehicle to get into production, the full effect of Mulally's narrow focus is now being felt.

Mulally also gambled heavily on making an expensive shift to aluminum from steel to lighten up trucks and make them more fuel efficient, a bet that looks questionable in retrospect, as gas prices have remained far lower than anyone expected.

If Fields had immediately started pulling forward product launches when he took over from Mulally in July 2014, the first of those would likely reach the market in the autumn of 2018 at the earliest. As it is, Ford must wait until early 2019 for its first big slug of new models to hit showrooms.

There is not much Hackett can do about that. Any product moves he makes today would not likely show up in the market before 2021.

"Ford needs to move faster," said RBC auto analyst Joseph Spak.

Hackett, only three days into his new job, has not yet laid out his plans for Ford publicly.

Ford spokesman Michael Levine side-stepped questions of a short-term product drought. "We're bullish on our strong pipeline of all-new cars, trucks and SUVs coming in the next five years," he told Reuters. "What's more, the vehicles that we are launching ... will continue to deliver high transaction prices and good business."

PROFIT PER VEHICLE

For much of the past decade, Ford has benefited from management and marketing problems at GM, including GM's 2009 bankruptcy and a safety scandal that hobbled the company in 2014.

Now, however, Ford confronts a crosstown rival largely free of debt and focused on grabbing market share from Ford, particularly in the truck and SUV segments which account for most of both companies' profits.

GM, the No. 1 U.S. automaker, is in the midst of a prolific four-year patch of new vehicle launches, many approved by Mary Barra, the company's former head of global product development who was named CEO in January 2014.

In hindsight, GM benefited from its bankruptcy, as it emerged essentially debt-free and able to spend more on new products. Ford did not seek bankruptcy during last decade's auto industry crisis, and instead borrowed heavily to survive it, leaving it short on cash to invest in new vehicles.

That result of that disparity is now becoming evident. A Reuters analysis shows that over the past two years GM has surpassed Ford in pretax profit per vehicle in North America. In 2016, Ford made $2,981 per vehicle, calculated by dividing pretax earnings by the number of vehicles sold, compared with $3,044 for GM. And GM plans to solidify that lead by rolling out a volley of new models aimed at the heart of Ford's lineup.

GM has invested billions of dollars over the past three years to overhaul many of its best-selling truck and SUV models, including the full-size Chevrolet Suburban and Cadillac Escalade SUVs that dominate their sector and typically boast pretax margins of $20,000 or more.

GM also has boosted its share of the U.S. truck market with the 2014 launch of the mid-size Chevrolet Colorado and GMC Canyon pickups. Ford's rival to the Colorado - an all-new Ranger pickup - is not expected to debut until early 2019.

Over the past five years, both companies have spent roughly the same - about 8 percent to 10 percent of revenue - on capital equipment, engineering, and research and development, Reuters analysis shows. But GM has brought far more new and redesigned vehicles to market in the United States in the past three years.

"GM seems to be getting more for its money and realizing the results sooner," said Joe Langley, an analyst with IHS Markit.

MISSED OPPORTUNITY

Earlier this month, Ford's U.S. sales and marketing chief Mark LaNeve acknowledged the company had missed an opportunity by "not participating in" the mid-size truck and compact crossover segments where GM is well positioned.

Ford also has lagged in redesigning its eight-year-old Expedition and Navigator SUVs, which go up against GM's Suburban and Escalade, and finally will be overhauled this fall.

One of the biggest challenges for Ford will come next year, when its market-leading F-150 truck will be challenged by GM's redesigned Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickups.

A year after that, GM is expected to launch new heavy-duty editions of the Silverado and Sierra to challenge Ford's F-Series Super Duty, which is one of the industry's most profitable vehicles.

Altogether, GM plans five launches in 2018 and eight in 2019, according to industry sources familiar with the company's plans. In comparison, Ford expects to unveil only two redesigned vehicles in 2018 and will only reach some kind of parity with six launches in 2019.

Late Easter pulls down UK car output by 18 percent in April  - 路透新闻

{{20170524T230100.858+0000}}Late Easter pulls down UK car output by 18 percent in April LONDON, May 25 (Reuters) - British car production fell 18.2 percent in April from a year earlier as the number of manufacturing days in the month was reduced by a later Easter break, an industry body said on Thursday.

Car output fell to 122,116 cars but was still up 1 percent in the first four months of the year at its highest level since 2000, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT).

"Car production fell significantly in April due to the later Easter bank holiday weekend, which reduced the number of active production days that month, and also due to unplanned production adjustments," SMMT Chief Executive Mike Hawes said.

The Easter break was at the end of March in 2016.

There was strike action at BMW's Mini plant in central England - which accounts for just over 10 percent of total industry output - on two days in April. [nL8N1IJ4NT]

The SMMT also called on politicians ahead of a national election due on June 8 to support the country's car manufacturing industry during upcoming talks over Britain's departure from the European Union.

"We need the next government to safeguard the conditions that have made us globally competitive, keeping us open and trading and delivering an ambitious industrial strategy for our sector," Hawes said.

Opinion polls show Prime Minister Theresa May should win the election comfortably.

The SMMT said if Brexit talks take longer than the two years set out in EU legislation, the government should push for arrangements which maintain tariff-free and borderless trade with the EU. More than half the cars made in Britain are exported to the European Union.

Ford , Britain's biggest automotive engine maker, said earlier this month that a transitional deal is "really critical" for the future of its investments in Britain, which include two plants. [nL8N1IC4IK]

UPDATE 3-New Ford CEO eligible for $13.4 mln in annual compensation - 路透新闻

{{20170524T220239.753+0000}}UPDATE 3-New Ford CEO eligible for $13.4 mln in annual compensation(Adds Moody's report, details on Fields, company background)

By David Shepardson

May 24 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co said on Wednesday that new Chief Executive James Hackett is eligible for at least $13.4 million in total annual compensation.

Hackett, 62, a former chief executive of furniture manufacturer Steelcase Inc , was named to replace CEO Mark Fields on Monday. [nL4N1IO2J0]

Hackett will earn a $1.8 million annual salary, up from $716,000 at his previous job as chairman of the Ford unit developing self-driving cars and related projects.

He will receive $7 million in stock-based compensation and pocket a $1 million bonus for becoming CEO. He is also eligible for an annual bonus of up to $3.6 million, plus compensation from his service at Ford's mobility unit.

Fields will retire from the company effective Aug. 1. He resigned from the Ford board immediately. He will be eligible for pro-rated incentive compensation through Aug. 1.

Fields will also be eligible for a company retirement program, a voluntary separation program offered to some management employees.

In March, Ford said Fields received total compensation of $22.1 million for 2016, up nearly 19 percent from $18.6 million.

Joe Hinrichs, head of the Americas since December 2012, who was named on Monday to manage global product development, manufacturing and labor affairs, purchasing, and environmental and safety engineering, received a $5 million restricted stock-based grant.

He received total compensation of $6.7 million in 2016.

Some of the compensation for Hackett will vest over three years. Hackett was elected to Ford's board effective Friday.

Ford replaced Fields amid investor unease about the U.S. automaker's slumping stock price and its ability to counter threats from longtime rivals and Silicon Valley.

Moody's senior vice president Bruce Clark said in a research note the announcement is credit negative and could reflect more serious challenges than previously known. "The appointment of a new CEO at Ford was unexpected and comes in the absence of any major missteps by the company during recent years," he wrote.

Chairman Bill Ford Jr., whose family effectively controls the U.S. No. 2 automaker, said on Monday he wanted Hackett to speed up decision-making and cut costs, but did not elaborate on how the new CEO should change operations.

Hackett said after discussing some management changes announced Monday that "there's more to come later in the week that will round out my team."

Ford last week announced plans to cut 1,400 white-collar positions. [nL2N1IJ0EP] It is expected to consider further significant cost cuts in the next three to six months.

UPDATE 1-BlackBerry climbs on hopes for growth in security, autos  - 路透新闻

{{20170523T174520.241+0000}}UPDATE 1-BlackBerry climbs on hopes for growth in security, autos (Adds analyst comment, details on BlackBerry, byline)

By Alastair Sharp

TORONTO, May 23 (Reuters) - BlackBerry Ltd shares surged to a four-year high in Toronto on Tuesday, extending a two-month rally spurred on by expectations for strong growth in the fast-expanding cyber security and automotive software markets.

The Canadian shares climbed as much as 9.4 percent to C$15.34. As of early afternoon, volume was at about 3 million shares, nearly triple the full-day three-month average.

The rally followed an announcement by Ford Motor Co on Friday that the automaker planned to start updating software on its vehicles using a wireless system to enhance security based on BlackBerry technology.

BlackBerry's U.S.-listed shares gained more than 9 percent on Monday, when Canada's stock market was closed for a holiday.

Some investors believe that Friday's announcement from Ford is a sign that QNX will be more broadly adopted in the auto industry as other automakers start updating their cars using the relatively new over-the-air approach, analysts said.

"BlackBerry is well positioned at the epicenter of this transformation," CCS Insight analyst Nicholas McQuire told Reuters.

McQuire and other analysts also cited this month's global "ransomware" attack, dubbed WannaCry, with helping to raise BlackBerry's profile.

BlackBerry shares have climbed more than 60 percent since they reported stronger-than-expected earnings on March 31, which reinforced expectations that the company is succeeding in re-inventing itself after the collapse of a smartphone business that was once the market leader.

The rally gained steam in mid-April on news that BlackBerry had won a binding arbitration forcing chipmaker Qualcomm Inc to pay it back almost $1 billion. [nL3N1HK42P]

"This chunk of change from Qualcomm has really changed investor sentiment on BlackBerry," said Canaccord Genuity analyst Michael Walkley.

Investors are betting that Chief Executive John Chen will use those funds to build up the company's cyber security and automotive software efforts and possibly make acquisitions related to its relatively new Radar tracking business, Walkley said.

Last week, an equity analyst with Macquarie reported that BlackBerry was working with two luxury automakers to develop a security service that would remotely scan vehicles for computer viruses. [nL2N1II1LK]

The company does not break out cyber security revenue, though Walkley said it accounts for only a small percentage of its business, which remains focused on managing secure connections to mobile devices.

BlackBerry shares jump on hopes for growth in security, auto markets - 路透新闻

{{20170523T150207.000+0000}}BlackBerry shares jump on hopes for growth in security, auto marketsTORONTO, May 23 (Reuters) - BlackBerry Ltd's Toronto-listed shares surged 8.5 percent on Tuesday as investors raised expectations that the technology company's cyber security and automotive software will post strong growth, an analyst said.

This month's global "ransomware" attack, dubbed WannaCry, has raised awareness of BlackBerry's security software business, while prospects for sales of the company's automotive software are on the up, said Nicholas McQuire, an enterprise research analyst at CC Insight.

The stock rose 9.1 percent in U.S. trading on Monday, a market holiday in Canada, after Ford Motor Co said late on Friday that it would start using an "over the air" system to update software on its Sync 3 interactive touchscreen system, which runs on QNX software from BlackBerry. [nL8N1IL4NC]

BlackBerry shares rose C$1.21 cents to C$15.24 on the Toronto Stock Exchange. They dipped 0.3 percent to $11.29 in U.S. Nasdaq trading, following Monday's rally.

A BlackBerry representative could not immediately be reached for comment.

RPT-Investors skeptical Ford CEO change will revive stock price - 路透新闻

{{20170523T110001.824+0000}}RPT-Investors skeptical Ford CEO change will revive stock price(Repeats story published Monday to widen distribution with no changes)

By David Randall

NEW YORK, May 23 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co's unexpected decision to replace its chief executive officer on Monday may not be the catalyst that revives its slumping share prices.

Shares of the second-largest U.S. automaker rose 2.1 percent Monday, a relatively muted reaction given the 0.5 percent gain in the broad Standard & Poor's 500 index <.SPX>. Over the last 12 months, shares of Ford are down nearly 16 percent due to concerns of declining automobile sales and the threat of autonomous vehicles to shrink future demand. [nL4N1IO2J0]

The S&P 500 index has jumped nearly 17 percent over the same time, while shares of competitor General Motors Co are up about 8 percent and shares of electronic vehicle pioneer Tesla Inc are up nearly 41 percent.

"There's just nothing out there that looks like it will get the stock moving," said Gary Bradshaw, an analyst at Dallas-based Hodges Capital, who said that he attended a luncheon with outgoing CEO Mark Fields about two months ago in which Fields pressed the portfolio managers sitting around him about why they were not buying shares in the company.

The change in the company's leadership does not solve the structural problems facing the industry, said Bradshaw, who does not own shares in the company and does not plan on adding them.

"GM is in the same boat. They don't have a car out there like a Tesla that is getting people excited and saying they need to buy it," he said.

One significant auto investor who declined to be named said the CEO change would probably not be a catalyst for the stock.

"The company hasn't kept pace with innovation, and the sector faces long-term problems," the person said.

At $51 billion, the market valuation of Tesla Motors is larger than both Ford and General Motors at a time when the company is not profitable, in large part due to expectations that it has greater growth potential than its more established rivals. Ford, which announced plans to cut 1,400 white-collar positions last week, is expected to look at further significant cost cuts in the next three to six months, company officials told Reuters. [nL2N1IJ0EP] Ford's lower stock price could also be due to far lower buy-back spending than GM's, analysts said. Ford's buy-back spending - net retirement of stock - was $145 billion or $2.6 billion over five years, with the bulk coming in 2014 which was a one-time buy-back to offset the dilution of both stock that was going to come onto market from an employee stock ownership plan and from convertible notes that were due to become exercisable for conversion to shares.

GM's buy-back spending was $2.5 billion last year and $16.8 billion over five years.

Ford has a dividend yield of 5.5 percent, versus General Motors of 4.6 percent.

Ford has felt less pressure from outside activists to undertake efforts to boost its share price, in large part because the Ford family, which holds nearly 40 percent of the voting power among shareholders. GM, by comparison, has fended off calls from well known hedge funds like David Einhorn's Greenlight Capital, which has pressed the company to split the company's stock. [nL1N1HX1A2]

Ford's new chief executive, James Hackett, who had been overseeing its division focused on self-driving cars, has a reputation as a turnaround artist for guiding changes at furniture maker Steelcase Inc that helped it regain its market leading position, though those reforms did not always benefit shareholders.

Over the 18 years that Hackett oversaw Steelcase as a public company, the stock fell by more than 55 percent and delivered a total return, including reinvested dividends of negative 22.3 percent, or an annualized total return under his tenure of negative 1.54 percent. By contrast, the S&P 500 generated an annualized total return over the same run of 5.62 percent.

Notably, on both a price and total return basis, Steelcase underperformed its main competitors like Herman Miller Inc and HNI Corp by substantial margins on a cumulative basis.

Other management changes at the company could be coming as Hackett attempts to reposition the company for a new era of electric vehicles and autonomous driving, said Adam Jonas, an analyst at Morgan Stanley. That could mean that "the earnings situation may need to get materially worse before it gets better," he wrote in a note Monday.

EXCLUSIVE-N. American carmakers want rules of origin in NAFTA left untouched -Mexico lobby - 路透新闻

{{20170522T233635.320+0000}}EXCLUSIVE-N. American carmakers want rules of origin in NAFTA left untouched -Mexico lobby(Adds comments from Mexican car lobby's president, background)

By Anthony Esposito and Sharay Angulo

MEXICO CITY, May 22 (Reuters) - The auto industries of the United States, Canada and Mexico agree there should be no changes to rules of origin in the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the president of the Mexican automakers' association said on Monday.

Under the trade deal between the United States, Mexico and Canada, rules of origin stipulate that products must meet minimum regional, or NAFTA-wide, content requirements to be tariff-free.

"Our position is that the trade agreement has been a success, and we shouldn't be touching something as important as the rules of origin," Eduardo Solis, president of Mexican automakers' industry group AMIA, told Reuters in an interview.

NAFTA's rules of origin, said Solis, have been key in creating value and integrating the auto industry in North America.

"In terms of access to markets and rules of origin, what we have is a shared position," said Solis.

Mexico boasts plants owned by global automakers including General Motors Co , Ford Motor Co , Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and Volkswagen AG .

The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday triggered a 90-day consultation period with Congress, industries and the American public that would allow talks over NAFTA, one of the world's biggest trading blocs, to begin by Aug. 16. [nL2N1IK13Y]

Authorities and businesses in Mexico have been bracing for the looming renegotiation, as Trump has insisted that a new pact must be more beneficial to American workers and companies.

Solis said it was important to not become overconfident before the actual negotiations kick off.

"We need to remain cautious and at the same time prepare the data that shows why NAFTA has been a success for the three nations," said Solis.

Mexico's booming auto sector has been a clear beneficiary of NAFTA as a wide range of international automakers have made Latin America's second biggest economy a key export hub, attracted by cheap labor costs and free trade accords with dozens of nations.

Late Easter pulls down UK car output by 18 percent in April  - 路透新闻

{{20170524T230100.858+0000}}Late Easter pulls down UK car output by 18 percent in April LONDON, May 25 (Reuters) - British car production fell 18.2 percent in April from a year earlier as the number of manufacturing days in the month was reduced by a later Easter break, an industry body said on Thursday.

Car output fell to 122,116 cars but was still up 1 percent in the first four months of the year at its highest level since 2000, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT).

"Car production fell significantly in April due to the later Easter bank holiday weekend, which reduced the number of active production days that month, and also due to unplanned production adjustments," SMMT Chief Executive Mike Hawes said.

The Easter break was at the end of March in 2016.

There was strike action at BMW's Mini plant in central England - which accounts for just over 10 percent of total industry output - on two days in April. [nL8N1IJ4NT]

The SMMT also called on politicians ahead of a national election due on June 8 to support the country's car manufacturing industry during upcoming talks over Britain's departure from the European Union.

"We need the next government to safeguard the conditions that have made us globally competitive, keeping us open and trading and delivering an ambitious industrial strategy for our sector," Hawes said.

Opinion polls show Prime Minister Theresa May should win the election comfortably.

The SMMT said if Brexit talks take longer than the two years set out in EU legislation, the government should push for arrangements which maintain tariff-free and borderless trade with the EU. More than half the cars made in Britain are exported to the European Union.

Ford , Britain's biggest automotive engine maker, said earlier this month that a transitional deal is "really critical" for the future of its investments in Britain, which include two plants. [nL8N1IC4IK]

UPDATE 3-New Ford CEO eligible for $13.4 mln in annual compensation - 路透新闻

{{20170524T220239.753+0000}}UPDATE 3-New Ford CEO eligible for $13.4 mln in annual compensation(Adds Moody's report, details on Fields, company background)

By David Shepardson

May 24 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co said on Wednesday that new Chief Executive James Hackett is eligible for at least $13.4 million in total annual compensation.

Hackett, 62, a former chief executive of furniture manufacturer Steelcase Inc , was named to replace CEO Mark Fields on Monday. [nL4N1IO2J0]

Hackett will earn a $1.8 million annual salary, up from $716,000 at his previous job as chairman of the Ford unit developing self-driving cars and related projects.

He will receive $7 million in stock-based compensation and pocket a $1 million bonus for becoming CEO. He is also eligible for an annual bonus of up to $3.6 million, plus compensation from his service at Ford's mobility unit.

Fields will retire from the company effective Aug. 1. He resigned from the Ford board immediately. He will be eligible for pro-rated incentive compensation through Aug. 1.

Fields will also be eligible for a company retirement program, a voluntary separation program offered to some management employees.

In March, Ford said Fields received total compensation of $22.1 million for 2016, up nearly 19 percent from $18.6 million.

Joe Hinrichs, head of the Americas since December 2012, who was named on Monday to manage global product development, manufacturing and labor affairs, purchasing, and environmental and safety engineering, received a $5 million restricted stock-based grant.

He received total compensation of $6.7 million in 2016.

Some of the compensation for Hackett will vest over three years. Hackett was elected to Ford's board effective Friday.

Ford replaced Fields amid investor unease about the U.S. automaker's slumping stock price and its ability to counter threats from longtime rivals and Silicon Valley.

Moody's senior vice president Bruce Clark said in a research note the announcement is credit negative and could reflect more serious challenges than previously known. "The appointment of a new CEO at Ford was unexpected and comes in the absence of any major missteps by the company during recent years," he wrote.

Chairman Bill Ford Jr., whose family effectively controls the U.S. No. 2 automaker, said on Monday he wanted Hackett to speed up decision-making and cut costs, but did not elaborate on how the new CEO should change operations.

Hackett said after discussing some management changes announced Monday that "there's more to come later in the week that will round out my team."

Ford last week announced plans to cut 1,400 white-collar positions. [nL2N1IJ0EP] It is expected to consider further significant cost cuts in the next three to six months.

UPDATE 1-BlackBerry climbs on hopes for growth in security, autos  - 路透新闻

{{20170523T174520.241+0000}}UPDATE 1-BlackBerry climbs on hopes for growth in security, autos (Adds analyst comment, details on BlackBerry, byline)

By Alastair Sharp

TORONTO, May 23 (Reuters) - BlackBerry Ltd shares surged to a four-year high in Toronto on Tuesday, extending a two-month rally spurred on by expectations for strong growth in the fast-expanding cyber security and automotive software markets.

The Canadian shares climbed as much as 9.4 percent to C$15.34. As of early afternoon, volume was at about 3 million shares, nearly triple the full-day three-month average.

The rally followed an announcement by Ford Motor Co on Friday that the automaker planned to start updating software on its vehicles using a wireless system to enhance security based on BlackBerry technology.

BlackBerry's U.S.-listed shares gained more than 9 percent on Monday, when Canada's stock market was closed for a holiday.

Ford's Sync 3 interactive system for cars runs on BlackBerry's QNX operating system, which is capable of delivering software updates "over the air." [nL8N1IL4NC]

Some investors believe that Friday's announcement from Ford is a sign that QNX will be more broadly adopted in the auto industry as other automakers start updating their cars using the relatively new over-the-air approach, analysts said.

"BlackBerry is well positioned at the epicenter of this transformation," CCS Insight analyst Nicholas McQuire told Reuters.

McQuire and other analysts also cited this month's global "ransomware" attack, dubbed WannaCry, with helping to raise BlackBerry's profile.

BlackBerry shares have climbed more than 60 percent since they reported stronger-than-expected earnings on March 31, which reinforced expectations that the company is succeeding in re-inventing itself after the collapse of a smartphone business that was once the market leader.

The rally gained steam in mid-April on news that BlackBerry had won a binding arbitration forcing chipmaker Qualcomm Inc to pay it back almost $1 billion. [nL3N1HK42P]

"This chunk of change from Qualcomm has really changed investor sentiment on BlackBerry," said Canaccord Genuity analyst Michael Walkley.

Investors are betting that Chief Executive John Chen will use those funds to build up the company's cyber security and automotive software efforts and possibly make acquisitions related to its relatively new Radar tracking business, Walkley said.

Last week, an equity analyst with Macquarie reported that BlackBerry was working with two luxury automakers to develop a security service that would remotely scan vehicles for computer viruses. [nL2N1II1LK]

The company does not break out cyber security revenue, though Walkley said it accounts for only a small percentage of its business, which remains focused on managing secure connections to mobile devices.

BlackBerry shares jump on hopes for growth in security, auto markets - 路透新闻

{{20170523T150207.000+0000}}BlackBerry shares jump on hopes for growth in security, auto marketsTORONTO, May 23 (Reuters) - BlackBerry Ltd's Toronto-listed shares surged 8.5 percent on Tuesday as investors raised expectations that the technology company's cyber security and automotive software will post strong growth, an analyst said.

This month's global "ransomware" attack, dubbed WannaCry, has raised awareness of BlackBerry's security software business, while prospects for sales of the company's automotive software are on the up, said Nicholas McQuire, an enterprise research analyst at CC Insight.

The stock rose 9.1 percent in U.S. trading on Monday, a market holiday in Canada, after Ford Motor Co said late on Friday that it would start using an "over the air" system to update software on its Sync 3 interactive touchscreen system, which runs on QNX software from BlackBerry. [nL8N1IL4NC]

BlackBerry shares rose C$1.21 cents to C$15.24 on the Toronto Stock Exchange. They dipped 0.3 percent to $11.29 in U.S. Nasdaq trading, following Monday's rally.

A BlackBerry representative could not immediately be reached for comment.

RPT-Investors skeptical Ford CEO change will revive stock price - 路透新闻

{{20170523T110001.824+0000}}RPT-Investors skeptical Ford CEO change will revive stock price(Repeats story published Monday to widen distribution with no changes)

By David Randall

NEW YORK, May 23 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co's unexpected decision to replace its chief executive officer on Monday may not be the catalyst that revives its slumping share prices.

Shares of the second-largest U.S. automaker rose 2.1 percent Monday, a relatively muted reaction given the 0.5 percent gain in the broad Standard & Poor's 500 index <.SPX>. Over the last 12 months, shares of Ford are down nearly 16 percent due to concerns of declining automobile sales and the threat of autonomous vehicles to shrink future demand. [nL4N1IO2J0]

The S&P 500 index has jumped nearly 17 percent over the same time, while shares of competitor General Motors Co are up about 8 percent and shares of electronic vehicle pioneer Tesla Inc are up nearly 41 percent.

"There's just nothing out there that looks like it will get the stock moving," said Gary Bradshaw, an analyst at Dallas-based Hodges Capital, who said that he attended a luncheon with outgoing CEO Mark Fields about two months ago in which Fields pressed the portfolio managers sitting around him about why they were not buying shares in the company.

The change in the company's leadership does not solve the structural problems facing the industry, said Bradshaw, who does not own shares in the company and does not plan on adding them.

"GM is in the same boat. They don't have a car out there like a Tesla that is getting people excited and saying they need to buy it," he said.

One significant auto investor who declined to be named said the CEO change would probably not be a catalyst for the stock.

"The company hasn't kept pace with innovation, and the sector faces long-term problems," the person said.

At $51 billion, the market valuation of Tesla Motors is larger than both Ford and General Motors at a time when the company is not profitable, in large part due to expectations that it has greater growth potential than its more established rivals. Ford, which announced plans to cut 1,400 white-collar positions last week, is expected to look at further significant cost cuts in the next three to six months, company officials told Reuters. [nL2N1IJ0EP] Ford's lower stock price could also be due to far lower buy-back spending than GM's, analysts said. Ford's buy-back spending - net retirement of stock - was $145 billion or $2.6 billion over five years, with the bulk coming in 2014 which was a one-time buy-back to offset the dilution of both stock that was going to come onto market from an employee stock ownership plan and from convertible notes that were due to become exercisable for conversion to shares.

GM's buy-back spending was $2.5 billion last year and $16.8 billion over five years.

Ford has a dividend yield of 5.5 percent, versus General Motors of 4.6 percent.

Ford has felt less pressure from outside activists to undertake efforts to boost its share price, in large part because the Ford family, which holds nearly 40 percent of the voting power among shareholders. GM, by comparison, has fended off calls from well known hedge funds like David Einhorn's Greenlight Capital, which has pressed the company to split the company's stock. [nL1N1HX1A2]

Ford's new chief executive, James Hackett, who had been overseeing its division focused on self-driving cars, has a reputation as a turnaround artist for guiding changes at furniture maker Steelcase Inc that helped it regain its market leading position, though those reforms did not always benefit shareholders.

Over the 18 years that Hackett oversaw Steelcase as a public company, the stock fell by more than 55 percent and delivered a total return, including reinvested dividends of negative 22.3 percent, or an annualized total return under his tenure of negative 1.54 percent. By contrast, the S&P 500 generated an annualized total return over the same run of 5.62 percent.

Notably, on both a price and total return basis, Steelcase underperformed its main competitors like Herman Miller Inc and HNI Corp by substantial margins on a cumulative basis.

Other management changes at the company could be coming as Hackett attempts to reposition the company for a new era of electric vehicles and autonomous driving, said Adam Jonas, an analyst at Morgan Stanley. That could mean that "the earnings situation may need to get materially worse before it gets better," he wrote in a note Monday.

EXCLUSIVE-N. American carmakers want rules of origin in NAFTA left untouched -Mexico lobby - 路透新闻

{{20170522T233635.320+0000}}EXCLUSIVE-N. American carmakers want rules of origin in NAFTA left untouched -Mexico lobby(Adds comments from Mexican car lobby's president, background)

By Anthony Esposito and Sharay Angulo

MEXICO CITY, May 22 (Reuters) - The auto industries of the United States, Canada and Mexico agree there should be no changes to rules of origin in the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the president of the Mexican automakers' association said on Monday.

Under the trade deal between the United States, Mexico and Canada, rules of origin stipulate that products must meet minimum regional, or NAFTA-wide, content requirements to be tariff-free.

"Our position is that the trade agreement has been a success, and we shouldn't be touching something as important as the rules of origin," Eduardo Solis, president of Mexican automakers' industry group AMIA, told Reuters in an interview.

NAFTA's rules of origin, said Solis, have been key in creating value and integrating the auto industry in North America.

"In terms of access to markets and rules of origin, what we have is a shared position," said Solis.

Mexico boasts plants owned by global automakers including General Motors Co , Ford Motor Co , Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and Volkswagen AG .

The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday triggered a 90-day consultation period with Congress, industries and the American public that would allow talks over NAFTA, one of the world's biggest trading blocs, to begin by Aug. 16. [nL2N1IK13Y]

Authorities and businesses in Mexico have been bracing for the looming renegotiation, as Trump has insisted that a new pact must be more beneficial to American workers and companies.

Solis said it was important to not become overconfident before the actual negotiations kick off.

"We need to remain cautious and at the same time prepare the data that shows why NAFTA has been a success for the three nations," said Solis.

Mexico's booming auto sector has been a clear beneficiary of NAFTA as a wide range of international automakers have made Latin America's second biggest economy a key export hub, attracted by cheap labor costs and free trade accords with dozens of nations.

BREAKINGVIEWS-CEO ejection hardly gets Ford back in the race - 路透新闻

{{20170522T112656.609+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-CEO ejection hardly gets Ford back in the race(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.)

By Rob Cox

SHANGHAI, May 22 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Ford Motor's many flubs under Mark Fields were becoming existential for the $43 billion carmaker's founding family. Two weeks ago, a majority of those shareholders not named Ford voted to abolish the family's super-voting stock. The Fords took the hint, and the chief executive is now leaving. But naming a 62-year-old from the furniture trade to replace him hints at how unprepared the family was for a revolt.

That Fields' job was in jeopardy was no secret. The 36 percent decline in Ford shares since he replaced Alan Mulally nearly three years ago was the mathematical manifestation of investors' discontent in his stewardship. Even General Motors only withstood a 10 percent slide, while Fiat Chrysler and Tesla both increased strongly.

Despite robust investment, Ford is perceived to be lagging rivals – not just Tesla but even dowdy GM – in developing the next generation of electric and self-driving cars. Car sales are down this year, and margins are under pressure.

This sparked a last-ditch move by Fields a week ago to cut white-collar workers, potentially irritating jobs-obsessed President Donald Trump, with whom the company clashed over plans to move production of some small cars to Mexico. It backtracked on that decision, in part because of slack demand for those vehicles.

All these woes coalesced at Ford's annual meeting. Not only did shareholders call out Fields. Some 35 percent of them also voted to scrap the dual-class share structure that gives the descendants of Henry Ford two-fifths of the vote with less than 2 percent of the stock. Stripping out the family's votes meant that at least 58.5 percent of investors favored moving to one share, one vote – an act of open rebellion.

What's surprising is the family's solution: appointing an old executive from an unrelated industry. That worked with Mulally, a former Boeing executive, who arrived in 2006 and kept Ford from bankruptcy. Jim Hackett, who runs Ford's autonomous vehicle division, is a year older than Mulally was. He ran another old Midwestern industrial company, furniture maker Steelcase , for nearly two decades. The company went public in 1998 at $28 a share – a price it has not seen since.

CORRECTED-Ford to replace CEO Mark Fields with James Hackett - Forbes - 路透新闻

{{20170522T065214.799+0000}}CORRECTED-Ford to replace CEO Mark Fields with James Hackett - Forbes(Corrects spelling to 'Hackett' in headline and second paragraph)

May 22 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co Chief Executive Mark Fields will leave the carmaker as part of a shake-up that includes other top executive changes, Forbes reported late on Sunday, citing a person familiar with the situation.

James Hackett, head of Ford Smart Mobility LLC, will become its new CEO and an announcement could come as early as Monday morning, Forbes reported.

The shakeup is a result of Executive Chairman Bill Ford and the rest of the board losing confidence in Fields' leadership, Forbes reported, citing people familiar with the matter. http://bit.ly/2qG5tkg

Ford will also replace group vice president of communications, Ray Day, with Mark Truby, vice president of communications for Ford's Asia-Pacific operations, Forbes said.

A Ford spokesman in Europe declined to comment "on speculation or rumors."

"We are staying focused on our plan for creating value and profitable growth," the spokesperson said.

Ford using first over-the-air software updates to its 2016 cars - 路透新闻

{{20170519T191801.849+0000}}Ford using first over-the-air software updates to its 2016 carsSAN FRANCISCO, May 19 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co said on Friday it would delve into the growing arena of "over-the-air" software updates, adding Android Auto and Apple CarPlay to its Sync 3-equipped 2016 vehicles for the first time via a wireless software update.

The latest upgrade to Sync 3, Ford's interactive touch-screen system, will be accomplished through an over-the-air (OTA) update using Wi-Fi, not unlike how new software gets uploaded to smartphones by manufacturers.

After Tesla Inc's early lead in 2015 introducing OTAs, traditional automakers are slowly beginning to embrace the new technology, within limits. Concerns about security and resistance from dealers worried about losing service revenue have hampered its adoption.

Thus far, established automakers have not used OTAs for safety systems, only for non-critical systems like infotainment.

Customers can also get the update via the traditional means of visiting their dealer or using a USB drive, Ford said.

Android Auto and Apple CarPlay are operating systems from Alphabet's Google and Apple Inc that allow drivers to connect their smartphones to their vehicles' dashboard.

Ford's first use of OTAs comes about two months after it said it would hire 400 engineers to work on connectivity, mostly from Blackberry Ltd's shuttered phone handset business. Blackberry QNX powers Ford's Sync 3 system. [nL2N1H6281]

Besides being more convenient for customers, OTAs can bring automakers cost savings, as a substantial percentage of warranty repair issues and recalls can be corrected through OTAs.

UPDATE 1-Ford to invest $350 mln in Livonia transmission plant in Michigan - 路透新闻

{{20170519T153928.771+0000}}UPDATE 1-Ford to invest $350 mln in Livonia transmission plant in Michigan(Adds details, prior investments, current stock price)

By David Shepardson

WASHINGTON, May 19 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co said Friday it would invest $350 million to upgrade its Livonia transmission plant in Michigan as the company expands its lineup of powertrains.

The investment is part of the company's previously disclosed commitment to invest $9 billion and create or retain 8,500 hourly jobs in its U.S. facilities in the next few years. [nBw6SGhd6a]

Last year, the No. 2 U.S. automaker announced it was investing a separate $1.4 billion in the Livonia transmission plant near Detroit. The company said Friday employment at the Livonia plant has risen from about 1,550 last year to 1,800. The company did not say how many additional jobs it will add.

The automaker announced earlier this week it was cutting 1,400 salaried jobs in North America and Asia as it looks to boost its sagging stock price. The company plans to cut $3 billion in costs. [nL2N1IJ0EP]

But Ford said it is not cutting its hourly workforce or production. Automakers have been under pressure from President Donald Trump to add jobs or build U.S. new plants.

Ford has invested $12 billion in its U.S. plants and created nearly 28,000 U.S. jobs during the last five years.

The company continues to churn out strong profits, reporting a record $10.4 billion in pretax earnings in 2016, and expects to earn around $9 billion this year.

But it is under pressure to boost its stock price. Ford shares are down nearly 40 percent since Mark Fields took over as chief executive officer in July 2014 and closed at a nearly four-and-half-year low earlier this week.

Ford shares rose 1 percent in trading Friday.

The automaker is offering financial incentives, including generous early retirement offers, to encourage salaried employees to depart voluntarily by the end of September. Investors are worried about slowing sales and an industry that could be dominated by autonomous vehicles and car sharing in the future.

UPDATE 3-Four car makers settle claims over Takata inflators for $553 mln - 路透新闻

{{20170519T054852.591+0000}}UPDATE 3-Four car makers settle claims over Takata inflators for $553 mln* Toyota, BMW, Mazda, Subaru settle class action claims

(Adds share price move)

By David Shepardson and Naomi Tajitsu

WASHINGTON/TOKYO, May 19 (Reuters) - Four automakers agreed to a $553 million settlement to address class-action economic loss claims covering owners of nearly 16 million recalled vehicles with potentially defective Takata airbag inflators, court documents filed on Thursday showed.

Toyota Motor Corp's <7203.T> share of the settlement costs is $278.5 million, followed by BMW AG at $131 million, Mazda Motor Co <7261.T> at $76 million and Subaru Corp <7270.T> at $68 million.

While the settlement does not mean an end to legal headaches faced by Takata Corp <7312.T> or its car maker clients, the resolution could help the embattled Japanese air bag maker's efforts to search for a financial sponsor by removing one litigation uncertainty.

Shares of Takata, which was not named as a plaintiff in the case, jumped 20 percent in Tokyo on Friday. Takata has been searching for more than a year to find a financial sponsor to pay for costs to replace its inflators which are at the centre of the auto industry's biggest-ever recall.

U.S. auto components maker Key Safety Systems (KSS) and private equity fund Bain Capital are trying to strike a rescue deal worth around 200 billion yen with Takata's steering committee and its automaker customers. [nL8N1HA098]

The settlement highlights the knock-on effect of the recalls, which began around 2008 and covers around 100 million inflators around the world used in vehicles made by 19 automakers.

Takata's inflators can explode with excessive force and unleash metal shrapnel inside cars and trucks, and are blamed for at least 16 deaths and more than 180 injuries worldwide.

"This is a settlement between us and our customers," said a Tokyo-based spokeswoman for Mazda.

Lawsuits against Honda Motor Co <7267.T>, Ford Motor Co and Nissan Motor Co <7201.T> have not been settled, lawyers said.

Takata declined to comment on the settlement.

The four automakers who settled said in a joint statement they agreed to the deal "given the size, scope and severity of the Takata recall," but did not admit fault or liability. The automakers said the settlements, if approved by a Florida judge, will be overseen by a court-appointed administrator.

The settlement includes an outreach program to contact owners; compensation for economic losses including out-of-pocket expenses; a possible residual distribution payment of up to $500; rental cars for some owners; and a customer support program for repairs and adjustments, including an extended warranty.

In January, Takata agreed to plead guilty to U.S. charges of criminal wrongdoing and to pay $1 billion to resolve a federal investigation into its inflators. The majority of the air bag-related fatalities and injuries have occurred in the United States.

Automakers have recalled 46 million Takata air bag inflators in 29 million U.S. vehicles. By 2019, automakers will recall 64 million to 69 million U.S. inflators in 42 million vehicles, regulators said in December. Most inflators have not been fixed.

GM to stop selling cars in India but not pulling out - 路透新闻

{{20170518T073032.717+0000}}GM to stop selling cars in India but not pulling outBy Norihiko Shirouzu

BEIJING, May 18 (Reuters) - General Motors Co will stop selling cars in India from the end of this year, drawing a line under two decades of battling in one of the world's most competitive markets where it has less than a one percent share of passenger car sales.

The decision was announced as part of a series of restructuring actions from the Detroit automaker on Thursday, and marks a significant blow to India's strategy of encouraging domestic manufacturing. [nL2N1IJ11Q]

GM says it would no longer market its Chevrolet brand - its only brand of cars marketed in India - despite India's promise as a market set to overtake Japan as the world's third largest in the next decade.

But it doesn't plan to leave India entirely.

It plans to keep operating its tech center in Bangalore and to refocus its India manufacturing operations by making one of its two assembly plants in India – the one at Talegaon, about 100 km (62 miles) southeast of Mumbai – into an export-only factory. It plans to sell the Halol plant in the western Gujarat state to Chinese joint venture partner SAIC Motor Corp <600104.SS> .

"We are not giving up benefits India offers as a local cost manufacturing hub with an excellent supplier base which is extremely competitive," Stefan Jacoby, GM's chief of international operations, said in an interview.

GM's exports from India, mainly to Mexico and Latin America, nearly doubled to 70,969 vehicles in the fiscal year than ended on March 31. The Talegaon plant has a capacity of 130,000 vehicles a year.

Jacoby said the move to turn the Talegaon assembly into an export-only plant will not impact GM Korea and its position as an export hub. India will export vehicles mostly to Mexico and South America, among other destinations, while GM Korea will ship Korean-made cars to North America, Southeast Asia, Australia and Pakistan.

Dan Ammann, GM's global president, said the restructuring actions for India announced on Thursday in essence cancels "most" of the plan GM unveiled in 2015 to invest $1 billion in India to deploy newly-designed vehicle architecture as part of a Global Emerging Market vehicle programme or GEM for short, and build a new line of low-cost vehicles in India.

The decisions to significantly scale down GM's operations in India are results of months of analysis over "where we are going to place our bets (globally) as a company," Ammann said in an interview.

LATEST BLOW

The move is the latest blow to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's "Make in India initiative," aimed at making the country a global manufacturing powerhouse.

Last year, Ford Motor Co shelved plans to produce a new compact car family designed mainly for emerging markets. India and China had been slated to be the main manufacturing hubs for the new range that was set to begin production in 2018. [nL8N1BH1K5]

The auto sector is a major employment generator accounting for about 29 million direct and indirect jobs in India. Moreover, the $93 billion industry contributes 7.1 percent to the nation's gross domestic product and almost 50 percent of India's manufacturing output.

Ammann said GM looked at many options but determined that the investment originally planned for India would not deliver the kind of return other global opportunities offered.

GM plans to continue to work on the $5 billion GEM programme, which GM is developing with SAIC Motor. Ammann said the programme remains on track, even without India now, to account for about 2 million vehicles a year in global sales volume, mainly in Latin America, Mexico and China.

Despite being an early entrant, GM has struggled to boost its sales and market share in India in part because it has failed to launch low-cost yet feature-rich vehicles that Indian buyers prefer, according to analysts. Many of them also blame the high cost of maintaining and servicing Chevy cars for deterring cost-conscious buyers in India.

GM said in 2015 it aimed to double its India market share to around 3 percent or more by 2020. But its market share fell to below 1 percent in the year ended March 31 from 1.17 percent the previous year - even as India's market grew 9 percent to climb above the 3 million vehicle level. GM's volume in India fell by a fifth to 25,823 vehicles in the year ended March 31.

The GEM vehicle architecture, which is being engineered as an emerging-market platform technology for markets such as China, Brazil, Mexico and India, was envisioned to help GM come up with more cost-competitive cars. But for India, GEM was still too pricey a technology since it has been designed under GM's global vehicle safety, performance and other standards.

To be successful in India, Jacoby said one option for GM was to "give up on implementing global platform and vehicle standards". The other was to team up with a local partner to run full operations as an automaker designing products and manufacturing and marketing products locally.

"We have made the decision that these two options are not for us," Jacoby said.

GM will cut operations in India, South Africa - 路透新闻

{{20170518T073004.846+0000}}GM will cut operations in India, South AfricaBy Joseph White

DETROIT, May 18 (Reuters) - General Motors Co plans to quit selling vehicles in India by the end of this year and will sell operations in South Africa, the latest steps in a strategy of focusing cash and engineering effort on fewer, more profitable markets.

The Detroit automaker said on Thursday it will take a $500 million charge in the second quarter to restructure operations in India, Africa and Singapore. It will cancel most of a planned $1 billion investment to build a new line of low-cost vehicles in India.

About $200 million of the charge will be a cash expense, GM said. The moves are expected to save $100 million a year in a sector of GM's global business that last year lost about $800 million, the company said.

GM President Dan Ammann told Reuters in an interview that the latest restructuring moves - and a series of earlier decisions to quit unprofitable markets - allow GM to focus more money, engineering effort and senior management time on expanding where the company is strong, including China and the North American pickup and SUV business, where GM has a "product onslaught coming."

GM also has said it is investing about $600 million a year in efforts to develop autonomous vehicles and transportation services.

"What are we spending our time doing?" Ammann said. "Are we spending time pursuing opportunities … or all of our time fixing problems?"

GM, like its Detroit rival Ford Motor Co, has found it increasingly expensive to compete in emerging markets outside of China. GM sold just 49,000 vehicles in India and South Africa combined last year.

Chief Executive Mary Barra traveled to New Delhi in 2015 to announce a plan to invest $1 billion there to build a new line of Chevrolet models developed as part of a Global Emerging Market vehicle program - GEM for short. Since then, auto sales overall in India have slumped, and GM has failed to gain traction against incumbents such as Maruti Suzuki India Ltd.

Now, GM plans to stop selling Chevrolet brand vehicles by the end of the year and will produce vehicles only for export at its remaining factory in Talegaon. The company currently employs about 2,500 workers there.

GM said it would continue work at its design and engineering center near Bangalore.

PULLING BACK IN SOUTH AFRICA

The $5 billion GEM program, which GM is developing with its Chinese partner Shanghai Automotive Industries Corp, remains on track to account for about 2 million vehicles a year in global sales volume, mainly in Latin America, Mexico and China, Ammann said.

"The market opportunity for GEM has continued to grow," he said.

In a separate move, GM plans to stop building Chevrolet vehicles in South Africa and sell its South African factory to Japan's Isuzu Motors Ltd <7202.T>, along with the 30 percent stake the U.S. automaker owns in a truck venture with Isuzu Motors <7202.T>. Isuzu agreed in February to buy out GM's 57.7 percent stake in a joint venture in Kenya.

GM also will cut an undisclosed number of staff at its GM International Operations headquarters in Singapore. About 200 people work in that operation, the company said.

Since Barra took over GM in 2014, the one-time largest automaker in the world has taken aggressive steps to narrow its focus to China, the highly-profitable North American light truck and sport utility market, Latin America, vehicle financing and transportation services that ultimately could use autonomous vehicles. [nL2N1GJ0H3]

Despite the restructuring moves, including Barra's decision in March to sell loss-making European operations to French rival Peugeot SA , GM's share price has been stuck in a range close around $33 where it went public in 2010 following a government-funded bankruptcy. GM shares closed on Wednesday at $32.42.

Barra and GM's directors are under pressure from David Einhorn's Greenlight Capital, which wants GM to split its common stock into two classes, one that pays dividends and a second that would be valued to reflect the company's potential growth. Greenlight also has put forward a slate of three new directors. GM's management and incumbent board have rejected Greenlight's proposals. [nL4N1I6482] The hedge fund holds 54.8 million GM shares, or about 3.5 percent of the total.

UPDATE 3-Ford to cut 1,400 white-collar jobs, shares tumble - 路透新闻

{{20170517T193737.369+0000}}UPDATE 3-Ford to cut 1,400 white-collar jobs, shares tumble(Adds more details on Ford plans)

By David Shepardson

NEW YORK, May 17 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co said on Wednesday it plans to cut 1,400 salaried jobs in North America and Asia through voluntary early retirement and other financial incentives as the No. 2 U.S. automaker looks to boost its sagging stock price.

Ford shares fell as much as 2.5 percent in heavy trading and were headed to their worst close since November 2012 as the broader markets tumbled over the political turmoil in Washington.

The buyout offers were a fraction of the 20,000 job cuts that some news outlets had reported Ford could announce this week.

Ford said the cuts would amount to about 10 percent of a group of 15,000 managers and other non-production workers and would reduce labor costs for that segment by 10 percent.

The company said a large group of salaried workers would not be covered by the planned cuts, including those in product development and in the Ford Credit unit. The cuts will not apply to Ford's Europe or South America units.

About two-thirds of the buyout offers are in North America and the rest in Asia. Ford does not plan to cut hourly workers or production.

The automaker will offer financial incentives, including generous early retirement offers, to encourage salaried employees to depart voluntarily by the end of September. Ford said it expects it will hit the targets through voluntary offers, spokesman Mike Moran said.

"Reducing costs and becoming as lean and efficient as possible also remain part of that work," Moran said.

The voluntary incentives offers will go to about 9,600 of 30,000 U.S. salaried workers, the company said.

In 2016, Ford cut hundreds of white-collar jobs in Europe, reducing costs by $200 million annually.

Ford continues to churn out strong profits, reporting a record $10.4 billion in pretax earnings in 2016, and expects to earn around $9 billion this year.

But investors are worried about slowing sales and an industry that could be dominated by autonomous vehicles and car sharing in the future.

The Detroit automakers have been under pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump to add jobs in the United States, but declining U.S. sales and stalled share values are exerting a stronger force.

Ford said in January it was cancelling a planned Mexico plant and adding 700 jobs in Michigan.

Last month it announced plans to cut costs by $3 billion in 2017. Automakers are trimming expenditures as they brace for slowing auto sales.

General Motors Co (GM.N) has cut more than 4,000 U.S. jobs since November, and moved to conserve capital by shedding its European operations and closing unprofitable operations in Asia.

Ford's market capitalization has been surpassed by Tesla Inc , which has sold just a fraction of Ford vehicles.

Ford announced in 2015 it is investing $4.5 billion to add 13 new electric and hybrid vehicles by 2020 as it sought to position itself as a mobility company.

"You have to have one foot in today... but also one foot in the future," Chief Executive Officer Mark Fields told reporters last month. "I think investors understand our strategy."

Ford shares are down nearly 40 percent since Fields took the helm in July 2014.

Four automakers agree to $553 million settlement to resolve Takata claims - 路透新闻

{{20170518T164654.866+0000}}Four automakers agree to $553 million settlement to resolve Takata claimsWASHINGTON, May 18 (Reuters) - Four automakers agreed to a $553 million settlement to address class-action economic loss claims covering owners of nearly 16 million vehicles with potentially defective Takata airbag inflators, according to court documents filed on Thursday. Toyota Motor Corp's <7203.T> share of the settlement costs is $278.5 million, followed by BMW AG at $131 million, Mazda at $76 million and Subaru Corp <7270.T> at $68 million. Lawsuits against Honda Motor Co <7267.T>, Ford Motor Co and Nissan Motor Co <7201.T> have not been settled, lawyers said.

Takata Corp <7312.T> inflators, which can explode with excessive force and unleash metal shrapnel inside cars and trucks, are blamed for at least 16 deaths and more than 180 injuries worldwide. The safety defect has prompted recalls worldwide of about 100 million inflators by more than a dozen major automakers.

GM to stop selling cars in India but not pulling out - 路透新闻

{{20170518T073032.717+0000}}GM to stop selling cars in India but not pulling outBy Norihiko Shirouzu

BEIJING, May 18 (Reuters) - General Motors Co will stop selling cars in India from the end of this year, drawing a line under two decades of battling in one of the world's most competitive markets where it has less than a one percent share of passenger car sales.

The decision was announced as part of a series of restructuring actions from the Detroit automaker on Thursday, and marks a significant blow to India's strategy of encouraging domestic manufacturing. [nL2N1IJ11Q]

GM says it would no longer market its Chevrolet brand - its only brand of cars marketed in India - despite India's promise as a market set to overtake Japan as the world's third largest in the next decade.

But it doesn't plan to leave India entirely.

It plans to keep operating its tech center in Bangalore and to refocus its India manufacturing operations by making one of its two assembly plants in India – the one at Talegaon, about 100 km (62 miles) southeast of Mumbai – into an export-only factory. It plans to sell the Halol plant in the western Gujarat state to Chinese joint venture partner SAIC Motor Corp <600104.SS> .

"We are not giving up benefits India offers as a local cost manufacturing hub with an excellent supplier base which is extremely competitive," Stefan Jacoby, GM's chief of international operations, said in an interview.

GM's exports from India, mainly to Mexico and Latin America, nearly doubled to 70,969 vehicles in the fiscal year than ended on March 31. The Talegaon plant has a capacity of 130,000 vehicles a year.

Jacoby said the move to turn the Talegaon assembly into an export-only plant will not impact GM Korea and its position as an export hub. India will export vehicles mostly to Mexico and South America, among other destinations, while GM Korea will ship Korean-made cars to North America, Southeast Asia, Australia and Pakistan.

Dan Ammann, GM's global president, said the restructuring actions for India announced on Thursday in essence cancels "most" of the plan GM unveiled in 2015 to invest $1 billion in India to deploy newly-designed vehicle architecture as part of a Global Emerging Market vehicle programme or GEM for short, and build a new line of low-cost vehicles in India.

The decisions to significantly scale down GM's operations in India are results of months of analysis over "where we are going to place our bets (globally) as a company," Ammann said in an interview.

LATEST BLOW

The move is the latest blow to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's "Make in India initiative," aimed at making the country a global manufacturing powerhouse.

Last year, Ford Motor Co shelved plans to produce a new compact car family designed mainly for emerging markets. India and China had been slated to be the main manufacturing hubs for the new range that was set to begin production in 2018. [nL8N1BH1K5]

The auto sector is a major employment generator accounting for about 29 million direct and indirect jobs in India. Moreover, the $93 billion industry contributes 7.1 percent to the nation's gross domestic product and almost 50 percent of India's manufacturing output.

Ammann said GM looked at many options but determined that the investment originally planned for India would not deliver the kind of return other global opportunities offered.

GM plans to continue to work on the $5 billion GEM programme, which GM is developing with SAIC Motor. Ammann said the programme remains on track, even without India now, to account for about 2 million vehicles a year in global sales volume, mainly in Latin America, Mexico and China.

Despite being an early entrant, GM has struggled to boost its sales and market share in India in part because it has failed to launch low-cost yet feature-rich vehicles that Indian buyers prefer, according to analysts. Many of them also blame the high cost of maintaining and servicing Chevy cars for deterring cost-conscious buyers in India.

GM said in 2015 it aimed to double its India market share to around 3 percent or more by 2020. But its market share fell to below 1 percent in the year ended March 31 from 1.17 percent the previous year - even as India's market grew 9 percent to climb above the 3 million vehicle level. GM's volume in India fell by a fifth to 25,823 vehicles in the year ended March 31.

The GEM vehicle architecture, which is being engineered as an emerging-market platform technology for markets such as China, Brazil, Mexico and India, was envisioned to help GM come up with more cost-competitive cars. But for India, GEM was still too pricey a technology since it has been designed under GM's global vehicle safety, performance and other standards.

To be successful in India, Jacoby said one option for GM was to "give up on implementing global platform and vehicle standards". The other was to team up with a local partner to run full operations as an automaker designing products and manufacturing and marketing products locally.

"We have made the decision that these two options are not for us," Jacoby said.

GM will cut operations in India, South Africa - 路透新闻

{{20170518T073004.846+0000}}GM will cut operations in India, South AfricaBy Joseph White

DETROIT, May 18 (Reuters) - General Motors Co plans to quit selling vehicles in India by the end of this year and will sell operations in South Africa, the latest steps in a strategy of focusing cash and engineering effort on fewer, more profitable markets.

The Detroit automaker said on Thursday it will take a $500 million charge in the second quarter to restructure operations in India, Africa and Singapore. It will cancel most of a planned $1 billion investment to build a new line of low-cost vehicles in India.

About $200 million of the charge will be a cash expense, GM said. The moves are expected to save $100 million a year in a sector of GM's global business that last year lost about $800 million, the company said.

GM President Dan Ammann told Reuters in an interview that the latest restructuring moves - and a series of earlier decisions to quit unprofitable markets - allow GM to focus more money, engineering effort and senior management time on expanding where the company is strong, including China and the North American pickup and SUV business, where GM has a "product onslaught coming."

GM also has said it is investing about $600 million a year in efforts to develop autonomous vehicles and transportation services.

"What are we spending our time doing?" Ammann said. "Are we spending time pursuing opportunities … or all of our time fixing problems?"

GM, like its Detroit rival Ford Motor Co, has found it increasingly expensive to compete in emerging markets outside of China. GM sold just 49,000 vehicles in India and South Africa combined last year.

Chief Executive Mary Barra traveled to New Delhi in 2015 to announce a plan to invest $1 billion there to build a new line of Chevrolet models developed as part of a Global Emerging Market vehicle program - GEM for short. Since then, auto sales overall in India have slumped, and GM has failed to gain traction against incumbents such as Maruti Suzuki India Ltd.

Now, GM plans to stop selling Chevrolet brand vehicles by the end of the year and will produce vehicles only for export at its remaining factory in Talegaon. The company currently employs about 2,500 workers there.

GM said it would continue work at its design and engineering center near Bangalore.

PULLING BACK IN SOUTH AFRICA

The $5 billion GEM program, which GM is developing with its Chinese partner Shanghai Automotive Industries Corp, remains on track to account for about 2 million vehicles a year in global sales volume, mainly in Latin America, Mexico and China, Ammann said.

"The market opportunity for GEM has continued to grow," he said.

In a separate move, GM plans to stop building Chevrolet vehicles in South Africa and sell its South African factory to Japan's Isuzu Motors Ltd <7202.T>, along with the 30 percent stake the U.S. automaker owns in a truck venture with Isuzu Motors <7202.T>. Isuzu agreed in February to buy out GM's 57.7 percent stake in a joint venture in Kenya.

GM also will cut an undisclosed number of staff at its GM International Operations headquarters in Singapore. About 200 people work in that operation, the company said.

Since Barra took over GM in 2014, the one-time largest automaker in the world has taken aggressive steps to narrow its focus to China, the highly-profitable North American light truck and sport utility market, Latin America, vehicle financing and transportation services that ultimately could use autonomous vehicles. [nL2N1GJ0H3]

Despite the restructuring moves, including Barra's decision in March to sell loss-making European operations to French rival Peugeot SA , GM's share price has been stuck in a range close around $33 where it went public in 2010 following a government-funded bankruptcy. GM shares closed on Wednesday at $32.42.

Barra and GM's directors are under pressure from David Einhorn's Greenlight Capital, which wants GM to split its common stock into two classes, one that pays dividends and a second that would be valued to reflect the company's potential growth. Greenlight also has put forward a slate of three new directors. GM's management and incumbent board have rejected Greenlight's proposals. [nL4N1I6482] The hedge fund holds 54.8 million GM shares, or about 3.5 percent of the total.

UPDATE 3-Ford to cut 1,400 white-collar jobs, shares tumble - 路透新闻

{{20170517T193737.369+0000}}UPDATE 3-Ford to cut 1,400 white-collar jobs, shares tumble(Adds more details on Ford plans)

By David Shepardson

NEW YORK, May 17 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co said on Wednesday it plans to cut 1,400 salaried jobs in North America and Asia through voluntary early retirement and other financial incentives as the No. 2 U.S. automaker looks to boost its sagging stock price.

Ford shares fell as much as 2.5 percent in heavy trading and were headed to their worst close since November 2012 as the broader markets tumbled over the political turmoil in Washington.

The buyout offers were a fraction of the 20,000 job cuts that some news outlets had reported Ford could announce this week.

Ford said the cuts would amount to about 10 percent of a group of 15,000 managers and other non-production workers and would reduce labor costs for that segment by 10 percent.

The company said a large group of salaried workers would not be covered by the planned cuts, including those in product development and in the Ford Credit unit. The cuts will not apply to Ford's Europe or South America units.

About two-thirds of the buyout offers are in North America and the rest in Asia. Ford does not plan to cut hourly workers or production.

The automaker will offer financial incentives, including generous early retirement offers, to encourage salaried employees to depart voluntarily by the end of September. Ford said it expects it will hit the targets through voluntary offers, spokesman Mike Moran said.

"Reducing costs and becoming as lean and efficient as possible also remain part of that work," Moran said.

The voluntary incentives offers will go to about 9,600 of 30,000 U.S. salaried workers, the company said.

In 2016, Ford cut hundreds of white-collar jobs in Europe, reducing costs by $200 million annually.

Ford continues to churn out strong profits, reporting a record $10.4 billion in pretax earnings in 2016, and expects to earn around $9 billion this year.

But investors are worried about slowing sales and an industry that could be dominated by autonomous vehicles and car sharing in the future.

The Detroit automakers have been under pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump to add jobs in the United States, but declining U.S. sales and stalled share values are exerting a stronger force.

Ford said in January it was cancelling a planned Mexico plant and adding 700 jobs in Michigan.

Last month it announced plans to cut costs by $3 billion in 2017. Automakers are trimming expenditures as they brace for slowing auto sales.

General Motors Co (GM.N) has cut more than 4,000 U.S. jobs since November, and moved to conserve capital by shedding its European operations and closing unprofitable operations in Asia.

Ford's market capitalization has been surpassed by Tesla Inc , which has sold just a fraction of Ford vehicles.

Ford announced in 2015 it is investing $4.5 billion to add 13 new electric and hybrid vehicles by 2020 as it sought to position itself as a mobility company.

"You have to have one foot in today... but also one foot in the future," Chief Executive Officer Mark Fields told reporters last month. "I think investors understand our strategy."

Ford shares are down nearly 40 percent since Fields took the helm in July 2014.

UPDATE 1-GM supplier relations improve in N. America, Nissan's slip -study - 路透新闻

{{20170515T134545.617+0000}}UPDATE 1-GM supplier relations improve in N. America, Nissan's slip -study(Adds Nissan statement on study results)

By Nick Carey

DETROIT, May 15 (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co <7201.T> has fallen behind its top North American competitors in the health of its working relationships with suppliers while General Motors Co jumped to third place in rankings released on Monday.

Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T> and Honda Motor Co <7267.T> maintained their longstanding first and second rankings in the study which looked at the six biggest automakers in North America and is closely watched in the industry.

GM's leap knocked Detroit cross-town rival Ford Motor Co into fourth place and Nissan's fall from fifth to sixth place meant Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCA) avoided coming last as it had done since 2008, despite a lower index score than in 2016.

Automakers' profitability is directly linked to good working relations with their suppliers, said study author John Henke, head of Planning Perspectives Inc, a firm that focuses on company-supplier relations.

Nissan said in a statement that the study does "not reflect our experience of the technical and commercial relationships that we have with our suppliers, who have made significant contributions to Nissan's growth in North America."

Since the study began in 2002, Toyota has been first and Honda second on the study's OEM-Supplier Working Relations Index except for two years when the two Japanese automakers swapped the two top spots.

The study shows the results of surveys of 652 salespeople at 108 first-tier suppliers to the six automakers.

GM's rise to third place and its implications for profitability are good news for the No. 1 U.S. automaker and its chief executive Mary Barra as it wages a proxy battle with Greenlight Capital. The hedge fund has proposed splitting GM stock into two classes: one that pays dividends and one that does not. [nL4N1I6482]

The automaker has rejected the idea and rating agencies have said it would negatively affect GM's credit rating.

The index shows that under Barra - who took over the helm at the automaker in 2014 - GM has gone from joint last with FCA in 2015 to third place.

"If you look at the direction GM is taking, this has all happened since Mary Barra took over," Henke said. "She is changing the company."

Henke said Nissan's drop to the bottom reflected an aggressive push by the Japanese automaker to cut costs. But he said the survey results showed GM was making a similar push.

GM showed improvement across all areas included in the survey, including helpfulness and providing "profit opportunity" to suppliers. Nissan posted declines in virtually every area.

"GM is putting more pressure on their suppliers to reduce prices and improve quality than Nissan is," he said. "The question is not whether you pressure suppliers but how you do it and GM is doing it the right way."

UK says Brexit talks with Bentley Motors must remain confidential  - 路透新闻

{{20170515T125144.597+0000}}UK says Brexit talks with Bentley Motors must remain confidential By Costas Pitas

LONDON, May 15 (Reuters) - Britain has declined to release details of talks held last year with luxury carmaker Bentley Motors about a new investment decision ahead of Brexit, telling Reuters any disclosure could harm its ability to get a good deal with the European Union.

The Volkswagen-owned firm, which built over 11,000 luxury vehicles at its central English plant last year, is due to make a decision connected to the production of future models at the start of 2018. [nL5N1GM1G8]

In December a meeting was held between the firm and junior Brexit minister David Jones, according to a log posted on the government's website, but in response to a freedom of information request from Reuters the department said it was not in the public interest to release any of the correspondence.

"Part of the negotiation and exit process requires the UK to be able to effectively pursue and protect our interests abroad. Prematurely publicising information will prejudice our ability to successfully conduct that business," it said.

The Department for Exiting the European Union said that releasing any commercially sensitive information could make firms reluctant to speak to government in future.

"The potential lack of this key exchange of ideas, or the release of the information, may in turn weaken the government's position in these negotiations and make it harder for the UK to secure the best possible deal with the EU."

Bentley declined to comment on Monday. Reuters intends to seek a review of the government's decision.

Britain's largely foreign-owned car industry is worried Brexit could add tariffs to imports and exports, make it harder to move staff between sites and lead to border checks on the movement of components which would slow down production, risking the viability of their plants.

In March, Bentley's chief executive Wolfgang Duerheimer told Reuters he would be seeking guarantees from the government in the months ahead. [nL5N1GM1G8]

"You can get commitments and I count on commitments also from the UK government and, as I understood, they already gave commitments to other brands at certain times so when we come closer, we will see what we have in our hands," he said.

A Brexit deal with Japanese carmaker Nissan <7201.T> met with some political concern last year after the firm said it would build two new models at its English plant following a call for compensation in the event of tariffs.

An industry source said that the decision was secured with a government promise of extra support to counter any Brexit-induced loss of competitiveness. [nL8N1CX405]

Business minister Greg Clark declined to publish a copy of a letter sent to the carmaker, telling lawmakers in December they would only release it once commercial confidentialities no longer apply.

Clark's department took over four months to respond to a freedom of information request made by Reuters requesting correspondence between Nissan and the government. The standard response period is up to 20 working days.

However, it did eventually provide a number of partially redacted emails and letters including one document showing the firm discussed with Clark how to boost the uptake of electric cars. Several government initiatives have since been announced.

Last week Britain's biggest vehicle engine maker Ford , which runs two plants, said that a transitional deal with the European Union was crucial to determining its future in Britain, and suggested it would also be asking for government help.

"We are spending a lot of time thinking and talking about how we need to change our operations and what support we need from the government and other entities, not only in the UK, to make sure (trade) friction doesn't get created," Ford of Europe's chief executive Jim Farley said. [nL8N1IC4IK]

BREAKINGVIEWS-Ford shareholders in confused tizzy over strategy - 路透新闻

{{20170512T180453.770+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-Ford shareholders in confused tizzy over strategy(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.)

By Antony Currie

NEW YORK, May 12 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Ford Motor shareholders are in a confused tizzy over the company's strategy. There are good reasons to question executives about their plans - not least the stock's 37 percent drop since Mark Fields took over as boss almost three years ago. Railing against the Ford family's supervoting stock, as many did at Thursday's annual meeting, feels good but won't fix the automaker's immediate issues.

More than 35 percent of shareholders supported scrapping the dual-class share structure that gifts the descendants of Henry Ford two-fifths of the vote with less than 2 percent of outstanding stock. That's one of the highest percentages in over a decade of the resolution being on the proxy. Stripping out the family's votes, at least 58.5 percent of investors favor moving to one share, one vote.

That's a basic tenet of democratic shareholder capitalism, and Ford's owners deserve plaudits for taking a stand. But the automaker's history suggests a little nuance is in order. It was arguably the family's longstanding role – and voting power - that allowed then-Chief Executive Bill Ford to take drastic steps before the financial crisis to safeguard the company. He mortgaged Ford's assets to raise $23 billion. And he recruited as his successor Alan Mulally, to whom the family gave free rein to take whatever steps necessary to keep Ford afloat. Between them, they succeeded.

Targeting B shares doesn't deal with concerns about the share price, capital allocation or investments in electric and autonomous vehicles – topics raised at Thursday's meeting. A better way to register disapproval would be to vote against executive pay. Yet that received a 96.5 percent "yes" vote – or 94.25 percent, after eliminating the family bloc.

In any event, the beef about Ford's plummeting market value misses a key point: Ford's stock had raced ahead of General Motors and Fiat Chrysler as the company was further along in its turnaround plan. Its local rivals have been catching up since then, but at around 5.5 times next year's estimated earnings both still trade at a discount to Ford's 6.7 times multiple.

With U.S. car sales starting to slow, that suggests Ford is better prepared for a downturn – or an autonomous future – than its Detroit competitors.

CONTEXT NEWS

- Some 35.5 percent of Ford shareholders voted to scrap the car company's supervoting stock, the highest percentage in over a decade of the resolution being in the annual proxy.

- B shares give the Ford family 40 percent of the vote even though the structure gives it an economic interest of just 1.78 percent. After stripping out their stake, 58.5 percent of shareholders would have voted to get rid of the dual-class shares, had all of them cast a vote.

- A vote on compensation for the top five named executives received approval from 95.5 percent of shareholders – or 94.25 percent after stripping out the family bloc vote.

FN officials urge France's Le Pen to solve euro dilemma - 路透新闻

{{20170512T174418.043+0000}}FN officials urge France's Le Pen to solve euro dilemmaBy Ingrid Melander and Simon Carraud

PARIS, May 12 (Reuters) - Marine Le Pen must quickly resolve her far-right party's stance on the euro, top officials in France's National Front said on Friday, as a row over the issue heated up following her presidential election defeat to centrist Emmanuel Macron.

In a party where dissent is rarely expressed publicly, officials and allies have become uncharacteristically vocal since Le Pen's May 7 defeat to Macron on whether to abandon plans to ditch the euro, which some blame for the loss.

"It is clear that Marine will have to decide very quickly," Jean-Richard Sulzer, one of Le Pen's economic advisers, told Reuters. "This cannot wait for the congress," he said, referring to a crucial party meeting scheduled for end 2017 or early 2018.

The party's position on the euro may be a factor in parliamentary elections due in June, although the issue is unlikely to be resolved by then.

Gilbert Collard, one of only four National Front (FN) lawmakers, has said the party must scrap its plans to ditch the currency, while Le Pen's deputy Florian Philippot, who has had a major influence on her policy, said he would quit if that happened. [nL8N1ID5FC]

"In this very centralised, very autocratic party, we find ourselves at the moment where the pressure cooker is about to explode because there has been too tight a lid on internal dissent for too long," said Nice university researcher Gilles Ivaldi, a specialist of the FN.

Some top FN officials privately acknowledge that the anti-euro policy, which Le Pen tried to soften in the last days of the campaign, likely played a key role in her bigger-than-expected defeat.

But they disagree on whether that was because the plan was watered down, with a longer timetable and plans to keep some form of monetary cooperation, or because it was too radical.

"Everybody knows the euro is dead," said Bernard Monot, an FN economist who is also EU lawmaker and was part of Le Pen's campaign committee. "But there have been too many shortcuts on communication and people thought we wanted a brutal, radical euro exit. This scares people," he told Reuters, adding that the FN must "draw the necessary conclusions from this."

"LOSE OUR SOUL"?

At stake for the FN, after it gathered more votes than ever in the presidential election but nevertheless did less well than it hoped, is whether it can become France's main opposition party, as it has billed itself.

Referring to the mid-June election of lower house of parliament representatives, which will be key both to Macron's capacity to enact his reforms and to the future of the FN, Monot said: "The parliamentary elections will take place first, and then we will meet to discuss this (the euro policy)."

While a large majority of FN supporters back ditching the euro, opinion polls indicate three-quarters of French voters want to keep Europe's single currency.

"We must work on making ourselves better understood on this," said Jean Messiha, who was in charge of coordinating Le Pen's presidential election manifesto and is a candidate in the June ballot.

Unlike Collard but like Philippot, Messiha insists the party must stick to its trademark policy of a return to a national currency. "Otherwise we would lose our soul," he told Reuters, criticising what he called "pressure from the politico-mediatic establishment to abandon some of the crucial points of our program."

With the question of the euro and of who is to blame for Le Pen's defeat also simmering on pro-FN websites, some grassroots activists worried about the divisions.

"We must all be in it together," said Aymeric Durox, 31, a history teacher in Fontainebleau near Paris and a candidate there in the parliamentary elections. As far as he's concerned, the FN "should not completely give up on its euro policy."

RPT-ANALYSIS-U.S. used-car glut is a dealer's dream, automakers' nightmare - 路透新闻

{{20170512T110001.748+0000}}RPT-ANALYSIS-U.S. used-car glut is a dealer's dream, automakers' nightmare(Repeats for additional clients with no changes to text)

By Nick Carey

ORWELL, Ohio, May 12 (Reuters) - Three years ago if a customer walked onto Dan Reel's used car lot seeking a late-model off-lease Ford Escape, his answer was short: tough luck.

The supply of lightly-used cars and trucks was tight because automakers had drastically cut back on bargain leases during and after the Great Recession.

Recently, though, a computer search for available used vehicles within 150 miles of Reel revealed an eye-popping figure: 668 Escapes. That's enough to put more than 40 percent of the inhabitants of this small northeastern Ohio town, population 1,600, into the popular crossover.

A search for the Chevrolet Equinox, a comparable crossover, showed 461 available.

"The automakers have flooded the market," said Reel, owner of Reel's Auto in Orwell, Ohio, about 40 miles east of Cleveland.

That deluge is good news for used-car dealers, auto auction houses and car buyers, who stand to benefit from a bountiful supply of high quality, off-lease vehicles rolling into the U.S. market.

By the end of 2019, an estimated 12 million low-mileage vehicles are coming off leases inked during a 2014-2016 spurt in new auto sales, according to estimates by Atlanta-based auto auction firm Manheim and Reuters.

That's helping independent dealers such as Reel, who can turn a quick profit on vehicles bought cheaply from auction companies.

Big players like AutoNation also aim to benefit from selling late-model vehicles at a discount versus brand new cars.

Chief Executive Mike Jackson said rising off-lease car numbers means "a higher supply of pre-owned vehicles at a more attractive price."

Consumers seeking great deals are in luck. Used-vehicle prices at auction fell about 3 percent last year, according to Carmel, Indiana-based KAR Auction Services Inc , which facilitated the sale of 5.1 million used and salvaged vehicles in 2016. Used prices should drop around 3 percent annually for the next couple of years, according to KAR's chief economist Tom Kontos.

General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co say prices for its used vehicles, which consist largely of nearly-new ones coming off lease to consumers, fell 7 percent in the first quarter versus the same period in 2016. GM says it expects a 7 percent decline for 2017 compared to last year.

DETROIT THREE NOT CELEBRATING

While many used-car dealers and their customers are spoiled for choice, the glut bodes ill for GM, Ford and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV and is one reason the Detroit Three's share prices are stuck in neutral.

Demand for new vehicles is slowing after seven consecutive years of rising sales.[nL1N1I40OF] Meanwhile, carmakers' discounts on new vehicles have surpassed record levels set during the Great Recession. Those discounts have been averaging over 10 percent of a new vehicle's average selling price, according to industry consultants J.D. Power and LMC Automotive.

Slumping prices also hurt automakers' in-house lenders. They price leases using a car's "residual value" - an estimate of the vehicle's worth after its lease ends. If that value is lower than expected when the vehicle is resold, profits suffer.

That risk was highlighted last November when Ford lowered its financial service arm's pretax profit forecast by $300 million, citing falling resale values for off-lease vehicles. [nL1N1DI1K5]

Still, carmakers show no sign of abandoning leasing. In the first quarter, leases made up 31.06 percent of sales to consumers, just below the record set in the second quarter of 2016 of 31.44 percent, according to data from Experian.

For a graphic showing leasing activity, see: [http://tmsnrt.rs/2pe1E2x ]

Wall Street is worried carmakers are repeating past mistakes. Shares of GM and Ford barely budged last month after their earnings both beat analyst expectations. [nL1NI00IG]But when the companies reported disappointing April sales last week, GM's shares fell 3 percent and Ford's 4 percent. [nL1N1I40OF]

Automakers contend there is little cause for alarm.

In late April, GM chief financial officer Chuck Stevens said off-lease vehicles were "an issue," but insisted that "overall the used-car market is absorbing that supply."

Others see it differently.

KAR CEO Jim Hallett said there's now an oversupply of off-lease vehicles.

"The flood of lease cars puts a lot of pressure on automakers and their dealers to get new cars sold," he said.

COOKIE CUTTER VS. UNICORN

In a market teeming with product, attention is now on auction sites, a critical link in the used-car food chain. The U.S. trade is dominated by Manheim and Adesa, a unit of KAR. These companies re-sell cars and trucks returned to automakers from rental car companies and consumer leases.

Franchise dealerships get first dibs on inventory. The leftovers are available to independent dealers through online and live auctions.

KAR's Hallett says the company makes money on the volume of cars sold, so rising supply boosts business. Manufacturers are also using more of KAR's ancillary repair and finishing services to make vehicles look as good as possible for sale, he said.

Supply is currently so swollen Adesa now offers used dealers a guarantee: they can return any car they buy online within 30 days if it doesn't sell and only end up $50 out of pocket.

Used-car dealers are also tweaking their strategies for a glutted market. Reel, the Ohio dealer, hunts for unique vehicles that can command a slight premium.

Joe Mok, general manager of Gmotorcars in Chicago, doesn't care about unicorns. His strategy is to sell cheap. He recently bought 15 virtually identical 2015 Ford Fiestas for $6,900 and sold them for $7,600.

"What's going to make somebody come to my store if we all have the same color Toyota Camry with the same miles?" said Mok, who owns two dealerships. "They'll come to me because of the price."

With used-car prices falling, the pressure is on dealers to sell vehicles fast before they lose value.

Rather than keep too much inventory on his lot, Reel entices customers with the prospect of almost unlimited choice on the auction sites.

"I can get almost any off-lease car a customer wants within 48 hours," he said. "The only question is: 'What color do you want?'"

ANALYSIS-U.S. used-car glut is a dealer's dream, automakers' nightmare - 路透新闻

{{20170512T050007.109+0000}}ANALYSIS-U.S. used-car glut is a dealer's dream, automakers' nightmareBy Nick Carey

ORWELL, Ohio, May 12 (Reuters) - Three years ago if a customer walked onto Dan Reel's used car lot seeking a late-model off-lease Ford Escape, his answer was short: tough luck.

The supply of lightly-used cars and trucks was tight because automakers had drastically cut back on bargain leases during and after the Great Recession.

Recently, though, a computer search for available used vehicles within 150 miles of Reel revealed an eye-popping figure: 668 Escapes. That's enough to put more than 40 percent of the inhabitants of this small northeastern Ohio town, population 1,600, into the popular crossover.

A search for the Chevrolet Equinox, a comparable crossover, showed 461 available.

"The automakers have flooded the market," said Reel, owner of Reel's Auto in Orwell, Ohio, about 40 miles east of Cleveland.

That deluge is good news for used-car dealers, auto auction houses and car buyers, who stand to benefit from a bountiful supply of high quality, off-lease vehicles rolling into the U.S. market.

By the end of 2019, an estimated 12 million low-mileage vehicles are coming off leases inked during a 2014-2016 spurt in new auto sales, according to estimates by Atlanta-based auto auction firm Manheim and Reuters.

That's helping independent dealers such as Reel, who can turn a quick profit on vehicles bought cheaply from auction companies.

Big players like AutoNation also aim to benefit from selling late-model vehicles at a discount versus brand new cars.

Chief Executive Mike Jackson said rising off-lease car numbers means "a higher supply of pre-owned vehicles at a more attractive price."

Consumers seeking great deals are in luck. Used-vehicle prices at auction fell about 3 percent last year, according to Carmel, Indiana-based KAR Auction Services Inc , which facilitated the sale of 5.1 million used and salvaged vehicles in 2016. Used prices should drop around 3 percent annually for the next couple of years, according to KAR's chief economist Tom Kontos.

General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co say prices for its used vehicles, which consist largely of nearly-new ones coming off lease to consumers, fell 7 percent in the first quarter versus the same period in 2016. GM says it expects a 7 percent decline for 2017 compared to last year.

DETROIT THREE NOT CELEBRATING

While many used-car dealers and their customers are spoiled for choice, the glut bodes ill for GM, Ford and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV and is one reason the Detroit Three's share prices are stuck in neutral.

Demand for new vehicles is slowing after seven consecutive years of rising sales.[nL1N1I40OF] Meanwhile, carmakers' discounts on new vehicles have surpassed record levels set during the Great Recession. Those discounts have been averaging over 10 percent of a new vehicle's average selling price, according to industry consultants J.D. Power and LMC Automotive.

Slumping prices also hurt automakers' in-house lenders. They price leases using a car's "residual value" - an estimate of the vehicle's worth after its lease ends. If that value is lower than expected when the vehicle is resold, profits suffer.

That risk was highlighted last November when Ford lowered its financial service arm's pretax profit forecast by $300 million, citing falling resale values for off-lease vehicles. [nL1N1DI1K5]

Still, carmakers show no sign of abandoning leasing. In the first quarter, leases made up 31.06 percent of sales to consumers, just below the record set in the second quarter of 2016 of 31.44 percent, according to data from Experian.

For a graphic showing leasing activity, see: [http://tmsnrt.rs/2pe1E2x ]

Wall Street is worried carmakers are repeating past mistakes. Shares of GM and Ford barely budged last month after their earnings both beat analyst expectations. [nL1NI00IG]But when the companies reported disappointing April sales last week, GM's shares fell 3 percent and Ford's 4 percent. [nL1N1I40OF]

Automakers contend there is little cause for alarm.

In late April, GM chief financial officer Chuck Stevens said off-lease vehicles were "an issue," but insisted that "overall the used-car market is absorbing that supply."

Others see it differently.

KAR CEO Jim Hallett said there's now an oversupply of off-lease vehicles.

"The flood of lease cars puts a lot of pressure on automakers and their dealers to get new cars sold," he said.

COOKIE CUTTER VS. UNICORN

In a market teeming with product, attention is now on auction sites, a critical link in the used-car food chain. The U.S. trade is dominated by Manheim and Adesa, a unit of KAR. These companies re-sell cars and trucks returned to automakers from rental car companies and consumer leases.

Franchise dealerships get first dibs on inventory. The leftovers are available to independent dealers through online and live auctions.

KAR's Hallett says the company makes money on the volume of cars sold, so rising supply boosts business. Manufacturers are also using more of KAR's ancillary repair and finishing services to make vehicles look as good as possible for sale, he said.

Supply is currently so swollen Adesa now offers used dealers a guarantee: they can return any car they buy online within 30 days if it doesn't sell and only end up $50 out of pocket.

Used-car dealers are also tweaking their strategies for a glutted market. Reel, the Ohio dealer, hunts for unique vehicles that can command a slight premium.

Joe Mok, general manager of Gmotorcars in Chicago, doesn't care about unicorns. His strategy is to sell cheap. He recently bought 15 virtually identical 2015 Ford Fiestas for $6,900 and sold them for $7,600.

"What's going to make somebody come to my store if we all have the same color Toyota Camry with the same miles?" said Mok, who owns two dealerships. "They'll come to me because of the price."

With used-car prices falling, the pressure is on dealers to sell vehicles fast before they lose value.

Rather than keep too much inventory on his lot, Reel entices customers with the prospect of almost unlimited choice on the auction sites.

"I can get almost any off-lease car a customer wants within 48 hours," he said. "The only question is: 'What color do you want?'"

UPDATE 1-Ford tells UK: We also need Brexit deals with Turkey, S. Africa - 路透新闻

{{20170510T124433.928+0000}}UPDATE 1-Ford tells UK: We also need Brexit deals with Turkey, S. Africa(Adds details, background, quote)

By Costas Pitas

LONDON, May 10 (Reuters) - Britain needs to strike post-Brexit trade deals with countries such as Turkey and South Africa as well as the European Union, Ford said on Wednesday, underlining the scale of the challenge facing Prime Minister Theresa May to meet business demands.

Ford , Britain's biggest automotive engine-maker, operates two manufacturing sites in the country and like other companies has warned that any trade restrictions after it leaves the EU could add to costs and endanger British production.

The U.S. carmaker denies union claims it is planning to axe 1,100 jobs at its engine plant in Wales by the end of the decade after scaling back an investment there. [nL5N1GE6I0]

Ford sends UK-built engines to Turkey, where it assembles its range of Transit vans and then exports many completed vehicles to Britain, benefiting from the barrier-free trade guaranteed by the EU's customs deal with Turkey.

All of Ford's Ranger pick-up trucks sold in Britain, meanwhile, are made in South Africa, reflecting the interconnected supply and sales chain made easy by EU trade deals with other countries, which Britain will now need to renegotiate as it leaves the bloc.

"For Ford, it's not only important for the UK's agreement with the 27 (remaining EU) countries but equally important are countries like Turkey and South Africa which hasn't really been talked about," Ford of Europe CEO Jim Farley told a London conference.

The company's British-built engines face tariffs of up to 2.7 percent, while vehicle imports could be hit by tariffs of up to 10 percent if Britain has to fall back on World Trade Organization trading rules.

Farley suggested it would be hard for politicians to complete a full Brexit deal between now and March 2019, the end of a two-year period set out in EU legislation, and there needed to be time to adjust to the new terms.

"There should be a transition period. That transition period is really critical for the future of our investments in the UK," he said.

May, who polls show is likely to win a landslide victory in a national election on June 8, has singled out the resurgent car industry as a key sector she wishes to back, striking a deal with Japan's Nissan <7201.T> last year to expand output at its northeast England plant. [nL8N1CX405]

The government promised Nissan extra support to counter any Brexit-induced loss of competitiveness, according to a source, and the firm discussed with Britain's business minister how to boost the uptake of electric cars, according to documents seen by Reuters, with initiatives later announced.

Ford suggested it could also seek government support to maintain the benefits of tariff-free trade. [nL5N1GE6I0]

"We are spending a lot of time thinking and talking about how we need to change our operations and what support we need from the government and other entities not only in the UK to make sure (trade) friction doesn't get created," Farley said.

UK needs post Brexit deals with Turkey, South Africa, not just EU-Ford - 路透新闻

{{20170510T090511.914+0000}}UK needs post Brexit deals with Turkey, South Africa, not just EU-FordLONDON, May 10 (Reuters) - Britain needs to strike a trade deal with Turkey and South Africa as well as with the remainder of the European Union when the country leaves the bloc, Ford's Europe chief said on Wednesday.

"For Ford, it's not only important for the UK's agreement with the 27 countries but equally important are countries like Turkey and South Africa which hasn't really been talked about," Ford of Europe CEO Jim Farley told a London conference.

U.S carmaker Ford, which is Britain's biggest automotive engine builder, makes vans in Turkey, which is not part of the EU but is in the EU customs union.

Farley also said it was looking at how to maintain the free movement of goods and people which could be inhibited under a hard Brexit deal involving tariffs.

"We are spending a lot of time thinking and talking about how we need to change our operations and what support we need from the government and other entities not only in the UK to make sure friction doesn't get created," he said.

UPDATE 2-UK proposes clean-air zones, scrappage scheme for polluting cars - 路透新闻

{{20170505T131056.993+0000}}UPDATE 2-UK proposes clean-air zones, scrappage scheme for polluting cars* Government had wanted to delay plan until after election

* Court ordered it to release the proposals sooner

* Consultation runs to June 15, results seen around July 31

(Adds criticism from Labour, Friends of the Earth)

By Costas Pitas

LONDON, May 5 (Reuters) - Britain said on Friday it could introduce a scrappage scheme to get the most polluting cars and vans off its roads and charge some drivers of old vehicles to enter parts of the country, as it strives to improve air quality.

The government had sought to delay publication of its plan until after the June 8 election, but a court ordered it to release proposals to comply with European Union legislation on nitrogen dioxide limits. [nL8N1D32VY]

Media had reported ministers were considering a scrappage scheme that would give motorists up to 2,000 pounds ($2,600) to trade in gas-guzzling models, but in Friday's consultation document, officials set a number of conditions for such a plan.

"Any scheme would need to provide value for money, target support where it was most needed, be deliverable at local authority level and minimise the scope for fraud," the environment ministry said in a document released on Friday.

The consultation is due to close on June 15, with results not expected until July 31.

The proposed measures will likely accelerate the decline of diesel cars in Europe's second biggest market, blamed for poor air quality in the wake of Volkswagen's emissions test cheating scandal.

Demand for diesel cars fell 27 percent in April, compared with a 13 percent drop for petrol, according to industry data.

The government also suggested it would quickly implement clean air zones in parts of the country, where motorists of the most polluting vehicles would have to pay to enter a particular area.

"We expect that implementation ... will take up to three years, but government will ensure the plans achieve compliance within the shortest time possible," the ministry said.

But environmental pressure group Friends of the Earth and the main opposition Labour party criticised the government for not going far enough with its proposals and being slow to act.

"They are toothless and wholly inadequate," said London Mayor Sadiq Khan, a Labour politician who last month brought forward plans to charge the most polluting cars and vans a daily fee to enter central London. [nL5N1HC1HL]

"They go nowhere near where we need to to address the public health emergency we are facing," he told Sky News.

UK mulls clean-air zones, scrappage scheme for polluting vehicles  - 路透新闻

{{20170505T113410.816+0000}}UK mulls clean-air zones, scrappage scheme for polluting vehicles LONDON, May 5 (Reuters) - Britain said on Friday it will consult on a new scrappage scheme for the most polluting cars and vans and could introduce clean air zones which some drivers of old vehicles would have to pay to enter.

The environment ministry's proposals are in response to a High Court ruling which said existing measures to tackle pollution do not comply with European Union legislation to improve air quality and meet nitrogen dioxide limits. [nL8N1D32VY]

Media had speculated that the government would announce a scrappage scheme, under which motorists would receive around 2,000 pounds ($2,600) to trade in their older model for a more energy-efficient one, but officials set a number of conditions for such a plan to work.

"Any scheme would need to provide value for money, target support where it was most needed, be deliverable at local authority level and minimise the scope for fraud," the environment ministry said in a document released on Friday.

The consultation is due to close on June 15 with results not expected until July 31 after Britons vote in a national election next month.

UPDATE 1-UK car sales tumble 20 pct in April after bumper March - 路透新闻

{{20170504T083656.660+0000}}UPDATE 1-UK car sales tumble 20 pct in April after bumper March(Adds details, quotes)

By Costas Pitas

LONDON, May 4 (Reuters) - British new car registrations slumped by 20 percent in April, the biggest year-on-year drop for over six years after record demand in March, when customers brought forward purchases to avoid a tax increase, an industry body said on Thursday.

Sales fell 19.8 percent to 152,076 vehicles last month, traditionally a period when fewer vehicles are sold after a new licence plate series is issued in March, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said.

Demand in March was at a record high as individuals and businesses in Europe's second biggest autos market sought to avoid paying an increase in excise duty that came into force from April 1 for the most polluting vehicles.

Registrations so far this year are up 1.1 percent, despite forecasts that demand would fall by at least 5 percent this year due to the uncertainties around Brexit and after consecutive record performances.

Following an 8.4 percent rise in March and a slump in April, also hit by fewer selling days due to Easter, the SMMT said it foresaw less erratic swings in the months ahead.

"We ... expect demand to stabilise over the year as the turbulence created by these tax changes decreases," SMMT Chief Executive Mike Hawes said.

But the industry faces a number of challenges ahead including new levies and tighter rules on the most polluting vehicles, which appear to be already dampening demand for diesel vehicles. [nL5N1HC1HL]

Demand for diesel fell 27 percent last month, which compared with a fall of 13 percent for gasoline-powered vehicles, as the government prepares plans to tackle air pollution which could be announced as soon as Friday.

Britain's Financial Conduct Authority also said last month it would be launching a review into finance packages offered to customers buying cars due to concerns that there might be "irresponsible lending in the motor finance industry."

Cheap finance has been key to the success of the sector in recent years with up to 90 percent of cars sold using personal contract plans, whereby customers effectively rent a new car for two to three years by making monthly payments before often trading in for a new model.

UPDATE 3-Tesla plugs older Model S as new buyers turn to Model 3  - 路透新闻

{{20170503T235229.869+0000}}UPDATE 3-Tesla plugs older Model S as new buyers turn to Model 3 (Adds Musk quotes, details on service centers)

By Alexandria Sage

SAN FRANCISCO, May 3 (Reuters) - Electric-car maker Tesla Inc on Wednesday reported first-quarter revenue that more than doubled, and while saying the upcoming Model 3 was on schedule for July, it downplayed the mass-market vehicle to give a sales pitch for its more expensive Model S.

Chief Executive Elon Musk's bold approach to cars, space exploration and clean energy has fueled investor enthusiasm for Tesla. But skeptics are waiting to see if Musk can fulfill his promise of producing 500,000 cars per year in 2018, or six times Tesla's 2016 production.

Shares were down about 2 percent in after-hours trade following the results.

The automaker's comments underscored the additional challenge of keeping up demand for its older models.

"We have seen some impact of Model S orders as a function of people being confused" that Model 3 is the upgrade to Model S, Musk said on a conference call.

Tesla said it had $4 billion of cash on hand as it headed into the second quarter and expects year-to-date capital expenditures to be slightly over $2 billion by the time it starts Model 3 production - within its previous targeted range of $2 billion to $2.5 billion.

That cushion should give the company some near-term breathing room from needing to tap Wall Street for cash, said CFRA Research analyst Efraim Levy. Tesla in March raised $1.2 billion from the markets.

Record deliveries helped Tesla boost its revenue to $2.7 billion in the quarter, but a net loss net widened to $330.3 million from $282.3 million a year earlier, largely driven by its SolarCity acquisition.

Tesla has much riding on the Model 3, which could finally make the cash-hemorrhaging automaker profitable. But while much of the company hype has focused on the car due in July, Tesla on Wednesday made a sales pitch for its overshadowed Model S.

Tesla is anxious that the $35,000 Model 3 - which will likely not be delivered in volume until 2018 - avoids cannibalizing the higher-margin Model S, which lists at about double the starting price.

CHALLENGES AHEAD

In its earnings release, Tesla stated that a key challenge for the company would be to eliminate misperceptions about the differences between the Model S and the Model 3.

"We want to be super clear that Model 3 is not version three of our car. Model 3 is essentially a smaller, more affordable version of the Model S with fewer features," Musk said on a conference call, adding buyers erroneously thought the Model 3 would be more advanced.

"The Model S will be better than Model 3," he added. "As it should be, as it's a more expensive car."

Tesla needs to ramp up for a deluge of Model 3 customers, and the company said it would be adding nearly 100 retail, delivery and service locations worldwide, representing a 30 percent increase. Tesla also said it was also working to improve efficiency, citing vehicle repair times that have fallen by 35 percent due to the use of remote diagnostics.

The company reiterated its forecast of delivering 47,000-50,000 Model S and Model X cars in the first half of 2017, a target it announced earlier this year.

Still, customer deposits fell 7 percent in the quarter, which could suggest interest in Tesla's current product line, the Model S and Model X, is decreasing.

On a per-share basis, Tesla's net loss narrowed to $2.04 from $2.13.

Excluding items, the company lost $1.33 per share. Analysts on average had expected a loss of 81 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Tesla's results reflect the first full quarter that includes solar panel installer SolarCity, which it bought last year. [nL1N1DI2LO]

The Silicon Valley-based automaker last month became the most valuable U.S. carmaker by market capitalization, pulling ahead of Detroit's auto heavyweights Ford Motor Co and General Motors Co . [nL1N1HI1EI]

Up to Wednesday's close, shares of Tesla had risen 45.6 percent this year.

UPDATE 6-Investors cheer Delphi's bet on electric, connected cars - Reuters News

{{20170503T210728.931+0000}}UPDATE 6-Investors cheer Delphi's bet on electric, connected cars(Adds analyst comment, closing share price)

By Nick Carey and Edward Taylor

DETROIT, May 3 (Reuters) - Automotive supplier Delphi Automotive Plc on Wednesday said it plans to spin off operations tied to internal combustion engines and focus on technology for electrically powered and self-driving vehicles, boosting its share price and highlighting the challenges for legacy auto industry players.

Vehicles driven by humans and powered with petroleum will dominate roads from Shanghai to San Francisco for years to come, but investors who supply the capital to produce such vehicles are signaling a belief that after a century-long run, internal combustion cars are a sunset industry.

The most dramatic symbol of this turn is electric luxury car maker Tesla Inc's ascent this year to a higher market capitalization than either Ford Motor Co or General Motors Co . Despite a recent slump in U.S. sales, the Detroit giants are robustly profitable, while Tesla has yet to earn a full year profit. Tesla reports first-quarter results later Wednesday.

Delphi shares rose as much as 12 percent on Wednesday after the company announced its plan to separate into two entities - one dedicated to internal combustion technology and the other focused on electrification and automation. The shares closed at $87.01, up nearly 11 percent, representing about $2 billion in added market value.

"There's a whole element of the componentry of the car that Wall Street values at a lower level," Delphi Chief Executive Officer Kevin Clark told Reuters in an interview on Wednesday.

Other big auto suppliers are making similar calls. German auto supplier Robert Bosch GmbH [ROBG.UL] earlier this week said it had sold its starters and alternators business to a Chinese mining company. [nL4N1I42Y1]

Germany's Rheinmetall also tried to float its Kolbenschmidt Pierburg unit, which is specialized in the development, manufacture and aftermarket supply of pistons, engine blocks, and plain bearings back in 2012. However, it was forced to call off the IPO due to a market slump and a lack of investor enthusiasm for a stock with heavy exposure to combustion engine technology, bankers said.

Combustion engines are taking a hit from regulators, particularly those in Europe and China, who want to slash greenhouse gas and smog forming emissions on a fast timetable. That risk was exacerbated by Volkswagen's diesel emissions scandal. As a result of "Dieselgate," politicians in cities like Stuttgart have discussed banning diesel vehicles from the inner city, leading customers to abandon diesel cars.

On Wednesday, German car registration figures provided by Germany's KBA federal motor authority, showed that demand for diesel engine vehicles plunged by 19.3 percent in April, to a market share of 41.3 percent of overall registrations.[nL8N1I532M]

Delphi's Clark said he expects diesel production to decline by about 3 percent a year for the next few years.

China's government has also set aggressive targets for electric vehicles that are forcing carmakers to accelerate electric vehicle plans. [nL3N1GQ4AT]

POWERTRAIN OPERATIONS HAS ROOM TO GROW

U.S. auto supplier Visteon , like Delphi, has shed most of its traditional car parts making operations, and is focused on connected vehicle technology and infotainment.

Clark said Delphi's powertrain business, which has about $4.5 billion in annual revenues and does not yet have a name, has room to grow. The company will have more freedom to invest in that growth as its managers no longer have to compete for capital with opportunities presented by the increasing computerization of cars, Clark said.

The powertrain company, which accounted for about 27 percent of Delphi revenues last year, also could seize opportunities to consolidate other players in the legacy market, capitalizing on the continued demand for internal combustion and the regulatory pressure to make them cleaner, a person familiar with Delphi's strategy said.

Analysts on Wednesday estimated Delphi's powertrain business will be valued at six to seven times earnings before interest and taxes, while the electronic and autonomous technology side of the company will likely command a higher valuation.

The electronic Delphi - which also could get a new name - will compete in a potential market the company estimates at more than $100 billion a year, nearly twice the size of the internal combustion market. Delphi said its electronic systems units had about $12 billion in revenue last year.

Delphi "is best positioned to be the 'picks and shovels' supplier of big data solutions" to automakers, Barclays analyst Brian Johnson wrote in a note on Wednesday.

But the market of the future is still largely in the future. Most established car makers, for instance, have not adopted over the air software upgrades on a mass scale, and depend entirely on internal combustion engine cars and sport utilities for profits.

Clark said over the next three to five years demand will accelerate for high speed in-vehicle data networking systems, autonomous driving technology and over the air software updates. Delphi has acquired a company that enables over the air software updates, as well as a company that develops high speed data networks. Clark said Delphi could make more acquisitions to expand its electronic systems capability, or forge more partnerships.

Delphi has partnerships through its autonomous vehicle business with Intel Corp and Israeli autonomous vehicle technology firm Mobileye , which is being bought by Intel for $15.3 billion.

"If we can do more things like that" the Mobileye-Intel partnership, "that would be great," Clark said.

Delphi is betting that many automakers will ultimately opt to buy a standard system rather than invest in one-of-a-kind systems of their own. Delphi said it expects to launch its turnkey autonomous driving system with a customer in 2019.

The spinoff will be tax free and is expected to be completed by March 2018, Delphi said.

BREAKINGVIEWS-Delphi goes where carmakers only dream of driving - Reuters Breakingviews

{{20170503T170912.039+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-Delphi goes where carmakers only dream of driving(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.)

By Antony Currie

NEW YORK, May 3 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Delphi is going where carmakers can only dream of driving. The $23 billion parts maker is spinning off its powertrain unit to focus on connected and autonomous vehicle technology. These fast-growing, higher-margin businesses will sport a top-tier multiple even if car sales slow. The likes of Ford and General Motors don't have the luxury of following Delphi's lead.

Like other suppliers, Delphi Automotive already trades at a premium to its customers. Before announcing its breakup plan on Wednesday, the company, headquartered in Gillingham, England, commanded a multiple of 12 times this year's estimated earnings. Only Toyota <7203.T> of the major carmakers makes it into double digits, but still falls shy.

The lofty valuation is a consequence of running businesses with better margins. Ford and GM, for example, are hitting the ball out of the park if their pre-tax margin reaches 7 percent. Delphi's was 9.4 percent in the first quarter and may exceed 12.5 percent for the rest of the year, according to analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters.

The powertrain business is a relative laggard, though, which is why Delphi is spinning it off to shareholders. The unit's adjusted operating margin is 2 percentage points lower than the electronics divisions the parent is keeping. Those operations also have more scope to grow revenue and boost returns as they're in the most fast-paced part of the industry. That, of course, also means there's a lot of competition – from GM to Uber [UBER.UL], Alphabet and Apple .

In outlining the split on Wednesday, Delphi boss Kevin Clark played up the increased focus each of the two new management teams would have as separate companies more than the immediate benefit to shareholders. Even so, investors added nearly a tenth to Delphi's value, raising its multiple above 13 times earnings.

Virtually all carmakers have their own connected and autonomous driving units and investments. Some might even hold more value than Delphi's. Ford Chief Executive Mark Fields, for example, is targeting margins of 20 percent. Trouble is, they're too small a part of the overall business – and too integral to their hopes of transforming from carmakers into what Fields calls mobility companies – to stand on their own anytime soon. For now, that leaves Delphi's customers only watching as it speeds off.

CONTEXT NEWS

- Delphi Automotive on May 3 said it is planning to spin off its powertrain business. The move will leave the parent company with two businesses focused on advanced connectivity, autonomy and mobility: electrical/electronic architecture; and electronics and safety.

- The business to be spun off to shareholders, which will be named Powertrain, accounted for $4.5 billion of the company's revenue in 2016 and sported an adjusted operating margin of 11.5 percent and an adjusted EBITDA margin of 15.7 percent.

- The top line for the advanced connectivity, autonomy and mobility businesses last year was $12 billion, with an adjusted operating margin of 13.6 percent and an adjusted EBITDA margin of 17.6 percent.

- Delphi also on May 3 reported first-quarter net income from continuing operations of $335 million. Excluding one-off items, earnings per share of $1.59 beat the consensus estimate of sell-side analysts of $1.46 a share.

UPDATE 1-Ford, GM report higher Canadian sales for April  - 路透新闻

{{20170502T202135.962+0000}}UPDATE 1-Ford, GM report higher Canadian sales for April (Adds data for Ford, analyst's comment, U.S. context)

By Allison Lampert

MONTREAL, May 2 (Reuters) - General Motors Co and Ford on Tuesday reported higher April sales in Canada, fueled by growing demand for light trucks and crossovers, while Fiat Chrysler said its sales decreased on an annual basis.

Total Canadian auto sales declined for the first time this year in April by 1.6 percent, following a "record breaking first quarter," auto analyst Dennis DesRosiers wrote on Tuesday in a note to clients.

GM reported the sale of 30,948 total vehicles last month in Canada, an increase of 16 per cent, compared with the same month a year earlier, and the best April on record since 2008, the company said in a statement.

Ford said it sold 30,401 vehicles in Canada last month, up 0.2 percent from April 2016.

Fiat Chrysler, however, reported April sales in Canada of 27,373 vehicles, down 9 percent, compared with the same month a year earlier.

Canadian auto sales hit record highs in 2016 with the sale of around 1.95 million vehicles because of higher consumer demand for pickups and SUVs. In an April report, Scotiabank senior economist Carlos Gomes wrote he is expecting Canadian auto sales to decline slightly in 2017, to around 1.94 million units.

In the United States, GM, Ford and Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T> -- the country's top three automakers -- on Tuesday all posted lower new vehicle sales in April in a fresh sign the long boom cycle for the auto industry is losing steam. [nL1N1I40MH]

UPDATE 3-Wall St fears end of boom as automakers' April U.S. sales drop - 路透新闻

{{20170502T201428.356+0000}}UPDATE 3-Wall St fears end of boom as automakers' April U.S. sales drop(Adds annualized sales rate, analyst commentary, context, background, updates stock prices)

By Nick Carey and Joseph White

DETROIT, May 2 (Reuters) - Major automakers on Tuesday posted declines in U.S. new vehicle sales for April in a sign the long boom cycle that lifted the American auto industry to record sales last year is losing steam, sending carmaker stocks down.

The drop in sales versus April 2016 came on the heels of a disappointing March, which automakers had shrugged off as just a bad month. But two straight weak months has heightened Wall Street worries the cyclical industry is on a downward swing after a nearly uninterrupted boom since the Great Recession's end in 2010.

Auto sales were a drag on U.S. first-quarter gross domestic product, with the economy growing at an annual rate of just 0.7 percent according to an advance estimate published by the Commerce Department last Friday. [nLLASFEDIC]

Excluding the auto sector the GDP growth rate would have been 1.2 percent.

Industry consultant Autodata put the industry's seasonally adjusted annualized rate of sales at 16.88 million units for April, below the average of 17.2 million units predicted by analysts polled by Reuters.

General Motors Co shares fell 2.9 percent while Ford Motor Co slid 4.3 percent and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV's U.S.-traded shares tumbled 4.2 percent.

The U.S. auto industry faces multiple challenges. Sales are slipping and vehicle inventory levels have risen even as carmakers have hiked discounts to lure customers. A flood of used vehicles from the boom cycle are increasingly competing with new cars.

The question for automakers: How much and for how long to curtail production this summer, which will result in worker layoffs?

To bring down stocks of unsold vehicles, the Detroit automakers need to cut production, and offer more discounts without creating "an incentives war," said Mark Wakefield, head of the North American automotive practice for AlixPartners in Southfield, Michigan.

"We see multiple weeks (of production) being taken out on the car side," he said, "and some softness on the truck side."

Rival automakers will be watching each other to see if one is cutting prices to gain market share from another, he said, instead of just clearing inventory.

INVESTORS DIGEST BAD NEWS

Just last week GM reported a record first-quarter profit, but that had almost zero impact on the automaker's stock. [nL1N1I00IG]

The iconic carmaker, whose own interest was once conflated with that of America's, has slipped behind luxury carmaker Tesla Inc in terms of valuation.

On Tuesday, Tesla's market value was $53 billion, nearly $3 billion larger than GM's. [nL1N1I4170]

GM said April sales fell 6 percent, but crossovers and trucks continued to see strong growth.

Sales at Ford, the No. 2 U.S. automaker by sales after GM, fell 7.2 percent in April, while Toyota <7203.T> recorded a drop of 4.4 percent and FCA sales were off 7 percent.

U.S. consumers have increasingly shunned cars in favor of larger crossovers, SUVs and trucks. While automakers posted steep sales declines for cars in April, SUVs, crossovers and trucks were either up or off only slightly.

New vehicle sales hit a record 17.55 million units in 2016. But as the consumer appetite for new cars has waned, automakers have leaned more heavily on discounts.

GM said its consumer discounts were equivalent to 11.7 percent of the transaction price. The automaker also said its inventory level rose to 100 days of supply at the end of April versus around 70 days at the end of 2016.

Recent levels have worried analysts, and GM has promised inventories will be down by the end of 2017.

On a conference call Mark LaNeve, Ford's vice president for U.S. marketing, sales and service, insisted the industry was "relatively constrained" in offering discounts in April.

Ford car sales dropped 21 percent and trucks declined 4.2 percent, while SUV sales rose 1.2 percent.

UPDATE 1-GM writes down Venezuela operations after authorities seize plant - 路透新闻

{{20170502T152635.615+0000}}UPDATE 1-GM writes down Venezuela operations after authorities seize plant(Adds details on falling auto production, more details of GM incident)

By David Shepardson

May 2 (Reuters) - General Motors Co said on Tuesday it would take a charge of up to $100 million after a judge ordered the seizure of its plant in Valencia last month, a move that prompted the halting of its operations in Venezuela.

The largest U.S. automaker said it was deconsolidating its business in the country following the seizure of its Valencia plant on April 18 by judicial authorities, which led GM to fire 2,700 workers. [nL1N1HS221] The plant had not produced a car since the beginning of 2016 because of parts shortages and strict currency controls.

GM, the market leader in Venezuela for 35 years, said executives have expressed a willingness "to talk with government officials and union leaders about the circumstances under which it could be possible to start production and employ some number of workers with a new, viable business model."

Total auto production in Venezuela fell to a historic low of 2,849 cars in 2016, about 75 percent less than the year before, according to Venezuela's automotive industry group.

In the first two months of 2017, total Venezuelan auto production was just 240 vehicles, down 50 percent over the same period last year.

Declining auto production comes amid rising protests. On Tuesday, Venezuela's opposition was blocking streets to decry unpopular leftist President Nicolas Maduro's decision to create a new super-body known as a "constituent assembly," a move they say is a veiled attempt to cling to power by avoiding elections.

Venezuela's car industry has been hit by a lack of raw materials stemming from complex currency controls.

Nearly all vehicles built in Venezuela in the first two months this year were assembled by Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T>, which said last month its plant was operating normally. But the company said it was "only producing based on orders that come in."

In early 2015, Ford Motor Co wrote off its investment in Venezuela when it took an $800 million pretax writedown. The company does not currently produce vehicles in Venezuela.

The South American nation's economic crisis has hurt many other U.S. companies, including food makers and pharmaceutical firms. A growing number of them, like GM, have removed their Venezuelan operations from their consolidated accounts.

GM, Ford and Toyota all post U.S. sales declines in April - 路透新闻

{{20170502T141109.749+0000}}GM, Ford and Toyota all post U.S. sales declines in AprilBy Nick Carey

DETROIT, May 2 (Reuters) - General Motors Co, Ford Motor Co and Toyota Motor Corp, the top three automakers in the United States, on Tuesday all posted lower new vehicle sales in April in a fresh sign the long boom cycle for the auto industry is losing steam.

GM shares fell 3.5 percent while Ford was off 4.5 percent.

No. 1 U.S. automaker GM reported a 6 percent decline in April sales to 244,406 vehicles, but said the month continued to see strong growth for crossovers and trucks.

Over the past couple of years, U.S. consumers have increasingly shunned cars in favor of larger crossovers, SUVs and trucks.

New vehicle sales have risen ever since the end of the Great Recession, hitting a record of 17.55 million units in 2016. But as consumer appetite for new cars has waned, automakers have raised discounts to get vehicles off dealer lots.

GM said the average transaction price for its vehicles rose in the first quarter and that its consumer discounts were equivalent to 11.7 percent of the transaction price. The automaker also said its inventory level had risen to 100 days of supply at the end of April versus around 70 days at the end of 2016.

GM has said it will bring inventories down by the end of 2017, but the most recent level has created concern among analysts.

Ford, the No. 2 U.S. automaker, said sales were down 7.2 percent in April, with sales to consumers down 10.5 percent. Car sales dropped 21 percent and trucks declined 4.2 percent, while SUV sales rose 1.2 percent.

Toyota <7203.T> said sales fell 4.4 percent in April, with its luxury Lexus brand posting an 11.1 percent drop. U.S. car sales at the Japanese automaker were down 10.4 percent, while truck sales were up 2.1 percent.
