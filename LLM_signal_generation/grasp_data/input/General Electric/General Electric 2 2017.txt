BREAKINGVIEWS-Harry Potter conjures Japanese growth for Comcast - Reuters Breakingviews

{{20170301T064620.182+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-Harry Potter conjures Japanese growth for Comcast(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.)

By Quentin Webb

HONG KONG, March 1 (Reuters Breakingviews) - With Harry Potter's help, Comcast can conjure up growth in sleepy Japan. The biggest U.S. cable operator is paying 255 billion yen ($2.3 billion) to buy out Goldman Sachs and other partners in Universal Studios Japan. The Osaka theme park's success, thanks partly to the boy wizard, highlights a part of the economy where domestic consumption growth is no illusion.

USJ was briefly listed, but faltered during the financial crisis. It was taken private in a 2009 management buyout backed by Goldman, private equity firm MBK, and Owl Creek, a hedge fund. That gave USJ an enterprise value of just $1.4 billion.

Growth at USJ has raced ahead since, in a manner more befitting the Hogwarts Express than the wider Japanese economy. In dollar terms, sales have roughly doubled since 2008-2009. Visitor numbers are up more than 70 percent - and about nine-tenths of those visitors are Japanese. The latest deal values USJ at $7.5 billion including debt.

Such growth bucks the stereotype of penny-pinching local consumers. Despite Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's efforts to rejuvenate the economy, household consumption fell 1.5 percent in real terms last year, excluding spending on houses, cars, and cash gifts.

The theme park's outperformance is partly the result of USJ's specific strategy. It deliberately targeted young women and families, which has paid off. And the Potter attractions, which opened in 2014, have been a big hit. But cross-country rival Tokyo Disneyland has also fared well. Despite high prices – USJ charges adults 7,600 yen per head – the operators appear insulated against wider economic doldrums.

The new deal consummates a process initiated in late 2015, when Comcast bought 51 percent of USJ for $1.5 billion. That multi-year approach to acquisitions is unusual but will be familiar to Comcast investors, since the company used a similar two-stage deal to buy NBCUniversal from General Electric .

Limited financial disclosure makes it hard to gauge how full a price Comcast is paying. But it can expect continued growth from new Nintendo and Minions attractions coming online soon. The group could also expand geographically, perhaps bringing Harry Potter to Tokyo. And while foreigners now make up just a tenth of visitors, they should be a significant source of future demand growth. Growth in Japanese tourism has already blown past expectations under Abe. Now he wants 40 million annual visitors by 2020. Comcast should enjoy the ride.

CONTEXT NEWS

- Comcast NBCUniversal said on Feb. 28 it would buy the 49 percent of Universal Studios Japan that it does not already own for 255 billion yen ($2.3 billion). The Osaka theme park includes a Harry Potter area and rides based on Spiderman and Jurassic Park.

- The biggest U.S. cable operator said the deal valued USJ at 840 billion yen including debt. The sellers include Goldman Sachs, former USJ Chief Executive Glenn Gumpel, Asian private equity firm MBK Partners, and U.S. hedge fund Owl Creek Asset Management.

- Comcast agreed to buy 51 percent of USJ in September 2015 for $1.5 billion. This earlier deal gave USJ an enterprise value of 750 billion yen.

- USJ reported sales of 68.5 billion yen in the year ended March 31, 2009, which was then equivalent to about $694 million. For the year ended Dec. 31, 2016, Comcast reported $1.4 billion of consolidated revenue from USJ.

UPDATE 1-Suez Environnement might bid for GE's water treatment business - 路透新闻

{{20170223T104247.279+0000}}UPDATE 1-Suez Environnement might bid for GE's water treatment business(Adds more details)

PARIS, Feb 23 (Reuters) - French waste and water treatment group Suez Environnement is considering making a bid for General Electric's industrial water treatment business, a Suez spokeswoman said on Thursday, confirming media reports.

French newspaper Le Figaro said on Wednesday that Suez was among a handful of other companies, mostly private equity firms which were left in the running after a second round of bidding for GE Water & Process Technologies.

GE Water earns $250-$300 million a year before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.

"GE Water is indeed a business that we are looking at because its activities are in line with our strategy of boosting our industrial market," the spokeswoman said.

GE put the unit on the block when it announced it was merging its power business with oil services group Baker Hughes on Oct. 31.

BFM Business reported that Suez was set to make a firm offer for GE Water in the coming days and that GE would chose a buyer mid-March, with the price of the unit estimated at somewhere betweed 2 and 3 billion euros ($2-3 billion).

BFM said that Suez's cheif executive Jean-Louis Chaussade had the unanimous support of his board for the acquisition and was considering financing it with a mix of debt and new capital.

Bigger French rival Veolia's chief executive Antoine Frerot said on Thursday he had also looked at buying the GE Water business but decided not to make a bid.

Veolia and Suez are both looking to expand in the industrial market as their traditional European municipal water markets are stagnating. ($1 = 0.9484 euros)

UPDATE 2-Veolia warns on profits, shares slide 7 pct - 路透新闻

{{20170223T102416.233+0000}}UPDATE 2-Veolia warns on profits, shares slide 7 pct* Lowers profit outlook

* Says low inflation limiting tariff increases

* Municipalities weighing making services public

(Adds share fall, CFO comment)

By Geert De Clercq

PARIS, Feb 23 (Reuters) - Veolia on Thursday warned it would take a year longer than expected to achieve its core earnings target, sending shares in the French water and waste firm 7 percent lower.

CEO Antoine Frerot said challenges this year would include low inflation in Europe capping water tariff increases and the threat of municipal customers returning to public water services or considering doing so.

The city of Vilnius, Lithuania is set to end its contract with Veolia this year, while Sheffield in Britain is also considering taking back public control, he said.

A bigger threat could be the loss of the contract with the Ile de France region around Paris, under which Veolia provides water for about 4.5 million people in some 150 municipalities. It will be up for renegotiation in four years.

Paris itself has ended its outsourcing contracts with Veolia and Suez and in 2010 started running its own water service, setting an example for other places to either make water management public again or put pressure on their suppliers.

EBITDA EDGES UP

Veolia lowered its outlook for earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) to a range of 3.3 billion to 3.5 billion euros ($3.69 billion) in 2019.

It had earlier forecast hitting 3.5 billion euros in EBITDA by 2018.

For 2016, it reported EBITDA up 2 percent to 3.06 billion euros on revenue down 2.3 percent to 24.39 billion euros.

"Cost cuts were the main driver of the earnings improvement and compensate the headwinds linked to the lack of inflation and the tensions on our tariffs in certain markets," Chief Financial Officer Philippe Capron told analysts.

Veolia said it would raise cost cuts to bring the 2016-18 total to 800 million euros from 600 million.

It proposed lifting its dividend to 80 cents per share from 73 cents but did not repeat its forecast for 10 percent dividend growth in 2016-18.

Frerot said dividend in coming years would move in line with core earnings.

He said 2017 earnings growth would be driven mainly by Asia, North and South America, while in Europe growth would be moderate and in France it would be flat to slightly lower.

Asked about a possible merger with its main competitor Suez, Frerot said there were no plans for an alliance.

Frerot told analysts that he had looked at assets put up for sale by U.S. industrial conglomerate General Electric , but had decided not to make an offer.

French daily Le Figaro reported on Wednesday that Suez is in the running to buy the water business GE has put up for sale and that the firm is among a handful of other companies, mostly private equity firms, left in the running after a second round of bidding for GE Water & Process Technologies.

Suez declined to comment.

Frerot also said an audit into conflicts of interest at its French water unit had been completed and would be made public in coming weeks. [nL8N1DU2IC]

UPDATE 2-Trump to seek jobs advice from firms that offshore U.S. work - 路透新闻

{{20170223T030924.351+0000}}UPDATE 2-Trump to seek jobs advice from firms that offshore U.S. work(Updates list of companies meeting with Trump)

By Andy Sullivan

WASHINGTON, Feb 22 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump, who has vowed to stop U.S. manufacturing from disappearing overseas, will seek job-creation advice on Thursday from at least five companies that are laying off thousands of workers as they shift production abroad.

Caterpillar Inc , United Technologies Corp , Dana Inc , 3M Co and General Electric Co , are offshoring work to Mexico, China, India and other countries, according to a Reuters review of U.S. Labor Department records.

Executives from the five companies are among a group of business leaders due to meet with Trump on Thursday to discuss how to help the president deliver on his promise to increase factory employment, according to the White House.

About 2,300 U.S. workers at these five companies stand to lose their jobs within the next two years as a result of offshoring, according to the Labor Department's Trade Adjustment Assistance Program, which provides retraining benefits to workers displaced by global trade. Reuters obtained the information through a Freedom of Information Act request.

The companies confirmed the planned job cuts to Reuters. It is not clear whether the other 19 executives due to meet with Trump on Thursday are currently offshoring work, as the TAA program does not cover all workers who lose their jobs due to global trade.

The lost jobs amount to a small fraction of the hundreds of thousands of U.S. workers employed by those involved in the meeting. General Electric, for example, employs 125,000 U.S. workers, financial filings show.

On the campaign trail and in the White House, Trump has painted globalization as a zero-sum game that has enriched low-wage countries while leaving the United States littered with abandoned factories and underemployed workers, and he has threatened to tax companies that offshore U.S. jobs.

The experience of companies on Trump's task force, however, shows the reality is more complex in a world where they are serving customers across the globe. Several said they were creating many new U.S. factory jobs even as they move work to other countries.

It's not clear whether Trump will opt for the carrot or the stick.

Trump plans to meet business leaders to hear their reasons for "why they're going offshore," said a White House aide who spoke on condition of anonymity.

Blue-collar workers who share Trump's skepticism of global trade say they will be watching closely to see if he will try to save their jobs.

"I don't think he's a typical politician, so there is hope alive for middle-class families that he will do something," said Scott Schmidt, one of 222 workers at a GE engine plant in Waukesha, Wisconsin who are due to lose their jobs later this year when the company shifts production to Canada.

General Electric CEO Jeffrey Immelt is among those due to meet with Trump on Thursday.

GE says it is closing its Waukesha plant because Congress has hobbled the U.S. Export-Import Bank's ability to finance large export orders while most other industrialized nations still offer such financial support. The company says it laid off 225 workers last year at a Houston factory for the same reason, shifting production to France, the United Kingdom and Hungary.

GE says it is also closing an Ohio factory and laying off 180 workers because consumers are buying fewer of the florescent and incandescent light bulbs they make there. What production remains will be handled by a factory in Hungary.

OFFSHORING AND ONSHORING

The U.S. economy lost 6 million manufacturing jobs from 2000 to 2010, roughly one-third of its total, in part due to offshoring, but the sector has added 900,000 jobs since then, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Multinational companies say labor costs now are only one factor they consider when deciding where to manufacture. An auto maker, for example, may decide to build a particular model in the country where sales are strongest, prompting parts suppliers to set up there as well so they can turn around orders quickly.

The offshoring picture is also more complex than official statistics indicate as a shuttered factory in the United States does not always mean a new factory abroad.

When auto-parts maker Dana Corp closes a factory later this year in Glasgow, Kentucky that is operating at 20 percent of capacity, one of its plants in Ohio will pick up the work, along with other factories in Mexico, India and China. Dana CEO James Kamsickas is among those scheduled to meet with Trump on Thursday.

The company plans to hire nearly 700 U.S. workers over the next three years as it expands factories in four U.S. states, spokesman Jeff Cole said.

That is little comfort to the 223 people in Kentucky who will lose their jobs.

"It seems like all these CEOs and companies have turned their backs on the American worker," said Dana employee Tim Wells, one of those who will be laid off.

LAYOFFS STILL PLANNED

The group also includes United Technologies CEO Gregory Hayes, who took heat from Trump last year for planning to move jobs from Indianapolis to Mexico. The company struck a deal with the incoming president in November to preserve roughly 700 jobs in exchange for $7 million in tax breaks.

United Technologies says it still plans to lay off 786 workers at a separate Indiana plant and move production to Mexico this year. The company is also moving work from a facility in Arden Hills, Minnesota, resulting in a loss of 72 jobs. Most of that work is staying in the United States but some is moving to Poland, spokeswoman Bethany Sherman said, and some of the affected workers will be offered positions elsewhere.

The company is adding more than 1,000 new jobs in the United States, Sherman said.

Other participants include Caterpillar Chairman Doug Oberhelman, who oversees a company that is laying off 712 workers in the American South and Midwest and moving the work to China, Mexico, Italy, France and Germany as it weathers the largest sales slump in its history. A Caterpillar spokesman said it is simultaneously creating 1,300 new manufacturing jobs elsewhere in the United States.

Also due to participate is Inge Thulin, CEO of 3M, which is eliminating 130 jobs in suburban Cincinnati and moving production to Mexico. The company says it has added more than 2,000 U.S. manufacturing jobs over the last five years.

French utility Suez in bidding for GE Water - Le Figaro - 路透新闻

{{20170222T211247.898+0000}}French utility Suez in bidding for GE Water - Le FigaroPARIS, Feb 22 (Reuters) - French waste and water company Suez is in the running to buy the water business U.S. industrial conglomerate General Electric has put up for sale, French newspaper Le Figaro reported in an advance copy of its Thursday edition.

The French group was among a handful of other companies, mostly private equity firms, left in the running after a second round of bidding for GE Water & Process Technologies, the paper said, adding that Suez declined to comment.

GE put the unit on the block when it announced it was merging its power business with oil services group Baker Hughes on Oct. 31. GE Water earns $250-$300 million a year before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, according to the company.

Trump seeks jobs advice from some firms that offshore U.S. work - 路透新闻

{{20170222T183452.534+0000}}Trump seeks jobs advice from some firms that offshore U.S. workBy Andy Sullivan

WASHINGTON, Feb 22 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump, who has vowed to stop U.S. manufacturing from disappearing overseas, is seeking job-creation advice from at least six companies that are laying off thousands of workers as they shift production abroad.

Caterpillar Inc., United Technologies Corp., Dana Inc., 3M Co., Timken Co. and General Electric Co., are offshoring work to Mexico, China, India and other countries, according to a Reuters review of U.S. Labor Department records. (Graphic: http://tmsnrt.rs/2lk9N5W)

The six firms are part of the Manufacturing Jobs Initiative, a White House advisory council created to help Trump deliver on his promise to increase factory employment. Trump is expected to meet with several manufacturing executives on Thursday, but it is not clear whether they are part of the group.

About 2,400 U.S. workers at these six companies stand to lose their jobs within the next two years as a result of the offshoring, according to the Labor Department's Trade Adjustment Assistance Program, which provides retraining benefits to workers displaced by global trade. Reuters obtained the information through a Freedom of Information Act request.

The six companies confirmed the planned job cuts to Reuters. It is not clear whether the other 19 companies on the council are currently offshoring work, as the TAA program does not cover all workers who lose their jobs due to global trade.

The lost jobs amount to a small fraction of the hundreds of thousands of U.S. workers employed by the council's 25 corporate members. General Electric, for example, employs 125,000 U.S. workers, financial filings show.

On the campaign trail and in the White House, Trump has painted globalization as a zero-sum game that has enriched low-wage countries while leaving the United States littered with abandoned factories and underemployed workers, and he has threatened to tax companies that offshore U.S. jobs.

The experience of companies on Trump's jobs council, however, shows the reality is more complex in a world where they are serving customers across the globe. Several said they were creating many new U.S. factory jobs even as they move work to other countries.

It's not clear whether Trump will opt for the carrot or the stick when he meets with the manufacturing executives on Thursday.

Trump plans to meet business leaders to hear their reasons for "why they're going offshore," said a White House aide who spoke on condition of anonymity.

Blue-collar workers who share Trump's skepticism of global trade say they will be watching closely to see if he will try to save their jobs.

"I don't think he's a typical politician, so there is hope alive for middle-class families that he will do something," said Scott Schmidt, one of 222 workers at a GE engine plant in Waukesha, Wisconsin who are due to lose their jobs later this year when the company shifts production to Canada.

General Electric says it is closing its Waukesha plant because Congress has hobbled the U.S. Export-Import Bank's ability to finance large export orders while most other industrialized nations still offer such financial support. The company says it laid off 225 workers last year at a Houston factory for the same reason, shifting production to France, the United Kingdom and Hungary.

GE says it is also closing an Ohio factory and laying off 180 workers because consumers are buying fewer of the florescent and incandescent light bulbs they make there. What production remains will be handled by a factory in Hungary.

OFFSHORING AND ONSHORING

U.S. manufacturers shed millions of jobs over the past several decades as they shifted production to low-wage countries like China, but they have added a net 900,000 jobs since 2010, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Multinational companies say labor costs now are only one factor they consider when deciding where to manufacture. An auto maker, for example, may decide to build a particular model in the country where sales are strongest, prompting parts suppliers to set up there as well so they can turn around orders quickly.

The offshoring picture is also more complex than official statistics indicate as a shuttered factory in the United States does not always mean a new factory abroad.

The company plans to hire nearly 700 U.S. workers over the next three years as the company expands factories in four U.S. states, spokesman Jeff Cole said.

That is little comfort to the 223 people in Kentucky who will lose their jobs.

"It seems like all these CEOs and companies have turned their backs on the American worker," said Dana employee Tim Wells, one of those who will be laid off.

GIVING TRUMP A CHANCE

Assembled with the help of Dow Chemical Co. Chief Executive Andrew Liveris, Trump's council is tasked with "identifying new and creative policies that can spur U.S. manufacturing and create factory jobs," a Dow spokeswoman said.

Dow has also offshored jobs. It laid off 178 technology workers in Michigan last year and moved their work to India, according to the Labor Department records. Dow confirmed the figure.

The jobs council includes labor groups like the AFL-CIO.

"People are giving president Trump a chance to demonstrate that he means what he said on the campaign trail and that he can deliver. We'll see," said AFL-CIO deputy chief of staff Thea Lee, who is on the council.

The council also includes United Technologies Corp., which Trump criticized for planning to close an Indianapolis plant and move the work to Mexico. The company struck a deal with the incoming president in November to preserve roughly 700 jobs in exchange for $7 million in tax breaks.

United Technologies says it still plans to lay off 786 workers at a separate Indiana plant and move production to Mexico this year. The company is also moving work from a facility in Arden Hills, Minnesota to Poland and other U.S. locations, resulting in a loss of 72 jobs. Some of those workers will be offered positions elsewhere, spokeswoman Bethany Sherman said.

The company is adding more than 1,000 new jobs in the United States, Sherman said.

Other panel participants engaged in offshoring include:

- Caterpillar, which is laying off 712 workers in the American South and Midwest and moving the work to China, Mexico, Italy, France and Germany as it weathers the largest sales slump in its history;

- 3M, which is eliminating 130 jobs in suburban Cincinnati and moving production to Mexico;

- Timken Co., which is laying off 120 people at a ball-bearing plant in Tennessee due to declining demand and moving the work to other plants in the United States and abroad.

"To stay strong and grow jobs in the United States, we must be able to compete and win where our customers need us today and in the future," Timken spokeswoman Nicole DiSalvo said.

A Caterpillar spokesman said it was simultaneously creating 400 new manufacturing jobs elsewhere in the United States. 3M said it had added more than 2,000 U.S. manufacturing jobs over the last five years.

GE, Intel, AT&T team up to put cameras, mics in San Diego  - 路透新闻

{{20170222T153437.976+0000}}GE, Intel, AT&T team up to put cameras, mics in San Diego By Alwyn Scott

SEATTLE, Feb 22 (Reuters) - General Electric will put cameras, microphones and sensors on 3,200 street lights in San Diego this year, marking the first large-scale use of "smart city" tools GE says can help monitor traffic and pinpoint crime, but raising potential privacy concerns.

Based on technology from GE's Current division, Intel Corp and AT&T Inc , the system will use sensing nodes on light poles to locate gunshots, estimate crowd sizes, check vehicle speeds and other tasks, GE and the city said on Wednesday. The city will provide the data to entrepreneurs and students to develop applications.

Companies expect a growing market for such systems as cities seek better data to plan and run their operations. San Diego is a test of "internet of things" technology that GE Current provides for commercial buildings and industrial sites.

"This is a brand new market," Maryrose Sylvester, chief executive officer of GE Current, said in an interview. A 2014 estimate by Frost & Sullivan predicted the market for cities could be valued at $1.5 trillion by 2020, she said.

"San Diego is a very early adopter. While it's a smallish deal in dollars it's the biggest deal of this kind yet."

GE's CityIQ nodes will be rolled out starting in July and data will be available in the fall, Jen Lebron, spokeswoman for San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer, said. The system is included in a $30 million GE LED lighting upgrade to 14,000 of San Diego's 60,100 street lights, which is expected to save the city $2.4 million a year.

San Diego's city council approved the lighting in December, without discussion of potential privacy issues raised by the surveillance system, and no objections arose during a pilot that began in 2014 in downtown San Diego, Lebron said.

"It's anonymous data with no personal identifiers," she said. Video is not as detailed as security camera footage.

The San Diego Police Department already uses ShotSpotter, a gunfire detection system, to help solve crimes, Lebron said. San Francisco, Chicago and more than 40 other cities use ShotSpotter, according to the company's website.

GE hopes cities will make the data available to businesses. Current's data and open software platform should allow programmers to develop applications, said John Gordon, chief digital officer at GE Current: "Everything from traffic and parking problems to finding the quietest way to walk home and have a cell phone conversation."

UPDATE 1-CEOs of 16 U.S. companies urge Congress to pass border tax - 路透新闻

{{20170221T163033.939+0000}}UPDATE 1-CEOs of 16 U.S. companies urge Congress to pass border tax(Adds comments from McIlhenny Company CEO)

By Ginger Gibson

WASHINGTON, Feb 21 (Reuters) - Chief executive officers of 16 companies, including Boeing Co , Caterpillar Inc and General Electric Co , have urged the U.S. Congress to pass a comprehensive tax code rewrite, including a controversial border tax.

In a letter to Republican and Democratic leadership on Tuesday, the CEOs said a Republican-proposed border adjustment tax would make U.S.-manufactured products more competitive abroad and at home by making imported goods face the same level of taxation.

It was the latest move in a back-and-forth lobbying effort from companies over changes to the tax code.

Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan has proposed lowering the corporate income tax to 20 percent from 35 percent, imposing a 20 percent tax on imports and excluding export revenue from taxable income.

The proposal has drawn opposition from large U.S. corporations that require imports, like retailers and auto manufacturers. Those that export much of their output tend to support the tax code changes.

In a separate report, the technology policy group Information Technology & Innovation Foundation called on Congress to lower the corporate rate, but warned that elements like the border tax risked jeopardizing the effort.

"In order for corporate tax reform to succeed in boosting economic growth, lawmakers should focus on the most essential changes that will have the greatest effect on innovation and competitiveness," Joe Kennedy, an ITIF senior fellow, said in a statement.

The ITIF is a nonpartisan think tank whose board members include representatives from large technology companies such as Apple Inc , International Business Machines Corp and Intel Corp .

Tony Simmons, CEO of McIlhenny Co, which produces Tabasco, said while his company imports peppers to make its hot sauce, it still expects a net gain.

"We export about 40 percent of our total sales – so the border adjustment works both ways for us," Simmons said on a call Tuesday with reporters. "Our federal rate would drop."

A group of retail CEOs met last week with President Donald Trump and congressional leaders to argue against the border adjustment tax.

Trump is expected to release his tax proposal in the coming weeks. While he has said the border adjustment tax is too "complicated," his administration has said taxing goods from Mexico could fund construction of a wall along the border.

The letter supporting the border tax was signed by CEOs from Boeing, CoorsTek, Caterpillar, Dow Chemical Co , Celanese Corp ; GE, Celgene Corp , Eli Lilly and Co , Raytheon Co , Merck & Co Inc , S&P Global Inc , Oracle Corp , United Technologies Corp , Pfizer Inc and Varian Medical Systems Inc .

WASHINGTON, Feb 21 (Reuters) - Chief executive officers of 16 companies, including Boeing Co , Caterpillar Inc and General Electric Co , have urged the U.S. Congress to pass a comprehensive tax code rewrite, including a controversial border tax.

In a letter to Republican and Democratic leadership on Tuesday, the CEOs said a Republican-proposed border adjustment tax would make U.S.-manufactured products more competitive abroad and at home by making imported goods face the same level of taxation.

"If we miss this chance to fundamentally reshape the tax code, it might take another 30 years before we have another chance to try," the group of CEOs wrote in the letter, according to a copy that Reuters obtained.

It is the latest move in a back-and-forth lobbying effort from companies that proposed changes to the tax code would affect.

Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan has proposed lowering the corporate income tax to 20 percent from 35 percent, imposing a 20 percent tax on imports and excluding export revenue from taxable income.

The proposal has pitted large U.S. corporations that require imports, like retailers and auto manufacturers, against those that export much of their goods and therefore support the tax code changes.

A group of retail CEOs met last week with President Donald Trump and congressional leaders to argue against the border adjustment tax.

Trump is expected to release his own tax proposal in the coming weeks. While he has said the border adjustment tax is too "complicated," his administration has said taxing goods from Mexico could fund construction of a wall along the nation's southern border.

The letter supporting the border tax was signed by 16 CEOs: Dennis Muilenburg of Boeing, John Coors of CoorsTek, Jim Umpleby of Caterpillar, Andrew Liveris of Dow Chemical Co , Mark Rohr of Celanese Corp ; Jeffrey Immelt of GE, Mark Alles of Celgene Corp , David Ricks of Eli Lilly and Co , Tony Simmons of McIlhenny Co, Thomas Kennedy of Raytheon Co , Kenneth Frazier of Merck & Co Inc , Douglas Peterson of S&P Global Inc , Safra Catz of Oracle Corp , Gregory Hayes of United Technologies Corp , Ian Read of Pfizer Inc and Dow Wilson of Varian Medical Systems Inc .

UPDATE 1-GE to sell 82 turbines to wind power complex in Brazil - 路透新闻

{{20170220T210320.877+0000}}UPDATE 1-GE to sell 82 turbines to wind power complex in Brazil(Adds details about order, comments from GE official)

SAO PAULO, Feb 20 (Reuters) - Manufacturer General Electric Co agreed to supply 82 turbines to Brazil's CER (Companhia de Energias Renováveis), which is building a wind power complex in the country, GE's Latin America head for wind power, Jean-Claude Robert, told Reuters on Monday.

The wind power turbines will be used in a project with total generation capacity of 205 megawatts under construction in the northeastern Bahia state.

"It was an important contract, gave us some relief," Jean-Claude Robert said. Financial details of the contract were not disclosed.

Wind power equipment makers are suffering as the deepest recession in generations in Brazil reduced power demand and forced the government to delay new construction licenses for wind farms.

Equipment makers such as GE, Vestas Wind Systems AS and Acciona SA , which invested in local plants a couple of years ago, have seen orders plunge.

"This order will to help us go through this difficult period until new licenses are issued again," the GE official said.

The turbines to be installed by CER are a new type GE started to produce locally, the 2.5-116, which have a larger generation capacity per unit compared with former machines.

Despite the order, Robert said the wind power industry in Brazil urgently needs volume to keep up with operations and pay off investments.

But he sees signs of power demand recovery and expects the government to restart distribution of licenses for new projects soon.

RPT-"It would be huge": U.S. border town confronts possible import tax - 路透新闻

{{20170216T120001.921+0000}}RPT-"It would be huge": U.S. border town confronts possible import tax(Repeats with no change to text)

By Lisa Baertlein and Paul Ingram

NOGALES, Arizona, Feb 16 (Reuters) - For up to 16 hours a day, tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers and mangoes grown in Mexico flow north through a border checkpoint into Nogales, Arizona, helping to ensure a year-round supply of fresh produce across the United States.

This is a city built on cross-border trade.

Each year, some 330,000 trucks and 75,000 train cars carrying $17 billion worth of goods move through Nogales, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Economists estimate trade supports nearly one in three jobs here, ranging from workers who inspect the goods to forklift operators who unload them in distribution centers.

In many ways, Nogales represents the flip side of free trade deals that have battered industrial cities in the Midwest, where jobs have been outsourced and manufacturing plants shut down. The cities where Donald Trump's promise to throttle what he calls unfair competition resonated most profoundly during the presidential campaign.

It also represents potential risks that new trade barriers could pose for businesses and residents along the border. Only a tall, rusted fence separates Nogales, Arizona, from Nogales, Mexico; the cities are so intertwined that locals call them by a single name, "Ambos Nogales" or "Both Nogales." [L1N1DB071]

Now in office, Trump is considering a 20 percent tax on imports from Mexico, one of several ideas under review in Washington, and is promising to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement.

More than a dozen city officials, employers and workers interviewed here said a border tax, if enacted, could choke the flow of imports from Mexico. They described a chain of events that would harm the economy, threaten local jobs and lead to higher prices for U.S. consumers.

"President Trump should take a good look at the effects of whatever he does, because he's going to end up with a real problem," said Nogales Mayor John Doyle, who joined other lawmakers from Arizona, New Mexico and Texas in denouncing the import tax plan in letters to U.S. lawmakers.

Food, autos and electronics go both ways across the border checkpoint, sometimes more than once. Mexican mangoes and melons come north while California almonds and apples from Washington state go south. U.S. car parts sent to Mexican factories are imported back as finished vehicles.

"There are hundreds of products that come back and forth through the port of entry in Nogales," Doyle said.

The Trump administration told Reuters that any tax deal would protect U.S. interests.

"The American people can rest assured that any policy President Trump pursues will be designed to increase wages for American workers, reduce the U.S. trade deficit, and strengthen the economy so that it works for all," a White House official said in an email.

TIED TO TRADE

Since the 1994 implementation of NAFTA, trade between Mexico and the United States has risen more than six fold. Each country exported about $40 billion to the other in 1993. Last year the United States imported $294 billion in goods from Mexico and exported $231 billion back, U.S. Census data show.

Nationwide, nearly 5 million jobs are now tied to trade with Mexico, from importers to jobs dependent on low-cost goods, according to a study by the non-partisan Wilson Center's Mexico Institute.

In Santa Cruz County, surrounding Nogales, the produce import industry and supporting businesses account for more than 22 percent of jobs, according to a 2013 report by economists at the University of Arizona. Trade and support for factories across the border account for another 10 percent of the workforce.

The report's lead author, Vera Pavlakovich-Kochi, said a 20 percent border tax would create the strictest barriers to trade in five decades.

In addition to Trump's proposal of a 20 percent tax on imports from Mexico, Republican lawmakers have put forth a plan that would cut corporate income tax to 20 percent from 35 percent, exclude export revenue from taxable income and impose a 20 percent tax on imports.

The proposals have split Corporate America.

A group of major exporters including Boeing Co , General Electric Co and Pfizer Inc have formed a coalition to support the import tax [nL1N1FN1IA]. At the same time, large retailers, including Target Corp and Best Buy Co Inc , have countered that such a tax would raise consumer prices and hurt their businesses.[L1N1FZ1DP]

UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES

Seated in his second-floor office in a warehouse nestled in the rolling hills on the outskirts of town, produce trader Jaime Chamberlain said business with Mexico is the lifeblood of Nogales, which brings in more pounds of Mexican produce than any other U.S. border town.

It's "one of the largest industries here with the most employment and the most to lose," said Chamberlain, a board member of the Fresh Produce Association of the Americas. He voted for Trump and his pro-business, socially conservative agendas, but is lobbying state leaders to oppose the tax.

Chamberlain's parents began the family business with a $1,000 loan in 1971. He and his sister now own J-C Distributing Inc, which employs about 25 people who handle 120,000 pounds of Mexican tomatoes each week for Taco Bell in addition to orders for major companies such as Kroger Co and Sysco Corp .

The company warehouse is among more than six dozen such facilities on Interstate 19, just a few miles north of Nogales' town square. In all, they bring in fruits and vegetables worth $3.3 billion a year, according to the Fresh Produce Association.

Local officials, residents and economists warn that a tax could reverberate across the local economy. For example, a 20 percent border tax could put some of the $17 million in produce trade-related fees on custom brokerage, freight forwarding and truck permits at risk.

"There are a lot of unintended consequences with this," said Santa Cruz Board of Supervisors Chairman Manuel Ruiz. "There are domino effects all over. "

Many local business people expect Mexico to fight back.

"A 20 percent tax could start a trade war with Mexico. I don't see how we can impose that unilaterally," said Ricardo Crisantes, vice president of marketing and sales at Wholesum Harvest, which is part of a Mexico-based company that has offices in Nogales and organic farms on both sides of the border.

Company representatives said a border tax could drive the company to shift more farming to the United States, but it also could send import demand to other parts of Latin America that would bypass Nogales.

Restaurant and store owners say the tax would make already tough times even worse.

"It would be huge," said Karla Galindo, 35, who owns Rancho Grande restaurant in Nogales with her husband.

She and other local business owners said sales have already been hurt by the war of words between officials in Mexico and the United States. "People are afraid to spend their money," Galindo said.

GUIDE TO EU MERGER PROCESS

DEADLINES:

The European Commission has 25 working days after a deal is filed for a first-stage review. It may extend that by 10 working days to 35 working days, to consider either a company's proposed remedies or an EU member state's request to handle the case.

Most mergers win approval but occasionally the Commission opens a detailed second-stage investigation for up to 90 additional working days, which it may extend to 105 working days.

SIMPLIFIED:

Under the simplified procedure, the Commission announces the clearance of uncontroversial first-stage mergers without giving any reason for its decision. Cases may be reclassified as non-simplified - that is, ordinary first-stage reviews - until they are approved.

UPDATE 1-Vestas leaps to top spot in U.S. wind market - 路透新闻

{{20170210T120825.094+0000}}UPDATE 1-Vestas leaps to top spot in U.S. wind market(Adds comments, detail)

By Jacob Gronholt-Pedersen

COPENHAGEN, Feb 10 (Reuters) - Danish wind turbine maker Vestas Wind Systems has leapt to the top of the U.S. wind market, overtaking General Electric in new capacity installed last year, although slower demand growth and doubts over political support could threaten its position.

Vestas came back from the brink of bankruptcy just four years ago. Now the wind industry is entering a new phase with slower growth and more steady demand for turbines, prompting producers to turn to servicing and replacement of older turbines to grow revenue.

Vestas, the world's biggest wind turbine maker, supplied 43 percent of the 8.2 GW of wind power capacity connected to the U.S. power grid last year, the American Wind Energy Association said in a quarterly report. That was up from 33 percent in 2015 and just 12 percent in 2014.

By contrast, General Electric's market share stood at 42 percent in 2016, down from well over half in 2014, the association said, although GE remains the market leader in terms of overall installed capacity in the United States.

"It is definitely our ambition to at least keep our market share," Vestas Chief Executive Anders Runevad said in an interview.

Wind energy has surpassed hydropower as the biggest source of renewable electricity in the United States, according to the association, helped by tax credits under Barack Obama's administration. [nL1N1FU118]

Vestas reported record global revenues for 2016 on Wednesday but warned of lower orders in the United States this year, saying rapid growth in demand in the industry generally could be coming to an end as the wind market matures. [nL5N1FT24W]

The Danish company is set to lose its status as the world's top wind turbine maker after Germany's Siemens and Spain's Gamesa agreed to combine their assets in the sector.

Both GE and Siemens depend on orders from a few large customers such as NextEra Energy , while Vestas supplies a broader range.

"They've been very aggressive and maintained a diverse order book," said Luke Lewandowski, research manager at MAKE, a consultancy.

Numbers from MAKE, which include grid-connected turbines from wind farm projects that are not yet fully completed, show that GE held 42 percent of the market last year with Vestas second at 41 percent.

In June, Vestas secured a significant order for 1,000 wind turbines from MidAmerican Energy, a Berkshire Hathaway subsidiary which had until then been a Siemens client. [nFWN19903Y]

"Vestas has been really flexible in thinking and adapting themselves to the wishes of the clients in terms of location, type of turbines and the services around it," said Danny van Doesburg, senior portfolio manager at APG Asset Management, the seventh biggest shareholder in Vestas.

"We have widened the customer base quite substantially in the United States," Runevad said. "We have managed to penetrate further into the big U.S.-based utilities."

Still, risks remain for the the world's biggest wind turbine maker, which supplies the U.S. market from four factories in Colorado.

Vestas was one of the hardest hit European stocks, plunging as much as 10 percent, after Trump's election pointed to an uncertain future for the U.S. wind market, the company's largest. [nL8N1DA2S8]

After a record year in 2016, Vestas warned on Wednesday of lower order intake in the United States this year and said rapid growth in demand could be coming to an end, noting "signs of increased maturity of the wind market." [nL5N1FT24W]

Vestas said that the Production Tax Credit (PTC), which was extended for five years in December 2015, could hit its U.S. business in the near term as it gives investors more time to build their wind farm projects, reducing pressure to get projects built next year.

Tax credits that are already awarded seem safe, but there is now more uncertainty about future government support.

"How (the U.S. market) will pan out over the years is still very hard to predict," Runevad said. He seeks to position Vestas for high growth in the service segment, which grew by 15 percent last year, helped by the acquisition of two service providers.

As the industry matures, more turbines need servicing, upgrading and eventually replacement. MAKE forecasts the global service segment to grow by 9 to 10 percent per year on average over the next ten years.

"The whole service element of the wind industry can be a potential trigger for the investment case," said APG's van Doesburg.

COPENHAGEN, Feb 10 (Reuters) - Danish wind turbine maker Vestas Wind Systems has leapt to the top spot in the U.S. wind market, overtaking General Electric , data from a wind industry trade group shows.

European power grid spending bonanza fuels smart energy M&A - 路透新闻

{{20170210T060151.120+0000}}European power grid spending bonanza fuels smart energy M&A* Utilities' investment plans http://tmsnrt.rs/2jXHmvv

* IT, software vital in grid modernisation

* Large tech, industrials seek smart-tech takeovers

* Itron, Silver Spring could be targets -sources

By Christoph Steitz

FRANKFURT, Feb 10 (Reuters) - Europe's top utilities are planning to invest tens of billions of euros over the next three years to catch up with the green energy revolution, driving a flurry of takeovers by tech and engineering firms of niche, smart-energy innovators.

Upgrading power and gas networks used to be a hardware-based affair as long as steady baseload energy sources, such as coal and gas, accounted for most power generation.

But the rise of solar and wind power increased the need for intelligent IT systems that can balance out demand and supply swings while meeting energy and carbon emissions targets.

This has led industrial conglomerates and technology companies to seek out small targets to complement their offering to utility clients in the wake of Google's landmark purchase of smart thermostat maker Nest Labs in 2014.

"Everywhere in the supply chain of power there is disruption going on," said Bruce Jenkyn-Jones, co-head of listed equities at Impax Asset Management , which focuses on investments in environmental markets and resource efficiency.

M&A activity is well under way in storage and smart meters, which are key in securing access to customers and, more importantly, their data, to help the utilities tailor their power purchases and save costs.

WHAT'S IN A GRID?

Together, major European utilities will spend at least 40 billion euros by 2020 to upgrade their networks, according to ongoing investment plans, including replacing old cables, buying new smart meters and putting new IT in place.

The spending spree follows a decade of crisis, during which rival renewable capacity pushed many of their coal- and gas-fired power plants out of the market.

They have taken tens of billions of writedowns on their conventional generation assets and are now refocusing on renewable energy and getting the most out of regulated grids.

Bernstein reckons Engie and EDF from France, Gas Natural and Iberdrola from Spain, and Enel have on average increased their annual network investments by more than a fifth to a total of 14.3 billion euros.

"Utilities will keep spending on networks and industrials and tech groups will keep making selective deals to address this," a senior banking source said.

Goldman Sachs reckons power firms will stump up a total of 62 billion euros by 2025 to digitalise their grids, attracting players from numerous sectors.

"There needs to be a consolidation so that customers will have access to a broader set of solutions," said Thomas Guennegues, senior equity analyst at Swiss boutique investment firm RobecoSAM.

In Europe, big conglomerates, including ABB and Siemens are so far seen as the leading integrated providers of smart grid technology and hardware, simply because they already cover a wide range of sectors, including IT.

"Sometimes it is hard to draw the line between IT and industrials. A company like Siemens is a bit of both," Frederic Fayolle, senior fund manager at Deutsche Asset Management, said.

General Electric in November bought Bit Stew Systems and Wise.io to expand its platform for industrial internet applications, which connects big machines such as power plants to databases and analytical software. [nL1N1DG045]

Utilities, however, are likely to stay out of the game.

"I doubt that a utility can compete with Siemens, GE, nor with Google and Apple ," said Oskar Tijs, senior investment analyst at NN Investment Partners.

"On the grid side, the utilities will be mostly clients of technology companies." ($1 = 0.9357 euros)

Wind surpasses hydro as largest U.S. renewable energy source - 路透新闻

{{20170209T153059.476+0000}}Wind surpasses hydro as largest U.S. renewable energy sourceFeb 9 (Reuters) - Wind energy has surpassed hydropower as the biggest source of renewable electricity in the United States following the sector's second-biggest quarter ever for new installations, a wind industry trade group said on Thursday.

Wind installations totaled 82,183 megawatts at the end of 2016, enough to power 24 million homes, the American Wind Energy Association said in its fourth-quarter market report.

By comparison, U.S. hydroelectric capacity stands at about 80,000 megawatts, according to the federal Energy Information Administration.

Wind installations soared to 6,478 MW in the fourth quarter, accounting for nearly 80 percent of all of last year's wind installations. The fourth quarter was the industry's largest for installed capacity since the fourth quarter of 2012.

The 8,303 MW added for the year represented more than $13.8 billion in investment.

Just three turbine makers - General Electric Co , Vestas Wind Systems A/S and Siemens AG -- accounted for up to 95 percent of the U.S. turbine market in 2016.

Texas has more than 20 MW of installed wind capacity, or nearly a quarter of the market. Iowa is the second-biggest wind state, and Oklahoma overtook California for third place at the end of 2016.

The first offshore wind project in the United States also came online in the fourth quarter, the 30 MW Block Island wind farm off the coast of Rhode Island.

More than 10,000 MW of wind is under construction in the United States, about half of which is in Texas. New Mexico's wind industry is growing rapidly, with 1,300 MW under construction. Once completed, those projects will double the size of New Mexico's installed wind capacity.

Corporations and others outside the utility industry have become major purchasers of wind energy, accounting for 39 percent of capacity contracted in 2016. Projects for Google, Amazon and General Motors were completed in the fourth quarter.

UPDATE 4-Singapore Airlines places $14 bln wide-body Boeing order - 路透新闻

{{20170209T132144.429+0000}}UPDATE 4-Singapore Airlines places $14 bln wide-body Boeing order* SIA signs letter of intent to buy 39 Boeing jets

* Provisional order for 20 777-9s and 19 787-10s

* Blow to Airbus as jetmaker hesitates over bigger A350

(Adds analyst comment, details)

By Anshuman Daga and Tim Hepher

SINGAPORE/PARIS, Feb 9 (Reuters) - Singapore Airlines (SIA) announced a provisional order worth $13.8 billion at list prices to buy 39 Boeing wide-body planes on Thursday as it battles Gulf carriers, dealing a blow to Airbus in the key market for big twinjets.

SIA signed a letter of intent with Boeing for 20 777-9s and 19 787-10s to tap additional passenger growth and to modernise its fleet over the next decade. Additional options for the two aircraft types could take the deal to as many as 51 aircraft.

The preliminary order is a boost for Boeing as it seeks to restore momentum for the newest version of its long-haul 777, which after a strong debut has not had a firm order in 20 months.

It is also expected to shore up export-related U.S. jobs at a time when domestic manufacturing employment is a sensitive political issue under U.S. President Donald Trump.

"The carrier is a demanding customer, and its fleet decisions usually define market trends in the intermediate term," said Jefferies analyst Howard Rubel in a note.

Airlines typically get discounts on jet orders and Rubel estimated the deal's net value closer to $6.5 billion or about a tenth of the U.S. planemaker's annual volume.

"While the deal may have been highly competitive, it is business in part of the market that strengthens Boeing's positioning," he said.

The agreement, however, leaves a question mark over Airbus proposals to develop a larger 400-seat version of its A350 passenger jet to compete with the 406-seat Boeing 777-9.

Singapore's flagship carrier had been seen as a key potential launch customer for the proposed jet, but the European planemaker last year postponed a decision on whether to launch the new project amid pressure on demand for wide-body jets.

The fact Airbus was not yet ready to make a definitive offer to supply the new plane, relying instead on the 366-seat A350-1000, may have been a handicap in the contest for Singapore's business, an industry source said.

"Our priority is to certify and assure entry to service of the A350-1000," an Airbus spokesman said, adding the two main existing models represented a "good platform" for airline needs.

LAUNCH CUSTOMER

SIA's significant orders and recent moves to extend some of its fuel-hedging contracts to as long as five years show it is positioning itself for the next phase of growth, said Shukor Yusof, analyst at Malaysian aviation consultancy Endau Analytics.

"What's working for them is that they have very deep pockets and they are putting some of that money to replace fleet and also looking at new destinations," Yusof said.

SIA has been under pressure as demand weakens for long-haul travel amid tough competition from Middle East network carriers.

SIA said this would be the airline's first order for the newest 777 variant that is currently under development. SIA is already the launch customer for the 787-10, which is also currently in development, having placed an initial order in 2013 for 30 aircraft for delivery from the 2018/19 financial year.

The airline operates a varied fleet with more than 50 current-generation 777s in service, while subsidiaries SilkAir, Scoot and SIA Cargo also operate other Boeing planes. Thursday's preliminary order was SIA's biggest Boeing deal by value.

It also operates other Airbus aircraft including the smaller A350-900 model and the four-engined A380, the world's largest airliner, some of which could be replaced by 777-9s.

The growth of the big twinjet is driven by advances in the largest engines, sparking a parallel battle between Boeing ally General Electric and Airbus supplier Rolls-Royce .

GE is the sole supplier of engines on the 777 and Rolls-Royce won the $1.7 billion order from SIA to power the 19 Boeing Dreamliner aircraft.

European power grid spending bonanza fuels smart energy M&A - 路透新闻

{{20170210T060151.120+0000}}European power grid spending bonanza fuels smart energy M&A* Utilities' investment plans http://tmsnrt.rs/2jXHmvv

* IT, software vital in grid modernisation

* Large tech, industrials seek smart-tech takeovers

* Itron, Silver Spring could be targets -sources

By Christoph Steitz

FRANKFURT, Feb 10 (Reuters) - Europe's top utilities are planning to invest tens of billions of euros over the next three years to catch up with the green energy revolution, driving a flurry of takeovers by tech and engineering firms of niche, smart-energy innovators.

Upgrading power and gas networks used to be a hardware-based affair as long as steady baseload energy sources, such as coal and gas, accounted for most power generation.

But the rise of solar and wind power increased the need for intelligent IT systems that can balance out demand and supply swings while meeting energy and carbon emissions targets.

This has led industrial conglomerates and technology companies to seek out small targets to complement their offering to utility clients in the wake of Google's landmark purchase of smart thermostat maker Nest Labs in 2014.

"Everywhere in the supply chain of power there is disruption going on," said Bruce Jenkyn-Jones, co-head of listed equities at Impax Asset Management , which focuses on investments in environmental markets and resource efficiency.

M&A activity is well under way in storage and smart meters, which are key in securing access to customers and, more importantly, their data, to help the utilities tailor their power purchases and save costs.

The fact Airbus was not yet ready to make a definitive offer to supply the new plane, relying instead on the 366-seat A350-1000, may have been a handicap in the contest for Singapore's business, an industry source said.

"Our priority is to certify and assure entry to service of the A350-1000," an Airbus spokesman said, adding the two main existing models represented a "good platform" for airline needs.

LAUNCH CUSTOMER

SIA's significant orders and recent moves to extend some of its fuel-hedging contracts to as long as five years show it is positioning itself for the next phase of growth, said Shukor Yusof, analyst at Malaysian aviation consultancy Endau Analytics.

"What's working for them is that they have very deep pockets and they are putting some of that money to replace fleet and also looking at new destinations," Yusof said.

SIA has been under pressure as demand weakens for long-haul travel amid tough competition from Middle East network carriers.

SIA said this would be the airline's first order for the newest 777 variant that is currently under development. SIA is already the launch customer for the 787-10, which is also currently in development, having placed an initial order in 2013 for 30 aircraft for delivery from the 2018/19 financial year.

The airline operates a varied fleet with more than 50 current-generation 777s in service, while subsidiaries SilkAir, Scoot and SIA Cargo also operate other Boeing planes. Thursday's preliminary order was SIA's biggest Boeing deal by value.

It also operates other Airbus aircraft including the smaller A350-900 model and the four-engined A380, the world's largest airliner, some of which could be replaced by 777-9s.

The growth of the big twinjet is driven by advances in the largest engines, sparking a parallel battle between Boeing ally General Electric and Airbus supplier Rolls-Royce .

GE is the sole supplier of engines on the 777 and Rolls-Royce won the $1.7 billion order from SIA to power the 19 Boeing Dreamliner aircraft.

Poland has no plans to buy more company stakes - Deputy PM - 路透新闻

{{20170201T184423.621+0000}}Poland has no plans to buy more company stakes - Deputy PMBRUSSELS, Feb 1 (Reuters) - The Polish government has no plans to buy back more stakes in Polish companies from Western shareholders, but will look at market opportunities and consider offers if they are made, Polish Deputy Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said.

The conservative government has bought back, through state-controlled companies such as insurer PZU , shares in Poland's biggest private bank, Pekao SA, from Italy's UniCredit and a stake in the BPH bank from General Electric .

The transactions were in line with the nationalist-minded government's stance that it would like to see more Polish capital in the banking sector and the economy in general.

Asked if the Polish state, through the companies it controls, would consider further purchases in the banking sector or opportunities in the media sector, Morawiecki told reporters in Brussels:

"We look at ... opportunities which sometimes appear on the market. We neither stimulate them nor try to develop such opportunities."

He said the sales by UniCredit and General Electric had been prompted by the effects of the global economic crisis that began in 2008, which left many companies in difficulties but helped return ownership of banks back into Polish hands.

"As a result there was a 'domestication' of the banking sector, which makes me very happy, but we do not foresee any scenarios that on the horizon now there is another sector."

"If there are offers, then maybe our companies will take part in them. I will be equally happy if these are purely private Polish companies, with Polish capital, which want to take part in such actions of 'domesticating'," he said.

Siemens shareholders tell CEO to maintain momentum - 路透新闻

{{20170201T122927.839+0000}}Siemens shareholders tell CEO to maintain momentum* CEO has transformed group since taking over in 2013

* Veteran chairman to hand over to software expert Snabe

* Shares jump to 17-year high

By Georgina Prodhan

MUNICH, Germany, Feb 1 (Reuters) - Siemens shareholders urged Chief Executive Joe Kaeser to press ahead with transforming the engineering group which made its best annual operating profit to date last year and raised its earnings forecasts. [nL5N1FL6UO]

As unknown risks loom from the protectionist policies of new U.S. President Donald Trump, Kaeser cautioned that the German company could not afford to be complacent, while basking in a rare glow of shareholder approval at the group's annual meeting as the company's shares jumped to a 17-year high on Wednesday.

"I admit we don't always succeed in everything. And risks lurk everywhere. But we have noticeably improved," Kaeser said.

Siemens raised its earnings forecasts on Tuesday after its industrial business profit jumped in its fiscal first quarter, lifted by its factory automation unit. [nL5N1FL6UO]

Asked about the risks and opportunities arising from Trump's election, Kaeser sounded clearly more concerned than three months ago when he had urged people to "give Trump a chance".

"The new American president has a style that's different from what we're accustomed to," he told a news conference ahead of the AGM. "It worries us, what we see."

Kaeser has made multi-billion-dollar bets on oil and gas, wind power and industrial software while shedding the last of Siemens' consumer businesses since taking over as CEO of Europe's top engineering group in 2013.

Many of these, especially oil and gas, depend on the United States, Siemens' biggest single market where it makes 21 percent of its revenue and employs 50,000 people.

The former finance chief now plans to list Siemens' healthcare operations. [nL5N1FF5MN]

POWER CEMENTED

The chief executive has cemented the power he won in a boardroom coup, seeing off veteran managers such as Siegfried Russwurm -- who gave a hard stare from the stage as Kaeser wished "Siggi" all the best for the future.

In the latest change, Chairman Gerhard Cromme announced he planned to hand over next year to 51-year-old former SAP co-CEO Jim Hagemann Snabe after a decade in office, marking a move to a more software-oriented era. [nF9N0ZM02F]

Kaeser has also banished, at least for now, the huge one-off charges for poor project risk management that plagued Siemens in the past - helping it reach a record operating profit of 8.74 billion euros ($9.43 billion) in its last fiscal year.

"We want the last, strong financial year not to remain an exception but to represent the new normal at Siemens. The old Siemens disease must never break out again," fund manager Ingo Speich of Union Investment, the 12th-largest shareholder in Siemens, told the AGM in Munich.

Speich praised the share-price performance of Siemens, which has risen by a third over the past year, outperforming the German blue-chip DAX <.GDAXI> as well as rival General Electric - whose shares rose just 5 percent in the same period - although lagging Rockwell Automation's 60 percent leap.

Siemens shares jumped a further 4.9 percent to a 17-year high of 122 euros on Wednesday after the trains-to-turbines group raised its profit forecast.

Siemens' raised profit outlook is still seen by some analysts as conservative, but executives warned that political uncertainty was working against many of its businesses, especially those requiring large, long-term investments.

"Price pressure is intense," Chief Financial Officer Ralf Thomas told journalists of the Power and Gas business, whose orders dropped 40 percent last quarter. "We have to fight for every order." ($1 = 0.9271 euros)

BREAKINGVIEWS-Siemens beats activist investors at their own game - 路透新闻

{{20170201T112742.048+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-Siemens beats activist investors at their own game(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.)

By Olaf Storbeck

LONDON, Feb 1 (Reuters Breakingviews) - If you can't beat them, join them. This is in a nutshell how Siemens boss Joe Kaeser has avoided coming into the crosshairs of militant shareholders, unlike peers GE and ABB . Since ousting his hapless predecessor Peter Loescher in a 2013 boardroom battle, Kaeser has taken his cues from the textbooks of investor activism by carving out businesses, cutting red tape and lifting payouts to investors.

The Munich-based group's impressive performance in the quarter to December vindicates the approach. The industrial businesses' profit margin rose by a quarter to 13 percent. For the full year, profitability may rise close to levels that Loescher promised but never achieved. Nor is this at the expense of growth. Analysts expect revenue to increase 5.5 percent this year - the biggest rise in five years.

Rather, Siemens is becoming a simpler, more streamlined company. Kaeser has pulled the group out of fringe businesses like household appliances and hearing aids. The wind turbines unit is forming a joint venture with Spanish rival Gamesa , and the healthcare division will be listed separately. At the same time, the dividend is up by a quarter since 2013 and the group has embarked on two large share buybacks. Siemens is also doing better at executing large-scale projects, lowering one-off charges that were a constant drag on profits in the past.

Granted, Kaeser hasn't got everything right. His biggest blunder was the acquisition of U.S. oil kit maker Dresser-Rand for $7.8 billion in 2014, just before oil prices collapsed. But overall, his home-made version of activism has paid off nicely for shareholders. Since August 2013, Siemens has generated an average total shareholder return of 14.9 percent per year, compared with 7.3 percent at Swiss rival ABB and 9.3 percent at GE, which have both faced activist investor pressure.

Even after presiding over a 48 percent rise in Siemens' share price, Kaeser's success has yet to be fully reflected in the group's valuation. The stock is trading at around 15 times the next 12 months earnings, Thomson Reuters data show. That's a discount of a fifth to ABB and 15 percent below GE. If Kaeser keeps up his DIY brand of activism, this gap will close.

UPDATE 1-GE to sell entire stake in S.Korea's Hyundai Card - Reuters News

{{20170201T084836.525+0000}}UPDATE 1-GE to sell entire stake in S.Korea's Hyundai Card(Adds GE announcement, background)

SEOUL, Feb 1 (Reuters) - General Electric said on Wednesday it has agreed to sell its 43 percent stake in South Korean credit card firm Hyundai Card Co Ltd [HYMTRH.UL] as the U.S. industrial giant continues to trim its exposure to the financial services sector.

Hyundai Commercial Inc [HYMTRE.UL], Affinity Equity Partners, GIC and AlpInvest signed a deal to buy the stake, GE said in a statement, without disclosing the deal value.

GE, which is exiting its investment after 12 years, had 69 million shares in Hyundai Card.

UPDATE 2-Siemens raises outlook after Q1 profit beats forecasts  - 路透新闻

{{20170131T214754.028+0000}}UPDATE 2-Siemens raises outlook after Q1 profit beats forecasts * Now expects FY industrial margin of 11-12 pct vs 10.5-11.5 pct

* Digital Factory profit jumps 60 pct, boosted by portfolio gain

* Group industrial profit 2.51 bln eur; Reuters poll avg 2.14 bln

(Adds details on CEO's style, competitors, Egypt contract)

By Georgina Prodhan

MUNICH, Germany, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Top European engineering group Siemens raised its earnings forecasts on Tuesday after its industrial business profit jumped in the fiscal first quarter, lifted by its factory automation unit.

The German trains-to-turbines company said it now expected an industrial profit margin of 11-12 percent for the year to end-September, versus its previous forecast for 10.5-11.5 percent. It made 13 percent in the first quarter.

Siemens' core industrial software division, Digital Factory, reported a 60 percent profit jump in profit and a margin of 26.1 percent, boosted by a one-off portfolio gain but also a 4 percent rise in sales driven by China.

That lifted group industrial profit 26 percent to 2.51 billion euros, well above the average estimate of 2.14 billion euros in a Reuters poll, even excluding the 172 million-euro gain. [nL5N1FG6OW]

Siemens did not say in its statement whether sales had also risen in the United States, as they did in the quarter for U.S. rival Rockwell Automation , whose stock has risen about 19 percent since Donald Trump was elected president on Nov. 8.

"We will continue to rigorously execute our strategy programme," said Chief Executive and former finance chief Joe Kaeser, under whose stewardship Siemens' past execution blunders and related large one-off charges have largely disappeared.

Siemens said it was ahead of schedule with an 8 billion-euro ($8.6 billion) electricity contract in Egypt, its largest single order to date, which is designed to boost the north African nation's power-generation capacity by 45 percent. [nFWN1FL0V1]

But first-quarter orders fell by a greater-than-expected 14 percent, partly reflecting the lack of a similar large contract this year but also a sharp drop in power and gas orders from Europe and the Middle East and a big decline in the Americas.

U.S. rival General Electric's orders in power-related equipment including gas turbines, where it competes with Siemens, fell 28 percent in the quarter, compared with a 40 percent drop for Siemens.

Siemens' first-quarter sales rose by a weaker-than-expected 3 percent on a comparable basis to 19.1 billion euros ($20.6 billion). The company stuck to its forecasts for "moderate" full-year sales growth and orders higher than sales.

It raised its earnings-per-share forecast to 7.20 to 7.70 euros from a previous 6.80 to 7.20 euros, after net profit jumped 25 percent to 1.94 billion euros.

Siemens gave no further details on plans for its healthcare division Healthineers, which it plans to list while keeping a majority stake, ahead of a press conference and annual shareholder meeting on Wednesday. ($1 = 0.9265 euros)
