{{20171129T165326.586+0000}}Exxon nears deal to explore for oil and gas offshore MauritaniaBy Edward McAllister

DAKAR, Nov 29 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil is close to signing a deal to explore for oil and gas offshore Mauritania, its first foray into the West African country, Mauritania's oil, energy and mines director said on Wednesday.

An Exxon Mobil spokeswoman declined to comment on the deal, but said the Texas-based company does not yet have drilling activities in Mauritania.

Interest has surged in oil and gas fields offshore of Mauritania and neighbour Senegal since big discoveries by Cairn Energy and Kosmos Energy , the latter now partnered with BP, in separate projects over the last three years. Both are expected to start production early next decade.

London-based BP is already developing a major gas project and France's Total has bought into several exploration licences in both countries.

"We have agreed on the terms of three blocks," Moustapha Bechir, Mauritania's director general of oil, energy and mines told Reuters on the sidelines of an Oil & Gas Council conference in Dakar. He said they and Exxon had yet to formally sign the deal, but would do soon.

Experts describe the deep waters there as the next big frontier in energy drilling, though the true size of the deposits is not yet known. BP next year plans to make a final investment decision on a liquefied natural gas (LNG) project that would ship West African gas worldwide.

Long overlooked by firms more focused on massive deposits in the Gulf of Guinea further south, Senegal's and Mauritania's oil and gas was discovered by new technology that has given companies a better idea of what lies under the sea bed.

Now, specialist firms are trawling the deep waters making seismic tests to determine what is below. Oil service companies such as Baker Hughes, now part of General Electric , Schlumberger, and others are lining up to team up with oil producers to develop the resources.

Governments in less developed areas south of Senegal and Mauritania's deposits, including Gambia, Guinea Bissau and Guinea, are also trying to coax oil companies in the hope that they can emulate the interest.

Gambia is marketing oil blocks in its thin sliver of territorial water, while Guinea has started to drill offshore.

Guinea Bissau plans to drill its first deep offshore well next year, Celedonio Vieira, the director of marketing and business development at state-run PetroGuin, told Reuters.

"We are optimistic because of the success in Senegal," he said.

Fitch cuts GE rating, outlook negative - Reuters News

{{20171128T205217.222+0000}}Fitch cuts GE rating, outlook negativeNov 28 (Reuters) - Fitch Ratings on Tuesday downgraded General Electric Co and its finance arm, GE Capital, citing deterioration in the industrial conglomerate's operating and financial performance.

The credit rating agency lowered the long-term issuer default ratings for GE and GE Capital to "A+" from "AA-" and their short-term issuer default ratings to "F1" from "F1+", with a negative outlook.

Fitch said a slower return to both higher margins and stronger free cash flow than previously anticipated prompted the downgrade.

GE's performance was being affected by "secular" changes in its power segment's gas turbine business that has reduced long-term prospects for growth, it added.

The company is aiming to reduce overhead costs by $2 billion next year, with half of that coming from its troubled power unit, which sells electrical generation equipment.

The power unit has struggled due to weak demand and excess inventory in the market.

Fitch said GE has identified several actions that should improve its operating performance, but the implementation could occur over an extended period and there could be numerous execution risks.

"Cash flow available to the industrial business will be reduced through at least 2018 by the suspension of dividends from GE Capital while it reviews its insurance reserves," the agency said in a statement.

Earlier this month, Moody's downgraded General Electric one notch to "A2" from "A1" due to what it called "severe deterioration" in the financial performance of GE's power segment expected to last through at least 2019. [nL1N1NM159]

REFILE-Pressured for profit, oil majors bet big on shale technology - Reuters News

{{20171128T141258.795+0000}}REFILE-Pressured for profit, oil majors bet big on shale technology(Refiles to removes extra word 'effort' in sixth paragraph.)

By Ernest Scheyder

HOUSTON, Nov 28 (Reuters) - Shale oil engineer Oscar Portillo spends his days drilling as many as five wells at once - without ever setting foot on a rig.

Part of a team working to cut the cost of drilling a new shale well by a third, Portillo works from a Royal Dutch Shell Plc office in suburban Houston, his eyes darting among 13 monitors flashing data on speed, temperature and other metrics as he helps control rigs more than 500 miles (805 km) away in the Permian Basin, the largest U.S. oilfield.

For the last decade, smaller oil companies have led the way in shale technology, slashing costs by as much as half with breakthroughs such as horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracking that turned the United States into the world's fastest-growing energy exporter.

(For a graphic detailing the decline in drilling costs, see: http://tmsnrt.rs/2zCXvxE)

Now, oil majors that were slow to seize on shale are seeking further efficiencies by adapting technologies for highly automated offshore operations to shale and pursuing advances in digitalization that have reshaped industries from auto manufacturing to retail.

If they are successful, the U.S. oil industry's ability to bring more wells to production at lower cost could amp up future output and company profits. The firms could also frustrate the ongoing effort by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to drain a global oil glut.

"We're bringing science into the art of drilling wells," Portillo said.

The technological push comes amid worries that U.S. shale gains are slowing as investors press for higher financial returns. Many investors want producers to restrain spending and focus on generating higher returns, not volume, prompting some to pull back on drilling.

Production at a majority of publicly traded shale producers rose just 1.3 percent over the first three quarters this year, according to Morgan Stanley .

But many U.S. shale producers vowed during third quarter earnings disclosures to deliver higher returns through technology, with many forecasting aggressive output hikes into 2018. [nL2N1N62KA]

Chevron Corp is using drones equipped with thermal imaging to detect leaks in oil tanks and pipelines across its shale fields, avoiding traditional ground inspections and lengthy shutdowns.

Ryan Lance, chief executive of ConocoPhillips - the largest U.S. independent oil and gas producer - sees ample opportunity to boost both profits and output. Conoco also oversees remote drilling operations in a similar way to Shell.

"The people that don't have shale in their portfolios don't understand it, frankly," Lance said in an interview. "They think it's going to go away quickly because of the high [production] decline rates, or that the resource is not nearly that substantial. They're wrong on both counts."

Shell, in an initiative called "iShale," has marshaled technology from a dozen oilfield suppliers, including devices from subsea specialist TechnipFMC Plc that separate fracking sand from oil and well-control software from Emerson Electric Co , to bring more automation and data analysis to shale operations.

One idea borrowed from deepwater projects is using sensors to automatically adjust well flows and control separators that divvy natural gas, oil and water. Today, these subsea systems are expensive because they are built to operate at the extreme pressures and temperatures found miles under the ocean's surface.

Shell's initiative aims to create cheaper versions for onshore production by incorporating low-cost sensors similar to those in Apple Inc's Watch, eliminating the need for workers to visit thousands of shale drilling rigs to read gauges and manually adjust valves. Shell envisions shale wells that predict when parts are near mechanical failure and schedule repairs automatically.

By next year, the producer wants to begin remote fracking of wells, putting workers in one place to oversee several projects. It also would add solar panels and more powerful batteries to well sites to reduce electricity and diesel costs.

Oil firms currently spend about $5.9 million to drill a new shale well, according to consultancy Rystad Energy. Shell expects to chop that cost to less than $4 million apiece by the end of the decade.

"There is still very little automation," said Amir Gerges, head of Shell's Permian operations. "We haven't scratched the surface."

TECHNOLOGY AND GEOLOGY

Much of the new technology is focused on where rather than how to drill.

"There is no amount of technology that can improve bad geology," said Mark Papa, CEO of shale producer Centennial Resource Development Inc

Anadarko Petroleum , Statoil and others are using DNA sequencing to pinpoint high potential areas, collecting DNA from microbes in oil to search for the same DNA in rock samples. ConocoPhillip's MRI techniques also borrow from medical advances.[nL2N1GQ0XE]

ConocoPhillips next year will start using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to analyze Permian rock samples and find the best drilling locations, a technique the company first developed for its Alaskan offshore operations.

EOG Resources Inc last year began using a detailed analysis of the oil quality of its fields. The analysis, designed by Houston start-up Premier Oilfield Laboratories, helps to speed decisions on fracking locations and avoid less productive sites.

Premier has reduced the time needed to analyze geochemical data to find oil reserves from days or weeks to seconds. Such efficiencies serve two purposes, said Nathan Ganser, Premier's director of geochemical services.

"It's not only removing costs that are superfluous," he said. "It's boosting production."

EXCLUSIVE-Airbus set to poach Rolls exec to head jetliner sales - sources - Reuters News

{{20171126T135256.145+0000}}EXCLUSIVE-Airbus set to poach Rolls exec to head jetliner sales - sources* Rolls-Royce civil engines boss Schulz tapped to run Airbus sales

* Nominations panel advances one name, subject to board approval

* Schulz would succeed industry giant Leahy, who is retiring

* Has task of lifting team dispirited by probes, leadership vacuum

(Adds analyst quotes, details, background)

By Tim Hepher

PARIS, Nov 26 (Reuters) - Airbus is poised to hire the head of Rolls-Royce's civil engines unit, Eric Schulz, to lead its commercial jetliner sales, after months of uncertainty over the successor to sales kingpin John Leahy, three people familiar with the matter said.

Schulz, president of the civil engines division at the British engineering firm, has been recommended for the post to bring in outside blood as the company faces turmoil over the impact of UK and French corruption investigations.

Christian Scherer, chief executive of turboprop maker ATR, jointly owned by Airbus and Italian aerospace firm Leonardo , had also been considered for one of aviation's highest profile roles.

Scherer, an Airbus veteran of 30 years before joining ATR, was seen by many as a leading candidate and enjoys close ties to Chief Executive Tom Enders. But although Scherer has not been linked to the compliance investigations, industry sources said the board is insisting on a break with the past.

A final decision will be taken by the Airbus board based on a panel's decision to put forward one name, that of Schulz.

Airbus and Rolls-Royce declined to comment. Schulz and Scherer could not immediately be reached for comment.

Leahy has been in the post since 1994 and is a dominant figure in the $100 billion-a-year aerospace industry, making his succession one of the sector's most closely watched moves.

He is expected to retire around Jan. 25 after deferring his departure for several months when his hand-picked successor, deputy sales chief Kiran Rao, pulled out of the race.

CLOSE TIES

Schulz, an affable 54-year-old French engineer, began his career at one of Airbus's founders, France's former state-owned Aerospatiale, before working at aerospace supplier Goodrich via a stint at two French airlines: UTA and Air Liberte.

He is part of a relatively new management team that pulled Rolls-Royce out of its own compliance scandal and financial problems and has been running civil engines since January 2016.

His experience reinforces close ties between Airbus and Rolls-Royce on wide-body jets, mirroring last year's decision by rival Boeing to recruit a top executive from its own top supplier, General Electric , to run its commercial unit.

"Rolls-Royce and Airbus are joined at the hip so they must know him well, and he them," said Agency Partners analyst Nick Cunningham, adding Schulz came across as "open and realistic".

But he will inherit a Toulouse sales organisation unsettled by recent defeats against Boeing and widely seen as desperate for stability amid the probes, which centre on a now defunct Paris-based unit of Airbus headquarters. [nL8N1MT68E]

"They have chosen a clean break but that is not without risk," a senior industry source said.

If, as expected, he is confirmed by the Airbus board, Schulz will need to act quickly to restore staff morale and rebuild bridges with customers following a wobbly Dubai Airshow this month, industry sources said. [nL8N1NN2NC]

But although he has twice worked for firms linked to Airbus, Schulz's independent career path may give him a freer hand to shape a marketing machine urgently needing a fresh spark after prolonged uncertainty over Leahy's succession.

"He is very straight; not political," said a person who has negotiated with Schulz.

Analysts say investors are for now playing down the probes and loss of order momentum because Airbus, like Boeing, is cushioned by record backlogs of jets waiting to be produced.

But the choice of sales boss is a decision that many say will influence the direction of the aerospace giant for years.

Airbus shares have risen 18.5 percent in the past six months, outperforming an almost-flat French CAC40 <.FCHI> index.

GUIDE TO EU MERGER PROCESS

DEADLINES:

The European Commission has 25 working days after a deal is filed for a first-stage review. It may extend that by 10 working days to 35 working days, to consider either a company's proposed remedies or an EU member state's request to handle the case.

Most mergers win approval but occasionally the Commission opens a detailed second-stage investigation for up to 90 additional working days, which it may extend to 105 working days.

SIMPLIFIED:

Under the simplified procedure, the Commission announces the clearance of uncontroversial first-stage mergers without giving any reason for its decision. Cases may be reclassified as non-simplified - that is, ordinary first-stage reviews - until they are approved.

U.S. oil rig count up in Nov, first monthly build since July -Baker Hughes - 路透新闻

{{20171122T181422.618+0000}}U.S. oil rig count up in Nov, first monthly build since July -Baker HughesBy Scott DiSavino

Nov 22 (Reuters) - U.S. energy companies this week added oil
rigs, with the monthly rig count rising for the first time since
July as crude prices traded near their highest levels since the
summer of 2015.

Drillers added nine oil rigs in the week to Nov. 22,
bringing the total count up to 747, General Electric Co's 
Baker Hughes energy services firm said in its closely followed
report on Wednesday.

Baker Hughes released the rig count early this week due to
the U.S. Thanksgiving Day holiday on Thursday. The report is
also the last set of data released in November.

For the month, the number of active rigs increased by 10,
after three months of declines.

The rig count, an early indicator of future output, is still
much higher than a year ago when only 474 rigs were active after
energy companies boosted spending plans for 2017 as crude
started recovering from a two-year price crash.

The increase in drilling lasted 14 months before stalling in
August, September and October after some producers started
trimming their 2017 spending plans when prices turned softer
over the summer.
   So far in 2017, U.S. crude futures  have averaged about
$50 a barrel, easily topping last year's $43.47 average. This
week, futures  were trading around $58 a barrel, their
highest since July 2015.

Looking ahead, futures were trading near $57 for calendar
2018  and $53 for calendar 2019 .

Energy consultancy Westwood Global Energy Group this week
forecast an 18 percent increase in active rigs in 2018, but said
U.S. output would climb even faster than implied by the rising
oil rig count as producers become more productive per well.

Analysts at Simmons & Co, energy specialists at U.S.
investment bank Piper Jaffray, this week revised higher their
forecast for the total oil and natural gas rig count to an
average of 874 in 2017, 927 in 2018 and 1,074 in 2019. Two weeks
ago, it forecast 872 in 2017, 910 in 2018 and 1,059 in 2019.

There were 923 oil and natural gas rigs active on Nov. 22.
The average number of rigs in service so far in 2017 was 871.
That compares with 509 in 2016 and 978 in 2015. Most rigs
produce both oil and gas.

By Lewis Krauskopf

NEW YORK, Nov 19 (Reuters) - General Electric Co shares stabilized after a brutal slide last week sent the stock near six-year lows, but the worst may not be over.

Some investors still do not see enough value to warrant buying the shares, which have lost some of their luster as a blue-chip investment.

They are sorting through massive changes announced by GE's new Chief Executive John Flannery last Monday: hugely reduced near-term profit-growth prospects, a halved dividend, and a wave of promised divestitures.

"In a sense, the stock is trying to find an investor," said Scott Lawson, vice president of Westwood Holdings Group in Dallas, who follows industrial stocks, as the stock was sliding last week. "That investor is not a growth guy, because they are not growing. It's not a value guy, because they're not cheap on the value metrics."

The massive decline for the stock - more than 40 percent this year - suggests that it would pique the interest of value players.

GE shares fell to $17.90, their lowest closing price since December 2011, after dropping 12.6 percent over Monday and Tuesday, their biggest two-day decline since the financial crisis. The stock edged back up over the rest of the week and closed Friday at $18.21 amid news that Flannery had bought about $1.1 million worth of the stock. [nL3N1NN42K]

But GE shares have not fallen enough for some investors.

"What we are looking for is a sufficient margin of safety to reasonable intrinsic value, and at the current stock price, we just don't think the margin of safety is there," Michael Kon, portfolio manager with Golub Group in San Mateo, California, said as the stock hovered around $18.

Kon said he was looking either for the stock to fall further or for better-than-expected improvement in GE's power-turbine division before any investment.

Investment advisory firm Alan B. Lancz & Associates bought some GE shares last week as the stock dipped into the $17 range, seeing value in the company's assets, which also include remaining major businesses in jet engines and healthcare, said Alan Lancz, president of the Toledo, Ohio-based firm.

But Lancz said he sees GE as an investment with a three- to five-year payoff and acknowledged the stock may fall further before that.

"We don't see any short-term, intermediate-term catalysts but we think that there is value there," Lancz said. "It's not high on our list of buys, but it is something that, I think for the long-term, it can be accumulated here."

One question facing investors is how to assess the company against its rivals.

Over the past 20 years, GE on average has traded at 19 times earnings estimates for the next 12 months, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream. That is well above the average of 15.4 times for rival diversified manufacturers Honeywell International Inc and United Technologies Corp over that time.

Following the stock's slide this year, including fallout from third-quarter financial results last month that Flannery himself called "unacceptable," GE now trades at a discount to those companies: 16.9 times forward earnings estimates against 17.3 times for United Tech and 19 times for Honeywell.

"It is going to take a long time before you can clear the cloud and maybe get GE back to a comparable valuation level with respect to other similar companies," said Chip Pettengill, portfolio manager at Bahl & Gaynor Investment Counsel in Cincinnati. Pettengill calls GE a "tarnished blue-chip stock."

GE's earnings power is stronger than the "trough," or bottom, projected for 2018, said Scott Schermerhorn, chief investment officer at Granite Investment Advisors in Concord, New Hampshire, who sees the shares particularly discounted to other industrial companies based on enterprise value to sales comparisons.

His firm has held onto the GE shares purchased earlier this year, and is considering buying more, Schermerhorn said.

"The businesses they have are at least as good as a typical industrial, and therefore we think with proper management you're going to see earnings accelerate," Schermerhorn said, while cautioning: "It's not going to be quick."

* Engine Alliance could re-enter fray but doubts over investment

By Tim Hepher and Alexander Cornwell

DUBAI, Nov 19 (Reuters) - A preliminary deal to sell 36 A380s to Emirates blew up in an Airbus hospitality chalet moments before the Gulf carrier was expected to shower $30 billion on the planemaker and its U.S. rival Boeing at the start of last week's Dubai Airshow.

Two top Emirates officials broke the news to Airbus CEO Tom Enders and his sales chief John Leahy that the widely expected $16 billion deal would not be signed that day, leaving uncertainty over the future of the world's largest jetliner.

The halt came so swiftly that Airbus PR executives who were already in place for a double-signing ceremony a hundred yards away found themselves awkwardly among the audience as Boeing walked away with the sole Emirates order, worth $15 billion.

The unusual stumble in slick air show choreography highlights problems over timing and trust that may even now complicate a deal between Airbus and Emirates, people aware of the matter said.

One of the closest and most successful relations in aviation is looking bruised and throws up new complications for Airbus just as it struggles to maintain business as usual at a time when it faces British and French compliance probes.

A day after Airbus's hopes were dashed, airline president Tim Clark publicly delivered a message from Dubai's government saying it wanted a guarantee from Airbus that it would keep producing the A380 for 10 years, before the state-owned carrier would agree to placing a new order. [nL8N1NJ5ID]

Enders emailed Clark calling the ultimatum, first reported by Reuters, unhelpful, two people aware of the matter said.

Airbus and Emirates declined comment.

"There is a worrying breakdown of the relationship between Airbus and Emirates," said a person familiar with the talks.

"Airbus was confident of getting a deal," a Gulf source added. "But Dubai does not want to be taken for granted."

ENGINE HEADACHE

Air show delegates said Emirates and Airbus must now resolve problems of visibility if a deal is to be done.

Many in the industry say Airbus appears directionless as Leahy is due to retire in January, the guardian of the Emirates relationship, Habib Fekih, did so earlier this year and doubts grow over whether Enders will secure a new CEO mandate in 2019. Meanwhile the probes have badly clogged Airbus decision-making.

On the Emirates side, top executive Clark - although full of energy at 67 and dismissing talk of retirement - is likely to hand over the baton at some stage, and it is uncertain how committed other managers are to the A380 flagship.

"Nobody knows who is going to be in charge of the other side later, which doesn't help," said a person familiar with the matter.

The Airbus board will however have to think hard before giving Dubai the guarantee it wants, which would go beyond the scope of a normal contract for specific planes.

"It's not something any company can easily do, especially on something dragging down the bottom line," the same person said.

For Emirates, the problem runs deeper than simply buying an aircraft from Airbus.

Airlines deal directly with numerous suppliers, from landing gears to tyres and entertainment systems. Each takes its cue from the planemaker as conductor of a large orchestra.

"If you're the only customer your fear is the manufacturer will lose interest and that becomes a signal to suppliers to make support a lower priority," a person close to the matter said. "Then you end up unsure who is supporting what."

The biggest question mark hangs over the massive engines.

In 2015, Britain's Rolls-Royce won its largest-ever order, worth $9 billion, to displace U.S. consortium Engine Alliance to power a batch of 50 four-engined A380s for Emirates.

But to win the deal it gave ambitious fuel-consumption targets and Emirates signalled last week the cards could be shuffled again for the potential new order. "If we ordered more, we might contemplate talking to both sides," Clark said.

But Engine Alliance output ends in 2018. Keeping its assembly lines warm would require a fresh commitment from its parents General Electric and Pratt & Whitney .

"That's a pretty big ask right now. It all comes down to money," a person close to the consortium said.

GE is involved in a major rethink of strategy and wants to be more selective about investments, while Pratt & Whitney is absorbed with fixing delays on smaller engines. [nL3N1NJ3GQ]

SECOND-HAND MARKET

Keeping engine makers on board is all the more challenging because of the lack of an A380 second-hand market.

Engine makers make money on spares and services over the working life of an engine which is usually 20-25 years.

But in another accident of timing, the first A380 to carry passengers, in 2007, was being mothballed in France just as Airbus was trying to cling on to an Emirates deal at last week's show, after just 10 years in service with Singapore Airlines.

That sets a worrying precedent for suppliers of Emirates, which usually operates planes for 12 years and around 20 of whose A380s may exit the fleet to make way for new purchases.

Faced with the possibility that any new A380 engines may have only half their budgeted life, engine makers may charge more for them up-front or more in hourly service contracts.

Still, Emirates believes an Airbus guarantee over the life of the programme could break the logjam and generate new orders.

"I would think a revitalisation of the line would bring the big players together and say what can we all do to make this work ... including propulsion," Clark said.

Pride may yet work in favour of a deal over the A380, which is Airbus's only path into business with Emirates for the time being after the airline placed new orders with Boeing.

"This (Airbus) management took the decision to launch the A380 so killing it now would make them look foolish," a senior air show delegate said.

"They have got to be able to say that when they left, the A380 was still being built."

Baker Hughes' sell-off could mean buying opportunity -Barron's - Reuters News

{{20171119T221106.404+0000}}Baker Hughes' sell-off could mean buying opportunity -Barron'sNEW YORK, Nov 19 (Reuters) - A recent sell-off in the stock of Baker Hughes, a GE-owned company , might mean a chance to buy the shares at a bargain, a report in Barron's financial newspaper said.

The stock lost 7.4 percent over two days last week after General Electric outlined steps to shrink its array of businesses. It said it planned to get rid of its 62.5 percent stake in Baker Hughes. [nL3N1NJ3GQ] [nL8N1NJ89Q]

GE, which completed its merger with Baker Hughes in July, is required by contract to wait two years from the completion date before it can sell unless Baker Hughes gives it permission to start exiting before then, Barron's said in its Nov. 20 edition.

It would be relatively easy to spin off because Baker Hughes is already a publicly traded company, according to Melius Research analyst Scott Davis, quoted in the Barron's article.

If GE exits, Baker Hughes will still benefit from its relationship with GE, and the stock would also benefit if the energy sector starts to rally, Barron's said.

Baker Hughes shares closed Friday at $30.91, up 2.5 percent.

ANALYSIS-Battered GE shares lure some buyers but worst may not be over - Reuters News

{{20171119T110001.454+0000}}ANALYSIS-Battered GE shares lure some buyers but worst may not be overBy Lewis Krauskopf

NEW YORK, Nov 19 (Reuters) - General Electric Co shares stabilized after a brutal slide last week sent the stock near six-year lows, but the worst may not be over.

Some investors still do not see enough value to warrant buying the shares, which have lost some of their luster as a blue-chip investment.

They are sorting through massive changes announced by GE's new Chief Executive John Flannery last Monday: hugely reduced near-term profit-growth prospects, a halved dividend, and a wave of promised divestitures.

"In a sense, the stock is trying to find an investor," said Scott Lawson, vice president of Westwood Holdings Group in Dallas, who follows industrial stocks, as the stock was sliding last week. "That investor is not a growth guy, because they are not growing. It's not a value guy, because they're not cheap on the value metrics."

The massive decline for the stock - more than 40 percent this year - suggests that it would pique the interest of value players.

GE shares fell to $17.90, their lowest closing price since December 2011, after dropping 12.6 percent over Monday and Tuesday, their biggest two-day decline since the financial crisis. The stock edged back up over the rest of the week and closed Friday at $18.21 amid news that Flannery had bought about $1.1 million worth of the stock. [nL3N1NN42K]

But GE shares have not fallen enough for some investors.

"What we are looking for is a sufficient margin of safety to reasonable intrinsic value, and at the current stock price, we just don't think the margin of safety is there," Michael Kon, portfolio manager with Golub Group in San Mateo, California, said as the stock hovered around $18.

Kon said he was looking either for the stock to fall further or for better-than-expected improvement in GE's power-turbine division before any investment.

Investment advisory firm Alan B. Lancz & Associates bought some GE shares last week as the stock dipped into the $17 range, seeing value in the company's assets, which also include remaining major businesses in jet engines and healthcare, said Alan Lancz, president of the Toledo, Ohio-based firm.

But Lancz said he sees GE as an investment with a three- to five-year payoff and acknowledged the stock may fall further before that.

"We don't see any short-term, intermediate-term catalysts but we think that there is value there," Lancz said. "It's not high on our list of buys, but it is something that, I think for the long-term, it can be accumulated here."

One question facing investors is how to assess the company against its rivals.

Over the past 20 years, GE on average has traded at 19 times earnings estimates for the next 12 months, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream. That is well above the average of 15.4 times for rival diversified manufacturers Honeywell International Inc and United Technologies Corp over that time.

Following the stock's slide this year, including fallout from third-quarter financial results last month that Flannery himself called "unacceptable," GE now trades at a discount to those companies: 16.9 times forward earnings estimates against 17.3 times for United Tech and 19 times for Honeywell.

"It is going to take a long time before you can clear the cloud and maybe get GE back to a comparable valuation level with respect to other similar companies," said Chip Pettengill, portfolio manager at Bahl & Gaynor Investment Counsel in Cincinnati. Pettengill calls GE a "tarnished blue-chip stock."

GE's earnings power is stronger than the "trough," or bottom, projected for 2018, said Scott Schermerhorn, chief investment officer at Granite Investment Advisors in Concord, New Hampshire, who sees the shares particularly discounted to other industrial companies based on enterprise value to sales comparisons.

His firm has held onto the GE shares purchased earlier this year, and is considering buying more, Schermerhorn said.

"The businesses they have are at least as good as a typical industrial, and therefore we think with proper management you're going to see earnings accelerate," Schermerhorn said, while cautioning: "It's not going to be quick."

By Jennifer Saba

NEW YORK, Nov 17 (Reuters Breakingviews) - The telecom firm's acquisition of Time Warner, owner of CNN, may hit regulatory hurdles in D.C. President Trump's caustic tweets against the news network look self-interested, but watchdogs could yet legitimately rethink norms of competition. Plus: GE searches for a way forward.

U.S. oil drilling rig count holds steady this week -Baker Hughes - 路透新闻

{{20171117T180927.816+0000}}U.S. oil drilling rig count holds steady this week -Baker HughesNov 17 (Reuters) - U.S. energy companies kept the oil rig
count unchanged this week, General Electric Co's  Baker
Hughes energy services firm said on Friday, as some analysts
expect a gradual decline in overall rigs in the fourth quarter
and in 2018.

The rig count , an early indicator of future
output, held at 738 in the week to Nov. 17, still much higher
than 471 rigs a year ago as energy companies boosted spending
plans for 2017 as crude started recovering from a two-year price
crash.

The increase in drilling lasted 14 months before stalling in
August, September and October after some producers started
trimming their 2017 spending plans when prices turned softer
over the summer.

So far in 2017, U.S. crude futures  have averaged
almost $50 a barrel, easily topping last year's $43.47 average.
This week, futures  were trading around $56 a barrel after
rising close to $58 last week, their highest since July 2015.

Looking ahead, futures were trading near $56 for the balance
of the year  and calendar 2018 .

In anticipation of higher prices this year and next than in
2016, exploration and production (E&P) companies increased their
spending on U.S. drilling and completions in 2017 by about 53
percent over 2016, according to U.S. financial services firm
Cowen & Co.

Cowen said 14 of the 64 E&Ps they track have already
provided capital expenditure guidance for 2018 indicating a 9
percent increase in planned spending over 2017.

Cowen, which has its own U.S. rig count, said it expects a
gradual decline in rigs in the fourth quarter of 2017 and in
2018.

There were 915 oil and natural gas rigs active on Nov. 17.
The average number of rigs in service so far in 2017 was 870.
That compares with 509 in 2016 and 978 in 2015. Most rigs
produce both oil and gas.

The total rig count so far in the fourth quarter averaged
915, down from an average of 942 in the third quarter.

The United States, whose upstream energy industry has seen a
resurgence with the development of fracking technology, would
become the "undisputed leader of oil and gas production
worldwide," the International Energy Agency's (IEA) head Fatih
Birol said on Thursday. [nL8N1NM4YI]

The U.S. is expected to account for more than 80 percent of
global oil production growth in the next 10 years and it will
produce 30 percent more gas than Russia by that time, the
Paris-based energy watchdog said.

The U.S. Energy Information Administration this week
projected U.S. shale production would rise for a 12th
consecutive month in December to 6.2 million barrels per day.
[nL1N1NJ1ES]

Overall, U.S. production was expected to rise to 9.2 million
bpd in 2017 and a record 10.0 million bpd in 2018 from 8.9
million bpd in 2016, the EIA said. Output peaked at 9.6 million
bpd in 1970. [EIA/M]

GE shares rise after CEO Flannery buys stock - Reuters News

{{20171117T144329.452+0000}}GE shares rise after CEO Flannery buys stockNov 17 (Reuters) - Shares of General Electric Co opened higher on Friday after Chief Executive John Flannery disclosed that he bought 60,000 shares of the industrial conglomerate's stock.

Flannery bought the shares on Wednesday at $18.27 apiece, a regulatory filing showed on Friday. (http://bit.ly/2A8k0uY)

GE's shares rose 1 percent to $18.44 in early trading.

Flannery's purchase comes when GE's shares are hovering around six-year lows following a poorly received overhaul plan that the 125-year old conglomerate unveiled on Monday.

The announcement included a 50 percent cut to GE's dividend and a lower earnings forecast for 2018. GE shares fell 12.6 percent in the two days following the announcement.

Analysts earlier this week said GE's revamp plan was not aggressive enough and may not be able to revive the company. [nL3N1NK65M]

The stock, which has fallen 42.2 percent since the beginning of 2017, is the worst performer on the Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> this year.

UPDATE 3-Siemens to cut 6,900 jobs to tackle flailing turbines business - Reuters News

{{20171116T195548.876+0000}}UPDATE 3-Siemens to cut 6,900 jobs to tackle flailing turbines business* To cut close to 2 pct of global workforce

* Hammer will fall hardest in Power and Gas division

* Power industry experiences "unprecedented" disruption

(Adds comment from German Economy Minister)

By Georgina Prodhan and Christoph Steitz

FRANKFURT, Nov 16 (Reuters) - Siemens will cut about 6,900 jobs, or close to 2 percent of its global workforce, mainly at its power and gas division, which has been hit by the rapid growth of renewables.

Most of the cuts, about 6,100, will be made before 2020 at Siemens's Power and Gas division, which once thrived on supplying large gas turbines for electricity generation but has been overtaken by the global surge in solar and wind capacity.

"The power generation industry is experiencing disruption of unprecedented scope and speed," Siemens management board member Lisa Davis said. "With their innovative strength and rapidly expanding generation capacity, renewables are putting other forms of power generation under increasing pressure," she added.

Siemens' Process Industries and Drives division, which makes large mechanical drives for oil and gas extraction and turbines, will also be hit, Siemens said, not ruling out forced layoffs as part of the plan.

Aside from loss-making wind power venture Siemens Gamesa , Process Industries and Drives was Siemens's least profitable business last quarter, with a profit margin of just 2.9 percent. [nL8N1N74B7]

Siemens said roughly half of the job cuts would be made in Germany, a move likely to be unpopular with politicians currently trying to form a government. It did not specify the costs of the layoffs. [nL8N1NM2ZC]

IG Metall, Germany's largest trade union, lashed out at management, accusing Siemens of having been to late in responding to the crisis in conventional power generation and demanding no forced redundancies be implemented.

"Job cuts of this magnitude are totally unacceptable given the company is in an outstanding overall position," said IG Metall board member Juergen Kerner, who also sits on Siemens's supervisory board.

German Economy Minister Brigitte Zypries urged Siemens to treat employees fairly. "The workers are very concerned and uncertain about their future. I hope that Siemens works closely with the unions to find fair solutions for the affected sites."

She said particularly sites in structurally weak regions should be preserved.

"BURNING TO THE GROUND"

In contrast to arch-rival General Electric , Siemens was able to shield itself from a sharp downturn in demand for large turbines thanks to an 8 billion-euro ($9 billion) order for power generation in Egypt - the largest in its history - which has kept its German factories humming for the past two years.

As that order has now been fulfilled, both groups find themselves staring into a future of vast overcapacity, where supply outstrips demand by a ratio of three to one, and prices have dropped 30 percent since 2014.

Demand for powerplant sized gas turbines has tumbled and is expected to bottom out at 110 turbines a year, compared with total global manufacturing capacity of around 400 turbines, Siemens said.

"The market is burning to the ground," Siemens board member Janina Kugel who is in charge of group human resources, told journalists in a call following the announcement.

General Electric on Monday announced a halving of both its dividend and its 2018 earnings outlook, largely due to its flailing turbines business, which it acknowledged it had mismanaged as it underestimated the scale of the problem. [nL3N1NJ3GQ]

It was only the third time in the group's 125-year history that GE had lowered its dividend, with previous cuts during the Great Depression of the 1930s and last decade's financial crisis. GE is also selling large parts of its empire to focus on power, aviation and healthcare.

Siemens employs about 16,000 people in power generation in Germany, roughly a third of its global workforce in that business, including service. ($1 = 0.8480 euros)

US STOCKS-GE, energy shares drag Wall St lower; bond proxies rise - 路透新闻

(Updates to close, changes comment; adds byline)

By Rodrigo Campos

NEW YORK, Nov 14 (Reuters) - U.S. stock indexes fell on Tuesday as General Electric shares plunged for a second straight day and a drop in crude oil prices hit energy stocks.

GE fell 5.9 percent to $17.90 in the largest daily volume in two years as investors wondered if a massive overhaul of the company by new Chief Executive John Flannery will be enough to revive the industrial conglomerate. [nL3N1NK65M]

The stock touched $17.46, its lowest in nearly six years.

Energy was the largest decliner among the 11 S&P 500 sectors as oil prices fell the most in a month. The International Energy Agency forecast rising U.S. crude output and had a gloomy outlook for global demand growth. [O/R]

Exxon fell 0.8 percent and ConocoPhillips was down 2.5 percent, while the S&P 500 energy sector <.SPNY> fell 1.5 percent, the most in more than four months.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average <.DJI> fell 30.23 points, or 0.13 percent, to end at 23,409.47, the S&P 500 <.SPX> lost 5.97 points, or 0.23 percent, to 2,578.87 and the Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> dropped 19.72 points, or 0.29 percent, to 6,737.87.

Stocks favored by investors seeking yield, the so-called bond proxies, were the best performers as the yield curve, or the gap between short- and long-term U.S. government bond yields, remained near its flattest in a decade.

Utilities <.SPLRCU> and consumer staples <.SPLRCS>, sectors that pay relatively high dividends, were the best performers on the day. Utilities rose 1.2 percent for a 2.4 percent gain since Friday's close, the largest two-day percentage gain since late February.

"People are looking for yield across the globe so potentially there's foreign flows going into bond proxies," said Paul Zemsky, chief investment officer, Multi-Asset Strategies and Solutions at Voya Investment Management in New York.

He said the outperformance of stocks in the utilities and consumer staples sectors could also be due to investors getting more defensive "after growth sectors and the overall market have been doing so well this year."

The S&P 500 fell for the third session in the last four, but it remains within 1 percent of a record closing high hit last week.

TV streaming device maker Roku snapped a three-day winning streak after hitting a record high of $48.80, ending down 13.5 percent at $36.95.

Advance Auto Parts soared 16.3 percent to $95.72 after it affirmed its full-year profit forecast and beat quarterly profit estimates. [nL3N1NK52Q]

Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.47-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.23-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The S&P 500 posted 45 new 52-week highs and 11 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 64 new highs and 87 new lows.

About 6.73 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, roughly in line with the daily average over the last 20 sessions.

UPDATE 1-GE tumbles for a second day after announcing major overhaul - Reuters News

{{20171114T190533.539+0000}}UPDATE 1-GE tumbles for a second day after announcing major overhaul(Adds analyst's comment in the third last paragraph)

By Ankit Ajmera

Nov 14 (Reuters) - General Electric Co's shares slumped for a second straight day on Tuesday as investors wondered if a massive overhaul by new Chief Executive John Flannery to save billions and make the conglomerate smaller was enough to revive the 125-year-old Dow component.

GE's stock fell as much as 8.2 percent to $17.46. It was last down 5.3 percent in late afternoon trade, adding to its 7.2 percent drop on Monday, which set the shares up for their worst two-day losing streak since the financial crisis in 2009.

Flannery talked for two days about sweeping changes that will focus on three core businesses but instead it cut about $24 billion off GE's market capitalization.

Several brokerages lowered ratings and price targets on the stock, disappointed that GE's plan was not more aggressive.

Deutsche Bank analyst John Inch, who has a "sell" rating on GE with a price target of $18, said bulls had expected the company to move toward outright dismantlement of its portfolio, but GE stuck to the framework of divesting $20 billion in assets.

Inch said it seems unlikely GE can unlock associated value through "sum of the parts" as it keeps the bulk of its portfolio intact.

Analysts also said GE's move to cut its annual dividend to 48 cents from 96 cents was steeper than expected, putting more pressure on the stock.

"With more than 40 percent of GE's common equity owned by retail investors, we believe substantial near term selling pressure on GE could further ensue as retail investors who previously counted on the GE dividend look elsewhere," Inch said.

RBC Capital Markets analyst Andrew Krill downgraded the stock to "sector perform" from "outperform" and lowered the price target by $5 to $20.

Krill said the market was caught by surprise by the magnitude of the missteps and secular challenges at GE's power business, as well as the systemic cash flow shortfalls.

"Particularly damaging, in our view, was the admission that GE had been paying out a dividend above its industrial free cash flow for a number of years, and that GE Capital would not be paying a dividend to the parent in 2018."

J.P.Morgan analyst Stephen Tusa, who has an "underweight" rating on the stock with a price target of $17, said cost cut targets were not as ambitious as expected.

"Sell-side bulls may be scratching their heads over the lack of self-help options presented (by GE), though we think most are still not comprehending the fundamental challenges at hand," he said.

GE is aiming to reduce overhead costs by $2 billion next year, with half of that coming from its troubled power unit, which sells electrical generation equipment.

"The demise of General Electric over the past year has been dramatic, yet arguably unsurprising," said Jordan Hiscott, chief trader at London-based trading services provider Ayondo Markets.

Stocks favored by investors seeking yield, the so-called bond proxies, were the best performers as the yield curve, or the gap between short- and long-term U.S. government bond yields, remained near its flattest in a decade.

Utilities <.SPLRCU> and consumer staples <.SPLRCS>, sectors that pay relatively high dividends, were the best performers on the day. Utilities rose 1.2 percent for a 2.4 percent gain since Friday's close, the largest two-day percentage gain since late February.

He said the outperformance of stocks in the utilities and consumer staples sectors could also be due to investors getting more defensive "after growth sectors and the overall market have been doing so well this year."

The S&P 500 posted 45 new 52-week highs and 11 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 64 new highs and 87 new lows.

About 6.73 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, roughly in line with the daily average over the last 20 sessions.

UPDATE 1-GE tumbles for a second day after announcing major overhaul - Reuters News

{{20171114T190533.539+0000}}UPDATE 1-GE tumbles for a second day after announcing major overhaul(Adds analyst's comment in the third last paragraph)

By Ankit Ajmera

Nov 14 (Reuters) - General Electric Co's shares slumped for a second straight day on Tuesday as investors wondered if a massive overhaul by new Chief Executive John Flannery to save billions and make the conglomerate smaller was enough to revive the 125-year-old Dow component.

GE's stock fell as much as 8.2 percent to $17.46. It was last down 5.3 percent in late afternoon trade, adding to its 7.2 percent drop on Monday, which set the shares up for their worst two-day losing streak since the financial crisis in 2009.

Flannery talked for two days about sweeping changes that will focus on three core businesses but instead it cut about $24 billion off GE's market capitalization.

Several brokerages lowered ratings and price targets on the stock, disappointed that GE's plan was not more aggressive.

Deutsche Bank analyst John Inch, who has a "sell" rating on GE with a price target of $18, said bulls had expected the company to move toward outright dismantlement of its portfolio, but GE stuck to the framework of divesting $20 billion in assets.

Inch said it seems unlikely GE can unlock associated value through "sum of the parts" as it keeps the bulk of its portfolio intact.

Analysts also said GE's move to cut its annual dividend to 48 cents from 96 cents was steeper than expected, putting more pressure on the stock.

"With more than 40 percent of GE's common equity owned by retail investors, we believe substantial near term selling pressure on GE could further ensue as retail investors who previously counted on the GE dividend look elsewhere," Inch said.

RBC Capital Markets analyst Andrew Krill downgraded the stock to "sector perform" from "outperform" and lowered the price target by $5 to $20.

Krill said the market was caught by surprise by the magnitude of the missteps and secular challenges at GE's power business, as well as the systemic cash flow shortfalls.

"Particularly damaging, in our view, was the admission that GE had been paying out a dividend above its industrial free cash flow for a number of years, and that GE Capital would not be paying a dividend to the parent in 2018."

J.P.Morgan analyst Stephen Tusa, who has an "underweight" rating on the stock with a price target of $17, said cost cut targets were not as ambitious as expected.

"Sell-side bulls may be scratching their heads over the lack of self-help options presented (by GE), though we think most are still not comprehending the fundamental challenges at hand," he said.

GE is aiming to reduce overhead costs by $2 billion next year, with half of that coming from its troubled power unit, which sells electrical generation equipment.

"The demise of General Electric over the past year has been dramatic, yet arguably unsurprising," said Jordan Hiscott, chief trader at London-based trading services provider Ayondo Markets.

General Electric faces long road to pruning assets - Reuters News

{{20171113T234829.983+0000}}General Electric faces long road to pruning assetsBy Greg Roumeliotis

Nov 13 (Reuters) - General Electric Co CEO John Flannery faces a tight two-year race to shed more than $20 billion in assets through dozens of deals and pare down the U.S. industrial conglomerate into three core businesses: power, aviation and healthcare.

GE's assets could collectively be worth up to $30 per share, brokerages such as Melius Research LLC have suggested, even as its shares now hover around $19 after losing 40 percent of their value year-to-date. Successfully completing these divestitures would help narrow the valuation gap. [nL3N1NJ3GQ]

Shedding GE's unloved assets, however, will require a combination of M&A transactions and spinoffs that can be time-consuming and uncertain. For example, GE cannot spin off the most valuable of the assets it has earmarked for disposal, its 62.5 percent stake in oilfield services company Baker Hughes worth $23 billion, until July 2019, according to the terms of an agreement it has with that company.

"We wonder if GE may pursue a transaction similar to Synchrony Financial, where in 2014 GE IPOed about 15 percent of the business and 15 months later offered to exchange the company's remaining interest in Synchrony for GE stock," Cowen and Company analysts wrote in a note on Monday.

M&A negotiations also have their own challenges. For example, GE clinched a deal for its most recent divestiture, the sale of its industrial solutions business to ABB Ltd for $2.6 billion, in September, after announcing its intention to sell that business 10 months earlier. The deal talks were fraught with tension over price disagreements, sources said at the time. [nL8N1M60F5]

The Baker Hughes stake is excluded from Flannery's $20 billion-plus divestiture target. Among the GE assets that are included in this target, the biggest is its transportation business, which generated revenue of $4.7 billion in 2016 and could be worth between $8 billion and $10 billion. It manufactures freight and passenger trains, marine diesel engines and mining equipment, among other products.

That business could be sold to another company or a private equity firm, or be spun off. It could attract interest from major Western industry players such as Siemens AG and Alstom SA , which announced an agreement in September to merge their rail units, or Japanese or Chinese train manufacturers.

GE has already put up for sale its healthcare information technology business, which is worth between $2 billion and $3 billion and assists with electronic medical records, healthcare workforce management, and hospital revenue cycle management. Some of its better known brands include API Healthcare, which it acquired in 2014, and Centricity EMR.

That business is being marketed to private equity firms, and would likely have to be broken up into separate chunks in the event of a sale, sources have said. [nL2N1N11J1]

UPDATE 12-Shrinking GE rattles investors, shares hit 5-year low  - Reuters News

{{20171113T220113.239+0000}}UPDATE 12-Shrinking GE rattles investors, shares hit 5-year low * GE to focus on aviation, power, healthcare

* Cuts quarterly dividend in half to 12 cents/share

* Slashes 2018 profit outlook

* Shares drop 7 pct to more than 5-year low

(Adds investor comment)

By Alwyn Scott and Ankit Ajmera

Nov 13 (Reuters) - General Electric Co's new Chief Executive John Flannery on Monday outlined steps that will turn the biggest U.S. industrial conglomerate into a smaller, more focused company, surprising some investors who sold the company's shares to a five-year low.

Flannery's plan to shrink GE's multi-industry array of businesses was a reversal of the deal-driven empire building of his predecessors, Jeff Immelt and Jack Welch, and potentially a milestone in the decline of the conglomerate as a business strategy.

Other companies that once emulated the GE model of spreading bets among diverse industries are now unwinding their portfolios as well, something Immelt also did throughout his 16 years as CEO, even as he made acquisitions.

Flannery said he will pare GE down to three core businesses: power, aviation and healthcare. He will keep Immelt's strategy of building software to complement GE's machinery, albeit with a narrower focus and reduced budget.

For investors, Flannery's decision to cut both the dividend and the 2018 earnings forecast by half added up to a whole that was less than they judged GE be worth last week.

GE shares fell to their lowest level in more than five years as investors worried the years-long overhaul would not pare down enough expenses or generate as much cash as they hoped. They closed off the day's lows, down 7.2 percent to $19.02.

"They need to cut more cost," said Scott Davis, an analyst at Melius Research. "GE is still a bloated company with duplicate costs up and down the organization."

GE stock has effectively been dead money since September 2001, when Immelt took over, posting a negative total return even after reinvesting its juicy dividends. Once the most valuable U.S. publicly traded company, GE now has a market value of $168 billion, less than a fifth of Apple Inc .

"You have pessimism around its portfolio of businesses mixed with a pretty harsh cut in the dividend," said John Augustine, chief investment officer at Huntington Private Bank. "It took them years to get into this mess and it will take them several years to right the ship and get back into a stronger position."

'SOUL OF THE COMPANY'

Flannery, who took over as CEO on Aug. 1, said he was "looking for the soul of the company again" and would focus on "restoring the oxygen of cash and earnings to the company."

He will cut its board to 12 from 18 members, and bring on three new directors early next year.

GE said it already has shed 25 percent of its corporate staff, meaning 1,500 jobs around the world, including some at its Boston headquarters. It is aiming to reduce overhead cost by $2 billion next year, half of that at its troubled power unit that sells electrical generation equipment.

The transition includes GE getting rid of at least $20 billion of assets through sales, spin-offs or other means. GE will jettison businesses with "a very dispassionate eye," Flannery said, keeping only units that offer growth, a leading market position and a large installed base.

GE said it would exit its lighting, transportation, industrial solutions and electrical grid businesses, all of which were widely expected, closing factories around the globe. But it was vague about other disposals.

It plans to get rid of its 62.5-percent stake in oilfield services company Baker Hughes , only months after making the multi-billion dollar investment. Baker Hughes shares lost 3.2 percent.

Flannery offered no quick fixes for investors. He said power, one of the businesses GE would focus on, was "challenged," but could be turned around in one to two years.

GE's Digital unit, on which Immelt bet billions of dollars, would focus on selling apps to customers in its core businesses, Flannery said. He confirmed that the shift meant sales staff were being let go, as Reuters reported last week. [nL1N1NG1DJ]

GE also will cut spending on the digital unit to $1.1 billion in 2018 from $1.5 billion in 2017. GE had previously said it would invest $2.1 billion in its digital unit in 2017, but that tally included money not tied to Predix, GE's industrial-internet platform, GE said.

Flannery said there is "no retreat on the idea" of GE providing both applications and the Predix platform to connect industrial equipment to computers that can make machines run better. However, getting one of its key applications to run on Predix could take two more years.

Flannery added that some of its healthcare IT business, such as software for imaging and hospital staff scheduling, were still critical to the company and not likely to be divested.

DIVIDEND CUT

The dividend cut, to 48 cents from 96 cents next year, is only the third in the company's 125-year history and the first not during a broader financial crisis. It is expected to save about $4 billion in cash annually.

"This dividend cut will be a major disappointment to GE's (roughly 40 percent) retail shareholder base," said RBC Capital Markets analyst Deane Dray.

The cut will be the eighth-biggest dividend cut in history among S&P 500 companies, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst of S&P Dow Jones Indices. GE also had the biggest cut when it slashed its dividend by $8.87 billion in 2009, Silverblatt said.

GE forecast 2018 adjusted earnings of $1 to $1.07 a share, compared with its earlier estimate of $2 per share. Wall Street was expecting $1.16, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Industrial free cash flow will total just $6 billion to $7 billion next year, up from an estimated $3 billion in 2017, but far below earlier targets of $12 billion for 2017.

GE said the weak power business had largely prompted the dividend cut and lowered earnings forecast. Demand for new power plants will remain slow through 2019, Flannery predicted.

But GE also was to blame, he said.

"We did not manage the (power) business well," he said. "That's a fundamental change we need to make and that's going to take some time. This is not a magic wand."

NEW YORK, Nov 13 (Reuters) - U.S. stock indexes rose on Monday as a sharp drop in General Electric shares was more than offset by gains in high dividend-paying sectors including consumer staples and utilities.

General Electric slashed its dividend by 50 percent and cut its profit forecast while unveiling a plan that narrowed its focus on aviation, power and healthcare. [nL3N1NJ3GQ]

Shares of the industrial conglomerate fell 7.2 percent to $19.02 after touching a more than five-year low of $18.75.

"People who were in GE for their dividend may be looking for a better place to put their money," said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh.

Utilities <.SPLRCU> and consumer staples <.SPLRCS> rank among the sectors with the highest dividend yield on the S&P 500. They were also the largest percentage winning sectors on Monday.

Investors are closely tracking developments around the tax bill after U.S. Senate Republicans last week unveiled a new plan that differed from the House of Representatives' version.

Some relief for investors did come from the regulatory side, and shares of regional banks rose after the Wall Street Journal reported a bipartisan group of Senate lawmakers reached a tentative agreement to ease some regulations on the sector. [nL3N1NJ5LL]

The KBW Regional Banking Index <.KRX> gapped lower at the open but turned positive mid-session and ended up 1.3 percent after steadily climbing in afternoon trading.

Tyson Foods shares climbed 2.0 percent to $75.59 after the meat processor said low prices for livestock feed will help boost results again next year. Shares touched their highest since September 2016. [nL3N1NJ4MK]

Roku shares continued to rally, up 28.5 percent on Monday to $42.71, more than doubling since the company reported earnings last week. The stock debuted at $15.78 on Sept. 28 after having priced its initial public offering at $14.

Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.27-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.02-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The S&P 500 posted 40 new 52-week highs and nine new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 67 new highs and 81 new lows.

About 6.18 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, fewer than the 6.67 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.

BREAKINGVIEWS-GE's shaman exorcises ghosts of false expectations - Reuters Breakingviews

{{20171113T182802.110+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-GE's shaman exorcises ghosts of false expectations(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own. Updates to add details of board changes in fourth paragraph.)

By Rob Cox

NEW YORK, Nov 13 (Reuters Breakingviews) - It doesn't take much imagination at work to grasp the religious undertones in General Electric boss John Flannery's plan for the $178 billion conglomerate. He says he is "looking for the soul of the company again." Now, some 100 days into the job, Flannery has categorically exorcised the ghosts of false expectations past by halving its dividend, reducing earnings guidance and questioning entire swaths of the company's portfolio of industrial assets. Next up is GE's board of directors.

That Flannery is asking "why do we exist?" is not entirely surprising. He is, after all, a man with many years ahead of him to make some hard decisions, fundamentally reshape the company Thomas Edison founded and rebase its share price for the hard restructuring ahead. By contrast, his predecessor Jeff "Two Jets" Immelt was fighting for time, struggling to justify what was already done and had been previously promised during his 16 years running the company.

But the about-face from Immelt to Flannery has outdone the usual kitchen-sinking that accompanies the passing from one chief executive to the next. It's certainly a stark contrast from Immelt's own handover from Jack Welch in 2001. And that has raised a key question for GE shareholders: How did the board allow Immelt to continue for so long without intervention? If it was so obvious to Flannery and many investors that GE was overspending on dividends, flubbing on acquisitions and committing to too many second-rate businesses, what were GE's 18 directors thinking?

Flannery has already clarified that GE's board is oversized, under-engaged and badly in need of a house cleaning. So perhaps the most encouraging development to be found in Flannery's 57-page slideshow on Monday is a plan to put just 12 directors up for a vote next year, including three new ones. That means it is parting company with half the current lineup. GE will also create a new "finance and capital allocation committee" with increased oversight of the company's acquisition and buyback strategy.

The composition of the new board will include, among others, a representative of Trian Partners, the activist fund manager led by Nelson Peltz. But he can't be the only director willing to question the strategy, dig through the numbers and, where needed, prod Flannery to shift gears. The era of the all-powerful GE boss, with two jets at his disposal in case one breaks down, is over. That, beyond any numerical pledges, should be the most important statement to emerge on this investor day.

By Sinead Carew

NEW YORK, Nov 13 (Reuters) - World stock markets were down on Monday amid uncertainty over the fate of U.S. tax reform efforts, while Britain's pound fell on growing concerns about the future of Prime Minister Theresa May.

U.S. stock indexes made little ground, with some investors seeking bargains after a few days of losses while others were put off by a dividend cut from heavyweight General Electric .

Investors were waiting for any signs of compromise on U.S. tax policy after U.S. Senate Republicans on Thursday unveiled a plan that would cut corporate taxes a year later than a rival House of Representatives' bill. [nL1N1NI0B2]

"The only upside potential's going to come from tax reform. You come in and overnight and there's still no news," said Michael Antonelli, managing director, institutional sales trading at Robert W. Baird in Milwaukee. But he added:

"Pullbacks have been well protected. We sold off for three straight days. From the tone we've seen that tends to find buyers."

The Dow Jones Industrial Average <.DJI> rose 10 points, or 0.04 percent, to 23,432.21, the S&P 500 <.SPX> gained 0.41 points, or 0.02 percent, to 2,582.71 and the Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> added 3.07 points, or 0.05 percent, to 6,754.01.

The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index <.FTEU3> lost 0.47 percent and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe <.MIWD00000PUS> shed 0.30 percent and was on track for a third straight day of declines after hitting an intraday record high on Thursday.

Sterling was last down 6 percent against the dollar, on course for its biggest daily fall against the greenback since Nov. 2. It was also down 0.6 percent against the euro The Sunday Times newspaper reported that 40 members of parliament from May's Conservative Party agreed to sign a letter of no-confidence in her -- eight short of the number needed to trigger a party leadership contest. [nL8N1NH0TW]

"That just highlights some of the internal weakness that the Conservative party has within its own self and I think that's going to undermine the Brexit negotiations going forward," said Sireen Harajli, foreign exchange strategist at Mizuho in New York. [L8N1NJ5BU]

The dollar edged higher against a basket of other major currencies on Monday, recovering ground after logging a 0.6 percent decline last week. It <.DXY> rose 0.17 percent, with the euro down 0.05 percent to $1.1657.

U.S. Treasury two year note yields hit a fresh nine-year high as the yield curve resumed its flattening, with investors pricing in a U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate hike in December. The two-year yield hit a nine-year peak of 1.679 percent, up from 1.662 percent last Friday. [L1N1NJ0RR]

Oil prices were lower, with support from Middle East tensions and record long bets by fund managers countered by pressure from rising U.S. production. [nL3N1NJ1BB]

A purge of Saudi Arabia's leadership by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has raised concerns about political stability of the region's largest oil producer. [nL8N1NJ19L]

U.S. crude fell 0.49 percent to $56.46 per barrel and Brent was last at $62.84, down 1.07 percent on the day.

RPT-Membership revoked? Veteran GE's spot in exclusive Dow may be shaky - Reuters News

{{20171113T110001.578+0000}}RPT-Membership revoked? Veteran GE's spot in exclusive Dow may be shaky(Repeats story first published on Sunday)

By Lewis Krauskopf

NEW YORK, Nov 12 (Reuters) - It is hard to imagine the Dow Jones Industrial Average without General Electric Co . The U.S. industrial conglomerate's stock is the lone original component of the venerable blue-chip index that debuted in 1896.

But GE's dwindling share price and the likelihood that its new chief executive will dramatically slim down its sprawling operations is leading some index-watchers to consider the possibility of the company losing its membership in the elite 30-stock Dow <.DJI>.

"Since it is trading at a low share price and has a small weighting in the index, that does put it at an increased risk of getting removed," said Alex Bryan, director of passive strategies research at Morningstar in Chicago. "I don't think it's obvious that it is going to be removed from the index, but it certainly is at risk."

GE's shares last week closed under $20 for the first time in more than five years, its struggles made clear by a disappointing third-quarter earnings report last month. The stock closed at $20.49 on Friday, marking a 35 percent decline in 2017.

The stock price is now the lowest among Dow members. Because the Dow is a price-weighted index, unlike the benchmark S&P 500 <.SPX> which is influenced by the market values of its constituents, that means GE has the least impact on the Dow's daily swings.

As of Friday, GE's weight stood at only 0.6 percent. By comparison, aircraft maker Boeing Co , whose stock is above $260, has a 7.7 percent weight.

Changes to the Dow are made on an as-needed basis and selection is not governed by quantitative rules, according to published methodology for the index.

A spokesman for S&P Dow Jones Indices said the committee that oversees the Dow index meets regularly and that its discussions are confidential. GE declined to comment.

Ivan Cajic, vice president for index and ETF research for ITG, said if the Dow were to make a change in the near future, GE is the likeliest to be removed.

"I wouldn't be surprised if the company is safe for the time being and Dow Jones adopts a wait-and-see approach over the next few months to see how both the stock price and what the overall company looks like in the coming months," Cajic said.

SHRINKING COMPANY

GE's fate as a Dow component may become clearer on Monday when CEO John Flannery, who took the helm on Aug. 1, is expected to detail the businesses the company plans to exit as it seeks to revive its financial prospects. [nL1N1NE1IM]

If GE starts selling big parts of its operation, the committee overseeing the Dow "would give serious thought to whether or not the new GE, (excluding) those businesses, still represents as much a part of the economy as they once had," said Dave Nadig, CEO of ETF.com.

"If they continue to spin off and restructure businesses, they are going to just shrink," said Chuck Carlson, contributing editor to Dow Theory Forecasts newsletter. "That isn't necessarily the worst thing from a stock perspective, but they may start paring down to the point where the remaining businesses are similar to others that are in the Dow."

For now, GE still holds a major position in industries such as aviation, power and healthcare, and its market value of about $175 billion puts it in the middle of Dow components. Its historic place in the Dow may also be an argument for it to remain.

If GE is removed from the Dow, it may not spark much immediate selling of the stock. Only about $20 billion is invested in exchange traded funds tied to the Dow, the vast majority in the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust , much less than the $380 billion in ETFs tied to the S&P 500, according to Lipper data. But the indirect impact of GE losing its blue-chip status could weigh in the longer term.

TOO EXPENSIVE

It is not clear what company would replace GE in the Dow if it were kicked out. Three companies missing from the Dow with some of the largest market values - Amazon.com Inc , Google parent Alphabet Inc and Facebook Inc - have strikes against them.

Share prices of online retailer Amazon.com and internet company Alphabet exceed $1,000 so they would warp the price-weighted Dow. Social media company Facebook only went public in 2012, which some market-watchers say is too recent to join the Dow.

Industrial companies may find their applications denied. The sector represents about 22.5 percent of the Dow, which would be only marginally reduced by GE's departure. That level is more than twice the amount the sector represents in the S&P 500.

According to its published methodology, the Dow covers all industries except for transportation and utilities, which are covered by other Dow Jones indexes, and that "maintaining adequate sector representation within the indices is also a consideration in the selection process."

According to Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF and mutual fund research at CFRA: "There are sectors more under-represented than industrials within the index that could encourage a replacement from another group."

GE to focus on three key units, exit most other operations - WSJ - Reuters News

{{20171113T054138.554+0000}}GE to focus on three key units, exit most other operations - WSJNov 13 (Reuters) - General Electric Co's Chief Executive John Flannery plans to disclose a road map for the company on Monday that will focus on three of its biggest business lines - aviation, power and healthcare, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing a person familiar with the matter.

The report also says the plan stops short of a breakup or more radical restructuring of the 125-year-old company, but Flannery will look to exit most of its other operations. http://on.wsj.com/2jnKS2F

The Boston-based company also plans to shed its majority stake in Baker Hughes , which became a separate public company in July after merging with GE's oil and gas operations, the report said.

GE could not be reached for comment outside regular business hours.

GE was reported to be laying off sales staff and other employees in its software division, according to sources, last week, ahead of Flannery's expected announcement on Monday of a plan to slash costs and jettison units in an effort to improve the company's profits. [nL1N1NE1IM]

Membership revoked? Veteran GE's spot in exclusive Dow may be shaky - Reuters News

{{20171112T110001.609+0000}}Membership revoked? Veteran GE's spot in exclusive Dow may be shakyBy Lewis Krauskopf

NEW YORK, Nov 12 (Reuters) - It is hard to imagine the Dow Jones Industrial Average without General Electric Co . The U.S. industrial conglomerate's stock is the lone original component of the venerable blue-chip index that debuted in 1896.

But GE's dwindling share price and the likelihood that its new chief executive will dramatically slim down its sprawling operations is leading some index-watchers to consider the possibility of the company losing its membership in the elite 30-stock Dow <.DJI>.

"Since it is trading at a low share price and has a small weighting in the index, that does put it at an increased risk of getting removed," said Alex Bryan, director of passive strategies research at Morningstar in Chicago. "I don't think it's obvious that it is going to be removed from the index, but it certainly is at risk."

GE's shares last week closed under $20 for the first time in more than five years, its struggles made clear by a disappointing third-quarter earnings report last month. The stock closed at $20.49 on Friday, marking a 35 percent decline in 2017.

The stock price is now the lowest among Dow members. Because the Dow is a price-weighted index, unlike the benchmark S&P 500 <.SPX> which is influenced by the market values of its constituents, that means GE has the least impact on the Dow's daily swings.

As of Friday, GE's weight stood at only 0.6 percent. By comparison, aircraft maker Boeing Co , whose stock is above $260, has a 7.7 percent weight.

Changes to the Dow are made on an as-needed basis and selection is not governed by quantitative rules, according to published methodology for the index.

A spokesman for S&P Dow Jones Indices said the committee that oversees the Dow index meets regularly and that its discussions are confidential. GE declined to comment.

Ivan Cajic, vice president for index and ETF research for ITG, said if the Dow were to make a change in the near future, GE is the likeliest to be removed.

"I wouldn't be surprised if the company is safe for the time being and Dow Jones adopts a wait-and-see approach over the next few months to see how both the stock price and what the overall company looks like in the coming months," Cajic said.

SHRINKING COMPANY

GE's fate as a Dow component may become clearer on Monday when CEO John Flannery, who took the helm on Aug. 1, is expected to detail the businesses the company plans to exit as it seeks to revive its financial prospects. [nL1N1NE1IM]

If GE starts selling big parts of its operation, the committee overseeing the Dow "would give serious thought to whether or not the new GE, (excluding) those businesses, still represents as much a part of the economy as they once had," said Dave Nadig, CEO of ETF.com.

"If they continue to spin off and restructure businesses, they are going to just shrink," said Chuck Carlson, contributing editor to Dow Theory Forecasts newsletter. "That isn't necessarily the worst thing from a stock perspective, but they may start paring down to the point where the remaining businesses are similar to others that are in the Dow."

For now, GE still holds a major position in industries such as aviation, power and healthcare, and its market value of about $175 billion puts it in the middle of Dow components. Its historic place in the Dow may also be an argument for it to remain.

If GE is removed from the Dow, it may not spark much immediate selling of the stock. Only about $20 billion is invested in exchange traded funds tied to the Dow, the vast majority in the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust , much less than the $380 billion in ETFs tied to the S&P 500, according to Lipper data. But the indirect impact of GE losing its blue-chip status could weigh in the longer term.

TOO EXPENSIVE

It is not clear what company would replace GE in the Dow if it were kicked out. Three companies missing from the Dow with some of the largest market values - Amazon.com Inc , Google parent Alphabet Inc and Facebook Inc - have strikes against them.

Share prices of online retailer Amazon.com and internet company Alphabet exceed $1,000 so they would warp the price-weighted Dow. Social media company Facebook only went public in 2012, which some market-watchers say is too recent to join the Dow.

Industrial companies may find their applications denied. The sector represents about 22.5 percent of the Dow, which would be only marginally reduced by GE's departure. That level is more than twice the amount the sector represents in the S&P 500.

According to its published methodology, the Dow covers all industries except for transportation and utilities, which are covered by other Dow Jones indexes, and that "maintaining adequate sector representation within the indices is also a consideration in the selection process."

According to Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF and mutual fund research at CFRA: "There are sectors more under-represented than industrials within the index that could encourage a replacement from another group."

UPDATE 2-GE cutting staff ahead of new CEO's Monday overhaul -sources - Reuters News

{{20171110T212741.944+0000}}UPDATE 2-GE cutting staff ahead of new CEO's Monday overhaul -sources(Adds analyst comment, updates share price)

By Alwyn Scott

NEW YORK, Nov 10 (Reuters) - General Electric Co is laying off sales staff and other employees in its software division, according to people familiar with the matter, ahead of new Chief Executive John Flannery's expected announcement on Monday of a plan to slash costs and jettison units in an effort to improve the company's profits.

The layoffs at GE Digital, based in San Ramon, California, affect about 100 sales people in the Americas, including those who sell GE's Predix industrial-internet software, according to two sources.

The software, central to GE's strategy under former Chief Executive Jeff Immelt, has been beset with technical problems, prompting GE to shift strategy. [nL1N1KQ1UU]

The 125-year-old conglomerate is considering job reductions across all of its diverse businesses, the sources said. Struggling units such as GE Power are facing significant staff cuts, while aviation and healthcare businesses could see lesser reductions, the sources said.

Reuters reported in August that Flannery intended to reduce corporate staff at its Boston headquarters significantly, a process that has begun, according to sources. The company has also slowed construction of its headquarters. [nL2N1LG2NZ] [nL4N1KV5BS]

It is not clear how many more jobs Flannery now plans to cut, or how quickly. With 295,000 employees, even a 10 percent overall reduction would eliminate nearly 30,000 jobs.

At the digital business, which has about 13,000 people including legacy information technology staff, GE is not only cutting sales staff. It is also reducing the number of developers who create the software, according to the two sources, speaking on condition of anonymity.

Digital sales staff were given notice in recent days and told they could apply for about 19 remaining jobs in the division or other jobs at GE, the sources said.

GE declined to comment on specific staff reductions, but highlighted its plan to cut $3 billion in costs by the end of 2018. "Those actions include but are not limited to, employee reductions which have been well underway for many months," spokeswoman Jennifer Erickson said.

GE shares closed up 2.5 percent at $20.49.

DIVIDEND CUT COMING?

Analysts have slashed estimates for GE's 2018 earnings and expect a major restructuring plan on Monday as GE tries to pull out of a 16-year stock slump.

GE is likely to get much smaller and more focused, Jeff Sprague, an analyst at Vertical Research Partners, wrote on Friday. "It is also conceivable that looking out a few years, GE ceases to exist as we know it," he said, referring to a potential break-up.

"Staffing has to go down meaningfully," said a large Boston-based fund manager who invests in GE. The company spent billions on restructuring the last few years but without growth in operating profit, he added.

Since becoming CEO on Aug. 1, Flannery has doubled the amount of cost cutting targeted for next year to $2 billion, and is cutting $1 billion this year. He said he has found more than $20 billion in GE assets to sell and is looking at further changes to the portfolio beyond that.

A 30-year GE veteran, Flannery is due to present the strategic changes and new financial targets at an investor meeting in New York on Monday. The plans also could include cutting GE's dividend for only the third time in GE's history. The other two were during the Great Depression and the financial crisis.

Flannery has come under increasing pressure to boost GE's profit and share price after the company badly missed earnings expectations for the third quarter and lowered its financial outlook last month. [nL4N1MV3IM]

GE stock has fallen more than 36 percent this year, making it the worst performer in the Dow Jones Industrial Average and posing the risk that the only remaining original company in the widely watched stock index could be kicked out.

Activist investor Ed Garden, a founding partner at Trian Fund Management, recently joined GE's board. Trian invested $2.5 billion in GE in 2015 and pressed the company to cut costs and focus on sectors where it is a market leader, such as power plants, jet engines and medical devices. Trian declined to comment.

GE is considering divestment of its aircraft leasing, transportation and healthcare information technology businesses. The job reduction efforts in GE's units appear to be independent of those divestitures, the sources said. [nL2N1N11J1] [nL1N1NC1OM]

Flannery already has grounded GE's corporate jets, cut car bonuses for executives and dismissed two vice chairmen to save money.

In another sign of austerity, he shrunk the size of GE's annual leadership retreat in January and moved it from ritzy Boca Raton, Florida, to Boston.

U.S. drillers add the most oil rigs in a week since June -Baker Hughes - 路透新闻

{{20171110T180822.348+0000}}U.S. drillers add the most oil rigs in a week since June -Baker HughesNov 10 (Reuters) - U.S. energy companies added the most oil
drilling rigs in week since June as crude prices traded up to
their highest levels since the summer of 2015.

Drillers added nine oil rigs in the week to Nov. 10,
bringing the total count up to 738, General Electric Co's 
Baker Hughes energy services firm said in its closely followed
report on Friday.

The rig count, an early indicator of future output, is still
much higher than a year ago when only 452 rigs were active after
energy companies boosted spending plans for 2017 in the second
half of last year as crude started recovering from a two-year
price crash.

The increase in drilling lasted 14 months before stalling in
August, September and October after some producers started
trimming their 2017 spending plans when prices turned softer
over the summer.

The U.S. Energy Information Administration this week
slightly lowered its oil production growth forecast for 2017 to
a rise of 370,000 barrels per day from last month's expectations
of a 380,000 bpd increase. [EIA/M]

U.S. production, however, was expected to rise to 9.2
million bpd in 2017 and a record 10.0 million bpd in 2018 from
8.9 million bpd in 2016, the EIA said. Output peaked at 9.6
million bpd in 1970.

The largest U.S. independent oil and natural gas producer
ConocoPhillips  said this week it plans to spend an
average of $5.5 billion annually for the next three years as
long as oil prices stay above $50 per barrel. [nL1N1NE0ME]

U.S. crude futures  traded close to $58 a barrel this
week, their highest since July 2015. So far in 2017, crude
futures have averaged almost $50 a barrel, easily topping last
year's $43.47 average.

Looking ahead, futures were trading near $57 for the balance
of the year  and calendar 2018 .

Conoco's spending forecast, an increase from 2017 and higher
than many Wall Street analysts expected, comes as it, like some
peers, focuses more on generating profits rather than boosting
production at any cost.

Overall, exploration and production (E&P) companies expect
to increase spending on U.S. drilling and completions in 2017 by
about 53 percent over what they spent in 2016, according to U.S.
financial services firm Cowen & Co.

That expected 2017 spending increase followed an estimated
48 percent year-over-year decline in 2016 and a 34 percent
decline in 2015, Cowen said.

Cowen said nine of the 64 E&Ps they track have already
provided capital expenditure guidance for 2018 indicating a 16
percent increase in planned spending over 2017.

Analysts at Simmons & Co, energy specialists at U.S.
investment bank Piper Jaffray, this week revised downward their
forecast for the total oil and natural gas rig count to an
average of 872 in 2017, 910 in 2018 and 1,059 in 2019. Two weeks
ago, it forecast 874 in 2017, 923 in 2018 and 1,072 in 2019.

That compares with an average of 868 oil and gas rigs so far
in 2017, 509 in 2016 and 978 in 2015. Most rigs produce both oil
and gas.

With 907 total oil and gas rigs in operation now, that means
Simmons analysts expect the number of rigs to decline through
the balance of this year before rising next year.

REFILE-General Electric, China's Silk Road Fund to launch energy investment platform  - Reuters News

{{20171110T015434.835+0000}}REFILE-General Electric, China's Silk Road Fund to launch energy investment platform (Refiles to make clear that govt statement was dated Thursday)

SHANGHAI, Nov 10 (Reuters) - General Electric Co and a Chinese state fund set up for the Belt and Road trade initiative plan to jointly establish an energy infrastructure investment platform, China's government said.

The announcement came on the sidelines of a state visit to Beijing by U.S. President Donald Trump, who has been looking to rev up U.S.-China trade. [nL3N1NF3TJ]

The Silk Road Fund and GE Energy Financial Services signed a "cooperation" deal to set up the platform in Beijing, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) said in a statement dated Thursday and seen by Reuters on Friday.

"The two sides will jointly invest in electric power grids, new energy and oil and gas, in countries and regions along the Belt and Road," SAFE said. "The cooperation between the Silk Road Fund and GE will not only boost cooperation between high-end manufacturing industries from China and the U.S., but also promote economic and trade development in the regions where of investment," SAFE added.

The step was part of a flurry of deals between GE and Chinese companies. These included an engine and repair deal for GEnx-1B engines from Juneyao Airlines Co Ltd <603885.SS> worth $1.4 billion at list prices, and another $1.1 billion order for 80 Leap-1B engines to power 40 Boeing 737 MAX Aircraft from ICBC Leasing, the leasing arm of state bank Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Ltd <601398.SS>. [nL3N1NF2DG] The Silk Road Fund was set up at the end of 2014 and is backed by China's foreign exchange reserves, China Investment Corp, the Export-Import Bank of China and the China Development Bank.

GE to focus on three key units, exit most other operations - WSJ - Reuters News

{{20171113T054138.554+0000}}GE to focus on three key units, exit most other operations - WSJNov 13 (Reuters) - General Electric Co's Chief Executive John Flannery plans to disclose a road map for the company on Monday that will focus on three of its biggest business lines - aviation, power and healthcare, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing a person familiar with the matter.

The report also says the plan stops short of a breakup or more radical restructuring of the 125-year-old company, but Flannery will look to exit most of its other operations. http://on.wsj.com/2jnKS2F

The Boston-based company also plans to shed its majority stake in Baker Hughes , which became a separate public company in July after merging with GE's oil and gas operations, the report said.

GE could not be reached for comment outside regular business hours.

GE was reported to be laying off sales staff and other employees in its software division, according to sources, last week, ahead of Flannery's expected announcement on Monday of a plan to slash costs and jettison units in an effort to improve the company's profits. [nL1N1NE1IM]

Membership revoked? Veteran GE's spot in exclusive Dow may be shaky - Reuters News

{{20171112T110001.609+0000}}Membership revoked? Veteran GE's spot in exclusive Dow may be shakyBy Lewis Krauskopf

NEW YORK, Nov 12 (Reuters) - It is hard to imagine the Dow Jones Industrial Average without General Electric Co . The U.S. industrial conglomerate's stock is the lone original component of the venerable blue-chip index that debuted in 1896.

But GE's dwindling share price and the likelihood that its new chief executive will dramatically slim down its sprawling operations is leading some index-watchers to consider the possibility of the company losing its membership in the elite 30-stock Dow <.DJI>.

"Since it is trading at a low share price and has a small weighting in the index, that does put it at an increased risk of getting removed," said Alex Bryan, director of passive strategies research at Morningstar in Chicago. "I don't think it's obvious that it is going to be removed from the index, but it certainly is at risk."

GE's shares last week closed under $20 for the first time in more than five years, its struggles made clear by a disappointing third-quarter earnings report last month. The stock closed at $20.49 on Friday, marking a 35 percent decline in 2017.

The stock price is now the lowest among Dow members. Because the Dow is a price-weighted index, unlike the benchmark S&P 500 <.SPX> which is influenced by the market values of its constituents, that means GE has the least impact on the Dow's daily swings.

As of Friday, GE's weight stood at only 0.6 percent. By comparison, aircraft maker Boeing Co , whose stock is above $260, has a 7.7 percent weight.

Changes to the Dow are made on an as-needed basis and selection is not governed by quantitative rules, according to published methodology for the index.

A spokesman for S&P Dow Jones Indices said the committee that oversees the Dow index meets regularly and that its discussions are confidential. GE declined to comment.

Ivan Cajic, vice president for index and ETF research for ITG, said if the Dow were to make a change in the near future, GE is the likeliest to be removed.

"I wouldn't be surprised if the company is safe for the time being and Dow Jones adopts a wait-and-see approach over the next few months to see how both the stock price and what the overall company looks like in the coming months," Cajic said.

SHRINKING COMPANY

GE's fate as a Dow component may become clearer on Monday when CEO John Flannery, who took the helm on Aug. 1, is expected to detail the businesses the company plans to exit as it seeks to revive its financial prospects. [nL1N1NE1IM]

If GE starts selling big parts of its operation, the committee overseeing the Dow "would give serious thought to whether or not the new GE, (excluding) those businesses, still represents as much a part of the economy as they once had," said Dave Nadig, CEO of ETF.com.

"If they continue to spin off and restructure businesses, they are going to just shrink," said Chuck Carlson, contributing editor to Dow Theory Forecasts newsletter. "That isn't necessarily the worst thing from a stock perspective, but they may start paring down to the point where the remaining businesses are similar to others that are in the Dow."

For now, GE still holds a major position in industries such as aviation, power and healthcare, and its market value of about $175 billion puts it in the middle of Dow components. Its historic place in the Dow may also be an argument for it to remain.

If GE is removed from the Dow, it may not spark much immediate selling of the stock. Only about $20 billion is invested in exchange traded funds tied to the Dow, the vast majority in the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust , much less than the $380 billion in ETFs tied to the S&P 500, according to Lipper data. But the indirect impact of GE losing its blue-chip status could weigh in the longer term.

TOO EXPENSIVE

It is not clear what company would replace GE in the Dow if it were kicked out. Three companies missing from the Dow with some of the largest market values - Amazon.com Inc , Google parent Alphabet Inc and Facebook Inc - have strikes against them.

Share prices of online retailer Amazon.com and internet company Alphabet exceed $1,000 so they would warp the price-weighted Dow. Social media company Facebook only went public in 2012, which some market-watchers say is too recent to join the Dow.

Industrial companies may find their applications denied. The sector represents about 22.5 percent of the Dow, which would be only marginally reduced by GE's departure. That level is more than twice the amount the sector represents in the S&P 500.

According to its published methodology, the Dow covers all industries except for transportation and utilities, which are covered by other Dow Jones indexes, and that "maintaining adequate sector representation within the indices is also a consideration in the selection process."

According to Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF and mutual fund research at CFRA: "There are sectors more under-represented than industrials within the index that could encourage a replacement from another group."

UPDATE 2-GE cutting staff ahead of new CEO's Monday overhaul -sources - Reuters News

{{20171110T212741.944+0000}}UPDATE 2-GE cutting staff ahead of new CEO's Monday overhaul -sources(Adds analyst comment, updates share price)

By Alwyn Scott

NEW YORK, Nov 10 (Reuters) - General Electric Co is laying off sales staff and other employees in its software division, according to people familiar with the matter, ahead of new Chief Executive John Flannery's expected announcement on Monday of a plan to slash costs and jettison units in an effort to improve the company's profits.

The layoffs at GE Digital, based in San Ramon, California, affect about 100 sales people in the Americas, including those who sell GE's Predix industrial-internet software, according to two sources.

The software, central to GE's strategy under former Chief Executive Jeff Immelt, has been beset with technical problems, prompting GE to shift strategy. [nL1N1KQ1UU]

The 125-year-old conglomerate is considering job reductions across all of its diverse businesses, the sources said. Struggling units such as GE Power are facing significant staff cuts, while aviation and healthcare businesses could see lesser reductions, the sources said.

Reuters reported in August that Flannery intended to reduce corporate staff at its Boston headquarters significantly, a process that has begun, according to sources. The company has also slowed construction of its headquarters. [nL2N1LG2NZ] [nL4N1KV5BS]

It is not clear how many more jobs Flannery now plans to cut, or how quickly. With 295,000 employees, even a 10 percent overall reduction would eliminate nearly 30,000 jobs.

At the digital business, which has about 13,000 people including legacy information technology staff, GE is not only cutting sales staff. It is also reducing the number of developers who create the software, according to the two sources, speaking on condition of anonymity.

Digital sales staff were given notice in recent days and told they could apply for about 19 remaining jobs in the division or other jobs at GE, the sources said.

GE declined to comment on specific staff reductions, but highlighted its plan to cut $3 billion in costs by the end of 2018. "Those actions include but are not limited to, employee reductions which have been well underway for many months," spokeswoman Jennifer Erickson said.

GE shares closed up 2.5 percent at $20.49.

DIVIDEND CUT COMING?

Analysts have slashed estimates for GE's 2018 earnings and expect a major restructuring plan on Monday as GE tries to pull out of a 16-year stock slump.

GE is likely to get much smaller and more focused, Jeff Sprague, an analyst at Vertical Research Partners, wrote on Friday. "It is also conceivable that looking out a few years, GE ceases to exist as we know it," he said, referring to a potential break-up.

"Staffing has to go down meaningfully," said a large Boston-based fund manager who invests in GE. The company spent billions on restructuring the last few years but without growth in operating profit, he added.

Since becoming CEO on Aug. 1, Flannery has doubled the amount of cost cutting targeted for next year to $2 billion, and is cutting $1 billion this year. He said he has found more than $20 billion in GE assets to sell and is looking at further changes to the portfolio beyond that.

A 30-year GE veteran, Flannery is due to present the strategic changes and new financial targets at an investor meeting in New York on Monday. The plans also could include cutting GE's dividend for only the third time in GE's history. The other two were during the Great Depression and the financial crisis.

Flannery has come under increasing pressure to boost GE's profit and share price after the company badly missed earnings expectations for the third quarter and lowered its financial outlook last month. [nL4N1MV3IM]

GE stock has fallen more than 36 percent this year, making it the worst performer in the Dow Jones Industrial Average and posing the risk that the only remaining original company in the widely watched stock index could be kicked out.

Activist investor Ed Garden, a founding partner at Trian Fund Management, recently joined GE's board. Trian invested $2.5 billion in GE in 2015 and pressed the company to cut costs and focus on sectors where it is a market leader, such as power plants, jet engines and medical devices. Trian declined to comment.

GE is considering divestment of its aircraft leasing, transportation and healthcare information technology businesses. The job reduction efforts in GE's units appear to be independent of those divestitures, the sources said. [nL2N1N11J1] [nL1N1NC1OM]

Flannery already has grounded GE's corporate jets, cut car bonuses for executives and dismissed two vice chairmen to save money.

In another sign of austerity, he shrunk the size of GE's annual leadership retreat in January and moved it from ritzy Boca Raton, Florida, to Boston.

U.S. drillers add the most oil rigs in a week since June -Baker Hughes - 路透新闻

{{20171110T180822.348+0000}}U.S. drillers add the most oil rigs in a week since June -Baker HughesNov 10 (Reuters) - U.S. energy companies added the most oil
drilling rigs in week since June as crude prices traded up to
their highest levels since the summer of 2015.

Drillers added nine oil rigs in the week to Nov. 10,
bringing the total count up to 738, General Electric Co's 
Baker Hughes energy services firm said in its closely followed
report on Friday.

The rig count, an early indicator of future output, is still
much higher than a year ago when only 452 rigs were active after
energy companies boosted spending plans for 2017 in the second
half of last year as crude started recovering from a two-year
price crash.

The increase in drilling lasted 14 months before stalling in
August, September and October after some producers started
trimming their 2017 spending plans when prices turned softer
over the summer.

The U.S. Energy Information Administration this week
slightly lowered its oil production growth forecast for 2017 to
a rise of 370,000 barrels per day from last month's expectations
of a 380,000 bpd increase. [EIA/M]

U.S. production, however, was expected to rise to 9.2
million bpd in 2017 and a record 10.0 million bpd in 2018 from
8.9 million bpd in 2016, the EIA said. Output peaked at 9.6
million bpd in 1970.

The largest U.S. independent oil and natural gas producer
ConocoPhillips  said this week it plans to spend an
average of $5.5 billion annually for the next three years as
long as oil prices stay above $50 per barrel. [nL1N1NE0ME]

U.S. crude futures  traded close to $58 a barrel this
week, their highest since July 2015. So far in 2017, crude
futures have averaged almost $50 a barrel, easily topping last
year's $43.47 average.

Looking ahead, futures were trading near $57 for the balance
of the year  and calendar 2018 .

Conoco's spending forecast, an increase from 2017 and higher
than many Wall Street analysts expected, comes as it, like some
peers, focuses more on generating profits rather than boosting
production at any cost.

Overall, exploration and production (E&P) companies expect
to increase spending on U.S. drilling and completions in 2017 by
about 53 percent over what they spent in 2016, according to U.S.
financial services firm Cowen & Co.

That expected 2017 spending increase followed an estimated
48 percent year-over-year decline in 2016 and a 34 percent
decline in 2015, Cowen said.

Cowen said nine of the 64 E&Ps they track have already
provided capital expenditure guidance for 2018 indicating a 16
percent increase in planned spending over 2017.

Analysts at Simmons & Co, energy specialists at U.S.
investment bank Piper Jaffray, this week revised downward their
forecast for the total oil and natural gas rig count to an
average of 872 in 2017, 910 in 2018 and 1,059 in 2019. Two weeks
ago, it forecast 874 in 2017, 923 in 2018 and 1,072 in 2019.

That compares with an average of 868 oil and gas rigs so far
in 2017, 509 in 2016 and 978 in 2015. Most rigs produce both oil
and gas.

With 907 total oil and gas rigs in operation now, that means
Simmons analysts expect the number of rigs to decline through
the balance of this year before rising next year.

GE cutting staff ahead of new CEO's Monday overhaul -sources - Reuters News

{{20171110T174723.766+0000}}GE cutting staff ahead of new CEO's Monday overhaul -sourcesBy Alwyn Scott

NEW YORK, Nov 10 (Reuters) - General Electric Co is laying off sales staff and other employees in its software division, according to people familiar with the matter, ahead of new Chief Executive John Flannery's expected announcement on Monday of a plan to slash costs and jettison units in an effort to improve the company's profits.

The layoffs at GE Digital, based in San Ramon, California, affect about 100 sales people in the Americas, including those who sell GE's Predix industrial-internet software, according to two sources.

The software, central to GE's strategy under former Chief Executive Jeff Immelt, has been beset with technical problems, prompting GE to shift strategy. [nL1N1KQ1UU]

The 125-year-old conglomerate is considering job reductions across all of its diverse businesses, the sources said. Struggling units such as GE Power are facing significant staff cuts, while aviation and healthcare businesses could see lesser reductions, the sources said.

Reuters reported in August that Flannery intended to reduce corporate staff at its Boston headquarters significantly, reductions that also have begun, according to sources. The company has also slowed construction of its headquarters. [nL2N1LG2NZ] [nL4N1KV5BS]

It is not clear how many more jobs Flannery now plans to cut, or how quickly. With 295,000 employees, even a 10 percent overall reduction would eliminate nearly 30,000 jobs.

At the digital business, which has about 13,000 people including legacy information technology staff, GE is not only cutting sales staff. It is also reducing the number of developers who create the software, according to the two sources, speaking on condition of anonymity.

GE declined to comment on specific staff reductions, but highlighted its plan to cut $3 billion in costs by the end of 2018. "Those actions include but are not limited to, employee reductions which have been well underway for many months," spokeswoman Jennifer Erickson said.

DIVIDEND CUT COMING?

Since becoming CEO on Aug. 1, Flannery has doubled the amount of cost cutting targeted for next year to $2 billion, and is cutting $1 billion this year. He said he has found more than $20 billion in GE assets to sell and is looking at further changes to the portfolio beyond that.

A 30-year GE veteran, Flannery is due to present the strategic changes and new financial targets at an investor meeting in New York on Monday. The plans also could include cutting GE's dividend for only the third time since the Great Depression.

Flannery has come under increasing pressure to boost GE's profit and share price after the company badly missed earnings expectations for the third quarter and lowered its financial outlook last month. [nL4N1MV3IM]

GE stock has fallen more than 36 percent this year, making it the worst performer in the Dow Jones Industrial Average and posing the risk that the only remaining original company in the widely watched stock index could be kicked out.

Activist investor Ed Garden, a founding partner at Trian Fund Management, recently joined GE's board. Trian invested $2.5 billion in GE in 2015 and pressed the company to cut costs and focus on sectors where it is a market leader, such as power plants, jet engines and medical devices. Trian declined to comment.

GE is considering divestment of its aircraft leasing, transportation and healthcare information technology businesses. The job reduction efforts in GE's units appear to be independent of those divestitures, the sources said. [nL2N1N11J1] [nL1N1NC1OM]

Flannery already has grounded GE's corporate jets, cut car bonuses for executives and dismissed two vice chairmen to save money.

In another sign of austerity, he shrunk the size of GE's annual leadership retreat in January and moved it from ritzy Boca Raton, Florida, to Boston.

{{20171110T015434.835+0000}}REFILE-General Electric, China's Silk Road Fund to launch energy investment platform (Refiles to make clear that govt statement was dated Thursday)

SHANGHAI, Nov 10 (Reuters) - General Electric Co and a Chinese state fund set up for the Belt and Road trade initiative plan to jointly establish an energy infrastructure investment platform, China's government said.

The announcement came on the sidelines of a state visit to Beijing by U.S. President Donald Trump, who has been looking to rev up U.S.-China trade. [nL3N1NF3TJ]

The Silk Road Fund and GE Energy Financial Services signed a "cooperation" deal to set up the platform in Beijing, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) said in a statement dated Thursday and seen by Reuters on Friday.

"The two sides will jointly invest in electric power grids, new energy and oil and gas, in countries and regions along the Belt and Road," SAFE said. "The cooperation between the Silk Road Fund and GE will not only boost cooperation between high-end manufacturing industries from China and the U.S., but also promote economic and trade development in the regions where of investment," SAFE added.

The step was part of a flurry of deals between GE and Chinese companies. These included an engine and repair deal for GEnx-1B engines from Juneyao Airlines Co Ltd <603885.SS> worth $1.4 billion at list prices, and another $1.1 billion order for 80 Leap-1B engines to power 40 Boeing 737 MAX Aircraft from ICBC Leasing, the leasing arm of state bank Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Ltd <601398.SS>. [nL3N1NF2DG] The Silk Road Fund was set up at the end of 2014 and is backed by China's foreign exchange reserves, China Investment Corp, the Export-Import Bank of China and the China Development Bank.

EXCLUSIVE-General Electric explores options for aircraft leasing unit -sources - Reuters News

{{20171107T092638.880+0000}}EXCLUSIVE-General Electric explores options for aircraft leasing unit -sources* GE considering options following interest from some rivals

* GE CEO looking for new divestitures

* Asian rivals chipping away at market shares of top lessors

* Consolidation intensifies among global aircraft lessors

(Adds comment from Flightglobal analyst, sector background)

By Anshuman Daga and Greg Roumeliotis

SINGAPORE/NEW YORK, Nov 7 (Reuters) - General Electric Co is weighing options for its aircraft leasing operations, including the sale of all or part of the business, as Chief Executive John Flannery searches for new divestitures, according to people familiar with the matter.

GE's move on GE Capital Aviation Services (GECAS), the world's second-largest lessor, follows expressions of interest from some of its competitors, the sources said.

A spin-off of the business is also a possibility, the sources said, cautioning that GE may decide to keep the business.

The move comes at a time when a flood of Chinese funding is shaping the $260 billion-strong aircraft leasing industry as a significant new asset class.

GE declined to comment. The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential.

GECAS has a fleet of roughly 1,300 planes worth an estimated $25 billion, ranking behind only U.S.-listed AerCap Holdings NV , which is estimated to have a $30 billion portfolio, according to data from industry consultancy Ascend Flightglobal. AerCap has a market value of $8.3 billion.

Some 40 percent of the airline industry's aircraft is leased to avoid the fixed costs of owning planes.

Both GECAS and AerCap trace their roots to the collapsed (Guinness Peat Aviation) (GPA) leasing empire of Irish leasing baron, Tony Ryan, over two decades ago.

GE Capital bought $1.3 billion of prime GPA assets and struck a deal to manage most of the rest to form GECAS – coupling GPA's hardware with GE's balance sheet. The remaining core of old GPA was later acquired by AerCap, which is now the main competitor to GECAS.

RISE OF ASIAN LESSORS

Consolidation in the leasing sector has intensified in the last few years, as Asian competitors chip away at the market shares of GECAS and AerCap. GECAS has also been trimming its fleet in the last few years.

"I believe that GECAS sees opportunity in the market to sell aircraft with leases attached to new emerging lessors which allows them to generate profit on these specific transactions whilst also managing their asset and customer concentration risk," said Rob Morris, global head of consultancy at Ascend Flightglobal.

Avolon Holdings, owned by China's shipping-and-airline giant HNA Group, has vaulted to become the world's third biggest lessor after acquiring U.S. rival CIT Group Inc's plane leasing business this year.

Bank of China-owned Bank of China Aviation Ltd <2588.HK> and subsidiaries of Industrial and Commercial Bank of China <601398.SS>, China Development Bank and Bank of Communications <601328.SS> have emerged among the list of top 15 lessors after placing multi-billion dollar orders for Airbus and Boeing aircraft.

In June, GECAS struck a partnership with Caisse de Depot et Placement du Quebec, Canada's second largest pension fund, to create a new company focused on leasing high-tech, fuel-efficient narrow-body aircraft. [nL1N1JG15H]

Flannery has been looking for divestitures to meet his goal of identifying more than $20 billion worth of assets for GE. The company has also been exploring divesting its transportation and healthcare information technology businesses, sources said last month. [nL2N1N11J1]

GE is looking to bounce back after what Flannery said last month were horrible results in the third quarter. He has argued that GE's strong businesses are being held back by others that "drain investment and management resources without the prospect for a substantial reward".

Flannery is due to update GE shareholders on the company's strategy at an event on Nov. 13.

Siemens Gamesa to cut as many as 6,000 jobs - Reuters News

{{20171106T205314.468+0000}}Siemens Gamesa to cut as many as 6,000 jobsBERLIN, Nov 6 (Reuters) - Siemens Gamesa said on Monday it plans to cut as many as 6,000 jobs worldwide as it braces for sales to plunge by as much as a fifth next year.

The job cut would amount to more than 20 percent of the company's total workforce of around 26,000.

Wind turbine makers have been facing growing competition, putting pressure on pricing and inventory values and raising expectations for more takeovers to build scale. [nL8N1L84EM]

The Spanish-based wind power joint venture, which cut its earnings forecasts twice in recent months, has to date been planning to cut only 700 positions.

But the company said on Monday it expects sales to fall to between 9 and 9.6 billion euros this year from about 11 billion in fiscal 2017, a 5-percent gain from year-earlier levels.

Underlying EBIT declined almost a fifth to 774 million euros in fiscal 2017 ended Sept. 30, though plunged by nearly two thirds to 192 million euros in the six months since April, it said.

"Our financial performance is still not at the level we're all aiming for," chief executive Markus Tacke said.

Siemens merged its wind division with rival Gamesa this year following deals that saw Germany's Nordex buy the turbine unit of Spain's Acciona and General Electric take over Alstom Energy of France.

"We believe that the planned restructuring measures at Siemens Gamesa are necessary because the market and regulatory environments are changing structurally," a spokesman for Siemens said.

EXCLUSIVE-General Electric mulls options for aircraft leasing unit -sources - Reuters News

{{20171106T204224.717+0000}}EXCLUSIVE-General Electric mulls options for aircraft leasing unit -sourcesNov 6 (Reuters) - General Electric Co is exploring options for its aircraft leasing operations, including the sale of all or part of that business, as the company's new chief executive, John Flannery, searches for new divestitures, according to people familiar with the matter.

GE is considering options for GE Capital Aviation Services (GECAS), the world's second-largest lessor, following expressions of interest from some of its competitors, the sources said on Monday.

A spin-off of the business is also a possibility, the sources said, cautioning that GE may decide to keep the business.

The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. GE declined to comment.

UPDATE 1-Osram targets further profit, sales growth in 2018 - Reuters News

* Eyes 5.5-7.5 pct 2018 sales growth, 8 pct in 2017

(Adds company comment, detail and background)

BERLIN/FRANKFURT, Nov 6 (Reuters) - German lighting maker Osram expects further growth in profit and sales next year after posting 2017 results on Monday that matched expectations as it sold more automotive chips.

The Munich-based company, which competes with Philips Lighting and General Electric , plans to keep up investments and has teamed up with Continental to develop lighting products for the auto industry next year. [nL5N1NC5PD]

"The strategy is right," the Munich-based firm said late on Monday. "Osram will continue to grow in 2018 despite negative currency effects and investments."

Core earnings (adjusted EBITDA) at Osram rose more than six percent to 695 million euros ($807 million) on sales that rose eight percent to more than 4 billion euros, it said.

That gave it an EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) margin of 16.8 percent, adjusted for special items, compared with its forecast for a margin of 16.5 to 17.5 percent.

Osram said it is targeting adjusted EBITDA of around 700 million euros next year, forecasting sales to increase between 5.5 and 7.5 percent. It plans a dividend of 1.10 euros per share.

Osram had forecast comparable revenue growth of 7-9 percent for its fiscal year to end-September, diluted earnings per share of between 2.70 and 2.90 euros, and free cash flow at break-even level.

"We delivered another peak year in 2017 on the back of a strong performance whilst also making good progress on our way to becoming a high-tech company," Chief Executive Olaf Berlien said in a statement.

Analysts had forecast fourth-quarter revenue of 1.02 billion euros on average, adjusted EBITDA of 158 million euros, adjusted EBITA of 102 million euros and net income of 34 million euros, according to a Reuters poll. [nL8N1N887A]

Osram makes about 45 percent of its sales from specialty lighting (SL) which is mainly traditional LED, 35 percent from opto semiconductors (OS) which is mainly automotive, and 20 percent from lighting solutions and systems (LS) for buildings and streets.

Under Berlien, Osram has undertaken an ambitious project to build a billion-euro LED chip plant in Malaysia, which will cater mainly for the general street and building lighting market when it ramps up next year.

The move was controversial with shareholders who had hoped it would focus on the highly profitable automotive niche, and caused a cooling of relations with former parent Siemens until Siemens sold its stake last month.

Osram makes about half its revenues in U.S. dollars but most of its costs are in other currencies.

Philips Lighting, which unlike Osram still has a traditional bulbs business, reported flat core profit and a 4 percent decline in quarterly sales last month.

Its LED lights, professional lighting, and home networking divisions all grew on both top and bottom lines although the United States showed some weakness on slow demand from the housing industry and small and medium-sized businesses.

GE reported a 16 percent drop in lighting revenues but a turnaround to a small profit in the third quarter, with an operating margin of 4.8 percent, partly due to a running down of its traditional lighting business and a restructuring.

Lighting is seen as one of the businesses GE could sell after vowing to dispose of billions of dollars' worth of assets after poor quarterly results. ($1 = 0.8611 euros)

U.S. oil rig count falls by most in week since May 2016 -Baker Hughes - 路透新闻

{{20171103T170946.522+0000}}U.S. oil rig count falls by most in week since May 2016 -Baker HughesNov 3 (Reuters) - U.S. energy companies cut eight oil rigs
this week, the biggest reduction since May 2016, extending a
drilling decline that started over the summer when prices
slipped below $50 a barrel.

The oil rig count fell to 729 in the week to Nov. 3, the
lowest level since May, General Electric Co's  Baker
Hughes energy services firm said in its closely followed report
on Friday.

The rig count, an early indicator of future output, is still
much higher than a year ago when only 450 rigs were active after
energy companies boosted spending plans for 2017 in the second
half of last year as crude started recovering from a two-year
price crash.

The increase in drilling lasted 14 months before stalling in
August, September and October after some producers started
trimming spending plans when prices turned softer over the
summer.

U.S. oil production dipped to 9.2 million barrels per day
(bpd) in August, according to federal energy data released this
week. [EIA/PSM]

Overall, however, exploration and production (E&P) companies
expect to increase the amount of money they plan to spend on
U.S. drilling and completions in 2017 by about 53 percent over
2016, according to U.S. financial services firm Cowen & Co. That
was up from 50 percent in the firm's prior capital expenditure
tracking report last week.

That expected 2017 spending increase followed an estimated
48 percent decline in 2016 and a 34 percent decline in 2015,
Cowen said.

U.S. crude futures , which reached a high of $55.22 a
barrel this week, which put them within a few cents of their
highest since July 2015, have averaged almost $50 a barrel so
far in 2017, easily topping last year's $43.47 average.

Looking ahead, futures were trading around $55 for the
balance of the year  and calendar 2018 .

Cowen, which has its own U.S. rig count, said it expects a
gradual decline in rigs in the fourth quarter of 2017 and in
2018.

There were 898 oil and natural gas rigs active on Nov. 3.
The average number of rigs in service so far in 2017 was 868.
That compares with 509 in 2016 and 978 in 2015. Most rigs
produce both oil and gas.

CORRECTED (OFFICIAL)-Investors parse impacts on multinationals from House tax bill - Reuters News

{{20171103T161035.344+0000}}CORRECTED (OFFICIAL)-Investors parse impacts on multinationals from House tax bill(In Thursday story, company corrects name of fund in 4th graph)

By David Randall and Noel Randewich

NEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO, Nov 2 (Reuters) - A U.S. Republican tax bill unveiled on Thursday offers big multinational companies more benefits than minuses, and could free up extra cash for investments, dividends or improving balance sheets.

The measure, which faces a long road ahead with final approval by Congress uncertain, would slash the corporate tax rate, a change U.S. companies have been seeking for years.

But it might hamper some highly leveraged companies' ability to deduct debt interest. It could also strip some tax breaks from sectors such as energy and pharmaceuticals.

"This bill would give most companies a lot to cheer about, but we're getting a muted reaction in the market because there will be a lot of pushback" from companies that could lose some of their tax breaks, said Pete Santoro, a portfolio manager of the $3.8 billion Columbia Dividend Income fund.

The 429-page tax bill would be the largest overhaul of the U.S. tax system since the 1980s. It would cut the corporate rate to 20 percent from 35 percent, reduce tax rates on individuals and end certain popular tax breaks, including deductions for state and local taxes and half the interest deduction on new mortgages.

It would also create a new 10 percent tax on U.S. companies' foreign subsidiaries and impose a 20 percent tax on payments that foreign businesses operating in the United States make from their American operations.

President Donald Trump told House Republicans he hoped to sign the bill into law by Nov. 23. Such a move would stand as the Trump administration's first major legislative victory.

The overall market reaction to the bill was mixed, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average rising 0.3 percent while the broader S&P 500 index was flat.

Despite the uncertainty, investors and analysts looked for those companies that would see the largest impact if the bill was approved. Chief among them: companies such as General Electric Co , which has more than $10 billion in foreign assets such as property and equipment that would be subject to a one-time tax of 5 percent, totaling $2.1 billion, according to Morgan Stanley.

Shares of General Electric fell nearly 1 percent on Thursday, continuing a nearly 20 percent decline over the last month spurred by analyst downgrades and fears that the company may cut its dividend. GE did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Renewable energy companies and pharmaceutical companies that receive tax credits for clinical testing expenses for certain drugs would also face increased costs if the Republican bill passes, said Brian Jacobsen, chief portfolio strategist at Wells Fargo Funds Management. Yet the removal of those tax breaks makes it less likely the bill will pass, he added.

"What makes this tax reform rather than just tax cuts is that they're taking on a lot of provisions that target specific industries. That's why, while taxes are hard, tax reform is harder," he said.

Among potential winners are technology companies such as Apple Inc , Microsoft Corp and Cisco Systems , which hold more than 10 percent of their market values in cash abroad, said Rob Martin, an economist at UBS.

A 12 percent tax bill - versus 35 percent now - on repatriated profits is "higher than some companies hoped for but low enough that I think they'll be happy," he said.

Investors expect the specifics of the bill to change as corporations lobby to keep or insert favorable tax breaks.

"In its current form there is a zero percent chance that this passes," said Linda Bakhshian, a co-portfolio manager of the $1.2 billion Federated Equity Income fund .

UPDATE 2-Wind turbine makers say U.S. tax proposal puts investment at risk - Reuters News

By Stine Jacobsen and Christoph Steitz

COPENHAGEN/FRANKFURT, Nov 3 (Reuters) - The world's largest wind turbine makers said a proposed Republican tax bill that would cut support for the industry in the U.S. would put its businesses and future investment at risk, in a rare public criticism on Friday of government proposals.

Equipment makers operating in the world's second-largest wind turbine market have relied upon so-called production tax credits (PTC) agreed in 2015. In a new tax bill, unveiled late on Thursday, the PTC would be cut to 1.5 dollar cents per kilowatt hour (kWh) from 2.4 cents. [nL2N1N81U1]

Shares in Denmark's Vestas , the world's largest maker of wind turbines fell as much as 12 percent on Friday, due to its large exposure to the U.S. market, where it overtook GE last year in installed capacity. [nL5N1FV2TV]

Shares in Siemens Gamesa and Germany's Nordex , which also operate in the U.S. along with General Electric , were all down.

"Siemens Gamesa is disappointed in this step backwards. Our company is committed to this market and continues to invest in factories. A tax policy that has certainty is required for investment," the group said in an e-mailed statement.

Vestas said the proposal was "disappointing". GE said the group was carefully reviewing the details of the bill, which could still face changes as it needs to pass both the House of Representatives and the Senate.

SUPPORT WANES

The tax credit scheme was considered critical to enabling wind projects to compete with fossil fuel plants and the wind energy industry has said the proposed cuts put $50 billion in planned investment at risk.[nL2N1N8251]

The planned legislative step comes after long-standing industry concerns that Trump might curb support for renewable energy to promote coal and other fossil fuels instead.

"Even though Mr. Trump and team are not necessarily known for their adherence to the 'usual', we feel they are unlikely to be unaware of the wide-ranging consequences ... of the government essentially breaking open private contracts," Barclays wrote.

"After all, what would there be to stop them from retroactively doing so elsewhere too?"

Analysts at Goldman Sachs reckon that in this bear case scenario wind capacity expansion in the United States could fall sharply to a combined 10 gigawatts (GW) in 2019 and 2020, less than half the 26 GW it expects under its base case model.

The brokerage expects another consequence of the proposed PCT cut to be a fall in 2019 core earnings (EBITDA) at Vestas and Nordex of about 18 percent and 10 percent for Siemens Gamesa, whose market share has fallen in recent years. [nL8N1N74B7]

Shareholder sues GE after 'unacceptable' results hurt stock - Reuters News

{{20171102T164255.688+0000}}Shareholder sues GE after 'unacceptable' results hurt stockBy Jonathan Stempel

NEW YORK, Nov 2 (Reuters) - Two weeks after General Electric Co's new chief executive vowed to shed $20 billion of assets, a shareholder has sued the company for failing to divulge its problems sooner and posting quarterly results that were "unacceptable, to say the least."

In a proposed class-action lawsuit filed Wednesday night in the U.S. District Court in Manhattan, Jihad Hachem accused GE of securities fraud for concealing how falling demand, excess inventory and higher costs would cause it fall far short of its 2017 profit forecast, and led to an inflated stock price.

GE's market value slid $11 billion in the two trading days after the Boston-based company on Oct. 20 reported a third-quarter profit of 29 cents per share, below the 49 cents expected by analysts, and cut its 2017 profit forecast by one-third. [nL4N1MV3IM]

Several analysts shortly thereafter cut their ratings or share price targets for GE.

Other defendants include Chief Executive John Flannery, his predecessor Jeffrey Immelt, and former Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey Bornstein, who left that position this week.

"The complaint appears to focus on projections conveyed during earnings calls, which by definition, were forward-looking statements," GE spokeswoman Jennifer Friedman said in an email. "We intend to vigorously defend against these claims."

Shareholders have long been frustrated by GE, a maker of power plants, jet engines, medical devices and other industrial equipment and a member of the Dow Jones Industrial Average <.DJI>.

Through Wednesday, GE's share price had fallen 51 percent in the 16 years since Jack Welch, who oversaw much of its growth, passed the CEO baton to Immelt. Investors who reinvested dividends suffered a roughly 19 percent negative total return.

In contrast, the Standard & Poor's 500 <.SPX> rose about 133 percent over that time period.

Though Immelt had shed some units, Flannery said GE must now focus on its more promising businesses, and hold managers accountable for poor performance.

Flannery, a 30-year GE veteran who took over on Aug. 1, has made some early, symbolic cuts, including executive perks and the use of corporate jets.

In his complaint, Hachem accused the defendants of having from July 21 to Oct. 20, made materially false and misleading statements about its business in public statements and filings, and knew that doing so would mislead investors.

Hachem is represented by the law firms Glancy Prongay & Murray and Kirby McInerney and is seeking unspecified damages.

Securities fraud class actions have become more plentiful in federal courts after recent rulings in Delaware state courts dissuaded some plaintiffs from suing there.

Cornerstone Research said 226 such class actions were filed from January to June - the most since it began tracking filings in 1996. Most involve smaller declines in market value and less familiar companies than GE.

The case is Hachem v General Electric Inc et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 17-08457.

Siemens Gamesa needs more wind in its sails as Vestas stretches U.S. lead - Reuters News

{{20171101T164106.591+0000}}Siemens Gamesa needs more wind in its sails as Vestas stretches U.S. lead* Siemens Gamesa has 974 MW of orders vs 2,086 MW for Vestas

* Vestas shares up 25 pct in 2017, Siemens Gamesa down 30 pct

* GRAPHIC-U.S. wind turbine market: http://tmsnrt.rs/2yOXiXJ

By Christoph Steitz and Jose Elías Rodríguez

FRANKFURT/MADRID, Nov 1 (Reuters) - Siemens Gamesa has fallen behind biggest rival Vestas in the race for orders in the United States, hurt by a perceived lack of technology investment and a less centralised supply chain in the world's second-biggest wind turbine market.

The U.S. battleground is among the biggest for western turbine manufacturers, with the U.S. Energy Information Administration forecasting the addition of 6 gigawatts (GW) of capacity this year and a further 8 GW in 2018.

But things have not gone well for Siemens Gamesa since the merger that brought together Siemens' wind power division with rival Gamesa this year, even though it has described the United States as critical to its success.

The merger was aimed at giving the combined entity an edge in an increasingly competitive global market amid sector consolidation that saw Germany's Nordex buy the turbine unit of Spain's Acciona and General Electric take over France's Alstom.

"Siemens Gamesa has struggled to bring an attractive turbine to North America," said one senior industry adviser who declined to be named to protect business relations.

There is a view that the company has not done enough to improve its geared turbines, the adviser added.

Siemens has mainly sold gearbox-based turbines in the United States, where they are the preferred model, but its market share has dwindled in recent years while that of Vestas has increased steadily.

TURBINE SWITCH?

Complementing its portfolio and recouping lost market share in the United States were among the main drivers of the tie-up with Gamesa, which has a broader offering of gearbox-based turbines and is expected to fare better locally.

Siemens Gamesa will present its new strategy in February and sources close to the group said chances are that the joint venture may use more of Gamesa's turbines in the United States in future.

"After the merger the combined company has greater scale in the U.S., which will enable us to increase the wind turbine models and the volumes produced in the country," Siemens Gamesa said in an e-mailed statement.

Improvement is badly needed after the group announced the closure of its blade production operation in Canada, job cuts at its nacelle manufacturing plant in Kansas and writedowns on the U.S. business that caused a profit warning and management reshuffle. [nL8N1MR1LJ] [nL8N1MV4D9]

Siemens Gamesa did end a losing streak this week when it reported U.S. orders for 784 megawatts (MW) of capacity. It has also won an upgrade contract it says is worth 190 MW. [nFWN1N60CD]

But that is still less than half of what has been taken in by Vestas. The Danish company's order book is brimming with 2,086 MW in announced U.S. deals, close to a third of its total orders globally.

Fresh data from the American Wind Energy Association (AWEA) also shows that Vestas is much more successful than Siemens Gamesa in striking deals for projects. The association's latest quarterly market report said Vestas has taken 47 percent of the U.S. wind projects under construction or in advanced development that have announced a supplier.

Siemens Gamesa's share stood at 8 percent, or 1,258 MW, at the end of the third quarter.

'PEDESTRIAN' OUTLOOK

"The need to catch up will keep a lid on stock momentum for at least another couple of quarters," Barclays analysts said, forecasting a "pedestrian" outlook for 2018, which they expect to be issued along with fourth-quarter results on Nov. 6.

Barclays expects next year's sales to be down by more than a fifth from its forecast for 2017 numbers. The analysts are forecasting sales of 8.48 billion euros ($9.88 billion) in 2018, well below the 10.14 billion Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S estimate.

In the medium term, the merger is expected to help Siemens Gamesa to gain a stronger foothold in the United States and recover some of this year's 30 percent lost market value -- a far cry from the 25 percent gain for shares in Vestas.

Regardless of the actual products, Siemens Gamesa must also find a way to compete with the centralised supply chain that Vestas has built in the United States.

Vestas operates four factories making towers, blades and nacelles in the state of Colorado, located in the middle of the windy central plains corridor of the United States, which analysts say is a big advantage.

"We think the key is localising the product," said Chris Brown, president of Vestas's sales and service division in the United States and Canada.

Siemens Gamesa also has a strong presence in the region, with blade and nacelle production in Iowa and Kansas, though it does not identify the local providers from which it sources its towers. In the past it has bought towers from Broadwind Energy , which has production sites in Wisconsin and Texas.

"In a cut-throat competitive turbine pricing environment, the additional costs of transport can win or lose contracts," said Jesse Broehl, senior analyst at Navigant Research. ($1 = 0.8584 euros)

Complementing its portfolio and recouping lost market share in the United States were among the main drivers of the tie-up with Gamesa, which has a broader offering of gearbox-based turbines and is expected to fare better locally.

Siemens Gamesa will present its new strategy in February and sources close to the group said chances are that the joint venture may use more of Gamesa's turbines in the United States in future.

"After the merger the combined company has greater scale in the U.S., which will enable us to increase the wind turbine models and the volumes produced in the country," Siemens Gamesa said in an e-mailed statement.

Improvement is badly needed after the group announced the closure of its blade production operation in Canada, job cuts at its nacelle manufacturing plant in Kansas and writedowns on the U.S. business that caused a profit warning and management reshuffle. [nL8N1MR1LJ] [nL8N1MV4D9]

Siemens Gamesa did end a losing streak this week when it reported U.S. orders for 784 megawatts (MW) of capacity. It has also won an upgrade contract it says is worth 190 MW. [nFWN1N60CD]

But that is still less than half of what has been taken in by Vestas. The Danish company's order book is brimming with 2,086 MW in announced U.S. deals, close to a third of its total orders globally.

Fresh data from the American Wind Energy Association (AWEA) also shows that Vestas is much more successful than Siemens Gamesa in striking deals for projects. The association's latest quarterly market report said Vestas has taken 47 percent of the U.S. wind projects under construction or in advanced development that have announced a supplier.

Siemens Gamesa's share stood at 8 percent, or 1,258 MW, at the end of the third quarter.

'PEDESTRIAN' OUTLOOK

"The need to catch up will keep a lid on stock momentum for at least another couple of quarters," Barclays analysts said, forecasting a "pedestrian" outlook for 2018, which they expect to be issued along with fourth-quarter results on Nov. 6.

Barclays expects next year's sales to be down by more than a fifth from its forecast for 2017 numbers. The analysts are forecasting sales of 8.48 billion euros ($9.88 billion) in 2018, well below the 10.14 billion Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S estimate.

In the medium term, the merger is expected to help Siemens Gamesa to gain a stronger foothold in the United States and recover some of this year's 30 percent lost market value -- a far cry from the 25 percent gain for shares in Vestas.

Regardless of the actual products, Siemens Gamesa must also find a way to compete with the centralised supply chain that Vestas has built in the United States.

Vestas operates four factories making towers, blades and nacelles in the state of Colorado, located in the middle of the windy central plains corridor of the United States, which analysts say is a big advantage.

"We think the key is localising the product," said Chris Brown, president of Vestas's sales and service division in the United States and Canada.

Siemens Gamesa also has a strong presence in the region, with blade and nacelle production in Iowa and Kansas, though it does not identify the local providers from which it sources its towers. In the past it has bought towers from Broadwind Energy , which has production sites in Wisconsin and Texas.

"In a cut-throat competitive turbine pricing environment, the additional costs of transport can win or lose contracts," said Jesse Broehl, senior analyst at Navigant Research. ($1 = 0.8584 euros)

BREAKINGVIEWS-Wall Street loses in search for easy China wins - Reuters Breakingviews

{{20171101T035029.266+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-Wall Street loses in search for easy China wins(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are her own.) (Refiles to fix punctuation in third, fifth and sixth paragraphs, and to fix mispelling of "Cheniere Energy" in third paragraph.)

By Gina Chon

WASHINGTON, Nov 1 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Finance services firms look sidelined as the White House focuses on finding easy China wins. Energy and industrial companies like General Electric will have a chance to cozy up to Beijing's new leadership during U.S. President Donald Trump's upcoming Asia trip, but Wall Street isn't coming along. The U.S. business delegation's composition reflects Trump's desires to find low-hanging fruit deals to tout domestically, but low expectations for deeper concessions.

Trump arrives in Beijing next Wednesday, and the administration has been on the hunt for announcements that would make for photo ops or press releases during his visit. Companies applying to join a business delegation were queried on whether they had deals with China in the works that they could unveil while overseas, people familiar with the matter told Breakingviews. Billions of dollars in sales and investments benefitting the United States are expected. For example, one of the stars of the show will probably be Sinopec's <0386.HK> <600028.SS> 700-mile pipeline deal in Texas and the U.S. Virgin Islands, which could be worth about $7 billion in investments.

U.S. corporate delegates include GE, Honeywell , Thermo Fisher and Cheniere Energy . They arrive at an opportune time to meet Chinese leaders, who just wrapped up a major party congress and rolled out new leadership slate at the end of October.

However, the United States remains locked in contentious talks over improving market access for American firms in the People's Republic, including financial services. A senior administration official said Tuesday that progress has become more difficult. China is retrenching under President Xi Jinping, who has shown scant respect for market-based principles.

While there have been some advances on raising ownership equity caps in financial services, a deal has not been finalized, and the lack of representation by big names like Citi or Goldman Sachs on this trip suggests no major compromise is nigh. William Zarit, chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, said he hoped the one-off deals don't overshadow the need to push for structural changes.

Convincing Beijing to expose its domestic financial industry to more foreign competition is a tougher pitch than selling goods. The Trump administration is not indifferent to the financial sector's concerns, but low expectations for photo-op concessions have kept the industry at the back of the line this time around.

CONTEXT NEWS

- U.S. President Donald Trump will begin his 12-day Asia trip on Nov. 3, with scheduled stops in Japan, South Korea, China, Vietnam, and the Philippines. North Korea and economic relations are expected to be the main topics of discussion during the visit.

- Among the companies listed as participating in the delegation to China are General Electric, Honeywell, Thermo Fisher and Cherniere Energy. The Trump administration also hopes to announce a 700-mile pipeline deal with China Petroleum & Chemical Corp., known as Sinopec, in Texas and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The firm is expected to partner with Massachusetts-based ArcLight Capital and Connecticut-based Freepoint Commodities.

GUIDE TO EU MERGER PROCESS

DEADLINES:

The European Commission has 25 working days after a deal is filed for a first-stage review. It may extend that by 10 working days to 35 working days, to consider either a company's proposed remedies or an EU member state's request to handle the case.

Most mergers win approval but occasionally the Commission opens a detailed second-stage investigation for up to 90 additional working days, which it may extend to 105 working days.

SIMPLIFIED:

Under the simplified procedure, the Commission announces the clearance of uncontroversial first-stage mergers without giving any reason for its decision. Cases may be reclassified as non-simplified - that is, ordinary first-stage reviews - until they are approved.
