By David Ljunggren

OTTAWA, Sept 6 (Reuters) - Canada, embroiled in a dispute with Boeing Co over the planned purchase of 18 new Super Hornet fighters, could buy older jets from Australia instead, the defense ministry said on Wednesday.

The Liberal government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau suspended talks with Boeing over a possible acquisition after the U.S. firm launched a trade challenge against Canadian planemaker Bombardier Inc . [nL1N1IY1KC]

Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan says Canada needs the 18 jets as a stopgap measure until it can run a competition to replace its CF-18 fighters. The CF-18 is Canada's version of the F-18, a design that is 40 years old.

"In light of Australia recently notifying all allies about their intent to dispose of their F-18 fleet, Canada visited them to inquire about the state of their equipment and spare parts," Sajjan's office said in a statement.

"It is too early to provide detailed information about other options," it added.

Boeing declined to comment. The Australian High Commission (embassy) did not reply to a request for comment.

Sajjan spokeswoman Jordan Owens said Canada had not visited other nations to assess their planes.

Trudeau on Tuesday slammed Boeing's "unfair and aggressive" challenge against Bombardier, which the U.S. firm alleges is dumping passenger planes in the American market. [nL2N1LM285]

Boeing's Canadian network of aerospace suppliers on Tuesday urged Trudeau to buy the Super Hornets, noting the firm supported more than 17,000 jobs in Canada.

"Our partnership is deep and enduring, but it needs your engagement," said a letter from 10 firms, a copy of which was seen by Reuters.

Signatories included CAE Inc , Heroux Devtek Inc and Honeywell International Inc. as well as the Canadian arms of General Electric Co and Raytheon Co .

CAE, which has close ties to Bombardier, later noted the letter had not mentioned the Boeing dispute.

Asked for a reaction to the letter, a source familiar with government thinking said the Canadian aerospace sector supported many jobs in the United States.

Australia bought 24 Super Hornets as an interim fleet until it could take delivery of F-35 planes from Lockheed Martin Corp .

Canada's former Conservative government said in 2010 it would buy 65 F-35s but later scrapped the decision, triggering years of delays and reviews.

Ahead of the 2015 election that brought him to power, Trudeau campaigned against buying the F-35 on the grounds it was too expensive. Officials now say the plane would be eligible to participate in the competition. [nL1N1E7170]

ABB plans expansion in U.S., scouting for acquisitions, CEO says - Reuters News

{{20170906T205431.682+0000}}ABB plans expansion in U.S., scouting for acquisitions, CEO saysBy Joseph White

DETROIT, Sept 6 (Reuters) - ABB Ltd plans to expand its U.S. industrial robot factory in Michigan, the company's chief executive officer said on Wednesday, while declining to comment on reports that he is weighing the purchase of a unit of rival General Electric Co .

Ulrich Spiesshofer, who took over as CEO of ABB in 2013, said in an interview that the company plans to expand its industrial robot manufacturing facility in Auburn Hills, Michigan, which delivered its first robot in March. He declined to offer details on new jobs or investment. ABB currently has a workforce of about 1,000 at the Auburn Hills complex.

Zurich-based ABB is counting on continued growth in demand for industrial robots from automakers and other sectors, such as the food and beverage industry, Spiesshofer said.

U.S. automakers have caught up with Japanese and German rivals in the level of factory automation, Spiesshofer said. "The next phase is about portfolio differentiation and expansion," as automakers build more electric cars, he said.

Spiesshofer has been reshaping ABB's portfolio of businesses through acquisitions and divestitures for the past four years. He declined to comment on whether he is discussing the acquisition of GE's industrial solutions business.

People familiar with the situation said last month that GE and ABB had restarted talks after GE cut the asking price of the business, which sells industrial electrical equipment. [nL8N1L95US]

ABB is scouting for potential acquisitions in certain areas, such as planning software, and those would likely be smaller deals, Spiesshofer said.

ABB will be "brutally disciplined" in what it buys, he said, noting that the company "could have afforded" to buy industrial robot maker Kuka last year, but walked away "because the economics did not fit what we want to do."

In a presentation on Wednesday, Spiesshofer reaffirmed that, after what he called a "transitional year" in 2017, ABB should begin hitting its goals for revenue growth of 3 to 6 percent, and returns on capital investments in the "mid-teens."

Spiesshofer said problems with excess capacity in the robotics and motion business that hit second-quarter results should be resolved by growth in business.

"I am confident for the full year we will be back" within a profit margin range of 15 to 18 percent, he said. Operating margins for ABB's robotics and motion business were 14.9 percent in the second quarter.

CORRECTED-United Tech, Rockwell deal faces bumpy road to approval, especially in the EU - Reuters News

{{20170906T015652.265+0000}}CORRECTED-United Tech, Rockwell deal faces bumpy road to approval, especially in the EU(In 4th paragraph corrects misstatement by source in 1st sentence to say combined company would have 50 percent of systems content on the Boeing 787, not 50 percent of all content. In second sentence of 4th paragraph, corrects to say Michaels does not see a regulatory issue, not that this could be a bigger issue.))

By Tim Hepher, Alwyn Scott and Diane Bartz

PARIS/NEW YORK/WASHINGTON, Sept 5 (Reuters) - U.S. aerospace and industrial company United Technologies Corp faces a long road to win approval for its $23 billion plan to buy avionics maker Rockwell Collins Inc , and the biggest bumps could be in Brussels rather than Washington.

United Tech and Rockwell, who both supply airplane makers, say the overlap in their product lines is relatively small. Yet opponents of the deal could argue the combination gives the aircraft parts supply company undue market power.

An early sign of trouble came when U.S. plane maker Boeing Co said it intended to take a "hard look" at the proposed deal. "Until we receive more details, we are skeptical that it would be in the best interest of—or add value to—our customers and industry," Boeing said in a statement.

The combined company could make more than 50 percent of the systems content on a Boeing 787 aircraft, by dollar value, noted Kevin Michaels, president of consulting firm AeroDynamic Advisory, referring to such components as flight controls and air conditioning. Michaels said he does not see the deal facing an issue from a competitive standpoint as there is virtually no overlap in products between the two companies.

Rockwell's shares rose 0.3 percent to $131.00 while United Tech shares fell 5.7 percent to $111.21, in part on the warning from Boeing. [nL2N1LM0KR]

There was also a sign that Airbus is preparing to ratchet up pressure behind the scenes. A source close to the European plane maker told Reuters there were concerns about a "disconnect" between United Technologies and the leadership of its Pratt & Whitney unit. Another Airbus source said any distraction due to the merger would benefit Pratt & Whitney's main rival CFM International, co-owned by the U.S. manufacturer General Electric Co and France's Safran .

Problems at Pratt & Whitney have delayed European aircraft deliveries, and Airbus has publicly warned United Tech to focus on delivering jet engines on time. [nP6N1JF00H]

If Boeing or Airbus opts to complain to antitrust enforcers, they can take the complaint to Europe's competition authority and either the U.S. Justice Department or Federal Trade Commission, both of which review proposed mergers for compliance with antitrust law.

Their strongest argument would be if both companies made one or several parts and had few competitors.

"Many initially assumed it would be a slam dunk because of the lack of overlap. But the EU probe may prove to be difficult, simply on the grounds that the combined company would be so big," said Nick Cunningham, aerospace analyst at UK-based Agency Partners.

Boeing could also be concerned about the "portfolio effect," where companies are able to exercise leverage based on the fact that they sell a wide range of specialized products to certain customers.

This argument was used to doom GE's plan to buy Honeywell in 2001, although it was European regulators rather than Washington who killed that deal.

Boeing or other companies objecting to the deal could complain about a loss of competition. That would be the case if the government proves that either United Tech or Rockwell had plans to expand to compete with the other, said James Tierney, a former Justice Department antitrust expert now at the law firm Orrick.

Antitrust enforcers would also be concerned by the reduced number of market players if United Tech and Rockwell were among the few companies that Boeing or Airbus could reach out to resolve technical problems, said Tierney.

That concern would be amplified if the Defense Department agreed, said Tierney.

Both the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission review proposed mergers to ensure they are legal under antitrust law. It is unclear which of the agencies would review this deal, antitrust experts said.

UPDATE 5-UTC touts $23 bln deal as stock drops, Boeing turns critic - Reuters News

{{20170905T194317.335+0000}}UPDATE 5-UTC touts $23 bln deal as stock drops, Boeing turns critic(Recasts and adds detail)

By Alwyn Scott

NEW YORK, Sept 5 (Reuters) - Investors and Boeing Co gave two thumbs down on Tuesday to aerospace and industrial company United Technologies Corp $23 billion plan to buy avionics maker Rockwell Collins Inc .

The acquisition, announced on Monday, would be the largest in aerospace history and create a new player in the top echelon of suppliers to Boeing, Airbus, Bombardier and other plane makers. [nL2N1LL17P]

United Tech shares were down 5.2 percent after Boeing said it would and use the power granted by its contracts with the companies, and its sway with regulators, "to protect our interests." [nL2N1LM15K]

The stock had fallen more than 4 percent before Boeing's statement, as analysts factored in United Tech's decision to halt share buybacks for three to four years and earnings dilution caused by the cash-and-stock deal. Analysts expected $2 billion in buybacks in the second half of 2017 alone.

The loss of years of buybacks and Boeing's unusual blowback came as plane makers are pressing United Tech and other suppliers for price cuts and trying to compete against them on high-margin services and spare parts.

By making more of the components used on each Boeing and Airbus SE aircraft, analysts say, United Technologies-Rockwell Collins would gain leverage to resist that pressure.

United Tech Chief Executive Greg Hayes, who would lead the combined company, brushed aside Boeing's concerns.

"The whole idea of this deal is to be able to drive more innovative solutions at lower cost for our customers - both the (plane makers) and the airlines," Hayes told Reuters on Tuesday, shortly before Boeing issued its criticism.

Rockwell's skill with software combined with United Tech's expertise in numerous aircraft components allows the company to offer new "digital" products that airlines want, he said.

"We'll be able to do predictive analytics that many others can't do, and that's how you add value to airline customers," Hayes said, referring to data-crunching that allows airlines to spot problems in engines and other components before they fail.

HAYES ASSURED ENDERS

Hayes said he had assured Airbus CEO Tom Enders that United Tech's Pratt & Whitney unit will stay on track to deliver between 350 and 400 jetliner engines this year.

United Tech fell behind on engine deliveries this year due to production problems, and Airbus raised concern last week about the deal distracting United Tech. [nL2N1LH0WI]

"Pratt has nothing to do with this," Hayes said, noting United Tech's aerospace unit, not Pratt, will combine with Rockwell Collins to create Collins Aerospace.

Hayes also knocked down speculation that the purchase would prompt United Tech to spin off its Carrier air conditioner or Otis elevator units, saying the company needs their cash flow to help pay down debt from the deal.

But Hayes did not rule out such sales in the longer term.

"After the deal is done, and after we pay down some debt, we're going to go back and look," he said.

If the company's share price does not reflect its value, he said, "we'll need to do something."

United Tech could sell "non-core pieces" such as home security in the meantime, Hayes said. But given taxes and lost earnings, "it's hard to make financial sense out of those transactions" unless they fetch a high price, he said.

Rockwell's shares rose 0.3 percent to $131.00 in afternoon trading. United Tech shares, part of the Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI>, fell 5.2 percent to $111.82.

"We see limited upside near term as share repurchase is withdrawn and deal timing becomes an investor focus," analyst Jeff Sprague at Vertical Research Partners said in a note.

United Tech's engines and systems portfolio has little overlap with the avionics, seats and interiors businesses of Rockwell, which Hayes said should mean little trouble during the necessary regulatory review.

The combination, if successful, would mark the rise of a second engines-to-seating supplier, after jet-engine maker Safran SA's pending $7.7-billion deal to buy seat maker Zodiac Aerospace . Safran said on Tuesday it would look at assets that might come up for sale after the United Tech-Rockwell deal. [nL8N1LM2UL]

United Tech expects to borrow $15 billion and will assume $7 billion in Rockwell debt to fund the deal, which is expected to close by the third quarter of 2018. [nL2N1LL17P]

United Tech said the acquisition would add to earnings in its first full year and yield at least $500 million in cost savings by the fourth year of operation.

INSIGHT-GE shifts strategy, financial targets for digital business after missteps - Reuters News

{{20170828T050003.952+0000}}INSIGHT-GE shifts strategy, financial targets for digital business after misstepsBy Alwyn Scott

NEW YORK, Aug 28 (Reuters) - General Electric Co wants its industrial software business to cut costs and lift profits next year under new chief executive John Flannery, and is considering expanded partnerships and the possible sale of some equity in the unit, according to people familiar with the business.

Former chief executive Jeffrey Immelt spent six years and more than $4 billion transforming 125-year-old GE into a "digital industrial" company. But GE has had technical problems and delays with its software platform, known as Predix, which connects equipment like turbines and elevators to computers that can predict failures and reduce operating costs.

This spring, GE called an unusual, two month "time-out" to tackle the Predix problems, which have not been previously reported. With fixes in place, GE will now emphasize sales to existing customers in its energy, aviation and oil-and-gas businesses, and scale back efforts to sell to new customers in other sectors, three senior GE executives told Reuters.

"Our resources will go to our fastest-selling markets," GE Digital Chief Executive Officer Bill Ruh said in an interview.

To help investors better understand Predix, GE also has redefined digital revenue to exclude $3 billion in hardware related to its gas-fueled power plants, providing a clearer picture of the "pure" software business and avoiding double-counting, Chief Financial Officer Jeff Bornstein said.

The company now expects $12 billion in digital revenue in 2020, compared with $15 billion under the old definition. GE's total revenue hit nearly $124 billion last year.

The changes mark an important course correction for GE Digital, which so far has not delivered the revenue investors wanted and is partly responsible for a 25 percent decline in GE's share price this year to a near two-year low.

GE estimates the industrial internet market will be worth $225 billion a year by 2020, and Flannery, who became CEO on Aug. 1, appears committed to Immelt's vision of being a major player, according to two people familiar with his thinking.

But the 55-year-old leader, known for finance skills and making tough decisions, is likely to press GE Digital to reduce costs and lift profits next year. He also may restructure how GE Digital operates, bring in more partners and possibly sell a minority stake in the unit, they told Reuters.

"There was a lot of money spent on Predix," said a former senior financial executive at GE who worked with Flannery. "They are going to tighten the grip and ensure there's a return."

GE declined to comment on Flannery's plans.

"ENDLESS CHECKBOOK"

Immelt was among the first executives to spot the industrial internet wave nearly a decade ago, and positioning the company to catch it became one of his signature strategic moves in his 16 year term as chief executive.

"This is an all-encompassing change," Immelt said last year, as GE increased its digital investment.

Analysts and investors see potential for Predix to deliver substantial sales and profits. It already has attracted some large customers, including power utility Exelon Corp and elevator maker Schindler Holding AG , and orders rose 24 percent to $2.3 billion in the first half of 2017.

But some analysts and investors say the business has taken longer than expected to mature, and its current growth rate is too slow to hit GE's $12 billion target by 2020. Spending also soared under Immelt, which weighed on profits.

"He gave Bill Ruh an endless checkbook," Nick Heymann, an analyst at William Blair & Co., said of Immelt.

Case in point: GE has budgeted $700 million more in digital spending this year - to a total of $2.1 billion - to further develop Predix and its applications, and to boost sales efforts. GE executives noted this is likely to mark the peak for digital investment.

GE Digital Chief Financial Officer Khozema Shipchandler said the 2020 revenue target is within reach since recurring Predix subscriptions "pile on significant revenue as time goes on."

FIXING PREDIX

Immelt pushed GE to go digital sooner than other companies. But some early missteps cost time and money as GE's strategy evolved. Engineers initially advised building data centers that would house the "Predix Cloud." But after Amazon.com Inc and Microsoft Corp spent tens of billions of dollars on data centers for their cloud services, AWS and Azure, GE changed course.

"That is not an investment we can compete with," Ruh said.

GE abandoned its go-it-alone cloud strategy a year ago. It now relies on AWS and expects to be using Azure by late October, four months behind schedule, the executives said.

As GE pivoted away from building data centers, its engineers focused on applications, which executives now saw as more useful for winning business and more profitable than the platform alone.

"That is probably the biggest lesson we've learned," Ruh said.

GE also faced legacy challenges in adapting to Predix software. GE has many algorithms for monitoring its machines, but they mostly were written in different coding languages and reside on other systems in GE businesses. This makes transferring them to Predix more time consuming, people familiar with the system told Reuters.

The acquisition of Meridium and ServiceMax over the past 10 months gave GE well-known applications and added about $150 million to annual digital revenue, GE said. But the new products also brought more code that had to be converted to run on Predix, people familiar with the systems said.

The result: software installation sometimes took much longer than GE anticipated, the code had bugs and applications sometimes lacked features that customers wanted, these people said.

GE executives acknowledged Predix had experienced technical problems and was behind schedule in hitting some goals. During the "time out" in May and June, GE Digital's programmers made Predix more stable, they said.

The changes in strategy have come with a change in leadership. Predix chief Harel Kodesh and GE Digital Chief Commercial Officer Kate Johnson both left this year. Patrick Franklin, who succeeded Kodesh, called the "time out" to fix Predix.

Ruh said the leadership "evolved with the business" and that GE has the right people to keep Predix growing.

RIVALS TAKE AIM

The competition is not standing still. Large rivals such as Siemens AG and a crop of nimble startups are pressing to gain market share in GE's main areas of energy, aviation, locomotives, health care and oil and gas.

Chicago-based startup Uptake signed a deal in March with subsidiaries of Berkshire Hathaway Energy to provide analytics on thousands of wind turbines, including those made by GE. C3 IoT, based in Redwood City, California, won a deal last year with French utility Engie SA , a GE customer. Engie later signed a digital partnership agreement with GE.

Stewart & Stevenson, a maker of fracking pumps and other equipment, met with GE about Predix in 2015 but quickly decided against it.

"They didn't seem to be able to customize to meet the needs of our customers," said Chris Harvell, the firm's chief technology officer. "And if they did do any development, we'd probably end up paying quite a bit of money."

The company chose Flutura, a 100-person, Houston firm started in 2012, for a pilot. Flutura lacked GE's scale, but could easily produce custom code, he said.

Ruh said that while GE faces competitors in every deal, many startups are not true competitors because Predix includes unique applications and is available globally.

"No other competitor has these capabilities on their platforms," he said.

Inside GE, executives remain bullish. Predix will pay off handsomely if GE stays focused on building it and winning customers, said Joshua Bloom, co-founder and chief technology officer of Wise.io, an artificial intelligence firm GE bought last year.

But, he said, "doing that right and at scale is a massive challenge."

Uber board votes to pick a new CEO - Reuters News

{{20170828T001637.631+0000}}Uber board votes to pick a new CEOSAN FRANCISCO, Aug 27 (Reuters) - The Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] board of directors said on Sunday it had voted on its pick for a new chief executive officer, but declined to disclose its choice publicly until informing employees.

The board met during the weekend to deliberate over the selection of a new chief executive to lead the ride-services company out of a nearly year-long crisis. Earlier on Sunday, Jeff Immelt, chairman of General Electric Co , said he was no longer in the running for the job. That leaves Meg Whitman, chief executive of Hewlett Packard Enterprise , as the most likely candidate.

"The board has voted and will announce the decision to the employees first," a board spokeswoman said in an email to Reuters.

U.S. drillers cut oil rigs ahead of Hurricane Harvey - Baker Hughes - 路透新闻

{{20170825T170500.346+0000}}U.S. drillers cut oil rigs ahead of Hurricane Harvey - Baker HughesBy Jessica Resnick-Ault

Aug 25 (Reuters) - U.S. energy firms cut oil rigs for a
second week in a row ahead of Hurricane Harvey and as a more
than year-long recovery in drilling slows down in reaction to
soft crude prices.

Drillers cut four oil rigs in the week to Aug. 25, bringing
the total count down to 759, General Electric Co's  Baker
Hughes energy services firm said in its report on Friday.

That compares with 406 active oil rigs during the same week
a year ago. Drillers have added rigs in 56 of the past 65 weeks
since the start of June 2016.

The rig count is an early indicator of future output.

Refineries, terminals, production platforms and other
infrastructure have begun shutdown procedures with Hurricane
Harvey set to make landfall on the central Texas coast on Friday
night or early on Saturday as a Category 3 hurricane,
potentially the biggest storm to hit the mainland United States
in 12 years.[nL2N1LA1UX]

Harvey could also bring flooding to inland shale oil fields
in southern Texas that produce more than 1 million barrels of
oil per day.

EOG Resources Inc  on Thursday said it has curtailed
drilling and shut in some production in the Eagle Ford shale
region. Noble Energy Inc  and Statoil ASA  also
said it was evacuating some staff from production facilities in
the region. [nL2N1LA190]

U.S. crude futures  were up 22 cents, or 0.5 percent,
at $47.64 a barrel as the Gulf Coast energy hub braced for the
hurricane but were down for the week as the market has been
under pressure from rising U.S. production.

U.S. production is expected to rise to 9.4 million barrels
per day (bpd) in 2017 and a record 9.9 million bpd in 2018 from
8.9 million bpd in 2016, according to federal projections.
[EIA/M]

BHP Billiton  , the world's largest miner, said on
Tuesday it would exit its underperforming U.S. shale oil and gas
business it acquired at the height of the oil boom,[nL4N1L75D4]

GE, ABB restart talks over industrial solutions deal -sources - Reuters News

{{20170823T222229.808+0000}}GE, ABB restart talks over industrial solutions deal -sourcesBy Greg Roumeliotis and Alwyn Scott

Aug 23 (Reuters) - General Electric Co has resumed negotiations to sell its industrial solutions business to Swiss engineering company ABB Ltd , after the U.S. industrial conglomerate moderated its price expectations, people familiar with the matter said.

The move underscores the determination of John Flannery, who took over from Jeffrey Immelt as GE's chief executive on Aug. 1, to continue to divest non-core assets, as he carries out a review of the company's portfolio.

GE is entertaining the possibility of selling its industrial solutions business for a little over $2 billion after initially hoping for more than $3 billion, four sources said this week. The talks with ABB had ended last month over price disagreements.

There is no certainty of a deal and another bidder could still emerge, the sources said. However, French electrical component and energy management group Schneider Electric SA , which Reuters reported in April was vying for the GE unit, has since lost interest, the sources added.

The sources asked not to be identified because the negotiations are confidential. GE and ABB declined to comment, while Schneider Electric did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

GE's industrial solutions business offers circuit breakers, relays, panel boards and other industrial electrical equipment for several markets, including the healthcare, mining, renewable energy, telecommunication, construction and data center sectors.

GE, which makes everything from power plants and jet engines to medical scanners and locomotives, has been reviewing its portfolio after divesting its finance, appliances and NBCUniversal units in recent years. Nelson Peltz's activist hedge fund Trian Fund Management LP has also been pressuring GE to cut costs and focus on its core industrial businesses.

Earlier this year, GE agreed to sell its industrial water treatment business to French waste and water group Suez SA and Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec for 3.2 billion euros ($3.4 billion). [nL5N1GL5WQ]

Last month, Schneider Electric said it would acquire automatic transfer switch maker Asco Power Technologies for $1.25 billion from Vertiv, the former network power business of Emerson Electric Co that is now owned by private equity firm Platinum Equity LLC.

That deal eliminated Schneider Electric as a potential buyer for GE's industrial solutions business, because such a deal would face significant antitrust hurdles, according to the sources.

ABB Chief Executive Ulrich Spiesshofer has been under pressure to tackle lower profitability at the Swiss engineering company, after higher raw material prices and overcapacity issues dented its latest quarterly earnings. [nL5N1KB0FK]

RPT-Wind turbine tie-ups under pressure as sector awaits more deals - Reuters News

* More deals expected as industry is squeezed - sources

* Nordex, Senvion seen as takeover candidates - sources

By Christoph Steitz

FRANKFURT, Aug 22 (Reuters) - A sell-off in shares of recently merged wind turbine makers highlights the growing speed at which competition in the sector is heating up, raising expectations for more deals in the quest for scale.

In the latest sign of the squeeze, Siemens Gamesa last week said it would cut 600 staff, less than a month after it revealed third-quarter operating profit had dwindled by a fifth, partly due to India's shift to auctions from guaranteed tariffs. [nS3N1K802D]

The wind power industry, growing steadily but still largely reliant on state support, has witnessed a number of large M&A deals in recent years that were triggered by a steep drop in turbine prices, down a quarter since 2010.

General Electric beefed up its wind business with the takeover of France's Alstom, Germany's Nordex snapped up the turbine unit of Spain's Acciona and Siemens merged its wind division with rival Gamesa.

The latter created the world's No.2 player, with a combined market share of 14 percent last year, still behind Danish sector leader Vestas but overtaking GE, according to consultancy MAKE. Nordex ranks sixth.

Followed by the usual mix of job cuts and the replacement of top management, these deals come at a time the industry is moving towards an auction-based system that favours those who can bid at the lowest price, not those busy with integration.

"Mergers are always difficult. And if it's companies from two different cultures it's not going to get easier," said Thomas Deser, senior portfolio manager at Union Investment, a shareholder of Siemens Gamesa.

"The introduction of auctions has led to a significant price erosion that has triggered concerns about margins."

Significant share price declines also suggest that the deals were too expensive. Since the transactions were publicly announced in October 2015 and June 2016, respectively, Siemens Gamesa's stock has declined by about a quarter, while Nordex's has more than halved.

"Both companies have their own individual problems in certain markets. But it's also true that they both have to manage a merger which is a burden," a person who worked on one of the deals said.

Rival Vestas, in contrast, has seen its shares gain by about two thirds since late 2015.

NO MORE HIDING

Before the advent of auctions, wind farm developers could rely on feed-in tariffs that were guaranteed by law for as much as two decades, which critics say prevented the industry from becoming cost-competitive more quickly.

Now, they are increasingly relying on cheap wind turbines, leading their manufacturers to look for ways to cut production costs, including buying up rotor blade makers or outsourcing more to them. [nL5N1F73HH] http://tmsnrt.rs/2iIwVd5

Nordex, which suffered a major loss of investor confidence earlier this year after slashing its mid-term outlook, has also flagged further job cuts, saying business in Europe contracted sharply in the first half of 2017. [nFWN1KP07Z]

"Wind is now becoming a really mature market. Parties now have to prove that they are the most efficient," said Danny van Doesburg, senior portfolio manager at APG Asset Management, a shareholder in Siemens, which owns 59 percent of Siemens Gamesa.

"The time you could hide in a project is over," he added.

In April, Germany's EnBW became the first project developer to say it would be able to build offshore wind parks -- the most expensive renewable energy source -- without any government subsidies. [nL8N1HL36G]

That, along with recent ultra-low bids for onshore wind in Turkey, will force equipment makers to gain even more scale and seek more deal opportunities, afraid they might fall behind or go down otherwise, analysts and M&A sources said.

"We strongly believe the global... market will consolidate further, putting smaller players such as Nordex at risk of being marginalized," Barclays analysts wrote earlier this month.

Sources that have worked on the two German-Spanish tie-ups said that Nordex and smaller German peer Senvion were particularly exposed to become takeover targets themselves, pointing to their relatively small size.

At an EV/EBITDA multiple of 5 and 4 times, respectively -- a key indicator for M&A deals -- both groups look cheap compared to sector leaders Vestas and Siemens Gamesa, which trade between 7 and 8 times.

Acciona, which became Nordex's largest shareholder as part of the deal and now holds 29.9 percent, will likely make an offer for the rest once a three-year lock-up period ends next year, the sources said.

"We currently see no need for us to consolidate further," a spokesman for Nordex said. A spokesman for Senvion said that while the group saw "enormous consolidation pressure" it was working to implement its future strategy.

Acciona and private equity firm Centerbridge, Senvion's majority owner, both declined to comment.

RPT-Tokyo Stock Exchange hopes new entrants can revive stagnant solar trust markets - Reuters News

{{20170820T220001.890+0000}}RPT-Tokyo Stock Exchange hopes new entrants can revive stagnant solar trust markets(Repeats earlier story for wider readership with no change to text.)

* TSE struggles to attract investors to solar power trusts

* Two of the three trusts trade below IPO price

* Institutional investors prefer private funds

By Junko Fujita

TOKYO, Aug 18 (Reuters) - The Tokyo Stock Exchange's (TSE) two-year old infrastructure market hopes to get a badly needed boost for its listed solar power trusts as two new entrants plan to start up as early as this year.

The Tokyo Stock Exchange's (TSE) solar power trust market has so far drawn little interest as investors prefer private funds because the public trusts' tax benefits are limited.

Since the TSE created its infrastructure market in 2015, only three solar power trusts have listed with a combined value of $180 million.

"We don't have a wider range of investors in the market," said Takumi Hayase, vice president of the TSE's new listings. "The market needs to be much bigger for institutional investors."

Now, TSE is hoping that two new trusts will bring fresh capital.

The Japanese unit of Canadian Solar Inc and electricity wholesaler Itochu Enex Co <8133.T>, have set up asset management firms in preparation to list investment trusts packaging their assets, according to a document from Japan's land ministry.

Officials from both Canadian Solar and Itochu Enex declined to comment on their listing plans.

The lack of interest in the solar trusts is at odds with Japan's soaring solar power capacity, which has soared from virtually zero at the start of the decade to over 40,000 gigawatt-hours.

The country plans to generate 24 percent of its power from renewables by 2030, up from 14.6 percent in 2015, according to the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry.

TAX RULES

The sluggish interest in its solar trusts are linked to its tax rules, investors said.

The trusts are exempt from corporate taxes for 20 years. In return, they are required to pay 90 percent of their profits to investors, resulting in higher dividends than ordinary stocks.

However, a Tokyo-based fund manager, who did not want to be named because he was not authorized to speak to the media, said it was risky to invest in solar trusts because profits could drop significantly after the tax perk expires.

"Various restrictions on the tax system is one of the factors that is limiting the growth of infrastructure trusts," said Masanori Sato, head of the banking and structured finance group at law firm Mori Hamada & Matsumoto.

So far, the three solar trusts that have listed on the TSE market - Takara Leben Infrastructure Fund Inc <9281.T>, Ichigo Green Infrastructure Investment Corp <9282.T>, and Renewable Japan Energy Infrastructure Fund Inc <9283.T> - have mainly drawn interest from individual investors.

Two of the trusts are trading below their initial public offering prices, while Ichigo Green is trading 0.5 percent above the IPO price as of Friday.

Many investors like solar projects because they offer stable long-term returns and benefit from government subsidies, so-called feed-in tariffs that guarantee revenues.

"Pension fund managers want to secure stable returns, so we hold assets long-term and we do not need to seek a liquid market," said Takeshi Ito, a senior portfolio manager for Aisin Employees' Pension Funds.

Yet so far, investors like Nippon Life Insurance have preferred buying into private funds that not only offer annual dividends but will also typically repay the initial investment once the fund matures.

Nippon Life in June pledged 10 billion yen ($91.50 million) to a fund that General Electric is raising to invest in solar power plants in Japan.

Akitoshi Yamada, deputy general manager for Nippon Life's alternative investment department, said that GE's fund would deliver 5.5 percent annual returns over the next 25 years.

"We have not considered investing in public trusts trading on the TSE yet because for now we seek lower correlations with the stock and bond market when we invest in infrastructure," said Yamada.

Abu Dhabi signs with GE and Spain's TSK for Oman's first big wind farm  - Reuters News

{{20170820T112449.161+0000}}Abu Dhabi signs with GE and Spain's TSK for Oman's first big wind farm DUBAI, Aug 20 (Reuters) - Abu Dhabi renewable energy company Masdar has signed a contract with General Electric and Spain's TSK to build Oman's first large-scale wind farm in Dhofar, United Arab Emirates state news agency WAM reported on Sunday.

GE will provide the 13 turbines for the 50 megawatt wind farm in the south of the country while TSK will build other parts of the facility, which is being financed by aid from the Abu Dhabi government, WAM said.

WAM did not give a value for the project or say when it would be completed, but Oman's state-owned Rural Areas Electricity Co said last year that construction was expected to cost $125 million.

U.S. drillers cut oil rigs for second week in three - Baker Hughes - 路透新闻

{{20170818T184336.173+0000}}U.S. drillers cut oil rigs for second week in three - Baker HughesBy Jessica Resnick-Ault

Aug 18 (Reuters) - U.S. energy firms cut oil rigs for a
second week in three, data showed on Friday, with drillers
cutting spending plans in reaction to declining crude prices.

Drillers cut five oil rigs in the week to Aug. 18, bringing
the total count down to 763, General Electric Co's  Baker
Hughes energy services firm said in its report on Friday.

That compares with 406 active oil rigs during the same week
a year ago. Drillers have added rigs in 56 of the past 64 weeks
since the start of June 2016.

The rig count is an early indicator of future output.

U.S. production is expected to rise to 9.4 million barrels
per day (bpd) in 2017 and a record 9.9 million bpd in 2018 from
8.9 million bpd in 2016, according to federal projections.
[EIA/M]

Those output gains have pressured crude prices lower in
recent months, prompting several exploration and production
(E&P) companies. [nASB0BDZ2]

Those companies and others had mapped out ambitious spending
programs for 2017 when they expected U.S. oil prices  to
be higher than the near $48.50 per barrel range where they are
currently trading. [O/R]

Despite recently announced spending cuts, the E&Ps still
plan to spend much more this year than last year.

EXCLUSIVE-U.S. SEC officials' holdings, legal work, pose potential conflicts - Reuters News

{{20170817T183402.240+0000}}EXCLUSIVE-U.S. SEC officials' holdings, legal work, pose potential conflictsBy Pete Schroeder

WASHINGTON, Aug 17 (Reuters) - Two lawyers appointed to senior jobs at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission have ties to major companies including financial firms Goldman Sachs Group Inc and Wells Fargo & Co that could complicate efforts to regulate them, according to government documents viewed by Reuters.

Steven Peikin, the new co-head of enforcement at the SEC, held as much as $9 million worth of stock in dozens of blue-chip companies as of Aug. 8, according to a disclosure filing obtained through a public records request.

Among them are several large financial firms whose shares Peikin plans to divest, including Goldman, JPMorgan Chase & Co , Citigroup Inc and Intercontinental Exchange Group Inc , according to the filing.

He did not indicate plans to offload holdings in non-financial companies such as Apple Inc and General Electric Co .

Peikin also said in paperwork filed with the Office of Government Ethics that he or his former employer, law firm Sullivan & Cromwell, represented several big banks during his time there.

In a separate filing, William Hinman, the SEC's director of corporate finance, said his former law firm, Simpson Thacher & Bartlett, represented big banks as well as technology companies.

Should those companies come before the SEC, potential conflicts of interest could arise.

Having such conflicts is not unusual for senior SEC officials, whose stints at the agency are often bookended by private sector roles. The SEC has stricter rules than other government institutions about conflicts, and a detailed guide on how to handle them during and after roles at the agency.

"Steve and Bill are subject to and complying with all applicable ethics laws, rules, and regulations, and both are working with the agency's ethics counsel as needed," SEC spokeswoman Judith Burns said in a statement.

Peikin and Hinman had no further comment beyond the SEC's statement.

Peikin is co-head of enforcement alongside Stephanie Avakian, allowing him to recuse himself from matters that present conflicts. [nL1N1J51X3]

Thomas Sporkin, a partner at Buckley Sandler LLP, who previously led the SEC's Office of Market Intelligence, said that having two enforcement chiefs is "incredibly valuable" to avoid conflicts while ensuring a senior official is involved with important cases.

Conflicts of interest have long been a point of contention between those who argue the SEC benefits from hiring people with real-world experience, and critics who say the revolving door makes it impossible to regulate effectively.

That debate has heightened under U.S. President Donald Trump, who has stocked his administration with former business executives, and pledged to slash regulations. In July, SEC Chairman Jay Clayton, who is also a former corporate lawyer, outlined ways he plans to do that at the SEC. [nL1N1K31HZ]

"Their careers have been representing the industry that they're now supposed to regulate and they're going to bring to the job the mindset of the regulated parties," Robert Weissman, president of the liberal watchdog group Public Citizen. "Their orientation is serving Wall Street, not the public."

BANKS, TECH FIRMS

Peikin, 51, and Hinman, 62, are two of the most prominent appointments by Clayton, who faced questions from lawmakers about his own conflicts of interest during a confirmation hearing in March. [nL1N1J51X3]

While at Sullivan & Cromwell, Peikin represented Goldman and Barclays PLC in investigations involving sanctions violations, rate manipulation and insider trading.

The firm also provided services to JPMorgan, U.S. Bancorp and Wells Fargo & Co while he was there. The SEC is one of several authorities probing Wells Fargo over sales practices that harmed consumers. [nL1N1D322P]

Peikin said in his disclosure form confidentiality obligations prevented him from disclosing the identity of 18 other former clients, five of whom are the subject of "pending non-public government investigations."

Hinman said his former law firm performed work for Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and Facebook Inc CEO Mark Zuckerberg.

While he was there, Simpson Thacher & Bartlett also represented Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba Group Holding Ltd as well as its affiliate ANT Financial Services Group, which is seeking regulatory approval for a planned purchase of U.S. money transfer company Moneygram International Inc . [nL1N1K222Q]

Stephen Cohen, the director of Palantir Technologies, which signed a contract worth more than $43 million with the SEC in 2015, was another firm client during Hinman's employment. The contract was for five years, with years two through five being optional, an SEC spokeswoman told Reuters at the time. [nL2N1HC02W]

FACTBOX-Trump's manufacturing panel CEOs, companies comment on Charlottesville - Reuters News

{{20170815T225405.105+0000}}FACTBOX-Trump's manufacturing panel CEOs, companies comment on Charlottesville(Updates with Trumka's resignation)

Aug 15 (Reuters) - Four business leaders have resigned this
week from U.S. President Donald Trump's American Manufacturing
Council to protest the president's tepid comments to weekend
violence at a rally of white supremacists in Charlottesville,
Virginia.

AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka became the latest to resign
on Tuesday after Trump blamed both sides for the violence that
left one woman dead and several others injured. [nL8N1L137F]

Merck & Co Inc's  Kenneth Frazier, who is
African-American, was the first CEO to leave one of Trump's
presidential advisory councils and was followed by the chief
executives of Intel Corp  and Under Armour Inc .

Trump on Monday denounced white supremacists, including
neo-Nazis and the Ku Klux Klan, as "criminals and thugs," bowing
to days of mounting political pressure to condemn such groups
explicitly. However, on Tuesday he reverted to his earlier
comments blaming "many sides" for the violence. [nL2N1L00DV]

The following are responses from companies and CEOs on
Trump's manufacturing council to the violence in Virginia:

* Dow Chemical Co

"I condemn the violence this weekend in Charlottesville,
Virginia," Chief Executive Andrew Liveris said in a statement.

* Dell Inc [DI.UL]

"There's no change in Dell engaging with the Trump
administration and governments around the world to share our
perspective on policy issues that affect our company, our
customers and our employees," a Dell Inc spokeswoman said in a
statement.

CEO Michael Dell plans to remain on the manufacturing
council.

* General Electric Co

Jeff Immelt will remain on the council while he is the
chairman of the company.

"GE has no tolerance for hate, bigotry or racism, and we
strongly condemn the violent extremism in Charlottesville over
the weekend," a company spokesperson said.

* Intel Corp

"There should be no hesitation in condemning hate speech or
white supremacy by name. #Intel asks all our countries
leadership to do the same," CEO Brian Krzanich said in a tweet.
He later said in a blog post on Intel website that he was
exiting the council "to call attention to the serious harm our
divided political climate is causing to critical issues."

* Under Armour Inc

"We are saddened by #Charlottesville. There is no place for
racism or discrimination in this world. We choose love & unity,"
CEO Kevin Plank, who also left the council, said in a tweet from
the company's Twitter account.

* Whirlpool Corp

Whirlpool will stay on the council.

"Whirlpool Corp believes strongly in an open and inclusive
culture that respects people of all races and backgrounds. Our
company has long fostered an environment of acceptance and
tolerance in the workplace," a company spokeswoman said.

* Campbell Soup Co

Chief Executive Denise Morrison will remain on the council.

"The reprehensible scenes of bigotry and hatred on display
in Charlottesville over the weekend have no place in our
society. Not simply because of the violence, but because the
racist ideology at the center of the protests is wrong and must
be condemned in no uncertain terms," a company spokesman said in
a statement.

* American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial
Organizations (AFL-CIO)

AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka will resign from President
Trump's Council on Manufacturing, effective immediately

"I cannot sit on a council for a president that tolerates
bigotry and domestic terrorism," Trumka said.

* Wal-Mart Stores Inc

"Representing a company with the largest and one of the most
diverse groups of associates in the U.S., and an even more
diverse customer base of tens of millions of customers, we
believe we should stay engaged to try to influence decisions in
a positive way and help bring people together," Wal-Mart CEO
Doug McMillon said.

* Johnson & Johnson

"In the end, I have concluded that Johnson & Johnson has a
responsibility to remain engaged, not as a way to support any
specific political agenda, but as a way to represent the values
of Our Credo as crucial public policy is discussed and
developed," Johnson & Johnson CEO Alex Gorsky said in a
statement.

* International Paper Co

"International Paper strongly condemns the violence that
took place in Charlottesville over the weekend - there is no
place for hatred, bigotry and racism in our society," a company
spokesman said in a statement.

* Boeing Co

Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg will stay on the
manufacturing council.

* U.S. Steel Corp

A spokesperson referred queries related to the American
Manufacturing Council back to the White House.

UPDATE 1-Buffett's Berkshire adds Synchrony, sheds GE - Reuters News

{{20170814T220044.528+0000}}UPDATE 1-Buffett's Berkshire adds Synchrony, sheds GE(Adds details on holdings, comment, byline)

By Jonathan Stempel

NEW YORK, Aug 14 (Reuters) - Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc on Monday said it added a stake in Synchrony Financial , boosting its bet on the credit card industry, and shed its investment in the company's former parent, General Electric Co .

The changes were among those disclosed in Berkshire's quarterly report of its U.S.-listed stock holdings.

Berkshire said it owned 17.5 million shares of Synchrony, a private label credit card issuer split off from GE in 2014, worth about $521 million as of June 30.

It was already the largest investor in American Express Co , owning about one-sixth of that card issuer.

Synchrony shares rose 4.6 percent in after-hours trading, likely reflecting what investors consider Buffett's imprimatur.

Smaller equity investments for Berkshire are normally made by Buffett's deputies, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, while Buffett focuses on bigger bets such as American Express, Apple Inc and Wells Fargo & Co .

It is unclear who sold the GE investment, which was worth roughly $315 million at the end of March.

Berkshire's assistant did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Synchrony's share price has yet to recoup the 16 percent decline it suffered on April 28 after it wrote off more soured loans, causing profit for the Stamford, Connecticut-based company to fall short of forecasts.

Berkshire may have viewed that as "an opportunity to load up," Colin Plunkett, a Morningstar Inc analyst who covers Synchrony, said in an email.

He said Synchrony remains undervalued, with a low degree of leverage, and "really has a big opportunity to return cash to shareholders."

Synchrony did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

In the second quarter, Berkshire trimmed its stakes in American Airlines Group Inc , Delta Air Lines Inc and United Continental Holdings Inc , and boosted its stakes in Bank of New York Mellon Corp and General Motors Co .

It also nearly eliminated a decade-old investment in Wabco Holdings Corp , which supplies commercial vehicle parts.

Berkshire boosted its stake in Liberty Media Corp and reduced its holdings of Sirius XM Holdings Inc , both investments linked to billionaire John Malone.

Buffett and Malone have explored a large investment in U.S. phone company Sprint Corp , people familiar with the matter said last month. [nL4N1K54ZY]

Buffett's Berkshire sheds GE, adds Synchrony - Reuters News

{{20170814T203901.472+0000}}Buffett's Berkshire sheds GE, adds SynchronyNEW YORK, Aug 14 (Reuters) - Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc on Monday said it has taken a 17.5 million share stake in Synchrony Financial and shed its investment in the financial services company's former parent, General Electric Co .

In a regulatory filing detailing its U.S.-listed stock holdings, Berkshire said it owned about $521 million of Synchrony shares as of June 30.

It also reported no holdings of GE, after having reported a roughly $315 million stake as of March 31.

Investors follow Berkshire's stock holdings closely to determine what has won or lost Buffett's favor. Smaller equity investments at Berkshire are normally made by Buffett's deputies Todd Combs and Ted Weschler.

U.S. drillers add oil rigs for second week in three - Baker Hughes - 路透新闻

{{20170811T171024.971+0000}}U.S. drillers add oil rigs for second week in three - Baker HughesAug 11 (Reuters) - U.S. energy companies added oil rigs for
a second time in the last three weeks, extending a 15-month
drilling recovery, but the pace of additions has slowed in
recent months as firms cut spending plans in reaction to
declining crude prices.

Drillers added 3 oil rigs in the week to Aug. 11 bringing
the total count up to 768, the most since April 2015. General
Electric Co's  Baker Hughes energy services firm said in
its closely followed report on Friday.

That compares with 396 active oil rigs during the same week
a year ago. Drillers have added rigs in 56 of the past 63 weeks
since the start of June 2016.

The rig count is an early indicator of future output.

U.S. production is expected to rise to 9.4 million barrels
per day (bpd) in 2017 and a record 9.9 million bpd in 2018 from
8.9 million bpd in 2016, according to federal projections.
[EIA/M]

Those output gains have pressured crude prices lower in
recent months, prompting several exploration and production
(E&P) companies, including Carrizo Oil & Gas Inc 
[nASB0BDZ1], Continental Resources Inc  [nL1N1KV1I9] and
Denbury Resources Inc  [nASB0BDZ2]

Those companies and others had mapped out ambitious spending
programs for 2017 when they expected U.S. oil prices  to
be higher than the near $48.50 per barrel range where they are
currently trading. [O/R]

Despite recently announced spending cuts, the E&Ps still
plan to spend much more this year than last year.

Analysts at U.S. financial services firm Cowen & Co said in
a note this week its capital expenditure tracking showed 57 of
the 64 E&Ps it follows planned to increase spending by an
average of 49 percent in 2017 from 2016.

That expected 2017 spending increase followed an estimated
48 percent decline in 2016 and a 34 percent decline in 2015,
Cowen said.

Cowen said it expects the total U.S. count, including both
oil and natural gas rigs, to decline through 2017 and 2018. Most
wells produce both oil and gas.

The current U.S. oil and gas rig count is 949, according to
Baker Hughes. That compares with an average of 509 in 2016 and
978 in 2015.

General Electric's new CEO places $2.7 mln bet on company's future - Reuters News

{{20170810T234314.335+0000}}General Electric's new CEO places $2.7 mln bet on company's futureAug 10 (Reuters) - General Electric Co's new Chief Executive Officer John Flannery made a big bet that the industrial company's flagging fortunes will improve, buying nearly $2.7 million in GE stock, according to a regulatory filing.

Flannery bought 103,983 GE shares for his 401(k) account on Tuesday and reported in a filing dated Wednesday. He now has about 615,000 shares worth $15.5 million at Thursday's closing price.

When Flannery, 55, took over from longtime CEO Jeff Immelt on Aug. 1, he told employees he plans to improve GE's performance, which has caused its stock to fall 19 percent this year, even as broad stock indexes advanced.

Investors think the company needs to generate more cash, widen its profit margins and reduce overhead costs, Flannery said in the letter, adding, "I heard them loud and clear."

Flannery was not available to comment and GE declined to comment on the filing.

Immelt, who remains GE's chairman through year-end, bought 1.2 million shares of GE stock during his 16-year tenure as CEO, during which he focused GE on large industrial businesses such as power generators, renewable energy and aircraft engines while shedding most of GE's finance business along with NBCUniversal and its plastics and appliances units.

RPT-Some U.S. coding boot camps stumble in a crowded field - Reuters News

By Salvador Rodriguez

SAN FRANCISCO, August 9 (Reuters) - The hype is fading for coding "boot camps," for-profit U.S. schools offering graduates entry into the lucrative world of software development.

Closures are up in a field now jammed with programs promising to teach students in just weeks the skills needed to get hired as professional coders. So far this year, at least eight schools have shut down or announced plans to close in 2017, according to the review website Course Report.

Two pioneers in the sector, San Francisco's Dev Bootcamp and The Iron Yard of Greenville, South Carolina, announced in July that they are being shut down by their corporate parents.

Others, including market leaders like General Assembly, a New York firm that has raised $120 million in venture capital, are shifting their focus to corporate training.

Competition has begun to squeeze out players in a field now crowded with nearly 100 academies in the United States and Canada, more than double the number just three years ago. Many in the industry expect more closures as the space begins to consolidate around dominant schools able to produce top-flight coders.

"Quality is going to win out in this industry, but it's going to be turbulent for a while," said Anthony Hughes, chief executive of Tech Elevator, a coding boot camp in Cleveland.

Fed by growing demand for coders and more than $250 million in venture funding, boot camps have mushroomed in recent years. Average tuition is just over $11,000 for a 14-week course, but can climb as high as $24,000 for longer programs, according to Course Report.

The training is aimed mainly at professionals looking to switch careers as well as students lacking the money or interest in attending a four-year college.

Some schools have students report to their classrooms; others offer their courses exclusively online. Students are prepared for entry-level technical roles such as junior developers building apps and websites, or as quality assurance engineers sniffing out bugs in code.

Collectively, these boot camps expect to graduate 23,000 students this year, more than double the 10,333 students that graduated in 2015, according to Course Report, which says starting salaries average around $69,000.

UNSUSTAINABLE MODELS

The first coding boot camps began to appear in 2011. The U.S. job market was still suffering from the Great Recession while demand for software engineers was growing. Many workers were eager to retrain for high-paying technology jobs.

Dev Bootcamp, launched in 2012, was among the first to offer intensive courses teaching web development coding languages such as JavaScript and Ruby. The popular classes soon spawned competitors such as Hack Reactor, Hackbright and App Academy. Investors quickly saw the potential for expanding the concept beyond the San Francisco area to burgeoning tech communities around the country. Venture firms including New York-based Thrive Capital put funding into New York's Flatiron School and Codecademy. Jeff Bezos, chief executive of Amazon.com Inc , was an investor in General Assembly's $4.5 million Series A and $10 million Series B funding rounds in 2011 and 2012.

Coding boot camps also got the attention of Kaplan Inc, the Fort Lauderdale, Florida, test-prep and vocational education company; and Apollo Education Group Inc, the company that operates the University of Phoenix. Kaplan bought Dev Bootcamp in 2014 while Apollo acquired The Iron Yard the following year.

But those two schools struggled under new ownership. Their cost structures were higher than those of mom-and-pop competitors but they didn't have big bankrolls to subsidize them like some venture-backed schools, people familiar with the situation said.

Despite continued growth in enrollment, Dev Bootcamp said in an early July statement that it could not "find a viable business model" that could cover "the critical day-to-day costs of running our campuses." The school is slated to shut down by year-end.

One week later, The Iron Yard, which had offered courses in 22 cities, announced it, too, would close.

"In considering the current environment, the board of The Iron Yard has made the difficult decision to cease operations at all campuses after teaching out remaining summer cohorts," Iron Yard said in a statement.

Other boot camp owners say their schools are thriving by delivering exactly what was promised.

Flatiron School, which has raised $14.5 million in venture funding, boasts a job placement rate of 97 percent, with an average full-time starting salary of almost $76,000 a year. Flatiron School's outcomes are audited by a Massachusetts accounting firm, according to the school.

"If you aren't putting out real outcomes, students are going to be skeptical," said Adam Enbar, chief executive of Flatiron School.

Zach Newburgh, 28, a Flatiron online student from New York, credits the school for helping him land a position as a junior web developer at Blackrock Inc, the New York investment firm.

"I was looking for a job where I'd be able to code every day at a Fortune 500 company," said Newburgh, who said he received multiple job offers. "With Flatiron, not only did they give me the skills necessary to be successful, they were a pipeline into Blackrock."

Other students say getting a job was much tougher than they expected.

Chase Thomas, 31, a resident of Walnut Creek, California, said it took him six months to land a position after spending $25,000 on courses with Thinkful, an online coding school, and General Assembly, where he completed a 10-week course at the company's San Francisco location.

Now a quality assurance engineer at the software vendor Workday, Thomas said he's happy he took the classes. But he said he wouldn't recommend that route for everyone, especially if it involves taking on debt, like he did. "Boot camps are seen as a ticket to the middle class. Everyone can do it, but the key is: do you want to?" Thomas said. "I love it, but it's not for everybody."

GOING CORPORATE

Some bigger, venture-backed boot camp startups, meanwhile, are shifting their attention to the corporate training market.

Denver-based Galvanize, for example, which has raised $63 million in venture capital, says it has begun helping corporate clients such as International Business Machines Corp and General Electric Co hire engineers and re-train their staffs with coding skills the companies need.

Corporate training has grown to one-third of its revenue, up from 10 percent, in just six months, and could "easily" surpass the company's consumer business in the near future, said Lawrence Mandes, co-founder and chief revenue officer of Galvanize.

General Assembly serves the likes of Adobe Systems Inc , AT&T Inc and Target Corp. Smaller players like Hack Reactor and Hackbright Academy are also placing a greater focus on the corporate market.

But this niche has its challenges too.

Boulder, Colorado-based RefactorU decided in December to pivot to running boot camps for other education providers, according to Sean Daken, who founded the school in 2013. But he said those clients came far more slowly than expected and a cash crunch ensued.

"The sale cycles are very, very long with those organizations," Daken said.

He said he let all of his employees go in April.

UPDATE 1-GE saves money by delaying Boston HQ tower construction - Reuters News

{{20170809T185118.487+0000}}UPDATE 1-GE saves money by delaying Boston HQ tower construction(Adds detail from GE)

Aug 9 (Reuters) - General Electric Co said it is delaying construction of the largest part of its new $200 million headquarters in Boston to save money as new Chief Executive John Flannery looks to curtail costs.

The company will cut millions of dollars from the project cost by postponing construction of a 12-story tower until 2019 as part of a second phase, rather than starting immediately, spokesman Jeff Caywood said.

GE is moving ahead with renovations of two smaller buildings and public amenities in the area as planned.

The company would have paid a premium in construction costs by building the tower at the same time, Caywood said.

GE would not disclose the exact savings but Caywood said "it's in the millions of dollars."

The scope of the development, at 15 Necco Street near Boston's waterfront, is not being changed and GE still expects to employ 800 people there when the project is finished in mid-2021.

The company is using nearby offices in the interim.

Renovation of the two brick buildings, totaling 95,000 square feet, is scheduled to be finished by mid-2019.The 295,000-square-foot tower is now scheduled to be completed in mid-2021, rather than in 2019.

"We are committed to Boston and look forward to moving to GE Innovation Point, which will be a hub for innovation and the industrial internet," Ann Klee, the GE vice president in charge of the Boston development, said in a statement.

The delay comes as Flannery is reviewing GE's operations with an eye toward cutting costs.

The company has said it expects to deliver as much as $2 a share in earnings next year but that it may miss the target if markets worsen. It also is focused on cutting $1 billion in costs next year.

The Boston Globe newspaper first reported GE's decision to delay the tower construction. (http://bit.ly/2vOBObi) GE told employees about the decision late Tuesday.

UK export agency OKs $117 mln in finance for Iraq power projects - Reuters News

{{20170809T125052.236+0000}}UK export agency OKs $117 mln in finance for Iraq power projectsBAGHDAD, Aug 9 (Reuters) - Britain's export credit arm has announced $117 million in financing for General Electric and training provider Enka UK to help build two gas power projects in Iraq.

UK Export Finance will support the early stages of construction of two GE-powered, 750-megawatt, gas-fired power plants in southern Iraq, a British government statement said.

Though Iraq is a major oil producer, the country faces chronic electricity shortages, with its fragile grid struggling to meet demand after years of war, sanctions and neglect.

Britain agreed in March to arrange 10 billion pounds ($13 billion) in loans to finance infrastructure projects in Iraq over 10 years, a programme that would benefit only British companies. [nL5N1GI06k] ($1 = 0.7699 pounds)

* Papua New Guinea contract includes wide range of services

* New service model could save millions, BHGE CEO says

(Adds analyst's comment, details on project)

By Ron Bousso

LONDON, Aug 8 (Reuters) - Baker Hughes, now part of General Electric , has won a major contract to provide a wide range of services to develop Papua New Guinea's first offshore gas field which is sees as a new model to help producers adapt to a world of low oil prices.

GE Oil and Gas completed its merger with Baker Hughes last month to become the world's second largest oilfield services company, bringing together traditional drilling and pumping gear with technology such as software, sensors and three-dimensional printing. [nL1N1JU0N3]

The contract in Papua New Guinea (PNG), worth several hundred million dollars, contrasts with the traditional model where a company awards various parts of field development separately to different providers.

It comes as the global oil and gas industry slowly emerges from a three-year rout that brought new field developments to a near standstill, creating intense competition among oil industry service companies for contracts.

Under the PNG contract BHGE will provide services to Australian exploration and production firm Twinza for the development of the Pasca A gas-condensate field ranging from the initial stages of well-drilling and appraisal through to production and gas processing, executives from the two companies said.

Applying the integrated suite of services together with advanced technology can save companies up to 5 percent in a sector where projects often involve billions in investment, according to BHGE Chief Executive Officer Lorenzo Simonelli.

"The price of oil continues to fluctuate. Capex spending is a moving target at the moment so productivity cost per barrel has to be the focus to get projects to a final investment decision," Simonelli told Reuters in an interview.

In an industry historically plagued by cost overruns and project delays, the "fullstream" model removes logistical delays such as the late arrival of vessels, or the needs to hold several tendering competitions for contracts and adapt to different equipment standards, according to Visal Leng, head of BHGE Asia Pacific.

Simonelli said there were "hundreds of millions (of dollars) associated with the development of the project", but did not give an exact figure for the contract.

BHGE is already working with some of the world's top oil companies on using its integrated services, including a large project with BP in the Gulf of Mexico, Simonelli said.

The integrated service model, also used by BHGE's larger rival Schlumberger , means that national oil companies will become less dependent on the expertise of the world's top oil and gas companies such as Exxon Mobil and Royal Dutch Shell for the development of fossil fuel resources, Evercore analyst James West said.

DECISION NEXT YEAR

Twinza is expected to make a final investment decision (FID) for the Pasca A project in early 2018 after drilling one more appraisal well this year.

The first phase of the field development will produce 14,000 barrels per day of natural gas liquids (NGLs) extracted together with the gas, Twinza Managing Director Huw Evans said. The gas will then be reinjected into the ground until the second phase of the project.

The Pasca A development would be profitable "way below the current oil price" of around $52 a barrel, according to Evans.

BHGE will also extend a credit line to Twinza to fund the appraisal of the field ahead of the final investment decision.

A decision to go ahead with the development of Pasca A would make it one of the few projects expected to be given the go-ahead in 2017 and 2018 as oil prices recover only slowly, despite a decision by OPEC and other producers to reduce their output.

"There was a lot of optimism at the end of 2016 with the actions OPEC took. Some of the optimism is being pushed to the right and you're seeing a progressive shift in some of the projects and people waiting a little longer for stability in the context of lower for longer (oil prices), or simply lower," Simonelli said.

GUIDE TO EU MERGER PROCESS

DEADLINES:

The European Commission has 25 working days after a deal is filed for a first-stage review. It may extend that by 10 working days to 35 working days, to consider either a company's proposed remedies or an EU member state's request to handle the case.

Most mergers win approval but occasionally the Commission opens a detailed second-stage investigation for up to 90 additional working days, which it may extend to 105 working days.

SIMPLIFIED:

Under the simplified procedure, the Commission announces the clearance of uncontroversial first-stage mergers without giving any reason for its decision. Cases may be reclassified as non-simplified - that is, ordinary first-stage reviews - until they are approved.

UPDATE 1-Airbus deliveries remain hampered by engine delays - Reuters News

{{20170805T130828.983+0000}}UPDATE 1-Airbus deliveries remain hampered by engine delaysBy Tim Hepher

TOULOUSE, France, Aug 4 (Reuters) - Airbus delivered 47 aircraft in July to reach the half-way point in its target for the year, but its narrowbody A320neo family continues to feel the disruption from delays in getting the latest generation of engines from their manufacturers.

The European planemaker said on Friday it had delivered 9 of the upgraded medium-haul jetliners in July, bringing total A320neo-family deliveries so far this year to 68, just a third of the full-year target of 200 for that model.

Airbus said last week its earnings had been hit by delays in receiving engines for the aircraft type and increased pressure on engine supplier Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies that has been hampered by a series of glitches [nL5N1KI0YG].

Total Airbus airplane deliveries between January and July reached 353 aircraft, propelled by brisk deliveries of the earlier A320 model, Airbus said in a monthly data release. That compares with a full-year target of around 700.

Evidence of the ongoing A320neo engine disruption could be seen on Friday in clusters of undelivered jets jammed into tight spaces around the perimeter of the Toulouse aerodrome where the world's second-largest planemaker has its main factory.

Some two dozen aircraft were visible from the roadside, painted in the livery of their airline customers but yet to receive their engines or in some cases wingtip extensions.

The majority of the jets are destined for airlines that have selected Pratt & Whitney's new Geared Turbofan engine, but a handful are also waiting for engines from CFM International, co-owned by General Electric and Safran .

A Reuters tally of jets parked without engines included six built for India: four for GoAir, a Pratt & Whitney customer, and two for CFM customer Air India. India said on Thursday Pratt & Whitney had promised a solution by September. [nL4N1KP5QU]

Others with as yet unpowered jets included Mexico's Volaris.

Asked to comment on the number of undelivered jets, an Airbus spokesman said it had delivered many more than at the same point last year, when A320neo output was in early stages, but that it had "expected to be more advanced" by mid 2017.

"We still target full-year A320neo deliveries to be around 200 but in view of the engine issues, this target becomes more challenging," he said.

Airbus introduced a caveat into its 2017 forecasts last week, saying its target of more than 700 jetliner deliveries depended on its engine suppliers.

Airbus meanwhile said on Friday it had sold four aircraft in July - typically a quiet month in odd-numbered years coming after the Paris Airshow - to reach 252 for the year.

That total fell to 205 after cancellations, leaving Airbus behind U.S. rival Boeing in this year's order race.

Boeing has posted 446 orders through July 25, or 386 when adjusted for cancellations.

July's orders included one Airbus A350-1000, a large twin-engined jet due for its first delivery by the end of this year.

UPDATE 1-U.S. oil drillers cut rigs for second week in three -Baker Hughes - 路透新闻

{{20170805T130827.201+0000}}UPDATE 1-U.S. oil drillers cut rigs for second week in three -Baker Hughes(Adds prices, companies and rig forecasts)

Aug 4 (Reuters) - U.S. energy firms cut the number of oil
rigs for the second in three weeks, slowing the pace of a
15-month drilling recovery, amid plans to spend less in reaction
to declines in crude prices over the past several months.

Drillers cut one oil rig in the week to August 4, bringing
the total count down to 765, General Electric Co's  Baker
Hughes energy services firm said in its report on Friday.

There were 381 active oil rigs during the same week a year
ago. Drillers have added rigs in 55 of the past 62 weeks since
the start of June 2016.

The rig count is an early indicator of future output.

U.S. crude production in May hit a 16-month high on gains in
Texas and offshore in the Gulf of Mexico, according to federal
energy data this week. [nL1N1KM17O]

Those output gains have pressured crude prices lower in
recent months, prompting several exploration and production
(E&P) companies this week to announce cuts to their future
spending plans, including Devon Energy Corp 
[nL4N1KN5Q0], Diamondback Energy Inc  [nL5N1KN88Y]
[nGNXOCTTZa], Marathon Oil Corp  [nL1N1KO238] and Rice
Energy Inc  [nASB0BCP4].

Those companies and others had mapped out ambitious spending
programs for 2017 when they expect U.S. oil prices  to be
higher than the current $49-per-barrel range. [O/R]

Despite recently announced spending cuts, the E&Ps still
plan to spend much more this year than last year.

Analysts at U.S. financial services firm Cowen & Co said in
a note this week that its capital expenditure tracking showed
the 64 E&Ps it follows planned to increase spending by an
average of 50 percent in 2017 from 2016.

That expected increase followed an estimated 48 percent
decline in 2016 and a 34 percent decline in 2015, Cowen said.

Cowen said the total U.S. count, including both oil and
natural gas rigs, is expected to decline through 2017 and 2018.
Most wells produce both oil and gas.

The current U.S. oil and gas rig count is 954, according to
Baker Hughes. That compares with an average of 509 in 2016 and
978 in 2015.

Abu Dhabi's Mubadala sells second stake in U.S. chipmaker AMD - Reuters News

{{20170804T072253.332+0000}}Abu Dhabi's Mubadala sells second stake in U.S. chipmaker AMDBy Stanley Carvalho

ABU DHABI, Aug 4 (Reuters) - Abu Dhabi's Mubadala Investment Company [MUDEV.UL] on Friday said it sold a 3.9 percent stake in Advanced Micro Devices in its second sale of shares in the U.S.-based semiconductor company this year.

State-owned Mubadala sold 40 million shares or 3.9 percent of the outstanding shares of the company, inclusive of warrants and excluding the convertible bonds, Mubadala spokesman Brian Lott said. The value of the deal was not disclosed. According to Reuters calculations, the sale value was $529.6 million based on AMD's closing share price of $13.24 on Thursday.

"This is in line with Mubadala's strategy as a financial investor with a long-term perspective, to optimise our shareholding in certain assets and monetize them at the appropriate time," Lott said.

In March, Mubadala sold 45 million shares for around $613 million. [ID:nL5N1GI05O]

Mubadala continues to be the largest shareholder in AMD, holding 57 million common shares and 75 million warrants, representing a 12.9 percent stake.

Mubadala, which has stakes in General Electric and private equity firm Carlyle Group , among others, was formally merged with another Abu Dhabi investment fund, International Petroleum Investment Co (IPIC) in January.

The merger created a firm with assets of about $122 billion based on valuations at the end of 2016.

UPDATE 2-ConvaTec profit misses, CFO quits; shares plunge - Reuters News

{{20170803T093758.633+0000}}UPDATE 2-ConvaTec profit misses, CFO quits; shares plunge(Adds share movement, analyst comment)

Aug 3 (Reuters) - Medical technology company ConvaTec on Thursday posted lower first-half profit that fell short of expectations as expenses rose, sending its shares down more than 10 percent.

ConvaTec also said CFO Nigel Clerkin would leave the company in October after its decision to relocate the position to its main office in Reading. He decided not to relocate his family from Dublin, it said.

Shares in the company, which declared an inaugural interim dividend of 1.4 cents per share, posted their biggest drop since going public last October. The stock was the top percentage loser on the FTSE 100 index <.FTSE> that was marginally up.

ConvaTec said it appointed Frank Schulkes as CFO-designate and will become CFO on Oct. 31.

Frank, who until 2015 was CFO and executive vice president of GE Healthcare, was the CFO of Germany-based industrial firm Wittur Group before being appointed at ConvaTec.

ConvaTec, whose products are used in acute wound care and critical care, said adjusted operating profit fell 7.4 percent to $193.5 million in the six months ended June 30. The profit was below the company compiled consensus of $207 million.

Operating expenses rose 10.4 percent to $307.7 million.

UBS analysts said ConvaTec management attributed weakness in the first half to a range of one-off and non-repeating issues, but expected improvement in growth rates in all divisions in the second half.

"But we expect guidance of more than 4 percent revenue growth will come into question after 1.5 percent in H1," UBS analysts said in a note.

Departure of the "well-regarded" CFO less than a year after the IPO may add an "additional cloud over the story", the analysts said.

The company, which raised nearly $1.8 billion in the biggest IPO in 2016, said guidance for the full year remained unchanged with revenue growth weighted towards the second half of the year.

ConvaTec recorded revenue growth in three out of its five businesses in the first half of the year.

Gross margins rose to 60.3 percent from 58.8 percent a year ago, on the back of a "margin-improvement plan" that delivered a 40-basis-point benefit in the first half on a constant currency basis, the company said.

ConvaTec still expects around half of the targeted 300 basis points improvement in adjusted gross margin this year. In comparison, the plan delivered a boost of about 130 basis points in 2016.

Revenue rose marginally to $831.3 million, missing the company-compiled estimates of $834.4 million, ConvaTec said.

BUZZ-Vestas: Shares hits 1-month low after GE law suit - Reuters News

{{20170803T075646.805+0000}}BUZZ-Vestas: Shares hits 1-month low after GE law suit** Vestas Wind Systems' shares hit a 1-month low on Thursday, down 0.8 pct at DKK 599.50 each

** Vestas said Wednesday that General Electric had filed a patent complaint in the United States. Vestas said it is "without merit" and intends to challenge it.

** "It will be a multi-year legal battle. As it stands today, Vestas should be able to continue execution on its order backlog and frame agreements, so its U.S. operation will be unaffected in the near term," says Nordea in a note.

** "Of course, its clients will be asking lots of questions and likely asking for more guarantees," Nordea says.

** "A possible outcome may be that 2017-20 will turn even more back-end loaded than previously anticipated, as developers etc want to see how the case develops," Nordea says.

** GE filed the lawsuit against Vestas for a patent breach relating to zero voltage ride-through technology (ZVRT), which is designed to ensure stability of the turbines during grid disturbances," Nordea says.

** Vestas may be able to offer a work-around if it loses the suit. "As this will be based on extra hardware, it will come at an extra cost and thus make Vestas' turbines more expensive," Nordea says.

U.S. Senate Democrats question if they can trust EXIM Bank nominee to support its mission - Reuters News

{{20170802T015247.351+0000}}U.S. Senate Democrats question if they can trust EXIM Bank nominee to support its missionWASHINGTON, Aug 1 (Reuters) - Eight U.S. Senate Democrats questioned on Tuesday whether they could trust President Donald Trump's nominee for the top job at the U.S. Export-Import Bank to support renewing the trade lender's charter in 2019 and to believe in its mission.

Scott Garrett, a former Republican congressman from New Jersey who was one of the EXIM Bank's leading opponents during a 2015 fight in Congress to shut it down, "refused to confirm that he would unequivocally support reauthorizing the bank," Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer and seven other senators said in a statement after meeting with Garrett.

The nominee for EXIM chairman has met with strong opposition from industry groups that use its financing, including the National Association of Manufacturers, which said Garrett had a track record of trying to undermine the institution.

The bank has been unable to approve loans above $10 million for two years because of efforts by conservative Republicans in Congress to shut it down and then block nominations to its board, keeping it from financing large aircraft, satellites, power turbines and other major projects.

Critics have charged that EXIM provides unnecessary "corporate welfare" to large companies such as Boeing , General Electric and Caterpillar , putting taxpayers at risk. The bank also provides export financing and guarantees for thousands of small manufacturers.

"Today's meeting was bizarre. Scott Garrett – one of the most vocal opponents of the Export-Import Bank while he was in Congress – agreed to speak with us about his nomination, but during the meeting, he wouldn't discuss his personal thoughts about the Bank and its mission," the senators said in a statement.

"The bank has overwhelming support from Republicans and Democrats in Congress and we need a leader of the bank who also fully stands by its goals," added the senators, who included Democrats Heidi Heitkamp, Maria Cantwell, Patty Murray, Sherrod Brown, Amy Klobuchar, Chris Coons and Joe Donnelly.

Their statement did not say specifically how they would vote on Garrett's nomination. No nomination hearing has been scheduled by the Senate Banking Committee.

A White House spokeswoman could not immediately be reached for comment on the senators' statement.

Sponsors may be tempted by Olympics return to Los Angeles - Reuters News

{{20170801T212828.220+0000}}Sponsors may be tempted by Olympics return to Los AngelesBy Liana B. Baker

SAN FRANCISCO, Aug 1(Reuters) - Even if it is more than a decade away, a Summer Games in Los Angeles in 2028 may be a boost to the International Olympic Committee's (IOC) efforts to extend its lucrative contracts with top sponsors such as Visa Inc and Coca-Cola Co, Olympic sponsorship experts said.

Los Angeles agreed to host the 2028 Summer Games, after bowing out of a two-way contest with Paris for the 2024 Summer Games. Awarding two Summer Games in tandem is rare for the IOC, and under normal circumstances, the 2028 host city would not be known until 2021. [nL8N1K24H9]

U.S.-based multinational companies Visa , Coca-Cola , Procter & Gamble , Dow Chemical Co and General Electric Co make up about half of the IOC's top sponsors program, which contributes more than $1 billion in each four-year cycle to the games.

All of these brands' agreements with the IOC expire in 2020 after the Summer Games in Tokyo.

At least one U.S.-based sponsor, which spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity, said that it had been eager for the Games to return to the United States after so many years.

"LA is a homegrown market, a U.S. market for these companies that gives a tremendous boost to the likelihood that they will continue to stay on as sponsors," said Rob Prazmark, chief executive of 21 Sports & Entertainment Marketing Group, who helped create the top sponsors program with the IOC.

The 2028 U.S. Summer Games, the first Summer Games in the United States since 1996, could be a factor in the renewal discussions with sponsors that are currently underway, said John Grady, a sports law professor at the University of South Carolina.

"Once you have an American city, it puts a flame under that U.S. brand. They have a reason to renew that otherwise didn't exist," Grady said.

With the next three games in Asia, some U.S.-based sponsors have bowed out of their official Olympic sponsorship deals, though the IOC has signed on new Asia-based sponsors such as Alibaba Group Holding Ltd .

McDonald's Corp ended a 41-year sponsorship deal with the IOC in June, and the U.S. Olympic Committee also has lost sponsors such as AT&T Inc and Citigroup Inc ahead of the 2018 Winter Games in South Korea. [nL3N1JD3QM]

Visa and Coca-Cola declined to comment beyond saying that their Olympic deals run until 2020. The IOC, P&G, Dow and GE did not respond to a request for comment. Intel, which signed on as a top sponsor in June, is locked in until 2024 and declined to comment.

Just knowing the location of Games 11 years out could also benefit U.S. broadcaster NBC, a unit of Comcast Corp , which is signed on until 2032, because it now has significant lead time to work with advertisers and deal with the changing ways people watch the Games over the internet, which has led to lower TV ratings.

An NBC spokesman, in a statement, called the next three host cities for the Summer Games, Tokyo, Paris and Los Angeles, "a U.S. broadcaster's dream."
