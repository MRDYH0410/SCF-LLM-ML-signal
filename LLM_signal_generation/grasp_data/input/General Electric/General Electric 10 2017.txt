By Stine Jacobsen and Christoph Steitz

COPENHAGEN/FRANKFURT, Nov 3 (Reuters) - The world's largest wind turbine makers said a proposed Republican tax bill that would cut support for the industry in the U.S. would put its businesses and future investment at risk, in a rare public criticism on Friday of government proposals.

Equipment makers operating in the world's second-largest wind turbine market have relied upon so-called production tax credits (PTC) agreed in 2015. In a new tax bill, unveiled late on Thursday, the PTC would be cut to 1.5 dollar cents per kilowatt hour (kWh) from 2.4 cents. [nL2N1N81U1]

Shares in Denmark's Vestas , the world's largest maker of wind turbines fell as much as 12 percent on Friday, due to its large exposure to the U.S. market, where it overtook GE last year in installed capacity. [nL5N1FV2TV]

Shares in Siemens Gamesa and Germany's Nordex , which also operate in the U.S. along with General Electric , were all down.

"Siemens Gamesa is disappointed in this step backwards. Our company is committed to this market and continues to invest in factories. A tax policy that has certainty is required for investment," the group said in an e-mailed statement.

Vestas said the proposal was "disappointing". GE said the group was carefully reviewing the details of the bill, which could still face changes as it needs to pass both the House of Representatives and the Senate.

SUPPORT WANES

The tax credit scheme was considered critical to enabling wind projects to compete with fossil fuel plants and the wind energy industry has said the proposed cuts put $50 billion in planned investment at risk.[nL2N1N8251]

The planned legislative step comes after long-standing industry concerns that Trump might curb support for renewable energy to promote coal and other fossil fuels instead.

"Even though Mr. Trump and team are not necessarily known for their adherence to the 'usual', we feel they are unlikely to be unaware of the wide-ranging consequences ... of the government essentially breaking open private contracts," Barclays wrote.

"After all, what would there be to stop them from retroactively doing so elsewhere too?"

Analysts at Goldman Sachs reckon that in this bear case scenario wind capacity expansion in the United States could fall sharply to a combined 10 gigawatts (GW) in 2019 and 2020, less than half the 26 GW it expects under its base case model.

The brokerage expects another consequence of the proposed PCT cut to be a fall in 2019 core earnings (EBITDA) at Vestas and Nordex of about 18 percent and 10 percent for Siemens Gamesa, whose market share has fallen in recent years. [nL8N1N74B7]

Shareholder sues GE after 'unacceptable' results hurt stock - Reuters News

{{20171102T164255.688+0000}}Shareholder sues GE after 'unacceptable' results hurt stockBy Jonathan Stempel

NEW YORK, Nov 2 (Reuters) - Two weeks after General Electric Co's new chief executive vowed to shed $20 billion of assets, a shareholder has sued the company for failing to divulge its problems sooner and posting quarterly results that were "unacceptable, to say the least."

In a proposed class-action lawsuit filed Wednesday night in the U.S. District Court in Manhattan, Jihad Hachem accused GE of securities fraud for concealing how falling demand, excess inventory and higher costs would cause it fall far short of its 2017 profit forecast, and led to an inflated stock price.

GE's market value slid $11 billion in the two trading days after the Boston-based company on Oct. 20 reported a third-quarter profit of 29 cents per share, below the 49 cents expected by analysts, and cut its 2017 profit forecast by one-third. [nL4N1MV3IM]

Several analysts shortly thereafter cut their ratings or share price targets for GE.

Other defendants include Chief Executive John Flannery, his predecessor Jeffrey Immelt, and former Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey Bornstein, who left that position this week.

"The complaint appears to focus on projections conveyed during earnings calls, which by definition, were forward-looking statements," GE spokeswoman Jennifer Friedman said in an email. "We intend to vigorously defend against these claims."

Shareholders have long been frustrated by GE, a maker of power plants, jet engines, medical devices and other industrial equipment and a member of the Dow Jones Industrial Average <.DJI>.

Through Wednesday, GE's share price had fallen 51 percent in the 16 years since Jack Welch, who oversaw much of its growth, passed the CEO baton to Immelt. Investors who reinvested dividends suffered a roughly 19 percent negative total return.

In contrast, the Standard & Poor's 500 <.SPX> rose about 133 percent over that time period.

Though Immelt had shed some units, Flannery said GE must now focus on its more promising businesses, and hold managers accountable for poor performance.

Flannery, a 30-year GE veteran who took over on Aug. 1, has made some early, symbolic cuts, including executive perks and the use of corporate jets.

In his complaint, Hachem accused the defendants of having from July 21 to Oct. 20, made materially false and misleading statements about its business in public statements and filings, and knew that doing so would mislead investors.

Hachem is represented by the law firms Glancy Prongay & Murray and Kirby McInerney and is seeking unspecified damages.

Securities fraud class actions have become more plentiful in federal courts after recent rulings in Delaware state courts dissuaded some plaintiffs from suing there.

Cornerstone Research said 226 such class actions were filed from January to June - the most since it began tracking filings in 1996. Most involve smaller declines in market value and less familiar companies than GE.

The case is Hachem v General Electric Inc et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 17-08457.

Siemens Gamesa needs more wind in its sails as Vestas stretches U.S. lead - Reuters News

* Vestas shares up 25 pct in 2017, Siemens Gamesa down 30 pct

By Christoph Steitz and Jose Elías Rodríguez

FRANKFURT/MADRID, Nov 1 (Reuters) - Siemens Gamesa has fallen behind biggest rival Vestas in the race for orders in the United States, hurt by a perceived lack of technology investment and a less centralised supply chain in the world's second-biggest wind turbine market.

The U.S. battleground is among the biggest for western turbine manufacturers, with the U.S. Energy Information Administration forecasting the addition of 6 gigawatts (GW) of capacity this year and a further 8 GW in 2018.

But things have not gone well for Siemens Gamesa since the merger that brought together Siemens' wind power division with rival Gamesa this year, even though it has described the United States as critical to its success.

The merger was aimed at giving the combined entity an edge in an increasingly competitive global market amid sector consolidation that saw Germany's Nordex buy the turbine unit of Spain's Acciona and General Electric take over France's Alstom.

"Siemens Gamesa has struggled to bring an attractive turbine to North America," said one senior industry adviser who declined to be named to protect business relations.

There is a view that the company has not done enough to improve its geared turbines, the adviser added.

Siemens has mainly sold gearbox-based turbines in the United States, where they are the preferred model, but its market share has dwindled in recent years while that of Vestas has increased steadily.

TURBINE SWITCH?

Complementing its portfolio and recouping lost market share in the United States were among the main drivers of the tie-up with Gamesa, which has a broader offering of gearbox-based turbines and is expected to fare better locally.

Siemens Gamesa will present its new strategy in February and sources close to the group said chances are that the joint venture may use more of Gamesa's turbines in the United States in future.

"After the merger the combined company has greater scale in the U.S., which will enable us to increase the wind turbine models and the volumes produced in the country," Siemens Gamesa said in an e-mailed statement.

Improvement is badly needed after the group announced the closure of its blade production operation in Canada, job cuts at its nacelle manufacturing plant in Kansas and writedowns on the U.S. business that caused a profit warning and management reshuffle. [nL8N1MR1LJ] [nL8N1MV4D9]

Siemens Gamesa did end a losing streak this week when it reported U.S. orders for 784 megawatts (MW) of capacity. It has also won an upgrade contract it says is worth 190 MW. [nFWN1N60CD]

But that is still less than half of what has been taken in by Vestas. The Danish company's order book is brimming with 2,086 MW in announced U.S. deals, close to a third of its total orders globally.

Fresh data from the American Wind Energy Association (AWEA) also shows that Vestas is much more successful than Siemens Gamesa in striking deals for projects. The association's latest quarterly market report said Vestas has taken 47 percent of the U.S. wind projects under construction or in advanced development that have announced a supplier.

Siemens Gamesa's share stood at 8 percent, or 1,258 MW, at the end of the third quarter.

'PEDESTRIAN' OUTLOOK

"The need to catch up will keep a lid on stock momentum for at least another couple of quarters," Barclays analysts said, forecasting a "pedestrian" outlook for 2018, which they expect to be issued along with fourth-quarter results on Nov. 6.

Barclays expects next year's sales to be down by more than a fifth from its forecast for 2017 numbers. The analysts are forecasting sales of 8.48 billion euros ($9.88 billion) in 2018, well below the 10.14 billion Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S estimate.

In the medium term, the merger is expected to help Siemens Gamesa to gain a stronger foothold in the United States and recover some of this year's 30 percent lost market value -- a far cry from the 25 percent gain for shares in Vestas.

Regardless of the actual products, Siemens Gamesa must also find a way to compete with the centralised supply chain that Vestas has built in the United States.

Vestas operates four factories making towers, blades and nacelles in the state of Colorado, located in the middle of the windy central plains corridor of the United States, which analysts say is a big advantage.

"We think the key is localising the product," said Chris Brown, president of Vestas's sales and service division in the United States and Canada.

Siemens Gamesa also has a strong presence in the region, with blade and nacelle production in Iowa and Kansas, though it does not identify the local providers from which it sources its towers. In the past it has bought towers from Broadwind Energy , which has production sites in Wisconsin and Texas.

"In a cut-throat competitive turbine pricing environment, the additional costs of transport can win or lose contracts," said Jesse Broehl, senior analyst at Navigant Research. ($1 = 0.8584 euros)

BREAKINGVIEWS-Wall Street loses in search for easy China wins - Reuters Breakingviews

{{20171101T035029.266+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-Wall Street loses in search for easy China wins(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are her own.) (Refiles to fix punctuation in third, fifth and sixth paragraphs, and to fix mispelling of "Cheniere Energy" in third paragraph.)

By Gina Chon

WASHINGTON, Nov 1 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Finance services firms look sidelined as the White House focuses on finding easy China wins. Energy and industrial companies like General Electric will have a chance to cozy up to Beijing's new leadership during U.S. President Donald Trump's upcoming Asia trip, but Wall Street isn't coming along. The U.S. business delegation's composition reflects Trump's desires to find low-hanging fruit deals to tout domestically, but low expectations for deeper concessions.

Trump arrives in Beijing next Wednesday, and the administration has been on the hunt for announcements that would make for photo ops or press releases during his visit. Companies applying to join a business delegation were queried on whether they had deals with China in the works that they could unveil while overseas, people familiar with the matter told Breakingviews. Billions of dollars in sales and investments benefitting the United States are expected. For example, one of the stars of the show will probably be Sinopec's <0386.HK> <600028.SS> 700-mile pipeline deal in Texas and the U.S. Virgin Islands, which could be worth about $7 billion in investments.

U.S. corporate delegates include GE, Honeywell , Thermo Fisher and Cheniere Energy . They arrive at an opportune time to meet Chinese leaders, who just wrapped up a major party congress and rolled out new leadership slate at the end of October.

However, the United States remains locked in contentious talks over improving market access for American firms in the People's Republic, including financial services. A senior administration official said Tuesday that progress has become more difficult. China is retrenching under President Xi Jinping, who has shown scant respect for market-based principles.

While there have been some advances on raising ownership equity caps in financial services, a deal has not been finalized, and the lack of representation by big names like Citi or Goldman Sachs on this trip suggests no major compromise is nigh. William Zarit, chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, said he hoped the one-off deals don't overshadow the need to push for structural changes.

Convincing Beijing to expose its domestic financial industry to more foreign competition is a tougher pitch than selling goods. The Trump administration is not indifferent to the financial sector's concerns, but low expectations for photo-op concessions have kept the industry at the back of the line this time around.

CONTEXT NEWS

- U.S. President Donald Trump will begin his 12-day Asia trip on Nov. 3, with scheduled stops in Japan, South Korea, China, Vietnam, and the Philippines. North Korea and economic relations are expected to be the main topics of discussion during the visit.

- Among the companies listed as participating in the delegation to China are General Electric, Honeywell, Thermo Fisher and Cherniere Energy. The Trump administration also hopes to announce a 700-mile pipeline deal with China Petroleum & Chemical Corp., known as Sinopec, in Texas and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The firm is expected to partner with Massachusetts-based ArcLight Capital and Connecticut-based Freepoint Commodities.

GUIDE TO EU MERGER PROCESS

DEADLINES:

The European Commission has 25 working days after a deal is filed for a first-stage review. It may extend that by 10 working days to 35 working days, to consider either a company's proposed remedies or an EU member state's request to handle the case.

Most mergers win approval but occasionally the Commission opens a detailed second-stage investigation for up to 90 additional working days, which it may extend to 105 working days.

SIMPLIFIED:

Under the simplified procedure, the Commission announces the clearance of uncontroversial first-stage mergers without giving any reason for its decision. Cases may be reclassified as non-simplified - that is, ordinary first-stage reviews - until they are approved.

By Michael Martina

BEIJING, Oct 27 (Reuters) - U.S. energy and commodities firms will make up a major part of a business delegation visiting Beijing at the same time as U.S. President Donald Trump goes to China in November, according to an initial list seen by Reuters.

Prominent technology and financial companies are mostly absent from the list, reflecting the slow progress Washington has made in opening up China in those sectors.

Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, who will lead the 29 companies that have been approved to travel on the trade mission starting on Nov. 8, said they will be looking for "immediate results" and "tangible agreements".

But, speaking at the Paley International Council Summit in New York on Wednesday, he acknowledged that market access, intellectual property rights, and tariffs are more complex and will take a longer time to negotiate. [nL2N1N01DW]

Some major industrial companies - General Electric Co , Honeywell International Inc and Boeing Co - are among the companies on the current list.

Whether executives from all the named companies end up attending could be subject to agreements or deals being negotiated in time for the visit, according to multiple sources whose companies are involved.

One of the few tech companies going with Trump is Qualcomm , which earns about half of its global revenue in China and faces a series of tricky legal issues there, including a lawsuit with Apple and the Chinese government's review of its pending $38 billion merger with NXP Semiconductors . Qualcomm said its CEO, Steve Mollenkopf, planned to attend.

An industry source told Reuters tech firms were reluctant to go, given China market access issues, the unpredictability of the Trump administration, and a "Section 301" U.S. trade investigation alleging Chinese abuses of intellectual property.

"(These) issues are extremely sensitive for tech companies said another source in the U.S. business community.

"Very few want to stick their heads up and be perceived as complaining directly, and even fewer trust this White House to do anything helpful on their issues," he said.

Particularly galling to foreign tech firms are a slate of new national security and cyber security regulations, which mandate companies store crucial data within China and pass security reviews they argue could put business secrets at risk. [nL4N1MR3IY]

TESTY RELATIONSHIP

Trump, a real estate magnate who had never before held public office, has had a sometimes testy relationship with corporate America since taking office in January.

He disbanded two high-profile business advisory councils in August after several chief executives quit in protest over his controversial remarks on racist violence in Charlottesville.

U.S. industry sources say it has been years since a major business delegation has gone to China during a U.S. presidential visit.

Calls for such a delegation during Trump's visit originated in the China-based U.S. business community, according to several sources, who saw a need to match growing efforts by Germany, France and Britain to promote their nation's firms in China.

Trump, who has frequently cited the substantial U.S. trade deficit with China as a reason why Washington should take more protectionist measures, was an easy sell on incorporating a group of executives into the visit, according to the sources.

Nonetheless, some trade analysts say China has done a good job of taming Trump's combative trade impulses. They worry the U.S. administration will be willing to paper over market access concerns during the visit in its focus on getting Beijing to take action against North Korea over its nuclear and missile programmes.

Beijing agreed in May to grant limited U.S. access in financial services in bilateral talks aimed at reducing China's trade surplus with the United States which reached $347 billion last year, but business groups complained it was too little, too late. [nL1N1IE179]

William Zarit, the chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, told Reuters he didn't expect Trump to push hard on market access issues on this trip.

"Unfortunately, I think the Chinese aren't going to start to respond until they feel some pain," Zarit said. "We're all wondering what that is going to mean."

Scott Kennedy, at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank in Washington, said Beijing has deflected commercial issues "using a combination of leadership flattery, coaxing up to his (Trump's) family, token concessions, adjusting their level of help on North Korea sanctions, and threats of retaliation should the U.S. take any unilateral action".

GAS EXPORTS

Agribusiness and energy firms dominate the delegation list. They include Archer Daniels Midland Co (ADM) , one of the world's largest grain companies, and chemicals and agribusiness giant DowDuPont .

Ten of the companies are involved in gas or other energy fields, including Cheniere Energy Inc , which operates the only U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) export terminal, three that are building new projects, and Freepoint Commodities, founded and run by David Messer, who led power utility Sempra's vaunted commodities division.[L2N1N109T]

Their presence underscores the U.S. ambition to sell more of its excess gas abroad as its shale revolution contributes to a global LNG glut.

Others on the list who confirmed plans to attend include GE, Houston-based LNG company Delfin Midstream, SolarReserve, Stine Seed Company, biotech firm Drylet, wastewater-processing firm Viroment and the U.S. Soybean Export Council.

Bell Helicopter and crane-maker Terex Corp are also on the delegation list. Honeywell, DowDuPont and ADM did not respond immediately to a request for comment and Freepoint, Cheniere, Sempra Energy , and Texas LNG Brownsville LLC said they had no comment.

Boeing told Reuters it does not yet have plans to send anyone but that may change. Alaska Gasline Development Corp said it had no information to release.

The U.S. Commerce Department, which is leading the delegation, has not yet issued its own list.

At least one of the companies on the list tried to distance itself from Trump. SolarReserve told Reuters in a statement that it had been selected to participate in the commerce department's delegation but stressed that "we are not part of the business delegation travelling to China with President Trump."

TOUTING EXISTING DEALS

One U.S. official told Reuters on condition of anonymity that Trump will tout deals announced during the trip, but they would have likely happened regardless.

The risk is that commercial deals "distract from long-term political solutions" to trade issues, the official said.

Evan Medeiros, former President Barack Obama's top Asia adviser, made a similar point in Washington. Beijing would avoid seriously addressing the "underlying systemic problems" such as market access for high-tech goods and intellectual property protection during the visit, he predicted.

GE Board did not know about CEO's extra plane -WSJ - Reuters News

{{20171029T180737.074+0000}}GE Board did not know about CEO's extra plane -WSJOct 29 (Reuters) - General Electric Co executives did not tell the multinational conglomerate's board until October about a spare business jet that routinely flew for its now-retired chief executive, the Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday, citing people familiar with the matter.

Executives also did not tell directors that the maker of aircraft engines, locomotives, power plants and other industrial equipment had received an internal complaint about the jet several years ago, the publication said, also citing people familiar with the matter.

The Wall Street Journal reported on Oct. 18 that former Chairman and CEO Jeff Immelt had an extra aircraft follow his corporate jet on some overseas trips during much of his 16 years in the role. GE executives first informed the board about the practice after the report, the publication said.

GE told its directors the company had scaled back the practice in mid-2014 and would continue to use the backup plane only in limited situations, such as going to risky locations, the Journal reported.

Immelt told the Journal on Thursday that he did not know the spare plane was flying.

Immelt, 61, stepped down as CEO on Aug. 1 and planned to continue as chairman through Dec. 31. But John Flannery was named chairman on Oct. 2. [nL2N1MD24Z]

Flannery has grounded GE's corporate aircraft fleet to cut costs and initiated a new policy under which executives will fly on commercial or charter flights, the Journal said.

U.S. oil rig count rises this week but falls for a 3rd mth -Baker Hughes - 路透新闻

{{20171027T171537.709+0000}}U.S. oil rig count rises this week but falls for a 3rd mth -Baker HughesOct 27 (Reuters) - The U.S. rig count fell for a third month
in a row even as drillers added a rig this week for the first
time in October, extending the drilling decline that started
after crude prices fell below $50 a barrel this summer.

Drillers added one oil rig in the week to Oct. 27, bringing
the total count up to 737, General Electric Co's  Baker
Hughes energy services firm said in its closely followed report
on Friday.

For the month, the rig count fell by 13, the biggest decline
since May 2016. It was also the first time since May 2016 that
the number of rigs dropped for a third month in a row.

The rig count, an early indicator of future output, is still
much higher than a year ago when only 441 rigs were active after
energy companies boosted spending plans in the second half of
2016 as crude recovered from a two-year price crash.

The recovery in drilling lasted 14 months before stalling in
August, September and October after some producers started
trimming spending plans when prices turned softer over the
summer.

ConocoPhillips  this week lowered the amount of
capital it expects to spend in 2017 by about 10 percent to $4.5
billion. In 2016, the company's capital expenditures were $4.9
billion. [nL2N1N10GW]

Despite plans to cut spending by some exploration and
production (E&P) companies, U.S. financial services firm Cowen &
Co's capital expenditure tracking increased this week. The 64
E&Ps it tracks planned to increase drilling and completion
spending by an average of 50 percent in 2017 from 2016. That was
up from 49 percent in the prior report.

That expected 2017 spending increase followed an estimated
48 percent decline in 2016 and a 34 percent decline in 2015,
Cowen said.

U.S. crude futures  have averaged almost $50 a barrel
so far in 2017, easily topping last year's $43.47 average.
Looking ahead, futures were trading above $53 for the balance of
the year  and calendar 2018 .

Exxon Mobil Corp  said on Friday it will grow its
Permian rig count from 20 currently to 30 by end of 2018 as it
aims to boost output 45 percent a year through 2020.
[nL2N1N20TB]

Analysts at Simmons & Co, energy specialists at U.S.
investment bank Piper Jaffray, this week revised slightly
downward their forecast for the total oil and natural gas rig
count, now expecting it to average 874 in 2017, 923 in 2018 and
1,072 in 2019. Last week, it forecast 877 in 2017, 939 in 2018
and 1,087 in 2019.

That compares with an average of 867 oil and gas rigs so far
in 2017, 509 in 2016 and 978 in 2015. Most rigs produce both oil
and gas.

With 909 total oil and gas rigs in operation now, that means
Simmons analysts expect the number of rigs will decline through
the balance of this year before rising next year.

U.S. production is expected to rise to 9.2 million barrels
per day (bpd) in 2017 and a record 9.9 million bpd in 2018 from
8.9 million bpd in 2016, according to federal energy projections
this month. [EIA/M]

EXCLUSIVE-Energy, not tech or finance, in CEO line-up for Trump's China visit - Reuters News

{{20171027T111450.110+0000}}EXCLUSIVE-Energy, not tech or finance, in CEO line-up for Trump's China visit* Tech firms limited by market access barriers

* China world's third-largest gas buyer

* Trump quick to back delegation proposed by U.S. industry

* Deals could distract from progress on trade frictions - analysts

By Michael Martina

BEIJING, Oct 27 (Reuters) - U.S. energy and commodities firms will make up a major part of a business delegation visiting Beijing at the same time as U.S. President Donald Trump goes to China in November, according to an initial list seen by Reuters.

Prominent technology and financial companies are mostly absent from the list, reflecting the slow progress Washington has made in opening up China in those sectors.

Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, who will lead the 29 companies that have been approved to travel on the trade mission starting on Nov. 8, said they will be looking for "immediate results" and "tangible agreements".

But, speaking at the Paley International Council Summit in New York on Wednesday, he acknowledged that market access, intellectual property rights, and tariffs are more complex and will take a longer time to negotiate. [nL2N1N01DW]

Some major industrial companies - General Electric Co , Honeywell International Inc and Boeing Co - are among the companies on the current list.

Whether executives from all the named companies end up attending could be subject to agreements or deals being negotiated in time for the visit, according to multiple sources whose companies are involved.

One of the few tech companies going with Trump is Qualcomm , which earns about half of its global revenue in China and faces a series of tricky legal issues there, including a lawsuit with Apple and the Chinese government's review of its pending $38 billion merger with NXP Semiconductors . Qualcomm said its CEO, Steve Mollenkopf, planned to attend.

An industry source told Reuters tech firms were reluctant to go, given China market access issues, the unpredictability of the Trump administration, and a "Section 301" U.S. trade investigation alleging Chinese abuses of intellectual property.

"(These) issues are extremely sensitive for tech companies said another source in the U.S. business community.

"Very few want to stick their heads up and be perceived as complaining directly, and even fewer trust this White House to do anything helpful on their issues," he said.

Particularly galling to foreign tech firms are a slate of new national security and cyber security regulations, which mandate companies store crucial data within China and pass security reviews they argue could put business secrets at risk. [nL4N1MR3IY]

TESTY RELATIONSHIP

Trump, a real estate magnate who had never before held public office, has had a sometimes testy relationship with corporate America since taking office in January.

He disbanded two high-profile business advisory councils in August after several chief executives quit in protest over his controversial remarks on racist violence in Charlottesville.

U.S. industry sources say it has been years since a major business delegation has gone to China during a U.S. presidential visit.

Calls for such a delegation during Trump's visit originated in the China-based U.S. business community, according to several sources, who saw a need to match growing efforts by Germany, France and Britain to promote their nation's firms in China.

Trump, who has frequently cited the substantial U.S. trade deficit with China as a reason why Washington should take more protectionist measures, was an easy sell on incorporating a group of executives into the visit, according to the sources.

Nonetheless, some trade analysts say China has done a good job of taming Trump's combative trade impulses. They worry the U.S. administration will be willing to paper over market access concerns during the visit in its focus on getting Beijing to take action against North Korea over its nuclear and missile programmes.

Beijing agreed in May to grant limited U.S. access in financial services in bilateral talks aimed at reducing China's trade surplus with the United States which reached $347 billion last year, but business groups complained it was too little, too late. [nL1N1IE179]

William Zarit, the chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, told Reuters he didn't expect Trump to push hard on market access issues on this trip.

"Unfortunately, I think the Chinese aren't going to start to respond until they feel some pain," Zarit said. "We're all wondering what that is going to mean."

Scott Kennedy, at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank in Washington, said Beijing has deflected commercial issues "using a combination of leadership flattery, coaxing up to his (Trump's) family, token concessions, adjusting their level of help on North Korea sanctions, and threats of retaliation should the U.S. take any unilateral action".

GAS EXPORTS

Agribusiness and energy firms dominate the delegation list. They include Archer Daniels Midland Co (ADM) , one of the world's largest grain companies, and chemicals and agribusiness giant DowDuPont .

Ten of the companies are involved in gas or other energy fields, including Cheniere Energy Inc , which operates the only U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) export terminal, three that are building new projects, and Freepoint Commodities, founded and run by David Messer, who led power utility Sempra's vaunted commodities division.[L2N1N109T]

Their presence underscores the U.S. ambition to sell more of its excess gas abroad as its shale revolution contributes to a global LNG glut.

Others on the list who confirmed plans to attend include GE, Houston-based LNG company Delfin Midstream, SolarReserve, Stine Seed Company, biotech firm Drylet, wastewater-processing firm Viroment and the U.S. Soybean Export Council.

Bell Helicopter and crane-maker Terex Corp are also on the delegation list. Honeywell, DowDuPont and ADM did not respond immediately to a request for comment and Freepoint, Cheniere, Sempra Energy , and Texas LNG Brownsville LLC said they had no comment.

Boeing told Reuters it does not yet have plans to send anyone but that may change. Alaska Gasline Development Corp said it had no information to release.

The U.S. Commerce Department, which is leading the delegation, has not yet issued its own list.

At least one of the companies on the list tried to distance itself from Trump. SolarReserve told Reuters in a statement that it had been selected to participate in the commerce department's delegation but stressed that "we are not part of the business delegation travelling to China with President Trump."

TOUTING EXISTING DEALS

One U.S. official told Reuters on condition of anonymity that Trump will tout deals announced during the trip, but they would have likely happened regardless.

The risk is that commercial deals "distract from long-term political solutions" to trade issues, the official said.

Evan Medeiros, former President Barack Obama's top Asia adviser, made a similar point in Washington. Beijing would avoid seriously addressing the "underlying systemic problems" such as market access for high-tech goods and intellectual property protection during the visit, he predicted.

"The Chinese will be happy to buy a lot of American goods. That's what they know Trump wants – big export numbers," he said, predicting that China would announce big business deals and allow the president to tout them during his visit.

UPDATE 1-France's Safran revises up revenue target as Q3 growth quickens - Reuters News

{{20171027T091753.931+0000}}UPDATE 1-France's Safran revises up revenue target as Q3 growth quickens(Adds more detail, CEO comment, shares)

PARIS, Oct 27 (Reuters) - French aerospace company Safran on Friday raised its revenue forecast for 2017, after growth in its civil engines business and higher engine deliveries for the Rafale combat jet produced stronger than expected third-quarter sales.

The maker of aircraft engines, landing gear and military optronics said adjusted revenue grew 8.5 percent to 3.82 billion euros ($4.4 billion) in the quarter. Sales rose 11.3 percent on an underlying basis.

The widely-watched civil aftermarket grew 10.4 percent in dollar terms in the first nine months, including 14.5 percent year-on-year growth in the third quarter.

Safran's shares rose 1.7 percent, outpacing the French CAC40 <.FCHI> index which rose 0.9 percent.

The French company raised its forecast for adjusted revenue growth in 2017 to 3 percent from 2-3 percent, and confirmed other targets, including operating income close to 2016 levels.

But it said its 2017 operating earnings could be held back by 350-400 million euros in costs from a switch to the new LEAP jetliner engine, up slightly from 300-350 million euros.

This includes provision for the cost of dealing with the premature loss of a special coating on part of some of the engines, Chief Executive Philippe Petitcolin said.

Ensuring a smooth ramp-up in the new production of the new engine, co-developed with General Electric for the most popular Airbus and Boeing jets, is Safran's biggest priority.

Safran said it was meeting targets for the LEAP engine, produced by the Safran-GE joint-venture CFM International, but softened language used to describe its goal.

In April, it predicted around 500 LEAP deliveries in 2017. Safran and GE talked in the summer of 450-500 deliveries and in its latest release, Safran said it was on course for "over 450".

"We are still in line and I don't see as of today why we could not do that, so yes we are going to deliver more than 450 engines in 2017," Petitcolin said.

GE said last week CFM had delivered 111 LEAP engines in the third quarter including 23 retrofitted for Boeing following a turbine disk problem in May. Safran said in July it had found a quality issue with some engines for Airbus.

Safran also said it was working on a new timetable for the Silvercrest business jet engine, whose certification has been delayed after a development glitch.

Petitcolin told reporters he expected the delay to last a matter of months but could not yet give a new date for engine certification, previously planned for 2018.

"There are several options and scenarios and we working to minimise the impact," he said.

Dassault Aviation said this month that its Falcon 5X jet, which had already been delayed to 2020, would be postponed again after Safran identified problems with the high-pressure compressor.

Safran CEO says Silvercrest engine delay to last months - Reuters News

{{20171027T055430.872+0000}}Safran CEO says Silvercrest engine delay to last monthsPARIS, Oct 27 (Reuters) - Safran expects the latest development delay in its Silvercrest business-jet engine to last a matter of months, although it is still assessing the precise schedule, Chief Executive Philippe Petitcolin said on Friday.

Dassault Aviation said this month that its Falcon 5X jet would be postponed after Safran identified problems with the engine's high-pressure compressor during flight testing.

Petitcolin told reporters Safran was in discussions with Dassault to agree a new schedule. The engine had been due for certification in 2018, but he declined to estimate a new date.

Speaking after posting better-than-expected third quarter sales, Petitcolin said a previous round of technical problems, identified when the Silvercrest engine programme was reset two years ago, had all been resolved.

He said Safran's key priority remained the ramp-up of production for the LEAP engine, co-developed with General Electric for Airbus and Boeing narrowbody aircraft through their CFM International venture.

Safran said earlier that its 2017 operating earnings faced headwinds of 350-400 million euros from the transition to the new engine. Petitcolin said the previous working estimate had been 300-350 million euros.

He also said talks continued with Airbus about the future of production of 'nacelles', or engine housings, for the A320neo.

Airbus has said it is bringing in-house work on nacelles made by United Technologies for jets powered by Pratt & Whitney engines, and that it is considering doing the same for nacelles made by Safran for CFM-powered A320neo aircraft.

Petitcolin reaffirmed plans to launch a formal offer for Zodiac Aerospace by end-year and to close an agreed deal to buy the seats maker in 2018.

Aerospace group Safran revises up revenue target as Q3 growth quickens - Reuters News

{{20171027T050302.482+0000}}Aerospace group Safran revises up revenue target as Q3 growth quickensPARIS, Oct 27 (Reuters) - French aerospace company Safran raised its revenue forecast for 2017, after sales growth accelerated in the third quarter.

The maker of aircraft engines, landing gear and military optronics said adjusted revenue grew 8.5 percent to 3.815 billion euros ($4.4 billion) in the quarter, led by its propulsion business as well as a pick-up in its defence business. Sales rose 11.3 percent on an underlying basis.

Safran raised its forecast for adjusted revenue growth in 2017 to 3 percent from 2-3 percent, and confirmed other targets including operating income close to the 2016 level.

But it said its 2017 operating earnings faced headwinds of 350-400 million euros from the transition to the new LEAP jetliner engine: a figure which it described as "slightly higher" than previous assumptions.

The widely-watched civil aftermarket grew 10.4 percent in dollar terms in the first nine months, including 14.5 percent year-on-year growth in the third quarter.

Safran said it was meeting targets for the new LEAP aircraft engine, co-produced with General Electric through their CFM venture, but softened language used to describe its goal.

In April, it had predicted around 500 LEAP deliveries in 2017. Safran and GE talked in the summer of 450-500 deliveries and in its latest release, Safran said it was on course for "over 450".

GE said last week CFM had delivered 111 LEAP engines in the third quarter including 23 retrofitted for Boeing following a turbine disk problem earlier in the year. Safran said in July it had found a quality issue with some LEAP engines for Airbus .

Safran said it was working on a new timetable for the Silvercrest business jet engine, whose certification has been delayed by extra development work.

Dassault Aviation said this month that its Falcon 5X jet, which had already been delayed to 2020, would be postponed again after Safran identified problems with the high-pressure compressor.

Apple, GE release app-making tools for industrial internet - Reuters News

{{20171027T004252.422+0000}}Apple, GE release app-making tools for industrial internetBy Alwyn Scott

SAN FRANCISCO, Oct 26 (Reuters) - Apple Inc and General Electric Co released app-making tools on Thursday tailored to GE's Predix platform for connecting power plants, jet engines and other industrial equipment to the internet.

The software development kit marks the first tangible result of a partnership the companies announced last week. It extends Predix's industrial internet capabilities to iPads and iPhones, so factory workers, pilots or service technicians can use familiar devices to do more sophisticated tasks.

Apple will be tapping into the growing demand for industrial-internet capabilities, which can improve the performance of factory machines, predict when wind turbines will fail and help technicians fix machinery, making Apple's devices relevant in the industrial arena.

While GE will gain access to more than 13 million programmers who build apps for Apple's iOS operating system, said William Howard, principal product manager for GE Power's digital unit.

App developers can use of all of iOS's capabilities, including the augmented reality feature included in latest iOS version, said Susan Prescott, vice president of product marketing at Apple.

Howard said Apple approached GE about the partnership about a year ago, and work on the development kit accelerated in the last six months. Apple said it has other industrial internet partnerships with IBM , Cisco Systems Inc , SAP SE , Deloitte and Accenture.

UPDATE 1-GE explores divesting its transportation, healthcare IT businesses-sources - Reuters News

{{20171026T164221.182+0000}}UPDATE 1-GE explores divesting its transportation, healthcare IT businesses-sources(Adds more details about the assets)

By Carl O'Donnell and Greg Roumeliotis

Oct 26 (Reuters) - General Electric Co is exploring divesting its transportation and healthcare information technology businesses, as it seeks to reshape its portfolio under new Chief Executive John Flannery, people familiar with the matter said.

Such a move would help GE to meet more than half of its stated goal of shedding more than $20 billion worth of assets, the sources said this week. There is no certainty that GE will proceed with these divestitures, the sources added.

The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. GE declined to comment.

The move would make GE the latest U.S. industrial conglomerate to go ahead with asset divestitures after Honeywell International Inc announced earlier this month it would part with some of its businesses by creating two new publicly listed companies. [nL2N1ML0CV]

Ed Garden, a founding partner at activist investor Trian Fund Management who was recently given a board seat at GE, has also acted as a catalyst for change.

GE is looking to bounce back after what Flannery earlier this month called horrible results in the third quarter. He has argued that GE's strong businesses are being held back by others that "drain investment and management resources without the prospect for a substantial reward."

GE's transportation business, which generated revenue of $4.7 billion in 2016, manufactures freight and passenger trains, marine diesel engines and mining equipment, among other products.

GE's healthcare information technology business, which would likely have to be broken up into separate chunks in the event of a sale, assists with electronic medical records, healthcare workforce management, and hospital revenue cycle management. Some of its better known brands include API Healthcare, which it acquired in 2014, and Centricity EMR.

The business is part of GE's sprawling healthcare business, which had revenue last year of $18.3 billion and spans magnetic imaging, medical diagnostics and drug discovery.

GE has taken several actions to prune its portfolio over the years, shedding plastics, NBCUniversal and most of its GE Capital business. It also combined its oilfield services business with Baker Hughes .

Last week, GE cut its profit forecast for the full year to $1.05 to $1.10 a share, from $1.60 to $1.70 previously, and said it would generate only about $7 billion in cash from operations, down from $12 billion to $14 billion it had forecast earlier. It left its dividend unchanged.

Weak performance in GE's power and oil and gas businesses, goodwill impairment and higher-than-expected restructuring costs were the main causes of the profit decline. [nL4N1MV3IM]

U.S. wind concerns ease as Trump cabinet calls on Denmark to help boost offshore output - Reuters News

{{20171026T161239.081+0000}}U.S. wind concerns ease as Trump cabinet calls on Denmark to help boost offshore outputBy Stine Jacobsen

COPENHAGEN, Oct 26 (Reuters) - The United States signed a deal with Denmark on Thursday to expand cooperation on offshore wind power, giving a boost Europe's biggest green energy players.

Danish companies DONG Energy and Vestas had feared the nascent U.S. offshore wind sector would be stymied after President Trump vowed to revive the coal industry, challenged climate-change science and blasted renewable energy as expensive and dependent on government subsidies. [nL8N1ME01D]

But both companies now say the Trump administration is increasingly looking at Europe's experience as it seeks to kick-start the sector.

"We see some positive initiatives coming out of the administration in Washington," the head of DONG's U.S. business, Thomas Brostroem, told Reuters. He pointed to measures being taken on a federal level to streamline and speed up the process to obtain permits to build offshore wind farms.

"They've been really receptive to talk to European countries and developers to get know-how from the past decades," he said.

The U.S. offshore wind sector, which has lagged behind Europe, is at a critical juncture, with the first large-scale offshore wind auction in Massachusetts coming up in December.

But to gain traction, industry executives and experts say the United States will need to replicate the dramatic cost cuts which Europe has implemented.

JOBS, JOBS, JOBS

"Something that is important for the new administration is jobs, jobs, jobs and that is something that will come from the supply chain around the turbines," Adam Thomsen, head of U.S. growth implementation at MHI Vestas, told Reuters, but declined to quantify any numbers.

MHI Vestas is a joint venture between Vestas and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries <7011.T>, which makes offshore wind turbines and whose rivals include Siemens Gamesa and General Electrics .

Vestas already produces onshore turbines at four factories in the United States, but large offshore turbine parts like the nacelles, towers and rotors would be made at existing facilities in Europe, said Thomsen.

"We need a much more stable market development before we can talk factories."

Record low subsidy prices in Europe, home to more than 12 gigawatts (GW) of offshore wind, has increased confidence in the sector but also prompted European developers to search for new revenue streams in the United States and China.

"It is a huge scoop that we now get a formal cooperation with the Trump administration on offshore wind," Danish climate and energy minister Lars Chr Lilleholt told Reuters.

Thomsen said that around 2 GW of installed capacity would be realistic by 2020 compared to the 30 megawatts (MW) currently installed, and that by 2030, the annual capacity expansion could be between 500 MW and 1 GW.

"There's no doubt that this is a sleeping giant," he added.

UPDATE 2-GE's CEO sees more partnerships ahead for digital business - Reuters News

{{20171026T013001.837+0000}}UPDATE 2-GE's CEO sees more partnerships ahead for digital business(Adds CEO comments on detail about GE's strategy)

By Alwyn Scott

SAN FRANCISCO, Oct 25 (Reuters) - General Electric Co will use more alliances to build its digital-industrial business in coming years, Chief Executive Officer John Flannery said on Wednesday, suggesting the industrial conglomerate will curb spending in that area.

GE is investing about $2.1 billion in GE Digital this year, and executives had said that amount would fall in 2018.

Flannery on Wednesday made his first direct remarks about the digital strategy since he became CEO on Aug. 1. He has begun slashing costs in other areas, including reducing staff, grounding corporate jets and axing the "Maserati benefit" of corporate cars for about 600 senior executives.

Flannery is due to unveil new financial targets on Nov. 13 and is under heavy pressure to turn GE around after the company's third-quarter earnings and cash flow badly missed targets. GE stock is down 32 percent so far this year, while the S&P 500 index is up 14 percent,

GE's digital strategy is built around a cloud-based software platform, known as Predix, that connects factories, power plants and other industrial equipment to computers that improve performance and predict outages.

But Predix's limited capabilities and performance problems have caused GE to lose out to competitors such as Siemens AG and startups such as Uptake and C3IOT. [nL1N1KQ1UU]

Flannery said on Wednesday that GE will focus on selling Predix in its own businesses: energy, oil-and-gas, aviation, healthcare, transportation and mining, as Reuters reported in August.

In other markets, "We're going to be more selective ... and do it largely through partners," Flannery said at GE's annual Minds + Machines conference.

Gary Mintchell, chief executive of The Manufacturing Connection, an industrial-internet-focused research and consulting company, said GE's strategy of using partners reflects the company's realization that "they can't build their own ecosystem."

GE said it was expanding its partnership with Microsoft Corp , to provide access to Microsoft applications on Predix. The specifics largely duplicated what the companies said when they first announced the deal in July 2016. [nL2N1N0124]

GE said Predix will be available on Azure in North America on Nov. 30, months later than the original target of the second quarter. Predix will still be available on Amazon.com Inc's Amazon Web Services cloud platform, GE said.

GE Digital's chief executive, Bill Ruh, on Wednesday noted a partnership with Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co . GE also is linking Predix with Apple Inc's IOS operating system for iPhones and iPads.

Patrick Franklin, vice president in charge of Predix, said there was still room to improve Predix after the company held a two-month time-out this year to fix bugs, but the platform was showing near-100 percent stability.

"We are paying careful attention to quality," he said, referring to the delay in deploying Predix on Azure.

GE executives said the company is focusing on developing apps for Predix to boost sales. GE plans to bundle applications for equipment monitoring and service technicians, both of which it bought last year.

GE said orders for Predix were rising sharply. Some customers at the event echoed that view. U.S. utility Exelon Corp , for instance, said it is rolling out Predix to its nuclear, gas, wind and other power plants after a two-year pilot of the system showed it worked as advertised, said Brian Hoff, director of corporate strategy and innovation at Exelon.

"If it didn't hit its targets, we wouldn't be moving forward," Hoff said.

UPDATE 2-Argentina's YPF to invest $21.5 bln from 2018 to 2022 - Reuters News

{{20171025T233122.178+0000}}UPDATE 2-Argentina's YPF to invest $21.5 bln from 2018 to 2022(Adds comments from interview with executives starting in paragraph 4)

By Juliana Castilla and Christian Plumb

BUENOS AIRES/NEW YORK, Oct 25 (Reuters) - Argentina's state-controlled energy company YPF plans to invest $21.5 billion in the country from 2018 to 2022 and increase oil production by 26 percent as it considers reshuffling its generation, distribution and refinery assets.

Investment in Argentina's energy sector by companies in partnership with YPF is projected at $8.5 billion during the period, bringing total expected investment to $30 billion through 2022, the company said.

By the end of that time Argentina's largest oil and gas producer expects to have drilled 1,600 new oil and natural gas wells, it said.

YPF executives said in an interview in New York that part of the $8.5 billion will come in the form of a capital injection into the company's power generation business, which will be spun off as part of the process.

"You might see hopefully soon a new partner coming into our YPF power subsidiary – we are not in a position to disclose who," said Chief Financial Officer Daniel Gonzalez.

Press reports have previously said General Electric Co is the most likely partner for the business.

The power sector transaction is just one of several the company may consider in coming years including a potential sale of its stake in gas distributor Metrogas , for which Citi has been mandated to consider "strategic options," he said.

YPF will also be closely watching Brazilian state-owned cohort Petrobras' plan to spin off its fuel distribution arm in the coming months as well as its potential deals in refining and other areas.

"We may look at a number of opportunities of reshuffling the portfolio across different business lines," YPF Chairman Miguel Gutierrez told Reuters.

YPF is the main company exploring the shale formation of Vaca Muerta in Patagonia, which Argentina is counting on to help it become a net oil exporter after years of running an expensive energy deficit.

The formation is expected to keep drawing interest from oil majors as well as private equity firms and may also see investments from several independent oil and gas companies, which explore for and produce crude, but do not refine it, Gutierrez said.

"They are starting to knock on the door and understand the situation," he said.

Attracting investment to develop Vaca Muerta is a priority for Argentina's business-friendly President Mauricio Macri, who took office in December 2015. Macri has implemented a number of free-market reforms, including the reduction of costly subsidies for home gas and electricity consumption.

GE, Microsoft to announce deeper industrial internet partnership  - Reuters News

{{20171025T153305.515+0000}}GE, Microsoft to announce deeper industrial internet partnership By Alwyn Scott

SAN FRANCISCO, Oct 25 (Reuters) - General Electric Co and Microsoft Corp are due to announce a deeper partnership involving GE's Predix industrial internet platform and Microsoft's Azure cloud platform, a senior GE executive said.

The agreement broadly expands integration of Microsoft's cloud software with GE's Predix applications, Bill Ruh, Chief Executive of GE Digital, told Reuters late on Tuesday.

Predix is a software platform developed by GE that connects industrial equipment like jet engines and power plants to computers that can predict failures and reduce operating costs.

The partnership, due to be announced on Wednesday by GE Chief Executive Officer John Flannery and Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella, comes days after GE announced a partnership with Apple Inc . It shows GE's ability to forge significant new deals with its industrial internet system after a rocky period with Predix. [nL2N1LD0IV]

The joint effort is focused initially on oil-and-gas and mining companies, but would also be applicable to other companies that run Microsoft software, which includes the vast majority of industrial companies, Ruh said. He declined to provide further details.

BUZZ-Dow's October rise puts rivals in rear view - Reuters News

** Price-weighted DJI benefiting this month from gains of at least 9 pct from Wal-Mart Stores , 3M Co , Johnson & Johnson and Caterpillar

** Meanwhile, General Electric has been the worst performer in the Dow, down more than 10 pct in Oct amid a gloomy profit report last Fri; but GE's share price of $21.50 is the lowest in the Dow, minimizing its impact on the index

** "Investors are slowly taking profits in the momentum leadership names in both the Technology and Consumer Discretionary sectors," Michael O'Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading, said in a note on Tues. "Those funds need to rotate into large cap names that can digest the flows."

** YTD, tech-heavy Nasdaq Comp still the leader, rising 21.3 pct vs 18.1 pct rise for the DJI and 13.9 pct gain for the SPX

U.S. industrial shares hit record high as earnings shine - Reuters News

{{20171024T153113.312+0000}}U.S. industrial shares hit record high as earnings shineBy Lewis Krauskopf

NEW YORK, Oct 24 (Reuters) - U.S. industrial sector roared to a record high on Tuesday following strong financial results from stalwarts 3M Co and Caterpillar Inc , even as shares of General Electric Co continued to struggle.

The S&P 500 industrials index <.SPLRCI> rose 0.7 percent, leading all major groups. Other sectors that are particularly dependent on economic growth, such as financials <.SPSY> and materials <.SPLRCM>, also gained.

Results showed a rebound for industrial companies whose shares have been under pressure the past couple of years as many of their key markets, such as energy, mining and agriculture, have struggled, said Edward Jones industrials analyst Matt Arnold.

"What we are seeing in 2017 is a significant snap back in demand. It is driving higher sales at a time when these companies have done a lot to lean themselves out and tighten their belts," Arnold said.

"What all this means is these companies are translating the sales snap-back into significant earnings growth and it is driving the stocks," he said.

Shares of diversified manufacturer 3M and heavy machinery maker Caterpillar led the sector's gains, with both rising more than 5 percent after their results both easily topped Wall Street's estimates for sales and earnings. [nL4N1MZ4DR] [nL4N1MZ4EB]

The two stocks also propelled the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average <.DJI> to a record high. [nL4N1MZ4TD]

Caterpillar's results helped boost shares of agriculture equipment maker Deere & Co , while shares of Stanley Black & Decker climbed about 4 percent after the power tool maker's results. [nL4N1MZ4VZ]

General Motors Co shares meanwhile rose more than 1 percent after the automaker's profit topped estimates. GM's stock is part of the consumer discretionary sector <.SPLRCD> but its results are seen as an indicator of the health of industrial manufacturing. [nL2N1ML11I]

Tuesday's gains for the cyclical sectors signaled a potential rotation in the stock market. Shares of technology and healthcare companies, whose profits are more resistant to economic downturns, have led this year's market rally. [nL2N1ML11I]

Not all industrial stocks gained on Tuesday. Lockheed Martin Corp shares fell 2 percent after the weapons supplier's results, while United Technologies' shares were little changed after the conglomerate's report. [nL4N1MZ4HE] [nL4N1MZ45M]

Notably, shares of GE, the largest publicly traded industrial company, were down 1 percent, continuing their slide after the conglomerate reported earnings that fell far short of Wall Street expectations on Friday. [nL4N1MV3IM]

RPT-GRAPHIC-For GE and its shareholders, a lost decade and a half  - Reuters News

{{20171023T100001.415+0000}}RPT-GRAPHIC-For GE and its shareholders, a lost decade and a half (Repeats story first published on Friday)

By Lewis Krauskopf and Dan Burns

NEW YORK, Oct 20 (Reuters) - It has been a rough 16 years for General Electric Co and its shareholders.

When recently retired Chief Executive Jeff Immelt took over at the helm of GE in September 2001, the conglomerate was the most valuable U.S. publicly traded company, giving it outsized influence on the stock market.

In the years since, its annual net earnings have shrunk 35 percent and the stock has been effectively dead money: down more than 40 percent in price and posting a negative total return even after reinvesting its juicy dividends.

Along the way, GE's sway on markets has withered. The stock now has about one quarter of the weight on both the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average <.DJI> and the large-cap benchmark S&P 500 <.SPX> that it had back on Immelt's first day.

On Friday, GE reported its last quarterly profit of the Immelt era, well below Wall Street's expectations. Immelt's successor John Flannery derided the results as "horrible" and pledged "sweeping change." [nL4N1MV3IM]

The following statistics highlight GE's stock troubles and its fading market influence.

* GE's weight on the price-weighted Dow was 2.86 percent when Immelt took over, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices, when the stock was at $40, around the middle of the pack among the 30 members of the index. With the stock closing below $24 on Thursday, the lowest in the index by a margin of more than $10, it had a 0.7 percent weight. The shares closed at $23.83 on Friday.

* At their current price, GE shares would have less than one-tenth of the impact on the Dow as Boeing Co , the highest-priced stock in the Dow at more than $260 a share.

* GE is the lone remaining original component of the Dow, one of the 12 companies tracked by Charles Dow starting in 1896. But it has not been in the index continuously. GE was replaced and returned twice at the turn of the 20th century, but has been consistently a component since November 1907, nearly 110 years.

* Since 1976, a component change in the Dow has occurred on average about every two-and-three-quarters years. The last shake-up, when Apple Inc replaced AT&T Inc , occurred in March 2015, just over two-and-a-half years ago. Apple's market cap was about 1/60th of GE's when Immelt took over, but is now four times larger and owns the mantle of the world's most valuable publicly traded company.

* Could GE get the boot in the next change? Despite GE's troubles, Dave Nadig, CEO of ETF.com in Chicago, was skeptical that GE's recent struggles would push the stock out of the Dow. "I don't think that they are going to get kicked out of the index because the performance is bad," Nadig said. "You'd have to believe that the core of their business had really changed."

* It is not just in the Dow that GE's influence has shriveled. Once the heaviest component of the market-cap weighted S&P 500, GE now accounts for less than 1 percent of the S&P 500's market value. It accounted for about 4 percent when Immelt became CEO.

* New CEO John Flannery took the reins in August from Immelt. Since the start of Immelt's tenure in 2001 to Friday, GE's shares have declined 41 percent, against gains of more than 130 percent for both the S&P 500 <.SPX> and the Dow.

* GE pays a rich dividend, but even reinvesting those in the stock failed to pull investors out of the red in the Immelt era. Through Friday, the stock had delivered a total return of negative 0.4 percent since September 2001 against comparable gains of 222 percent for the S&P and 254 percent for the Dow.

* Investors are speculating that the dividend could be cut. It would not be the first time. In February 2009 GE announced plans to reduce its dividend as its then-massive finance arm grappled with the financial crisis. It cut the annual payout 68 percent to 40 cents a share, but it has since recovered to 96 cents.

* GE's dividend yield of about 4 percent is currently the second-biggest in the Dow, trailing Verizon Communications Inc's 4.8 percent yield.

UPDATE 7-GE vows $20 bln asset sales, 'sweeping change' as profit falls - Reuters News

{{20171020T222421.214+0000}}UPDATE 7-GE vows $20 bln asset sales, 'sweeping change' as profit falls(Adds closing share price, link to new related story)

By Alwyn Scott

NEW YORK, Oct 20 (Reuters) - General Electric Co's new chief executive vowed on Friday to shed more than $20 billion worth of assets and hold executives accountable for failing to deliver profits after what he called "horrible" results in the third quarter.

GE badly missed Wall Street expectations and slashed its full-year forecast, sending shares down as much as 6 percent early in the day. But the stock rebounded and closed up 1 percent at $23.83 after CEO John Flannery said he will focus the company on delivering profit and cash to shareholders.

Investors are pushing for big change after more than a decade of frustration at poor returns from the 125-year-old maker of power plants, jet engines, medical devices and other industrial equipment.

Since former CEO Jeff Immelt took the helm in September 2001, the stock is down more than 40 percent and has posted a negative return even after reinvesting its juicy dividends. [nL2N1MV0Z3]

Flannery, who took over as CEO on Aug. 1, said he would change GE's culture to hold managers more accountable, demand better performance from the businesses and reduce the complexity of GE's portfolio.

GE's good businesses are being held back by others that "drain investment and management resources without the prospect for a substantial reward," Flannery said on a conference call with analysts.

"We will have a simpler, more focused portfolio" in coming months, he said. "We are driving sweeping change."

Flannery declined to say what is on the chopping block, details he is due to unveil on Nov. 13. Immelt also shook up GE's portfolio, shedding plastics, NBCUniversal and most of GE Capital. He made acquisitions to build its power and oil and gas businesses. He also poured money into 3-D printing and a digital-industrial unit. Flannery voiced support for both on Friday.

Flannery also suggested GE would do what it could to sustain its dividend, but that it had to balance paying investors with investing to build its businesses.

Analysts had clear ideas about what pieces GE could do without: "GE will likely sell transportation, lighting and about anything else that isn't nailed down and very core," analyst Scott Davis at Melius Research wrote in a note on Friday.

As proof of GE's new approach to performance, outgoing Chief Financial Officer Jeff Bornstein took the blame for the poor results during the conference call, his last as CFO.

"Accountability has to start with me," he said. "We are not living up to our own standards or those of investors, and the buck stops with me."

GE's poor third-quarter results showed the depth of problems confronting Flannery, and he voiced eagerness to shake up GE's highest levels. A board seat recently given to Ed Garden, a founding partner at activist investor Trian Fund Management, would spark "robust dialogue," he said, and shedding some of the 18 directors was "being examined."

GE reported adjusted profit of 29 cents a share, missing by a wide margin the 49 cents analysts had expected, according to a consensus of estimates from Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

GE cut its profit forecast for the full year to $1.05 to $1.10 a share, from $1.60 to $1.70 previously, and said it would generate only about $7 billion in cash from operations, down from $12 billion to $14 billion it had forecast earlier. It left its dividend unchanged.

Weak performance in GE's power and oil and gas businesses, goodwill impairment and higher-than-expected restructuring costs were the main causes of the profit decline.

Profit at the GE power business, which makes power plants and related equipment, fell 51 percent in the quarter.

Cash flow from operating activities was $1.74 billion in the quarter, down from $2.90 billion a year earlier.

Revenue rose 14.4 percent to $33.47 billion, boosted by the acquisition of oilfield services provider Baker Hughes .

U.S. oil drillers cut rigs for a third week in a row -Baker Hughes - 路透新闻

{{20171020T170705.060+0000}}U.S. oil drillers cut rigs for a third week in a row -Baker HughesBy Scott DiSavino

Oct 20 (Reuters) - The U.S. oil rig count fell for a third
week in a row, extending a two-month drilling decline, although
producers have sharply ramped up bets against a fall in oil
prices, which could spur another investment surge.

The oil rig count fell seven to 736 in the week to Oct. 20,
the lowest level since June, General Electric Co's  Baker
Hughes energy services firm said in its closely followed report
on Friday.

The rig count, an early indicator of future output, is still
much higher than a year ago when only 443 rigs were active after
energy companies boosted spending plans as crude recovered from
a two-year price crash.

The recovery in drilling, however, lasted for 14 months
before stalling in August and September after producers trimmed
spending plans due to softer prices.

U.S. crude futures  have averaged over $49 a barrel so
far in 2017, easily topping last year's $43.47 average. Looking
ahead, futures were trading around $51 for the balance of the
year  and $52 for calendar 2018 .

With prices for 2018 at their strongest since April, there
has been a surge in hedging, that will allow U.S. shale
producers to keep drilling even if prices retreat, major oil
executives and bankers said in London this week. [nL8N1MT30B].

Ben Montalbano, co-founder of PetroNerds, a Denver,
Colorado, research firm that tracks hedging at about 40
medium-sized oil producers, said those firms are more heavily
hedged than at any point in the past six quarters.

U.S. shale production is expected to rise to a record high
6.1 million barrels per day (bpd) in November, according to
federal energy projections this week. [nL2N1MR1EO]

Analysts at Simmons & Co, energy specialists at U.S.
investment bank Piper Jaffray, this week revised slightly
downward their forecast for the total oil and natural gas rig
count, now expecting it to average 877 in 2017, 939 in 2018 and
1,087 in 2019. Last week, it forecast 880 in 2017, 956 in 2018
and 1,112 in 2019.

That compares with 866 oil and gas rigs so far in 2017, 509
in 2016 and 978 in 2015. Most rigs produce both oil and gas.

Analysts at U.S. financial services firm Cowen & Co's
capital expenditure tracking was unchanged this week, showing
the 64 E&Ps it tracks planned to increase spending by an average
of 49 percent in 2017 from 2016.

That expected 2017 spending increase followed an estimated
48 percent decline in 2016 and a 34 percent decline in 2015,
Cowen said.

UPDATE 2-Baker Hughes posts big profit miss, sees challenging year - Reuters News

{{20171020T114635.953+0000}}UPDATE 2-Baker Hughes posts big profit miss, sees challenging year* Volatile oil prices keeping customers cautious - CEO

* Schlumberger also warns of moderating N. America activity

* Baker Hughes Q3 adj. EPS of $0.05 vs est. $0.11

(Adds analyst estimate, background, shares)

Oct 20 (Reuters) - Baker Hughes' warned on Friday that the rest of the year would be challenging after it reported a quarterly profit that missed estimates by a wide margin as the oilfield services company negotiates volatile oil prices.

Larger rival Schlumberger Ltd also warned on Friday that oil and gas companies' investments in North America were moderating. [nL4N1MV3M9]

"Oil prices remain volatile and, as a result, our customers remain cautious," Lorenzo Simonelli, chief executive of Baker Hughes, the world's No. 2 oilfield services firm, said.

A week back, Baker Hughes said U.S. oil rig count, an early indicator of future output, had been falling for the past two months amid a perception of lower-for-longer oil prices. [RIG/U]

Brent crude prices are currently $56.97 per barrel, while U.S. crude prices are $50.95.

But, nearly two-thirds of U.S. energy firm's executives expect crude prices to stay below $60 per barrel through 2018 and not hit $70 at least until the next decade. [nL2N1MM128]

Baker Hughes reported a third-quarter loss of $104 million, or 24 cents per share. It did not give a comparable year-ago number in its first report to include GE Co's oil and gas business. [nBw6Nfr4qa]

Excluding items, the company earned 5 cents per share, far lower than analysts average estimate of 11 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Including GE's energy business, Baker Hughes' revenue was flat at $5.38 billion, the company said.

Revenue from oilfield services, its biggest business, rose 7.6 percent to $2.63 billion in the three months ended Sept. 30.

Apple and GE team up on software to track power plants, machinery - Reuters News

{{20171018T123001.144+0000}}Apple and GE team up on software to track power plants, machineryBy Stephen Nellis

Oct 18 (Reuters) - Apple Inc and General Electric Co say they are working together to make it easier to write software that can track power plants and jet engines on Apple's iPhones and iPads.

The companies have come up with a tool for app developers to connect Apple's iOS operating system more easily to Predix, the cloud-based software at the heart of GE's effort to turn itself into a "digital industrial" company.

The Predix software connects sensor-laden industrial machines like wind turbines, jet engines and elevators to data centers, so that streams of information from the machines can be analyzed to help predict failures and make the machines run more cost effectively.

GE expects the software to help generate $12 billion in digital revenue by 2020, though it took a two-month "time-out" earlier this year to iron out technical problems. [nL1N1KQ1UU]

Now with the help of the new software built with Apple, which GE plans to release on Oct. 26, more information from Predix will be available to the on-the-ground managers of factories and power plants who work most closely with GE's equipment, said Kevin Ichhpurani, executive vice president of global ecosystem and channels at GE Digital.

For example, Ichhpurani said, a power plant manager might be debating the best time to take a generator offline for scheduled maintenance. With the Predix software, the manager can see data on the machine and could share notes and photographs from an iPad at the site of the generator and even start a video call.

"These decisions can be made at the power plant or on the factory floor, as opposed to being made at corporate," Ichhpurani told Reuters in an interview.

As part of arrangements between the two companies, GE plans to make iPhones and iPads the standard mobile devices for its 330,000 employees and will also offer Mac desktop computers as a choice for them.

In return, Apple will help promote GE's Predix software to Apple's enterprise customers. Apple's salespeople will be trained on Predix's capabilities and will promote the software in sales situations alongside iOS devices, Susan Prescott, vice president of product market at Apple, told Reuters.

Over the past several years, Apple has courted business software firms such as Accenture PLC , International Business Machines Corp , Cisco Systems Inc , Deloitte and SAP SE in an effort to move business applications over to iOS devices and make them easier to use in corporate settings.[nL2N1LE1Q7]

* Pratt to outline fix for combustor liner - source

* New liner design expected to go into production this year - source

* Problem more acute in India due to pollution, weather extremes

By Aditi Shah

NEW DELHI, Oct 17 (Reuters) - U.S. airplane engine maker Pratt & Whitney is close to outlining a fix for problems with the combustion chamber lining in its new Geared Turbofan (GTF) engines, which have hit deliveries of Airbus A320neo planes, a person aware of the issue told Reuters.

Pratt & Whitney, owned by United Technologies , has had three teething issues with its GTF engines for the Airbus planes. It has fixed problems with the fan blade and an oil seal, but now faces production backlogs.

A third issue, with the combustion chamber lining, has been particularly problematic in India due to pollution and extreme weather conditions. [nL4N1KP5QU]

Indian airlines IndiGo and privately-owned GoAir are among the biggest customers for the A320neo planes, with about 30 between them today and around 500 on order.

A new design for the combustion chamber liner, to specifically address Indian conditions, is being tested, the person said, and is expected to go into production later this year. Once approved it will be fitted on all GTF engines, added the person, who asked not to be named as the tests are ongoing.

Pratt & Whitney said it is working with airline operators to fix the issues, noting that new and overhauled engines have incorporated improvements since March.

The issues with the GTF engines have grounded several of the revamped A320neo planes. In India alone, IndiGo and GoAir have grounded as many as 12 planes at one point, and cancelled dozens of flights.

A lack of spare engines kept some planes out of action for long periods, the person said. Pratt & Whitney said it has increased the supply of spares and speeded up overhauls.

"The engines have yet to go through a full life-cycle, so while Pratt has developed fixes for the fan blade and oil seal and is close on the combustor, there's no saying what may give next as the engines go through more wear and tear," an aviation industry source said.

Airbus CEO Tom Enders told the engine maker in July to "work harder" to address the problems and bring the situation back to normal. [nL5N1KI0YG]

United Technologies - whose engines compete with those from CFM International, a tie-up between General Electric and France's Safran - has invested $10 billion in developing the GTF engines. It reports third-quarter results next week.

IndiGo parent InterGlobe Aviation warned in July that new plane delivery delays were affecting profit margins, adding it was having to lease planes to make up the shortfall. [nL4N1KM3XL]

India's aviation regulator has stepped up inspections of A320neos using Pratt & Whitney engines after the issues faced by IndiGo and GoAir. [nL2N1GD1CG]

GE to make payments to U.S. government over delayed Baker Hughes divestiture  - Reuters News

{{20171017T154723.367+0000}}GE to make payments to U.S. government over delayed Baker Hughes divestiture WASHINGTON, Oct 17 (Reuters) - General Electric has agreed to make payments to the U.S. government after failing to divest a subsidiary as quickly as agreed following a merger approval, the Justice Department said on Tuesday.

The department, which did not say how big the payments are, said that they are to begin on Jan. 1 and continue "until the divestitures in each international jurisdiction are completed," the department said.

General Electric won U.S. antitrust approval to merge its oil and gas business with Baker Hughes Inc to form a new publicly traded company in June. The deal was approved on condition that GE sell its Water & Process Technologies business to the French waste and water group Suez . [nL1N1J91B2]

In its release, the department said the delays were due to "various administrative challenges."

US STOCKS-Dow breaches 23,000-mark for the first time - 路透新闻

* Healthcare stocks lead gainers on S&P, Dow

By Sruthi Shankar

Oct 17 (Reuters) - The Dow Jones Industrial Average breached the 23,000 mark for the first time on Tuesday led by more than 5 percent gain in UnitedHealth.

The broader market however was weighed down by losses in industrial, financial and technology stocks.

Shares of the largest U.S. health insurer touched a record high after the company reported a stronger-than-expected profit and raised its full-year earnings forecast. [nL4N1MS3CX]

That, along with a 2.4 percent rise in Johnson & Johnson , led a 0.92 percent gain in the S&P healthcare sector <.SPXHC>.

Goldman Sachs dipped 1 percent despite reporting a profit beat and smaller-than-expected trading revenue fall. Morgan Stanley rose 1.4 percent as wealth management business insulated the bank from weakness in trading revenue.

"There was some good earnings, real good economic data in spite of the hurricanes," said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at First Standard Financial in New York.

"We're not seeing a market that's galloping along here. The market from a technical perspective is tired. What you're seeing is some hesitancy but not any major declines."

U.S. Treasury yields rose after strongest reading on import prices in more than a year pushed inflation expectations higher.

Also supporting the yields was a report that U.S. President Donald Trump was impressed by his meeting with economist John Taylor, who is considered to favor higher interest rates than current Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen.

At 11:11 a.m. ET (1511 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average <.DJI> was up 40.93 points, or 0.18 percent, at 22,997.89, the S&P 500 <.SPX> was up 0.4 points, or 0.015639 percent, at 2,558.04 and the Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> was up 2.90 points, or 0.04 percent, at 6,626.90.

General Electric's 1.15 percent fall led losses in the industrial sector, while drop in shares of Microsoft and Intel weighed on the tech sector.

Seven of the 11 major S&P indexes were lower, led by a 0.39 percent drop in industrials <.SPLRCI> and material index <.SPLRCM>.

Netflix slipped 1.15 percent after touching a record high as more subscribers signed up for its popular original content in the latest quarter. [nL4N1MS4AM]

Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,502 to 1,205. On the Nasdaq, 1,383 issues fell and 1,311 advanced.

A third issue, with the combustion chamber lining, has been particularly problematic in India due to pollution and extreme weather conditions. [nL4N1KP5QU]

Indian airlines IndiGo and privately-owned GoAir are among the biggest customers for the A320neo planes, with about 30 between them today and around 500 on order.

A new design for the combustion chamber liner, to specifically address Indian conditions, is being tested, the person said, and is expected to go into production later this year. Once approved it will be fitted on all GTF engines, added the person, who asked not to be named as the tests are ongoing.

Pratt & Whitney said it is working with airline operators to fix the issues, noting that new and overhauled engines have incorporated improvements since March.

The issues with the GTF engines have grounded several of the revamped A320neo planes. In India alone, IndiGo and GoAir have grounded as many as 12 planes at one point, and cancelled dozens of flights.

A lack of spare engines kept some planes out of action for long periods, the person said. Pratt & Whitney said it has increased the supply of spares and speeded up overhauls.

"The engines have yet to go through a full life-cycle, so while Pratt has developed fixes for the fan blade and oil seal and is close on the combustor, there's no saying what may give next as the engines go through more wear and tear," an aviation industry source said.

Airbus CEO Tom Enders told the engine maker in July to "work harder" to address the problems and bring the situation back to normal. [nL5N1KI0YG]

United Technologies - whose engines compete with those from CFM International, a tie-up between General Electric and France's Safran - has invested $10 billion in developing the GTF engines. It reports third-quarter results next week.

IndiGo parent InterGlobe Aviation warned in July that new plane delivery delays were affecting profit margins, adding it was having to lease planes to make up the shortfall. [nL4N1KM3XL]

Apple and GE team up on software to track power plants, machinery - Reuters News

{{20171018T123001.144+0000}}Apple and GE team up on software to track power plants, machineryBy Stephen Nellis

Oct 18 (Reuters) - Apple Inc and General Electric Co say they are working together to make it easier to write software that can track power plants and jet engines on Apple's iPhones and iPads.

The companies have come up with a tool for app developers to connect Apple's iOS operating system more easily to Predix, the cloud-based software at the heart of GE's effort to turn itself into a "digital industrial" company.

The Predix software connects sensor-laden industrial machines like wind turbines, jet engines and elevators to data centers, so that streams of information from the machines can be analyzed to help predict failures and make the machines run more cost effectively.

GE expects the software to help generate $12 billion in digital revenue by 2020, though it took a two-month "time-out" earlier this year to iron out technical problems. [nL1N1KQ1UU]

Now with the help of the new software built with Apple, which GE plans to release on Oct. 26, more information from Predix will be available to the on-the-ground managers of factories and power plants who work most closely with GE's equipment, said Kevin Ichhpurani, executive vice president of global ecosystem and channels at GE Digital.

For example, Ichhpurani said, a power plant manager might be debating the best time to take a generator offline for scheduled maintenance. With the Predix software, the manager can see data on the machine and could share notes and photographs from an iPad at the site of the generator and even start a video call.

"These decisions can be made at the power plant or on the factory floor, as opposed to being made at corporate," Ichhpurani told Reuters in an interview.

As part of arrangements between the two companies, GE plans to make iPhones and iPads the standard mobile devices for its 330,000 employees and will also offer Mac desktop computers as a choice for them.

In return, Apple will help promote GE's Predix software to Apple's enterprise customers. Apple's salespeople will be trained on Predix's capabilities and will promote the software in sales situations alongside iOS devices, Susan Prescott, vice president of product market at Apple, told Reuters.

Over the past several years, Apple has courted business software firms such as Accenture PLC , International Business Machines Corp , Cisco Systems Inc , Deloitte and SAP SE in an effort to move business applications over to iOS devices and make them easier to use in corporate settings.[nL2N1LE1Q7]

GE to make payments to U.S. government over delayed Baker Hughes divestiture  - Reuters News

{{20171017T154723.367+0000}}GE to make payments to U.S. government over delayed Baker Hughes divestiture WASHINGTON, Oct 17 (Reuters) - General Electric has agreed to make payments to the U.S. government after failing to divest a subsidiary as quickly as agreed following a merger approval, the Justice Department said on Tuesday.

The department, which did not say how big the payments are, said that they are to begin on Jan. 1 and continue "until the divestitures in each international jurisdiction are completed," the department said.

General Electric won U.S. antitrust approval to merge its oil and gas business with Baker Hughes Inc to form a new publicly traded company in June. The deal was approved on condition that GE sell its Water & Process Technologies business to the French waste and water group Suez . [nL1N1J91B2]

In its release, the department said the delays were due to "various administrative challenges."

US STOCKS-Dow breaches 23,000-mark for the first time - 路透新闻

{{20171017T154558.389+0000}}US STOCKS-Dow breaches 23,000-mark for the first time* Goldman dips, Morgan Stanley up after Q3 profit beat

* Healthcare stocks lead gainers on S&P, Dow

(Updates prices, changes comment, adds details)

By Sruthi Shankar

Oct 17 (Reuters) - The Dow Jones Industrial Average breached the 23,000 mark for the first time on Tuesday led by more than 5 percent gain in UnitedHealth.

The broader market however was weighed down by losses in industrial, financial and technology stocks.

Shares of the largest U.S. health insurer touched a record high after the company reported a stronger-than-expected profit and raised its full-year earnings forecast. [nL4N1MS3CX]

That, along with a 2.4 percent rise in Johnson & Johnson , led a 0.92 percent gain in the S&P healthcare sector <.SPXHC>.

Goldman Sachs dipped 1 percent despite reporting a profit beat and smaller-than-expected trading revenue fall. Morgan Stanley rose 1.4 percent as wealth management business insulated the bank from weakness in trading revenue.

"There was some good earnings, real good economic data in spite of the hurricanes," said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at First Standard Financial in New York.

"We're not seeing a market that's galloping along here. The market from a technical perspective is tired. What you're seeing is some hesitancy but not any major declines."

U.S. Treasury yields rose after strongest reading on import prices in more than a year pushed inflation expectations higher.

Also supporting the yields was a report that U.S. President Donald Trump was impressed by his meeting with economist John Taylor, who is considered to favor higher interest rates than current Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen.

At 11:11 a.m. ET (1511 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average <.DJI> was up 40.93 points, or 0.18 percent, at 22,997.89, the S&P 500 <.SPX> was up 0.4 points, or 0.015639 percent, at 2,558.04 and the Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> was up 2.90 points, or 0.04 percent, at 6,626.90.

General Electric's 1.15 percent fall led losses in the industrial sector, while drop in shares of Microsoft and Intel weighed on the tech sector.

Seven of the 11 major S&P indexes were lower, led by a 0.39 percent drop in industrials <.SPLRCI> and material index <.SPLRCM>.

Netflix slipped 1.15 percent after touching a record high as more subscribers signed up for its popular original content in the latest quarter. [nL4N1MS4AM]

Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,502 to 1,205. On the Nasdaq, 1,383 issues fell and 1,311 advanced.

FACTBOX-Kobe Steel's data fabrication leaves "Made-in-Japan" champions scrambling - Reuters News

{{20171017T110231.939+0000}}FACTBOX-Kobe Steel's data fabrication leaves "Made-in-Japan" champions scrambling(Updates with details of more companies)

TOKYO, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Revelations from Japan's third-biggest steelmaker Kobe Steel Ltd <5406.T> that it had fabricated data for some of its aluminium and copper and other products have left affected manufacturers scrambling to pin down the potential impact.

The company supplies materials and components to companies around the world and said its product data falsification affected around 500 companies, including some global household names.

No safety problems have surfaced as Kobe Steel attempts to confirm the extent of the data tampering. The government has ordered the company to address safety concerns within about two weeks and report on how the misconduct occurred in a month.

The following lists companies that have received falsely certified parts or are checking whether they have received them.

Listed also are companies included in media reports, where Reuters has not been able to confirm the status.

BOEING

Boeing Co , the world's biggest maker of passenger jets, has used Kobe Steel 5406.T products that include those falsely certified by the Japanese company, a source with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.

AIRBUS

Airbus SE does not buy products directly from Japan's Kobe Steel but is investigating whether any of its suppliers are affected by the cheating scandal, an Airbus spokesman said.

The Nikkei newspaper had reported earlier that the aircraft maker had received Kobe Steel products with falsified specifications.

FORD

Ford Motor Co said its Ford Mondeo in China has an aluminium hood from Kobe Steel but that it had not confirmed whether this was an affected product.

GENERAL MOTORS

General Motors Co said it is was investigating whether any autos contained products sourced from Kobe Steel.

TOYOTA

Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T>, Japan's largest automaker, said the compliance breach was a "grave issue", adding that Kobe Steel's products were used in vehicle doors and hoods.

ROLLS ROYCE

Rolls-Royce Holdings said it received affected products but they have not been used.

KOREAN AIR

Korean Air Lines Co <003490.KS> said it has supplied parts using Kobe Steel products to Boeing and was investigating.

HYUNDAI MOTOR

Hyundai Motor Co <005380.KS> and sister car maker Kia Motors Corp <000270.KS> said panels produced by Kobe Steel have been used in the IONIQ and Niro models.

NISSAN

Doors and hoods were affected at Nissan Motor Co <7201.T>, a spokesman said.

The automaker is grappling with its own compliance failures, recalling all new cars sold in Japan in the last three years after discovering final vehicle inspections were not performed by authorised technicians. [nL4N1MH0TP]

HONDA, SUBARU

Honda Motor Co <7267.T> also said doors and hoods were affected, while Subaru Corp <7270.T> said vehicles and aircraft were affected.

Japanese industry ministry officials said Kobe Steel materials were used in some defence equipment made by Subaru.

SUZUKI

Suzuki Motor Corp <7269.T> says affected products supplied by Kobe Steel were used in its motorcycles.

Other automakers affected by Kobe Steel's announcement are Mazda Motor Corp <7261.T> and Mitsubishi Motors Corp <7211.T>, the companies confirmed.

MITSUBISHI HEAVY

Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd <7011.T> said Kobe Steel products were used on its Mitsubishi Regional Jet and rockets, including the H-2A rocket launched on Oct. 10 to put a navigation satellite into orbit. The rocket cleared all safety checks before launch, the company said.

Japanese industry ministry officials said Kobe Steel materials were used in some defence equipment made by Mitsubishi Heavy.

IHI

Heavy machinery maker IHI Corp <7013.T> said affected products were used in its jet engines.

IHI is a supplier for engines used on Boeing Co aircraft and in Japan's defence and aerospace industries. The company did not say which engines used the affected products.

Japanese industry ministry officials said Kobe Steel materials were used in some defence equipment made by IHI.

HITACHI

Hitachi Ltd <6501.T> said affected aluminium products were used in its trains in Japan and the U.K.

The company said it plans to exchange parts used in the undercarriage of bullet trains running on JR Tokai and JR West lines.

It was not possible to switch out components used in train bodies, such as on JR East bullet trains and in its U.K trains, the company said, adding it is considering whether to seek compensation from the steelmaker.

JR TOKAI

Central Japan Railway Company Co <9022.T>, which operates the bullet train line between Tokyo and Osaka, said affected products were used in train undercarriages and would be replaced.

JR WEST

West Japan Railway Co <9021.T> said affected parts were used and that it will seek compensation from the steelmaker.

JR EAST

East Japan Railway Co <9020.T> said affected parts were used in bullet train bodies.

KAWASAKI HEAVY

Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd <7012.T> said affected materials were used in aircraft parts and in engine components while it was still investigating to see if there were any other products including trains that used affected materials.

Japanese industry ministry officials said Kobe Steel materials were used in some defence equipment made by Kawasaki Heavy.

MITSUBISHI ELECTRIC

Mitsubishi Electric Corp <6503.T> said affected copper was used in air conditioners produced domestically.

TEPCO

Fukushima nuclear operator Tokyo Electric Power Holdings Inc (Tepco) <9501.T> said on Oct. 13 it had taken delivery of pipes from Kobe Steel that were not checked properly. The pipes were delivered to its Fukushima Daini station, located near the destroyed Fukushima Daiichi plant, but have not been used, Tepco said. Tepco was checking all its facilities.

VOLKSWAGEN

Volkswagen AG [VOWG_p.DE] said Kobe Steel is not a direct supplier and that it was checking the situation with its own suppliers.

PANASONIC

Panasonic Corp <6752.T> said affected products were used in Blu-ray discs and had also received affected copper and copper alloy pipes from Kobe Steel.

DAIMLER

Daimler AG said on Oct. 13 that Kobe Steel is not a supplier after the Nikkei business daily reported the same day that it had received products from the steelmaker with falsified specifications.

PSA GROUP

PSA Group also said on Oct. 13 that Kobe Steel is not a supplier after the Nikkei reported it had also received products from the steelmaker with falsified specifications.

The Nikkei also said the following companies have been supplied with Kobe Steel products with faked specifications.

A Kobe Steel spokesman told Reuters the companies had all received parts and components originating from the steelmaker but did not confirm whether they had been tampered with.

The companies are listed below by sector, separated between Japanese and non-Japanese companies.

Serbia's biggest windfarm project attracts EBRD, IFC funding  - Reuters News

{{20171017T110222.547+0000}}Serbia's biggest windfarm project attracts EBRD, IFC funding BELGRADE, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Serbia's largest windfarm project will receive 215 million euros ($253 million) in syndicated loans from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and International Finance Corporation (IFC), the lenders said on Tuesday.

The 300 million euro, 158 megawatt (MW) Cibuk windfarm is to be built 50 km (31 miles) northeast of Belgrade and is aimed at helping diversify the country's energy mix and reduce its carbon dioxide emissions.

It is one of several due to be built in the next few years in Serbia, which produces 70 percent of its energy from coal and the rest from hydro power.

The funds will go to Vetroelektrane Balkana, owned by Tesla Wind, a joint venture between an Abu Dhabi-based renewable energy developer Masdar and Cibuk Wind Holding, a subsidiary of the U.S.-based wind energy developer Continental Wind Partners.

The windfarm will have the capacity to supply 113,000 households and comprise 57 wind turbines supplied by General Electric .

It is expected to connect to the grid in the first half of 2019.

RPT-Wall St Week Ahead-Cyclical sector rally banks on global economic expansion - 路透新闻

{{20171015T170001.626+0000}}RPT-Wall St Week Ahead-Cyclical sector rally banks on global economic expansion(Repeats Friday story with no changes)

By Lewis Krauskopf

NEW YORK, Oct 13 (Reuters) - U.S. stock sectors that are particularly dependent on economic growth recently grabbed hold of the market's rally and are poised to keep the reins should further signs of global expansion emerge.

Such sectors, including energy, industrials and financials, beat the S&P 500's 1.9 percent gain in September. Those sectors had previously lagged behind the benchmark S&P <.SPX>, which has climbed 14 percent this year while feasting on a steady diet of record highs. Instead, shares of technology and healthcare companies, whose profits are more impervious to economic down cycles, have led 2017's rally.

The question for equity investors is now: Was September just a catch-up period for the lagging, cyclical sectors, or can an economic lift support a sustained run?

"If it's just a mean-reversion trade, then it's probably going to last another few weeks and then we're back to the old winners," said Walter Todd, chief investment officer at Greenwood Capital Associates in Greenwood, South Carolina. "If it's something more fundamental, it should be longer lasting than that."

A test comes next week, as third-quarter corporate earnings season kicks into high gear. Reports from industrial conglomerates General Electric and Honeywell International , railroads CSX Corp and Kansas City Southern and steel company Nucor Corp stand to yield insight into the economy's health.

September's stock action, which also included outsized gains for small-cap stocks, had echoes of the immediate aftermath of President Donald Trump's election in November 2016.

The same areas showed strength on hopes that a Republican-led federal government would push through an agenda, including tax cuts and deregulation, that juices economic growth. Those trades faded as Trump struggled to rack up any significant legislative wins.

Now, investors say, September's stock rally for those groups again stemmed at least in part from policy hopes, as Trump revved up his tax-reform push.

"In many ways, we began to replicate the market performance following Trump's election," said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial in Newark, New Jersey.

But an improving economic picture in the United States and globally lends confidence for the cyclical sector rally.

The Citi economic surprise index for the United States <.CESIUSD>, a measure of economic data that can come in weaker or stronger than forecast, is around a five-month high, with the barometer trending higher since hitting multi-year lows this summer.

This week, the International Monetary Fund upgraded its global economic growth forecast for 2017 by 0.1 percentage point to 3.6 percent, and to 3.7 percent for 2018, from its April and July outlook, driven by a pickup in trade, investment, and consumer confidence. [nL2N1MK19Z]

The U.S. Commerce Department last month revised its estimate for second-quarter gross domestic product growth to 3.1 percent, up from 3 percent. [nL2N1M90MW]

"We've just had better data," said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at The Leuthold Group in Minneapolis, who also points to indicators such as firming industrial commodity and oil prices and a rise in the Baltic Exchange's main sea freight index <.BADI>.

"Those things are all kind of reflecting a realism of economic momentum, not just a one-off, Trump pie-in-the-sky expectation about policy change," Paulsen said.

Bets seemed to build on the cyclical sectors in the first week of October, which saw flows into the largest sector exchange-traded funds for financials , industrials and energy , and outflows for technology and healthcare , according to Lipper data.

"There is some momentum developing in these underperforming sectors," said Anthony Saglimbene, global market strategist at Ameriprise in Troy, Michigan.

Earnings results could sway that momentum. Technology, which has gained 29 percent this year, topping all sectors, is expected to post a 12.2 percent increase in third-quarter profits, more than twice the expected rise for cyclical groups such as industrials and materials.

Kate Warne, investment strategist at Edward Jones in St. Louis, said global growth "hasn't been strong enough for investors to feel comfortable that we will continue to see the earnings delivered by those companies in the way that tech and healthcare have consistently delivered stronger earnings."

"For the cyclicals to continue to outperform, we have got to see signs that economic growth globally is accelerating, even compared to what we have seen so far this year," Warne said.

WEEK AHEAD

A host of big U.S. companies are due to report earnings, among them Morgan Stanley, IBM Corp, Verizon Communications Inc, Procter & Gamble Co and General Electric Company. Goldman Sachs Group Inc will announce its third-quarter results on Tuesday and investors will be looking for signs of improvement in its fixed income trading business, where the bank's performance has lagged peers over the last two quarters. IBM Corp, the tech services giant, is expected to report another straight quarter of revenue declines and a marginal dip in profit on the same day. Despite pushing for its cloud and data analytics units, which are higher margin businesses, IBM's legacy businesses continue to drag down its total revenue, putting pressure on Chief Executive Ginni Rometty's turnaround plan. Also on Tuesday, band-aid maker Johnson & Johnson is expected to report higher third-quarter revenue, largely due to its acquisition of Swiss biotech Actelion Ltd and strong performance of its key drugs. Investors are likely to focus on concerns over prostate cancer drug Zytiga's patent risk and the prevailing generic competition for its portfolio of drugs. UnitedHealth Group Inc on Tuesday is set to kick off healthcare earnings with strong third-quarter results, a few days after President Donald Trump scrapped Obamacare subsidies in his latest attempt to weaken the Affordable Care Act. The nation's largest health insurer and a bellwether for the industry is expected to continue benefiting from its exit from the individual insurance market. Investors will look out for updates on the company's full-year 2018 forecast and comments on Trump's recent orders that could change the landscape of the health insurance industry. On Wednesday, American Express Co is expected to post higher third-quarter revenues due to accelerating loan growth. The card issuer's revenues are expected to be offset by higher rewards and marketing spends, in the wake of ongoing competition. Property and casualty insurer Travelers Cos Inc is expected to post a slump in quarterly profits on Thursday due to a spike in catastrophe losses arising from hurricanes Harvey and Irma. General Electric will try to reassure investors rattled by low cash flow and weak profits at the industrial company in the first half when it reports third-quarter results on Friday. The company is expected to post rising cash flow and profit as it tries to hit full-year targets of $18 billion in cash from operations and $1.60 in adjusted earnings per share. But the industrial company's outlook remains clouded as investors await a financial update on Nov. 13 following a wide-ranging portfolio review by John Flannery, who became CEO on Aug. 1. Flannery is expected to set new targets for 2018 and beyond, likely notching down the $2-a-share target set by former CEO Jeff Immelt and increasing cost cutting. On the same day, Pampers diapers and Gillette razor-maker Procter & Gamble Co will report first-quarter earnings. The company said activist hedge fund manager Nelson Peltz lost his fight to win a seat on the company's board following a months-long proxy battle.

On the same day, Cleveland-based regional bank KeyCorp is likely to report higher third-quarter net income, helped by strength in its loan portfolio and higher interest rates. Following its acquisition of First Niagara Financial Group Inc, the company will possibly realize revenue synergies of upto $300 million in next two to three years. On Friday, Atlanta-based regional bank SunTrust Banks Inc will report possibly higher net interest income for the third quarter, helped by higher interest rates.

Investors will be looking to see if Intuitive can maintain the momentum seen the previous quarter in a year in which its stock price has surged more than 70 percent.

United Airlines will report its third-quarter financial results after market close on Wednesday and host a webcast of its results on Thursday. The quarter includes a period of significant operational disruption caused by deadly hurricanes, including Hurricane Harvey, which led to more than 7,400 United flight cancellations.

Payment processor PayPal Holdings Inc on Thursday is expected to report a rise in third-quarter profit, helped by a higher payment volumes, growth in customer accounts and volumes at Venmo, PayPal's mobile peer-to-peer payments app popular with younger consumers, which more than doubled to $8 billion in Q2. Since separating from eBay in 2015, PayPal has been signing more partnerships and making acquisitions in a bid to gain an edge over rivals in the highly competitive digital payments market.

World's second-largest advertising company Omnicom Group Inc is expected to post a fall in third-quarter revenue on Tuesday, as it continues to see slowing growth in North America, its biggest market. However, Omnicom, which gets over 40 percent of its revenue from outside the U.S. could also be affected by a strong dollar.

Textron Inc, the Cessna jet maker, is expected to report a decline in its third-quarter profit, partly due to weak business jet demand, on Thursday.

The Milwaukee-based company said in July it would need to cut production in second half of 2017, resulting in hourly workforce reductions at some of its U.S. plants. Investors will look for an update on full-year financial forecast and rider response to Harley's new models launched in August with its new Milwaukee-Eight engine and futuristic styling.

On Wednesday, Canadian media company Corus Entertainment Inc is expected to post a fourth-quarter profit, which would miss estimates, hurt by higher expenses to keep up with competition from online streaming services and rival cable companies. Investors will be on the lookout for company's capital expenditure plans and forecast for fiscal 2018. When Canada's Rogers Communications Inc reports third-quarter earnings on Thursday, investors will be eager to see if it notched a decent growth in cable and internet subscriptions amid heightened competition from the company's telecom rival BCE Inc.

On Friday, the Canada's annual inflation rate is forecast to have risen to 1.6 percent in September, bringing it closer to the central bank's target and potentially giving policymakers room to raise interest rates for a third time before the year is out.

U.S. oil drillers cut rigs for a second week in a row -Baker Hughes - 路透新闻

{{20171013T171038.287+0000}}U.S. oil drillers cut rigs for a second week in a row -Baker HughesBy Scott DiSavino

Oct 13 (Reuters) - The U.S. oil rig count fell for a second
week in a row, extending a two-month drilling decline, even as
crude prices rallied to over $50 per barrel.

Drillers cut five oil rigs in the week to Oct. 13, bringing
the total count up to 743, the lowest since early June, General
Electric Co's  Baker Hughes energy services firm said in
its closely followed report on Friday.

The rig count, an early indicator of future output, is still
much higher than a year ago when only 432 rigs were active after
energy companies boosted spending plans earlier in the year in
anticipation of higher crude prices in coming months.

U.S. crude futures  have averaged over $49 a barrel so
far in 2017, easily topping last year's $43.47 average.

On Friday, U.S. crude was trading around $51.50 after
hitting its highest since the end of September, and was on track
for a 4 percent weekly increase.

Looking ahead, futures were trading around $51.60 for the
balance of the year  and just over $52 for calendar
2018 .

Some exploration and production (E&P) companies trimmed
their 2017 investment plans over the past few months after crude
prices in May fell below $50, which is generally considered the
level where production breaks even, leading to the end of a
14-month drilling recovery.

They, however, still plan to spend more this year than in
2016.

U.S. production is expected to rise to 9.2 million barrels
per day (bpd) in 2017 and a record 9.9 million bpd in 2018 from
8.9 million bpd in 2016, according to federal energy projections
this week. [EIA/M]

The International Energy Agency said this week it expects
U.S. crude output to grow by 470,000 bpd this year and by 1.1
million bpd in 2018. [nL8N1MN1NO]

U.S. crude production, aided in large part by resurgent
shale output, grew by 550,000 bpd in July compared with a year
earlier to 9.24 million bpd, its highest since November 2015, 
the Paris-based IEA said.

Analysts at Simmons & Co, energy specialists at U.S.
investment bank Piper Jaffray, this week revised slightly
downward their forecast for the total oil and natural gas rig
count, now expecting it to average 880 in 2017, 956 in 2018 and
1,112 in 2019. Last week, it forecast 881 in 2017, 960 in 2018
and 1,116 in 2019.

That compares with 865 oil and gas rigs so far in 2017, 509
in 2016 and 978 in 2015. Most rigs produce both oil and gas.

Wall St Week Ahead-Cyclical sector rally banks on global economic expansion - 路透新闻

{{20171013T110001.743+0000}}Wall St Week Ahead-Cyclical sector rally banks on global economic expansionBy Lewis Krauskopf

NEW YORK, Oct 13 (Reuters) - U.S. stock sectors that are particularly dependent on economic growth recently grabbed hold of the market's rally and are poised to keep the reins should further signs of global expansion emerge.

Such sectors, including energy, industrials and financials, beat the S&P 500's 1.9 percent gain in September. Those sectors had previously lagged behind the benchmark S&P <.SPX>, which has climbed 14 percent this year while feasting on a steady diet of record highs. Instead, shares of technology and healthcare companies, whose profits are more impervious to economic down cycles, have led 2017's rally.

The question for equity investors is now: Was September just a catch-up period for the lagging, cyclical sectors, or can an economic lift support a sustained run?

"If it's just a mean-reversion trade, then it's probably going to last another few weeks and then we're back to the old winners," said Walter Todd, chief investment officer at Greenwood Capital Associates in Greenwood, South Carolina. "If it's something more fundamental, it should be longer lasting than that."

A test comes next week, as third-quarter corporate earnings season kicks into high gear. Reports from industrial conglomerates General Electric and Honeywell International , railroads CSX Corp and Kansas City Southern and steel company Nucor Corp stand to yield insight into the economy's health.

September's stock action, which also included outsized gains for small-cap stocks, had echoes of the immediate aftermath of President Donald Trump's election in November 2016.

The same areas showed strength on hopes that a Republican-led federal government would push through an agenda, including tax cuts and deregulation, that juices economic growth. Those trades faded as Trump struggled to rack up any significant legislative wins.

Now, investors say, September's stock rally for those groups again stemmed at least in part from policy hopes, as Trump revved up his tax-reform push.

"In many ways, we began to replicate the market performance following Trump's election," said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial in Newark, New Jersey.

But an improving economic picture in the United States and globally lends confidence for the cyclical sector rally.

The Citi economic surprise index for the United States <.CESIUSD>, a measure of economic data that can come in weaker or stronger than forecast, is around a five-month high, with the barometer trending higher since hitting multi-year lows this summer.

This week, the International Monetary Fund upgraded its global economic growth forecast for 2017 by 0.1 percentage point to 3.6 percent, and to 3.7 percent for 2018, from its April and July outlook, driven by a pickup in trade, investment, and consumer confidence. [nL2N1MK19Z]

The U.S. Commerce Department last month revised its estimate for second-quarter gross domestic product growth to 3.1 percent, up from 3 percent. [nL2N1M90MW]

"We've just had better data," said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at The Leuthold Group in Minneapolis, who also points to indicators such as firming industrial commodity and oil prices and a rise in the Baltic Exchange's main sea freight index <.BADI>.

"Those things are all kind of reflecting a realism of economic momentum, not just a one-off, Trump pie-in-the-sky expectation about policy change," Paulsen said.

Bets seemed to build on the cyclical sectors in the first week of October, which saw flows into the largest sector exchange-traded funds for financials , industrials and energy , and outflows for technology and healthcare , according to Lipper data.

"There is some momentum developing in these underperforming sectors," said Anthony Saglimbene, global market strategist at Ameriprise in Troy, Michigan.

Earnings results could sway that momentum. Technology, which has gained 29 percent this year, topping all sectors, is expected to post a 12.2 percent increase in third-quarter profits, more than twice the expected rise for cyclical groups such as industrials and materials.

Kate Warne, investment strategist at Edward Jones in St. Louis, said global growth "hasn't been strong enough for investors to feel comfortable that we will continue to see the earnings delivered by those companies in the way that tech and healthcare have consistently delivered stronger earnings."

"For the cyclicals to continue to outperform, we have got to see signs that economic growth globally is accelerating, even compared to what we have seen so far this year," Warne said.

UPDATE 1-FAA orders A380 engine inspections after Air France incident - Reuters News

{{20171013T050201.352+0000}}UPDATE 1-FAA orders A380 engine inspections after Air France incident* Inspections need to be made within weeks

* Affected engines used on 60 pct of A380s globally - analyst

* Emirates, Etihad, Qatar, and Korean Air also use the engines

(Adds more details of directive, affected aircraft)

By Jamie Freed

SINGAPORE, Oct 13 (Reuters) - U.S. aviation authorities have ordered visual inspections of fan hubs in engines used on some Airbus SE A380 jets after an engine came apart on an Air France flight last month, forcing it to make an emergency landing.

The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued an emergency airworthiness directive requiring owners and operators of Engine Alliance (EA) Model GP7200 series engines to visually inspect the engines and remove the fan hub if defects are found.

The EA engines are manufactured by a 50-50 joint venture between General Electric Co and United Technologies Corp's Pratt & Whitney unit.

The FAA directive formalises advice circulated by the engine company on Thursday. EA declined immediate comment.

GP7200 engines account for 60 percent of the global market share of engines that power Airbus A380 superjumbos currently in service, according to Corrine Png, the CEO of transport research firm Crucial Perspective.

In addition to Air France, the affected airlines include Emirates, the world's largest A380 operator, as well as Etihad Airways, Qatar Airways and Korean Air Lines Co <003490.KS>.

The FAA said the directive, an interim measure, was prompted by the failure of the fan hub on the affected engine on the Air France aircraft.

"An investigation to determine the cause of the failure is on-going and we may consider additional rulemaking if final action is identified," it said in a statement.

Depending on the number of flight cycles, the inspections must be performed within the next two to eight weeks.

A380 aircraft powered by the rival Rolls-Royce Holdings PLC Trent 900 engine are not affected by the directive.

FAA orders A380 engine inspections after Air France incident - Reuters News

{{20171013T042212.128+0000}}FAA orders A380 engine inspections after Air France incidentSINGAPORE, Oct 13 (Reuters) - U.S. aviation authorities have ordered visual inspections of fan hubs in engines used on some Airbus SE A380 jets after an engine came apart on an Air France flight last month, forcing it to make an emergency landing.

The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration issued an emergency airworthiness directive requiring owners and operators of Engine Alliance (EA) Model GP7200 series engines to visually inspect the engines and remove the fan hub if defects are found.

The EA engines are manufactured by a 50-50 joint venture between General Electric Co and United Technologies Corp's Pratt & Whitney unit.

RPT-ANALYSIS-GE stock hits 4-yr low as analysts debate possibility of dividend cut - Reuters News

{{20171012T110001.635+0000}}RPT-ANALYSIS-GE stock hits 4-yr low as analysts debate possibility of dividend cut(Repeats for wider distribution story first published on Oct. 11)

By Alwyn Scott

NEW YORK, Oct 11 (Reuters) - Concern among investors that General Electric Co may not generate enough cash this year to fully cover its dividend and other promised spending sent its stock to its lowest level in more than four years on Wednesday.

The shares fell 1.2 percent to $23.07 after JPMorgan said a dividend cut was "increasingly likely" and lowered its price target on the stock to $20 from $22.

"Despite the recent CEO change, by the numbers we see a core operating performance that is below (GE's) plan," JPMorgan analyst Stephen Tusa wrote in a note on Wednesday, referring to GE's full year forecast. Tusa was not available to comment beyond the note.

Chief Executive John Flannery, who took over the position on August 1, is doing a comprehensive review of the company and is due to set new targets for earnings and capital allocation, which includes dividends, on Nov. 13.

GE has affirmed its commitment to the dividend, which gives GE stock the second-highest dividend yield in the Dow Jones Industrial Average and ranks it 30th among the S&P 500.

"Dividends remain a top priority," GE spokeswoman Jennifer Erickson said on Wednesday, declining to answer further questions as the company is in a quiet period ahead of its third-quarter results due next week. The dividend due to be paid Oct. 25 is not subject to being cut.

GE's stock has fallen 5.4 percent since Friday, including falling 1.24 percent to $23.07 on Wednesday, its lowest close since Sept. 3, 2013. The stock is down 27 percent this year, the worst Dow performer.

On Friday GE said that its long-time Chief Financial Officer Jeff Bornstein would retire and be replaced by Jamie Miller, who has been the head of its transportation unit. [nL4N1MH3QH]

A Reuters analysis of a GE presentation released in July and executives' comments showed that GE could generate $6 billion less cash this year than it planned to spend on dividends, share buybacks and other items. Its plan called for spending up to $25.8 billion, including about $8 billion on dividends, while generating about $20 billion in cash from operations and asset sales.

GE has the capacity to pay the dividend. The company has more than $14 billion in cash on its balance sheet and $327 billion in orders for power plants, jet engines, locomotives, oil and gas equipment and healthcare devices.

It could trim other spending instead, such as buying back fewer shares than the $11 billion to $13 billion it has targeted for this year.

The 125-year-old company has cut its dividend six times in the last 34 years, including a 68 percent cut in 2009 during the financial crisis. It is operating against a far more favorable economic backdrop now.

"A dividend cut could crush the stock as retail investors flee, but maintaining it gives GE little or no excess cash to grow," Jeffrey Sprague, an analyst at Vertical Research Partners, said in a note after the Bornstein announcement on Friday.

"GE has continued to shrink the company but it has not proportionally shrunk the dividend."

Some analysts saw a dividend cut as unlikely.

"Cutting the dividend would be a last resort," Moody's Investors Service credit analyst Rene Lipsch told Reuters on Wednesday. But, he said, GE's options would narrow next year when it no longer receives billions from asset sales at GE Capital.

Long term, he said, the dividend "depends on Flannery's ability to increase cash flow from the businesses."

Damaged A380 to be flown to France to investigate engine blast - Reuters News

{{20171010T193322.333+0000}}Damaged A380 to be flown to France to investigate engine blastBy Tim Hepher

PARIS, Oct 10 (Reuters) - French investigators are preparing for an intricate operation to repatriate an Air France Airbus A380 passenger jet that was forced to make an emergency landing in Canada after one of its engines came apart in mid-flight, people familiar with the manoeuvre said.

The Airbus superjumbo diverted to Goose Bay in Labrador on Sept. 30 after one of its four engines exploded over Greenland, sending the front part of the engine including its 3-metre-wide fan into the ice sheet 37,000 feet below.

More than 500 passengers and crew, some of whom had reported a bang and vibration, were picked up on two replacement jets after waiting for hours onboard due to problems in accommodating the world's largest airliner at the remote military airport.

But the aircraft itself remained stranded while French-led investigators collected evidence and developed a plan for returning it to France.

Making the roughly 2,300 nautical mile (4,260 km) trip will need a switch in engines to help the mammoth jet fly smoothly.

First, the rump of the broken engine will be taken off the wing and flown to Wales, where manufacturer General Electric can examine it at its Cardiff repair workshop, the people said.

Then a spare engine will be mounted on the right wing in the same outer position as the damaged one. But this will only be used to balance the weight during flight and that engine will not be operable.

The people declined to be quoted as the plans have not yet been announced. France's BEA accident agency declined comment.

The operation to fetch the double-decker jet is not the only challenging errand triggered by the mid-air explosion.

Some parts of the engine were retrieved by helicopter in Greenland on Oct. 6 and dispatched to BEA headquarters in Paris. But investigators still face a tricky search in uncertain weather conditions to try to find other missing elements before they are buried by snow.

Although nobody was injured, the engine break-up has led to what could be a lengthy investigation to ensure other aircraft are not exposed to the risk of damage from high-speed engine debris. Experts say such incidents are very rare, however.

GP7200 engines used on Air France A380s are made by Engine Alliance, co-owned by GE and Pratt & Whitney .

In 2010 a Qantas A380 engine built by UK rival Rolls-Royce blew up shortly after take-off. Investigators cited a poorly manufactured part.

RPT-UPDATE 2-GE names hedge fund Trian executive Ed Garden to board - Reuters News

{{20171009T183910.214+0000}}RPT-UPDATE 2-GE names hedge fund Trian executive Ed Garden to board(Repeats to widen distribution and show pictures availability)

By Svea Herbst-Bayliss and Rachit Vats

Oct 9 (Reuters) - U.S. industrial conglomerate General Electric Co , which major shareholder Trian Fund Management has been pressuring to conduct a more thorough restructuring, appointed the hedge fund's chief investment officer to its board on Monday.

Edward Garden will replace Robert Lane, who is retiring due to health reasons after a dozen years as a director, GE said in a statement. [nBw8YlG44a]

The surprise move comes one day before shareholders at consumer products company Procter & Gamble Co will decide whether to elect Trian Chief Executive Nelson Peltz to its board. [nL4N1ME3MR][nL4N1MH3B0]

Trian, which invests $14 billion in assets for pension funds, endowments and wealthy investors, has owned a roughly 1 percent stake in GE since 2015.

Four months ago, GE said longtime CEO Jeff Immelt would step down and that John Flannery, a 30-year company veteran who had run its healthcare business, would succeed him. [nL2N1MD24Z]

The company's lackluster stock performance was seen to have prompted Immelt's departure, which came months before analysts had expected, but the shares have continued to fall. They were down 3 percent in Monday morning trading.

"Like other GE shareholders, I am disappointed by the recent performance of GE's stock," Garden said in a statement. "But I continue to believe that GE represents an attractive long-term investment opportunity with significant upside." [nBw7dNFlSa]

The most recent wave of executive departures was announced last week and includes Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey Bornstein. Jamie Miller, CEO of GE Transportation, will become CFO next month. [nL4N1MH3QH]

Although Trian is an activist investor that demands change at companies, it is also known for working behind the scenes with management to improve performance. It rarely pushes out a CEO the way some other activists do, and it often sticks around, often for years, as transformations occur.

After discussions with Trian, GE in March set a $2 billion cost-reduction target and linked the bonuses of its senior management to meeting profit-related goals. [nL3N1GZ4DQ]

As a board member at Bank of New York Mellon Corp , Garden most recently helped hire former Visa Inc CEO Charles Scharf to replace Gerald Hassell, who is retiring. Garden is also a board member of Pentair Plc .

Since its 2005 inception, Trian has returned an average 8 percent a year to investors, according to data from HSBC Holdings Plc's hedge fund investment arm.

UPDATE 2-GE names hedge fund Trian executive Ed Garden to board - Reuters News

{{20171009T172448.847+0000}}UPDATE 2-GE names hedge fund Trian executive Ed Garden to board(Adds Breakingviews links)

By Svea Herbst-Bayliss and Rachit Vats

Oct 9 (Reuters) - U.S. industrial conglomerate General Electric Co , which major shareholder Trian Fund Management has been pressuring to conduct a more thorough restructuring, appointed the hedge fund's chief investment officer to its board on Monday.

Edward Garden will replace Robert Lane, who is retiring due to health reasons after a dozen years as a director, GE said in a statement. [nBw8YlG44a]

The surprise move comes one day before shareholders at consumer products company Procter & Gamble Co will decide whether to elect Trian Chief Executive Nelson Peltz to its board. [nL4N1ME3MR][nL4N1MH3B0]

Trian, which invests $14 billion in assets for pension funds, endowments and wealthy investors, has owned a roughly 1 percent stake in GE since 2015.

Four months ago, GE said longtime CEO Jeff Immelt would step down and that John Flannery, a 30-year company veteran who had run its healthcare business, would succeed him. [nL2N1MD24Z]

The company's lackluster stock performance was seen to have prompted Immelt's departure, which came months before analysts had expected, but the shares have continued to fall. They were down 3 percent in Monday morning trading.

"Like other GE shareholders, I am disappointed by the recent performance of GE's stock," Garden said in a statement. "But I continue to believe that GE represents an attractive long-term investment opportunity with significant upside." [nBw7dNFlSa]

The most recent wave of executive departures was announced last week and includes Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey Bornstein. Jamie Miller, CEO of GE Transportation, will become CFO next month. [nL4N1MH3QH]

Although Trian is an activist investor that demands change at companies, it is also known for working behind the scenes with management to improve performance. It rarely pushes out a CEO the way some other activists do, and it often sticks around, often for years, as transformations occur.

After discussions with Trian, GE in March set a $2 billion cost-reduction target and linked the bonuses of its senior management to meeting profit-related goals. [nL3N1GZ4DQ]

As a board member at Bank of New York Mellon Corp , Garden most recently helped hire former Visa Inc CEO Charles Scharf to replace Gerald Hassell, who is retiring. Garden is also a board member of Pentair Plc .

Since its 2005 inception, Trian has returned an average 8 percent a year to investors, according to data from HSBC Holdings Plc's hedge fund investment arm.

BREAKINGVIEWS-GE needs Nelson Peltz's help - and takes it - Reuters Breakingviews

{{20171009T155927.290+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-GE needs Nelson Peltz's help - and takes it(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.)

By Richard Beales

NEW YORK, Oct 9 (Reuters Breakingviews) - General Electric's shareholders gained little during former boss Jeff Immelt's long tenure. John Flannery, his successor at the $200 billion U.S. industrial giant, still seems unable to get people excited about owning its shares. That might be why GE is putting a representative of Nelson Peltz-led Trian Fund management on its board. It's a contrast with Procter & Gamble , which is resisting Peltz's efforts to become a director.

Immelt began talking to Peltz even before Trian bought a stake in 2015. Though a GE veteran, Flannery only moved into the corner office in August. Last week, he took over as chairman as well, and made his mark with a series of top management changes. Perhaps more so than Immelt, Flannery may benefit from the experience Ed Garden, the Peltz lieutenant and son-in-law who will join GE's directors, has gleaned over many years on a raft of boards.

One challenge is to make GE's investment case more compelling. Immelt dismantled much of GE Capital, the company's Achilles heel during the financial crisis a decade ago, and kicked off other strategic changes. But the total shareholder return during his tenure ended up being just 6 percent. It's symptomatic of investors' attitude that the management and boardroom changes either side of the weekend sent the company's shares down 3 percent in Monday morning trade.

Embracing new ideas, which is one reason to add Garden, may help. Over at Procter & Gamble, a company with a market capitalization of $235 billion, the thinking is different. Tuesday's annual meeting of the consumer group's owners includes a vote on Peltz's attempt to join the board himself. P&G doesn't want him, even though its shares have underperformed – if not to the same extent as GE's – and the board could do with new perspectives.

Trian owns less than 1 percent of GE, a stake worth about $1.7 billion, and some 1.5 percent of P&G, valued at roughly $3.5 billion. Not every shareholder at that kind of level, activist or otherwise, deserves a board seat. Neither situation offers easy fixes, either. Yet Peltz, Garden et al have often made themselves valuable to chief executives, including some who weren't keen to begin with. Flannery needs the help, and is taking it. P&G boss David Taylor isn't interested – but his shareholders may wish he were.

RPT-New Wall Street candidates emerge to test Trump-era appeal - Reuters News

{{20171009T120313.293+0000}}RPT-New Wall Street candidates emerge to test Trump-era appeal(Repeats story that ran earlier with no change to headline or text)

By Olivia Oran and Lawrence Delevingne

Oct 9 (Reuters) - With a businessman turned politician now in the Oval Office, a small but growing number of bankers and Wall Street financiers across the United States have set their sights on politics.

In New Jersey, Connecticut and California, former bankers, hedge fund managers and private equity executives have either announced bids for legislative and gubernatorial seats, or associates have told Reuters they are considering running.

Meanwhile, industry trade groups including the American Bankers Association are launching formal programs to teach members in various states how to campaign successfully.

It is not the first time well-heeled candidates have entered American politics, and there are not a great number of them. But historians, political scientists and bankers say the atmosphere has changed abruptly under President Donald Trump.

"It's certainly raised the visibility of folks who in the past may have said 'I'm not a politician," said Richard Baier, president of the Nebraska Bankers Association, which is launching a training school for potential legislative candidates. "We've shown that you don't really need that background."

The Oklahoma Bankers Association is also planning to launch its own candidate school, a spokesman said.

Foreclosures, job losses and growing income inequality after the 2007-2009 financial crisis made anyone with Wall Street ties into a political pariah. But Trump, a self-described billionaire who made a fortune in New York real estate and entertainment, has stocked his cabinet with Wall Street bankers and industry tycoons.

His presidency has inspired others in the financial community to pursue civic duty, according to people who have studied campaigns or are involved with current election efforts.

Trump's ascendance shows that candidates' backgrounds matter less than whether they can connect with voters, said Joshua Sandman, a political science professor at the University of New Haven.

"Trump running has encouraged more people in financial services to test the waters," he said, "but the water could be murky for them unless they have a real set of positive experiences within business and are reflective of creating jobs and helping people."

It is hard to say quantitatively whether more candidates with finance backgrounds are pursuing political office now compared with prior election cycles. But Paul Herrnson, a political science professor at the University of Connecticut who has researched candidates' backgrounds, says he is skeptical about how successful the new crop of candidates will be.

"Sure, the mood is better than it was when the market collapsed, but I don't think people say, 'Wall Street financier – that's someone I can vote for," he said.

Phil Murphy, the Democratic candidate for New Jersey governor in 2017, a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc executive who spent 23 years at the firm, is perhaps the most prominent moneyed candidate.

His campaign has focused on bolstering the middle class with proposals to create a millionaire's tax and launch other initiatives to help low-income residents.

Murphy has won support from labor unions, environmental groups and consumer rights activists, as well as bold-faced names in the Democratic party like former Vice Presidents Joe Biden and Al Gore, who have both endorsed him.

An Oct. 3 Monmouth University Poll has him leading his Republican rival, Kim Guadagno by 14 points, and over 60 percent of New Jersey voters said Murphy's ties to Goldman do not matter in a recent Quinnipiac Poll.

"Obviously Goldman was his career," said Tony Bianchini, spokesman for the Northeast Regional Council of Carpenters, which is backing Murphy. "Everyone has a career."

In Connecticut, former UBS Group AG executive Robert Stefanowski is running for governor, according to a public filing, and hedge fund manager David Stemerman recently said he may do the same.

The two Republicans have given few clues about their campaign strategies other than to cast themselves as outsiders who can fix Connecticut's problems.

In California, two Wall Street veterans are mulling runs as progressive Democrats.

Tom Steyer, an environmentalist who worked at Goldman Sachs and was a hedge fund manager, may run for Senate or governor, a person familiar with the matter said. Joseph Sanberg, a former Tiger Global Management LLC executive, is also considering a Senate run, according to Politico. He casts himself as a "progressive entrepreneur" on his website.

Other ex-Wall Streeters who have entered politics have a mixed history, and much depends on how well their messages align with voters' concerns, political historians said.

For instance, while Mitt Romney's private-equity career helped doom his 2012 presidential bid, Illinois voters elected private equity executive Bruce Rauner as governor in 2014.

New Wall Street candidates emerge to test Trump-era appeal - Reuters News

{{20171009T115705.092+0000}}New Wall Street candidates emerge to test Trump-era appealBy Olivia Oran and Lawrence Delevingne

Oct 9 (Reuters) - With a businessman turned politician now in the Oval Office, a small but growing number of bankers and Wall Street financiers across the United States have set their sights on politics.

In New Jersey, Connecticut and California, former bankers, hedge fund managers and private equity executives have either announced bids for legislative and gubernatorial seats, or associates have told Reuters they are considering running.

Meanwhile, industry trade groups including the American Bankers Association are launching formal programs to teach members in various states how to campaign successfully.

It is not the first time well-heeled candidates have entered American politics, and there are not a great number of them. But historians, political scientists and bankers say the atmosphere has changed abruptly under President Donald Trump.

"It's certainly raised the visibility of folks who in the past may have said 'I'm not a politician," said Richard Baier, president of the Nebraska Bankers Association, which is launching a training school for potential legislative candidates. "We've shown that you don't really need that background."

The Oklahoma Bankers Association is also planning to launch its own candidate school, a spokesman said.

Foreclosures, job losses and growing income inequality after the 2007-2009 financial crisis made anyone with Wall Street ties into a political pariah. But Trump, a self-described billionaire who made a fortune in New York real estate and entertainment, has stocked his cabinet with Wall Street bankers and industry tycoons.

His presidency has inspired others in the financial community to pursue civic duty, according to people who have studied campaigns or are involved with current election efforts.

Trump's ascendance shows that candidates' backgrounds matter less than whether they can connect with voters, said Joshua Sandman, a political science professor at the University of New Haven.

"Trump running has encouraged more people in financial services to test the waters," he said, "but the water could be murky for them unless they have a real set of positive experiences within business and are reflective of creating jobs and helping people."

It is hard to say quantitatively whether more candidates with finance backgrounds are pursuing political office now compared with prior election cycles. But Paul Herrnson, a political science professor at the University of Connecticut who has researched candidates' backgrounds, says he is skeptical about how successful the new crop of candidates will be.

"Sure, the mood is better than it was when the market collapsed, but I don't think people say, 'Wall Street financier – that's someone I can vote for," he said.

Phil Murphy, the Democratic candidate for New Jersey governor in 2017, a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc executive who spent 23 years at the firm, is perhaps the most prominent moneyed candidate.

GE names Trian co-founder Ed Garden to board - Reuters News

{{20171009T114109.441+0000}}GE names Trian co-founder Ed Garden to boardOct 9 (Reuters) - U.S. industrial conglomerate General Electric Co said on Monday it had elected Ed Garden, the founding partner and chief investment officer of activist investment firm Trian Fund Management, to its board of directors.

Garden will replace Robert Lane, who is retiring due to health reasons, GE said in a statement.[nBw8YlG44a]

Nelson Peltz-led Trian, which has a stake of about 1 percent in GE, according to Thomson Reuters data, has been putting pressure on the company to improve its profit performance.

GE in March, after discussions with Trian, set a $2 billion cost-reduction target and linked the bonuses of its senior management to meeting profit-related goals. [nL3N1GZ4DQ]

"Like other GE shareholders, I am disappointed by the recent performance of GE's stock. But I continue to believe that GE represents an attractive long-term investment opportunity with significant upside," Garden said in a statement. [nBw7dNFlSa]

Garden is also a director at Bank of New York Mellon Corp and Pentair Plc .

BREAKINGVIEWS-GE needs Nelson Peltz's help - and takes it - Reuters Breakingviews

{{20171009T155927.290+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-GE needs Nelson Peltz's help - and takes it(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.)

By Richard Beales

NEW YORK, Oct 9 (Reuters Breakingviews) - General Electric's shareholders gained little during former boss Jeff Immelt's long tenure. John Flannery, his successor at the $200 billion U.S. industrial giant, still seems unable to get people excited about owning its shares. That might be why GE is putting a representative of Nelson Peltz-led Trian Fund management on its board. It's a contrast with Procter & Gamble , which is resisting Peltz's efforts to become a director.

Immelt began talking to Peltz even before Trian bought a stake in 2015. Though a GE veteran, Flannery only moved into the corner office in August. Last week, he took over as chairman as well, and made his mark with a series of top management changes. Perhaps more so than Immelt, Flannery may benefit from the experience Ed Garden, the Peltz lieutenant and son-in-law who will join GE's directors, has gleaned over many years on a raft of boards.

One challenge is to make GE's investment case more compelling. Immelt dismantled much of GE Capital, the company's Achilles heel during the financial crisis a decade ago, and kicked off other strategic changes. But the total shareholder return during his tenure ended up being just 6 percent. It's symptomatic of investors' attitude that the management and boardroom changes either side of the weekend sent the company's shares down 3 percent in Monday morning trade.

Embracing new ideas, which is one reason to add Garden, may help. Over at Procter & Gamble, a company with a market capitalization of $235 billion, the thinking is different. Tuesday's annual meeting of the consumer group's owners includes a vote on Peltz's attempt to join the board himself. P&G doesn't want him, even though its shares have underperformed – if not to the same extent as GE's – and the board could do with new perspectives.

Trian owns less than 1 percent of GE, a stake worth about $1.7 billion, and some 1.5 percent of P&G, valued at roughly $3.5 billion. Not every shareholder at that kind of level, activist or otherwise, deserves a board seat. Neither situation offers easy fixes, either. Yet Peltz, Garden et al have often made themselves valuable to chief executives, including some who weren't keen to begin with. Flannery needs the help, and is taking it. P&G boss David Taylor isn't interested – but his shareholders may wish he were.

Oct 9 (Reuters) - With a businessman turned politician now in the Oval Office, a small but growing number of bankers and Wall Street financiers across the United States have set their sights on politics.

In New Jersey, Connecticut and California, former bankers, hedge fund managers and private equity executives have either announced bids for legislative and gubernatorial seats, or associates have told Reuters they are considering running.

Meanwhile, industry trade groups including the American Bankers Association are launching formal programs to teach members in various states how to campaign successfully.

It is not the first time well-heeled candidates have entered American politics, and there are not a great number of them. But historians, political scientists and bankers say the atmosphere has changed abruptly under President Donald Trump.

Foreclosures, job losses and growing income inequality after the 2007-2009 financial crisis made anyone with Wall Street ties into a political pariah. But Trump, a self-described billionaire who made a fortune in New York real estate and entertainment, has stocked his cabinet with Wall Street bankers and industry tycoons.

His presidency has inspired others in the financial community to pursue civic duty, according to people who have studied campaigns or are involved with current election efforts.

Trump's ascendance shows that candidates' backgrounds matter less than whether they can connect with voters, said Joshua Sandman, a political science professor at the University of New Haven.

"Trump running has encouraged more people in financial services to test the waters," he said, "but the water could be murky for them unless they have a real set of positive experiences within business and are reflective of creating jobs and helping people."

It is hard to say quantitatively whether more candidates with finance backgrounds are pursuing political office now compared with prior election cycles. But Paul Herrnson, a political science professor at the University of Connecticut who has researched candidates' backgrounds, says he is skeptical about how successful the new crop of candidates will be.

"Sure, the mood is better than it was when the market collapsed, but I don't think people say, 'Wall Street financier – that's someone I can vote for," he said.

Phil Murphy, the Democratic candidate for New Jersey governor in 2017, a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc executive who spent 23 years at the firm, is perhaps the most prominent moneyed candidate.

His campaign has focused on bolstering the middle class with proposals to create a millionaire's tax and launch other initiatives to help low-income residents.

Murphy has won support from labor unions, environmental groups and consumer rights activists, as well as bold-faced names in the Democratic party like former Vice Presidents Joe Biden and Al Gore, who have both endorsed him.

An Oct. 3 Monmouth University Poll has him leading his Republican rival, Kim Guadagno by 14 points, and over 60 percent of New Jersey voters said Murphy's ties to Goldman do not matter in a recent Quinnipiac Poll.

"Obviously Goldman was his career," said Tony Bianchini, spokesman for the Northeast Regional Council of Carpenters, which is backing Murphy. "Everyone has a career."

In Connecticut, former UBS Group AG executive Robert Stefanowski is running for governor, according to a public filing, and hedge fund manager David Stemerman recently said he may do the same.

The two Republicans have given few clues about their campaign strategies other than to cast themselves as outsiders who can fix Connecticut's problems.

In California, two Wall Street veterans are mulling runs as progressive Democrats.

Tom Steyer, an environmentalist who worked at Goldman Sachs and was a hedge fund manager, may run for Senate or governor, a person familiar with the matter said. Joseph Sanberg, a former Tiger Global Management LLC executive, is also considering a Senate run, according to Politico. He casts himself as a "progressive entrepreneur" on his website.

Other ex-Wall Streeters who have entered politics have a mixed history, and much depends on how well their messages align with voters' concerns, political historians said.

For instance, while Mitt Romney's private-equity career helped doom his 2012 presidential bid, Illinois voters elected private equity executive Bruce Rauner as governor in 2014.

An Oct. 3 Monmouth University Poll has him leading his Republican rival, Kim Guadagno by 14 points, and over 60 percent of New Jersey voters said Murphy's ties to Goldman do not matter in a recent Quinnipiac Poll.

"Obviously Goldman was his career," said Tony Bianchini, spokesman for the Northeast Regional Council of Carpenters, which is backing Murphy. "Everyone has a career."

In Connecticut, former UBS Group AG executive Robert Stefanowski is running for governor, according to a public filing, and hedge fund manager David Stemerman recently said he may do the same.

The two Republicans have given few clues about their campaign strategies other than to cast themselves as outsiders who can fix Connecticut's problems.

In California, two Wall Street veterans are mulling runs as progressive Democrats.

Tom Steyer, an environmentalist who worked at Goldman Sachs and was a hedge fund manager, may run for Senate or governor, a person familiar with the matter said. Joseph Sanberg, a former Tiger Global Management LLC executive, is also considering a Senate run, according to Politico. He casts himself as a "progressive entrepreneur" on his website.

Other ex-Wall Streeters who have entered politics have a mixed history, and much depends on how well their messages align with voters' concerns, political historians said.

For instance, while Mitt Romney's private-equity career helped doom his 2012 presidential bid, Illinois voters elected private equity executive Bruce Rauner as governor in 2014.

GE names Trian co-founder Ed Garden to board - Reuters News

{{20171009T114109.441+0000}}GE names Trian co-founder Ed Garden to boardOct 9 (Reuters) - U.S. industrial conglomerate General Electric Co said on Monday it had elected Ed Garden, the founding partner and chief investment officer of activist investment firm Trian Fund Management, to its board of directors.

Garden will replace Robert Lane, who is retiring due to health reasons, GE said in a statement.[nBw8YlG44a]

Nelson Peltz-led Trian, which has a stake of about 1 percent in GE, according to Thomson Reuters data, has been putting pressure on the company to improve its profit performance.

GE in March, after discussions with Trian, set a $2 billion cost-reduction target and linked the bonuses of its senior management to meeting profit-related goals. [nL3N1GZ4DQ]

"Like other GE shareholders, I am disappointed by the recent performance of GE's stock. But I continue to believe that GE represents an attractive long-term investment opportunity with significant upside," Garden said in a statement. [nBw7dNFlSa]

Garden is also a director at Bank of New York Mellon Corp and Pentair Plc .

U.S. oil drillers cut rigs for 4th week in five -Baker Hughes - 路透新闻

{{20171006T170439.108+0000}}U.S. oil drillers cut rigs for 4th week in five -Baker HughesOct 6 (Reuters) - The U.S. oil rig count fell for a fourth
time in the last five weeks as a 14-month drilling recovery
stalled as energy firms reduced spending plans in response to
recent crude price declines.

The oil rig count fell by two to 748 in the week to Oct. 6,
General Electric Co's  Baker Hughes energy services firm
said in its closely followed report on Friday.

The rig count, an early indicator of future output, is much
higher than a year ago when only 428 rigs were active after
energy companies boosted spending plans earlier in the year in
anticipation of higher crude prices in coming months.

U.S. crude futures  have averaged more than $49 a
barrel so far in 2017, easily topping last year's $43.47
average. Looking ahead, futures were trading around $49 for the
balance of the year  and $50 for calendar 2018
.

Some exploration and production (E&P) companies have trimmed
their 2017 investment plans over the past few months due to
recent declines in crude futures, but they still plan to spend
more this year than in 2016.

Crude prices fell in six of the first nine months of 2017 as
rising U.S. output helped add to a global glut and were on track
to decline about 5 percent in October.

Analysts at Simmons & Co, energy specialists at U.S.
investment bank Piper Jaffray, this week revised downward their
forecast for the total oil and natural gas rig count, now
expecting it to average 881 in 2017, 960 in 2018 and 1,116 in
2019. Last week, it forecast 973 in 2017, 1,004 in 2018 and
1,084 in 2019.

That compares with 863 oil and gas rigs so far in 2017, 509
in 2016 and 978 in 2015. Most rigs produce both oil and gas.

Analysts at U.S. financial services firm Cowen & Co's
capital expenditure tracking was unchanged this week, showing
the 64 E&Ps it tracks planned to increase spending by an average
of 49 percent in 2017 from 2016.

That expected 2017 spending increase followed an estimated
48 percent decline in 2016 and a 34 percent decline in 2015,
Cowen said.

UPDATE 1-Airbus to recoup some engine nacelle work from suppliers - Reuters News

{{20171004T193841.790+0000}}UPDATE 1-Airbus to recoup some engine nacelle work from suppliers(Adds details, quotes)

By Tim Hepher

PARIS, Oct 4 (Reuters) - Airbus told European governments on Wednesday that it has made a strategic decision to bring the design of some nacelles or aircraft engine casings inside the company, rather than leaving it with suppliers, according to a presentation on its website.

It also said the troubled A400M military plane project will continue to "weigh significantly" on cashflow in 2017 and 2018 in particular, according to the presentation prepared on Oct. 4 and presented on Wednesday to governments that own shares in the European planemaker: France, Germany and Spain.

An Airbus spokesman said the decision had already been taken to recoup nacelle work carried out by United Technologies for engines supplied by the same company to power the A320neo jet.

United Technologies engine subsidiary Pratt & Whitney was not immediately available for comment.

The A320neo is offered with nacelles from United Technologies whenever it is mounted with engines made by Pratt & Whitney, or France's Safran for engines made by Safran's CFM joint venture with General Electric .

Airbus' decision to take control of some nacelles reflects a "strategic decision for competitiveness," according to the presentation, part of a series of investor briefings.

Safran was not immediately available for comment. A person close to the company said talks are under way with Airbus but stressed no decision had been taken.

"Bringing nacelle capability in-house allows Airbus to further improve nacelle aerodynamics to offer extra efficiency and better performance," the Airbus spokesman said.

The move comes amid growing concern among planemakers about the economic power of some major suppliers and an effort by planemakers to pull back more work to boost margins.

It comes weeks after United Technologies agreed to buy Rockwell Collins in a $23 billion deal. Airbus has urged United Tech not to let the merger draw its attention away from fixing industrial problems with the A320neo's Pratt & Whitney engines.

Under the project, industry sources say Airbus will redesign a number of key parts including the Pratt & Whitney engine's thrust reverser. It will also be responsible for integrating the engine housing and the pylon which attaches it to the wing.

One of the main goals is to reduce recurring costs to allow the recently introduced A320neo to be made more cheaply.

Until recently, the trend has been towards asking suppliers to take responsibility for piecing together large sub-systems.

Software maker FogHorn raises $30 mln in latest funding round - Reuters News

{{20171004T160001.189+0000}}Software maker FogHorn raises $30 mln in latest funding roundOct 4 (Reuters) - FogHorn Systems, whose software aims to save companies' money by streamlining data processing, said it has raised $30 million from investors led by Intel Capital and Saudi Aramco Energy Ventures.

Including the latest funding round, the company has so far raised $47.5 million, Chief Executive David King told Reuters in an interview on Monday.

He declined to disclose the company's current valuation.

Founded in 2014, FogHorn is one of the first companies to make software in the little-known area of fog or edge computing that locally analyzes data collected from sensors deployed in industrial equipment to increase speed and save costs.

Edge computing eliminates the need for sending the data to the cloud, instead processing the information where it was generated, in milliseconds.

Many industrial companies are deploying sensors or so-called Industrial Internet of Things, which enables machines to talk to each other and detect problems before they occur.

California-based FogHorn said Honeywell Ventures also took part in the latest funding round, joining existing investors March Capital, GE, Dell Technologies Capital, Robert Bosch Venture Capital, Yokogawa and Darling Ventures.

FogHorn's computing engine can run big data analytics and machine learning on devices that have lower processing power.

The company has forged partnerships with Intel, Dell, GE and other technology companies to get its technology integrated in their products.

FogHorn, which has dozens of customers including Saudi Aramco, GE , Dell and Hewlett Packard Enterprise , is in the early revenue generation stage, King said.

Robots under Swedish forest breathe life into ancient mines - Reuters News

{{20171004T090002.032+0000}}Robots under Swedish forest breathe life into ancient mines* Mining belatedly embraces digital innovation to boost efficiency

* Data, automation to benefit mining up to $373 bln by 2025

* Mining firms forging partnerships with tech companies

By Eric Onstad

GARPENBERG MINE, Sweden, Oct 4 (Reuters) - Hundreds of metres below the lush forests of rural Sweden, one of the world's most ancient mines has been transformed into one of the most modern.

Sensors linked to robotic equipment in Boliden's Garpenberg zinc mine – which has been in operation since the 13th century - feed data to operators above ground as screens blink and flash in a nearby control room.

Boliden is at the forefront of a global transformation in which mining companies are exploiting huge amounts of data being crunched by computers to dramatically boost productivity and cut costs.

The advances at Garpenberg, however, have only scratched the surface in exploiting the new technology. Fully automated mines are on the horizon.

"We have a way to go. There's a big possibility of working 24 hours a day with more automation," said Jenny Gotthardsson, general manager at Garpenberg.

To the north of Garpenberg, at other Boliden mines, Volvo is breaking new ground by testing self-driving trucks underground along with Ericsson which has installed cutting edge 5G mobile technology in a pilot.

Mining is one of the last sectors to use a surge in computer processing power, cloud data storage and complex algorithms to make sense of huge amounts of scattered information - routine in today's retail and manufacturing businesses.

The change could benefit the industry and its stakeholders by up to $373 billion by 2025, according to consultancy McKinsey.

"That value is basically by improving the current processes with the current generation of equipment," said McKinsey partner Richard Sellschop.

The estimate includes higher output and lower costs to boost profits of mining companies, but also the knock-on impact for mining equipment makers, countries who collect tax from miners and consumers who will benefit from lower raw material costs.

But it also points to seismic change for mining jobs that could spark conflict in developing countries if low-skilled miners are no longer needed in automated operations.

Some workers will retrain for high-tech jobs but full automation will mean fewer jobs overall. There may be opposition from trade unions in places such as South Africa.

"Everywhere where mechanization has been implemented, even in Australia, it has led to massive retrenchments. We know what's coming," said Livhuwani Mammburu, spokesman for the National Union of Mineworkers.

"Companies must start training workers in preparation for mechanization and other technologies."

SECRET WEAPONS

Boliden was an early mover but other mining groups are also adopting the latest technology, in some cases cloaking their initiatives in secrecy to get ahead of rivals.

Los-Angeles-based technology firm DAQRI said mining groups using its new augmented reality helmet insisted on anonymity to guard their advantage.

DAQRI's futuristic Smart Helmet funnels data to workers, projecting instructions on repairing equipment, thermal images, map data or video conferences with experts anywhere in the world.

Rio Tinto , the world's second biggest iron ore producer, aims to deliver $5 billion of productivity improvements over five years, much of it through data and technology.

Chief Executive Jean-Sébastien Jacques told Reuters earlier this year that each of its global fleet of around 900 trucks has some 40 sensors.

"If we can analyse this data in real time and convert this data into insight, then we will be able to run those trucks even better," he said.

Rio already has a smartphone app with data on its fleet of trucks in the rich iron ore Pilbara area of Western Australia.

BHP , the world's biggest mining group, said recently it was trialling sensors to analyse properties of metal in real-time at its huge copper operation Escondida in Chile.

The recent move to exploit data and technology in mining has helped the sector recover from a long-term slump in productivity estimated by accountancy firm EY to be as much as 40 percent.

Since 2000 miners have been competing to feed China's huge appetite for metals and so paid less attention to costs and efficiency.

The fall in mining productivity hit bottom in about 2013 and has been clawing higher since then, with some companies seeing productivity rising by 15-20 percent, according to EY.

"This uptick coincides with the trend toward adoption of digital technology and innovation among many companies," said Paul Mitchell, EY's global advisory leader in mining.

The biggest gold producer Barrick Gold Corp plans to spend $100 million on technology in a partnership with Cisco Systems while Australia's South32 this year forged an alliance with General Electric . [nL1N1BO0UH]

TRANSFORMATION

In 2006, the Garpenberg mine, located about 180 km northwest of Stockholm in an area where mining has occurred since 375 B.C., was struggling to compete. But in 2013 Boliden started transforming its operations with automation and data. It is now one of the world's most productive zinc mines.

"We decided to become an early adopter," said Mikael Staffas, president of Boliden Mines. An expansion of output also helped lower costs through economies of scale.

By 2016, it had halved cash costs to 44 cents per lb, adjusted for inflation, according to consultancy Wood Mackenzie.

Thousands of sensors, including ones that track every worker, send data above ground at Garpenberg, boosting safety and allowing more efficient ventilation and ore loading.

Swedish companies Sandvik , Atlas Copco ABB and Volvo are among those to use Boliden as a testing ground for new products.

Kristofer Ruth, a miner who has worked there for 11 years, rarely ventures underground anymore. He manoeuvres a joystick that shovels ore into an automated truck about 800 metres below.

He no longer wastes time evacuating the mine during twice-daily blasting and can move the vehicle into areas that might be unsafe for workers.

"We can work at least six hours more a day," he said.

UPDATE 1-France to lead investigation into A380 engine explosion - Reuters News

{{20171003T215521.804+0000}}UPDATE 1-France to lead investigation into A380 engine explosion(Adds details, background)

By Tim Hepher

PARIS, Oct 3 (Reuters) - France's air accident investigation agency said on Tuesday it would lead the probe into an engine explosion that prompted the emergency landing of an Air France A380 superjumbo in Canada with over 500 people on board on Saturday.

Reuters reported on Monday that Canada, France and the United States were debating who should lead the investigation into the accident, which took place high over Greenland. [nL8N1MD5G2]

The decision to hand control to the BEA means investigators can begin planning an unusual search in potentially inhospitable terrain to find a missing 3-metre-(9.8-foot)-wide fan that ripped off the engine in midair.

The BEA confirmed that the engine's main fan and inlet had become detached. It now plans with Danish help to search for the missing parts.

"That's what is envisaged, but it depends on snow conditions," a BEA spokesman said. A preliminary reading of the plane's data recorder in Canada has identified a search area.

The BEA said damage was limited to the right-outer no.4 engine and its immediate surroundings, boosting chances that the aircraft can be flown back to Europe for further examination.

TUSSLE FOR CONTROL

The A380 is the world's largest airliner and a European icon with a history of attracting debate because of its high public profile, and the start of the probe appeared to be no exception.

Under aviation law, the job of investigating belongs to Denmark since the blowout happened over Greenland, which is part of Denmark with self-government over domestic affairs.

With three other major aviation nations involved, each equipped with sophisticated testing equipment, Denmark exercised its right to delegate the main role. But people briefed on the talks said it took days to agree who should take its place.

Canada was seen as keen to keep control of the case, but aviation experts said France had priority because that was where the plane was built, designed, registered and operated.

Canadian investigators will remain involved along with counterparts from the United States, France and Denmark, whose expertise is needed to track down the missing fan.

They will be helped by Airbus and U.S. engine maker Engine Alliance, co-owned by General Electric and Pratt & Whitney .

Experts say such engine accidents are rare but must be investigated thoroughly because of the significant damage they can cause. In 2010, a Qantas A380 made an emergency landing in Singapore after a Rolls-Royce engine exploded shortly after take-off. Investigators blamed a badly manufactured part.

U.S. oil drillers cut rigs for 4th week in five -Baker Hughes - 路透新闻

{{20171006T170439.108+0000}}U.S. oil drillers cut rigs for 4th week in five -Baker HughesOct 6 (Reuters) - The U.S. oil rig count fell for a fourth
time in the last five weeks as a 14-month drilling recovery
stalled as energy firms reduced spending plans in response to
recent crude price declines.

The oil rig count fell by two to 748 in the week to Oct. 6,
General Electric Co's  Baker Hughes energy services firm
said in its closely followed report on Friday.

The rig count, an early indicator of future output, is much
higher than a year ago when only 428 rigs were active after
energy companies boosted spending plans earlier in the year in
anticipation of higher crude prices in coming months.

U.S. crude futures  have averaged more than $49 a
barrel so far in 2017, easily topping last year's $43.47
average. Looking ahead, futures were trading around $49 for the
balance of the year  and $50 for calendar 2018
.

Some exploration and production (E&P) companies have trimmed
their 2017 investment plans over the past few months due to
recent declines in crude futures, but they still plan to spend
more this year than in 2016.

Crude prices fell in six of the first nine months of 2017 as
rising U.S. output helped add to a global glut and were on track
to decline about 5 percent in October.

Analysts at Simmons & Co, energy specialists at U.S.
investment bank Piper Jaffray, this week revised downward their
forecast for the total oil and natural gas rig count, now
expecting it to average 881 in 2017, 960 in 2018 and 1,116 in
2019. Last week, it forecast 973 in 2017, 1,004 in 2018 and
1,084 in 2019.

That compares with 863 oil and gas rigs so far in 2017, 509
in 2016 and 978 in 2015. Most rigs produce both oil and gas.

Analysts at U.S. financial services firm Cowen & Co's
capital expenditure tracking was unchanged this week, showing
the 64 E&Ps it tracks planned to increase spending by an average
of 49 percent in 2017 from 2016.

That expected 2017 spending increase followed an estimated
48 percent decline in 2016 and a 34 percent decline in 2015,
Cowen said.

UPDATE 1-Airbus to recoup some engine nacelle work from suppliers - Reuters News

{{20171004T193841.790+0000}}UPDATE 1-Airbus to recoup some engine nacelle work from suppliers(Adds details, quotes)

By Tim Hepher

PARIS, Oct 4 (Reuters) - Airbus told European governments on Wednesday that it has made a strategic decision to bring the design of some nacelles or aircraft engine casings inside the company, rather than leaving it with suppliers, according to a presentation on its website.

It also said the troubled A400M military plane project will continue to "weigh significantly" on cashflow in 2017 and 2018 in particular, according to the presentation prepared on Oct. 4 and presented on Wednesday to governments that own shares in the European planemaker: France, Germany and Spain.

An Airbus spokesman said the decision had already been taken to recoup nacelle work carried out by United Technologies for engines supplied by the same company to power the A320neo jet.

United Technologies engine subsidiary Pratt & Whitney was not immediately available for comment.

The A320neo is offered with nacelles from United Technologies whenever it is mounted with engines made by Pratt & Whitney, or France's Safran for engines made by Safran's CFM joint venture with General Electric .

Airbus' decision to take control of some nacelles reflects a "strategic decision for competitiveness," according to the presentation, part of a series of investor briefings.

Safran was not immediately available for comment. A person close to the company said talks are under way with Airbus but stressed no decision had been taken.

"Bringing nacelle capability in-house allows Airbus to further improve nacelle aerodynamics to offer extra efficiency and better performance," the Airbus spokesman said.

The move comes amid growing concern among planemakers about the economic power of some major suppliers and an effort by planemakers to pull back more work to boost margins.

It comes weeks after United Technologies agreed to buy Rockwell Collins in a $23 billion deal. Airbus has urged United Tech not to let the merger draw its attention away from fixing industrial problems with the A320neo's Pratt & Whitney engines.

Under the project, industry sources say Airbus will redesign a number of key parts including the Pratt & Whitney engine's thrust reverser. It will also be responsible for integrating the engine housing and the pylon which attaches it to the wing.

One of the main goals is to reduce recurring costs to allow the recently introduced A320neo to be made more cheaply.

Until recently, the trend has been towards asking suppliers to take responsibility for piecing together large sub-systems.

Software maker FogHorn raises $30 mln in latest funding round - Reuters News

{{20171004T160001.189+0000}}Software maker FogHorn raises $30 mln in latest funding roundOct 4 (Reuters) - FogHorn Systems, whose software aims to save companies' money by streamlining data processing, said it has raised $30 million from investors led by Intel Capital and Saudi Aramco Energy Ventures.

Including the latest funding round, the company has so far raised $47.5 million, Chief Executive David King told Reuters in an interview on Monday.

He declined to disclose the company's current valuation.

Founded in 2014, FogHorn is one of the first companies to make software in the little-known area of fog or edge computing that locally analyzes data collected from sensors deployed in industrial equipment to increase speed and save costs.

Edge computing eliminates the need for sending the data to the cloud, instead processing the information where it was generated, in milliseconds.

Many industrial companies are deploying sensors or so-called Industrial Internet of Things, which enables machines to talk to each other and detect problems before they occur.

California-based FogHorn said Honeywell Ventures also took part in the latest funding round, joining existing investors March Capital, GE, Dell Technologies Capital, Robert Bosch Venture Capital, Yokogawa and Darling Ventures.

FogHorn's computing engine can run big data analytics and machine learning on devices that have lower processing power.

The company has forged partnerships with Intel, Dell, GE and other technology companies to get its technology integrated in their products.

FogHorn, which has dozens of customers including Saudi Aramco, GE , Dell and Hewlett Packard Enterprise , is in the early revenue generation stage, King said.

Robots under Swedish forest breathe life into ancient mines - Reuters News

{{20171004T090002.032+0000}}Robots under Swedish forest breathe life into ancient mines* Mining belatedly embraces digital innovation to boost efficiency

* Data, automation to benefit mining up to $373 bln by 2025

* Mining firms forging partnerships with tech companies

By Eric Onstad

GARPENBERG MINE, Sweden, Oct 4 (Reuters) - Hundreds of metres below the lush forests of rural Sweden, one of the world's most ancient mines has been transformed into one of the most modern.

Sensors linked to robotic equipment in Boliden's Garpenberg zinc mine – which has been in operation since the 13th century - feed data to operators above ground as screens blink and flash in a nearby control room.

Boliden is at the forefront of a global transformation in which mining companies are exploiting huge amounts of data being crunched by computers to dramatically boost productivity and cut costs.

The advances at Garpenberg, however, have only scratched the surface in exploiting the new technology. Fully automated mines are on the horizon.

"We have a way to go. There's a big possibility of working 24 hours a day with more automation," said Jenny Gotthardsson, general manager at Garpenberg.

To the north of Garpenberg, at other Boliden mines, Volvo is breaking new ground by testing self-driving trucks underground along with Ericsson which has installed cutting edge 5G mobile technology in a pilot.

Mining is one of the last sectors to use a surge in computer processing power, cloud data storage and complex algorithms to make sense of huge amounts of scattered information - routine in today's retail and manufacturing businesses.

The change could benefit the industry and its stakeholders by up to $373 billion by 2025, according to consultancy McKinsey.

"That value is basically by improving the current processes with the current generation of equipment," said McKinsey partner Richard Sellschop.

The estimate includes higher output and lower costs to boost profits of mining companies, but also the knock-on impact for mining equipment makers, countries who collect tax from miners and consumers who will benefit from lower raw material costs.

But it also points to seismic change for mining jobs that could spark conflict in developing countries if low-skilled miners are no longer needed in automated operations.

Some workers will retrain for high-tech jobs but full automation will mean fewer jobs overall. There may be opposition from trade unions in places such as South Africa.

"Everywhere where mechanization has been implemented, even in Australia, it has led to massive retrenchments. We know what's coming," said Livhuwani Mammburu, spokesman for the National Union of Mineworkers.

"Companies must start training workers in preparation for mechanization and other technologies."

SECRET WEAPONS

Boliden was an early mover but other mining groups are also adopting the latest technology, in some cases cloaking their initiatives in secrecy to get ahead of rivals.

Los-Angeles-based technology firm DAQRI said mining groups using its new augmented reality helmet insisted on anonymity to guard their advantage.

DAQRI's futuristic Smart Helmet funnels data to workers, projecting instructions on repairing equipment, thermal images, map data or video conferences with experts anywhere in the world.

Rio Tinto , the world's second biggest iron ore producer, aims to deliver $5 billion of productivity improvements over five years, much of it through data and technology.

Chief Executive Jean-Sébastien Jacques told Reuters earlier this year that each of its global fleet of around 900 trucks has some 40 sensors.

"If we can analyse this data in real time and convert this data into insight, then we will be able to run those trucks even better," he said.

Rio already has a smartphone app with data on its fleet of trucks in the rich iron ore Pilbara area of Western Australia.

BHP , the world's biggest mining group, said recently it was trialling sensors to analyse properties of metal in real-time at its huge copper operation Escondida in Chile.

The recent move to exploit data and technology in mining has helped the sector recover from a long-term slump in productivity estimated by accountancy firm EY to be as much as 40 percent.

Since 2000 miners have been competing to feed China's huge appetite for metals and so paid less attention to costs and efficiency.

The fall in mining productivity hit bottom in about 2013 and has been clawing higher since then, with some companies seeing productivity rising by 15-20 percent, according to EY.

"This uptick coincides with the trend toward adoption of digital technology and innovation among many companies," said Paul Mitchell, EY's global advisory leader in mining.

The biggest gold producer Barrick Gold Corp plans to spend $100 million on technology in a partnership with Cisco Systems while Australia's South32 this year forged an alliance with General Electric . [nL1N1BO0UH]

TRANSFORMATION

In 2006, the Garpenberg mine, located about 180 km northwest of Stockholm in an area where mining has occurred since 375 B.C., was struggling to compete. But in 2013 Boliden started transforming its operations with automation and data. It is now one of the world's most productive zinc mines.

"We decided to become an early adopter," said Mikael Staffas, president of Boliden Mines. An expansion of output also helped lower costs through economies of scale.

By 2016, it had halved cash costs to 44 cents per lb, adjusted for inflation, according to consultancy Wood Mackenzie.

Thousands of sensors, including ones that track every worker, send data above ground at Garpenberg, boosting safety and allowing more efficient ventilation and ore loading.

Swedish companies Sandvik , Atlas Copco ABB and Volvo are among those to use Boliden as a testing ground for new products.

Kristofer Ruth, a miner who has worked there for 11 years, rarely ventures underground anymore. He manoeuvres a joystick that shovels ore into an automated truck about 800 metres below.

He no longer wastes time evacuating the mine during twice-daily blasting and can move the vehicle into areas that might be unsafe for workers.

"We can work at least six hours more a day," he said.

UPDATE 1-France to lead investigation into A380 engine explosion - Reuters News

{{20171003T215521.804+0000}}UPDATE 1-France to lead investigation into A380 engine explosion(Adds details, background)

By Tim Hepher

PARIS, Oct 3 (Reuters) - France's air accident investigation agency said on Tuesday it would lead the probe into an engine explosion that prompted the emergency landing of an Air France A380 superjumbo in Canada with over 500 people on board on Saturday.

Reuters reported on Monday that Canada, France and the United States were debating who should lead the investigation into the accident, which took place high over Greenland. [nL8N1MD5G2]

The decision to hand control to the BEA means investigators can begin planning an unusual search in potentially inhospitable terrain to find a missing 3-metre-(9.8-foot)-wide fan that ripped off the engine in midair.

Nobody was injured in the incident, in which Air France Flight 66, originating in Paris and bound for Los Angeles, declared a mayday and diverted to Goose Bay in Labrador. [nL2N1MB0EO]

The BEA confirmed that the engine's main fan and inlet had become detached. It now plans with Danish help to search for the missing parts.

"That's what is envisaged, but it depends on snow conditions," a BEA spokesman said. A preliminary reading of the plane's data recorder in Canada has identified a search area.

The BEA said damage was limited to the right-outer no.4 engine and its immediate surroundings, boosting chances that the aircraft can be flown back to Europe for further examination.

TUSSLE FOR CONTROL

The A380 is the world's largest airliner and a European icon with a history of attracting debate because of its high public profile, and the start of the probe appeared to be no exception.

Under aviation law, the job of investigating belongs to Denmark since the blowout happened over Greenland, which is part of Denmark with self-government over domestic affairs.

With three other major aviation nations involved, each equipped with sophisticated testing equipment, Denmark exercised its right to delegate the main role. But people briefed on the talks said it took days to agree who should take its place.

Canada was seen as keen to keep control of the case, but aviation experts said France had priority because that was where the plane was built, designed, registered and operated.

Canadian investigators will remain involved along with counterparts from the United States, France and Denmark, whose expertise is needed to track down the missing fan.

They will be helped by Airbus and U.S. engine maker Engine Alliance, co-owned by General Electric and Pratt & Whitney .

Experts say such engine accidents are rare but must be investigated thoroughly because of the significant damage they can cause. In 2010, a Qantas A380 made an emergency landing in Singapore after a Rolls-Royce engine exploded shortly after take-off. Investigators blamed a badly manufactured part.

Agencies dither over who leads A380 engine explosion probe - Reuters News

{{20171002T162220.430+0000}}Agencies dither over who leads A380 engine explosion probePARIS, Oct 2 (Reuters) - Air accident investigators from both sides of the Atlantic are struggling to decide who should lead a probe into an engine explosion that forced an Air France A380 to make an emergency landing in Canada, people familiar with the matter said.

Two days after the damaged superjumbo landed at Goose Bay in Labrador with over 500 people on board, a formal investigation had yet to be announced, a step that typically takes hours.

Experts from the United States and France, as well as planemaker Airbus and U.S-based engine maker Engine Alliance , have been sent to Goose Bay.

But a spokesman for France's BEA air accident agency said no investigation had yet been formally launched.

The decision on who should lead an investigation depends on a number of factors including, first and foremost, the country where the incident took place.

Airline sources said an "uncontained explosion," which ripped off the outer-right engine's three-metre-wide fan together with its housing from the front of the engine, happened over Greenland, which comes under Danish jurisdiction.

Under aviation law, Denmark would officially own the investigation but it can delegate it to another country.

Denmark's accident agency was not available for comment.

France and the United States would automatically be part of any investigation, since the aircraft and engine were made in those countries respectively.

France is additionally likely to argue it would well placed to lead the investigation, if Denmark takes a backseat, because the seven-year-old double-decker passenger plane was being operated on France's aircraft register by a French carrier.

Nobody was injured in the incident, in which Air France Flight 66, originating in Paris and bound for Los Angeles, declared a mayday and diverted to Canada. [nL2N1MB0EO]

Airbus has issued an alert to all operators of the aircraft that use the same type of engine, confirming the low-pressure compressor fan had been separated. No cause had yet been identified, it said, according to one recipient.

In 2010, a Rolls-Royce engine on a Qantas A380 suffered mid-air damage after taking off in Singapore. An investigation blamed a leak from a badly made engine pipe.

Smartphones made in India? Manufacturing ambition hits hurdles - Reuters News

{{20171002T045138.368+0000}}Smartphones made in India? Manufacturing ambition hits hurdles* India only able to assemble phones

* Industry execs cite lack of engineers, labour unrest

* Sparse supplier network another hurdle, they say

* High profile tax disputes, GE contract also noted

By Sankalp Phartiyal

NEW DELHI, Oct 2 (Reuters) - India's ambitions to become a smartphone-making powerhouse are foundering over a lack of skilled labour and part suppliers along with a complex tax regime, industry executives say.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi has championed a manufacturing drive, under the slogan 'Make in India', to boost the sluggish economy and create millions of jobs. Among the headline-grabbing details was a plan to eventually make Apple iPhones in India.

Three years on, as executives and bureaucrats crowded into a Delhi convention centre for an inaugural mobile congress last week, India has managed only to assemble phones from imported components.

While contract manufacturers such as iPhone-maker Foxconn Technology Co <2354.TW> and Flextronics Corp have set up base in India, one of the world's fastest-growing smartphone markets, almost none of the higher value chip sets, cameras and other high-end components are made domestically.

Plans for Taiwan-based Foxconn to build an electronics plant in the state of Maharashtra, which local officials said in 2015 could employ some 50,000 people, have gone quiet.

According to tech research firm Counterpoint, while phones are assembled domestically because of taxes on imported phones, locally made content in those phones is usually restricted to headphones and chargers - about 5 percent of a device's cost.

"Rather than feeling that India is a place where I should be making mobile phones, it's more like this is the place I need to (assemble) phones because there is lower duty if I import components and assemble here," a senior executive with a Chinese smartphone maker said.

He declined to be named for fear of harming business.

TAX DISPUTES

Others listed the lack of skilled engineers and a sparse network of local component makers. They also cited high-profile tax disputes between India and foreign companies such as Nokia . Nokia eventually suspended mobile handset production at its southern India facility.

"The Nokia escapade is in people's memory when they try to come here," a second industry source told Reuters at the first Indian Mobile Congress in capital New Delhi, which ended on Friday.

India's nationwide sales tax (GST), which kicked in this year to replace a string of different levies, is also fraught with its own challenges, such as a lengthy tax-refund process that delays payments to suppliers, the source added.

Last week, India rattled investors after publicly musing about possible changes in a $2.6 billion 2015 diesel locomotive contract with General Electric . The government has since said it would not take any hasty decisions. [nL4N1M92Q0]

"We needed some push from the government to start manufacturing," said Neeraj Sharma, the India head of Chinese chipmaker Spreadtrum. "It was required, because without that nothing was happening."

But India now needs more sophisticated technology - such as surface-mounting technology, which places components directly on top of a printed board - to build a supply chain, he said.

Otherwise, firms will not do research in India, Sharma said. "For design to happen, we need strong local players."

PHASED PROGRAMME

The government says it has a phased programme to manufacture phones, aiming to step up value added locally every year.

"While we have made a start with getting in mobile assembling, we want to move up the value chain," India's telecoms secretary Aruna Sundarajan told reporters. "A lot of investors have shown very significant interest in this area."

The Phased Manufacturing Programme began in 2016 with the manufacture of phone chargers and batteries and envisages the production of higher-end components by 2020.

Sundarajan said the government was also trying to give investors "a reasonable degree of certainty", while also dealing with constant disruption to the industry.

But for smartphone makers used to China's predictability, India may need to do more, executives warn.

A third senior source at a Chinese smartphone maker in India said some Chinese players were rattled by labour unrest, including suspended operations at a facility belonging to smartphone maker Oppo earlier this year, after a foreign employee was reported to have torn a picture of the Indian flag.

Oppo said at the time it regretted the incident.[nNRA3knymi]

"Labour laws are lax, there's little effort to build a component ecosystem and logistics, and transport remains a big problem," the third source said.

"No one seems to be investing in skilled labour that will build the phones

UPDATE 1-Air France flight with engine damage makes emergency landing in Canada - Reuters News

{{20170930T194021.392+0000}}UPDATE 1-Air France flight with engine damage makes emergency landing in CanadaSept 30 (Reuters) - An Air France flight from Paris to Los Angeles made an emergency landing in eastern Canada on Saturday after one of its four engines sustained "serious damage" over the Atlantic, the airline said.

Air France Flight 66, originating at Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport, landed at Goose Bay in Labrador at 1542 GMT, the airline said, and no one was hurt in the incident.

"The regularly trained pilots and cabin crew handled this serious incident perfectly," the airline said in a statement.

The aircraft involved in the incident was an Airbus 380 that was about seven years old, according to airfleets.net, an aircraft database. The engine was made by Engine Alliance, a joint venture between General Electric Co and United Technologies Corp's Pratt & Whitney unit.

The forced landing in Canada's easternmost province is reminiscent of an incident seven years ago in which one of the Rolls Royce engines on a Qantas A380 suffered mid-engine damage after taking off in Singapore. The November 2010 incident prompted the grounding of the entire Qantas A380 fleet -- six A380s at the time -- for over three weeks.

Photographs taken by passengers aboard the Air France flight circulated on the internet soon after the aircraft landed. The images appeared to show that the inlet, or front part, of the engine had torn off, but the main part of the engine was intact. Rick Engebretsen, one of the passengers, wrote a Twitter message saying he had heard a loud thud and felt vibration while in the air. It was not immediately clear how the engine became damaged. Airbus was not immediately available for comment. Engine Alliance said in a statement that it was looking into "reports of an issue" involving one of its engines.

Officials with the Transportation Safety Board of Canada could not immediately be reached for comment on Saturday. The airline said it was making arrangements to send the plane's passengers to their destination of Los Angeles.

Aircraft on trans-Atlantic flights commonly use Goose Bay Airport in the province of Newfoundland and Labrador for emergency fueling stops.
