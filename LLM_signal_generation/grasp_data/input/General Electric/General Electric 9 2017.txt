UPDATE 1-Air France flight with engine damage makes emergency landing in Canada - Reuters News

{{20170930T194021.392+0000}}UPDATE 1-Air France flight with engine damage makes emergency landing in CanadaSept 30 (Reuters) - An Air France flight from Paris to Los Angeles made an emergency landing in eastern Canada on Saturday after one of its four engines sustained "serious damage" over the Atlantic, the airline said.

Air France Flight 66, originating at Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport, landed at Goose Bay in Labrador at 1542 GMT, the airline said, and no one was hurt in the incident.

"The regularly trained pilots and cabin crew handled this serious incident perfectly," the airline said in a statement.

The aircraft involved in the incident was an Airbus 380 that was about seven years old, according to airfleets.net, an aircraft database. The engine was made by Engine Alliance, a joint venture between General Electric Co and United Technologies Corp's Pratt & Whitney unit.

The forced landing in Canada's easternmost province is reminiscent of an incident seven years ago in which one of the Rolls Royce engines on a Qantas A380 suffered mid-engine damage after taking off in Singapore. The November 2010 incident prompted the grounding of the entire Qantas A380 fleet -- six A380s at the time -- for over three weeks.

Photographs taken by passengers aboard the Air France flight circulated on the internet soon after the aircraft landed. The images appeared to show that the inlet, or front part, of the engine had torn off, but the main part of the engine was intact. Rick Engebretsen, one of the passengers, wrote a Twitter message saying he had heard a loud thud and felt vibration while in the air. It was not immediately clear how the engine became damaged. Airbus was not immediately available for comment. Engine Alliance said in a statement that it was looking into "reports of an issue" involving one of its engines.

Officials with the Transportation Safety Board of Canada could not immediately be reached for comment on Saturday. The airline said it was making arrangements to send the plane's passengers to their destination of Los Angeles.

Aircraft on trans-Atlantic flights commonly use Goose Bay Airport in the province of Newfoundland and Labrador for emergency fueling stops.

U.S. drillers add oil rigs for first week since mid-August -Baker Hughes - 路透新闻

{{20170929T172105.834+0000}}U.S. drillers add oil rigs for first week since mid-August -Baker HughesSept 29 (Reuters) - U.S. energy companies added oil rigs for
the first week in seven after a 14-month drilling recovery
stalled in August as crude prices were on track for their
strongest third quarter in 10 years.

The U.S. oil rig count, however, is down for the second
month in a row and posted its biggest monthly and quarterly
declines since the second quarter of 2016.

Drillers added six oil rigs in the week to Sept. 29,
bringing the total count up to 750, General Electric Co's 
Baker Hughes energy services firm said in its closely followed
report on Friday.

The rig count, an early indicator of future output, is still
higher than the 425 active oil rigs a year ago as energy
companies pursued ambitious spending programs for 2017.

For the month of September, the rig count fell by nine,
after dropping by seven in August.

This is the first consecutive monthly reduction since May
2016, after which the drilling recovery took off because of
higher oil prices.

The rig count also dropped by six in the third quarter, the
first decline over a three-month period since the second quarter
of 2016.

U.S. crude futures  have risen to around $52 per
barrel this week due to supply concerns, including a global
producer's deal to curb output. [O/R]

Crude prices were up over 9 percent so far this month, the
biggest monthly increase since April 2016, after declining in
five of the past six months, including a near 6 percent drop in
August as rising U.S. output helped to add to a global glut.

In spite of higher oil prices, Total SA  this week
adjusted its capital expenditure plans for 2017 to $14 billion,
the low end of its previous $14-$15 billion range. [nL8N1M6344]

Although several exploration and production (E&P) companies
have trimmed their investments for this year due to the drop in
crude prices, they still planned to spend much more this year
than last year.

Analysts at Simmons & Co, energy specialists at U.S.
investment bank Piper Jaffray, this week revised higher its
forecast for the total oil and gas rig count, now expecting it
to rise to an average of 973 in 2017, 1,004 in 2018 and 1,084 in
2019. Last week, it forecast 881 in 2017, 959 in 2018 and 1,114
in 2019.

That compares with 861 oil and gas rigs so far in 2017, 509
in 2016 and 978 in 2015.

UPDATE 2-India says GE diesel locomotive factory on track, but to pursue electrification  - Reuters News

{{20170928T104724.288+0000}}UPDATE 2-India says GE diesel locomotive factory on track, but to pursue electrification * US firm concerned about policy changes

* New minister seeks electric locomotives

* One of the largest railways contracts given to a foreign firm

(Adds more comments from minister)

By Neha Dasgupta

NEW DELHI, Sept 28 (Reuters) - General Electric's plan to build a diesel locomotive factory in eastern India is proceeding as planned, the nation's railways minister said on Thursday, aiming to allay the U.S. firm's concerns that India was unilaterally making changes to the contract.

Piyush Goyal's comments came after GE said this week that the Indian government could incur costs and its 'Make in India' initiative would be undermined if the railway ministry went ahead with changes to the scope of a joint venture of GE and the state-controlled network. [nL4N1M74VK]

"Work in the factory is going on as per plan," he told reporters.

GE had won a $2.6 billion contract in 2015 to supply the railways with 1,000 diesel locomotives and began work on a plant in an impoverished corner of eastern India, in one of the largest direct foreign investment projects in the South Asian nation.

But the railways ministry said last week it wouldn't need diesel engines after all - hoping to save on fuel and maintenance costs - and suggested GE might want to make electric locomotives instead.

The contract to GE is one of the largest to be awarded to a foreign firm since India allowed 100 percent foreign direct investment in parts of its railways, and is part of a $137 billion programme to overhaul the vast but dilapidated network by 2020.

The uncertainty over the railway locomotives investment has come at a time when the government is facing political pressure after economic growth slowed to its weakest pace in three years. [nL8N1LI008]

A government source said Prime Minister Narendra Modi's office had intervened after GE raised its concerns and the railways had not made a written proposal for a change of plans from diesel to an all-electric fleet to power the world's fourth largest rail network.

GE had approached Modi's office seeking clarity on the issue, an aide to Modi said. "We told them we will look into the matter and that we respect their commitment to the Indian railways."

GE did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The apparent policy shift raised fears for the future of investments in the country, especially Modi's indigenisation drive to create tens of thousands of jobs for a swelling workforce.

Goyal, who took charge of railways last month, said the government had no plans to make sudden changes in policy and there was no threat to the GE plant in the eastern Indian state of Bihar.

"Our government does not make any sudden changes in policy...we take considered decisions...The Marhaura factory is being set up and I think it's on track."

But he said he was in talks with GE to explore ways of cutting costs including the railways' broader goal of electrification which could lead to savings of millions of dollars on fuel costs alone, besides a lower carbon footprint. GE already has investments in India's power, healthcare and transportation sectors.

"Going for electrification in a much faster manner, is in the interest of the people of India," he said, adding he had fruitful meetings with GE in that regard and that these were internal discussions aimed at improving the network.

"Can we look at opportunities going forward where we can meet the twin objectives of reducing pollution, saving cost in the overall interest of the country and yet making sure that the contracts or the agreements that are made by the country or by the railways continues to serve the people of India in the best interests of India?" he said.

UPDATE 1-Abu Dhabi state fund Mubadala swings to profit, assets grow - Reuters News

{{20170928T102743.857+0000}}UPDATE 1-Abu Dhabi state fund Mubadala swings to profit, assets grow(Adds details, quotes, background)

By Stanley Carvalho

ABU DHABI, Sept 28 (Reuters) - Abu Dhabi's state fund Mubadala Investment Company [MUDEV.UL] made a net profit of 4.2 billion dirhams ($1.14 billion) in the first half of the year, it reported on Thursday, its first set of results since merging with the other state wealth fund, International Petroleum Investment Company (IPIC).

Mubadala made a net loss of 4.7 billion dirhams in the first half of 2016, it said in a statement.

Total assets rose to 465.5 billion dirhams at the end of June, from 449.7 billion dirhams a year ago.

The merged fund, whose investments include stakes in General Electric and private equity firm Carlyle Group , also reported "total comprehensive income" of 6.8 billion dirhams in the first half of 2017 compared with a "total comprehensive loss" of 5.4 billion dirhams in the same period last year.

Separating the results for the two funds, Mubadala Development Company made a first-half net attributable profit of 578.4 million dirhams versus a loss of 4.43 billion dirhams a year ago, while IPIC made a net attributable profit of 2.67 billion dirhams, having lost 946.2 million dirhams in the first half of last year.

"In the first half of 2017, we worked to integrate the two portfolios under the Mubadala Investment Company," said Chief Financial Officer, Carlos Obeid in a statement.

"We managed our costs prudently, while monetising mature assets and growing our profit as we reduced our overall leverage."

Mubadala said little about the outlook or its investment plans in its statement, but its CEO Khaldoon al-Mubarak said earlier this year the firm was lining up new overseas investments in 2017 and might also sell or reduce some of its existing stakes in companies. [nL5N1H727O]

Mubadala's revenues in the first half totalled 83.4 billion dirhams versus 72.9 billion dirhams in the year-ago period, helped by higher revenues from its oil and gas, semiconductors and aerospace interests, the statement said.

The company also made gains from financial investments and favourable currency, it added.

In August Mubadala sold a 3.9 percent stake in Advanced Micro Devices in its second sale of shares in the U.S-based semiconductor company this year. The sale value was $529.6 million based on AMD's closing share price.[nL5N1KQ1CK]

France to hold Siemens to account on Alstom job pledges - Reuters News

{{20170928T093201.748+0000}}France to hold Siemens to account on Alstom job pledges* France to set up committee to monitor job commitments

* Siemens said would safeguard jobs and plans for 4 years

* Some firms have not kept earlier French job pledges

PARIS, Sept 28 (Reuters) - France will make sure Siemens sticks to its commitment to preserve jobs following its rail business merger with Alstom , the French finance minister said as the government seeks to reassure worried workers.

The French finance ministry said it had secured a commitment from Siemens to safeguard Alstom's French manufacturing plants and jobs for a four-year period after the deal struck this week by the two companies closes. [nL8N1M84ED][nL8N1M82F3]

"I will put in place a committee to monitor the commitments taken by Siemens towards the French state," finance minister Bruno Le Maire told BFM TV on Thursday ahead of a visit to Alstom's Valenciennes site in northern France on Friday.

With the unemployment rate still stuck above nine percent, a recent string of cross-border corporate deals giving foreign companies control over French firms have led to criticism from opposition politicians of the centrist government of new French President Emmanuel Macron.

On Wednesday, Italian shipbuilder Fincantieri won a deal to take effective control of French shipyard STX France, ending months of resistance by the French government.

In order to lessen concerns about foreign ownership, Le Maire said France will have independent board members in the new Siemens-Alstom company, who will have the right to veto all strategic decisions for four years.

He also said that the French state, as a major customer, will have a major influence on the new Siemens-Alstom due to it having a 5 to 15 percent capital stake in the combination.

Le Maire reiterated that fierce competition from Chinese players who are twice as big as Siemens and Alstom combined, meant they had no choice but to merge their rail activities.

"Otherwise we would be eaten raw," he said.

Asked about job promises made in previous takeovers of French companies, Le Maire said the government would make sure that General Electric respects commitments it made after its acquisition of Alstom's energy division two years ago.

He also said he had spoken with the president of Nokia to remind him of a promise to create jobs in France.

When buying Alcatel-Lucent in 2016, Nokia pledged to hire 500 people in research and development in France, but the firm said earlier this month it would cut nearly 600 jobs in France by end-2019 as part of a cost-cutting plan.

"I told him he needs to accelerate jobs creation, because the target has not been met and we have the means to exert all necessary pressure," Le Maire said.

* Change in locos deal may risk future foreign investment - GE

* SUV, luxury car levy hike to hit sales, govt tax revenue - Audi

* India's economic growth slowed to 3-year low in April-June

* FDI growth halved in 2016-17 from two years earlier

By Aditi Shah

NEW DELHI, Sept 27 (Reuters) - Surprise policy shifts, such as an apparent U-turn over a locomotive deal with General Electric , risk undermining Prime Minister Narendra Modi's flagship 'Make in India' initiative, which aims to create millions of jobs and boost growth, industry executives say.

GE won a $2.6 billion contract in 2015 to supply 1,000 diesel locomotives - the biggest direct investment in India by a U.S. firm and the first deal awarded to a foreign firm after India allowed 100 percent foreign investment in its railways - part of efforts to overhaul its creaking, colonial-era infrastructure.

But the railways ministry said last week it wouldn't need diesel after all - hoping to save on fuel and maintenance costs - and suggested GE might want to make electric engines instead.

Electric engines are usually used for passenger trains, while diesel is used for freight. Around 25-30 percent of India's locomotives are diesel-engined.

The policy shift could cost New Delhi in compensation - GE is already building a factory for the diesel locos - but executives and investors say it is also an important test for a government that needs foreign investment to create jobs and reboot growth ahead of a 2019 general election.

"The GE case is very important symbolically because they have been among the earliest and most committed investors," said Amitabh Dubey, a political analyst at research firm Trusted Sources.

"People will be watching to see how this plays out, particularly because the railway contracts were initiatives that the government pushed consciously and worked very hard to get these people in. To then turn around two years later and change your strategy will bother a lot of people," he said.

GE has already shipped its first diesel locomotive to India and is completing a factory in the state of Bihar. It has created around 1,000 jobs at the plant and a maintenance shed, and 5,000 jobs in the supplier network.

In a statement, the U.S. firm said the government's change would put future foreign investment at risk.

"An alteration of this contract will have serious impact on job creation and skills development, and cause the government to incur substantial costs," it said. "This will also undermine government's signature 'Make in India' initiative."

FDI GROWTH SLOWING

Foreign direct investment (FDI) into India topped $60 billion in fiscal 2016-17, almost double the levels before Modi came to power in 2014.

But after increasing by more than 20 percent in the first two years of the Modi government, FDI growth was less than half that rate in the latest financial year, hit by tax changes and a shock move to withdraw most of India's banknotes overnight.

Yashwant Sinha, a veteran leader of Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and a former finance minister, said poorly executed policy shifts had stalled growth. "Economies are destroyed more easily than they are built," he wrote in a newspaper column on Wednesday.

India's economy, Asia's third-largest, grew at a 3-year low of 5.7 percent in April-June. [nD8N1L900F] [nD8N1L900K] [nL8N1LI008] [nL4N1M13JJ]

THREE-POINT TURN

In another example of shifting goalposts, India this month blindsided the auto industry by almost doubling the maximum levy on luxury cars and sport-utility vehicles (SUVs) - just weeks after first setting the rate as part of a major tax change. [nL4N1LN3JI]

Rahil Ansari, head of Audi India, said sudden shifts affect companies' ability to plan ahead, and could force changes.

"This is bound to adversely impact sales, by possibly a double-digit reduction, and will reduce revenues for the company, dealers and perhaps also tax revenue for the government," he said.

Rival Mercedes-Benz also said the luxury car industry has been at the receiving end of arbitrary policies, and a hike in levies would affect its future expansion plans under the 'Make in India' initiative. [nL4N1KT4B4]

For change to happen in a country like India, it sometimes has to be done in a disruptive manner, and foreign investors should expect that and plan for it, said Sandip Beri, partner at Delhi-based law firm Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas.

However, the government should give industry fair time to comply with new rules, and analyse its own contractual obligations, before changing policy, he added. "There is no question that industry wants stability and predictability."

India's inability to make up its mind on its tax structure and how it responds to foreign companies pre-dates the Modi government, says Saurabh Mukherjea, CEO of Mumbai-based brokerage Ambit Capital.

"I can understand why GE is peeved, but (I'm) not sure how one should take their broader point on the impact on the economic climate in India," he told Reuters.

BREAKINGVIEWS-ABB's short-term value push takes $2.6 bln detour - Reuters Breakingviews

{{20170925T111252.404+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-ABB's short-term value push takes $2.6 bln detour(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.)

By Liam Proud

LONDON, Sept 25 (Reuters Breakingviews) - ABB's short-term shareholder value push just took a $2.6 billion detour. The Swiss engineering group is buying General Electric's industrial solutions unit despite past calls to shrink. The chance to boost lowly margins, however, means investors can live with the diversion.

At first glance, an overseas acquisition seems the last thing the group led by Ulrich Spiesshofer should be doing. ABB has a worrying track record of underperforming rivals, and has faced calls from investors like activist Cevian to simplify by spinning off its power grids business.

The acquisition of GE Industrial Solutions, based in Atlanta, brings in another 13,500 employees and sets back ABB's target of boosting margins in its Electrification Products division. The GE unit turned around 6 percent of its revenue into earnings before interest, tax and acquisition-related amortization costs last year; ABB is gunning for 15 to 19 percent by 2020.

It also means Spiesshofer will shelve a $3 billion buyback programme announced last year as part of his "next stage of unlocking value" plan. In its place, shareholders in the Zurich-based group get an asset with an ageing portfolio and a declining share of the U.S. market.

Dig into the financials, though, and the logic is more compelling. Spiesshofer reckons he can wring about $200 million of cost savings from the deal in five years. Assuming they come through, the price – equivalent to less than last year's revenue – makes for a decent return on investment. Add the synergies to the roughly $135 million of operating profit the GE unit earned last year, based on a Kepler Cheuvreux assumption of 5 percent operating margins, and tax it at the 28 percent rate analysts expect ABB to pay this year. The total of $241 million makes for a 9 percent-plus ROI – above the Swiss group's likely cost of capital of around 7.5 percent.

ABB shareholders are effectively being asked to swap the certainty of short-term buybacks for the prospect of potentially juicy synergies over a longer time period. Though that's not a sure-fire bet, the change of direction is more logical than it initially appeared.

CONTEXT NEWS

- Swiss engineering group ABB said on Sept. 25 it will buy General Electric's Industrial Solutions business for $2.6 billion.

- Products made by the GE unit include circuit breakers, switchgear and power supply equipment used for facilities including data centres.

- The Zurich-based group expects annual cost synergies of around $200 million by the fifth year of the deal, which also grants ABB long-term rights to use the GE brand.

- ABB will fund the deal with existing cash, and will put on hold a previously announced share buyback programme. The group led by Ulrich Spiesshofer in Oct. 2016 said it planned share buybacks of up to $3 billion from 2017 through to 2019.

UPDATE 2-ABB buys GE business for $2.6 bln in bet it can boost margins - Reuters News

{{20170925T081514.402+0000}}UPDATE 2-ABB buys GE business for $2.6 bln in bet it can boost margins* Swiss group to pay $2.6 bln for GE Industrial Solutions

* Sees $200 mln in annual cost synergies

* ABB suspends share buyback programme

(Adds comment from ABB CEO from call, analyst comment)

By John Miller

ZURICH, Sept 25 (Reuters) - Power grids maker ABB is buying General Electric's Industrial Solutions business for $2.6 billion in a bet it can improve the division's lacklustre margins over the next five years, the Swiss engineering company said on Monday.

Zurich-based ABB sees potential for annual cost benefits of $200 million with the deal, which includes an agreement for long-term use of GE's brand and a strategic partnership. In 2016, the GE business had sales of $2.7 billion.

The GE products include circuit breakers, switchgear, components for lighting control and power supply equipment for facilities including data centres. ABB's portfolio includes similar products.

ABB is seeking to better penetrate the North American market and gain access to GE's larger installed base of electrical installations worldwide.

ABB said the business had been "an unloved child" and pledged to upgrade aging products with its own technology to help arrest a declining U.S. market share.

ABB is suspending its $3 billion share buyback programme as part of the deal, which will bolster its position as the second-biggest supplier of electrical components behind France's Schneider Electric.

ABB is also wagering on being able to cut costs and boost profitability at the Georgia-based GE unit.

"The key rationale of the integration is, first we will make this business better. And then afterwards, we will make this business bigger and better," said ABB Chief Executive Ulrich Spiesshofer.

ABB expects integration costs of $400 million.

The GE unit's operating earnings before interest, taxes and amortisation (EBITA) are just 6 percent of sales, less than half the 15 percent operating margin at ABB's comparable Electrification Products division.

Spiesshofer said he agreed to the transaction only after striking a supply partnership where ABB and GE will increase buying and selling from each another.

"Without that, the economics wouldn't have worked," he told reporters on a call. "With the supply partnership, the economics at the price of 0.9 times revenue is working."

GE has been under pressure from activist investor Nelson Peltz's Trian Fund Management to sell assets and focus on higher-margin businesses. [nL3N1J93DT]

Some analysts said the price was surprisingly high given the GE business's low profitability.

"GE Industrial Solutions isn't in top shape, so ABB has its work cut out for it," said Zuercher Kantonalbank analyst Richard Frei.

ABB said it would finance the deal -- likely its last for some time -- with cash and did not need to raise equity capital. Its shares were little changed in early trading.

GE had resumed negotiations to sell the business to ABB after moderating its price expectations, people familiar with the matter told Reuters in August. [nL8N1L95US]

Credit Suisse and Dyal Co acted as financial advisers to ABB, and Davis Polk & Wardwell provided legal counsel.

crude prices were softer.

Drillers cut five oil rigs in the week to Sept. 22, bringing
the total count down to 744, the least since June, General
Electric Co's  Baker Hughes energy services firm said in
its closely followed report on Friday.

That put the rig count on track for a second month of losses
in a row and also its biggest monthly decline since May 2016. It
was also on track for its first reduction in rigs over a
three-month period since the second quarter of 2016.

The rig count, an early indicator of future output, is still
higher than the 418 active oil rigs a year ago as energy
companies had mapped out ambitious spending programs for 2017
when they expected U.S. crude  to be higher than the $50
per barrel range where they are currently trading. [O/R]

Crude prices were up about 7 percent so far this month after
declining in five of the past six months, including a near 6
percent drop in August as rising U.S. output helped to add to a
global glut.

U.S. shale production is set to rise for the 10th month in a
row in October to a record high 6.1 million barrels per day,
according to a U.S. government projection this week.
[nL2N1LZ1IV]

Although several exploration and production (E&P) companies
have trimmed their investments for this year due to the drop in
crude prices, they still planned to spend much more this year
than last year.

Analysts at Simmons & Co, energy specialists at U.S.
investment bank Piper Jaffray, this week revised lower its
forecast for the total oil and gas rig count growth, now
expecting it to rise to an average of 881 in 2017, compared to
884 it forecast last week. Forecasts were unchanged to rise to
959 in 2018 and 1,114 in 2019.

That compares with 859 oil and gas rigs so far in 2017, 509
in 2016 and 978 in 2015.

Analysts at U.S. financial services firm Cowen & Co's
capital expenditure tracking was unchanged this week, showing
the 64 E&Ps it tracks planned to increase spending by an average
of 49 percent in 2017 from 2016.

That expected 2017 spending increase followed an estimated
48 percent decline in 2016 and a 34 percent decline in 2015,
Cowen said.

UPDATE 1-GE nears sale of its industrial unit to ABB - Bbg - Reuters News

{{20170922T105038.510+0000}}UPDATE 1-GE nears sale of its industrial unit to ABB - Bbg(Adds background, shares)

Sept 22 (Reuters) - General Electric Co is nearing a deal to sell its industrial solutions unit to Swiss engineering company ABB Ltd in a deal valued at $2.5 billion to $3 billion, Bloomberg reported, citing people with knowledge of the matter.

The companies are likely to announce an agreement by next week, the report said on Friday. (https://bloom.bg/2fg3V9W)

A company spokesman for ABB said the company does not "comment on market rumors." GE was not immediately available for comment.

GE resumed negotiations to sell its industrial solutions business to ABB after John Flannery, who became CEO on Aug.1, decided to continue to divest the industrial conglomerate's non-core assets, Reuters had reported. [nL8N1L95US]

GE has been reviewing its portfolio after divesting its finance, appliances and NBCUniversal units in recent years.

The company has also been under pressure from Nelson Peltz's activist hedge fund Trian Fund Management LP to cut costs and focus on its core industrial businesses.

Earlier this year, GE agreed to sell its industrial water treatment business to French waste and water group Suez SA and Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec for 3.2 billion euros ($3.4 billion). [nL5N1GL5WQ]

GE's shares were marginally up at $24.96 in very light premarket trading.

U.S. drillers cut most oil rigs since January -Baker Hughes - 路透新闻

{{20170915T171029.923+0000}}U.S. drillers cut most oil rigs since January -Baker HughesSept 15 (Reuters) - U.S. energy firms cut the most oil rigs
in a week since January as a 14-month drilling recovery stalled
due to weak crude prices.

Drillers cut seven oil rigs in the week to Sept. 15,
bringing the total count down to 749, the least since June,
General Electric Co's  Baker Hughes energy services firm
said in its closely followed report on Friday.

Drillers have not added any rigs since the week of Aug. 11.

The rig count, an early indicator of future output, is still
higher than the 416 active oil rigs a year ago as energy
companies had mapped out ambitious spending programs for 2017
when they expected U.S. crude  to be higher than the $50
per barrel where they are currently trading. [O/R]

Crude prices were up about 5 percent so far this month after
declining in five of the past six months, including a near 6
percent drop in August as rising U.S. output helped to add to a
global glut.

U.S. production is expected to rise to 9.3 million barrels
per day (bpd) in 2017 and a record 9.8 million bpd in 2018 from
8.9 million bpd in 2016, according to federal energy projections
this week. [EIA/M]

Although several exploration and production (E&P) companies
have trimmed their investments for this year due to the drop in
crude prices, they still planned to spend much more this year
than last year.

Analysts at Simmons & Co, energy specialists at U.S.
investment bank Piper Jaffray, this week revised higher its
forecast for the total oil and gas rig count, now expecting it
to rise to an average of 884 in 2017, 959 in 2018 and 1,114 in
2019. Last week, it forecast 863 in 2017, 932 in 2018 and 1,078
in 2019.

That compares with 857 oil and gas rigs so far in 2017, 509
in 2016 and 978 in 2015.

Analysts at U.S. financial services firm Cowen & Co's
capital expenditure tracking was unchanged this week, showing
the 64 E&Ps it tracks planned to increase spending by an average
of 49 percent in 2017 from 2016.

That expected 2017 spending increase followed an estimated
48 percent decline in 2016 and a 34 percent decline in 2015,
Cowen said.

ATR challenges Pratt's hold on turboprop engine market - Reuters News

{{20170913T180325.588+0000}}ATR challenges Pratt's hold on turboprop engine marketPARIS, Sept 13 (Reuters) - Pratt & Whitney's grip on the regional turboprop market could come under threat after Europe's ATR said it would look closely at alternative engines for its planes in future.

Christian Scherer, who took over as chief executive of the world's largest maker of civil turboprops last year, told Reuters on Wednesday he would open the door to other potential suppliers as soon as he could.

Pratt, which is struggling to reassert itself in the passenger jet market, enjoys an effective monopoly in the market for smaller regional turboprops via its Canadian subsidiary.

ATR and Canada's Bombardier dominate the market of about 100 aircraft a year and both exclusively use PW&C engines.

The most obvious beneficiary from any decision by ATR to switch engine suppliers would be General Electric which is developing an "Advanced Turboprop", so far aimed at the business and general aviation markets.

Planemakers and airlines typically prefer competition in the engine market in order to drive down the prices for engines and the all-important aftermarket services.

Although China is vying to enter the turboprop market with its Xian MA700 aircraft, even this is being developed with engines from PW&C, underlining the U.S. firm's strong position.

Scherer praised Pratt & Whitney Canada professionalism, but said he was concerned about its "monopolistic" position, adding he would seek to stimulate competition "at the next available opportunity".

"I don't say we won't continue with Pratt, but I will use the next opening I can to weaken the over-powerful position of a number of our suppliers," Scherer said.

Pratt & Whitney Canada was not immediately available for comment.

Industry sources said Scherer has reviewed suppliers and recently replaced Honeywell as supplier of an air conditioning system in favour of Toulouse-based Liebherr Aerospace.

Any change in engine supplier would not take place immediately.

Franco-Italian ATR is pondering whether to update its family of two aircraft types with new engines and other improvements or go further and invest in an entirely new design. [nL5N1LU2RQ]

But no decision is imminent as its shareholders - Airbus and Leonardo - can't agree on whether to put up the roughly $3 billion needed to develop a new turboprop.

U.S. oil drillers cut rigs for 3rd week in four as recovery stalls -Baker Hughes - 路透新闻

{{20170908T170911.881+0000}}U.S. oil drillers cut rigs for 3rd week in four as recovery stalls -Baker HughesSept 8 (Reuters) - U.S. energy firms cut oil rigs for a
third time in the past four weeks as a 14-month drilling
recovery stalls with energy firms reducing spending plans in
response to recent crude price declines.

Drillers cut three oil rigs in the week to Sept. 8, bringing
the total count down to 756, the least since June, General
Electric Co's  Baker Hughes energy services firm said in
its closely followed report on Friday.

That compares with 414 active oil rigs during the same week
a year ago.

Drillers cut seven rigs in August, the first monthly
reduction since May 2016.

The rig count is an early indicator of future output.

The declining rig count comes amid a hive of tropical
storms, including Hurricane Harvey that hit in late August,
curtailing oil drilling activity in the U.S. Gulf and in Texas'
Eagle Ford shale plays. [nL2N1LE1NJ]

The recovery in U.S. demand as Gulf Coast refineries restart
after Harvey supported U.S. crude prices  this week, which
were trading up 1.7 percent on the week at just above $48 per
barrel.

Crude prices were up about 2 percent so far this month after
declining in five of the past six months, including a near 6
percent drop in August.

U.S. production is expected to rise to 9.4 million barrels
per day (bpd) in 2017 and a record 9.9 million bpd in 2018 from
8.9 million bpd in 2016, according to federal energy
projections. [EIA/M]

Those output gains have pressured crude prices lower in
recent months, prompting several exploration and production
(E&P) companies to reduce spending plans for this year,
including Bill Barrett Corp . [nASB0BI05]

Those companies and others had mapped out ambitious spending
programs for 2017 when they expected U.S. oil prices to be
higher than the $48 per barrel range where they are currently
trading. [O/R]

Despite recently announced spending cuts, the E&Ps, however,
still plan to spend much more this year than last year.

Analysts at U.S. financial services firm Cowen & Co said in
a note this week that its capital expenditure tracking showed
the 64 E&Ps it tracks planned to increase spending by an average
of 49 percent in 2017 from 2016.

That expected 2017 spending increase followed an estimated
48 percent decline in 2016 and a 34 percent decline in 2015,
Cowen said.

Analysts at Simmons & Co, energy specialists at U.S.
investment bank Piper Jaffray, forecast the total oil and gas
rig count would rise to an average of 863 in 2017, 932 in 2018
and 1,078 in 2019. Most wells produce both oil and gas.

That compares with 855 so far in 2017, 509 in 2016 and 978
in 2015.

RPT-INSIGHT-The next oil major? Service firm Schlumberger's big bet on production - Reuters News

{{20170908T110002.392+0000}}RPT-INSIGHT-The next oil major? Service firm Schlumberger's big bet on production(Repeats for additional clients with no changes to text)

By Liz Hampton

HOUSTON, Sept 8 (Reuters) - The world's largest oilfield services company, Schlumberger NV , is spending billions of dollars buying stakes in its customers' oil and gas projects - investing in the same ventures it supplies with equipment and expertise.

The new business model gives Schlumberger a say in drilling decisions, oilfield management and even on hiring other Schlumberger units for service contracts, the company has told investors.

The expanded operational authority saves Schlumberger from bidding for each of the many jobs that typically require separate contracts on a large drilling project - effectively locking out the firm's competitors.

Schlumberger's gamble could upend the service business model throughout the industry, as rivals including General Electric Co's unit Baker Hughes say they are considering whether to adopt similar strategies.

The model can supercharge profits on a given job but also ramps up risk, giving the firm more exposure to global oil price swings and potentially big losses if individual projects fail. The downsides have some analysts questioning whether the traditionally conservative firm is taking on too many speculative projects too quickly.

Schlumberger already has taken hundreds of millions in write-downs or impairments on some of these joint ventures, according to its financial filings.

Traditionally, oil producers manage the risk and make the financial and operational decisions on projects; they pay service providers a fee to carry out individual jobs. Firms such as Schlumberger typically supply a wide variety of services, such as well design, along with technology and staff to run rigs.

Schlumberger declined to make executives available for interviews and did not respond to written questions about its production business.

Despite early setbacks, Schlumberger has committed cash to growing the division, called Schlumberger Production Management, since its launch in 2011. Last year, it generated $1.4 billion in revenue. It had investment of $2.6 billion as of June 30, Schlumberger Executive Vice President Patrick Schorn told investors earlier this summer.

The company's investments have the firm co-managing about 230,000 barrels a day of oil and gas output at the end of 2016 - about as much as one of the largest U.S. independent producers, Pioneer Natural Resources .

This year, the company stepped up the financing role, opening a standalone investment fund to provide financing for the ventures. The company has not disclosed the size of the fund.

Such ventures require a breadth of skills and a tolerance for risk generally found at large integrated oil companies such as Chevron Corp and Exxon Mobil Corp .

Two of Schlumberger's newest partnerships - a deepwater liquefied natural gas project off the coast of Equatorial Guinea and an Argentina shale development with YPF SA - involve decision-making and operational authority similar to that typically held by multinational oil producers.

In June, Schlumberger agreed to invest $700 million in an oil exploration project with Nigerian National Petroleum Corp and First Exploration & Production that would require global oil prices of between $50 to $60 a barrel to achieve a 20 percent profit, research house Bernstein estimated in a report published in July. Current prices are struggling to break out of the bottom of that range.

COMPETING WITH CUSTOMERS

As Schlumberger's production business has grown, it has negotiated deals that include equity in oil and gas fields and as well as deals that give the firm payment based on oil and gas output, according to interviews with customers, partners, investors and former Schlumberger executives.

Schlumberger this year agreed to contribute $390 million for a 49 percent stake in a venture with YPF in Argentina's Vaca Muerta shale field, which has attracted international oil firms including Chevron and Royal Dutch Shell .

Schlumberger Chief Executive Paal Kibsgaard has downplayed the potential for its production business to compete with its own oil company customers.

He described the enterprise as "a new avenue for project investments alongside our customers" in remarks to investors in April.

Schorn also insisted this spring that the business is "not significantly changing the risk profile ... the biggest risk remains the cyclical nature" of the oil and gas industry.

'CAPABILITY AND CASH'

Investors say Schlumberger, which held $6.22 billion in cash and short-term investments at June 30, is strong enough to handle any increased risks and the price volatility of its investments in long-term projects.

As both project manager and service provider, Schlumberger also has an enviable level of control over operations, said Mike Breard of Dallas-based wealth management firm Hodges Capital, which invests in oilfield service companies.

"I like the long-term aspect of it – the fact that they are telling frack crews where to work, and using their own equipment more efficiently than might be used by some other operator," he said.

British-based natural gas explorer Sound Energy PLC was happy to give Schlumberger full rights to the service contracts on drilling projects in Morocco in exchange for a Schlumberger investment amounting to 27 percent of total costs, said the chief of British-based natural gas explorer.

Schlumberger will get 27.5 percent of revenue from the oil produced.

"We're smaller and entrepreneurial. Schlumberger has the technical capability and cash. That's the nature of the partnership," Sound CEO James Parsons said in an interview.

The duo has completed three wells in Morocco and plans to drill three more by year end.

"It's a $50 [million] or $60 million bet for them so far," Parsons said.

Schlumberger's appetite for these ventures is spurring rivals to consider similar financing and services deals. Baker Hughes recently agreed to provide about $10 million in financing to Twinza Oil's first offshore gas field in Papua New Guinea, supplying the cash to prove the merits of the field.

"It allows Twinza to have success in going out to raise financing," Baker Hughes CEO Lorenzo Simonelli said.

Baker Hughes will not take a stake in the oilfield, unlike some of Schlumberger's joint investments with producers.

RISK AND LOSS

In 2014 and 2015, Schlumberger took nearly $400 million in combined write-offs on oil production investments, including an Eagle Ford shale field in south Texas that struggled after oil prices crashed.

It also is owed about $900 million by Ecuador. In July, the South American country said it had negotiated a payment plan that includes an expanded contract that has Schlumberger agreeing to invest another $1 billion in the venture.

Schlumberger hasn't commented on the South American nation's disclosure. It previously acknowledged taking Ecuadorian bonds in lieu of cash for $150 million in bills. It also previously estimated its investment in the projects at up to $4.9 billion over 20 years.

The write downs have stirred some on Wall Street to question whether Schlumberger should take more conservative path with its oil production partnerships.

The firm's production division "used to focus on production management of well understood low-risk oil fields," said Colin Davies, a Bernstein oilfield services analyst. "Now it has expanded into frankly somewhat more speculative ventures."

Two of Schlumberger's newest partnerships - a deepwater liquefied natural gas project off the coast of Equatorial Guinea and an Argentina shale development with YPF SA - involve decision-making and operational authority similar to that typically held by multinational oil producers.

In June, Schlumberger agreed to invest $700 million in an oil exploration project with Nigerian National Petroleum Corp and First Exploration & Production that would require global oil prices of between $50 to $60 a barrel to achieve a 20 percent profit, research house Bernstein estimated in a report published in July. Current prices are struggling to break out of the bottom of that range.

COMPETING WITH CUSTOMERS

As Schlumberger's production business has grown, it has negotiated deals that include equity in oil and gas fields and as well as deals that give the firm payment based on oil and gas output, according to interviews with customers, partners, investors and former Schlumberger executives.

Schlumberger this year agreed to contribute $390 million for a 49 percent stake in a venture with YPF in Argentina's Vaca Muerta shale field, which has attracted international oil firms including Chevron and Royal Dutch Shell .

Schlumberger Chief Executive Paal Kibsgaard has downplayed the potential for its production business to compete with its own oil company customers.

He described the enterprise as "a new avenue for project investments alongside our customers" in remarks to investors in April.

Schorn also insisted this spring that the business is "not significantly changing the risk profile ... the biggest risk remains the cyclical nature" of the oil and gas industry.

'CAPABILITY AND CASH'

Investors say Schlumberger, which held $6.22 billion in cash and short-term investments at June 30, is strong enough to handle any increased risks and the price volatility of its investments in long-term projects.

As both project manager and service provider, Schlumberger also has an enviable level of control over operations, said Mike Breard of Dallas-based wealth management firm Hodges Capital, which invests in oilfield service companies.

"I like the long-term aspect of it – the fact that they are telling frack crews where to work, and using their own equipment more efficiently than might be used by some other operator," he said.

British-based natural gas explorer Sound Energy PLC was happy to give Schlumberger full rights to the service contracts on drilling projects in Morocco in exchange for a Schlumberger investment amounting to 27 percent of total costs, said the chief of British-based natural gas explorer.

Schlumberger will get 27.5 percent of revenue from the oil produced.

"We're smaller and entrepreneurial. Schlumberger has the technical capability and cash. That's the nature of the partnership," Sound CEO James Parsons said in an interview.

The duo has completed three wells in Morocco and plans to drill three more by year end.

"It's a $50 [million] or $60 million bet for them so far," Parsons said.

Schlumberger's appetite for these ventures is spurring rivals to consider similar financing and services deals. Baker Hughes recently agreed to provide about $10 million in financing to Twinza Oil's first offshore gas field in Papua New Guinea, supplying the cash to prove the merits of the field.

"It allows Twinza to have success in going out to raise financing," Baker Hughes CEO Lorenzo Simonelli said.

Baker Hughes will not take a stake in the oilfield, unlike some of Schlumberger's joint investments with producers.

RISK AND LOSS

In 2014 and 2015, Schlumberger took nearly $400 million in combined write-offs on oil production investments, including an Eagle Ford shale field in south Texas that struggled after oil prices crashed.

It also is owed about $900 million by Ecuador. In July, the South American country said it had negotiated a payment plan that includes an expanded contract that has Schlumberger agreeing to invest another $1 billion in the venture.

Schlumberger hasn't commented on the South American nation's disclosure. It previously acknowledged taking Ecuadorian bonds in lieu of cash for $150 million in bills. It also previously estimated its investment in the projects at up to $4.9 billion over 20 years.

The write downs have stirred some on Wall Street to question whether Schlumberger should take more conservative path with its oil production partnerships.

The firm's production division "used to focus on production management of well understood low-risk oil fields," said Colin Davies, a Bernstein oilfield services analyst. "Now it has expanded into frankly somewhat more speculative ventures."

INSIGHT-The next oil major? Service firm Schlumberger's big bet on production - Reuters News

{{20170908T050004.131+0000}}INSIGHT-The next oil major? Service firm Schlumberger's big bet on productionBy Liz Hampton

HOUSTON, Sept 8 (Reuters) - The world's largest oilfield services company, Schlumberger NV , is spending billions of dollars buying stakes in its customers' oil and gas projects - investing in the same ventures it supplies with equipment and expertise.

The new business model gives Schlumberger a say in drilling decisions, oilfield management and even on hiring other Schlumberger units for service contracts, the company has told investors.

The expanded operational authority saves Schlumberger from bidding for each of the many jobs that typically require separate contracts on a large drilling project - effectively locking out the firm's competitors.

Schlumberger's gamble could upend the service business model throughout the industry, as rivals including General Electric Co's unit Baker Hughes say they are considering whether to adopt similar strategies.

The model can supercharge profits on a given job but also ramps up risk, giving the firm more exposure to global oil price swings and potentially big losses if individual projects fail. The downsides have some analysts questioning whether the traditionally conservative firm is taking on too many speculative projects too quickly.

Schlumberger already has taken hundreds of millions in write-downs or impairments on some of these joint ventures, according to its financial filings.

Traditionally, oil producers manage the risk and make the financial and operational decisions on projects; they pay service providers a fee to carry out individual jobs. Firms such as Schlumberger typically supply a wide variety of services, such as well design, along with technology and staff to run rigs.

Schlumberger declined to make executives available for interviews and did not respond to written questions about its production business.

Despite early setbacks, Schlumberger has committed cash to growing the division, called Schlumberger Production Management, since its launch in 2011. Last year, it generated $1.4 billion in revenue. It had investment of $2.6 billion as of June 30, Schlumberger Executive Vice President Patrick Schorn told investors earlier this summer.

The company's investments have the firm co-managing about 230,000 barrels a day of oil and gas output at the end of 2016 - about as much as one of the largest U.S. independent producers, Pioneer Natural Resources .

This year, the company stepped up the financing role, opening a standalone investment fund to provide financing for the ventures. The company has not disclosed the size of the fund.

Such ventures require a breadth of skills and a tolerance for risk generally found at large integrated oil companies such as Chevron Corp and Exxon Mobil Corp .

UPDATE 1-Swiss utility BKW jumps into nuclear plant dismantling business - Reuters News

{{20170907T191416.038+0000}}UPDATE 1-Swiss utility BKW jumps into nuclear plant dismantling business* DfN already works with BKW at Muehleberg station

* GE, Hitachi and Veolia also looking at decommissioning business

(Adds comment from BKW)

By John Miller

ZURICH, Sept 7 (Reuters) - Swiss utility BKW AG bought a small German nuclear services company on Thursday, joining firms including GE that are banking on rising revenue from the decommissioning of European nuclear plants.

BKW, which plans to dismantle its own Muehleberg nuclear station after shuttering it in 2019, bought Dienstleistungen fuer Nukleartechnik GmbH (DfN). Its services include verifying that components removed from nuclear facilities are no longer radioactive. [nL8N1DS0MF]

Other companies, including Finland's Fortum , privately held U.S.-based Bechtel and the GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy alliance, are also seeking to benefit from plant decommissioning in Sweden as well as Germany. [nL8N1LM42M]

Germany decided to exit nuclear power by 2022 following the Fukushima disaster in Japan in 2011.

Similarly, energy groups E.ON and EnBW , which are now tearing down their German nuclear plants, are seeking to parlay newfound dismantling expertise by offering similar services elsewhere in the world.

With its acquisition of DfN, BKW hopes to capitalise on a growing sector. DfN is already working on five plants that are in the process of being decommissioned, BKW said.

"Germany has many decommissioning projects either underway or in the works with the planned or already completed shuttering of nuclear power stations," BKW said in a statement.

"That will open significant growth potential for DfN in the area of radiation protection services," it said.

BKW's DfN will be a comparatively tiny player, with 22 employees. BKW declined to disclose financial details of the transaction or current or projected revenue for DfN.

That compares E.ON's 650 staff at its PreussenElektra decommissioning unit and GE Hitachi's 3,000 employees.

French water and waste giant Veolia has also started selling nuclear dismantling and decommissioning services in recent years, while France's EDF is expected to enter the business after its acquisition of Areva NP.

DfN will not compete with larger companies that will be in charge of decommissioning, BKW said, but instead will offer complementary services necessary to completing the projects.

"The services from DfN accompany the decommissioning projects but will cover niche activities that require very special qualifications and authorisation," a spokeswoman said.

There are 449 nuclear power stations in 31 countries.

Switzerland has five reactors including Beznau 1, the world's oldest operating nuclear plant that was powered up in 1969.

BKW has worked with the Heidelberg-based company since it was founded in 2009 on radiation protection for its Muehleberg station, the Bern-based utility said. DfN's head, Martin Herzner, will continue to run the unit.

U.S. oil drillers cut rigs for 3rd week in four as recovery stalls -Baker Hughes - 路透新闻

{{20170908T170911.881+0000}}U.S. oil drillers cut rigs for 3rd week in four as recovery stalls -Baker HughesSept 8 (Reuters) - U.S. energy firms cut oil rigs for a
third time in the past four weeks as a 14-month drilling
recovery stalls with energy firms reducing spending plans in
response to recent crude price declines.

Drillers cut three oil rigs in the week to Sept. 8, bringing
the total count down to 756, the least since June, General
Electric Co's  Baker Hughes energy services firm said in
its closely followed report on Friday.

That compares with 414 active oil rigs during the same week
a year ago.

Drillers cut seven rigs in August, the first monthly
reduction since May 2016.

The rig count is an early indicator of future output.

The declining rig count comes amid a hive of tropical
storms, including Hurricane Harvey that hit in late August,
curtailing oil drilling activity in the U.S. Gulf and in Texas'
Eagle Ford shale plays. [nL2N1LE1NJ]

The recovery in U.S. demand as Gulf Coast refineries restart
after Harvey supported U.S. crude prices  this week, which
were trading up 1.7 percent on the week at just above $48 per
barrel.

Crude prices were up about 2 percent so far this month after
declining in five of the past six months, including a near 6
percent drop in August.

U.S. production is expected to rise to 9.4 million barrels
per day (bpd) in 2017 and a record 9.9 million bpd in 2018 from
8.9 million bpd in 2016, according to federal energy
projections. [EIA/M]

Those output gains have pressured crude prices lower in
recent months, prompting several exploration and production
(E&P) companies to reduce spending plans for this year,
including Bill Barrett Corp . [nASB0BI05]

Those companies and others had mapped out ambitious spending
programs for 2017 when they expected U.S. oil prices to be
higher than the $48 per barrel range where they are currently
trading. [O/R]

Despite recently announced spending cuts, the E&Ps, however,
still plan to spend much more this year than last year.

Analysts at U.S. financial services firm Cowen & Co said in
a note this week that its capital expenditure tracking showed
the 64 E&Ps it tracks planned to increase spending by an average
of 49 percent in 2017 from 2016.

That expected 2017 spending increase followed an estimated
48 percent decline in 2016 and a 34 percent decline in 2015,
Cowen said.

Analysts at Simmons & Co, energy specialists at U.S.
investment bank Piper Jaffray, forecast the total oil and gas
rig count would rise to an average of 863 in 2017, 932 in 2018
and 1,078 in 2019. Most wells produce both oil and gas.

That compares with 855 so far in 2017, 509 in 2016 and 978
in 2015.

The new business model gives Schlumberger a say in drilling decisions, oilfield management and even on hiring other Schlumberger units for service contracts, the company has told investors.

The expanded operational authority saves Schlumberger from bidding for each of the many jobs that typically require separate contracts on a large drilling project - effectively locking out the firm's competitors.

Schlumberger's gamble could upend the service business model throughout the industry, as rivals including General Electric Co's unit Baker Hughes say they are considering whether to adopt similar strategies.

The model can supercharge profits on a given job but also ramps up risk, giving the firm more exposure to global oil price swings and potentially big losses if individual projects fail. The downsides have some analysts questioning whether the traditionally conservative firm is taking on too many speculative projects too quickly.

Schlumberger already has taken hundreds of millions in write-downs or impairments on some of these joint ventures, according to its financial filings.

Traditionally, oil producers manage the risk and make the financial and operational decisions on projects; they pay service providers a fee to carry out individual jobs. Firms such as Schlumberger typically supply a wide variety of services, such as well design, along with technology and staff to run rigs.

Schlumberger declined to make executives available for interviews and did not respond to written questions about its production business.

Despite early setbacks, Schlumberger has committed cash to growing the division, called Schlumberger Production Management, since its launch in 2011. Last year, it generated $1.4 billion in revenue. It had investment of $2.6 billion as of June 30, Schlumberger Executive Vice President Patrick Schorn told investors earlier this summer.

The company's investments have the firm co-managing about 230,000 barrels a day of oil and gas output at the end of 2016 - about as much as one of the largest U.S. independent producers, Pioneer Natural Resources .

This year, the company stepped up the financing role, opening a standalone investment fund to provide financing for the ventures. The company has not disclosed the size of the fund.

Such ventures require a breadth of skills and a tolerance for risk generally found at large integrated oil companies such as Chevron Corp and Exxon Mobil Corp .

Two of Schlumberger's newest partnerships - a deepwater liquefied natural gas project off the coast of Equatorial Guinea and an Argentina shale development with YPF SA - involve decision-making and operational authority similar to that typically held by multinational oil producers.

In June, Schlumberger agreed to invest $700 million in an oil exploration project with Nigerian National Petroleum Corp and First Exploration & Production that would require global oil prices of between $50 to $60 a barrel to achieve a 20 percent profit, research house Bernstein estimated in a report published in July. Current prices are struggling to break out of the bottom of that range.

COMPETING WITH CUSTOMERS

As Schlumberger's production business has grown, it has negotiated deals that include equity in oil and gas fields and as well as deals that give the firm payment based on oil and gas output, according to interviews with customers, partners, investors and former Schlumberger executives.

Schlumberger this year agreed to contribute $390 million for a 49 percent stake in a venture with YPF in Argentina's Vaca Muerta shale field, which has attracted international oil firms including Chevron and Royal Dutch Shell .

Schlumberger Chief Executive Paal Kibsgaard has downplayed the potential for its production business to compete with its own oil company customers.

He described the enterprise as "a new avenue for project investments alongside our customers" in remarks to investors in April.

Schorn also insisted this spring that the business is "not significantly changing the risk profile ... the biggest risk remains the cyclical nature" of the oil and gas industry.

'CAPABILITY AND CASH'

Investors say Schlumberger, which held $6.22 billion in cash and short-term investments at June 30, is strong enough to handle any increased risks and the price volatility of its investments in long-term projects.

As both project manager and service provider, Schlumberger also has an enviable level of control over operations, said Mike Breard of Dallas-based wealth management firm Hodges Capital, which invests in oilfield service companies.

"I like the long-term aspect of it – the fact that they are telling frack crews where to work, and using their own equipment more efficiently than might be used by some other operator," he said.

British-based natural gas explorer Sound Energy PLC was happy to give Schlumberger full rights to the service contracts on drilling projects in Morocco in exchange for a Schlumberger investment amounting to 27 percent of total costs, said the chief of British-based natural gas explorer.

Schlumberger will get 27.5 percent of revenue from the oil produced.

"We're smaller and entrepreneurial. Schlumberger has the technical capability and cash. That's the nature of the partnership," Sound CEO James Parsons said in an interview.

The duo has completed three wells in Morocco and plans to drill three more by year end.

"It's a $50 [million] or $60 million bet for them so far," Parsons said.

Schlumberger's appetite for these ventures is spurring rivals to consider similar financing and services deals. Baker Hughes recently agreed to provide about $10 million in financing to Twinza Oil's first offshore gas field in Papua New Guinea, supplying the cash to prove the merits of the field.

"It allows Twinza to have success in going out to raise financing," Baker Hughes CEO Lorenzo Simonelli said.

Baker Hughes will not take a stake in the oilfield, unlike some of Schlumberger's joint investments with producers.

RISK AND LOSS

In 2014 and 2015, Schlumberger took nearly $400 million in combined write-offs on oil production investments, including an Eagle Ford shale field in south Texas that struggled after oil prices crashed.

It also is owed about $900 million by Ecuador. In July, the South American country said it had negotiated a payment plan that includes an expanded contract that has Schlumberger agreeing to invest another $1 billion in the venture.

Schlumberger hasn't commented on the South American nation's disclosure. It previously acknowledged taking Ecuadorian bonds in lieu of cash for $150 million in bills. It also previously estimated its investment in the projects at up to $4.9 billion over 20 years.

The write downs have stirred some on Wall Street to question whether Schlumberger should take more conservative path with its oil production partnerships.

The firm's production division "used to focus on production management of well understood low-risk oil fields," said Colin Davies, a Bernstein oilfield services analyst. "Now it has expanded into frankly somewhat more speculative ventures."

UPDATE 1-Swiss utility BKW jumps into nuclear plant dismantling business - Reuters News

{{20170907T191416.038+0000}}UPDATE 1-Swiss utility BKW jumps into nuclear plant dismantling business* DfN already works with BKW at Muehleberg station

* GE, Hitachi and Veolia also looking at decommissioning business

(Adds comment from BKW)

By John Miller

ZURICH, Sept 7 (Reuters) - Swiss utility BKW AG bought a small German nuclear services company on Thursday, joining firms including GE that are banking on rising revenue from the decommissioning of European nuclear plants.

BKW, which plans to dismantle its own Muehleberg nuclear station after shuttering it in 2019, bought Dienstleistungen fuer Nukleartechnik GmbH (DfN). Its services include verifying that components removed from nuclear facilities are no longer radioactive. [nL8N1DS0MF]

Other companies, including Finland's Fortum , privately held U.S.-based Bechtel and the GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy alliance, are also seeking to benefit from plant decommissioning in Sweden as well as Germany. [nL8N1LM42M]

Germany decided to exit nuclear power by 2022 following the Fukushima disaster in Japan in 2011.

Similarly, energy groups E.ON and EnBW , which are now tearing down their German nuclear plants, are seeking to parlay newfound dismantling expertise by offering similar services elsewhere in the world.

With its acquisition of DfN, BKW hopes to capitalise on a growing sector. DfN is already working on five plants that are in the process of being decommissioned, BKW said.

"Germany has many decommissioning projects either underway or in the works with the planned or already completed shuttering of nuclear power stations," BKW said in a statement.

"That will open significant growth potential for DfN in the area of radiation protection services," it said.

BKW's DfN will be a comparatively tiny player, with 22 employees. BKW declined to disclose financial details of the transaction or current or projected revenue for DfN.

That compares E.ON's 650 staff at its PreussenElektra decommissioning unit and GE Hitachi's 3,000 employees.

French water and waste giant Veolia has also started selling nuclear dismantling and decommissioning services in recent years, while France's EDF is expected to enter the business after its acquisition of Areva NP.

DfN will not compete with larger companies that will be in charge of decommissioning, BKW said, but instead will offer complementary services necessary to completing the projects.

"The services from DfN accompany the decommissioning projects but will cover niche activities that require very special qualifications and authorisation," a spokeswoman said.

There are 449 nuclear power stations in 31 countries.

Switzerland has five reactors including Beznau 1, the world's oldest operating nuclear plant that was powered up in 1969.

BKW has worked with the Heidelberg-based company since it was founded in 2009 on radiation protection for its Muehleberg station, the Bern-based utility said. DfN's head, Martin Herzner, will continue to run the unit.

UPDATE 1-Canada mulls buying used Boeing fighter jets from Australia - Reuters News

{{20170906T212248.023+0000}}UPDATE 1-Canada mulls buying used Boeing fighter jets from Australia(Adds aerospace firms urging Trudeau to approve Boeing deal)

By David Ljunggren

OTTAWA, Sept 6 (Reuters) - Canada, embroiled in a dispute with Boeing Co over the planned purchase of 18 new Super Hornet fighters, could buy older jets from Australia instead, the defense ministry said on Wednesday.

The Liberal government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau suspended talks with Boeing over a possible acquisition after the U.S. firm launched a trade challenge against Canadian planemaker Bombardier Inc . [nL1N1IY1KC]

Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan says Canada needs the 18 jets as a stopgap measure until it can run a competition to replace its CF-18 fighters. The CF-18 is Canada's version of the F-18, a design that is 40 years old.

"In light of Australia recently notifying all allies about their intent to dispose of their F-18 fleet, Canada visited them to inquire about the state of their equipment and spare parts," Sajjan's office said in a statement.

"It is too early to provide detailed information about other options," it added.

Boeing declined to comment. The Australian High Commission (embassy) did not reply to a request for comment.

Sajjan spokeswoman Jordan Owens said Canada had not visited other nations to assess their planes.

Trudeau on Tuesday slammed Boeing's "unfair and aggressive" challenge against Bombardier, which the U.S. firm alleges is dumping passenger planes in the American market. [nL2N1LM285]

Boeing's Canadian network of aerospace suppliers on Tuesday urged Trudeau to buy the Super Hornets, noting the firm supported more than 17,000 jobs in Canada.

"Our partnership is deep and enduring, but it needs your engagement," said a letter from 10 firms, a copy of which was seen by Reuters.

Signatories included CAE Inc , Heroux Devtek Inc and Honeywell International Inc. as well as the Canadian arms of General Electric Co and Raytheon Co .

CAE, which has close ties to Bombardier, later noted the letter had not mentioned the Boeing dispute.

Asked for a reaction to the letter, a source familiar with government thinking said the Canadian aerospace sector supported many jobs in the United States.

Australia bought 24 Super Hornets as an interim fleet until it could take delivery of F-35 planes from Lockheed Martin Corp .

Canada's former Conservative government said in 2010 it would buy 65 F-35s but later scrapped the decision, triggering years of delays and reviews.

Ahead of the 2015 election that brought him to power, Trudeau campaigned against buying the F-35 on the grounds it was too expensive. Officials now say the plane would be eligible to participate in the competition. [nL1N1E7170]

ABB plans expansion in U.S., scouting for acquisitions, CEO says - Reuters News

{{20170906T205431.682+0000}}ABB plans expansion in U.S., scouting for acquisitions, CEO saysBy Joseph White

DETROIT, Sept 6 (Reuters) - ABB Ltd plans to expand its U.S. industrial robot factory in Michigan, the company's chief executive officer said on Wednesday, while declining to comment on reports that he is weighing the purchase of a unit of rival General Electric Co .

Ulrich Spiesshofer, who took over as CEO of ABB in 2013, said in an interview that the company plans to expand its industrial robot manufacturing facility in Auburn Hills, Michigan, which delivered its first robot in March. He declined to offer details on new jobs or investment. ABB currently has a workforce of about 1,000 at the Auburn Hills complex.

Zurich-based ABB is counting on continued growth in demand for industrial robots from automakers and other sectors, such as the food and beverage industry, Spiesshofer said.

U.S. automakers have caught up with Japanese and German rivals in the level of factory automation, Spiesshofer said. "The next phase is about portfolio differentiation and expansion," as automakers build more electric cars, he said.

Spiesshofer has been reshaping ABB's portfolio of businesses through acquisitions and divestitures for the past four years. He declined to comment on whether he is discussing the acquisition of GE's industrial solutions business.

People familiar with the situation said last month that GE and ABB had restarted talks after GE cut the asking price of the business, which sells industrial electrical equipment. [nL8N1L95US]

ABB is scouting for potential acquisitions in certain areas, such as planning software, and those would likely be smaller deals, Spiesshofer said.

ABB will be "brutally disciplined" in what it buys, he said, noting that the company "could have afforded" to buy industrial robot maker Kuka last year, but walked away "because the economics did not fit what we want to do."

In a presentation on Wednesday, Spiesshofer reaffirmed that, after what he called a "transitional year" in 2017, ABB should begin hitting its goals for revenue growth of 3 to 6 percent, and returns on capital investments in the "mid-teens."

Spiesshofer said problems with excess capacity in the robotics and motion business that hit second-quarter results should be resolved by growth in business.

"I am confident for the full year we will be back" within a profit margin range of 15 to 18 percent, he said. Operating margins for ABB's robotics and motion business were 14.9 percent in the second quarter.

CORRECTED-United Tech, Rockwell deal faces bumpy road to approval, especially in the EU - Reuters News

{{20170906T015652.265+0000}}CORRECTED-United Tech, Rockwell deal faces bumpy road to approval, especially in the EU(In 4th paragraph corrects misstatement by source in 1st sentence to say combined company would have 50 percent of systems content on the Boeing 787, not 50 percent of all content. In second sentence of 4th paragraph, corrects to say Michaels does not see a regulatory issue, not that this could be a bigger issue.))

By Tim Hepher, Alwyn Scott and Diane Bartz

PARIS/NEW YORK/WASHINGTON, Sept 5 (Reuters) - U.S. aerospace and industrial company United Technologies Corp faces a long road to win approval for its $23 billion plan to buy avionics maker Rockwell Collins Inc , and the biggest bumps could be in Brussels rather than Washington.

United Tech and Rockwell, who both supply airplane makers, say the overlap in their product lines is relatively small. Yet opponents of the deal could argue the combination gives the aircraft parts supply company undue market power.

An early sign of trouble came when U.S. plane maker Boeing Co said it intended to take a "hard look" at the proposed deal. "Until we receive more details, we are skeptical that it would be in the best interest of—or add value to—our customers and industry," Boeing said in a statement.

The combined company could make more than 50 percent of the systems content on a Boeing 787 aircraft, by dollar value, noted Kevin Michaels, president of consulting firm AeroDynamic Advisory, referring to such components as flight controls and air conditioning. Michaels said he does not see the deal facing an issue from a competitive standpoint as there is virtually no overlap in products between the two companies.

Rockwell's shares rose 0.3 percent to $131.00 while United Tech shares fell 5.7 percent to $111.21, in part on the warning from Boeing. [nL2N1LM0KR]

There was also a sign that Airbus is preparing to ratchet up pressure behind the scenes. A source close to the European plane maker told Reuters there were concerns about a "disconnect" between United Technologies and the leadership of its Pratt & Whitney unit. Another Airbus source said any distraction due to the merger would benefit Pratt & Whitney's main rival CFM International, co-owned by the U.S. manufacturer General Electric Co and France's Safran .

Problems at Pratt & Whitney have delayed European aircraft deliveries, and Airbus has publicly warned United Tech to focus on delivering jet engines on time. [nP6N1JF00H]

If Boeing or Airbus opts to complain to antitrust enforcers, they can take the complaint to Europe's competition authority and either the U.S. Justice Department or Federal Trade Commission, both of which review proposed mergers for compliance with antitrust law.

Their strongest argument would be if both companies made one or several parts and had few competitors.

"Many initially assumed it would be a slam dunk because of the lack of overlap. But the EU probe may prove to be difficult, simply on the grounds that the combined company would be so big," said Nick Cunningham, aerospace analyst at UK-based Agency Partners.

Boeing could also be concerned about the "portfolio effect," where companies are able to exercise leverage based on the fact that they sell a wide range of specialized products to certain customers.

This argument was used to doom GE's plan to buy Honeywell in 2001, although it was European regulators rather than Washington who killed that deal.

Boeing or other companies objecting to the deal could complain about a loss of competition. That would be the case if the government proves that either United Tech or Rockwell had plans to expand to compete with the other, said James Tierney, a former Justice Department antitrust expert now at the law firm Orrick.

Antitrust enforcers would also be concerned by the reduced number of market players if United Tech and Rockwell were among the few companies that Boeing or Airbus could reach out to resolve technical problems, said Tierney.

That concern would be amplified if the Defense Department agreed, said Tierney.

Both the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission review proposed mergers to ensure they are legal under antitrust law. It is unclear which of the agencies would review this deal, antitrust experts said.

UPDATE 5-UTC touts $23 bln deal as stock drops, Boeing turns critic - Reuters News

{{20170905T194317.335+0000}}UPDATE 5-UTC touts $23 bln deal as stock drops, Boeing turns critic(Recasts and adds detail)

By Alwyn Scott

NEW YORK, Sept 5 (Reuters) - Investors and Boeing Co gave two thumbs down on Tuesday to aerospace and industrial company United Technologies Corp $23 billion plan to buy avionics maker Rockwell Collins Inc .

The acquisition, announced on Monday, would be the largest in aerospace history and create a new player in the top echelon of suppliers to Boeing, Airbus, Bombardier and other plane makers. [nL2N1LL17P]

United Tech shares were down 5.2 percent after Boeing said it would and use the power granted by its contracts with the companies, and its sway with regulators, "to protect our interests." [nL2N1LM15K]

The stock had fallen more than 4 percent before Boeing's statement, as analysts factored in United Tech's decision to halt share buybacks for three to four years and earnings dilution caused by the cash-and-stock deal. Analysts expected $2 billion in buybacks in the second half of 2017 alone.

The loss of years of buybacks and Boeing's unusual blowback came as plane makers are pressing United Tech and other suppliers for price cuts and trying to compete against them on high-margin services and spare parts.

By making more of the components used on each Boeing and Airbus SE aircraft, analysts say, United Technologies-Rockwell Collins would gain leverage to resist that pressure.

United Tech Chief Executive Greg Hayes, who would lead the combined company, brushed aside Boeing's concerns.

"The whole idea of this deal is to be able to drive more innovative solutions at lower cost for our customers - both the (plane makers) and the airlines," Hayes told Reuters on Tuesday, shortly before Boeing issued its criticism.

Rockwell's skill with software combined with United Tech's expertise in numerous aircraft components allows the company to offer new "digital" products that airlines want, he said.

"We'll be able to do predictive analytics that many others can't do, and that's how you add value to airline customers," Hayes said, referring to data-crunching that allows airlines to spot problems in engines and other components before they fail.

HAYES ASSURED ENDERS

Hayes said he had assured Airbus CEO Tom Enders that United Tech's Pratt & Whitney unit will stay on track to deliver between 350 and 400 jetliner engines this year.

United Tech fell behind on engine deliveries this year due to production problems, and Airbus raised concern last week about the deal distracting United Tech. [nL2N1LH0WI]

"Pratt has nothing to do with this," Hayes said, noting United Tech's aerospace unit, not Pratt, will combine with Rockwell Collins to create Collins Aerospace.

Hayes also knocked down speculation that the purchase would prompt United Tech to spin off its Carrier air conditioner or Otis elevator units, saying the company needs their cash flow to help pay down debt from the deal.

But Hayes did not rule out such sales in the longer term.

"After the deal is done, and after we pay down some debt, we're going to go back and look," he said.

If the company's share price does not reflect its value, he said, "we'll need to do something."

United Tech could sell "non-core pieces" such as home security in the meantime, Hayes said. But given taxes and lost earnings, "it's hard to make financial sense out of those transactions" unless they fetch a high price, he said.

Rockwell's shares rose 0.3 percent to $131.00 in afternoon trading. United Tech shares, part of the Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI>, fell 5.2 percent to $111.82.

"We see limited upside near term as share repurchase is withdrawn and deal timing becomes an investor focus," analyst Jeff Sprague at Vertical Research Partners said in a note.

United Tech's engines and systems portfolio has little overlap with the avionics, seats and interiors businesses of Rockwell, which Hayes said should mean little trouble during the necessary regulatory review.

The combination, if successful, would mark the rise of a second engines-to-seating supplier, after jet-engine maker Safran SA's pending $7.7-billion deal to buy seat maker Zodiac Aerospace . Safran said on Tuesday it would look at assets that might come up for sale after the United Tech-Rockwell deal. [nL8N1LM2UL]

United Tech expects to borrow $15 billion and will assume $7 billion in Rockwell debt to fund the deal, which is expected to close by the third quarter of 2018. [nL2N1LL17P]

United Tech said the acquisition would add to earnings in its first full year and yield at least $500 million in cost savings by the fourth year of operation.
